Abstract
Background: Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have drastically increased throughput and
significantly reduced sequencing costs. However, the average read lengths in next-generation sequencing technologies
are short as compared with that of traditional Sanger sequencing. The short sequence reads pose great challenges for
de novo sequence assembly. As a pilot project for whole genome sequencing of the catfish genome, here we attempt
to determine the proper sequence coverage, the proper software for assembly, and various parameters used for the
assembly of a BAC physical map contig spanning approximately a million of base pairs.
Results: A combination of low sequence coverage of 454 and Illumina sequencing appeared to provide effective
assembly as reflected by a high N50 value. Using 454 sequencing alone, a sequencing depth of 18 X was sufficient
to obtain the good quality assembly, whereas a 70 X Illumina appeared to be sufficient for a good quality
assembly. Additional sequencing coverage after 18 X of 454 or after 70 X of Illumina sequencing does not provide
significant improvement of the assembly. Considering the cost of sequencing, a 2 X 454 sequencing, when
coupled to 70 X Illumina sequencing, provided an assembly of reasonably good quality. With several software
tested, Newbler with a seed length of 16 and ABySS with a K-value of 60 appear to be appropriate for the
assembly of 454 reads alone and Illumina paired-end reads alone, respectively. Using both 454 and Illumina pairedend reads, a hybrid assembly strategy using Newbler for initial 454 sequence assembly, Velvet for initial Illumina
sequence assembly, followed by a second step assembly using MIRA provided the best assembly of the physical
map contig, resulting in 193 contigs with a N50 value of 13,123 bp.
Conclusions: A hybrid sequencing strategy using low sequencing depth of 454 and high sequencing depth of
Illumina provided the good quality assembly with high N50 value and relatively low cost. A combination of
Newbler, Velvet, and MIRA can be used to assemble the 454 sequence reads and the Illumina reads effectively. The
assembled sequence can serve as a resource for comparative genome analysis. Additional long reads using the
third generation sequencing platforms are needed to sequence through repetitive genome regions that should
further enhance the sequence assembly.

60% of all U.S. aquaculture production. Channel catfish

sequence repeats such as microsatellites (~3% of the
genome) [3,5-8].
At present, a number of genomic tools and resources
have been developed in catfish, including bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries [9,10], BAC-based physical maps [11,12], genetic linkage maps [13-15], a large
number of ESTs [2,16], over 1700 unique full length
cDNAs [17], over 60,000 BAC end sequences [3,7], and
a large number of identified molecular markers such as
microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms
[2,18]. Whole genome sequencing of catfish is underway, and this project was conducted as a pilot study to
define the parameters important for the generation of
the whole genome sequence assembly.
A major limitation of eukaryotic genome sequencing is
the costs involved in sequencing. In recent years, however, advances in sequencing technologies have allowed
drastic reduction in sequencing costs. Among many
sequencing platforms, the second generation of sequencing technologies such as 454 sequencing, Illumina
sequencing, and SOLiD sequencing are the most commonly used sequencing platforms. A common feature of
these sequencers is their relatively short sequencing
reads, making subsequent sequence assembly a great
challenge. Such challenges become even more significant
when dealing with large and complex eukaryotic genomes. Teleost genome, known to have gone through a
third round of whole genome duplication [19], poses
additional challenge when coupled with the short
sequencing reads. In consideration of such complexities,
Quinn et al. [20] conducted a pilot study with eight
pooled BAC clones covering approximately 1 Mb of the
Atlantic salmon genome with 454 GS FLX pyrosequencing, and concluded that it was difficult to achieve good
levels of genome sequence assembly with 454 sequencing with the tetraploid genome. However, with the
diploid European sea bass, Kuhl et al. [21] was able to
generate large superscaffolds (13.2-17.5 Mb) with 1739X coverage of pooled BACs using pyrosequencing.
Apparently, genome complexity as well as existing genome resources can influence the outcomes of assembly
of sequences generated from next generation sequencing. In this study, based on the existing catfish BACbased physical map, 24 pooled BAC clones covering
around 1 Mb catfish genome were sequenced by using
both pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing technologies. In addition with the existing BAC end sequences,
we aim to take full advantages of multiple sequencing
technologies and existing genetic resources for the
upcoming catfish whole genome sequencing.
Several de novo assembly software packages have been
developed for assembling genome sequences generated
from the next-generation sequencing platforms. Two
basic graph based algorithms exist for assemblers: The

first one is based on overlap-layout-consensus graphs,
such as Newbler [22] and MIRA [23]. In these packages,
the algorithm computes all pair-wise overlaps between
reads to build an overlap graph. Then, the overlap graph
is used to compute a layout of reads and consensus
sequence of contigs. The second algorithm is based on
de-Bruijn graphs, such as the algorithm used in Velvet
[24], ABySS [25], and several other packages in which
sequence reads are broken into smaller sequences of
DNA, referred to as K-mers, where K denotes the length
of these smaller sequences [26]. The de-Bruijn graph is
built based on the overlaps of length K-1 between these
K-mers rather than the actual reads. The assembly algorithms and their implementations become typically complex with large volumes of sequence data.
The objectives of this pilot study was to determine the
framework for proper levels of genome coverage using
Illumina sequencing, 454 sequencing, and a combination
of 454 and Illumina sequencing when both technical
factors and economic factors were considered, to compare the assembly of sequences using different software
packages with various parameters, and to develop a
cost-effective de novo assembly strategy for the upcoming catfish whole genome sequencing. Here we report
sequencing and assembly of twenty-four BAC clones of
the largest contig of catfish physical map using 454
sequencing, Illumina sequencing, and a combination of
these sequencing technologies, and compare their
assembly using several de novo assembly softwares.
Based on the assembly, we attempted to identify conserved syntenies among catfish and several fish species
whose genome sequences are available using BLAST
[27] sequence similarity comparisons.

Results and discussion
Generation of short sequencing reads from pooled catfish
BAC clones

To assess the de novo assembly strategy for the catfish
whole genome sequencing project, twenty-four BAC
clones were selected from the largest contig (contig0241) of the BAC-based catfish physical map. Individual clones included in the contig were pooled together
and sequenced by using both 454 and Illumina sequencing technologies. Based on the physical map, the estimated length of the contig spanned approximately 1 Mb
long. As shown in Table 1, a total of 200,901 from 454
single-end reads, 29,067,404 from Illumina 72-bp
paired-end reads from a 350-bp insert library were generated. After adaptor and BAC vector trimming, and
low quality reads filtering, a total of 41 Mb 454
sequences and 1,245 Mb Illumina paired-end sequences
were obtained (Table 1). These represented approximately 40 X and 1,200 X sequence coverage of the contig for 454 and Illumina sequencing, respectively. All the

Comparison of de novo assemblers for 454 reads and
Illumina reads

A number of sequence assemblers have been developed
recently to cope with sequences generated from the
next generation sequencers. To determine the most
appropriate assembler and its associated K-values (as
appropriate) to use for the de novo assembly of 454
reads and Illumina reads, we compared several existing
assemblers: Newbler, Velvet, ABySS, MIRA and a commercial software, CLC Genomics Workbench http://
www.clcbio.com. The Celera Assembler V6.1 was also
considered, but our Illumina sequences generated a
while ago was not long enough for the assembler. The
metrics used to evaluate the assembly included N50, the
average contig size, the maximum contig size and the
number of contigs.
As highlighted in Table 2, for 454 sequences, Newbler
allowed the most effective assembly, compared to Velvet, MIRA, or CLC Genomics Workbench. With Newbler, the best assembly was achieved at seed length (i.e.
âKâ value of the K-mer matching) of 16 at which 282 of
contigs were assembled, with N50 of 8,674 bp, average
contig size of 3,486 bp, and maximum contig length of
28,736 bp. For Illumina sequences, ABySS and Velvet
provided more effective assemblies than CLC Genomics
Workbench (Table 2). The best assembly using ABySS
was achieved at K-value of 60 at which 386 contigs were
assembled with N50 of 6,870, average contig size of
2,496 bp, and maximum contig size of 22,594 bp. Velvet
at K-value of 29 generated a similar assembly to that of
ABySS with N50 of 6,319 bp, average contig size of
1,703 bp, and maximum contig size of 35,339 bp, but
with significantly greater number of contigs. Similar
results were found in a recent study using ABySS [29].
Assembly strategy for the combination of 454 and
Illumina reads

The hybrid assembly is attempted by combining all
reads from both 454 and Illumina platform. Using the
combination of two types of sequencing reads, we tested

Velvet, ABySS, Newbler and CLC for hybrid assembly.
Using a single assembler, ABySS with K-value 60 provided a good quality assembly, with N50 value of
approximately 9.1 Kb and a maximum contig size of
approximately 26 Kb. Newbler v2.6 performed better for
the assembly of the same sequence data that generated
a N50 value of approximately 12.5 Kb and a maximum
contig size of 39 Kb. However, assembly derived from
454 reads plus Illumina reads by using a single assembler did not provide much advantage as compared with
the assembly of using only 454 reads. Rather than using
a single assembler for the hybrid assembly, it is crucial
to develop a suitable strategy by using several assemblers for the assembly of combination of different types
of sequencing reads.
The strategy for the hybrid assembly is shown in Figure
1. Initially, 454 sequences were assembled using Newbler
and Illumina sequences were assembled using Velvet.
Velvet rather than AbySS was used for the assembly of
Illumina reads because some of the contigs generated by
ABySS contained internal gaps since ABySS has the capability to merge contigs using paired-end information,
and these internal gaps may influence the subsequent
assembly attempts. After the initial separate assembly,
the contigs assembled and the remaining unassembled
sequences were subjected to a secondary assembly using
MIRA. This additional assembly step with MIRA maximized the complementary advantages of 454 and Illumina reads, resulting in the assembly of 193 contigs. The
maximum contig size was 71,434 bp. All 75 BAC end
sequences from the same physical map contig generated
in our previous studies [3,7] were aligned to the hybrid
assembled contigs, suggesting that the sequence coverage
is near completion and gaps are small, as expected from
the size estimation. The contigs sequences have been
deposited to Catfish Genome Database cBARBEL http://
www.animalgenome.org/catfish/cbarbel/contig0241.
Several studies have utilized two-step assembly strategy for the assembly of Illumina and 454 sequences: In
an effort to sequence the whole genome of a model
fungi Sordaria macrospora, Nowrousian et al. [30] preassembled 454 reads first, and then constructed an
assembly by using the combined raw data from both
Illumina and 454 reads using Velvet assembler; In a different study, the whole genome sequence reads from a
bacteria, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Illumina reads were
alone pre-assembled first and the contigs generated
from this assembly plus the singletons and the 454
reads were then assembled using Newbler [31].
Depth of sequence coverage required for effective de
novo assembly

The depth of sequence coverage needed for effective
sequence assembly depends on the genome size, the GC

content [32] and repetitive elements content of the
organism, and the sequence read lengths. In addition,
error correction algorithms used in assemblers can be
utilized effectively when the depth of coverage is high
[33]. The Beijing Genomics Institute sequenced the
Giant Panda genome using 75 bp Illumina reads at a
coverage of 50 X [34] leaving a small number of gaps
that may be filled by Sanger sequencing [33]. In this
pilot project, we evaluated the influence of depth of

sequence coverage of different types of sequencing data
sets on the overall assembly. As shown in Figure 2, the
N50 values increased almost linearly until the 454
sequences reached 18 X coverage. After 18 X sequence
coverage, additional 454 sequencing generated slightly
greater N50 values, but was not cost effective any
longer. We understand that our 454 sequences were
generated with older chemistry and overall sequence
length was relatively short, but the point is that with

Figure 1 Hybrid assembly strategy pipeline. All 454 reads were assembled by using Newbler assembler with seed length 16, minimum

relatively short 454 sequences, assembly quality is initially positively correlated with sequence coverage. However, when the sequence coverage reached a certain
level (here 18 X), additional sequence coverage was no
longer effective (Figure 2). Similarly, with Illumina
sequencing, the N50 values increased almost linearly

with the sequence coverage up to 70 X sequence coverage (Figure 3). However, additional Illumina sequencing
was ineffective in providing a better sequence assembly,
as reflected in the plateau N50 values after 70 X
sequence coverage (Figure 3). Apparently, the assembly
that can be achieved may be related to sequence read

lengths, e.g., the higher level of genome coverage may
not help if the sequence read length is short.
An effective sequencing strategy is to use a hybrid
sequencing strategy of Illumina plus 454 sequencing. In
order to determine if a hybrid approach is cost effective,
we evaluated assembly of the contig using various 454
and Illumina sequence coverage combinations. As
shown in Figure 4, inclusion of 454 sequencing very
effectively increased N50 of the assemblies. Interestingly,
a small sequence coverage of 454 sequencing provided
almost as effective sequence assembly as a large 454
sequence coverage. Only when the 454 sequences
reached a very high sequence coverage (over 30 X coverage), the overall sequence assembly was more effective
with much greater N50. N50 values of 454 sequences at
6-30 X provided similar assemblies. Similar but different
assembly patterns were observed with various sequence
coverages of Illumina sequences: with or without 454
sequences, the N50 values of the assemblies increased
almost proportional to Illumina sequence coverages up
to 70 X sequence coverage; thereafter, additional Illumina sequences were not effective in increasing the N50
values. Considering the cost for the two sequencing
platforms, 454 sequencing is much more expensive than
Illumina sequencing, e.g., 2 X catfish whole genome
sequencing with 454 sequencing technology will cost
$25,000, which is almost the cost to get 140 X catfish
whole genome sequences using Illumina sequencing.
Taking the cost into consideration, it appears that the

assembly of 2 Ã 454 sequences and 70 X Illumina
sequences was the most effective (Figure 4). The importance of longer reads should be noted. In the catfish
genome, and perhaps many fish genomes as well, there
are long repetitive elements such as the mariner-like
DNA transposons. Long reads helps to get through such
long repetitive regions. Working with the genome of
Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Schadt et al. [35] demonstrated that long reads generated from PacBio sequencing can help resolve assembly difficulties in a repetitive
region spanning 1.5 kb, which otherwise cannot be
assembled by using Illumina sequencing. In our case
with the catfish genome segment here, the failure of
contig assembly was mostly caused by repetitive
sequences, and therefore, the adoption of PacBio, or
similar long sequencing platforms, should enhance the
contig assembly.
Comparison of assembly with Illumina paired-end and
single-end reads and scaffolding

Paired-end reads are the reads in pairs such that each
pair is of a known distance from each other. Although
the cost associated with library construction of singleend reads is much cheaper than that of paired-end
reads, because of their linked nature, paired-end reads
are important for de novo assembly because they can
improve the assembly by spanning repeat regions,
anchoring reads to the sequence within repeat regions,
and ordering of contigs into larger scaffolds [32]. To

Figure 4 Comparison of N50 values assembled with various sequencing depth combination of 454 and Illumina reads. The assemblies
were achieved by using the two step approach (Newbler for 454 data, Velvet for Illumina data for initial assembly followed by assembly with

investigate the advantage of paired-end reads over single-end reads, we compared the assembly between Illumina paired-end and single-end reads with the same set
of sequence data using ABySS with a K-value of 60.
Table 3 clearly shows the advantage of paired-end reads
over single-end reads for de novo assembly. The N50
value with Illumina paired-end reads is approximately
3.6 Kb, which is 5.6 times larger than the N50 value of
single-end reads assembly (652 bp). Similarly, the maximum contig size with Illumina paired-end reads is
almost 21 Kb, while the maximum contig size of singleends reads assembly was only 3.5 Kb (Table 3). The difference in the number of assembled contigs is more dramatic, with 716 contigs from paired-end reads assembly
but 2,230 contigs with single-end reads assembly. In a
recent study, the giant panda whole genome draft was
completed by using multiple paired-end reads libraries
with different insert size [34], which initiated the eukaryotic genome sequencing and assembly based mostly on
the next generation sequencing platform. Clearly, use of

multiple libraries in various sizes would increase the
effectiveness of sequence assemblies, but that was not
tested in this study.
The importance of paired reads is not limited to contig assembly. They are even more important in scaffolding by bringing separate contigs together into larger
scaffolds. For instance, when the paired-end reads of
Illumina sequences were used, the 193 contigs were
brought together into 68 scaffolds. The scaffolding capacity of paired-end reads is under estimated in this study
because we used a library with small insert size of 350
bp. The scaffolding capacity of paired-end reads should
be much greater if larger insert libraries were used. The
BAC end sequences helped in scaffolding, but were less
effective than expected because of the small number of
the available mate paired BAC end sequences within
this contig. Of the 75 BAC end sequences falling within
this contig, only 29 were mate paired reads. Along with
the paired-end reads of Illumina sequences, these BAC
end sequences allowed assembly of 193 contigs into 61
scaffolds with the largest scaffold of 684,936 bp.
In order to have a sense of comparison of the
sequence assembly in this pilot study with similar studies or those achieved through whole genome sequencing, we summarized contig size information in Table 4.
In terms of N50 and average contig sizes, the assemblies
presented here with catfish is similar to those of the
pilot study with Atlantic salmon [20]. A direct comparison of the assemblies here with only one million base

pairs and those with the whole genome sequences is difficult because the sequence complexities and sequencing
strategies were different. However, if the similar results
from this pilot study could be extended to the genome
scale with similar genome coverage, the results to be
achieved with catfish whole genome sequencing would
be similar to those achieved with Tetraodon, Fugu, or
Atlantic cod.
Repetitive content analysis and annotation of the
assembled region

Repetitive content of the assembly were assessed by
using RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org
against zebrafish repeat database. A total of 140,019 bp
(13.6%) sequences were masked. The content of various
types of repetitive elements in the assembled region is
presented in Table 5. The most abundant type of repeat
was found to be DNA transposons totaling 8.38% of the
assembly, which confirmed our previous findings that
DNA transposons were the most abundant type of repetitive elements in the catfish genome [3,6,7]. However,
the 8.38% of DNA transposons found here was almost
twice the amount as previously assessed [6].
Overall, 98.5% of all reads were assembled. That is to
say, 1.5% of the generated sequences were not
assembled. Apparently, many unassembled sequences
were very short reads, but they are probably also repetitive in nature so that prohibit themselves to be
assembled. BLAST was used to assess the nature of the
unassembled sequences against the nr database with a
cutoff E-value of 1e-5. Most hits were repetitive elements such as transposable elements (~18% of unassembled reads), retrotransposons reverse transcriptase-

like sequences (~8%), zinc-finger protein-like (~1%),
recombinase-like protein (~1%), among others. In addition, the unassembled sequences were also used for
BLAST search against themselves to determine if they
are highly repetitive sequences themselves. Approximate
79% of the unassembled reads can hit more than 10
other reads, 55% of which hit more than 100 other
reads. Taken together, these results indicated that the
unassembled reads are located in the repetitive region of
the genome, resulting in gaps when conducting de novo
assembly. Therefore, long reads are crucially important
to go through such repetitive regions of the genome.
The repeat masked contig sequences were searched
against NCBI nr database using both BLASTX searches
and GENSCAN gene model prediction algorithm [36] to
identify the genes in the assembled region. A total of 18
genes were identified (Figure 5). These genes included
creatine kinase (brain A type), erythroid differentiationrelated factor 1, tonsoku-like DNA repair protein, proteasome 26 S subunit ATPase, zinc finger RNA-binding
domain containing protein 1 b, kinase A (PRKA)-anchor
protein 6, neuronal PAS domain protein 3, E3 ubiquitin
protein ligase UBR1, photoreceptor outer segment membrane glycoprotein 2-like, methyltransferase-like protein
21 D, ADP-ribosylation factor 6, asparaginase homolog,
kinesin family member 26 A, transmembrane protein
179, polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase like,
CU302376.1, exonuclease 3â-5â domain containing 2, and
Numb homolog protein (Figure 5).
After gene annotation, we attempted to identify conserved syntenies in the assembled region with the genomes of four fish model species, medaka, stickleback,
Tetraodon and zebrafish. The order of the catfish genes

Figure 5 Schematic presentation of conserved syntenic regions among catfish, zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, and Tetraodon. A list of
the 18 identified genes in the sequenced region is shown on the upper panel of the figure, with each gene abbreviated using a letter to make
it easier to present the conserved syntenies at the lower panel of the figure. For instance, the letter A represents creatine kinase (brain type A).
Figure was drawn not proportionally to the scale as indicated by the double slashes. Same color indicates conserved syntenic blocks.

was oriented by anchoring the scaffolds to the physical
map by using BAC end sequences. One syntenic block
containing seven genes (designated as J-K-L-M-N-I-H in
Figure 5) and a second syntenic block containing four
genes (designated as O-P-Q-R in Figure 5) are highly
conserved, across most of these fish species (Figure 5).

Several other smaller syntenic blocks were also somewhat conserved that contained 2-4 genes (Figure 5).
However, the distance spanning these genes is different.
All these 18 genes were found in catfish physical map
contig of approximately 1 Mb, but these genes were
found to be located in a genomic region of

Jiang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:629
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/629

approximately 7 Mb in stickleback, 8 Mb in Tetraodon,
over 24 Mb in medaka, and 44 Mb in zebrafish. Nonetheless, gene arrangements in the catfish genome are
most similar to that in zebrafish, consistent with their
phylogenetic relations [37].

Conclusions
The results of this study demonstrated that for the catfish genome, the hybrid sequencing strategy using both
454 and Illumina is more effective than either alone,
especially when sequencing costs were also considered,
as demonstrated with the potato genome project [38].
Initially, the effectiveness of sequence assembly was
almost linearly correlated with the depth of sequence
coverage, but additional sequencing after a certain level
(18 Ã 454 and 70 X Illumina) provided no additional
power for effective sequence assembly. The best assembly software for 454 reads appears to be Newbler as
assembly statistics resulted in the lowest number of contigs and highest values for the contig size as well as N50
value. Using the same set of assembly criteria, both
ABySS and Velvet appear to be suitable for the assembly
of Illumina reads. A two-step strategy, initially using
Newbler for 454 reads and Velvet for Illumina reads followed by using MIRA, seemed to provide highly effective sequence assembly. Sequencing of this genomic
region allowed identification of 18 protein encoding
genes. Their genomic arrangements are highly conserved
among catfish, zebrafish, medaka, Tetraodon, and
stickleback.
It should be noted that this work dealt with only one
million base pair region of the catfish genome. Therefore, while this work provide framework for planning of
whole genome sequencing of the catfish genome, extension of technical parameters from this work to whole
genome sequencing requires additional work. The combination of 454 and Illumina sequencing may not be
effective in dealing with fish whose genomes are polyploidy or contain complex and long repeat structures.
Even for the catfish genome, sequence assembly was
attenuated with repeats, and therefore, an appropriate
level of long reads, e.g., those produced by PacBio
sequencing [35,39], to pass through the repeat regions
may prove to be very useful.
Methods
DNA preparation and sequencing

Twenty four clones ensuring the coverage of a minimum
tiling path of the contig0241 from the CHORI-212 BAC
library [10] were selected for sequencing. The BAC DNA
isolation was conducted as previously described [3], with
modifications. Briefly, BAC clones were transferred from
384-well plates to a 96-well culture block, which contained 1.5 ml of 2X YT medium with 12.5 Î¼g/ml

Page 10 of 12

chloramphenicol and grown at 37Â°C overnight with shaking at 300 rpm. The block was centrifuged at 2000 Ã g
for 10 min in an Eppendorf 5804R bench top centrifuge
to collect bacteria. The culture supernatant was decanted
and the block was inverted and tapped gently on paper
towels to remove remaining liquid. BAC DNA was isolated using the Perfectprepâ¢ BAC 96 kit (Eppendorf
North America, Westbury, NY) according to the manufacturerâs specifications. An equal amount of 1 Î¼g DNA
per BAC clone was pooled, followed by purification with
phenol/chloroform. This DNA was used for 454 and Illumina sequencing in the Genomic Services Lab at HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology (Huntsville, AL).
Assembly strategy

All raw 454 reads and Illumina reads were trimmed of
BAC vector sequences and low quality reads were filtered before assembly. CLC Genomics Workbench was
used to trim raw sequences with quality score limit of
0.01 (Q20). Illumina 72-bp paired-end reads and 454
reads shorter than 15 bp were discarded. Assembly of
454 reads alone was performed by Newbler v. 2.6, Velvet
v. 1.0.01, MIRA v. 3.0.0 and CLC Genomics Work
bench v. 4.0.0 (CLC Bio, Cambridge, MA). Newbler with
seed length from 10 to 16, and Velvet with K-value
from 25 to 95 were tested. For Illumina data, assembly
of Illumina reads alone was performed by Velvet,
ABySSv.1.2.1 and CLC Genomics Workbench. Velvet
with K-value from 21 to 61, and ABySS with K-value
from 30 to 64 were tested. The hybrid assembly with
both 454 and Illumina data included three major steps:
First, 454 reads alone was pre-assembled by Newbler
with seed length 16, minimum overlap length 40 and
minimum overlap identity 95%; second, Illumina reads
were pre-assembled alone using Velvet with K-value 29.
Although Velvet is able to generate scaffolded contigs,
this function was turned off in this step to prevent influence of scaffolded contigs on the subsequent hybrid
assembly step; third, pre-assembled 454 and Illumina
contigs along with singeltons were assembled using
MIRA, with minimum overlap 40.
Comparison of assembly of paired-end reads and singleend reads

In order to compare the effects of both paired-end and
single-end reads on de novo assembly, the Illumina
paired-end sequencing data set was assembled using
ABySS with a K-value 60. The same paired-end reads
data set was treated as single-end reads for the comparison, by neglecting the paired-end information.
Gene prediction and comparative analysis

Repetitive elements were masked using RepeatMasker
against zebrafish repeat database. Repeat masked

sequences were used for gene and syntenic identification
by using both gene prediction algorithms and sequence
similarity searches. GENSCAN gene model prediction
algorithm was used to predict introns and exons. The
resulting predictions were searched against NCBI nr
database by using BLASTX with an E-value cutoff of 1e10. The identified gene sequences were used for
TBLASTX search against medaka, stickleback, Tetraodon and zebrafish peptide database with an E-value cutoff of 1e-10. The chromosomal positions of the
homologous genes were identified from Ensembl
database.
