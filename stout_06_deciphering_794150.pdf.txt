Abstract
Background: Studying mitosis requires a system in which the dramatic movements of
chromosomes and spindle microtubules can be visualized. PtK cells, due to their flat morphology
and their small number of large chromosomes, allow microscopic visualizations to be readily
performed.
Results: By performing RNAi in PtK cells, we can explore the function of many proteins important
for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. Although it is difficult to transfect DNA into
PtK cells (efficiency ~ 10%), we have transfected a fluorescent siRNA at nearly 100% efficiency.
Using a cDNA expression library, we then isolated a complete PtK MCAK (P-MCAK) cDNA. PMCAK shares 81% identity to Human-MCAK (H-MCAK) protein and 66% identity to H-MCAK
DNA. Knockdown of P-MCAK by RNAi caused defects in chromosome congression and defective
spindle organization. Live imaging revealed that chromosomes had defects in congression and
segregation, similar to what we found after microinjection of inhibitory anti-MCAK antibodies.
Because it is laborious to isolate full-length clones, we explored using RT-PCR with degenerate
primers to yield cDNA fragments from PtK cells from which to design siRNAs. We isolated a
cDNA fragment of the mitotic kinesin Eg5 from PtK cells. This fragment is 93% identical to H-Eg5
protein and 87% identical to H-Eg5 DNA. A conserved 21 bp siRNA was used for RNAi in both
HeLa and PtK cells in which Eg5 knockdown resulted in an increased mitotic index and cells with
monopolar spindles. In addition, we used RT-PCR to isolate fragments of 5 additional genes, whose
sequence identity ranged from 76 to 90% with human, mouse, or rat genes, suggesting that this
strategy is feasible to apply to any gene of interest.
Conclusion: This approach will allow us to effectively probe mitotic defects from protein
knockdowns by combining genomic information from other organisms with the tractable
morphology of PtK cells.

Background
The mitotic spindle consists of a dynamic array of microtubules and their associated proteins [1,2]. Dynamic

microtubules are critical both for spindle assembly and
for chromosome movement by capturing chromosomes
at the kinetochore, the specialized site where microtuPage 1 of 15

bules contact mitotic chromosomes [3,4]. The mitotic
spindle is comprised of three classes of microtubules
whose dynamics appear to be differentially regulated [5].
Within the spindle, the non-kinetochore or spindle
microtubules turn over rapidly; in contrast, the bundles of
microtubules in the kinetochore fibers are overall more
stable, but locally highly dynamic [6-8]. The astral microtubules are more dynamic relative to interphase microtubules, but it is not known how their stability compares to
those of the spindle [9].
Microtubule polymerization dynamics are of fundamental importance for the intracellular functions of the microtubule cytoskeleton and are highly regulated. In general,
microtubules in cells turn over much more rapidly than
microtubules assembled from pure tubulin in vitro [10],
due to cellular factors that contribute to increased microtubule turnover, including Op18 [11-15], Tog [16-23],
and the microtubule depolymerizing kinesins, MCAK and
Kif2A [24-28]. In particular, the essential role that MCAK
plays to regulate microtubules in the spindle and at the
kinetochore has been the recent focus of much attention.
MCAK is a member of the Kinesin-13 family [29], whose
members depolymerize microtubules rather than translocate along them [30-32]. MCAK was originally identified
as a protein that localizes to centromeres in mitosis [33],
and was shown to be critical for spindle assembly in Xenopus egg extracts [24]. MCAK directly destabilizes microtubules by binding to either microtubule end and inducing
a conformational change in the microtubule that leads to
depolymerization [25,34]. Furthermore, MCAK regulates
microtubule dynamics in the cell both during interphase
and mitosis [26]. More recently, it has been shown to be a
member of the microtubule plus-end tip tracking proteins, but the functional significance of this activity is not
known [35,36]. The exact role of MCAK in chromosome
movement and segregation has been a subject of debate,
specifically, whether it is needed solely for chromosome
congression before anaphase or whether it also functions
directly in chromosome segregation at anaphase [37-40].
In order to study the exact role of MCAK and other
Kinesin-13 family members in the regulation of cellular
microtubule dynamics, it is essential to use a cell type in
which the dynamics of microtubules during mitosis can
be readily visualized. One popular cell type is the marsupial PtK2 cell, from the kidney of a normal adult male
Potorous tridactylis, which has a large flat morphology and
a small number of large chromosomes (for example see
[41,42]). However, functional analysis has been limited
to the microinjection of inhibitory antibodies or application of small molecule inhibitors due to the lack of
genomic information for RNAi knockdown. In addition,
these cells generally transfect poorly, which hinders such

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/26

studies. Here we report the identification of the PtK MCAK
gene and the optimization of the techniques to use siRNAmediated knockdown to deplete endogenous MCAK and
compare those effects to those of antibody inhibition. In
addition, we use RT-PCR to identify several other partial
gene sequences and show the effects of knockdown of
additional PtK genes to demonstrate the applicability of
our approach.

Results and discussion
P-MCAK is homologous to Human and Xenopus MCAK
To isolate a clone encoding P-MCAK, we screened a PtK1
cDNA expression library with an antibody raised against
the N-terminus of Xenopus laevis MCAK (X-MCAK). We
isolated a full-length clone that was 2865 nucleotides in
length and coded for a 729 amino acid protein with a predicted MW of 81,552 Da. This protein was 81% identical
to Human MCAK (H-MCAK) overall and 92% identical in
the catalytic domain (Figure 1). P-MCAK was 66% identical to X-MCAK overall and 86% identical in the catalytic
domain. The N-terminal region, which is responsible for
targeting MCAK to centromeres, was 76% identical
between P-MCAK and H-MCAK and 50% identical
between P-MCAK and X-MCAK. Previously identified and
functionally important Aurora B phosphorylation sites
were also conserved between these three proteins (Figure
1).
Knockdown of P-MCAK causes defects in spindle
morphology and chromosome alignment
To explore the utility of PtK cells for protein knockdown
by RNAi, we transfected cells with siGLO, a fluorescently
labelled siRNA, and examined them by fluorescence
microscopy. We found that nearly 100% of the cells contained the fluorescent dsRNA when examined at 48 hrs
post-transfection (not shown). This is in sharp contrast to
the small percentage of cells (10–15%) that express a GFPfusion protein at 48 hrs post-transfection of DNA [26]. To
look specifically at the consequences of P-MCAK knockdown, we transfected a nonfluorescent P-MCAK specific
21 bp siRNA into PtK2 cells and examined the cells at 72
hr post-transfection. P-MCAK levels could be reproducibly knocked down by ~96% (range 90–99%) as judged by
immunoblot (Figure 2A). In mitotic cells, P-MCAK staining at the centromeres and in the cytoplasm was either no
longer visible or greatly reduced (Figure 2B–C). Cells in
which P-MCAK levels were knocked down had defects in
chromosome alignment and spindle structure (Figure
2D–G), as well as an accumulation of cells in prometaphase (Figure 2H). P-MCAK knockdown cells often had
prometaphase chromosome arrangements in which there
were numerous chromosomes located at spindle poles
(Figure 2G), similar to what has been observed upon
expression of a dominant-negative MCAK fragment that
targets centromeres in PtK cells [40] and to MCAK RNAi

in HeLa cells [43]. A large percentage of bipolar spindles
exhibited increased microtubule staining, with excessively
long astral microtubules extending toward the cell cortex
(Figure 2G, I), which have been referred to as "hairy" spindles [26]. The extent of increased polymer after MCAK
inhibition seen in other studies is highly variable with
some groups reporting an increase [26,44] (Hedrick and
Walczak submitted) and others not seeing a defect in spindle polymer [28,37,43]. Despite these discrepancies, our
results are consistent with the idea that one major function of MCAK is to control spindle microtubule dynamics
during mitosis to insure proper spindle formation and
proper attachment of chromosomes on the spindle.
Loss of MCAK causes defects in chromosome movement
Previous studies with injection of a centromere dominantnegative form of MCAK [40] or expression of motorless
MCAK [37] resulted in an increased number of lagging
chromosomes, which are chromosomes that remain in
the midzone during anaphase and often into telophase.
This is in contrast to our current studies in which knockdown of MCAK by RNAi did not result in lagging chromosomes during anaphase upon analysis of fixed samples
(data not shown). This might be because the low frequency of anaphase cells in fixed samples in both control
and MCAK RNAi cells hindered our analysis of this defect.
Because lagging chromosomes are often caught at the
midzone beyond anaphase, we also scored telophase cells
for lagging chromosomes. Though our results did show a

decrease in the percentage of telophase cells after MCAK
RNAi (Fig. 2H), we still did not see an increase in lagging
chromosomes (data not shown). Another possibility is
that during early anaphase, some chromosomes lag
behind the mass of segregating chromosomes, but then
recover quickly enough so that these "stragglers" [45]
eventually get partitioned to the two daughter cells. This
phenotype would be difficult to discern in fixed analysis.
To test this possibility, we imaged control and MCAK
RNAi cells by time-lapse phase contrast microscopy.
Time-lapse movies were scored for congression and segregation defects (Figure 3A, B, Table 1 and Videos 1 and 2).
The most common defects were in chromosome congression. There was an increase in the percentage of cells that
had chromosomes lingering near the poles for extended
periods of time compared to control cells. There was also
an increase in the percentage of cells that underwent multiple attempts at congression, which was defined as any
chromosome that regressed toward the pole after it had
congressed more than half the distance from the spindle
pole to the metaphase plate (Figure 3A, Video 2). In addition, there was an increase in the percentage of cells in
which not all chromosomes congressed to the metaphase
plate prior to the onset of anaphase. The most striking
defect was that in MCAK RNAi cells, nearly all cells had a
dispersed, or "loose", metaphase plate, which coincided
with chromosomes that exhibited high oscillations (Figure 3A), similar to what we observed previously after

injection of a centromere dominant-negative MCAK [40].
Despite these defects, there was no significant alteration
in the timing of mitosis from nuclear envelope breakdown until anaphase onset. As for lagging chromosomes,
we found only a small percentage of cells with chromosomes remaining at the spindle equator after segregation;
we often found that these laggers appeared to be corrected
late in mitosis when they would quickly move toward one
pole or the other [45]. However, there was a higher incidence of "straggling" chromosomes, which trailed behind
the segregating chromosomal mass (Figure 3B). The
appearance of straggling chromosomes correlated with
high oscillations at the metaphase plate. This may be
because, in a highly oscillating pair, the sister chromatid
most distal to the pole to which it will eventually segregate
could appear as a straggler because it started anaphase
away from the main chromosomal mass. In the phase
movies that we observed it is difficult to definitively track
individual chromosomes through the chromosomal mass
as they separate to their respective poles.
In addition to chromosome congression and segregation
defects, we determined that MCAK RNAi cells also displayed an overall shorter spindle length (Table 1). This
result may at first seem counterintuitive. Because we have
shown that depletion of MCAK results in increased astral
microtubule length, it could be expected that its depletion
would also result in longer spindle microtubules increasing the overall spindle length. However, the increased
length of the astral microtubules seen upon the depletion
of MCAK may instead sufficiently reduce the overall tubulin pool available so that normal spindle length cannot be
maintained in the dividing cell. Alternatively, it has been
shown previously that treatment of cells with low concentrations of paclitaxel, which suppress microtubule dynamics without causing a significant change in microtubule
polymer, also result in shorter spindles [46]. The authors
interpreted this data to indicate that paclitaxel suppressed
plus-end dynamics of kinetochore microtubules without
affecting the depolymerization at poles due to flux. Inhibition of MCAK may similarly be suppressing plus-end
dynamics of kinetochore microtubules. Consistent with
this idea, we reported previously that injection of the
MCAK centromere dominant-negative also caused shorter
spindles [5].
To determine if the defects in MCAK RNAi cells were similar to those we have described earlier with fixed analysis
of cells after antibody microinjection, we imaged cells by
time-lapse phase contrast microscopy after antibody
injection [26]. Prophase cells were injected with either
control IgG or anti-MCAK antibodies and then followed
through mitosis by phase-contrast microscopy. Similar to
the MCAK RNAi cells, the MCAK antibody injected cells
had defects during chromosome congression (Figure 3,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/26

Table 1, and Videos 3 and 4). Chromosomes lingered at
spindle poles, had difficulty in congression and most significantly had increased oscillations at the metaphase
plate, which resulted in a loose metaphase plate and perhaps the higher incidence of straggling chromosomes at
anaphase. Similar to MCAK RNAi cells, anti-MCAK antibody injected cells also had shorter spindles. One difference between antibody-injected and RNAi cells is that
although MCAK RNAi caused a slight increase in lagging
chromosomes, the antibody-injected cells had a higher
incidence of lagging chromosomes. However, the overall
percentage of cells with one or more segregation defects
was only slightly higher in MCAK antibody injected cells
than in MCAK RNAi cells.
It is not clear why the segregation defects translate to fewer
lagging chromosomes in MCAK RNAi knockdown cells
versus MCAK antibody inhibited cells. One possibility is
that cell-to-cell variability with RNAi knockdown and the
lower numbers of cells in our live analysis contributed to
the lower overall percentage of lagging chromosomes in
MCAK RNAi cells. Unfortunately we could not fix and
stain live cells imaged after MCAK RNAi to determine the
extent of knockdown in the imaged cell because MCAK
staining is quite diffuse in the cytoplasm and in the
nucleus at early G1. However, the failure to see lagging
chromosomes in fixed analysis of both anaphase and telophase cells where we had analyzed many more cells suggests that these results are not simply due to inefficient
knockdown in the imaged cells. It could be that antibody
inhibition blocks MCAK activity in ways that RNAi does
not. Antibody inhibition may impede MCAK function
locally in the cell, such as at the centromere, and this contributes to the increase in lagging chromosomes in ways
that global knockdown by RNAi would not, or it could be
that our antibodies are interfering with the function of
another protein that possibly interacts with MCAK producing a cumulative effect. We think both of these possibilities are unlikely because the antibody-antigen
complexes are found in the cytoplasm, not at the centromere [26], and because we have injected 3 different antibodies, including a newly developed one to the P-MCAK
protein, as well as a dominant-negative version of MCAK,
and all give similar phenotypes. Another possibility is that
RNAi knockdown depletes the protein over a longer time
period than antibody injection, which may allow a compensatory mechanism to be activated. In the antibody
injection studies, antibodies are injected in a short window of time prior to nuclear envelope breakdown at a
time when the microtubules are extremely dynamic, so
the effects of the MCAK antibody inhibition are immediate and dramatic, and the cell has no time to invoke any
compensatory mechanism. In support of this idea, during
the optimization of our knockdown conditions in which
the knockdown of MCAK was less efficient (~70%), we

Page 7 of 15

BMC Cell Biology 2006, 7:26

did see more lagging chromosomes at anaphase in our
fixed analysis (data not shown). It could be that the lower
percentage knockdown of MCAK in these initial transfections did not initiate a second compensatory mechanism
and therefore more closely resembled the defects associated with MCAK antibody inhibition.
We also measured the timing of mitotic progression in
both the RNAi cells and in the antibody-injected cells
(Table 1). Previously we had shown that injection of the
dominant-negative MCAK, GFP-CEN, causes a delay in
prometaphase [40]. The knockdown of MCAK by RNAi in
our live analysis did not result in a significant increase in
the time between nuclear envelope breakdown and anaphase A onset, however MCAK antibody microinjection
did cause a prometaphase delay. These differences may
also be explained by the timing of the experiments in that
the antibodies are injected just prior to nuclear envelope
breakdown. In addition, it is important to note that while
the live analysis did not show a major defect in timing,
there were several individual live imaged cells that did
show a prometaphase delay, and the fixed analysis of cells
clearly showed an increase in the percentage of cells in
prometaphase, suggesting that with a larger population of
cells, such as our fixed analysis, the delay can be detected.
Overall, from our analysis of MCAK RNAi knockdown
phenotypes, we conclude that RNAi in PtK2 cells is an
effective tool to study the roles of mitotic proteins. Our
results with P-MCAK RNAi corroborate previous work
showing loss of MCAK leads to aberrant spindle formation as well as aberrant kinetochore-microtubule attachments that lead to improper chromosome congression
and missegregation of chromosomes during anaphase.
From these studies we also conclude that RNAi and antibody injection studies do give similar overall results, but
more subtle details may vary between the methods
because of the dramatic difference in the time-course of
the inhibition. We feel that these two approaches should
therefore be considered complementary rather than
strictly redundant.
Partial cDNA sequences can be used to develop SiRNAs
Because it is laborious to clone out full-length cDNAs, we
tested whether we could use RT-PCR to obtain a partial
cDNA sequence. We chose Eg5 as our test candidate
because it is present across a wide phylogeny of organisms
and its inhibition by antibody injection, immunodepletion, RNAi, small molecule inhibitors or genetic knockouts results in monopolar spindles in nearly every
organism [47-52]. Using RT-PCR, we were able to clone a
portion of the PtK Eg5 (P-Eg5) catalytic domain that was
93% identical to H-Eg5 protein and 87% identical to HEg5 DNA (Figure 4). Utilizing this information, we generated a 21 bp siRNA that was identical between P-Eg5 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/26

H-Eg5 (Figure 4) and used it for knockdown of Eg5 in
both PtK2 cells and HeLa cells. Whereas spindles in control cells were predominantly bipolar (Figure 5A, B, E),
knockdown of Eg5 in PtK2 cells (Figure 5C) or HeLa cells
(Figure 5F) caused an increase in cells with monopolar
spindles, similar to cells treated with monastrol, the small
molecule inhibitor of Eg5 (Figure 5D). Although we were
not able to determine the level of knockdown by immunoblotting because no antibodies gave sufficiently strong
signals on western blots of PtK2 cells, it was clear that any
bipolar spindles that formed still contained substantial
Eg5 staining, whereas all monopolar spindles had no or
extremely little residual Eg5 staining (Figure 5F). Thus the
percentage of monopolar structures formed after Eg5
knockdown is likely a good indicator of the effectiveness
of the knockdown. We found that in PtK2 cells, nearly
97% of control cells had bipolar spindles whereas >94%
of the structures formed in the absence of Eg5 were
monopolar compared to ~88% monopolar spindles when
treated with the Eg5 small molecule inhibitor (Figure 5G).
Similar to what was observed in PtK2 cells, inhibition of
Eg5 in HeLa cells also caused a dramatic increase in the
percentage of cells with monopolar spindles, ~97% with
both Eg5 RNAi and monastrol (Figure 5G). Both cell types
show an ~3-fold increase in the mitotic index after knockdown of Eg5 (Figure 5H), indicating that knockdown of
Eg5 induces a mitotic block in both cell types. HeLa cells
treated with control siRNA have a higher mitotic index
than PtK2 cells treated with control siRNA, so it is not necessarily surprising that the percentage increase of cells
blocked in mitosis is higher in HeLas. Together these
results show that the phenotypic consequence of Eg5
knockdown in PtK2 cells is comparable to that obtained
in HeLa cells or by utilization of a small molecule inhibitor.
In order to determine that efficient RNAi in PtK cells is not
limited to our PtK2 cell line, we repeated the Eg5 RNAi
knockdown in PtK1 cells, which are from the kidney of a
normal adult female Potorous tridactylis. Like PtK2 cells,
inhibition of Eg5 by either RNAi or monastrol treatment
also caused monopolar spindles with no or residual Eg5
staining in RNAi cells (data not shown). Nearly 97% of
the control cells had bipolar spindles compared to 84%
monopolar spindles in Eg5 RNAi PtK1 cells or the ~90%
in monastrol treated cells (Figure 5G). The mitotic index
also increased by more than 2-fold just as in PtK2 cells.
These results along with those above show that RNAi in
PtK cells is a viable method to study the function of
mitotic proteins in these morphologically advantageous
cells.

PtK cells, we chose 4 other genes from which to obtain
partial sequences as well as one other gene in which we
had a full-length cDNA (Tables 2 and 3). In each case, we
were able to obtain a cDNA sequence of ~350–2200 bp
that ranged in identity from 76–90% with human, mouse
or rat sequences (Table 2). There was no organism that
consistently had greater identity with the PtK sequences
than other organisms, suggesting that it is not advantageous to rely on one sequenced genome over another for
design of degenerate oligonucleotide primers. We next
investigated if it is routinely possible to utilize genomic
sequence from human, mouse or rat to generate mixtures
of siRNAs using for example RNAse III digestion of dsRNA
[53]. We analyzed how many 21 bp stretches were conserved between PtKs and other organisms (Table 2). Overall this number was very low ranging from 1 21 bp stretch
out of a 2166 bp gene to a high of 27 21 bp stretches out
of a 2040 bp gene. Most commonly the matches were in
the range of 1–3 21 bp stretches. These data show that the
most efficient approach is to use RT-PCR to isolate a small
stretch of sequence of the PtK gene and then use this
sequence to design siRNAs.

Conclusion
Here we have developed a method to use genomic information from other organisms with a sequenced genome
to knockdown protein levels in PtK cells. This will allow
us to systematically explore the roles of mitotic proteins
taking advantage of the excellent morphology and ease
with which live analysis of cellular dynamics can be performed in PtK cells. While our interest is in understanding
mitosis and PtK cells provide a model system to research
this process, the approach we outlined here should be
adaptable to any cell type regardless of the existence of a
sequenced genome. In addition, our data showing that
the efficiency of transfection between DNA and siRNAs
can be significantly different suggests that other cell types
that have been experimentally intractable to transfection

techniques may be able to be utilized for gene silencing by
siRNAs.

Methods
Cloning of P-MCAK and P-Eg5
A cDNA expression screen of a PtK1 cDNA library was carried out utilizing conventional methods [54]. An antibody raised against the N-terminus of X-MCAK [24] was
used as a probe in the screen. We screened 900,000
plaques and isolated a single full-length clone encoding PMCAK [GenBank: DQ444242]. To clone a portion of the
catalytic domain of P-Eg5, we generated degenerate oligonucleotides by aligning human, mouse, and rat sequences
encoding Eg5 and used these in RT-PCR reactions (Qiagen
one-step RT PCR kit) using total RNA isolated from PtK2
cells (Qiagen RNAeasy) as a template. The Eg5 fragments
were then subcloned into pEGFPC1 (Clontech) plasmid
and fully sequenced on both strands. Sequence analysis
was performed using Sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation), and the percent identity of fragments was calculated
using DNA Strider.
SiRNA transfections
PtK2 cells were plated at 15,000 – 20,000 cells/ml, and
PtK1 cells were plated at 20,000 – 25,000 cells/ml in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS 24 hrs before transfection onto coverslips in 6-well dishes and grown at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells
were then transfected with a non-fluorescently labelled 21
bp siRNA (Dharmacon) to P-MCAK (UGACUUUCUUUGAGAUCUA [dT] [dT]), or Eg5 (NNCAAGGAUGAAGUCUAUCAA), and either control oligo GFP
(GCAAGCUGACCCUGAAGUUCAU) or siCONTROL
Non-Targeting siRNA #2 to luciferase using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following their protocol with the

diluted in D-MEM/10% FBS, and 1 ml of siRNA/lipid
dilution was added to each well the day of transfection,
with an additional 1 ml/well of D-MEM/10% FBS added
24 hr post-transfection. Cells were examined at 48 hrs for
Eg5 and 72 hrs for MCAK post-transfection. These time
points were chosen after a qualitative analysis of the efficiency of knockdown by phenotypic analysis of spindle
morphology. To determine the efficiency of transfection,
cells were plated identically as above except that they were
transfected with siGlo Risc-free RNA (Dharmacon) and
then analyzed at 24–72 hrs post-transfection. No differences in the efficiency of transfection were observed by
determining the percentage of cells containing fluorescent
RNA. It should be noted that during our optimizations,
we found that silencing efficiency decreased with
increased number of passages beyond 6–8 weeks after
thawing the cells. For HeLa cell transfections of Eg5, cells
were plated at 5,000 – 6,000 cells/ml 24 hrs before transfection and then processed identically as described for PtK
cells except that cells were passaged and transfected in
Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and processed 24 hrs post transfection. For treatment with monastrol, both HeLa and PtK
cells were plated at the same density as for RNAi, grown
for either 24 hrs for HeLa cells or 48 hrs for PtK cells, at
which time the growth media was replaced with media
containing 100 μM monastrol, and the cells incubated for
a further 24 hrs. Monastrol treated cells were fixed and
stained identically to the Eg5 siRNA transfected cells.
Immunofluorescence
For Eg5 staining, HeLa cells or PtK cells were rinsed in PBS
(12 mM Phosphate, 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, pH 7.4)
and then fixed for 5' in -20°C MeOH. All subsequent
immunofluorescence-labelling procedures were performed at room temperature. Fixed cells were rinsed with
TBS-TX [TBS (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) + 0.1%
Triton X-100] and blocked in AbDil (2% BSA, 0.1% NaN3
in TBS-TX) for 30 min. All subsequent rinses between
antibody incubations were performed using TBS-TX, and
all antibodies were diluted in AbDil. Anti-H-Eg5 antibody
(1/500 dilution; Cytoskeleton) was incubated for 30' on
cells followed by incubation in 1/50 fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson
Immunologicals). For staining of microtubules, cells were

incubated for 30 min in DM1alpha (Sigma), 1/500 for
PtK cells and 1/1000 for HeLa cells, followed by a 30 min
incubation in 1/50 Texas Red-conjugated donkey antimouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunological).
DNA was visualized using 2 μg/ml Hoechst in TBS-TX for
5 min. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides
using 0.5% p-phenylenediamine, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.8) in
90% glycerol. For immunofluorescence of MCAK, cells
were fixed for 20 min in PHEM (60 mM Pipes, 25 mM
Hepes, 10 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0) supplemented with 2% formaldehyde. Cells were blocked in
AbDil for 30' and then incubated for 30 min in 5 μg/ml
anti-XMCAK-CT [25] followed by a 30 min incubation in
1/50 fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Jackson Immunologicals). For microtubule
staining after MCAK knockdown, cells were fixed and
processed as described for MCAK staining except that the
fix was supplemented with 4% formaldehyde and 0.1%
glutaraldehyde. Free aldehydes were quenched in TBS
plus trace NaBH4 for 5 min.
Microinjections and microscopy
Microinjections were performed essentially as described
previously [26]. Time-lapse analysis was performed 70–
87 hrs post-transfection using a Nikon TE-300 inverted
microscope and a 40x/0.60 numerical aperture Plan Fluor
objective (Nikon). Specimens were maintained at 36–
37.5°C by using a 400 ASI airstream incubator (Nevtek).
Phase contrast images were collected with a Cool Snap Cf
camera (Roper Scientific) at 30-s intervals at 100-ms exposure times, and all cameras, shutters, and filter wheels
were controlled by MetaMorph. Micrographs were assembled in Adobe Photoshop for identical contrast enhancement, and montages were prepared using Adobe
Illustrator. Movies were prepared in MetaMorph and converted to Quicktime format.

Fixed cells were imaged on a Nikon E-600 microscope
equipped with 40X/1.0 NA Plan Apo oil, 60X/1.4 NA Plan
Apo oil, and 100X/1.3 NA Plan Fluor oil objectives
(Nikon). Digital images were collected with either a
Micromax 1300 Y cooled CCD camera or a CoolSnap HQ
(Roper Scientific, Inc.). All cameras, shutters, and filter
wheels were controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecu-

lar Devices). Z-series optical sections through each cell
were obtained at 0.5 μm steps with the use of MetaMorph
software and a stepping motor (Prior Scientific Instrument). Images were then deconvolved (blind iterative
deconvolution) using AutoDeblur 9.3 software
(AutoQuant Imaging). All micrographs were assembled in
Adobe Photoshop CS for contrast enhancement, and
montages were prepared using Adobe Illustrator CS.
Immunoblotting
For determining the amount of protein knockdown by
immunoblotting, PtK2 cells were harvested by trypsinization at 72 hrs post-transfection, washed in PBS and then
counted. Equal numbers of cells (serially diluted) were
run on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The
blots were simultaneously probed with anti-XMCAK NT2
at 2 μg/ml in AbDil-T (made with 0.1% Tween-20 instead
of TX-100) and DM1alpha (1/5000), washed in TBST, followed by incubation in a mixture of 1/20000 of anti-rabbit and 1/20000 anti-mouse horse-radish peroxidase
secondary antibodies. The blots were washed and developed using Pierce SuperSignal WestPico ECL reagents.
Scanned images of the western were quantified using
ImageJ 1.34s v10.2 (NIH).
Quantification and analysis
Mitotic indices were calculated for both control and
experimental conditions by scoring mitotic versus interphase cells for 200–300 cells/per coverslip for a total of
600 cells and taking the percentage of mitotic cells per cell
total. To calculate the monopolar phenotype of Eg5, 100
mitotic cells between prometaphase and anaphase (when
there is normally a bipolar spindle in control cells) were
scored as either bipolar or monopolar spindles, and the
percentages for both control and experimental cells were
calculated. For MCAK RNAi analysis, 100 mitotic cells of
both control and MCAK RNAi cells were scored for
mitotic cell stage, and for monopolar spindles, for "hairy"
(excess microtubules) prometaphase cells, and for lagging
chromosomes in anaphase or telophase. The mean and
SEM for 3 or more experiments are reported. Significance
was considered if p < 0.5 as calculated by a paired t-test
using F-test two-sample to determine variance. For analysis of time-lapse movies, the movies were coded and then
scored blind by two individuals for presence or absence of
the described mitotic defects. Any discrepancies were then
scored blind by a third individual. All scores are reported
as the percentage of cells scored for each defect. Distance
measurements of spindle length were made using MetaMorph software. The spindle length was measured from
the time-lapse movie at the frame of anaphase A onset.
Measurements were collected in pixel number then converted to micrometers. All calculations for fixed and live
analyses were performed in Excel.
