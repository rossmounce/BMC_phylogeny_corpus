Abstract
Background: Microsatellites are the tandem repeats of nucleotide motifs of size 1–6 bp observed
in all known genomes. These repeats show length polymorphism characterized by either insertion
or deletion (indels) of the repeat units, which in and around the coding regions affect transcription
and translation of genes.
Results: Systematic comparison of all the equivalent microsatellites in the coding regions of the
three mycobacterial genomes, viz. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Mycobacterium tuberculosis
CDC1551 and Mycobacterium bovis, revealed for the first time the presence of several polymorphic
microsatellites. The coding regions affected by frame-shifts owing to microsatellite indels have
undergone changes indicative of gene fission/fusion, premature termination and length variation.
Interestingly, the genes affected by frame-shift mutations code for membrane proteins,
transporters, PPE, PE_PGRS, cell-wall synthesis proteins and hypothetical proteins.
Conclusion: This study has revealed the role of microsatellite indel mutations in imparting novel
functions and a certain degree of plasticity to the mycobacterial genomes. There seems to be some
correlation between microsatellite polymorphism and the variations in virulence, host-pathogen
interactions mediated by surface antigen variations, and adaptation of the pathogens. Several of the
polymorphic microsatellites reported in this study can be tested for their polymorphic nature by
screening clinical isolates and various mycobacterial strains, for establishing correlations between
microsatellite polymorphism and the phenotypic variations among these pathogens.

Background
Microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats,
are the short nucleotide segments comprising tandem
repeating motifs of length 1–6 bp [1]. They are present in
all genomes known to date [2-4], and are known to be
polymorphic [5]characterized by high rates of indels of

repeat units [1]. Microsatellites provide a framework for
crucial genetic rearrangements with their reversible frameshift mutations that can confer a certain degree of selective
advantage on pathogenic bacteria. Microsatellite mutations are known to affect expression levels [6], switching
on/off of genes [6] and even alteration of gene functions

[7]. The primary cause of microsatellite polymorphism is
thought to be strand slippage during DNA replication [8].
Usually errors owing to strand slippage are repaired by a
three-enzyme system comprising the enzymes mutL,
mutS and mutH. However, some genomes like those of
the mycobacterial species lack these enzymes [9]. Hence,
such genomes serve as interesting systems to investigate
the rates of mutations in microsatellites and the existence
of regulatory mechanisms that govern microsatellite
mutations. Furthermore, these genomes present challenging and exciting systems to understand the role of microsatellite mutations in conferring genome plasticity, and in
aiding the pathogens in their adaptation and evolution.
Previous reports on genomic changes in M. tuberculosis,
were mainly concerned with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and large-sequence polymorphisms
(LSPs) (>10 bp) [10]. While the involvement of SNPs in
drug resistance has been shown [11], most of the LSPs are
thought to be deleterious [12]. In the present study, we
show for the first time that the coding regions of the three
genomes of mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis H37Rv [13], M.
tuberculosis CDC1551 [10] and M. bovis [14]) harbor a
number of polymorphic microsatellite loci associated
with remarkable changes in the coding regions.

Results and discussion
All the three mycobacterial genomes, M. tuberculosis
H37Rv (MTH), M. tuberculosis CDC1551 (MTC) and M.
bovis (MB) harbor about a million microsatellite tracts
each, comprising of mono to hexa repeats (Sreenu, Pankaj
Kumar, Nagaraju and Nagarajaram, manuscript communicated). Systematic comparison of all the equivalent microsatellites and the equivalent coding regions harboring
them, in all the three genomes revealed several examples
of microsatellites exhibiting length polymorphism characterized by indels of the repeat units. Frame-shifts in the
coding regions owing to indels in microsatellites, were
also observed. While some frame-shifts caused ORFs to
split (fission) (see methods), others seemed to bring
about fusion of two adjacent ORFs (with or without overlap) giving rise to a single ORF. Our study also revealed
several ORFs eliminated as a result of premature termination by stop codons, and numerous other ORFs exhibiting
length changes (Fig. 1). The complete list of polymorphic
microsatellites along with the ORFs in which they are
present is given in Table 1 (see Additional File 1 for details
of the tracts, microsatellite polymorphism and outcomes). Illustrated below are some examples of microsatellites and their polymorphic effects on the coding
regions.
In the MTH genome, two ORFs annotated as gmhA
(Rv0113) and gmhB (Rv0114) have been identified as
sedoheptulose-7-phosphate isomerase and D-α-β-D-hep-

tose-7-biphosphate phosphatase, respectively (the TB
structural genomics consortium [15]). These enzymes are
known to be involved in the biosynthesis pathway of
nucleotide activated glycerol-manno-heptose precursors
of bacterial glycoproteins and cell surface polysaccharides
[16]. Our study indicates that the ORF Rv0113 annotated
as gmhA harbors the microsatellite (T)4 in MTH,while it
is expanded to (T)5in the MTC genome. This expansion
has resulted in a frame-shift owing to which the reading
frame extends and fuses with that of the gmhB, thus giving
rise to a fused ORF. Although it is hard to speculate the
possible roles of the gmhA-gmhB fused protein in MTC,
there exists a high probability of it forming a bi-functional
protein with two domains.
Similarly, two adjacent ORFs viz., Rv0192A and Rv0192
in the MTH genome are observed to have fused into a single ORF (Mb0198) in the MB genome, owing to a frameshift caused by the expansion of the microsatellite (G)4 to
(G)5. Previous PhoA fusion screening studies have shown
Rv0192A in MTH to act as a signal peptide [17], and in
light of this it is reasonable to speculate the fused gene
product in MB to be a secretory protein that may act as a
surface antigen.
The ORF MT1966 in MTC encoding a functional isocitrate
lyase [18], is observed to have split into two ORFs
(Rv1915 and Rv1916) in MTH due to a single nucleotide
deletion in the mononucleotide tract (T)5. The failure of
these two ORFs to complement isocitrate lyase activity in
MTH has been demonstrated [19]. Immunoblotting studies were unable to detect AceAa or AceAb products [18].
Subsequent studies by Betts and co-workers (2002) enabled detection of only the mRNA of AceAa, indicating the
lack of expression of AceAb [20]. It is interesting to note
that both the MTC and MTH genomes possess another
copy of isocitrate lyase. This indicates the existence of two

we have followed a consensus approach where the observed event being a case of insertion or deletion of a repeat, is decided by the
number of genomes in which the repeat number is conserved (given in bold text). For example, G4↔5 denotes that two of the
genomes possess the tract G4 while in the third genome it exists as G5, and therefore it is regarded as an event of insertion leading to
microsatellite expansion. Accordingly, the effect (fusion/fission, premature termination, length variation) on the coding region is also

functional copies of the enzyme in MTC, and only a single
copy in MTH. In MTC the activity of isocitrate lyase
increases during the latent phase when the pathogen utilizes lipid as the energy source [21]. Redundancy in isocitrate lyase in MTC can therefore be beneficial to the
pathogen, providing a greater chance of its survival in the
host cell debris where lipid is used as a carbon source.
However, in MTH which is cultured under laboratory conditions with no dependence on lipids as the carbon
source, the duplication of the isocitrate lyase enzyme is
not required. Therefore, the removal of one copy of the
enzyme in MTH may not pose as a constraint for the
growth of the pathogen.
On comparison, the highest number (18 ORFs) of split
events is observed in the MB genome (Table 1). The
expression of both parts of split genes in the MB genome,
imply a favorable situation for versatile protein-protein
interactions. However, it is to be noted in the cases of split
ORF, the expression of the second part of the ORF is
entirely dependent on the availability of regulatory signals
(Shine-Dalgarno sequence) for that ORF. In the absence
of a regulatory mechanism, the second part of the ORF is
unexpressed. As given in Table 1, section III, the second
part of all the four examples, has been annotated as psuedogene because of the absence of the Shine-Dalgarno
sequence. If both the parts of the split ORFs are expressing
the split subunits can act together [22,23] or in isolation
resulting in different protein-protein interactions, that can
be instrumental in the creation of alternate/new pathways, which in turn may eventually render greater adaptation mechanisms to the bacteria. This may well be the one
of the underlying reasons for MB to have a wider host
range as compared to M. tuberculosis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/78

than the wild-type, in the severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mouse model [28]. However, it is difficult
to categorically stress the importance of umaA1 in the virulence of the pathogen. This is because MTC has been
shown to be less virulent in the immunocompetent mice
as compared to other clinical isolates [29]. Study on an
umaA1 deletion mutant of MTH in immunocompetent
mice would provide clues to the role of umaA1 in virulence. In addition, it is equally possible for the other prematurely terminated ORFs to also be responsible for the
less virulent nature of MTC. However, such correlations
require further studies.
We also observe an appreciable number of ORFs (43
examples) in all the three genomes exhibiting length variations due to indels of repeat units in microsatellites.
Many proteins in this category have been annotated as
hypothetical proteins, PPE and mammalian cell entry
(mce) family virulence proteins. While the length variation in some ORFs produce no effect on the function of
the translated protein with the functional domains being
well conserved; in others, drastic changes are observed.
For example, Rv2732c in MTH as well as Mb2791c in MB
code for a membrane anchoring protein of length 204aa.
The equivalent ORF MT2802.1 in MTC is a shorter ORF
encoding only 180aa, owing to a frame-shift caused by a
single G insertion in the microsatellite tract (G)2. In silico
analysis of these proteins, reveals a greater probability
(0.959) of the N-terminal deleted short protein in MTC to
act as a signal peptide and secrete outside, than its longer
counterparts in MB and MTH that possess negligible propensities of being signal peptides and therefore for external secretion.

The split ORFs encode membrane proteins, transporters,
PE_PGRS, cell-wall synthesis proteins and hypothetical
proteins. The membrane proteins are known to play an
important role in host-pathogen interactions [24]. The
majority of bacteria are thought to modify their membrane protein structures in order to escape the host
immune defense system and promote colonization at various places within the host [6,24]. The PE-PGRS proteins
are specific to mycobacteria and are speculated to function as surface antigens [25,26]. Truncation with respect
to the second part can potentially give rise to an antigenic
variant.

Although the primary focus of this communication is on
microsatellite polymorphism in the coding regions, we
have also examined the upstream promoter regions of the
ORFs and obtained some ORFs harboring polymorphic
microsatellites (data not shown). It should be noted that
genes are located very close to each other in a prokaryotic
genome; at times without any long intergenic region
between two adjacent genes. It is probable that the coding
sequence of a gene may act as a regulatory sequence for its
neighboring genes. In addition to bringing about changes
in the coding regions, the observed microsatellite variations may also influence regulation of regions downstream of coding sequences.

MTC as compared to the other genomes exhibits a greater
number of cases of premature terminations (10 ORFs)
(Table 1), confined to the PE_PGRS, umaA1, pks5 and
some hypothetical proteins. Of these, the ORF umaA1
codes for a mycolic acid methyl transferase that modifies
the lipids of the mycobacterial cell wall [27]. The umaA1
deletion mutant of MTH is observed to be more virulent

We have referred the Stanford microarray database [30],
Tuberculist [31], ArrayExpress [32] and available literature
on microarray analysis of mycobacterium [20,33-37] for
the expression profiles of all ORFs of MTH listed in Table
1. Almost 85% of the ORFs (indicated by * in the table)
display high expression profiles, including those that have
undergone fission. However, further studies are necessary

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:78

to verify and complement the function of these split gene
products with their cognate wild-type/unsplit proteins.
It is evident from Table 1 that microsatellites with as few
as two repeats display polymorphism (i.e., indels of their
repeat units). This appears to contradict earlier observations of the requirement of a microsatellite length threshold for repeat expansions or contractions due to strand
slippage [38,39]. Our study therefore indicates the nondependence of strand slippage on microsatellite tract
lengths. However, one should bear in mind the possibility
of random mutational events leading to the observed
length variation in microsatellites. For example, the
genomes of M. canetti and M. tuberculosis contain the
(GGGCCGC)2 tract in the ORF that encodes for pks15/1.
However, the equivalent regions in the MTC and MTH
genomes have a 7 bp deletion of (GGGCCGC) and in the
MB genome a 6 bp deletion of (GGCCGC) [40]. Although
the deletion events are independent, the resultant
sequences when compared give an impression of the G
tract expansion. Alternatively, it can be argued that all
three genomes MB, MTC and MTH may have possessed an
initial 7 bp deletion (GGGCCGC) similar to M. canetti,
giving rise to the microsatellite tract (G)5 that may have
subsequently expanded to (G)6 in MB. It is still unclear as
to which of the models depict the correct picture of events
for the observed microsatellite polymorphism. This is
largely because of the unavailability of detailed evolutionary information of the mycobacterial pathogen. Although
M. canetti is believed to be the root from which the other
mycobacterial strains evolved, a clear understanding of
the evolutionary relationship between M. tuberculosis and
M. bovis is absent [41-44]. Owing to this, it is difficult to
put forward precisely the path of microsatellite evolution,
although several possibilities can be suggested.
The rate at which microsatellites mutate is much higher
than the single-base substitutions [45,46], therefore
greater variations are expected in the polymorphic loci
than other regions of the genomes. Though mycobacterial
genomes are enriched with microsatellite tracts (Sreenu,
Pankaj, Nagaraju and Nagarajaram, manuscript communicated), surprisingly there is yet no report available on
the microsatellite mediated phase variation in these bacteria. The majority of microsatellite mediated phase variations reported in pathogenic bacteria are changes in the
pili [47,48], capsule [49,50] and flagella [51,52] and the
mycobacteria do not possess any of these structures.
According to Hallet, phase variation is "an adaptive process through which bacteria undergo frequent and reversible phenotypic changes resulting in genetic alterations in
their genomes" [53]. In light of this point it is highly interesting that this work presents several polymorphic microsatellite loci that seem to have been evolutionarily
'selected' and are involved in bringing about phenotypic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/78

alterations in the coding regions namely, antigenic variation, virulence and modified host-pathogen interactions
for presumably better adaptation of the pathogen.
It is tempting to speculate that some of the polymorphic
microsatellites discovered in this study are those that have
undergone mutations at some point of time during
microbe evolution, perhaps during speciation, and thereafter remained frozen as the 'molecular fossils'. If this
model is correct, then such tracts can be used as markers
for species/strain identification. In any case all the loci
form a good starting set to screen several isolates and
strains. This would enable to study correlation between
microsatellite polymorphism and the observed phenotypic variations among different isolates and strains.
An important point to be noted in connection with microsatellite polymorphism in the mycobacterial genomes is
the absence of the post replicative DNA mismatch repair
system mediated by mutS, mutL and mutH genes [9].
Impairment of these enzymes destabilizes mono, di and
trinucleotide repeats [54]. This probably accounts for the
prevalence of mono and dinucleotide microsatellite variations in mycobacterial genomes. Moreover, the absence
of these enzymes appears advantageous to these pathogens, resulting in the generation of polymorphic microsatellites, thereby imparting a certain degree of plasticity to
the genomes. However, the total number of microsatellites that exhibit polymorphism, and their significance in
the context of pathogen adaptability, virulence and survival remains to be tested.

Conclusion
The coding regions in the mycobacterial genomes, viz. M.
tuberculosis H37Rv, M. tuberculosis CDC1551 and M. bovis,
harbor a number of polymorphic microsatellites. The
observed indel mutations in microsatellites have brought
out some interesting changes in the coding regions indicative of gene fusion/fission, loss, and functional variation.
From this study, it can be concluded that microsatellites
form an important set of genomic elements, mutations of
which are beneficial to the pathogens.

Methods
Complete genome sequences of M. tuberculosis (H37Rv
and CDC1551) and M. bovis were downloaded from the
NCBI ftp site [55]. Functional annotations of the coding
regions were referred to the Tuberculist website [31] and
the TB structural genomics consortium site [15]. The various microsatellites in the three genomes were identified
using SSRF [56]. SSRF scans a given nucleotide sequence
and extracts all microsatellite tracts of motif length 1–6
bp. The extracted information includes genomic location
of the tracts, repeating motifs, repeat numbers and regions
(coding or non-coding or partial) in which the tracts are

present. The program utilizes the GenBank annotation file
"xxx.ffn" (where xxx = genome name) that has exon
boundary information, using which the location of microsatellites relative to the protein coding regions is subsequently recorded. In addition the internal motif
redundancy is taken care of; where a sequence of the type
(AAAAGCAAAAGCAAAAGC)
is
represented
as
(AAAAGC)3 with the internal "A"s (AAAAGC) not considered as a separate (A)4 tract.
The ORFs harboring microsatellites of one genome were
used as queries to search against the other two complete
mycobacterial genome sequences using the BLASTN program (version 2.2.6) [57] without the repeat masking filter. The alignment hits with queried sequences
comprising only indels in the microsatellites were selected
for further analysis. The Tuberculist database (for H37Rv
and M. bovis) and the NCBI (for CDC1551) were checked
and confirmed to ensure that the indels in microsatellites
especially those of the mononucleotide tracts were indeed
authentic mutations and not the results of sequencing
errors (however one can not rule out some remote possibility of sequencing artifact). Subsequently, the ORFs and
their equivalent sequences were realigned using CLUSTALW [58] to reconfirm the alignment as well as the
INDELS in the microsatellites. As the phylogenetic relation of these genomes is still ambiguous, a consensus of
the three genomes for microsatellite categorization into
premature terminations, gene fusion/fission and ORF premature termination was used.
