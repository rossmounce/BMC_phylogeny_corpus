Abstract
Background: Analysis of molecular evolutionary patterns of different genes within metabolic
pathways allows us to determine whether these genes are subject to equivalent evolutionary forces
and how natural selection shapes the evolution of proteins in an interacting system. Although
previous studies found that upstream genes in the pathway evolved more slowly than downstream
genes, the correlation between evolutionary rate and position of the genes in metabolic pathways
as well as its implications in molecular evolution are still less understood.
Results: We sequenced and characterized 7 core structural genes of the gibberellin biosynthetic
pathway from 8 representative species of the rice tribe (Oryzeae) to address alternative
hypotheses regarding evolutionary rates and patterns of metabolic pathway genes. We have
detected significant rate heterogeneity among 7 GA pathway genes for both synonymous and
nonsynonymous sites. Such rate variation is mostly likely attributed to differences of selection
intensity rather than differential mutation pressures on the genes. Unlike previous argument that
downstream genes in metabolic pathways would evolve more slowly than upstream genes, the
downstream genes in the GA pathway did not exhibited the elevated substitution rate and instead,
the genes that encode either the enzyme at the branch point (GA20ox) or enzymes catalyzing
multiple steps (KO, KAO and GA3ox) in the pathway had the lowest evolutionary rates due to
strong purifying selection. Our branch and codon models failed to detect signature of positive
selection for any lineage and codon of the GA pathway genes.
Conclusion: This study suggests that significant heterogeneity of evolutionary rate of the GA
pathway genes is mainly ascribed to differential constraint relaxation rather than the positive
selection and supports the pathway flux theory that predicts that natural selection primarily targets
enzymes that have the greatest control on fluxes.

Background
A primary goal of molecular evolutionary studies is to elucidate the driving forces governing evolutionary change
and mechanisms of molecular evolution. A general pattern arising from previous studies is that genes or proteins
varied substantially in their evolutionary rates, spanning

more than 3 orders of magnitude [1-4]. Although many
determinants, including functional, biophysical, and fitness-related variables [3,5,6], have been proposed to
explain such variation, what determines the evolutionary
rate of a protein has been debated for decades and
remains largely elusive despite some large-scale investiga-

tions [4,7,8]. One possible reason for this is that many
studies have focused on protein interaction networks that
are very heterogeneous with different types of interactions
[5,8]. False correlations in protein interaction networks
and noise in biological data further complicate the analyses of protein evolution [4,6]. To study evolutionary rates
and patterns of proteins in well-characterized metabolic
networks or pathways has thus become an alternative for
understanding of molecular evolution [9-15].
Analysis of molecular evolutionary patterns of different
genes within metabolic pathways allows us to determine
whether these genes are subject to equivalent evolutionary
forces and how natural selection shapes the evolution of
proteins in an interacting system. In studies of evolutionary rates of genes in the plant anthocyanin pathway,
Rausher et al. [11] and Lu and Rausher [13] demonstrated
that upstream genes in the pathway evolved more slowly
than downstream genes both over a broad taxonomic distance involving monocots and dicots and at the intragenic
level between species within a genus. They suggested that
such difference in evolutionary rates between upstream
and downstream genes was due to more constraint upon
the upstream genes because they participated in several
different biochemical pathways. The hypothesis that earlier acting genes in genetic pathways are under strong
purifying selection has been confirmed by some studies
(e.g., [9,16]) but not been supported by the others (e.g.,
[12] and see [17]).
Another hypothesis regarding protein evolution involves
a theory of pathway fluxes, indicates that natural selection
would target enzymes that control metabolic fluxes and
thus where selection operates in a pathway will depend on
the distribution of flux control among pathway genes
[17,18]. It has been suggested that pathway branch points
are usually the targets of selection because they might control the expression of biochemical phenotypes disproportionately [10,14,18]. A third alternative hypothesis argued
that translational selection and selection for protein folding and design might govern the rate of protein sequence
evolution [7,19-21]. Despite these arguments and some
other attempts [4,5,8,22], empirical studies with specific
metabolic networks or pathways remain limited, particularly for plants.
Gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic pathway is involved in the
production of gibberellins that control many aspects of
plant growth and development, including seed germination, stem elongation, leaf expansion, and flower and seed
development [23,24]. Despite a hundred GAs identified
from plants, a small number of them such as GA1 and GA4
are found to function as bioactive hormones. These bioactive GAs are synthesized from trans-geranylgeranyl
diphosphate (GGDP) through the 12-step conversion

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/206

(Figure 1). To date 7 enzymes have been identified to be
responsible for GA biosynthesis and function in multiple
locations within the cell, involving the chloroplast, the ER
membrane, and the cytoplasm. These 7 enzymes can be
divided into 2 groups, i.e., the enzymes catalyzing early
steps: ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), ent-kaurene synthase (KS), ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), and entkaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) and those for later steps:
GA20-oxidase (GA20ox), GA3-oxidase (GA3ox), and
GA2-oxidase (GA2ox) (Figure 1) [23]. In addition to a
well-defined pathway, almost all of the genes encoding
the 7 metabolic enzymes and their related mutants have
been isolated and identified [23,24]. Therefore, the GA
biosynthetic pathway provides an excellent system for
exploring the correlation between evolutionary rate and
position of the genes in metabolic pathways as well as its
implications in molecular evolution. In addition, the GA
biosynthetic pathway is also a good system to investigate
the relative importance of selective constraint and positive
selection as well as how adaptive variation is distributed
among proteins in metabolic pathways. In this study, we
isolated and sequenced portions of the 7 GA pathway
genes from representative species of the rice tribe and analyzed their rates and patterns of molecular evolution. Our
specific goals were 1) to compare evolutionary rates across
the GA pathway genes and ask if evolutionary rate of the
genes depends on its function or gene's position within
the pathway; 2) to examine whether the GA pathway
genes exhibit evidence of positive selection and particularly to understand the relative contribution of selective
constraint and positive selection to variation of evolutionary rates of the GA pathway genes.

Methods
Plant materials and genes analyzed
We isolated and sequenced portions of all 7 GA pathway
genes from members of the rice tribe (Oryzeae). Phylogeny of the rice tribe has been well resolved by previous
studies based on sequences of plastid, mitochondrial and
nuclear genes [25,26] and provided an important framework for molecular evolution study for this group (Additional file 1). To analyze the patterns of molecular
evolution of the GA pathway genes, 8 diploid species were
selected to represent major phylogenetic lineages of
Oryzeae that are separated by a range of genetic distances
[26]. They consisted of 5 Oryza species representing 5 diploid genome types, Oryza sativa (A), O. officinalis (C), O.
australiensis (E), O. brachyantha (F), O. granulata (G), and
one each of other 3 genera in the tribe (Chikusichloa aquatica, Luziola leiocarpa, and Rhynchoryza subulata). One species in the tribe Ehrhartoideae that is sister to Oryzeae,
Ehrharta erecta, was used as an outgroup [26,27].

Of 7 enzymes in the GA biosynthetic pathway, 4 enzymes
in the early steps (CPS, KS, KO and KAO) were encoded

by single-copy genes (CPS1, KS1, KO2 and KAO) [23] and
sampled in this study. Because the 3 enzymes in the later
steps (GA20ox, GA3ox and GA2ox) were encoded by
small gene families [23,24], we chose to sequence
GA20ox2, GA3ox2 and GA2ox4 that were highly expressed
in all organs of the wild-type rice [23]. Previous studies
showed that mutants with all 7 enzymes except for GA2ox
exhibited a typical phenotype of dwarfism, indicating the
functional importance of these enzymes in GA biosynthesis [23]. Detailed information of the genes and the
sequences and positions of the primers are listed in table
1 and Additional file 2, respectively. Species sampled and
the GenBank accession numbers of the sequences
obtained in this study are listed in Additional files 3 and
4, respectively.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
Total DNA was isolated from silica-gel dried or fresh
leaves using the method as described by Ge et al. [25].
Because the DNA fragments of each gene contained multiple exons and introns, additional internal primers were
used for sequencing of four genes (CPS1, KS1, KO2 and
KAO) that were about 2 kb in length. Their sequences and

melting temperatures (Tm) are provided in Additional file
5. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in a
total volume of 25 l which contained 5–50 ng of template DNA, 0.2 M of each primer, 200 M of each dNTP,
10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and
0.75 U ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan).
Amplification was carried out in a T gradient 96 U thermocycler (Biometre, Göttingen, Germany) as follows: 3
min at 94°C, followed by 33 cycles of 30 ~ 35 s at 94°C,
30 ~ 35 s at 54°C ~ 58°C, 2 min 30 s at 72°C and a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min (CPS1, KS1, KO2, and
KAO). Because GC contents of GA20ox2, GA3ox2 and
GA2ox4 were as high as about 70%, routine PCR amplification did not work well. We performed the amplification
using LA Taq DNA polymerase, special GC Buffer I and
dNTP Mixture (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). Except for annealing temperature at 60°C, the protocol was basically similar to the above protocol. All PCR products were separated
by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels stained with
ethidium bromide. After purification using DNA Purification kit, most of amplification products were sequenced
directly. For those PCR products that were weakly amplified and difficult to be sequenced directly, we used the

have been deposited in GenBank, and their accession
numbers are EF577637 ~ EF577669, EU179376 ~
EU179435 (Additional file 4).
Sequence analyses
Sequences were translated into the predicted amino acid
sequence and aligned using ClustalX with version 1.81
[28], followed by manual adjustment. Excluding intron
regions, the stretches of amino acid residues were conserved well enough across eight species to perform unambiguous alignments. The possibility of sequence
saturation was examined using DAMBE 4.5.45 [29]. A plot
of the number of transitions and transversions vs. divergence offers a visual display of substitution saturation,
with an asymptotic relationship indicating the presence of
saturation [29]. Pairwise number of synonymous and
nonsynonymous substitutions per site (dS and dN) as well
as nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio
(dN/dS) between the eight species were calculated for the
coding regions of all 7 genes using the improved approximate method of Yang and Nielsen [30], implemented in
YN00 (CODEML) of PAML version 4 [31]. This method

considers two important evolutionary features of DNA
sequence: transition/transversion rate bias and codon frequency bias. Based on the pruned phylogenetic tree of the
eight species (Additional file 6), we also estimated the dN/
dS value of each gene using CODEML of the PAML version
4 [31].
The magnitude of codon bias is often used to reflect the
degree of selective constraint in a gene and variation of
synonymous substitution rates among genes may be
related to codon usage [32,33]. To measure the extent of
codon usage bias, we estimated effective number of
codons (ENC) using DnaSP version 4.10.9 [34], which
varies between 20 and 61, with the lower the value, the
more biased codon usage [35].
Comparing dS and dN among genes
The pairwise synonymous and nonsynonymous genetic
distances of 8 species were calculated for each gene using
the method of Yang and Nielsen [30]. Of total 28 species
pairs, we chose 15 species pairs involving 5 Oryza species
and other three representatives of the rice tribe to represent maximum divergence time (20 myr, Additional file
1). To evaluate the reliability of estimated genetic distances of the 15 pairs, we checked the distance variance of
each pair of the genes and found that the pairs involving

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:206

O. sativa or O. brachyantha have high variance for GA20ox,
GA3ox and GA2ox. Thus six species pairs involving either
of the two species were excluded. Based on the rest 9 species pairs (O. officinalis vs. C. aquatica, O. officinalis vs. L.
leiocarpa, O. officinalis vs. R. subulata, O. australiensis vs. C.
aquatica, O. australiensis vs. L. leiocarpa, O. australiensis vs.
R. subulata, O. granulata vs. C. aquatica, O. granulata vs. L.
leiocarpa, and O. granulata vs. R. subulata), the mean distance and its standard error of each gene were calculated
to show variation of dS, dN among genes. To compare dS
and dN among genes, we calculated the dS and dN for each
branch of the pruned tree of the six species (Additional
file 1 and Additional file 6) using CODEML of the PAML
version 4 [31]. Of the tree, there are total 10 evolutionary
independent branches (Additional file 6). Two data matrices for seven genes were obtained for dS and dN, respectively. We used two approaches to detect whether
evolutionary rates differed among the genes. First, we used
multiple range test and Fisher's least significant difference
(LSD) procedure to discriminate the means of the genetic
distances of 9 species pairs among 7 genes. To compare dS
and dN among genes, we calculated the dS and dN for each
branch of the pruned tree including six species (Additional file 6) using CODEML of the PAML version 4 [31].
On the tree, there are 10 evolutionarily independent
branches (Additional file 6). Then we used Wilcoxon
signed rank test [36] in the pairwise comparisons of distances of the 10 branches between genes to test significant
difference among the GA genes.
Comparing dN/dS among genes
Pairwise dN/dS ratios of 8 species were estimated for each
gene using the method of Yang and Nielsen [30]. The
mean dN/dS ratios of 9 species pairs and standard errors
were calculated to show variation of dN/dS among genes.
We used a method described by Lu and Rausher [13] to
compare dN/dSratios for the seven genes. For this analysis,
we first estimated a single value of dN/dS for each gene
using the model M0 of by CODEML of PAML version 4
[31]. We then detected the significance of differences of
dN/dS values between genes by comparing the likelihood
of the model using the estimated value of dN/dS to the likelihoods of the same model and using dN/dS constrained to
various values [13].
Detection of positive selection
The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution
rate ( = dN/dS) provides an effective measure to detect
selection or selective pressure on a gene or gene region,
with  < 1, = 1, and > 1 indicating purifying selection,
neutral evolution, and positive selection, respectively
[31,37]. We performed likelihood-based analyses using
the CODEML program of PAML version 4 [31] to explore
the selective processes acting on the GA biosynthetic
genes. First, we tested whether the evolutionary rates of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/206

each gene in the pathway differed among lineages within
the gene tree by using the branch models. The one ratio
model (M0) assumes a single  for all branches and all
sites, whereas the free ratio model (Mf) assumes an independent  ratio for each branch of the tree. A likelihood
ratio test (LRT) was conducted to determine whether there
was statistically significant difference between two models. If the LRT is significant, the null hypothesis that two
models are not significantly different is rejected, and the
model with higher likelihood value is assumed to be a
better model [38,39].
We next used site-specific models to examine whether particular amino acid residues were subject to positive selection because the branch test often has little power to
detect positive selection due to the fact that the  ratio is
seldom detected greater than 1 if all the sites are averaged
[40]. The nested codon models [39,40] were performed
for each gene separately. In addition to one ratio model
(M0), the neutral model (M1a) classifies all the sites into
2 categories, one under strict constraint (0 <  < 1) (purifying selection) and the other under neutral ( = 1). Positive selection model (M2a) is based on M1a and assumes
a third category under positive selection ( > 1). Beta
model (M7) assumes a beta distribution of the  ratios,
and beta& model (M8) extends an independent ratio
estimated by the data. Models assuming positive selection
M8 and M2a are compared with null models M7 and
M1a, respectively. Positive selection is invoked if the LRT
is significant and there is site with  > 1 [39,40].

Results
Sequences of the 7 GA pathway genes were isolated from
all sampled Oryzeae species and an outgroup, Ehrharta
erecta. The sequenced regions of the 7 genes ranged from
699 bp to 2231 bp in rice and their aligned coding regions
varied between 597 bp and 1053 bp for species used in
this study (table 1 and Additional file 4). The GC contents
for the total and 3 individual codon positions were similar for the same gene across species but varied greatly
among genes, with the means ranging from 0.426 (KS1)
to 0.714 (GA20ox2) (table 1 and Additional file 4). It is
noted that GC contents of the 3 genes at the later steps
were much higher than those of the 4 genes at the early
steps in the pathway, particularly at the 3rd position
(GC3) where the averages were 0.926 ~ 0.966 for the
genes at the later steps in contrast to the values of 0.417 ~
0.82 for the genes at the early steps (table 1 and Additional file 4). To estimate accurately and compare substitution rate and  ratios of different GA pathway genes, we
evaluated sequence saturation of substitution for each of
the seven genes. Results of saturation plots did not reveal
any mutational saturation for all the seven GA genes, indicating that the datasets were suitable for further analyses
of the differences of substitution rate and  ratios.

Comparing dN and dS among genes
The averages of dS and dN of the 9 species pairs for each
gene were shown in Figure 2 and table 2. Both dS and dN
values varied greatly among genes, with the highest dS
(0.747 for GA2ox4) being 3.5 times the lowest (0.214 for
KS1) and the highest dN (0.086 for KS1) being 5.9 times
the lowest (0.015 for GA20ox2). For dS, the 3 genes in the
early steps of the pathway (CPS1, KS1 and KO2) have significantly lower dS values than KAO and 3 genes at the
later steps of the pathway (GA20ox2, GA3ox2 and
GA2ox4). For dN, GA20ox2 has the lowest value (0.015),
followed by 4 genes (KO2, GA3ox2, CPS1, and KAO), and
the second and last genes in the pathway, KS1 and
GA2ox4, have the highest and comparable dN value (0.086
and 0.087). Unlike dS values, dN varied significantly both
between and within genes in the early and late steps of the
pathway. It is noted that 2 types of substitutions did not
correlated (r2 = 0.009, P = 0.840), which is clearly reflected

by the fact that KS1 had a highest dN value but the lowest
dS (Figure 2 and table 2). Multiple range tests generated 2
and 3 homogenous groups of genes for dS and dN, respectively, with statistically significant difference between
genes among groups and non-significant difference
between genes within groups (table 2). To overcome the
rate heterogeneity of dS and dN among lineages, we performed the Wilcoxon signed rank test for pairwise comparisons of dS and dN between genes for 10 independent
branch of pruned tree consisting of 6 species. For dS, the
gene KAO and three late-step genes (GA20ox2, GA3ox2,
GA2ox4) showed significant rate differences from the first
3 genes in the pathway (CPS1, KS1 and KO2) (P < 0.01).
No significant difference was detected between KAO and
the late-step genes and among the early-step genes. For dN,
none of the tests showed significant difference, involving
the comparisons between and within both early- and latestep genes (table 2 and Additional file 7).
Comparing dN/dS among genes
The dN/dS ratios of the 9 species pairs varied remarkably
among the 7 genes, with the highest value (0.420 for KS1)
being 15.6 times the lowest (0.027 for GA20ox2) (Figure
2 and table 2). We compared dN/dS ratios for the 7 genes
and detected the significance of differences between genes
using the method of Lu and Rausher [13]. The dN/dS value
for each gene ranged from 0.386 (KS1) to 0.022
(GA20ox2) with a trend similar to that estimated by pairwise dN/dS ratios (table 2). Based on log-likelihood ratio
comparisons, we found 4 homogenous groups, i.e., A
(GA20ox2), B (KAO and GA3ox2), C (KO2, CPS1, and
GA2ox4), and D (KS1). As shown in table 3, significant
difference of dN/dS ratios is found between genes from different groups but not found between genes from the same
groups. The results are similar to those obtained by multiple range test and Wilcoxon signed rank test, with the
exception that KO2 and CPS1 were in the same group in
log-likelihood ratio comparisons (table 3).

Codon usage bias and its correlation with GC3 and
substitution rates
Estimates of the codon usage indicated that the ENC for
the same gene was similar across all species (2 test, P =
1.00) (Additional file 4), suggesting that the magnitude of
codon bias underwent little change during the diversification of the rice tribe. However, substantial variation was
found among genes in the degree of codon bias, with the
means of ENC ranging from 30.1 (GA20ox2) to 58.2
(KO2) (table 1 and Additional file 4). Pairwise comparisons of one-way ANOVA found that differences of the
ENC were significant for all pairwise comparisons (P <
0.001) except for CPS1 vs. KS1 (P = 0.090) and GA20ox2
vs. GA3ox2 (P = 0.386). Note that the 3 genes in the late
steps (GA20ox2, GA3ox2, and GA2ox4) exhibited strong

genes in the early steps (CPS1, KS1 and KO2) possessed
little codon usage bias (ENC = 52.8 ~ 58.2). KAO exhibits
an intermediate degree of codon usage bias with ENC of
39.2. ANOVA showed that ENC of the late-step genes differed significantly from those of the early step genes (P <
0.001). To further investigate the correlation between evolutionary rate and expression level, we analyzed the correlation between each of three parameters (dN, dS, and dN/
dS) and ENC that negatively correlates with expression
level. Results showed that significantly negative correlation existed between dS and ENC (P < 0.001), but not
between ENC and either dN (P = 0.540) or dN/dS (P =
0.103).

Testing for positive selection
Significant rate heterogeneity among the GA pathway
genes, particularly for dN/dS ratios that span more than
one order of magnitude (Figure 2), might result either
from intense purifying selection on slowly evolving genes
(e.g., GA20ox2) or from frequent episodes of positive
selection on fast evolving genes (e.g., KS1). Therefore, we
first used branch models to test whether the evolutionary
rate of each gene differed among lineages within the rice
tribe. For all 7 genes, free ratio model (Mf) did no have
significantly higher likelihood scores than one ratio
model (M0) (P > 0.05) (Additional file 8). The  values
were estimated to be 0.022 ~ 0.386 under M0 model, sug-

gesting that purifying selection or selection constraint best
explains the evolution of these genes.

GA pathway genes, though differential mutation pressures
on genes cannot be excluded entirely.

Because the branch model test averages the ratio across all
sites and is a very conservative test of positive selection
[39,40], we applied site-specific codon models to the 7
genes separately, to determine whether there was positive
selection on codon sites of these genes. Results showed
that, for all 7 genes, models M2a and M8 assuming positive selection were not significantly better than the null
models M1a and M7 (for M1a vs. M2a, 2L = 0.0 ~ 3.72,
0.1 <P  1.0; for M7 vs. M8, 2L = 0.0 ~ 5.3, 0.05 <P  1.0)
(Additional file 8). Consequently, all 7 genes are under
strong selective constraint, which excludes the possibility
of past episodes of positive selection on these genes.

Rausher et al. [11] studied evolution patterns of 6 core
structural genes in the anthocyanin pathway and found
that, over a broad taxonomic distance involving monocots and dicots, the upstream genes evolved substantially
more slowly than the downstream genes. They thus
hypothesized that the upstream genes in a metabolic
pathway evolved more slowly than the downstream genes
due to stronger purifying selection for the upstream genes.
Such a pattern has also been confirmed at the intragenic
[13] and population levels [15] in the genus Ipomoea as
well as by a molecular population study on regulatory and
signal transduction genes [9] but was not supported by
other studies [8,12,17]. In the GA metabolic pathway, we
did not find the correlation between substitution rate and
position of genes. Notably, 2 genes (KS1 and GA20x4)
with the highest dN belong to the early and later acting
genes, respectively (Figure 1). In addition, 3 late-step
genes have significantly lower dN/dS ratios than the earlystep genes, contrary to the pattern found in anthocyanin
pathway genes [13]. Particularly, the ENC data indicated
that silent sites were more constrained (lower ENC values) in the downstream than in the upstream genes (table
1), which would overestimate dN/dS ratios of the downstream genes. This observation suggests that the difference
of selective constraints between the downstream and
upstream genes would be much more striking.

Discussion
Evolutionary rate and position of genes in the pathway
We used two different approaches to have detected significant rate heterogeneity among 7 GA pathway genes for
both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. Multiple
range tests classified the 7 genes into 2 and 3 homogenous
groups of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, respectively, with significant rate difference among genes
between groups but not among genes within groups. It is
noteworthy that the patterns of rate heterogeneity were
different for 2 types of substitutions. For dS, the late-step
genes (GA20ox2, GA3ox2, and GA2ox4) have significantly
higher substitution rates than the early-step genes (CPS1,
KS1, KO2, and KAO) (P < 0.05), whereas one early-step
gene (KS1) and one late-step gene (GA2ox4) consist of one
homogenous group with the highest dN.

It is well established that large variation in among-gene
substitution rates might be determined by two factors: the
rate of mutation and the intensity of selection [1,5,41]. To
distinguish these two possibilities, we first asked whether
there was regional similarity for dS and dN values because
mutation pressure would lead to region-specific mutation
rates[1,42]. It is evident that genes in the same homogenous dS or dN groups locate on different chromosomes
(table 1). These observations, in conjunction with the lack
of correlation between dS and dN, do not support the
mutation-driven hypothesis. To further investigate possible role of mutation, we calculated the GC content of noncoding sites of the 7 genes (Additional file 4). If difference
of GC3 was caused by mutation pressure, we would expect
a positive correlation between GC3 of coding sites and GC
of noncoding sites because the latter is expected to reflect
differences in mutation rate [2,5]. The result did not find
a significant correlation between them (r2 = 0.516, P =
0.069), suggesting that mutation bias alone cannot
explain the differences of codon usage in the 7 genes.
Consequently, differences of selection intensity are most
likely to account for the substitution rate variation in the

As indicated by Cork and Purugganan [17], the specific
nature of selection on the component genes depended
largely on the function of the pathway but the dichotomy
between upstream and downstream genes in a pathway
was a crude differentiation of function. In our case, no
correlation between evolutionary rate and position of
genes in the GA pathway seems better explained by the
pathway fluxes hypothesis, suggesting that natural selection more likely target enzymes that control metabolic
fluxes [17,18]. As predicted by this theory, the enzymes
carrying high metabolic fluxes (e.g., at branch points of
the pathway) will control disproportionately the expression of biochemical phenotypes and experience higher
evolutionary constraints [8,14,17]. In the GA pathway,
enzymes that catalyze multiple steps or at the branching
points (KO, KAO, GA20ox2, GA3ox, and GA2ox) have
also low dN/dS values (Figures 1 and 2). In contrast, the
gene with the highest dN/dS encodes the enzyme involving
in a single step (KS) in the pathway. It should be noted
that upstream enzymes in many pathways are positioned
above major branch points and thus suffer from stronger
selection constraints due to pleiotropic effects [5,17]. This
may partly explain, in terms of pathway fluxes theory, the
differences in levels of selective constraints upon
upstream and downstream genes observed in earlier stud-

ies [9,11,13,15]. In addition, we found that the genes at
the branching points (e.g., GA20ox2 and GA3ox2) have
high levels of gene expression (usually measured by
codon usage bias) (table 1) and slow dN (Figure 2). Such a
correlation in the GA pathway also supports the functional hypothesis that more highly expressed protein will
consume a larger proportion of the cell resources and
might control more important metabolic fluxes [6]. This
explanation is in well agreement with studies on the GA
pathway genes in other plants. For example, increased
expression of a GA20ox gene in transgenic Arabidopsis
plants caused an increase in GA levels and GA overdose
phenotypes while overexpression of the CPS in Arabidopsis
(AtCPS) did not affect the levels of bioactive GAs or the
phenotype [24,40]. It should be noted that translation
selection and selection for protein folding might be also a
factor contributing to differences of evolutionary rates
[7,21]. However, our case cannot provide additional evidence because of limited number of genes used and lack
of information on the protein structure and expression of
these genes.
Rate variation among GA genes is attributed to selective
constraint rather than positive selection
As discussed above, we excluded the possibility that difference of mutation rates was the main factor for rate variation of the GA pathway genes. However, high dN/dS ratio
for some genes (e.g., KS1, KO2) might be due to relaxation
of selection and could also be explained by repeated adaptive selection on these proteins. Earlier studies have
showed that evolutionary rate variation among proteins
might be attributed either to the differences in the magnitude of selective constraints [1,11,15,41] or to the differences in the frequency of positive selection [37]. In spite
of many investigations on factors influencing rate of protein evolution [5,6,8,14,17], few have been conducted to
explore the relative contribution of differential selective
constraint and differential positive selection to rate variation of pathway genes [13,15]. In this study, both branch
and codon models failed to detect any signature of positive selection for any lineage and codon of the GA pathway genes, suggesting that increased rate of
nonsynonymous substitution in some genes is mainly
ascribed to relaxed selective constraint, in agreement with
the studies on anthocyanin pathway genes [13,15].
Unlike some empirical studies [14], however, we did not
detect adaptive substitution for those genes that encode
enzymes controlling metabolic fluxes.

Studies showed that highly expressed genes were more
important to an organism and thus subject to greater
selective constraint and these genes usually had greater
codon bias because of selection for translation efficiency
[5,13,33,43,44]. A recent study on a set of six distantly
related model organisms confirmed that translational

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/206

selection would be an important mechanism behind the
constraints of proteins by increasing translational accuracy and translational robustness [21]. Therefore, the
degree to which a gene is subject to selective constraint
could also be reflected by the magnitude of codon usage
bias in that gene. Indeed, GA20ox2 that is identical to the
rice Green Revolution gene, Semi-Dwarf1 [23], has the
lowest nonsynonymous substitution rate (the smallest
dN/dS ratio) among 7 genes surveyed. This gene exhibits
the strongest codon usage bias (the lowest ENC), consistent with its functional importance. In contrast, the gene
(KS1) that encodes the enzyme involving a single step in
the pathway has the highest dN/dS ratio and much weaker
codon usage bias (much higher ENC). Consequently, the
significant heterogeneity of evolutionary rate of the GA
pathway genes is mainly ascribed to differential constraint
relaxation rather than the positive selection. It should be
noted, however, that the power to detect positive selection
using the above methods may be low, particularly when
adaptive substitutions are distributed across many amino
acid sites such that dN/dS is not elevated above 1 for any
site [15,45]. Further investigations with alternative tests
on within-species variation [10,12,14,15] would be necessary to detect evidence of positive selection and elucidate
the differential rate of adaptive substitution among the
GA pathway genes.

Conclusion
Based on sequence analyses of 7 core structural genes of
the gibberellin biosynthetic pathway, we have detected
significant rate heterogeneity among these genes for both
synonymous and nonsynonymous sites and ascribed such
rate variation to differences of selection intensity rather
than differential mutation pressures on the genes. Our
study demonstrates that the downstream genes in the GA
pathway did not exhibit the elevated substitution rate,
inconsistent with previous argument that downstream
genes in metabolic pathways would evolve more rapidly
than upstream genes. Instead, we found that the GA pathway genes encoding either the enzyme at the branch point
or enzymes catalyzing multiple steps had the lowest evolutionary rates because of strong purifying selection, supporting the pathway flux theory that predicts that natural
selection primarily targets enzymes that have the greatest
control on fluxes.
