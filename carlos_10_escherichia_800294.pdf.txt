Abstract
Background: Escherichia coli strains are commonly found in the gut microflora of warm-blooded animals. These strains
can be assigned to one of the four main phylogenetic groups, A, B1, B2 and D, which can be divided into seven
subgroups (A0, A1, B1, B22, B23, D1 and D2), according to the combination of the three genetic markers chuA, yjaA and
DNA fragment TspE4.C2. Distinct studies have demonstrated that these phylo-groups differ in the presence of
virulence factors, ecological niches and life-history. Therefore, the aim of this work was to analyze the distribution of
these E. coli phylo-groups in 94 human strains, 13 chicken strains, 50 cow strains, 16 goat strains, 39 pig strains and 29
sheep strains and to verify the potential of this analysis to investigate the source of fecal contamination.
Results: The results indicated that the distribution of phylogenetic groups, subgroups and genetic markers is nonrandom in the hosts analyzed. Strains from group B1 were present in all hosts analyzed but were more prevalent in
cow, goat and sheep samples. Subgroup B23 was only found in human samples. The diversity and the similarity indexes
have indicated a similarity between the E. coli population structure of human and pig samples and among cow, goat
and sheep samples. Correspondence analysis using contingence tables of subgroups, groups and genetic markers
frequencies allowed the visualization of the differences among animal samples and the identification of the animal
source of an external validation set. The classifier tools Binary logistic regression and Partial least square -- discriminant
analysis, using the genetic markers profile of the strains, differentiated the herbivorous from the omnivorous strains,
with an average error rate of 17%.
Conclusions: This is the first work, as far as we are aware, that identifies the major source of fecal contamination of a
pool of strains instead of a unique strain. We concluded that the analysis of the E. coli population structure can be
useful as a supplementary bacterial source tracking tool.
Background
Escherichia coli, a bacterium widely spread among warmblooded animals, has been used as an indicator of water
fecal contamination. Fecal pollution in water can indicate
the presence of waterborne pathogens, such as Salmonella and Giardia [1]. The identification of the major animal source of fecal contamination is extremely important
for the effective management of water systems [2]. Therefore, several methods of bacterial source tracking (BST),

using E. coli strains, have been developed to identify the
animal source of fecal contamination. Among these
methods are ribotyping, rep-PCR, antibiotic resistance
profiles, among others [3]. However, until now, only one
putative human-specific strain [4] and one putative animal-specific strain have been found [5].
Escherichia coli strains can be assigned to one of the
main phylogenetic groups: A, B1, B2 or D [6-8]. According to Lecointre et al. [9], groups A and B1 are sister
groups whereas group B2 is included in an ancestral
branch. These phylo-groups apparently differ in their
ecological niches, life-history [10] and some characteristics, such as their ability to exploit different sugar sources,

their antibiotic-resistance profiles and their growth rate
[11]. Walk et al. [12] demonstrated that the majority of
the E. coli strains that are able to persist in the environment belong to the B1 phylogenetic group. Furthermore,
genome size differs among these phylo-groups, with A
and B1 strains having smaller genomes than B2 or D
strains [13]. Johnson et al. [14] found that strains from
phylo-groups B2 and D contained more virulence factors
than strains from the phylo-groups A and B1.
The extraintestinal pathogenic strains usually belong to
groups B2 and D [15,16], the commensal strains to groups
A and B1 [17], whilst the intestinal pathogenic strains
belong to groups A, B1 and D [18]. Clermont et al. [19]
have developed a PCR based method to characterize the
phylo-groups using the genetic markers chuA, yjaA and
the DNA fragment TspE4.C2. To increase the discrimination power of E. coli population analyses, it has been proposed the use of subgroups A0, A1, B1, B22, B23, D1 and
D2, that are determined by the combination of the genetic
markers [5].
Some authors analyzed the distribution of the main
phylogenetic groups among E. coli strains isolated from
human and animal feces. Gordon and Cowling [10]
observed that the relative abundance of phylogenetic
groups among mammals is dependent on the host diet,
body mass and climate. Escobar-Páramo et al. [5] analyzing fecal strains isolated from birds, non-human mammals and humans, observed the prevalence of groups D
and B1 in birds, A and B1 in non-human mammals, and
A and B2 in humans. These authors concluded that one
of the main forces that shapes the genetic structure of E.
coli populations among the hosts is domestication. BaldyChudzik et al. [20] analyzed feces from zoo animals and
found a prevalence of group B1 in herbivorous animals
and a prevalence of group A in carnivorous and omnivorous animals.
The aim of this work was to analyze the distribution of
phylogenetic groups and subgroups in feces from different animals and to assess the potential application of this
analysis in identifying the major source of fecal contamination in the environment.

Results
In this work, 241 E. coli strains isolated from feces of different animals and 12 strains isolated from a sewage
source were allocated into four phylogenetic groups (i.e.
A, B1, B2 and D) and seven subgroups (i.e. A0, A1, B1,
B22, B23, D1 and D2). As shown in Table 1, the strains analyzed were distributed among the seven subgroups, and
the prevalence indexes calculated for the subgroups were:
A0 = 83.33%, A1 = 83.33%, B1 = 100%, B22 = 50%, B23 =
16.67%, D1 = 66.67 and D2 = 66.67%. It is interesting to
note that strains from group B1 were found among all the

Page 2 of 10

analyzed hosts, whereas strains from subgroup B23 were
found only in humans.
The graphic representation shown in Figure 1 allowed
the identification of remarkable trends among the E. coli
strains from the different hosts. Humans are the only host
bearing strains from all the phylo-groups, except for subgroup A0. The strains found in the pig samples were also
distributed among all phylo-groups, except for subgroup
B23, which contains only strains from the human samples. Most of the strains from the chicken samples were
included in subgroup A0, that is, these strains did not
reveal the presence of the genetic markers investigated.
Most of the strains of cows, goats and sheep fell within
group B1, despite the fact that four strains of cows and
three of chickens were assigned to subgroup D1 and two
strains of goats and two of cows were assigned to group
A1.
A Chi-square value of 97.611, 15 degrees of freedom
(D.F.), p < 0.0001, was obtained from a contingency table
with the phylogenetic groups distribution among the
hosts, allowing the null hypothesis, which states that
there is no association between the hosts and the groups,
to be rejected (p < 0.0001). This result suggests a significant difference in the E. coli population structure among
the animals analyzed. A Chi-square test at the subgroup
level was performed to verify the existence of an association between the hosts and the phylogenetic subgroup.
The calculated 155.251 Chi-square value (30 D.F.), leads
to the rejection of the null hypothesis (p < 0.0001). A Chisquare test was also performed to verify the association
between the hosts and the genetic markers (chuA, yjaA
and TspE4.C2). The result (Chi-square value = 87.563, 10
D.F., p < 0.0001) indicated that the genetic markers are
differently distributed among the hosts (Table 2).
The Shannon and Simpson diversity indexes [21,22]
were used to analyze the phylogenetic subgroup data. As
shown in Table 3, the largest diversity indexes were
observed for humans (Shannon index = 0.6598, Simpson
index = 0.7331) and pigs (Shannon index = 0.6523, Simpson index = 0.7245), whilst the smallest diversity was
observed for goats (Shannon index = 0.2614, Simpson
index = 0.3203). The Pianka's similarity index was calculated using the phylogenetic subgroup distribution for
each pair of hosts (Table 4). The results indicated that
humans and pigs exhibited a similarity of 88.3%, whereas
cows, goats and sheep exhibited an average similarity of
96%.
A Correspondence Analysis (CA) was performed using
the phylogenetic groups and subgroups distribution and
the genetic markers distribution (Tables 1 and 2). The
bidimensional representation of subgroups distribution
in each host is shown in Figure 2. This bidimensional representation can explain 93.74% of the total inertia. The

which is responsible for the major separation. According
to this analysis, the subgroup distribution was similar for
cows, goats and sheep and for pigs and humans (Figure
2). A sewage sample was included in the CA (Figure 2).
This sample included the following subgroups: A0 (one
strain), A1 (five strains), D1 (four strains) and D2 (two
strains). As expected, this subgroup distribution was similar to the one found for humans (Figure 2).
The CA using the genetic markers distribution resulted
in a bidimensional representation that can explain 100%

responsible for 92.04% of it. According to this analysis,
the genetic markers distribution was similar for cows,
goats and sheep and for humans, chickens and pigs. The
sewage sample, in which six strains presented the chuA
gene, five the yjaA gene and two the TspE4.C2 fragment,
was plotted near the human sample (Figure 3).
The discrimination power of the phylogenetic groups
A, B1, B2 and D was also tested using CA (Figure 4).
According to this analysis, the bidimensional representation of the phylo-groups relative abundance can explain
99.1% of the total inertia, being the horizontal axis
responsible for 82.54% of it. This analysis revealed that
the phylo-group distribution among cows, goats and
sheep, which presented a predominance of strains of the
B1 group, was similar. Humans, chickens and pigs
remained separated. E. coli strains isolated from two Rivers, Jaguari and Sorocaba, located in the State of São
Paulo, Brazil, and previously analyzed by Orsi et al. [23],
were also included in this CA analysis (data not shown).
The strain composition of the Jaguari River included 42
strains of group A, 13 strains of group B1 and six strains
of group D. The Sorocaba River included 45 strains of
group A, 14 strains of group B1, one strain of group B2
and eight strains of group D. The strains distribution
among the phylo-groups, from both rivers, was similar to
the one observed for chickens and pigs. The sewage sample was also included in this CA and once again, this sample was similar to humans (Figure 4).
The results obtained with the classifier tools BLR and
PLS-DA using the genetic markers are summarized in
Table 5. The separation between E. coli strains of omnivorous and herbivorous mammals presented the lowest
classification error rate (17% on average), while the highest classification error rate (25% on average) was
observed between E. coli strains of humans and nonhumans. Both classifier tools demonstrated that the chuA
and the yjaA genes were more informative to discriminate between E. coli strains of human and non-human
sources (data not shown). The PLS-DA tool showed that

Discussion and Conclusions
This study demonstrated that phylogenetic subgroup,
group and genetic markers distribution are not randomly
distributed among the hosts analyzed. The results
showed a similarity between the E. coli population structure of humans and pigs (omnivorous mammals) and of
cows, goats and sheep (herbivorous mammals). Humans
and pigs exhibited the highest diversity indexes, while
goats and sheep exhibited the lowest ones. Using the simulations of the EcoSim software [24], it was possible to
conclude that the diversity indexes are significantly different among the herbivorous and omnivorous mammals.
The Pianka's similarity index showed that the human
sample was more similar to the pig sample (88.3% of overlap). Cows, goats and sheep also presented a high overlap
(96% on average), while chickens presented the lowest
values.
Cows, goats and sheep are ruminant mammals which
differ in many gut characteristics from other animals.
Humans and pigs present common gut characteristics
because they are monogastric animals (reviewed in [25]).
Besides the gut characteristics, the diet of the host
appears to have selected the phylo-group profile in the
Brazilian mammals analyzed in this work. Omnivorous
mammals presented a prevalence of phylo-group A, while
the herbivorous mammals presented a prevalence of
phylo-group B1. Previous research by Gordon and Cowling [10] revealed a different result from ours, identifying
a prevalence of strains of phylo-group B2 among herbivorous and omnivorous mammals and a prevalence of

the yjaA gene and the TspE4.C2 DNA fragment were
more informative to discriminate between E. coli strains
of herbivorous and omnivorous mammals. The error rate
for BLR and PLS-DA was higher in the prediction of
human than in non-human samples (data not shown).
However, when the feeding habit of mammals was considered in the separation, the error rate for both tools was
higher in the prediction of the herbivorous samples.

phylo-goup B1 among birds and carnivorous mammals,
which supports their hypothesis of geographic effects in
the E. coli population structure among hosts. However,
they also concluded that phylo-groups A and B1 are "generalists" and B2 and D are "specialists", which is in agreement with our data since strains of group B1 were found
in all the hosts analyzed, followed by subgroups A0 and
A1. On the other hand, subgroup B23 was present only in
the human sample. Therefore, our results suggest that B2
strains, especially subgroup B23, could be a good indicator of human feces contamination.
Group B1 was prevalent among the herbivorous hosts.
However, this phylo-group is not a promising indicator of
herbivorous feces contamination because it was found in
all the hosts analyzed, and, apparently, most E. coli strains
that are able to survive in the environment, belong to this
group [12]. According to our data, the distribution analysis of phylo-groups A and D is a powerful discriminating
tool since both groups presented a considerable contribution to the Chi-square values (data not shown).
The chuA and yjaA genes were rarely found in strains of
cows, goats and sheep but were commonly found in
human, chicken and pig strains. Sobieszczaeska [26]
showed that 95.5% of the enteroaggregative E. coli strains
carried the chuA gene, which encodes for a haem receptor. Strains belonging to group B2 were not found in
cows, goats and sheep. Other studies have demonstrated
that B2 and D strains are usually more pathogenic than A
and B1 strains [16,17,27,28]. In fact, verocytotoxin-producing E. coli, like O157:H7, belongs to group D [29] and
cattle are the main reservoirs of this pathogen. The prevalence of groups B2 and D and of the chuA and yjaA genes
in humans and pigs might suggest that fecal contamination
by these animals can present a high risk of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. Thus, the correct identification of
this kind of fecal contamination can also be useful to the
appropriate management of environmental pollution.

Correspondence analysis is a descriptive/exploratory
technique, based on Chi-square values, that allows the
exploration of the structure of the data. In the three CA
models performed, similar distribution patterns were
observed among E. coli strains of herbivorous mammals
and among strains of omnivorous mammals. Furthermore, the CA of subgroup distribution allowed the discrimination of omnivorous mammals. Similar results
were observed by Baldy-Chudzik et al. [20]. These
authors suggested that the E. coli strains of group B1 are

best adapted to herbivorous, whereas strains of group A
are best adapted to omnivorous mammals. The three CA
models correctly predicted the animal/human source of
the external validation sample (sewage), indicating that a
significant part of the E. coli phylo-group diversity was
covered by the strains database, which reveals the stability of the models. E. coli samples from the Jaguari and
Sorocaba Rivers [23] were also used to test the CA model
based on phylo-group distribution. Our analysis suggested that pigs were the major source of fecal contami-

nation in both rivers, which is in agreement with Orsi et
al. [23], confirming that the major source of fecal contamination of these rivers was non-human. Therefore,
these results indicate that the CA model can be efficiently
applied in the discrimination of E. coli strains from different animal sources.
Both classifier tools (BLR and PLS-DA) and both validation methods (cross-validation and train-test) exhibited similar overall error rates for each strain separation
analyzed. This way, the statistical method used did not
show a significant interference in the obtained results.
Excluding the chicken sample, the best classification was
obtained when the E. coli strains were separated according to the feeding habits of the hosts (omnivorous and
herbivorous mammals). Although the classification error
rates found could be considered high, similar error rates
were observed in other BST studies [30,31].
Since it is very difficult to find host-specific strains or
genetic markers [4,32], in this work we propose a new
approach to identify the animal source of fecal contami-

nation in water systems. This approach is based on the
specificity of the E. coli population structure instead of
host-specific strains. Geographic variation of the E. coli
population structure was reported in the literature
[10,32] and since the relative abundance of phylo-groups
among hosts can be easily characterized, this approach
can be implemented in different regions of the world as a
supplementary bacterial source tracking tool. Although
our data is consistent in showing the potential applicability of this approach, we are aware that there might be
some limitations due to the limited number of fecal pollution sources analyzed.

ety of hosts (Table 6). Each strain was isolated from a single animal. These strains were used to build the
calibration set for further statistical analysis.
Twelve sewage strains isolated by CETESB (Table 6),
the organization responsible for the control of environmental pollution, sewage, and water quality in the State of
São Paulo, Brazil, were used as the external validation set.
The sewage samples were collected in 2008 at the Jesus
Neto sewage treatment plant.
The strains were isolated as described by Orsi et al.
[23], with modifications. Samples were analyzed using
the membrane filter technique with modified mTEC agar
(Difco) and incubated for 2 h at 35 ± 0.5°C and 22--24 h at
44.5 ± 0.2°C. Typical colonies were streaked on EMB agar
(Merck). Isolated colonies were tested for citrate utilization, lactose fermentation, oxidase, l-lysine decarboxylase, motility, glucose and sucrose fermentation,
tryptophan deamination, indole production, urea hydrolysis and sulfide production. Isolates with an E. coli profile were inoculated into LB broth at 37°C overnight. One

isolated colony from each EC positive sample was
selected for further analyses.
Phylogenetic group determination

The phylogenetic group of each strain was determined
according to Clermont et al. [19], by multiplex PCR of the
genes chuA and yjaA and the DNA fragment TspE4.C2.
The amplification products were separated in 2% agarose
gels containing ethidium bromide [33]. After electrophoresis, the gel was photographed under UV light, and the
strains were assigned to the phylogenetic groups B2
(chuA+, yjaA+), D (chuA+, yjaA-), B1 (chuA-, TspE4.C2+)
or A (chuA-, TspE4.C2-).
To increase the strains discrimination, subgroups or
phylotypes were determined as follows: subgroup A0
(group A), chuA-, yjaA-, TspE4.C2-; subgroup A1 (group
A), chuA-, yjaA+ TspE4.C2-; group B1, chuA-, yjaA-,
TspE4.C2+; subgroup B22 (group B2), chuA+, yjaA+,
TspE4.C2-; subgroup B23 (group B2), chuA+, yjaA+,
TspE4.C2+; subgroup D1 (group D), chuA+, yjaA-,

Bioinformatic and statistical analysis

A graphic representation was used to map the occurrence
of the genetic markers chuA, yjaA and TspE4.C2 in the E.
coli strains isolated from the different hosts. For this, the
genetic markers were scored as present/absent in each
strain analyzed, and the graphic was drawn with the software Pajek v. 1.22 http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/. This graphic provides a useful
representation of the E. coli phylo-groups among the different hosts. It contains two sets of nodes -- genetic
markers and samples -- and edges between them. An
edge between two nodes means that the genetic marker
was detected for a given strain.
The prevalence index (P) was calculated by dividing the
number of hosts exhibiting a particular subgroup by the
total number of hosts analyzed. The results were
expressed as percentages [34].
The Pianka's index was calculated to evaluate the subgroup overlap between two hosts by using the formula: O
= 7pjpk/√7pj27pk2, where pj and pk are subgroups proportions in the hosts j and k, respectively. The results
were expressed as percentages [35].
The Chi-square test, the Simpson's diversity index and
the Shannon's index were performed with the BioEstat v.

5.0 software [36], using the phylogenetic subgroup data.
The EcoSim software [24] was used to test the differences
among the diversity indexes by using resampling. The frequencies of phylogenetic groups, subgroups and genetic
markers were compared among the hosts by using the
CA, which was performed by using STATISTICA 6.0
[37]. The sewage sample was used to challenge the CA
models as an external validation sample.

and Partial Least Saquares -- Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) were performed with the software TANAGRA 1.4
[38]. For these analyses, the hosts were separated into
humans and non-humans, human and non-human mammals, omnivorous and herbivorous mammals. The
genetic markers were scored as present/absent. The
cross-validation of these analyses was carried out by
using five repetitions and ten fold parameters, and the
train-test was carried out using 70% of the samples as a
training set and ten repetitions of assessment.
Authors' contributions
