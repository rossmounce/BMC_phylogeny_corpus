Abstract
Background: An essential driving component in the co-evolution of plants and insects is the ability to produce
and handle bioactive compounds. Plants produce bioactive natural products for defense, but some insects detoxify
and/or sequester the compounds, opening up for new niches with fewer competitors. To study the molecular
mechanism behind the co-adaption in plant-insect interactions, we have investigated the interactions between
Lotus corniculatus and Zygaena filipendulae. They both contain cyanogenic glucosides which liberate toxic hydrogen
cyanide upon breakdown. Moths belonging to the Zygaena family are the only insects known, able to carry out
both de novo biosynthesis and sequestration of the same cyanogenic glucosides as those from their feed plants.
The biosynthetic pathway for cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis in Z. filipendulae proceeds using the same
intermediates as in the well known pathway from plants, but none of the enzymes responsible have been
identified. A genomics strategy founded on 454 pyrosequencing of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome was
undertaken to identify some of these enzymes in Z. filipendulae.
Results: Comparisons of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome with the sequenced genomes of Bombyx mori,
Drosophila melanogaster, Tribolium castaneum, Apis mellifera and Anopheles gambiae indicate a high coverage of the
Z. filipendulae transcriptome. 11% of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome sequences were assigned to Gene Ontology
categories. Candidate genes for enzymes functioning in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides (cytochrome
P450 and family 1 glycosyltransferases) were identified based on sequence length, number of copies and presence/
absence of close homologs in D. melanogaster, B. mori and the cyanogenic butterfly Heliconius. Examination of
biased codon usage, GC content and selection on gene candidates support the notion of cyanogenesis as an "old"
trait within Ditrysia, as well as its origins being convergent between plants and insects.
Conclusion: Pyrosequencing is an attractive approach to gain access to genes in the biosynthesis of bio-active
natural products from insects and other organisms, for which the genome sequence is not known. Based on
analysis of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome, promising gene candidates for biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides
was identified, and the suitability of Z. filipendulae as a model system for cyanogenesis in insects is evident.

Background
The advent of new sequencing technologies opens up the
opportunity to engage in genomics in non-model organisms, and to study model systems aimed at specific interactions in a biological context. In this paper, we have
taken a genomics approach to unravel co-adaptation
within a plant-insect interaction at the molecular level,
investigating the refined metabolic interactions between
the six-spot burnet moth, Zygaena filipendulae, and its host
plant bird's-foot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus.
Plants and insects have co-evolved for the last ~400 million years. A key driving component in these interactions
is the ability to produce and handle bioactive natural
products. The dogma is that plants produce low molecular
mass bioactive compounds as a chemical defense against
herbivorous insects. These specialized bioactive compounds are often specific to a particular species. As a countermeasure, herbivorous insects evolve strategies to
circumvent the plants chemical defense systems, e.g. by
detoxification. The ability to circumvent the chemical
defense system of a particular plant species enables the
insect to develop an advantageous niche with few competitors. This has resulted in the majority of insects having a
restricted diet, feeding only on one plant species.
In some cases, insects are able to de novo biosynthesize the
same or similar defense compounds as the feed plant,
which is why they are immediately able to handle the
defense compounds when they encounter the plant. These
insects use the compounds in their own defense against
predators. If the insects develop an ability to sequester the
particular bio-active natural product from the feed plants,
the interaction may become highly beneficial for the
insects, as they save energy in their own metabolism.

To unravel the molecular mechanism behind co-adaption
and balance between sequestration and de novo biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in plant-insect interactions,
we have taken advantage of the model system of interactions between L. corniculatus and Z. filipendulae [1]. L. corniculatus and Z. filipendulae both contain the bioactive
compounds cyanogenic glucosides (CNglcs) which can
liberate toxic hydrogen cyanide by hydrolysis. While
CNglcs are widespread in plants [2], they are in general
rare in arthropods [3]. Within insects, particular within
butterflies and moths, several species are known to
sequester or de novo biosynthesize CNglcs [1,4,5]. Moths
belonging to the Zygaena family are the only insects
known, able to de novo biosynthesize as well as to sequester the same CNglcs [1,5].
In plants, the entire pathway for CNglc biosynthesis has
been elucidated [6-10]. The precursors for CNglcs are
amino acids, and the biosynthetic pathway is genetically
relatively simple as only two multifunctional cytochromes P450 (P450) and a family 1 glycosyltransferase
(UGT) are involved (Figure 1). In contrast, knowledge on
biosynthesis of CNglcs in insects is rudimentary. It has
been shown that Zygaena trifolii is able to biosynthesize
the CNglcs linamarin and lotaustralin using intermediates
equivalent to those identified in plants [11-13], and preliminary evidence show that the pathway in Z. filipendulae
also involves P450 enzymes [14] (Figure 1). It is not
known whether the ability to biosynthesize CNglcs in
insects is due to horizontal gene transfers, divergence, or
convergence.
To identify gene candidates involved in de novo biosynthesis of CNglcs in Z. filipendulae 454 pyrosequencing of the
transcriptome was carried out. The transcriptome was
compared to the deduced coding sequences of five known

insect genomes: Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster, Tribolium castaneum, Apis mellifera, and Anopheles gambiae. As
P450s and UGTs are key enzyme families involved in secondary metabolism in plants as well as in insects [15], a
focused analysis of these two multigene families were conducted, to specify gene candidates involved in CNglc biosynthesis.

Results
Genome annotation
454 pyrosequencing was carried out on cDNA from a Z.
filipendulae larva feeding on leaves of acyanogenic L. corniculatus. Larvae reared on acyanogenic L. corniculatus
were previously shown to accumulate the same overall
amount of CNglcs as larvae reared on cyanogenic L. corniculatus [16]. This balance is achieved by de novo biosynthesis of the CNglcs, and imply that the transcript levels for
the biosynthetic enzymes are elevated [16]. To achieve
depth in the transcriptome by decreasing the number of
reads for highly expressed genes, the cDNA library was
normalized prior to sequencing. Pyrosequencing resulted
in 319,956 reads [NCBI Short Read Archive, accession
SRX008323] which were assembled into 29,857 contigs
and 42,215 singlets. The average length of reads is 229
nucleotides, while the average contig length is 329 nucleotides, supported on average by 4.4 reads. 3,938 contigs
were longer than 500 bp (Figure 2).

The Z. filipendulae transcriptome was GO-annotated based
on matches to uniprot proteins. The degree of confidence
to the assignment of contig or singlet to a particular GOannotated protein from nr and Uniprot databases is presented as match levels in Table 1[17]. For example, M2
signifies a requirement of the contig to have an identity of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/574

at least 85% measured within the matching region, and to
cover at least 90% of the matching database sequence. On
the basis of a match level 3 (70% identity/70% coverage)
or better match, 158 contigs were assigned to a uniprot
protein with associated GO-terms, while 335 contigs were
associated with GO-terms at match level 4 (60% identity/
50% coverage) or better. Upon relaxing the match level
criteria to level 5 (20% identity/20%coverage) or better,
3,240 contigs could be associated with one or more GOterms (~11% of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome). Because
several of the sequences were characterized by more than
one GO term, the total number of GO terms obtained at
match level 5 was 8,865. Most of the GO matches based
on comparisons at match level 4 and better are obtained
with D. melanogaster proteins (34%), while at match level
5 and better most matches are obtained with human proteins (41%) and only 17% with proteins from D. melanogaster. This is probably due to the much greater number
of GO annotated human genes as compared to insect
genes.
To group the proteins with associated GO terms, the top
level term for each GO category "Molecular function",
"Biological Process" and "Cellular component" was
recorded at the different match levels. The distribution of
hits in the different categories turned out to be roughly
similar for each match level. The distribution of terms for
match level 5 or better is shown in Figure 3, and a table
listing the different terms and their respective counts for
each match level is provided in Additional file 1. The
dominant terms for "Molecular function" are clearly
transporter activity and binding, while the dominant term
for "Biological process" is pigmentation. Within "Cellular

Genome comparison
Comparisons of the translated Z. filipendulae transcriptome to B. mori, D. melanogaster, A. mellifera, A. gambiae,
and T. castaneum protein sequences using BLASTx are
shown on Figure 4. The average identity of the protein
sequence matches between B. mori and Z. filipendulae is
greater than between Z. filipendulae and D. melanogaster,

A. gambiae, A. mellifera, and T. castaneum (Figure 4). This
is to be expected, as phylogenetically B. mori is closer to Z.
filipendulae (both belong to ditrysia) than the other species are (belonging to Diptera, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera) (Figure 5A). D. melanogaster, T. castaneum, and A.
mellifera have intermediate identities of BLAST hits matching their evolutionary distance from Z. filipendulae,
whereas A. gambiae seem to have more divergent
sequences (Figure 4). This could be caused by adaptation
of A. gambiae to blood feeding and development of insec-

ticide resistance [18], as well as a generally faster divergence in Diptera [19,20]. For sequences with ~90-100%
identity, numbers are very similar for D. melanogaster, T.
castaneum, A. mellifera, and A. gambiae, probably reflecting
housekeeping genes (Figure 4). The BLASTx searches of
the Z. filipendulae sequences against the D. melanogaster
protein dataset, resulted in 8,128 contigs and 4,780 singlets matching 11,365 and 8,693 D. melanogaster proteins,
respectively, with a cut-off E-value of 1e-3. The BLASTx
search of the Z. filipendulae sequences against the B. mori
consensus protein dataset resulted in 10,824 contigs and
7,513 singlets matching 8,195 and 6,993 B. mori proteins
respectively. Due to overlap, the matches correspond to a
total of 9,760 different B. mori proteins. The larger
number of BLASTx hits between D. melanogaster and Z.
filipendulae compared to the number of hits between B.
mori and Z. filipendulae probably reflects the greater
number of recorded D. melanogaster proteins compared to
B. mori proteins (19,389 versus 14,623). Figure 5B
presents a Venn diagram of the matches from contigs
(upper) and singlets (lower) belonging to the Z. filipendulae transcriptome compared to the D. melanogaster and B.
mori protein datasets, respectively (Figure 5). The num-

bers 18,580 and 34,686 denote the number of contigs and
singlets, respectively, from Z. filipendulae without matches
to either D. melanogaster or B. mori. The high number of Z.
filipendulae sequences which do not match either D. melanogaster or B. mori (Figure 5) probably reflects a mixture of
novel, unique genes, poorly conserved genes, and erroneous sequences.
Heliconius butterfly species are known to biosynthesize
linamarin and often lotaustralin [21,22], and are more
closely related to Zygaenidae than D. melanogaster and B.
mori (Figure 5). This prompted a sequence comparison
between Z. filipendulae and three Heliconius species. The
Heliconius species represented in the sequence databases
are H. melpomene (4,977 ESTs) and H. erato (17,567 ESTs),
with the H. erato data set containing additional ESTs from
the closely related species H. himera [23]. These two data
sets were assembled separately using the EST sequence
assembler geneDistiller (Scheibye-Alsing K et al: EST
assembly with genedistiller, submitted), resulting in,
respectively, 420 and 1,207 contigs and 1,205 and 4,438
singlets. In total, 3,961 Z. filipendulae contigs had detectable similarity (E-value 1e-3) with sequences in the Helico-

nius data sets (BLASTn), where 1,626 matched Heliconius
contigs and 2,723 matched Heliconius singlets. In addition, 3,138 singlets from Z. filipendulae matched Heliconius sequences, with 1,117 singlets matching Heliconius
contigs and 2,345 matching Heliconius singlets. In total,
4,035 of the 7,270 conreads (contigs and singlets) of the
Heliconius datasets could be associated with Z. filipendulae
(E-value 1e-3), corresponding to 55% of the Heliconius
conreads. On the other hand, only 7,099 of the 72,072
conreads from Z. filipendulae, corresponding to 9.8%, are
represented by Heliconius conreads, which most likely
reflects the more extensive sampling of the Z. filipendulae
transcriptome. Additionally, the fact that the 7,099 Z. filipendulae sequences hit only 4,035 different Heliconius conreads implies that there is a degree of under clustering in
the Z. filipendulae dataset, i.e. some reads representing the
same gene have not been clustered together in the same
contig. This was also experienced in the course of manual
merging different Z. filipendulae contigs within gene families (see Methods). In addition, many of the Heliconius
ESTs originate from wing disc cDNA libraries [24] which,
unfortunately, may not have a high expression of genes
involved in CNglc biosynthesis.
We used BLASTx for the comparisons of Z. filipendulae to
D. melanogaster and B. mori because good BLAST hits are
more easily obtained with amino acid sequences than
with nucleotide sequences, if sequences have diverged
much from each other. Because the Heliconius dataset consists of nucleotide sequences, BLASTn had to be used for

comparisons between Z. filipendulae and Heliconius. Since
it was not directly possible to compare the BLASTx
searches to the BLASTn searches, test BLASTn runs were
performed between Z. filipendulae sequences and the
genomes of B. mori and D. melanogaster. These runs
showed that for D. melanogaster and to a lesser degree B.
mori, sequences were so diverged that the number of valid
matches obtained was limited. However, using rough estimates we find that around 39% of the Heliconius EST
sequences show similarity with B. mori.
Candidates for enzymes involved in biosynthesis of
cyanogenic glucosides
Our working hypothesis is that the same gene families
(P450s and UGTs) are involved in biosynthesis of CNglcs
in plants and insects (Figure 1). On account of that, a general search for P450s and UGTs with sequences from both
plants [25] and insects was carried out in the Z. filipendulae transcriptome. Despite normalization of the cDNA
library, transcripts representing enzymes involved in
CNglc biosynthesis would be expected to be abundant,
because the pathway for CNglc biosynthesis was induced
by rearing the Z. filipendulae larvae on acyanogenic L. corniculatus leaves. Full length or almost full length contigs
supported by a high number of pyrosequencing reads
would therefore be expected lead candidates for enzymes
involved in CNglc biosynthesis. A second important selection criterion is genes which do not have a close homolog
in B. mori and/or D. melanogaster, because these insects are
not biosynthesizing CNglcs.

Cytochromes P450 (P450)
P450s are heme-thiolate proteins present in all kingdoms
involved in primary and secondary metabolism as well as
in detoxification [2]. Particularly in plants, they are often
recruited for novel biosynthetic pathways, and in plants
the first two steps in CNglc biosynthesis are catalyzed by
P450s. In insects, P450s play crucial roles in the detoxification of toxic bio-active plant natural products present in
their feed plants, as well as in primary metabolism and
development. In general, insect genomes harbor ~100 different P450s, which can be divided into four clades http:/
/p450.sophia.inra.fr/[26,27]. For the majority of P450s
from plants as well as insects the biochemical function is
unknown. However, some functionality can be assigned
to each of the four clades based on known functionalities.
The CYP6, CYP9, CYP28, CYP308-310, and CYP321 families constitute the first clade, and many of the genes
belonging to these families are known to mediate
responses to environmental challenges. The families are
characterized by a very high diversity, individual members
have proliferated by duplication events, show rapid rates
of evolution, occur in gene clusters, and show tissue- or
developmental-specific expression. The CYP4, CYP311313, CYP316, and CYP325 families belong to the second
clade of highly diverse insect P450s, with some of the gene
members being induced by xenobiotics. The third clade is
the mitochondrial CYP12 family, comprising many rapidly evolving genes. Some of the slowly evolving genes in
this family are involved in moulting. The CYP15, CYP18,
and CYP303-307 families constitute the fourth clade of
insect P450s. Some members of these families are
involved in essential physiological functions like juvenile
hormone biosynthesis and moulting.

Approximately 120 putative P450 conreads were identified in the Z. filipendulae transcriptome (a table of all
sequences with length and coverage are shown in Additional file 1). Five Z. filipendulae P450 sequences
(ZfCYP9A37, ZfCYP304F2, ZfCYP332A3, ZfCYP379A2,
ZfCYP379A3) were identified in the dataset as full length
sequences. The coding sequence of a P450 is approximately 1500 bp. Eleven P450 sequences longer than 1000
nucleotides were discovered all in all (ZfCYP4G47,
ZfCYP4G48, ZfCYP9A37, ZfCYP304F2, ZfCYP332A3,
ZfCYP333B8, ZfCYP379A2, ZfCYP379A3, ZfP450-5,
ZfP450-13, Zfc3346). To extend these, and other partial
sequences, RACE PCR was performed, and this provided
further full length sequences of ZfCYP4G47, ZfCYP4G48,
ZfCYP4L17, ZfCYP6CT1, ZfCYP6AE27, CYP9A36, and
ZfCYP333B8, resulting in twelve full length P450
sequences [GenBank accessions GQ915312-GQ915323].
A Neighbor-Joining tree containing the twelve full length
Z. filipendulae sequences as well as selected P450s from
other species is shown in Figure 6. The selected P450s
were most closely related to the Z. filipendulae P450s, and

were chosen from a much larger tree (Additional file 2)
comprising more than 200 P450 genes from many different insect species.
The few P450 sequences from the tree with assigned functions are: DmCYP4G1, DmCYP49A1, DmCYP12A4, and
BmCYP15C1. DmCYP4G1 is required for lipid metabolism, DmCYP49A1 and DmCYP12A4 confer insecticide
resistance and may therefore be involved in detoxification
reactions, while BmCYP15C1 is involved in juvenile hormone biosynthesis. For an overview of known D. melanogaster P450 functions see [28]. Based on the known
function and its position in the tree, it can be inferred that
ZfCYP304F2 may be involved in juvenile hormone biosynthesis, ZfCYP333B8 may be involved in detoxification
processes, and ZfCYP4G48 and ZfCYP4G47 could be
required for lipid metabolism. However, because the Z.
filipendulae P450 sequences are not that closely related to
the P450s with known functions, these functional assignments of P450s in Z. filipendulae are to be considered tentative. Because most of the P450s from B. mori and D.
melanogaster shown in the tree has not been properly

characterized, it was not possible to infer functions to
most of the full length Z. filipendulae P450s obtained.
Based on our criteria for lead candidates, ZfCYP4G47
would appear to be a less likely candidate, because of the
close homolog present in B. mori (82% sequence identity
on the amino acid level). ZfCYP4G47 was the only one of
the Z. filipendulae P450s with a close homolog in the cyanogenic butterfly Heliconius, showing 83% sequence identity over 250 amino acid residues. As the sequence is
partial it has been omitted from the tree presented in Figure 6, and due to the close homolog in B. mori mentioned
earlier, it is not a good candidate for CNglc biosynthesis.
The remaining eleven full length Z. filipendulae P450s
appear sufficiently distant to genes in the other two species, to have been able to acquire functions specific to Z.
filipendulae. The most divergent Z. filipendulae full length
P450 is ZfCYP6CT1 (~30% sequence identity on the
amino acid level). This may therefore be the best candidate for a P450 involved in the CNglc pathway. The Z. filipendulae transcriptome contains two P450s belonging to a
new animal P450 family (CYP379 in clade 2) to which a
single sequence from Epiphyas postvittana (light brown
apple moth) has previously been assigned (Nelson, D.
personal communication). Like Z. filipendulae, E. postvittana belong to Ditrysia (Figure 4). Since E. postvittana is
not cyanogenic, the two putative CYP379 orthologs are
not obvious candidates for a P450 involved in CNglc biosynthesis.
UDPG-Glucosyltransferases (UGTs)
The third and final step in CNglc biosynthesis in plants is
a glucosylation step catalyzed by a Family 1 UDPG-glycosyltransferase [29], and mediating the conversion of a
cyanohydrin into the corresponding CNglc [30,31]. Family 1 UGTs are ubiquitously found in plants, animals,
fungi, bacteria, and viruses [32]. UGTs generally serve to
glycosylate low molecular weight molecules, as a mean to
convert reactive and toxic aglycones into more stable and
non-reactive storage forms, as well as to increase solubility
of hydrophobic metabolites, and as transport cues for
intra- and intercellular transport [32]. In addition, UGTs
are also involved in hormone homeostasis and detoxification of xenobiotics.

The pyrosequencing approach resulted in identification of
41 different putative Family 1 UGT conreads in the Z. filipendulae transcriptome. Three of these sequences represented full length sequences (ZfUGT33A1, ZfUGT33B1,
ZfUGT35E1)

were selected from a larger tree (Additional file 3) comprising 76 UGT genes from different insect species.
The high abundance of the three full length Z. filipendulae
UGT transcripts implies that one of these three UGT
sequences may be the UGT catalyzing the last step in
CNglc biosynthesis. From Figure 7 it is evident that the Z.
filipendulae UGTs assigned as ZfUGT33A1 and
ZfUGT33B1 have fairly close homologs in B. mori, while
this is not the case for ZfUGT35E1. Accordingly, among
the full length sequences obtained, ZfUGT35E1 would
therefore be a lead candidate.
Codon usage and GC content
Genes involved in biosynthesis of CNglcs in Z. filipendulae
have been hypothesized to be highly expressed in larvae
feeding on acyanogenic L. corniculatus [16]. Highly
expressed genes are generally assumed to possess a more
biased codon usage, and a higher GC content in comparison to genes with low expression [33]. Accordingly, to
obtain evidence of their expression levels, codon usage
and GC content of each Z. filipendulae candidate gene
encoding P450s or UGTs were examined. Codon usage
and GC content of genes encoding P450s and UGTs were
similar, and average numbers for each gene family are

shown in Table 2. Overall codon usage in Z. filipendulae
was found to be similar to codon usage in B. mori (Table
2). A biased codon usage (ENC) is a measure of how far
the codon usage of a gene departs from equal usage of synonymous codons, and is rated from 20 (maximally bias)
to 61 (unbiased) [33]. The high ENC numbers signify a
low codon usage bias, i.e. a somewhat equal usage of synonymous codons within the gene families. D. melanogaster
has the lowest ENC values, e.g. higher codon usage bias
compared to Z. filipendulae and B. mori. Codon usage bias
within the P450 genes is significantly different when D.
melanogaster sequences are compared to sequences from
Z. filipendulae and B. mori using student t-tests (both significant at the 99% level). This was also the case when
only 12 D. melanogaster P450s were compared to the 12 Z.
filipendulae P450s (data not shown). Codon usage within
the UGTs showed no significant differences between the
three species. The high number of P450 genes available
for analysis in comparison to the number of UGT genes
available, may explain the insignificant codon usage differences observed in the latter group. It has previously
been suggested that Lepidoptera exhibits less codon usage
bias than other species [34], and this study corroborates
with that observation.
The GC content in the Z. filipendulae transcriptome is
38.7% (Table 2). This is lower than measured for A. gambiae (55.8%), D. melanogaster (53.9%), B. mori (48.1%),
and T. castaneum (47.2%), but more similar to the GC
content in A. mellifera (43.5%) and Heliconius (44%). This
is remarkable, because Z. filipendulae and Heliconius are
phylogenetically more closely related to B. mori and D.
melanogaster [35], in comparison to the relationship
between Z. filipendulae and A. mellifera. For unknown reasons, selective pressure within Ditrysia (Figure 4) towards
the development of a lower GC content may have
occurred. Alternatively, the unexpected high values of GC
content may have been obtained due to a prediction bias
towards more GC rich transcripts, introduced by the gene

annotation methods when applied on entire genomes
[36].
Substitution rate ratios
To test our lead candidates for selection, we calculated the
nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution
rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) on full length sequences of P450s
and UGTs from Z. filipendulae. ω provides a sensitive
measure of selective pressure at the protein level, with ω
values < 1, = 1 and > 1 indicating purifying selection, neutral evolution and diversifying selection, respectively.
Maximum likelihood models of codon substitution
account for variable selective pressures among amino acid
sites. By testing different models with more classes of ω,
positive selection in specific regions of a gene can be
detected [37]. The program codeml from the PAML4.1
package was used for the analysis. Site-models 0, 1, 2, 3,
5, 7, 8 from codeml were tested on the available full
length P450 and UGT sequences with likelihood ratio
tests [38]. The models used basically implement different
rates and classes of ω values, e.g. model 0 has one ω value
calculated from the data set, model 1 has two ω values,
with one value fixed at 1 and the other calculated from the
data set, and so on with model 8 operating with 11 classes
of ω values all calculated from the data set. The likelihood
ratio test was used to calculate which of the possible models offered the best fit to the data set [37]. If positive selection was present in one or more of the sequences tested,
residues with positive selection would be identified in the
output file.

In our analyses, average ω values range from 0.18 to 0.53,
with UGTs having the highest ω value (Table 3). These ω
values are quite low and signify purifying selection. Model
3 (three discrete classes of ω values) provides the best fit
for P450s while model 1 (two ω values of which one is
fixed at 1) offers the best fit for UGTs. This demonstrates
a negative purifying selection to maintain the sequence in
both gene families. Negative purifying selection pressure
is less restrained in some sequence domain areas for

P450s as evidenced by the obtained best fit using Model 3
which is based on three discrete classes of ω values. UGTs
possess larger sequence domains (46%) where they seem
to undergo neutral evolution corresponding to a ω value
of 1. This signifies that some areas are prone to accumulate a lot of mutations which could give rise to proteins
with new catalytical functions or altered substrate specificities [39,40]. No sites with positive selection were
detected in any sequence from any of the gene families
(Table 3).

Discussion
Characterization of the Zygaena filipendulae
transcriptome
The Z. filipendulae transcriptome was compared to other
sequenced insect species, and the results clearly show that
Z. filipendulae is more closely related to B. mori compared
to D. melanogaster, A. mellifera, A. gambiae, and T. castaneum (Figure 4, Figure 5). The high percentage of Z. filipendulae contigs with no match in Heliconius and B. mori
as well as in any other sequenced insects reflects the
uniqueness of the species, and corroborates with previous
observations of unusually many unique genes in the other
Ditrysians B. mori and Manduca sexta [41]. GO groups
could be assigned to ~11% of the Z. filipendulae sequences
whereas the corresponding number for the Heliconius
sequences was 25% [24]. The gene sequences encoding
the gene families of relevance to cyanogenesis (P450s and
UGTs) are not well represented among the genes to which
a GO annotation was assigned. For the P450s, only 45 out
of 118 sequences (38%) had a BLAST hit (E-value 0.01)
with a GO term attached. This demonstrates that the
assignment of GO terms is biased towards genes with high
overall sequence conservation, and well-known roles in
primary metabolism.

In H. melpomene, 28.5% of the contigs had GO terms
assigned, all within "Molecular function". 15% of those is
assigned to the transporter activity category [24], while
this category comprises 61% in Z. filipendulae. In H. melpomene, 20% of GO annotated sequences are assigned to
the "binding" category, similar to that observed in Z. filipendulae. These terms account for a larger fraction of the
overall assignments than expected. This may indicate that
genes encoding these functions in general are more con-

p: 0.03 0.40 0.57
ω : 0.00 0.10 0.25$
p: 0.54 0.46
ω : 0.13 1.00$

served among different organisms and thus easier to
annotate. Alternatively, this may represent database annotation artifacts. The "structural molecule" category is represented by 30% in H. melpomene, but limited to around
2% in Z. filipendulae. This may reflect that the original
cDNA library from which the H. melpomene sequences
were obtained was non-normalized, and therefore gave
rise to an overrepresentation of ribosomal sequences. The
assignments to the other categories within Molecular
function are similar in H. melpomene and Z. filipendulae
[24]. Differences in gene assignments between H. melpomene and Z. filipendulae could signify different selection
pressures on the genes in the two species, derive from the
fact that many of the Heliconius ESTs originate from wing
disc cDNA libraries, and not larvae as in Z. filipendulae, or,
more likely, be artifacts resulting from a low number of
GO-annotated genes in both species.
In the "Biological process" group, the term representing
the largest gene fraction in Z. filipendulae is pigmentation.
While "metabolic process" and "multicellular organismal
process" are relatively common terms which would be
expected to feature prominently in the distribution of
terms, "pigmentation" would only be expected to generate few counts among a random set of genes. Hence, the
relatively high predominance of genes associated with
"pigmentation" was unexpected. This may indicate that
genes involved in pigmentation are conserved between
insect species or more likely reflect that pigmentation is a
frequently studied topic in butterflies and D. melanogaster
[24]. The distribution of hits in the "Cellular component"
category features organelle, cell part and organelle part as
dominant terms. These are broad terms, and it seems reasonable that they are widely represented in Z. filipendulae.
As GO and other public databases are populated with
additional data, it will be possible to provide annotation
for a higher fraction of the Z. filipendulae data set.
Candidates for enzymes involved in biosynthesis of
cyanogenic glucosides
The two multigene families, P450s and UGTs, are found
in most or all living organisms. They serve important roles
in housekeeping reactions, as well as in the synthesis of
bio-active natural products, and in detoxification of xenobiotics and allelochemicals. The pyrosequencing

Page 10 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:574

approach was therefore expected to provide a multitude of
sequences within both families of which the great majority was not expected to have any function related to cyanogenesis in Z. filipendulae. To select genes putatively
related to biosynthesis of CNglcs, the presumed high transcriptional activity of the relevant P450 and UGT encoding genes, reflecting the demand for effective de novo
CNglc biosynthesis in Z. filipendulae larvae, was
employed. Therefore, P450 and UGT gene sequences providing a high number of reads and long contigs were considered promising gene candidates. Additional priority
was given to candidate genes with no close homologs in
the genomes of acyanogenic B. mori and D. melanogaster,
because a high sequence identity would probably signify
a housekeeping protein. In cases where putative
homologs were found in other sequenced insects, sufficient time may have passed since the divergence from a
common ancestor for recruitment of the gene to a new
function. The shared ability of Z. filipendulae and Heliconius species to produce the CNglcs linamarin and lotaustralin motivated a search for putative orthologous genes in
Heliconius. Since the estimated time of divergence between
B. mori and H. melpomene is 103 ± 9 MY [20], the divergence between Z. filipendulae and Heliconius is probably
comparable (Figure 4). However, only very few genes
from the Heliconius dataset matched Z. filipendulae genes
belonging to the P450 or UGT multigene families. This is
probably due to the fact that the Z. filipendulae transcriptome is derived from larval tissue, and Heliconius ESTs are
mostly derived from wing discs. Furthermore, the Heliconius ESTs are biased as biosynthesis of CNglcs in insects in
general takes place in the larval stage, and not in wing tissue.
Many of the partial gene sequences obtained by pyrosequencing of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome belong to the
same gene. The number of gene sequences found in this
study predicted to encode P450s or UGTs is therefore an
overestimate of the actual number of genes belonging to
each of these families in Z. filipendulae. Nevertheless, the
number of gene sequences found within each gene family
appears to closely match the gene numbers within these
groups obtained from fully sequenced insect genomes (A.
aegypti, A. gambiae, A. mellifera, B. mori, C. quinquefasciatus,
D. melanogaster, T. castaneum) when overestimation is
taken into account. The pyrosequencing approach thus
afforded a high coverage of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome, and that conclusion was also obtained following
pyrosequencing of the transcriptomes of other organisms
[42].
Evolution and selection on enzymes involved in
biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides
Highly expressed genes are often characterized by a higher
codon usage bias and low ENC numbers, in comparison

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/574

to lowly expressed genes [33]. In the P450 and UGT multigene families investigated here, the codon usage bias is
surprisingly low and the ENC numbers high, considering
that the full length copies represent a fairly high expression level. High ENC values have previously been found
in highly expressed ribosomal proteins from Spodoptera
frugiperda and B. mori, but not in D. melanogaster [34], suggesting that genes with an unbiased codon usage may be
a common trait in Lepidoptera. This study indicates that
this observation is also valid for Z. filipendulae. A quantitatively equivalent level of the tRNAs corresponding to
each of the codons for the same amino acid would explain
the lack of codon usage bias [34].
A recent recruitment of genes related to cyanogenesis in Z.
filipendulae was expected to be manifested by positive
selection. Nevertheless, no positive selection was
observed among the two gene families examined, and this
would imply that the genes tested have reached a fixed
and important function, that needs to be maintained. Biosynthesis of linamarin and lotaustralin was recently
shown to be old traits, at least within Zygaenidae, and
maybe even in the common ancestor of butterflies and
moths [43,44]. Bouts of positive selection present upon
recruitment may long since have been masked by a subsequent long period of purifying selection to maintain
sequence, once the optimal sequence had been obtained.
The fact that large parts of UGTs seem to undergo neutral
evolution, fits with the fact that UGTs generally have low
sequence conservation albeit conserved secondary and
tertiary structures [40]. The N-terminal part of the protein,
responsible for binding of the aglycone, is less conserved
than the C-terminal part which binds the UDP sugar.
Therefore the N-terminal part could be the part of the
sequences undergoing neutral evolution.
None of the lead candidate sequences for genes involved
in biosynthesis of CNglcs in Z. filipendulae show high
homology to plant genes involved in CNglc biosynthesis.
This supports the notion that the ability to de novo biosynthesize CNglcs was developed independently in arthropods and plants [5] by convergent evolution. However,
the similarities of the biosynthetic pathways between the
two kingdoms indicate that CNglcs may be produced
according to an optimal biochemical route affording easy
recruitment of the enzyme activities required.

Conclusion
Pyrosequencing is an attractive approach to gain access to
genes in the synthesis of bio-active natural products from
insects and other organisms, for which the genome
sequence is not known. The transcriptome of Z. filipendulae offers a unique opportunity to characterize the biosynthetic pathway of cyanogenesis in insects. Moreover,
Zygaena species have co-evolved with their cyanogenic

feed plants for millions of years [44], offering opportunities for further analyses in this field.
Analysis of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome by 454 pyrosequencing has revealed several gene candidates for biosynthesis of CNglcs, and full length sequences of the gene
candidates have been generated by RACE PCR. Heterologous expression and biochemical and functional characterization of the recombinant enzymes will serve to
identify genes with relevance to cyanogenesis. The
obtained transcriptome offers the additional option to
design microarrays to study transcript regulation to understand the environmental cues, timing and tissue localization of biosynthesis of CNglcs. A detailed transcriptomics
comparison using such microarrays as a comparison
between Z. filipendulae larvae that are sequestering versus
de novo biosynthesizing CNglcs will further the understanding of how metabolism is directed by the content
and ratio of CNglcs in the host plant.

Methods
Insect material, pyrosequencing and assembly
Z. filipendulae larvae were collected from a fallow field in
Kvistgård north of Copenhagen, Denmark, and reared for
a week on L. corniculatus plants devoid of CNglcs [16]. The
gut was removed from one larva, and total RNA was
extracted from the remaining part of the body using RNeasy plant mini kit from Qiagen (Cat. No. 74904). Integrity
of the RNA was verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
before total RNA was shipped to Eurofins MWG Operon,
Inc, Germany http://www.eurofinsdna.com/home.html.
Eurofins MWG Operon performed mRNA purification
and normalization in order to thin out the highly abundant transcripts before 454 pyrosequencing. cDNA was
produced and fragmented by nebulization, and 454 pyrosequencing carried out using a GS FLX system. Sequencing
of the Z. filipendulae transcriptome resulted in 319,956
reads [NCBI Short Read Archive SRX008323] which were
assembled using the "mira" assembler [45] with default
settings (minimum 30 bases overlap with 80% identity).
A minimum read length of 30 bases was required for
assembly.
Genome comparison
Contigs and singlets from the Z. filipendulae transcriptome
were BLASTx searched [46] against the protein databases
"nr" and "Uniprot" [47], and the results checked manually. Of the 29,857 Z. filipendulae contigs, 8,395 matched
proteins in "Uniprot" and 10,423 matched proteins in
"nr", while the numbers for the 42,215 singlets where
4,830 and 6,715 respectively. The overall statistics of the
BLAST-matches are listed in Table 1. The matches at different levels of identity and coverage, i.e. the degree of confidence to the assignment of contig or singlet to a particular
protein is as presented in [17]. The Z. filipendulae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/574

sequences were BLASTx searched against a D. melanogaster
protein set, downloaded from Flybase (December 2008)
http://flybase.org[48], and against the B. mori consensus
gene dataset downloaded from the silkworm website
http://silkworm.genomics.org.cn (November 2008) [49].
Protein sequences from T. castaneum, A. gambiae, and A.
mellifera were downloaded from http://www.beetle
base.org[50], http://www.anobase.org[18], and http://
www.beebase.org[51] respectively (August 2009). The Z.
filipendulae sequences were also compared to 22,544 ESTs
from Heliconius species downloaded from NCBI's EST collection using the keyword "Heliconius". The two species
represented in the data set were H. melpomene (4,977
ESTs) and H. erato (17,567 ESTs) (the H. erato set containing 9,394 ESTs from combined H. erato/H. himera libraries). These two data sets were assembled separately using
the EST sequence assembler geneDistiller (Scheibye-Alsing K et al: EST assembly with genedistiller, submitted),
and the resulting Heliconius contigs and singlets are available in additional files 4 and 5 respectively. The Z. filipendulae sequences were annotated using the Gene Ontology
(GO) terms http://www.geneontology.org) [52] where
possible.
Candidates for enzymes involved in biosynthesis of
cyanogenic glucosides
Candidate genes from the multigene families P450s and
UGTs were identified in the Z. filipendulae sequence dataset by BLAST searches (using BLASTx and BLASTn with
default algorithm parameter settings) with selected protein sequences from the gene families from plants and
insects. Gene candidates from Z. filipendulae were then
BLAST searched (using BLASTx and BLASTn with default
algorithm parameter settings) against the entire Z. filipendulae transcriptome to ensure exhaustive searches. The
BLAST searches enabled the assembly of some genes
which had initially been assigned to different conreads
(33 out of approximately 300 conreads). The sequences of
approximately 50 conreads fell completely within another
contig. During searches in Butterflybase http://butterfly
base.ice.mpg.de/[53], a few contigs from B. mori and
Antheraea mylitta which belonged to the same gene were
also identified. The P450 sequences ZfCYP4G47,
ZfCYP4G48, ZfCYP4L17, ZfCYP6AE27, ZfCYP6CT1,
CYP9A36, ZfCYP9A37, ZfCYP304F2, ZfCYP332A3,
ZfCYP333B8, ZfCYP379A2, and ZfCYP379A3 were verified by Race-PCR using the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit from Clontech (cat. 634914), and partial
sequences were extended to full length.
Analyses on candidate genes
Sequences were aligned in MEGA4 [54,55] using CLUSTALW [56] with default settings, and refined manually.
Phylogenetic Neighbor-Joining trees were also generated,
and bootstrapped with 500 iterations in MEGA4. Codon

Usage analysis was performed with CodonW version 1.3
http://codonw.sourceforge.net/, and codon bias was calculated using the "effective number of codons" (ENC)
method [33]. GC content for Z. filipendulae full length
sequences were calculated in MEGA4. Transcriptome GC
content from A. gambiae, D. melanogaster, B. mori, T. castaneum, and A. mellifera are from http://www.kazusa.or.jp/
codon/, and for Heliconius it was calculated manually.
Nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratios
(ω = (dN/dS)) were calculated for full length sequences
with the program codeml from the PAML package, version
4.1 [57]. Site-models 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 (NSsites) were
tested with the settings: model = 0, icode = 4 (invertebrate), cleandata = 0. The rest of the settings were default.
Models were tested against each other with likelihood
ratio tests [38]. Sequences from other species used for
alignments and trees (Figures 6 and 7 and Additional file
2 and 3) were downloaded from Butterflybase and GenBank retaining their respective names.
