Abstract
Background: N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-based quorum sensing (QS) systems have been described in many
plant-associated Gram-negative bacteria to control certain beneficial phenotypic traits, such as production of
biocontrol factors and plant growth promotion. However, the role of AHL-mediated signalling in the endophytic
strains of plant-associated Serratia is still poorly understood. An endophytic Serratia sp. G3 with biocontrol potential
and high levels of AHL signal production was isolated from the stems of wheat and the role of QS in this isolate
was determined.
Results: Strain G3 classified as Serratia plymuthica based on 16S rRNA was subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Using
primers to conserved sequences of luxIR homologues from the Serratia genus, splIR and spsIR from the chromosome of
strain G3 were cloned and sequenced. AHL profiles from strain G3 and Escherichia coli DH5a expressing splI or spsI from
recombinant plasmids were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. This revealed that the
most abundant AHL signals produced by SplI in E. coli were N-3-oxo-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL), N-3oxo-heptanoylhomoserine lactone (3-oxo-C7-HSL), N-3-hydroxy-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (3-hydroxy-C6-HSL), Nhexanoylhomoserine lactone (C6-HSL), and N-heptanoyl homoserine lactone (C7-HSL); whereas SpsI was primarily
responsible for the synthesis of N-butyrylhomoserine lactone (C4-HSL) and N-pentanoylhomoserine lactone (C5-HSL).
Furthermore, a quorum quenching analysis by heterologous expression of the Bacillus A24 AiiA lactonase in strain G3
enabled the identification of the AHL-regulated biocontrol-related traits. Depletion of AHLs with this lactonase resulted
in altered adhesion and biofilm formation using a microtiter plate assay and flow cells coupled with confocal laser
scanning microscopy respectively. This was different from the closely related S. plymuthica strains HRO-C48 and RVH1,
where biofilm formation for both strains is AHL-independent. In addition, QS in G3 positively regulated antifungal
activity, production of exoenzymes, but negatively regulated production of indol-3-acetic acid (IAA), which is in
agreement with previous reports in strain HRO-C48. However, in contrast to HRO-C48, swimming motility was not
controlled by AHL-mediated QS.
Conclusions: This is the first report of the characterisation of two AHL-based quorum sensing systems in the same
isolate of the genus Serratia. Our results show that the QS network is involved in the global regulation of
biocontrol-related traits in the endophytic strain G3. However, although free-living and endophytic S. plymuthica
share some conservation on QS phenotypic regulation, the control of motility and biofilm formation seems to be
strain-specific and possible linked to the life-style of this organism.

Background
Endophytic bacteria reside within the living tissue of their
host plants without substantively harming it [1]. They can
be beneficial to their host by promoting plant growth or
acting as biocontrol agents [2,3]. Serratia plymuthica is
ubiquitously distributed in nature, and most frequently
associated with plants. This organism has been isolated
from the rhizosphere and the phyllosphere of various
plants, as an endophyte from the endorhiza of potato [4,5],
or as a contaminant in a raw vegetable processing line
[6,7]. Over the last two decades, S. plymuthica has received
steadily increasing attention as a biocontrol agent for
mainly fungal diseases. Based on the international approved
German directive (TRBA 466), it is nowadays classified
within the risk group 1 by the DSMZ (German Collection
of Micro-organisms and Cell Cultures), indicating that the
species does not pose a threat to human health [5].
Quorum-sensing (QS) plays a central role within a
number of bacterial gene regulatory networks by controlling gene expression in a population-dependent
manner with the aid of small diffusible signal molecules
[8]. In Gram-negative bacteria, N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are the best described QS signal molecules. AHLs are made by LuxI homologues and, when
they reach a critical threshold concentration, activate
their cognate LuxR-type regulators which in turns
induce or repress multiple gene expression. QS systems
are involved in various physiological processes in bacteria, including bioluminescence, conjugation, symbiosis,
virulence and biofilm formation [9]. Biofilms are
increasingly recognized as the predominant form of bacterial growth in the environment [10]. Growth in a biofilm provides many advantages for bacteria, including
enhanced resistance to environmental stresses, such as
desiccation and antimicrobials, as well as to host
defenses [11]. It has been well documented that a number of plant beneficial rhizobacteria employ AHLs as
signal molecules to regulate biocontrol activities including the triggering of systemic resistance in host plants
and the production of antifungal compounds [12-15].
The phenotypes regulated by AHLs in Serratia species
are remarkably diverse and of profound biological and
ecological significance. These include motility and biofilm formation, production of antibiotics, exoenzymes
and butanediol fermentation, synthesis of the plant
growth promoting auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and
promotion of plant colonisation and biocontrol against
several plant diseases [13-16]. However, the role of
AHL-mediated QS system(s) in the endophytic strains
of plant associated Serratia is less well understood.
Quorum quenching can been achieved by degrading
AHL signal compounds using lactonases or acylases and
has been shown to interfere with expression of AHL-

regulated traits, such as virulence in Erwinia carotovora,
Erwinia amylovora [17,18], Burkholderia thailandensis
[19], Burkholderia cepacia complex [20], and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [21,22]; or biocontrol activity in
rhizospheric Serratia plymuthica HRO-C48 [14]. AiiAdependent signal degradation is a particularly useful
tool to study the impact of quorum sensing in Gramnegative bacteria having multiple AHL regulatory
circuits without the need to make mutants in the
different AHL synthase genes [21].
In this study we describe the initial characterisation of
two AHL-mediated QS systems in the wheat stem endophyte Serratia plymuthica G3 [23]. Two luxIR homologue genes, splIR and spsIR were identified from this
strain, their AHL profiles characterised and their role in
biocontrol traits were determined. The results presented
show that whilst the control of some biocontrol traits by
AHLs is conserved in distinct S. plymuthica isolates, the
regulation of motility and biofilm formation is strain
specific and possibly linked to the original environment
of the isolate. These results provide new insights into
the regulation of beneficial interactions between endophytic Serratia strains, pathogens and host plants and
will help with the understanding of the inconsistencies
in their biocontrol performance.

Methods
Microorganisms, media and growth conditions

The bacterial, fungal strains and plasmids used in this
study are listed in Table 1. S. plymuthica G3 was isolated from the stems of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in
Taian, Shandong, China. A spontaneous mutant resistant to rifampicin was selected for further experiments.
S. plymuthica G3, its derivatives and the biosensor
Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 [24] were grown in
LB medium at 28°C and stored at -80°C in 25% glycerol.
When required, antibiotics were added at final concentrations of 100 μg/ml for ampicillin, 100 μg/ml for carbenicillin, 40 μg/ml for rifampicin, and 25 μg/ml for
tetracycline. All antibiotics were purchased from Sigma.
The fungal isolate Cryphonectria parasitica was from
the authors’ laboratory collection and was routinely cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Difco) at 25°C.
DNA preparation and manipulations

Standard methods were used for plasmid and genomic
DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel
electrophoresis, ligation, and transformation [25].
Phylogenetic analysis

To gain a better taxonomic understanding of the
Serratia G3 isolate a 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree
was compiled using the neighbour-joining method of

MEGA 4. The 16S rRNA gene sequence from the G3
isolate, we recently published elsewhere [23] was
analysed together with those from other members of
the genus Serratia, including the S. plymuthica DSM
4540 type strain as a reference and the related strains
S. proteamaculans DSM 4543, S. ficaria DSM 4569,
S. entomophila DSM 12358, S. odorifera DSM 4582,
S. marcescens DSM 30121, as well as S. plymuthica
RVH1 from a raw vegetable processing line and an
endophytic strain JA05 isolated from ginseng plants. In
addition, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 as an outgroup.
These 16S rRNA sequences were obtained from GenBank. The tree topology was tested by bootstrap analysis
of 1000 samplings.

(Takara, Dalian, China). The clones expressed the AHL
synthases SplI or SpsI in E. coli DH5a were selected by
T-streak with C. violaceum CV026 for further identification
of AHL profiles, and confirmed by PCR and sequencing
(Sangon Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). A neighbour-joining
tree of LuxI family members was produced using the
MEGA 4. Amino acid sequences of SplI and SpsI from the
G3 isolate were aligned and analysed together with LuxI
homologs from other eight members of Serratia and EsaI
from Pantoea stewartii DC283. TraI of Agrobacterium vitis
S4 was tested as outgroup. These amino acid sequences of
LuxI homologs were obtained from GenBank. Confidence
in neighbour-joining tree was determined by analysing
1000 bootstrap replicates.
AHL degradation by heterologous expression of the AiiA
acyl-homoserine lactonase

A quorum-quenching approach was used to identify
AHL-regulated biocontrol-related phenotypes in the
endophytic strain G3. E. coli S17-1/pME6863 carrying
the AHL-lactonase aiiA from the Bacillus sp. strain A24
under the control of the constitutive lac promotor [21]
was used to mobilise aiiA into G3 by conjugation to
obtain G3/pME6863-aiiA. G3 containing pME6000 was
used as a control. Transconjugants were selected on LB
plates containing 25 μg/ml of tetracycline and 40 μg/ml of
rifampicin. Inactivation of the AHLs produced by strain
G3 was evaluated by T-streak with the C. violaceum
CV026 biosensor strain and further confirmed by LC-MS/
MS analysis as described below.
Extraction of AHLs from culture supernatants

For extraction of signal molecules, all tested bacteria
were grown in 10 ml of LB overnight at 28°C with shaking. Cell-free culture supernatants (sterilized by passing
through a 0.2-μm pore filter) were extracted twice with
equal volumes of ethyl acetate after which the extracted
organic phases were pooled. The solvent was removed
under vacuum and the resulting extract reconstituted in
acetonitrile prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.

Cloning and sequencing of two pairs of LuxIR
homologues from S. plymuthica strain G3

Identification of AHL profiles by LC-MS/MS

Production of AHL signal molecules in strain G3 was
detected using a T-streak assay with C. violaceum CV026
on plates. The following two pairs of primers for the cloning the splIR and spsRI loci were designed to the conserved regions of the corresponding genes in the genus
Serratia using the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment
program: SplIR-F: 5’-TTTGTAGAATACCGGCAA
GCTGTT -3’ and SplIR-R: 5’-CAGATCGTCACGGAGCCTGT-3’; SpsRI-F:5’-GAGAGGGTTCAGTGTC
AAAT-3’ and SpsRI-R: 5’-CCATGGAAGATGTAGA
AATG-3’. These genes were amplified using G3 genomic
DNA as a template by PCR and cloned into pMD-19T

AHLs were examined by LC-MS/MS in the Centre for
Analytical Bioscience, School of Pharmacy, University of
Nottingham, UK. Briefly, the mobile phase A (Aqueous)
was 0.1% formic acid in water (Sigma, MS grade) and
mobile phase B (Organic) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (Fisher). Two Shimadzu LC-10ADvp pumps in binary mode were run at 0.45 ml/min using the gradients
as follows: isocratic flow at 0% for 1 min, linear gradient
from 0 to 50%B in 1.5 min, 70 to 99% until 5.5 min, isocratic until 7.5 min. The column was re-equilibrated for
a further 4 min including subsequent injection cycle
time. The autosampler was a Shimadzu SIL-HTc.

Liu et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/26

The column, a Phenomenex Gemini C18 (5 u) 3 × 15 mm
was held at 50°C in a Shimadzu oven, model CTO-10Avp.
The MS detector was a 4000 QTrap from Applied Biosytems. Specific analyses were monitored in a targeted multireaction monitoring (MRM) mode in which all specific
source and collision cell parameters had been optimized.
Generic parameters were: ion source voltage 5000 V,
source temperature 450°C, the curtain, collision activated
dissociation gas (CAD, N2), nebulizer gas (GS1) and heater
gas (GS2) set at 20, 6, 30 and 15 psi respectively. The
quadrupoles were set at unit resolution and specific precursor-product ion pair parameters were determined automatically using the quantitative optimization facility of
Analyst 1.4.1. Subsequent ion trap scans (enhanced product ion, EPI) were triggered by ion counts in any one
MRM channel rising above 5000 counts per scan (cps).
During these EPI scans, the declustering potential was
ramped from 15 to 35 V and the collision energy was
ramped between 20 and 80 V. Product ions were monitored in the range 80 to 330, with a default fill time of 250
msec using dynamic fill time and a scan rate of 1000Th/
sec. Relative quantification was performed by peak integration of the extracted ion chromatogram of the relevant
MRM ion channel. The LC/MS system was controlled by
the Analyst 1.4.1 software and data analysis was performed
using the same in quantitative mode. A wide selection of
synthetic AHLs with or without a 3-oxo or 3-hydroxy
substitution and with acyl side-chain lengths ranging from
C4 to C14 each at either 1 μM or 5 μM concentrations, for
AHLs with even and odd carbon chain lengths respectively,
were used as standards. AHLs were identified and confirmed by comparing both the elution time and the MS
spectra of the peaks obtained with those of the standards.
Antifungal activity in vitro

The antagonistic activity of G3 and its derivatives G3/
pME6863-aiiA and G3/pME6000 were tested against the
phytopathogenic fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, the
causal agent of chestnut blight as previously described
[13].
Motility assays

Minimal swim motility agar plates contained 10 g/liter
tryptone, 5 g/liter NaCl and 0.3% (wt/vol) Bacto agar
[26]. A 1 μl volume of overnight seed cultures grown at
28°C were inoculated onto swim agar plates and incubated at 28°C for 16 h.
Adhesion assays

Adhesion is considered to be the first step in the development of bacterial biofilm. Bacterial adhesion on abiotic surface was measured using polystyrene microtitre
plates in triplicate as described by O’Toole and Kolter,
1998 [27] with a few modifications. Overnight bacterial

Page 4 of 12

cultures were inoculated into the wells of microtiter
plates in 100 μl of LB or M9 medium (final concentration of OD600 0.02) without shaking and incubated at
30°C for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. At 24 h intervals,
the cell densities were determined at 600 nm, followed
by quantification of adhesion. The medium was
removed, and the cells were stained with 0.1% solution
of crystal violet (CV) at room temperature for 20 min.
The dye was then removed and the wells were washed
four times. Bound dye CV was solubilized with 95%
ethanol, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm.
Flow cell biofilm assays

Firstly the strains G3/pME6863-aiiA and the vector control G3/pME6000 were tagged with the green fluorescent protein, GFP by electroporation with plasmid
pUCP18::gfpmut3.1 [28]. The transconjugants were
selected on LB plates supplemented with both tetracycline and carbenicillin, and verified through observation
under the fluorescence microscope. Biofilms were cultivated in a modified flow chamber in ×20 diluted LB.
100 μl of bacterial overnight cultures (OD 600 = 0.1)
were injected into each channel of flow cell and incubated at room temperature for 48 hours, at flow rate of
52.04 μl/ml for each channel.
Capturing of confocal images

Biofilms were visualized with an inverted Zeiss LSM700
microscope. The objective used was a Zeiss EC PlanNeofluar 10x/0.30. 6 replicate Z-Stacks, with an interval
of 5.741 μm and the pinhole at 1AU, were acquired
from each flow cell and used to create threedimensional representations of the biofilms. Biofilm
structure was quantified from the Z stacks using the
image analysis software package COMSTAT [29].
Production of exoenzymes, siderophores and indole-3acetic acid (IAA)

Proteolytic and chitinolytic activities and siderophores
production were assayed as described previously [30,31].
HPLC (Agilent 1200LC) analysis of IAA production was
performed as previously described [23,32].
Statistical analysis

All data were subjected to analysis of variance
(ANOVA) using Fisher’s least significant difference
(LSD) and Duncan’s multiple-range test to compare
treatment mean values. Each trial was repeated at least
twice with at least three replicates for each treatment.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The GenBank accession numbers for the splIR, and
spsRI genes from strain G3 are FJ919305 and FJ919306,
respectively.

Results
Phylogenetic classification of S. plymuthica G3

To classify phylogenetically the G3 strain isolated from
wheat stems, the sequence from the 1474-bp fragment of
16S rDNA from this isolate we previously determined
(EU344964) [23] was subjected to phylogenetic analysis
with different 16S rDNA sequences from members of the
genus Serratia and E. coli strain ATCC 25922 as the outgroup. The sequence alignment for the phylogenetic tree
was constructed and evaluated with MEGA 4 using the
neighbour-joining method (see Additional file 1). As the
phylogenetic tree showed that the G3 isolate was clustered
within the same group (confidence = 99%) with RVH1
(AY394724) and the type strain DSM 4540 (AJ233433) of
S. plymuthica, respectively. Therefore, Serratia sp. G3 was
tentatively classified as S. plymuthica. It is worth noting
that the atypical S. plymuthica RVH1 strain is unable to
produce prodigiosin pigment when compared to the
S. plymuthica DSM 4540 type strain, but a combined comparative analysis of 16S rRNA and gyrB sequences, DNADNA hybridization, and biochemical characteristics
unequivocally identified this strain as S. plymuthica [7].
S. plymuthica G3 possesses two quorum sensing systems
SplIR and SpsRI

The homologues of the two LuxIR genes were cloned
from strain G3 by PCR using primers against conserved
sequences as described in the Material and Methods. PCR
products of 1441-bp and 1391-bp corresponding to the
expected splIR and spsIR respectively were sequenced. The
1441-bp resulting sequence included two open reading
frames (ORFs) corresponding to the predicted AHL
synthase gene splI (633-bp) and the response regulator
gene splR (750-bp) (FJ919305). The splI and splR ORFs
are convergent, overlapping by 29-bp in their 3’ regions.
The 1391-bp sequenced fragment carried two ORFs corresponding to the predicted AHL synthase gene spsI (687bp) and the response regulator gene (spsR) (747-bp)
(FJ919306). The spsR and spsI ORFs are also convergent
and overlapping by 54-bp in their 3’ regions.
Database searches using tblastx revealed that SplI
(ACR22886) shares 99% and 98% identity to SplI
(AAR32908, AAW27921) from S. plymuthica strains
RVH1 and HRO-C48, respectively, as well as 83, 68,
67% identity to the SprI (AAK76733) from Serratia proteamaculans B5a, SpnI (AAN52498) from S. marcescens
SS-1, and EsaI (AAA82096) from Pantoea stewartii
DC283 respectively, which are mainly responsible for
the synthesis of 3-oxo-C6-HSL [15,16,33-36]. The second LuxI homolog SpsI from G3 was most similar to
the LuxI homolog (ABV39177) from the poplar endophytic bacterium S. proteamaculans 568 (86% identity
and 92% similarity), then to SwrI (AAO38762) from

Page 5 of 12

Serratia marcescens MG1 (74% identity) and to SmaI
(CAJ86499) from S. marcescens strain 12 (67% identity),
SmaI (CAB92553) from Serratia strain ATCC 39006
(60% identity). The AHL synthases SwrI and SmaI catalyze preferentially the synthesis of C4-HSL and, in less
amount, C6-HSL [16,37,38]. To examine the evolutionary relationship between the LuxI family members
described above, a phylogenetic analysis was performed
using MEGA 4 and the neighbour-joining tree was
showed in Figure 1. The results were consistent with
the similarity analysis of amino acid sequences within
LuxI family members, the LuxI family synthases were
clustered into two groups, and SplI and SpsI from strain
G3 are classified into group A and group B, respectively.
SplI and SpsI from S. plymuthica G3 produce multiple
AHLs

To determine which AHLs were made by each SplI and
SpsI, LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on extracted
culture supernatants from the wild type G3 strain as
well as recombinant E. coli strains expressing splI or
spsI and the spectra profiles compared to that of synthetic AHL standards. At least ten different AHLs were
detected in varying abundance in the wild type G3,
including unsubstituted AHLs (C4-HSL, C5-HSL, C6HSL, C7-HSL, C8-HSL), 3-oxo derivatives (3-oxo-C6HSL, 3-oxo-C7-HSL, 3-oxo-C8-HSL) and 3-hydroxy
derivatives (3-hydroxy-C6-HSL, 3-hydroxy-C8-HSL).
The most abundant and hence most likely biologically
relevant AHLs detected in the spent culture supernatants of the endophytic strain G3 were 3-oxo-C6-HSL,
C4-HSL, C6-HSL, 3-hydroxy-C6-HSL and 3-oxo-C7HSL. However, strain G3 did not produce long chain
AHLs [23]. When expressed in E. coli (Table 2), the
recombinant SplI produced all ten AHLs whereas SpsI
produced only unsubstituted AHLs, including C4-HSL,
C5-HSL, C6-HSL, C7-HSL, and C8-HSL. The most
abundant one was C4-HSL from SpsI, 100 fold higher
than that the production of this molecule by SplI in
E. coli, suggesting that SpsI is could also be the main
AHL synthase responsible for synthesis of this AHL in
G3, in accordance with SwrI and SmaI from different
S. marcescens strains [37,38] which share similarity to
SpsI. Both SpsI and SplI produce C6-HSL, but only SplI
was responsible for the most abundant signal 3-oxo-C6HSL, that is similar to SplI from S. plymuthica strains
HRO-C48 and RVH1 [14,32], SprI from S. proteamaculans
B5a, SpnI from S. marcescens SS-1 [34,35], as well as EsaI
from P. stewartii [36]. However, 3-oxo-C7-HSL and
3-hydroxy-C6-HSL have not been reported as the main
AHL signals in other members of Serratia with the exception of S. plymuthica IC1270 which showed very weak
production of the predicted 3-hydroxy-C6-HSL by TLC

ability of the Bacillus A24 lactonase AiiA in degrading
AHL signal molecules in G3, the plasmid pME6863aiiA, and the control vector pME6000 (lacking the aiiA
gene) were introduced into the wild type G3 by mating
with the E. coli donor strain S17-1. Overnight culture
supernatants from these transconjugants were extracted
in duplicate with solvent and subjected to LC-MS/MS
semiquantitative analysis based on MRM mode showing
that G3 harbouring the pME6000 vector control exhibited similar AHL patterns and concentration to the wild
type (data not shown). In contrast, AHL production was
practically abolished in G3 expressing aiiA from
pME6863-aiiA (more than 99% reduction), with only
trace amounts of C4-HSL remaining which could not be
detected by the biosensor CV026 and hence were unlikely to influence gene expression. This result suggested
that AiiA can efficiently degrade all series of AHLs,
including unsubstituted, 3-oxo, and 3-hydroxy at the
third carbon position as it has been previously shown
[39].
Impairment in AHL accumulation resulted in downregulation of the chitinolytic and proteolytic activities in
G3/pME6863-aiiA. In contrast, biosynthesis of IAA
increased five-fold and there was no effect on production
of siderophores, compared to the wild type G3 and the
control G3/pME6000 (see Additional file 2). This is in
agreement with previous observations in S. plymuthica
HRO-C48 heterologously expressing aiiA [14].

Lactonase expression in S. plymuthica G3 reduces
antifungal activity in vitro

Strain G3 exhibited inhibitory effects against several
phytopathogenic fungal isolates in vitro and in vivo
(data not shown). To determine the effect of quorum
quenching by lactonase on antifungal activity, dual cultures were carried out, on single PDA plates, of the
strain G3, G3/pME6863-aiiA or G3/pME6000 with
C. parasitica, the cause of chestnut blight. After incubation for 4 days at 25°C, the radius of the inhibition
zones was measured. Although no large differences were
observed between the wild type G3 and the control
strain G3/pME6000, the radius of inhibition zones produced by G3/pME6863-aiiA was significantly decreased
compared with the control G3/pME6000 and the wild
type G3 at P = 0.01 for C. parasitica (Table 3.). The
data showed that antifungal activity by G3 is partially
dependent on AHL signaling via regulation of various
exoenzymes and secondary metabolites.

Swimming motility was also assayed to determine the
role of quorum quenching by AiiA in motility. The
swimming zones of the wild type G3, the AHL
quenched strain G3/pME6863-aiiA and the vector control G3/pME6000 after incubation for 16 h at 28°C were
33.75 ± 0.75 mm, 33.08 ± 0.80 mm, and 32.83 ± 0.14

S. plymuthica HRO-C48 where QS negatively regulates
this phenotype [14], heterologous expression of aiiA in
G3 has no influence on swimming motility (Figure 2).

under the conditions used, is AHL-dependent.

Discussion
Endophytic bacteria have been found in virtually every
plant studied, and there is increasing interest in developing their biotechnological potential to improve phytoremediation and the sustainable production of non-food
crops for biomass and biofuel production [3]. In this
manuscript we have reported that a new isolate of endophytic Serratia plymuthica G3 from the stems of wheat,
exhibiting antifungal activities, produces high levels of
AHLs and that the QS control of swimming motility
and biofilm formation shows significant differences to
other isolates of this organism from different environments previously described.
The ability of Serratia strains to produce AHLs and
their AHL production profiles is well known to be

species- and strain-dependent [16]. Previous works have
also demonstrated that in S. marcescens SS-1 and
S. plymuthica strains RVH1 and HRO-C48, SpnI or
SplI knock out mutations abolished the production of
3-oxo-C6-HSL completely, but still retained residual
AHL signals, suggesting the presence of additional AHL
synthase(s) in some species of Serratia [15,33,35]. However, this is the first report showing the identification
and initial characterisation of two QS systems splIR and
spsIR in a single Serratia isolate. Sequence analysis
showed that SplIR is highly similar to the SplIR of
S. plymuthica strains RVH1 and HRO-C48, as well as
SprIR of S. proteamaculans B5a and S. marcescens SS-1,
all of which are responsible for the biosynthesis of
3-oxo-C6-HSL, and C6-HSL. Whereas SpsIR shares
similarity to SwrIR and SmaIR from S. marcescens MG1
and strain 12 respectively, which are responsible for production of unsubstituted C4-HSL and smaller amounts
of unsubstituted C6-HSL and C8-HSL (Table 2). In
addition, these two sets of luxI and luxR homologous
genes organized convergently in S. plymuthica G3 chromosome is characteristic of the most g-proteobacteria
[33,35,40]. The results were in line with the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1), demonstrating that the LuxI
family members from the genus of Serratia can be clustered into groups A and B according to the main AHL
signals produced by bacteria, but it is not species-specific.
For example, S. marcescens SS-1 was classified into
group A as SplI of G3, known to produce 3-oxo-C6HSL. In contrast, Strain 12 and MG1 of S. marcescens
were clustered into group B due to the production of
C4-HSL as was SpsI from G3. Hence, our data provide
new evidence to support that AHL patterns in Serratia
is strain-dependent, indicating the presence of some
conserved protein structure-function characteristics that
would determine this specificity and which would be
worth investigating in future. In addition, horizontal
transfer of QS systems due to transposition or phagemediated events have been described for the spnIR locus
of S. marcescens SS-1 and the smaIR locus from strain
12 to 274 [16,38,41]. Consequently, the presence of two
QS systems in G3 may have originated from horizontal
gene transfer amongst members of the genus Serratia.
Gray and Garey (2001) also deduced that multiple LuxI
and/or LuxR homologues present within single species
have been usually acquired from independent sources
[40].
Further comparative analysis of AHL profiles using
LC-MS/MS from the wild type G3 and E. coli DH5a
expressing the recombinant plasmid carrying and splI or
spsI showed that SplI is responsible for the synthesis of
a broad range of AHLs with different substitutions
whereas SpsI only drives the synthesis of AHLs with no
substitutions on their acyl chains all of which are also

Liu et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/26

made by SplI although some of them at much lower
levels such as C4-HSL and C5-HSL. To our knowledge,
the strain G3 is the only Serratia so far described with
the ability to produce 3 different families of AHLs
according to substitutions in position 3 (none, 3-oxo
and 3-hydroxy), although this can be due to the
improved LC-MS/MS techniques used with higher sensitivity to detect lower concentration and broader range
of AHL signals. The most abundant AHL signals identified by LC-MS/MS from G3 were 3-oxo-C6-HSL and
C4-HSL although significant levels of C6-HSL, 3-oxoC7-HSL and 3-hydroxy-C6-HSL were also detected [23].
However, the individual biological role of these AHLs
remains unknown. Overlaps between the AHL profiles
produced by different LuxI homologues in a single
organism has been previously described in other bacteria
such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis [42] and this usually
results in very complex QS regulatory cascades with a
tight intraregulation between them [43]. Whether this
level of complexity exists in the G3 strain remains to be
elucidated.
In many plant beneficial rhizobacteria, QS mechanisms induce the synthesis of antimicrobial secondary
metabolites and extracellular lytic enzymes with inhibitory effects towards other bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and
nematodes [12]. The quorum quenching strategy using
the lactonase AiiA was exploited to simultaneously
quench the two AHL systems discovered in the endophytic strain G3 of S. plymuthica and investigate their
role in controlling biocontrol-related phenotypes. The
phenotypic analysis revealed that the strain G3/
pME6863 expressing aiiA had reduced antifungal activity, chitinolytic and proteolytic activities, but increased
of IAA biosynthesis, and had no impact on siderophore
production compared with the strain carrying the vector
control G3/pME6000 and the wild type G3, indicating
that QS control multiple biocontrol-related phenotypes
in this strain. These results are in agreement with previous observations in the rhizospheric S. plymuthica
HRO-C48 expressing AHL lactonases [14]. Depletion of
AHLs with this lactonase resulted in altered adhesion
and biofilm formation in vitro. This was different from
the closely related S. plymuthica strains HRO-C48 and
RVH1, where biofilm formation for both strains is AHLindependent. In addition, in contrast to HRO-C48,
swimming motility was not controlled by AHL-mediated
QS [14,33].
Attachment is required for biofilm formation and
these are key processes in the interaction between
bacteria and plant tissues which have been shown to rely
on quorum sensing [44]. For example, in the biocontrol
bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain 30-84, QS
systems and their control over phenazine production
play a role in the successful formation of surface-attached

Page 10 of 12

populations required for biofilm formation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that phenazines as signals, upregulated many of the genes related to cell adhesion
and biofilm development, such as fimbrial and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) genes [45]. The SwrIR quorum sensing system in S. marcescens MG1 plays a key role in
biofilm development, from attachment to swarming
motility, biofilm maturation and detachment, although
QS regulation of adhesion in MG1 is surface dependent
[37]. In S. marcescens strain 12, biofilm formation
seems to rely on smaI, although this was measured
using an attachment assay to a plastic microtitre plate
[38], where SmaI is mainly responsible for C4-HSL
synthesis. Pantoea stewartii causing Stewart’s vascular
wilt and leaf blight in sweet corn and maize utilizes the
EsaI/EsaR QS system to control virulence and effective
colonization. EsaI shares 80% similarity to SplI of G3
and is a typical AHL synthase that also catalyzes preferentially the synthesis of 3-oxo-C6-HSL. Both EsaI and
EsaR mutants were not able to cycle through normal
programmed bacterial development leading to the
formation of atypical biofilms in vitro and loss of dissemination and infectivity in vivo, although the AHLdeficient strain displayed an unusually robust adhesion
phenotype [36]. Under the experimental conditions used
the ability of abiotic surface adhesion and biofilm formation by G3, using microtiter plate and flow cell
assays respectively, is AHL-dependent, as the strain G3/
pME6863 expressed aiiA was impaired in these phenotypes in vitro. In contrast, previous studies based on
microtitre plate assays reported that biofilm formation
by the closely related S. plymuthica strains HRO-C48
and RVH1 were not affected by AHL signalling. This
was demonstrated by the heterologous expression AiiA
or the use of a splI-mutant in which 3-oxo-C6-HSL
production was abolished, but still retained residual
unsubstituted AHLs [14,46]. This suggests that QS may
have different roles in S. plymuthica isolates from different environments.
A number of different factors might affect adhesion,
including physicochemical interactions between the bacterium and the substratum, flagella, fimbriae, outer membrane proteins, and the presence of extracellular polymers.
For instance, quorum-sensing regulation of adhesion, biofilm formation, and sloughing in S. marcescens MG1 has
been shown to be surface dependent, and under the control of nutrient cues [10,37]. We predict that the variations
on QS regulation of biofilm development among different
strains of S. plymuthica is likely to be influenced by strainspecificity or their life style though this remains to be
further investigated.
Consequently, this study reveals that, in S. plymuthica
G3, QS positively controls antifungal activity, production
of exoenzymes, but negatively regulated production of

Liu et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/26

indol-3-acetic acid (IAA). This is in agreement with previous reports in strain HRO-C48. However, in contrast
to S. plymuthica strains HRO-C48 and RVH1, where
biofilm formation is AHL-independent, in G3 adhesion
and biofilm formation is controlled by QS. Finally, in
contrast to HRO-C48, swimming motility is not under
QS control in G3 [14-16,33]. This work indicates the
existence of a differential role for QS between endophytic and free living bacterial isolates suggesting that this
regulatory mechanism can evolve to maximise the adaptation to different lifestyles.

Conclusions
Two QS systems SplIR and SpsIR from the endophytic
S. plymuthica strain G3 have been characterised and
their AHL profiles determined. This QS network is
involved in global regulation of biocontrol-related traits,
especially antifungal activity, adhesion and biofilm formation some of which are strain-specific in the Genus
of Serratia. Further investigation will focus on the interplay between the two QS systems in strain G3 and the
integration of QS into complex regulatory networks to
modulate the beneficial plant-microbe interaction. This
will ultimately lead to the optimisation of seed inoculums and provide novel strategies to improve the efficacy of S. plymuthica-mediated biocontrol and plant
growth promotion.
