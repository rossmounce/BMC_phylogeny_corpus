Abstract
Background: Climatic changes during glacial periods have had a major influence on the recent
evolutionary history of living organisms, even in temperate forests on islands, where the land was
not covered with ice sheets. We investigated the phylogeographical patterns of the weevil Curculio
sikkimensis (Curculionidae), a generalist seed predator of Fagaceae plants living in both deciduous
oak and evergreen forests of Japan. Its genetic structure was compared to that of another hostspecific seed predator, C. hilgendorfi, inhabiting only evergreen forests.
Results: We examined 921 bp of mitochondrial DNA for 115 individuals collected from 33
populations of C. sikkimensis from 11 plant species of three genera, Quercus, Lithocarpus, and
Castanopsis. An analysis of molecular variance revealed that a large proportion (almost 50%, P <
0.001) of the total genetic variance could be explained by differences between two geographical
regions, the southwestern and northeastern parts of the main islands of Japan. In contrast, no
significant genetic differentiation of the weevil was observed among vegetation types of their
utilized host plant species. The phylogeographical patterns of the generalist and the host-specific
seed predator exhibited a congruent genetic boundary in the Chugoku-Shikoku region.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that geology and historical environment have contributed to
shaping the present genetic structure of C. sikkimensis. The geographical patterns of genetic
differentiation in the Chugoku-Shikoku region observed in the two types of Fagaceae-associated
Curculio in this study have also been observed in several plant species growing in warm and cool
temperate zones of Japan. The occurrence of this common pattern suggests that deciduous oak and
evergreen forests of Japan survived together, or adjacent to each other, in small refugia during
glacial ages, in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the main islands, although these two
types of forests are presently distributed in cool and warm temperate zones of Japan, respectively.

Background
The current distribution of biological diversity cannot be
understood without information about how organisms

responded to historical geological and climatic conditions. In particular, the glacial-interglacial cycles of the
Quaternary period may have played an important role in

shaping the distribution of biodiversity among current
populations, even in warm temperate zones, where the
land was not covered with ice sheets [1,2]. The geological
and geographical features of the Japanese Archipelago are
comprised of several mountain ranges running largely
parallel to a northeast to southwest axis. The mild coastal
belt is close to these mountain ranges; thus the climate
varies even in a narrow region. Consequently, a wide
range of vegetation occurs, which accounts for various
biogeographical factors that are not common on continental landmasses. Moreover, several landbridges
between Japan and surrounding areas, which formed or
disappeared in response to glacial-interglacial climatic
changes, have also played important roles in determining
the current distribution of Japanese biological diversity.

bivorous insects. We investigated and compared the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic variation of two acorn
weevils with different feeding types. These beetles are of
particular interest because the females lay eggs in the host
seeds. As a result, the fitness of the host and the weevil are
intimately related [21]. The use of the rostrum during oviposition site preparation is considered the key adaptation
that facilitates circumventing the physical defenses of the
plant, such as the avoidance of attachment to the host
[22]. All species of Curculio oviposit in seeds that are still
on the tree. Females use the rostrum to excavate a hole in
the seeds [23], after which they turn around and oviposit
into the hole. The larvae feed on the seeds before leaving
them to overwinter in the soil, where they pupate before
emerging in spring or summer.

Phylogeographical patterns estimated from the extant
genetic variation of organisms have proved highly informative in recovering the postglacial demographic histories
of species [3,4]. Another powerful method is to compare
intraspecific phylogeographical patterns among several
taxa over the same area and to search for congruent geographic patterns of genetic variation, which would indicate the influence of common historical factors [5-17].
Comparing the intraspecific phylogeographical patterns
among different species distributed in a single vegetation
zone should be more informative because a group of species living together in the present environment likely
responded in a similar or possibly the same manner to
past geological or climatic events [5,18]. In the present
study, we focused on the broadleaved deciduous and evergreen forest communities that characterize the biodiversity and endemism of the temperate zone, where the
effects of climate change are particularly severe.

Five species of Curculio associated with Fagaceae seeds are
distributed in Japan: C. sikkimensis, C. hilgendorfi, C. dentipes, C. robustus, and C. conjugalis. These include both generalist and host-specific seed predators of Fagaceae.
Specifically, C. sikkimensis is a generalist associated with
deciduous and evergreen trees [i.e., Quercus (deciduous
and evergreen), Lithocarpus (evergreen), Castanopsis (evergreen), and Castanea (deciduous)], and C. hilgendorfi is a
host-specific seed predator of Castanopsis. The other species are associated with several species of deciduous Quercus. Curculio sikkimensis and C. hilgendorfi are sometimes
sympatrically distributed in evergreen forests.

Palynological evidence indicates that broadleaved deciduous and evergreen forests in Japan were subjected to cold
periods at least four times during the Quaternary [1,2].
During the glacial periods, climatic cooling caused southward and shifts to lower altitude in the geographic distribution of these forests. The pollen record indicates that
refugial populations of broadleaved deciduous forests
were sparsely distributed along the coasts of the Pacific
Ocean and the Sea of Japan, while refugia of broadleaved
evergreen forests were limited to southern areas mainly at
the southern end of Kyushu. Fossil evidence also indicates
that these populations migrated northward from refugia
after the last glacial maximum [2,19,20]. These data suggest that populations of some forest-dependent insects,
especially flightless or nonmigratory species, responded
to the environmental changes associated with the glacial
cycles in a similar fashion to that of their associated forests.
Most plant species growing in broadleaved deciduous and
evergreen forests are parasitized by a diverse variety of her-

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the biogeographical
history of both types of forests by comparing the phylogeography of the two types (i.e., generalists and specialists)
of acorn weevils. Our previous study showed that the
mtDNA haplotypes found in the individuals of these two
Curculio species, C. sikkimensis and C. hilgendorfi, validated
each clade with high bootstrap support [24]. Moreover,
our allozyme data showed that gene flow was disrupted
between the two weevil species via reproductive isolation
even in sympatric populations [24]. The two Curculio species exhibit similar adult morphologies, but can be identified by differences in the shape of the male genitalia [25].
Our previous study reported a phylogeographical and
population demographic analysis of the host-specific seed
predator C. hilgendorfi [24].
The purpose of this study was to assess the phylogeography of the generalist acorn weevil Curculio sikkimensis
(HELLER) based on the current geographic distribution of
mtDNA diversity. We report a phylogeographical pattern
of C. sikkimensis collected from various Fagaceae seeds.
This study addresses the following questions: 1] Do the
mtDNA haplotypes of C. sikkimensis form host races? If C.
sikkimensis exhibits some host specialization, the genetic
differentiation of mtDNA in C. sikkimensis should be
observable among their host Fagaceae species, among
host plant genera, and between deciduous and evergreen

host plants (i.e., deciduous and evergreen vegetation
zones). 2] Do the phylogeographical patterns of Curculio
species enable us to reconstruct the glacial and postglacial
history of their associated temperate forests in Japan?
Given that host plant species inhabit both broadleaved
deciduous oak and evergreen forests, an investigation of
the generalist predator C. sikkimensis provides an understanding of the biogeographical history of both deciduous
oak and evergreen forests in Japan. However, the phylogeographical information of the specialist C. hilgendorfi
reflects the history of evergreen forests. We compared the
phylogeographical results of the generalist C. sikkimensis
and the specialist C. hilgendorfi as well as those of the

plant species growing to examine whether the evolutionary histories of their associated deciduous oak and evergreen forests are similar.

Methods
Insects
We sampled Fagaceae seeds of Quercus, Lithocarpus, and
Castanopsis infested with C. sikkimensis from 33 localities
in Japan (Table 1). Sampling was conducted during October and November 2002â2007, after larvae had grown up
within the seeds. The seeds were kept in plastic bottles in
the laboratory, where emerging larvae were collected. The
larvae were preserved in 99% ethanol for DNA analysis.

Sequencing of mtDNA
We analyzed sequence data for 115 C. sikkimensis individuals from 33 populations with 1â17 individuals per population (Table 1), from 11 plant species of the three
genera, Quercus, Lithocarpus, and Castanopsis. Total DNA
was extracted from the thoracic muscles of larvae using a
standard proteinase K/SDS digestion and phenol-chloroform extraction. DNA fragments of the coding regions of
mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunits I (COI) were
amplified using the following PCR primers: COI-1729F,
5'-GGATCACCTGATATAGCATTCCC-3' and COI-2764R,
5'-CCTAAAAAATGTTGTGGGAAAAAGG-3'
modified
from [26]. Amplification of mtDNA was performed as follows: an initial 3 min denaturation (94Â°C) followed by
40 cycles of 0.5 min at 94Â°C, 0.5 min at 50Â°C, and 1 min
at 70Â°C, and a final extension cycle of 10 min at 72Â°C. All
PCRs were performed in a total volume of 20 Î¼L using ExTaq polymerase (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan), and the products
were purified using ExoSAP-IT reagent (USB, Cleveland,
OH, USA). Sequencing reactions were prepared using a
BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and analyzed on a PRISM
3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences [DDBJ
accession nos. AB177451âAB177468, AB367602â
AB367606, and AB457208âAB457233] were aligned
using Sequence Navigator software (Applied Biosystems).
Data analyses
Haplotype diversity (h), nucleotide diversity (Ï), and
Tajima's D [27] were calculated using Arlequin version 2.0
[28]. A statistical parsimony network [29] was constructed
to investigate relationships among haplotypes within C.
sikkimensis using the program TCS[30]. Ambiguous loops
in the network were resolved following the recommendations of [31]. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
was used to examine the amount of genetic variability partitioned within and among populations as well as among
groups of populations [32] using Arlequin. To assess the
significance of the various factors that could affect partitioning of genetic variability, populations were grouped
according to a set of grouping criteria, including geographic distribution, host plant genera, and vegetation
types. The significance of fixation indices was tested using
a nonparametric approach [32]. When AMOVA analysis
could not determine what number of partitioned groups
is the most suitable, a spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) based on a simulated annealing procedure was used to define the groups of populations [33].

The program SAMOVA 1.0 iteratively seeks the composition of a user-defined number (K) of groups of geographically adjacent populations that maximizes Î¦CT. The
program was run for 10,000 iterations for K = 2 to 4 from
each of 100 random initial conditions.

Results
Haplotype diversity and the geographical distribution of
C. sikkimensis
We identified 47 variable sites in the mtDNA regions and
41 haplotypes in total, of which 24 haplotypes were
found only once. The calculated values of haplotype
diversity and nucleotide diversity are provided in Table 2.
Haplotypes found in more than two individuals are
denoted by uppercase letters, with the A-haplotype being
the most common. Haplotypes found only once are
denoted in lowercase letters. The geographical distribution of the recognized mtDNA haplotypes of C. sikkimensis
was highly structured (Fig. 1a).

The statistical parsimony haplotype network within C. sikkimensis with a 95% connection limit is shown in Fig 1b.
Four main haplogroups (NE, CS1, CS2, and SW) were
apparent in the network. Haplogroups NE and SW were
found in the populations from northeastern (Kantou to
Kinki district) and southwestern parts (Kyushu to the
Chugoku-Shikoku region) of the main islands of Japan,
respectively. Haplogroups CS1 and CS2 consisted of C.
sikkimensis found in the Chugoku and Shikoku regions.
The haplogroups NE, SW, and CS1 showed starlike shapes
centered on haplotypes B, A, and D, respectively, which
were the most frequently observed haplotypes.
Genetic structure observed in C. sikkimensis
No significant genetic structure of C. sikkimensis was
observed when compared to the genera of the host plant
species. Most haplotypes were found from more than two
individuals, and they were shared among the individuals
of C. sikkimensis collected from different host plant genera
of Fagaceae (Fig. 1b). For example, weevil individuals
with haplotype A were found in the seeds of all types of
host plant genera. Moreover, the AMOVA revealed no
genetic differentiation by the vegetation types that
included host plants (-0.03%, P > 0.10; Table 3) or among
the functional host plant groups (6%, P > 0.10; Table 3).
The results suggest that the differences in living vegetation
zones as well as in utilized host plant species have not

contributed to shaping the present genetic structure of C.
sikkimensis.
The geographical distributions of the recognized mtDNA
haplotypes in C. sikkimensis were highly structured (Fig.
1a). The AMOVA showed strong genetic structure when
grouping the populations according to their geographic
distribution (Table 3). A large proportion (almost 50%, P
< 0.001) of the total genetic variance was explained by differences among regions when comparing three geographical regions (i.e., Kyushu, locality numbers 28â33;
Chugoku to Shikoku, locality numbers 21â27 and 8â12;
and Kinki to Kantou, locality numbers 13â20 and 1â7) as
well as two geographical regions (Kyushu to ChugokuShikoku, and Kinki to Kantou). The SAMOVA revealed
that the value of Î¦CT was larger at K = 2 than at K = 3,
which indicated that partitioning into two groups was
more appropriate. This result suggests that strong genetic
differentiation exists between the southwestern and
northeastern regions of the main islands of Japan.
Comparison of the phylogeographical pattern in C.
sikkimensis and C. hilgendorfi
The haplotype and nucleotide diversities of the main
islands of Japan showed similar values in C. sikkimensis
(Table 2) and C. hilgendorfi (h = 0.964 and Ï = 0.00385,
[24]). Congruent phylogeographical patterns were
observed between C. sikkimensis (Fig. 1) and C. hilgendorfi
(Fig. 2, [24]), with a deep gap between the SW and NE

clades with respect to the mtDNA sequences. Two differences in the phylogeographical patterns were observed
between C. sikkimensis and C. hilgendorfi. The first was the
existence of CS clades in C. sikkimensis in the Chugoku
and Shikoku regions, and the second was the lack of
genetic differentiation in the SW clade of C. sikkimensis
between the coasts of Pacific and the Sea of Japan.

Discussion
Phylogeographical patterns in C. sikkimensis
The observed gap between the SW and NE clades with
respect to the mtDNA sequences of C. sikkimensis (Fig. 1)
suggests that the southwestern and northeastern insect
populations have been isolated for a long time, probably
through several glacial and interglacial periods; the
genetic groups have not been in contact for several thousands of years since the last glacial period; and long-distance migration of the weevil has been rare, resulting in
negligible interpopulation genetic exchange events. This
result suggests past fragmentation of this weevil species
into at least two separate regions. Within the CS clade, the
most common interior haplotype, D, was spread over the
Chugoku and Shikoku regions. Genetic differentiation
between the southwestern, northeastern, and ChugokuShikoku region was detected by the AMOVA. These results
indicate the genetic uniqueness of the weevils distributed
in the Chugoku-Shikoku region. Within the NE clade, a
sub-haplogroup including the interior haplotype E was
observed. These haplotypes also were often found in the

from this population may also reveal genetic uniqueness
of the insects distributed in the Kinki region.
Molecular phylogenetic and ecomorphological studies on
the genus Curculio in Europe and North America have suggested that the seed size of host plants is an important
selective agent for changes in rostrum length and body
size, and thus may be a key factor promoting morphological differentiation [21,34]. In our study, genetic differentiation of C. sikkimensis was not observed among the
associated deciduous and evergreen forests or among host
plant genera of Fagaceae (Table 3, Fig. 1b). These results
suggest that genetic differentiation accompanied by host

specialization among Fagaceae species is not occurring in
C. sikkimensis, which is a uniquely polyphagous weevil
species. Ecological and morphological studies of the weevils and their host plants in populations where various
host plant species are sympatrically distributed may elucidate the evolution of Japanese acorn weevils.
Phylogeographical pattern of the generalist and the hostspecific seed parasitic weevils
A greater genetic differentiation between NE and SW
clades was found for the specialist seed predator C. hilgendorfi compared to the generalist predator C. sikkimensis
(Figs. 1b, 2). This was likely the result of the more limited
geographical distribution of the host plants (Castanopsis)

of the specialist C. hilgendorfi. A geographic boundary of
the mtDNA haplotypes was observed in the ChugokuShikoku region in the two different host types of Curculio.
Such boundaries were also observed in the chloroplast
DNA of several plant species growing in warm and cool
temperate zones in Japan [[5,35], T. Iwasaki et al. unpublished data]. In Europe, the Alps and Pyrenees may have
blocked the dispersal of many animal and tree species
from Italian and Iberian refugia to the northern part of
Europe [reviewed in [10,17]]. However, in the case of the
geographical boundary in the Chugoku-Shikoku region in
Japan, neither a north-south mountain range nor a temperature gap has been observed. Other geographical and
climatic features of the Seto Inland Sea, such as a currently
drier climate and limited on-shore wind, and the historical existence of a grassland landscape during dry cool climates in the glacial ages, might have served as barriers
against recolonization of various species from their refugia.
Two differences in phylogeographical patterns were
observed between C. sikkimensis and C. hilgendorfi. Castanopsis sieboldii var.sieboldii, which is the major host plant
species of C. hilgendorfi, is rarely distributed around the
Seto Inland Sea. In the case of the host-specific seed predator C. hilgendorfi, the lack of distribution of the main host
plant species around the Seto Inland Sea may have
prompted genetic differentiation between C. hilgendorfi
on the Pacific Coast and those on the coast of the Sea of
Japan. In contrast, C. sikkimensis is a generalist seed predator of Fagaceae plants and could migrate across the Seto
Inland Sea using various Fagaceae plant species in the
Chugoku and Shikoku regions. This polyphagous habit
allowed C. sikkimensis to cross the Seto Inland Sea and
also may have generated the intermediate CS clades. A
more detailed history of the area around the Seto Inland
Sea can be estimated by comparing the phylogeographical
patterns of various organisms with diverse geographic distributions and life histories.
Insight into the glacial and postglacial history of
temperate forests in Japan
Little phylogeographical data are available for the host
plant species of these weevils due to the relatively slow
rate of molecular evolution of plant chloroplast DNA [3639], which is usually maternally inherited and thus often
used in molecular phylogeographical studies. Extremely
low levels of intraspecific variation in the chloroplast
DNA of Japanese broadleaved evergreen species [40,41],
including Castanopsis and Lithocarpus, as well as the possible introgression among Quercus species [41-43], have
made it difficult to perform phylogeographical analyses of
host plants. Among these host plant species, a phylogeographical pattern has been reported in deciduous Quercus;
the geographic distribution of cpDNA haplotypes in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/103

deciduous Quercus indicated that one of the haplotypes is
restricted to eastern Japan [44].
In this study C. sikkimensis living both in the broadleaved
deciduous and evergreen forests and C. hilgendorfi living
only in the broadleaved evergreen forests and in several
plant species growing in these forests, shared a common
phylogeographical pattern, with both exhibiting a genetic
gap between the northeastern and southwestern parts of
Japan. The geographic distributions of genetic diversity of
plant species and those of their parasitic insects suggest
that both were restricted to separate southwestern and
northeastern refugia on the main islands of Japan during
repeated glacial periods in the Quaternary. Moreover,
these phytophagous insects, especially flightless or nonmigratory species, likely responded to the environmental
changes associated with the glacial cycles in a fashion similar to that of their host plants. If the plant-insect association (i.e., the host range of the weevil) remained stable
throughout the Quaternary, the presence of the phytophagous insects may be an indicator of the coverage of the
temperate forests. Thus, incorporating phylogeographical
information about herbivorous insect species with that of
their host plant species could more precisely elucidate the
phylogeographical patterns of their associated forests.
We did not find any genetic differentiation in the mtDNA
of C. sikkimensis among their associated host plant species,
which suggests that weevils occupying different host species do not shape host races. Although the size and shape
of the utilized acorns varied among plant species (Fig. 3),
C. sikkimensis can use almost all of these host plant species. Irrespective of the difference in host range between
polyphagous C. sikkimensis and monophagous C. hilgendorfi, the phylogeographical patterns were very similar
between the two species. This similarity is hypothesized to
be due to (1) similar past distributions of refugia between
deciduous oak and evergreen forests, or (2) similar past
host ranges. That is, C. sikkimensis might have been
restricted to evergreen Castanopsis species in the last glacial
age and may have recently expanded its host range independently in each refugium after the last glacial maximum. In the former case, if some populations of C.
sikkimensis survived during the glacial periods within
deciduous oak forests and others in evergreen forests in
different isolated refugia, some host specialization could
have arisen or have been reinforced. The observation that
the weevils inhabiting different acorn species do not
shape host races would suggest that the populations of C.
sikkimensis inhabiting deciduous oak forests and those in
evergreen forests were not isolated during the long glacial
periods. At the last glacial maximum, global sea level is
estimated to have dropped to approximately 140 m lower
than the present level [45]. The narrowing of the Tsushima Strait at that time caused a reduction in the Tsu-

shima warm current into the Sea of Japan, resulting in
further cooling and the aridification of the Japan Archipelago. Given this cool and arid climate, the areas covered by
coniferous forests and cool-mixed forests expanded
southwards [46]. This suggests that both deciduous oak
and evergreen forests were restricted to the adjacent refugia at that time, although it is possible that the association
between the insects and their host plant species could
have established after the glacial period, as suggested by
scenario 2 above. However, it is unlikely that C. sikkimensis expanded its host range to several deciduous and evergreen oak species independently from each refugium as
recently as the last 20,000 years. In addition, in the European Curculio species, closely related weevils (e.g., C.
humeralis, C. pardalis, and C. victoriensis) do not associate
with common host plant species [21].
The coincident patterns of C. sikkimensis and C. hilgendorfi
strongly support the hypothesis that both deciduous oak
and evergreen forest types survived together or adjacent to
one another in small refugia during glacial ages, although
these forests are presently distributed in cool and warm
temperate zones in Japan, respectively. A more detailed
investigation of the pollen records or further genetic studies of organisms living in these types of forests will provide further insight into the evolutionary history of the
broadleaved deciduous and evergreen forests of Japan.

Conclusion
Our data suggest that geology and historical environment
have contributed to shaping the recent genetic structure of
C. sikkimensis in temperate forests of Japan. Comparing
the phylogeographical patterns of two types of phytophagous insects (i.e., a generalist seed predator living in both
the cool and warm temperate zones and the host-specific
seed predator living only in the warm temperate zone)
and of several plant species growing in these temperate
zones of Japan enabled us to specify the historical processes of these forests more precisely. We demonstrated
that during glacial ages the cool and warm temperate forests in Japan survived together, or adjacent to each other,
at least in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the
main islands. Our analyses provide a foundation for studying the evolutionary history of the broadleaved deciduous and evergreen forests in Japan, which characterize the
biodiversity and endemism of the cool and warm temperate zones, where the effects of climate change are particularly severe.
