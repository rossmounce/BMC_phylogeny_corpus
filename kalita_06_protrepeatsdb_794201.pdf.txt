Abstract
Background: Genome wide and cross species comparisons of amino acid repeats is an intriguing
problem in biology mainly due to the highly polymorphic nature and diverse functions of amino acid
repeats. Innate protein repeats constitute vital functional and structural regions in proteins.
Repeats are of great consequence in evolution of proteins, as evident from analysis of repeats in
different organisms. In the post genomic era, availability of protein sequences encoded in different
genomes provides a unique opportunity to perform large scale comparative studies of amino acid
repeats. ProtRepeatsDB http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/repeats/ is a relational database of perfect and
mismatch repeats, access to which is designed as a resource and collection of tools for detection
and cross species comparisons of different types of amino acid repeats.
Description: ProtRepeatsDB (v1.2) consists of perfect as well as mismatch amino acid repeats in
the protein sequences of 141 organisms, the genomes of which are now available. The web
interface of ProtRepeatsDB consists of different tools to perform repeat s; based on protein IDs,
organism name, repeat sequences, and keywords as in FASTA headers, size, frequency, gene
ontology (GO) annotation IDs and regular expressions (REGEXP) describing repeats. These tools
also allow formulation of a variety of simple, complex and logical queries to facilitate mining and
large-scale cross-species comparisons of amino acid repeats. In addition to this, the database also
contains sequence analysis tools to determine repeats in user input sequences.
Conclusion: ProtRepeatsDB is a multi-organism database of different types of amino acid repeats
present in proteins. It integrates useful tools to perform genome wide queries for rapid screening
and identification of amino acid repeats and facilitates comparative and evolutionary studies of the
repeats. The database is useful for identification of species or organism specific repeat markers,
interspecies variations and polymorphism.

Background
The function, type and size of amino acid repeat regions

in proteins are vastly diverse. The amino acid repeats
(hence forth referred as repeats and repeat containing pro-

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:336

teins as repeat proteins) can be functionally neutral or
active, tandem or scattered, and perfect or mismatch.
Repeats may also range from a very minuscule to a highly
significant fraction of proteins. Though functions of a few
types of repeats are known, in general, function and evolution of a large variety of repeats are still poorly understood. Repeats have been broadly classified as perfect and
mismatch repeats. The former class is further subdivided
into homopeptide repeats (reiteration of any single
amino acid, henceforth referred to as homo repeats) and
heteropeptide repeats (repeats with different amino acids,
henceforth referred to as hetero repeats). The mismatch
repeats, consisting of repeats with substituted conserved
amino acids, form the most diverse class of repeats.
Homo repeats containing proteins have been recognized
as cause of several neurodegenerative and congenital malformation diseases. Proteins containing polyglutamine
stretches (polyQ) have been observed in at least eight neural diseases [1]. Similarly, proteins with polyalanine tracts
(polyA) are associated with various congenital malformations, skeletal dysplasia and nervous system anomalies
[2]. Most of such homo repeats arise from trinucleotide
slippage during replication [3,4], leading to proteins with
homopolymeric tracts. Such proteins are either susceptible to misfolding, or aggregation and subsequent degradation, rendering them impaired.
Hetero repeats in proteins are quite diverse. For example,
the glycine-proline amino acid run in eukaryotic
genomes, polar zippers and prion like glutamine/asparagine-rich stretches [5-7], whereas mucins contain arrays of
tandem repeats which are rich in serine and threonine residues corresponding to the most O-glycosylated part of
the mature protein [8].
Functional studies have shown that the insertions of mismatch repetitive regions unique to a species can be indispensable to the functions of proteins, for example as
shown in Plasmodium berghei glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-6-phosphogluconolactonase, a bi-functional
enzyme [9]. The role of repeats in antigenic variation and
immune evasion by pathogens (e.g. Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei and group B Streptococci) has
been elucidated [10-14]. Certain repeats provide structural scaffolds for structural packing of functional groups
of amino acids to facilitate molecular interactions and stabilization. For example, Yeast Sup35p protein contains
five oligopeptide repeats, which stabilizes its aggregation
[15].
Identification of perfect repeats is simpler than that of
mismatch repeats. All strategies to identify mismatch
repeats have some limitation or the other, on account of
polymorphism, low similarity and vast diversity of repeats

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/336

[16]. Most strategies utilize algorithms based on SmithWaterman local alignment, using substitution matrices
[17,18], but some are also aimed to locate low complexity
regions of proteins [19]. It is however clear that no single
algorithm or strategy is sufficient to find all types of
repeats in protein sequences.
Large-scale comparative studies of repeats across kingdoms will be required for better understanding of the role,
diversity and evolution of repetitive sequences in proteins. Such comparisons may also provide deeper insight
into the role of repeats in folding of proteins, immunogenicity and relevance to disease etiology [20]. However,
most studies on repeats, so far, have focused either on a
few classes of proteins in a limited number of organisms
or only a particular type of repeat in different proteins or
organisms [21,22]. Tools which can perform large scale
cross species comparisons of different types of repeats are
not yet developed. Here we present our efforts to build a
robust protein repeats database and tools for large-scale
analysis of repeats in different organisms. ProtRepeatsDB
is a simple relational database to facilitate complex and
large-scale comparative studies of repeats amongst organisms.

Construction and contents
ProtRepeatsDB is based on an underlying pipeline, shown
in the Figure 1a. Repeats were identified using a script that
automates sequence retrieval and execution of various
repeat finders. All protein sequences used in the present
study were obtained from the Reference Sequences (RefSeq) database [23] of NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). It has been reported that for a
protein of average size and composition, a run of an individual amino acid is statistically significant only if it is five
or more residues long [24]. Hence, we used a cutoff size of
five to identify repeats. A PERL program (DIREP) was used
to detect tandem or scattered- hetero and homo repeats of
size greater than or equal to five. Similarly, a different
PERL code was used to detect homo repeats of size greater
than five and less than ten. The mismatch repeats were
identified using PROSPERO [25], which performs comparison of each sequence to itself, and prints all self alignments with p-values less than a predefined threshold.
PROSITE patterns or profiles representing different amino
acid repeats were identified using PFSCAN [26]. All the
identified repeats and corresponding details were stored
in a MySQL database. A large number of entries in the
database were redundant, as several internal repeats
which are part of larger repeats are detected as unique
repeats. For example in the knob associated histidine rich
protein (RefSeq:NP_472949) of P. falciparum, the repeats
like KKKSK, KKKSKK, KKKSKKHKDN etc. were identified
as separate repeats- whereas the longest repeat alone represents all the internal repeats. However, since such inter-

nal repeats may be conserved in other proteomes, this
redundancy was removed by performing comparison of
each repeat against the entire database for occurrence
other than the self. The internal repeats were retained in
the database only if present in at least one protein other
than the self protein containing the repeat, otherwise only
the longest stretch of the repeat, which represents all the
internal repeats, was retained. This procedure significantly
reduced the redundancy as well as the size of the database,
without loosing any information regarding conservation
of the repeats in different sequences and organisms.

Utility and discussion
The ProtRepeatsDB and related tools facilitate retrieval
and analysis of repeats in the database through different
query pages and different sections. On submitting a query,
a summary page of repeats satisfying the search conditions is generated. The summary page consists of a brief
description of the sequences containing the repeat, such
as the organism name, protein ID (hyperlinked to corresponding NCBI RefSeq entry), amino acids constituting
the repeat, repeat size, repeat frequency, positions of the
repeat in protein sequence (referred to as coordinates)
hyperlinked to a detailed view, and E-value etc. (Figure
1b). Upon clicking coordinates of a repeat in the summary
page, detailed information of the corresponding repeat is
displayed as a new page consisting of two frames. The top
frame consists of a dynamically generated color graph
illustrating relative distribution of the repeat in the protein, followed by the sequence of the protein with repeats
highlighted in red. In addition to this, links are provided
to retrieve the sequence in FASTA format, perform repeat
analysis using PROSPERO [25], DOTMATCHER [27], PfScan and BLAST [28] against ProtRepeatsDB. This section
also provides links to display PROSITE matches, mismatch repeats and graphical representation of all the identified repeats in the protein sequence. The lower frame
lists all the ProtRepeatsDB sequence entries sharing the
same repeat.
The "REGEXP search" section accepts user-defined regular
expressions to query the database. The regular expressions
may either include patterns of single letter amino acid
codes or patterns of predefined group codes based on similar physicochemical properties of amino acids. The
details of predefined codes and groups are enumerated in
the regular expressions query page (Figure 2a). For example, one can search the mismatch repeat section for prion
repeat patterns 'P [HQ] [GS]G{1,3}WGQ', the octapeptide tandem repeat pattern associated with many neurological disorders like spongiform encephalopathies and
dementia [29-31]. We used "REGEXP search" tool to
query homo repeats section for glutamine and glycine
homo repeats (also referred as polyQ and polyG respectively) (Figure 2a) repeats in rat, mouse and human pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/336

teomes. In the summary output page (not shown here),
the NCBI RefSeq entry (RefSeq:21322252) corresponds to
human androgen receptors (ARs). The human AR protein
is characterized by presence of polyQ and polyG repeats,
which are associated with gene polymorphisms, cryptorchidism [32] and a risk factor for prostate cancer [33].
However, we found that polyQ is absent in mouse AR and
polyG is absent in both mouse (RefSeq:7304901) and rat
(RefSeq:6978535) orthologous ARs (Figure 2b).
The comparative search section provides tools to compare
repeats in multiple organisms using Boolean (AND or
NOT) operators. For instance, by using 'AND' operator,
one can find repeats common in different sets of organisms. Similarly, the "NOT" operator can be used to obtain
a list of repeats which are mutually exclusive in user
defined sets of organisms. Using the tools to search
PROSITE repeats section, we investigated bacterial proteins with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), a structural
repeat motif present in a wide range of proteins [34,35]
and believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions and assembly of multi protein complexes [36,37].
We found that the TPR containing orthologs of Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6 [RefSeq:27367908], Vibrio parahaemolyticus [RefSeq:28901310] and V. vulnificus YJ016
[RefSeq:37676035] contain tandem glutamine repeats
downstream from the TPR motifs. However, multiple
alignments of the sequences revealed that the glutamine
run is smaller in Vibrio cholerae [RefSeq:15600941] or
interspersed, as in Vibrio augustum [RefSeq:90577283]
and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 [RefSeq:24374614]. Significance of the glutamine homo repeats in Vibrio proteins
is not clear; however such glutamine repeats are known to
induce formation of quasi-aggregates in the early stage of
amyloid protein fibrillization [38] and inhibition of protein degradation [39] in various proteins associated with
human neurodegenerative disease.
Overall analysis of homo repeat proteins in different proteomes was performed by dividing them into two groups
of varying repeat sizes and frequency of occurrence. First
group consists of proteins with smaller homo repeats of
size less than ten, occurring one or more times in a protein
sequence. Second group consists of proteins with longer
homo repeats of size ten and greater, occurring more than
once in a protein sequence. Table 1 summarizes the comparative distribution of homo repeat proteins in different
proteomes in the two groups mentioned above. The table
lists first five and first three proteomes, if ordered according to decreasing percentages of proteins in the first and
second group, respectively. The second group list was
restricted to first three organisms only, mainly because of
the fact that there are not many proteins which contain
extremely large as well as repeating homo repeats. For
homo repeats of each of the amino acids, the correspond-

Table 1: Relative distribution of homo repeats (tandem or scattered) of size <10 (occurring one or more times) and ≥10 (occurring more than once). The figures within round
brackets represent the number of homo repeat proteins of corresponding amino acid and organism. The figures within square brackets represent percentage of homo repeat
proteins of corresponding amino acid and organism, to that of all the homo repeat proteins in the organism.

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:336

ing number of protein sequences (brackets) as percentage
of all the homo repeats in the organism is listed (square
brackets). Table 1 brings out certain interesting facts, for
example amino acid preference for homo repeats in different organisms. The asparagine homo repeats are most
abundant in P. falciparum proteins. In P. falciparum proteome, we found that 1675 proteins contain asparagine
homo repeats of size less than ten, and as many as 280
proteins P. falciparum proteins have asparagine repeats of
size ten and above, occurring more than once. The proteins with asparagine repeats constitute around 31 percent
of the total annotated proteins in the parasite. The abundance of asparagines repeats has been correlated with
many prion-like domains in the parasite genome [40]. We
also found that the proteins with lysine homo repeats also
constitute a large percentage (47 percent) of homo repeat
containing proteins in P. falciparum, which is 21 percent
of all the annotated proteins in the genome. However,
there are only two P. falciparum proteins with lysine homo
repeats in the second group. The ProtRepeatsDB comparative tools also reveal that the number of glutamic acid
homo repeat proteins is higher than those containing
aspartic acid in all the eukaryotes, except P. falciparum.
Glutamine homo repeat proteins are most abundant in D.
melanogaster, accounted by 1582 proteins, which is 34 percent of all the homo repeat proteins in the genome. The
polar glutamine repeats are primarily present in proteins
that are involved in transcription-translational activities
especially proteins interacting with DNA and other proteins. Proline homo repeats of size ten and greater are
present in thirteen proteins of H. sapiens, ten A. thaliana
proteins, and four M. musculus proteins. One class of such
proteins includes formin-like proteins, common to the
above three organisms, which are involved in processes
such as morphogenesis, embryonic differentiation, cell
polarity, and cytokinesis [41]. The proline-rich regions of
formin-like proteins are believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions as exemplified by the crystal
structure of the binding domain in formin binding protein (FBP11) with specific binding to PPLPp motifs in the
formins [42].
The use of ProtRepeatsDB in comparative analysis of
homo repeat proteins in related species is perhaps best
illustrated by comparison of such repeats in H. sapiens, R.
norvegicus and M. musculus. The most abundant homo
repeat proteins in human, mouse and rat have repeats of
glutamic acid, proline, leucine, alanine, glutamine, glycine, serine or lysine residues. Homo repeat proteins containing repeats of isoleucine, asparagine and valine are
miniscule in H. sapiens and related species. Number of
phenylalanine homo repeat proteins in M. musculus is relatively higher than those in rat and human proteomes.
The percentage of cysteine, methionine and arginine

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/336

homo repeat protein is almost same in all the three organisms. There is no tyrosine homo repeat protein in rat and
mouse; however, there is one tyrosine homo repeat in a H.
sapiens helicase protein. The mixed-lineage leukemia proteins of human, which are also trithorax homologs of Drosophila, have homo repeats of serine, glutamic acid,
proline and glycine. A human and mouse ortholog of the
protein has a serine run of forty two and thirty amino acid
residues respectively, however the run is absent in the corresponding rat ortholog. The non trithorax homologs in
human mixed-lineage leukemia proteins also lack serine
runs.
The Table 1 also reveals that there is no histidine, cysteine,
tyrosine, isoleucine and tryptophan homo repeat falling
under second group, encoded in any of the genomes. The
rare methionine homo repeats have been observed in proteins belonging to A. thaliana, A. gambiae and P. falciparum. In fact, a CHP-rich zinc finger protein (CHP-rich:
cysteine, histidine and proline rich) of A. thaliana contains
methionine repeat of size 11, which also happens to be
the longest homo repeat of methionine in the database.
Phenylalanine and tyrosine repeats are present in several
P. falciparum hypothetical proteins and putative proteins
like succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha subunit, syntaxin, Ser/
Thr protein kinase, sequestrin and acid phosphatase. Glycine homo repeat proteins are ubiquitously present in
almost all super kingdoms. The mycobacterial parasite M.
bovis has the highest number of alanine homo repeat proteins, representing 64.5 percent of its homo repeat proteins and nearly 4.8 percent of annotated proteins in the
genome.
Statistical analysis of ProtRepeatsDB is in agreement with
the earlier observation that the percentage of perfect
repeat containing repeat proteins is higher in eukaryotes
than in prokaryotes and archeals (Figure 3a). Our analysis
indicates that hetero repeat proteins also follow a similar
trend, although, homo repeats are a predominant feature
of the eukaryotic genomes (Figure 3a). Similarly, the
PROSITE profiles representing repeats are mainly found
in eukaryotes. The high percentage of mismatch repeats
amongst all super kingdoms indicates duplication events
during evolution.
Figure 3b–d, is a graphical representation of perfect
repeats in representative proteomes. Figure 3b gives the
distribution of repeat proteins in the eukaryotes, which
indicates that P. falciparum has an unusual distribution of
repeats in comparison with other eukaryotes; it is the only
organism with more than 50% of its proteome constituted
by proteins containing different kinds of repeats. Since
one of the important role of repeat proteins is believed to
be in immune evasion by the parasites, we investigated
the nature of repeats in immuno dominant proteins in P.

falciparum, and we found that the parasite antigens are not
only rich in homo repeats, several of these proteins are
also marked by abundance of hetero repeats. We also
found that twenty one antigens of the parasite also have
hetero repeats of size ten or greater. Noticeably, most of
these hetero repeat regions are rich in charged or polar
amino acids, which are known to play important role in
antigen-antibody or antigen-carrier protein interactions.
There are several such examples, including that of the Santigen in P. falciparum, which is characterized by the
presence of two similar repeats of sixty nine residues each,
forming the coiled and surface exposed regions of the proteins. Similarly, other plasmodium antigens such as the
LSA (liver stage antigen), antigen 332, MESA (mature-parasite- infected erythrocyte surface antigen) or PfEMP2 (P.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 2) and FIRA
(interspersed repeat antigen) also have large inserts of hetero repeats. MESA and ring-infected erythrocyte antigen
are surface exposed antigens rich in glutamic acid and
lysine residues. Some of these antigens are also being
developed as vaccines [43].
Amongst other eukaryotes, we found abundant repeat
proteins in O. sativa, H. sapiens, D. melanogastor and Neurospora crassa. Interestingly, N. crassa and O. Sativa are the
only organisms in the database, in which the percentage
of homo repeat proteins exceeds that of hetero perfect
repeat proteins. In Guillardia theta and Encephalitozoon
cuniculi, the percentage of all types of perfect repeat proteins is almost the same as that of perfect hetero repeat
proteins alone, which implies that the number of homo
repeat proteins is quite less and in fact lowest amongst the
eukaryotes studied here. However, it is warned that several
RefSeq genomes are still under review and contain several
proteins sequences yet to be verified, and G. theta and E.
cuniculi genomes are examples of such genomes.
Rat and mouse proteins have lower number of perfect
repeat proteins as compared to human proteome (Figure
3b). However, percentage of homo repeat proteins in rat
and mouse are almost same and only marginally lower
than that of humans, implying that the human proteome
is richer in proteins with hetero repeats. It might have
some implications regarding the observation that the generation of repeats promote protein evolution [44] and formation of novel functional variants [45,46]. We observed
differential distribution of repeats in other closely related
species as well, for example Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S.
pombe have almost equal fraction of repeat proteins, however, the percentage of homo repeat proteins is considerably higher in S. cerevisiae (11%) as compared to S. pombe
(~7%)(Figure 3b).

percentage of repeat proteins in prokaryotes is observed in
Thermus thermophilus (~29%) followed by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis Rv (~28%) whereas Salmonella typhi contains
the lowest number of repeat proteins not only amongst
prokaryotes, but in all the proteomes studied here (Figure
3c). It is interesting to note that M. tuberculosis Rv has
higher percentage of repeat proteins as compared to that
in other mycobacterium species, namely M. bovis and
Mycobacterium avium. All the mycobacterial species except
Mycobacterium leprae, predominantly have alanine, glycine
and proline homo repeat proteins. Alanine repeats are
abundant in PPE (proteins with proline-prolineglutamine motifs) family and a few PE-PGRS proteins
(proteins with proline-glutamine motifs and polymorphic GC-rich repetitive sequences) [47] of M. tuberculosis
Rv and M. bovis. However, all M. avium alanine homo
repeat proteins are hypothetical proteins except two: one
PE family protein and a PstA (phosphate-specific transport subunit A) protein. M. leprae has the lowest percentage of repeat proteins amongst mycobacterium genomes
in the database mainly due to lower numbers of PPE family homologs. The glycine repeats are exclusively present
in PE-PGRS proteins of M. tuberculosis Rv and M. bovis but
absent in M. avium and M. leprae. The PE-PGRS is a newly
identified family of fibronectin-binding proteins involved
in antigenic variation. The number of glycine repeat proteins in M. avium and M. leprae is much less as compared
to that in the other two species. All the four species of
mycobacterium have proline repeats, mainly in the proline-rich antigens. Repetitive regions have been used as
genetic markers for the strain differentiation and epidemiology of mycobacterium species [48,49]. It will be interesting to perform systematic comparative investigation of
different types of repeats in the species and investigate
possible roles of repeats in specific interactions with their
hosts.
Amongst the archeal genomes, the percentage of total
repeat proteins is highest in Halobacterium (~21%) followed by Aeropyrum pernix and the lowest in Archaeoglobus
fulgidus (~7%) (Figure 3d). Notably, we found that all
archeal proteomes have lower number of homo repeat
proteins. The highest percentage of homo repeat proteins
is observed in Halobacterium sps. (~4%) and lowest in A.
fulgidus (~1%). During evolution, archeal genomes
mainly accumulated hetero repeat proteins but the resistance towards evolution of homo repeat proteins or mechanism of specific selection of hetero duplication in
genomes is not yet known. A detailed and comprehensive
analysis of different types of repeats in the three super
kingdoms as well as intra-kingdom might provide leads to
answers of many open questions, which are, however,
beyond the scope of the present study.

The percentage of repeat proteins in prokaryotic genomes
is lower as compared to that in eukaryotes. The highest

The ProtRepeatsDB contains tools for large-scale comparison of protein repeats across genomes to aid studies
related to evolution of repeat genesis and functional roles
of such repeats in different organisms. The differential
propensity of repeats among the super kingdoms/lineages
and organisms within the same kingdom/genus emphasizes that different types of repeats have undergone different selection pressure and propagation mechanisms
during evolution. However, conclusions derived from
analysis of sequences emerging from the sequencing
projects with little or no manual curation or additional
experimental validation of gene structure have to be dealt
with additional care, as some of such sequences may have
translations from incorrect gene predictions.

Conclusion
ProtRepeatsDB is a multi-organism database of protein
repeats, which is the first database of its kind that incorporates different kinds of repeats viz. perfect repeatshomopeptides and heteropeptides, mismatch repeats and
profile patterns representing different families of repeats.
The current version (v 1.2) consists of 120686 perfect
repeats, 834621 mismatch repeats and 3673 profile
repeats from 894890 protein sequences belonging to 141
genomes. The web interface of ProtRepeatsDB consists of
unique tools which allow formulation of queries for
retrieval and cross species comparison of repeats.
