Conclusion: By using microarray expression data for Arabidopsis thaliana, we show that the mode
of duplication, the function of the genes involved, and the time since duplication play important
roles in the divergence of gene expression and, therefore, in the functional divergence of genes
after duplication.

Recent studies have revealed a surprisingly large number of
duplicated genes in eukaryotic genomes [1,2]. Many of these
duplicated genes seem to have been created in large-scale, or

even genome-wide duplication events [3,4]. Whole genome
duplication is particularly prominent in plants and most of
the angiosperms are believed to be ancient polyploids, including a large proportion of our most important crops such as

Results: Duplicates that have been created by large-scale duplication events and that can still be
found in duplicated segments have expression patterns that are more correlated than those that
were created by small-scale duplications or those that no longer lie in duplicated segments.
Moreover, the former tend to have highly redundant or overlapping expression patterns and are
mostly expressed in the same tissues, while the latter show asymmetric divergence. In addition, a
strong bias in divergence of gene expression was observed towards gene function and the biological

Background: Genome analyses have revealed that gene duplication in plants is rampant.
Furthermore, many of the duplicated genes seem to have been created through ancient genomewide duplication events. Recently, we have shown that gene loss is strikingly different for large- and
small-scale duplication events and highly biased towards the functional class to which a gene
belongs. Here, we study the expression divergence of genes that were created during large- and
small-scale gene duplication events by means of microarray data and investigate both the influence
of the origin (mode of duplication) and the function of the duplicated genes on expression

wheat, maize, soybean, cabbage, oat, sugar cane, alfalfa,
potato, coffee, cotton and tobacco [5-8]. For over 100 years,
gene and genome duplications have been linked to the origin
of evolutionary novelties, because it provides a source of
genetic material on which evolution can work ([9] and references therein). In general, four possible fates are usually
acknowledged for duplicated genes. The most likely fate is
gene loss or nonfunctionalization [1,10-12], while in rare
cases one of the two duplicates acquires a new function (neofunctionalization) [13]. Subfunctionalization, in which both
gene copies lose a complementary set of regulatory elements
and thereby divide the ancestral gene's original functions,
forms a third potential fate [14-17]. Finally, retention is recognized for two gene copies that, instead of diverging in function, remain largely redundant and provide the organism
with increased genetic robustness against harmful mutations
[18-20].
The functional divergence of duplicated genes has been
extensively studied at the sequence level to investigate
whether genes evolve at faster rates after duplication, or are
under positive or purifying selection [21-26]. The recent
availability of functional genomics data, such as expression
data from whole-genome microarrays, opens up completely
novel ways to investigate the divergence of duplicated genes,
and several studies using such data have already provided
intriguing new insights into gene fate after duplication. In
yeast, for instance, Gu and co-workers [27] found a significant correlation between the rate of coding sequence evolution and divergence of expression and showed that most
duplicated genes in this organism quickly diverge in their
expression patterns. In addition, they showed that expression
divergence increases with evolutionary time. Makova and Li
[28] analyzed spatial expression patterns of human duplicates and came to the same conclusions. They calculated the
proportion of gene pairs with diverged expression in different
tissues, and found evidence for an approximately linear relationship with sequence divergence. Wagner [29] showed that
the functional divergence of duplicated genes is often asymmetrical because one duplicate frequently shows significantly
more molecular or genetic interactions/functions than the
other. Adams and co-workers [30] examined the expression
of 40 gene pairs duplicated by polyploidy in natural and synthetic tetraploid cotton and showed that, although many pairs
contributed equally to the transcriptome, a high percentage
exhibited reciprocal silencing and biased expression and were
developmentally regulated. In a few cases, genes duplicated
through polyploidy events were reciprocally silenced in different organs, suggesting subfunctionalization.
In Arabidopsis, Blanc and Wolfe [31] investigated the expression patterns of genes that arose through gene duplication
and found that about 62% of the recent duplicates acquired
divergent expression patterns, which is in agreement with
previous observations in yeast and human. In addition, they
identified several cases of so-called 'concerted divergence',

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/2/R13

where single members of different duplicated genes diverge
in a correlated way, resulting in parallel networks that are
expressed in different cell types, developmental stages or
environmental conditions. Also in Arabidopsis, Haberer et al.
[32] studied the divergence of genes that originated through
tandem and segmental duplications by using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) data and concluded that,
besides a significant portion of segmentally and tandemly
duplicated genes with similar expression, the expression of
more than two-thirds of the duplicated genes diverged in
expression. However, expression divergence and divergence
time were not significantly correlated, as opposed to findings
in human and yeast (see above). In a small-scale study on regulatory genes in Arabidopsis, Duarte et al. [33] performed an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and showed that 85% of the
280 paralogs exhibit a significant gene by organ interaction
effect, indicative of sub- and/or neofunctionalization. Ancestral expression patterns inferred across a type II MADS box
gene phylogeny indicated several cases of regulatory neofunctionalization and organ-specific nonfunctionalization.
In conclusion, recent findings demonstrate that a majority of
duplicated genes acquire different expression patterns
shortly after duplication. However, whether the fate of a
duplicated gene also depends on its function is far less understood. The model plant Arabidopsis has a well-annotated
genome and, in addition to many small-scale duplication
events, there is compelling evidence for three genome duplications in its evolutionary past [34-37], hereafter referred to
as 1R, 2R, and 3R. Recently, a nonrandom process of gene
loss subsequent to these different polyploidy events has been
postulated [12,31,38]. Maere et al. [12] have shown that gene
decay rates following duplication differ considerably between
different functional classes of genes, indicating that the fate of
a duplicated gene largely depends on its function. Here, we
study the expression divergence of genes that were created
during both large- and small-scale gene duplication events by
means of two compiled microarray datasets. The influence of
the origin (mode of duplication) and the function of the duplicated genes on expression divergence are investigated.

First, we investigated whether the mode of duplication that
gives rise to the duplicate gene pairs affects expression divergence. Interestingly, for both younger (Figure 2a) and older
(Figure 2b) duplicates, anchor points showed a significantly
higher correlation in expression than non-anchor points (p
values of 2.49e-07 and 1.67e-08 for young and old genes,
respectively). Even for the younger duplicates the difference
is striking (Figure 2a). We explored the second dataset on tissue-specific expression and first considered the absolute
number of tissues in which genes are expressed, resembling
the expression breadth (see Materials and methods). Regard-

Divergence of expression and mode of duplication

The current study clearly shows that duplicated genes that are
part of still recognizable duplicated segments (so-called
anchor points) show higher correlation in gene expression
than duplicates that do not lie in paralogons, despite their
similar ages. In addition, the former have highly redundant or
overlapping expression patterns, as they are mostly expressed
in the same tissues. This is in contrast with what is observed
for the non-anchor point genes, where asymmetric divergence is more widespread. There might be several explanations for these observations. The set of non-anchor point
genes include genes created by tandem duplication, transpositional duplication, or genes translocated after segmental
duplication events. One explanation might lie in different
gene duplication mechanisms. Single-gene duplications,
mostly caused by unequal crossing-over and duplicative
transposition [40], are much more prone to promoter disruption than genes duplicated through polyploidy events, which

ing anchor points, both genes are usually expressed in a high
number of tissues (Figure 3a). This is only partly true for nonanchor points (or genes assumed to have been created in
small-scale duplications), where many duplicates are
expressed in a much smaller number of tissues (shown for
young duplicates in Figure 3b). To further discriminate
between redundancy, complementarity and asymmetric
divergence, and thus to investigate if genes are expressed in
the same tissues, we computed the relative number of tissues
a gene is expressed in, which is the number of tissues in which
a gene is expressed divided by the total number of tissues in
which either one of the two duplicates is expressed. As schematically represented in Figure 4, two duplicated genes that
remain co-expressed in the same tissues will both have a relative number equal to 1 (redundant genes; Figure 4a),
whereas asymmetrically diverged genes, where one gene is
expressed in a very small number of tissues as opposed to its
duplicate that is expressed in a high number of tissues, can be
identified by relative numbers close to 0 and close to 1,
respectively (Figure 4b). The intermediate situation, where
two duplicate genes are expressed in an equal number of different tissues, will result in both copies having a relative
number equal to 0.5 (Figure 4c). When assuming that the
ancestral gene was expressed in all tissues in which the two
duplicate genes are expressed, the latter case hints at subfunctionalization after duplication. Figure 3c,d shows these
relative numbers for 3R anchor points and non-anchor
points, respectively, and show that redundancy is much more
common among anchor points (Figure 3c) than among nonanchor points (Figure 3d) of similar ages. Moreover, gene
pairs resulting from small-scale duplications not only seem to
have diverged more often than those created by segmental or
genome duplications, but they also have diverged asymmetrically, where one gene is expressed in a high number of tissues,
as opposed to its duplicate that is expressed in a small
number of tissues (Figure 3d, top left and bottom right). Similar findings on tissue-specific expression were observed for
the 1R/2R genes (results not shown).

In addition, the first dataset was used to identify possible
biases toward gene function. The expression correlation of
duplicated gene pairs, represented by the Spearman correlation coefficient, was studied in relation to the age of duplication, represented by KS (amount of synonymous substitutions
per synonymous site) for genes belonging to different functional categories (GO slim, see Materials and methods).

Results and discussion

To examine general gene expression divergence patterns, we
analyzed two datasets containing genome-wide microarray
data for Arabidopsis genes (see Materials and methods). The
first consisted of 153 Affymetrix ATH1 slides with expression
data of various perturbation and knockout experiments (see
Additional data file 1). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was computed between the two expression patterns of
every duplicated gene pair. To investigate whether divergence
of gene expression varies for duplicates that were created by
small-scale or large-scale (genome-wide) events, the complete set of duplicated genes was subdivided into different
subgroups and their expression correlation was examined
(see Materials and methods; Figure 1). We refer to anchor
genes as duplicated genes that are still lying in recognizable
duplicated segments. Such anchor-point genes, and consequently the segments in which they reside, are regarded as
being created in large-scale duplication events. Six different
sets of genes were distinguished: one set containing duplicates with ages corresponding to 1R/2R (1.5 ≤ Ks ≤ 3.7), further subdivided into two sets of anchor and non-anchor
points, and one set of younger duplicates with ages corresponding to 3R (0.4 ≤ Ks ≤ 1.0), again subdivided into two sets
of anchor and non-anchor points (see Materials and methods). Differences in expression divergence between anchor
points and non-anchor points were evaluated by comparing
their distributions of correlation coefficients using a Mann
Whitney U test (see Materials and methods). We further
explored the difference between both classes of genes by
means of a second dataset on tissue-specific expression (see
Materials and methods and Additional data file 2) [39]. Here,
for each of the subgroups of duplicates described above we
calculated present/absent calls in the 63 different tissues and
computed both the absolute and relative amount of tissues in
which the two genes of a duplicated gene pair are expressed.

might lead to the altered (or observed asymmetric) expression of genes after small-scale gene duplication events. Similarly, translocation of genes that originated from large-scale
duplication events can also disrupt promoters, again contributing to the overall increase of expression divergence [41,42].
Alternatively, the higher correlation of anchor points might
result directly from co-expression of neighboring genes,
regardless of their involvement in the same pathway, as
shown recently by Williams and Bowles [43]. It was also
shown that genome organization, and more in particular the
chromatin structure, can affect gene expression [43-48]. Such
additional structural and functional constraints might, therefore, reduce the freedom to diverge and, as a consequence,
cause the expression patterns of genes in duplicated regions
to remain similar, as observed here. Related to our observations, Rodin et al. ([49] and references therein) reported that
position effects play an important role in the evolution of gene
duplicates. Repositioning of a duplicate to an ectopic site is
proposed to epigenetically modify its expression pattern,
along with the rate and direction of mutations. This repositioning is believed to rescue redundant anchor point genes
from pseudogenization and accelerate their evolution
towards new developmental stage-, time-, and tissue-specific
expression patterns [49].
As previously stated, non-anchor point genes not only appear
to show higher expression divergence than anchor-point
genes, they appear to diverge asymmetrically, where one gene
is expressed in a high number of tissues, while its duplicate is
expressed in a lower number of tissues. It should be noted
that we cannot establish whether one duplicate is becoming
highly specialized and dedicated to a very small number of tissues or whether it is losing much of its functionality (that is,
turning into a pseudogene), nor can we distinguish between
the gain of expression in new tissues for one gene versus the

loss of expression for the other gene duplicate, as we would
therefore need to know the expression pattern of the ancestral
gene. In this respect, it is interesting to note that it is currently
not known whether the ancient genome doublings in (the
ancestor of) A. thaliana resulted from auto- or allopolyploidization. In the former case, the anchor point duplicates are in
fact real paralogs, while in the latter case the expression of the
two gene copies might have (slightly) differed from the start
([50,51] and references therein). Nevertheless, our data
clearly show that the duplicates that still lie in duplicated segments show high expression correlation and have highly overlapping expression patterns, as opposed to those that arose
through small-scale duplication events or have been translocated afterwards.
In concordance with the results discussed above, Wagner [29]
described asymmetric divergence of duplicated genes in the
unicellular organism Saccharomyces cerivisiae. He reported
that both the number of stressors to which two duplicates
respond and the number of genes that are affected by the
knockout of paralogous genes are asymmetric. He therefore
proposed an evolutionary model in which the probability that
a loss-of-function mutation has a deleterious effect is greatest
if the two duplicates have diverged symmetrically. Asymmetric divergence of genes therefore leads to increased robustness against deleterious mutations. This seems to be
confirmed by our results. Indeed, also in A. thaliana, asymmetric divergence, rather than symmetric divergence, seems
to be the fate for two duplicates, at least when they do not lie
in duplicated segments.

Divergence of expression and gene function
Next, we studied how the expression correlation, measured as
the Spearman correlation coefficient, changes over time for
genes of ages up to a KS of 3.7. Loess smoothers, which locally

with hydrolase activity (Additional data file 3). Interestingly,
genes of many of these classes are involved in reactions
against environmental changes or stress (signal transduction,
cell communication, response to external and biotic stimuli
and stress, lipid metabolism), which might suggest that Arabidopsis (or better its ancestors) quickly put these newborn
genes into use by means of altered and diverged expression
patterns, as compared to their ancestral copy, to survive and
cope with environmental changes.

as time increases, and saturates at a certain time point. Interestingly, considerable differences can be observed between
genes belonging to different functional classes (Figure 5;
Additional data file 3). For example, genes that are involved
in signal transduction and response to external stimulus
appear to have diverged very quickly after duplication (Figure

tissues, while its duplicate remains expressed in the original six tissues, or (c) diverge symmetrically, where tissue-specific expression is complementarily
lost between both duplicates. The absolute number of tissues in which a gene is expressed is six for both duplicates in (a) and for the second duplicate in
(b), one for the first duplicate in (b) and three for both duplicates in (c). The total number of tissues in which the pair is expressed is 6 in all three cases.
The relative number is the fraction of the previous two, and is 1 for the two genes in (a) and for the second duplicate in (b), 0.17 for the first duplicate in
(b) and 0.5 for both duplicates in (c).

Slowly diverging expression patterns were found for proteins
involved in, for example, macromolecule biosynthesis (Figure
5c) and structural molecule activity (Figure 5d) as reflected in
the large number of young gene pairs with high correlation
coefficients. Analogous trends can be observed for other
functional classes containing genes involved in cell organization and biogenesis, nucleic acid, macromolecule, protein and
primary metabolism, biosynthesis and response to endogenous stimulus (Additional data file 3). Apparently, although
duplicated genes within these classes are being retained, their
fast diversification at the expression level is selected against,
probably due to the essential nature and sensitive regulation
of these highly conserved processes. Other classes of genes,
like those having nucleotide binding capacity (Figure 5e) and
those involved in regulation of biological processes (Figure
5f), show moderate divergence rates. The DNA binding, transcription, protein modification, and genes with catalytic,
transcription factor and transporter activity (Additional data
file 3) classes of genes show similar divergence patterns. We
also tested whether the divergence patterns described above
are significantly different from each other by interchanging
the fitted models between functional classes (fit the locfit line

of a particular class to the data of another class) and evaluating the model quality. Our results confirmed that there are
indeed significant differences between slowly, moderately
and quickly diverging genes (results not shown).
As opposed to Haberer et al. [32], but in agreement with Gu
et al. [27] and Makova and Li [28], who described expression
divergence of duplicated genes in yeast and human, respectively, we here show that in Arabidopsis, expression patterns
of duplicates diverge as time increases. In addition, the rate of
divergence seems to be highly dependent on the molecular
function of the gene or the biological process in which it is
involved. The rate of expression divergence ranges from very
slow, for highly conserved proteins, such as ribosomal proteins, or genes involved in conserved processes, such as biosynthesis pathways or photosynthesis, to very quickly, for
instance genes involved in adaptation to and reaction against
changing environments.
Note that, because we removed expression data of genes without a unique probeset (see Materials and methods), there are
actually more young duplicates than the ones that were

plotted in Figure 5. Although the current microarray technology does not allow measuring their expression, we can
assume that their presence would increase the overall correlation, especially in the low value range of KS. As the difficulty
to design a gene-specific probeset is not related to the functional class, we assume that all functional classes suffer from
this caveat to the same extent and that the differences we
observe are reliable.

Conclusion

Investigating gene and genome duplication events as well as
the subsequent functional divergence of genes is of fundamental importance in the understanding of evolution and
adaptation of organisms. Previously, large-scale gene duplication events have been shown to be prominent in different
plant species. Only recently, a pattern of gene retention after
duplication has emerged that is biased towards function, time
and mode of duplication [5,12,38]. For instance, genes
involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation
were shown to have been preferentially retained after largescale duplication events, while genes of other important functional categories (such as DNA metabolism and cell cycle)
were lost [5,12,38]. Still other categories of genes, such as
those involved in secondary metabolism, are highly retained
after small-scale gene duplication [12]. Here, we have studied
the expression divergence of these retained duplicates by
means of the genome-wide microarray expression data available for Arabidopsis genes. As clearly shown in the current
study, there is not only a bias in the retention of genes after
duplication events, but also in the rate of divergence of
expression for different functional categories of genes. Surprisingly, this bias is much more outspoken for genes created
by small-scale duplication events than for genes that have
been created through large-scale segmental or entire genome
duplication events. The latter genes, provided they are still
found in duplicated segments, show much higher expression
correlation and highly overlapping expression patterns compared to those duplicates that are created by small-scale
duplication events or that no longer lie in duplicated
segments.

fore, to reflect the overall mutation rate. First, all pairwise
alignments of the paralogous nucleotide sequences belonging
to a gene family were made by using CLUSTALW [54], with
the corresponding protein sequences as alignment guides.
Gaps and adjacent divergent positions in the alignments were
subsequently removed. KS estimates were then obtained with
the CODEML program [55] of the PAML package [56]. Codon
frequencies were calculated from the average nucleotide frequencies at the three codon positions (F3 × 4), whereas a consubstitutions
per
stant
KN/KS (nonsynonymous
nonsynonymous site over synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, reflecting selection pressure) was assumed
(codon model 0) for every pairwise comparison. Calculations
were repeated five times to avoid incorrect KS estimations
because of suboptimal local maxima.
To compare expression patterns of duplicated genes that had
arisen through genome duplication events with those created
in small-scale duplication events, the complete set of duplicated genes was subdivided into six different subgroups (Figure 1), namely:
1. Set 1 containing all genes that are assumed to have been
duplicated at a time coinciding with the most recent (3R)
polyploidy event.
2. Set 2 containing all genes that are assumed to have been
duplicated at a time coinciding with the two (1R/2R) older
polyploidy events.
3. Set 3 is a subset of Set 1 and only contains the anchor points
(pairs of duplicated genes that still lie on so-called paralogons
[34], homologous duplicated segments that still show conserved gene order and content). These genes are thus
assumed to have been created by 3R.
4. Set 4 containing the non-anchor point duplicates of Set 1.
5. Set 5 containing the anchor points of Set 2 assumed to have
been created by 1R/2R.
6. Set 6 containing the non-anchor points of Set 2.

Materials and methods
Duplicated genes
To identify duplicated genes, an all-against-all protein
sequence similarity search was performed using BLASTP
(with an E-value cut-off of e-10) [52]. Sequences alignable over
a length of 150 amino acids with an identity score of 30% or
more were defined as paralogs according to Li et al. [53]. To
determine the time since duplication, the fraction of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) was estimated.
These substitutions do not result in amino acid replacements
and are, in general, not under selection. Consequently, the
rate of fixation of these substitutions is expected to be relatively constant in different protein coding genes and, there-

Previously, through modeling the age distribution of duplicated genes, we estimated that genes created during the
youngest genome duplication have a KS between 0.4 and 1.0,
while genes that originated during the oldest two genome
duplications were estimated to have a KS between 1.5 and 3.7
[12]. The latter genes were grouped because it was difficult to
unambiguously attribute them to 1R or 2R [12,35]. ere, it is
assumed that anchor points dddddThe duplicated gene pairs
that arose through genome duplication events (anchor

For each of the six subsets of duplicates described above
1,279, 8,510, 550, 708, 109, and 8,389 gene pairs, respectively, remained after filtering the microarray data.

Microarray expression data

deposited research

The second dataset contains the expression data of genes in
63 plant tissues that were generated within the framework of
the AtGenExpress project (Additional data file 2) [39]. The
'mas5calls' function in Bioconductor was used to study tissuespecific gene expression [62,63]. This software evaluates the
abundance of each transcript and generates a 'detection p
value', which is used to determine the detection call, indicating whether a transcript is reliably detected (present) or not
(absent or marginal). The parameters used correspond to the
standard Affymetrix defaults in which a gene with a p value of
less than 0.04 is marked as 'present' [67,68]. We again
selected only expression data from those genes for which a
unique probe set is available on the ATH1 microarray. The
dataset contains triplicated microarrays and we assigned a
gene to be present if it was assigned with a present call in at
least one of the three samples. In all other cases an absent call
was assigned. We plotted both the absolute (or expression
breadth) and relative (or expression divergence of two duplicates) number of tissues in which the genes of a duplicated
gene pair are expressed. The latter is defined as the number of
tissues in which a gene has a present call divided by the total
number of present calls of the duplicated gene pair. Pairs of
genes without any present calls were removed from the
dataset, resulting in 6,193, 37,838, 1,387, 4,736, 269, 37,438
genes, respectively, for each of the six subsets described
above. Both of the above described datasets are available
upon request.

Correlation analysis
To measure the expression divergence of two duplicated
genes, the Spearman Rank correlation coefficient ρ was calculated. We chose to use this non-parametric statistic because
our dataset is a compilation of data from uncorrelated experiments, and might therefore contain outliers. The formula
used was:

ρ =1−

N ( N 2 − 1)

where D is the difference between the ranks of the corresponding expression values of both duplicated genes and N is
the number of samples. In evaluating and comparing the distributions of the correlation coefficients of the expression of a
set of genes, we used the Mann-Whitney U test (two sided, not
paired) that is incorporated in the statistical package R [69].

The relation between expression correlation, measured as the
Spearman correlation coefficient, and time, measured as the
number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site
KS, was studied using 'locfit', an R package to fit curves and
surfaces to data, using local regression and likelihood meth-

This study was based on gene expression data generated with
Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays (Affymetrix, San Diego, CA,
USA) [59] during various experiments, all of which are publicly available from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre
(NASC) [60,61]. Two datasets were examined that both comprise microarrays that were replicated at least once. The first
set includes 153 microarrays that were generated under a
broad range of experimental conditions, including, for example, diverse knockout mutants and chemical and biological
perturbations (Additional data file 1). Raw data were subjected to robust multi-array average (RMA) normalization,
which is available through Bioconductor [62,63]. The probe
set data of all arrays were simultaneously normalized using
quantile normalization, which eliminates systematic differences between different chips [64-66]. The log-transformed
values were used instead of the raw intensities because of the
variance-stabilizing effect of this transformation. Because of
the high sequence similarity of recently duplicated genes and
the risk of artificially increased correlation due to crosshybridization, we selected expression data only from those
genes for which a unique probe set is available on the ATH1
microarray (probe sets that are designated with an '_at'
extension, without suffix). Next, the genes were non-specifically filtered based on expression variability by arbitrarily
selecting the 10,000 genes with the highest interquartile
range. This was done in an attempt to filter out those genes
that show very little variability in gene expression, thereby
artificially increasing the overall expression correlation. The
mean intensity value was calculated for the replicated slides,
resulting in 66 data points for every gene. Next, for each of the
16 different experimental conditions, a treated plant and its
corresponding wild-type plant (control experiment without
treatment, knock-out or perturbation) were identified (Additional data file 1). To adjust the data for effects that arise from
variation in technology rather than from biological differences between the plants, for every gene the intensity value of
the wild type was subtracted from that of the treated plant.
The final dataset contained 49 expression measures per gene.

reviews

Duplicated genes were assigned to functional categories
according to the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. The GO
annotation for A. thaliana was downloaded from TAIR (version 24 June 2005) [57]. We studied genes belonging to the
biological process (BP) and the molecular function (MF)
classes of the GO tree. Rather than considering all categories
from different levels in the gene ontology, we used the plantspecific GO Slim process and function ontologies [58]. In
these GO Slim ontologies, categories close to the leaves of the
GO hierarchy are mapped onto the more general, parental
categories. A gene pair is included in a functional class only
when both genes of the pair have been assigned to that particular functional class. Functional classes containing fewer
than 200 pairs of duplicated genes were excluded from the
analysis.

ods [69,70]. We hereby included all duplicated genes with a
KS value smaller than or equal to 3.7 (see above). A local
regression model was fitted to the data of each of the functional classes of genes and we looked for biases in expression
divergence between the different functional classes by interchanging the fitted models. The model fitted to the data of a
particular class was fitted to the data of another class and the
quality of the fit was evaluated by assessing the relation
between the residuals and fitted values. Residuals that show
a clear trend (which is reflected in a non-random distribution
around Y = 0 with zero mean) indicate that the fitted regression model is inappropriate (that is, the model fitted to the
data of the former class is not applicable to the data of the
latter).
