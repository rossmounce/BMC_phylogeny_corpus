SO2426 is a positive regulator of siderophore
expression in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
Kristene L Henne1*, Xiu-Feng Wan2, Wei Wei1 and Dorothea K Thompson1,3*

Abstract
Background: The Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 genome encodes a predicted orphan DNA-binding response
regulator, SO2426. Previous studies with a SO2426-deficient MR-1 strain suggested a putative functional role for
SO2426 in the regulation of iron acquisition genes, in particular, the siderophore (hydroxamate) biosynthesis
operon so3030-3031-3032. To further investigate the functional role of SO2426 in iron homeostasis, we employed
computational strategies to identify putative gene targets of SO2426 regulation and biochemical approaches to
validate the participation of SO2426 in the control of siderophore biosynthesis in S. oneidensis MR-1.
Results: In silico prediction analyses revealed a single 14-bp consensus motif consisting of two tandem conserved
pentamers (5’-CAAAA-3’) in the upstream regulatory regions of 46 genes, which were shown previously to be
significantly down-regulated in a so2426 deletion mutant. These genes included so3030 and so3032, members of an
annotated siderophore biosynthetic operon in MR-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the
SO2426 protein binds to its motif in the operator region of so3030. A “short” form of SO2426, beginning with a
methionine at position 11 (M11) of the originally annotated coding sequence for SO2426, was also functional in
binding to its consensus motif, confirming previous 5’ RACE results that suggested that amino acid M11 is the
actual translation start codon for SO2426. Alignment of SO2426 orthologs from all sequenced Shewanella spp.
showed a high degree of sequence conservation beginning at M11, in addition to conservation of a putative
aspartyl phosphorylation residue and the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. Finally, the so2426 deletion
mutant was unable to synthesize siderophores at wild-type rates upon exposure to the iron chelator 2,2’-dipyridyl.
Conclusions: Collectively, these data support the functional characterization of SO2426 as a positive regulator of
siderophore-mediated iron acquisition and provide the first insight into a coordinate program of multiple
regulatory schemes controlling iron homeostasis in S. oneidensis MR-1.

Background
Bacteria sense and respond to environmental stimuli primarily through signal transduction pathways, in which
the canonical mechanism employs a sensor histidine
kinase that interacts with a DNA-binding response regulator to activate or repress specific gene transcription
[1,2]. Some cellular processes have been shown to be
controlled by orphan response regulators or one-component signalling systems, in which a cognate sensor kinase
has not been elucidated [3]. Orphan response regulators
have been shown to be involved in the regulation of
motility and chemotaxis [4], growth-phase-dependent

responses [5,6], virulence [7], iron transport [8] and oxidative stress responses [8,9]. For instance, one well-characterized regulon that appears to be controlled by an
orphan response regulator in S. oneidensis MR-1 is the
ArcA regulon, which regulates the cellular response to
aerobic and anaerobic respiratory conditions [10]. The
distinguishing feature of ArcA in comparison to the analogous system in Escherichia coli is that there does not
seem to be a cognate sensor kinase, ArcB, in S. oneidensis
[10], suggesting that S. oneidensis ArcA may be an
orphan response regulator.
Our previous work suggested that a putative orphan
response regulator, SO2426, in S. oneidensis MR-1 may
be an integral member of a metal-responsive regulon
governing the up-regulation of genes involved in iron
uptake and homeostasis in response to metal stress. The

ferric iron uptake regulator (Fur) is the predominant
mechanism by which bacteria regulate iron homeostasis
[11]. Evidence suggests an additional iron responsive
network regulated by SO2426 in S. oneidensis MR-1. Upregulation of SO2426 at both the protein and transcript
levels in response to iron and acid stress has been
observed in a Δfur mutant strain of MR-1 [12-14]. Our
previous studies investigating the transcriptomic and
proteomic response of S. oneidensis to chromate challenge further revealed enhanced expression of so2426
under chromate stress [15,16]. In a so2426 deletion
mutant, genes involved in iron acquisition and homeostasis such as the so3030-3031-3032 operon, which encodes
siderophore biosynthesis genes, were consistently downregulated at high levels in the deletion mutant. Iron
acquisition and storage systems are commonly up-regulated when bacteria are subjected to conditions of metal
stress (e.g., chromate), and a link between iron transport
and heavy metal sensitivity has been suggested [15,17]. It
is possible that sequestration of iron prevents redox
cycling between ferrous iron and chromate, which can
lead to reactive intermediates and oxidative stress
[18,19]. A consequence of this may be deficient intracellular iron concentrations that could inhibit growth. A
cyclical response would ensue, resulting in up-regulation
of iron uptake genes such as those involved in siderophore biosynthesis, which is similar to what has been
demonstrated for S. oneidensis in response to chromate
stress [15,16,20].
The aim of the present study was to examine the
function of the uncharacterized SO2426 response regulator within the context of siderophore biosynthesis. We
used a bioinformatics approach to map putative
SO2426-binding domains and biochemical assays to
demonstrate the binding of SO2426 to predicted recognition sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed
that a recombinant SO2426 protein binds to a putative
SO2426 motif that exists within the operator region of
the so3030-3031-3032 operon. Siderophore detection
assays further showed a diminished capacity of the
Δso2426 mutant strain to produce siderophores, particularly in the presence of the iron chelator 2,2’-dipyridyl.
Based on the identification of a Fur-binding motif
upstream of the predicted SO2426-binding site within
the operator region of the so3030-3031-3032 operon, we
postulate that there are likely multiple levels of regulation operating in S. oneidensis MR-1 to precisely adjust
intracellular iron levels in response to cellular needs.
These intricate control mechanisms appear to involve
Fur-mediated repression and derepression as well as
SO2426-mediated activation of siderophore biosynthesis
genes.

Results and Discussion
Conservation of SO2426 amino acid sequence among
Shewanellae

Previously, we reported that the so2426 gene of S. oneidensis MR-1 shares 27 to 36% sequence identity at the
amino acid level to CpxR and OmpR orthologs from
Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli [21]. Orthologs of
SO2426 were also identified in a number of Shewanella
species. Multiple sequence alignment of all available
Shewanella SO2426 orthologs revealed a high degree of
conservation at key residues (Figure 1). The predicted
phosphorylation residues (D18, D19, D62, and K109)
associated with the N-terminal CheY-like response regulator domain of SO2426 [21] are highly conserved
among Shewanella orthologs. Another striking feature is
the high degree of sequence conservation among the Cterminal or output domains of the SO2426 orthologs.
This region contains several features of OmpR wingedhelix transcriptional regulators such as the output
domain, encompassed by residues T225, G230, and
Y231 [22]. Residues 204-215 (LDMHISNTRRKL) resemble the predicted a3-helical region of E. coli CpxR,
which comprises the crucial recognition sequence of
OmpR-like response regulators [22]. Moreover, it is
noteworthy that the annotated 5’ terminus of the majority of sequenced Shewanella SO2426 orthologs occurs at
M11 relative to the MR-1 sequence (Figure 1). Previous
5’ RACE analysis of the transcription start site of MR-1
SO2426 demonstrated that M16 (or M11 relative to the
MR-1 sequence) is likely the correct start residue [21].
A phylogenetic tree constructed from the multiple
sequence alignment in Figure 1 shows that SO2426 clusters tightly with sequences from Shewanella spp. MR-4,
MR-7, and ANA-3 (Figure 2). In a system-wide comparison of Shewanella species, it was recently shown that
MR-1, MR-4, MR-7, and ANA-3 tend to be more closely related to each other than to other Shewanellae
when comparing genomes, proteomes, gene content,
and 16S rRNA sequences [23]. These four species exhibit physiological characteristics consistent with their
ability to adapt to harsh environments, which is a hallmark characteristic of Shewanella [24]. Strain ANA-3 is
most recognized for its ability to respire arsenate [25]
but has also been shown to harbor a chromate efflux
operon [26], and like MR-1, MR-4 is a known chromate
reducer [27]. Synteny of other gene clusters among
strains MR-1, MR-4, MR-7, and ANA-3 has been noted
for other metabolic processes [28] and cytochrome
operons associated with metal reduction [29]. Given the
shared genetic and proteomic arrangements among
these strains, it is likely that sequence-level relatedness
will translate to shared phenotypic traits.

Figure 1 Sequence alignment of SO2426 orthologs from sequenced Shewanella species. ClustalW was used to perform a multiple
sequence alignment of Shewanella SO2426 orthologs. The region underlined with “=” is the aligned regulator receiver domain with predicted
domain (SO2426: positions 13-124), and the region denoted with “~” is the aligned C-terminal domain containing the wHTH DNA-binding motif
(SO2426: positions 158-235). Boldface letters highlighted in grey indicate conserved signature residues of receiver domains. Residue D62 is
predicted as 4-aspartylphosphate, the putative phosphorylation site (highlighted in yellow). The star, colon, and dot notations rank the sequence
conservation from high to low, respectively. The GenBank accession numbers and associated Shewanella species are provided in the Methods.

Figure 2 Phylogenetic tree of SO2426 orthologs in Shewanella spp. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on protein sequences
using the maximum parsimony method implemented in PAUP* version 4.0 Beta [54]. Bootstrap values were generated using maximum
parsimony. The bar scale indicates a branch length corresponding to 10 character-state changes. The GenBank accession numbers are provided
in the Methods.

In silico prediction of the SO2426 recognition site

Three complementary computer-based motif search
tools–MEME [30], MotifSampler [31], and Gibbs Recursive Sampler [32]–were applied to microarray data generated for a Δso2426 MR-1 mutant strain [21] in order
to predict a consensus recognition site potentially
bound by the SO2426 response regulator (see Methods
for details). The computational analyses identified a single 14-bp consensus motif in the input dataset (Figure
3). This recognition weight matrix consisted of two conserved pentamers (5’-CAAAA-3’) in tandem (with the
first one being much less conserved), separated by the

4-bp linker sequence 5’-NCAG-3’. The linker sequence
composition is not random in that positions 7 and 8 in
the motif contain a well-conserved C and A residue,
respectively (Figure 3). Other two-component response
regulators that also recognize a tandem repeat sequence
include phosphorylated CpxR (CpxR-P) and OmpR-P.
The closest known homolog of S. oneidensis SO2426 is
CpxR [21]. Intriguingly, the predicted SO2426 recognition sequence resembles the proposed CpxR binding
box [5’-GTAAA-(N) 5 -GTAAA-3’] [33,34]. The MR-1
cpxR gene was down-regulated three-fold in Δso2426
mutant cells challenged with chromate [21] compared

Figure 3 Identification of a predicted consensus SO2426-binding motif in S. oneidensis MR-1 using computational methods. A

to a three-fold induction that was observed for wild-type
MR-1 cells under similar conditions [15]. The CpxAR
two-component system functions in responding to cell
envelope stress and external environmental stimuli, leading to the activation of genes involved in repairing misfolded proteins [1,35,36]. The Cpx system has been
implicated in a number of cellular responses including
the activation of outer membrane porins [37], stationary
phase-induced survival mechanisms [38], and pH stress
[39]. Given the activation of CpxR orthologs such as
SO2426 during periods of chromate stress in S. oneidensis MR-1 [15,21] and copper stress in E. coli [40], it is
suspected that Cpx and analogous systems operate to
overcome oxidative membrane and protein damage
induced by exposure to toxic metal ions.
For the present study, we used an input dataset for
SO2426 recognition site prediction consisting of 46 genes
showing similar down-regulated temporal expression patterns in the Δso2426 mutant [21]. As computational analysis showed, a number of these co-regulated genes were
preceded by a conserved tandem repeat (5’-CAAAANCAGCAAAA-3’) and included genes so2280 (a putative
bcr), so1188, so1190, so3025, so3062, ftn, so1580, so 2045,
so3030, so3032, viuA, and so4743 (see Table 1). The
majority of these putative SO2426-binding sites were
located in upstream regulatory regions, while one site was
identified in the so1190 coding region near the annotated
5’ terminus at position +12, suggesting that expression of
the so1188-1189-1190 operon might be controlled by
internal secondary cis-regulatory elements. In addition,
two tandem 5’-CAAAA-3’ motifs were identified upstream
of the so2426 locus at position -88 relative to the annotated translation start codon (Table 1), pointing to the
possible involvement of an autoregulatory mechanism.

Interestingly, a subset of the genes repressed in the
Δso2426 mutant, namely genes with functions in iron
acquisition and storage, also possessed a predicted ferric
uptake regulator (Fur) box in their upstream regulatory
regions. A potential Fur recognition motif, 5’-AAATGAtATTGATTcTCgTTT-3’, was identified in the upstream
region flanking so2426 and overlapped the transcriptional
start sites for this gene [21].
Several lines of evidence further support the role of
so2426 in the regulation of iron acquisition in S. oneidensis
MR-1. A recent study applying gene network reconstruction to MR-1 indicated that SO2426 clusters with iron
acquisition genes in a distinct iron-responsive network
system [14]. Within this iron acquisition gene network
were a number of members of the SO2426 regulon proposed here, namely, so1188, so1190, so3025, so3030-30313032, so3063, and so4743 [14]. All of these genes, including so2426, were up-regulated under iron-depleted growth
conditions compared to iron-replete conditions. Additionally, so3030 was up-regulated almost 14-fold in a fur
mutant, while genes so3031-so3033 were up-regulated 4 to
11-fold [13]. A separate transcriptomic study with a fur
deletion mutant revealed that the gene with the greatest
expression change in the fur mutant compared to the MR1 wild-type strain was so2426, which showed a 30- and 26fold increase in expression at the transcript level under
aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions, respectively [12].
In addition to the enhanced expression of so2426 in a fur
mutant, this gene has been shown to be up-regulated
under chromate [15,41] and strontium [42] stress.
The presence of a putative Fur-binding sequence in
the promoter region of so2426 suggests that expression
of this response regulator may be subject to multiple
levels of regulatory control. Identification of a Fur box

immediately downstream of the -10 promoter element
and up-regulation of so2426 expression in a fur deletion
mutant are both consistent with repression of this gene
by Fur under iron-sufficient conditions. Similarly, of
those genes encoding transport and binding proteins,
ftn, so1580, the so3030-3031-3032 operon, so4516, and
so4743 are probable members of the Fur regulon based
on their derepressed expression patterns in a S. oneidensis Δfur mutant and the presence of a putative Fur box
in their respective upstream regions [12]. Collectively,
these observations suggest cross-regulation of ironresponsive and other metal-responsive gene networks in
S. oneidensis MR-1.
SO2426 binds in region of predicted recognition site
upstream of alcA

Given the potential overlap in the response of S. oneidensis
to iron and other metals, we chose to focus on the

S. oneidensis siderophore biosynthesis operon in testing
the interaction of two recombinant versions of the
SO2426 protein with its predicted binding motif. The
direct involvement of so3030-3031-3032 in the production
of hydroxamate-type siderophores was recently demonstrated with deletion mutants within this gene cluster [43].
Induction of the so3030-3031-3032 operon in MR-1 cells
under chromate challenge compared to unperturbed cells
has been demonstrated using both transcriptomic and
proteomic approaches [15,16]. In further studies with a
so2426 deletion mutant under chromate challenge, the
so3030-3031-3032 operon was significantly down-regulated [21,41]. These data, together with the predicted
SO2426-binding motif upstream of so3030, suggest that
SO2426 directly regulates siderophore production in strain
MR-1 under conditions of chromate stress. We employed
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to determine
if the SO2426 protein was able to interact with the

Henne et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:125
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/125

predicted binding sequence upstream of the so3030-30313032 operon.
Our previous 5’ RACE studies demonstrated that the
likely 5’ terminus of SO2426 occurs at a methionine
located at position 11 downstream from the originally
annotated translation start [21]. Comparative sequence
analysis of SO2426 with the CpxR and OmpR amino acid
sequences from V. cholerae and E. coli showed that
sequence homology between conserved receiver domains
for these other well-characterized response regulators
and SO2426 begins 13 amino acids downstream of the
annotated start site for SO2426 [21]. This conservation is
further observed for the Shewanella SO2426 orthologs
(Figure 1). In order to test the functionality of the shorter
version of SO2426, both the full-length annotated form
(designated SO2426) and the “short” form beginning
with M11 (designated SO2426sh), were expressed using
the pTrcHis expression vector system, which incorporates an N-terminal six-histidine tag for affinity purification. The His-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli
and partially purified from crude cell extracts by Ni-affinity column purification (see Methods for details).
Expression of the recombinant SO2426 protein was
determined by SDS-PAGE (Figure 4A) and Western blotting (Figure 4B), which confirmed the presence of this
protein within the expected size range of 26-27.4 kDa.
Similar SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting results were
obtained for the verification of recombinant SO2426sh
expression (data not shown).

amplification and used as the DNA probe in measuring the
DNA-binding activity of the partially purified recombinant
SO2426 and SO2426sh proteins. Figure 6A shows that the
DNA probe shifted upward in the presence of recombinant
SO2426, with the shift becoming incrementally more
enhanced as the protein concentration in the EMSA reaction mixture was increased. No shift was observed with
protein extracts prepared from pTrcHis vector-only E. coli
control strains, ruling out the possibility that the probe
shift was due to non-specific binding of contaminating proteins. A comparable shift was observed for recombinant
SO2426sh (Figure 6B), thus supporting our proposition
that the actual 5’ terminus of the SO2425 occurs at residue
M11. Gel shift assays performed with additional DNA
probes upstream of the so3030-3031-3032 operon as well
as so3036, which also contains a putative SO2426 recognition sequence, showed a band-shift in the presence of
recombinant SO2426 (data not shown). Although the primary focus in this study is the functional role of SO2426 in
siderophore production, future studies will be necessary to
analyze the interaction of SO2426 with additional recognition sites to further define its regulon.
Siderophore production is deficient in a Δso2426 mutant
strain

Earlier physiological evidence for the role of SO2426 in
siderophore production was obtained using liquid CAS
assays in which relative siderophore production levels
for the Δso2426 mutant were compared to those for the
wild-type MR-1 strain [21]. These studies demonstrated
that the deletion mutant was markedly deficient in siderophore synthesis compared to the wild-type strain in
LB medium supplemented with chromate [21]. LB

medium constitutes a sufficient source of iron (~17 μM)
[13]. Additionally, under iron-replete conditions, in
which 50 μm FeCl 3 was added to the medium, there
was no change in siderophore levels in the Δso2426
mutant. Conversely, siderophore production in the wildtype MR-1 strain returned to background levels in the
presence of added iron [21].
We expanded upon our previous physiological work by
examining siderophore production under artificially
imposed conditions of iron depletion. To achieve this,
wild-type MR-1 and Δso2426 mutant strains were allowed
to grow in LB medium supplemented with 80 μM of the
Fe chelator 2,2’-dipyridyl to simulate iron-limiting

conditions. Other studies demonstrated that a 2,2’-dipyridyl concentration of ≤ 100 μM had a negligible effect, if
any, on the growth rate of S. oneidensis MR-1 and certain
mutant strains under aerobic conditions [14,43]. Similarly,
we observed that MR-1 and the Δso2426 mutant could
grow aerobically at relatively normal rates in LB supplemented with 80 μM of 2,2’-dipyridyl (Figure 7A), indicating
that environmental Fe was not scavenged below a critical
Fe threshold necessary for growth. As shown in Figure 7B,
the Δso2426 mutant was unable to produce CAS-reactive
siderophores at wild-type rates under aerobic growth conditions in the absence of 2,2’-dipyridyl. This deficiency was
enhanced in the presence of iron chelator (Figure 7B).

detection assay. The relative siderophore production was calculated by subtracting the supernatant A630 (absorbance at 630 nm) for the wild
type or mutant from the control (uninoculated LB medium) and then determining the ratio of corrected supernatant A630 to control A630. Error

Relative siderophore production by wild-type MR-1
increased sharply, attaining a maximum level at the 6-h
time point following exposure to 2,2’-dipyridyl (Figure 7C).
At this time interval, we detected an 11-fold increase in the
synthesis of CAS-reactive siderophores for MR-1 under
iron depletion compared to MR-1 under iron-sufficient
conditions (LB only). In the same 6-h time period, there
was only a marginal elevation in siderophore production
by the Δso2426 mutant, which exhibited substantially
reduced levels of siderophore production compared to
MR-1 under iron depletion conditions (Figure 7C).
The impaired ability of the Δso2426 mutant to produce
siderophores during aerobic growth suggests that
so2426 is a positive regulator of siderophore production
in S. oneidensis MR-1. As noted earlier, several of the
genes predicted to belong to the so2426 regulon also have
Fur-binding motifs in their upstream regions. The likely
molecular mechanism controlling iron homeostasis in S.
oneidensis MR-1 involves Fur-mediated transcriptional
repression, which includes down-regulation of so2426
expression under iron-replete conditions and derepression followed by SO2426-mediated transcriptional activation under iron-limited conditions. This may explain the
residual siderophore production in the Δso2426 mutant.
It is also possible that an as-yet uncharacterized secondary mechanism for siderophore production exists in strain
MR-1.

Conclusions
SO2426 is annotated as a DNA-binding response regulator, but its specific function in S. oneidensis MR-1 was previously undefined. Using combined in silico motif
prediction and in vitro binding assays along with physiological characterization, this report provides an important
empirical step toward describing the SO2426 regulon. We
initially identified a putative SO2426-binding consensus
motif that consists of two conserved pentamers (5’CAAAA-3’) in tandem. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assays demonstrated that recombinant SO2426 exhibits
binding specificity with its predicted motif within the 5’
regulatory region flanking a siderophore biosynthesis
operon. A Δso2426 mutant was unable to synthesize CASreactive siderophores at wild-type rates under iron limitation. Collectively, these data support a function for
SO2426 as a positive regulator of siderophore-mediated
iron acquisition in S. oneidensis MR-1.
In addition to exhibiting iron-responsive expression, the
so2426 gene has been previously shown to be up-regulated
in response to chromate stress [15,41]. The up-regulation
of iron acquisition and iron storage systems in response to
metal stress is not unique to S. oneidensis. In Arthrobacter
sp. FB24, a number of proteins with putative functions in
iron sequestration, such as Ferritin-Dps family proteins, as
well as Reiske (2Fe-2S) domain proteins, showed increased

Page 10 of 14

abundance as a result of chromate stress [17]. Copper has
been shown to disrupt Fe-S clusters in important enzymes
in E. coli [44]. An E. coli strain defective in iron transport
was also found to be more sensitive to chromium [19].
Exposure to manganese in B. subtilis resulted in altered
intracellular iron pools with subsequent expression of Furregulated genes [45]. The reason for the up-regulation of
iron-responsive genes is unclear. It has been speculated
that metal ions such as chromate result in oxidative stress
mediated through Fenton-type reactions with ferrous iron
[18,46-48]. Up-regulation of iron storage proteins may help
alleviate metal-induced oxidative damage by binding excess
Fe and preventing its interaction with other metal ions. It
is also apparent that proteins with Fe-S prosthetic groups
as part of their active centers are primary targets of metalinduced damage. These processes undoubtedly disrupt
intracellular iron homeostasis, leading to the up-regulation
of iron acquisition and sequestration systems. The evidence
provided here and in our previous work strongly points to
an integral role of SO2426 in such iron control systems.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions

All strains and plasmids used in this study are described in
Table 2. E. coli strains were cultured aerobically in LuriaBertani (LB) [Difco, Detroit, MI] medium at 37°C with
shaking. For recombinant E. coli strains, ampicillin was
added to LB at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. S. oneidensis
strains were grown aerobically in LB medium at 30°C with
shaking at 200 RPM.
SO2426 weight matrix development and identification of
a putative SO2426 recognition site

MEME [30], MotifSampler [31], and Gibbs Recursive Sampler [32] were used to predict promoter recognition
sequences potentially bound by SO2426. To facilitate motif
searching, the time-series microarray expression profiles of
the Δso2426 relative to the parental strain were clustered
using Hierarchical Clustering Explorer (HCE) [49]. During
the clustering process, only genes with an expression value
of at least ≥ 2-fold or ≤ 0.5-fold in one or more of 6 expression profiling time points were included in the analyses. As
a result, a dataset of 841 genes was clustered based on the
average linkage using Euclidean distance [21]. We
extracted a sub-cluster comprising 46 similarly down-regulated genes throughout the 6 time points, and this dataset
was used as the input data for putative SO2426 bindingsite prediction. The consensus SO2426-binding sequence
was predicted with MEME using the following parameters:
(i) the motif width ranged from 6 to 50; (ii) the total number of sites in the training set where a single motif occurred
was 3; and (iii) the sequence had 0 or 1 binding site. MAST
[50] was used to scan the sequence database with the predicted MEME-derived motif. The Gibbs Recursive Sampler

Siderophore detection

The chrome azurol-S (CAS)-based assay for detection of
siderophore production during cellular growth in liquid
was performed as described elsewhere [21,55] with slight

modifications in culture conditions. Overnight LB cultures of the Δso2426 strain and the wild-type MR-1 strain
were used to inoculate fresh LB broth and allowed to
grow to mid-logarithmic phase (OD600 ~ 0.6). The midlog-phase cultures were amended with 50 μM FeCl3, 80
μM 2,2’-dipyridyl, or 0.3 mM K2CrO4. A control consisting of LB without amendment was prepared for each
strain. The cultures were allowed to incubate for 24 h at
30°C with shaking. Aliquots were taken for CAS assay
analysis at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h post amendment. Cellfree supernatants were mixed 1:1 with the CAS assay
solution and equilibrated at room temperature for 2 h
prior to reading the absorbance at 630 nm. The relative
production of CAS-reactive siderophores was calculated
as described [21] and reported as the average of three
independent experiments.
Expression and partial purification of recombinant
SO2426 protein

Bacterial expression vectors were constructed by cloning
the full-length SO2426 gene and a shortened form
(SO2426sh) in frame with the N-terminal His-tag of
pTrcHis (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmids were
transformed into E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) or E. coli ER2508 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA) host cells. Transformants were selected on LBampicillin agar plates. Positive clones were verified by
sequence analysis at the Purdue Genomics Core Facility.
Cells carrying the expression vectors were grown at
37°C in 100 ml of LB with 50 μg/ml ampicillin until a
cell density of ~0.6 was attained. IPTG was added to a
concentration of 1 mM, and the cultures were incubated
for an additional 3 hours to induce expression of recombinant SO2426 proteins. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 1X TBS. Cell lysates were
prepared by sonicating cell pellets in Guanidium Lysis
Buffer, pH 7.8 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 1X
Complete-Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The lysates were centrifuged at 6,000 RPM for 10 min to remove cell debris.

His-tagged proteins were recovered from cell lysates
using the ProBond Purification System (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) under hybrid conditions as specified by
the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of eight 1 to 2-ml
elution fractions were collected for each protein extract.
Verification of SO2426 recombinant protein

Expression of His-tagged SO2426 and SO2426sh proteins
in the elution fractions was verified by Western blot analysis using the Western Breeze Chromogenic Western Blot
Immunodetection Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Histagged proteins were probed with an anti-HisG antibody
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with secondary detection using
anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase antibody provided in
the Western Breeze kit. Positive elution fractions were
pooled and concentrated with YM-3 Centricon Centrifugal
Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Concentrated
fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4°C against TED buffer [20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
EDTA, and 0.1 mM DTT] using mini dialysis tubes with a
molecular weight cutoff of 8 kDa. Protein concentration
was determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Rockland, DE).
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)

A non-labeled DNA probe was first generated by PCR
amplification of an 83-bp region upstream of so3030 using
primers klh001 and klh004 (Table 3) and S. oneidensis
MR-1 genomic DNA as a template. The probe sequence
was verified by sequence analysis at the Purdue Genomics
Core Facility. This PCR product was then used as the template in a PCR amplification reaction to generate a Digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe for use in EMSA. The reaction
mixture consisted of 25 mM MgCl2, 1X Promega Go-Flexi
Taq Polymerase buffer, a 1:6 ratio of dTTP:DIG-11-dUTP
dNTP mix, 0.2 mM each of primers klh001 and klh004,
5.5 ng of the unlabeled PCR product as a template, and
10 U of Taq to 1 U Pfu cocktail in a final reaction volume
of 50 μl. The PCR amplification cycle consisted of 95°C
for 4 min and 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 30 sec,
72°C for 1 min, with a final extension step at 72°C for
5 min. Labelling efficiency was verified by Southern blot
analysis using the DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the
Table 3 Oligonucleotide primers used in this study

manufacturer’s protocol for colorimetric detection. The
DIG-labeled DNA probe was quantified using a Nanodrop
ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.
EMSA was performed in 20-μl reaction volumes containing 0.5X EMSA buffer [5 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0),
75 mM KCl, 0.05 mM DTT, 0.05 mM EDTA, 6% glycerol], 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Acetyl-PO4, 0.2 μg/μl poly
(dI:dC), 0.2 μg/μl BSA, and 95 ng DIG-labeled DNA
probe. Protein was added in concentrations ranging from
0.6 to 3.0 μg in increments of 0.6 μg. Reactions were incubated at 16°C for 30 min. NP-40 was added to each reaction mixture at a concentration of 0.1% prior to separation
on a pre-run 5% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained
with SYBR green and then transferred onto Hybond N+
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Probing and
detection of DIG-labeled DNA was performed with the
DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol for colorimetric detection.
