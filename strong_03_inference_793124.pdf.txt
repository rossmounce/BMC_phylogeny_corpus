information

Although operon structure has been well studied at the biochemical level in microorganisms such as Escherichia coli,
genome-wide operon organization in pathogenic organisms,

such as M. tuberculosis, remains largely unknown. Even so,
we can exploit the conservation of certain genetic elements
present in many prokaryotic, eubacterial organisms, including M. tuberculosis, to learn about operon structure and gene
function. Among these are the -10 and -35 bp promoter elements, the ribosome binding sites (RBS), and the 5' and 3'
untranslated regions (UTR). Taking into account the orientation of genes on the chromosome, as well as the elements
described above, we can build a model, as shown in Figure 2,
which depicts the minimum requirements of adjacent genes
that are either part of a common operon (Case 4) or not part
of a common operon (Cases 1-3). In situations where there is
a change in orientation (Cases 1 and 2), the operon boundaries (defined here as the first or last gene of an operon) are
easily identifiable. It is rare for prokaryotic transcripts to
traverse the length of a gene on a noncoding strand [3,4].

interactions

One difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes
is the organization of the prokaryotic genome into multi-gene
units, known as operons [1]. In its simplest form, as shown in
Figure 1a, operon organization in prokaryotes results in a
series of adjacent genes being transcribed onto a single polycistronic mRNA, containing the coding regions for the synthesis of multiple proteins. As opposed to eukaryotes, where
the dominant transcription form is monogenic, prokaryotic
operon organization enables the highly controlled co-expression of multiple genes, by transcribing them together onto a
single transcript. More importantly, the encoded proteins of
common operons often have related functions, form common
complexes, or participate in shared biochemical pathways
[2].

refereed research

The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was analyzed using recently developed computational
approaches to infer protein function and protein linkages. We evaluated and employed a method
to infer genes likely to belong to the same operon, as judged by the nucleotide distance between
genes in the same genomic orientation, and combined this method with those of the Rosetta Stone,
Phylogenetic Profile and conserved Gene Neighbor computational methods for the inference of
protein function.

A simplified version ofOperon method
A simplified version of prokaryotic operon organization and functional
linkages based on the Operon method. (a) Prokaryotic operon
organization. Genes A, B, and C are transcribed together onto a single
polycistronic transcript, which is then translated to produce three
separate proteins. Proteins originating from genes of a common operon
often have similar functions, interact physically through protein-protein
interactions, or participate in shared biochemical pathways. (b) Functional
Linkages based on the Operon method. Genes A, B and C are 'linked' if
the intergenic nucleotide distance between pairs of adjacent genes is less
than or equal to the specified threshold. In this case the distance between
gene A and B, and the distance between gene B and C is less than the
hypothetical distance threshold, thereby allowing links between all possible
sets of genes.

orientation [3,4]. If two genes, A and B, are transcribed separately, as seen in Case 3, the minimum genetic elements
required upstream from the start codon of gene B would be its
corresponding -10 and -35 bp elements, transcription start
site, 5' UTR, and any additional gene-specific promoter elements. As for the downstream elements of gene A, we would
expect a 3' UTR and a transcription termination site.
Although these genetic elements may overlap with both coding and non-coding elements of adjacent genes, the unique
nucleic acid sequence requirements of each of these elements
make substantial element overlap less likely if the genes are
transcribed independently. If instead both genes are part of a
multigene operon, the only upstream requirement of gene B
is a single ribosome binding site (RBS) which may be in the
intergenic region, or may overlap the coding region of gene A.
Intuition suggests, as shown in Figure 2 Case 4, the intergenic
spacing between genes in a common operon is shorter than
the intergenic spacing of genes encoded by separate transcription units.
Previous studies have examined the nucleotide length distribution of the 5' UTRs, 3' UTRs, intergenic regions and space

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/9/R59

between RBSs and start sites of transcription in the genome
of E. coli [5]. Salgado et al. utilized a set of experimentally
determined E. coli operons to examine the distance distributions of intergenic regions between genes within operons and
those found experimentally to be at transcription boundaries,
and used these values to compute a log-likelihood score for
predicting transcription units in E. coli [4]. Salgado et al. also
demonstrated that short intergenic distances are common
between adjacent genes of documented operons in E. coli [4],
and subsequent analyses by Moreno-Hagelsieb et al. have
suggested that short intergenic distances may be the case for
operon members in most other prokaryotic genomes [3]. We
have employed a similar dataset as Salgado et al. [4], obtained
from RegulonDB [6], to evaluate the accuracy of operon inferences using various distance thresholds in E. coli, as well as to
calculate a posterior probability of identifying E. coli genes of
a common operon, given the intergenic distance separating
two adjacent genes in the same orientation.
Intergenic distance thresholds have also been used both as
single distance cutoffs [7,8] and for the construction of probabilistic models [9], to infer gene function based on predicted
operon structure. Building on these studies, we evaluate a
prokaryotic genome with minimal experimental evidence
regarding operon organization. We provide a method for
evaluating operon predictions, based on distance and orientation constraints, as well as a combined computational
approach to infer protein function and protein linkages,
based on the organization of the prokaryotic genome.
In addition to exploiting operon organization, we have also
combined the Operon method (OP) with that of the Rosetta
Stone (RS) [10], Phylogenetic Profile (PP) [11], and conserved
Gene Neighbor (GN) [7,12] method. While the Operon
method focuses on the analysis of a single genome, in this
case M. tuberculosis, the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic Profiles, and conserved Gene Neighbor methods focus on the
analysis of multiple genomes. Individual proteins that are
functionally linked by the Rosetta Stone method occur as a
single 'fusion' protein in another organism. The Phylogenetic
Profile method functionally links proteins that occur in a correlated manner, for example: a group of genes which may
have a shared pattern of presence or absence throughout various genomes. And finally, the conserved Gene Neighbor
method links genes that occur as chromosomal neighbors in
multiple genomes, often a characteristic of bacterial operons
as well as clustered genes of related function.
Although the conserved Gene Neighbor method has been
used previously to identify potential operon members [8], the
method is distinct from that of the Operon method. Functional linkages established by the Operon method rely only on
a single genome, where genes are functionally linked based on
a specified intergenic distance threshold. The conserved Gene
Neighbor method, in contrast, compares all available
sequenced genomes in order to identify genes that are located

information

Table 1 summarizes the number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genes with links that we established by the Operon
method at various distance thresholds. A pair of genes are
considered functionally linked by this method if the intergenic nucleotide distance between adjacent genes in the same
orientation is less than or equal to a specified distance threshold. Multiple genes are linked if a series of genes in the same

orientation all have intergenic distances less than or equal to
the defined distance threshold, as shown in Figure 1b. At a
distance threshold of 0 bp we see that 1,279 genes are functionally linked by 2,034 functional linkages. We would expect
a substantial percentage of these linkages to represent true
operon linkages due to the minimal intergenic spacing and
often overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). In E. coli, for
example, we find that of the 654 links that overlap with experimentally documented E. coli transcription units at the 0 bp
threshold, 89% correspond to true operon links, while only
11% link genes previously identified as independent transcription units.

Column 1 (distance threshold) indicates the intergenic distance, in base
pairs, of less than or equal to the indicated value. Notice that at the 0
bp threshold we have links connecting over 25% of the M. tuberculosis
genes. As we increase the distance threshold from 0 bp to 100 bp we
approach almost 75% of the genes having one or more links to other
M. tuberculosis genes.

In M. tuberculosis, we find that six of the eight genes of the
documented mammalian cell entry (mce1) operon are linked
with a distance threshold of 0 bp, while the other two genes
are included by slightly increasing this threshold to 5 bp. Also,
we observe that all four members of the documented oligopeptide permease operon (oppA-D) are linked with a 0 bp
distance threshold, and are flanked by genes in opposite orientations. As we increase the distance threshold from 0 bp to
100 bp we see the inclusion of genes accounting for a substantial percentage of the tuberculosis genome into putative operons. The expanded coverage enables inclusion of operon
members such as the groEL1 groES operon pair, which is separated by 95 bp, and enables linkage of the eight members of
the likely arginine biosynthesis operon (Rv1652-Rv1659),
which includes intergenic separations ranging from -3 to 80
bp.

Evaluation of functional linkages (Operon method)
To evaluate the accuracy and coverage of functional linkages
established at the various distance thresholds, we employed a
keyword recovery scheme [13] to compare links between
SWISS-PROT annotated proteins. Keyword recovery means
that identical keywords are found in the annotations for both
proteins connected by the link; the results are shown in Table
2. At a distance threshold of 0 bp, we see a 50% keyword
recovery, indicating that half of the total keywords were
shared between the linked pairs of genes. As the distance
threshold increases from 0 to 100 bp we see the keyword
recovery drop from 51% to 45%, and the maximum false positive fraction increase from 0.25 to 0.35 - both indicators of
inclusion of links between genes that may not be true operon
links. The maximum false positive fraction is calculated by
dividing the number of pairwise linkages that do not have any
SWISS-PROT keywords in common by the total number of
pairwise linkages.

Next we evaluated the keyword recovery at specified distance
intervals using the combined intergenic distances between
genes of a common run (defined as a series of adjacent genes
in the same direction, bordered by genes in opposite orientations). Here we linked all gene pairs in the same run, and gave
each linked pair a numerical value equal to the sum of the
total intergenic distances between the two genes. The statistics for evaluated intervals are shown in Figure 3. While genes
separated by combined intergenic distances of 150 bp or less

The method of keyword recovery allows us to evaluate a set of
linkages based on known functional annotations. By comparing the SWISS-PROT keywords we can quantitatively evaluate different thresholds or different methods for inferring
protein function. The maximum false positive fraction is the
fraction of functionally-linked proteins that, based on their
current annotation, do not share any function in common. We
use the term 'maximum' because there are many reasons why
two genes may not have any keywords in common, ranging
from incomplete biochemical or genetic characterization to
the use of different vocabularies to describe similar functions.
The quantity 1-maximum false positive fraction indicates the
fraction of pairwise links that have one or more keywords in
common, and therefore some function in common.

equal to the combined intergenic distances between them. While the
keyword recovery of genes linked by a combined intergenic distance less
than 150 bp is fairly high (34-52%), it is apparent that as the total intergenic
distance increases above 150 bp, there is a decrease in keyword recovery.
At combined intergenic distances above 250 bp the keyword recovery is
comparable to that of randomly linked genes.

*The maximum false positive fractions were calculated as the fraction of pairwise links that do not have any SWISS-PROT keywords in common
(ignoring the keywords 'hypothetical protein', 'three-dimensional structure', 'transmembrane' and 'complete proteome'). †Keyword recovery was
calculated by comparing the SWISS-PROT keyword annotation between each pair of linked M. tuberculosis genes. The keyword recovery of all
linkages was calculated as:

1
X

y

x

∑∑nj
i =1 j =1

where X is the total number of query protein keywords, Y is the total number of linked gene pairs, x is the number of query protein SWISS-PROT
keywords, and nj is the number of times the query protein keyword j occurs in the linked protein. Notice that at 0 bp the keyword recovery is quite
high, about 50%, while the maximum false positive rate is about 25%. As the distance threshold increases from 0 bp to 100 bp the keyword recovery
decreases, while the maximum false positive fraction increases.

In order to further refine our functional inferences, we set out
to evaluate the Operon method in combination with the
Rosetta Stone [10], Phylogenetic Profile [11] and conserved
Gene Neighbor [7,12] computational methods. The total
number of functional linkages established by each of the
methods alone, as well as in combination, are listed in Table
4. We see that there is substantial overlap among the four
methods, and many gene pairs are linked by more than one
method. For example, there are 414 links inferred by both the
Operon and Rosetta Stone methods, 632 links inferred by
both the Operon and Phylogenetic Profile methods, and 1,516
links inferred by both the Operon and conserved Gene Neighbor methods.

interactions

The most substantial overlap results from that of the Operon
method and the conserved Gene Neighbor method. We see
that 18% of the links identified by the Operon method at the
100 bp threshold are also identified by the conserved Gene
Neighbor method. Both of these methods are used to identify
potential operons in microbial genomes, but the conserved
Gene Neighbor method only identifies operons that are conserved in multiple genomes. The Operon method, in contrast,
is based solely on the intergenic distance between genes in the
same orientation so it is able to identify potential operons
even in the absence of homologous genes in other organisms.
Ermolaeva et al. noted that many bacterial operons are
organized in a similar manner in diverse genomes [8], and

refereed research

Of particular interest are functional links that connect nonannotated proteins to annotated proteins. These links may
represent likely operon pairs, and thus may be used to infer
possible function for previously uncharacterized proteins.
For this evaluation, our original database was expanded to
include M. tuberculosis gene annotations obtained from the
Sanger Institute web server. Of the 1,548 non-annotated
genes, a substantial percentage (between 14% and 46%) can
be linked to one or more of the 2,403 annotated genes at
distance thresholds ranging from 0 bp to 100 bp, as
summarized in Table 3. We expect that links established in
this manner may suggest possible functional roles for hundreds of previously uncharacterized proteins, and used in
combination with other techniques may aid, not only in the
inference of protein function, but also in the identification of
possible interacting partners.

have keyword recovery scores ranging from 34% to 52%, as
the distance increases past 125 bp the keyword recovery
decreases steadily until the keyword recovery is no better
than that of random links above 250 bp. This result suggests
that, as expected, genes that are separated by greater distances are less likely to belong to common operons than those
in close proximity, and are less likely to have similar
functions.

employed a combination of the conserved Gene Neighbor
method along with a distance threshold to predict operons in
microbial genomes [8].
We also see that a number of functional linkages inferred by
the Operon method overlap with linkages inferred by the Phylogenetic Profile and Rosetta Stone methods. MorenoHagelsieb et al. previously compared genes within operons to
those at transcription boundaries, and demonstrated that
genes in known operons are more likely to have similar Phylogenetic Profiles, are more likely to occur as conserved Gene
Neighbors and are more likely to occur as fusion proteins
than genes at transcription boundaries [14]. Yanai et al. also
examined fusion genes, and noted many instances where
individual components that constituted a 'fusion' gene were
found as separate genes organized into common operons [15].
Table 4 also summarizes functional linkages inferred by the
overlap of three methods and functional linkages inferred by
all four computational methods. Each of the overlapped combinations was evaluated using the keyword recovery method
described in the methods. Table 5 summarizes the keyword
recovery for each of the combinations. Used independently,
the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic Profile and conserved Gene
Neighbor methods have a signal to noise ratio of 9.5, 2.8 and
5.6, respectively. The signal to noise ratio is calculated by
dividing the keyword recovery score of functionally-linked
proteins by the keyword recovery score of randomly-paired
proteins. The combined overlap of the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic Profile and conserved Gene Neighbor linkages with
the 100 bp Operon linkages increases the 100 bp Operon signal to noise from 7.9 to between 10 and 13.
The best keyword recovery score is achieved by a combination
of the 100 bp Operon, Rosetta Stone and Phylogenetic Profile
methods (Figure 4). This combination results in a 74% keyword recovery and a 0.03 maximum false positive fraction.
The high keyword recovery and low maximum false positive

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/9/R59

fraction for the combined methods gives us additional confidence in the correctness of these functional linkages, and we
indicate these as high confidence links.

Evaluation of coverage and establishing a distance
threshold
To investigate further the coverage of the Operon method, we
compiled a list of all adjacent genes in the same orientation
that are functionally linked by either the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic Profile or conserved Gene Neighbor methods. We
may hypothesize that many of these functional links overlap
with true operon pairs, and therefore may yield a distance
profile that would be indicative of the intergenic distance profile between genes that are in a common operon. Figure 5a
summarizes the distance profiles of the intergenic distances
between the 564 functionally-linked gene pairs, and Figure 5b
indicates pairs not linked by any of the three methods. The
linked pairs represent a distinct population, verified by the
chi-square test (probability less than 0.005% that these distributions are drawn from the same population).
The linked population is more heavily weighted at the short
distances, with a mean of 27 base pairs, while those that were
not identified as linked by the three methods, have a mean of
94 base pairs. In fact, this result corresponds well with the

Although we have selected the 100 bp threshold for evaluation of the combined computational approach, a lower
threshold, such as 50 bp or 25 bp, results in a higher keyword
recovery and a lower maximum false positive fraction (Table
2). The best scores for the Operon method, as we might
expect, are achieved at a distance threshold of 0 bp. Although

Moreno-Hagelsieb et al. suggested a method for examining
all adjacent gene pairs within the same direction (WD), and
proposed a formula to calculate the fraction that exist in common operons [3]. Moreno-Hagelsieb estimated that 50% of E.
coli WD pairs may be in shared operons [3,4], and using their
formula we estimate that 57% of M. tuberculosis WD pairs are
in common operons. According to Skovgaard et al., E. coli and
M. tuberculosis appear to have a similar quality of assigned
open reading frames [17], therefore it is likely that the higher
percentage of M. tuberculosis WD pairs in operons is not a
result of over assignment of open reading frames. Since M.
tuberculosis has a higher percentage of WD pairs in operons,
a higher distance threshold may be tolerated in M. tuberculosis than the 50 bp threshold used previously in E. coli [16].

We have also computed the keyword recovery and maximum
false positive fraction for Operon distance thresholds ranging
from 0 bp to 300 bp. As shown in Figure 6, as we increase the
distance threshold from 0 bp to 300 bp, there is a steady
decrease of the keyword recovery (from 0.51 to 0.33) and a
steady increase of the maximum false positive fraction (from
0.25 to 0.50). Keyword recovery analysis allows evaluation of
each of the distance thresholds and provides a method of
evaluating operon inferences in organisms without extensive
prior experimental data on operon structure. At a distance
threshold of 0 bp we may expect approximately 75% ([1-maximum false positive] × 100%) of the linked genes to have one
or more keywords in common, and therefore some function in
common. If we increase the distance threshold to 50 bp, as
was used previously by Blattner et al. to predict operons in E.
coli [16], we may expect approximately 70% of the linked M.
tuberculosis genes to have some function in common.

A closer examination of Figure 5a and 5b reveals the similarities and differences among the two populations. The large
occurrence at 0 distance in Figure 5b shows probable linkages
that are detected by the Operon method but are undetected by
the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic Profile or conserved Gene
Neighbor methods. Furthermore, the large occurrence of
potential linkages in Figure 5b above 200 bp is excluded by
the Operon method, with a threshold of less than or equal to

improved at shorter distance thresholds, the coverage is
decreased. Combining the Operon method with those of the
Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic Profile or conserved Gene Neighbor methods yield a dramatic improvement in both the keyword recovery and the maximum false positive fraction
(Figure 4), and enables the use of a larger distance threshold,
such as 100 bp. Gene pairs that are linked by two or more
methods are very likely to share some function in common,
even with a distance threshold of 100 bp (Figure 4).
For comparison, we have also included the distance profile of
adjacent genes in experimentally documented E. coli operons
(Figure 5c, data obtained from RegulonDB [6]). The distributions of both the E. coli operon data (Figure 5c) and the M.
tuberculosis linked data (Figure 5a) tend to have shorter
intergenic distances than the set of M. tuberculosis genes that
are not functionally linked by the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic
Profile or conserved Gene Neighbor methods (Figure 5b).
Most prokaryotic organisms do not have extensive data

Figure 7 depicts two M. tuberculosis genes, leuD and leuC,
that are functionally linked by all four methods: Operon,
Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic Profiles and conserved Gene
Neighbors. These two genes, like a number of other genes
linked by all four methods, encode proteins that have a very
close physical and functional association within the cell. The
leuD and leuC genes encode individual protein subunits that
dimerize to form a functional isopropylmalate isomerase heterodimer, involved in leucine biosynthesis [18]. These two
genes have been identified as members of common operons
in numerous prokaryotic organisms [19] often with additional
members of the leucine biosynthesis pathway. This example
exemplifies the use of a combined protocol to identify not
only genes that are likely to belong to common operons, but
also genes that encode proteins that have a strong functional
link, possibly encoding proteins that may physically interact.
In addition, leuD and leuC do not share any sequence similarity, emphasizing the ability of these methods to identify functional links between non-homologous proteins. In S. pombe
the leuD and leuC genes occur as a single fusion protein, as
shown in Figure 7b.

Inference of protein function and operon organization
Next we demonstrate the use of this combined approach to
identify genes that are likely to belong to common operons, as
well as to assign possible function to genes of previously
unknown function. Figure 8a shows two genes, Rv0415 and
Rv0417(thiG), that are linked by all four methods. Rv0415 has
the Sanger annotation 'conserved hypothetical protein', while
Rv0417 is annotated as 'thiamine synthesis'. These two genes
flank and slightly overlap Rv0416, which also has the annotation 'conserved hypothetical protein'. Taken together, this
evidence suggests that all three of these genes may be members of a common operon, and therefore we may assign a
putative function to Rv0415 and Rv0416 as possibly involved
with thiamine synthesis. Since Rv0415 and Rv0417(thiG) are
linked by both the Operon method and the Rosetta Stone
method, we may speculate that these two products may be
both co-expressed as well as encode proteins that are functionally linked, either as physically interacting partners or as
participants in a common biochemical pathway. These inferences are further supported by the recent change in the Pasteur Institute annotation of Rv0415 and Rv0416 from
'conserved hypothetical proteins' to 'Possible oxidoreductase
thiO' and 'Possible Protein thiS' respectively, both believed to
be involved in thiamine biosynthesis. The recent Pasteur
Institute classification of Rv0416 is based on weak sequence
similarity to other thiS proteins.

While the functional linkages established by the Rosetta
Stone method in combination with the Operon method seem
to be useful at identifying functionally-linked partners, the
overlap between the Operon method and the conserved Gene
Neighbor methods is more prevalent. Figure 8c shows a
region with numerous functional linkages to the penicillinbinding protein, Rv2163c(pbpB). Here we see a string of four
genes, three of which have the Sanger annotation of 'hypothetical protein' or 'conserved hypothetical protein'. Based on
the functional linkages established by the Operon method,
Phylogenetic Profiles and conserved Gene Neighbors methods, we may assign a putative function to Rv2164c, Rv2165c
and Rv2166c, similar to that of the pbpB, which is involved in
cell wall biosynthesis.

Distance in base pairs between adjacent M. tuberculosis genes
in the same orientation not linked by the RS, GN or PP methods

A possible operon involved in RNA degradation may be
encoded by the three genes Rv2925c(rnc), Rv2926c and
Rv2927c, as shown in Figure 8b. Functional links between
Rv2926c and Rv2925c(rnc) were identified by the Operon,
Rosetta Stone and conserved Gene Neighbor methods, while
Rv2926c was linked to Rv2927c by the Operon and conserved
Gene Neighbor methods. Rv2926c and Rv2927c have the
Sanger annotation 'hypothetical protein' and 'conserved
hypothetical protein', respectively. Since Rv2925c(rnc) has
the annotation 'RNAse III', we may assign a putative function
to both Rv2926c and Rv2927c as possibly involved in RNA
degradation. Notice that the functional link between Rv2926c
and Rv2925c(rnc) is supported by three separate forms of
evidence (OP, RS and GN), while the only direct link between
Rv2927c and Rv2925c(rnc) is by the Operon method. Further
support for this link is established indirectly due to the two
functional links to Rv2926c.

other genes throughout the genome. In Figure 9 we see two
genes, Rv1503c and Rv1504c, linked by both the Operon and
the Rosetta Stone method. Although neither of these genes
have functions assigned to them, we may hypothesize that
they may be co-expressed as a single transcript and may function together.
In order to link Rv1503c and Rv1504c to a possible function
or pathway we can examine all of the other functional
linkages. Although both Rv1503c and Rv1504c have a number
of functional linkages, there are some common linkages
between them. Both Rv1503c and Rv1504c have functional
linkages to the genes Rv1302(rfe) and Rv3464(rmlB). Interestingly, both of these genes, rfe and rmlB, are important elements of the arabinogalactan biosynthesis pathway [20].
Arabinogalactan is an essential component of the M. tuberculosis cell wall, and the arabinogalactan biosynthetic pathway
is of major medical relevance, since two of its downstream
members, EmbA and EmbB, are primary targets of the tuberculosis drug Ethambutol. Although there have been efforts to
identify members of this pathway, only a fraction of the pathway members are known [20]. Here we propose that Rv1503c
and Rv1504c may be important members of the
arabinogalactan biosynthesis pathway, possibly organized
into a shared operon, encoding functionally-linked proteins.
Another potential drug target is turned up by our methods, as
a link to one of the M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase
homologues, as seen in Figure 10. This emerges from the
genomic region containing the genes Rv1878(glnA3) and

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/9/R59

Rv1879. Rv1878 is annotated as enocoding a 'probable
glutamine synthase' while Rv1879 is annotated 'conserved
hypothetical protein'. There are four homologous proteins in
the M. tuberculosis genome, annotated as either 'glutamine
synthase' or 'probable glutamine synthase'. Glutamine synthetase plays a vital role in the incorporation of ammonia into
biomolecules through a two-step mechanism involving glutamate, ammonia and ATP. Although it is not known why there
are four homologous glutamine synthase-like genes in M.
tuberculosis, at least one of these, glnA1, has been proposed
as a drug target in M. tuberculosis [21].
The 'probable glutamine synthase' gene Rv1878 is linked to
the 'conserved hypothetical protein' Rv1879 by both the
Operon Method and the Rosetta Stone method, possibly indicating a functional relationship between these two genes. In
Arabidopsis thaliana, both domains encoded by M. tuberculosis genes Rv1878(glnA3) and Rv1879 occur as a single fused
protein, as seen in Figure 10. A closer look at the phylogenetic
distribution of proteins homologous to Rv1879 reveals that
homologs of this protein are present in only a handful of
prokaryotic genomes, and as fusion proteins with glutamine
synthase-like domains in some fungi and plants. Glutamine
synthetase homologs, on the other hand, are found in all
living organisms. We speculate that Rv1879 may have a functional relationship to the 'probable glutamine synthase' gene
Rv1878, and may encode for a protein that links this
glutamine synthase homolog to a previously undescribed
pathway. The absence of an M. tuberculosis Rv1879 homolog
in mammals, and the possible association with a glutamine
synthetase homolog, may make this protein a promising drug
target candidate.
In this study we have focused on the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic Profiles and conserved Gene Neighbor linkages that
overlap with the Operon linkages. The Operon method links
genes to other genes at a particular genetic locus. In contrast,
the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic Profiles and conserved Gene
Neighbor methods can link genes that lie near or far along the
chromosome. Thus by combining these methods we are able
to identify functional linkages involving genes that are not
part of operons as well as genes that are.

Conclusions

The organization of the M. tuberculosis genome holds many
clues to the possible function of hundreds of previously
uncharacterized proteins. The use of the Operon method,
based on distance between genes in the same orientation,
appears to provide a useful tool for the prediction of protein
function as well as the identification of possible operon
members. The coverage of linkages at various distances may
be inferred by the distance profile of genes known to be functionally linked (Figure 5a), and the accuracy of these functional links may be represented by the maximum false
positive rate (Table 2).

From our examination of experimentally documented operons in E. coli we expect that the Operon method would be able
to identify functional relationships among proteins involved
in a wide variety of functional categories. For example, in E.
coli we observe operons containing genes involved in common metabolic pathways, multi-protein complexes, membrane-bound transport complexes, as well as genes involved
in cell structure, cell adaptation, DNA replication,
transcription, translation, regulatory functions and a number
of other cellular activities.

information

Although the coverage of the Operon method alone allows us
to identify thousands of potentially functionally-linked genes,
a combined approach with the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic
Profiles and conserved Gene Neighbor methods allows us to
establish higher confidence links, as demonstrated in Figure
4 and Table 5. The Operon method in combination with any
of the other methods results in an increase in the keyword
recovery and a decrease in the maximum false positive fractions. The combination of the 100 bp threshold Operon

interactions

In further support of the idea that the functional similarities
between genes in the same orientation is due primarily to
operon structure, is the observation that common function is
related to the distance between genes in the same orientation,
as depicted in Figure 3. Genes separated by a combined intergenic distance of more than 250 bp are no more likely to share
a common function than randomly selected pairs. In contrast
to operon prediction methods based on conserved gene
strings [8,22], methods based on intergenic distance thresholds allow identification of operon members without the

dependency on identifiable homologues in other sequenced
genomes [3,23].

refereed research

Taken together, using the Operon method alone with a
threshold distance of 100 bp, we may expect to link over 90%
of the true operon members in the M. tuberculosis genome.
The accuracy of the 8,468 functional links established at that
distance, may be inferred from the maximum false positive
fractions in Table 2, roughly 60% ([1-max. false positive fraction] × 100%) of these links may represent links between
genes that have at least some functional similarity, many
probably representing true operon members. We expect that
the maximum false positive fractions represent the upper
limit of true false positive pairwise linkages since the annotations of many genes may be incomplete.

Here we have applied a combined method to investigate the
genome of the pathogenic bacterium M. tuberculosis, and
have demonstrated functional links from a number of previously uncharacterized proteins to specific biochemical pathways. Included in these, we have identified five novel proteins
that may be functionally involved with pathways involved in
the biosynthesis of components of the mycobacterium cell
wall. By applying these methods to the entire genome of the
pathogenic M. tuberculosis, we have identified many other
novel genes that are linked to numerous biochemical pathways, some that may eventually serve as potential drug targets. Combined, these methods will also enable the genomewide analysis of other prokaryotic genomes, and will aid in
the identification of novel partners in both characterized and

interactions

Many linkages inferred by the Rosetta Stone, Phylogenetic
Profile and conserved Gene Neighbor methods overlap with
those of the Operon method. The highest overlap results from
that of the conserved Gene Neighbors method. In many cases
this would be expected since genes organized in an operon
would have a tendency to coevolve as a single unit, rather than
as separate units, therefore these genes would be observed as
'Neighbors' in multiple prokaryotic genomes. The Phylogenetic Profiles overlap would result from the observation that
operon members are often involved in shared pathways or
complexes, and therefore would be expected to evolve in a
correlated fashion. Finally, the overlap with the Rosetta Stone
links may reflect the observation that the Rosetta Stone
method, like the Operon method, often links proteins that
either physically interact or are in the same pathway. The
Phylogenetic Profile and conserved Gene Neighbor methods
have also been used previously to confirm operon predictions
based on intergenic distances [3,23].

There are a number of potential applications for this combined method, ranging from the prediction of protein function based on functional linkages to annotated proteins, to the
reconstruction of biochemical pathways. Zheng et al. have
employed a combination of gene proximity and phylogenetic
profiles to examine the co-evolution of gene clusters in E. coli
[24], while Pellegrini et al. have used similar methods to

false positive fractions for this combination may be an indication that these links represent not only genes with similar
functions that are organized into a common operon, but also
may suggest proteins that may physically interact.

Identification of two novel genes linked to the arabinogalactan biosynthesis pathway, an important target of M. tuberculosis specific drugs
Identification of two novel genes linked to the arabinogalactan biosynthesis pathway, an important target of M. tuberculosis specific drugs. Based on the
close proximity of adjacent genes (Operon method) and the functional linkage established by the Rosetta Stone method, we infer that Rv1503c and
Rv1504c may be organized into a common operon. Both genes also have functional links to the genes rfe and rmlB, important components in the
arabinogalactan biosynthesis pathway.

A unique M. tuberculosis gene linked to a glutamine synthetase paralog. Few homologs of Rv1879 exist in prokaryotes, but some plants and certain fungi
contain a fusion protein containing domains homologous to both Rv1879 and to glutamine synthetase. The Operon and Rosetta Stone linkages suggest a
possible role for Rv1879, and a possible functional association with the glnA3 gene product.

Materials and methods
M. tuberculosis gene coordinates
Gene name, length, coordinates and orientation were downloaded from the Pasteur Institute TubercuList web server
[26]. Gene coordinates were adjusted to include the stop
codon of each gene.

Sanger Institute Functional Annotations
Sanger Institute M. tuberculosis H37Rv Functional Annotations were obtained from the Sanger M. tuberculosis web
server [27].

SWISS-PROT Functional Annotations
M. tuberculosis SWISS-PROT Keywords were obtained from
the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) SWISS-PROT web server [28].

Keyword recovery
Pairwise links between functionally-linked proteins were
evaluated by a keyword recovery scheme [13] using the

SWISS-PROT annotation for each of the tuberculosis proteins. For keyword recovery scores, pairs were evaluated only
when both members of the pair had at least one SWISS-PROT
keyword. The uninformative keywords: hypothetical protein,
three-dimensional structure, transmembrane and complete
proteome were discarded. Each pair of functionally-linked
proteins received a preliminary score for the number of corresponding keywords which were shared between the two
linked proteins. For example, consider the functional link at
the 0 bp threshold between Rv0350 and Rv0351. Rv0350 has
three SWISS-PROT keywords: ATP-binding, Chaperone and
Heat shock. Rv0351 has two SWISS-PROT keywords: Chaperone and Heat shock. This link is assigned a preliminary
score of two. This process was repeated for all linked genes,
and a global measure of keyword recovery was derived by
summing the individual link keyword scores and dividing by
the total number of query keywords, as shown in Table 2.
The maximum false positive fraction was calculated by dividing the number of pairwise functional links that had no keywords in common by the total number of pairwise links. This
estimate of false positives is presumably an upper limit
because two linked genes might have related functions even
in the absence of overlapping annotated functions.

Operon method

Rosetta Stone method

We employed the equation given by Moreno-Hagelsieb et al.
[3] to estimate the fraction of M. tuberculosis WD pairs that
are in common operons. The fraction of M. tuberculosis WD
pairs with an intergenic distance between -20 bp and 30 bp
were divided by the fraction of E. coli WD pairs with an intergenic distance between -20 bp and 30 bp. This number was
then multiplied by 0.5, which was previously estimated to be
the fraction of E. coli WD pairs that are in operons [3,4].

information

Functional links were established by the conserved Gene
Neighbor method where genes appear as chromosomal
neighbors in multiple genomes, as described by Overbeek et
al. [7] and Dandekar et al. [12]. For all possible pairs of M.
tuberculosis genes, the nucleotide distance between
homologs of these genes in all available sequenced genomes
was calculated. Genes that were in close proximity in multiple
genomes were indicated as functionally linked by this
method. A probabilistic score reflects the likelihood of
observing the intergenic distance between a pair of genes
across all sequenced genomes.

refereed research

Phylogenetic profiles were used to identify proteins that
evolved in a correlated fashion, as described by Pellegrini et
al. [11]. A phylogenetic profile for each M. tuberculosis protein was created in the form of a bit vector, by searching for
the presence or absence of homologs in each of the available
fully-sequenced genomes. The presence of an identifiable
homolog in a particular genome was indicated by the integer
1 in the bit vector at the position corresponding to that
genome, while the absence of a homolog was indicated by the
integer 0. Phylogenetic profiles were then clustered based on
the similarity of profiles, resulting in clusters of genes with
similar profiles and likely related functions.

reports

Proteins were functionally linked by the Rosetta Stone
method if individual proteins were found to be present as a
single fused protein in another organism, as described by
Marcotte et al. [10]. In this case, if individual M. tuberculosis
proteins have significant homology to distinct regions of a
single 'fusion' protein in another organism then they are indicated as functionally linked by this method. A probabilistic
score is calculated by estimating the likelihood of observing
Rosetta Stone proteins given the number of homologs each
protein has.

same direction (WD) that belong to operons

reviews

A database consisting of the gene name, start coordinate, end
coordinate and gene orientation was constructed and
employed to determine functional links between genes using
distance and orientation parameters. A series of genes is considered functionally linked if the nucleotide distance between
genes in the same orientation was less than or equal to a specified distance threshold. Multiple genes were linked if a series
of genes in the same orientation all had intergenic distances
less than or equal to the defined distance threshold, as shown
in Figure 1b.

comment

The keyword recovery of random links is calculated by establishing the same number of random pairwise links between
SWISS-PROT annotated genes as there is for real links, and
calculating the keyword recovery as described above.
