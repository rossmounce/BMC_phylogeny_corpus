Abstract
Background: Ariids or sea catfishes are one of the two otophysan fish families (out of about 67
families in four orders) that inhabit mainly marine and brackish waters (although some species
occur strictly in fresh waters). The group includes over 150 species placed in ~29 genera and two
subfamilies (Galeichthyinae and Ariinae). Despite their global distribution, ariids are largely
restricted to the continental shelves due in part to their specialized reproductive behavior (i.e., oral
incubation). Thus, among marine fishes, ariids offer an excellent opportunity for inferring historical
biogeographic scenarios. Phylogenetic hypotheses available for ariids have focused on restricted
geographic areas and comprehensive phylogenies are still missing. This study inferred phylogenetic
hypotheses for 123 ariid species in 28 genera from different biogeographic provinces using both
mitochondrial and nuclear sequences (up to ~4 kb).
Results: While the topologies obtained support the monophyly of basal groups, up to ten genera
validated in previous morphological studies were incongruent with the molecular topologies. New
World ariines were recovered as paraphyletic and Old World ariines were grouped into a wellsupported clade that was further divided into subclades mainly restricted to major Gondwanan
landmasses. A general area cladogram derived from the area cladograms of ariines and three other
fish groups was largely congruent with the geological area cladogram of Gondwana. Nonetheless,
molecular clock estimations provided variable results on the timing of ariine diversification (~10541 mya).
Conclusion: This study provides the most comprehensive phylogeny of sea catfishes to date and
highlights the need for re-assessment of their classification. While from a topological standpoint the
evolutionary history of ariines is mostly congruent with vicariance associated with the sequence of
events during Gondwanan fragmentation, ambiguous divergence time estimations hinders assessing
the vicariant hypothesis on a temporal framework. Further examination of ariid fossils might
provide the basis for more accurate inferences on the timing of ariine diversification.

Background
The catfish order Siluriformes is a very diverse natural
group that occurs primarily in freshwater. Catfishes are
widespread and their distribution encompasses all conti-

nents, even Antarctica, as evidenced by Eocene-Oligocene
fossils [1]. The order includes 36 extant families and over
3000 valid species plus an estimated ~1500 undescribed
species [2,3]. Several morphological and molecular studPage 1 of 18

ies have addressed the relationships among catfish families [e.g., [4-6]] and recent evidence indicates that large
basal clades are restricted to particular continental masses,
suggesting a long history of intercontinental isolation [6].
Thus, catfishes offer an exceptional opportunity for studying evolutionary and biogeographic trends. The fossil
record of Siluriformes is relatively well represented and
includes material from every continent [7]. Although the
earliest fossils date back to the Late Campanian-Early
Maastrichtian (ca. 68-73 mya), molecular clocks predict a
much older origin for Siluriformes (i.e., 175-130 mya [810]).
While most catfishes inhabit freshwater, only two families
are well represented in marine environments: the Plotosidae from the Indo-West Pacific and the Ariidae. The Ariidae, or sea catfishes, is the only siluriform group with a
global distribution that includes over 150 species occurring in warm-temperate to tropical regions. Although
most members of the family live in brackish and marine
waters, several species occur in freshwater as well. Sea catfish distributions include the continental margins of the
Eastern Pacific and the Western Atlantic (New World), the
Eastern Atlantic (Western Africa), and the Indo-West
Pacific (Eastern Africa, Madagascar, India-SE Asia, and
Australia-New Guinea; Figure 1). Ariids play an important
role in tropical fisheries, with many species having high

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/175

economic value due to their large size, local abundance,
and flesh quality. Some species have been recently listed
as vulnerable on the IUCN red list [11].
Members of the Ariidae exhibit a specialized reproductive
mode: male mouthbrooding of eggs and embryos. This
condition is absent in nearly all other catfishes, the sole
exception being the biparental mouthbrooding claroteid
Phyllonemus typus [12]. Oral incubation means ariids have
limited dispersal capabilities and subsequent high level of
species endemism, which has ultimately resulted in continentally restricted distributions. In fact, ariids are absent
from the Pacific plate [13], the nonmarginal portion of
the Antilles, and other oceanic islands of recent volcanic
origin [14]. Restriction of most species to the continental
shelves make ariids an exceptional marine fish group to
infer historical biogeography scenarios (although see [14]
for evidence of recent transoceanic dispersal in Galeichthys). Such studies require a conceptual framework
derived from robust phylogenetic hypotheses.
Recent interfamilial phylogenies based on morphological
[15,16] and molecular [6] data have placed the Malagasy
family Anchariidae as sister to the Ariidae and both families are ascribed in the superfamily Arioidea within the
suborder Siluroidei [6]. The monophyly of the Ariidae has
not been seriously questioned and is strongly supported

on both molecular and morphological grounds [6,15,17].
The group is divided into two subfamilies, the monogeneric Galeichthyinae (four species) and the Ariinae
(remaining taxa) [17]. Although the basal arioid clades
are well defined, much controversy has arisen regarding
the phylogeny and classification of ariid taxa, particularly
within the diverse Ariinae.
Recent studies that have attempted to elucidate relationships among ariids have mostly focused on taxa from
restricted geographic areas and comprehensive phylogenies are still missing. Using anatomical data, Kailola [15]
inferred relationships for 45 Old World and eight New
World species (Figure 2A) and provided a revised classification accepting 23 genera. Based on combined evidence
from mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data in addition to morphological characters [modified from [18]],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/175

Betancur-R. et al. [19] hypothesized relationships for 46
New World and three Old World species (Figure 2B) and
provided a revised classification for New World taxa only,
validating eight genera. Although the studies by Kailola
and Betancur-R. et al. dealt with different taxon-sampling
schemes, their resulting topologies are highly incongruent
regarding the position of Galeichthys and the Indo-Pacific
Ketengus typus and Cryptarius truncatus (Figure 2). In his
unpublished doctoral dissertation, A. P. Marceniuk
inferred phylogenetic relationships for 80 ariid species
from different biogeographic provinces using morphological characters [20]. Following the results derived from
this work, Marceniuk and Menezes [21] presented the
most inclusive taxonomy for the Ariidae to date, recognizing 26 genera. More recently, Betancur-R. and Armbruster
[14] inferred molecular phylogenies for the four species of
galeichthyines showing that the Eastern Pacific species (G.

schemes, and both topologies are highly incongruent regarding the position of Galeichthys, Ketengus typus and Cryptarius truncatus.

peruvianus) is nested within a clade comprising the
remaining three African species, and that the timing of
intercontinental divergence occurred from Mid to Late
Miocene, likely implying transoceanic dispersal. As will be
discussed below, not only the molecular and the anatomical hypotheses differ markedly, but also the two morphological classifications show considerable disagreement.
This study expands previous molecular phylogenies on
New World ariids and galeichthyines using mitochondrial
sequences (cytochrome b, ATP synthase 8/6, 12S, and 16S;
~3 kb) and a nuclear marker (rag2, ~1 kb) to cover a wide
spectrum of taxa from different biogeographic provinces.
In addition to the 63 ariid species examined previously
[14,19], new molecular data was obtained for 60 other
species. These data were utilized for three main purposes:
(1) hypothesize ariid relationships via maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian
inference (BI) reconstruction criteria; (2) discuss morphological phylogenies and current classifications in the light
of molecular phylogenies; and (3) infer historical biogeography scenarios for the Ariinae using cladistic and
chronological methods. This study provides the most
inclusive phylogeny of ariid taxa to date and a resource for
future classifications and other comparative studies in the
family.

Results and discussion
Dataset attributes
All sequences obtained during this and previous studies
[6,14,19,22-33] are available from GenBank under accession numbers listed in Additional file 1. The final alignment of the mitochondrial protein coding genes included
1095 bp for partial cyt b and 842 bp for ATPase 8/6 [see
details in [19]]. Indels were only observed in ATPase 8,
where Cinetodus carinatus, ten species of Notarius (including N. lentiginosus), and 'Sciades'sagor lacked a codon 108,
111, and 141 bases downstream of the start codon,
respectively. For ATPase 6, three initiation codons were
observed: UUG in S. sagor and the species of the subgenus
Cathorops, GUG in Notarius planiceps, Notarius aff. planiceps, and N. lentiginosus, and the typical AUG in the
remaining taxa. Likewise, N. lentiginosus presented UUG
instead of AUG in ATPase 8. The start codons GUG and
UUG have been shown to be less efficient variants of AUG
in some genes [34]. In addition to the differences
observed in Notarius lentiginosus and S. sagor at the amino
acid level, both species revealed the highest variation in
substitution rates of mtDNA among ariid taxa (Figure 3B).
It is noteworthy that no ambiguous chromatogram readings, stop codons or frameshifts were observed in these
two species, suggesting that these sequences are likely not
pseudogenes.

Partial ribosomal 12S and 16S sequences ranged in size
from 385 to 394 bp and 556 to 571 bp, with final align-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/175

ment lengths of 406 and 595 bp, respectively. In the final
alignments, 18 sites of 12S and 54 sites of 16S were
excluded due to ambiguous positional homology. The
mitochondrial dataset assembled included 129 terminal
taxa (124 arioid species including one anchariid, four
galeichthyines, and 119 ariines) and 2866 sites. The dataset had missing data for Notarius luniscutis in ATPase 8/6
(due to amplification failure) and for Cathorops manglarensis (65 bp at 3' end) and N. lentiginosus (35 bp at 3' end)
in 16S (due to polymerase slippage producing noisy
sequences). Many other taxa also had missing data on
sequence ends due to noisy chromatogram reads. Considering only arioid taxa, the mitochondrial alignment contained 1273 (44.4%) variable sites and 1097 (38.3%)
parsimony-informative sites, respectively.
The nuclear rag2 gene has been shown to have low variability within the Ariidae [19], thus nuclear sequences were
obtained only from major lineages (as indicated by the
mitochondrial topologies) representing all biogeographic
provinces and sampled genera (73 species). Due to amplicon-length variation from different primer combinations
or noisy chromatogram endings, in the nuclear rag2 alignment not all ingroup taxa had the same sequence length,
varying from 837 to 978 bp; outgroups had 720 bp
[obtained from [6,23]]. No insertions or deletions were
observed in the rag2 dataset. The number of variable and
parsimony-informative sites for the ingroup in the rag2
dataset were 174 (17.8%) and 67 (6.9%), respectively. In
addition to the mitochondrial and nuclear partitions, a
combined dataset including 73 common taxa was assembled (73 species, 3844 sites, 1525 variable sites, 1157 parsimony-informative sites).
Phylogenetic inference
Optimality results obtained under different analyses and
model testing on the three data partitions are summarized
in Table 1. Among the four reconstruction methods conducted (MP, ML-Garli, ML-RAxML, BI) on the mitochondrial dataset, BI analysis resulted in the least resolved tree.
The BI consensus is shown in Figure 3; congruent nodes
recovered under other methods are indicated by thicker
lines. As found in previous molecular studies [6,19], the
superfamily Arioidea sensu Sullivan et al. was recovered as
monophyletic, with the Anchariidae sister to the Ariidae
(all nodes strongly supported). The subfamilial divisions
within the Ariidae (Galeichthyinae and Ariinae) were fully
congruent among different methods and well supported.
The relationships within the Galeichthyinae and among
New World ariine genera are basically identical to those
reported in previous molecular studies [14,19] (Figure
2B). The new finding is that the genus Genidens from the
Western Atlantic (previously not examined) was monophyletic and sister to the monotypic Occidentarius from
the Eastern Pacific (node F, Figure 3).

Delimitations of New World genera [sensu [19]] were
congruent with the mitochondrial topologies; however,
seven Old Word genera [sensu [21]] were found to be
non-monophyletic (Figure 3, colored taxa; see below). In
general, the relationships among basal ariine taxa were
poorly resolved or supported, with short internodes (Figure 3B). While New World taxa were not monophyletic in
any of the analyses, Old World ariines were grouped into
a well-supported clade (node I, Figure 3). The basal nodes
linking some New World genera (e.g., Occidentarius, Genidens, Potamarius, Ariopsis, and Sciades) to the Old World
clade were often incongruent among different reconstruction criteria and poorly supported (node E, Figure 3).
Within the Old World clade, taxa were generally grouped
into well-defined biogeographic assemblages (Figure 3,
colored bars). Overall inshore species conform to major
Gondwanan provinces (Africa, Madagascar, India-SE Asia,
and Australia-New Guinea or Sahul). Delimitations and
nodal supports for such groups were high, except for the
India-SE Asia assemblage that was often recovered as nonmonophyletic with the Madagascar species (Arius mada-

gascariensis) nested within. Offshore taxa found widely
distributed along Indo-West Pacific shelves fell into three
categories: the genera Netuma (Indo-West Pacific 1) and
Plicofollis (Indo-West Pacific 2), and Brustiarius proximus
(Indo-West Pacific 3, nested within the Australia-New
Guinea clade; Figure 3). Resolution among Old World
biogeographic clades was poor, except for the sister-relationship between Australia-New Guinea and Plicofollis
(node N, Figure 3), which was fully congruent and well
supported.
The India-SE group comprised two well-supported basal
clades, with one including 'Sciades' sagor, Cephalocassis
melanochir, and Hemiarius stormii (node K, Figure 3) and
other grouping the remaining taxa (node L, Figure 3). The
latter clade was largely unresolved. The relationships
within Netuma, Carlarius, and Plicofollis were entirely
resolved with high nodal support. There was poor resolution within the Australia-New Guinea assemblage (node
O, Figure 3), except for the following well supportedclades: Brustiarius proximus + Amissidens hainesi (node P,

Figure 3); Neoarius (in part; node Q, Figure 3); node R
(Figure 3): node S (Potamosilurus, in part) + node T (Cinetodus carinatus, ('Sciades' utarus, (B. nox, B. solidus))); Pachyula crassilabris + Doiichthys novaeguineae + Nedystoma dayi
(node V, Figure 3); and Cochlefelis (in part; node W,
Figure 3).
The congruences between methods and data partitions
(mitochondrial, nuclear, and combined) are summarized
in Additional file 2. There was strong phylogenetic signal
in the mitochondrial dataset, often yielding well-resolved
and well-supported nodes. The weak signal and the small
number of characters in the nuclear rag2 dataset (67 parsimony-informative sites) resulted in the greatest number
of incongruent nodes (Additional file 2). Although using
a more reduced taxon-sampling scheme, the combined
partition yielded highly congruent topologies as compared to the mitochondrial topologies. The major difference is that the combined scheme recovered the India-SE
Asia group as monophyletic in all topologies (only MP
and ML-Garli in the mitochondrial partition), but failed
to place the Madagascar species sister to the India-SE Asia
clade. Incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear

datasets may be alternatively due to gene-tree/species-tree
conflicts [35,36]. Thus, given this situation, further exploration of ariid phylogeny should emphasize the inclusion
of additional, independent nuclear markers.
The lack of resolution and short internodes evidenced
among basal ariine lineages is consistent with the reconstructions conducted on the mitochondrial, nuclear, and
combined partitions. Given that mitochondrial and
nuclear markers contain different levels of signal [19], this
pattern may be the result of rapid ariine radiations; however, further analyses are required to test this hypothesis
[see [37]].
Morphological hypotheses, classifications, and alpha
taxonomy
The morphological phylogeny hypothesized by Kailola
(Figure 2A) differs substantially from molecular topologies (Figure 3; Table 2). Of the 34 possible nodes common
to both datasets (mitochondrial partition), only eight
clades are congruent (Figure 2A, asterisks). Further MP
and ML reconstructions constraining Kailola's topology
into the mitochondrial dataset yielded scores significantly

Results obtained with Templeton and Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) tests of topology congruence between trees constrained under the morphological
hypotheses and unconstrained trees (significant p values in bold). Hypothesis testing was performed on Kailola's phylogeny [15] (see Figure 2A) and
those genera defined by Kailola [15] and Marceniuk and Menezes [21] that were recovered as non-monophyletic (see also Figure 3). For generic
comparisons, only one node was constrained. Taxa in constrained clade include common species only; however, for some comparisons the number
of taxa with enforced monophyly is greater than the number of taxa assigned to a particular genus in previous studies due to the greater number of
species recognized here (e.g., affinis entities).

worse than those obtained under unconstrained searches
(Templeton and SH tests; Table 2). Some of the most striking differences between the two hypotheses are the nested
position of Galeichthys, the basal position and non-monophyly of Old World taxa, and the polyphyly of Genidens in
Kailola's cladogram. Thus, Kailola's topology does not
support the Galeichthyinae and Ariinae as basal subfamilial divisions. Remarkably, unlike the molecular topologies, there are no distinguishable biogeographic patterns
in the morphological hypothesis as ariine taxa from different regions appear randomly scattered across the tree.
Based on Hennig's [38] principle of reciprocal illumination, congruence between biogeography and phylogeny
provides a logical framework to favor the molecular over
the morphological hypothesis.
Conflicts in phylogenetic hypotheses also have profound
implications on the classification. Despite their economic
importance, the taxonomy of the Ariidae has for a long
time remained in a chaotic state and is probably the most
unresolved among catfish families [3]. This has caused a
vast nomenclatural instability with species commonly
jumping from one genus to another. Even the three recent
studies that have addressed the classification of ariids
reveal considerable disagreement [15,19,21]. The results
presented here also differ from previous classifications in
several aspects.
Despite the more restricted taxon sampling, the previous
classification of New World taxa based on combined
molecular and morphological characters [19] is fully congruent with current topologies. This study also validates
the status and confirms monophyly of the New World
genus Genidens [not included in [19]]. The major conflicts
concern the morphology-based taxonomies as ten genera
recognized by Kailola [15] and nine by Marceniuk and
Menezes [21] (Figure 3A) were not monophyletic in any
of the reconstructions conducted on the mitochondrial
partition (broadest taxon sampling). Furthermore, Templeton and SH tests constraining each non-monophyletic
genus into the mitochondrial dataset identified strong
departures from congruence in 16 (nine in [15]; seven in
[21]) out of the 19 comparisons (Table 2). Similar results
were also obtained on reconstructions performed on single-gene partitions (results not shown).
The definition and delimitation of most conflicting genera not only differ markedly among the two anatomical
studies, but also have no logical biogeographical circumscriptions. For instance, the genera Ariopsis, Aspistor, and
Hemiarius sensu Kailola and Sciades sensu Marceniuk and
Menezes are ubiquitous and comprise numerous unrelated species/clades (>16 species in Ariopsis and Sciades).
Likewise, Hexanematichthys and Nemapteryx sensu Kailola
both include species that belong either in the India-SE

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/175

Asia or the Australia-New Guinea clades. Interestingly,
Hexanematichthys sensu Kailola provides a remarkable
example of morphological convergence (Figure 4). As
defined by Kailola, Hexanematichthys includes two species
('Sciades'sagor from India-SE Asia and S. mastersi from Australia-New Guinea) and is diagnosed by the presence of a
broad and depressed head, a short and broad supraoccipital process, a large butterfly-shaped nuchal plate, and a
dark peritoneum, among other features [15] (some of
these characteristics also present in the Neotropical Sciades and some Notarius [21,39]). While there is an extraordinary similarity between the neurocrania (and other
features) of S. sagor and S. mastersi (Figure 4) and the morphological phylogeny places the two species as sister taxa
(Figure 2A), the monophyly of Hexanematichthys is not
supported by the molecular data (Figure 3; Table 2).
Cephalocassis (from SE Asia) and Cinetodus (from Australia-New Guinea) are additional examples of genera that
are reasonably well established morphologically
(although their delimitations vary in Kailola [15] and
Marceniuk [21]), but incongruent on a molecular basis
(Table 2). Noteworthy, Cephalocassis melanochir and C.
borneensis are two of the eight purely freshwater species
found in SE Asia. Both species share several features,
including a fenestra between the supraoccipital, the pterotic, and the sphenotic, unique among ariids [[15,21]: Fig.
thirtyseven]. Their morphological similarity may be the
result of convergence associated with the transitions
between marine and freshwaters.
The genus Arius has been one of the major problems concerning ariid systematics. As traditionally recognized,
Arius is the largest and most widespread genus in the family [e.g., [40,41]]. All recent studies [15,19,21] concur that
the genus includes considerably fewer species than was
previously accepted (< 25) and, unlike prior classifications, no New World species are currently placed in Arius.
Although Arius sensu Kailola was not recovered as monophyletic, it is restricted to the India-SE Asia province and
the topology with enforced monophyly was not rejected
by the mitochondrial data. Similarly, the monophyly of
Arius sensu Marceniuk and Menezes is not rejected by the
topological tests, but only if the Malagasy species (A.
madagascariensis) is excluded (Table 2). From a phylogenetic standpoint, the present results also suggest that the
genera Netuma and Sciades sensu Kailola and Brustiarius,
Cochlefelis, Neoarius, and Potamosilurus sensu Marceniuk
and Menezes each include only a few species incorrectly
assigned to them.
In the light of the classification adopted for this study (see
Materials and Methods), Notarius [sensu [19]], Cathorops,
Arius, and Plicofollis are among the most species-rich genera in the family. Delimitation of the Neotropical Notarius
sensu Marceniuk and Menezes is similar to that of Betan-

A remarkable example of morphological convergence. The genus Hexanematichthys sensu Kailola [15] includes two
species ('Sciades' sagor and S. mastersi) and is defined by the presence of a broad and depressed head, a short and broad
supraoccipital process (SP) and a large butterfly-shaped nuchal plate (NP), among other features. While the neurocrania of S.
sagor and S. mastersi are most similar in this sample, the molecular evidence suggests that they are more closely related to Arius
nenga (India-SE Asia clade) and Cochlefelis dioctes (Australia-New Guinea clade), respectively (see Figure 3). Also, Templeton
and SH tests reject monophyly of Hexanematichthys (see Table 2). (A), AUM 46280, 87 mm cranial length (CL); (B), AUM

cur-R. et al., except that Marceniuk and Menezes placed N.
rugispinis and N. phrygiatus in their new genus Amphiarius,
and N. luniscutis and N. quadriscutis in Aspistor. Validating
Amphiarius and Aspistor would render Notarius paraphyletic (although in some analyses Aspistor was recovered as sister to all other Notarius; see Table 2). Aspistor was
also recognized by Kailola but with a different circumscription, including seven species of Notarius sensu Betancur-R. plus Hemiarius hardenbergi (from Australia-New
Guinea) and Occidentarius platypogon. The monophyly of
Notarius sensu Marceniuk and Aspistor sensu Kailola are
not supported by the molecular evidence (Table 2). A consensus solution for Notarius would be providing subgeneric assignments.
Molecular evidence also brings new perspectives at the
alpha taxonomy level. While recent taxonomic check lists
estimate that the number of valid ariid species range from
125 to 136 ([15,21]; plus five more recent additions [4244]), there are 53 species designated as inquirendae in the
family (i.e., uncertain validity), the greatest number
within the order Siluriformes [3,39]. The major difficulties in undertaking a comprehensive taxonomic study of
the Ariidae are the overall similarity in external morphology, the widespread distribution of the group coupled
with the high degree of species endemism, and the poor

representation of species diversity in museums [see also
[21]]. Although estimating the total number of valid species is a challenging task, examination of wide variety of
taxa on both mitochondrial and/or morphological
grounds enabled identification of 20 putative undescribed/unrecognized species (referred as affinis or sp.; see
Materials and Methods). The alpha taxonomy of the Ariidae is in need of revision.
Despite the recent efforts to clarify ariid taxonomy
[15,19,21], these results show that it is still far from settled. This instability prevents an adequate management of
the fisheries, making ariids a difficult group for conservational purposes. A total evidence approach based on combined morphological and molecular data would provide
a suitable framework to redefine genera and to reassess
the classification of the Ariidae. This issue will be
addressed elsewhere.
Historical biogeography of the Ariinae
-The evolutionary history of ariines from a topological perspective
Presently, ariid distribution encompasses the New World,
Africa, Madagascar, India-SE Asia, and the Sahul continent
(Figure 1); however, as evidenced by the fossil record, the
group also ranged into Europe until the Late Miocene. The
current poor representation of catfishes in Europe has
Page 9 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:175

been attributed to extinctions caused by Pleistocene glaciations [45]. While galeichthyines are restricted to subtropical waters in southern Africa and southwestern South
America, sea catfishes owe their broad distribution to ariines. The disjunct biogeography of galeichthyines was
recently addressed [14], thus this section focuses on ariines only.
The presence of ariines on major landmasses of the southern hemisphere suggests (a priori) a Gondwanan vicariance [but see [46,47]]. To further test this hypothesis, the
biogeography of the Ariinae was approached under topological and chronological frameworks. Area cladograms
for Gondwana (based on geological data) and ariine taxa
(based on combined evidence trees), and general area
cladograms derived from various fish groups are shown in
Figure 5. Different reconstruction methods yielded different topologies (Additional file 2), thus ariine area cladograms were derived from MP (Figure 5B) and ML (Figure
5C) trees (BI and ML topologies are congruent/combinable). The reconstructions indicate that New World ariines
are basal and paraphyletic while Old World taxa form a
nested clade further subdivided into groups endemic to
major areas (i.e., Africa, Madagascar, India-SE Asia and
Australia-New Guinea).
In addition to the marked biogeographic associations, the
Old World clade includes two subclades with widespread
Indo-West Pacific distributions (Netuma and Plicofollis).
Likewise, although Brustiarius proximus is nested within
the Australia-New Guinea clade, its range extends into SE
Asia (reported here for the first time). DIVA analyses indicate that the presence of B. proximus in SE Asia is most parsimoniously the result of dispersal from Australia-New
Guinea. Thus, for component analyses, B. proximus is
treated as a Sahul taxon. Inferring the biogeographic history of the widespread Netuma and Plicofollis is less
straightforward because of ambiguous relationships
among major Old World clades (Figs. 5B, C). According to
DIVA optimizations on the mitochondrial dataset (broadest taxon sampling), the distribution of the common Plicofollis ancestor was either India-SE Asia or the composite
India-SE Asia/Australia-New Guinea, whereas the ancestral distribution of Netuma was India-SE Asia/AustraliaNew Guinea.
Overall, the major differences between ariine (Figs. 5B, C)
and geological area cladograms (Figure 5A) are the
absence of ariine endemics from Sulawesi and the Seychelles and the lack of a close relationship between New
World and African taxa. However, further analyses constraining the monophyly of the New World node G
(Potamarius + Ariopsis + Sciades; see Figure 3) plus the African genus Carlarius, yielded scores similar to those
obtained under unconstrained searches (SH test p value =
0.35; Templeton test p value = 0. 06–0.29). Similarly,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/175

while the placement of Australia-New Guinea, India-SE
Asia, and Madagascar is variable among different reconstructions (Figs. 5B, C) and the predicted area relationship
based on the Gondwanan model was not recovered (but
see Garli ML reconstructions on the mitochondrial dataset; Additional file 2), additional analyses enforcing the
Australia-New Guinea + (India-SE Asia + Madagascar)
topology are not statistically rejected by the data (SH test
p value = 0.472; Templeton test p value = 0.35–0.54; note
that Netuma and Plicofollis were excluded from the analysis
because their widespread distributions).
Component analyses on both MP and ML topologies
derived identical general area cladograms (Figure 5E). The
general fish area cladogram based on ariines, cichlids,
aplocheiloid killifishes, and rainbowfishes (Figure 5E) is
largely congruent with Sparks and Smith's [48] general
area cladogram derived from the latter three groups only
(Figure 5D) and the geological area cladogram (Figure
5A). The main difference is the truncated placement of
Australia-New Guinea and India-SE Asia (Figure 5).
Although ariines are predominantly marine and therefore
potentially capable of dispersing along contiguous intercontinental shelves (e.g., Netuma, Plicofollis, Brustiarius
proximus), the fact that most taxa with limited dispersal
capabilities were grouped into major Gondwanan clades
and that relationships among these clades largely coincide
(or at least are not significantly incongruent) with the geological history of the super continent, suggest vicariance
via continental drift. While restricted distributions are the
generalized condition within the Ariinae, widespread
Indo-West Pacific taxa are derived from three independent
acquisitions (Figure 3). If dispersal is historically the
major force driving ariine biogeography, no provincial
associations would be observed. As pointed out by Sparks
and Smith [49] for cichlids, a close relationship between
African and Malagasy taxa across the Mozambique canal
is expected under a dispersalist model. However, the
reconstructions presented here offer no evidence for AfroMalagasy clades (although the two ariine species from
Eastern Africa were not examined). Similarly, the sharp
faunal division across Wallace's line (dividing SE-Asia and
Australia-New Guinea plates) of most (i.e., non-widespread) ariine taxa disfavors dispersal acting as a homogenizing force. The collision of the India subcontinent into
Asia 43 mya [50,51] permitted faunal dispersal to SE Asia
but not to the Australia-New Guinea plate due to deep
oceanic barriers preventing faunal exchange across Wallace's line (except for the three Indo-Pacific taxa found in
SE Asia and Australia-New Guinea). Remarkably, with the
exception being the basal node linking New and Old
World ariines (e.g., node E, Figure 3), the topologies do
not show any transpacific or transatlantic nested clades
within the Ariinae, supporting the idea that sea catfishes
have limited transoceanic dispersal capability (but see

[14] for evidence of recent dispersal from Africa to South
America in the Galeichthyinae). As Sparks and Smith [49]
argued, not only freshwater fishes in the primary division
but also continentally restricted marine groups may be of
great value for inferring ancient land connections.
The presence of ariines in non-Gondwanan areas such as
Mesoamerica/North America and Europe (until Late
Miocene) was probably the result of contiguous intercontinental marine dispersal from South America and perhaps Africa, respectively. In support for this scenario,
DIVA analyses derived from the mitochondrial dataset
(broadest taxon sampling) indicates South America as
center of origin for New World taxa. Given that extant ariids are absent from Europe (but see records of the African
Carlarius parkii in the Mediterranean [52]) further morphological studies including European fossils are required
to test dispersal into this continent.
-The timing of ariine diversification in the context of Gondwanan
vicariance
Recent studies have shown a variety of floral and faunal
taxa whose disjunct distributions in the southern hemisphere, previously associated with Gondwanan vicariance, likely represent instances of transoceanic dispersal.
Particularly, molecular dating techniques have revealed
divergence times that are too young to be explained by
continental-drift vicariance. Remarkable examples of
recent transoceanic dispersal include geckos, monkeys,
lemurs, carnivores, chameleons, frogs, insects, and several
angiosperm families, among others [reviewed in [46]].
Contemporary advocates of dispersal even argue that
vicariance should be revaluated as the most likely a priori
assumption in biogeography [e.g., [46,47]]. Accordingly,
it seems appropriate to test the Gondwanan hypothesis of
ariine diversification in a chronological framework.

The final separation of South America and Africa is dated
to be as recent as 105 mya [53,54], Madagascar and India
separated at about 95-84 mya [51,55,56], and Australia
and Antarctica initiated rifting 95 mya but remained connected until at least 35 mya [57]. While the temporal context for the separation of India-Madagascar from the
major Gondwanan landmass is more controversial
[56,58], it has been suggested that the Kerguelen Plateau
served as a corridor allowing exchange of terrestrial and
freshwater faunas between India-Madagascar and Australia via Antarctica until about 80 mya [48,51,58]. Before
the Eocene, Antarctica had a temperate climate and
included fish fauna found at lower latitudes today [59],
such as catfishes reported from the Eocene/Oligocene
boundary [1]. Likewise, after the fragmentation of Gondwana, shallow marine connections between major landmasses might have remained open until ~80 mya (e.g.,
Africa and South America at 84 mya [53]) or later permit-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/175

ting exchange of continentally-restricted marine taxa such
as ariines.
Under the Gondwanan model a Mesozoic origin of major
ariine clades is predicted. Previous studies addressing the
timing of catfish diversification provide no support for
this scenario. Lundberg et al. [10] inferred nodal ages for
siluriform families using nuclear rag1 and rag2 sequences
and seven fossil calibration points via Bayesian relaxed
clocks (BRC) and penalized likelihood analyses. Their
divergence time estimation for arioids and ariines is ~73
my and ~20 my, respectively [[10]: Fig. 2]. It is remarkable, however, that Lundberg et al. arbitrarily selected 144
my (informed by the fossil record of actinopterygians) as
the maximum age constraint for the split of gymnotiforms
and siluriforms. While addressing the timing of galeichthyine intercontinental disjunction, Betancur-R. and Armbruster [14] inferred 94-74 my (95% credibility interval
104-69 my) for the arioid split and 40 my (95% credibility interval 59-29 my) for the ariine split based on mitochondrial sequences and three calibration points. Instead
of fixing the root of the tree to an arbitrary age, they used
minimum and maximum age constraints on a terminal
node based on the rising of the Panama isthmus 3.1-2.8
mya. In order to provide more accurate estimates on the
divergence time of basal nodes in the arioid tree, this
study selected 18 calibration points on two deep osteichthyan nodes, six non-arioid catfish nodes, and five arioid
nodes (Additional file 3).
Divergence times for selected nodes derived from uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) and BRC analyses are shown
in Table 3. Both methods provided divergent estimations
on the temporal context of ariine diversification. The BRC
analyses estimated much older (~twofold greater) divergence times for most nodes than UCLN model. For
instance, according to BRC analyses, the Ariinae stem
group originated 104.8-63.9 mya (95% credibility intervals 162.2-50.0 my) and the split between New World
and Old World ariines occurred 80.6-49.4 mya (95%
credibility intervals 136.4-45.7 my); the UCLN model
inferred 50.6-41.4 my (95% highest posterior density limits 69.8-33.4 my) and 37.8-35.1 my (95% highest posterior density limits 51.5-26.4 my), respectively (Table 3).
The dates obtained with UCLN model, although most
similar to those reported in previous studies [10,14], offer
little support for a Gondwanan origin of ariines. Conversely, the divergence times inferred using BRC are
within the range of those predicted under the vicariant
model (Table 3). Similar discrepancies on the timing of
cichlid divergence in the context of Gondwanan vicariance are reported in recent molecular studies. Based on
molecular clock analyses, Vences et al. [60] inferred a
Cenozoic origin for cichlids (consistent with the fossil
record) suggesting recent transatlantic dispersal from

Africa to South America. In contrast, Azuma et al. [61]
inferred divergence times for cichlids that are consistent
with a Gondwanan origin during the Cretaceous [see also
[62]]. While the latter hypothesis is more widely accepted
[e.g., [49,62], but see [63]], interestingly, different calibrations and methods have inferred ages for cichlids that are
two- to three-fold different.
While cross-validation procedures for the nine fossilbased nodes suggest no internal conflicts, several calibration points are outside the arioid tree and thus may not be
much informative (Additional file 3). It is also noteworthy that, following the recommendations outlined in Lundberg et al. [10], minimum age constraints based on
fossils were applied one node below the pertinent taxon
(e.g., ariid fossils of Late Campanian-Early Maastrichtian
were assigned to the split of ariids and anchariids).
Although conservative, this procedure may have resulted
in underestimated nodal ages (at least for UCLN dates).
An alternative solution for improving accuracy on divergence time estimates of basal arioid nodes could come
from assigning additional ariid fossils to particular subclades. However, such work requires an exhaustive morphological examination of both fossil and recent taxa.
Among catfish families, ariids include the oldest and most
abundant elements in the fossil record. Ariid fossils have
been identified from bony (48 localities) and otolith (68
localities) remains [7] and the fragments are widespread,
including records from North and South America, Europe,
Asia, and Africa. The oldest ariid fossils date from the Late
Campanian-Early Maastrichtian in North and South
America. Old World fossil remains also include Maastrichtian otoliths assigned to the Ariidae, but the oldest
bony elements are from the lowermost Eocene (Europe,

Africa and Asia) [7,64]. Considering that the stratigraphic
record indicates that by the Early Maastrichtian (~70 mya)
ariids were already widely distributed [see [7]: Fig. seventeen part 2], the origin of the group might be older, implying a failure of preservation and/or detection of ancient
fossils. If that is the case, a precise assignment of the oldest
known specimens to particular ariid subclades might provide more accurate molecular clock estimations in support of the vicariant scenario.

Conclusion
This study utilized mitochondrial, nuclear, and combined
(up to ~4 kb) sequence data to infer phylogenies for arioids based on the most comprehensive taxon sampling to
date (124 species/entities). While the reconstructions support the monophyly of basal groups (Arioidea, Ariidae,
Galeichthyinae, and Ariinae), up to ten ariine genera (out
of 25–30) validated by previous morphological studies
are incongruent with the molecular phylogenies. These
results stress the need for re-assessment of ariid classification.
The topologies recovered New World ariines as paraphyletic and Old World species were grouped into a wellsupported clade. In further disagreement with morphological hypotheses that follow no biogeographic patterns,
the molecular phylogenies group inshore ariine species
into well-defined clades restricted to particular Gondwanan provinces (New World [three to five basal clades],
Africa, Madagascar, India-SE Asia, and Australia-New
Guinea). The general area cladogram derived from the
area cladograms of cichlids, aplocheiloid killifishes, rainbowfishes, and ariines is largely congruent with the temporal sequence of events during the fragmentation of

Gondwana. Nonetheless, the results obtained using BRC
and UCLN methods are too variable, which hinders drawing definitive conclusions on the timing of ariine diversification in the context of Gondwanan vicariance. Further
examination of additional ariid fossils might provide better calibration points for more accurate molecular clock
estimates.

Methods
Taxon sampling
Generic nomenclature for New World and Old World ariids follows Betancur-R. et al. [19] and Marceniuk and
Menezes [21], respectively. The datasets included a total
of 123 ariid species/entities (see below), representing 28
genera and the two subfamilies (Galeichthyinae and Ariinae; ~230 total individuals sequenced). Based on current
check lists and classifications [19,21], all but one ariid
genus (Batrachocephalus) was examined and at least 37
species in 16 genera were not examined due to unavailability of tissue samples. The phylogenetic sampling
includes ariid species from 26 countries and all major biogeographic provinces. One species of the sister family
Anchariidae (Gogo arcuatus) was also included in the
ingroup (Arioidea sensu [6]); three distantly-related catfish families were used as outgroups (Heptapteridae,
Ictaluridae, and Auchenipteridae, listed in [19]). Additional outgroups were also selected for divergence time
estimations (see below). Material examined is listed in
Additional file 1. Institutional abbreviations are as listed
at [65].

For several taxa, two or more individuals were sequenced
for at least one gene region (mostly ATP synthase 8/6). As
many as 15 species revealed significant morphological
and/or molecular (>1.5% genetic divergence) differentiation among localities, suggesting that several potential
undescribed/unrecognized species exist. In such cases, different entities were analyzed as separate terminals, referring the individuals collected close to the type locality (if
known) as the nominal species and the allopatric entities
as affinis (aff.). Undescribed or unidentified species were
listed to the genus level (sp.), whereas dubious identifications were treated as confer (cf.). Old World species placed
in Sciades by Marceniuk and Menezes [21] were referred as
'Sciades' (see Discussion).
DNA data and phylogenetic reconstructions
Targeted mitochondrial regions included partial cytochrome b (cyt b) and complete ATP synthase subunits 8 and
6 (ATPase 8/6) protein-coding genes, and partial 12S and
16S ribosomal genes. Nuclear evidence included partial
recombination activating gene 2 (rag2). Laboratory protocols, PCR conditions, utilized primers, and sequence
alignment procedures are as described in Betancur-R. et al.
[19]. Two additional rag2 primers were designed for sev-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/175

eral ariid taxa that failed to amplify using the combination
MHRAG2-F1 and MHRAG2-R1 [19,66]: rag2.Ari.F, 5'GAGCCTCACAGTGAAAACCCYGAG-3'; rag2.Ari.R, 5'CTCCCTCTCCATCACTGCTGTAC-3'. Different combinations of these four primers yielded successful amplifications in all cases.
Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed under MP,
ML, and BI criteria. The initial conditions used for different analyses are summarized in Table 1. The MP reconstructions were conducted in PAUP* v. 4.0b10 [67] via
heuristic searches with random addition (RA) of
sequences and tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR); clade
support was evaluated using non-parametric bootstrapping with RA and TBR. For ML and BI, the best-fit models
of sequence evolution were estimated using the Akaike
information criterion (AIC) in ModelTest v. 3.7 [68]. All
analyses were run unpartitioned. The ML analyses were
performed in the programs Garli v. 0.951/0.96 [69] and
RAxML v.7.04 [70]. Garli searches were conducted using
automatic termination (genthreshfortopoterm command). RAxML searches were run in the CIPRES portal v.
1.13 [71] under default configurations. ML nodal support
was evaluated in RAxML using the rapid bootstrapping
algorithm with automatic estimation of runs. For both
Garli and RAxML searches, several runs from randomstarting seeds were performed to check convergence of
likelihood scores. Model parameters were estimated
simultaneously (i.e., unfixed). Remaining settings were
left at their default values.
The BI analyses were performed in MrBayes v. 3.1.2 [72]
via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations. The
MCMC analyses were conducted in triplicate using four
chains and sampling trees every 100 generations. Conservatively, 25% of the first trees sampled in each MCMC
run were discarded as burn-in. Marginal probabilities of
summary parameters, consensus phylograms, and posterior probabilities of nodes were estimated from the postburn-in samples of the three independent runs combined
(Table 1). To confirm that post-burn-in trees were sampled from the actual MCMC posterior distribution, marginal parameters (MrBayes log file) were analyzed using
the Effective Sample Size (ESS) statistic in the program
Tracer [73]; ESS greater than 200 suggests that MCMC
searches were run long enough to accurately represent the
posterior distribution [73].
Hypothesis testing
Alternative hypotheses were compared to the molecular
topologies using the parsimony-based nonparametric
Templeton test and the likelihood-based ShimodairaHasegawa (SH) test [74] as implemented in PAUP*. Three
major hypotheses were tested: (1) Kailola's [15] morphological phylogeny (Figure 2A), (2) recent generic classifi-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:175

cations derived from anatomical data [15,21], and (3) a
Gondwanan vicariance model for ariines. A MP tree that
represented a particular hypothesis was estimated using
constrained tree searches in PAUP*. The constrained trees
were compared to the unconstrained MP topologies using
the Templeton test. Likewise, constrained and unconstrained topologies were estimated under ML in Garli and
compared via SH tests (1000 replicates and RELL sampling). For ML comparisons, the best-fit model and
parameters were selected using the AIC.
Biogeographic inferences
Ancestral areas were reconstructed via dispersal-vicariance
analyses as implemented in the program DIVA v. 1.2 [75].
DIVA analyses were performed for inferring: (1) 'center of
origin' for New World ariines (unit areas coded as South
America/southern Central America, Mesoamerica/North
America, Old World); (2) ancestral distribution of basal
ariine lineages and widespread Indo-Pacific taxa (unit
areas coded as New World, Africa, Madagascar, India-SE
Asia, Australia-New Guinea). The number of ancestral
areas was restricted to two using the maxareas command.
All DIVA analyses were run on MP and ML topologies.

An area cladogram was constructed by replacing the
names of terminal taxa with their distributions. The area
cladograms for the Ariinae were compared to those
inferred by Sparks and Smith [48] for cichlids, aplocheiloid killifishes, and rainbowfishes (Melanotaenioidei). A general area cladogram based on the four fish
groups was then derived and compared to the general area
cladogram hypothesized by Sparks and Smith using the
latter three groups only. To handle widespread taxa,
redundant distributions, and missing areas, a component
analysis [76-78] was performed in the program Component v. 2.0 [79,80]. Component analyses were run using
the nearest-neighbor interchanges algorithm by minimizing the number of leaves added. Host without associates
(= missing areas) were treated as missing information.
Widespread associates were dealt under assumption 2
(i.e., areas including widespread taxa have monophyletic,
paraphyletic, or polyphyletic relationships [76-78,81]) by
arbitrarily removing all but one area from the distribution
of each widespread taxon [79,80]. The general fish area
cladograms were further compared to the geological area
cladogram of Gondwanan breakup (summarized by
Sparks and Smith [48] based on Smith et al. [55] and Storey [56]).
Divergence time estimations
Relative rate tests based on likelihood were performed on
eight clades with different nesting hierarchies using the
software r8s v. 1.71 [82,83]. Four out of the eight comparisons suggested significant departures from a clock-like
behavior (p < 0.05). Thus, two different methods that do

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/175

not assume a strict molecular clock were used for chronological estimations, BRC as implemented in Multidivtime
[84] and UCLN as implemented in Beast v. 1.48 [73,85].
BRC analyses were run unpartitioned with detailed procedures outlined in Betancur-R. and Armbruster [14]. The
initial tree was estimated using ML (Garli) on combined
protein-coding sequences (mitochondrial cyt b and
ATPase 8/6, and nuclear rag2). In addition to the combined dataset, based on the recommendations outlined in
Hurley et al. [86], divergence times were also estimated
excluding the entire ATPase 8 fragment as well as third
codon positions of cyt b and ATPase 6 to reduce the effect
of saturated mitochondrial sequences [see also [87]].
Eighteen calibration points on two deep osteichthyan
nodes, six non-arioid catfish nodes, and five arioid nodes
were set as maximum (six points only) and minimum age
constraints based on median fossil ages (see Additional
file 3; material examined is listed in Additional file 1 [after
[7,10,14,33,61,86,88-93]]). To assess internal consistency
among calibration points, fossil-based cross-validation
procedures were performed in r8s under penalized likelihood (PL) using truncated Newton algorithm and fossilconstrained command [94]. Priors for the BRC analyses
were calibrated as follows: rttm, rttmsd, and bigtime
parameters were set to 45.0 (= 450 my; estimated divergence time between sarcopterygians and actinopterygians
[61,88]); rtrate and rtratesd parameters were both set to
the mean value for the total evolution of all branches
from the root to the tip of the tree divided by rttm (rtrate
and rtratesd = 0.0468, combined dataset; rtrate and
rtratesd = 0.0603, reduced dataset). Other priors were set
to their default values and/or as specified in Betancur-R.
and Armbruster [14].
For UCLN analyses, the initial Beast file was generated in
BEAUti [73]. The substitution model was GTR+I+Γ (as
selected by AIC) with base frequencies estimated empirically, using two data partitions (first and second codon
positions combined and third codon positions) for the
complete dataset and three partitions (separate codon
positions) for the reduced dataset. All parameters were
unlinked and mean substitution rate was unfixed. A starting chronogram that replaced the UPGMA default tree
and satisfied all UCLN priors was generated under PL in
r8s. The tree prior parameter selected was Yule process,
which assumes a constant speciation rate per linage and is
more appropriate for species-level phylogenies [73]. Calibration nodes were constrained using lognormal-distribution priors whenever there was confidence that fossils are
close in time to cladogenesis (i.e., the stratigraphic record
is fairly complete [95]; e.g., Osteichthyes and Actinoperi
[61,86,88,89]). As inferred by molecular clock analyses,
the origin of siluriforms (i.e., 175-130 mya [8-10]) is
much older than predicted by the oldest fossil (ca. 68-73
mya), suggesting a gap in the stratigraphic record. Thus,

catfish nodes were constrained under uniform-distributions (Additional file 3). Tree root was set to 450 using
uniform distribution (similar to bigtime parameter in
BRC). Other priors and operators were set to their default
values. The MCMC analyses were run in duplicate for 3 ×
107 generations, sampling trees every 1000 generations.
The MCMC log files were combined in Tracer to summarize posterior divergence times with 95% highest posterior
density limits; ESS values greater than 200 were reached
for all marginal parameters after discarding 20% of the
first trees as burn-in.
