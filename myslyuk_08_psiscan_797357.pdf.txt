Abstract
Background: Detection of non coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules is a major bioinformatics challenge. This challenge is
particularly difficult when attempting to detect H/ACA molecules which are involved in converting uridine to
pseudouridine on rRNA in trypanosomes, because these organisms have unique H/ACA molecules (termed H/ACA-like)
that lack several of the features that characterize H/ACA molecules in most other organisms.
Results: We present here a computational tool called Psiscan, which was designed to detect H/ACA-like molecules in
trypanosomes. We started by analyzing known H/ACA-like molecules and characterized their crucial elements both
computationally and experimentally.
Next, we set up constraints based on this analysis and additional phylogenic and functional data to rapidly scan three
trypanosome genomes (T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major) for sequences that observe these constraints and are conserved
among the species. In the next step, we used minimal energy calculation to select the molecules that are predicted to
fold into a lowest energy structure that is consistent with the constraints. In the final computational step, we used a
Support Vector Machine that was trained on known H/ACA-like molecules as positive examples and on negative
examples of molecules that were identified by the computational analyses but were shown experimentally not to be H/
ACA-like molecules. The leading candidate molecules predicted by the SVM model were then subjected to experimental
validation.
Conclusion: The experimental validation showed 11 molecules to be expressed (4 out of 25 in the intermediate stage
and 7 out of 19 in the final validation after the machine learning stage). Five of these 11 molecules were further shown
to be bona fide H/ACA-like molecules. As snoRNA in trypanosomes are organized in clusters, the new H/ACA-like
molecules could be used as starting points to manually search for additional molecules in their neighbourhood. All
together this study increased our repertoire by fourteen H/ACA-like and six C/D snoRNAs molecules from T. brucei and
L. Major. In addition the experimental analysis revealed that six ncRNA molecules that are expressed are not
downregulated in CBF5 silenced cells, suggesting that they have structural features of H/ACA-like molecules but do not
have their standard function. We termed this novel class of molecules AGA-like, and we are exploring their function.
This study demonstrates the power of tight collaboration between computational and experimental approaches in a
combined effort to reveal the repertoire of ncRNA molecles.

Background
Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are RNA molecules that range
in size from less than a hundred to thousands of nucleotides. These RNAs are transcribed but are not translated.
One of the largest classes of ncRNA in eukaryotes are the
snoRNA (small nucleolar RNA) named based on their
localization to the nucleolus. Such molecules also exist in
Archaea, in which they are termed sRNA [1,2].
The snoRNA class is divided into two major families, C/D
and H/ACA. Their names specify the conserved boxes they
carry. SnoRNAs guide modifications on other RNA molecules, but also function in rRNA processing. C/D snoRNAs
serve as guide RNAs for 2'-O-methylation and H/ACA for
isomerization of uracil to pseudouridine [3-5]. Both the
C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs bind to the site of modification
by direct base pairing with the target RNA. The majority of
these guide RNAs are responsible for the modification of
ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and in some cases of small
nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) [6-10]. Other modification targets include transfer RNAs in Archaea [1], spliced leader
RNAs in trypanosomes [11], and at least one brain-specific mRNA in mammals, serotonin pre-mRNA, in which
snoRNA regulate alternative splicing [12]. Spliceosome
function also depends on the modification of snRNAs by
C/D and H/ACA RNAs, since these modifications exist in
the U snRNA domains that are involved in the RNA-RNA
interactions that take place during the splicing reaction
[13]. In addition, another special H/ACA RNA in mammals is telomerase RNA, which is required for telomere
synthesis [14].
Most relevant to this study are H/ACA snoRNAs. H/ACA
molecules in most eukaryotes consist of two hairpins, a 5'
hairpin followed by a single-stranded domain called the
H-box (with the sequence ANANNA, where N stands for
any nucleotide), and a 3' hairpin followed by an ACA-box.
The snoRNA's pseudouridylation pocket consists of two
short sequences that are complementary to the residues
that flank the target uridine to be converted to pseudouridine. The uridine residue, which undergoes pseudouridylation, is located 14–16 bp upstream from the H or
ACA box. The 5' hairpin and the 3' hairpin are similar in
their structure and function. These H/ACA have the potential to guide modification of two different rRNA targets
[5,7]. Even when the RNA only contains a single guide
sequence, the two hairpin domains are essential for activity [15]. Four core proteins, namely, Gar1p, Nop10p,
Nhp2p, and Cbf5p/dyskerin, were identified to form the
eukaryotic H/ACA snoRNP (RNA-Protein complex) [1622]. The crystal structure of a functional complex of these
four highly conserved proteins in complex with a singlehairpin H/ACA snoRNA was solved in Archaea [23].
Trypanosomes are unicellular parasitic protozoa that are
the causative agent of several infamous parasitic diseases

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/471

including African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma
brucei, Chagas' disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, and
Leishmaniasis caused by leishmania species. Trypanosomatids diverged early in the evolution of eukaryotes
[24] and are well-known for harboring exotic and unique
RNA processing mechanisms such as nuclear pre-mRNA
trans-splicing [25] and mitochondrial RNA editing [26].
In addition, the large rRNA subunit is synthesized as a single RNA molecule that then undergoes specific cleavages
that yield two large rRNA molecules and four small RNAs,
ranging in size from 76 to 220 nt [27].
In trypanosomes, only single-hairpin H/ACA molecules
which lack the H-box and have an AGA-box instead of
ACA-box were described [28]. Following our previous
notation, throughout this paper we refer to these molecules, i.e. single hairpin molecules with AGA-box and a
regular H/ACA function as determined by their destabilization in CBF5 knockdown cells (see below) as H/ACAlike. The novel class of molecules that share the same
structural features but are not destabilized in CBF5 knockdown cells are referred to as AGA-like (see below).
Since the discovery of single-hairpin H/ACA-like molecules in trypansomes, similar single hairpin RNAs have
been discovered in Archea [20,29], and Euglena [30]. Single-hairpin H/ACA-like molecules in trypanosomes operate in a similar fashion as their double-hairpin
counterparts.
The organization of trypanosome snoRNAs most closely
resembles that of plants [31], as their coding genes are
clustered, and each cluster carries a mixture of both C/D
and H/ACA-like RNAs [32,33]. The trypanosome snoRNAs are processed from long polycistronic transcripts
[34,35], but the machinery that executes this processing is
currently unknown. The clusters are usually repeated several times in the genome [28,35-37], and could appear at
a second location within the same chromosome [32].
Prior to the current study, 60 C/D snoRNA and 34 H/ACAlike snoRNA molecules, which have the potential to direct
87 methylations and 32 pseudouridylations, respectively,
were identified in Trypanosoma brucei [33,38] and 62 C/D
and 37 H/ACA-like snoRNAs that can potentially guide 79
methylations and 30 pseudouridylations, respectively,
were identified in Leishmania major [32].
Early studies suggested the existence of at least 100 2'-Omethylated nucleotides on the rRNA of the trypanosomatid, Crithidia fasciculata [39], and recent results in Euglena,
which is closely related to trypanosomes, suggest the presence of at least 200 Nms on its rRNA[40]. The latest mapping data of methylation sites in T. brucei suggest that
there are at least 131 Nms [38]; therefore the C/D snoRNAs identified so far in T. brucei and L. major (which can

guide two modification each) are sufficient to guide about
70% of the expected modifications.
While the complete set of 24 H/ACA-like snoRNAs that
guide 44 pseudouridylations in yeast was identified [41],
the number of pseudouridines in the rRNA of trypanosomatids is still unknown. Based on the fact that the
number of C/D molecules in the known clusters is double
that of the number of H/ACA-like molecules, and clusters
consisting only of H/ACA-like molecules were not identified to date, it is expected that about 70–80 pseudouridine
sites should exist on the rRNA of these parasites. Thus, we
estimate that only about 40% of the expected repertoire of
pseudouridylation sites has been identified to date.
Laboratory techniques for the genome wide identification
of RNA molecules are expensive, time-consuming, and
labor-intensive. In addition, such experimental methods
have a bias toward highly abundant molecules. Thus, the
study of ncRNA molecules has advanced thanks to a combination of in silico and experimental methods, usually
through an approach in which predictions made by computational algorithms such as those described in [2,4248] are then validated by experimental work.
For C/D guide snoRNAs, the presence of relatively well
conserved box motifs and 10–21 nt complementary
between the guide RNA and its target has enabled the
development of successful computational screens, such as
the SnoScan program [44]. In contrast to C/D guide snoRNAs, the H/ACA guide snoRNAs have only two primary
sequence motifs, the "H-box" and the "ACA-box", the H/
ACA hairpin secondary structures exhibit considerable
variation, and the target-guide duplexes are of varying
lengths and may be imperfectly paired, making the design
of an effective computational screen for H/ACA snoRNAs
and their associated pseudouridylation sites significantly
more difficult. Still, several computational predictors were
shown to yield significant results in identifying candidate
H/ACA snoRNA sequences in eukaryotic organisms in
which H/ACA molecules fit the consensus H/ACA features, including a two hairpin structure [45,49-53].
Some of these studies need to be mentioned as they are
relevant to our work: SnoGPS [51] was designed to search
for the classic double hairpin H/ACA molecules in eukaryotic genomic sequences, but can be configured to run in
single-stem mode as well. We will show in the Discussion
session that SnoGPS can not be used, as a stand alone program, to search for H/ACA-like molecules in trypanosomes.
Muller et al. [54,55] have devised a specific algorithm to
search for H/ACA in Archaea which are single stem. In
Pyrococcus genomes this algorithm was shown to be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/471

effective in detecting the small repertoire of H/ACA molecules in these organisms. However the method is based on
constraints which are specific to Archaeal H/ACA (like the
presence of K-Turns and K-Loops and the existence of
many G:C pairs in stems), and are not present in trypanosomes.
In a very recent paper Hertel et al. [53] used a machine
learning approach (SVM – Support Vector Machine) to
detect snoRNA molecules whose ribosomal target is
unknown. While the approach was very successful in
identifying known H/ACA in several organisms (Human,
Nematodes and Drosophila) it failed to detect any of the
known H/ACA-like molecules in the trypanosomatid
genome of L. major.
Thus, it is clear that computational detection of H/ACA
molecules is more difficult for the single-hairpin molecules than for the standard double-hairpin form. The double-hairpin structure with its characteristic spacer length
between the stems is a dominant feature that may be
exploited by the computational algorithms. Since
trypanosome H/ACA-like RNAs are composed of a singlehairpin and lack most of the features that have Archaeal
H/ACA, we can not use neither the existing algorithms to
search for H/ACA molecules from other eukaryotes nor
programs that exploit the specific features of Archeal H/
ACA. Therefore, we undertook the challenge of devising a
novel algorithm to identify H/ACA molecules in these
species.
The Psiscan algorithm described here is based on a pipeline that combines several computational approaches: Initial filtering based on trypanosome specific constraints
followed by comparative analysis of trypanosome species
followed by folding energy requirements and concluded
in a SVM analysis.
Thus, it presents a systematic yet specific approach to
detect novel single-hairpin H/ACA and AGA like molecules in trypanosome species. The algorithm was able to
significantly increase the repertoire of these molecules in
T. brucei.
All together the experimental validation revealed five
novel H/ACA-like as well as six novel non-coding RNA
species that possess many H/ACA-like features; the latter
group were not classified as H/ACA-like because their
level did not change in T. brucei cells silenced for the pseudouridine synthase, CBF5 [56]. In addition, bioinformatic
analysis of the genomic loci of the five novel H/ACA-like
ncRNAs led to the identification of seven additional novel
H/ACA-like and six novel C/D snoRNA molecules. We
also identified two orthologous clusters in L. major adding
2 H/ACA and 2 C/D molecules to the L. Major repertoire.

Thus, our study suggests that trypanosomes carry numerous ncRNA molecules of yet unknown function. We suggest that the novel molecules discovered in this study that
share structural features with H/ACA-like molecules but
are not affected by silencing, might be similar to "chimeric" molecules like scaRNA [10] and telomerase RNA
[14] which are known to have H/ACA domains. These
molecules have been found in vertebrates but not yet in
trypanosomes. Experiments are underway to characterize
these novel molecules.

Methods
Extraction of T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major genomes
The Trypanosoma brucei genome release 4 [57], Leishmania
major genome release 5 [58] and Trypanosoma cruzi
genome release 4 [59] were downloaded from GeneDB
http://www.genedb.org and used for analysis and prediction of H/ACA-like snoRNA.
Collection of H/ACA-like snoRNA repertoire
The repertoire of 34 H/ACA-like snoRNA sequences and
their rRNA target sequences was taken from Liang et al.
(2005) in T. brucei. Similar data for 37 H/ACA-like
sequences in L. major were taken from Liang et al. (2007).
Finally, 29 H/ACA-like snoRNAs (unpublished data) were
found in the T. cruzi genome by homology search using
Blast [60].
Secondary structure prediction by MFOLD
Secondary structure prediction and minimum free energy
(ΔG) calculation of the predicted structure were performed by the MFOLD program (version 2.3) [61].
Bioinformatic analysis using Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning
technique that is used for classification and regression.
Recently, it was shown to be useful in bioinformatic studies [62]. We applied the Support Vector Machine algorithm [63] using the SVMlight implementation in
classification mode [64]. The SVM was used with a linear
basis function to rank the candidate H/ACA-like snoRNAs
that were predicted in the first stages of the analysis. For
each candidate sequence the decision function gives a
score which can range between -8 and 8 according to the
similarity of a candidate to the negative or positive training group. The higher the score is (from 0 to +8), the more
similar the features of the test sequence to the features of
the real H/ACA snoRNAs. Consequently, sequences that
have a low score (from 0 to -8) are more similar to the
false H/ACA candidates. More details on the specific way
in which the SVM method was used are given in the
Results.

Ten fold cross validation and evaluation of the prediction
accuracy
The validation process was run one hundred times; each
time the positive and negative training data were randomly grouped into ten subsets of approximately equal
size. Then, nine subsets of the positive group and nine
subsets of the negative group were used as training data
and the remaining two subsets constitute the test set. For
each run, the SVM was trained on the randomly selected
training set and then performed the classification process
on the test set. As usual we define positive samples in the
test set classified as positive as True Positives, and their
number is denoted as TP. Negative samples classified to
be negative are called True Negative and their number is
counted by TN. Negative samples that were wrongly classified as positives are False Positives and counted by FP.
Positive samples that were wrongly classified as negatives
are considered False Negatives and are counted by FN. To
combine these four categories into one measure we used
the standard notation of accuracy which is defined by
TP
accuracy = TP + TN+ TN + FN . We report the average accuracy
+ FP
for the hundred validation processes.

Enrichment factor (EF)
While the goal of this work is to detect new unknown H/
ACA-like molecules in trypanosomes, we can use the set of
known H/ACA-like molecules in trypanosome as a benchmark to trace the performance of our computational pipeline. I.e. in each stage of the pipeline we can check how
many of the known H/ACA-like molecules are still
included in the candidate list produced by the algorithms.
Towards this end we defined the Enrichment Factor (EF)
as the ratio between the baseline frequency of known H/
ACA molecules in the genome to their frequency in the
various candidate sets. There are 34 known H/ACA-like
molecules in the T. brucei genome. As AGA is a mandatory
box for these molecules we calculated how many distinct
sequences of length 70 (which is the average length of
these molecules) appear in the genome that end with
AGA. As such sequences can overlap, we defined a
sequence to be distinct if its overlap with another
sequence is not more than 20 nts. Using a simple greedy
counting we found that the T. brucei genome contain
450,965 such molecules. Hence the baseline frequency of
H/ACA-like molecules in T. Brucei is 34/207339 =
0.000075.
Construction of h2 mutations using PCR mutagenesis
Tagging of h2 H/ACA was performed by PCR mutagenesis
using primers carrying the mutatant tag sequence. The
primers used to introduce the mutations and the primers

used for the amplification of the mutant fragments for
cloning into the pX expression vector are specified in the
Additional File 1. The mutations were confirmed by DNA
sequencing. The mutations were cloned into the pX-neo
episomal vector, which carries a neomycin resistance gene
(neo). Stable cell lines carrying the different constructs
were selected on 25 μg/ml neomycin and lines expressing
high levels of the tagged molecule were selected on 500
μg/ml neomycin. The stable cell lines carrying the different constructs were established as previously described
[65].
Primer extension analysis
Primer extension was performed using end-labeled oligonucleotides (105 cpm/pmol) [see Additional file 2]. After
annealing at 60°C for 15 min, the sample was kept on ice
for 1 min. 1 unit of reverse transcriptase (Expand, RT,
Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 unit of RNase
inhibitor (Promega) were added, and extension was performed at 42°C for 90 min. The reaction was analyzed on
a 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel next to end labeled
pBR322 HpaII digest.

Results
Manual analysis of 100 known H/ACA-like and
construction of a heuristic model
As an initial step in designing our computational identification protocol, we compiled all the 100 known H/ACAlike snoRNAs from T. brucei, L. major and T. cruzi. These
sequences were folded by MFOLD with constraints that fit
the general description of single stem-hairpin structure
composed of two stems and two loops (the pseudouridylation pocket and the upper loop). We enforced features to forbid base-pairing with the AGA box and with
the sequences that constitute the pseudouridylation
pocket. In addition, we required that two nucleotides
from stem II immediately following the pseudouridylation pocket be base paired (See Fig 1).

In all trypanosomatid H/ACA-like snoRNAs known so far,
the terminal box sequence is AGA, not ACA, and is located
3 nt upstream from the 3' end. In addition, all of the H/
ACA-like RNAs can form only a single stem-loop structure
with sizes ranging from 57 to 91 nt [32,33]. The 5' ends of
H/ACA-like snoRNAs are usually situated 1 to 3 nt
upstream from the stem and in most cases, an A exists 1 nt
upstream of stem I (91% in T. brucei, 86% in T. cruzi and
66% in L. major). C can also appear in this position (about
30% of the time in L. major, 14% in T. cruzi and only 6%
in T. brucei), while U is rarely found and G was not
observed in this position. Stem I has usually perfect basepairing and ranges from 5 to 8 nt in length. Usually, one
to three unpaired nucleotides exist between stem I and the
AGA box. The pseudouridylation pocket varies in size: the
upstream side to the pseudouridine varies in size from 5

Figure 1

The consensus structure of trypanosomatid H/ACA-like
The consensus structure of trypanosomatid H/ACAlike snoRNA. The single hairpin structure consists of stem

and an apical loop. The target rRNA is bound within the

rRNA is marked by Ψ.
to 11 nt, whereas the downstream side of the pocket
depends on the size of the stem I and space between the
stem I to AGA motif. Altogether, the size of downstream
side to the modified uridine with stem I and unpaired
nucleotides before the AGA box range in size from 13–16
nt, because the pseudouridine is always located 13–16 nt
upstream from the AGA-box of the snoRNA as in all
canonical H/ACA [4]. The target-guide duplexes of pseudouridylation pocket with rRNA target are of varying sizes
from 3 to 9 nt on each side. Stem II also varies in size, but
a perfect stem of 3 to 7 nt must exist immediately adjacent
to the pseudouridylation pocket. The conserved sizes of
the stems is supported by the presence of compensatory
changes [32] between orthologs from T. brucei, T. cruzi
and L. major. The apical loop is less conserved among the
orthologs, but has a minimum size of 5 nt. The predicted
secondary structures suggest stable structures with minimal free energy (ΔG) of not higher than -5 Kcal/mol.
Based on these features, a consensus structure for trypanosomatid H/ACA-like snoRNA was chosen (See Fig 1).
Determining structural elements essential for stable
expression of H/ACA-like RNA
To identify the structural features that are essential for stable expression of H/ACA-like molecules, we used the Leptomonas collosoma system. We have previously identified
several H/ACA-like RNA species in the snoRNA-2 locus in
L. collosoma [66]. Expression of a tagged C/D RNA
snoRNA-2 from this locus was established by cloning the
gene with its flanking sequences into the pX expression

vector [35]. For these experiments, we used a plasmid carrying the tag in the C/D snoRNA (sno2) that is carried on
the same plasmid as h2. The expression of tagged sno-2
controls for expression, from the plasmid (copy number)
and serves as a positive control for the expression of h2
mutants (See Fig 2-A). Mutations were introduced into the
h2 RNA by PCR mutagenesis as described in Materials and
Methods. After verifying the mutations, transgenic parasites expressing these mutations were selected by growth
on elevated G418 concentration. We previously demonstrated that both the chromosomal snoRNA-2 as well as
the tagged molecule are efficiently expressed in cell lines
expressing the snoRNA [35]. The first set of mutations was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/471

introduced to tag the h2 molecule by inserting a tag of several nucleotides in either the apical loop or the upper part
of stem 2. In addition, we inserted symmetrical complementary sequences in each side of the second stem,
thereby lengthening the molecule. A schematic representation of the positions of these alterations is given in Fig.
2-C, and the expression of these tagged RNAs is shown in
Fig 2-B. The expression was examined by primer extension
using anti-sense oilgonucleotides complementary to the
3' end of the molecule that extends both the wild-type and
the tagged RNA. The results suggest that h2 molecules can
not tolerate insertion of nucleotides in either the apical
loop or the second stem. Expression was only detected if

extension analysis. RNA was extracted from transgenic lines carrying the different mutations shown in panel C. The RNA was
extended with h2 and snoRN-2 specific oligonulceotides listed in the Additional File 1. The different cell lines carried a single
mutation (T1 to T3) or the double mutations (T3 + one the M mutations are indicated). The position of the extension products for snoRNA-2 or h2 are indicated. (C).

mutations in M7 to M9 is highlighted with a circle and the exact nts that were changed are individually circled.

a symmetrical complementary sequence was inserted in
stem II. This tagged molecule was further used to introduce additional mutations and examine the importance
of additional structural features of h2.
We next mutated the AGA sequence to either ACA or AAA
(the mutations are depicted in Fig 2-C) and the expression
by primer extension is presented in Fig 2-B. The results
suggest that this AGA sequence can not tolerate changes,
as such changes dramatically decrease expression. Note
that the level of tagged snoRNA-2 serves as a positive control to demonstrate the high level of expression form the
episomal pX plasmid. To further explore other structural
features that may be important for the stable expression of
these RNA species, three additional changes were introduced to the tagged h2 RNA molecule, as depicted in Fig
2-C. M7 stem I was shortened to two nucleotides by a
symmetrical deletion, M8 stem I was extended to 9 nts,
and finally the pesudouridylation pocket in M9 was
destroyed by enlarging the loop by 6 nts. The results in
Fig. 2-B suggest that none of these changes can be tolerated and that the tagged mutated RNAs were not stably
expressed. These results suggest that: (1) The size of the
apical loop is important for RNA stabilization; (2) Stem II
can tolerate only symmetrical changes in its length; (3)
Stem I must be longer than 2 nucleotides and not larger
than eight nucleotides; (4) The pseudouridylation pocket
can not tolerate extensions, even if these preserve the loop
structure. These conclusions assisted us in choosing the
constraints to be used by the algorithm to search for additional molecules in the genome.
Psiscan: Genome wide search pipeline
Using the consensus description presented in Fig 1 and
described above, we developed a search pipeline consisting of: (1) A genome wide search for sequences that carry
H/ACA-like characteristics. (2) Homology prediction
approach. (3) Folding into an appropriate secondary
structure. The sequences that passed these three filters
were further refined by (4) a machine learning approach
and followed by (5) manual exploration of clusters. These
five stages are presented schematically in Fig 3 and are
detailed below:
Genome wide search for sequences that fit the description
The first filter in the pipeline was a genome wide search,
which scans the entire genome and detects sequences that
fit the consensus model presented in Fig 1. The program
receives as input the genome sequence, rRNA sequence
and the parameters of the model, e.g. the range of H/ACAlike sizes, the size of stem I, the extent of base pairing with
rRNA. The filter moves through the input genome and
identifies each AGA sequence. Next, it tries to match stem
I 5–8 nt upstream from the AGA with another 5–8 nt
sequence at a distance of 49–83 nt upstream that can complement the first sequence. This was done by trying all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/471

possible ways to create a perfect stem I in length of 8–5 bp
in distance of 83–49 nt upstream to the AGA. Each possible structure for stem I was passed to the next stage as a
separate candidate to form H/ACA-like molecule. Note
that G-U base pairing, which is common in RNA structures, is allowed.
For each sequence which has an AGA motif and a perfect
stem I, the program tries to find the target rRNA by base
pairing of the 3–9 nts that flank stem I on each side to the
6–18 nt on the rRNA again by trying all possible combinations. After matching the target to the sequence we
check that the pseudouridylation pocket is of the right
size, i.e. the length of the pseudouridylation pocket
upstream to the Ψ varies in size from 5–11 nts and the
length of the pseudouridylation pocket downstream to
the Ψ is counted together with the size of stem I and
number of unpaired nucleotides before the AGA box to be
between 13–16 nt (see Figure 1). Then, the program tries
to base pair perfectly at least 3–7 bp immediately after the
pseudouridylation pocket and to extend this stem to the
maximum of 18 nt in each side by non-perfect base pairing. Finally, it checks that there are no less than 5 nts
remaining, which constitute the apical loop.
1,458,629 candidates from T. brucei, 3,349,031 candidates from T. cruzi and 1,847,073 candidates from L.
major fit this crude model. Because of the way the genome
search works, it is clear that the same sequence (or a
sequence with a minor shift) may fit the model in many
different ways. In order to check the real number of the
different candidates, we checked the number of sequences
by their genome location. Two sequences are considered
different if they overlap by at most 20 nts. Using this
measure we got 199,073 unique sequences from T. brucei,
442,531 from T. cruzi and 254,106 from L. major. 32
known H/ACA-like molecules from T. brucei were found
in this set. Thus, their frequency is 0.00016 (32/199073),
i.e. an Enrichment Factor of 2.1 compared to the baseline.
Comparative approach
In order to filter the very large number of candidates, we
required that each molecule have a homologue in at least
one other trypanosome genome (out of the three
genomes that we analyzed). Previous studies showed that
the level of conservation in the upper stem and apical
loop is not high [32], so in fact only about the first 20 nt
of each molecule were considered relevant to detect similarity between the two RNAs. Two sequences were considered to be similar if they matched in at least 10 nt out of
the 16 nt starting from the stem I of the 5' end of both
sequences

In order to direct the algorithm to identify short conserved
sequences which are not a part of a longer sequence, such
as ribosomal RNA or proteins, we required that the

sequences on the 10 nts flanking each side of the molecules (upstream to stem I of the 5' end and downstream
immediately after AGA box) to be not conserved, thus a
maximum of 4 matched nucleotides out of the stretch of
10 nts on each side was allowed.
663,561 candidates (merged to 153,073 unique
sequences, see above) from T. brucei, 1,608,047 candidates (341,600 sequences) from T. cruzi and 922,894 candidates (203,402 sequences) from L. major were passed to
the third filter in the pipeline.
31 known H/ACA-like molecules from T. brucei were
found in this set. Thus, their frequency is 31/153073 =
0.0002 suggesting an Enrichment factor of 2.65 compared
to the baseline.
Secondary structure folding
We assume that true H/ACA-like molecules will have stable secondary structure and thus should have low free
energy score predicted by RNA folding programs like
MFOLD [61]. However, calculating ab initio the secondary
structure of these molecules is both not reliable (prediction of the secondary structure of such short molecules is
known to be problematic [67]) and highly time consuming. We therefore used the option of the MFOLD program
that forces the predicted structure to follow user-defined
constraints. Our constraints prevent base pairing between
the AGA box and sequences which recognize the rRNA in
the pseudouridylation pocket. We also forced two nucleotides from stem II immediately after the pseudouridylation pocket to be base paired [see Additional File 3].

The predicted secondary structure for certain sequences
was considered satisfactory if it obeyed the consensus H/
ACA-like secondary structure as described in Figure 1 and
was energetically stable, defined as ΔG lower than -5 Kcal/
mol. MFOLD computes all possible secondary structures
for a certain sequence and returns as output the best fifty
variant structures. Only when both sequences in each
comparative pair had at least one satisfactory secondary
structure, they were passed to the next stage of the pipeline. Note that as each sequence can be folded in more
than one legitimate structure according to the requirements, there are more candidate structures than
sequences.
At this stage, we were left with 3452 candidates (2189
sequences) from T. brucei, 10,369 candidates (6329
sequences) from T. cruzi and 6263 candidates (4137
sequences) from L. major. 15 known H/ACA-like snoRNAs
from T. brucei were found. The Enrichment factor of this
stage is 57.6 compared to the baseline.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/471

Since sequences that are annotated as protein coding are
less likely to harbor ncRNA molecules, we eliminated all
sequences that came from such regions of their respective
genome. We preferred to include the entire genome in the
original search since we have previously detected C/D
snoRNA in genomic loci annotated as hypothetical conserved proteins. Thus, in future studies, we may continue
searching the entire list of candidates for additional H/
ACA-like molecules that were omitted here. However, in
the current study, we filtered out coding regions including
hypothetical proteins at this stage and were left with 650
sequences from T. brucei, 1070 from T. cruzi and 1008
from L. major.
Intermediate results filtering and analysis
Since the validation of so many candidates in the laboratory is a labor intensive and costly process, we ranked the
results from the T. brucei genome according to their level
of conservation to both L. major and T. cruzi. The 25 most
conserved sequences were tested for expression by primer
extension analysis [see Additional File 4 for the list of the
sequences]. Four sequences out of these 25 were shown to
be expressed (Fig 4). However, two of the RNAs (7 and 25
on Fig 4) were larger than the expected size. In order to
confirm that the four expressed RNAs are H/ACA-like, the
level of the RNA was examined in CBF5 RNAi silenced
cells before and after 3 days of silencing. We previously
demonstrated that H/ACA-like RNA are destabilized in
these silenced cells [56]. Three sequences (16, 206 and 25
on Fig 4) were sensitive to silencing, suggesting their role
as H/ACA-like snoRNA; the function of the fourth one
(number 7 on Fig 4) is currently unknown.
Machine learning approach
In order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the
search and to rank the candidates according to the probability that they are indeed bona fide ncRNA molecules, we
used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) [63].

The SVM receives, as input, vectors of features of the training data, selects a set of significant features to be used in
the classification process, creates a model which consists
of a combination of the significant features and then classifies the feature vectors of the test data according to the
derived model. The training set for this program must
include two different groups of the data – positive and
negative. SVM creates a maximal separating hyperplane
between the positive and negative input vectors. After the
model has been created, SVM classifies the test data to be
on the negative or the positive side of that hyperplane.
In a recent paper, Hertel et al [53] used SVM to detect
snoRNA without using information on the target ribosomal sequence with whom the snoRNA is supposed to
interact. Our SVM is quite similar to the approach

Page 9 of 20

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:471

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/471

SnoReport used a set of random sequences as negative
examples, whereas in our SVM the negative training set
contains of sequences that have all H/ACA structural features, but were checked experimentally not to be H/ACAlike molecules. The use of negative training set that is very
similar to the positive training set increase the resolving
power of the SVM method.
Also, the parsing of predicted secondary structure for each
candidate in our report is more detailed than was used in
snoReport. We parsed the hairpin of the H/ACA secondary
structure to the eight features whereas in snoReport each
hairpin of H/ACA molecule was parsed to the three features.
However, the SVM described in Hertel et al. is not specific
to H/ACA like molecules in trypanosomes and is a stand
alone program that is not part of a pipeline. Thus, it is not
surprising that the authors noted that SnoReport was not
able to detect any of the known H/ACA molecules in L.
major.

described in Hertel et al. but few differences should be
noted.

The features used by the SVM
The positive group of the training set was the set of the 34
known H/ACA-like molecules from T. brucei and the three
molecules from the previous stage that were proved to be
H/ACA snoRNAs (total of 37 molecules), and the negative
group was a set of the 21 molecules that were suggested as
H/ACA-like candidates by the previous stages of the screen
but turned out experimentally not to be H/ACA RNAs (the
25 selected minus the four that were shown to be
expressed). These molecules passed all the three stages of
the pipeline but experimentally were still shown to not be
expressed. Note that the use of such "false positive"
sequences is important, as such a training set enables the
machine learning algorithms to refine their model and
correctly identify true sequences from the background of
many false sequences. The test input group for SVM consisted of the 625 final candidates from T. brucei derived
from the previous steps (excluding the sequences that
were already analyzed by primer extension assay).

Each sequence used by SVM was transformed into a vector
of the following 9 numerical features: The minimal free
energy of the structure, the length of stem I, the existence
of bulge in stem I (a binary feature), the size of loop I 5'
to the pseudouridylation site and the size of loop I 3' to
the pseudouridylation site, the number of bases complimentary to the ribosome (both the 5' and 3' to the pseudouridylation site), the size of stem II, and the size of the
apical loop.

groups possess basic H/ACA-like characteristics and there-

fore cannot be separated neither by the filters used in the
deterministic screen nor by manual inspection.
As described above, the 37 sequences of the H/ACA-like
snoRNAs were used as a positive training set and the 21
sequences of the false candidates were used as a negative
training set in a ten-cross validation test. Note that as real
H/ACA-like and negative sequences may have several predicted secondary structures and every predicted secondary
structure is converted to a separate input vector for the
SVM, the complete training set for the SVM consisted of
44 positive vectors, representing 37 different H/ACA-like
sequences, and 79 negative vectors, which represented 21
different sequences.
In the ten-fold cross validation the positive and negative
training data were randomly grouped into ten subsets of
approximately equal size (each positive set contained 4 or
5 positive vectors and each negative set contained 7 or 8
negative vectors). Then, nine subsets of the positive group
and nine subsets of the negative group were used as training data and the remaining two subsets constitute the test
set.
This validation process was run one hundred times, each
time the data were newly grouped into random ten subsets. The average accuracy of one hundred processes was
calculated according to the formula (see Methods). The
machine learning approach succeeded in distinguishing
the members of the positive group from the members of
the negative group with accuracy of 77.4%.
SVM classification of the test data set
After calibration of the SVM on the training set with cross
validation, we re-trained the SVM on the full training set
that includes the 37 known H/ACA-like sequences which
produce 44 positive vectors for the positive training set
and the 21 sequences of the false candidates which produce 79 negative vectors for the negative training set.

The trained SVM was then used to classify the 625 test
sequences. The 625 candidate sequences were converted
to 1029 vectors which were classified as either positive or
negative. In our case the SVM classifier ranked every vector
of the test data with score ranging from -6 to +6 (see Fig 5)
reflecting its distance from the separation plane between
the false and true candidates (for more details see Methods).
The positive test group (vectors that received score from 0
to 6) that consists of the vectors which are the most similar to the known H/ACA-like molecules comprised 304
vectors (179 sequences). In this group 13 out of the 179
sequences are known H/ACA-like molecules yielding an
enrichment factor of 963.3.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/471

Practically, 173 sequences are still too many for experimental validation. Thus, we chose a cutoff score of +3 and
were left with 43 vectors representing 28 different candidate sequences classified as positive with the greatest confidence. 9 of these molecules were known H/ACA
molecules reaching our final EF of 4263.3.
Primer extension validation of the final results
As 9 out of the 28 chosen candidates are known H/ACAlike molecules, the remaining 19 candidates [see Additional File 5 for the list of the sequences] were examined
for expression by primer extension, followed by analysis
in CBF5 knockdown cells. Using primer extension analysis, 7 out of 19 candidates were found to be expressed as
stable ncRNA molecules (see Fig 6). Unexpectedly, in several cases the lengths of the molecules were different from
the ones predicted. For example, for candidates 473, 400,
230 and 299, the lengths of the primer extension products
were about 150 nt. Candidate 473 had two extension
products of about 150 nt and 50 nt in length; the latter is
most probably a degradation product. Candidates 937,
122 and 109 are of the expected length.

In order to confirm the function of the 7 expressed RNAs,
primer extension analysis was performed using RNA
extracted from CBF5 silenced cells (+Tet) in comparison
to uninduced cells (-Tet). Two of the seven molecules
were shown to be H/ACA-like snoRNA, and the function
of the remaining five molecules (as well as the function of
one molecule from the intermediate validation step
described above) remains unknown, as they were insensitive to CBF5 silencing.
In attempt to explore the potential function of these six
ncRNA, we performed homology search of these
sequences against the RFAM database [68] using BLAST
[60], but no potential homologs were found; therefore
additional laboratory experiments must be performed in
order to reveal the function of these six ncRNAs.
Manual exploration of clusters
Because of the fact that most, if not all, snoRNAs in
trypanosomatids are arranged in clusters, we performed
bioinformatic analysis of the genomic regions surrounding five of the verified H/ACA-like snoRNAs [three from
the first stage of PsiScan (before the SVM) and two from
the last stage]. We found indications for potential clusters
in all cases (see Fig 7-A). Note that during the manual
exploration of clusters in genomic loci of a new validated
H/ACA-like molecules we allowed more relaxed parameters than those described in the consensus structure (see
Fig. 1) because of two reasons: First, the regions of searching for a new molecules was short (about 1000 nt each)
and there were fewer false results to deal with. Second, the
consensus structure was developed based on the known

H/ACA-like molecules identified to date and we wanted to
try to find new functional H/ACA-like snoRNAs that may
not fully adhere to the current consensus structure. Therefore, we increased the range of sizes for the stem I and the
pseudouridylation pocket, and enabled the existence of
one bulge in the stem I.
The first cluster is located on chromosome 3 and consists
of two H/ACA-like ncRNAs, including one that is unusually long (about 150 nt). This cluster is the first one
observed to include only H/ACA-like molecules. The second cluster is located on chromosome 8 and consists of
two H/ACA-like ncRNAs and one C/D. The third is located
on chromosome 9 and consists of two H/ACA-like snoRNAs. As in first case, this cluster includes only H/ACA-like
molecules, and the first H/ACA-like molecule is about 150
nt in length. The fourth cluster is located on chromosome

10 and consists of three H/ACA-like RNAs and one C/D.
The fifth is located on chromosome 11 and consists of
three H/ACA-like RNAs and two C/Ds. Note that this cluster contains partial tandem repeat thus TB11C5H1
TB11C5H2 appear twice. The potential targets on the
rRNA for each new H/ACA-like and C/D molecules were
predicted (see Fig 8). Note that the genomic organization
of these clusters is different from the clusters we described
before [33], because the previously described clusters contain more C/D than H/ACA-like molecules.
Indeed, several molecules that were found by manual
exploration are different from the consensus structure
described in Figure 1. For example, in the molecule
TB3C2H2, an upstream side of pseudouridylation pocket
is 15 nt long, whereas the maximum size in consensus
structure is 11 nt.

study in T. brucei. (B) Two clusters detected in L. major. The names of each molecule in the cluster are given according to
snoRNA nomenclature in T. brucei and L. major (TB or LM; chromosome number; C, cluster number; C, C/D number or H, H/
ACA-like number). The C/D snoRNAs are shown as lightly-shaded boxes, whereas the H/ACA-like RNAs are in dark boxes.
Thinner lines indicate an intergenic region, with size indicated below the line. The lengths of snoRNA genes (± 3 bp) are indicated below the box. The small numbers below the name of each cluster indicates the position of the cluster in the genome
database of T. brucei GD release 4 [57], and L. major genome release 5 [58].

Another example is TB8C4H1, which stem I is of size 7 bp,
but contains bulge that is not allowed by the consensus
structure.
In addition, we found that two out of five verified H/ACAlike molecules have orthologs in L. major. The first one
(LM30C2H1) is novel H/ACA-like molecule, which is
located near two previously described C/D molecules (see
Fig 7-B). The second ortholog is LM36C4H1, which has
two inexact repeats in the L. major genome (see Fig 7-B);
however the pseudouridylation pocket in both cases is
perfectly conserved (see Fig 8).
Two novel C/D snoRNAs were found in the genomic locus
of LM36C4H1. The first C/D is LM36C4C1, with two
inexact repeats in the L. major genome; this RNA species
guides a methylation on the same site as TB10C5C1 (see
Fig 8). The second C/D snoRNA (LM36C4C2) has no
ortholog in T. brucei and is encoded by a unique gene. In
conclusion, this study expands the collection of snoRNAs
in trypanosomes by 14 novel H/ACA and 6 novel C/D
molecules [see Additional File 6 for the list of the
sequences].

Discussion
The current estimate of the number of different methylation sites (Nms) in trypanosomes is 110–130 Nm, based
on partial mapping and on the 120 Nms identified in the
study of Crithidia [39]. In other eukaryotes, the number of
Nms and pseudouridines (Ψs) are similar to each other.
However, trypanosomes may have more Nms than Ψs
because the Nms stabilize the rRNA and are essential for
preserving ribosome function during cycling of the parasite from the insect to the mammalian host [38]. In addition, all the snoRNA clusters described previously carried
a mixture of both C/D and H/ACA-like RNAs [32,33] and
usually contained twice as many C/D as H/ACA-like
genes. Based on these two observations, we assumed that
the trypanosome genome may contain fewer H/ACA than
C/D molecules. Thus, since there are about 130 Nm in T.
brucei, and since most C/D molecules can each guide two
modifications, we estimate that trypanosomes may have
70–80 C/Ds and less than 70 H/ACA-like molecules.
However, in this study, we identified for the first time two
small clusters (TB3Cs2 and TB9C6) which consist of only
H/ACA-like molecules (Fig 7-A). This new finding under-

mines the assumption of the number of H/ACA-like molecules. One intriguing possibility is that there are many
more H/ACA-like RNAs "hiding" in the genome in clusters carrying only H/ACA-like molecules. Therefore, based
on our findings on H/ACA-only clusters, we propose that
the number of pseudouridylation sites may be as large as
in other eukaryotes e.g. more than 100 in humans [69].
One of the most interesting findings emerging from our
screen was the finding of several novel small RNAs that
share many structural features with H/ACA-like RNA and
are conserved in trypanosome species but are not destabilized in CBF5 knock down cells. We call these molecules
AGA-like. These molecules may be non-coding RNAs that
are not related to guide RNAs from the AGA family. Since
these molecules have, by our search criteria, complementarity to rRNA, we suggest that they constitute another

group of ncRNA that may also function in rRNA processing.
We recently reported the existence of 124 Nms in T. brucei
[38], but failed to identify the complete C/D snoRNAs
that guide these modifications. We suggested that
trypanosome may have an additional family of guide
RNAs with a similar function. The AGA-like RNA may represent such a family of RNAs that also function in rRNA
processing, but bind a different subset of RNP proteins.
We also note that several of these RNAs are larger in size
than the conventional H/ACA-like RNAs, which range in
size from 70–90 bases. Note that other classes of H/ACAlike RNAs such as scaRNA RNAs, which contain both C/D
and H/ACA RNA domains and guide modifications on
snRNAs [10] were not yet identified in trypanosomes. In

addition, telomerase RNA, which is also an H/ACA RNA
in different eukaryotes, was also not identified in any of
the trypanosomatid species. We are currently examining
whether the novel molecules that we have described in
this study might constitute the trypanosome homologs of
these currently missing ncRNAs. Finally, we can not
totally rule out the possibility that these RNAs are regular
H/ACA-like molecules but they very stable compared to
the guide RNA we examined previously, and thus their
destabilization following silencing is less evident [56].
Recently, it was suggested that contrary to previous belief,
very large fractions of eukaryotic genomes are expressed
[70-73], and there is an on-going debate about the biological significance of these transcripts. This debate has practical implications for our studies, since we wished to show
that the large fraction of the selected candidate molecules
that are expressed is due to the predictive ability of the
algorithm, rather than due to a high level of background
expression.
Thus, we decided to see if fragments chosen at random
from the T. brucei genome encode for small RNAs.
Towards this goal we performed an additional primer
extension analysis from 15 randomly chosen sequences
[see Additional File 7 for the list of the sequences]. Five
out of 15 sequences of 60–80 nt length were selected at
random from intergenic regions of the T. brucei genome.
The remaing 10 sequences were chosen randomly from
the (approximately 1 million) sequences that passed the
first stage of the pipeline of our method – the genome
wide search for sequences that fit the basic constraints of
H/ACA-like molecules. We validated that none of these 10
sequences are annotated as functional regions of any form
in the T. brucei genome. Two sequences out of the 15 were
expressed (see Fig 9).
Notwithstanding the small sample size of this analysis, we
note that short sequences chosen at random from regions
that are not known to have any function in the genome of
T. brucei still contain expressed ncRNA (2 out of 15). The
small sample size does not allow numerical extrapolation,
but is consistent with the possibility of thousands of
ncRNA expressed genome-wide [70].
It is clear that our procedure is successful in enriching the
fraction of molecules that are expressed from 2 out of 15
(13%) in the random assay to 7 out of 19 (36%) in our
final validation step, in additional to 9 known H/ACAlike molecules that have been retrieved.
SnoGPS [51] is a program that was designed to search for
the classic double hairpin H/ACA molecules in eukaryotic
genomes. However, it can be configured to run in singlestem mode as well. To compare the performance of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/471

SnoGPS to our Psiscan pipeline, we have only included
those results that terminate with an AGA box. Using its
default values SnoGPS returned 11,886,827 hits that we
merged to represent 310,413 sequences. In this ensemble
32 out of the 34 known H/ACA-like in T. Brucei were
found. Thus, the performance of SnoGPS is comparable to
the first stage of our pipeline where we ended up with
199,073 sequences that contain 32 of the known molecules. SnoGPS does not provide a mechanism to narrow
down the large number of candidates; however it is possible to use the scores that SnoGPS produces for each hit to
rank the candidates. Only three known H/ACA molecules
were found in the top 28 candidates of SnoGPS. As we
mentioned above, the 28 final candidates that Psiscan
produced contained 9 of the known molecules. Thus, our
procedure suggests a significant improvement over using
SnoGPS alone.
The nine known H/ACA-like molecules detected by Psiscan in the final stage represent about 25% of the previously known repertoire of 34 H/ACA-like molecules in T.
brucei. Such a detection level of known molecules is reasonable, as relaxing some of the constraints along the
pipeline may lead to a larger number of known molecules
recovered, but at the cost of increasing the number of false
positives in the predicted candidates.
Furthermore, as more data become available from the
experimental validation of our current set of candidates,
the SVM approach will enable us to further refine and
improve the performance of the method to detect additional, still missing, H/ACA molecules in Trypanosomes.

Conclusion
In this study we developed Psiscan, a new computational
method for identification of H/ACA-like snoRNAs in
trypanosomatids. Identification of new double hairpin H/
ACA molecules in mammalian genomes is a difficult bioinformatic challenge because of the short conserved
motifs and rRNA recognition sequences. The identification of single hairpin H/ACA-like snoRNAs is even harder.
As trypanosome H/ACA molecules are different from the
canonical box H/ACA snoRNAs of yeast, vertebrates and
Archaea it is not surprising that the computational
approaches for identification of single hairpin H/ACA that
were published to date failed to identify H/ACA-like
snoRNAs in trypanosome species.
However, while the signals for detecting H/ACA-like molecules in trypanosomes are weak, they do exist. Thus, a
careful combination of methods can be used to search for
additional such molecules. Our single hairpin H/ACA
finder in trypanosomes, Psiscan, consists of deterministic
genome wide search for sequences carries H/ACA-like
properties followed by a machine learning ranking. We

applied our method on three related genomes: T. brucei, T.
cruzi and L. major and verified the results from T. brucei by
primer extension assays. Eleven new ncRNA molecules
were discovered including five new H/ACA-like RNAs that
were not described before, and six novel RNAs with
unknown function. Bioinformatic analysis of the genomic
loci of five validated H/ACA-like snoRNAs led to the prediction of five new clusters which contain an additional
seven new H/ACA-like molecules and four new C/D snoRNAs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that two of these
clusters also exist in L. major (See Fig. 7-B). All together,
this study increased our repertoire by 14 H/ACA-like and
eight C/D snoRNAs molecules.

This study suggests that we are at just the tip of the iceberg
in unraveling the large number of ncRNA families in
trypanosomes, and the large variety within these families.
The work presented here advocates for combining computational approaches with experimental studies to advance
our knowledge of this exciting new world of ncRNAs.
