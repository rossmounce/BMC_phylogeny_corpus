Abstract
Background: Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzymes catalyze the synthesis of biogenic
amines, including the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, throughout the animal kingdom. These
neurotransmitters typically perform important functions in both the nervous system and other tissues, as
illustrated by the debilitating conditions that arise from their deficiency. Studying the regulation and
evolution of AADC genes is therefore desirable to further our understanding of how nervous systems
function and evolve.
Results: In the nematode C. elegans, the bas-1 gene is required for both serotonin and dopamine synthesis,
and maps genetically near two AADC-homologous sequences. We show by transformation rescue and
sequencing of mutant alleles that bas-1 encodes an AADC enzyme. Expression of a reporter construct in
transgenics suggests that the bas-1 gene is expressed, as expected, in identified serotonergic and
dopaminergic neurons. The bas-1 gene is one of six AADC-like sequences in the C. elegans genome,
including a duplicate that is immediately downstream of the bas-1 gene. Some of the six AADC genes are
quite similar to known serotonin- and dopamine-synthetic AADC's from other organisms whereas others
are divergent, suggesting previously unidentified functions. In comparing the AADC genes of C. elegans with
those of the congeneric C. briggsae, we find only four orthologous AADC genes in C. briggsae. Two C.
elegans AADC genes – those most similar to bas-1 – are missing from C. briggsae. Phylogenetic analysis
indicates that one or both of these bas-1-like genes were present in the common ancestor of C. elegans
and C. briggsae, and were retained in the C. elegans line, but lost in the C. briggsae line. Further analysis of
the two bas-1-like genes in C. elegans suggests that they are unlikely to encode functional enzymes, and
may be expressed pseudogenes.
Conclusions: The bas-1 gene of C. elegans encodes a serotonin- and dopamine-synthetic AADC enzyme.
Two C. elegans AADC-homologous genes that are closely related to bas-1 are missing from the congeneric
C. briggsae; one or more these genes was present in the common ancestor of C. elegans and C. briggsae.
Despite their persistence in C. elegans, evidence suggests the bas-1-like genes do not encode functional
AADC proteins. The presence of the genes in C. elegans raises questions about how many 'predicted genes'
in sequenced genomes are functional, and how duplicate genes are retained or lost during evolution. This
is another example of unexpected retention of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes.

Background
Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.28,
AADC) catalyzes the second enzymatic step in synthesis of
the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, which are
found in neurons of all animals (Figure 1). Alteration in
the normal expression of these transmitters is associated
with human neurological disorders such as Parkinson's
disease and depression [1,2]. In mammals, AADC is
expressed in many tissues beside the nervous system, associated with additional regulatory roles of dopamine and
serotonin in a wide range of tissues [3]. In insects, AADC
is further required to produce amines for cuticle synthesis
and pigmentation [4]. Because of its role in the synthesis
of both transmitters, by decarboxylation of L-dopa and 5hydroxytryptophan, AADC is also known as dopa decarboxylase
or
5-hydroxytryptophan
decarboxylase
(reviewed in [3]). AADC belongs to the α family (subgroup II) of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent
enzymes. Other subgroup II enzymes include histidine,
tyrosine, tryptophan and glutamate decarboxylases [5]; in
animals some of these enzymes mediate synthesis of other
biogenic amines (e.g., histamine, tyramine, octopamine)
and GABA. In mammals and in Drosophila, a single gene
encodes the serotonin- and dopamine-synthetic AADC
[6,7], although tissue-specific isoforms of the protein are
generated by alternative splicing [8,9]. Different genes
encode PLP-dependent decarboxylase enzymes for histamine, octopamine and GABA synthesis.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, serotonin is
expressed in at least nine neurons in the hermaphrodite
and nineteen in the male; dopamine is found in eight
neurons in the hermaphrodite and fourteen in the male
[10]. By examining the behavior of worms in which specific neurons have been ablated and examining mutants
lacking serotonin and/or dopamine, we have learned that
serotonin is involved in behaviors including egg laying
[11-13], pharyngeal pumping [14,15], male mating [16],
and experience-dependent regulation of locomotion
[17,18]. Serotonin-deficient mutants also display abnormalities in entry into the diapause-like dauer stage and in
fat storage, mediated via an insulin-related signaling pathway [19,20]. Dopamine plays roles in male mating [21],
in regulating locomotion via mechanosensation [17,22],
and in foraging behavior [23].
Identification of genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and related aspects of signaling in C. elegans was
greatly accelerated by genomic sequencing, which was
essentially completed in 1998 [23,24]. For genes
identified originally by mutants via a traditional genetic
approach, a candidate gene approach often allowed rapid
confirmation of a gene's identity; for predicted genes
identified from the genomic sequence by homology, a
reverse genetic approach has been taken. Many compo-

nents of the serotonin and dopamine synthesis and transport pathways in C. elegans have now been identified by
these traditional and reverse genetic approaches, including tyrosine hydroxylase (cat-2; [25]), tryptophan hydroxylase (tph-1; [19]), serotonin reuptake transporter (mod-5;
[26]), dopamine reuptake transporter (dat-1; [27]) and
vesicular monoamine transporter (cat-1; [28]). Postsynaptic components have also been identified, including various receptors [29-32] and intracellular G protein signaling
components [33-36].
Further analysis of gene function, regulation and evolution in C. elegans is being facilitated by genomic sequencing of related nematodes. A whole genome shotgun
sequence of Caenorhabditis briggsae was recently completed; the sequence is estimated to be 98% complete
[37]. The divergence of C. briggsae and C. elegans is estimated between 80 – 110 million years ago [37,38],
although it should be noted that these estimates lack a fossil record to anchor the dates [39]. This is considered to be
a favorable evolutionary distance to identify conserved
non-coding regulatory sequences, although the sequences
from only two orthologous genes from related species is
often inadequate to identify such sequences unambiguously. Genomic sequencing is planned or underway of
three additional congeneric relatives of C. elegans that are
more closely related than C. briggsae, which will enhance
our ability to analyze the genes of C. elegans. We have used
genomic sequences of both C. elegans and C. briggsae to
help identify and characterize another component of the
serotonin and dopamine signaling systems – the bas-1
gene – and to examine the evolution of this and related
genes.
The bas-1 [biogenic amine synthesis abnormal] mutant is
serotonin- and dopamine-deficient, and displays several
behavioral abnormalities [12,16,17]. Unlike wildtype and
other serotonin-deficient mutant worms, bas-1 mutants
are unable to convert exogenous 5-hydroxytryptophan
(5HTP) into serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT), as
assessed by serotonin antiserum staining. Because of this
phenotype, we have previously proposed that the bas-1
gene likely encoded the AADC enzyme of C. elegans [16].

Results
Rescue of the bas-1 mutant with an AADC-homologous
sequence
The bas-1 gene maps to chromosome III, between dpy-17
and unc-32. When this region was sequenced by the C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium, two AADChomologous predicted genes, designated C05D2.4 and
C05D2.3, were found to be located close together on a
single cosmid, C05D2 (Fig. 2A). This suggested that one
(or both) of these sequences comprised the gene mutated
in bas-1 mutants. To test this hypothesis, we injected bas-

Serotonin and dopamine biosynthetic pathways
Serotonin and dopamine biosynthetic pathways. Serotonin and dopamine are synthesized from the aromatic amino
acids tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively. The first and rate-limiting step in synthesis is carried out by a neurotransmitterspecific aromatic amino acid hydroxylase enzyme, either tryptophan or tyrosine hydroxylase. In C. elegans, these genes are
encoded by the tph-1 and cat-2 genes, respectively [19, 25]. The second synthetic step for both neurotransmitters shares the
aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme, which has a relatively broad substrate specificity, and is also known as
5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase or dopa decarboxylase.
1 mutants with the cosmid C05D2 plus rol-6 (dom) plasmid DNA as a co-injection marker. We isolated transgenic
Roller progeny (expressing the rol-6 (dom) marker phenotype) of the injected worm and propagated strains that
transmitted the marker, then tested these worm strains
using serotonin antibody staining. We found that 3 of 3
independent Roller transgenic lines were rescued for serotonin immunoreactivity, confirming that the bas-1 gene
was located within this 46 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 2B).
We then injected plasmid subclones of C05D2, each of
which still contained both the predicted C05D2.4 and
C05D2.3 genes. A 15.1 kb plasmid subclone (C05D2XN)
also rescued bas-1 mutants (n = 4/4), as did smaller subclones of C05D2XN, including an 11.3 kb subclone
(pCL3001, n = 11/11) and an 8.8 kb subclone (pCL7001,
n = 1/1). These results confirm that at least one of AADChomologous genes likely corresponds to the bas-1 gene.
To determine which of the two predicted AADC sequences
was needed to rescue bas-1 mutants, we prepared two constructs from C05D2XN, one mutated in C05D2.4, the
other in C05D2.3 (Fig. 2B). In each case, a mutation was
created by eliminating a unique restriction site early in the
predicted coding region, creating a frameshift resulting in
premature stop codons. We found that constructs
mutated in C05D2.3 when injected rescued serotonin
immunoreactivity in bas-1 mutants (n = 3/3), whereas the
construct mutated in C05D2.4 failed to rescue (n = 0/5

rescued). A construct containing a GFP gene inserted into
the C05D2.3 coding sequence (and disrupting the gene)
also rescued bas-1 mutants (n = 2/2). In Roller transgenic
lines lacking rescue, we confirmed the presence of the
injected construct by PCR. Therefore, an intact C05D2.4
gene is necessary to rescue bas-1 mutants, whereas the
C05D2.3 gene is not. In all rescued transgenic lines, we
saw the complete set of known serotonergic neurons,
although not necessarily all cells in every animal – mosaicism from somatic loss of extrachromosomal DNA is
expected in these transgenics. This result suggests that no
critical cell-specific regulatory sequences were missing
from even the smallest construct we injected.
To confirm further that C05D2.4 is the bas-1 gene, we
identified the mutations in four bas-1 mutant alleles; we
also examined the phenotypes of deletion mutants in
C05D2.4 and C05D2.3 generated by the C. elegans Gene
Knockout Consortium (GKC). We found that the bas-1
alleles pa4, n2948, and n3008 contained point mutations
in C05D2.4 coding sequence resulting in premature stop
codons (Fig. 2A). We found that the original bas-1 allele
(ad446) had a 4268 bp deletion from the second exon of
C05D2.4 to the final intron of C05D2.3; therefore, ad446
is a knockout of both predicted genes. We examined the
phenotypes of GKC-generated deletion mutants in each
predicted gene. The C05D2.4 knockout (tm351) removes
the entire predicted second exon. We found that both

alleles. Locations and extent of mutations for each bas-1 allele are shown to scale with respect to C05D2.4 and C05D2.3 coding sequences, based on known splicing patterns or Genefinder predictions. Exons are indicated by rectangular bars; an alternatively spliced 27 bp exon is also indicated after exon 2 in C05D2.4. Four of five bas-1 mutants affect only C05D2.4; ad446 is a
larger deletion removing most coding sequence of both C05D2.4 and C05D2.3. (B) Genomic DNA constructs that rescue or
fail to rescue bas-1 mutants. Constructs are shown to scale (top), based on the 15.1 kbp insert of the plasmid clone C05D2XN;
construct names are indicated in the box on the left. The cosmid C05D2 is larger, as indicated by the arrows. Clones below
are subclones or modifications of C05D2XN. Coding regions for the two predicted AADC genes C05D2.4 and C05D2.3 are
indicated by the blue boxes; intergenic regions are shown in yellow. C05D2XN upstream of C05D2.4 contains two other predicted genes, one complete (C05D2.8) and one partial (C05D2.5). There are no predicted genes in the 3 kb downstream of
C05D2.3. In the constructs with the least upstream sequence, only a portion of C05D2.8 remains. Constructs mutated to
introduce premature stop codons are indicated with a X in the coding sequence, and red downstream of the introduced stop
codon. The construct pCL8001 has a GFP gene inserted in a manner that would inactivate the C05D2.3 gene, so is comparable
to the pCL7991 construct. [No GFP expression was seen in the C05D2.3::GFP reporter construct lines.]

tm351 homozygotes and tm351/ad446 worms were deficient in serotonin immunoreactivity. On the other hand,
a knockout of C05D2.3 (ok703) is wildtype for serotonin

staining. Therefore, tm351 is a fifth mutant allele of the
bas-1 gene, and C05D2.4 corresponds to the gene bas-1.

Transcripts from the bas-1 gene and the predicted BAS-1
protein
To continue our characterization of the bas-1 gene, we isolated cDNAs using RT-PCR; we also obtained cDNA
clones from the C. elegans EST/Transcriptome project
(courtesy of Yuki Kohara) and the ORFeome project [40].
We found that C05D2.4/bas-1 cDNAs are trans-spliced to
SL1 just 15 nucleotides upstream of the predicted translation start site. The consensus sequence from our clones
and others we examined predicts a 514 amino acid, 58
kDa protein product (Fig. 3A). This is similar in size to
other known AADC/dopa decarboxylase proteins such as
those of Drosophila (510 aa) and human (480 aa). The predicted protein possesses a conserved lysine PLP binding
site at residue 343, and has other amino acids identical to
those shown to be essential for rat AADC function
[5,41,42]. A number of possible phosphorylation sites
can be predicted, including three serines and one tyrosine
that are conserved in all known AADCs and HisDCs (Fig.
3A).

We found two splice variants different from the Genefinder-predicted cDNA described above, which was the
predominant form. About 20% of clones we sequenced
had a 27 bp microexon inserted between the predicted
exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 3B). The 27 bp microexon is found
within what is the second intron in the more commmon
splice form. This intron is not conserved among other
AADCs, and is inserted within a region of the BAS-1 protein that is not conserved among AADC proteins. Modeling of BAS-1 protein structure, based on a recent crystal
structure of porcine DDC [43], indicates that this region is
located at the surface of the protein where it would not
interfere with the conserved enzymatic function of the
protein (data not shown). We observed that this additional exon is conserved in the C. briggsae ortholog of bas1 in genomic sequence (Fig. 3B), although we did not isolate any splice variants with this exon among C. briggsae
bas-1 cDNAs we sequenced (see also below). We found a
single clone that used an alternative splice acceptor 60 bp
upstream of the usual splice site for exon 3; this alternate
splice introduces a premature stop codon in the coding
sequence. This transcript may be a rare, aberrant splice
form without functional significance.
Expression of a bas-1::GFP reporter fusion in transgenic
worms
We examined the pattern of expression of a GFP reporter
construct with ~4500 bp upstream of the predicted bas-1
translation start site and an in-frame fusion with the 2nd
exon, injected with rol-6(dom) plasmid into wild-type
worms (kindly provided by Ian Hope). Two independent
transgenic Roller lines with extrachromosomal arrays had
the same pattern of expression. The reporter was reliably
expressed in several easily identified cells including the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/24

paired serotonergic neurons NSM and HSN and the
dopaminergic PDE postdeirid sensory neurons (Fig. 4).
NSM processes studded with varicosities were apparent in
the isthmus of the pharynx labeled with GFP (Fig. 4A,4D).
The egg-laying neuron HSN normally expresses serotonin
only in adulthood, and we found the reporter to be
expressed in adult hermaphrodites and sometimes late L4
larvae. Often the HSN processes were apparent extending
to vulval muscles and anteriorly within the ventral nerve
cord (Fig. 4C,4F). We saw a cell we identified as PDE,
which is born during L2, only after this stage. In some
worms, we saw a PDE process and dendrite, confirming
our identification (Fig. 4F).
The bas-1::GFP reporter was also expressed in other neurons in the head, around the nerve ring. We believe that
all of these cells are known serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. It was somewhat more difficult, however, to
be certain about these identifications since we saw few
processes, and even when present we could not always
unambiguously associate a process with a particular neuronal soma. Nevertheless, the reporter was expressed in
probable dorsal and ventral cephalic sensilla neurons
CEPD and CEPV; we sometimes observed as many as four
processes extending to the tip of the nose (Fig 4A,4B,4E).
We also saw expression in the anterior deirid sensory neurons ADE (Fig. 4A,4B,4E). Less frequently we saw expression in probable ADF and AIM neurons (Fig 4A,4E). We
saw as many as 12 neurons (6 bilateral pairs) expressing
the reporter in the head of young larvae. This includes all
the identified serotonergic (NSM, ADF, AIM) and
dopaminergic (CEPD, CEPV, ADE) head neurons excepting the unpaired RIH neuron [10]. In a small number of
males examined, we saw expression in male-specific serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons, including up to 6
pairs of ray sensory neurons (RNs) in both adults and late
L4 larvae (Fig. 4G,4H). (There are three pairs of serotonergic, and three pairs of dopaminergic RNs among the 18
RNs.) Expression in CP neurons, male-specific ventral
cord motoneurons controlling tail curling during mating,
was limited and usually weak in the male worms we
examined. Six CP neurons are strongly serotonin-immunoreactive in males [16]. At most we saw three posterior
cells staining, and usually only one or two posterior cells
(CP5, CP6) weakly stained, when expression was present
at all (Fig. 4I). We never saw CP staining in L4 animals,
and often none even in male worms expressing GFP
strongly in the RNs.
C05D2.4 (bas-1) and its downstream homolog C05D2.3
Just downstream of the bas-1/C05D2.4 gene is C05D2.3,
the product of an ancient tandem duplication event. The
two genes have diverged considerably – being only 59%
identical at the amino acid level (Table 1). The genomic
structures of the two genes have also diverged. The two

K357, V378, R393, and W401) are identical to those shown to be essential for rat AADC function [5, 41, 42]. Possible phosphorylation sites that are absolutely conserved in known DDC and HisDC proteins are boxed in green (Y37, S149, S229,
S230). The polyadenylation signal in the final line is underlined. Mutations found in bas-1 alleles are indicated with the allele designation and the changed base over the wildtype sequence. The allele tm351 deletion, which removes the entire second exon,
is indicated by a red line over the missing sequence. The wildtype cDNA sequence shown is consistent with our RT-PCR
clones (primers SL1B, C05D2-B), those we sequenced from the ORFeome project (from predicted translation start to stop),
and C. elegans EST project 'YK clones' ends (used to determine the 3' end, including the site of polyadenylation).

Comparisons of bas-1/C05D2.4 and other pyridoxal-phosphate dependent decarboxylase amino acid sequences were made using "BLAST 2
Sequences" [version 2.2.6, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/bl2.html [73]; Settings (largely default): Matrix – BLOSUM62, Open gap penalty
– 11, extension gap penalty – 1, low complexity filtering – OFF). As shown in the table above, on the top line, each comparison shows the blast
score; below is the percent identity and percent similarity for the 'alignable' sequence. The highest scoring match (excluding among C. elegans
AADCs) is indicated in bold. Sequences in the left column are arranged in order of blast score in comparison to C05D2.4 C. elegans AADCs are
indicated by their predicted gene designation: C05D2.4, C05D2.3, F12A10.3, K01C8.3, ZK829.2 and C09G9.4. Abbreviations: Ce – C. elegans, Cr –
Caranthus roseus (periwinkle plant), Dm – Drosophila melanogaster, Hs – Homo sapiens, DDC – dopa decarboxylase, HisDC – histidine decarboxylase,
AMD – Alpha-methyl dopa hypersensitive protein, TrpDC – tryptophan decarboxylase, GAD – glutamate decarboxylase. *An amino acid sequence
for F12A10.3 was generated from cDNA sequence by introducing 2 frameshifts to preserve AADC homology in the predicted aa sequence merely
for sake of comparison to other AADC's (see text); this sequence is different from predicted sequences in found in Genbank and Wormbase which
are based on incorrect cDNA predictions.

genes share four introns, but C05D2.4 has one and
C05D2.3 has three introns not found in the other (Fig. 7).
Nevertheless, comparisons with other AADC proteins
showed that bas-1/C05D2.4 is most similar to C05D2.3
and the predicted gene F12A10.3 (Fig. 5, Table 1). The
predicted amino acid sequence of C05D2.3 contains one
noteworthy gap: it is missing six amino acids from a
highly conserved region found in all other PLP-dependent
decarboxylases. This sequence, the consensus of which is
VDAAYA, contains an aspartate (D) residue that is absolutely essential for function of Rat DDC. Substitution of

an alanine or asparagine completely abolishes enzymatic
activity, and even the conservative substitution of a glutamate at this site reduces activity to 2% of wildtype [5]. It
is therefore unlikely that a C05D2.3 protein could function enzymatically as a typical AADC.
Because the bas-1 and C05D2.3 genes are so close together
– only 369 bp from predicted translation stop to predicted
translation start – we considered whether they might be
expressed as an operon. In C. elegans and other nematodes, genes that are very close together (and often func-

Phylogenetic trees of AADC protein and nucleotide sequences. Trees were made from sequences aligned with CLUSTALW. Species and gene names are abbreviated as listed in the legend for Table 1. (A) The single minimum-length tree resulting from a heuristic search using parsimony from alignments of core protein sequences (531 characters) of selected C. elegans,
C. briggsae, Human and Drosophila AADCs. C. roseus (periwinkle plant) TrpDC was used as an outgroup. Branch lengths are
indicated, with bootstrap values using the same search conditions (1000 replicates) in parentheses. The search used the treebisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping algorithm; characters were equally weighted. An identical tree topologically
was obtained by a branch-and-bound search. C. elegans F12A10.3 was excluded from this analysis since it lacks a functional protein sequence (see Fig. 7 and text). Trees determined by distance methods were similar, but rearranged some of branches with
low bootstrap values in the tree shown. (B) The single minimum-length tree resulting from a heuristic search using parsimony

designated by contig location, first nucleotide of predicted coding sequence, and strand, based on predicted C. elegans sequence. In each case,
alignments showed extended regions of 100% or near 100% amino acid identity beginning at the site indicated. (We did not locate the beginning of
the C.b. C09G9.4 ortholog; alignments did not identify a matching site for the first 11 C. elegans amino acids). For C05D2.3 and F12A10.3, the best
matches in C. briggsae were the C05D2.4 ortholog (FPC2187), followed by the K01C8.3 ortholog (FPC0011); these two genes appear to be absent
from C. briggsae. We have isolated an SL1-spliced C. briggsae bas-1 cDNA by RT-PCR (S. DePaul & C. Loer, unpublished); C. briggsae tdc-1 ESTs are

tionally related) may be expressed from a single promoter
initially as a single primary transcript [44]. Operon transcripts are subsequently processed to yield separate
mRNAs. The first gene in an operon is trans-spliced to the
leader sequence SL1; downstream genes are typically
spliced to a slightly different leader sequence termed SL2.
We would expect to find C05D2.3 transcripts transspliced to SL2 if it is a downstream gene in an operon with
bas-1. We were unable to isolate either SL1 or SL2-spliced
transcripts from C05D2.3 by RT-PCR, although we did
isolate a partial cDNA using internal primers. DNA microarray experiments suggest the gene is not expressed above
background levels, unlike C05D2.4/bas-1 (Table 2). Furthermore, a global analysis of expression specifically
designed to identify operons did not select C05D2.4 and
C05D2.3 as likely members of an operon [45]. Since
genes comprising an operon should be expressed at similar levels, these data provide no support for the idea that
bas-1 and C05D2.3 constitute an operon.
The bas-1-AADC and other AADC genes in C. elegans
We compared the predicted amino acid sequences of five
other C. elegans AADC-like genes revealed by deletion
mapping [46] and by whole genomic sequencing [24],
along with a previously identified C. elegans glutamate
decarboxylase (GAD) gene, unc-25 [47] to related PLPdependent decarboxylases from other organisms. Some of
the C. elegans genes are clearly closely related to other
AADCs, whereas others are more divergent (Fig 5, Table
1). All contain the core conserved domain (PFAM 00282)
defining this group of PLP-dependent decarboxylases.
None of the AADC or GAD predicted proteins in C. elegans
appears to have a signal sequence.

The protein predicted from K01C8.3 is now believed to
encode a tyrosine decarboxylase (tdc-1) used for tyramine
and octopamine synthesis, which both appear to be used
as neurotransmitters in C. elegans [48,49]. The best match
to K01C8.3/tdc-1 is a predicted Drosophila AADC-homologous protein of unknown function (G30446). Interestingly, K01C8.3/tdc-1 shows a stronger match to known
DDCs than any of the other C. elegans AADCs, including
C05D2.4 (Table 1), although it is equally similar to
known histidine decarboxylases (HisDCs). The strongest
match of C05D2.4/bas-1 (outside of nematodes) is to
insect and mammalian DDCs, but again the match is only
slightly better than to HisDCs. The predicted genes
C05D2.3, F12A10.3 and ZK829.2 also have about the
same level of identity and similarity to known AADCs and
HisDCs. The ZK829.2 predicted protein, however, is
much larger (830 AA) than a typical AADC, having
extended N- and C-terminal domains not found in other
PLP-dependent DCs. Most of ZK829.2 predicted coding
sequence is confirmed by cDNA sequences, suggesting
that the predicted protein 'extensions' likely are real.
The predicted gene C09G9.4 is the most divergent from
known AADC's with only 20 – 24% amino acid identity;
it is even more divergent than C.e. GAD/unc-25. It also
appears to lack the absolutely conserved Lys of PLPdependent decarboxylases, although it otherwise retains
considerable homology with the conserved domain of
this family of proteins. There are no similar proteins
among other organisms to provide clues about a possible
function for this gene; C09G9.4 is a truly novel member
of the group II PLP-dependent enzyme family. Proteins
with a similar level of divergence with AADC (~20% identity over a few hundred amino acids) include other group

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:24

II PLP-dependent enzymes such as sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase.
C09G9.4, however, has very little or no significant similarity to these other enzymes. The C. elegans GAD/unc-25
predicted protein has a strong match to identified Drosophila and mammalian GADs (Table 1), and is found as
a single copy. There are no other GAD-like genes in C.
elegans such as cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase, which is
the rate-limiting enzyme in taurine synthesis, and the
closest non-AADC relative to GAD in the vertebrates [50].
Comparison of C. elegans and C. briggsae AADC genes
We performed BLAST searches of a C. briggsae whole
genome shotgun assembly using predicted protein
sequences of all six C. elegans AADC genes and the unc-25/
GAD gene. We found five orthologous genes in C. briggsae
– four AADC homologs and one GAD homolog (Table 2).
All of these matches included 100% or near 100% identity
over extended regions of aligned predicted amino acid
sequences, and were paired with high confidence in phylogenies (Fig. 6). Using a core AADC sequence for alignments and tree building, we found that the bas-1
orthologs have evolved more quickly than some of the
other AADC's. The C. elegans gene K01C8.3 and its
ortholog, for example, are 98% identical in this core
region (vs. 91% identity for bas-1 orthologs). Most of the
divergence between K01C8.3 and its ortholog is in N- and
C-terminal extensions that are not found in other AADC's.
The C. elegans C09G9.4 and C. briggsae ortholog are even
less similar to one another than are the bas-1 orthologs.

Our most striking observation is that C. briggsae appears
to lack orthologs for the C. elegans predicted genes
C05D2.3 and F12A10.3. This suggests that gene duplications giving rise to these two genes, which are most closely
related to bas-1/C05D2.4, occurred either in the C. elegans
lineage after its split with the C. briggsae lineage, or that C.
briggsae lost both C05D2.3 and F12A10.3 orthologs (or
their common ancestor) following the split. Using
phylogenetic analysis of aligned amino acid and
nucleotide sequences, we found that C05D2.3 and
F12A10.3 share a common ancestor and that the gene
duplication giving rise to bas-1 and C05D2.3/F12A10.3
likely occurred prior to the C. elegans/C. briggsae divergence. This is also suggested by the pattern of introns in
the genes. [We have confirmed the splicing pattern of C.
briggsae bas-1 by isolating a cDNA (S. DePaul & C. Loer,
unpublished data).] The C. elegans and C. briggsae bas-1
genes have identical genomic structure which differs from
that of C05D2.3 and F12A10.3, which are more similar to
one another (Fig. 7). Therefore C05D2.3 and F12A10.3
(or their common ancestor) were retained in the line leading to C. elegans but lost in the C. briggsae line. The original duplication event giving rise to the tandem copies of
C05D2.4 and C05D2.3 on chromosome III probably

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/24

occurred via an unequal crossing-over or similar event.
The duplication creating F12A10.3, which is found on
chromosome II, presumably occurred subsequently. We
noted no homology of other predicted genes downstream
of F12A10.3 and C05D2.3 that might suggest an event
duplicating more than the AADC gene.
The retention of the genes and their expression in C. elegans suggests that they may have acquired a new function
that is under selection, retain a subfunction of the AADC,
or instead that they are still in the process of being lost.
After sequencing F12A10.3 cDNAs (courtesy of the ORFeome Project), we found that current splicing predictions
for the gene were incorrect. We sequenced six F12A10.3
clones and found two slightly different splicing patterns,
both different from Genefinder and Intronerator predictions. The two types of clones differed only in whether a
final intron was removed or not. We found 4 clones with
9 exons, and 2 clones with 8 exons. The failure of the gene
prediction programs in this case is likely to be due to their
preference for creating functional transcripts. All
F12A10.3 cDNAs instead appear to be non-functional:
they have frameshifts relative to AADC-homologous reading frames. The first frameshift occurs in the second exon
and quickly leads to a premature stop codon. At best
F12A10.3 transcripts would result in a 158 amino acid
protein that could not function as an AADC. F12A10.3
therefore appears to be an expressed pseudogene. DNA
microarray experiments and representation in cDNA
sequencing projects suggest that F12A10.3, like C05D2.3,
is likely expressed at a low level (Table 2).
In order to assess whether the bas-1-like genes C05D2.3
and F12A10.3 might be under reduced selection pressure,
we calculated the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (KA/KS) comparing the bas-1 orthologs
and bas-1-like genes. We also calculated these values for
the other AADC ortholog pairs from C. elegans and C.
briggsae (Table 3). KA/KS < 1 indicates purifying (negative)
selection, KA/KS = 1 indicates no selection (as in true
pseudogenes), and KA/KS < 1 indicates Darwinian (positive) selection. KA/KS for 8179 C. elegans and C. briggsae
ortholog pairs had a mean value of 0.06, indicating most
genes are under purifying selection [37]. We found that
the bas-1 genes are under purifying selection (KA/KS =
0.039), but the bas-1-like genes appear to be under
reduced selective pressure; the average KA/KS for comparisons with bas-1-like genes was 0.148, more than three
times the value of the bas-1 ortholog comparison. The proportion of observed to potential non-synonymous substitutions (pN) among the bas-1-like gene comparisons was
similarly much higher than for the bas-1 orthologs.

Figure 7 structure of C. elegans AADC genes compared with Human DDC
Genomic
Genomic structure of C. elegans AADC genes compared with Human DDC. Rectangular blocks represent coding
exons of the genes indicated (relative size of exons is approximate). Red triangles indicate ancient conserved introns found in
both Human DDC and at least one of the C. elegans AADC genes; blue triangles indicate introns conserved among C. elegans
AADC genes; and open triangles indicate non-conserved splice sites (comparing only among the genes shown). Roman numerals above triangles indicate the phase of the intron. Vertical dashed lines between solid triangles indicate splice sites conserved
between at least two genes. Diagonal dashed lines indicate probable conserved sites that are shifted by 2–3 amino acids relative
to the other splice site. Alignments of homologous splice sites are based on amino acid multiple alignments of the predicted
proteins; insertions and deletions are ignored in the drawing. No alternative splicing is indicated; the most readily "alignable"
version of each gene was used in cases with multiple splice variants. Dashed boxes at the ends of genes indicate non-AADC
homologous extensions unique to the given gene. The most divergent AADC, C09G9.4, is more difficult to align; assignments
of splice sites on either side of exon 9 as conserved are more tentative (indicated by question marks). In a few cases where
gaps occur in the protein sequence alignments at intron-exon boundaries, introns marked as homologous only begin or end at
an homologous location. The splicing pattern shown is fully supported by cDNA sequences for C05D2.4/bas-1, F12A10.3,
K01C8.3, ZK829.2 ; the pattern is supported by partial cDNA sequences for C05D2.3 and C09G9.4. The extent of supporting
cDNA sequence is shown by the heavy black line beneath the colored blocks. F12A10.3 is a special case in that frameshifts
(indicated by 'fs') occur in the cDNA relative to the AADC homologous sequence. The first frameshift occurs at a site where
many AADCs are spliced (and where a splice is incorrectly predicted by gene prediction programs), and the second at a splice
junction.

ortholog pair is named. pS = proportion of observed/potential synonymous substitutions; pN = proportion of observed/potential nonsynonymous
substitutions. NA – not applicable (cannot be calculated when pS > 0.75). *Includes all pairwise comparisons (n = 5) except C.e. vs. C.b. bas-1. Values
are mean ± SD (strict statistical comparison with other values is not intended, as KA/KS values are not distributed normally).

Two other AADC ortholog pairs showed strong purifying
selection at work, with values like that calculated for the
bas-1 orthologs (Table 3), but a value could not readily be
calculated for the tdc-1 orthologs. In all the AADC
ortholog comparisons, the proportion of observed to
potential synonymous substitutions (pS) was near mutational saturation (pS > 0.75); KA/KS cannot be calculated
when pS > 0.75. Thus, a value could not be calculated
either for full-length tdc-1 alignments, or using a tdc-1 core
sequence. We were able to calculate a value by aligning the
N- and C-terminals sequence of the tdc-1 orthologs (Table
3). These regions of the protein are under levels of selection like the other AADCs, whereas the core has a very low
rate of non-synonymous substitution, consistent with the
high level of amino acid conservation in this region of the
protein.

Discussion
Our experiments demonstrate that the predicted gene
C05D2.4, which encodes an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), corresponds to the genetically-defined
bas-1 gene. Serotonin immunoreactivity is restored in bas1 mutants by DNA containing an intact C05D2.4 gene,
but not with DNA mutated in C05D2.4. The adjacent
AADC-homologous gene, C05D2.3, is not needed to rescue bas-1 mutants. The bas-1 gene is therefore likely to
encode the serotonin- and dopamine-synthetic AADC of
C. elegans. Although we did not test for rescue of
dopamine expression, it is likely that bas-1 encodes the
same AADC required for DA synthesis. Mutants with
point mutations in C05D2.4 – bas-1 alleles n2948 and
n3008 – have been shown previously to be DA-deficient
[17], and neither of these appears to contain mutations in
the C05D2.3 gene. Furthermore, AADC proteins from
other animals have been consistently shown to catalyze
both 5HTP and L-dopa decarboxylation reactions [3].

Finally, a bas-1 reporter construct is expressed both in
identified serotonergic and dopaminergic cells.
The bas-1 gene is expressed in at least two alternatively
spliced forms, one of which appears to be less common
and contains a small additional 27 nucleotide exon. The
short segment of protein encoded by the additional exon,
and the surrounding region are not found in other AADC
proteins, suggesting a novel function for this region of the
AADC protein. In other organisms, the serotonin- and
dopamine-synthetic AADC genes have alternative splicing
that result in tissue-specific protein isoforms. Currently
we have no indication that bas-1 is expressed in any cells
other than serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons, and
no information about the functional significance of this
alternative splicing.
AADC has received somewhat less attention with respect
to the regulation of serotonin and dopamine synthesis
than the specific, rate-limiting synthetic enzymes
tryptophan hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase [51].
This is in part due to the view that AADC activity is not
limiting, and that its activity is not regulated. Regulation
of AADC activity by protein kinase A-dependent
phosphorylation has recently been proposed based on in
vitro experiments [52], although its functional significance
has been questioned [53]. Our examination of the predicted BAS-1 protein revealed several potential phosphorylation sites that are highly conserved, although none fit
the consensus sequence for PKA phosphorylation. Any
possible regulation of C. elegans AADCs by phosphorylation remains speculation.
Possible functions of other AADC homologous genes in C.
elegans
We compared the protein sequences of other predicted
AADCs in C. elegans with those of other organisms in

order to guess about their possible functions. This is particularly relevant because all bas-1 mutants retain weak,
residual serotonin immunoreactivity ([13]; C. Loer,
unpublished) suggesting that other enzymes may be able
to carry out the same reaction. This would not be surprising since animal AADCs tend to have broad specificity [3].
Based purely on sequence homology, it seems that predicted genes K01C8.3 and ZK829.2 could act as AADCs or
as HisDCs. In fact, the predicted gene K01C8.3 is now
believed to be a tyrosine decarboxylase and has been
named tdc-1 [48]. If correct, then its best match in Drosophila (G30446), an uncharacterized AADC homolog, is
likely to encode the fly's octopamine-synthetic tyrosine
decarboxylase. It has long been known that a separate
gene encoded this enzymatic activity in flies, since the
activity is still detectable in Ddc deletion mutants [4]. It
will be interesting to see whether such tyrosine decarboxylases in animals have more restricted substrate specificity, such as the tyrosine and tryptophan decarboxylases
in plants [54], or are more similar to typical animal
AADCs with a broad specificity. Tighter substrate specificity of a tdc-1 protein could be reflected in the much
slower rate of amino acid substitution seen in its C. elegans
& briggsae orthologs than in the bas-1 orthologs which
encode more 'promiscuous' enzymes.
Whether C. elegans or other nematodes make the neurotransmitter histamine, and therefore need a HisDC
enzyme, is unclear. Although histamine has been reportedly isolated from C. elegans [55], this observation is
unique among nematodes, and has not subsequently
been confirmed. There is no particularly good candidate
for a HisDC in C. elegans. The ZK829.2 predicted protein
may be most closely related to tdc-1 in its core sequence,
although its long N- and C-terminal extensions are perhaps suggestive of a new function. Unfortunately,
transgenics with reporter fusions of this gene to date have
shown no expression, the pattern of which might suggest
a function (C. Loer, unpublished; M. Alkema, personal
communication). As with tdc-1, C. elegans ZK829.2 and its
C. briggsae ortholog have also evolved more slowly than
the bas-1 orthologs. A recent analysis of eukaryotic AADC
sequences that includes the C. elegans ZK829.2 and its C.
briggsae ortholog as the only nematode representatives
clearly demonstrates that AADC genes can evolve at very
different rates, and that a constant "molecular clock" cannot be assumed in phylogenetic analyses [56].
Finally, since the C09G9.4 predicted protein is so highly
divergent from the typical AADC, and lacks a critical
lysine residue that binds the PLP cofactor, it is unlikely to
be an AADC enzyme. It has a similar level of divergence
from genuine AADCs as do other group II PLP-dependent
enzymes such as cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase, to
which it has little or no similarity. Whatever the function

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/24

of a C09G9.4-encoded protein, it appears to represent a
new PLP-DC-related protein; sequencing of more
genomes may yet reveal additional members.
Duplicate gene retention and loss in Caenorhabditis
We found that the closest relatives of C05D2.4/bas-1 in C.
elegans, the genes C05D2.3 and F12A10.3, are missing
from C. briggsae. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicates the two extra genes did not arise in the C. elegans
line, but were present (or their commmon ancestor was
present) in the species that gave rise to both the C. elegans
and C. briggsae lines. Finally, careful examination of the
cDNAs and predicted protein sequences of C05D2.3 and
F12A10.3 reveals that neither is likely to be functional as
an AADC: the former lacks critical amino acids and the latter can encode only a truncated protein. Both are
expressed, based on the presence of cDNAs, but probably
at a very low level, which is not above background in
microarray experiments. It is possible that the duplicate
genes are functionally 'lost' in C. elegans as well.

The features of C05D2.3 and F12A10.3 raise a number of
interesting questions about the fate of duplicate genes,
and the true nature of many 'predicted genes' in C. elegans.
Taking a random sampling of predicted genes and generating transgenics with reporter fusion constructs (in order
to determine a pattern of expression), Mounsey and colleagues [57] found that a much higher percentage of
recently duplicated genes than conserved or unique genes
failed to show expression. Assuming that failure of expression was no more likely among recently duplicated genes
for technical reasons, this meant that many more of these
are in reality not expressed. The numbers suggested that
up to 20% of annotated, predicted genes in C. elegans may
be pseudogenes. In fact, careful inspection of recently
duplicated genes showed that many were actually pseudogenes, like we found to be the case for F12A10.3. Overall,
close inspection of predicted genes revealed at least 4%
were pseudogenes.
So, why are C05D2.3 and F12A10.3 still present in C. elegans if they lack a function? C. briggsae and C. elegans may
have diverged 80 – 110 million years ago [37,38]. Since
the bas-1-like gene or genes were likely present in the common ancestor of C. elegans and C. briggsae, then there
seems to have been ample time for loss in the C. elegans
line. Under a simple model of gene loss following duplication, only a few million generations would be the mean
time to fix a null allele of the gene duplicate [58]. In
Caenorhabditis, a million generations could be completed
in 10,000 years or less. This seems to suggest that the
downstream duplicate of bas-1 (ancestor of C05D2.3)
may have continued to function for a considerable time
after the duplication, perhaps by gene conversion which
might have continued until sufficient divergence from bas-

1 [59]. Loss of the critical six amino acids occurred after
the second duplication giving rise to the ancestor of
F12A10.3, since the appropriate sequence is still present
there (although frame-shifted). It is also possible that the
C05D2.3 gene retains some function. The gene still
encodes a respectable protein, albeit one that seems unable to function as an AADC. It has diverged considerably
from bas-1, but has not accumulated stop codons and
frameshifts expected for a pseudogene. Walsh [60] has
proposed that fixation of an allele with an advantageous
new function, vs. becoming a pseudogene, may be the fate
of many duplicate genes even when such mutations are
rare, given a population that is sufficiently large.
C05D2.3 and F12A10. 3 seem to have been retained
longer than expected. Lynch and Force [61] proposed that
the unexpectedly high rate of gene duplicate retention in
eukaryotic genomes is due to 'subfunctionalization' – the
retention of a portion of the original single gene's function by each of the duplicates, which then complement
one another. Although this was suggested to occur primarily by regulatory mutations that partition expression of
the genes spatially, other forms of subfunctionalization
could also occur. Another possible reason for retaining
such genes is the presence of non-coding regulatory functions associated with transcription and splicing of these
sub-functional transcripts that affect the transcription of
other nearby genes, although a bas-1::GFP construct is
expressed well without such sequences in cis.
Our analysis of synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitutions indicates that the bas-1-like genes C05D2.3 and
F12A10.3 are under relaxed selection relative to bas-1 and
other AADCs. It should be noted that precise quantitative
comparisons cannot be made with the results presented in
the C. briggsae whole genome analysis [37], since we used
a different method of calculating KA/KS; however our calculations indicate that bas-1 and the other AADC's, like
most genes in the Caenorhabditis genomes, are under
strong purifying selection. Even if both C05D2.3 and
F12A10.3 are now pseudogenes, some significant period
of time during which they functioned and were under
purifying selection could act to obscure this fact in an
analysis of KA/KS. Even if C05D2.3 has acquired a new,
adaptive function, such a new function might result from
changes in only a few sites in the protein, and so again this
could be obscured by a majority of sites under purifying
selection. With the sequencing of three related Caenorhabditis species it will be interesting to learn of the fates of bas1 and the bas-1-like genes in other lines.

Conclusions
The bas-1 gene encodes a serotonin- and dopamine-synthetic AADC enzyme in C. elegans. The C. elegans genome
possesses five other AADC-homologous genes, two of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/24

which are closely related to bas-1. These bas-1-like genes
are missing, however, from the congeneric C. briggsae, and
evidence suggests that, despite their persistence in C. elegans, the genes do not encode functional AADC proteins.
Since one or more of the bas-1-like genes was likely
present in the common ancestor of C. elegans and C.
briggsae- which may have diverged over 80 million years
ago – it is unclear why the bas-1-like genes have been
retained in the C. elegans line. This is another example of
unexpected retention of duplicate genes in eukaryotic
genomes.

Methods
Routine culturing of Caenorhabditis elegans was performed
as described by Brenner [62]. Nomenclature used here for
C. elegans genetics conforms to the conventions set forth
by Horvitz et al. [63]. Strains used include N2 (wild type);
CB1490: him-5(e1490)V; MT7988: bas-1(ad446)III;
MT7990: bas-1(n2948)III; MT8002: bas-1(n3008)III; LC7:
bas-1(pa4)III; LC33: bas-1(tm351)III. The him-5(e1490)
strain generates approximately 30% males by increased X
chromosome non-disjunction [64], but is otherwise
essentially wild-type.
Mutant allele sequencing
Mutations were identified by PCR-amplifying small
regions from genomic DNA, then sequencing purified
PCR product. We isolated genomic DNA (Puregene Kit,
Gentra Systems) from four bas-1 mutant strains (alleles
ad446, n2948, n3008, pa4) and then PCR-amplified small
segments of C05D2.4 and C05D2.3 protein-coding
sequence. Five pairs of primers were used to survey the
C05D2.4 gene (A+B, E+F, G+H, P+Q, R+S; see below for
primer sequences) and 4 pairs for C05D2.3 (C+D, K+L,
M+N, P+Q). Bands of the predicted size were excised from
2% agarose gels and purified with GeneClean (Bio101/
Qbiogene), then sequenced. All mutations were
confirmed by sequencing both strands for two independent PCR reactions. All PCR and sequencing primers were
designed using the program Primer3 (http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu; [65]). Primer sequences were as follows. Within C05D2.4: C05D2-A: gaggaaactcaaggcgacac;
C05D2-B: tgttgatggaaccaagtgga; C05D2-E: cgtccttttctctttgcgac; C05D2-F: tggctccgacttgattctct ; C05D2-G: ttacaattaggccgcaaacc; C05D2-H: ccacctgaactgtggtgatg; C05D2-P:
ggactcacatgtttccgattg; C05D2-R: ttagacgttggttgcacgag;
C05D2-S: attggcgagcagtcaaagtt ; C05D2-T: tcttatgggattaccagaac; C05D2-U: ctacataaagctggaatggt; C05D2-V: gtttcctaaaaatccacgtg; C05D2-W: atgatcgattgatagctgag. Within
C05D2.3: C05D2-C: ctaggtgcctttgccttctg; C05D2-D: caagagacgctcgttgtcag; C05D2-K: gccatctaatcctccaacca; C05D2-L:
acattgctcccttttcaacg [note that primer L can also prime
within C05D2.4]; C05D2-M: ccatcaactttccaatggct; C05D2N: tctcgacgcccatatttctc; C05D2-Q: ccaattccagcggagaagta.

Microinjection to create transgenics
All DNAs for microinjection were purified with Qiagen
tip20 columns. Experimental DNAs were co-injected with
the dominant marker plasmid pRF4 containing the
mutant gene rol-6(su1006) [66] into N2 (wildtype),
CB1490, or bas-1 mutant worms. Progeny of injectees that
express the rol-6 dominant plasmid have the easy-to-identify Roller phenotype which results in worms with a helically-twisted body along the anterior-posterior axis. Roller
transgenic worms typically carry co-injected DNAs. Transgenic Roller progeny were isolated and propagated; rescue
of bas-1 mutants was scored by staining with serotonin
antiserum as described previously[16,67].
Mutant rescue with subclones of cosmid C05D2 and
plasmid C05D2XN; GFP Reporter Construct
The rescuing plasmid C05D2XN contains a 15.8 kbp
genomic DNA insert (XhoI to NheI) derived from the cosmid C05D2, and contains both C05D2.4 and C05D2.3
predicted genes. A number of deletions of C05D2XN were
made to test for rescue of bas-1 mutants. Clones were analyzed by restriction digests. We also made C05D2XN
derivatives in which either C05D2.4 and C05D2.3 was
mutated to introduce a premature stop in coding
sequence. Clones were sequenced to determine the nature
of the introduced mutation. Clone pCL6991 had a 4 bp
deletion in the second exon of C05D2.4; pCL7991 had a
2 bp insertion in the first exon of C05D2.3; each causing
a frameshift mutation. In the clone pCL7003, derived
from the rescuing plasmid pCL3001, almost the entire
C05D2.3 coding sequence is deleted. The bas-1 GFP
reporter construct (within transgenics) was kindly provided by Ian Hope, and consists of a PCR-generated fragment of C05D2 with 4595 bp upstream of the predicted
translation start site and 403 bp protein coding region to
make an in-frame protein fusion in the 2nd exon. The
construct was created by a multi-site recombination reaction with the C05D2 fragment, PCR-generated GFP, and
vector using the Invitrogen Gateway cloning system (I.
Hope, personal communication) as continuation of a
project to determine expression patterns for C. elegans
genes through reporter gene technology [57].
RT-PCR and cDNA clones
We isolated RNA for RT-PCR from mixed stage CB1490
worms. (The CB1490 strain has ~30% males, whereas
wildtype N2 has ~0.2% males. Since adult males have 13
more serotonergic neurons and 6 more dopaminergic
neurons than hermaphrodites, we reasoned that these
worms might express more bas-1 mRNA.) Worms were
isolated from six 100 mm NGM plates, washed several
times with M9 buffer, and pooled to form a ~100 µl pellet
of worms. The pellet was mixed with 175 µl RNA lysis
buffer (SV Total RNA Isolation System, Promega), frozen
and ground to a fine powder with a pestle and mortar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/24

cooled with liquid nitrogen. The powder was recovered in
a fresh microfuge tube, mixed with 350 µl SV RNA dilution buffer and centrifuged to remove debris. The cleared
lysate was transferred to a new tube and precipitated with
200 µl 95% ethanol and applied to the SV spin column
assembly. The remaining RNA purification was performed
exactly as described for the SV System "RNA Purification
by Centrifugation." Purified RNA was eluted from the
spin column with 100 µl nuclease-free water. RNA was
converted to cDNA in a 80 µl reaction containing 800
Units of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies/
BRL), 16 µl 5X RT buffer, 25 mM dNTPs, 80 Units RNAsin
(Promega) 2.0 µg random hexamer primers (Life Tech),
and 50 µl purified RNA (from above). Bas-1(C05D2.4)
and C05D2.3 cDNAs were amplified by PCR from him-5
cDNA produced as described above, typically using Failsafe PCR mixes (Epicentre Technologies). Conditions for
PCR were 94°C (1 min.), 50°C (1 min.), 72°C (3 min.)
for 40 cycles, then 72°C (10 min.). Primers used to
amplify C05D2.4 cDNAs were SL1-B + C05D2-L and SL1B + C05D2-B; a partial C05D2.3 cDNA was amplified
with primers C05D2-M and -N. Spliced leader primer
sequences were as follows: SL1-B: AAAGGATCCTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG; SL2-B: AAAGGATCCTTTTAACCCAGTTACTCAAG. Appropriately-sized bands were
isolated with GeneClean or Ultrafree-DA (Millipore),
then cloned directly into the pCRII-TOPO vector using the
TOPO-TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). From seven of our RTPCR derived clones we sequenced, we found two different
splice variants different form the Genefinder prediction
(see results).
We also obtained cDNA clones from the ORFeome project
[40] and the C. elegans EST project (courtesy Yuki Kohara).
DNA we received from the ORFeome project is purified
from a pool of transformants derived from ligation and
transformation of their original RT-PCR, thereby allowing
the isolation of internal splice variants from the mix. We
transformed with this DNA and isolated several clones.
We sequenced two ORFeome clones completely; six more
clones were partially sequenced. Interestingly, each of the
8 clones appeared to have at least one mutation (compared to known genomic sequence). Since we found one
splice variant containing the 27 bp microexon from
among the eight clones that we sequenced, we analyzed
29 additional ORFeome project-derived clones by PCR
from single isolated bacterial colonies. Amplification of
the region between primers C05D2-T and -L allowed us to
distinguish between clones with or without the 27 bp
microexon based on product size (464 bp versus 437 bp).
Seven of 29 clones were the larger size, so likely contained
the 27 bp microexon. None of the ORFeome clones analyzed by sequence or PCR appeared to use the alternative
exon 3 splice acceptor noted above. Finally, the two 'YK'
cDNA clones from the C. elegans EST project that we exam-

ined are from a 'full-length' capped library, and each has
an SL1 leader and a poly-A tail. We found that each bas-1
'YK' clone, however, contained a different internal deletion (overall abnormality of these clones is reported at
~5% – J. Theirry-Meig, personal communication). Each of
the deletions was adjacent to a short repeated sequence.
