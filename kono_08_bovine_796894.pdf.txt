Abstract
Background: Akabane virus is a member of the genus Orthobunyavirus in the family Bunyaviridae. It is
transmitted by hematophagous arthropod vectors such as Culicoides biting midges and is widely distributed
in temperate to tropical regions of the world. The virus is well known as a teratogenic pathogen which
causes abortions, stillbirths, premature births and congenital abnormalities with arthrogryposishydranencephaly syndrome in cattle, sheep and goats. On the other hand, it is reported that the virus
rarely induces encephalomyelitis in cattle by postnatal infection. A first large-scale epidemic of Akabane
viral encephalomyelitis in cattle occurred in the southern part of Japan from summer to autumn in 2006.
The aim of this study is to define the epidemiological, pathological and virological properties of the disease.
Results: Nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis was observed in cattle that showed neurological symptoms
such as astasia, ataxia, opisthotonus and hypersensitivity in beef and dairy farms by histopathological
analysis. Akabane viral antigen and genome were consistently detected from the central nervous system
of these animals, and the virus was isolated not only from them but also from the blood samples of clinically
healthy calves in the epidemic area. The isolates were classified into genogroup I a containing the Iriki
strain, which caused encephalitis of calves almost twenty years ago in Japan. Most of the affected cattle
possessed the neutralizing antibody against Akabane virus. Seroconversion of the cohabitated and sentinel
cattle in the epidemic area was also confirmed during an outbreak of the disease.
Conclusion: The ecological and epidemiological data we have obtained so far demonstrated that the
Akabane virus is not endemic in Japan. No evidence of Akabane virus circulation was observed in 2005
through nation-wide serological surveillance, suggesting that a new strain belonging to genogroup I a
invaded southern Japan from overseas in the summer of 2006 and caused an unprecedented epizootic of
encephalomyelitis mainly in susceptible calves. It will be necessary to reconsider the vaccine strategy to
control the disease effectually.

Background
Akabane virus is classified into the genus Orthobunyavirus
in the family Bunyaviridae. It is widely distributed from the
tropical to temperate zones of the world and has been
associated with hematophagous arthropod vectors such as
Culicoides biting midges and mosquitoes, and with ruminants [1-4]. Akabane virus causes epizootic and sporadic
outbreaks of abortions, stillbirths, premature births and
congenital malformations characterized by arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome when susceptible pregnant cattle, sheep and goats are infected [5-7]. These
outbreaks have been observed in Japan, Korea, Taiwan,
Australia, Israel and Turkey [1,8,9], and have repeatedly
caused serious economic losses in the livestock industry.
It is estimated that more than 42000 abnormal calves
were born during the largest outbreak in 1972–75 in
Japan. Following that outbreak, attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been developed on the basis of the
OBE-1 strain isolated from a naturally infected bovine
fetus in 1974 to prevent the disease [10,11].
It is apparent that Akabane virus shares many common
features with other members of the genus Orthobunyavirus
[12]. It possesses a lipid envelope and a genome comprising three segments of a single-stranded, negative-sense
RNA designated large (L; 6868 nucleotides), medium (M;
4309 nucleotides) and small (S; 858 nucleotides) [13-15].
The L RNA segment encodes the L protein which contains
RNA polymerase activity for replication and transcription
of the viral genome. The M RNA segment encodes two
viral envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and a nonstructural (NSm) protein in the form of a precursor polypeptide which is processed by post-translational cleavage. The
glycoproteins are responsible for viral neutralization,
hemagglutination and attachment to the host cell receptors, while the NSm protein seems to be involved in the
process of virus assembly and morphogenesis [16]. The S
RNA segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein and a
smaller nonstructural (NSs) protein in overlapping reading frames. The N protein shares common antigenic determinants with some other species in the genus. The NSs
protein may serve as an alpha/beta interferon antagonist
and may be active in the regulation of host protein synthesis and apoptosis [17-19].
Since the strain JaGAr 39 (prototype strain of Akabane
virus) was first isolated from Aedes vexans and Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes in Gunma prefecture in 1959
[20], many strains have been continuously isolated from
the Culicoides species and cattle in Japan [21-23]. Recent
studies have demonstrated that there are considerable variations in virulence, antigenic properties and nucleotide
sequences among the field isolates of Akabane virus
[15,22,24-27]. In particular, the Iriki strain is recognized
as a typical variant of the virus [22]. A disease character-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/4/20

ized by nervous symptoms was observed in ten calves
ranging in age from 3 days to 16 months in southern
Japan from October to November, 1984. A strain, named
'Iriki', was isolated from the cerebellum of a calf with nonsuppurative encephalitis and identified as an antigenic
variant of Akabane virus by the cross-neutralization test.
Subsequent seroepidemiological investigation and experimental infection of calves have established that this
strain is the causative agent of the disease [22]. Although
Akabane virus infection in mature cattle usually results in
transient viremia without any clinical signs, a highly pathogenic strain might have the potential to cause encephalitis in cattle by postnatal infection. Small-scale sporadic
outbreaks of bovine encephalitis caused by Akabane virus
have also been reported in the neighboring countries of
Taiwan and Korea [2,28].
In 2006, bovine encephalomyelitis associated with
Akabane virus has broken out on a large scale in southern
Japan. In this article, we describe the clinical, epidemiological and histopathological features of the disease, and
the antigenic and genetic characteristics of the strains isolated from the affected and clinically healthy calves in the
epidemic area in order to contribute to the understanding
of Akabane viral encephalomyelitis.

Results
Clinical and epidemiological features
A total of 180 cattle with neurological disorders were
reported in five prefectures (Kumamoto, Kagoshima,
Oita, Miyazaki and Ehime) in the southern part of Japan
from the end of August to the middle of December in
2006 (Figure 1). Out of 180 affected cattle, 124 (68.9%)
and 41 (22.8%) were observed in the Kumamoto and
Kagoshima prefectures, respectively, in the Kyushu district. The cattle ranged in age from 4 days to 96 months
and showed astasia, dysstasia, ataxia, tremor, nystagmus,
opisthotonus and hypersensitivity. Astasia accompanied
with paralysis of the hind legs and/or forelegs appeared in
most of the affected cattle, while fever and anorexia were
rarely detected. These symptoms were found principally
in cattle under 24 months of age (140 (77.8%) of 180 cattle). No significant relationship was indicated between
the disease and the breed or sex of the cattle.
Histological findings and immunostaining for Akabane
virus antigens in the central nervous system of affected
cattle
In 72 affected animals found in the Kumamoto and
Kagoshima prefectures, no remarkable gross changes were
observed in the brain, spinal cord, skeletal muscles or
other organs. However, typical nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis characterized by severe to mild perivascular
infiltration of mononuclear cells, glial nodules consisting
of microglia (Figure 2), and neuronal degeneration and/

or necrosis were considerably accumulated in the midbrain, cerebellopontine and medulla oblongata, but
mildly in the cerebrum and cerebellum in most of the
affected animals. In addition, neuronophagia was occasionally detected in the ventral horns of the spinal cord
with moderate inflammatory changes. Strong immunoreactivity for Akabane virus antigens was mainly observed
within the cytoplasm of neurons and nerve axons (Figure
3), and occasionally in vascular endothelial cells and macrophages aggregated in the perivascular cuffing (Figure 4)
shown in the brain stem area of the affected animals. The
intensity and number of focal areas of positive immunoreactivity for the virus antigens tended to increase with the
severity of the inflammatory reaction.
RT-PCR detection and isolation of Akabane virus
Specific PCR products of 389 base pairs were detected in
39 (54.2%) of 72 cattle with nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis. Finally, seven virus strains were isolated from
these PCR-positive specimens by HmLu-1 cell cultures.
Four strains were also isolated from the blood or plasma
of clinically healthy calves collected between September
and October on the affected farms. Furthermore, a strain
designated KSB-3/P/06 was isolated from the healthy sentinel cattle in Kyushu Research Station, National Institute
of Animal Health, in Kagoshima prefecture during an out-

of the Iriki strain and was classified in antigenic group 3
as described by Yoshida and Tsuda [25].
Further antigenic comparison between one of the isolates,
KM-1/Br/06 strain, and the OBE-1 and Iriki strains was
performed by the cross-neutralization test using rabbit
antisera to these three strains. As demonstrated by the
immunobinding assay, the KM-1/Br/06 strain was antigenically identical to the Iriki strain, but was distant from
the OBE-1 strain (Table 2). The OBE-1 strain has been
neutralized by antibodies against the Iriki and KM-1/Br/
06 strains as well as homologous strains.

the case farms possessed the neutralizing antibody against
Akabane virus. Annual serological surveillance of arthropod-borne viruses demonstrated that 60 (45.5%) of 132
healthy sentinel calves in both prefectures exhibited seroconversion to Akabane virus between September and
November in 2006. No seroconversions to the other
bovine arthropod-borne viruses, such as Aino, blue-

viruses, were observed in these sentinel calves this year.
Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of the S
and M RNA genomic segments
Nucleotide sequences of the S and M RNA segments of
isolates were determined, and their open reading frames
(ORFs) were compared respectively with those of the
Akabane virus strains previously reported [27]. The ORF
sequence of the S RNA segment (699 nucleotides) was
highly conserved among 12 strains isolated during an outbreak of bovine encephalomyelitis (99.6–100% identity).
The sequence identities among one representative strain
of 2006 isolates (KM-1/Br/06), Iriki, OBE-1 and the prototype strain JaGAr39 ranged from 95.9 to 99.0% at the
nucleotide level and from 99.1 to 100% at the amino acid
level (Table 3). The strains KM-1/Br/06, KM-2/Br/06, KS2/Mo/06 and KSB-3/P/06 were selected for further analysis of the ORF sequence of the M RNA segment (4203
nucleotides) encoding the neutralizing antigen. The
nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the M RNA segment were also well conserved among these four strains
from 2006 (99.9% and 99.9–100% identity in the nucleTable 2: Antigenic comparison among Akabane virus strains by

Strain

To define the genetic relationships between the strains
isolated in 2006 and the previous isolates of the Akabane
virus, the phylogenetic trees of these two segments were
constructed. As previously reported [27], the field isolates
of Akabane virus were segregated into four distinct lineages (genogroups I – IV) based on the sequence of an M
RNA segment. Genogroup I was subdivided into two
monophyletic clusters, I a and I b. As shown in Figure 6,
the KM-1/Br/06 strain was classified into subgroup I a
containing the Iriki strain. The phylogenetic tree of the S
RNA segment was almost the same as that of the M RNA
segment (data not shown) [26,27].

Discussion
An epizootic of the disease with neurological disorders in
cattle was observed in the southern part of Japan from
summer to autumn in 2006. It was initially suggested that
the disease was associated with some neurotropic arthropod-borne viruses due to its seasonal occurrence over an
extensive area and to the histopathological findings of the
affected cattle. We eventually identified Akabane virus as
the cause of the disease, as in that observed in 1984 [22],
through the detection of the viral antigen and genome in
the clinical samples, the isolation of the virus from the
affected and clinically healthy cattle in the epidemic area
and serological evidence.

Diseases caused by various arthropod-borne viruses, such
as Akabane, Aino, Chuzan, Ibaraki and bovine ephemeral
fever viruses, have been recognized as major obstacles to
the production of beef and dairy cattle in Japan. Above all,
Akabane virus is considered to be the most important
because the virus circulation has been observed almost
every year for over four decades since 1959. Seroconversion of sentinel calves has always been confirmed after the
rainy season (June to July) through nation-wide serological surveillance of bovine arthropod-borne viruses. Entomological investigations in southern Japan continuing
over two decades indicate that Culicoides oxystoma is the
principal vector and that bovine arthropod-borne viruses
have been isolated between summer and autumn (August
to November) when adult midges are abundant [23].
Molecular analyses of the field isolates of Akabane virus
collected from 1959 to the present in Japan and phylogenetic comparisons with isolates from Taiwan, Israel, Australia and Kenya demonstrated that the virus circulating
widely in Asia seems to have evolved in a common gene
pool and can clearly be differentiated from strains existing
in Oceania and Africa [26,27]. Given that Akabane virus is
unlikely to be persistent in the winter season in Japan,
these findings may suggest that the virus is introduced
repeatedly from lower latitude areas (tropical and subtropical zones) in Asia, where the climatic conditions are
more suitable, by infected Culicoides biting midges carried
on the seasonal wind over long distances [23,29]. A single
strain adaptable to the Japanese environment might
spread transiently and cause the disease to recur seasonally [23,26]. However, the possibility of viral overwintering in Culicoides larvae by vertical transmission should be
confirmed by further investigations of virus-vector interactions.
No evidence of Akabane virus circulation was observed in
Japan in 2005 via nation-wide surveillance using sentinel
animals. Therefore, it is considered that a new strain initially invaded from overseas into Kumamoto prefecture,
where the first clinical case was reported on 30 August in
2006, and then was spread throughout the southern part
of Japan by Culicoides biting midges until late autumn.
The virus finally caused an unprecedented outbreak of
encephalomyelitis, mainly in susceptible calves. The
absence of the virus circulation in 2005 may have
increased the number of susceptible animals without antibody against Akabane virus (data not shown). This may
be one of the factors that facilitated a large-scale outbreak
of the disease.
There are four Akabane virus genogroups, of which two
groups, I and II, are extant in Japan [26,27], whereas the
field isolates can be separated into at least five antigenic
groups by an immunobinding assay using neutralizing
antibodies [25]. Although several discrepancies exist

between the genetic and antigenic classifications, the isolates in the antigenic group 3 are consistently included in
subgenogroup I a [27]. Twelve strains isolated during
2006 were classified into subgenogroup I a together with
the Iriki strain which caused encephalitis in calves in
1984. When introduced by intracerebral inoculation, the
Iriki strain produced severe nervous symptoms in calves
similar to those observed in natural infection [22]. Interestingly, the histopathological findings in this report were
also quite similar to those in cattle infected with the
Akabane virus Iriki strain [2,22]. In contrast, the JaGAr 39
and OBE-1 strains belonging to genogroup II caused only
slight or no nervous symptoms in the intracerebrally
infected calves [30]. Although more experimental data
using some other strains and more clinical data in the
field will be required to confirm precise relationship
between pathogenicity and genogroups, these previous
experiments and the epizootic of encephalomyelitis in
2006 suggest that the neurovirulence of strains in genogroup I a is much stronger than that of strains in genogroup II.
The KM-1/Br/06 strain was isolated from a 4-day-old calf
with nervous symptoms (Table 1), indicating the vertical
transmission of the virus from the infected dam to the
fetus. We have therefore traced any abnormal births of cattle in the epidemic area. Consequently, 16 cases of premature births and congenital abnormalities related to
Akabane virus have been confirmed from October 2006
through April 2007. Viral genome identical to that of the
isolates in 2006 was detected in four calves accompanied
by nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis (data not shown).
Akabane viral antigen was also found in the brain of one
of four PCR-positive calves, but unfortunately no viruses
were isolated from these calves. The Akabane virus strains
belonging to genogroup I a might be involved not only in
encephalomyelitis by postnatal infection but also in conventional teratogenicity by transplacental infection. These
strains have been frequently isolated in Japan since 2000
[26,27]. An antigenic difference was recognized between
the OBE-1 (the origin of vaccine strain TS-C2) and KM-1/
Br/06 strains as shown in this study. It is, therefore, better
to develop a novel vaccine for proper prevention and control of the disease. The newly isolated KM-1/Br/06 strain
will be one of the candidates for the advanced vaccine. It
will also be important to establish surveillance system in
cooperation with countries where Akabane virus is
endemic in order to compare and share virological, epidemiological and entomological information.

Conclusion
A large-scale outbreak of the disease characterized by neurological symptoms such as astasia, ataxia, tremor, nystagmus, opisthotonus and hypersensitivity occurred in beef
and dairy cattle in southern Japan from summer to

autumn in 2006. Nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis was
observed in these clinical cases by histopathological findings. Akabane viral antigen and genome were detected in
the central nervous system of the affected cattle. Akabane
virus was isolated not only from them but also from the
blood samples of cohabitated and sentinel cattle in the
epidemic area. The isolates were closely related to the Iriki
strain in genogroup I a, which caused encephalitis in
calves in 1984. Most of the affected cattle possessed the
neutralizing antibody against Akabane virus. Seroconversion of the sentinel calves was also confirmed during an
outbreak of the disease. No evidence of Akabane virus circulation was observed in 2005 in the nation-wide serological surveillance, suggesting that a new strain belonging to
genogroup I a invaded southern Japan from overseas in
the summer of 2006 and caused an epizootic of encephalomyelitis in cattle. It is recommended that an advanced
vaccine be developed to control the disease properly.

Methods
Processing of tissues for histopathology and
immunohistochemistry
Tissue samples of central nervous systems were collected
from 72 affected cattle. These were fixed with 10% buffered formalin and processed for paraffin-wax embedding.
The tissue sections from each paraffin block were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examination. One pair of serial sections from cattle that showed
neurological symptoms was submitted for immunohistochemical assessment of the detection of Akabane viral
antigens. After deparaffinization of the pair sections,
endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by treatment with 3% H2O2 in absolute methanol for 20 min at
room temperature. In each section pair, one section was
incubated with a rabbit antiserum (1:2000 dilution)
against the Akabane virus OBE-1 strain [31], while the
other was not incubated with the antiserum as a negative
control. The sections were then labeled using a
HISTOFINE SAB-PO kit (Nichirai Co., Tokyo) containing
a biotinylated secondary antibody for anti-rabbit IgG and
streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase. Localized peroxidase
conjugates were visualized with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine.
All sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin.
Extraction and amplification of viral genome from clinical
samples
Tissue specimens obtained from the brain and spinal cord
of affected cattle were rinsed, minced and homogenized
in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM)
(Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant of a 10% homogenate of each tissue was used for viral
RNA preparation. Total RNA was extracted using the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
The primer pairs AKAI172F/AKAI560R (5'-CAGAAGAAGGCCAAGATGGT-3'/5'-AAGTTGACATCCATTCCATC-3')

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/4/20

and the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) were used
for detecting the viral S RNA segment. Reverse transcription was conducted at 50°C for 30 min. This mixture was
then heated for 95°C for 15 min to stop the reaction and
to activate HotStart Taq DNA polymerase. The resulting
cDNA was amplified by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C
for 45 s followed by one step of final extension at 72°C for
10 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a
1.5% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium
bromide.
Virus isolation
The supernatant described above was also used for virus
isolation. On the other hand, blood samples were collected from clinically healthy cattle in the affected farms
and from sentinel calves. Heparinized blood samples
were separated into erythrocytes and plasma by centrifugation, and the erythrocytes were washed three times with
cold PBS. The supernatant of 10% homogenates of tissues,
plasma and washed erythrocytes were stored at -80°C
until use. Several blood samples were directly used as
inoculum after being frozen and thawed once. These specimens were inoculated into monolayer cultures of hamster lung (HmLu-1) and/or baby hamster kidney (BHK21) cells. After incubation at 37°C for 7 days, the cell culture fluids were pooled and subinoculated into freshly
prepared cell cultures at least twice until the infected cells
exhibited the cytopathic effect.
Immunobinding assay
Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N protein and
seven neutralizing epitopes (A1, A2, B, C1, C2, D and E)
on the Gc protein of Akabane virus strain OBE-1 were
used for antigenic characterization of the isolates [25].
The supernatants of virus-infected cells were blotted onto
an Immobilon-P membrane (MILLPORE, Bedford, MA,
USA) using the blotting apparatus with 9 cm-long slots.
The membrane was immersed in blocking buffer (8%
skimmed milk powder in TBS; 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl) at 4°C overnight. Then the membrane was
turned 90 degrees around and placed again into the same
blotting apparatus described above. Each diluted monoclonal antibody was added to a slot and incubated for 1 h
at room temperature on an orbital shaker. After three
washes in TBS, the membrane was reacted with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG
(Cappel/ICN, Aurora, OH, USA) for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed five times with TBS. The immune
complexes were detected by color development with 3, 3'diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as a substrate.
Virus neutralization test
Bovine sera were serially diluted twofold with serum-free
MEM in the 96-well cell culture microplates. Each serum

Page 8 of 10

BMC Veterinary Research 2008, 4:20

dilution was mixed with an equal volume of 200 50% tissue culture infective doses/0.05 ml of virus and incubated
at 37°C for 1 h. Then 0.1 ml volumes of HmLu-1 cells suspended in GIT medium (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were added to each well. After incubation at 37°C for 7 days, the antibody titer was determined
as a reciprocal of the highest serum dilution showing
complete inhibition of the cytopathic effect. For a crossneutralization test, rabbit immune sera to the OBE-1, Iriki
and KM-1/Br/06 strains of Akabane virus were produced
by the method described previously [22] with the
approval of the Animal Ethics Committee, National Institute of Animal Health (11 June, 2007), under approval
number 07-60.
RT-PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of virusinfected cells using the High Pure Viral RNA kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) for sequencing. Oligonucleotide primers AINO-5' (5'-AGTAGTGTGGCTCCAC-3') and AINO-3' (5'-AGTAGTGTACTCCACTAT-3')
were used for RT-PCR of the S RNA segment. These primers corresponding to the terminal sequences of the Aino
virus S RNA segment are available for specific amplification of the corresponding gene of some other species
including Akabane virus [26,32]. The full-length M RNA
segment was amplified by RT-PCR using the primer
AKAMEND21
(5'-AGTAGTGWWCTACCACAACAA-3')
[27]. The cDNAs of S and M RNA segments were synthesized and amplified with the Titan One Tube RT-PCR kit
(Roche Diagnostics) under the conditions described previously [26,27]. The PCR fragments were purified by the
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and directly
sequenced in both orientations with sequencing primers
specific to the S and M RNA segments [26,27], respectively, of Akabane virus using the BigDye Terminator v3.1
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
and the ABI3100-Avanti Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed by DNASIS Pro version 2.0 (Hitachi Software
Engineering, Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and the University of
Wisconsin Genetic Computer Group (UWGCG) package.
The sequences were aligned by the CLUSTAL W program
[33]. The phylogenetic trees of the coding regions in the S
and M RNA segments were constructed by the neighborjoining method [34] using Kimura's two-parameter formula, and the reliability of the branching orders was evaluated by the bootstrap test (n = 1000). The resulting
dendrogram was viewed and edited using the Tree View
program [35].
