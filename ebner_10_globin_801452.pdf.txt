evolution

Abstract
Background: The lancelet amphioxus (Cephalochordata) is a close relative of vertebrates and thus may enhance
our understanding of vertebrate gene and genome evolution. In this context, the globins are one of the best
studied models for gene family evolution. Previous biochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of an
intracellular globin in notochord tissue and myotome of amphioxus, but the corresponding gene has not yet been
identified. Genomic resources of Branchiostoma floridae now facilitate the identification, experimental confirmation
and molecular evolutionary analysis of its globin gene repertoire.
Results: We show that B. floridae harbors at least fifteen paralogous globin genes, all of which reveal evidence of
gene expression. The protein sequences of twelve globins display the conserved characteristics of a functional
globin fold. In phylogenetic analyses, the amphioxus globin BflGb4 forms a common clade with vertebrate
neuroglobins, indicating the presence of this nerve globin in cephalochordates. Orthology is corroborated by
conserved syntenic linkage of BflGb4 and flanking genes. The kinetics of ligand binding of recombinantly expressed
BflGb4 reveals that this globin is hexacoordinated with a high oxygen association rate, thus strongly resembling
vertebrate neuroglobin. In addition, possible amphioxus orthologs of the vertebrate globin X lineage and of the
myoglobin/cytoglobin/hemoglobin lineage can be identified, including one gene as a candidate for being
expressed in notochord tissue. Genomic analyses identify conserved synteny between amphioxus globincontaining regions and the vertebrate b-globin locus, possibly arguing against a late transpositional origin of the
b-globin cluster in vertebrates. Some amphioxus globin gene structures exhibit minisatellite-like tandem
duplications of intron-exon boundaries ("mirages”), which may serve to explain the creation of novel intron
positions within the globin genes.
Conclusions: The identification of putative orthologs of vertebrate globin variants in the B. floridae genome
underlines the importance of cephalochordates for elucidating vertebrate genome evolution. The present study
facilitates detailed functional studies of the amphioxus globins in order to trace conserved properties and specific
adaptations of respiratory proteins at the base of chordate evolution.

Background
Globins are heme-containing proteins that bind O2 and
other gaseous ligands between the iron atom at the center of the porphyrin ring and a histidine residue of their
polypeptide chain [1]. In addition to supporting aerobic
metabolism of cells by providing O 2 supply, globins

fulfill a broad range of other functions, including O2
sensing, detoxification of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS), the generation of bioactive gas molecules
like NO and others [2]. Thus it is not surprising that
the versatile globins are found from bacteria to fungi,
protists, plants, and most animal groups [3].
The intensively studied hemoglobins (Hb) and myoglobins (Mb) are present in almost all vertebrate species,
being responsible for O2 transport and storage, but also
the production and elimination of NO [4,5]. Some years

ago, the vertebrate globin gene family was expanded by
the discovery of two additional globin types, neuroglobin
and cytoglobin [6-8]. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is preferentially
expressed in neurons and endocrine cells, and its
expression patterns suggest an association with oxidative
metabolism and the presence of mitochondria [9,10].
Cytoglobin (Cygb) is expressed in fibroblast-related cell
types and distinct neuronal cell populations [11,12]. The
exact physiological function(s) of both proteins are still
uncertain, and several, partially contradictory hypotheses
have been proposed, including functions in O2 supply,
ROS detoxification, signal transduction and inhibition of
apoptosis [13]. In the biomedical field, Ngb and Cygb
have created considerable interest because these proteins
appear to convey protection to cells and organs, e.g.
after ischemia/reperfusion injury of the brain [14-16].
Due to the high number of available sequences, globins have become a popular model for the investigation
of gene and gene family evolution [17]. In vertebrates,
there are multiple a-Hb and b-Hb genes, which form
distinct clusters. In birds and mammals, the a-Hb and
b-Hb gene loci are found on separate chromosomes,
while these loci are joined in fish and amphibians
[18-20]. Mb, Ngb and Cygb, however, are typically single
copy genes that are not associated with any other globin
locus. Molecular phylogenetic studies and genomic comparisons may permit more refined insights into the
function of Ngb and Cygb. Both of these proteins and
genes are subject to strong purifying selection in all vertebrates studied so far, suggesting an essential cellular
role [21,22]. Phylogenetic trees have shown that Ngb is
distantly related to nerve hemoglobins in invertebrate
worms, suggesting that its function is required in nerve
cells of prototomian and deuterostomian animals, which
diverged more than 600 million years ago [6]. Cygb,
however, is a paralog of the muscle-specific Mb and
may have been created by a duplication event only after
the separation of agnathan and gnathostomian vertebrates about 450 million years ago [7]. In addition to
the widespread Ngb and Cygb, some vertebrate lineages
possess specific additional globin variants of unknown
function, named globin × (GbX) in fish and frogs, globin
Y (GbY) in frogs, lizards, and monotreme mammals and
globin E (GbE) in birds [20,23-25]. To evaluate the
resulting scenarios of vertebrate globin evolution, and to
identify important, evolutionary conserved protein structure and ligand binding characteristics of human Ngb
and Cygb, it is mandatory to identify and study candidate globin orthologs in non-vertebrate taxa.
In the ‘new deuterostome phylogeny’ [26,27], urochordates (tunicates) appear to be the closest relatives to
vertebrates, while the cephalochordate amphioxus (lancelet), believed for a long time to be the vertebrate sister
taxon, now appears to be basal to the vertebrate/

tunicate clade. We have previously reported the globin
gene repertoire of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (sea
squirt), consisting of at least four globins, clustered in a
monophyletic clade. These genes are about equally distantly related to the vertebrate Ngb and GbX lineage, so
that no clear orthology could be established [23,28]. In
cephalochordates, the existence of a globin protein in
notochord cells and myotome tissue of Branchiostoma
californiense and B. floridae has been demonstrated by
biochemical studies [29]. This intracellular globin is a
dimer consisting of 19 kDa subunits with a high O2 affinity (P50 = 0.27 Torr, 15°C). Because of this high affinity
and the absence of cooperativity, a possible role of the
globins in facilitating diffusion of O2 into the notochord
cells was discussed [29]. However, recent publications
based on the genome sequence of B. floridae have
yielded no hint at the presence of globin genes in this
most basal chordate taxon [27,30]. To address this
shortcoming, here we report the genomic organization
of B. floridae globin genes (BflGb) and their evolutionary implications.

Methods
Database searches and sequence analyses

BLAST searches [31] were performed on whole genome
shotgun data from the NCBI trace archive [32] and the
Branchiostoma floridae genome project versions 1.0 and
2.0 at the JGI [33]. Searches of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) were performed using the B. floridae cDNA
resource [34,35] and the NCBI EST database [36].
Nucleotide sequences were extracted from databases,
assembled and translated using the DNAstar 5.08 program package (Lasergene).
Pairwise percentage sequence identities and similarities of proteins were calculated using the Matrix Global
Alignment Tool (MatGAT) version 2.0 [37] using a
PAM250 scoring matrix. Dotplots for detecting repeat
structures were made using zPicture [38]. Prediction of
subcellular localization of proteins was done by PSORT
II [39]. N-myristoylation sites were predicted by Myristoylater [40].
Molecular phylogeny

The conceptionally translated amino acid sequences of
the B. floridae globins were manually added to an alignment of selected globin sequences [6,7]. The sequences
used are Homo sapiens neuroglobin (HsaNGB [GenBank:AJ245946]), cytoglobin (HsaCYGB, [GenBank:
AJ315162]), myoglobin (HsaMB [GenBank:M14603]),
hemoglobin a (HsaHBA [GenBank:J00153]), and Hb b
(HsaHBB [GenBank:M36640]); Mus musculus Ngb
(MmuNgb [GenBank:AJ245946]), Cygb (MmuCygb
[GenBank:AJ315163]) and Mb (MmuMb [GenBank:
P04247]); Ornithorhynchus anatinus GbY (OanGbY

(MglHb3 [GenBank:AF184239]); Lampetra fluviatilis Hb
(LflHb [GenBank:P02207]); Medicago sativa leghemoglobin (MsaLegHb [GenBank:P09187]); Lupinus luteus
leghemoglobin (LluLegHb [GenBank:P02240]); Casuarina glauca Hb1 (CglHb1 [GenBank:P08054]). In our
deuterostome globin analysis, we refrained from inclusion of protostome globin sequences, because these tend
to behave polyphyletically in the tree (Additional File 1),
possibly due to long-branch attraction artifacts. Our
trees were therefore rooted by plant globin sequences.
Phylogenetic tree reconstructions were performed
using MrBayes version 3.1 [41,42] using the WAG
model of amino acid evolution [43] assuming a gamma
distribution of rates, as suggested by analysis of the
alignment with ProtTest version 1.2.7 [44]. Metropoliscoupled Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling was performed with one cold and three heated chains that were
run for up to 3,000,000 generations. Trees were sampled
every 10 th generation and ‘burn in’ was set to 9,000.
Maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis was
performed by RAxML version 7.2.3 [45] assuming the
WAG model and gamma distribution of substitution
rates. The resulting tree was tested by bootstrapping
with 100 replicates.
RT-PCR confirmation of B. floridae globin coding
sequences

Adult specimens of B. floridae were collected at Tampa
Bay, Florida, USA. Total RNA was isolated from whole
animals using the RNeasy Kit according to the supplier’s
instructions (Qiagen). To remove genomic DNA a
DNase I digestion step was included in the preparation.
Reverse transcription of 0.5 μg total RNA was performed using SUPERSCRIPT II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT) primer. Using one-tenth
of a cDNA reaction and 2 U Taq DNA polymerase
(Sigma) the complete or partial coding sequences of the
bioinformatically predicted globin genes were amplified
in a standard PCR protocol. Missing 5’ and 3’ regions
were obtained using the GeneRacer Kit with SUPERSCRIPT III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR

products were sequenced directly or were cloned into
the pGEM-Teasy vector system (Promega) and both
strands were sequenced by a commercial sequencing
service (StarSeq). Nucleotide sequences were deposited
in the database under the accession numbers listed in
Table 1.
Recombinant globin expression and characterization

Amphioxus globin variant BflGb4 coding sequence was
isolated by RT-PCR, cloned into prokaryotic expression
vector pET15b, verified by re-sequencing and ultimately
expressed and affinity-purified from E. coli BL21pLys
host cells by a Ni-NTA Superflow column (Qiagen). The
kinetics of ligand binding by the flash photolysis method
was measured to determine functional properties of the
BflGb4 globin. After photolysis of the CO form, the subsequent completion of rebinding of the CO and any
internal protein ligands provides information on the
association and dissociation rates. Samples of 10 μM protein, on a heme basis, were placed under a controlled
atmosphere of CO, oxygen or a mixture of both ligands,
and photolyzed with 10 ns pulses at 532 nm.

Results and Discussion
Identification and annotation of B. floridae globin genes

Systematic TBlastN searches were carried out on the
database of the B. floridae genome project versions 1.0
and 2.0 at the JGI [27] and the Branchiostoma cDNA
resource [34] and complemented with the data of the
whole genome shotgun sequences at the NCBI trace
archive. Using vertebrate Ngb and Cygb sequences as
query, fifteen distinct bona fide globin genes were identified in Branchiostoma genome v. 2.0, which reports a
single haplotype at each locus [27] (Figure 1 Table 1).
This is substantially more than the four gene copies
identified in the tunicate C. intestinalis [28] but less
than the largest globin gene families known from invertebrates (C. elegans: 33 genes [46]; Chironomus midges:
30-40 genes [47]). The reason for the higher globin gene
copy number in Branchiostoma vs. Ciona is unknown. It
may reflect differences in life-style (sand-burrowing vs.
sessile) and/or the threefold higher genome size in
amphioxus compared to the tunicate, which is thought
to have undergone substantial gene loss [27]. Eight of
the 15 gene models annotated in the database required
extensive changes, which were performed by visual
inspection of DNA sequencing traces, comparative
amino acid sequence alignments and after cDNA verification by RT-PCR. One additional gene model (BRAFL
DRAFT_81713) contains 86 amino acids of globinrelated sequence embedded in a large protein of 1323
residues, annotated to be a calpain-like protease. We do
not include this aberrant structure in the present analysis of bona fide globins.

Gene models, corresponding haplotypes, identities and similarities of haplotype proteins, nucleotide evolution rates of haplotypes, evidence for gene expression
by ESTs and accession numbers of cDNA sequences are listed.

Due to the still highly fragmented nature of the Branchiostoma genome draft, the picture of genomic organization of globin genes is currently incomplete. Only
eight out of 15 gene copies co-localize to the same scaffold, with four globins being located on genomic scaffold 39 (BflGb1, BflGb2, BflGb8 and BflGb15). Here,
BflGb1 and BflGb2 are situated in head-to-tail orientation only 2.3 kb apart from each other, and their amino
acid similarity (83%; Additional file 2) may suggest their
origin by a relatively recent gene duplication. The distance between BflGb2 and BflGb8 is 276 kb, between
BflGb8 and BflGb15 even more than 4 Mbp, showing
that amphioxus globin genes are widely disseminated
instead of featuring the vertebrate-typical dense clustering. Genes BflGb5 and BflGb9 reside in head-to-head
orientation separated by 40 kbp on scaffold 132 of the
genome draft. This annotation is inconsistent with data
of the trace archive, showing a head-to-tail orientation
indicated by paired-end read information. BflGb6 and
BflGb12 reside on scaffold 89 at a distance of 8 Mbp.
All other seven globin genes are located on individual
genomic scaffolds (Figure 1).
Protein sequence comparisons and allelic differences

The lengths of the deduced Branchiostoma globin
sequences (Figure 2) range from 138 amino acids
(BflGb11), which is consistent with the average length
of the globin fold of 140-150 amino acids, to 236 residues (BflGb14). Such elongations, observed in 11 of
the 15 amphioxus globins, result from N-and Cterminal extensions of the globin fold. The functional
relevance of these extensions, previously reported e.g.
for vertebrate Cygb [7] and nematode globins [46], is
unclear. However, computer predictions using the

PSORT II program [39] indicate that none of the
amphioxus globins appears to contain a leader signal
peptide, and all variants are predicted to be located in
the cytoplasm. Notably, eight Branchiostoma globins
(BflGb1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14), five of which are phylogenetically related to vertebrate GbX (see below), possess a predicted N-myristoylation site. This may
suggest an at least transient interaction with the cell
membrane, thereby precluding an oxygen-supply function of these globins.
The comparison of the conceptionally translated
amino acid sequences of B. floridae globins with human
Ngb, Cygb and Mb shows the conservation of the typical functional residues of globins [1] in most of the
amphioxus proteins, such as the distal histidine (amino
acid position E7), the proximal histidine (F8) and the
phenylalanine at CD1 (Figure 2). While the proximal
histidine, which coordinates the heme iron atom, is conserved in all 15 putative globins, the distal histidine is
replaced by leucine in BflGb6, 12 and 13. The same
replacement was previously reported in globins of Glycera dibranchiata [48] and in nematodes [49,50]. It creates an unusually hydrophobic ligand-binding site and
may reduce affinity for polar ligands like O2 [51]. The
same Branchiostoma globin variants also show a change
at amino acid position CD1 from phenylalanine to tryptophan, and BflGb3 displays an exchange of this residue
by a tyrosine. Position CD1 (Phe) is even more conserved during globin evolution than the distal histidine.
In human Hb, substitutions of CD1 (Phe) to nonaromatic amino acids usually lead to unstable globins
and oxygenation problems [1]. The functional consequences of the more conservative CD1 changes in
amphioxus variants, however, are unclear.

Figure 1 Genomic organization of B. floridae globin (Gb) gene variants. Only the haplotypes represented in genome assembly v.2.0 are
shown and the genomic scaffolds are indicated. Exons are represented by grey boxes, connected by lines indicating mRNA splicing. Exon and
intron sizes and distances between linked genes are indicated by numbers (in bp). Intron positions (bold letters) are given with reference to the
globin helical structure (e.g. intron E8.1 is located between codon positions 1 and 2 of amino acid residue 8 in helix E).

Pair-wise comparisons of the Branchiostoma globins
display a substantial degree of divergence between the
fifteen proteins. The most distant variants display a
sequence identity of only 12% (BflGb11 and BflGb12)
and a similarity of 31% (BflGb11 and BflGb14). As such,
they are as distinct as vertebrate Mb and Cygb, which
have separated before radiation of gnathostomes [21].
The most similar amphioxus paralogs (BflGb1 and
BflGb2) have 60% sequence identity and 83% similarity
(Additional file 2).

Possibly due to a large effective population size,
B. floridae is highly heterozygous, and the genome
sequencing of one specimen has revealed two haplotypes
for two-thirds of the approximately 15,000 protein-coding loci [27]. We have identified allelic copies for 11 of
the 15 globin variants (Table 1). Amino acid similarities/identities between alleles are high, ranging from 97/
95% to 100%. Taking into account these interallelic

15 globin gene variants in amphioxus can be considered

molecular mass of 15 kDa and thus may not represent
the major 19 kDa notochord globin fraction, as isolated
biochemically by Bishop et al. [29]. Several other globin
variants (e.g. BflGb5, 8, 9) have predicted molecular
masses between 18 and 21 kDa.

Evidence for globin gene expression

EST data provide evidence of transcription only for five
Branchiostoma globin genes (BflGb5, BflGb7, BflGb9,
BflGb10 and BflGb11; see Table 1). Represented by
17 EST entries, BflGb11 may be the most strongly
expressed globin in whole adult animals. Based on the
EST data and in silico-predictions, the coding regions of
the fifteen genes were amplified by RT-PCR and completed by 5’ and 3’ RACE. Amplicons were cloned and
sequenced for verification (Table 1). Together, these
data demonstrate transcriptional expression of all Branchiostoma globin genes. Of special interest is the assignment of EST entry AU234573, representing BflGb11, to
notochord tissue, as this facilitates further studies of the
amphioxus globin components, which possibly serve to
supply O2 to sustain the contractile function of notochord cells [29]. BflGb11, however, has a predicted

Identification of putative Branchiostoma orthologs to
vertebrate globins

The amino acid sequences of the 15 globin genes of
Branchiostoma were included in an alignment of
selected vertebrate and invertebrate globins [6,7,28].
Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction revealed possible orthology relationships
between amphioxus and vertebrate globins (Figure 3).
Most importantly, BflGb4 forms a common clade with
vertebrate Ngb. These two globins show 27%/49%
identity/similarity. Corroborating evidence for orthology
was obtained by inspecting the organization at the
genomic level. Within vertebrates, the gene region containing Ngb is strongly conserved in gene order and
arrangement [20,22]. The human NGB gene resides on
chromosome HSA14q24.3 between the genes for

protein-O-mannosyltransferase 2 (POMT2) and transmembrane protein 63C (TMEM63C, previously termed
DKFZp434P0111) [22]. While a TMEM63C ortholog
was not detectable on genomic scaffold 245 containing
BflGb4, the amphioxus orthologs of POMT2 and glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1), located on the distal, telomeric side of the human NGB gene, reside in
close proximity to the BflGb4 gene (Figure 4). These
findings are in agreement with Putnam et al. [27], who
reported extensive micro-syntenic conservation of gene
arrangement between amphioxus and humans on the
whole-genome level. Together with the phylogeny, the
data are convincing evidence that we have identified an
ortholog of vertebrate Ngb in a basal chordate.
Phylogenetical interpretation of the tree reconstruction (Figure 3) further suggests that the monophyletic
clade comprising BflGb3, BflGb6, BflGb12, BflGb13 and
BflGb14 contains the putative orthologs of vertebrate
GbX, a distant relative of the Ngb lineage, which is
found only in fish and frogs, but not in birds and mammals [20,23]. This corroborates the scenario that GbX
was already present in early chordates, but has been lost
secondarily during tetrapod evolution. Syntenic conservation of GbX flanking genes in Xenopus tropicalis and
Tetraodon nigroviridis is restricted to three proximate
genes encoding a pleckstrin domain containing protein
(PLEKHG), phospholipase and signal recognition particle SRP12 [20]. Notably the genome of B. floridae
revealed the linkage of a PLEKHG gene to BflGb3, substantiating the assumption of a possible GbX orthology
(Additional file 3).
Another amphioxus globin clade comprising BflGb1,
BflGb2, BflGb5 and BflGb9 is paralogous to all other
vertebrate globins (Hb, Mb, Cygb). This clade also
groups with the four monophyletic globin variants from
the genome of the tunicate C. intestinalis [28], which
confirms our view that the C. intestinalis globins are
not 1:1 orthologous to vertebrate globins.
A third monophyletic group of amphioxus globin
variants, comprising BflGb7, BflGb10, BflGb11 and
BflGb15, joins the vertebrate Mb-Hb-Cygb-GbE-GbY
lineage in the tree. It is noteworthy that this clade of
amphioxus globins contains BflGb11, which may be
expressed in notochord tissue, possibly serving the
Mb-like role in O2 supply suggested by Bishop et al. [29].
Unfortunately, analysis of syntenic gene relationships of
the Mb, Cygb and Hb loci [19,22,52] did not generate
further positive evidence for 1:1 gene orthology between
amphioxus and vertebrate globins, possibly due to the
fragmentary nature of the draft genome assembly. The
absence of clear Cygb, Mb, Hb and GbE/Y orthologues in
Branchiostoma may confirm that the gene duplications,
which gave rise to these diverse vertebrate globin types,
indeed happened after the split of cephalochordates and

the vertebrate ancestor [7]. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic predictions will facilitate guided functional comparisons of cephalochordate and vertebrate globins.
Implications for the evolution of the ancestral vertebrate
globin gene cluster

According to the current model of vertebrate globin
evolution, the mammalian a-Hbs constitute the ancestral vertebrate globin gene locus, while the b-cluster is
the result of a transposition of globin genes into a
region containing olfactory receptor (OR) genes [24,52].
Looking deeper into the evolutionary past, Wetten et al.
[53] suggested a common origin of the vertebrate a-Hb
locus and two globin gene-containing regions in the C.
intestinalis genome, as evidenced by the syntenic relationships of three globin-flanking genes. However, these
genes do not show linkage to globins in the amphioxus
genome. Wetten et al. [53] therefore proposed that they
were secondarily linked to globin genes by a fusion of
conserved genomic linkage groups (CLGs 3, 15 and 17)
[27] to produce the ancestor of the vertebrate a-Hb
locus before the divergence of urochordates and vertebrates. Our own analyses of gene synteny, however, do
not provide support for this model, since we could not
detect any of the B. floridae globin genes within the
respective CLGs. Instead, we find that Branchiostoma
globins BflGb5 and 9 reside on the same genomic scaffold as the amphioxus orthologue of integrin-linked
kinase (ILK), a conserved flanking gene of the b-Hb
cluster in men, chicken and marsupials [24].
Additionally, a detailed inspection of the CLG’s architecture [27] reveals that the amphioxus genomic scaffold
including BflGb1, 2, 8 and 15 corresponds to human
chromosomal region 11p15.4-15.5, the location of the
b-Hb cluster in man. Of course, this hypothetical
ancient orthology is at odds with the transpositional
model for a more recent origin of the b-Hb locus during
vertebrate evolution (the olfactory receptor genes are
dispersed in amphioxus [54], and thus cannot help to
clarify the evolutionary events). Clearly, a reliable reconstruction of the pre-vertebrate globin loci will require
the analysis of additional deuterostome genomes.
Kinetics of ligand binding of the putative Ngb
ortholog, BflGb4

The ligand binding kinetics of recombinantly expressed
BflGb4 after CO photodissociation is biphasic (Figure 5),
as previously observed for Ngb and Cygb [55,56]. The
rapid phase is the competitive binding of CO and the
internal ligand (considered to be the distal E7 histidine
of the globin fold), and can be simulated by a bimolecular reaction with CO and a fixed rate of 4000/s for the
protein ligand. From the slow phase, a rate for histidine
dissociation of 2/s was extracted. This indicates that

BflGb4 globin, like its vertebrate ortholog Ngb [55,57], is
a hexacoordinated globin, which adopts a His-Fe-His
coordination in the absence of external ligands. The
hexacoordination of the heme Fe atom in BflGb4 underlines the view that this binding scheme represents an
ancestral feature of animal and plant globins, from

Figure 5 Ligand binding kinetics of recombinantly expressed
BflGb4. After photodissociation of CO, the kinetics of ligand
rebinding are biphasic, as previously observed for other
hexacoordinated globins such as vertebrate Ngb. During the rapid
μs phase, CO and the internal ligand (His) compete for the binding
to the transient pentacoordinated heme. For the fraction that binds
His, there is a slow replacement of His to CO to return to the
original stable form. Measurements at different CO concentrations
(and several detection wavelengths-not shown) allow a
determination of the association rate for both ligands and the
dissociation rate of His. The deltaAN on the Y-axis represents the
normalized change in absorbance.

which penta-coordinated globins like Hb and Mb
evolved [58]. The exact adaptive value of hexacoordination is still unclear. However, it may confer some unusual thermal and acidosis stability to the globin fold
[59,60], which could be relevant under environmental or
cellular stress.
The CO and O2 ligand association rates of BflGb4 are
quite high (as for Ngb, but not Cygb; [61]), which places
the amphioxus globin with Ngb in terms of ligand binding kinetics. The overall oxygen affinity of BflGb4 (oxygen half-saturation value P50 of 3 Torr at 25°C) is about
twice that for human NGB (without the disulfide bond
[61]), due to a higher intrinsic O 2 affinity. However,
values are close enough to suggest similar functional
roles of the orthologous proteins. In contrast to human
NGB, BflGb4 apparently lacks internal cysteine residues,
which have been hypothesized to modulate oxygen affinity depending on the cellular redox state [61]. Note
that the oxygen affinity for BflGb4 is intermediate to the
two allosteric states of human NGB, and there is preliminary evidence in the kinetics of BflGb4 of an additional conformational state. Clearly, further detailed
comparisons are needed to extract conserved and taxonspecific features of these globins.
Globin intron evolution and the presence of minisatellites
in amphioxus globin genes

The ancestry and conservation of globins has stimulated
studies to trace the evolutionary behavior of introns in
these genes, aiming at contributing to the long-standing
introns-early versus introns-late debate [18,62-64]. Two
introns at positions B12.2 (i. e. between codon positions
2 and 3 of the 12th amino acid of globin helix B) and
G7.0 are conserved in all vertebrate globins, in many
invertebrate and even plant globin genes. They are
therefore thought to have already existed in the globin

shifts [23,67]. An intron loss scenario would require
many such independent events on several branches of
the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). Therefore, the most
parsimonious explanation is that the divergent central
intron positions in globin genes in amphioxus and other
taxa are due to convergent intron gain. This is corroborated by the lack of a central intron in BflGb4, the
amphioxus ortholog of vertebrate Ngb. Intron gain may
also be responsible for the presence of introns at the
unprecedented positions HC13.2 (between H-helix and
C-terminus) in amphioxus globin gene variants BflGb1,
2 and 5 and intron position NA17.2 (between N-terminus and A helix) in gene BflGb13 (Figure 1).
Detailed annotation of the genomic organization of
amphioxus globin genes revealed conspicuous structures, which are interesting with respect to intron evolution. In gene BflGb6 we observed minisatellite-like
tandem duplications, comprising the 3’ end of the B12.2
intron and the 5’ part of exon 2, while BflGb9 contains
a duplicate of the 3’ boundary of exon 2 (Figure 6).

gene ancestor [65]. Both these intron positions can also
be found conserved in all 15 amphioxus globin genes
(Figure 1, 2). In addition to the strictly conserved B12.2
and G7.0 introns, there are introns at slightly differing
positions of the globin E-helix ("central introns”) present
in globin genes of diverse taxa (vertebrates, invertebrates
and plants), which raised speculations on the presence
of such a central intron already in the globin ancestor
[18,62]. Subsequent findings of different E-helix introns
in globin genes of closely related insect species casted
doubt on this view and argued for an intron gain scenario [64]. Interestingly, the amphioxus globin genes
reveal four different intron positions within the E-helix
(E8.1, E11.0, E18.0, E20.1; Figure 1 and 2), of which only
positions E11.0 (in vertebrate Ngb; [6]) and E18.0 (in
nematode globins; [46,66]) have been reported before.
This situation can in principle be explained by a positional shift of ancestral introns (= “intron sliding”),
intron loss or insertional intron gain. Intron sliding,
however, is thought to explain only very small intron

Such tandem repeats spanning an exon-intron boundary
have previously been reported in the alcohol dehydrogenase 3 (Adh3) gene of B. floridae and B. lanceolatum
and have been termed “mirages” [68]. Other gene loci
with similar structures have been reported in amphioxus
[69,70], possibly making this a more general phenomenon in cephalochordates. The genomic mechanism of
generation of these minisatellites is unclear, and repeat
units vary in length (BflGb6: 150-160 bp, BflGb9: 157
bp; Adh3: 10-72 bp, [67]). The Adh3 data as well as our
globin RT-PCR results suggest that mirage structures do
not interfere with regular splicing of the mRNA,
although many, but not all of the tandem repeats contain AG/GT splice signals (for the BflGb6 example, see
Figure 6 and Additional file 4) which could be used as
cryptic splice sites producing alternative (and possibly
aberrant) transcripts. Like other minisatellites, mirage
clusters display length instability, possibly due to
unequal or intra-strand crossing-overs, and even somatic
instability has been detected at the Adh3 locus [68]. For
haplotypes 1 and 2 of BflGb6, we have observed 6 and 3
repeat units, respectively (Figure 6; no second haplotype
was found for BflGb9). The repeat units of BflGb6 display between 81 and 100% nucleotide sequence identity
(Additional file 5). Reconstruction of cluster evolution
by phylogenetic trees (Additional file 6) reveals typical
features of tandem repeat turnover [71], namely concerted evolution within clusters (units D1/D2 of

E1

haplotype 2 and D3/D4/D5 of haplotype 1) and exclusion of cluster boundaries (D6/haplotype 1 and D3/haplotype 2) from such intra-allelic homogenization.
With respect to the evolution of introns, mirage
repeats immediately offer a suggestive model to explain
intron gain within the globin genes over evolutionary
times (Figure 7). An exonic part of a repeat unit (e.g.
D3) may secondarily turn into a real exon, if its boundary cryptic splice signals are being used. If a suitably
positioned splice acceptor site is already present or created by mutation within the original exon 2, the mirage
repeats in between will become intronic. In support of
this model, we recognize degenerate tandem repeats
within the hypothetically gained intron E8.1 of BflGb13
(Additional file 7). The general idea of intron gain by
duplication events encompassing AG/GT proto-splice
sites was originally introduced by Rogers [72] and has
received renewed interest by studies of intron evolution
in ray-finned fishes [73] and mammals [74]. Recently,
the systematic examination of six fully sequenced model
organism genomes including humans, mouse and Drosophila has emphasized the importance of internal gene
duplications as a mechanism for intron generation [75].

globin variants Ngb, GbX and the Mb/Cygb/Hb lineage

novel splicing events are shown by dashed lines. The model predicts that newly generated introns contain mirage-derived repeats, which
however may degenerate by mutation.

value of cephalochordates as a reference taxon for vertebrate evolution. Although the urochordate lineage may
be overall more closely related to vertebrates, the tunicate (C. intestinalis) does not appear to harbour any 1:1
orthologs of vertebrate globin genes [28]. The present
study facilitates detailed functional studies of the
amphioxus globins in order to trace conserved properties and specific adaptations of respiratory proteins at
the base of chordate evolution.
