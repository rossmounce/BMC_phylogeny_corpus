Abstract
Background: Helicoverpa armigera and H. zea are amongst the most significant polyphagous pest
lepidopteran species in the Old and New Worlds respectively. Separation of H. armigera and H. zea
is difficult and is usually only achieved through morphological differences in the genitalia. They are
capable of interbreeding to produce fertile offspring. The single species status of H. armigera has
been doubted, due to its wide distribution and plant host range across the Old World. This study
explores the global genetic diversity of H. armigera and its evolutionary relationship to H zea.
Results: We obtained partial (511 bp) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Cytochrome Oxidase-I
(COI) sequences for 249 individuals of H. armigera sampled from Australia, Burkina Faso, Uganda,
China, India and Pakistan which were associated with various host plants. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) within the partial COI gene differentiated H. armigera populations into 33
mtDNA haplotypes. Shared haplotypes between continents, low F-statistic values and low
nucleotide diversity between countries (0.0017 – 0.0038) suggests high mobility in this pest.
Phylogenetic analysis of four major Helicoverpa pest species indicates that H. punctigera is basal to
H. assulta, which is in turn basal to H. armigera and H. zea. Samples from North and South America
suggest that H. zea is also a single species across its distribution. Our data reveal short genetic
distances between H. armigera and H. zea which seem to have been established via a founder event
from H. armigera stock at around 1.5 million years ago.
Conclusion: Our mitochondrial DNA sequence data supports the single species status of H.
armigera across Africa, Asia and Australia. The evidence for inter-continental gene flow observed
in this study is consistent with published evidence of the capacity of this species to migrate over
long distances. The finding of high genetic similarity between Old World H. armigera and New
World H. zea emphasises the need to consider work on both pests when building pest management
strategies for either.

Background
The genus Helicoverpa (Hardwick 1965) is a group of 18
species [1] which includes some of the most devastating
agricultural lepidopteran pest species, with H. armigera
(Hübner) and H. zea (Boddie) being the dominant pest
species in the Old World and New World respectively. A
few other species in the genus Helicoverpa are pests of a
range of crops but they are either limited in host plant
range or are geographically restricted [1]. This includes H.
assulta (Guenée) which feeds only on Solanaceae, and is
endemic to Asia, Africa and Australia [2], and H. punctigera (Wallengren) which is polyphagous and endemic to
Australia [3]. The majority of Helicoverpa species are oligophagous and are not considered as major agricultural
pests.
Until the work of Hardwick [4]H. zea and H. armigera
were considered conspecific [5] within the genus Heliothis
Oschenheimer [6] as Heliothis armigera. Hardwick [4]
incorporated results from extensive morphological, rearing and hybridization studies, arranged these moths into
a postulated evolutionary sequence of species groups, and
at the same time resolved the taxonomic position of H.
armigera and H. zea as separate species within the new
Helicoverpa genus, Matthews [2] confirmed the criteria
used by Hardwick [4] for the Helicoverpa genus, developing methods to inflate the helical bladder-like appendages
in this genus. Morphological characters and allozymebased phylogeny suggested that H. punctigera is basal to H.
assulta [1]. The evolutionary relationship between H.
armigera and H. zea was uncertain and they were considered monophyletic, sharing a common ancestor with H.
assulta [1]. Allozyme studies revealed similarly large heterozygosities in H. armigera and H. punctigera but with H.
zea displaying 61% less mean heterozygosity, and Mallet
et al. [7] suggested that H. zea evolved from a small founding population of H. armigera (or of their joint common
ancestor). Accurate demarcation of species boundaries
and their distributions is essential for understanding pest
demography. Apart from the work of Matthews [2] which
was confined to Australia, there is a lack of firm systematic
foundation in this genus and specifically that of important Helicoverpa pest species such as H. armigera and H.
zea. This represents a significant handicap for basic and
applied research into these two important pest species.
Larvae of H. armigera and H. zea are highly polyphagous.
They possess the ability to enter diapause as pupae and are
known to develop high levels of insecticide resistance [811]. Adult moths also demonstrate high mobility (capable of travelling over 1,000 km) and fecundity (individual
females are capable of laying up to 3,000 eggs) [3]. Population genetic studies of H. armigera have been conducted
in different regions of the world using different genetic
marker systems [12-18]. Varying results from these studies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/117

reflect interactions between different agricultural practices
and the life history of the pest species, and the nature of
the different genetic marker systems applied. In Australia,
studies based on isozymes [12], mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) control region [13] and the sodium channel
gene [14] suggest large effective population size in H.
armigera. However, microsatellite studies of Australian H.
armigera populations suggested monthly genetic shifts,
highly variable gene flow between populations between
years, and limited moth movements which varied
between and within seasons [15,16]. Results from these
microsatellite DNA studies contrast with studies carried
out in eastern Mediterranean populations using random
amplified polymorphic DNA [17], and in African and
European samples using isozymes [18]. These studies
found little genetic variation between widely separated
populations, supporting the idea that extensive long distance migration occurred in H. armigera. Low genetic differentiation in the related long-range migratory pest
Heliothis virescens across the cotton belt within the United
States of America has also been reported [19].
Despite intense agricultural interest in H. armigera as a
polyphagous pest, very little systematic research has been
conducted to resolve the question of the existence of subspecies at the local or global level. Based on taxonomic
data, Paterson [20] raised doubts as to whether H. armigera constituted a single genetic species or formed a complex of cryptic species over its geographic range. Although
the existence of cryptic H. armigera species has not been
disproved, mating experiments that involved H. armigera
from different regions of the Old World strongly supported its single species status [21]. In India, various
reports suggested that H. armigera could be categorized
into races, based on their host-feeding preferences, and
that these races do not interbreed freely [22,23]. Kranthi
et al. [24] reported variable metabolic mechanisms mediating pyrethroid resistance, with the shift from MFOmediated pyrethroid resistance to an esterase-mediated
mechanism during mid October in central India, which
might have been related to different H. armigera populations being sampled at these times from different crops.
Differential responses of H. armigera populations to pheromone [25] and parasitoids [26] were also reported in
India. It has been suggested that independent evolution of
lineages may be demarcated by food plant differentiation,
facilitating the development of host races or host differentiated species [27,28]. "Cotton" and "non cotton" field
races of H. armigera have also been generated through laboratory selection of field-collected insects on cotton fruit
buds (squares). These races were characterized by differing (though overlapping) cornutal spine number on the
male aedeagus [29].

To date, no molecular studies have assessed phylogeographic patterns among worldwide populations of H.
armigera. Analysis of mtDNA has provided valuable
insights into understanding natural genetic diversity and
population structures in other organisms [30]. It is clear
that both demographic and bio-geographic forces shape
the depth and distribution of lineages in a phylogenetic
tree, while selecting the correct loci in constructing a phylogeny is of equal importance due to differing evolutionary rates among different DNA regions, and within and
between different loci (eg, nuclear versus mtDNA loci).
For example, interpreting mtDNA phylogeny should proceed with caution because this locus is highly prone to
selective sweeps due to its single locus nature and the general lack of recombination. Furthermore, inherited symbionts such as Wolbachia and other bacteria may also cause
maternal cytotype sweeps [31]. Nevertheless, the mtDNA
genes, especially that of the Cytochrome Oxidase sub-unit
I (COI) gene have been used extensively in phylogenetic
studies due to the ease of primer design and its range of
phylogenetic signal. The rate of evolution in this gene is
also sufficiently rapid to allow the discrimination at the
species level and the identification of cryptic species [32],
and has been used in establishing host plant associated
genetic differentiation [33]. This study therefore aims to
provide the first broad scale screening of mtDNA variation
in H. armigera globally. The genetic information collected
is used to address the questions of single species status
and of host races, and to infer phylogenetic relationships
amongst the four pest Helicoverpa species.

in H. armigera and H. zea. The mtDNA region from nucleotide position 512 to 809 was therefore excluded in analyses of all remaining samples.
PCR amplification of the informative partial mtDNA COI
fragments for all individuals of H. armigera, H. zea, H.
punctigera, H. assulta and Heliothis virescens gave PCR products of the expected size. A final 511 base pair (bp)
sequence (nucleotide position 1 to 511) was analysed, following trimming of invalid end sequences and sequence
alignment. The COI sequences showed no ambiguity and
no premature stop codons. A total of 32 SNPs were identified from the 511 bp partial COI region in 249 H. armigera samples resulting in 33 mtDNA haplotypes. A total of
29 synonymous and 3 non-synonymous substitutions
were detected in these partial COI sequences. Multiple
amino acid sequence alignments revealed that the three
non-synonymous changes are in haplotype Harm-11
(Glycine to Serine); Harm-13 (Isoleucine to Phenylalaine) and Harm-26 (Tyrosine to Cysteine). Amino acid
substitutions in Harm-13 and Harm-26 resulted in the
replacement of one hydrophobic amino acid with
another, while in Harm-11 the amino acid substitution
occurred between hydrophobic and polar groups. Of the

Results
PCR amplification and sequence analysis
Preliminary population sequence survey of 809 bp
mtDNA region (see Methods) indicated the partial COI
gene at nucleotide positions 1 to 511 as being the most
informative region for our H. armigera and H. zea population study. The 62 randomly sampled H. armigera and 11
H. zea haplotype representative samples all possessed
identical tRNA-Leu gene sequence to the deposited H.
armigera tRNA-Leu sequence (DQ059302). In the 62 H.
armigera samples, two transitional mutations (G/A and C/
T) were detected. The G/A mutation involved one individual each from Burkina Faso and Pakistan that belonged to
the same mtDNA haplotype (Harm1). The C/T base
change involved an Australian (previously Harm2) and a
Pakistan (previously Harm3) sample. There were four C/T
transitional mutations from nucleotide positions 512 to
809 between the 11 H. zea and the 62 H. armigera samples. These four mutations increased the number of steps
by one between haplotype Hzea-1 and Hzea-7, and the
number of steps by three in the haplotype network
between H. armigera and H. zea (Fig 1). All transitional
mutations between nucleotide 512 to 809 were parsimoniously uninformative at the intra- and inter-species levels

32 variable sites identified, 15 sites were parsimony
informative and 17 were non-informative.
Haplotypes
The most prevalent haplotype found in all countries was
designated Harm-1. Harm-4, found in Uganda and Australia, was the most diverged haplotype with seven mutation steps from the major haplotype Harm-1 (Fig. 1).
Haplotypes Harm-1, 2, 3 and 10 formed the major haplotypes commonly found in all countries except Uganda
(Harm-10) and Pakistan (Harm-2, 3 and 10) (Table 1).
The frequencies of unique haplotypes were comparatively
low within individual countries (Table 2). The haplotype
network revealed no major groupings of H. armigera haplotypes according to either host plants or geographical
clade (Fig. 1 and Table 1). A total of 11 haplotypes were
identified from 64 H. zea individuals sampled from
Northern (North Carolina and New York) and South
America (Brazil). Haplotypes Hzea-1, 2, 6 and 7 were
found in both North and South American continents,
while the remaining haplotypes were unique to either the
North or South American populations. The H. zea haplotype network is most parsimoniously linked to the H.
armigera clade through Harm-14 found in Burkina Faso

(Fig. 1). All mtDNA COI haplotypes identified in this
study have been deposited in GenBank (EF116226EF116274).
F-statistics (Fst) and Analysis of Molecular Variance
(AMOVA)
Because of the generally small sample sizes in the individual collections from the Indian sub-continent, populations were grouped as Central (Nagpur, Yavatmal and
Hingoli), North (Abohar, Bhatinda, Mansa and Pakistan)
and South (Prakasam, Karimnagar, Warangal and Coimbatore) in F-statistics analysis which showed significant
gene flow between these three regions (Fst = 0.07). Analysis of Molecular Variance detected no genetic structure at
various hierarchical levels (Table 3), with 96.88% of variation accounted for at the within population (ie, within
country) level, with only 2.15% variation observed
among groups (ie, Asian, African and Australian continents). Pairwise Fst values (when considering individual
countries as separate populations) were low in the study
samples, and ranged from approximately 0 to 0.06. The
observed nucleotide diversity between countries was also
very low and ranged from 0.0017 – 0.0039 (Table 4).

Phylogenetic inference and genetic distance
The HKY + G [34] model was selected by MODELTEST
version 3.7. Model parameters estimated were based on
empirical base frequencies (A = 0.3064, C = 0.1441, G =
0.1016, T = 0.4479) with no proportion of invariable
sites, and a 0.0142 gamma distribution shape. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree from partial COI sequence was
sufficiently resolved between species based on the criteria
of Huelsenbeck and Hillis [35], with all nodes being supported by bootstrap values of greater than 70% (Fig. 2).
The range of genetic distances of H. armigera within Africa
(Burkina Faso and Uganda) was 0.0 – 0.02, within Australia 0.0 – 0.018, and within Asia (China, India and Pakistan) was 0 – 0.014. Genetic distances between the three
continents ranged from 0.0 – 0.02. Genetic distances
between all four species of the genus Helicoverpa and Heliothis virescens were also estimated (Table 5). The pairwise
genetic distance between H. armigera and H. zea ranged
from 0.031 to 0.047, and was intermediate between the
intra- and inter-specific genetic distances in these heliothine moth species.

Discussion
This study presents results from the informative region of
the COI partial gene in H. armigera and H. zea sampled
from five different continents. Preliminary study involving a total of 73 H. armigera and H. zea found no length
polymorphisms or SNPs in the tRNA-Leu gene. Furthermore, H. assulta and H. punctigera also possessed identical
tRNA-Leu length as that of H. armigera and H. zea. Various

studies have reported the presence of INDELs at this
region from insect groups such as in the honeybees Apis
mellifera [36] and between closely related butterfly species
of Heliconius genus [37] and Papilio genus [38].
The mtDNA COI haplotype network and estimates of Fstatistics based on the 511 bp informative region strongly
suggest that the H. armigera mtDNA from 249 samples
forms a homogeneous group of haplotypes, as expected if
they consist of a single species across the portion of the
geographical range sampled here. Our mtDNA COI phylogeny also revealed that all H. armigera haplotypes were
grouped as one clade and that the long branch length of
H. zea nested within the H. armigera clade (Figure. 2) possibly suggests a historical founder event from H. armigera.
The relatively low haplotype diversity identified in H. zea
directly reflected the limited number of specimens and
populations available for this species in this study. Low
genetic variation in the partial COI sequences was
detected in H. armigera, with haplotypes Harm-1, 2, 3 and
10 making up 80 percent of genetic variation observed.
Generally, the pattern of genetic variation seen at the partial COI region of H. armigera is continuous and consistent between regions; that is, each haplotype, when present
in two or more individuals, has a wide geographic distribution. Such a pattern is common in organisms capable of
long-range movement [39]. Our mtDNA COI partial
sequence data therefore supports the occurrence of long
distance gene flow in this pest species, which is further
supported by the low Fst values and low among-group
haplotype variance across all three continents. Migration
in H. armigera may not necessarily occur only as single or
multiple long-distant flights, but may also involve
human-aided movements of agriculture commodities
between continents. The maximum genetic distance
within Asian countries (India, China and Pakistan) is
0.014 as compared to within both the African (0.020) and
Australia (0.018) continents. The isozyme study of Australian H. armigera populations sampled across a 3,000
km study area by Daly and Gregg [12] also reported very
little genetic variation (Fst = 0.012). Non-significant isozyme allele frequency differences were also found
between populations of H. armigera located on either side

of the Sahara desert, thereby suggesting that geographical
barriers such as the Sahara desert have not prevented long
distant migration in H. armigera [18]. Long distant migration in H. armigera has been further suggested by the trapping of adult moths on Ascension Island, 2,000 km from
the African coast [40] and Willis Island in the Coral Sea,
450 km off the coast of Queensland, Australia [12]. That
H. armigera constitutes a single species across its distribution range with demonstrated long distance migration
ability is further supported by the intercontinental crossing experiments of Colvin et al. [21], whereby mating
between H. armigera from the African, Asian and Australian continents did not lead to a reduction in fecundity or
offspring viability.
The mtDNA COI haplotype network (haplotype clustering patterns) and phylogenetic analysis failed to revealed
specific host affiliations, both within Indian populations
of H. armigera and across the Old World. Genetic studies
of generalist phytophagous insects often reveal complexes
of genetically differentiated host races or cryptic species,
but the extent of genetic difference correlated with host
plant association in the H. armigera samples available in
our study is inconclusive both at the global level and more
specifically within the Indian populations due to small
sample sizes. Bhattacherjee [22] reported that Indian H.
armigera showed variability in host preferences,
responded differentially to parasitoid attacks [26] and
when exposed to pheromone blends [25], suggesting the
presence of sub-species or races. However, Jadhav et al.
[41] failed to confirm the presence of sub-species in H.

armigera based on a survey of male internal morphological characters and their association with hosts. Laboratory
experiments of Kranthi et al. [29] showed that laboratory
cotton and non-cotton races of H. armigera possessed distinct internal morphological features (numbers of cornuti
on the male aedeagus). As an example of a study in which
mtDNA COI sequence comparisons did reveal cryptic species, Crespi et al. [42] found that the Australian gall forming thrips represented a pair of sibling species, previously
indistinguishable. Our study failed to find such differentiation based on 511 bp of the mtDNA COI gene. Currently, there is no compelling molecular evidence for the
existence of H. armigera sub-species or races in the Old
World. Further work using nuclear DNA makers or genes
associated with the detoxification of secondary plant compounds may yet reveal differentiation. For example,
strong genetic differentiation in maize and mugwort races
of the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) was
reported by Thomas et al. [43] based on allozyme markers, while only low genetic differentiation of races was
detected by mitochondrial DNA analysis [43,44].
Phylogenetic analysis of the four important pest Helicoverpa species indicated that all H. armigera haplotypes
formed a monophyletic clade which included the New
World species H. zea. This phylogeny also revealed that H.
punctigera is basal to H. assulta, which is in turn basal to H.
armigera and H. zea (Fig. 2). The current mtDNA COI phylogeny is congruent with the phylogeny of Mitter et al. [1]
as inferred from morphological characters and allozyme
data, although their work did not provide a well resolved
phylogenetic relationship between H. armigera, H. zea and
H. punctigera. In this investigation the phylogenetic relationships of all four Helicoverpa pest species based on
mtDNA COI region were sufficiently resolved and supported by bootstrap values of greater than 70%. This study
demonstrated that the mtDNA COI gene is suitable for
resolving Helicoverpa phylogeny. The inclusion of other
Helicoverpa species and combining evidences from
mtDNA COI and rapidly evolving nuclear non-coding
sequences (ie, intron sequences) will be necessary for constructing a robust Helicoverpa phylogeny, especially that
between the two closely related H. armigera and H. zea

divergence level at the mtDNA COI gene for differentiating between different Lepidoptera species, although
Whinnett et al. [48] cautioned against this and advised the
inclusion of additional data types prior to drawing such
conclusion. In the noctuid moth Busseola fusca, Sezonlin
et al. [49] reported 3.1% nucleotide divergence (p distance) in mtDNA Cytochrome b gene between different
clades of the same species. The similar genetic distance
reported in this study suggests that H. armigera and H. zea
are more closely related to each other than the case with
the Busseola fusca species, possibly due to a more rapid
divergence rate.

species. A monophyletic relationship between H. armigera
and H. zea (with low bootstrap support values and limited
sample sizes) was inferred based on the nuclear Elongation Factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) gene [45] and the Dopa
Decarboxylase (DDC) gene [46], while a DDC and EF-1α
multi-gene phylogeny also supported monophyly
between H. zea and H. armigera with a higher bootstrap
value [46].
Pairwise genetic distances between H. armigera and H. zea
(0.031 – 0.047) were intermediate between that expected
for intra- and interspecific comparisons, thereby indicating high levels of genetic similarity between H. zea and H.

The estimates of divergence time between H. armigera and
H. zea, by applying a linear rate of substitution in short
term evolution [50] of 2% per million years [51], suggest
that the North and South American continents H. zea populations were established via a founder event from H.
armigera no more than 1.5 million years ago. This is further supported by highly similar morphology [4] and the
mating compatibility between these two species
[4,52,53], although the possibility of mating incompatibility via mechanical isolation (ie, locked in copula)
between these two species was also reported [4]. Based on
high sequence homologies in the transposable element
piggyBac, Zimowska and Handler [54] proposed H. zea
and H. armigera inter-mating as a possible explanation for
the propagation of these mobile elements, while arguing
for conspecific status in H. zea and H. armigera should
these elements share the same genomic insertion sites in
these two species. The founder event hypothesis should be
further tested through a better H. zea sampling regime
across the northern and southern American continents, as
strong geographic components to intraspecific polymorphisms and inadequate sampling can lead to inaccurate
phylogenies [55].

Conclusion
This study suggests that for pest management purposes,
there is currently no molecular basis for treating geographic or host specific populations of H. armigera differently. The current study does not suggest that H. armigera
and H. zea are a single species but does show their close
relationship and indicates a fairly recent (<1.5mya) divergence of H. zea from a parental H. armigera stock. We
should utilise their genetic similarity as the basis of formulating strategies for concerted future research efforts
into areas such as complete genome sequencing, and the
mapping and identification of economically important
genes (e.g., insecticide or allelochemical resistance associated genes) through crossing experiments. The scientific
community is now presented with a valuable opportunity,
whereby the complete genome sequencing of either one
of these species will significantly advance our understand-

ing of genome organisation of both, and thus our efforts
in fighting against two of the most destructive lepidopteran pests of the Old and New Worlds.

Methods
Samples collection and DNA extraction
A total of 249 H. armigera individuals were collected from
India, China, Pakistan, Burkina Faso and Uganda as larvae, adults or pupae. Larvae were collected directly from
host plants or were laboratory reared first generation individuals (Table 1). Genomic DNA was also extracted from
64 H. zea, five H. punctigera, and five H. assulta adults. Phylogenetic analysis used Heliothis virescens as the out-group.
All samples were preserved in 100% ethanol and stored at
-20°C prior to DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was
extracted using the DNeasy ® Tissue Kit (Qiagen, cat. #
69506) or the method of Zraket et al. [56].
Primers, PCR and sequencing
In a preliminary population survey we randomly
sequenced 62 H. armigera (10 Australia, 10 China, 10
Pakistan, 12 Burkina Faso, 20 India), representative haplotypes of 11 H. zea and two of each H. assulta and H.
punctigera at the mtDNA region (809 bp) that spanned the
partial COI gene (552 bp) at the 3' end, the complete
intergenic region between COI and COII genes (tRNALeu, 67 bp) and the 5' partial region of the COII gene (190
bp). Due to the general homogeneous nature of sequences
at the terminal region of COI, the tRNA-Leu gene and the
COII partial gene (sequence data available upon request),
we restricted our population analysis to include only the
informative partial COI (511 bp) region. For all remaining population samples to be analysed, a 680 bp fragment
of the mtDNA COI gene was initially PCR amplified using
the primers COI-F01 (5' TTATTTCACATCAGCTACTAT 3')
and COI-R01 (5' CTTTATAAATGGGGTTTAAAT 3') and
subsequently trimmed to the desirable 511 bp. Primers
were designed based on H. armigera COI sequences
deposited in GenBank (AY437834, AY437835,
AF467260) using the primer analysis software Oligo 6.4
(Molecular Biology Insights, Ins). PCR conditions used
the following profile: 94°C for 4 minutes (one cycle); one
minute each of 94°C, 50°C and 72°C (35 cycles), followed by a final extension cycle of 72°C for 5 minutes.
PCR amplification of individual DNA samples was carried
out in a total reaction volume of 25 µL, and contained 25
ng of genomic DNA, 0.2µM each of forward and reverse
primers, 0.2 mM of dNTP's, 1× PCR reaction buffer
(Promega), 1.5 mM Mg2+ and one unit of Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega).

Amplicons were purified using the QIAquick® PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, cat. # 8106) prior to the sequencing
reaction. The DNA sequencing reaction used the ABI
BigDye® dideoxy chain termination sequencing system

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/117

(Applied Biosystems) following the supplier's instructions, and was electrophoresed by the Australian Genome
Research Facility (AGRF, Melbourne). Double stranded
sequences were obtained for all samples, for accuracy. In
addition, 45 individuals including representatives of each
haplotype were sequenced at least twice using amplicons
from separate PCR reactions to ascertain the accuracy of
the single nucleotid polymorphisms (SNPs) detected.
Sequences were assembled using Pregap4 and Gap4 programs within the molecular biology software STADEN
package [57]. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using
the sequence alignment program Clustal X [58] and were
checked manually. Due to the absence of INDELs, alignment of all sequences was straight forward. Sequences that
differed by one or more nucleotides were considered as
different haplotypes, while sequences exhibiting identical
SNPs at same nucleotide positions were considered as
same haplotypes. MtDNA COI partial amino acid
sequence alignment was also carried out using the
sequence alignment program Clustal X.
MtDNA haplotypes network and COI phylogenetic
analysis
A mtDNA COI haplotype network for H. armigera was
constructed manually and verified using the program TCS,
version 1.13 [59]. For the maximum likelihood (ML)
analysis, the computer program MODELTEST 3.7 [60]
was used to determine the optimal model of nucleotide
evolution. We applied ML analysis using the computer
program PAUP* 4.0b 10 [61] to assess the phylogenetic
relationships between the Helicoverpa moth species. A
heuristic tree search with the 'asis' stepwise addition and
TBR branch swapping algorithm was used to find the best
ML tree. To assess branch support in our ML trees we used
non-parametric bootstrapping with heuristic searches of
1,000 replications. We implement the criteria of Huelsenbeck and Hillis [35] to assess the confidence of tree topology, whereby nodes with confidence intervals of > 70%
are considered as sufficiently resolved, while weakly
resolved nodes are defined as having confidence intervals
of 50% to 70%. The distance matrix option of PAUP
*4.0b 10 [61] was used to calculate inter- and intra-species genetic distances as inferred from the nucleotide substitution model selected by MODELTEST 3.7.
Statistical analysis of population structure
Genetic differentiation among all predefined H. armigera
populations were estimated using single locus F-statistics
of Weir and Cockerman [62] in GENEPOP v3.4 [63].
Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA; Excoffier et al.
[64]) and diversity index calculations were performed
with the AREQUIN 2.000 software [65] using pairwise
haplotypes distance as the distance measure. We partitioned our data for hierarchical analyses into three groups
as Asia (India, Pakistan and China), Africa (Burkina Faso

and Uganda) and Australia (Orbost, Dalmore and Werribee). Due to small sample sizes and non-significant Fst
values in the ten Indian populations, all ten populations
were pooled in AMOVA analysis. Levels of polymorphism
between countries were estimated using haplotype diversity (h, probability that two randomly chosen haplotypes
are different in the sample) and nucleotide diversity (π)
[66].
