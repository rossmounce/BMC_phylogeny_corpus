Differential regulation drives plasticity in
sex determination gene networks
Thomas MacCarthy1,2, Robert M Seymour1,3, Andrew Pomiankowski1,4*

Abstract
Background: Sex determination networks evolve rapidly and have been studied intensely across many species,
particularly in insects, thus presenting good models to study the evolutionary plasticity of gene networks.
Results: We study the evolution of an unlinked gene capable of regulating an existing diploid sex determination
system. Differential gene expression determines phenotypic sex and fitness, dramatically reducing the number of
assumptions of previous models. It allows us to make a quantitative evaluation of the full range of evolutionary
outcomes of the system and an assessment of the likely contribution of sexual conflict to change in sex
determination systems. Our results show under what conditions network mutations causing differential regulation
can lead to the reshaping of sex determination networks.
Conclusion: The analysis demonstrates the complex relationship between mutation and outcome: the same
mutation can produce many different evolved populations, while the same evolved population can be produced
by many different mutations. Existing network structure alters the constraints and frequency of evolutionary
changes, which include the recruitment of new regulators, changes in heterogamety, protected polymorphisms,
and transitions to a new locus that controls sex determination.

Background
Differential regulation of gene expression plays a
primary role in the evolution of developmental networks
[1,2]. In recent years there has been considerable progress towards understanding the evolution of gene regulation in development [3-5]. In some pathways, adaptive
mutations appear constrained to central hub positions,
as with the shavenbaby (ovo) locus for insect trichome
differentiation [6,7], or bric-a-brac (bab) for fly abdominal pigmentation [8]. In contrast, other developmental
processes allow adaptive mutations to occur throughout
the network, as with Drosophila wing pigmentation
[9,10] and wing polyphenism in ants [11]. Although progress in the field is advancing rapidly, the understanding
of the evolutionary mechanisms driving regulatory
changes is still limited. To address this issue we consider sex determination networks, as they evolve rapidly
and are well characterized in species at varying phylogenetic distances, for example insects [12,13], worms [14],
fishes [15] and mammals [16]. Sex determination is also

a relatively simple phenotypic task compared to many
other developmental functions such as somite formation
or morphogenesis where complex pattern formation is
required.
Comparative study shows that sex determination networks evolve by recruitment of novel regulators higher
up the pathway [17]. For example, the gene Sex-lethal
(Sxl), an upstream regulator of sex determination first
found in D. melanogaster [18], does not appear to play
any role in sex determination outside the Drosophilidae
[13,19,20]. In contrast, the downstream regulator doublesex (dsx) is conserved across insects, worms [21,22]
and mammals [23]. A similar paradigm has been
proposed for segmentation in arthropods where
segment-polarity genes such as engrailed (en) appear
highly conserved and where the degree of conservation
becomes progressively reduced for genes both upstream
and downstream [24,25]. In sex determination, the addition of upstream elements results in considerable
change in the regulatory role of downstream elements.
For example, the gene transformer (tra) autoregulates in
the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata [26] but
lost this capacity when Sxl was recruited as an upstream

regulator in Drosophila. Likewise, high regulatory variability is seen in the phylogenetically common dsx locus,
which is regulated via alternative splicing of RNA by tra
in many Diptera [13], but via the unrelated transcription
factor tra-1 in worms [14].
Previous theoretical study showed how regulatory
changes causing alterations in signal strength, could
account for the evolution of the sex determination regulatory cascade of D. melanogaster in a step-by-step fashion [27]. In seeking to explain the specific case of D.
melanogaster, particular evolutionary outcomes were
addressed to account for the peculiarities of the genes
involved in the network, for example multiple promoter
sites, alternative splicing, and premature stop codons
[27]. This detailed approach can be contrasted with
others that have considered the population genetic conditions which must be met to allow the spread of autosomal modifiers of sex determination factors located on
the sex chromosomes [28-30]. This has allowed sex
ratio imbalance [28] and sexual antagonism [30] to be
investigated as likely causes of change in sex determination. But research taking the latter approach has
neglected to explicitly model the network dynamics and
thus cannot explain how particular network architectures have arisen.
Here we present a model that combines gene network
evolution with population genetics, allowing us to study
the effect of differential gene expression with general
applicability and minimal assumptions. Standard
approaches to gene network evolution have used haploid
models to simplify the dynamics [31-38]. This is not
possible here as gene dosage is a key aspect in the sex
determination of higher organisms. We consider how an
unlinked gene, not previously involved in sex determination, can be recruited to regulate an existing diploid sex
determination system. We assume that the ancestral system is controlled by polymorphism at a single sex-determining locus. The regulatory changes caused by the
recruited gene can bring about a new sex determining
locus, induce heterogamety changes or stabilize multiple
male or female genotypes (protected polymorphisms).
Furthermore, the same mutation can produce many different evolved outcomes, while the same evolved outcome can be produced by many different mutations. In
the next section we define the model and follow this
with a specific application to sex determination; further
details of the simulations are given in the Methods.

General Model
We extend a general model of gene regulation [38,39],
using a network-oriented definition of alleles. First, each
allele i may be regulated by an allele j at another locus
(e.g. via cis-regulatory elements or RNA splicing sites),
indicated by a parameter Ii, j Î {-1, 0, 1} which is 1 for

Page 3 of 14

up-regulation, -1 for down-regulation and 0 for no regulation. Second, an allele i may code for a regulatory
domain (e.g. transcription factor or RNA recognition
motif), indicated by a parameter Zi Î {0, 1} which is 1
when the allele is regulatory and 0 otherwise. Third, each
allele i has a constitutive output level defined by a parameter Ti, which is either low (Ti = -1) or high (Ti = 1).
These features determine the (time-dependent) expression level Si of each allele i via the dynamical system

The summation is over all alleles j, and we assume

is a sigmoid function. Most gene regulatory interactions can be approximated using this class of function
[40-42] which varies between 0 and 1 with maximum
steepness h (see Table 1 for full list of symbols). The
initial conditions are S i (0) = s(kT i ) which are equilibrium expression levels if there is no regulation. The
parameter k > 0 is a global constant that defines the
relative contribution of the constitutive output to total
ˆ
gene expression. Note that the steady state output S of
i

allele i is the solution of

∑I

S i = s ([

i, j Z jS j ] +

kTi )

j

attained from these initial conditions. Note that this
model can also incorporate autoregulation by allowing
alleles at the same locus to regulate their own expression (i.e. including alleles i in the summation term of
Eq(1)).

Model of Sex Determination
In our application of this general model to sex determination, the ancestral sex determination system is
assumed to be controlled by a single locus D segregating
for two alleles m and f. As there is no regulation in the
ancestral condition, Eq(3) simplifies to
ˆ
S i = s (kTi ).

(4)

The two alleles m and f are assumed to have constitutive low (T m = -1) and high (T f = + 1) output levels
respectively. We consider an XY male heterogametic
system consisting of m/f males and f/f females (ancestral
female heterozygosity is symmetric to the male heterozygous case, see Additional file 1).

The D locus controls sex determination. Specifically, if
the sum of outputs of the two D locus alleles, d1 and d2,
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
exceeds a threshold θ, S D = S d1 + S d2 > q , then the phenotype is female, otherwise it is male. This system is
inspired by the way doublesex (dsx) expression determines somatic sex in Drosophila, where high expression
of the female form of the dsx protein is required for a
female phenotype [12]. In our model, other genetic loci
do not affect sex determination directly, though they can
do so indirectly by altering gene expression at the D
locus. Given ancestral male and female expression levels
ˆ
ˆ
S DM and S DF , respectively, we set q = (S DM + S DF ) / 2 .
In the ancestral system, we assume that there are no regulatory interactions controlling the D locus. Hence male
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
expression is S DM = S m + S f = s (k) + s (−k) = 1 and
ˆ
ˆ
S DF = 2S f = 2s (k) . Therefore, θ = s (k)+1/2. Thus, larger values of k mean a larger difference in gene expression around the threshold value θ between the two sexes.
We study the evolution of regulation controlled by a
second locus R. We start from a situation in which the
R locus is fixed for an allele a that does not regulate the
D locus, Z a = 0. Consider a mutant allele A at the R
locus that has a regulatory domain able to interact with
the D locus, ZA = 1. In order for a regulatory interaction
to evolve, the R locus allele A must be present together
with a variant m or f allele at the D locus that is capable
of being regulated by A. The m and f variant alleles are
labeled according to whether the interaction causes upregulation of expression (m+, f+ with I m + ,A = I f + ,A = 1 )
or down-regulation of expression (m - , f - with
I m - ,A = I f - ,A = −1 ). We use Eq(4) assuming TA = 1 (i.e.
high constitutive expression, see Methods) to calculate
the expression level of the alleles at the R locus, and

then use Eq(3) to calculate the regulated expression of
the alleles at the D locus.
As the evolution of regulation by the R locus of the D
locus requires change at both loci, we consider that one
part of the connection exists in the background state,
with the remaining part being completed by a subsequent mutation at the other locus. For example, if the
allele A (R locus) is already present in the background
state, it can complete a connection through the mutation of the f allele to the f+ allele (D locus) which contains a novel input binding domain. This creates a
positive regulatory connection from the R locus to the
D locus. We denote this example a®A/f®f + (background/mutant). If we reverse the order to f®f+/a®A,
then the allele f+ already exists in the background state
and the connection is completed by the mutation of the
a allele to the A allele which contains a novel output
regulatory domain.
There are eight possible combinations of background
state and mutant that give rise to a novel regulatory
connection: (1) a®A/f®f - , (2) a®A/f®f + , (3) a®A/
m®m-, (4) a®A/m®m+, (5) f®f-/a®A, (6) f®f+/a®A,
(7) m®m-/a®A, (8) m®m+/a®A (Table 2). Note that
in cases (1) to (4), the background state allele A is
assumed to be at fixation, and the consequence of introducing a mutant at the D locus is considered (either f-, f
+
, m- or m+). In cases (5) to (8), either f-, f+, m- or m+
already are present in the background state (having
replaced f or m), and we follow the mutant A allele
introduced at the R locus. Note that the first four cases
involve a cis mutation at the D locus occurring after a
trans mutation at the R locus, and vice versa for the second four cases.

To illustrate our approach, we consider the mutation
pair f®f - /a®A (Figure 1). In this case the ancestral
male and female genotypes are m/f - and f - /f - respectively (with the a allele at fixation). The mutant A is
then introduced at low frequency. The A mutant
ˆ
down-regulates f-, so the expression of S D is lower in
a/A;m/f- males than in ancestral males. The A mutant
ˆ
also reduces S D in the a/A;f - /f - genotype. If
ˆ − q = 2s (−s (k) + k) − (s (k) + 1 2) < 0 , this genoSD
type is transformed into a male and the sex determination system can undergo a transition from the D to
the R locus. The m allele is lost resulting in heterozygous a/A;f -/f- males and homozygous a/a;f-/f- females.
There is no change in the female genotype, but the
dominant masculinizing m allele at the D locus is
replaced by the dominant masculinizing A allele at the
R locus. This occurs in Region I of Figure 2(e).
In contrast, if the genotype a/A;f-/f- is female (Figure 1),
matings between this female and mutant males (a/A;m/f-)
produces two new genotypes that are AA homozygous:
A/A;m/f- and A/A;f-/f-. The genotype A/A;m/f- is male
ˆ
because its S D is lower than in the ancestral male. The
genotype A/A;f - /f - can be male or female. If 2s(-2(k)
+k)-(s(k)+1/2) < 0 then it is male, which can lead to a

The new regulatory interaction between the R and D
ˆ
loci alters S D . This can cause a change in phenotypic
sex. In addition, it can cause a change in the fitness (W)
of each genotype. In the background state, male (WM)
and female (W F ) fitness are set to 1. The fitness of
mutant genotypes is measured relative to the backˆ
ground state genotypes: WF = 1 + ΔS DF w F if the novel
ˆ
genotype is female, and WM = 1 + ΔS DM w M if it is
ˆ
male, where ΔS D is the difference in D locus expression
caused by the mutant relative to the unregulated ancestral genotype (i.e. evolved minus ancestral gene expression). For example, consider a mutant male with
genotype a/A;m + /f and expression in males
ˆ
S DM = s (s (k) − k) + s (k) (given we assume TA = 1 - see
Methods). If the ancestral male was a/a; m+/f then the
ˆ
ancestral expression is S DM = s (−k) + s (k) , and the difˆ
ference is ΔS D = s (s (k) − k) − s (−k) . The fitness parameters wM and wF define the direction and magnitude of
selection in males and females respectively. Within the
simulations (see Methods), we use random numbers in the
range (-1/2,1/2) for both WF and WM to avoid negative fitˆ
ness values for WF and WM (as the range for ΔS D is -2 to
+2). We assume that fitness is not directly affected by the
R locus, although change at this locus may of course affect
ˆ
fitness indirectly via S D . In the next section we use an
example to illustrate how the model functions.

Results and Discussion
We used simulations within a standard populationgenetic framework to study the fate of pairs of mutations that establish new regulatory connections (see
Methods). For each run, we recorded whether the mutation spread and caused a transition to the new sex
determining R locus, or recruitment of the mutant with
sex determination remaining at the ancestral D locus.
We also noted whether transitions and recruitments
caused a change in heterogamety. A number of simulations resulted in protected polymorphisms in which a
stable equilibrium was reached that contained more

Figure 1 Evolution of mutation pair f®f-/a®A. The mutant A is
introduced at low frequency in the genotype a/A;m/f-. Through
interbreeding, a range of other genotypes are produced in
subsequent generations (represented by arrows). Phenotypic sex (i.e.
indicated above the arrows) of these novel genotypes depends on
the values of k and h (see Figure 2(e)). Three potential outcomes
are possible: transition to a new sex determining locus (Region I),
transition coupled with a change in heterogamety (Region II), or
recruitment of allele A without change in the sex determining locus
(Region III).

Figure 2 Evolutionary outcomes. Evolutionary outcomes depend heavily on k (the level of constitutive expression across both loci) and h (the
ˆ
steepness of the sigmoid function s of Eq (2)) which jointly determine the change in gene expression at the D locus (S D) caused by the A
regulatory allele at the R locus. For each mutation pair, we map regions in which there are transitions in sex determination locus (T), recruitment
without transition (R), and changes in heterogamety (H).

population composed of A/A;f - /f - males and a/A;f - /f females (Region II, Figure 2(e)). Once again there is a
transition of control of sex determination from the D to
the R locus, but in this case with an attendant change in
heterogamety. The A mutant is a recessive masculinizer
which replaces the m allele at the D locus. In contrast, if
the genotype A/A;f-/f- is female, this can lead to a population of A/A;m/f- males and A/A;f-/f- females. Here, the
mutant allele A is recruited, replacing the ancestral allele
a, without changing either the sex determination locus or
heterogamety.
This example shows how multiple outcomes follow
from a single mutation a®A which causes the network
to down-regulate the pre-existing f- allele. The A mutant
can cause a transition in the sex determination system,
with or without change in heterogamety or just simple
recruitment of A without any change in the sex determining system (Table 3).
The outcomes depend on the values of k and h that
determine the change in gene expression at the D locus
ˆ
( S D) due to the novel regulatory connection of the A
allele at the R locus. The parameter k determines the
background level of constitutive expression across both
loci. It has a major effect on the evolutionary outcome
(Figure 2). When k is high, regulation by A is relatively
weak and thus major re-organisation of the sex determination systems do not occur. In contrast when k is low,
regulation by A is relatively strong, allowing changes in
genotypic sex, changes in heterogamety and transitions
of the sex determination system to the R locus. The
parameter h determines the steepness of the sigmoid
function s of Eq (2), and has a minor effect on the

evolutionary outcome (Figure 2). This reflects the limited, but biologically realistic, range of h examined, over
which it has a relatively small effect on the function s
(see Methods). In addition, the outcome depends on the
fitness of each genotype, which we consider in a separate section below.
Sex determination transitions

Only two of the eight mutation pairs considered cause
transitions in the sex determination locus from the D to
the R locus: f®f - /a®A and m®m + /a®A (Figure 2(e)
and 2(h), Table 3). Transitions occur when k is small (Eq
(1)-(3)) and the A allele causes a large change in gene
ˆ
expression at the D locus. When this is sufficient for S D
to breach the θ threshold, it causes a change in genotypic
sex (e.g. f-/f- is male instead of female when down-regulated by AA). It can then lead to fixation of the regulated
allele at the D locus (either f- or m+), with transition of
the control of sex determination to genetic variation at
the R locus (Table 3). Transitions involving m+ mutation
pairs follow a similar pattern to those seen with the f mutation discussed in detail above (Figure 2(h)).
The remaining six mutation pairs never generate transitions. These are not possible when the a®A mutation
precedes mutation at the D locus, simply because transitions require polymorphism at the R locus. In these
cases, the A allele is assumed to have gone to fixation,
so the R locus is monomorphic. We relaxed this constraint by allowing a “back” mutation at the R locus
(from A®a, with output Za = 0) following mutation at
the D locus. Under these conditions we again observed
sex determination locus transitions with the f- and m+

a: Given 10,000 independent simulations, outcomes for each mutation pair are separated into one or more regions in parameter space (see Figure 2), in addition,
the frequency of protected polymorphisms is given for each region (see Figure 4).
b: Outcomes are coded as transitions (T) or recruitments (R), with change in heterogamety (H).

mutation pairs, but not with f+ and m- (Additional file
2). The range of k needed for the transitions follows the
same pattern as seen with the f®f - /a®A and m®m
+
/a®A mutation pairs (Figure 2(e) and 2(h)).
A second constraint governs the absence of transitions
for f®f+/a®A and m®m-/a®A. Consider f®f+/a®A.
In order for a transition in the sex determination system
to take place, all genotypes must evolve to be homozygous f + at the D locus (i.e. with loss of the m allele).
ˆ
However, as the A allele up-regulates f+, the output S D
for A genotypes will be at least as high as for the ancestral female, making a male f + homozygous genotype
impossible. Similarly, for the m®m - /a®A mutation
pair, the A allele down-regulates m- and makes a female
m - homozygous genotype impossible. In these cases,
transition of sex determination to the R locus cannot
occur and build-up of the sex determination cascade is
impossible [17], a condition close to the concept of

“evolutionary constraint” (an unreachable region of evolutionary space [43]).
The two cases that allow sex determination transitions, f®f- /a®A and m®m+ /a®A (Figure 2(e) and 2
(h)), do not fall under either of these constraints. In
both cases, polymorphism occurs at both the R and D
loci and homozygotes of f- and m+ alleles can segregate
in males and females.
Recruitment and changes in heterogamety

Unlike transitions which are limited to two mutation pairs,
recruitment events were observed for every mutational
class (Table 3 and Figure 2). In a recruitment the mutant
allele spreads but sex determination remains at the ancestral D locus. Recruitment occurs for all values of k and
sometimes causes a change in heterogamety (Figure 2).
For high values of k, recruitment occurs without
change in heterogamety (Figure 2, Table 3). In no case

MacCarthy et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:388
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/388

does the new regulatory interaction between the A and
ˆ
D loci cause S D to breach θ, so no change in genotypic
sex is possible. For example, in the a®A/m®m+ mutation pair, the m + allele is up-regulated but is still a
dominant masculinizer. Hence the A/A;m+/f genotype is
male, like the ancestral A/A;m/f genotype. These simple
replacements result in up- or down-regulation of
expression at the D locus, but do not permit a change
in heterogamety.
With lower values of k, recruitment can cause change
from male to female heterogamety, which is seen for
five of the eight mutation pairs (Figure 2). For example,
in the a®A/f®f+ mutation pair, the change in heterogamety occurs because the new f+ allele is a dominant
feminizer (A/A;m/f+), whereas in the a®A/f®f- mutation pair, the new allele is a recessive masculinizer (A/A;
f-/f-). The pattern is more complex with a®A/m®m+
mutation pairs. In this case the up-regulation of m +
ˆ
caused by the A alleles is sufficient to cause S D to
breach θ and so result in sex change. There are three
possibilities. Two of these cause a change in heterogamety: a dominant m + feminizer leading to A/A;m/m +
females, or an m + allele which only feminizes in conjunction with the f allele leading to A/A;m+/f females.
Alternatively the m+ allele is a recessive feminizer leading to A/A;m+/m+ females, which remain the homogametic sex. In contrast, changes in heterogamety never
occur with the m - mutation (either a®A/m®m - or
m®m-/a®A), as the m- allele is a dominant masculinizer and so can never be expressed in a female.
Changes in heterogamety thus require the new regulatory connection to cause sufficient change in gene
ˆ
expression ( S D ) towards the threshold for change in
sex (θ) to result in a change in genotypic sex.

to spread is that selection favors lower expression at the D
locus in males (i.e. wM < 0). Male-only mutants (Table 3
column WM > 1, WF = 1) were found in all mutational
classes, except for f®f+/a®A and a®A/f®f+. In these
two cases, there are no conditions under which the f+
mutation is ever restricted to males. There are no cases of
female-only mutants (Table 3 column WF > 1, WM = 1).
Under conditions of ancestral female heterogamety this
pattern is reversed with female-only mutants but no maleonly mutants (outcomes are symmetrical to ancestral male
heterogamety, Additional file 1).
When mutations occur in both sexes, they most frequently spread when selection favors them in both sexes
(Table 3, W M > 1, W F > 1). However, there are many
examples of sexual conflict in which the new regulatory
connection is favored in one sex but deleterious in the
other (i.e. WM > 1, WF < 1 or WM < 1, WF > 1). Consider
the mutation pair a®A/f®f- when k is large (Region III
in Figure 2(a)). Here, a total of three new genotypes are
created: one (m/f-) is male and the other two (f-/f and f-/
f-) are female (note that all genotypes are homozygous A
at the R locus). The new male genotype m/f- has lower
ˆ
expression at the D locus ( S D ) than the ancestral m/f
ˆ
male, and therefore ΔS DM < 0 . Similarly the two mutant
ˆ
female genotypes (f-/f and f-/f-) also have lower S D than
ˆ
the ancestral f/f female, so ΔS DF < 0 in both cases.
When selection favors lower D expression in both sexes
(wM < 0, wF < 0), the new genotypes raise fitness in both
sexes (WM > 1, WF > 1). However when lower expression
is only favored in one sex (either wM > 0, wF < 0 or wM < 0,
wF > 0) there is sexual conflict (either WM < 1, WF > 1 or
WM > 1, WF < 1 respectively). Under this condition, recruitment occurs as long as the combined fitness across the
sexes is raised, (WM - 1)+(WF - 1) > 0 (Figure 3). The latter
condition applies to all recruitment and transition events.

Network fitness

Knowing the sex of each mutant genotype is not enough
for predicting outcomes. These also depend on the fitness of each genotype, determined by wM and wF. These
coefficients specify whether selection favors higher or
lower expression at the D locus and scale the effect of
changes in gene expression in males and females
respectively.
The importance of selection is most easily seen when
mutants only occur in one sex. Given ancestral male heterogamety, a few mutants only occur in males (Table 3),
so their spread depends exclusively on wM (the value of
w F is irrelevant). The condition for selection to favor
ˆ
spread is ΔS DM w M > 0 , causing an increase in male fitness, W M > 1. As there is no mutant female genotype,
WF = 1. For example, in the mutation pair a®A/m®m(Figure 2(c)), the mutant A/A;m-/f is necessarily male as
ˆ
the m- allele is down-regulated and ΔS DM < 0 . Since no
other genotypes are created, the only requirement for m-

Protected polymorphisms

Many mutations lead to protected polymorphisms in
which there is more than one male or female genotype
at equilibrium (Table 3, Figure 4). For a®A/X mutation
pairs (i.e. the A regulatory allele already exists in the
background state before a cis mutation occurs in the m
or f alleles), polymorphism occurs at the D locus, while
for X/a®A mutation pairs (i.e. cis mutation occurs in
the m or f allele before mutation to the A allele), polymorphism occurs at both the A and D loci. Protected
polymorphisms are restricted to those sub-regions
(Figure 4) that otherwise cause a change in heterogamety or transitions (Figure 2). Under certain conditions, more than one genotype is generated in both
sexes and persists at the polymorphic equilibrium.
As an example, consider Region II of mutation pair
a®A/f®f- (Table 3, Figure 4(a)). Here, there are two new
male genotypes and one new female genotype (Figure 5

(a)). Protected polymorphism typically occurs when
selection favors lower expression in males wM < 0 and
females wF < 0 (Figure 6 green points), so the f- allele is
favored in m/f - males and f/f - females, but not in f - /f males. This results in the retention of m, f and f- alleles
(Figure 5(a)). Protected polymorphism also occurs in a
small region when wM < 0 and WF > 0 (Figure 6), where
selection against the new female genotype (f/f-) is not sufficient to eliminate the new f- allele that is favored in f-/fmales alone.

Protected polymorphisms are abundant in some
regions (Figure 4). With a®A/X mutation pairs, protected polymorphism occurs when selection favors
retention of all three alleles at the D locus. This is the
ˆ
case when the ordering of S D follows the pattern of
ˆ
Figure 5(a), as described above. With the alternative S D
ordering shown in Figure 5(b), protected polymorphism
is rare or absent. Here, the novel female heterozygote
(f-/f in this example) cannot be the most favored genotype as its expression lies between the new and ancestral
homozygotes. So when selection favors lower expression
in males and females (wM < 0, wF < 0), the new f- allele
is favored and goes to fixation. The same pattern is seen
for f+, m- and m+ mutation pairs.
With X/a®A mutation pairs, protected polymorphisms require retention of multiple alleles across both the
A and D loci. They are abundant in regions (Figure 4)
in which selection can favor the R locus heterozygote in
one sex and the D locus heterozygote in the other sex
(an example of this pattern is given in Figure 5(c)). Protected polymorphism is also common if the double heterozygote is the most favored genotype in one sex
(Figure 5(d)). In contrast, protected polymorphism is
rare or absent from regions in which the expression of
one of the single-locus heterozygotes lies between the
new and ancestral homozygotes and so cannot be the
most favored genotype (Figure 5(e)). These patterns are
similar to those seen with a®A/X mutation pairs, but
are more complex as they now involve two loci (for a
ˆ
list of S D orderings for all mutation pairs see Additional file 3).

Conclusion
In this paper, we develop a diploid gene network model
that explicitly considers how cis and trans mutations
contribute to evolutionary change in sex determination.
Previous population genetic models [28-30,44] have
ignored this and simply assumed each genotype is associated with a particular sex and fitness (e.g.1+s). Instead
we let sex determination and fitness arise through the
expression dynamics of the network. We then study
evolution following a cis mutation in an existing sex
determining allele (either m+, m-, f+ or f- alleles at the D
locus) followed by a trans gain-of-function mutation at
a locus not previously involved in sex determination (R
locus) or vice versa.
Generally, we observe a many-to-many relationship as the
same mutation can produce many outcomes and the same
outcome can arise through many mutations (Figure 2,
Table 3). In addition, the same outcome can result from
many different selective regimes (e.g. mutants favored in
both sexes or subject to sexual conflict, Table 3). These
observations are important as they imply that changes in
the sex determination systems of related species can arise in
multiple ways, and a great deal of biological detail will
be required to reconstruct the evolutionary history and
selective regime that promoted evolutionary change [27].
Some constraints are identifiable. Of the eight possible
mutation pairs (shown in Table 3), only two permit transitions in which a new upstream regulator takes over sex
determination (f®f-/a®A and m®m+/a®A, in which the
f- and m+ alleles exist prior to the mutation of a to A). In
these cases, a single allele at the ancestral sex determination locus (D) is driven to fixation, with the A allele at the
regulatory locus (R) becoming the new determiner of sex.
For f®f-/a®A, the f- allele goes to fixation. When the fhomozygote is down-regulated by A it produces a male,
but in the absence of A (or a lower dose of A) it is female
(Figure 1, Table 3). Similarly for m®m+/a®A, the m+
goes to fixation, and the m+ homozygote is female when
up-regulated by A, but male in the absence (or lower
dose) of A. Such switching is not possible for mutations
involving f+ and m- alleles. The up-regulation of f+ and
down-regulation of m- homozygotes caused by the A regulator merely strengthens existing female and male signals
respectively. Hence for these mutants, the ability to determine both male and female sexes requires retention of
polymorphism at the ancestral D locus (i.e. f + and m mutant alleles cannot go to fixation), and sex determination cannot pass to the new R locus.
There is a further constraint as transitions to a new
upstream regulator are only possible when mutation to for m+ cis alleles are established prior to the mutation of a
to A trans regulator. Transitions are not possible when
these mutations occur in the opposite order (Figure 2).

MacCarthy et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:388
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/388

This constraint arises for the simple reason that there
must be polymorphism at the R locus for it to take over
sex determination from the ancestral D locus. It can be
overcome by allowing variance at the R locus through
secondary “back” or null mutations from A to the a allele
which lacks regulatory ability (Additional file 2). However, given that the A allele is likely to perform other regulatory functions prior to its recruitment for sex
determination, “back” or null mutations are expected to
be deleterious unless these other regulatory functions can
be fulfilled in the hemizygous state or by other loci. This
requirement is likely to restrict this evolutionary route.
One way round this is duplication at the R locus, with
retention of ancestral regulatory functions by one paralog
and gain of the regulation of sex by the other paralog.
Duplication appears to underlie recruitment of Sxl to the
Drosophila sex determination network [45]. In the lineage leading to Drosophila, the ancestral form of Sxl
underwent a duplication. One Sxl paralog gained a role
in sex determination. The other paralog (CG3056) has
retained the ancestral, non-sexual, regulatory functions
as its expression pattern is similar to the non-duplicated
version of Sxl found in the related fly Megaselia scalaris
[45]. In terms of our model, this suggests a m®m+/a®A
sequence of mutations, in which the novel Sxl allele (A
allele at the R locus) was capable of up-regulating an
ancestral m+ allele of tra (D locus). In this reconstruction
we assume that the ancestral sex determination system
was based on tra locus polymorphism [27].
As well as these network features, recruitment of
mutants is most likely when they are favored in both
sexes (WF, WM > 1), or are favored in one sex but do not
segregate in the other (WF > 1, WM = 1 or WF = 1, WM >
1, Table 3). This requires that selection acts in the same
direction as the change in expression caused by the new
ˆ
regulatory interaction ( WF = 1 + ΔS DF w F for females
ˆ
and WM = 1 + ΔS DM w M for males). However, mutants
causing sexual conflict, benefit in one sex and harm in
the other (WM > 1, WF > 1 or WM < 1, WF > 1), spread
with surprising frequency as well (Table 3). We found
that for mutations to spread requires (WM - 1)+(WF - 1)
> 0. That is, given the sex ratio is constrained to be 1:1,
there must be an overall fitness gain summed across the
mutant male and female genotypes, as has been pointed
out in other contexts [28,30,46]. Our results suggest that
transitions of sex determining systems and changes in
heterogamety are not particularly dependent on sexually
antagonistic selection [30,47].
Many mutations establish a new regulatory connection
with the recruitment of new alleles but without change
to a new sex determination locus (Table 3, Figure 2).
Many of these amount to a simple replacement of an
unregulated by a regulated allele at the D locus without
change in genotypic sex or heterogamety (e.g. f+ replaces

Page 11 of 14

f to give f+/f+ females and m/f+ males). Alternatively, the
new regulatory arrangement causes a change in genotypic sex accompanied by a switch from male to female
heterogamety (e.g. f+ replaces f to give m/f+ females and
m/m males). The latter occurs when the effect of the
upstream regulator A is relatively strong and causes a
change in the sex of some genotypes. In either eventuality, A is fixed in the derived population. There are many
potential examples of fixed regulators of sex determination genes. For example, the splicing activity of the SXL
protein in Drosophila is dependent on interactions with
a number of other proteins like SNF and PPS [48-50].
What remains to be determined is whether these interactions evolved before or after the involvement of Sxl in
sex determination.
The conditions that give rise to changes in heterogamety can also result in protected polymorphisms in which
more than one male or female genotype occurs at equilibrium (Figure 4). Protected polymorphisms occur
when selection favors heterozygotes in both sexes at
either the A or D loci (or both). It is surprising how
easily protected polymorphisms arise in our model given
that they are rare in nature, although they have been
found in the housefly Musca domestica [28] and the platyfish Xiphophorus maculates [51]. These multilocus
combinations give rise to some genotypes with low fitness, and so are probably prone to further evolutionary
change, for example involving variations in sex ratio
[28,52] or complex meta-population structures [53], that
resolve them in favor of simpler systems with single
male and female genotypes. In natural examples, other
traits are associated with the sex determination alleles
and selection on them maintains the polymorphism
[28,51].
We have extensively studied evolutionary change
when the ancestral condition is male heterogamety.
Symmetrical constraints apply when the ancestral condition is female heterogamety. Here, transitions to a new
sex determination locus only occur with the f®f+/a®A
and m®m - /a®A mutation pairs (Additional file 1).
Thus, change in the sex determination locus can occur
for all four D locus alleles (f+, f-, m+, m-), but is dependent on ancestral heterogamety.
The importance of the model parameters k (and h to a
lesser degree, Figure 2) in constraining network changes
may shed light on the rate of turnover of sex determination systems. The parameter k determines the level of
constitutive expression. It has a major effect on the evolutionary outcome. When k is high, changes in gene
expression mediated by the regulatory locus (R) are relatively weak and thus major re-organisation of the sex
determination systems does not occur. In effect this stabilizes the established sex determination mechanism. A
high value of k might therefore explain the rareness of

MacCarthy et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:388
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/388

heterogamety changes in birds [54] and mammals [55].
In contrast, when k is small, regulation is relatively
strong, opening up the possibility of changes in genotypic sex, transitions of the sex determination system and
changes in heterogamety. The latter are common in
frogs [56], medaka fish [57] and insects [58,59]. Differential regulation is clearly not the only possible force
underlying changes in sex determination systems. Alternative explanations such as sexually antagonistic selection [30,47] and sex ratio bias [28] are likely to impose
different sets of constraints.
The work in this paper was motivated by the complexities
of the sex determination mechanism of Drosophila melanogaster and related species [12,13]. We have shown the
importance of explicitly considering changes in network
dynamics, due to cis and trans mutations, for predicting
transitions to a new upstream sex determination locus as
well as the recruitment of other regulators which establish
new regulatory interactions at sex determining loci. Our
network approach allows sex and fitness to emerge directly
from the regulatory interactions rather than being imposed
by assumptions made about “modifiers”. This approach
demonstrates that the same mutation can produce many
different evolutionary outcomes, while the same evolved
state can be produced by many different mutations.

Methods
We use a standard population genetics simulation to
study the evolutionary fate of each mutation. The model
assumes an infinite diploid population with non-overlapping generations, with a 1:1 (male:female) sex ratio.
Each mutant allele was introduced at low frequency
(0.5%) in the heterogametic sex (results obtained for
mutants in the homogametic sex were qualitatively
equivalent). At each generation the following steps were
ˆ
taken. First, gene expression S D was calculated for each
genotype, followed by sex determination. Adult male
and female genotype frequencies were calculated using
the fitness values (WM, WF) of each genotype. Random
mating amongst adults assuming unlinked loci was used
to define the zygote frequencies in the following generation. This procedure was repeated until the population
reached equilibrium. We measured the maximum difference (over the set of all genotypes, G) between successive timesteps, e(t) = maxG|p(t) - p(t - 1)|, where p(t) is
the frequency of a genotype at generation t. The system
is considered stable when e(t) < 10-12 . We imposed a
maximum of 1011 timesteps, however, in every simulation the criterion was reached before this maximum
number of steps. A mutant allele was classified as noninvasive if it was driven out, with the final population
being the same as the ancestral population. Invasive
mutants resulting in recruitments or transitions caused

Page 12 of 14

the loss of one of the ancestral alleles. To distinguish
invasive mutants resulting in protected polymorphism
from neutral or very weakly selected mutants, we first
removed genotypes at ≤1% frequency (since mutants are
inserted at 0.5% allele frequency, 1% is the upper bound
genotype frequency for neutral mutants). If more than
one female or male genotype was observed (i.e. protected polymorphism), a second genotype threshold of
0.1% was used to ensure inclusion of all relevant genotypes. Simulations were performed using a custom-built
C++ program capable of generating novel genotypes in
real time and assigning sex and fitness dynamically.
Examples of genotype frequency dynamics for simulations leading to both recruitment and protected polymorphism are shown in Additional file 4.
For each of the eight network mutations, 10,000 independent evolutionary simulations were performed, with
a set of random parameter values (for h, k, wM, and wF)
which remain fixed for the entire duration of each simulation. A uniform distribution is assumed for all parameters. For h, we assume the biologically realistic range
(1.6,4.6) observed for a wide range of behavior in vitro
in the lac operon (Table 1 and [60]). For k, we adopted
the range (0,3), since no interesting behavior is observed
for higher values (see Figure 2). For both wM and wF we
use the range (-1/2,1/2) to avoid negative fitness values
ˆ
[the range for ΔS D is (-2,+2)]. The sex determination
threshold θ is calculated once h and k are known and
remains fixed throughout the simulation. Separate
experiments were performed for different strengths of
the regulatory allele A (i.e. TA = -1 or +1). In the main
text we only report the case TA = +1 (i.e. high constitutive expression) as the other case is qualitatively equivalent; see Additional file 5 (TA= -1).
