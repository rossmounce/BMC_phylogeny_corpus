Abstract
Background: Colorants derived from natural sources look set to overtake synthetic colorants in market
value as manufacturers continue to meet the rising demand for clean label ingredients – particularly in food
applications. Many ascomycetous fungi naturally synthesize and secrete pigments and thus provide readily
available additional and/or alternative sources of natural colorants that are independent of agro-climatic
conditions. With an appropriately selected fungus; using in particular chemotaxonomy as a guide, the fungal
natural colorants could be produced in high yields by using the optimized cultivation technology. This
approach could secure efficient production of pigments avoiding use of genetic manipulation.
Results: Polyketide pigment producing ascomycetous fungi were evaluated for their potential as
production organisms based on a priori knowledge on species-specific pigment and potential mycotoxin
production and BioSafety level (BSL) classification. Based on taxonomic knowledge, we pre-selected
ascomycetous fungi belonging to Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium that produced yellow, orange or red
pigments while deselecting Penicillium marneffei; a well known human pathogen in addition to other
mycotoxigenic fungi belonging to the same group. We identified 10 strains belonging to 4 species; viz. P.
purpurogenum, P. aculeatum, P. funiculosum, and P. pinophilum as potential pigment producers that produced
Monascus-like pigments but no known mycotoxins. The selection/deselection protocol was illustrated in
the pigment extracts of P. aculeatum IBT 14259 and P. crateriforme IBT 5015 analysed by HPLC-DAD-MS.
In addition, extracellular pigment producing ability of some of the potential pigment producers was
evaluated in liquid media with a solid support and N-glutarylmonascorubramine was discovered in the
partially purified pigment extract of P. purpurogenum IBT 11181 and IBT 3645.
Conclusion: The present work brought out that the use of chemotaxonomic tools and a priori knowledge
of fungal extrolites is a rational approach towards selection of fungal polyketide pigment producers
considering the enormous chemical diversity and biodiversity of ascomycetous fungi. This rationale could
be very handy for the selection of potentially safe fungal cell factories not only for polyketide pigments but
also for the other industrially important polyketides; the molecular and genetic basis for the biosynthesis
of which has not yet been examined in detail. In addition, 4 out of the 10 chemotaxonomically selected
promising Penicillium strains were shown to produce extracellular pigments in the liquid media using a solid
support indicating future cell factory possibilities for polyketide natural food colorants.

Background
Due to the global increase in the manufacture of processed foods and the continued consumer demands for
natural food ingredients, the market for natural colorants
for food use is estimated to grow [1]. Currently, the vast
majority of the natural food colorants permitted in the
European Union and the United States are derived by
extraction of the pigments from raw materials obtained
from the flowering-plants of the kingdom Plantae [2]. The
production of many existing natural colorants of plant
origin has a disadvantage of dependence on the supply of
raw materials, which are influenced by agro-climatic conditions – in addition, their chemical profile may vary from
batch-to-batch. Moreover, many of the pigments derived
from the contemporary sources are sensitive to heat, light,
and oxygen, and some may even change their colour in
response to pH changes as in case of anthocyanins [3].
Many ascomycetous fungi naturally synthesize and secrete
pigments and may thus provide a more reliable source for
natural, "organic" food colorants with improved functionalities [4]. The diversity of fungal pigments is not only
found in their chemical structures but also in the colour
range of these pigments that may add new or additional
hues to the colour palette of the existing colorants derived
from contemporary sources [5].
With an appropriately selected fungus the fungal natural
colorants; unlike flowering plants, plant cell or algal
sources of colorants, could be produced in high yields by
using the available cultivation technology without potential genetic manipulation as tougher legislation and sceptical attitude of consumers make it rather difficult for the
acceptance of genetically modified food. The controlled
cultivation of pigment producing fungi in bioreactors has
the potential to compete with any other means of production and can potentially provide unlimited quantities of
colourings provided that imperative toxicological studies
are carried out. However, a first requirement is that the
potential fungus producing the pigment(s) is non-toxigenic under the given broader range of production conditions and is non-pathogenic to humans. The ability of
filamentous fungi to co-produce mycotoxins along with
industrially useful extrolites, e.g. as in case of citrinin produced by some of the pigment and statin producing
Monascus species [6], is a major bottleneck in their
approval by the legislative authorities. Some of the pigment producers, for instance, Penicillium marneffei, could
even be human pathogens [7]. Different cultivation media
have been shown to induce production of different pigments [5]; a systematic evaluation of the effect of different
media components on pigment production – and/or a
better understanding of the factors inducing pigment production in fungi – is currently highly warranted in order
to optimize the pigment production.

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/24

Another challenge in the fungal production of pigments
to be used as natural colorants is whether the pigment
producer is able to produce pigments in the liquid media
or not. Fungal pigments like most other secondary metabolites are preferably produced on solid substrates as these
substrates provide support for the fungal mycelia. Therefore, we employed a combination of solid and liquid cultivation technology whereby the fungal mycelia were
allowed to grow on a solid support like Lightweight
Expanded Clay Aggregates (LECA). The use of LECA has
been described as fungal support matrix by Nielsen et al.
[8]. Another advantage in this technique was the easier
separation of biomass and the fermentation broth with
secreted pigments.
Thus, it is of utmost importance to address the question of
how to rationally select a promising fungal pigment producer – meeting the above requirements – considering the
enormous chemical and biodiversity of fungi. Moreover,
the molecular and genetic basis for the polyketide pigment biosynthesis in fungi have not yet been examined in
detail leaving genomic approaches for screening unfeasible at this point of time.
In the light of this, we provide a comprehensive list, based
on chemotaxonomy, of a majority of the polyketide pigment producing ascomycetous fungi, their pigment composition, and the toxigenic potential with a list of known
coloured as well as uncoloured toxic metabolites. Based
on taxonomic knowledge, we focussed on pigment producing ascomycetous fungi belonging to Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium that produced yellow-orange-red
pigments while human pathogenic and mycotoxigenic
strains belonging to the same group were deselected. We
exemplify our chemotaxonomic selection and/or de-selection approach in two Penicillia viz. Penicillium aculeatum
and Penicillium crateriforme grown on 5 different complex
solid media to identify potential pigment producers that
produced known pigments with or without mycotoxin.
The aim of this study was to prove the pertinent use of
chemotaxonomic trait of metabolite profiling by powerful tools as HPLC-DAD-MS to come up with promising
polyketide pigment producing cell factories that are neither known to be human pathogens nor to produce any
known mycotoxins. The ultimate goal is to establish such
potentially safe fungal cell factories for the production of
polyketide natural colorants. In addition, we also evaluated 4 potential pigment producers for their pigment producing ability in the liquid media using solid support.

Chemotaxonomic selection/de-selection for potential
polyketide pigment producing ascomycetous fungi

of pigments and mycotoxins at our research center. The
major pigment profiles are listed in Table 1 with citations
to relevant literature at the species level [4,5,9-23]. In
addition to the well-known pigment producing Monascus
species used in Asia many species of Fusarium, Alternaria,
and Epicoccum are also polyketide pigment producers, and
strains from these genera have also been profiled at our
research center. Detailed profiles are listed in Table 2 with
relevant citations at the species level [5,24-28]. To illustrate the diversity and the potential of possible pigments
producers Table 2 also gives citations to pigment production by Cladosporium, Cordyceps, Curvularia, Drechslera and
Paecilomyces species [4,29-31]. This a priori knowledge on
potential mycotoxin production and the evaluation of
pathogenic potential on the basis of BioSafety Level (BSL)
classification [32] formed the basis of our pre-selection/
deselection of pigment producers. Strains of the species
belonging to Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium (Table 1)
were known to produce copious amounts of yellow,
orange and red pigments on solid media; one of the representative red pigment producers is shown in Figure 1.
These strains of the species were chosen to be studied. We
deselected strains of the 4 species viz. P. islandicum, P.
marneffei, P. variabile and P. rugulosum including the teleomorph Talaromyces macrosporus being either pathogenic
and/or mycotoxigenic. We screened 11 strains belonging
to the rest of the 5 species viz. P. purpurogenum, P. crateriforme, P. aculeatum, P. funiculosum, and P. pinophilum
where by P. crateriforme served as a positive control in
which the presence of mycotoxin was known a priori but
the pigment was still uncharacterized. The chromatographic analyses of two representative pigment extracts
that illustrate our selection/de-selection approach are presented in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4. Figure 2 depicts
the extracted ion chromatogram (m/z 269.12) obtained
by positive ESI chromatography using authentic standard
of rugulovasine A and B. The pigment extracts of Penicillium crateriforme IBT 5015 grown on CYA (Figure 2B),
MEA (Figure 2C), PD (Figure 2D), OAT (Figure 2E), and
YES (Figure 2F) media were found to be positive for the
presence of rugulovasine A and B. Figure 3 depicts the
absence of rugulovasine A and B in the pigment extracts of
Penicillium aculeatum IBT 14259 grown on YES (Figure
3B), PD (Figure 3C), OAT (Figure 3D), MEA (Figure 3E),
and CYA (Figure 3F). Both of these Penicillia were found
to produce a well-known orange Monascus pigment,
monascorubrin, in CYA as shown in Figure 4B and Figure
4C by means of the extracted ion chromatogram (m/z
383.19) and mass spectrum, obtained by positive ESI
chromatography using authentic standard. Since Penicillium crateriforme IBT 5015 produced rugulovasine A and B,
in addition to rubratoxin, and spiculisporic acid [9], it was
deselected, while Penicillium aculeatum IBT 14259 was
selected. The rest of the 10 strains (Table 3) were found to
produce known Monascus-like azaphilone pigments but

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/24

none of the known mycotoxins such as rubratoxin, luteoskyrin, islanditoxin, rugulosin, cyclochlorotine, erythroskyrin, emodin, spiculisporic acid, and rugulovasine A
and B associated with this group of fungi [9]. To the best
of our knowledge, the genes or the enzymes involved in
the biosynthesis of the above-mentioned mycotoxins are
not yet characterized.
New potentially safe fungal cell factories for the
production of Monascus-like pigments
Table 3 brings out 7 strains (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 in Table
3) as novel producers of Monascus-like azaphilone
polyketide based pigments such as ankaflavin, monascin,
monascorubrin, monascorubramine, PP-R, N-glutarylmonascorubramine, and N-glutarylrubropunctamine
(Figure 5), in addition to the 3 strains (1, 8 and 10 in
Table 3) reported previously [5,33]. None of these strains
were found to produce any known mycotoxins in the
mentioned media and under the lab conditions of pigment production. Notably four of the strains tested so far
(Table 3), have been found to produce extracellular pigments in the liquid media with LECA as a solid support.
For the first time, N-glutarylmonascorubramine and Nglutarylrubropunctamine; the two known water-soluble
Monascus-pigments were discovered in the extracellular
pigment extract obtained from the liquid medium (N1) of
P. purpurogenum IBT 11181 (Figure 6). The identity was
based on the UV-vis and mass spectra (Figure 6). N-glutarylmonascorubramine was also discovered in the extracellular pigment extract of P. purpurogenum IBT 3645
obtained from the liquid medium (N2) as shown in Figure 7.

Discussion
Chemotaxonomic selection/de-selection for potential
polyketide pigment producing ascomycetous fungi
The strains of the species in Table 1 and Table 2 are yet to
be investigated as potential production strains on different solid and in liquid media. Some of them may be
promising as potentially safe cell factories for pigments
with an array of different colors indicating that a lot more
fungal biodiversity is yet to be explored for the discovery
of novel sources of natural colorants. Epicoccum nigrum
(Table 2) has been evaluated for pigment production [34],
and Penicillium herquei (Table 1) has been partially evaluated (data unpublished). They could be potential cell factories for natural green-yellow to yellow colorants.
Biosynthetically, a majority of pigments produced by filamentous fungi are polyketide-based (some may involve
polyketide-amino acid mixed biosynthesis) and involve
complex pathways catalysed by iterative type I polyketide
synthases as exemplified in case of pigments produced by
Monascus ruber [35]. A complete knowledge about the biosynthetic pathway of polyketide pigments including the
extensively studied Monascus pigments is not yet available.

1 BSL-1:

saprobes or plant pathogens occupying non-vertebrate ecological niches, or commensals. Infections are coincidental, superficial, and noninvasive or mild. BSL-2: Species principally occupying non-vertebrate ecological niches, but with a relatively pronounced ability to survive in
vertebrate tissue. In severely immuno-compromised patients they may cause deep opportunistic mycoses. Also pathogens causing superficial
infections are in this category.
2 Keys to selection; Yes: preselected as a possible source of pigments, No: not selected as a possible source of pigments, TBI: to be investigated as
a possible source of pigments.
The a priori major metabolite profiles and the BioSafety Level (BSL) classification of the fungal species are highlighted and form the basis for
selection/de-selection of the species as a potential source of pigment production.

Also, genomic approaches of selection of potential
polyketide pigment producers may not be useful at this
point of time when none of the fungal polyketide pigment
producers are fully genome sequenced yet. Moreover, the
problem of annotating correct gene sequences is not to be
overlooked especially due to the variation in the domain
of polyketide synthases; two or more polyketide synthases
are involved in the biosynthesis of such complex secondary metabolites as pigments. Chemotaxonomy uses secondary metabolite profiles of filamentous fungi as the
secondary metabolites have a differentiation capability at
a genus and species level [36]. This has been used successfully and resulted in a lot of a priori knowledge about filamentous fungi – their bio- and chemical diversity,
ecological niche, the species-specific metabolite profiles,
and optimal media and growth conditions for secondary
metabolites (including pigments) production [37]. Phylogeny as a taxonomic tool, whereby the partial sequences
of the household genes such as β-tubulin are used, on the
other hand, cannot predict the functional trait of the
organisms as described by Samson et al. [38]. Therefore,
chemotaxonomic selection would form an essential element of high throughput screening programmes as the
use of a priori knowledge of species-specific metabolite/
pigment and/or mycotoxin profiles ensures a quick and
efficient way of selecting potentially safe pigment producers from a vast bio- and chemodiversity of filamentous
fungi. The purpose of the present work was to demon-

strate the chemotaxonomic selection and de-selection
approach in the pigment producing fungi whereby specific mycotoxin production was shown in the producer or
the non-producer in addition to the a priori knowledge of
their mycotoxin and pigment profile. Thus, the starting
point of our selection approach was the use of chemotaxonomic knowledge about the polyketide pigment producing fungi (Table 1 and Table 2). We used this as a key to
show that only a handful of pigment producers are worth
exploring as potentially safe fungal cell factories for
polyketide pigment production (Table 3). The LC-DADMS was successfully used as a powerful tool to check the
presence or the absence of mycotoxins using authentic
standard in the run and to identify pigments based on UVvis and mass spectra. Since, pigments have characteristic
UV-vis spectra, the use of UV-vis spectra in the identification and de-replication was shown to be quite handy. The
two examples (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4), not only
demonstrated our chemotaxonomic selection/de-selection approach but also proved the use of LC-DAD-MS as
an efficient chemotaxonomic tool. To the best of our
knowledge, this unique and rational approach is not yet
demonstrated as a selection criterion for fungal cell factories. Thus, it signifies our findings to emphasize on the
appropriate use of chemotaxonomy in the discovery of
novel and potentially safe cell factories for the industrially
useful polyketides including pigments for food use. However, the toxicological studies are still imperative for the

final approval of the product and the process that would
entail the use of these pre-selected potentially safe cell factories especially for the food use.
New potentially safe fungal cell factories for the
production of Monascus-like pigments
Several of the already known Monascus-like pigments
(Table 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5) were identified in Penicillium species that do not produce any known mycotoxins
when grown under the laboratory conditions used in this
study. It could be noted that these Penicillia are closely
related according to Raper and Thom [39], and Pitt [40]
and that they are also closely related according to phylogenetic principles [41] but distantly related to Monascus
species.

The production of extracellular pigments by some of the
tested cell factories in the liquid media using a solid support has added to the value of these cell factories as future
production strains. N-glutarylmonascorubramine and Nglutarylrubropunctamine have been reported as watersoluble extracellular pigments of Monascus ruber [42-44].
The identification of N-glutarylmonascorubramine was
based on mass and UV-vis spectra that matched quite well
with the previous reports [42,44]. The mass spectra of Nglutarylrubropunctamine matched very well with the one
reported by Hajjaj et al. [44]. The UV-vis spectrum of Nglutarylrubropunctamine was very similar to that of Nglutarylmonascorubramine as the two compounds dif-

fered only in their aliphatic side chain. Multiple extracellular pigments (Figure 6 and Figure 7) were formed from
a complex nitrogen source such as yeast extract (as in case
of N1 medium) or a combination of such complex nitrogen sources as corn steep liquor and yeast extract (as in
case of N2 medium) and rubropunctatin and/or monascorubrin in the media possibly by Schiff base formation
type of reaction mechanism. This mechanism was
reported previously [42,44] for the formation of these
water soluble pigments from their counter parts which are
aminophilic in nature being azaphilones. Hajjaj et al. [44]
reported the formation of 4 pigment molecules that constituted 91% of the pigment production when only one
nitrogen source (monosodium glutamate) in the medium
was used with 20 g/L glucose. Our results indicate formation of much more than 4 pigment components for both
of the tested Penicillia (Figure 6 and Figure 7) possibly
due to the availability of several amino acids from the
complex nitrogen source/s provided in the media. Thus,
in the future it is possible to obtain desired number of pigment components by using defined nitrogen sources that
would provide specific amino acid/s moiety to be incor-

porated into the azaphilone pigments to form water soluble extracellular pigments. As these water soluble
extracellular pigments are more stable than their orange
counterparts [45], this is very significant for the biotechnological production of such natural colorants in these
newly discovered cell factories Thus it can be inferred that
the discovery of such potentially safe cell factories for
polyketide natural food colorants using chemotaxonomic
approach is a milestone that would redefine the biotechnological production of food colorants derived from such
an agro-independent source of colorants as filamentous
fungi. Moreover, this also can tackle the current issue of
restricted use of Monascus pigments due to the co-production of toxic metabolites.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that the use of chemotaxonomic tools and a priori knowledge of fungal extrolites is
a rational approach towards selection of potentially safe
polyketide natural colorant producing fungal cell factories
considering the enormous chemical diversity and biodiversity of ascomycetous fungi. This approach could be

very handy for the selection of potentially safe fungal cell
factories not only for polyketide pigments but also for the
other industrially important polyketides; the molecular
and genetic basis for the biosynthesis of which has not yet
been examined in detail. In addition, 4 out of the 10
chemotaxonomically selected promising Penicillium
strains were shown to produce extracellular pigments in
the liquid media using a solid support; two of the pigments were identified as Monascus pigment derivatives Nglutarylrubropunctamine and N-glutarylmonascorubramine, by means of LC-DAD-MS chromatography.
Work is underway for the evaluation of a few of these
promising cell factories for the controlled and robust production of such polyketide natural food colorants.

media viz; Yeast extract sucrose (YES) agar; Malt extract

The cultures were incubated in the dark at 25°C for 7 days.

used for Penicillium purpurogenum IBT 3645. The initial pH
of the medium was adjusted to 5.5 using 0.1 M HCl.
Approximately 8–9 grams of Light Expanded Clay Aggregates (LECA) were used as solid support retained within a
tea paper filter (Schur Inventure A/S, Vejle, Denmark,

extra fine pores capacity 16.5 g/m2, locally purchased)
and sterilized by autoclaving. Spores harvested from a
week old culture plate (CYA) with a concentration (3 ×
105/ml) were inoculated directly onto the LECA contained within the tea filter, which was then transferred
into 300 ml baffled Erlenmeyer culture flasks comprising
100 mL of the N1 or N2 media. The experiment was performed in duplicate. The cultures were incubated at 25°C
in the dark under shaking conditions (120 rpm).
Extraction of fungal pigments
In case of solid media, extraction was carried out by a
modified version of the micro-scale extraction method
[47], where 6 mm plugs were extracted ultrasonically with
solvent containing ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, and
methanol in a ratio of 3:2:1 (v/v/v) with 1% formic acid.
The extract was evaporated to dryness in a rotational vacuum concentrator (RVC; Christ Martin, Osterode, Germany). Residue was re-dissolved in 400 μL methanol, in

This extract was used for chromatographic analysis.
In case of liquid media with solid support, after 7 days of
incubation the tea filter comprising the majority of the
fungal biomass adhered to LECA was removed from the
flask and the fermentation broth containing extracellular
pigments was filtered through Whatman filter paper # 1 to
remove the residual biomass.
Evaluation of pigment composition from the fermentation
broth
The filtrate was subject to clean-up by solid phase extraction Strata-X-C 33 μm cation mixed mode polymer columns (60 mg 1 mL, Phenomenex, Torrence, California,
USA). 1.2 mL of methanol was used for conditioning followed by 1.2 mL of distilled water for calibration. 1.2 mL
of samples, acidified with 0.1% phosphoric acid (1: 6 v/v)
were loaded in a vacuum manifold, and washed with
0.1% phosphoric acid. Elution of the pigment mixture,
bound in the matrix of the cartridges, was carried out
using methanol which could elute neutral and acidic components. The pigment extract so obtained was subjected to
high resolution LC-DAD-MS analysis.
Chromatographic analysis
High-resolution LC-DAD-MS was performed on an Agilent HP 1100 liquid chromatograph (LC) system with a
photodiode array detector (DAD) and a 50 × 2 mm i.d., 3
μm, Luna C18 II column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA).

The LC system was coupled to a LCT orthogonal time-offlight mass spectrometer (Waters-Micromass, Manchester,
U.K.) with a Z-spray electrospray ionization (ESI) source,
and a LockSpray probe and controlled by the MassLynx
4.0 software. MS system was operated in the positive ESI
mode using a water-acetonitrile gradient system starting
from 15% acetonitrile, which was increased linearly to
100% in 20 minutes with a holding time of 5 minutes.
The water was buffered with 10 mM ammonium formate
and 20 mM formic acid and the acetonitrile with 20 mM
formic acid. The instrument was tuned to a resolution >
7000 (at half peak height). The method is well established
at our research center for the metabolite profiling of filamentous fungi grown on solid media. It is described by
Nielsen et al. [48].
For the extracellular pigments extracted from the liquid
media, the solvent system used was water with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient started from 5% acetonitrile and increased to 100%
in 20 minutes and was hold at 100% for 2 minutes. The
MS conditions were the same as mentioned earlier.
Analysis of LC-DAD-MS Data
The coloured components in the pigment extract were
detected in the UV-vis chromatogram of 390–700 nm.
The identification of N-glutarylmonascorubramine and
N-glutarylrubropunctamine was based on both UV-vis
and mass spectra from total ion chromatogram (m/z 100–
900) from positive ion electro spray. The UV-vis spectrum
was obtained after background subtraction. The DAD-MS

N-glutarylmonascorubramine was detected as m/z 512.23
[M + H]+and confirmed by the adducts m/z 534.22 [M +
Na]+ and m/z 575.26 [M + Na + CH3CN]+. The UV-vis
spectrum was λmax: 212, with a shoulder at 272, 420 and
504.

N-glutarylrubropunctamine was detected as m/z 484.20
[M + H]+and confirmed by the adducts m/z 506.21 [M +
Na]+ and m/z 547.22 [M + Na + CH3CN]+. The UV-vis
spectrum was λmax: 200, 250, 274, 430 and 522.
