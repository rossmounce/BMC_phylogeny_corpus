Abstract
Background: Adherent and invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are commonly found in ileal lesions of Crohn’s Disease
(CD) patients, where they adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and invade into and survive in epithelial cells and
macrophages, thereby gaining access to a typically restricted host niche. Colonization leads to strong inflammatory
responses in the gut suggesting that AIEC could play a role in CD immunopathology. Despite extensive
investigation, the genetic determinants accounting for the AIEC phenotype remain poorly defined. To address this,
we present the complete genome sequence of an AIEC, revealing the genetic blueprint for this disease-associated
E. coli pathotype.
Results: We sequenced the complete genome of E. coli NRG857c (O83:H1), a clinical isolate of AIEC from the ileum
of a Crohn’s Disease patient. Our sequence data confirmed a phylogenetic linkage between AIEC and
extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli causing urinary tract infections and neonatal meningitis. The comparison of the
NRG857c AIEC genome with other pathogenic and commensal E. coli allowed for the identification of unique
genetic features of the AIEC pathotype, including 41 genomic islands, and unique genes that are found only in
strains exhibiting the adherent and invasive phenotype.
Conclusions: Up to now, the virulence-like features associated with AIEC are detectable only phenotypically. AIEC
genome sequence data will facilitate the identification of genetic determinants implicated in invasion and
intracellular growth, as well as enable functional genomic studies of AIEC gene expression during health and
disease.

Background
Crohn’s Disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel
disease of the intestinal tract characterized by a strong
activation of the intestinal immune system. A complex
interaction of genetic, immunologic, and environmental
factors contribute to the immunopathology of CD but
despite intensive investigation over the last half-century,
a unifying etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)
has not been uncovered [1,2]. Abundant clinical and
experimental data implicate luminal bacteria or bacterial
products in both the initiation and perpetuation of

chronic intestinal inflammation [2-4]. Some pathological
manifestations observed in CD, including ulcers of the
mucosa, mural abscesses and macrophage recruitment
and activation, also occur in well-recognized infectious
diseases caused by Shigella, Salmonella and Yersinia, in
which invasion into mucosal epithelial cells is an important virulence trait [3]. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that the balance between host defence
responses and the commensal microbiota plays a key
role in the pathogenesis of IBD [2]. Patients with CD
display an increased number of coliforms in their feces,
particularly during periods of active disease [5] and
E. coli antigens are found in most intestinal resection
specimens from these patients [6]. Furthermore, it has
been shown that early and chronic ileal lesions of CD
patients harbour high levels of E. coli that might

participate in disease pathogenesis [7-11]. E. coli strains
isolated from the ileal lesions of CD patients can exhibit
adherent and invasive capabilities in both gastrointestinal epithelial cells and macrophages [10,12], a phenotype that was the basis for a new pathogenic group
called adherent and invasive E. coli (AIEC) [12,13].
AIEC are enriched in ileal lesions in human CD [7] and
are associated with expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation in mice expressing human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule
(CEACAM) receptors [14]. The predominance of AIEC
in human CD patients, in conjunction with a growing
body of biological and animal model data [15] has generated intense interest into the possible role of AIEC in
the initiation or maintenance of chronic inflammation
associated with CD.
We previously reported on a clinical AIEC isolate with
serotype O83:H1 (strain NRG857c) that was isolated
from the terminal ileum of a patient with CD [16].
NRG857c belongs to the same serogroup as the historical AIEC isolate called LF82 first described over a decade ago [10] for which much of the experimental data
on AIEC phenotypes have been documented. AIEC do
not harbour common virulence factors found in various
other pathogenic E. coli, and so the genetic basis for
their invasive phenotype, proinflammatory nature and
association with CD are not fully understood. Here, we
report the complete genome sequence of AIEC
NRG857c that includes a 150-kb plasmid. We found
that AIEC are closely related to a group of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) associated with urinary
tract infections and neonatal meningitis, a finding that
confirms and extends previous work [17]. The comparison of this genome with other ExPEC, enteropathogenic
E. coli, AIEC LF82, and commensal E. coli facilitated the
identification of 41 high-confidence genomic islands and
66 genes unique to E. coli displaying the adherent and
invasive phenotype.

Results and Discussion
Genome sequencing and gap closure

AIEC strain NRG857c was shotgun sequenced to 40fold coverage using pyrosequencing. Assembly of the
raw sequence data generated 48 contiguous regions
(contigs) greater than 2-kb with a total size of 4.84Mb. Contigs were assembled by aligning the larger
contigs to an optical restriction map using MapSolver
and by BLASTX analysis of contigs ends. The majority
of gaps between contigs were identified because contigs ends were syntenic with single-copy genes in previously sequenced E. coli genomes. PCR primers were
designed to amplify across these gaps followed by
sequencing to generate “super-contigs” (see Additional
File 1, Figure S1). Final gap closure was achieved after

Page 2 of 15

incorporation of sequence data for the seven ribosomal
RNA operons. Plasmid contigs were identified by
BLASTX analysis. Gap closure for the plasmid was
done using BLASTN analysis of the terminal sequences
from which PCR primers were designed. Amplification
and sequencing of these regions resulted in the assembly, but not closure, of a single plasmid contig.
General features of the NRG857c AIEC genome

The chromosome of NRG857c is 4,747,819 bp (50.68% G +
C content), encoding 4,431 genes (Figure 1, Table 1). The
plasmid is 147,060 bp (50.92 G+C content) and encodes
155 genes (Table 1). The sequence of both the NRG857c
chromosome and plasmid has been deposited in GenBank
[GenBank: CP001855, GenBank: CP001856].
Phylogenetic position of NRG857c

The phylogeny of AIEC NRG857c was resolved in two
ways. First, a phylogenetic tree based on the optical map
data was constructed using the unweighted pair group
method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) along with the
in silico derived NcoI fragments for other sequenced
E. coli strains (Figure 2A). The second method involved
multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) with seven housekeeping genes as described previously [18] (Figure 2B;
Additional File 2, Table S1), followed by comparison to
sequences from other strains [19]. In both analyses
NRG857c clustered with avian pathogenic E. coli
(APEC-O1), and the uropathogenic E. coli isolates 536
and CFT073. Also in this group was LF82, another
AIEC strain of the same serotype as NRG857c (O83:H1)
whose genome sequence was retrieved from Genoscope
(http://www.genoscope.cns.fr see note added in revision). LF82 shows high sequence similarity to our strain
as analyzed by MapSolver (Additional File 3, Figure S2),
by BLASTN analysis (Figure 1), and by phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 2).
A general comparison of the total genome content of
NRG857c with several other E. coli pathotypes is
shown in Table 1. The majority of human ExPEC
belong to phylogenetic group B2 and are categorized
based on their clinical spectrum of disease, including
urinary tract infections (UPEC) and neonatal meningitis (NMEC) [20-23]. AIEC strains cluster genetically
with ExPEC and share some of their phenotypic traits
including the ability to colonize mucosal epithelial
cells, invade eukaryotic host cells, and to induce
inflammatory responses in host animals [24,25].
Although the prototype EPEC strain E2348/69 (serotype O127:H6) and other EPEC strains belong to the
same phylogenetic group as the ExPEC strains [26],
they are not generally considered to be invasive organisms. However, recent data suggests that at least two
type III secreted proteins (EspT and EspF) can

strand) was compared with those of selected E. coli strains, starting from the outer layer LF82 (AIEC; pale green), APEC-O1 (APEC; blue), CFT073
(UPEC; yellow), MG1655 (K12/commensal; purple) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 Sakai (EHEC, red). Genomic islands were plotted on the

facilitate EPEC invasion into non-phagocytic cells and
may define a new category of invasive EPEC [27,28].
Genomic islands and unique sequences
associated with AIEC

Genomic islands (GI) comprise a horizontally acquired
flexible gene pool that is a major driver in evolution and
niche specialization of pathogenic bacteria [29]. Recent
computational methods that take advantage of genetic

signatures indicative of horizontal gene transfer enable
the high-confidence prediction of GIs in annotated bacterial genomes [30]. To identify putative genomic islands
in NRG857c, we used IslandViewer, which uses three
independent methods for island prediction, IslandPick,
IslandPath-DIMOB and SIGI-HMM. Using the methods
and established thresholds described previously [31], we
identified 35 genomic islands (GI-1 to GI-35) on the
NRG857c chromosome ranging from 4 to 25-kb, with

G+C content differing significantly from genome mean
and with poor conservation among the other non-AIEC
pathotypes shown in Figure 1 (see Additional File 4,
Table S2 for full list of genomic islands and gene content analysis). We limited our comparative analysis here
to the strains most related to NRG857c and to two
well-described E. coli strains of commensal and pathogenic nature. The conservation of these 35 islands
between NRG8578c and LF82 was high, suggesting that
they may encode traits unique to the adherent and invasive phenotype. Five of the genomic islands (GI-6, -7, -8,
-10 and -16) code for defective prophages, three (GI-14,
-22, -29) are fimbrial islands, and three (GI-20, -26 and
-30) appear to be involved in lipopolysaccharide or capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis. GI-23 is noteworthy
because it encodes an EmrKY-TolC multidrug resistance
efflux pump and the sensor kinase, EvgA, involved in
acid resistance and multidrug resistance in E. coli [32].
GI-15 and GI-19 appear to be metabolic islands
involved in the transport and metabolism of various
sugars. An additional six genomic islands were identified
on the large plasmid (PI-1 to PI-6 in Figure 3) (see
Additional File 4, Table S2 for full list of plasmid islands
and gene content analysis).
To date, restriction profiles or other biased analyses
such as pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), MLST or
typing for known virulence genes common to intestinal
pathogenic E. coli have failed to uncover unique genetic
determinants implicated in the AIEC phenotype [17].
To begin to identify single genetic determinants unique
to AIEC, we carried out whole-genome comparisons
between NRG857c, LF82, and 29 other non-AIEC

genomes of E. coli. NRG857c and LF82 show considerable sequence similarity and synteny (Additional File 3,
Figure S2) with 46 chromosomal genes unique to
NRG857c and 10 chromosomal genes unique to LF82
(see Additional File 5, Table S3 for full list of genes
unique to AIEC). The large plasmids from NRG857c
and LF82 show almost no conservation between them
(see below), suggesting that they have different ancestry.
Panseq, a Web-based tool designed to analyse the
“pan-genome” of closely-related genome sequences, was
used to identify genes common to AIEC strains
NRG857c and LF82, but absent in other members of
this phylogenetic cluster (i.e. APEC-O1, 536, and
CFT073). We programmed Panseq to find unique
sequences of at least 2-kb present in NRG857c and
LF82 but absent in APEC-O1, 536 and CFT073. In this
analysis, we found 21 sequences with a combined length
of 155-kb that are unique to AIEC strains. Several of
these sequences code for prophage elements including a
19.7-kb region encoding the morphogenesis and packaging modules of a P22-like prophage (NRG857_04720 NRG857_04815). A second interesting region of 47.2-kb
extends, with one interruption, from NRG857_09990 to
NRG857_10240 and codes for several proteins involved
in intermediary metabolism including transport of propanol/propanediol and galactitol. BLASTN analysis of
this region revealed two sub-regions, one 20.3-kb and
the other 4.4-kb, which are not found in the complete
genome sequence of any other E. coli strain. The latter
region shows 71% sequence coverage to a region from
the complete genome of Citrobacter rodentium ICC168,
while approximately half of the longer sequence is also

representative strains of other enteric bacteria. (A) A
phylogenetic tree based on the unweighted pair group method
with arithmetic mean was constructed from the optimal map data
and in silico NcoI restriction digests of other enteric bacterial
chromosomes. (B) MLST-based analysis of NRG857c with other
enteric bacteria was performed as described in the Methods and
sequence data was used to construct a phylogenetic tree. Numbers

found in an uncharacterized E. coli strain ATCC 8739.
This 10.7-kb region has no nucleotide similarity with any
other fully sequenced bacterium. BLASTX revealed similarity in this region to two hypothetical Vibrio coralliilyticus ATCC BAA-450 proteins [GenBank: ZP_05883689,

The 150-kb plasmid in NRG857c is different from the
plasmid found in LF82. Whereas plasmid pNRG857c
shows significant regions of identity to plasmids in other
seropathotypes of E. coli, the 110-kb plasmid of strain
LF82 (pLF82) has very little similarity to pNRG857c or
pAPEC-O1 (APEC-O1), pColBM (APEC-O103), pUTI189
(UPEC UTI189) and pO157 Sakai (EHEC O157:H7) (Figure 4). The extrachromosomal plasmid in NRG857c is a
antimicrobial resistance plasmid with a suite of genes
encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, b-lactams, chloramphenicol, mercury, quaternary ammonium salts, sulfonamides, tetracycline, and trimethoprim, several of which
appear to be enclosed as transposon blocks. The plasmid
may be capable of conjugal transfer as it encodes several
tra genes, although we have not experimentally tested this.
In addition, there are genes for colicins M and V production and immunity. The antibiotic resistance genes are
clustered in three regions of the plasmid in PI-2, PI-3
and PI-4 (Figure 3B). The mercury resistance cassette is
identical to IS5075 found in IncA/C2 plasmids
pRYC103T24 [GenBank: GQ293500.1], pLEW517 [GenBank: DQ390455.1], NR1 [GenBank: DQ364638.1] and
R100 [GenBank: AP000342.1]. The b-lactam-macrolide
region is identical to sequences present in plasmid
pTZ3721 [GenBank: AB020531.1] and pTZ3723 [GenBank: AB038654.1]. Also of interest to us were several
genes involved in siderophore production and iron metabolism. Plasmid pNRG857c has the sitABCD operon that
encodes proteins involved in the periplasmic and inner
membrane transport of iron and manganese. Two outer
membrane proteins (IutA and FepA) are also encoded by
the plasmid and are involved in translocation of iron
across the membrane. IutA (NRG857_30235) is the ferricaerobactin receptor, while FepA (NRG857_30015) is an
iron-enterobactin outer membrane transporter, both of
which are involved in the tonB-dependent transport pathway for iron and also the OM receptor for the colicins
[33]. IutA and FepA are encoded on plasmids pAPECO103-ColBM, pAPEC-O1-ColBM, pCVM29188_146
(from Salmonella enterica serovar Kentucky, [34]), pVM01
(from the APEC strain E3, [35]), and pLVPK (from Klebsiella pneumoniae CG43, [36]). Interestingly, the chromosome contains a FepA paralog (NRG857_02640). The
presence of several iron-acquisition genes suggests that
Fur regulation of these plasmid-encoded genes occur
[37,38]. As predicted, the consensus DNA sequence for
Fur binding (WAATDRNWNYNAWTW) is found in
the upstream regulatory region, [39]) of the iroBCDE,

sitABCD, iucABCD-iutA operons, and the shiF and fepA
genes.
Identification of other potential virulence determinants

The chromosome of AIEC strain NRG857c encodes a
variety of potential virulence factors (Table 2). As mentioned above, the plasmid carries several potential virulence factors including genes for iron acquisition. This
would suggest that the plasmid contributes to the overall virulence of this bacterium, however we have demonstrated previously that a plasmid-cured variant was still
able to attach to and invade epithelial cells in vitro [16].
(i) Type VI secretion system

We identified genes for a complete type VI secretion
system (T6SS) that are associated with virulence in
other invasive organisms (Table 3) [40-42]. T6SS are
phage-related secretion systems found in many Gramnegative pathogens and are thought to be involved in
supporting an intracellular lifestyle, although their distribution is not restricted to pathogenic bacteria [43]. The
T6SS in NRG857c is found in GI-2, a low GC region of
the chromosome directly downstream from a tRNA
which is a common integration site for mobile genetic
elements. This T6SS island encodes the conserved core
elements of the secretion apparatus, including the
valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG/NRG857_01165),

the ClpV ATPase (NRG_01105) and the hemolysin
coregulated protein (Hcp/NRG857_01155) that is 100%
identical to Hcp in APEC-O1 and the UPEC strains
UT189 and 536. We also identified a second Hcp
upstream of this conserved locus (NRG_01080) that is
100% identical to Hcp in E. coli S88 (O45:K1:H7) that
causes neonatal meningitis [44], suggesting that this
T6SS island is a mosaic with different ancestries. Other
organisms, including Vibrio cholerae, have two hcp
genes in different parts of the genome [45], which may
impart different functionalities on the secretion apparatus. Whether the T6SS in AIEC facilitates intracellular
survival and/or growth will require additional experimentation that we are currently pursuing.
(ii) Adhesins

NRG857c contains genes that are important for adhesion
and invasion of AIEC LF82, including nlp1, htrA, yfgL,
and dsbA [46-49]. The SPAAN program [50] as well as
BLASTP with relaxed stringency was used to identify and
extensive list of additional predicted adhesins (Table 4).
The majority of the fimbrial operons in NRG857c are
found in other E. coli strains, with the exception of the
long polar fimbriae (Lpf; NRG857-17915-17923), which
might be important for tissue tropism. A second Auf fimbrial system with a potential role as a colonization factor
is encoded by genes NRG857_16960 through _17005.

Figure 4 Gene content analysis of plasmid pNRG857c and comparison to representative strains of other E. coli. BLASTN analysis was
performed between each CDS in plasmid pNRG857c against each CDS in pLF82, pO157Sakai, pUTI89, and pAPEC-O1-ColBM. Genes in pNRG857c
with orthologs in the other plasmids, defined as >85% identity over entire length of the gene, are connected with a coloured line.

Other potential mediators of invasion include a hemagglutinin/invasin (NRG857_17920 to _17923) and an Ibe
invasin (NRG857_21885 to _21890). In previous work,
the invasion of brain endothelial cells was found to be
mediated by the Ibe invasin, and was located on a genomic island called GimA [51]. The presence of GimA was
almost exclusive to ExPEC strains of phylogroup B2, and
we now show that ibe is also present in AIEC, suggesting
it may be involved in invasive properties of certain
strains.
In mouse models of AIEC-induced colitis, inflammation requires type I pili expression by the bacterial cells,

as no colitis is induced by ΔfimH mutant bacteria [14].
Colitis in this model requires the expression of human
CEACAM receptors by transgenic mice, suggesting that
the type I pili of AIEC can induce a proinflammatory
response via CEACAM receptors in the gut mucosa. In
support of this, FimH, the adhesin tip protein, is necessary but not sufficient for adhesion of AIEC strain LF82
to Intestine-407 cells [52]. Polymorphisms in the FimH
sequence have been identified in E. coli isolated from
IBD patients and healthy individuals. In particular,
7 amino acid variants are associated with E. coli from
IBD tissue and 2 variants are associated with E. coli

from healthy individuals [53]. Interestingly, FimH in
NRG857c contains two disease-associated amino acid
variants (N91S, S99N, and none of the SNPs associated
with healthy tissue (A48V, A140V). Whether or not
these variants are associated with different inflammatory
responses or subtle differences in adherence in vivo will
be important areas for future work.
(iii) Transcriptional regulators of virulence genes

NRG857c contains global transcriptional regulators
including phoP-phoQ, envZ-ompR, slyA and the negative
regulators hns, hha, and fis involved in genome architecture and transcriptional regulation [54]. Although these
transcriptional factors are common to many bacterial
species, in most Gram-negative pathogens they coordinate transcription of virulence genes including secretion
system, toxins, adhesins and flagellar biosynthesis
machinery [55,56]. With this completed genome
sequence, functional genomics approaches are now possible to understand the regulons of these transcription
factors and their roles in intracellular survival and
growth of AIEC. Indeed, Fis levels in the cell have
already been associated with regulating the adhesive
properties of AIEC strain LF82 [57].
(iv) Iron acquisition

Iron acquisition is an essential virulence trait in other
ExPEC and these systems are expressed during urinary
tract infections in vivo [58,59]. Since NRG875c had an
abundance of iron uptake systems, we designed experiments to test the role of iron acquisition during infection. We made an aerobactin transport mutant by
deletion of iutA and tested whether this iron transport
system was important for intracellular survival and the
ability to colonize animals. We found that the iutA
mutant was able to synthesize but not transport

aerobactin (Additional file 6, Table S4). To investigate
the invasive properties of ΔiutA, we conducted standard
gentamicin protection assays in J774.1 macrophage cells,
which did not reveal a significant difference in the
uptake at 2 h of the wild type and the iutA mutant
(Figure 5A). However, by 4 h after infection and thereafter, the iutA mutant had a significant defect in intracellular survival and/or replication compared to wild type
cells. To determine whether the transport of aerobactin
was important for bacterial infection in vivo, streptomycin pre-treated mice were infected with wild type
NRG857c and the isogenic iutA mutant as described previously for a Salmonella infection model [60]. Wild type
NRG857c was recovered in ~50-fold more abundance in
the intestinal tissue compared to ΔiutA (Figure 5B).

Conclusions
The two broad hypotheses accounting for the immunopathology of IBD, including deregulation of the intestinal immune system, and dysbiosis of the commensal
microbiota [61], are likely not mutually exclusive. Both
pathways could be operationalized at the same time and
in response to known genetic and environmental triggers. Regarding the genetic correlates of the AIEC phenotype, our genome sequence and comparative analyses
provide many testable hypotheses to uncover the adhesive, invasive, and proinflammatory nature of AIEC. The
fact that the 35 genomic islands in NRG857c are, in
many cases, highly orthologous in LF82 but weakly conserved or absent in other E. coli pathotypes and commensal organisms is suggestive that these genomic
islands may have an influential role in the expression of
the AIEC phenotype. It is also likely that evolved differences in gene expression, or regulatory evolution, has

played a pivotal role in generating phenotypic diversity
involved in pathogen-like behaviour of AIEC, as we have
shown previously for another intracellular pathogen
[62,63]. Functional genomics studies enabled by this
work will be forthcoming.

Methods
AIEC strain and genome sequencing

Escherichia coli AIEC strain NRC857c was isolated from
a biopsy of a Crohn’s disease patient at the Charite Hospital, Germany [16]. A mutant in aerobactin transport
(designated RAA002) was created by disruption of the
iutA gene using allelic exchange from a suicide plasmid
as described previously [64]. For preparation of genomic
DNA, wild type NRC857c cells were grown on solid
Luria-Bertani (LB) agar at 37°C. Genomic DNA was
extracted from 10 mg of bacteria scraped from a plate
using the BioRobot EZ1 with the EZ1 DNA kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). For plasmid purification, bacteria
were grown in 4 L of LB broth and plasmid was isolated
using a Maxi-prep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total
genomic DNA was sequenced using a Genome Sequencer FLX System (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA)
at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (Montreal, QC, Canada).
Phylotype grouping, optical mapping, and in silico
similarity clustering

Phylogenetic determinations were performed by in silico
MLST using seven housekeeping genes (aspC, clpX,
fadD, icdA, lysP, mdh and uidA). Analysis was performed using the software package MEGA4 [65,66] and
the Neighbour-Joining method under the Tajima-Nei

model. An optical map of NRG857c was generated
using the restriction enzyme NcoI (OpGen Inc., Madison,
WI) and used for contig ordering. Unweighted PairGroup Method using Arithmetic averages (UPGMA)
similarity clustering of the restriction fragments generated in the whole genome optical map of NRG857c with
in silico maps of publicly available E. coli isolates was performed using MapSolver version 2.1.1 (OpGen Inc.,
Madison, WI).
Gap closure

Outward facing primers annealing to adjacent contigs
were designed using Primer3Plus, synthesized by SigmaGenosys (Oakville, ON, Canada) and used to amplify
DNA of NRG857c using the Expand Long Template
PCR system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). PCR products were analysed on agarose gels, purified with a
Montage PCR purification kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA) and sequenced using Sanger sequencing (University of Guelph, ON, Canada). Finished sequence was
assembled using SeqManPro (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,
WI). For ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, primers were
designed using the syntenic flanking sequences of each
rRNA operon in the E. coli strain CFT073 [67]. These
seven rDNA amplicons were sequenced using the flanking primers and specifically designed 16S (rrs) and 23S
(rrl) primers based on sequence alignment with CFT073
rDNAs.
Genome annotation and in silico identification of genes
unique to AIEC strains, NRG957c and LF82

The genome sequence was subjected to automated
annotation using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic Annotation Pipeline with the resulting GenBank

data incorporated into Kodon (Applied Maths Inc., Austin, TX) for manual curation. A protein database was
constructed from 22 Escherichia coli genomes available
in GenBank. All of the open reading frames of
NRG857c predicted by Glimmer 3 [68] were searched
against the protein database using BLASTX running
locally [69]. The same comparison was performed using
the LF82 nucleotide sequences. A script written with the
BioPerl toolkit [70] was used to parse the BLAST output
files for sequences that did not have any matches, or
sequences with only weak matches using the criteria: (Evalue ≥ 0.01), or (Percent Identity < 50%), or (<50% of
the query length was used in the BLAST alignment).
The predicted ORFs of NRG857c were compared
against those of strain LF82 to identify those unique to
each strain. Additional comparative genomics analyses
were carried out using Panseq [71] and 29 publiclyavailable E. coli genome sequences (see Additional File
7, Table S5 for list of E. coli genomes and accession
numbers used for comparative analyses). The functions
of identified sequences were predicted using the annotation engine AutoFACT [72]. Circular genome atlases
were generated using CGView [73,74] or Circos [75].

well in DMEM with L-glutamine and 10% FBS for 16 h
prior to infection. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of
infection of 10 with wild type NRG857c or the iutA
mutant. Infected cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 h,
then washed and treated for 2 h with 100 μg/ml gentamicin. At various times post-infection, cells were washed
and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by
serial plating on LB agar. Gentamicin protection experiments were performed in triplicate and reported as the
percent survival with standard error with statistical significance determined by Student’s t test.
Mouse infections

All animal experiments were performed in accordance
with protocols approved by the local animal ethics committee at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas. Female ICR mice of 20-25-g (Charles

River Laboratories) were used after 72 h of quarantine
as described previously [76]. Briefly, food-restricted animals received streptomycin (5 g/L in drinking water
supplemented with 7% fructose) for 48 h prior to oral
inoculation with NRG857c or the iutA mutant. Groups
of mice (n = 6) were orally inoculated with a suspension
of NRG857c bacteria in a final volume of 0.4 mL delivered by gavage (20-gauge needle). The animals were
maintained for 72 h, after which the animals were killed
and the small intestines removed for homogenization
and enumeration of the bacterial load. Groups were
compared using the Mann Whitney non-parametric test.
Siderophore utilization and iron uptake bioassays

The synthesis of siderophores by AIEC O83:H1 was analyzed by the colorimetric Arnow assay to detect catechol
siderophores [77] and the ferric perchlorate assay for
hydroxamates [78]. To restrict the iron availability in
liquid or solid medium, the iron chelator 2,2’-dipyridil
was used. To examine the ability to use various siderophores or iron compounds as iron sources, overnight cultures of AIEC O83:H1 were diluted to 1 × 105 bacteria
per ml and seeded into L agar containing 2,2’-dipyridil.
Plates were spotted with 5 μl of 8 μM hemin or 5 μl of an
overnight culture of a siderophore-producing strain. A
sterile disk containing 20 μl of 10 mM FeSO4 was placed
on each plate. Growth was monitored around the spots
or disk after 18 to 24 hours at 37°C.
