Abstract
Background: Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5 is an endophytic diazotrophic bacterium that
lives in association with sugarcane plants. It has important biotechnological features such as
nitrogen fixation, plant growth promotion, sugar metabolism pathways, secretion of organic acids,
synthesis of auxin and the occurrence of bacteriocins.
Results: Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5 is the third diazotrophic endophytic bacterium to be
completely sequenced. Its genome is composed of a 3.9 Mb chromosome and 2 plasmids of 16.6
and 38.8 kb, respectively. We annotated 3,938 coding sequences which reveal several
characteristics related to the endophytic lifestyle such as nitrogen fixation, plant growth
promotion, sugar metabolism, transport systems, synthesis of auxin and the occurrence of
bacteriocins. Genomic analysis identified a core component of 894 genes shared with
phylogenetically related bacteria. Gene clusters for gum-like polysaccharide biosynthesis, tad pilus,
quorum sensing, for modulation of plant growth by indole acetic acid and mechanisms involved in
tolerance to acidic conditions were identified and may be related to the sugarcane endophytic and
plant-growth promoting traits of G. diazotrophicus. An accessory component of at least 851 genes
distributed in genome islands was identified, and was most likely acquired by horizontal gene
transfer. This portion of the genome has likely contributed to adaptation to the plant habitat.
Conclusion: The genome data offer an important resource of information that can be used to
manipulate plant/bacterium interactions with the aim of improving sugarcane crop production and
other biotechnological applications.

Background
In recent years, concerns about fossil fuel supplies and
prices have motivated the search for renewable biofuels.
With the existing technologies and current costs of fuel
transportation, ethanol from sugarcane is the most viable
alternative. In some countries, including Brazil, sugarcane
is planted with low amounts of nitrogen fertilizers and
there is evidence that the use of low levels of nitrogen can
be compensated by Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF)
[1]. Although several organisms are capable of contributing to BNF, it has been shown that the diazotroph Alphaproteobacteria Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5
(GDI), present in large numbers in the intercellular space

of sugarcane roots, stem and leaves, fixes N2 inside sugarcane plants, without causing apparent disease [2,3].
Remarkable characteristics of this bacterium are the acid
tolerance, the inability to use nitrate as sole nitrogen
source and the ability to fix nitrogen in the presence of
ammonium in medium with high sugar concentration
[2]. Although isolation of GDI from the sugarcane rhizosphere has been reported [4], its poor survival soil and
complete absence in soil samples collected between sugarcane rows strongly support the endophytic nature of this
nitrogen fixing bacterium [5-7]. In addition to BNF, GDI
has other characteristics that contribute to its biotechnological importance: 1-) A nif- mutant enhances plant

growth, particularly in roots, indicating that GDI secretes
plant growth-promoting substances [8]; 2-) It produces a
lysozyme-like bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of the
sugarcane pathogen Xanthomonas albilineans [9]; 3-) It has
antifungal activity against Fusarium sp. and Helminthosporium carbonum [10]; 4-) GDI promotes an increase in the
solubility of phosphate and zinc [11]. Besides its biotechnological features, the genome is especially interesting because is the third diazotrophic endophytic bacteria to be
completed sequenced. The first two diazotrophic endophytes to be sequenced, Azoarcus sp. strain BH72 [12] and
Klebsiella pneumoniae 342 [13], belong to the Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria classes, respectively.
Thus, the genome of GDI is the first to be completely
sequence from Alphaproteobacteria class. Here we report
the complete genome sequence of the G. diazotrophicus
strain Pal5. Sequence analyzes show the existence of a
large accessory genome, probably originated by extensive
Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). Moreover, experimental
results reveal differences in Genomic Islands (GI) among
G. diazotrophicus strains. The knowledge of the metabolic
routes, organization and regulation of genes involved in
nitrogen fixation, establishment of successful plant association and other processes should allow a better understanding of the role played by this bacterium in plantbacteria interaction.

Results
Overview of the G. diazotrophicus PAL5 genome
The complete genome of GDI is composed of one circular
chromosome of 3,944,163 base pairs (bp) with an average G+C content of 66.19%, and two plasmids of 38,818
and 16,610 bp, respectively (table 1). The circular chromosome has a total of 3,864 putative coding sequences
(CDS), with an overall coding capacity of 90.67%. Among

the predicted genes, 2,861 were assigned a putative function, and 1,077 encode hypothetical proteins. Regarding
noncoding RNA genes, 12 rRNAs (four rRNA operons)
and 55 tRNAs were identified. The larger plasmid
(pGD01) has 53 CDS; approximately 70% encode hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins and five
encode proteins involved in plasmid-related functions.
The remaining 11 CDS encode putative components of
the Type IV secretion system (T4SS). The small plasmid
(pGD02) has 21 CDS, and around 50% are hypothetical
proteins.
Although today the genome databases have more than
800 complete microbial genomes, only nine are endophytes (Azoarcus sp. BH72, Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN,
Enterobacter sp. 638, Methylobacterium populi BJ001, Pseudomonas putida W619, Serratia proteamaculans 568, Klebsiella pneumoniae 342, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia R5513 and Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5) [14]. The complete genomes of endophytic bacteria reveal remarkably
few mobile elements in its genome (Additional file 1), an
observation that led to the proposal that this could denote
an adaptation to a more stable life style [12]. In contrast,
GDI contains 190 transposable elements, more than any
other endophytic bacteria (Additional file 1). The large
number of mobile elements could be a signature of a
recent evolutionary bottleneck and consequent relaxation
of selection, perhaps due to a recent change in niche [15].
Alternatively, because GDI is found in low frequency at
the rhizosphere, the transposable elements could have
been acquired from other bacteria inhabiting the same
environment. In order to identify possible specific characteristics of the genome, the Predicted Highly Express
Genes (PHX) genes were identified [16]. PHX analysis
identified 658 CDS (17% of the chromosome) in GDI
with E(g) (general expression level) > 1,0. Combining this
information with the proteomic results [17], which
sequenced peptides from 541 genes, we identified 318 of
these genes PHX. As expected, ribosomal proteins, translation/transcription factors and chaperone/degradation
genes are among the top 30 E(g) values within the 318
CDS, (Additional file 2). However, some unexpected CDS
also appear as PHX. For instance, there are 50 transporter
proteins or transporter-related proteins with high E(g)
value, of which 27 are putative ABC transporter proteins
and six are putative TonB-dependent receptors. The
genome has two ammonium transporter proteins
(GDI0706 and GDI2352) and both with high E(g) values.
Two other proteins related to ammonium metabolism are
also PHX: a putative glutamate-ammonia-ligase adenyltransferase (GDI3425) and a putative histidine-ammonialyase (GDI0550). This finding is consistent with the fact
that ammonium is the preferred nitrogen source for GDI
when it is available.

Core and accessory regions
Analysis of the core and accessory regions of GDI is
important in order to understand its evolution and adaptation to the plant environment [18]. Even though Pal5 is
the first Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus strain to be
sequenced, it is possible to identify the core genome by
comparing with closely related species. The closest completed genomes available in the database were identified
by phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 3). These include
Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5 (ACC), Gluconobacter oxydans
621H (GOX) and Granulibacter bethesdensis CGDNIH
(GRB). Using quartops analysis (quartets of orthologous
proteins [19]) we identified 894 CDS as core. Most of
these CDS are related to metabolism, information transfer
and energy metabolism, as illustrated in figure 1. As CDS
with low GC3 (G+C content of synonymous third position) are potential accessory genes, the mean and standard deviation of the non-quartops were used as cut-offs to
identify possible accessory genes. We found that 1,352
CDS have a GC3 percentage lower than 80% (figure 2).
Interpolated Variable Order Motifs [20] (IVOMs) were
used to complement the accessory genome analysis,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/450

revealing that 1,164 CDS have an "Alien score" greater
than the threshold, 11,134. The group of CDS in common
between GC3 and IVOMs (851 CDS) was used to define
the accessory genes in the genome. The percentages of
conserved hypothetical proteins, hypothetical proteins,
phage/IS elements and pseudo genes are higher in the
putative accessory regions than in the core regions and in
the genome (figure 1), suggesting that the putative accessory regions have been transferred horizontally into the
genome. Overall, the putative accessory regions cover
approximately 24% of the GDI genome and are separated
into 28 distinct regions, of which seven are classified as
phage regions (Additional file 4). A third and completely
independent method, PHX, also supports the assignment
of the predicted accessory regions (figure 3).
Genome Islands: Variation among G. diazotrophicus
strains
Because HGT is an important source of intra-specific
genetic variation in bacteria [21], we investigated whether
there are differences in putative genome islands among 19
G. diazotrophicus strains and one G. johannae strain, using

PCR with primers designed against 39 single-copy genes
in 20 Genome Islands (GIs), and 17 CDS from the core
genome. There was a complex variation among the
strains, with gene content of eleven GIs - 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19 - either almost entirely conserved or less
than 50% variable (Additional file 5). In two GIs - 12 and
14 - there was high variability in a group of genes, while
other genes were conserved in most strains. The remaining
seven GIs, representing approximately 7% of the genome,
were highly variable, especially GIs 4 and 21, which are 78
and 242 kb long, and encode 80 and 242 CDS, respectively. Furthermore, a considerable number of CDS in
these two GIs encode genes involved in processes that
could confer a competitive edge, such as oxidative stress,
proteases, biosynthesis of antimicrobial agents, amino
acid metabolism and secondary metabolites, as well a
large number of transport systems and transcriptional regulators. Both GI4 and GI21 also contain complete copies
of the T4SS operon. As it has been suggested that T4SS can
increase host adaptability in Bartonella [22], we suspected
that they could be a source of intraspecific variation
among G. diazotrophicus strains. A Southern blot used to
probe the trbE gene shows that indeed the T4SS copy
number varies from one to four depending on the strain
(Additional file 6). These GIs could be especially important for bacterial adaptation to the endophytic lifestyle
and may confer adaptation advantages to G. diazotrophicus

in comparison with other microbes that colonize the
same niche.
General Comparison
As the experimental results support the prediction of
accessory regions in GDI, another interesting question
concerns which regions of the genome resembles
genomes from the database. For this purpose, a Reciprocal
Best Hits (RBH) comparison was used [23]. The RBH analysis indicates that only 2,966 CDSs of GDI generate a hit
with a completed bacterial genome. Among them, 2,470
CDSs have best hit with the Alphaproteobacteria class,
190 with the Betaproteobacteria class, 188 CDS with the
Gammaproteobacteria class and 118 with other groups.
The distribution of all RBHs demonstrated that even genes
from phylogenetically distant related organisms can
exhibit high percent identity (Additional file 7). The
organism with the highest number of best hits is GOX,
with 1,099. However, in figure 1, it is possible to observe
that most of the hits occur in core regions. In the three
organisms closest to GDI, around 90% of the best hits
occur in core regions, with 10% in accessories regions. On
the other hand, among rhizobiales and other Alphaproteobacteria orders, 56% of the best hits occur in core
regions and 44% in accessory regions (Additional file 8).
Curiously, complete genomes from the Betaproteobacteria class, Gammaproteobacteria class and other groups

have a significant number (65-70%) of RBHs in core
regions, and low percentage (30-35%) in accessory
regions. In addition, the number of RBHs with phytopathogenic organisms is higher in Betaproteobacteria and
Gammaproteobacteria than in Alphaproteobacteria
(68%, 55% and 8%, respectively).
Comparisons with other endophytic bacteria
Currently, there are only nine complete genome
sequences of endophytic bacteria, and all are Proteobacteria. Using the complete genomes, we searched for common and exclusive CDS among endophytic bacteria in
order to identify genes that could explain the endophytic
capacity. However, we found only five CDS that are exclusively conserved (Additional file 9). The comparison
among the endophytic organisms indicates that GDI has
more CDS exclusively conserved with Methylobacterium
populi BJ001 (133 genes) than with the others, which is
consistent with the fact that M. populi BJ001 is also an Alphaproteobacteria. Most of these genes (Additional file 10)
occur in an accessory region (GI4, GI9, GI12, GDI13,
GDI14, GDI19 and GI21), and many are putative transcriptional regulators and putative T4SS (Additional file
9), which could also be involved in bacteria-host interactions. We also searched for exclusively conserved CDS
between GDI and Azoarcus sp. BH72, as these two bacteria
are currently the only diazotrophs among the endophytes
sequenced. The result confirmed the presence in both
endophytes of the nif cluster (figure 2, around 0.5 MB)
and genes from the putative gum cluster are only conserved within Azoarcus sp. BH72 and GDI (Additional file
10). An assessment of the classes and frequency of signaling CDS in both diazotrophs shows that Azoarcus sp. BH72
has acquired a far more complex set of regulators (Additional file 11). In contrast, GDI has many more transport
systems than Azoarcus sp. BH72 (Additional file 12). Altogether, the strategy developed by GDI to interact with
plants seems to be more similar to Methylobacterium populi
BJ001 then to other endophytes. However, the result suggests that there is not only one strategy and probably there
are different ways in which bacteria can interact with
plants.

After we completed this work, a second genome sequence
of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus strain Pal5 was deposited. We carried out extensive comparisons between the
two sequences. The comparison is summarized in Additional file 13. The results show significant differences
between the two versions. GDI-BR has 309 more CDS
than GDI-US, although this number is significantly
reduced when small ORFs are annotated as CDSs in GDIUS. Likewise, the number of unique genes in both
genomes decreases from 747 and 438 to 624 and 110,
respectively, when the small CDSs are taken into account.
The results show that the transposases, integrases and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/450

hypothetical proteins can explain the majority of the differences between the two sequences. Furthermore, 67% of
the genes unique to GDI-BR are located in Genome
Islands. On the other hand, 85% BBH among the two
sequences are found outside the GIs. The results of the
genomic comparisons between the two sequences are
compatible with the PCR results reported here, that
showed that most of the genic differences among GDI
strains are situated in the GIs. Furthermore, when GIs
from the two sequences are compared, most of the genic
variation is found in the same more variable GIs (data not
shown). Altogether, these analyzes suggest that the two
sequences deposited as G. diazotrophicus Pal5 strain may
represent either two different strains or a fast diverging
strain.
In addition, our results were corroborated by at least three
independent approaches. First, Southern Blot analyzes
confirmed that the genomic sequence we have deposited
has 4 copies of the TSS4 secretion system. Furthermore,
PCR with primers that amplified genes in the GIs verified
the presence of all CDS in our sequence, while some like
GDI2782 which encodes a putative H(+)/Cl(-) exchange
transporter, is absent from the second sequence. Finally,
over 500 CDS in our sequence were validated by proteomics [17]. Some of these CDS may confer unique biological
properties and competitiveness to Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5, such as a Bacteriocin (GDI0415). Additional file 14 contains the list of Blast Best Hits among the
two Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5 genomic
sequences, a list of unique CDS found in chromosome
from GeneBank file CP001189 and a list of unique genes
found in chromosome from GeneBank file AM889285
(this work).
Genome Features in Core Regions
Osmotolerance
GDI supports high sugar concentrations, being able to tolerate up to 30% sucrose, but is sensitive to salt [24]. This
shows its adaptation to sugarcane tissues, where the
sucrose content is frequently high. Several osmoprotection systems were found (figure 4). There is a Kdp sensor
system kdpABCDE, which regulates potassium flux
(GDI1564-1568) [25]. One putative proline/betaine
transporter gene was detected (GDI2530), but transporter
genes proU, betT and opuA were not found. Pathways for
glycine/betaine production are incomplete and genes necessary for conversion from choline to betaine are absent.
The GDI genome harbors three Dpp ABC transporters that
facilitate the uptake of di- and tripeptides (GDI02460250, GDI0454-0458 and GDI3540-3544). Two ORFs
encoding a DtpT transporter, also involved in the uptake
of di- and tripeptides, are present (GDI3819 and
GDI0829). The presence of otsA, otsB and treA homologs
(GDI0917, GDI0916 and GDI1341) suggests that GDI

may synthesize and use the osmolytic disaccharide trehalose, although experiments on solid culture medium have
shown that GDI is able to grow poorly on trehalose as a
carbon source (data not shown). The hyperosmotic sensing in GDI may occur through the two-component system
envZ/ompR (GDI3087 and GDI3088). However, the envZregulated porins ompF and ompC are not present. In bacteria, two porins (aqpZ and glpF) regulate the movement of
water and aliphatic alcohols across cell membranes [26].
Homologs of aqpZ are missing in GDI, although two sets
of glyceroporin genes were found in two clusters: one containing glpRDFK (GDI1751-1754) and the other composed of glpDKF (GDI0262, GDI0266, and GDI0267).

The mechanisms shown in figure 4 and discussed here are
similar to those found in bacteria without the high level
of tolerance to high sugar concentrations observed for G.
diazotrophicus. Therefore, unknown mechanisms that protect the bacteria specifically against high sugar concentrations may act in GDI. However, GDI seems to have a
larger number of isoforms of enzymatic systems involved
in osmotolerance. These differences may be explained by
the different niches inhabited by GDI and Azoarcus sp
BH72. While GDI is found in plants with elevated concentration of sugars, Azoarcus sp BH72 lives in association
with plants that do not accumulate carbon sources in high
concentration in vegetative tissues, rice and Kallar grass,

Page 8 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:450

and thus Azoarcus sp BH72 may not need a large number
of enzymes.
Acid tolerance
GDI has high tolerance to low pH and organic acids and
is able to fix nitrogen at pH values as low as 2.5 [27]. The
acidophile Acetobacter aceti has an unusual citric acid cycle
(CAC) that is important for acetic acid resistance at low
pH [28]. Genome analyses revealed the presence in the
GDI genome of homologs of the alternative A. aceti citrate
synthase gene aarA (GDI1830) and the gene for an acetylCoA hydrolase family protein gene with succinylCoA:acetate CoA-transferase activity, called aarC
(GDI1836). In GDI, the aarAC homologs occur in a cluster similar to that of A. aceti, contrasting with the organization of these genes in non-acidophilic species, thus
indicating that the same mechanisms of acid tolerance
involving the CAC may be acting in both organisms. We
also found a homolog of an ABC-transporter gene aatA
(GDI1739) that, in A. aceti, constitutes an organic acid
efflux pump mediating resistance to several acids [29]. An
unusual observation is the presence in the GDI genome of
two copies of the chaperonin genes groES (GDI2050,
GDI2648) and groEL (GDI2049, GDI2647), which are
usually present as single copy in bacteria. In A. aceti, overexpression of the groESL operon led to augmented resistance to acetic acid [30], which may be explained by the
fact that chaperonins protect proteins under denaturing
conditions such as low pH [31].
Polysaccharides: CPS, EPS and LPS
Cell-surface components that are commonly involved in
plant-bacteria interactions include capsular polysaccharides (CPS), exopolysaccharides (EPS), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). On the GDI chromosome we found nine
CDS related to polysaccharide encapsulation (GDI2398
to GDI2402 and GDI2409 to GDI2413). The GDI
genome contains several CDS related to lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Five CDS (GDI3265, GDI1647,
GDI1652, GDI1447 and GDI0495) encode glycosyltransferases, three CDS (GDI2535, GDI2549 and GDI2493)
may be involved in lipopolysaccharide transport, one
CDS (GDI2975) encodes an O-antigen polymerase, and
there is an ADP-heptose synthase (GDI1133) and a nucleotidyl transferase (GDI0713). Seven CDS (GDI2490,
GDI2971, GDI2492, GDI2544, GDI2549, GDI1898 and
GDI1899) related to the synthesis of other EPS such as
beta-glucans and exooligosaccharides were also identified. These CDS are dispersed over the GDI genome and
encode exoF, exoZ, exoY, exoO, exoP, exoN and exoC, respectively. Homologs of these CDS are involved in the interaction between rhizobia and their host plants [32]. GDI has
a cluster (GDI2535-GDI2552) containing 14 CDSs that is
similar to the gum cluster of Azoarcus sp.BH72, X. campestris and X. fastidiosa. The gum cluster in X. campestris is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/450

responsible for the synthesis of an EPS that is involved in
host plant colonization and virulence [33]. However, not
all genes from the gum operon are present in GDI. We
found eight CDSs (GDI2552, GDI2549, GDI2547,
GDI2538, GDI2550, GDI2535, GDI2542 and GDI2548)
which represent the genes gumB, C, D, E, H, J, K and M,
respectively. The genes gumF, G, I and L are not present in
the GDI genome. As GDI is not virulent, this cluster may
be related with colonization and survival. In addition, it is
proposed that the viscous nature of EPS helps localize and
stabilize hydrolytic enzymes produced by the bacteria
[34]. We found a putative endoglucanase protein
(GDI2537) in the gum cluster that may degrade plant cell
walls in order to facilitate the active penetration of the
bacteria and thereafter the colonization. In addition, the
production of hydrolytic enzymes by GDI has been
observed [35].
Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF)
The genetics and biochemistry of BNF and nitrogen utilization by G. diazotrophicus have been previously investigated to some extent. Corroborating previous studies [36],
we have found that the GDI structural genes for nitrogenase nifHDK are arranged in a cluster (GDI0425GDI0454), which also contains other N2 fixation-related
genes, such as fixABCX, modABC and nifAB. Other related
genes, ntrX, ntrY and ntrC (GDI2263, GDI2264, and
GDI2265) are localized elsewhere in the chromosome in
a 5.2 kb cluster. There are three copies of nifU homologous genes, one localized in the nif cluster (GD0447), and
the other two scattered on the GDI chromosome
(GDI1392 and GDI3055). No draT or draG homologs
were found in GDI, confirming that nitrogenase activity is
not regulated at the post-translational level. It has been
suggested that post-translational modulation in G. diazotrophicus might be mediated by a FeSII Shethna protein
[37], but no such CDS was identified. However, many
other FeSII protein genes are present, and they possible
candidates for this role. The apparent absence of nifL as a
nifA activity modulator in response to the cell O2 status in
GDI [38] is in agreement with the lack of a nifL homolog
on the genome. The nifA protein appears to be inherently
sensitive to O2. In G. diazotrophicus, the main route for
assimilation of ammonia is believed to occur through the
glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway (GS/
GOGAT encoded by glnA and gltDB, respectively) [39].
However, the genome analysis suggests the existence of
alternative routes, where the putative enzymes NAD-synthase (GDI0919), aminomethyltransferase (GDI2317),
histidine ammonia-lyase (GDI0550) and D-amino acid
dehydrogenase (GDI2422) would incorporate ammonia
into different compounds. The enzymatic activity of GS is
known to be regulated by an adenylyltransferase enzyme,
which is probably encoded by glnE (GDI3425). The glutamate dehydrogenase gene was not found in GDI,

Page 9 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:450

although its activity was demonstrated for G. diazotrophicus strain Pal3 [38].
Signaling and quorum sensing
The GDI genome contains 16 GGDEF family genes that
are involved in the synthesis of the second messenger
cyclic di-GMP, which has been shown to regulate cellulose
synthesis and other processes such as transitions between
sessile and planktonic lifestyle and pathogenesis [39].
There are three cytoplasmic and 14 membrane-bound histidine kinase signaling proteins, the majority of which
form two-component signaling systems with a neighboring response regulator gene. Among these histidine
kinases are homologs of the kdpD (GDI1566), envZ
(GDI3079), chvG (GDI1265), ntrY (GDI2264), ntrB
(GDI2266) and phoB (GDI3817) genes. In addition, there
are two adjacent hybrid histidine kinase/response regulator genes that are organized in an apparent operon
(GDI3283-3293) that contains several chemotaxis genes
and a proteolytic system encoded by hslUV that is absent
in GOX. Chemotaxis enables microorganisms to move
towards beneficial or away from harmful substances in
their environments by means of flagellar motility. The G.
diazotrophicus genome contains nine methyl-accepting
proteins (MCPs, chemotaxis sensor proteins), the majority of which have close homologs in rhizobia, but not in
the phylogenetically related non-endophyte GOX, which
has only three MCP genes [40]. Quorum sensing has been
shown to be important in traits such as virulence, biofilm
formation and swarming motility in many bacteria [41].
In the Azoarcus sp BH72 genome, quorum sensing genes
were not found, and it was suggested that this was compatible with a non-pathogenic interaction of Azoarcus sp
BH72 with the host plant [12]. Nevertheless, GDI, which
inhabits a niche similar to Azoarcus sp BH72, has three
quorum sensing genes: one luxI autoinducer synthase
gene (GDI2836) and two luxR-type transcriptional regulator genes (GDI2837, GDI2838). Quorum sensing genes
are also present in several rhizobial genomes, and they
play roles in nodulation and nitrogen fixation [42].
Plant Growth-Promoting (PGP) Traits
There are several indications that GDI promotes plant
growth by more than a few independent mechanisms
besides nitrogen fixation, including synthesis of phytohormones and increased uptake of nutrients [43]. Recent
work has shown that mutations in two genes involved in
cytochrome c biogenesis reduced auxin levels to 10% of
the wild-type strain [44], suggesting their involvement in
indole acetic acid (IAA) production, and indicating that
GDI has at least two independent pathways for auxin biosynthesis. In addition, characterization of the IAA biosynthetic route in GDI has shown that auxin is mostly
synthesized by the Indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway
[44]. Although no CDS encoding an indole 3-pyruvate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/450

carboxylase was found in GDI genome, we cannot rule
out that the biochemical activity could be executed by one
of the many putative decarboxylases identified in the
genome. The presence of genes encoding enzymes such as
aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (GDI1891), amine
oxidase (GDI1716) and aldehyde dehydrogenases
(GDI0311, GDI0461, GDI640) suggests that the bacteria
might synthesize IAA via the trypamide pathway (TAM).
Also, the presence of two genes coding for putative nitrilases (GDI0018, GDI3743) suggests that IAA might be
produced by the indole-3-acetonitrile pathway (IAN). In
addition to phytohormone production, some rhizosphere-associated bacteria can stimulate plant growth by
secreting a mixture of plant volatiles, mainly 3-hydroxy-2butanone (acetoin) and 2,3-butanediol [45]. Although
the role of GDI in PGP has been studied, no attention has
been paid to the production of volatiles. We found GDI is
likely to be capable to synthesize acetoin once the genome
sequence encodes two enzymes of the pathway; acetolactate synthase (GDI0022, GDI0023) and acetoin diacetyl
reductase (GDI2623). In addition, although an acetolactate decarboxylase has not been identified, 2-acetolactate
can be converted to diacetyl spontaneously in the presence of oxygen (46). It has been shown for Azospirillum
brasilense that the production and secretion of polyamines
promote plant growth [47]. The presence of genes coding
for enzymes for the synthesis (GDI0476, GDI2322) and
secretion (GDI2595) of spermidine in the G diazotrophicus
Pal5 genome sequence suggests that this polyamine may
also contribute to PGP. G. diazotrophicus has been shown
to synthesize the gibberellins GA1 and GA3 [48].
Although the gibberellin biosynthesis machinery in bacteria is largely unknown, recent studies have suggested
likely biosynthetic mechanisms in Bradyrhizobium japonicum [49]. The GDI genome contains genes for the synthesis of the diterpenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate
through the non-mevalonate pathway. Condensation
reactions of this precursor to form geranylgeranyl diphosphate may be performed by the geranyltranstransferase
ispA (GDI1861). However, homologs of the genes responsible for the cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate in
B. japonicum (ent-copalyl diphosphate and ent-kaurene
synthase) are apparently absent in the GDI genome and
therefore the mechanism of cyclization of geranylgeranyl
diphosphate to ent-kaurene remains unknown. However,
a putative squalene cyclase (GDI1620) could fulfill such
function, since a study with recombinant squalene cyclase
has shown some cyclization of geranylgeraniol by this
enzyme [50]. Oxidation steps of ent-kaurene, necessary to
produce GA1 and GA3, may be catalyzed by two cytochromes P450 (GDI2364 and GDI2593), homologs of
which are absent in other acetobacteraceae genomes, thus
suggesting a likely specific role in G. diazotrophicus. It has
been reported that the capacity of G. diazotrophicus to
antagonize diverse plant pathogens such as fungi, and

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:450

bacteria contributes to increasing its ability to survive
under environmental stress and leads to an improvement
in plant fitness which may have important consequences
for agricultural productivity [9,10]. Its genome sequence
encodes a large repertoire of genes whose products
oppose attack from competing microbes, such as drug
efflux systems, and acriflavin and fusaric acid resistance
proteins. On the other hand, GDI may also produce a
broad variety of proteins such as lytic enzymes and phospholipases and antibiotic biosynthetic pathways that
could be toxic to other organisms. The secretion of a lysozyme-like bacteriocin by G. diazotrophicus, for instance,
inhibits Xanthomonas albilineans growth [9]. Indeed, GDI
encodes a putative lysozyme-like bacteriocin (GDI0416
and GDI0415).
Sugar metabolism and energy generation
Sucrose is the common carbon source used for isolation of
Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus from sugarcane and other
plants in the semi-solid LGIP medium [51]. However,
sucrose is not directly metabolized by the bacteria. Experimental evidence has shown that there is a constitutively
expressed levansucrase (LsdA GDI0471), secreted to the
periplasm via a specific signal peptide-dependent pathway, that converts sucrose to beta-1,2 -oligofructans and
levan [52]. In addition, a fructose-releasing exo-levanase
(LsdB GDI 0477) probably controlled by an antitermination inducer system converts polyfructans into fructose
[53]. A type II secretion operon (GDI481-GDI 490) is
required for the transport o f LsdA across the outer membrane [54]. The transport of LsdB to the periplasm
involves the cleavage of the N-terminal peptide signal,
and it is induced during growth of the bacteria with low
fructose levels but repressed by glucose [55].

In G. diazotrophicus oxidation of glucose to gluconate in
the periplasmic space is the first step in glucose metabolism by GDI [56]. Gluconate may be synthesized by the
product of three CDS encoding membrane-bound quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenases (GDI3277, GDI0325 and
GDI0539) in accordance with the observed high activity
of PQQ-GDH detected in glucose-containing batch culture of GDI strain Pal3 grown mainly under biological
nitrogen fixation and/or C-limitation conditions [57]. A
NAD-GDH (GDI2625) also participates in the glucose
oxidation (intracellularly) when glucose is in excess [57].
Further periplasmic oxidation of gluconate to 2-ketogluconic acid occurs by a putative three-subunit flavindependent
gluconate-2-dehydrogenase
(GDI0854,
GDI0855 and GDI0856). Gluconate dehydrogenases
(extracellular, dye-linked and intracellular, NAD-Linked)
activities have been demonstrated in GDI strain Pal3
grown in presence of gluconate with 2-ketogluconate the
major compound accumulated (57). The production of 5ketogluconate and 2,5 di-ketogluconate are probably

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/450

mediated by a glucose/methanol/choline oxidoreductase
(GDI0859) and a putative alcohol dehydrogenase cytochrome
c/gluconate
2-dehydrogenase
acceptor
(GDI0860). High activities of 2-ketogluconate reductase
(NAD linked) have been detected in a GDI Pal3 strain
grown with gluconate [58].
CDS for transport (GDI3258) and phosphorylation
(GDI0293) proteins indicate that gluconate can also be
directly driven into the pentose phosphate route (PPP),
supporting the experimental data [58]. The presence of a
kinase (GDI3115), a 2-ketogluconate reductase (GDI
3432) and a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase-NAD
(GDI2166) corroborates with the experimental data
which shows that the PPP is the main C-metabolism route
in GDI following the oxidation of glucose to gluconate
[57].
Different from GOX, CDSs encoding a complete respiratory chain complex I (nuoA - nuoN or complex I protontranslocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase; GDI2459GDI2471) are present in the GDI genome [59]. The GDI
genome contains CDS that encode L-sorbosone dehydrogenases (GDI0574 and GDI3764), membrane-bound
small and large subunits (GDI3280 and GDI3281) and
the cytochrome c subunit (GDI3279) of aldehyde dehydrogenase, indicating that GDI may be able to synthesize
the industrially important substances such as L-ascorbic
acid (vitamin C) and its precursor 2-keto-L-gulonic acid
[60].
Genome Features in Accessory Regions
Type IV secretion system
Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-subunit cell
envelope-spanning structures, ancestrally related to bacterial conjugation machines, that transfer proteins, DNA
and nucleoprotein complexes across membranes [61].
Moreover, T4SSs have been described as essential pathogenicity factors and recently it has been indicated that
TSS4 can also increase host adaptability in Bartonella sp.
[22]. GDI has 4 complete T4SS in the chromosome which
are similar to bacterial conjugation machines (trb) of Agrobacterium tumefasciens [62] and Ti (tumor inducing)
Enterobacter IncP plasmid R751 [63]. Although the order
of the trb genes in the operon is conserved (trbB, -C, -D, E, -J, -L, -F, -G, -I), two genes are missing from the original
trb operon (trbK and trbH). The gene trbK has been
reported as non-essential but trbH has been reported as
essential for conjugal transfer of Agrobacterium tumor
inducing plasmid pTiC58 [63]. Another difference is that,
in Agrobacterium tumefasciens and Enterobacter IncP plasmid R751, the first gene in the operon is traI, which is an
essential signal for the quorum-sensing regulation of the
Ti plasmid conjugation transfer [64]. In GDI the first gene
in the operon is traG, which is essential for DNA transfer

Page 11 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:450

in bacterial conjugation. This gene is thought to mediate
interactions between the DNA-processing (Dtr) and the
mating pair-formation (Mpf) systems [65]. T4SS have
been found in many different organisms [66], from pathogenic to mutualistic endosymbiont organisms (for
instance, Helicobacter pylori, Legionella pneumophila, Brucella spp, Bartonella spp, Rickettsia spp., Coxiella spp., Anaplasma marginale, Ehrlichia spp, Agrobacterium tumefaciens,
Wolbachia spp). All four complete T4SS operons in the GDI
chromosome were found in accessory regions (GI4, GI12,
and twice in GI21), suggesting that the bacteria acquired
the ability to translocate macromolecules across the cell
envelope to the plant. The four copies of the T4SS operon
diverge by the presence of a variable region between the
traG and the trbB genes that include transcriptional regulators mucR and araC, a DNA-binding protein HU-beta,
an aldo/keto reductase and hypothetical proteins. These
genes might confer specific functions to each T4SS copy.
Flagella and pili
In many organisms, flagella are involved in motility,
adherence, biofilm formation and host colonization [67].
GDI has a large accessory region (GI15) with at least 40
genes predicted to encode functions related to motility.
This observation is in accordance with the presence of peritrichous flagella on the GDI cell surface. Next to the
motility cluster there is a putative tad locus (Flp-1, cpaABC,
cpaEF, and tadBCDG) which probably encodes the
machinery for the synthesis of Flp (fimbrial low-molecular-weight protein) pili, which form a subfamily in the
type IVb pilus family. In Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Pseudomonas, Yersinia and Caulobacter. Flp pili are
essential for biofilm formation, colonization and pathogenesis [68]. Additionally, several pseudopilins
(GDI0483, GDI0484, and GDI0485) were identified as
part of a type II secretion system. Recently, it has been
shown that flagella-less mutant of GDI was non-motile
and displayed reduced capacity to form biofilm [69].
These findings suggest that these genes were acquired by
HGT and play an important role in the interaction with
the plant.

Conclusion
Despite the potential impact of endophytes on the environment and on crop production, our current knowledge
of their biology is limited. Analysis of the G. diazotrophicus
PAL5 complete genome sequence provides important
insights into the endophytic relationship, and suggests
many interesting candidate genes for post-genomic experiments.
The genome reveals an unexpectedly high number of
mobile elements for an endophytic bacterium; it is in fact
the endophyte with the highest frequency of mobile genes
per Mb of genome. The high number of mobile elements

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/450

seems to be associated with a high number of HGT events.
The analysis of HGT shows that most of the genes are
more similar to genes from the order rhizobiales (40%),
suggesting that a likely previous niche was located in the
rhizosphere. Thus, a recent evolutionary bottleneck and
consequent relaxation of selection, due to a possible
change of niche, is probably the hypothesis that could
best explain the high number of HGT [15].
In addition, to change niche from rhizosphere to endophytic, the bacteria should have features that would allow
it to penetrate the plant. The putative gum-like cluster containing an endoglucanase could be important in this
regard. Moreover, the limited similarity with the gum-like
cluster from X. campestris and the absence of some genes
found in X. campestris may mean that the cluster adapted
to a non-virulence profile. However, the ability to penetrate the plant is not enough to transform it into an endophyte; the bacteria must evolve together with the plant to
create a more depended relationship. The genome has
many features to enhance plant fitness such as BNF, phytohormones and biocontrol genes, and all of them lie in
the core of the genome or have a very low "Alien score".
We propose that these features were important to create a
dependent relationship, and may have helped GDI to
spread out and occupy this niche. In contrast, many features that may be related to bacteria-plant interaction are
found in genome islands, including type IV secretion systems, flagella, pili, chemotaxis, biofilm, capsular polysaccharide and some transport proteins. The overall result
suggests that it is more likely that GDI acquired many features that are important for an endophytic lifestyle. Thus,
experimental analyses of genes from genome islands may
reveal an important source of gene candidates that will
enhance our understanding of bacteria-plant relationship.
Finally, comparison of genome sequences of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and Azoarcus sp. BH72 shows that
these endophytic diazotrophic bacteria adopted very different strategies to colonize plants. A limited number of
genomic features, such as the large number of TonB receptors, the gum-like and nif clusters, and osmotolerance
mechanisms are common to both endophytic diazotrophic bacteria. On the other hand, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus has a larger number of transport systems, and
it is capable of growing on a wide variety of carbon
sources, while Azoarcus sp. BH72 has rather complex signaling mechanisms to communicate with its plant host.

Methods
Strain
Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus strain PAl 5 (type strain)
was isolated from sugarcane roots collected in Alagoas
Sate, Brazil using the nitrogen-free semi-solid LGIP
medium [2]. It was deposited at the Embrapa Agrobio-

Page 12 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:450

logia Culture Collection and received the identification
number BR 11281 (BR-stands for the Brazilian Nitrogenfixing bacteria Culture Collection). Later on, this strain
was deposited by Johanna Dobereiner at the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC 49037) and also at the
Culture Collection Laboratorium von Microbiologie, Belgium (LMG 7603) [70].
Genome sequencing, assembly and annotation
All the libraries were prepared with total bulk DNA originated from a Pal 5 lyophilized tube culture provided by
the Embrapa Agrobiologia Culture Collection. Pal5 was
grown in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 mL of
DYGS medium (Rodrigues-Neto et al., 1986) during 48 h
at 200 rpm and 30°C. DNA extraction was performed
according with the CTAB method [71]. Phenol: chloroform: iso-amilic alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform: isoamilic alcohol (24:1) washing steps were repeated 2 times
to guarantee removal of cells debris and other contaminants during DNA extraction.

and 4-6 kb were constructed in pUC18 vectors and 10-17
kb in the cosmid pLARF3. Plasmid clones were endsequenced on ABI377 and ABI3100 (Applied Biosystems)
and MegaBACE 1000 (GE Healthcare) sequencers. A total
of 103,506 high-quality reads were obtained and assembled into contigs using the Phrap assembly tool. For gap
closure, 16,963 additional reads were obtained through
PCR direct sequencing and primer-walking on plasmids.
Manual editing was done using the GAP4 software package [72]. Genome integrity was verified by a physical map
constructed using PFGE and hybridization with 42 singlecopy and rDNA probes [73]. Initial automatic gene prediction was done using GLIMMER [74], and subsequently
manually curated with reference to codon-specific positional base preferences. Before the manual annotation of
each predicted gene, different tools were used. Similarity
search was performed against different databases including Uniprot [75], PROSITE [76], nr, Pfam [77], and InterPro [78]. Additionally, SignalP [79], TMHMM [80] and
tRNAscan-SE [81] were applied. All the data were viewed
within the Artemis [82] program where the function of
each gene was manually curated.

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The genomic sequence reported in this article has been
deposited in the EMBL database under accession numbers
AM889285, AM889286 and AM889287. The genome
annotation and features are available at http://www.bio
qmed.ufrj.br/bertalan/.
Core and accessory regions
The core regions were determined by quartops analysis
(quartets of orthologous proteins), using reciprocal best
hit of Blastp. The accessory regions were determined by a
combination of two different methods: GC3 and IVOMs.
The GC3 analyzes the percent of GC in the third base of
the codon in each gene. For both methods, the regions
indicated as accessory genes were manually checked for
integrases, tRNAs and repeats (direct and inverted). The
beginning and end of each the accessory region were
defined by both methods and, in the case of bacteriophages, the genome islands were extended when evidence of the insertion point was found.
Reciprocal Best Hits
Reciprocal best hits comparison was done using only the
complete bacterial genomes publicly available at ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/all.faa.tar.gz.
Only
reciprocal best hits with identity greater of 30% and alignment greater than 70% were selected.
Plant Endophyte comparison
Six complete endophyte genomes were used to represent
the endophyte group and three closest complete genomes
phylogenetically to GDI were used to represent the core
genome. Endophyte genomes were Azoarcus sp. BH72,
Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN, Enterobacter sp. 638, Methylobacterium populi BJ001, Pseudomonas putida W619 and
Serratia proteamaculans 568. Core genome species were
Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5, Gluconobacter oxydans 621H and
Granulibacter bethesdensis CGDNIH. Only reciprocal best
hits with more than 30% identity and 70% alignment
were accepted.

Presence of homologues of the trbE gene among G. diazotrophicus
strains. Total DNA of 11 Gluconacetobacter strains was completely
digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI (a.) or EcoRV (b.), separated on
agarose gel and submitted to Southern blot analysis using a fragment of
CDS GDI0133 (trbE, part of type IV secretion system) as a probe. Numbers 1-10 represent G. diazotrophicus strains: Pal5 (1), 3R2 (2), URU
(3), 38f2 (4), PRJ50(5), Pal3 (6), AF3 (7), PCRI (8), PPe4 (9),
CNFe-550 (10). Number 11 represents G. johannae. In strain Pal5,
only 3 bands are present, although the genome sequence indicates the
presence of four copies of the trbE gene. However, the fourth trbE paralog
(GDI1016) is more dissimilar to the probe sequence then the other three
(GDI0133, GDI2742 e GDI2911), which may have prevented hybridization.
