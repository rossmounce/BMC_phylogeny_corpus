Abstract
Background: Hydrophobins are proteins containing eight conserved cysteine residues that occur
uniquely in mycelial fungi. Their main function is to confer hydrophobicity to fungal surfaces in contact with
air or during attachment of hyphae to hydrophobic surfaces of hosts, symbiotic partners or themselves
resulting in morphogenetic signals. Based on their hydropathy patterns and solubility characteristics,
hydrophobins are divided into two classes (I and II), the latter being found only in ascomycetes.
Results: We have investigated the mechanisms driving the evolution of the class II hydrophobins in nine
species of the mycoparasitic ascomycetous genus Trichoderma/Hypocrea, using three draft sequenced
genomes (H. jecorina = T. reesei, H. atroviridis = T. atroviride; H. virens = T. virens) an additional 14,000 ESTs
from six other Trichoderma spp. (T. asperellum, H. lixii = T. harzianum, T. aggressivum var. europeae, T.
longibrachiatum, T. cf. viride). The former three contained six, ten and nine members, respectively. Ten is
the highest number found in any ascomycete so far. All the hydrophobins we examined had the conserved
four beta-strands/one helix structure, which is stabilized by four disulfide bonds. In addition, a small
number of these hydrophobins (HFBs)contained an extended N-terminus rich in either proline and
aspartate, or glycine-asparagine. Phylogenetic analysis reveals a mosaic of terminal clades containing
duplicated genes and shows only three reasonably supported clades. Calculation of the ratio of differences
in synonymous vs. non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions provides evidence for strong purifying
selection (KS/Ka >> 1). A genome database search for class II HFBs from other ascomycetes retrieved a
much smaller number of hydrophobins (2–4) from each species, and most were from Sordariomycetes. A
combined phylogeny of these sequences with those of Trichoderma showed that the Trichoderma HFBs
mostly formed their own clades, whereas those of other Sordariomycetes occurred in shared clades.
Conclusion: Our study shows that the genus Trichoderma/Hypocrea has a proliferated arsenal of class II
hydrophobins which arose by birth-and-death evolution followed by purifying selection.

Background
Hydrophobins are small proteins that are unique for mycelial fungi [1-4]. Their core structure consists of four beta
strands, crosslinked by four disulfide bridges [5,6], creating a structure enabling the self-assembly at a
hydrophilic/hydrophobic
interface
between
the
hydrophilic cell wall and a hydrophobic environment
(such as air or the hydrophobic surface of living and nonliving material). They are classified on the basis of chemical properties (hydrophobicity, solubility) into class I or
class II hydrophobins [1], with class I hydrophobins having been identified in both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, and class II hydrophobins having so far been only
detected in ascomycetes [4]. Hydrophobins can fulfill a
plethora of biological functions ranging from the formation of aerial structures, elicitation of morphogenesis and
interaction with potential hosts or symbiotic partners
[2,7-10].
In the primary sequence, the most important feature common to all hydrophobins is the characteristic pattern of
eight Cys-residues, which gives rise to a common disulfide
network [5,11]. Besides these conserved Cys-residues and
similar hydropathy patterns, however, the hydrophobins
share only a few conserved residues [4]. The poor amino
acid sequence conservation of hydrophobins raises the
question as to the evolutionary mechanism driving the
rapid differentiation of hydrophobin gene sequences.
Other genes involved in the response of organisms to their
immediate environment have sometimes been shown to
be driven by positive selection [12-16], so called "arms
races" [17]. However, concerted evolution and birth-anddeath evolution under strong purifying selection have also
been reported [18-24].
The fungal genus Trichoderma/Hypocrea contains a large
number of mycoparasitic species [25,26], and some of
them (e.g. H. lixii = T. harzianum, H. virens = T. virens, H.
atroviridis = T. atroviride, T. asperellum) are also commercially used as biological fungicides [27]. Interestingly,
there are only a few reports describing the occurrence of
hydrophobins in mycoparasitic strains of Trichoderma/
Hypocrea [28-30] and a characterization of the function or
biological role for each has not been determined. The
class II hydrophobin genes hfb1 and hfb2 of the weakly
mycoparasitic species H. jecorina (T. reesei) have been
studied [31,32] and shown to serve different functions
during vegetative development. Viterbo and Chet [33]
recently showed that a class I hydrophobin from T. asperellum is involved in root colonization. Interestingly, this
hydrophobin is the only class I hydrophobin identified in
any Trichoderma/Hypocrea sp. so far.
The assignment of a function to individual members of
large gene families like the hydrophobins is complicated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/4

by the possibility that several of them may have overlapping functions [34,35], which in turn is dependent on the
selective pressures acting on the organism. Understanding
the evolution of such genes and identifying stable clusters
within the phylogeny may therefore help illustrate members with a potentially critical function.

Results
Protein structure of the Trichoderma class II hydrophobin
proteins
In order to have a representative sample of class II HFBs
from Trichoderma/Hypocrea, we first screened the available
genome sequences of H. jecorina, H. atroviridis and H.
virens, retrieving 6, 10 and 9 genes encoding class II proteins, respectively. Second, we searched NCBI and identified one HFB from H. lixii (= T. harzianum) strain T-22
(HL_4). We also included the hydrophobin-like protein
QID3 from H. lixii strain CECT 2413 [36] in the analysis.
A third hydrophobin – srh1 – from "T. harzianum" [28]
was also included in this study, but as this strain had been
misidentified and is in fact H. atroviridis [37] it turned out
to be identical to HA_2a (see Table 1). Third, we screened
the TrichoEST database [38] which – besides containing
ESTs of H. atroviridis and H. virens – contains transcript
sequences from additional five Trichoderma/Hypocrea species (H. lixii, T. aggressivum var. europeae, T. longibrachiatum, T. stromaticum, T. asperellum and T. cf. viride),
resulting in 15 further HFBs. The identity of "T. cf. viride"was rechecked on the basis of ESTs for elongation factor 1 alpha (tef1) and RNA polymerase subunit B (rpb2)
and determined to be closest to T. koningiopsis, and we will
therefore name this strain T. cf. koningiopsis throughout
this study. Our sample consisted of 42 class II HFBs from
9 different species of Trichoderma, covering sections Longibrachiatum, Trichoderma and Pachybasium (cf. Table 1),
and thus consisting of a well distributed sample.

Prediction of the encoded protein sequences showed that
most of the predicted HFBs had the expected structure of
90 – 110 amino acids, which includes a 15–20 aa signal
peptide, the 65 aa core structure displaying the eight
cysteines which are predicted to have four 4 beta-strands
and a single helix. However, five of them (one from H.
jecorina; HFB6) and two each from H. atroviridis (Ta_2c
and Ta_6a) and H. virens (Tv_1d and Tv_21a) contained
also an additional N-terminal segment of 64 – 133 amino
acids which was characteristically rich in P, G and N/D,
and for which no secondary structure could be predicted
with certainty. This extended N-terminus is similar to the
one found in the T. harzianum pseudohydrophobin
QID3, in which one conserved cysteine residue is replaced
by a serine [36] and indicates that it is a general feature of
a small group of Trichoderma class II hydrophobins. Moreover, within a subgroup of them, a characteristic G xN
repeat was found to be conserved (Fig. 1).

The aa's forming the α-helix, in contrast, showed very lit-

had part of the helical domain deleted and likely represent
pseudogenes. This hypothesis is also supported by our
lack of finding transcripts of these two HFBs in a total of

40.000 ESTs from different stages of H. atroviridis development (C.P. Kubicek and S.E. Baker, unpublished data).
However they otherwise showed the conserved amino
acid sequence pattern typical for class II HFBs, and were
therefore retained in the analysis. The alignment led to the
identification of 32 aa (of a total of 64 aa) that were functionally conserved (Fig. 2).
Genomic organisation of the Trichoderma hydrophobin
genes
In order to identify the mechanisms acting on the evolution of the Trichoderma hydrophobin genes, we first
looked at their genomic organisation and exon structures.
The six T. reesei hydrophobins are located on five different, large scaffolds, and even the two which are located on
the same scaffold (hfb1 and hfb6) are separated by over
700,000 bp, and are therefore unlinked. Similar, although
several of the hfb genes of H. atroviridis and H. virens were
located on the same scaffold, they were separated by over
100,000 bp. In order to analyse whether any of these loci
would be syntenic across Trichoderma species, we subjected each of the H. jecorina hfb genes plus 5 kb of its upand downstream nt-sequences to a TBLAST search in the
genome sequences of H. virens and H. atroviridis. The loci
flanking the six hfb genes in H. jecorina did not flank any
of the H. virens and H. atroviridis genes found by this analysis, although the flanking genes alone were sometimes
located in the same region on a different scaffold (data
not shown). Together, these data suggest that the genome
regions containing hydrophobin gene loci have undergone extensive recombination during their evolution.
Intron/Exon structure of the Trichoderma hydrophobin
genes
All of the chromosomal hfb genes of H. jecorina, H. virens
and H. atroviridis contain two introns, which are very similar although not identical in size, and are positionally
conserved. Interestingly, the length of the second exon
encodes the aa sequence which folds exactly into the single α-helix of the hydrophobin and its third beta-sheet (cf.
[5]) is absolutely conserved in all genes.

Phylogeny of the Trichoderma class II hydrophobin
proteins
A phylogeny, based on neighbour joining of the amino
acid sequence area from C1 to C8+1, is given in Fig. 3. It is
conspicuous that the internal branches of the tree are
essentially unresolved, and statistically supported clades
only occur in terminal branches. Bayesian analysis of the
same dataset produced essentially consistent results (data
not shown). Five strongly supported clades contain HFBs
from more than two Trichoderma species, i.e. the clades
containing H. jecorina HFB1/HFB2; the clade containing
TCK1; the clade containing TL1; the clade containing H.
jecorina HFB3; and the clade containing H. jecorina HFB4.
We considered it possible that the poor resolution of the
internal tree branches could be due to the lack of conservation in the α-helix, the phylogeny was also performed
on an alignment from which the aa's forming the helix
had been removed. However, this did not improve clade
stability (data not shown).
Evidence for gene duplications within the Trichoderma
HFB proteins
One feature, which became obvious from the phylogenetic analysis and which is unaffected by the low internal
branching support, is the high number of paralogous proteins. Examples for this are: Ha_1b and Ha_1c; Ha_6a and
Ha_2c; Hv_21a and Hv_22a; TCK1 and TCK2; Ha_6b and
Ha_6c; and HFB1 and HFB2. Most of these twins form a
terminal branch, or are connected by a single node, indicating that they arose by gene duplication. The Trichoderma class II hydrophobins thus display a significant
pattern of gene duplications in their evolutionary history.
Nucleotide Sequence Divergence of the hydrophobin
genes
In order to obtain an insight in the mechanisms driving
the evolution of the Trichoderma hfb genes, we investigated
their nucleotide sequences. Introns were thereby
excluded. Bayesian analysis, based on an alignment of the
nucleotide sequences starting from the triplet encoding
the first cysteine (C1) and ending with that of the eighth

The symbols and letters over the alignment show the position of the four betastrands (S1–S4) and the single helix (indicated by a horizontal cylinder). The sequence below the alignment proposes an

cysteine (C8), produced a phylogenetic tree which basically showed the same clade structure as the tree based on
aa alignment, only with poorer support of some of the
interior branches (data not shown). We investigated the
nucleotide phylogeny split decomposition [39,40], a
method depicting the shortest pathway by linking
sequences, rather than forcing them into a bifurcating
tree. The resulting tree is shown in Fig. 4, demonstrating
indeed a dense network in the interior branches. The high-

est probability for a tree like structure was obtained with
branch leading to the "Hfb4" clade (cf. Fig. 3). Since such
networks may be the consequence of recombination, we
applied the Phi-test, implemented in SplitsTree. However,
the results of the phi-test favour the rejection of the null
hypothesis of recombination (p = 0.888). Consistent
results were obtained by using a sliding window approach
in TOPALi (data not shown). We therefore conclude that
the interior network in the tree revealed by the split

decomposition method is due to a loss of genes (and thus
branching information) and not recombination.
The lack of recombination within the hfb genes, together
with the observation of gene duplications suggests that
the Trichoderma hydrophobins undergo purifying selection without concerted evolution. In such a case, the
member genes would evolve independently and display a
birth-and-death evolution [18]. This model of evolution
assumes that new genes are created by repeated gene
duplication and that some of the duplicate genes are
maintained in the genome for a long time whereas others
are deleted or become non-functional [18-20]. Thus
nucleotide sequence differences between genes will primarily occur at synonymous sites, thus resulting in KS >>
Ka.

We therefore separately tested the total number of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, as well as the number
of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous
site (Ka), and the number of synonymous -or silent-substitutions per synonymous -or silent-site (Ks) [41], both
within the total gene exon sequence as well as within the
two major exons separately (Table 2). In total, the number
of differences at nonsynonymous sites strongly exceeded
those at synonymous sites. However, the number of
nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites (KS) was significantly higher than the number of substitutions in nonsynonymous sites (Ka) in the complete gene and in exon
1, and slightly higher in exon 2. Plotting KS vs. Ka for
members of selected clades, which had obtained support
in the aa-phylogeny (cf. Fig. 3) showed that the KS values
for some gene-to-gene comparisons are very high (up to
1.0) and have apparently reached the saturation level
[21]. Interestingly, different clades showed different maximal Ka values, the "HFB4" clade thereby displaying the
lowest numbers (Fig. 5).
The Trichoderma HFB proteins form unique clades within
the ascomycetous hydrophobins
The findings of gene duplication and apparently nonfunctional genes raised the question as whether a similar
pattern of paralogous genes would be found also in other
ascomycetes, and whether their members would help to
stabilize the clades formed by the Trichoderma class II
HFBs. To this end, we screened the available genome databases of other ascomycetes by TBLAST, using members of
each of the Trichoderma HFB clades as a query (see Materials and Methods). In addition, we searched the NCBI
database for previously described class II HFBs. The result
was interesting in so far as most other ascomycetes for
which a draft genome sequence is available contain a
much smaller number of hydrophobin genes than Trichoderma, M. grisea being richest with 5 proteins (Table 3).
While we cannot absolutely rule out that some HFBencoding genes slipped through our analysis because of
low similarity to query sequences, this would at the same

established for Trichoderma, and thus not affect the purpose of this study (but see also the Discussion below). The
respective 26 sequences were aligned with those of Trichoderma and used for a phylogenetic analysis. The result,
shown in Fig. 6, illustrates two points: first, most of the
proteins from Trichoderma formed their own clades. Second, most of hydrophobins from the other 26 fungi
formed clades which received only poor support, which is
best seen by the star phylogeny obtained by Bayesian
analysis (inset in Fig. 6). Third, gene duplications were
evident for those fungi, for which more than two genes
had been found, e.g. M. grisea MGG1 and5, and MGG2
and 4; for P. fulva PF2 and 3.

Expression analysis of the "HFB4"-clade hydrophobin
genes from H. atroviridis
In order to obtain an estimate of the relative expression of
the various Trichoderma/Hypocrea hydrophobin genes, we
first compared the numbers of ESTs in the TrichoEST database (Fig. 7a). The transcripts, which were most abundant,
were from HFBs clustering in different clades, indicating
that there is no cluster or group which is preferentially
strongly expressed. In order to investigate the expression
of members of the largest supported clade (the "HFB4"
clade), we grew H. atroviridis in submerged and surface
culture and examined the expression of the Ha_1b- and
Ha_1c-encoding genes by RT_PCR (Fig. 7b). The results
show that both genes are indeed expressed, and thus both
duplicated copies are probably still functional, but are

Discussion
In this paper, we have investigated the evolutionary processes which give rise to the biodiversity of the fungal class
II hydrophobin genes and proteins. This class of hydrophobins has so far been reported to be restricted to Asco-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/4

mycetes only. Results from this study, however, suggest
that the distribution of these genes may be even more
restricted, i.e. the majority of the members of this class
was actually found in the Sordariomycetes, and only few
were found in Leotiomycetes and Eurotiomycetes. This
picture may however be biased by the fact that Sordariomycetes are overrepresented sequenced genomes, and the
six genes which we retrieved from the two species of
Dothidiomycetes (Passalora, Mycosphaerella) suggest that
this subphylum may also be rich in class II hydrophobins.
We cannot completely rule out that the low number
retrieved for Leotio- and Eurotiomycetes could be due to
a failure to identify these genes by BLAST search. However, our approach also identified several class I hydrophobin genes from all these fungi (data not shown), and
we would therefore assume that our screening was broad
enough to identify all class II genes. Also, our results are
in agreement with the results of manual annotation of
several fungal genomes (Aspergillus spp., M. grisea, N.
crassa, G. zeae, N. haematococcae). Therefore, while it is
possible that a potential HFB encoding gene has been
overlooked, our data indicate that while most species contained only 1 or 2 genes (e.g. Gibberella, Nectria, Botryotinia, Aspergillus spp.), species of Trichoderma/Hypocrea
clearly exceed this with their gene number (i.e. 6 genes in
H. jecorina, 9 in H. virens and 10 in H. atroviridis). The reason for this remains obscure: neither the morphology of
the hyphae, the conidia or of the perithecium of Hypocrea/
Trichoderma show microscopic differences which may
necessitate new or multiple hydrophobins to support
these structures. What differentiates this fungal genus
from others, however, is its mycoparasitic and necrotrophic lifestyle [25]. While completely speculative at this
moment, it is nevertheless possible that a versatile arsenal
of class II hydrophobins may help the fungus to attach to
the hyphae of a broad range of asco- and basidiomycetes.
An amplified spectrum of genes has also been found for
the chitinases of H. jecorina, which undoubtedly also aid
to its mycoparasitic abilities [42]. With the availability of
the hydrophobin gene sequences now in hand for two
strongly mycoparasitic species – H. atroviridis and H. virens
– this work lays a strong phylogenetic foundation to
investigate this possibility by means of respective knockout strains and expression analysis.
The results from this paper show that the class II hydrophobin genes of Trichoderm/Hypocrea contain a high
number of duplicated genes, and at least two cases of
pseudogenes. This suggests that the class II hydrophobins
evolve by a death-and-birth mechanism [22], a term
which has been created for a process in which genes
undergo gene duplications, resulting in the maintenance
of some of the copies for a considerable period of time
whereas other copies are rapidly lost or converted to pseudogenes. Our data render the operation of concerted evo-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:4

lution unlikely, because of the high sequence divergence
and also by the absence of recombination at the hydrophobin loci. (in concerted evolution, member genes
evolve together as a unit by mechanisms such as gene conversion or unequal crossing-over). The fact that most of
the duplicated genes occupy terminal branches in phylogenetic trees and that only few obvious pseudogenes were
found, indicates that the rate of evolution of the class II
hydrophobins in Trichoderma is relatively fast. This rapid
evolution, and equally rapid loss of some genes is also
reflected in the findings that the clades leading to the hfb
genes in Trichoderma seldom contain members of other
fungi, and their evolution thus took place after formation
of the genus Trichoderma.
In addition, the numbers of synonymous differences of
nucleotide sequences between genes from the same species are very large and frequently close to the saturation
level. This high level of synonymous differences further
supports the claim of a birth-and-death evolution at the
DNA level, and supports the long time persistence of these
genes in the genome. On the other hand, genes from different species (e.g. H. atroviridis and H. virens) but belonging to the same phylogenetic clade are highly similar (cf.
Fig. 3). Such a long-term conservation of amino acid
sequence is best explained by strong purifying selection.
Interestingly, and in contrast to Rajashekar et al. [43], we
found only a few individual cases where the Ka/Ks ratio
was >1 and would reveal a history of accelerated evolution. If such a period of accelerated evolution occurred,
most of the gene duplicates from this time apparently
have not been maintained and the Trichoderma/Hypocrea
hydrophobin genes characterized in this study are therefore mostly of recent origin.
The present study also expands our knowledge on the
structure of class II hydrophobins. While most of them are
small, compact proteins, which contain little other structures than the four beta-sheets and the single helix [5,6],
we have detected several proteins which display a long
extended N-terminus (ENT). With respect to class II HFBs,
such structures have so far only been found in H. jecorina
HFB6 [44], and in the pseudohydrophobin QID3 [36].
Interestingly, an ENT was recently also identified in the
class I HFB Hum3 from Ustilago mayidis [45]. Lora et al.
[46] hypothesized that the ENT of QID3 mediates cell
wall binding because it resembles a module which is also
present in plant bimolecular proteins [47-49]. Interestingly, our work reveals that there are at least two types of
these ENTs: a major one, typified by H. virens HV_21a, H.
atroviridis HA_2c, H. lixii QID3, and also in P. fulva HCF6,
and in the spacers between the hydrophobin units in the
multipartite genes of C. paspali and C. fusii, which are
characterized by a conserved repeat of glycine and asparagines; and second type, shown by e.g. H. atroviridis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/4

HA_6a, H. virens HV_1d, and H. jecorina HFB6, in which
the repeated motif is replaced by several PG/PD repeats, a
P-rich stretch or a D-rich stretch, respectively. These proteins did not cluster together, indicating that these proteins do not show a common ancestry of the cysteinecontaining core domain. Among the proteins with this
terminus, one (HV_13a) is intriguing as its ENT is very
short, which gives rise to the speculation that this
extended N-terminus may arise by segment duplication.
Support for this hypothesis would also come from the
multipartite hydrophobins found in Claviceps spp.
[50,51], wherein paralogous hydrophobin gene copies are
connected by P, G and N-rich loops, and which may have
been trapped in the stage of gene duplications at the
extended N-terminus before recombining individual copies into new loci. It is thereby intriguing to observe the
similarity of the nucleotide sequence of the "GN" repeat
(GGTAAT) to that found to act as a recombination hotspot in Penicillium chrysogenum (TGTAA [A/T]; [52]).
Therefore, the occurrence of the Claviceps multipartite
hydrophobins would be due to multiplication of some of
the class II hydrophobins by tandem duplication [53,54],
for which these sequences could act as recombination targets.
Nevertheless, it may still be likely that these ENTs are not
only evolutionary artefacts: the [GN] repeats are reminiscent of S. cerevisiae Ure2p, a regulator of nitrogen catabolism, which can become transformed into a prion form by
polymerization into filaments [55]. These filaments have
an amyloid fibril backbone formed by an N-rich sequence
which form a parallel superpleated beta-structure. The
prion domain is thereby divided into nine seven-residue
segments, each with a four-residue strand and a three-residue turn, that zig-zag in a planar serpentine arrangement,
the interior of the filament being stabilized by H-bond
networks generated by the stacking of N side chains. Interestingly, hydrophobins themselves are known to form
amyloid-like structures [56-58], and we consider it therefore possible that the ENTs form defined structures which
additionally contribute to the structural rigidity of the
hydrophobins.
During phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence,
most hydrophobins from Trichoderma/Hypocrea did not
group into strongly supported clades. However, a few
exceptions were noted, notably the clades containing H.
jecorina HFB1, HFB2 and HFB4, respectively. Clade
"HFB4" is intriguing as its members – in contrast to HFB1
and HFB2 [31] were not expressed in submerged culture
but only found in surface cultivation. This clade may thus
contain hydrophobins relevant for hyphal growth. Unfortunately, the differences in aa-sequence with that of the
other Trichoderma hydrophobins do not provide a clear
clue as to the understanding of its function. One notable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/4

change is the substitution of the phenylalanine residue in
the middle of the single helix, which is otherwise conserved in the class II hydrophobins from all other fungi
(with the exception of A. niger and V. lecanii which contain an L and M, respectively), by a leucine, which may
give rise to weaker hydrophobic interaction within the
protein (hydrophobicity index F = 2.24; L = 1.99). However, Linder et al. [3] speculated that the aromatic ring of
F39 is inserted between two Pro-residues (P11 and P50)
from the two β hairpin structures into the protein and
may serve to stabilize the fold through hydrogen bonds.
Interestingly, members of the "HFB 4 clade" consistently
have P11 replaced by an A which may hydrophobically
interact with this L. In addition, the first beta-strand contains a conserved motif of two asparagines which provide
it with a positive charge. Hydropathy plots show that
members of the "HFB4 clade" have almost no hydrophobicity in the area between aa20 and aa40, and their helix
is in contrast positively charged. While the consequence of
these changes on the structure and function is however
unclear our phylogenetic analysis sets the stage for future
functional studies that may include transcript and gene
deletion analysis.

Conclusion
Summarizing, this study offers a model of evolution
which gave rise to the biodiversity of class II hydrophobins. The more than 70 members identified in this study
enabled us to delineate the consensus for both essential aa
sequence parts as well as for the tolerance to aa modifications to these small compact proteins. Our phylogenetic
analysis will inform future functional genomic studies
aimed at determination of more specific functions for
each of the Trichoderma/Hypocrea class II hydrophobins. In
view of the strong potential of the hydrophobins in
"white" biotechnology, this information may offer their
further improvement by molecular evolution [59-61].

1 L shake-flasks containing 200 ml of the medium at
25°C (250 RPM) or on plates (in this case the medium
was solidified by the addition of 15 g·l-1 agar).
Analysis of hydrophobin gene expression
Mycelia were withdrawn at selected time points as indicated and total RNA isolated by the method of Chomzynski and Sacchi [62]. The RNA extract was treated with
DNAse I (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and purified
using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). The purified RNA was reverse transcribed
using the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Fermentas) with the oligo(dT)18 primer supplied by
the manufacturer.

Appropriate aliquots of the cDNA were used for amplification by PCR utilising the GoTaq™ system (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). The assays contained 2.5 mM MgCl2
and 0.4 μM of the forward and reverse primer each (Table
4). The primers were designed in such a way that they
aligned to different exons of the hfb genes to detect a possible contamination with genomic DNA. The amplification protocol consisted of an initial 1 min denaturation
step at 95°C, followed by 28 cycles of denaturation (1
min at 95°C), annealing (1 min, see Tab. 1 for temperatures) and elongation (1 min at 72°C) and a final elongation step (7 min at 72°C). 40 μl of each assay were
separated on 2% agarose containing 0.5 μg·ml-1 ethidium
bromide. Expression of the elongation factor 1-alpha
(tef1) gene [63] served as a loading control. For negative
controls, the DNAse digestion, cDNA synthesis and the
PCR were repeated without addition of the reverse transcriptase, in which case no amplicons were detected, thus
confirming that the detected bands indeed result from
cDNA synthesised from RNA (data not shown).

rea virens and Hypocrea atroviridis and the TrichoEST EST
database which includes EST sequences from 9 different
Trichoderma spp. [38] using TBLAST (protein vs translated
nucleotide). In the case of duplicates, the genomic
sequence was given preference. Table 1 summarizes the
genes, proteins, accession numbers or locations of the
sequences thereby retrieved.
To obtain class II hydrophobin genes from other ascomycetes, the genes compiled by Linder et al. [3] were used as
a starting point for a TBLAST search of the NCBI data base,
using the filtering option turned off, and sequences which
had not yet been included by Linder et al. [3] were
retrieved. Apart of genes deposited from specific research,
this database contains genome sequences from Neurospora
crassa, Magnaporthe grisea, Gibberella zeae, and several
Aspergillus spp. In addition, the same procedure was used
to mine the genome databases of Nectria cinnabarina [64],
Mycophaerella graminicola [65] and Botryotinia fuckeliana (=
Botrytis cinerea, [66]), fungi whose sequences have not yet
been included in the NCBI database. Genes thereby
retrieved were then themselves used as a query in BLAST
search as described above, and the procedure repeated
until no new gene/protein was detected. The amino acid
sequences of the retrieved proteins were aligned, and class
I hydrophobins (identified according to the criteria
described by Linder et al. [3]; e.g. by the difference in the
number of amino acids between the conserved cysteins
and their hydropathy profile) removed.
Phylogenetic analysis
DNA and protein sequences were visually aligned using
Genedoc 2.6 [67]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by
the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [68], using the computer program MEGA, Version 4.0 [69], and by Bayesian
analysis (MrBayes v3.0B4 program). The model of evolution and prior settings for individual loci was GTR + I + Γ.
Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) sampling was performed with four incrementally
heated chains that were simultaneously run for 1 and 3
millions of generations. To check for potentially poor
mixing of MCMCMC, each analysis was repeated three
times. The convergence of MCMCMC was monitored by
examining the value of the marginal likelihood through
generations. Convergence of substitution rate and rate
heterogeneity model parameters was also checked. Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) were obtained from the
50% majority rule consensus of trees sampled every 100
generations after removing the 500 first trees using the
"burn" command. PP values lower then 0.95 were not
considered significant.
Test for recombination
Two different procedures were applied to detect recombination by comparing adjacent sequence windows and to
detect significant departures from a single phylogenetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/4

history within the same alignment. First, we used difference of sums of squares (DSS, [70]) to compare the fit of
genetic distance matrices for two adjacent windows to the
same tree topology to produce the DSS statistic, the significance of which was determined through parametric bootstrapping in TOPALi [71].
In addition we tested whether recombination would be
apparent from the phylogeny of hydrophobin genes. This
was done by the split decomposition method in SplitsTree, version 2.4 [40], using pairwise distances under the
Kimura 3-ST model [72]. This method visualizes recombination events by depicting the shortest pathway linking
sequences, rather than forcing them into a bifurcating tree
[39,40].
Tests for evolutionary mechanisms
To test the fit of the sequences to the model of neutral evolution, the D test statistic proposed by Tajima and Nei
[73] was computed with the DnaSP program [74]. To this
end, the Genedoc alignment was exported as a PHYLIP
interleaved format. Only coding sequences, after removal
of the preprosequence-encoding nt areas, were used for
the analyses. Introns were removed from chromosomal
nt-sequences by comparison with available cDNA (EST)
sequences, or by relying on prediction of consensus splicing sites [75,76]. In the case of the multipartite hydrophobins from Claviceps spp. [50,51], each hydrophobinencoding nt-area was treated as a separate entity. The
extent of nucleotide divergence was estimated by using
the uncorrected p distance [77]. The proportions of synonymous (were calculated pS) and nonsynonymous (pN) differences per site by the modified Nei-Gojobori method
implemented in DNASp [12].
