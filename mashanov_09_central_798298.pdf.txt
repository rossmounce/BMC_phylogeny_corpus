Abstract
Background: Echinoderms and chordates belong to the same monophyletic taxon, the Deuterostomia.
In spite of significant differences in body plan organization, the two phyla may share more common traits
than was thought previously. Of particular interest are the common features in the organization of the
central nervous system. The present study employs two polyclonal antisera raised against bovine
Reissner's substance (RS), a secretory product produced by glial cells of the subcomissural organ, to study
RS-like immunoreactivity in the central nervous system of sea cucumbers.
Results: In the ectoneural division of the nervous system, both antisera recognize the content of
secretory vacuoles in the apical cytoplasm of the radial glia-like cells of the neuroepithelium and in the
flattened glial cells of the non-neural epineural roof epithelium. The secreted immunopositive material
seems to form a thin layer covering the cell apices. There is no accumulation of the immunoreactive
material on the apical surface of the hyponeural neuroepithelium or the hyponeural roof epithelium.
Besides labelling the supporting cells and flattened glial cells of the epineural roof epithelium, both anti-RS
antisera reveal a previously unknown putative glial cell type within the neural parenchyma of the
holothurian nervous system.
Conclusion: Our results show that: a) the glial cells of the holothurian tubular nervous system produce
a material similar to Reissner's substance known to be synthesized by secretory glial cells in all chordates
studied so far; b) the nervous system of sea cucumbers shows a previously unrealized complexity of glial
organization. Our findings also provide significant clues for interpretation of the evolution of the nervous
system in the Deuterostomia. It is suggested that echinoderms and chordates might have inherited the RSproducing radial glial cell type from the central nervous system of their common ancestor, i.e., the last
common ancestor of all the Deuterostomia.

Background
According to both traditional and recent molecular phylogenies, the Deuterostomia constitutes a monophyletic
supertaxon, which includes three phyla Chordata, Hemichordata and Echinodermata. Echinoderms and hemichordates are grouped together into the clade
Ambulacraria, which is treated as a sister group to the
chordate lineage [1-4]. Despite the recent progress in
molecular phylogenetic analyses, developmental biology,
and paleontological discoveries, the mystery of deuterostomian evolution is still far from being fully resolved. In
part, this may be due to the need of revisiting macro- and
microscopic anatomy of some of the basal groups using
standard state-of-the-art morphological techniques. For
instance, to interpret the growing body of data on gene
expression patterns in echinoderms and hemichordates,
the scholars often have to rely upon excellent, but largely
outdated, descriptions, which had been published even
before electron microscopy came into wide use [5-7].
Since the fierce nineteenth-century debate between Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Georges Cuvier, the organization of
the nervous system has been one of the foremost criteria
in understanding and comparing the body plans of multicellular animals. The potential of the nervous system to
provide a wealth of valuable phylogenetic clues has been
also emphasized in recent gene expression pattern studies
[6-9].
Echinoderms have often been referred to as highly derived
and, therefore, considered of limited or no importance for
reconstructing the phylogenetic history of the Deuterostomia [8,10]. However, in spite of the set of peculiar features
that characterize the phylum (such as pentaradial symmetry in extant forms, mesodermal calcareous endoskeleton,
a unique water-vascular system of coelomic nature),
recent studies have shown that there may be more common traits between echinoderms and chordates, than was
previously thought [11-15]. The phylum Echinodermata
is the only non-chordate deuterostomian group that has a
centralized nervous system (CNS), represented in these
animals by a circumoral nerve ring and (usually five)
radial nerve cords. One of the most intriguing common
traits shared by the central nervous system of chordates
and echinoderms is the presence of a non-neural cell type
that is well defined by prominent bundles of intermediate
filaments in the cytoplasm and an elongated shape that
allows the cells to span the whole thickness of the neural
parenchyma. In all vertebrates studied so far, this cell type,
termed radial glia, plays a crucial role in histogenesis of
the CNS (reviewed by [16]). They serve as intermediate
precursors between the so-called neuroepithelial cells that
form the wall of the undifferentiated neural tube and the
following differentiated progeny. In echinoderms, similar
radial glia-like cells appear in the nervous tissue soon after
the anlage of the adult nervous system is established in an

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/11

early juvenile [17] and remain the key non-neural component of the radial nerve cords and the nerve ring in the
adult animal [11,14,18]. There is no data on the role of
these cells in histogenesis of the nervous tissue in normal
development or adult neurogenesis, but it has been
recently shown that, at least in sea cucumbers, they do
contribute significantly to the post-traumatic regeneration
by guiding the migration of neurons and giving rise to
new neurons and glial cells in the regenerating nervous
system [15].
In chordates, radial glial cells of certain regions of the
nervous system are known to produce and secrete the socalled Reissner's substance (RS) [19-21]. The main component of RS is the glycoprotein known as SCO-spondin
[22]. The exact function of this protein still remains to be
determined, but analysis of its amino acid sequence suggests that it may act as an extracellular modulator of cell
adhesion, that may be important for cell migration and
axonal guidance [22,23]. This hypothesis is supported by
in vitro experiments showing that SCO-spondin can trigger an increased sprouting and neurite outgrowth, as well
as neuronal aggregation [24,25].
The main source of RS in vertebrates is the subcomissural
organ located in the roof of the third ventricle of the brain,
at the entrance to the Sylvian aqueduct. It is composed of
secretory radial glial cells that differentiate early in embryogenesis but persist into adulthood and maintain the ability to produce and release their secretion in mature
animals [26,27]. The Reissner's substance is also transiently produced and secreted early in embryogenesis by
radial glia of the floor plate [28-30].
The RS-producing secretory glial cell type seems to be a
taxonomically widespread and phylogenetically conserved trait. Their presence has been confirmed in all
major chordate taxa, ranging from human to cephalochordates [19,31-33]. Moreover, supporting radial glialike cells of the ectoneural radial cords of an echinoderm,
the sea star Asterias rubens, were shown to be able to produce and secrete RS-like material [11]. The ability of echinoderm glial cells to produce RS is of particular interest
not only from the evolutionary point of view, but also
because echinoderms can rapidly repair injured nervous
tissue and RS is known to be involved in neuronal aggregation and neurite outgrowth. However, since the sea star
is the only echinoderm with the documented presence of
RS in the nervous system, there can be a problem. The
extant echinoderms display two basic designs of their central nervous system. Asteroids and crinoids, are characterized by the superficial localization of the ectoneural radial
cords and the nerve ring, which are integrated in the epidermis of the oral body surface [11,34,35]. In the remaining three classes, holothurians, brittle stars, and

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:11

echinoids, the ectoneural system is internalized to form a
subepidermal hollow nerve tube [13,14,18]. It has been
convincingly shown that the production and secretion of
RS is not unique to the secretory glial cells of the CNS. In
planarians, for instance, strongly immunoreactive secretory cells are located in the epidermis. Certain vertebrate
epidermal cells are also reported to be positively labeled
with anti-RS antibodies [36]. Although the ectoneural
cords of the sea star belong to the central nervous system,
they are actually still a part of the epidermis. Therefore, it
remains unclear whether the RS-like material plays some
specific role(s) in the nervous system of the sea star, or it
is produced and secreted by the gliocytes just to contribute
to the functions performed by the epidermis. A related
question is whether the radial glia-like supporting cells of
the ectoneural neuroepithelium still retain the ability to
produce RS in those echinoderms, whose tubular ectoneural cords have lost their connection with the epidermis

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/11

and, vice versa, whether the epidermis devoid of the radial
nerve cord is still able to produce this material independently of glial cells.
In this study, we describe RS-like immunoreactivity in sea
cucumbers, echinoderms with a tubular nervous system,
which has been recently emerging as a valuable model system used to resolve some controversial issues in organization, histogenesis, and post-traumatic regeneration of the
echinoderm nervous system [14,15,17,37].

Nervous system
To provide the reader with some background on the
organization of the sea cucumber nervous system, a brief
overview follows (see references [14] and [34] for more
detail). The major components of the nervous system in
adult sea cucumbers are a circumoral nerve ring and five

radial nerve cords (Fig. 1A). The nerve cords run from the
anterior to the posterior end of the body within the inner
connective tissue layer of the body wall. They are accompanied by other radial organs, including (from the outside
to the inside) the haemal lacuna, a water-vascular canal,
and a longitudinal muscle band (Fig. 1, 2A). Each of the
radial nerve cords is composed of two closely apposed
strips of nervous tissue, the outer ectoneural cord and the
inner hyponeural cord (Fig. 1, 2B). The ectoneural part of
the radial nerve cord is considerably thicker than the
hyponeural band, and the two are interconnected via

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/11

numerous short neural bridges along the length of the
radial nerve. At the anterior end of the body, the ectoneural bands of adjacent radial cords fuse together to form a
circumoral nerve ring that lies perpendicular to the main
body axis. The nerve ring of sea cucumbers is devoid of the
hyponeural component (Fig. 1A, 2C). The histological
organization of the ectoneural ring is similar to the organization of the ectoneural part of the radial nerve cord.
Both the ectoneural and hyponeural parts of the nervous
system are hollow tubular structures, whose cavities are
called the epineural and hyponeural canals, respectively

(Fig. 2B, C). The lumen of the former is often quite narrow, slit-like, so that it can be difficult to detect it on paraffin or cryostat sections. The hyponeural canal is usually
much wider. The inner wall of the epineural canal and the
outer wall of the hyponeural canal are thickened to form
a tall neuroepithelium. The opposite side of the canals is
overlaid by a thin non-neuronal epithelium, the epineural
or hyponeural epithelium, respectively.
A distinct feature of both the ectoneural and hyponeural
neuroepithelia is the glial framework composed of glial
supporting cells, which bear striking similarities to radial
glial cells of vertebrates. The cell bodies of these cells lie in
the apical region of the neuroepithelium and make contact with the lumen of the epineural or hyponeural canal.
The bases of the somata extend to form long basal processes, which penetrate the whole thickness of the underlying parenchyma and anchor to the basal lamina of the
neuroepithelium (Fig. 2B). Another characteristic feature
of the supporting glial cells is the long bundles of intermediate filaments, which run from the apical region of the
cell to the distal end of the basal processes [14,18]. The
glial cells that make up the non-neuronal roof epithelia of
the epineural and hyponeural canals, although different
in shape, are believed to be a variant of radial glia-like
supporting cells and, like the latter, also contain bundles
of intermediate filaments in their cytoplasm [14].
In the radial nerve cord (RNC), immunostaining with
both anti-RF antibodies produced very strong intracellular
and extracellular labelling associated with the apical surface of the ectoneural neuroepithelium and the squamous
epineural roof epithelium (Fig. 3A–D). The extracellular
immunoreactive material seems to be deposited as a caplike covering on the apices of the cells (Fig. 3C, D). These
individual patches are often seen to fuse together to form
a continuous layer on the apical surface of the epithelium.
However, the labelled material never aggregates in the
form of a morphologically identifiable compact structure
within the lumen of the epineural canal. Both antisera
also reveal immunoreactive cell bodies with fine cytoplasmic staining, which are scattered singly within the parenchyma of the ectoneural neuroepithelium (Fig. 3C, E).
The immunopositive cell bodies vary greatly in shape,
from rounded to fusiform or irregular, and often seem to
give off one or more processes. There is also scattered dotted labelling in the ectoneural parenchyma (Fig. 3C), the
dots being most probably the cross-sectioned cellular
processes. Some of the labelled processes lay in the plane
of sectioning (Fig. 3E).
The most significant difference in the pattern of RS-like
immunoreactivity between the ectoneural and the
hyponeural parts of the radial nerve cord is that there is no
accumulation of the immunoreactive material on the api-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/11

cal surface of the hyponeural neuroepithelium or the
hyponeural roof epithelium (Fig. 4A, B). Although both
antisera do label cells in the the hyponeural part of the
RNC, the immunopositive cells are less abundant than in
the ectoneural part. The two antisera used in the present
study show a difference in immunostaining pattern in the
hyponeural parenchyma. The RS-K10 antiserum labels
singly scattered cell body and processes, as it does in the
ectoneural parenchyma (not shown). The AFRU antiserum produces a dotted immunostaining which is much
denser than in the ectoneural neuroepithelium. This is
particularly evident in the lateral regions of the hyponeural neuroepithelium (Fig. 4B).
The pattern of RS-like immunolabelling in the nerve ring
was identical to that in the ectoneural part of the RNC
(Fig. 4C, D), i.e. the strongest immunoreactivity is associated with the apical region of the ectoneural epithelium
and with the epineural epithelium, although there are
also some more moderately labelled cell bodies and processes in the neural parenchyma.
It is interesting to note that, contrary to the data on the
basal route of secretion of the RS in chordates [38], neither the ectoneural, nor the hyponeural neuroepithelia of
the two sea cucumber species studied showed any significant RS-like immunostaining associated with the basal
region.
To define precisely the localization of the RS-like material
to particular cell types and also at the subcellular level, we
have implemented immunoelectron microscopy. This
approach shows that the intense labelling revealed by the
immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescent techniques
in the tissues bordering the epineural canal is confined to
the supporting glial cells of the ectoneural neuroepithelium and the flattened glial cells of the epineural non-neural roof epithelium (Fig. 5A–D), which can be clearly
distinguished from other cell types in the nervous tissue
by the presence of prominent bundles of intermediate filaments in their cytoplasm [14]. Within these glial cells,
the anti-RS antibodies recognize the content of electrontranslucent vacuoles in the apical cytoplasm (Fig. 5A–D).
They measure about 0.5 μm, vary in shape from spherical
to irregular, and sometimes contain a fine fibrillar or flocculent material, but the labelling is not necessarily associated with it. The vacuoles are occasionally seen to fuse
with the apical plasma membrane, and the immunoreactive material is released into the lumen of the epineural
canal (Fig. 5C, D). The secreted immunopositive substances seem to remain attached to the cells that produced
them forming a thin layer covering the cell apices (Figs.
5A, B). This extracellular labelling on the cell surface is
often very strong and is usually more intense than the
labelling of the vacuolar content within the cells. How-

ever, some glial cells show weak immunostaining on their
apical surface.
In agreement with our data obtained with immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques, the immunogold approach with anti-RF antisera also reveals
immunoreactive cells within the neural parenchyma (Fig.
5E, F). These subspherical to irregularly shaped cells are
interspersed among the processes of neuronal and glial
cells. The elliptical nucleus contains large patches of heterochromatin and prominent nucleolus. The cytoplasm
contains mitochondria, cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and, most notably, vacuoles with heterogeneous immunoreactive content. These vacuoles seem to
vary greatly in size and abundance. When large and
numerous, they occupy most of the perinuclear cytoplasm
and displace the nucleus to the periphery (Fig. 5F). Occasionally, the vacuoles lie in a very close proximity to the
plasma membrane. However, we have not seen convincing signs of the release of the immunoreactive material
into the extracellular space. It is important to note that
this cell type exhibits no morphological features of supporting glial cells (bundles of intermediate filaments) or
neurons (characteristic dense and/or light membranebound vesicles).
Epidermis
Besides specifically recognizing structures within the nervous system, both polyclonal antisera also strongly stain
the epidermis (Fig. 6). Immunoreactivity is very intense
on the apical surface of the cells, where a thin continuous
layer of the immunoreactive material separates the epidermis from the surrounding environment. The lateral and
basal surfaces of the cells are also occasionally labelled,
but much weaker than the apices (Fig. 6C). Consistent
with the immunolabelling of mostly the extracellularly
located material, the epithelial cells of the epidermis displayed ultrastructural signs of moderate secretory activity

including the presence of cisternae of the endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi apparatus and secretory vacuoles of varying sizes and morphologies.

Discussion
Specificity of the immunostaining
The important issue in any immunocytochemical study is
the specificity of recognition of the epitope by the primary
antibody. The two polyclonal rabbit antisera used in the
present study were raised against Reissner's fiber isolated
from the bovine spinal cord and a wealth of subsequent
studies has convincingly demonstrated that both antisera
specifically recognized Reissner's substance (RS) in a wide
range of animal species from mammals to planarians
[11,19,20,31,36,39,40]. Besides some minor differences
in immunolabelling in the hyponeural part of the radial
nerve cord, both antibodies used in the present study
show similar staining patterns with different visualization
techniques
employed
(peroxidase-anti-peroxidase
approach, immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy). The positive immunostaining of holothurian tissues is in agreement with a previous study showing the
anti-RS immunoreaction in the ectoneural cord of the sea
star Asterias rubens [11] and a recent identification of the
gene coding for SCO-spondin, the major component of
RS, in the genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus
nudus [41]. The predicted sequence of the protein shows a
high degree of conservation of its multidomain structure
when compared to the sequences from the Vertebrata.
Unexpected complexity of glial organization
One of the earliest detailed morphological descriptions of
glial supporting cells (Stützzellen) in the nervous system
of echinoderms belongs to Bargmann et al., [42]. However, the very relevance of the term glia to the echinoderm
nervous system was heavily disputed afterwards [43,44].
This controversy could not be completely resolved upon
the basis of merely microscopic observations. Therefore, a

need was realized for testing the available reliable markers
of glial cells on the echinoderm nervous tissue. In their
pioneering work, Viehweg et al. [11] showed that a radial
glia-like non-neuronal cell type in the ectoneural system
of the sea star Asterias rubens is specifically labelled by antibodies raised against bovine Reissner's substance (RS), a
phylogenetically conservative secretion produced by glial
cells of chordates. In the present study, we demonstrate
that two different polyclonal anti-RS antisera reveal three
of non-neuronal cell types in the nervous system of sea
cucumbers: tall supporting cells in the neuroepithelia,
cells of the non-neural roof epithelia, and relatively rare
parenchymal cells.

Figure 6

The supporting cells are a very characteristic feature of
echinoderm neuroepithelia. They are morphologically
similar to radial glial cells of chordates and are readily distinguishable from other cell types due to their elongated
shape, perpendicular orientation to the surfaces of the
neuroepithelium, and conspicuous bundles of neurofilaments in the cytoplasm [11,14,18,42]. Compared to the
starfish, holothurians, and possibly other echinoderms
with closed ambulacra, have acquired an additional
source of the RS-like substance, the non-neural epineural
epithelium that roofs over the ectoneural hyponeural neuroepithelium to seal the epineural canals. The cells of this
epithelium are often flattened in shape and, under normal
conditions, are never associated with neurons, but are
otherwise very similar to the supporting cells of the neuroepithelia and also contain prominent bundles of intermediate filaments in their cytoplasm [14]. The two cell
types also display similar patterns of RS-like immunoreactivity. The positively labelled material is seen in the vacuoles, which eventually seem to fuse with the apical plasma
membrane and release their content which remains
attached to the apical surfaces of the cells. Therefore, our
data confirm the observations by Viehweg et al. [11], who
showed that the supporting cells of the starfish ectoneural

neuroepithelium produce and secrete RS-like material.
However, there can be also some differences in the way
the RS-like substance is secreted in asteroids and holothuroids. Although the secretory glial cells of the starfish
are reported to release the immunopositive both apically
and basally, we have observed only apical secretion into
the lumen of the epineural canal in both sea cucumber
species studied.
Besides the two aforementioned cell types, which have
been already known as glial cells in echinoderms
[11,14,42], the immunostaining with anti-RS antibodies
reveals a previously undescribed cell type within the neural parenchyma of the holothurian CNS. These cells are
morphologically distinct from both neurons and supporting cells. They possess neither bundles of intermediate filaments, which are the hallmark of the supporting cells,
nor the membrane-bound vesicles that are always seen in
neurons. The presence of positively labelled vacuoles in
the cytoplasm of these cells, suggest that they are able to
produce the RS-like substance. It remains unclear, however, whether they release this material. Although, these
parenchymal putative gliocytes account for only about 1%
of the total cell population of the radial nerve cord (Mashanov et al., unpublished observation), they are consistently found in different regions of the holothurian CNS.
The function of this cell type remains to be determined.
In summary, immunostaining with antibodies raised
against Reissner's substance, a phylogenetically conservative secretory product of glial cells in chordates, suggests
that (a) the non-neuronal cell types of the echinoderm
nervous tissue can be regarded as true glial cells and that
(b) the CNS of these non-chordate Deuterostomia comprises several types of glial cells indicating a much higher
complexity of neurohistological and functional organization than was thought previously.
Possible function(s) of the RS-like material in the
echinoderm nervous system
Our data suggest that the RS-like material can possibly
carry out a variety of functions within a single organism,
since it is present in such different tissues as the epidermis
and the nervous tissue. These findings coincide with other
reports demonstrating the presence of RS and its major
component, SCO-spondin, both in the nervous system
(e.g., [11,19]) and in non-neural tissues [36,45].
Sequence analysis suggests that SCO-spondin is a multidomain protein with a very complex structure [23,41],
which can be involved in a wide range of processes mediated via protein/protein interactions.

The only study of RS-secreting glia in echinoderms published so far [11] deals with the ectoneural system of a sea
star, which is integrated in the epidermis of the body wall.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/11

The authors demonstrate that the apically secreted immunopositive substance contributes to the formation of the
so-called hyalin layer, a film of extracellular material,
which separates the epidermis from the environment.
Unfortunately, they do not provide any data on RS-like
immunoreactivity in other areas of the epidermis lying
outside the radial nerve cord. Therefore, it remained
unclear whether this positively labelled secretion played
some specific role in the nervous system itself or it was
produced just as a component of the hyalin layer, as in
other regions of the epidermis. In the present study, we
demonstrate that holothurian epidermal cells show clear
RS-like immunoreactivity. However, strong immunopositive staining is also observed in the submerged ectoneural
tube, which has no connection with the epidermis in holothurians. This means that the ectoneural system of echinoderms with closed ambulacra did not lose the ability to
produce RS-like material as it detached from the epidermis to give rise to the subcutaneous ectoneural tube in the
course of echinoderm evolution. These findings, in turn,
imply that the RS-like material does play some important
role(s) both in the echinoderm nervous systems and the
epidermis. The function of RS in the epidermis is completely unknown [36]. As to the nervous system, RS has
been shown to be involved in axonal guidance, as well as
in promoting neuronal survival, differentiation, and
aggregation in vertebrates [24,30,41]. This neurogenetic
role could be of particular interest with respect to known
abilities of echinoderms to quickly restore their nervous
system after various types of injury [15,34,37,46,47].
RS is also known to be involved in regulation of cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis in vertebrates presumably
through regulation of the rate of the cerebrospinal fluid
production and/or by preventing the central canal of the
tubular CNS from stenosis (reviewed in [48] and [49]).
We currently know nothing about the function of the
epineural canal in echinoderms. In sea cucumbers, it is
usually much narrower than the hyponeural canal, but it
is possible that its slit-like lumen should nevertheless
remain open for some reason. Therefore, the RS-like material, which forms a nearly continuous film of immunoreactive labelling on the apical surface of the ectoneural
neuroepithelium and the roof epithelium, may be
involved in preventing the epineural canal from closing.

Conclusion
A full understanding of the fundamental principles of
organization and function of our own nervous system can
hardly be achieved without the knowledge of how the
human CNS might have evolved. In spite of recent
advances in molecular systematics and gene expression
pattern studies, there is still no common agreement about
the evolution of the deuterostomian body plans in general and of the nervous system in particular. We believe

Page 11 of 15

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:11

that studying the phylum Echinodermata can be a suitable
way to resolve many of the issues in the evolutionary biology of the Deuterostomia. Our results showing that glial
cells of the holothurian tubular nervous system produce
Reissner's substance, a material released by secretory glial
cells in all chordates studied so far [19,39,50], add to the
growing body of evidence that there are more parallels
between the nervous systems of echinoderms and chordates than was previously thought [11-15]. Possible
homology between the ectoneural plate (in crinoids and
asteroids) or tube (in echinoids, ophiuroids, and holothurians) of echinoderms and the neural plate/tube of chordates is suggested by a number of morphological and gene
expression parallelisms (see [12] and [13] for a review).
First, both the ectoneural cord of echinoderms and the
neural tube of chordates develop by proliferation of the
mid-line subpopulation of ectodermal cells, which in all
chordates and cryptosyringid echinoderms (echinoids,
ophiuroids, and holothurians) eventually get submerged
below the epidermis. The process of internalization of the
central nervous system may have evolved independently
in the two phyla. Second, development of both the echinoderm ectoneural cords and the chordate neural plate is
induced by signal from mesodermal structures (the
hydrocoel and notochord, respectively). Third, some of
the regulatory genes that organize the chordate neural
plate are also expressed in the echinoderm ectoneural
cord. One of the most intriguing features shared by both
phyla is the presence of a particular non-neuronal cell
type in the central nervous system, which is known as
radial glia in chordates and supporting glia in echinoderms. In both cases, the cells (a) are very tall and are oriented with their main axis perpendicular to the plane of
the neuroepithelium; (b) span the whole thickness of the
latter from the apical to basal surface; (c) contain prominent bundles of intermediate filaments in their cytoplasm; (d) play a key role in embryonic and/or posttraumatic neurogenesis; and (e) produce and release a
glycoprotein material known as Reissner's substance.
Since both echinoderms and chordates possess a centralized nervous system with a distinct RS-producing radial
glial cell type, it would be most parsimonious to believe
that they both might have inherited those traits from their
common ancestor. This implies that the last common
ancestor of all the Deuterostomia could have possess a
central nervous system (obviously, located in the epidermis, like the ectoneural bands in sea stars and sea lilies)
with RS-secreting radial glia-like cells.

Methods
Animal sampling and tissue fixation
Adult individuals of Eupentacta fraudatrix Djakonov et Baranova, 1958 (Holothuroidea, Dendrochirota) were collected from Vostok Bay, Sea of Japan, in October 2006.
Mature individuals of Holothuria glaberrima Selenka, 1867

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/11

(Holothuroidea, Aspidochirota) in the intertidal zone of
the rocky northeast coast of Puerto Rico in October 2006
and December 2008. Pharyngeal bulbs and small pieces
of the body wall containing the complex of radial organs
were immersion fixed overnight at 4°C (see below). After
fixation, the samples were either processed further or
stored in the respective buffer until needed (up to 1
month).
Polyclonal antisera
The rabbit antiserum AFRU was raised against bovine
Reissner's fiber extracted in the medium containing urea
(0.1 M Tris-HCl pH8.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01 M DTT, 8 M
urea) [19]. RS-K10 rabbit polyclonal antiserum was
obtained using bovine Reissner's substance as the immunogen, but the extraction was performed in a different
medium: 0,05 M PBS containing 0,14 M NaCl [26]. Both
antisera have been used extensively previously, and have
been shown to specifically recognize Reissner's substance
in a wide range of diverse species (see Discussion).
Immunoperoxidase histochemistry
For peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) immunohistochemistry, the tissue samples were fixed in (i) 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.15% picric acid in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.6) adjusted to 1090 mOsm and in
(ii) 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in
0.05 M PBS containing 0.14 M NaCl. The tissues were
then decalcified in 25% EDTA (pH 7.4) [51] and embedded in paraffin. Sections (7 μm) were cut with a sliding
microtome (Reichert), mounted on slides, re-hydrated
and subjected to quenching of endogenous peroxidase
activity with 3% H2O2 for 10 min. The immunostaining
was performed using Histostain Plus Kit (Zymed/Invitrogen) following manufacturer's protocol. The first antibodies, AFRU and RS-K10, were applied at a dilution of
1:2000 for 24 to 48 h at 4°C. The immunostaining was
visualized using diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as a chromogen. The nuclei were slightly counterstained with
Meyer's hematoxylin. The sections were dehydrated and
mounted in DPX (Fluka).

For general morphology studies, some of the paraffin sections were stained with Heidenhain's azan (azocarmine,
aniline blue, and orange G) [51].
Transmission immunoelectron microscopy
For immunoelectron microscopy, the fixation was the
same as for PAP immunohistochemistry. Pre-embedding
labelling technique was used to localize the antigen at the
ultrastructural level. After washes in the respective buffer
and cryoprotection in 10%, 20%, and 30% buffered
sucrose, the samples were frozen in the cryoembedding
OCT medium (Sakura) and stored at -25°C until cryostat
sectioning (10 μm). Sections were applied onto gelatin-

coated slides, dried overnight at 45°C and then stored at 25°C. When needed, the slides were equilibrated at room
temperature and washed in PBS. In order to minimize
nonspecific antibody binding, the sections were preincubated in 0.05 M buffered glycine followed by 0.1% BSAc™ (Aurion). The primary antibodies were applied at dilutions ranging from 1:1000 to 1:2000 for 24–48 h at 4°C.
After thorough washing, the sections were incubated in a
secondary gold-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (the
average gold cluster diameter below 0.8 nm) (Aurion) and
briefly post-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium
tetroxide. To facilitate observation of ultra-small gold
clusters, silver enhancement reagents R-Gent SE-EM and
R-Gent SE-LM (Aurion), which produce smaller and larger
grains, respectively, were used following the protocol,
provided by the manufacturer. The sections were then
dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Araldite (Serva).
Ultrathin sections (50–70 nm) were cut with glass knives
using an Ultracut E (Reichert) ultramicrotome, collected
on coated slot grids, and slightly counterstained with a
saturated uranyl acetate solution in methanol, and examined and photographed in a Zeiss EM 10 transmission
electron microscope.
Immunofluorescent histochemistry
For immunofluorescent microscopy, the tissues were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4, 1030
mOsm). Frozen sections were obtained as described
above. Slides were incubated in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Autofluorescence was reduced by treating the
sections with 0.1 M glycine in PBS. The specimens were
then incubated for 1 hour in PBS containing 2% of normal goat serum. The primary anti-RS antisera were
applied overnight (4°C) at a dilution of 1:2000 or 1:4000.
After rinsing, the slides were incubated in FITC-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibodies (1:100) (Biosource) for
1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were visualized with
Hoechst 33342. The sections were mounted in buffered
glycerol (pH 8.5), viewed and photographed with a Nikon
Eclipse 600 microscope equipped with a Spot RT3 digital
camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Post-acquisition
image processing including composite image generation,
brightness/contrast adjustments, multi-panel figure
assembling, and lettering was performed with public
domain programs ImageJ Fiji (available at http://
pacific.mpi-cbg.de) and GIMP 2.6.1 (available at http://
www.gimp.org).

Controls were performed by substituting the first antibody with an antibody dilution buffer. Control slides/
grids showed that little or no unspecific labelling was produced in the tissues of interest by any of the techniques
employed (Fig. 7).
