Abstract
Background: Members of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) family share sequence similarity and the
11-stranded β-barrel fold. Fluorescence or bright coloration, observed in many members of this family, is
enabled by the intrinsic properties of the polypeptide chain itself, without the requirement for cofactors.
Amino acid sequence of fluorescent proteins can be altered by genetic engineering to produce variants
with different spectral properties, suitable for direct visualization of molecular and cellular processes.
Naturally occurring GFP-like proteins include fluorescent proteins from cnidarians of the Hydrozoa and
Anthozoa classes, and from copepods of the Pontellidae family, as well as non-fluorescent proteins from
Anthozoa. Recently, an mRNA encoding a fluorescent GFP-like protein AmphiGFP, related to GFP from
Pontellidae, has been isolated from the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae, a cephalochordate (Deheyn et al., Biol
Bull, 2007 213:95).
Results: We report that the nearly-completely sequenced genome of Branchiostoma floridae encodes at
least 12 GFP-like proteins. The evidence for expression of six of these genes can be found in the EST
databases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a gene encoding a GFP-like protein was present in the
common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria. We synthesized and expressed two of the lancelet GFP-like
proteins in mammalian cells and in bacteria. One protein, which we called LanFP1, exhibits bright green
fluorescence in both systems. The other protein, LanFP2, is identical to AmphiGFP in amino acid sequence
and is moderately fluorescent. Live imaging of the adult animals revealed bright green fluorescence at the
anterior end and in the basal region of the oral cirri, as well as weaker green signals throughout the body
of the animal. In addition, red fluorescence was observed in oral cirri, extending to the tips.
Conclusion: GFP-like proteins may have been present in the primitive Metazoa. Their evolutionary
history includes losses in several metazoan lineages and expansion in cephalochordates that resulted in the
largest repertoire of GFP-like proteins known thus far in a single organism. Lancelet expresses several of
its GFP-like proteins, which appear to have distinct spectral properties and perhaps diverse functions.

Background
Genetically encoded fluorescent probes are indispensable
tools for in vivo imaging of molecules, cells and whole
organisms. Among the fluorescent proteins that have been
developed as reporters, members of the GFP family, with
the green fluorescent protein of hydroid Aequorea victoria
as its founding member [1,2] are unique in that their
chromophore/fluorophore is formed solely from the
polypeptide chain itself, and their maturation as well as
light emission does not require any cofactors other than
oxygen. Members of the GFP family are found in many
cnidarians, where they display a range of excitation and
emission spectra, from fluorescence to bright coloration
in the visible light. GFPs proved to be extraordinarily amenable to genetic manipulation: some of the useful traits of
the engineered GFP derivatives include shifts in the
maxima of excitation and/or emission; timed responses,
such as kindling or color change after excitation; photoactivation; assembly of functional monomers from the fragments of the molecule; and others [3-5]. With all this
knowledge about structure-function relationships in the
GFP family, there is nonetheless a considerable interest in
naturally occurring GFP-like proteins with novel properties.
The evolutionary history of the GFP family and its relationship to other proteins are not well-understood. In
addition to Cnidaria, fluorescent proteins with significant
sequence similarity to GFPs have been found several years
ago in marine crustaceans of the Pontellidae family [6]. In
an unrelated work, the structure of one domain (G2)
within nidogen, a protein component of basement membranes in various groups of metazoan animals, was found
to share spatial similarity with GFP and GFP-like proteins
[7]. The common fold, described as 11-stranded β-barrel,
is so close in nidogen G2 domain and in GFPs that the
superimposition of these structures is possible with root
mean square deviation of 2.5Å between 195 carbon alpha
atoms (out of approximately 225 in GFP). The lack of discernible sequence similarity between G2 domains and
GFPs, however, leaves open the evolutionary questions,
i.e., whether the two β-barrels descend from the common
ancestral gene, and, if such common ancestor existed,
what was its function and in which organism did it reside.
In this work, we present the results of our analysis of a
family of GFP-like proteins from a cephalochordate, the
lancelet Branchiostoma floridae. The imaging of adult animals reveals anatomically discrete areas of green and red
fluorescence surrounding the oral aperture. The nearlycompletely sequenced genome of B. floridae encodes at
least 12 GFP-like proteins, which appear to have arisen by
duplication after separation of the protostome and deuterostome lineages. Several of these genes are represented
in the public EST libraries obtained from eggs and from

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/28

different stages of embryo development. To assess the utility of these genes as reporters, we expressed the humanized versions of two of these proteins in a mammalian
system.

Results and Discussion
We were interested in the evolutionary provenance of the
β-barrel proteins and searched for the homologs of various β-barrels in the EST databases. When GFP and GFPlike proteins were used as queries in the TBLASTN
searches of the non-human, non-mouse EST database at
NCBI, we detected a few trivial matches with perfect identity to several cloned GFPs, apparently originating from
the unfiltered fragments of the cloning vectors (data not
shown). To our surprise, however, the overwhelming
majority of the matches with significant sequence similarity were from the EST libraries corresponding to various
developmental stages of the lancelet B. floridae. The lancelet ESTs represented evolutionarily distinct sequences not
found in other organisms. Translations of these ESTs were
30–40% identical to copepod GFPs, their nearest database
homologs, and were more distant from the cnidarian
GFPs and GFP-like proteins. At this level of similarity,
nonetheless, the matches had high statistical significance
(E-value < 10-10), and the residues that are involved in the
chromophore formation in other GFP-like proteins
appeared to be well-conserved, suggesting that the lancelet GFP-like sequences may represent a fluorescent protein.
A more detailed analysis of the ESTs indicated that there
may be several distinct, closely related members of the
GFP family in lancelets, and searches in the DNA trace
archive of the B. floridae genome suggested that it may
encode additional homologs of GFPs not represented in
the EST databases. Most recently, we took advantage of the
DOE Joint Genome Institute release v.1.0 of the annotated genome assembly of B. floridae and collected a nonredundant set of genes encoding full-length homologs of
GFP (Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, we examined the
first release of the genome assembly of cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, the only other sequenced genome that is
known to encode GFP-like proteins.
Comparative analysis of genomes and of protein
sequences paints a picture of an ancient origin of the GFPfamily proteins and their evolution by vertical descent followed by frequent gene loss (Figure 1, Table 1, and Additional file 1). The phylogenetic tree inferred from the
aligned protein sequences indicates that all cnidarian
GFPs form one well-supported clade in the tree, all copepod GFPs form another, and the set of lancelet GFP-like
proteins forms the third clade (Additional file 1). The
branching order in the midpoint-rooted tree follows the
Metazoan phylogeny, with copepod and lancelet clades

being closest to each other. This is compatible with the
presence of an ancestral GFP in the common ancestor of
Metazoa, followed by loss of this gene in some of the
present-day species and lineage-specific expansion in the
others.
A further indication of the ancient ancestry of GFPs in
Metazoa comes from the comparison of the intron positions in cnidarian and cephalochordate genes. GFP genes
in B. floridae and N. vectensis appear to share at least one
intron in the homologous position of the codon 32 (Figure 1). The probability of independent insertion of an
intron into a homologous site within the orthologous
genes in two lineages of eukaryotes is thought to be less
than 20% [8,9] and may be less than 10% within Metazoa
[9], suggesting that the intron in this codon is much more

likely to be ancestral than convergently inserted. The position of this conserved intron close to the 5' termini of the
GFP genes is compatible with the recently documented 5'to-3' bias towards retention of ancestral introns and the
opposite bias towards intron gain and loss in multicellular organisms [10]. Moreover, another intron is present in
the start codon of almost all genes in lancelet and of two
genes in corals also supports this view, though the
sequence conservation at the beginning of the coding
region is lower and their alignment is more ambigous.
Six of the genes encoded by the genome of B. floridae are
represented in the EST libraries made from eggs, various
stages of embryo development and adult animals. We
wondered whether any of these genes may encode proteins that would confer fluorescence to the animals.

Sequence conservation in the GFP family. Multiple alignment of protein sequences of GFP-like proteins from cnidarians, copepods, and lancelet. Protein sequences of gene products predicted from the genome assembly of B. floridae were clustered at the 90% identity cutoff, and one representative per
cluster that did not contain internal deletions was included into the alignment (see Table 1 for details). Identifier of each sequence in JGI genome browser
or in GenBank is given after each sequence. The consensus secondary structure derived from multiple known three-dimensional structures of GFP-like
proteins is shown below the alignment. Red type indicates conserved small or kinky side chains (G, S, A, or P), yellow shading indicates conserved bulky
hydrophobic residues (I, L, V, M, F, Y, or W), blue type indicates conserved acidic or amidic residues (D, E, N, or Q), blue shading indicates conserved
basic residues (K or R), purple type with gray shading indicates the tripeptide directly participating in rearrangement that leads to the chromophore formation, and white type on black indicates the amino acid whose codon contains an intron in the known genome sequence.

Reports of yellow or yellow-green fluorescence in various
tissues of lancelets, most notably in fixed neural cells,
have been published in the past, but were attributed to
fluorescence of small molecules, such as retinol derivatives or monoamines [11]. To get a more up-to-date picture of fluorescence of live animals, we surveyed the
animals in captivity. Adult lancelets B. floridae gathered off
the Florida coast could be housed successfully for almost
a year in a salt-water aquarium. We observed typical burrowing behaviour: usually only the anterior end of the
animal could be seen protruding above the surface of the
substrate, but was quickly withdrawn on disturbance.
Using both widefield and confocal fluorescence microscopy, we observed green fluorescence, distributed diffusely around most of the body but most clearly
pronounced in the anterior part, in almost every animal
(Figure 2A). The fluorescent signal was concentrated in

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/28

the oral cirri [12], the semi-circle of tentacles that surrounds the buccal cavity of the animal (Figure 2A–C). The
cirri overlay a web-like sheet of integument and specialized muscles and together with oral hood they form the
pre-oral structures that feed into the long inner vestibule.
The strongest green fluorescence signal was emitted by the
linked L-shaped structures that appear to support each
tentacle (Figure 2B–C). This fluorescence pattern corresponds to the position of cirral skeletal rods [12], and it
appears that fluorescent cells are located mostly within (or
sheathed around) the horizontal part and the lower portion of the vertical part of the "L" formed by each skeletal
rod. These observations are in broad agreement with
imaging results of Deheyn and co-authors [13], except
that the bases of skeletal rods, which in their hands displayed fluorescence only in Asian species of Branchiostoma, are brightly fluorescent in B. floridae adults that we
studied.

Interestingly, we also observed clear red fluorescence signal that was similarly concentrated around oral cirri, and
strongly overlapped with the areas of green fluorescence
(Figure 2A–C and 2E). Most of the red signal was
restricted to the cirral skeletal ring and oral cirrus just
above the cirral skeletal rods, but some of it extended to
the distal tips of the oral cirri (Figure 2C). Analysis of full
spectral information at each pixel in the image indicates
that there was little pixel-to-pixel overlap between the
areas associated with the green and red fluorescence, suggesting spatial segregation of red and green emitters, perhaps even cell-specific expression of each (though higher
optical resolution than our 3 μm would be needed for a
definitive proof of this).
In order to further study the properties of lancelet GFPlike genes and to relate them to the fluorescence observed
in live animals, we have synthesized cDNAs for two of the
lancelet genes that corresponded to the largest number of
database ESTs, with codon frequencies optimized for
expression in the mammalian system, and transfected
them into HEK 293 cells (Figure 2D). Cells expressing
each construct emitted green light when excited with blue
light. LanFP1 and LanFP2 were also expressed in E. coli
and affinity-purified: both preparations exhibited maximal absorption at 500 nm, and the emission spectra of
both proteins were similar (λmax = 510 nm for LanFP1,
and 516 nm for LanFP2). Molecular brightness of the two
fluorescent proteins in transfected HEK 293 cells and in
purified samples was, however, significantly different,
with LanFP1 much brighter than LanFP2. Analyses of the
protein preparations purified from E. coli showed that the
quantum efficiency of LanFP1 was by the two orders of
magnitude higher than that of LanFP2, and about half of
the brightness of the potent Venus derivative of YFP
(Additional file 2).
We exploited the fact that LanFP1 and LanFP2 have
slightly different excitation and emission spectra and
compared them with endogenous fluorescent signals
from the cirri. The emission spectrum from B. floridae has
a maximum at 521 nm, which is much closer to that of
LanFP2-expressing HEK-293 cells and of affinity-purified
LanFP2 than to the corresponding values of LanFP1 (Figure 2F).
Analysis of the EST libraries indicates that transcripts
encoding both LanFP1 and LanFP2 are abundant in eggs
and embryos, though thus far no matching ESTs have
been found in the libraries from adult animals. We did
not detect any fluorescent signals in the red spectrum in
mammalian cells singly or doubly transfected with
LanFP1 or LanFP2.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/28

Days before the submission of this manuscript, 21 cDNA
sequences encoding proteins of GFP family from a European species B. lanceolatum were released by Genbank.
They apparently include naturally occurring and engineered cDNAs, most of which display either green or red
fluorescence [14]. There is no one-to-one correspondence
between these sequences and the products of GFP-like
genes encoded by B. floridae genome.

Conclusion
In this work, we identified a family of genes encoding
GFP-like proteins in lancelet B. floridae and expressed two
of them in bacterial and mammalian cell cultures. Both
proteins, LanFP1 and LanFP2, exhibit green fluorescence
of different brightness and distinct spectral properties
when expressed in mammalian cells, and they, along with
at least four other GFP-like proteins, appear to be
expressed at various stages of lancelet development as
judged from the analysis of the EST libraries. Moreover,
adult lancelets display overlapping but distinct patterns of
green and red fluorescence, with green fluorescence
shifted towards more basal regions of oral cirri and red
fluorescence more prominent at the cirri tips.
Recently, Deheyn and co-authors reported the sequence
of LanFP2 and the pattern of green fluorescence in lancelet eggs, larvae and adults [1], and Israelsson [14] reported
a similarly diverse family of cDNAs expressing red and
green fluorescent proteins in B. lanceolatus. It remains to
be investigated which of the GFP-like proteins encoded by
the Florida lancelet genome are responsible for fluorescence observed by these authors and by us. Intriguingly,
LanFP1 appears to be a bright GFP, whereas LanFP2 fluoresces only dimly in vitro and in heterologous expression
systems. At the same time, its emission spectrum is the
closest match to the emission of the bright fluorescence
observed in live adult animals. Gene-specific probes now
available for individual LanFPs will help to establish the
identity of green and red emitters at the various stages of
lancelet development.
Phylogenetic inference and analysis of conserved intron
positions allow us to tentatively place a GFP-like protein
into the common ancestor of metazoan animals. The relationship between GFPs and structurally similar G2
domains, however, remains unclear. The similarity
between the spatial structures of representative of the two
families makes them amenable to structure-based superimposition, and phylogenetic trees based on such alignments have been presented [13]. These trees, however, do
not prove the fact of sequence homology in the first place.
Using HHpred, which is one of the most sensitive
sequence comparison programs and does not rely explicitly on spatial information [15] and the sequence model
of G2 domain family derived from pfam07474, we

Biology Direct 2008, 3:28

observed several matches to cnidarian fluorescent proteins, with the borderline HHpred P-values from 0.0017
to 0.05. If this borderline sequence similarity, with additional consideration of the same number of β-strands in
two families, is taken as the indication of their common
ancestry, then the origin of nidogen G2 domain appears
to postdate the emergence of GFPs, as G2 domain
homologs are detected in nematodes and insects but do
not appear in primitive metazoans, such as nearly-completely sequenced cnidarian N. vectensis and extensively
covered flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. G2 domains are
also more diverse in sequence than the GFP-like proteins.
If the former have evolved from the latter, the constraints
on the sequence of a GFP-like protein, which has to enable the maturation of a chromophore or a fluorophore,
have apparently been lifted in the G2 domains, which
became coopted into a mutidomain polypeptide that
mediates protein-protein interactions in the basal membrane of metazoa. Alternatively, GFP and G2 families may
share a common β-barrel ancestor and may have other,
still unrecognized relatives in present-day organisms.
Biological functions of GFPs remain elusive. It has been
speculated that GFPs in cnidaria may be involved in
quenching the UV irradiation [16] and/or in camouflaging coloration against predators [17]. Both hypotheses are
compatible with the fact the zone of the brightest fluorescence in lancelets corresponds to the anterior part of the
adult animal that is exposed during feeding. On the other
hand, lancelets feed on plankton organisms, which display phototaxis, and it is possible that the signal emitted
by these proteins serves as bait. On a more practical note,
the study of lancelet ESTs and live imaging of animals
expands the repertoire of GFP-like proteins, potential sensors and reporters for biological experimentation.

Methods
Animal husbandry
Adult lancelets (B. floridae) were collected by Marine Biological Supply (Panacea, Florida) at a depth of 10–12 ft at
the GPS coordinates N29 degrees, 55.454'/W084 degrees,
15.676' (Apalachee Bay, Wakulla County, FL). They were
housed in glass aquariums at pH 8.2–8.4, salinity 33–34
ppt, water temperature 18–19°C, negligible levels of
ammonia, nitrite and nitrate, copper and phosphate, on a
substrate of either washed, screened play sand or glass
beads. A 10% water change was performed once a week. A
mix of liquid planktonic foods available commercially for
filter feeders was fed daily via a dosing pump. Animals
were housed in a room with a lighting level of 30 ft. candles and a 12:12 photoperiod.
Microscopy
Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal
head mounted on a Zeiss axiovert 200 m microscope with

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/28

AIM acquisition software (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, USA),
coupled to a Chameleon Ultra II IR laser source (Coherent, San Jose) for two photon excitation. Spectral information was acquired using the Meta channel on the Zeiss
LSM-510 set to 10 nm resolution with 488 nm excitation.
Single channel green image were collected using a confocal microscope equipped with a laser with 488 excitation
filter and a 500 to 530 band pass emission filter. Images
were acquired with a water immersion objective, 20 × 0.8
NA c-apochromat for the whole animals or 40 × 1.2 NA capochromat for cell cultures. For live imaging experiments, animals were mounted in a 25 by 60 mm Nunc
chamber with a number 1.5 coverslip. To minimize animal movement, lancelets were anesthetized with buffered
MS-222 solution (Tricaine Methanesulfonate) at a concentration of 350 mg/L.
Spectroscopy
Absorption spectra for purified proteins were obtained
using a SOFTmax UV/VIS spectrometer (Molecular
Devices). Emission spectra were obtained using a Horiba/
Jovan fluoromax fluorescence spectrometer. Emission
scans were recorded by exciting the sample at lmax for
absorption with 5 nm slit. Molecular absorptivity and
quantum yield were measured as in [18] and [19]. The
protein concentration for absorbivity measurements was
determined by BCA assay and by fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy [20].
Bioinformatics
Sequence similarity searches were performed using the
gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST family of programs [21].
Multiple sequence alignments were done using the MUSCLE program [22]. The JTT distance matrix of protein
sequences was constructed using the PROTDIST program
and the neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using the NEIGHBOR program of the Phylip
package [23]. The statistical support of the nodes was
assessed by making 100 bootstrap replicates of the aligned
sequences, building 100 trees, making the consensus tree,
and marking all nodes in the original tree that were supported by more than 50% of the bootstrapped replicates.
HMM-to-HMM matching was done using the HHpred
server [15].
Cloning and expression of LanFP1 and LanFP2
LanFP1 and LanFP2 coding sequences have been initially
assembled from the B. floridana EST libraries as two of the
proteins supported by the largest number of EST. Prior to
the release of the lancelet genome assembly, there were six
nucleotide positions in the LanFP1 coding sequence
showing variations between the ESTs in the database, and
we used the most frequently conserved nucleotide for
these positions. The sequences were subsequently verified
by comparing them to the genome assembly. To optimize

the codons for expressing in mouse and other mammalian systems, we reverse translated the LanFP1 and LanFP2
into DNA using a standard mouse codon set. For ease of
cloning, we included HindIII and BamHI restriction sites
at 5' and 3' ends of both sequences. The gene was synthesized by Bioclone, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The synthesized
gene was cloned into Sigma's p3XFlag-Myc-CMV plasmid
HindIII and BamHI sites, which contained a 5' Flag and a
3' Myc tags plus a stop codon on the vector backbone. The
sequence for optimized sequences can be found in Additional File 3.
Cell Culture and Transfection
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured
in the minimum essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2
mM glutamine and were maintained at 37°C in a humidified environment of 5% CO2. The cells were plated on 25
mm round coverslips coated with poly-D Lysine (Sigma)
24 to 48 hours and transfected with DNA plasmids when
cells reached 70–80% confluence. Plasmid DNA used for
transfection was obtained using the HiSpeed maxi-prep
kit (Qiagen) and repurified by sodium acetate and ethanol precipitation. 2 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with
12 μg of Nupherin (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) in 300 μl of MEM containing no FBS
or antibiotics for 15 min and then combined with 300 μl
of MEM containing 6 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for another 15 min at room temperature. The culture
medium was replaced with 600 μl of transfection medium
containing the LipofectAMINE-Nupherin-DNA complex.
After incubating for 0.5 to 1 hour, the transfection
medium was replaced with 2 ml of culture medium. Cell
imaging occurred 24–72 hours post transfection.
Protein purification
BL-21 Ecoli cells were transformed with LanFP1 or LanFP2
subcloned into pRSET-B bacteria expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in frame with 6 histidine tags. Overnight cultures were grown to OD 0.4 prior to induction.
Bacterial cultures were induced by the addition 1 mM
IPTG, grown to OD 0.8, lysed and the His-tagged protein
was extracted using a Ni-agarose beads solution (Qiagen
cat no. 30210). Concentration of purified protein was
established using a BCA assay (Pierce, cat no 23225) and
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer 1: S. Sunyaev
This manuscript describes a discovery of a family of GFPlike proteins in the newly sequenced genome of a lancelet
B. floridae. The authors expressed two proteins and
detected fluorescent signals of different brightness and
wavelengths. Phylogenetic analysis that included the analysis of intron position conservation suggested an early
metazoan origin of GFPs followed by a massive parallel
loss in multiple lineages. The manuscript also discusses
the potential evolutionary relationship between structurally similar G2 domains and GFPs.
Reviewer 2: M. Matz (nominated by I. King Jordan)
Unfortunately, the novelty edge has been taken away from
this work by the prior note by Deheyn et al. of green fluorescent proteins in three species of lancelets (Biol. Bull.
213: 95–100, 2007). Deheyn et al already discussed the
phylogenetic relationships of one of the lancelet GFPs,
including its relationships with G2 domain proteins, and
described in vivo fluorescence of lancelets. Still, this paper
contains substantially more material than the short note
by Deheyn et al. First, the whole family of GFP-like proteins in one genome was surveyed. Second, two of the 12
detected genes have been heterologously expressed and
spectroscopically characterized. Third, and this is the most
intriguing information for me, red fluorescence has been
observed in the lancelet. All these are valuable contributions to our knowledge of diversity and evolution of GFPlike proteins.

I regret, however, that the authors did not go as far as to
express and characterize all 12 family members found in
the lancelet genome. This would have been a logically
complete study, and the first one to describe the full complement of GFP-like proteins from an organism.
Authors' response: We are doing it now with all B. floridae family members and, for good measure, with the
homologs from sea anemone Nematostella vectensis
that have been revealed in the genome project but, as
far as we know, were not characterized before.

GFP: Green fluorescent protein.

Competing interests
The authors have a financial interest in patent applications which cover some of the work described in the
paper.

In addition to possible identification of the red fluorescent protein, such study might have turned up interesting
patterns related to evolution and/or deterioration of gene
functions in multigene families. In this regard, it is really
intriguing that the two characterized proteins differ so
much in their spectral properties. Whereas LanFP1 is a

Biology Direct 2008, 3:28

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/28

rather generic GFP, LanFP2 is dimmer because of its low
quantum yield but instead possesses impressively high
molar extinction coefficient, on par with anthozoan purple-blue chromoproteins that are known for their striking
color appearance. I would mention in the discussion that
this difference in spectral properties may be the result of
functional sub-specialization that maintained both genes
in the lancelet genome after duplication. Also, given its
very high molar extinction, I would expect that LanGFP2
protein should look quite colorful (not necessarily
green!) in solution. Is that so?

2. What were the excitation wavelengths for "green" and
"red spectra", Fig. 2E?

Authors' response: Yes! LanFP2 solution is yellowbrown.

3. The "red spectra" does not look like any of the GFP-like
proteins known thus far. What can you say about it?

I am rather surprised that the authors doubt the homology of G2 domains and GFPs. In addition to the fold similarity and same collection of the secondary structure
elements, these proteins also have the elements in identical (and far from trivial) order within their primary structure. Importantly, this order does not have to be
conserved for the protein to work, as has been demonstrated by successful circular permutation of several GFPlike proteins. I believe therefore that in this case, complete
identity of the fold including the composition and order
of secondary structure elements constitutes a far stronger
evidence of homology than any structure-oblivious algorithm may provide.

Authors' response: The spectrum does not provide any
information about the potential source of the red fluorescence, i.e., even whether it is a protein or a small
molecule. Note, however, the claims in a very recent
patent (ref. 14) about proteins from a related species
of Branchiostoma.

Authors' response: Unfortunately, there is no accepted
quantitative model of structural similarity that can be
used for testing evolutionary hypotheses in the
absence of sequence signal – similar number and similar topology of strands is certainly something worth
knowing about, but this qualitative argument cannot
(yet) be translated in a hard number, the way the
"structure-oblivious" sequence similarities can be. On
the other hand, we have nothing against the suggestion that nidogen G2 domain and GFP share a common ancestor. In fact, the relevant paragraph in the
Conclusions section includes evolutionary scenarios
that presume the existence of just such an ancestor, on
the basis of exactly the evidence that the Reviewer
highlights. Note also related comments by L. Aravind.
I also have a few minor questions, listed below.
1. How was the fluorescence measured in live animals?
Authors' response: The fluorescence was measured using
a LSM-510 confocal microscope. The animals were
immobilized with a muscle inhibitor and images collected using 488 nm laser excitation and spectral imaging with either a 20× or 40× objective (see Methods for
more detail).

Authors' response: The excitation wavelength was 488
nm with an argon laser for both green and red spectra.
The red spectrum can also be excited with a 561 nm
laser. The two-photon excitation scan indicates the
green fluorescence is produced when excited with 720
to 1020 nm light. The red fluorescence was not apparent until using two-photon excitation above 980 nm
light.

4. I can't help noticing that the "green spectra" are different in Fig. 2E and 2F, although they are supposed to be the
same. Why?
Authors' response: They are identical. We hope that
reformatted figure makes this clearer.
5. I'd like to see excitation spectra for the expressed proteins (augment Fig. 2F).
Authors' response: These data are presented in the added
Supplementary Figure S4 (Additional File 4). They
were collected using fluorescence spectrometer with 1
nm resolution (i.e., higher than the 10 nm-resolved
spectra obtained on LSM-510).
6. Does lancelet genome contain G2 domains? If not,
please discuss that, if yes, please put them into the phylogeny.
Authors' response: Yes, it does. These sequences are solidly within the chordate clade, not interminglingmingling with deeper-branching invertebrate homologs in
the same tree. Thus, this domain is clearly distinct
from GFP domain, and adding G2 sequences to the
tree would not help to better illustrate or to refute any
point that we are trying to make in this article: in order
to include a sequence into the alignment that is used
for evolutionary inference, homology needs to be
proven already (see response on the monophyly question above and also to L. Aravind comment below).

7. Please make the phylogenetic tree one of main figures.
I would also appreciate if the tree was reformatted into a
more conventional form.
Authors' response: We feel that the tree is too trivial to
add much to discussion (in fact, except for the addition of more Branchiostoma and Nematostella
sequences, it is nearly identical to the tree shown in
ref. 1), but we now provide, as Additional File 5, two
trees in Newick format: 1. the main neighbour-joining
tree, which contains branch length information, and
2. the consensus of 100 neighbour-joining trees built
on the basis of the bootstrap replicates of the first tree,
which contains the information on the bootstrap support for each partition in the first tree.
8. The role of fluorescence in attracting food is an interesting proposition, but why it is important particularly during twilight? I don't see the connection.
Authors' response: Phytoplankton and zooplankton
exhibit phototaxis, and different parts of spectra may
be most effective at different times of day and at different depths in attracting food from the surface. We
agree that there is no particular evidence that would
compel one to focus on twilight, so we deleted "during
twilight".
Reviewer 3: L. Aravind
The paper by Baumann et al describes the recovery of several new GFP related proteins in amphioxus (B. floridae)
and experimental characterization of a few of them. The
point of note is the proposal that that GFP was present in
the common ancestor of Bilateralia and Cnidaria and
repeatedly lost in various animal lineages. Despite the
extremely sporadic distribution of these proteins, the phylogenetic analysis and the argument of conserved intron
positions support this scenario. Yet, it might be useful to
check environmental metagenomic sequences to address
the possibility of independent lateral transfer from some
unknown source into the few animal lineages in which
GFPs are found.

Authors' response: We searched metagenomic
sequences, but found only the garden-variety GFPs
closely identical to the founder from A. victoria, only in
marine samples and represented by small number of
collapsed reads. We think they are encoded by hydroid
DNA present in some of these samples.
Even more striking is the proposal that the nidogen G2
domains have emerged from the GFP like family after the
divergence of cnidarians and possibly flatworms from the
remaining metazoans. This proposal is weakly supported.
Given that fact that sequence similarity between the G2

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/28

domain and GFP is only detected using the most sensitive
profile-profile comparison method, it is entirely possible
that there remain undetected β-barrel proteins with comparable topologies and geometry that are the precursors of
both GFP and G2 domains. While this may sound less
parsimonious, the high levels of sequence divergence
observed in various β barrel folds (especially when there
no comparable functional constraints) do make it a distinctive possibility.
Authors' response: We agree that this is a possibility
worth discussing, and we amended the text accordingly. Note, however, that we have not seen any G2
domains in complete proteome of sea anemone
Nematostella or in the available sequences of planarian
Schmidtea or any other primitive metazoan clade.
Thus, if the common 11-stranded barrel ancestor of
G2 domain and of the present-day GFPs was not itself
part of the GFP family, it either had to spawn GFP and
G2 domains on separate occasions, or to split into
GFP and G2 followed by at least one, or possibly many
losses, of G2 (in Anthozoa and perhaps in
Plathelminthes). Better sequence sampling of sponges,
coelenterates and flatworms would help to sort out
these possibilities.
Minor points: -Pg 10 "At this level of significance, GFPs
did not stand out from the background of other β-barrel
proteins." What were the other β barrel proteins detected
by HHpred and their p-values? Was a reciprocal search
done using the GFP profiles as queries against a profile
database lacking GFPs?
Authors' response: This paragraph was a bit too convoluted in the initial version. Current HHPred server
(release 2.2.1) does not report GFP-G2 similarity if the
complete database is used as the search space. The
same negative results are obtained with the standalone version 1.5.0 whether or not the selfsame models are removed from the database. The matches
between G2 and GFP can be only observed when we
search the subset of HMMs built upon proteins with
the known three-dimensional structures. In that case,
the G2 model finds the best GFP model with p-value
0.0017, and other GFP-related models have p-values
from 0.002 to 0.005. An apparently unrelated β-barrel
family, specified by At1g79260 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, is seen with p-value 0.039, though the
alignment is only partial and reciprocal search does
not detect the G2 domain. G2 model also finds bacterial semi-barrel LolB in searches against the complete
database (p-value 0.022: interestingly, LolB also has
11 strands). GFP does not detect G2 even under these
forced conditions. All these weak similarities, however, only reinforce our main argument, i.e., that we

still do not have a robust statistical validation of the
GFP-G2 monophyly at the sequence level. Thus, interested as we are in discussing scenarios that assume a
common ancestor, we can do it only hypothetically.
We have modified the Conclusions section with this in
mind.
What is the evidence that the red fluorescence comes from
a GFP like protein and not some other fluorochrome?
Authors' response: This question was also raised by M.
Matz, see our response (the short answer is: no evidence, but see ref. 14).
