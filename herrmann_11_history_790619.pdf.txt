History and phylogeny of intermediate filaments:
Now in insects
Harald Herrmann*1 and Sergei V Strelkov2

Abstract
Intermediate filaments include the nuclear lamins,
which are universal in metazoans, and the cytoplasmic
intermediate filaments, which are much more varied
and form cell type-specific networks in animal cells.
Until now, it has been thought that insects harbor
lamins only. This view is fundamentally challenged
by the discovery, reported in BMC Biology, of an
intermediate filament-like cytoplasmic protein,
isomin, in the hexapod Isotomurus maculatus. Here we
briefly review the history of research on intermediate
filaments, and discuss the implications of this latest
finding in the context of what is known of their
structure and functions.

From hair to nuclear organization
Biological specimens enriched in intermediate filament
(IF) proteins were among the first to be placed into an xray beam for structural analysis, back in the 1930s by
William Astbury. He used hair, in its non-stretched and
stretched form, rightly deducing that such extended,
stable and flexible rods are made from highly ordered
proteins. However, it took the thesis work of a graduate
student several years later to explain fully these first,
surprisingly simple diffraction patterns. The student was
Francis Crick. He realized that the keratin α-helices in
hair are packed as “simple coiled coils”, remarking later, in
his 1988 autobiography, that at that time “helices were in
the air”. This excitement was partly due to the discovery
of the α-helical fold by Linus Pauling and his group as a
fundamental structural principle embodied in the muscle
proteins myosin and tropomyosin; and in the years that

followed, more α-helix-rich proteins were discovered and
grouped together as fibrous proteins. Years later the
excitement of biochemists was gone. The second edition
of classical textbook Biological Chemistry by Mahler and
Cordes (1971) lists them simply under scleroproteins to­
gether with collagen and gelatin, without further mention.
This scenario changed when in 1968 the group of
Howard Holtzer discovered IFs as a further independent
filament system in cells obtained from chicken muscle in
addition to the well established actin and myosin filaments,
highly abundant in myocytes. By conventional electron
microscopy, the diameter of these new filaments was
determined to be intermediate between that of actin and
myosin filaments, hence intermediate filaments or 10-nm
filaments (see [1]). Within the next 10 years these new
filaments were found in all vertebrate tissues and cultured
cell lines investigated, and in many other animals too; and
subsequently, the massive DNA sequen­ ing efforts of the
c
1980s produced two major insights into this protein class.
First, IF proteins from various tissues all exhibit a conserved
central α-helical rod domain, organized so that two chains
can form a parallel in-register coiled coil (Figure 1; [1]), and
which is flanked by non-α-helical domains of very different
character and size. Second, they are only found in metazoan
species and appear to be absent from plants and fungi.
It came as a great surprise when the cell nucleus was
found to contain fibrillar substructures - the nuclear
lamina - composed of specialized IF proteins, the lamins.
As so often in science, these entities, discovered last,
turned out to be the evolutionary ancestors of the whole
intermediate filament multigene family. Simple meta­ oans
z
such as Hydra attenuata were found to express at least
nuclear IF proteins, and a comparative analysis of their
lamin sequences and the other known lamin and IF protein
sequences led to the conclusion that IFs originated in an
ur-lamin [2]. The simple invertebrate Caenorhabditis
elegans, which has a single nuclear lamin, also harbors
eleven genes coding for cytoplasmic IF proteins, four of
which have been demonstrated to be essential for
viability [3]; but the fruit fly Drosophila melano­ aster,

Figure 1. All intermediate filaments have essential structural features in common. A schematic molecular model of a coiled-coil dimer is
shown for human lamin A (upper part) and human keratins 5 and 14, which heterodimerize to assemble into the keratin filament (lower part). The

lamin B - characteristic of mammalian species, does not
exhibit any cytoplasmic IF protein. This led to the
conclusion that insects lack cytoplasmic IFs - a
conclusion that is now challenged by Mencarelli et al. [4],
who detected abundant cytoplasmic structures in the
mid-gut cells of the hexapod Isotomurus maculatus
(commonly known as the springtail), and have isolated
the protein, cloned the DNA from the deduced sequence,
com­ ared the sequence with those of known IFs,
p
reassembled filaments from the expressed protein in
vitro, and conclude that the protein, which they call
isomin, is an intermediate filament protein.
Before discussing the implications of this discovery, we
need to ask what are the defining features of an inter­
mediate filament protein, and how does isomin fit the
definition?
All intermediate filament proteins are coiled-coil
proteins, but not all coiled-coil proteins are intermediate
filament proteins. The conclusion that IF proteins are
absent from plants and fungi for example rests on the
basis of the fully sequenced genomes of the thale cress
(Arabidopsis thaliana) and of bakers’ yeast (Saccharo­
myces cerevisiae); but coiled coil proteins are quite
abundant in these organisms, in myosins, kinesins and
tropomyosins as well as in transcription factors and in
the structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins
(SMCs), which contain extended coiled coils and are
found in all cells. Even bacterial cells are assumed to
contain some extended coiled-coil proteins [5], and
notably, a bacterial protein essential for the organization
of cell curvature, crescentin, has been described to

exhibit many features that are found in IF proteins, and
hence has been termed IF-like [6]. So how are coiled-coil
proteins recognized, and how are IF proteins distinct?

What makes a bona fide intermediate filament?
Coiled-coil forming parts within protein sequences can
be identified relatively easily by looking for heptad
repeats - amino-acid sequence motifs that, first, allow the
formation of an α-helix and second, have apolar residues
periodically at positions a and d within the seven aminoacid repeat (abcdefg)n. It is the long-range regular disposi­
tion of hydrophobic residues that forces two α-helices
into a superhelix, that is, a coiled-coil dimer, and their
hydrophobic character also determines the strength of
the interaction of the α-helices within the coiled coil [7].
Charged amino acids within the coiled coil serve as
‘trigger motifs’, essential for dimerization [1].
What then distinguishes intermediate filament proteins
from other coiled-coil forming proteins? Although many
proteins follow a common fold without pronounced
similarity in primary amino acid sequence, there are
conserved “consensus sequences” about 20 amino acids
long in IF proteins, and the organization of the central αhelical rod domain is followed quite strictly in IF proteins:
the individual segments of coiled-coiled forming parts
are separated by short variable linker motifs and exhibit a
conserved number of amino acids (coil 1A: 35; coil 1B:
101; coil 2: 142; see Figure 1). A notable peculiarity of
nuclear IF proteins is that they have six heptads, or 42
amino acids, more in coil 1B than vertebrate cytoplasmic
IF proteins. Notably, invertebrate cytoplasmic proteins

still have the long coil 1B, except for some tunicates - that
is, chordates that are however still invertebrates. All these
proteins have a very similar organization of coil 2, which
carries in the middle region a so-called stutter region, an
irregularity in the heptad pattern, at the very same
position relative to IF consensus motif 2.
As mentioned above, up to now it has been thought,
because of the absence of cytoplasmic IF proteins from
Drosophila melanogaster, that insects do not have cyto­
plasmic intermediate filaments. This notion has now
been challenged by the discovery of a protein in the hexa­
pod Isotomurus maculatus, that resembles cyto­ lasmic
p
IF proteins from other invertebrates quite distinctly [4].
When the primary sequence of isomin is aligned to a
Drosophila lamin Dm0 (the B-type lamin), coil 1B and coil
2 match quite well in length (Figure 2). For coil 1A the
number of amino acids qualifying for an α-helical fold is
somewhat lower than the conventional 35 amino acids of
coil 1A in standard IF proteins (note there are minor
differences in our estimate of the length and location of
these subdomains and those of Mencarelli et al. [4];
Figure 2b). Nevertheless, isomin coil 1A harbors a major
part of the conserved IF consensus amino acid motif 1 (IF
consensus motif 1, see [8]). The central part of this motif
is LNDRLATY in the fly lamin and LNVRLADV in
isomin (common amino acids are in bold), and also the
six preceding amino acids are highly homologous,
indicating that they may take part in similar molecular
interactions. The second consensus motif, IF consensus

motif 2, is also significantly similar: AYDKLLVGEEAR in
the fly lamin and KYDSLVKVEEVR in isomin. How far
this sequence has drifted from the standard IF consensus
motif 2 sequence, both in isomin and in lamin Dm0,
becomes clear when one compares this sequence with
those present in lamins from lower invertebrates, which
are nearly identical to human lamin A [1, 2]. Nevertheless,
this sequence homology points to a consensus that may
be functionally important (see below).
What may be the function of these motifs and why are
they found in all IF proteins? We have recently proposed
that both consensus domains are essential for IF protein
assembly: specifically, that the longitudinal head-to-tail
association of two dimers, leading to a structural overlap
of about 3 nm, is mediated by the formation of two
‘hetero-coiled coils’ in the overlap zone (Figure 3; [8]).
Such an interaction is consistent with the primary
sequences observed in isomin. However, this assumes
that isomin is a homopolymeric IF protein, and on the
basis of the present data in Mencarelli and colleagues,
other possibilities cannot be ruled out.
For example, extended keratin filaments form from
obligate heterodimeric assembly pairs, yet keratin homo­
polymers may nonetheless form short fibrils (though not
full-length ones) in vitro. Invertebrate cytoplasmic IF
proteins often come in pairs too. Most notably, the
mammalian IF multigene family harbors several mem­
bers that are not able to assemble into bona fide IFs on
their own, but require a ‘co-assembler’ partner. Nestin,

dimers (adapted from [8]). This overlap engages both IF consensus motif 1 and IF consensus motif 2 from two dimeric chains as concluded from
chemical crosslinking data and measurements of lamin head-to-tail dimer chains and paracrystals (for details see [1; 10]).

synemin, syncoilin and individual type I and type II
keratins are a few examples. Finally, the in vitro assem­
bled filaments of isomin resemble only to some extent
typical cytoplasmic IFs, especially when compared with
those generated from Ascaris suum [9], although this
may be attributable to different assembly conditions.
Never­ heless, the tissue localisation of isomin and its
t
resistance against extraction with high salt/non-ionic
detergent-containing buffers, as well as its structural
organization, all argue for its being a cytoplasmic IF-like
protein.

And their function is …?
In the gold-rush era of IFs, Elias Lazarides suggested in a
highly cited Nature review that IFs serve as “mechanical
integrators of cellular space”. Soon after, they were argued
to be the cellular “absorbers of mechanical stress”, when it
was found that mutations in epidermal keratins would
lead to severe skin blistering diseases (for review see [1]).
On this basis, the absence of cytoplasmic IFs from insects
was plausibly explained by the presence of an exoskeleton
able to protect their cells from mechanical stress. How­ ver
e
it seems equally likely that insect cells do need proteins
performing IF-like functions, and that these may, at least
in some insects, be subsumed by other proteins.
For example, it has been shown that muscle cells
depend on IFs for proper function: the absence of the
muscle-specific desmin filaments in knockout mice is
lethal if the mice are subjected to severe exercise stress,
and desmin is thus likely to be essential for survival
outside of the laboratory. Similarly, Caenorhabditis
elegans needs its muscle IF protein to survive [3]. In this
case, the essential property of IFs is probably elasticity they can bear an impressive load before they break, and
therefore are good candidates for contributing to the

elas­ icity of cells. This property has been demonstrated
t
with whole cells as well as at the individual filament level
(for review see [10]). Some protein with this property is
likely to be required by insects.
Conversely, there are several IF proteins whose func­
tions in vivo are not yet clear but may be quite diverse.
Nestin, for example, which is used simply as a stem cell
marker by most life scientists, is not able to form IFs on
its own and poisons the assembly of vimentin, the hall­
mark IF protein of mesenchymal cells when present even
in the low percent range. It has a very long tail of about
1300 amino acids with many potential interaction sites,
and the sequences of this tail domain are quite different
between close relatives such as man and rat, where in
contrast the rod domains are more than 90% sequence
identical. Hence, nestin has evolved away from the
standard IF protein quite extensively, suggesting that IF
proteins are easily, and in mammals frequently, adapted
for new functions thereby losing their ‘standard’ molecu­
lar organization.

So what about isomin?
We would suggest that isomin may have a distinct tissuespecific role in Isotomurus that is not necessarily restricted
to generating structural order and support. For this reason,
its sequence may have drifted away from the standard IF
pattern, especially if isomin is in fact a ‘co-assembler’
analogous to other IF proteins such as synemin, nestin or
the high molecular weight neurofilament triplet protein,
with a hitherto unrecognized partner. It seems possible
from this case that Isotomurus may harbor more IF
proteins, unrecognized until now, and isomin may herald
the discovery of much greater IF complexity in hexapoda.
Model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster may
well not represent their whole phylum, and many

different types of sub-cellular organization may have
occurred in evolution using different proteins. This is of
course particularly credible for a class of proteins that is
characteristically expressed in a tissue-specific manner. A
human neuronal IF protein is entirely different by sequence
from an epidermal keratin, except for the existence of both
IF consensus motifs and the structural organization of their
α-helical segments. And indeed, the number of amino acids
per α-helical segment seems not to be sacrosanct: In the
Caenorhabditis elegans lamin, but not in that of other
invertebrates, two heptads are missing in coil 2B. Hence, there
is room for sequence variation and domain alterations to
explore new tissue-specific functions in the course of
evolution. This rather radical degree of structural flexibility is
obviously a driving force in the evolution of specific tissue
functions.
