DNA repair and recombination in higher plants:
insights from comparative genomics of
arabidopsis and rice
Sanjay K Singh1, Sujit Roy2, Swarup Roy Choudhury1, Dibyendu N Sengupta1*

Abstract
Background: The DNA repair and recombination (DRR) proteins protect organisms against genetic damage,
caused by environmental agents and other genotoxic agents, by removal of DNA lesions or helping to abide them.
Results: We identified genes potentially involved in DRR mechanisms in Arabidopsis and rice using similarity
searches and conserved domain analysis against proteins known to be involved in DRR in human, yeast and E. coli.
As expected, many of DRR genes are very similar to those found in other eukaryotes. Beside these eukaryotes
specific genes, several prokaryotes specific genes were also found to be well conserved in plants. In Arabidopsis,
several functionally important DRR gene duplications are present, which do not occur in rice. Among DRR proteins,
we found that proteins belonging to the nucleotide excision repair pathway were relatively more conserved than
proteins needed for the other DRR pathways. Sub-cellular localization studies of DRR gene suggests that these
proteins are mostly reside in nucleus while gene drain in between nucleus and cell organelles were also found in
some cases.
Conclusions: The similarities and dissimilarities in between plants and other organisms’ DRR pathways are
discussed. The observed differences broaden our knowledge about DRR in the plants world, and raises the
potential question of whether differentiated functions have evolved in some cases. These results, altogether,
provide a useful framework for further experimental studies in these organisms.

Background
The integrity of genomes of all living organisms is continuously being challenged by different environmental
agents and metabolic by-products. Consequently, evolution has provided organisms with several DNA repair
and recombination (DRR) pathways to remove or to tolerate lesions in their genetic material and maintain the
integrity of genome. Thus DRR is not only a fundamental cellular process for protecting cells against the
damage, but is also indispensable to ensure faithful
transmission of genetic information from one generation
to the next. In fact, these partly redundant machineries
have at least two important contrasting roles in evolution, escorting the genome, and allowing for a certain
level of mutations during evolution. The decisive balance of these two activities is perhaps the best reason

for the high levels of conservation observed in DRR
related proteins, even across the three domains, Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukarya [1-3].
The effect of environmental change on ecosystem
scales responses and on the life processes of individual
organisms has been a major environmental issue for the
last three decades. Understanding of how species may
evolve in response to environmental changes remains
relatively unclear, particularly for plants. Plants, because
of their intrinsic immobility, are constantly exposed to
various environmental agents and endogenous processes
that impose damage to DNA and cause genotoxic stress,
which can reduce plant genome stability, growth and
productivity. Like any other organisms plants employ a
wide variety of strategies to either reverse, excise, or tolerate the presence of DNA damage products. Although
repair and damage tolerance mechanisms have been
thoroughly described in E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rodents and human, surprisingly little is known

about these processes in plants. However, in recent
years, there has been increased interest in plant DRR
and in using plants as models for understanding the
under lying mechanism of DRR [4].
Our research interest lies mainly with understanding
the coordination between replication and repair machinery in higher plant genome with special emphasis on the
role of single subunit, short gap- filling family-X DNA
polymerase orthologues in plant DNA replication and
repair (DNA polymerase l) [5-9]. Previously few
attempts have been made to study the different repair
pathway in plants at genome level but they were limited
to either gene identification or single pathway only
[10,11]. Recent study has reported in detail about the
core DNA replication machinery in rice and Arabidopsis
[12]. Previously, we carried out an in silico analysis to
study the sequential, structural and phylogenetic features of BRCT (breast cancer susceptibility C-terminus)
domain in higher plant genome and investigated the distribution of this module in various proteins in higher
plants in relation to the functional significance of these
proteins in plant DNA damage and repair [13]. However
detailed knowledge about the sequential, structural and
evolutionary properties of the genes involved in plant
DRR events is still very limited.
In this article, we have made an attempt to systemically analyze the genomes of the two fully sequenced
and well explored plants, Arabidopsis (a dicot) and rice
(a monocot), to investigate the presence and evolution
of genes known to be involved in DRR in other organisms. We have found that some repair machinery is very
well conserved in plant genomes whereas others have
diverged more rapidly. In addition, several genes
involved in different repair pathways are found to be
duplicated in both the genomes. To further gain insight
into plant DRR components, we have combined published experimental information with our own bioinformatics analysis of genomic sequence data. We observed
that the genes involved in DRR are, in general, part of
the cell core metabolic pathways and showed significant
similarity in different genomes while intriguing differences indicating biological diversity in plant responses
to DNA damage. Overall this in silico study provides
important information regarding DRR pathways in
plants and represents a useful starting place for further
research on the functional characterization of the proteins involved in plant DNA metabolism and the evolution of DRR genes in higher plant genomes.

Results and discussion
Identification of DRR genes in rice and Arabidopsis

In order to study the conservation and evolution of DRR
pathways in rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genomes, we examined the conservation

of 229 and 223 gene models in Arabidopsis and rice
respectively. Detail about every gene and number of paralogs present in Arabidopsis and rice genomes are tabulated
in additional file 1 while the locus IDs and relevant plant
literature (if available) is listed in additional file 2. The
genomes of Arabidopsis and rice were searched for the
presence of genes known to act in the metabolism of
DNA lesions, mostly in human, Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and E. coli. When a gene was not found, it indicates either
that the gene was absent in the considered organism or
that the sequence was too varied to be recognized using
our criteria. Later on, genes of rice and Arabidopsis were
also queried against each genome to check the consistency
of the genes. Sequences were also manually checked for
the presence of any wrong annotations. Few probable
wrong annotations were found. For example, BLAST analysis revealed three loci, LOC_Os02g54280,
LOC_Os02g54170 and LOC_Os02g54290, with significant
hits for AtBRU1 in rice, a gene acts as a link between
responses to DNA damage and epigenetic gene silencing
in Arabidopsis. We discarded LOC_Os02g54290 because
it did not contain the BRU1 specific domain.
LOC_Os02g54170 was annotated as BRUSHY 1 while
LOC_Os02g54280 was annotated as retrotransposon protein. CDD analysis has shown that LOC_Os02g54280 contain the BRU1 specific conserved domains,
tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs), with few additional domains like RnaseH
(cd06222). LOC_Os02g54170 has shown to contain only
LRRs and lack TPRs. Thus the possibility of wrong annotation for LOC_Os02g54280, as like LOC_Os02g54290,
was high as it was highly similar to AtBRU1 (1.1e-140,
41.0% identity and 67.3% similar) and also contained all
conserved domains. The identified DRR genes were found
to be distributed on all the rice (3 to 17%) and Arabidopsis
(12 to 30%) chromosomes. In rice, the highest number of
DRR genes (17.48%) was predicted on chromosome 1, the
longest chromosome in the rice genome. Similarly in Arabidopsis, the longest chromosomes 1 and 5 of Arabidopsis
have been found to harbour the highest number of genes
involved in DRR (29.91% and 23.21% respectively) (Additional file 3). Apparently, the distribution of DRR genes in
terms of their involvement in different pathway seems uniform, however a strong bias towards clustering of genes
involved in same pathway on different chromosome
deserve special mention (Additional file 4).
In order to facilitate understanding of the major similarities and differences between two genomes, genes
have been classified as: 1-Excision repair [base excision
repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER) and mismatch repair (MMR)]; 2- Double-Strand Break Repair
[homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous
end joining (NHEJ)] and 3- Other DNA repair related
genes. In the third category, we have assigned all those

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:443
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/443

genes which are not catalogued in KEGG pathway database as the part of main DRR pathways.
Conservation of pathway

We next investigated the degree of conservation of DRR
pathways. Conservation of DNA safeguarding pathways
during evolution was calculated by the average conservation in amino acids and presence/absence of proteins
belonging to a given pathway (Figure 1, Additional file
1). Component of different pathways have been defined

Page 3 of 12

according to KEGG pathway database. Pathway conservation was measured in three different categories: conservation between rice and human proteins (Figure 1a),
conservation between Arabidopsis and human proteins
(Figure 1b) and conservation between Arabidopsis and
rice proteins (Figure 1c). Plants possess few prokaryotes
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae specific DRR proteins also
therefore E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae specific
proteins were used to compare the conservation level
with its plants counterparts. Thus E. coli and

the 100% line.

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:443

Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins replaced the human
proteins in plant-human protein conservation categories
and represented as white circles (Figure 1a and 1b). Proteins which are involved in several pathways were also
included in each pathway to calculate the average conservation score. The best example was the MRN complex, classified in both NHEJ and HR pathway. In
addition to the presence of several interconnections,
pathway such as NER was more conserved than others
in terms of amino acid identity. All genes of NER pathway revealed a high degree of sequence similarity with
their counterparts present in other genomes (Figure 1).
In human and plant pairs, NER, BER and HR pathways
were very close in terms of identity of amino acid while
in Arabidopsis-rice pair, NER and NHEJ pathways were
closer to each other, while considering the characteristics of amino acid identity.
In terms of absence or presence of a particular protein
involved in a given pathway, NER and MMR were found
to be most conserved pathways where merely all components were present while NHEJ and BER were least
conserved pathways of genome maintenance. All components of both sub-pathways of NER, transcriptioncoupled repair (TCR) and global genome repair (GGR)
pathways were well conserved in both genomes except
the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A
(XPA) gene which is involved in the damage-recognition
step of the NER processes, while all genes which are
reported to be involved in eukaryotic MMR pathway are
present in plants. Difference in term of copy number of
genes as seen in BER and NER pathway was not found
in MMR specific proteins may suggest the universal and
utmost functional importance of this pathway. It was
also found that all subunit of a multimeric protein were
not conserved with similar rate during evolution. For
example, POLD1 subunit of Delta-type DNA polymerase
holoenzymes (pold) was always more conserved (At-Hs
-54.1%, Os-Hs-55.4%) than the other subunits while
POLD3 subunit was always least conserved (At-Hs
-25.1%, Os-Hs -21.4%) (Figure 1). Rbx1, an ubiquitin
ligase, was the most conserved gene in plant DRR pathways. Plants Rbx1 genes showed more than 80% identity
to its human homolog. PCNA, DMC and RAD51A were
the other much conserved proteins which showed more
than 60% identity at amino acid level in plant-human
pair. POLD3, PRKDC, RPA3, XRCC4 and NBS1 proteins were the least conserved genes in plant-human
pair which shared less than 25% amino acid. In terms of
difference in number of paralogs, MMR and NHEJ were
much conserved. In both pathways, similar number of
paralogs was found in Arabidopsis and rice genomes
except few exceptions like MRE11 and FEN1. This
result may suggest that MMR and NHEJ pathway have
been naturally preserved as such through out plant

genome evolution. Our analysis suggested that plant
DRR machinery is more closely related to human as
compared to yeast because plants retain more mammalian homologs than the yeast counterparts.
Plants homologs of bacterial DRR gene have very low
sequence similarity but retention of conserved domain
probably suggested the functional conservation of those
proteins. Bacterial homologs were found in all pathways
except NHEJ. These prokaryotic and yeast specific genes
are not well explored in plant genomes except the bacterial RecA gene. RecA, a gene central to general DNA
repair and recombination in bacteria, was found to be
most conserved bacterial homolog in plant which
showed more than 40% amino acid identity in both genomes in comparison to RecA of E. coli. Arabidopsis
encodes orthologs of bacterial RecA proteins which are
targeted to chloroplasts [14,15] and mitochondria [16]
and reported to be associated with DNA repair [16,17].
Complexes of different proteins plays pivotal role in
DNA repair processes. We found that plants appeared
to retain a partner of bacterial protein complexes while
loose other partners. So, in the absence of partner how
these bacterial proteins work would be an important
question for further investigation.
Specificities of plant DRR machinery

Functional studies of different genes involved in core
DRR pathways in plants, especially Arabidopsis, underline the particular and novel behaviour of DRR in plants,
amongst the higher eukaryotes. The function of different
DRR pathways in plants has been more difficult to
demonstrate. For instance, first step in BER is the
removal of a base by a glycosylase. 8-oxo-G is the most
widespread type of damage repaired by the BER pathway
in DNA [18] and plants possess both animal (OGG1)
and bacterial (FPG) homolog that remove 8-oxo-G from
DNA. The reason why plants have retained these apparently redundant enzymes is not known. Several novel
genes, for instance MSH7, BRU1 and RecQsim which
are not present in other eukaryotes, are found to be well
conserved in plants. Presence of these plant specific
genes may lead to a unique DNA repair processes in
plants. For instance, MSH7, a bacterial MutS homolog,
has been found to be exclusive to plants. It interacts
with AtMSH2, as do AtMSH3 and AtMSH6 proteins
(other plant homologs of bacterial MutS). Thus it may
have a role in maintaining genomic stability which is
exclusive to plants [19].
Several mutations which are reported to be lethal in
animals have been found to be non-lethal in Arabidopsis. For example, homozygous mouse knockouts for
ERCC1 died before weaning [20] while atercc1 plants
were found to be phenotypically normal in absence of
exogenous DNA damaging agents [21]. Same was true

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:443
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/443

for RAD50, MRE11, RAD51, MUS81, BRCA1 and
BARD1 also. CRY proteins, members of flavoproteins
superfamily, are reported to be ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life. All members of this superfamily possess
the characteristics of an N-terminal photolyase homology (PHR) domain. In bacteria, these enzymes mediate
photoreactivation but the homologs of CRY protein,
CRY1 and CRY2, in insects, animals and plants play a
role in blue-light perception and circadian rhythm
entrainment instead of DNA repair [22].
DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) represent lethal
DNA damage because they block transcription, replication, and segregation of DNA. Unlike the animals,
SNM1A-deficient Arabidopsis plants were not found to
be hypersensitive to the ICL forming agents like cisplatin and MMC, while displayed a moderate sensitivity to
the bleomycin and H2O2 [23]. In Atsnm1, the frequency
of somatic HR (HRF) was also not found to be
enhanced as compared with the wild-type plants, suggested the existence of an SNM1-dependent recombinational repair process of oxidatively induced DNA
damage in plants [24]. Yeast cells deficient for Ku70
have been shown to possess short-ended telomeres [25],
while Arabidopsis plants lacking Ku70 or Ku80 found to
have longer telomeres than wild-type [26,27]. These
results clearly indicated the different mechanisms of telomere maintenance in plants. Beside the above mentioned difference, plants lack many important genes like
RAD52, RAD55 and RAD57 which play key role in different DRR pathways in other organisms. Although several complexes that are reported to be involved in DRR
other than plants were also well conserved in plant but
few members like DNA polymerase b and DNA ligase 3
were absent in plants suggested towards the specificity
of plant DRR machinery (Figure 2). Presence of some
novel genes and unconventional behaviour of DRR
mutant plant lines suggests occurrence of some novel
process to cope up with different types of DNA damages
in plants.
Differences in DRR machinery among plants

Despite of strong conservation of DRR proteins, we have
observed intriguing difference in DRR genes in plant
genomes also. This difference ranges from difference in
number of homlogs to the absence or presence of a particular protein (Additional file 1). For example Arabidopsis have been found to contain two paralogous
copies of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
group B (XPB), a component of the transcription factor
IIH (TFIIH), gene. Analysis of the presence of XPB gene
in different plant genomes including rice, Medicago
trunculata, Carica papaya, Vitis venifera, Zea mays,
Glycine max, sorghum and populus have indicated that
beside Glycine max none of the analyzed plant genome

indicated in the inset.

has two paralogs for XPB genes. Both genes (Joint Genome Institute accession number-Glyma08g01970 and
Glyma05g37610) of Glycine max were found to be originated from intergenomic duplication from Arabidopsis.
These results indicated towards genus specific expansion
of XPB and worth further investigation. FEN1, a nuclease, show an interesting pattern of evolution. All monocotyledonous genomes we analyzed, rice, Zea mays,
sorghum and Brachypodium, were found to contain two
copies of FEN1 and these copies were not the products
of intragenomic duplication. On the other hand, all the
dicotyledonous genomes that we have studied, Arbidopsis, Medicago trunculata, Vitis venifera, Glycine max
and populous, have single copy of FEN1 except Glycine
max. These copies of FEN1 in Glycine max were the

product of intragenomic duplication and, unlike monocotyledonous FEN1 genes, acquire same node on phylogenetic tree (our unpublished data). Thus, FEN1 shows
lineage specific evolution. Significant difference has also
been observed in the duplication level in DRR genes of
Arabidopsis and rice. Taken together, these results
possibly reflecting some differences in the mechanisms
and pathways by which damaged DNA are repaired by
Arabidopsis and rice genomes.
Functional diversity of DRR genes

Many DRR proteins display a number of diverse activities unrelated to their DRR processes. Their role in normal plant growth and development is well established
[28,29]. We have used DRR genes in plants to investigate functional diversity and complexity of genome
maintenance pathways. To gain insight into the functional diversity of predicted rice and Arabidopsis DRR,
Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (GO Consortium,
2001) were explored. This analysis has revealed that the
largest number of DNA replication and repair genes,
21.51% and 18.84% for rice and Arabidopsis respectively,
fall into the DNA binding molecular functional categories. As expected, relatively good number of genes
(38.65% and 32.04% of total DRR genes of rice and Arabidopsis respectively) falls in DNA metabolic process
biological process category (Figure 3). It was interesting
to note that a large fraction, 25.46% of rice and 28.28%
of Arabidopsis DRR pathway were found to respond
against stress. However, a significantly large number of
DRR genes fall into cell cycle, protein modification process and biosynthetic process biological process categories compared to total genes analyzed, indicating their
crucial role in fundamental cellular processes. Although
sixty nine genes of rice were found without any GO
annotation but percentage of genes predicted under various molecular function and biological process categories were similar for both rice and Arabidopsis
probably indicating towards the high conservation of
DRR process.
Gene duplicates and their evolution in DRR genes

The importance of gene duplication in supplying raw
genetic material to biological evolution has been consensus among researchers. Thus, investigation of gene
duplication in the genome not only appropriate for the
study of evolutionary processes, but also allow an opening to examine the evolutionary history of multiunit
protein complexes that have come up through gene
duplication. To counter the adverse conditions, the
plant genomes have been shown to follow two mechanisms: one was that there are more copies of the gene
families than in animals, and the other was the divergence of genes to fit the pressure of positive selection

Figure 3 Functional categorization of rice and Arabidopsis DRR
genes: biological process (a, b) and molecular function (c, d) were
determined for rice (a, c) and Arabidopsis (b, d) DRR genes and

[30]. Therefore, we have next investigated the duplication in DRR genes in search of evidence on the mechanisms by which plant cells evolve their DRR machinery.
Segmental duplication has shown to occur most frequently in plants since most plants are diploidized polyploids and retain numerous duplicated chromosomal
blocks in their genomes [31]. Thus in the present study,
we considered only segmental duplication and avoided
other kinds of duplications. To gain insight into the
expansion mechanism of DNA repair genes we investigated their chromosome locations and gene structures
also (Additional files 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). We found that in
Arabidopsis BER pathway, 5 genes namely Tag, NTH,
DML1, HMGB1 and MAGLP are duplicated while none
of the BER pathways genes have been duplicated in rice.
MAGLP, Tag and DML1 are duplicated multiple times
in Arabidopsis. MAGLP (locus AT1G19480) duplicated
twice into AT3G50880 and AT1G75230. Although these
three genes were found to be located in a paralogous
cluster in the phylogenetic tree (data not shown),
AT1G19480 and AT1G75230 showed the closest paralogous relations in the terminal. Both AT1G19480 and

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:443
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/443

AT1G75230 followed the same intergenic regions. Eight
and nine genes in their upstream and downstream
respectively were highly conserved suggesting the segmental duplication origin of both loci. Although
AT3G50880 faced an intron loss but it retained the
functional domain. Among seven predicted candidates
for Tag in Arabidopsis, four loci were found to be originated from duplication at different time interval. Locus
AT1G15970-AT1G80850 (Ks value 0.75) and locus
AT1G15970-AT1G75090 were came into origin very
recently in comparison to locus AT1G15970AT3G12710 (Ks value -1). The phylogenetic distribution
of different loci also supported the same assumptions.
In loci AT1G15970-AT1G80850 and loci AT1G15970AT1G75090 pairs, AT1G80850 and AT1G75090 showed
an intron gain while in loci AT1G15970-AT3G12710
pair, loci AT3G12710 showed an intron loss during the
long evolutionary period. Eight genes in upstream and
three genes in downstream of loci AT1G15970AT1G80850 were found to be completely conserved
suggesting that this block was also originated by segmental duplication. NTH gene pair (Ks value 0.55) was
a result of recent duplication and locus AT2G31450
showed two intron gain events in comparison to locus
AT1G05900. HMGB1 gene pair (Ks value -1) was found
to be an ancient duplication where locus AT4G35570
showed an intron loss event in comparison to locus
AT3G51880. In DML1 gene, both duplication events,
loci AT2G36490-AT3G10010 (DML1-DML2) (Ks value
2.69) and loci AT2G36490- AT5G04560 (DML1-DML3)
(Ks value 2.69), seemed to occur in very close time span
while DML3 and DML2 were sharing same node on
phylogenetic tree probably because of old duplication
event by which these two non-duplicates come closer
than DML1 (Figure 4a).
In the sense of duplication, we found NER as a unique
pathway where eight genes, CDK7, PCNA, RPA1, RBX,
RAD23, LIG1 and DDB1, were found to be duplicated
in Arabidopsis while RAD23 and DMC1 were duplicated
in rice genome. CDK7, RBX1 and RAD23 paralogs were
duplicated many times in course of Arabidopsis evolution. DDB1 (Ks value 0.57) and RPA1 (Ks value 0.79)
duplicated quite recently than PCNA (Ks value 1.13) but
the all three genes pairs retained same gene structure
(Additional file 5). LIG1 duplication (Ks value 0.39) was
quite newer but locus AT1G49250 showed an intron
gain in comparison to locus AT1G08130. CDK7 duplicated three times. Among three gene pairs, locus
AT1G18040-AT1G73690 pair appears to duplicated very
recently and locus AT1G73690 maintained same gene
structure as AT1G18040. On the other hand, other two
pairs AT1G18040- AT1G67580 and AT1G18040AT3G48750, ancient duplicates, showed intron loss and
intron gain events during evolution. RBX1 and RAD23

showed relatively complex trend of evolution. Four paralogs of RAD23 are present in Arabidopsis which appear
to be originated in different duplication events. Gene
pair, locus AT1G16190-AT1G79650 (RAD23ARAD23B) duplicated recently (Ks value 0.6) and retained
the similar gene structure. Locus AT3G02540, RAD23C,
was involved in two different duplication events with
AT5G16090, RAD23A, (Ks value 0.63) and AT5G38470,
RAD23 D, (Ks value 1.49) at two different times. It was
worth notice that RAD23C - RAD23 D pair, an ancient
duplication event, retained the same gene structure but
RAD23C - RAD23A differ in their gene structure.
Among rice RAD23 paralogs, loci LOC_Os08g33340
and LOC_Os09g24200 were found to be duplicated to
each other and maintained the similar gene structure
(Figure 4b, Additional file 5).
It is also interesting to note that RAD23 was found to
be duplicated in all four genomes, Arabidopsis, rice,
Populus and Sorghum. Populus was unique among four
genome as it seems to possess more than four paralogs
for RAD23 and all of them are originate by inter and
intra-genomic gene duplication events (data not shown

for RBX1 were duplicated relatively recently (Ks value
1.21) but AT5G20570 was itself derived from the duplication of locus AT3G05870 very anciently (Ks value -1)
and showed three intron gain events. Although it
retained the ancient RBX1 (RING-BOX 1) domain but

found to be involved in new functions and pathway
probably indicating the subfunctionalization (Figure 5a).
Phylogenetic study has supported the idea that loci
AT3G42830 and AT5G2057 are relatively closer than
locus AT3G05870 (data not shown). Another gene
DMC1 was also found to be duplicated in rice and
maintain the same gene structure in evolution (Additional file 6).

Arabidopsis deserve special description because of their
complex mode of evolution. Two loci, AT1G10930 and
AT1G60930, were predicted as putative candidates for
RecQl4 in Arabidopsis. Both loci appear to be duplicated
recently while the locus AT1G10930 was duplicated
from locus AT3G05740, candidate gene for RecQI1,
very earlier and acquire many introns and different
function also (Figure 5b). Functional diversion of these
two loci, AT1G10930 and AT1G60930, has been discussed in great detail else where [32]. The similar kind
of evolution pattern was also found in SMC2 and SMC3
where both candidate gene for SMC2, AT3G47460 and
AT5G62410, were duplicated recently while locus
AT5G62410 itself duplicated from locus AT2G27170,
SMC3, (Figure 4c and Figure 5c). MMS2 (UEV1) gene
family has four members and all of them were duplicated in pair-wise manner to each other. This assumption was also supported by the phylogenetic analysis
data where duplicated pair acquires the nearest nodes of
its duplicated partners (Figure 4d). In Rice, UBC, SSPR1
and CHEK1 genes were found to be duplicated and surprisingly most of the genes maintained the same gene
structure.
DRR in chloroplast and mitochondria

According to the endosymbiotic theory of organelle evolution, plastids and mitochondria are descendants of a
prokaryotic photosynthetic organism that established a
symbiotic relationship with an early eukaryotic host
[33]. Both organelles maintain a separate genome. Organelle genomes have not retained all genes of its ancestor
because part of genes may have been lost, some of them
functionally replaced by genes in the nucleus, while
others have been transmitted to the nucleus [34]. Coordination of gene expression among nucleus, plastids and
mitochondria is critical for plant development and survival. Although DRR in animal organelles has been studied up to some extent [35] but the role of organelle
DRR in the survival and evolution of plants is less
explored. However very recently few researchers have
successfully demonstrated the presence of DRR processes in mitochondria and chloroplast [36,37]. Therefore, in the present study we have further predicted the
cellular localization of all putative DRR genes in higher
plants to gain the insight into organelles DRR. TargetP
[38] prediction suggested that 17% and 10% of all DRR
genes studied here in Arabidopsis were of chloroplast
and mitochondrial origin respectively while 19% and
17% of rice genes were chloroplast and mitochondrial
origin respectively (Figure 6). These significant similarities in number of organelle’s gene probably indicated
towards their strong conservation during evolution and
needs further detail studies. 24 and 21 genes among
Arabidopsis and rice DRR genes were prokaryotic

compartments.

specific. Four and eight genes among prokaryotic specific genes were predicted to be non-organeller gene. The
presence of prokaryotic specific genes in nuclear genome may be due to the transfer of these genes from
organelle’s genome to nuclear genome during course of
evolution because the migration of genetic information
between mitochondria, chloroplasts and nuclei have
been fundamental part of evolution and has a ongoing
impact on the biology of cells.

Conclusion
We have utilized the benefits of presence of whole genome sequence of rice and Arabidopsis to analyze the
uniformity and ubiquity of DRR genes and pathways in
higher plant genome. Additionally, extension of many
previously reported components have facilitated comparison within plants and between plants and other
eukaryotes. Through genome-wide bioinformatic analysis and a comprehensive review of the existing literature,
we have described that the core DRR machinery is
highly conserved across plant species and displays many
features in regular with other eukaryotes and some characteristics that are unique to plants. The absence and
the presence of certain genes are discussed and predictions are made considering the particular aspects of the
human/Saccharomyces cerevisiae/E. coli. The detected
similarity and differences broaden present information
about what is known for DRR in the plants, and offer a
constructive framework for further experimental studies
in these organisms. Generalization to other plant species
is affirmed by the inclusion of both a monocot and a
dicot in this analysis. Finally, extensive comparison of
rice and Arabidopsis genome in respect to presence and
absence of DRR genes may help understanding the basic
difference between monocots and dicots. Furthermore,
the datasets provided can serve as valuable source for
further comparative, evolutionary and functional studies.

A detailed understanding of the core DRR machinery in
plants will provide researchers with an important tool
for understanding what makes plants unique with
respect to repair and developmental competence and for
investigating how plant genome maintenance strategies
differ from the mechanisms employed by animals.

Methods
Identification of DRR genes

All the annotated gene and protein sequences of rice
chromosomes (TIGR release 6) were downloaded from
The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) Rice Genome Annotation website [39]. For Arabidopsis, all the
annotated gene and protein sequences (TAIR release 8)
were downloaded from The Arabidopsis Information
Resource (TAIR) database [40]. The redundant and
genes annotated as transposable elements were removed
to get a final list of non-redundant genes in rice and
Arabidopsis. To identify DRR genes we used two different criteria. To select the correct putative orthologue
first, we performed global alignments using the FASTA
BLAST suit [41] and rejected all alignments with less
than 20% identity, unless a portion of the protein
showed a very strong similarity. Secondly, a possible
conserved motif was searched using the Conserved
Domain Database (CDD) [42]. When none of these two
approaches produced significant result, the corresponding gene was discarded. Primarily, Potential DRR genes
in rice and Arabidopsis genome were identified by
sequence similarity searches using the DNA repair genes
of human, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli as seed
sequences orthologs and keyword searches. Secondly
Arabidopsis DRR genes were used to identify the putative DNA repair genes in rice genome. We, next, we
searched the primary literature, and when presented,
included experimental results that concerned to plant
systems to authenticate the annotation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database [43] was used as guide for the gene involve in
main repair and recombination pathway while we follow the classification of Wood et al. for the DNA
repair genes[44].
Analysis of DRR genes

The percentage of amino acid identity between a given
human/Saccharomyces cerevisiae/E. coli gene and its
corresponding orthologue in Arabidopsis and rice was
obtained from the Smith-Waterman alignment between
the two sequences. Means were calculated using these
values.
Duplicated genes and their Ka, Ks and e-values in
DRR proteins of rice, Arabidopsis, sorghum and populus
were extracted out from the Plant Genome Duplication
Database (PGDD) [45]. PGDD is a public database to

Page 10 of 12

identify and catalogue plant genes in terms of intra or
inter-genome syntenic relationships.
Phylogenetic trees were generated for a group of DNA
repair protein homologs. Protein sequences were aligned
using the Clustal W multiple sequence alignment program [46]. Only unambiguously aligned positions
(excluding poorly conserved and gap regions) were used
in phylogenetic analysis, which was performed using the
MEGA4 [47]. Neighbor-Joining and Parsimony methods
were used for phylogenetic tree searching and inference.
The phylogenetic trees were tested by bootstrap analysis
with 10000 replications and strict consensus trees were
constructed. Similar topologies were found for both
algorithms employed, and only Neighbor-Joining being
displayed. We used PGDD naming convention for the
populus and sorghum dataset in this analysis as the original naming style for predicted models were un-informative. The respective accession numbers used in this
analysis and the original naming of predicted genes are
given in Additional file 9.
Functional diversity of DRR proteins was carried out
according to the GO rules using the gene ontology tools
at http://www.agbase.msstate.edu. Only two independent
sets of ontologies were used to describe a gene product:
(1) the biological process in which the gene product
participates and (2) the molecular function that
describes the gene product activities.
Additional methods are given in Additional file 10.
