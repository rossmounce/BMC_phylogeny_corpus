Abstract
Background: This paper proposes a novel framework for bioinformatics assisted biosurveillance
and early warning to address the inefficiencies in traditional surveillance as well as the need for
more timely and comprehensive infection monitoring and control. It leverages on breakthroughs
in rapid, high-throughput molecular profiling of microorganisms and text mining.
Results: This framework combines the genetic and geographic data of a pathogen to reconstruct
its history and to identify the migration routes through which the strains spread regionally and
internationally. A pilot study of Salmonella typhimurium genotype clustering and temporospatial
outbreak analysis demonstrated better discrimination power than traditional phage typing. Half of
the outbreaks were detected in the first half of their duration.
Conclusion: The microbial profiling and biosurveillance focused text mining tools can enable
integrated infectious disease outbreak detection and response environments based upon
bioinformatics knowledge models and measured by outcomes including the accuracy and timeliness
of outbreak detection.

Background
Current early warning systems successfully detect large
outbreaks but show significant delays and low sensitivity
in detecting moderate and small epidemics [1,2]. It is also
estimated that a one-week delay in the implementation of
control measures for SARS resulted in a 2.6-fold increase
in the mean epidemic size and a four-week extension of
the mean epidemic duration [2].

The body of knowledge on the molecular profiles and epidemiology of pathogens accumulated in databases and
biomedical literature has been also expanding. We have
argued that bioinformatics pathogen profiling can help to
predict patient outcomes, identify markers that can be
applied for early diagnosis and enable tailored interventions, commonly referred to as "personalized medicine"
[3]. We propose in this paper a novel framework for bioinformatics assisted biosurveillance and therapy that
addresses the inefficiencies in traditional public health

surveillance as well as the need for more timely and comprehensive infectious disease monitoring and control. It
leverages from recent breakthroughs in high-throughput
molecularprofiling of microorganisms and text mining as
well as upon the growing electronic sources of knowledge
about the molecular epidemiology of pathogens with epidemic potential.
A pathogen profile can be considered as a single multivariate observation or a set of observations, comprised of
classes of specific attributes, which are designed for a comparison with a knowledgebase. In contrast to traditional
subtyping based on phenotypic characteristics, such as
serotype, biotype, phage type or antibiogram (susceptibility to antimicrobials), genetic profiling describes the phenotypic potential within the nucleic acid sequence.
Sequence-based typing on one hand and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, plasmid fingerprinting or pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on the other, can be
viewed as examples of direct and indirect methods of
assessing nucleic acid sequence, respectively. They provide
both strain typing and key phylogenic data [3].
Methods based on repetitive sequences present at several
loci in the genome have been developed with the potential to generate consistent pathogen profiles that are amenable to standardization and database cataloging.
Genotyping systems based on comparison of sizes and
numbers of different DNA fragments separated by gel
electrophoresis express their results in continuous values
which are less reliable than direct sequence-based methods, due to the lack of precision and reproducibility. Typing systems that use markers with categorized values (e.g.,
multilocus sequence typing, MLST) are intrinsically highly
reproducible and more appropriate for library typing.
Typing techniques like MLST that allow classification consistent with phylogenetic relationships are useful tools for
studying global epidemiology. However, techniques that
provide real-time or near real-time typing capability are
likely to provide the most relevant information and therefore have the most impact.

hospital MRSA clones, and enterotoxin A may be involved
in the septic shock. Panton Valentine Leucocidin (PV) has
emerged as a virulence factor in community-acquired
MRSA infections responsible for the high mortality associated with necrotizing pneumonia [5].
There is an increasing benefit in using rapid molecular
profiling for MRSA outbreak detection. For example, rapid
outbreak detection by rapid MRSA spa typing has become
a potential alternative to traditional approaches to hospital-acquired infection control [3,6]. In one study, automated clonal alerts, based on real-time spa typing of
hospital MRSA isolates and temporal-scan test statistics,
were 100% and 95.2% sensitive and specific, respectively,
in identifying outbreaks and more sensitive and timely
than routine surveillance [6]. The magnitude of the surge
in reports and the geographical spread of virulent MRSA
clones are illustrated in Figure 1. However, this growing
body of retrospective evidence remains underutilized in
the cluster investigations. There is an urgent need for tools
that can alert clinicians about trajectories of the spread of
microbial clones of public health significance.

Results

Genotyping assisted infectious disease control
The conceptual framework of bioinformatics assisted
infectious disease control presents a case how microbial
genomics can be integrated with clinical data to cluster
patients belonging to the same outbreak or to predict
responses to treatment (Figure 2). Microbial genotype
data and search results are inputs and early warnings are
outputs in the model. Genotype mining and matching
environments utilise biomedical text and database
searches for phenotype-to-genotype studies (direct association analysis of candidate genes), genotype-to-phenotype studies and whole genome analysis (indirect
association analysis) in order to generate knowledge (i.e.,
rules and algorithms) concerning the relationships
among microbial genes, antimicrobials and patient outcomes, and the effects of gene variation on these relationships. This framework combines the genetic and
spatiotemporal data of a pathogen to reconstruct its history and to identify many of the migration routes through
which the strains spread regionally and internationally.

Illustrative scenario
The emergence of multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) as a significant cause of hospital- and community-acquired morbidity and mortality has prompted calls
for better surveillance systems supported by analysis of
the molecular epidemiology of MRSA [4]. Different genotypes produce many virulence factors associated with certain severe infections and caused by MRSA clones
distributed worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests
associations between specific MRSA genotypes, clinical
syndromes and patient outcomes. Specifically, super-antigenic exotoxins appear to be major virulence factors in

The searches and analyses are conducted on two levels.
First, genotypes or pathogen profiles are compared with
local databases to detect recent transmission or to predict
therapy outcomes. Then, global search is performed to
collect the information about temporal and spatial distribution of genotypes or profiles obtained, in order to discover transmission pathways and enhance clinical
policies. Once a profile is constructed, it can be matched
with those of others or with existing datasets using similarity measures and clustering techniques. Probabilistic or
information theoretic distance functions and clustering

Genomic profiling of pathogens, knowledge
representation and text mining
A pathogen profile is a synthesis of various markers and
clinical end-points extractable from medical charts or
knowledge sources that characterize an individual
patient's clinical and public health outcomes. A significant increase in our knowledge of the molecular epidemiology of biothreats has been reflected in the explosion of
NCBI submissions (genomic data with or without annotation) and PubMed publications related to new variants
of virulence or antibiotic resistance genes and their spread
in hospitals, communities, countries and continents over
the last five years (Figure 3).

Pathogen profiles can benefit from integration with
knowledge representations that express the relationships
and entities from the biological hierarchy. Ontologies and
controlled vocabularies (UMLS, LOINC and SNOMED®)
have emerged as tools for knowledge management [7,8].
Figure 4 presents the genomic profile of a hypothetical

MRSA showing genomic markers of virulence, antibiotic
resistance and clonality. Microbial profiles offer data
models that are suited to semantic representations, which
could be used both for reasoning as well as enhanced
indexing. Vocabularies provide mechanisms for integrating high-level terms used in medical charts (e.g., "Tuberculosis" or "Food poisoning") with the low-level terms
employed in the clinical bioinformatics (e.g., "MRSA
SCCmec IV clone" or "Salmonella typhimurium MLVA 2-711-7-3 profile").
The majority of new genes and genomic markers are
found in GenBank, while reports of the occurrence of
known genes in new locations or their phenotypic characteristics are available from either Internet sources or peerreviewed manuscripts. The presence or absence of particular genes or genetic elements can now be indicated by
DNA or RNA sequencing-based typing systems which produce binary or octal representations. Information extraction will be an increasingly important measure for
locating and assembling critical information relevant to
the surveillance of infectious disease outbreaks in a timely
fashion. There is already substantial prior work that aims

to extract information from news articles reporting outbreaks, applied to online sources such as blogs and news
feeds [9]. Text mining applications for detecting genetic
mutations have also recently emerged [10]. In order to
track the spread of pathogens and their various strains, we
envision the mining of PubMed publications. Automated
search agents and text mining utilities would be able to
monitor new publications and check for say new strains of
antibiotic resistance, tracking behavior over time.

Biosurveillance pilot study
Near real time Salmonella surveillance was employed to
test the framework and to further explore the potential of
molecular typing-based early warning for outbreaks of
diseases with epidemic potential. In early 2006, the Centre for Infectious Diseases & Microbiology, The University
of Sydney, Westmead Hospital introduced routine Salmonella typhimurium (STM) fingerprinting. Specifically, clonally related strains were identified by multi-locus variable
number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) which was
shown to be superior to gel-based typing for both surveillance and outbreak investigations of STM [12]. MLVA is

based on the identification of short sequence repeats that
vary in copy number in the microbial genome at various
loci. MLVA detects polymorphisms at five different sites in
the STM genome. Four regions of detection are on the bacterial chromosome and one is located on the serotype specific plasmid pSLT. MLVA has high discriminatory power
within clonal species and appears to be more rapid and
more amenable to standardization than pulse-field gel

tion system was significantly affected by the cluster definition employed. Around 50% of STM outbreaks are
detected in the first half of their duration (Figure 5). This
definition should take into account the local prevalence of
STM clones as well as the public health resources available
to investigate detected outbreaks. Descriptions of outbreaks caused by STM MLVA genotypes and implicated
food sources have been also identified in publicly available Internet sources. Figure 6 provides an example of such
a description with attributes employed in the text mining.

Prospective evaluation of rapid, molecular typing-based
clustering of 816 STM isolates recovered from patients in
New South Wales and Queensland in November 2006 –
March 2007 identified 44 clusters involving 69% of all
isolates tested. The average number of isolates per cluster
was 12 (range 4–67). Three distinct temporal and spatial
patterns were identified: (1) new point-source clusters
localized in space and time, (20 geographically distributed cases of STM infections over a short period of time,
and (3) the endemic activity of STM. An MLVA-based system demonstrated better discrimination power than traditional phage typing, identifying 9 and 11 independent
clusters within each of two endemic phage types PT170
and PT135a, respectively. The performance of the detec-

Discussion
Early warning for population health and infection control
Microbial genotyping improves the efficiency of outbreak
investigations as it confirms or refutes epidemiological
links among cases and between cases and potential environmental sources, thus triggering public health investigations. In our pilot, two types of early warning were
considered: frequency alarm and the new MLVA type
alarm. However, the utility of pathogen profiling goes
beyond specific questions related to the investigation of
possible outbreaks. It can be used also for disease monitoring, by identifying the transmission events and the
associations between microbial types and clinical outcomes. Molecular profiling can assist in the assessment of

the reproductive rates of infection during epidemics, in
making infection control policies more pathogen-specific
[3]. Molecular typing also facilitates the detection of
chains and patterns of infection transmission and the construction of epidemic trees.
More bacterial genomes are being sequenced by the growing number of laboratories and genomic data stored and
annotated online. Public databases such as MLSTNet
http://www.mlst.net, PulseNet http://www.cdc.gov/
pulsenet/ and the BioPortal http://www.bioportal.org,
among others, allow access and matching of bacterial or
viral isolates [14,15]. Linking systematically annotated

profiles with clinical and research databases can identify
previously unrecognized associations between phenotype, genotype, environment and host responses and can
potentially identify the specific genes that govern them.
Networks, which are created by relationships among phenotype, disease expression, environment, experimental
context and associated genes with differential expression,
could provide new insights into microbial interactions
and pathogenesis [3,14]. This approach has been fruitful
in metagenomics, and information management systems,
capable of assisting with genotyping or functional genomics are being developed.

Impact of a cluster definition on the effectiveness of STM early warnings
Figure 5
Impact of a cluster definition on the effectiveness of STM early warnings. Clusters defined as two (N = 2) or more isolates with
the same MLVA genotype. Total numbers of isolates clustered are in parentheses.
A particularly interesting prospect of this framework is the
integration of molecular typing with epidemiological
information, potentially achieving the global real-time
epidemiological surveillance of pathogens with epidemic
potential. Our MLVA pilot relied on a single database
source for strain comparisons. However, surveillance typing networks such as SeqNet or second-generation
PulseNet have improved the speed of outbreak detection
and made possible the exchange of data between laboratories. In such 'on-line' surveillance systems, novel and
previously characterized strains can be compared and
grouped by cluster analysis. Spatial surveillance using
emerging geographic information systems enhances the
likelihood that even localized events will be detected and
their extent and variables measured in space and time
[16]. The output from these systems ultimately needs to
be integrated into clinical and diagnostic processes.

The systematic construction of pathogen profiles would
enable data to be integrated and shared, which is essential
for successful surveillance and disease management. The
heterogeneity of pathogen, host and environment imply
that any individual marker is rarely sufficient to reflect the
clinical and epidemiological complexity and ensure a reliable prediction of outcomes. However, a combination of
markers is more likely to do so. Current genomic technology can rapidly and reliably produce this type of data
from large numbers of strains to monitor routes of transmission or contribute to inventories of microbial gene
polymorphisms and translate them into innovative typing
procedures. Selective gene profiling can be directly linked
to phenotypic characteristics such as virulence and antimicrobial resistance.

Antimicrobial therapy optimization
Innovative bioinformatics tools that predict drug resistance or response to therapy from genotype have been
developed to provide clinical decision support. These
tools use either a statistical approach, in which the
inferred model and prediction are treated as regression
problems, or machine learning algorithms, in which the
model is addressed as a classification problem. A statistical learning approach to the ranking of therapeutic
choices often relies on a direct correlation between the
baseline microbial profile, the therapeutic decision and
the response to treatment e.g. expected reduction in viral
load resulting from anti-HIV combination therapy [17]. It
highlights the need for databases that can be widely
shared, and allow the correlation of quality-controlled
data from genotypic resistance assays and treatment regimens with short- and long-term clinical outcomes.

Conclusion
The bioinformatics assisted infectious disease control
framework targets questions of immediate public health
and clinical utility and utilizes the molecular genotyping
of biothreats in a clinically focused manner. The concept
of pathogen profiling described here provides a framework for data integration and sharing to ensure that the
flood of data from new molecular technologies will be
used effectively in public health surveillance and disease
management. The identification of new sets of molecular
markers and the development of biosurveillance focused
text mining tools will enable innovative integrated infectious disease outbreak detection and response environments based upon bioinformatics knowledge models and
measured by outcomes including the accuracy and timeliness of outbreak detection and response.

Methods
Microbial profiling
Octal code profiles were assigned to each isolate for comparison and spatio-temporal clustering. A genotyping cluster was defined as a maximal set of at least four isolates that
share the same MLVA genotype, among a set of isolates
from infected patients, each with an associated date and
location (e.g., collection date and patient's residential
address) [13]. This definition was tested retrospectively
using the space-time permutation scan statistic method
with default values for bonds on cluster size (50% of population at risk and 50% of study period).
System implementation
The system was implemented as both a stand-alone and as
a web application with Map Objects (ESRI) GIS for map
visualisation. MLVA patterns were matched using hierarchical cluster analysis. Minimum spanning trees analysis
was also used to overcome the potential loss of information introduced by the latter.
