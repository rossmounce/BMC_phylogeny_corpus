Abstract
The natural infection of phlebotomine sand flies by Leishmania parasites was surveyed in a desert area of Pakistan
where cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic. Out of 220 female sand flies dissected, one sand fly, Phlebotomus kazeruni, was positive for flagellates in the hindgut. Analyses of cytochrome b (cyt b), glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences identified the
parasite as a Trypanosoma species of probably a reptile or amphibian. This is the first report of phlebotomine sand
flies naturally infected with a Trypanosoma species in Pakistan. The possible infection of sand flies with Trypanosoma species should be taken into consideration in epidemiological studies of vector species in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic.
Findings
Phlebotomine sand flies are blood-sucking insects
belonging to the family Psychodidae in the order Diptera [1]. The identification of sand fly species is epidemiologically very important because less than 10 percent
of over 800 species described are responsible for the
transmission of human pathogens such as flagellate protozoa of the genus Leishmania [1-3]. Some sand fly species are reported to transmit non-pathogenic flagellates
of Endotrypanum species, originally identified as intraerythrocytic parasites of sloths in the New World [4]. In
addition, some Trypanosoma species of mammals,
lizards, snakes and toads are transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies [5-11]. Since the flagellated forms of
these parasites in the insect gut are morphologically
similar to those of Leishmania, careful differentiation is
needed for the epidemiological study of the vectors
responsible for circulating Leishmania species.
In this study, the natural infection of sand flies by
Leishmania was surveyed in a desert area of Pakistan
where cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic. Sand flies
were captured at Sono Khan (26° 52’N, 68° 03’E), Sindh
Province on the 28-29 th of June 2004. Shannon traps
with a single compartment (1.0 × 1.0 × 1.3 meters in

width, length and height, respectively) were used for the
collection. The captured sand flies were dissected and the
species identified based on the morphology of their spermathecae. These flies were also examined for Leishmania
in the gut microscopically at × 400 magnification. The
flagellates detected were inoculated into Difco blood agar
(USMARU) biphasic medium containing 20% defibrinated rabbit blood, and later co-cultured with Spodoptera
frugiperda Sf9 insect cells in Grace’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The rest of the flagellates
in the gut of the sand fly were fixed in absolute ethanol
for molecular biological analyses. Genomic DNA was
extracted from the ethanol-fixed specimen, and the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene was amplified from the flagellate
with primers prepared for the leishmanial cyt b gene
(L.cyt-S: GGTGTAGGTTTTAGTYTAGG and L.cyt-R:
CTACAATAAACAAATCATAATATRCAATT) [12].
The glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase
(gGAPDH) and small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU
rRNA) genes were also amplified from the parasite using
gGAPDH (G3: TTYGCCGYATYGGYCGCATGG and
G5: ACMAGRTCCACCACRCGGTG) and SSU rRNAspecific primers (TRY927F: GAAACAAGAAACACGGGAG and TRY927R: CTACTGGGCAGCTTGGA)
designed for trypanosomatids [13,14]. The PCR products
were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega,
Madison, WI), and the sequences of the inserts of
the plasmids were determined by the dideoxy chain

amplified from isolates of flagellates from P. kazeruni (IKAZ/PK/04/SKF32), and the sequences were determined. Phylogenetic analyses of gGAPDH
and SSU rRNA gene sequences were performed by the neighbor-joining method together with those from 25 and 34 Trypanosoma species,
respectively. The sequences from the database are represented by “the name of the species and isolate (host of the isolate): GenBank accession

termination method using a BigDye Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The gGAPDH and SSU rRNA gene sequences were
aligned with CLUSTAL W software [15] and examined
using the program MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis) version 4.0 [16]. Phylogenetic analyses
were performed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) methods with the distance algorisms available in the MEGA package [16].
In this survey, 220 female sand flies were dissected for
identification at the species level, and four species of the
genus Phlebotomus were recognized. Among them, the
two most prevalent species were identified as Phlebotomus (P.) sergenti (39 flies) and P. papatasi (27 flies).
Other Phlebotomus species were P. nuri (10 flies) and P.
kazeruni (1 fly), and the rest (143 flies) were identified
as Sergentomyia species. The natural infection of sand
flies by flagellates was detected in the hindgut of P.
kazeruni. The cyt b gene sequence of the parasite was
determined and analyzed with the BLASTn program.
Unexpectedly, the sequence showed only 80.6-82.8%
homology with those of Leishmania species and 83.6%
homology with that of Trypanosoma (T.) brucei brucei,
suggesting the flagellate belonged to the genus Trypanosoma. For further characterization, the gGAPDH and
SSU rRNA genes were amplified from the flagellate and
the sequences were analyzed since these genes have
been well studied in trypanosomatids [13,14]. The
gGAPDH and SSU rRNA genes from the parasite (DDBJ
accession numbers: AB520637 and AB520638, respectively) had more than 90% sequence similarity with
those of amphibian trypanosomes such as T. fallisi, T.
mega and T. rotatorium isolated from toad and frog.
Phylogenetic analyses of the gGAPDH and SSU rRNA
genes showed that the flagellate within P. kazeruni
belongs to a clade of amphibian trypanosomes that
includes a chameleon trypanosome, T. therezieni, but
the sequences did not completely match those from any
reported species (Fig. 1A and 1B). In addition, the parasite from P. kazeruni located in a separate clade from
Trypanosoma species isolated from Amazonian sand
flies, which have closer relationships with anuran trypanosomes captured in Amazonia [10] (Fig. 1B). These
results strongly suggested that the parasite is a novel or
genetically uncharacterized Trypanosoma species of an
amphibian or possibly reptile. The parasite was successfully isolated as a culture (code number: IKAZ/PK/04/
SKF32), which was confirmed to correspond to the original by the SSU rRNA gene analysis. The parasites
markedly grew in Grace’s medium in a co-culture with
Sf9 insect cells. On glass-slide smears prepared from the
liquid culture, rosettes of parasites with an oval shape
and epimastigotes varying in shape and length were
observed (Fig. 2). The parasites showed the features of

Page 3 of 5

Trypanosoma species, demonstrating characteristics
such as a flagellum, a kinetoplast and an undulating
membrane (Fig. 2). The research area was a desert community, and no amphibian was observed during the field
trip. However, numbers of geckoes were found on the
walls of houses, including sites where the Shannon traps
were set. Thus, two Japanese reptile species (Takydromus tachydromoides and Gekko japonicus) and one Japanese amphibian (Hyla japonica) were intraperitoneally
injected with 5 × 106 parasites as a preliminary search
for the vertebrate host of the parasite; however, no parasites were observed in peripheral blood 3 weeks after the
inoculation. The possibility of mammalian hosts was
also addressed since the frog trypanosome, T. rotatorium, has been reported to infect mice under experimental conditions [17]. The flagellate was inoculated
intracutaneously into BALB/c mice and Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus), but its DNA was not
detected in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues by
PCR after 6 weeks. Based on the findings obtained by
phylogenetic analyses and experimental infection, the
parasite is presumably infectious to certain species of
reptiles or amphibians in Pakistan. Further study is
needed to identify the vertebrate host of the parasite
species. The procedures were performed according to
the recommendations of the ethics committee for animal experimentation, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi
University.
In the present study, a Trypanosoma species was isolated from P. kazeruni, which is a xerophilic species distributing broadly throughout North Africa and West
Asia with little-known behavior [18-20], and the parasite
was genetically characterized. To date, trypanosomes in

sand flies have been reported on the African and American continents [5-11], but this is the first record of phlebotomine sand flies naturally infected by a Trypanosoma
species in Asia. Pakistan is a tropical and subtropical
country located in the northwest of South Asia and has
areas where leishmaniasis is highly endemic [21,22].
Although information on the endemicity and spread of
cutaneous leishmaniasis is accumulating [23-26], the
sand fly species responsible for the transmission is
poorly understood. To date, no natural infections of
sand flies by flagellates have been reported in Pakistan,
and further efforts are ongoing on this matter. Thus,
careful identification of the parasites is required for the
epidemiological study of sand fly species responsible for
the transmission of Leishmania protozoa.
