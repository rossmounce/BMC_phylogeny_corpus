Host shifts and molecular evolution of H7 avian
influenza virus hemagglutinin
Camille Lebarbenchon* and David E Stallknecht

Abstract
Evolutionary consequences of host shifts represent a challenge to identify the mechanisms involved in the
emergence of influenza A (IA) viruses. In this study we focused on the evolutionary history of H7 IA virus in wild
and domestic birds, with a particular emphasis on host shifts consequences on the molecular evolution of the
hemagglutinin (HA) gene. Based on a dataset of 414 HA nucleotide sequences, we performed an extensive
phylogeographic analysis in order to identify the overall genetic structure of H7 IA viruses. We then identified host
shift events and investigated viral population dynamics in wild and domestic birds, independently. Finally, we
estimated changes in nucleotide substitution rates and tested for positive selection in the HA gene. A strong
association between the geographic origin and the genetic structure was observed, with four main clades
including viruses isolated in North America, South America, Australia and Eurasia-Africa. We identified ten potential
events of virus introduction from wild to domestic birds, but little evidence for spillover of viruses from poultry to
wild waterbirds. Several sites involved in host specificity (addition of a glycosylation site in the receptor binding
domain) and virulence (insertion of amino acids in the cleavage site) were found to be positively selected in HA
nucleotide sequences, in genetically unrelated lineages, suggesting parallel evolution for the HA gene of IA viruses
in domestic birds. These results highlight that evolutionary consequences of bird host shifts would need to be
further studied to understand the ecological and molecular mechanisms involved in the emergence of domestic
bird-adapted viruses.

Background
Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies
has focused on the effects of human activities on pathogen evolution [1,2]. Historically, agriculture and domestication of wild animals have been linked to the
emergence of several human pathogens. Ecological
changes related to modern agricultural practices also are
likely to affect emergence of both human and animal
diseases [3,4]. Influenza A (IA) virus provides a good
example of a pathogen that can move from wild bird
reservoir to domestic animal systems and adapt to
humans and other mammals. These viruses have
invaded, and in some cases have become established in
a diversity of agrosystems, ranging from integrated riceduck farming [5], to live poultry markets [6] and

Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, The University of Georgia, Athens,

industrial and intensive farming systems [7,8]. The
emergence and long-term circulation of the highly
pathogenic (HP) H5N1 virus in domestic birds in Southeastern Asia [9,10], as well as the recent emergence of
the swine-origin H1N1 virus in humans [11,12], highlights the ability of IA viruses to spread beyond species
barriers and adapt rapidly to new host and environmental conditions [13].
Wild waterbirds in the orders Anseriformes (ducks,
geese and swans) and Charadriiformes (gulls, terns and
waders) are recognized to be natural hosts for low
pathogenic (LP) IA viruses [14]. In these two avian
orders, a large diversity of IA subtypes have been
described, based on genetic and antigenic characteristics
of the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA)
proteins. In wild waterbirds, IA viruses do not cause significant disease but may have subtle physiological and
behavioral effects [15,16]. In ducks, ecological factors
affecting the prevalence of infection include host species,

age, behavior, population density, and persistence of
viruses in the environment.
In domestic birds (e.g. chickens, ducks, turkeys,
quails), IA viruses replicate in both the intestinal and
respiratory tracts, but in the case of HP H5 and H7
viruses, can result in multi-organ systemic infections
with high mortality [17,18]. Several HP IA virus outbreaks have been described and were responsible for
large economic losses for poultry producers [18]. With
the exception of the Asian strains of the HP H5N1, HP
viruses are rarely reported in wild waterbirds [19,20].
Genetic exchanges between viruses circulating in wild
and domestic birds have been documented, especially
when wild bird origin LP viruses infect poultry [21-23].
The regular spillover of Asian HP H5N1 viruses from
domestic to wild birds also demonstrate the potential
for reverse flow [24-26]. However, the time, location,
frequency, effect on the population genetic diversity,
and on the molecular evolution of IA viruses of such
genetic exchanges remain unclear. The evolutionary
consequences of these host and resulting environmental
shifts represent a challenge to understand the mechanisms involved in the emergence of IA viruses, in particular regarding molecular changes involved in the increase
of virulence and host specificity.
We focused on the evolutionary history of H7 IA
viruses circulating in wild and domestic birds. Compared to other HA subtypes, numerous H7 viruses have
been isolated from both wild waterbirds and poultry. In
domestic birds, H7 IA viruses have been responsible for
severe outbreaks sometimes with long-term circulation
of LP and HP viruses; in Italy [21,27-29], Germany [30],
the Netherlands [31], Australia [32,33], China [34], Pakistan [35], Canada [36,37], United States of America
(USA) [38,39] and Chile [40].
The aims of this study were: (i) to provide an overview
of subtype combinations, host diversity and phylogeographic structure of H7 IA virus isolated in wild and
domestic birds, worldwide; (ii) to investigate the population dynamic of H7 HA, with a particular emphasis on
virus emergence and extinction dates, genetic diversity
and exchanges between wild and domestic hosts; and
(iii) to estimate changes in nucleotide substitution rates
and test for positive selection in the HA gene. We discuss the consequences of host shifts on the population
dynamics of H7 IA viruses in wild and domestic birds
and the ecological and molecular mechanisms potentially involved in the emergence of domestic birdadapted viruses.

Methods
Sequence dataset

Complete nucleotide and protein sequences of the HA
gene were downloaded from the Influenza Sequence

Page 2 of 15

Database (ISD; [41]), on October 22, 2009. For each
sequence, the following information was collected:
accession number, strain name, subtype, geographic
origin (i.e., continent: Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa,
North America and South America), bird host species,
virulence (LP or HP) and year of virus collection. Host
status (domestic or wild) was determined based on
bird species or from the description of the isolate provided in reference papers. Sequences from viruses for
which host was not identified (e.g., ‘duck’ or ‘mallard’,
without any additional information concerning their
origin) were not included in the analyses. Duplicate
sequences (from the same strain) as well as sequences
previously identified as reflecting potential laboratory
errors [42] also were removed. When not available in
the ISD, virulence (LP or HP) of viruses was assigned
by comparing the HA amino acid sequence pattern of
the cleavage site with viruses previously characterized
as LP or HP. Differences in the frequency of subtype
combinations between wild and domestic birds were
investigated using a c 2 test implemented in the
R 2.10.1 software [43].
Phylogeographic analysis

The coding region of nucleotide sequences was aligned
with ClustalW 2.0.10 [44]. Four viruses representing two
different subtypes (H3N8 and H6N2) and geographic
origins (North America and Europe) were included to
root trees: A/Green-winged teal/Ohio/1289/2005
(H3N8), A/Mallard/Maryland/2022/2005 (H6N8), A/
Mallard/Finland/12072/06 (H3N8) and A/Bewick’s
swan/Netherlands/1/2005 (H6N2). Phylogenetic trees
were constructed by maximum likelihood with the software PhyML 3.0 [45]. The evolutionary model was
selected by Model Generator 0.85 [46]. Nodal supports
were assessed with 100 bootstrap replicates.
Population dynamics

Viral population dynamics were investigated with a
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo coalescent
approach, implemented in the program BEAST 1.5.3
[47]. Time of the most recent common ancestor
(TMRCA) as well as rates of nucleotide substitution
were obtained from analyses performed with BEAST.
The Shapiro-Rambaut-Drummond-2006 (SRD06)
nucleotide substitution model was used in all simulations as this model is recognized to provide better resolution for coding regions [48], and has recently been
used in population dynamic studies of other IA subtypes
[49,50].
We focused on the viral population dynamics of two
main genetic lineages identified by the phylogeographic
analysis (cf. results section): (i) the North AmericanSouth American lineage (NA-SA) and (ii) the Eurasian-

Lebarbenchon and Stallknecht Virology Journal 2011, 8:328

African-Australian lineage (EURAS-AF-AU). Three
molecular clock models were tested for each genetic
lineage. The strict clock (SC) that assumes a single evolutionary rate in the phylogenetic trees, and two relaxed
clocks: the uncorrelated exponential (UE) and the
uncorrelated lognormal (UL), which allow evolutionary
rates to vary along branches, within an exponential or
lognormal distribution [51]. Molecular clock models
were evaluated and tested with the Bayes Factor (BF)
[52,53] implemented in the program TRACER 1.5.0
[47,54]. The ratio of marginal likelihoods were compared between models and BF significance was determined from the values of 2ln(BF), as described by
Brandley et al. [55]. A Bayesian skyline coalescent tree
prior was used in all simulations as it makes the fewest
a priori assumptions about the data [56] and has been
shown to be more appropriate to describe the population dynamics of IA virus [57]. Analyses were performed
(i.e. with SC, UE and UL molecular clocks) for each
genetic lineage, with a chain length of 120 million generations sampled every 1 000 iterations. Results were
analyzed with TRACER: for each simulation, the first 510% trees were discarded as burn-in and an effective
sample size superior to 200 was obtained to ensure adequate sample size for the posterior, prior, likelihood,
mean rate of nucleotide substitution (clock rate for SC),
and skyline. Phylogenetic consensus trees were produced
using the program TREEANNOTATOR 1.5.3 and edited
for generation of figure captions with the program
FigTree 1.3.1.
We also performed independent analyses including
only viruses isolated in wild or domestic birds for each
genetic lineages (NA-SA and EURAS-AF-AU) and for
the main genetic sub-lineages (we limited the analysis to
groups including more than ten sequences obtained
from viruses isolated over a time period of at least a
three years). Analyses were carried out with a Bayesian
skyline coalescent tree prior and a UE molecular clock
(most appropriate according to the results of the previous analysis).
Molecular evolution of the HA gene

Signatures of selection in the HA nucleotide sequences
were evaluated using the codon-based approach as
implemented in HyPhy [58], available at the Datamonkey webserver [59,60]. Estimations of the dN (nonsynonymous substitutions) and dS (synonymous substitutions)
were obtained with the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effects likelihood (FEL) and random
effects likelihood (REL) methods [61]. Analyses were
conducted under the HKY85 nucleotide substitution
model, with a statistical significance set to p = 0.05.
Finally, in order to identify the potential function of
positively selected amino acids, we located N-linked

glycosylation sites in the HA protein sequences using

Results
Dataset

Among the 508 sequences downloaded from the ISD, 94
(18.5%) were excluded from the analysis because: (i)
they represented duplicate sequences of the same virus
(N = 21), (ii) they were previously identified as potential
laboratory errors (N = 3; [42]) or (iii) information concerning the bird species and/or its status (domestic or
wild) was not available (N = 70).
The overall proportions of viruses isolated from
domestic and wild birds were 84% and 16%, respectively.
The most represented bird species was chicken (53%)
for domestic birds and Mallard (41%) for wild birds
(Additional file 1: Figure S1). Ninety percent of isolated
viruses came from North American and European birds
(Additional file 2: Table S1). Subtype combinations with
the NA were significantly different between domestic
and wild birds (c2 = 71.6, df = 6, p <0.001, excluding
N6 and N8; cf. Additional file 3: Figure S2 for details).
For wild birds, H7N3 and H7N7 were the most represented subtypes (49% and 35% respectively), while in
domestic birds H7N2 was mainly represented (52%),
with H7N3 (20%) and H7N1 (19%). Seventy-six viruses
were HP (18%); all of them were isolated from domestic
birds (Additional file 2: Table S1).
Phylogeographic structure

A strong association between the geographic origin and
genetic structure was observed, with four main clades
including viruses isolated in (i) North America, (ii)
South America, (iii) Australia and (iv) Europe, Asia and
Africa (Figure 1 and Additional file 4: Figure S3). The
two latter groups were less supported by bootstrap
values; however, they were excluded from a ‘superclade’
including all American viruses (North and South America; Additional file 4: Figure S3). Several sub-groups
were observed in each geographic clades, including
viruses isolated in the same location or time period
(Additional file 4: Figure S3 for details). Most of these
clades have previously been identified in studies that
focused on a limited number of viruses, responsible for
outbreaks in poultry, locally. Finally, we observed that
HP H7 viruses isolated in domestic birds in EurasiaAfrica, Australia, North and South America formed
unrelated genetic lineages.
Evolutionary history

The North American-South American (NA-SA) and the
Eurasian-African-Australian (EURAS-AF-AU) lineages
were analyzed independently, because of their strong
genetic divergence as well as for computational reasons.

Figure 1 Maximum likelihood consensus tree derived from 414 H7 HA nucleotide sequences. Computations were realized with the GTR+I
+Г evolutionary model and 100 bootstrap replications (I = 0.27; a = 0.85). Tip colors represent the geographic origin of viruses: dark blue:
Europe; light blue: Australia; green: Asia; yellow: Africa; purple: South America; orange: North America. Internal branches were also colored for
monophyletic groups (i.e., same continent). Tips were annotated with red stars for HP viruses. A detailed phylogenetic tree including virus strain
names is available in Figure S3.

For both lineages, the UE molecular clock model was
significantly better than the SC and UL models, concordant with other studies [49,50]. Based on the maximum
clade credibility tree topologies, we identified at least 14
potential events of host shift (Figures 2 &3 and Additional file 5 &6: Figures S4 & S5 - events A to N). Ten
of these corresponded to viruses that circulated in
domestic birds and shared a common ancestor with a
virus isolated from wild birds prior to the detection in
domestic birds (i.e. introduction from wild to domestic
birds; Additional file 7: Table S2). The direction of virus
introduction (i.e. wild-to-domestic or domestic-to-wild)
for the four other host shift events (A, B, K and L; Figures 2 &3 and Additional file 5 &6: Figures S4 & S5)

couldn’t be determined because of the limited number
of sequences available (3 to 6), sometimes over extended
time periods (2 to 13 years).
The EURAS-AF-AU lineage was structured into ten
major genetic sub-lineages, strongly supported by posterior probability values (Figure 2 and Additional file 5:
Figure S4). The Australian H7 viruses were clearly differentiated from Eurasian-African viruses and the time
of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) between
the two lineages was 1873 (95% HPD: [1811-1914]). The
TMRCA estimated for the Australian lineage was 1968
[1952-1975] with a circulation of HP viruses for more
than 29 years in domestic birds, and genetic reassortment with different NA subtypes.

The Eurasian-African (EURAS-AF) genetic lineage was
divided into 9 major clades including viruses isolated in
different geographical locations and time period (Figure
2 and Additional file 5: Figure S4). The presence of a
sub-lineage including viruses isolated between 1927 and
1945 suggested an ancient circulation of genetically differentiated HP H7 IA virus in domestic birds in Europe
and Africa. These viruses did not shown genetic relatedness with modern HP H7 IA viruses and could have circulated in domestic birds for 21 to 48 years in Europe
and Africa (TMRCA: 1912 [1897-1924]). The existence
of such an ancient lineage of H7 HA viruses has been
suggested by other studies; however, our results demonstrate that they are included in the EURAS-AF genetic
lineage and are not at the basis of the EURAS-AF-AU
lineage, as previously suggested (e.g. [62]).
A lineage including LP and HP viruses isolated in
England and Germany, between 1977 and 1982, could
have emerged in domestic birds in 1972-1973 (TMRCA:
1973 [1969-1976]). This lineage is probably extinct as
no genetically related H7 HA viruses have been detected
after 1982. In addition, the genetic structure of this
clade supports the circulation of two sub-lineages of LP
H7 in England, one at the origin of the HP H7N7 outbreak in domestic birds in Germany in 1979 (A/Turkey/
England/647/1977) as previously reported by Banks
et al. [62].
A distinct clade of HP H7N3 viruses was evidenced
with domestic birds in Pakistan, with a co-circulation of
two genetically different sub-lineages. According to the
TMRCA of this clade (1993 [1991-1995]), HP H7
viruses could have circulated for 11 years in domestic
birds. These viruses were genetically unrelated to other
HP H7 viruses circulating during the same time period
in Europe (Italy, Germany and the Netherlands), suggesting an independent emergence and circulation, as
recently proposed by Abbas et al. [35].
Two unrelated lineages were observed in Italy, in
domestic birds. The first one included both LP and HP
H7N1 viruses that circulated between 1999 and 2001,
with a strong clustering of HP viruses (TMRCA: 1997
[1996-1998]). The second one included only LP H7N3
viruses isolated between 2002 and 2007 (TMRCA: 2001
[2001-2002]). Our analysis also supported the introduction of LP H7N3 from wild birds to domestic poultry in
Italy (host shift H; cf. [21] for complete description).
A paraphyletic group including H7 IA viruses isolated
from wild birds, in Sweden and the Netherlands was
also observed (TMRCA: 1999 [1999-2000]). A genetic
clade including HP viruses isolated from domestic birds
was branched within this group (TMRCA: 2002 [20022003]). As reported by Munster et al. [22], the HA of
A/Mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 was genetically related
to the four HP H7 HA from domestic birds in the

Page 7 of 15

Netherlands and Germany in 2003 (Additional file 5:
Figure S4), suggesting that this HP H7 outbreak could
have arisen from the circulation of LP H7 IA viruses in
wild waterbirds (host shift D).
We revealed the existence of a genetic lineage recently
isolated from both wild and domestic birds in Europe.
Two sub-lineages were identified and provided evidence
of virus transmissions from wild to domestic birds (host
shifts E, F and G). For both sub-lineages (including: A/
Mallard/Italy/299/2005 and A/Mute swan/Hungary/
5973/2007; cf. Additional file 5: Figure S4 for details)
the TMRCA was 2004 [2003-2005].
In Asia (China and Japan), we identified a clade that
includes viruses isolated from wild and domestic birds.
This result suggested a regional circulation of genetically
differentiated H7 viruses, with a likely host shift from
wild to domestic birds (host shift B). The TMRCA of
this clade (1998 [1997-1999]), together with the detection of viruses in domestic birds in 2003, suggest that
this genetic sub-lineage could have circulated in domestic birds in China for five years.
Finally, we highlighted the existence of two ‘atypical’
genetic clades. The first included H7N1 IA viruses isolated in caged birds in Asia and Europe, between 1994
and 1995 (Figure 2 and Additional file 5: Figure S4).
The geographical origin of these genetically related
viruses highlights the potential for rapid spread of H7
IA viruses due to illegal caged bird trade (cf. [62] for
discussion). The second clade included two viruses: A/
Parrot/Northern Ireland/VF7367/1973 and A/Chicken/
Chakwal/NARC-35/2001 (Additional file 5: Figure S4).
The isolation of these viruses from distant geographic
areas (Northern Ireland and Pakistan) and over a 28
years period, could support a long term circulation of
an undetected H7 lineage in domestic birds, in Eurasia
(cf. [35] for discussion). However, given the extremely
high level of identities between the two HA sequences
(99% homology) they probably reflect laboratory errors
(cf. [42] for discussion).
Temporal changes in genetic diversity were plotted
independently for viruses isolated in wild and domestic
birds, with a Bayesian Skyline reconstruction (Figure 4).
Although not significant, the recent co-circulation of
several genetically different lineages in wild birds was
illustrated by a slight increase in the relative genetic
diversity in 2001 and after 2004 (Figure 4A). After introduction in domestic birds, no significant changes in the
relative genetic diversity were observed (Figure 4C, 4D,
4E, 4F) although these patterns may reflect the low
number of sequences available for certain genetic
lineages (e.g. Australia).
The NA-SA genetic lineage was also structured into
sub-lineages (Figure 3 and Additional file 6: Figure S5).
Viruses isolated from North and South America were

strongly differentiated (TMRCA: 1954 [1928-1969]). The
TMRCA of the South American sub-lineage was 1999
[1997-2001] and included a LP H7N3 virus isolated in a
wild bird (A/Cinnamon Teal/Bolivia/4537/2001), presumably at the origin of the circulation of LP and HP
H7N3 viruses detected in domestic birds in Chile during
the following year (host shift I; cf. [40] for discussion).

The North American lineage was divided into three
major sub-lineages. An ancient sub-lineage included
viruses isolated from wild and domestic birds, between
1980 and 1993. Based on the TMRCA (1979 [19771980]), this genetic sub-lineage circulated for at least 14
years in the USA and Canada. Several host shifts would
have occurred (K), however the direction of virus

introductions (i.e. wild-to-domestic or domestic-to-wild)
remains to be determined.
A second genetic sub-lineage included LP H7 IA
viruses isolated from wild and domestic birds in North
America, between 2001 and 2008. Two genetic groups
were observed and suggested the co-circulation of
genetically different H7 IA viruses in wild waterbirds
between 2005 and 2006 (TMRCA: 2005 [2005-2006] for
both clades, including A/Ruddy Turnstone/Delaware/
752/2006 and A/Blue-winged Teal/Ohio/566/2006,
respectively; Figure S5). Genetically related viruses isolated in domestic birds suggested two host shifts (M and
N; Figure 3, Additional file 6: Figure S5 and Additional
file 7: Table S2), with a rapid evolution toward an
increased virulence (cf. [37,63] for discussion).
We underlined the long-term circulation of H7 HA
in domestic birds in the USA and dated the emergence
of this sub-lineage in 1992-1993 (TMRCA: 1993 [19891994]). These viruses would have circulated for 13
years in domestic birds with co-circulation of genetically different viruses at the same time and location
(e.g. in Chicken in New-York in 2005; Additional
file 6: Figure S5).
In wild birds, temporal changes in the relative genetic
diversity showed an important decrease after 2000, and
a recent peak in 2006 (Figure 4B). In the USA, after
introduction in domestic birds, important fluctuations
were observed from 1992 onward with peaks of diversity
reached every 2-3 years (Figure 4G), although these
changes were not significant.

Molecular evolution

Mean nucleotide substitution rates were calculated for
viruses isolated in wild and domestic birds, separately,
for each major genetic lineage (NA-SA and EURAS-AFAU) and sub-lineages (Table 1). Overall, high rates of
substitutions were obtained, ranging from 0.37 × 10-3 to
11.74 × 10-3 substitution/site/years. Higher rates were
obtained for viruses circulating in wild birds than for
those isolated from domestic birds. Differences were
also obtained in domestic birds between genetic
lineages.
We tested evidence of positive or negative selection
for the same genetic lineages (Table 1). For viruses
isolated in wild birds, a strong evidence of purifying
selection was found with low mean d N /d S ratio and
numerous negatively selected sites. When all viruses isolated from domestic birds were considered, for each
geographic lineage (EURAS-AF-AU and NA-SA), strong
evidence of purifying selection also was found (i.e. sites
under negative selection); however several sites were
detected to be under positive selection. When analyzing
the main genetic sub-lineages independently (Table 1),
high dN/dS ratios were also found, with a lower number
of sites under negative selection and evidence for positive selection for several amino acids.
The majority of positively selected sites were located
in the HA1 coding region of the HA (position 1 to 339,
H7 HA numbering; Table 1). Only two amino acids, at
positions 340 and 341, were located outside the HA1
coding region, in the cleavage site of the protein. We

determined the N-linked glycosylation sites in the HA
protein for viruses isolated in wild birds. Three sites
were identified (position 30, 46 and 249) in the HA1
coding region, for 100% of the sequences analyzed.
Among the positively selected sites in domestic birds,
we found that the amino acid mutation at position 143
(from Ala, Val or Lys, to Thr) led to the generation of a
fourth sequon (140-Asn-Gly-Thr-144) in the HA1 coding
region. In wild birds, only one of the 68 sequences
analyzed showed the presence of this fourth sequon
(A/Northern shoveler/California/HKWF1026/2007). For
domestic bird viruses, there were also evidence of positive selection for amino acid changes leading to the
removal of a highly conserved sequon, at position 46
(45-Asn-Ala-Thr-49 to 45-Asp-Ala-Thr-49). This observation needs to be confirmed as only one of the three
methods detected evidence of positive selection and the
analysis was based on a low number of sequences
(Table 1). The consequence of amino acid mutation at
other sites under positive selection is not clear, although
most were located in, or at the edge of, the receptor
binding domain of the HA protein (positions 139, 148,
150 and 152).

Discussion
In this study, we provided an extensive phylogenetic
analysis of 414 H7 IA viruses that have been isolated
worldwide in wild and domestic birds, and investigated
the consequences of host shifts on the molecular evolution of the HA gene. First, we underlined that precise
information related to host is critical. The lack of accuracy related to the species or ‘host status’ (domestic or
wild) in public sequence databases limits our ability to
effectively study host shifts and their consequences on
viral evolution. We indeed excluded 14% of the
sequences composing the initial dataset because of missing or unclear information related to the bird species or
status. In the context of increasing isolations of IA virus
and availability of sequences, this issue needs immediate
attention.
Evolutionary history of H7 IA virus in wild birds

The overall phylogenetic structure of H7 HA was concordant with results reported in previous studies, based
on a limited number of sequences (e.g. [62]): a clear
phylogeographic pattern was evidenced with distinct
genetic lineages in the Eastern and Western hemispheres. High divergence was observed, in particular for
the Australian and South American clades, but also at a
smaller spatial scale for viruses responsible for outbreaks
in domestic birds. Genetic exchanges between biogeographical regions have been documented for IA viruses,
especially between North America and Europe, and
North America and Asia (e.g. [64]). These exchanges are

Page 10 of 15

likely to be favored by habitat sharing in breeding areas
between waterbirds using different migratory flyways,
and can have important consequences on the population
dynamics of IA viruses in wild birds, such as the replacement of endemic genetic lineages [50]. For H7 IA
viruses, the strong phylogeographic structure supports
that no intercontinental exchanges resulting in the
replacement of an endemic lineage have occurred
recently between Eurasia and the Americas.
Regular emergence and co-circulation of genetically
different H7 IA virus lineages were identified in wild
waterbird populations. In Eurasia, the circulation of four
lineages between 1999 and 2001 was followed by a slight
decrease in the genetic diversity and the emergence of a
new and diversified lineage since 2004-2005. In North
America, one dominant lineage has circulated since
2006. Rapid genetic diversification and extinction processes seem to occur for H7 IA viruses, concordant with
surveillance studies that have related strong temporal
differences of H7 subtype prevalence in waterbird populations in both Europe and North America [65,66].
Along with previous studies, we suggest that population
immunity could play an important role for these epidemiological fluctuations and be responsible for rapid
changes in the relative genetic diversity of H7 IA viruses
in wild waterbirds [65,67].
Virus spillover to wild birds has been documented
many times in association with the circulation of the HP
H5N1 IA viruses in Southeastern Asia [24-26]. Introduction of HP viruses from domestic to peri-domestic and
wild bird species often occurs in areas where the circulation of these viruses is endemic in domestic birds, and
has been suggested as a mechanism of perpetuation of
HP IA during and potentially between outbreaks [68,69].
This hypothesis however lacks epidemiological evidence,
especially when considering the potential role of domestic ducks as reservoir for HP IA viruses [70,71]. After
spillover to wild waterbirds, HP IA virus spread has
been shown to be limited in space and time and dependent on various host and environmental factors, such as
distance traveled between migratory stopovers, population density, air temperature or virus persistence in
aquatic habitats [72-76].
For H7 IA viruses (both LP and HP), we did not
detected domestic-to-wild bird transmission with longterm circulation of the introduced virus in wild waterbird populations. Although this could be related to the
relatively low number of sequences available from wild
birds, this could also reflect adaptations to domestic
hosts that result in reduce fitness after spillover in wild
waterbird populations [77]. Such hypothesis has been
proposed to explain the absence of long-term circulation
of HP viruses in wild waterbird populations [78] and
could be extended to LP IA viruses that had undergone

Lebarbenchon and Stallknecht Virology Journal 2011, 8:328
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/328

significant adaptations to domestic hosts and
environments, precluding persistence in the wild when a
spillover occurs.
Host shifts and population dynamics in domestic birds

Wild-to-domestic bird transmission has been previously
documented and includes the detection of LP ancestral
virus of the Asian HP H5N1 viruses [23]. In the present
study, ten independent host shifts (wild-to-domestic
birds) were detected for H7 IA viruses. Local circulation
of a LP H7 viruses in wild waterbirds has been shown
to occurs prior to the introduction in poultry (e.g.
[21,37]). Wallensten et al. also suggested that the
increase LP H7 virus prevalence in waterbirds could
favor introduction in poultry and affect the risk for
emergence of HP strains [66]. In this study, we observed
a slight increase of the genetic diversity of viruses
circulating in wild waterbirds in Europe since 20042005, followed by three independent introductions in
domestic birds. Interactions between IA virus prevalence
in wild waterbirds, changes in the genetic diversity of
viral populations and introduction in domestic birds
need to be further studied; such information could provide a basis to estimate the risks of emergence of IA
virus in poultry. In addition, local surveillance of LP H7
viruses in wild waterbirds has the potential to provide
critical information for the development of efficient vaccines protecting poultry against the emergence of highly
pathogenic viruses, as proposed by Sakabe et al. [79].
Highly pathogenic H7 IA viruses have circulated for
extended periods of time in domestic birds in Pakistan
and Australia. In Australia, there was evidence of
genetic reassortment, in particular with different NA
subtypes [32,33]. Because of the very low number of
isolates available in this long time period, it is not possible to determine if the H7 HA genetic lineage represents
an endemic circulation of virulent viruses or is the result
of multiple introductions of LP viruses that evolved into
HP forms.
In Pakistan, HP H7 IA viruses have also circulated for
an extended period of time, as the result of poor vaccination or eradication strategies before 2002-2003 [35].
The emergence of these viruses have occurred after
1993 with a co-circulation of two or three major genetic
sub-lineages. In addition, H9N2 IA virus also have been
detected in poultry infected with HP H7N3 virus with
evidence of genetic reassortment between the two
viruses [35]. Such a pattern of emergence of HP viruses,
with the co-circulation of several genetic lineages and
reassortments with other circulating LP viruses (in particular H9N2) is similar to the one observed for HP
H5N1 in Southeastern Asia [23,49,80,81].
In live bird markets in the USA, rapid changes in the
relative genetic diversity have occurred, with peaks of

Page 11 of 15

diversity reached every 2-3 years, suggesting diversification and extinction processes for different sub-lineages
of H7 HA. These changes could have been driven by
eradication procedures that were initiated to control the
outbreak. The case of the H5N2 outbreak in poultry in
Mexico, with the diversification and co-circulation of
multiple genetic sub-lineages after vaccination, has
shown that control and eradication procedures can act
as a strong selective pressure for IA evolution [82]. In
the USA, the H7 IA virus genetic diversity has also been
maintained by genetic reassortments with the NA and
NS (nonstructural) gene segments of other IA viruses
circulating in live bird markets [38,39]. Finally, no case
of HP viruses were detected in this genetic lineage,
although evidence of mutations at the cleavage sites
were described [39], contrasting with the rapid evolution
toward an increased virulence that was observed in Italy,
Australia, Pakistan and Canada.
Emergence of domestic bird-adapted IA viruses

Influenza A viruses exhibit high rates of nucleotide substitutions allowing continuous antigenic changes, favoring escape from population immunity [49,50,83]. In this
study, we highlighted that differences in this rate can be
obtained when viruses isolated from wild and domestic
birds are analyzed separately. Overall, we found higher
rates for viruses circulating in wild birds than in domestic birds, however, important differences were observed
between genetic lineages in domestic birds (from 0.37
x10 -3 to 5.59 x10 -3 substitution/site/year). Previous
works has suggested that after introduction in poultry
the rate of nucleotide substitution could increases significantly (e.g. for H5 HA; [84]). For H7 HA, the opposite
trend was observed but we speculate that this rate is
highly variable in poultry, most likely depending on the
selective pressures from the domestic environment. In
wild waterbirds, naturally acquired immunity has a
strong importance on IA virus evolution, favoring continuous antigenic changes. In domestic bird populations,
rates of nucleotide substitutions could be strongly
affected by immunity acquired through vaccination. This
would explain the differences observed between outbreaks where no vaccination was performed for several
years (e.g. Pakistan) as compared to the ones where
intensive control strategies were developed (e.g. USA,
Italy), although such trend would needs further investigations to be validated.
During the last century, at least 11 unrelated genetic
lineages of HP H7 IA virus would have circulated in
domestic birds. As for H5 IA viruses, evolution from LP
to HP viruses arose at several occasions, independently
[85]. The amino acid sequences of the H7 HA cleavage
site is highly polymorphic between genetic lineages. For
instance, evidence of recombination between the HA

Lebarbenchon and Stallknecht Virology Journal 2011, 8:328
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/328

and the NP genes has been shown to be at the origin of
the nucleotide insertion in the cleavage site for the Chilean outbreak [86]. In addition to these reports from
outbreaks in poultry, experimental infections with different HP H7 strains have confirmed that different amino
acid sequences in the cleavage site can lead to similar
levels of virulence [30,68,87,88]. Amino acid insertion in
the H7 HA cleavage site could therefore be selected for
but with little evidence for a specific sequence motif, as
the resulting increase in virulence is likely to increase
viral fitness compared to wild-bird origin LP viruses.
The absence of detection of HP viruses in H7 genetic
lineages that circulated for extended periods of time (e.
g. in the USA between 1994 and 2006) however suggests
that high virulence is not likely to be selected for under
all type of bird production systems, and may not always
represents an optimum for viral fitness.
As reported by previous studies [49,50,83], the low
mean dN/dS ratios and the detection of numerous negatively selected sites supports that the H7 HA is under
strong purifying selection. For viruses circulating in
domestic birds, we found several sites under positive
selection, most of them located in the receptor binding
domain. In particular, the amino acid mutation at position 143 (135 in H3 numbering; [89]) led to the generation of an additional N-linked glycosylation site in the
HA1 coding region. N-linked glycosylation sites are
recognized to be involved in host cell entry, proteolytic
processing and protein trafficking [90]. The amino acid
mutation at position 143 was positively selected in three
unrelated genetic lineages (USA, Pakistan and Italy during the 1999-2001 outbreak). In addition, a previous
study also reported the acquisition of this glycosylation
site in unconnected farms in Italy and suggested that
strong selective pressure in poultry could favor the
simultaneous and rapid acquisition of this amino acid
mutation in separate genetic lineages [27]. The location
of this amino acid mutation, at the right edge of the
receptor binding domain of the HA protein [91], suggests an importance for host infection and provides evidence of selection for increased host specificity in
domestic birds. In addition, it has been shown that
important amino acid mutations in the receptor-binding
site can be fully functional [92], supporting that such
structural modifications in the HA protein can potentially increase IA viral fitness in domestic birds. Positive
selection for amino acid changes in genetically unrelated
lineages supports evidence of parallel evolution in the
HA gene of IA viruses in domestic birds. This is likely
to result from host shifts and broadly to be a response
to the new selective pressures composing domestic bird
production systems (e.g. host density, host genetic diversity, population immunity, environmental transmission),
and underlines the need to consider host ecology as well

Page 12 of 15

as the consequences of ecosystem shifts in IA virus
evolution.
