Abstract
Background: Mutations in HERG and KCNQ1 potassium channels have been associated with
Long QT syndrome and atrial fibrillation, and more recently with sudden infant death syndrome
and sudden unexplained death. In other proteins, disease-associated amino acid mutations have
been analyzed according to the chemical severity of the changes and the locations of the altered
amino acids according to their conservation over metazoan evolution. Here, we present the first
such analysis of arrhythmia-associated mutations (AAMs) in the HERG and KCNQ1 potassium
channels.
Results: Using evolutionary analyses, AAMs in HERG and KCNQ1 were preferentially found at
evolutionarily conserved sites and unevenly distributed among functionally conserved domains.
Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are under-represented at
evolutionarily conserved sites in HERG, but distribute randomly in KCNQ1. AAMs are chemically
more severe, according to Grantham's Scale, than changes observed in evolution and their severity
correlates with the expected chemical severity of the involved codon. Expected chemical severity
of a given amino acid also correlates with its relative contribution to arrhythmias. At evolutionarily
variable sites, the chemical severity of the changes is also correlated with the expected chemical
severity of the involved codon.
Conclusion: Unlike nsSNPs, AAMs preferentially locate to evolutionarily conserved, and
functionally important, sites and regions within HERG and KCNQ1, and are chemically more
severe than changes which occur in evolution. Expected chemical severity may contribute to the
overrepresentation of certain residues in AAMs, as well as to evolutionary change.

Background
Two voltage-gated potassium ion channel genes, KCNQ1
and KCNH2 (HERG), encode for channels that underlie
the slowly- and rapidly-activated delayed rectifier potassium currents (IKs and IKr), respectively [1-4]. Efflux of
potassium ions through these channels is critical for repo-

larization of the cardiac action potential. Mutations that
disrupt normal biosynthesis and function of KCNQ1 and
HERG have been associated with three cardiac arrhythmias: Short QT syndrome (SQTS) [5-7], atrial fibrillation
[8,9] and Long QT syndrome (LQTS) [10,11]. To date,
there are close to 200 reported arrhythmia-associated

mutations (AAMs) in each channel, with more than 95%
of which are linked to LQTS. This arrhythmia, which
affects an estimated 1 in 5000–10000 people worldwide,
is characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval on an
electrocardiogram and can lead to Torsade de Pointes
(TdP), ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death
[12,13]. More recently, the progression from LQTS into
TdP has been proposed as a cause of sudden infant death
syndrome (SIDS) [14-16] and sudden unexplained death
syndrome (SUDS) [17]. Ninety percent of all known
LQTS-associated mutations occur in HERG and KCNQ1.
In studies of larger groups of proteins, or individual proteins other than HERG and KCNQ1, disease-associated
amino acid mutations (DAMs) have been analyzed
according to the chemical severity of the change, as determined from Grantham's Scale [18], and the location and/
or context of the altered amino acid [19]. An up to twofold increase in clinically observable disease occurs in parallel with increases in the amount of chemical change
[20]. In many proteins, DAMs are chemically more severe
than changes over the course of evolution (called interspecific changes) and polymorphic changes [21,22]. In rhodopsin, the chemical severity of DAMs also correlates with
the expected chemical severity of a given codon [21], as
determined by comparison with the normally occurring
human codon.
The importance of an amino acid to protein function can
be inferred from its conservation over the course of metazoan evolution. In many proteins, DAMs are overabundant at evolutionarily conserved and slowly evolving sites
[21-24], presumably because sites that have experienced
little interspecific variation are critical for function. Mutations at these sites are likely deleterious and would be
removed from the population by natural selection, if
given enough time. In some proteins, DAMs are unevenly
distributed among functionally conserved domains [25],
even after accounting for the length and number of evolutionarily conserved amino acids. These data imply that
functionally conserved domains, like conserved sites, are
less tolerant to mutations because of their greater importance to the overall protein function. However, according
to the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, most nucleotide substitutions are phenotypically neutral and avoid
natural selection [26]. Most nucleotide changes, except for
disease-associated changes, might then be expected to distribute randomly throughout a protein. In a study of a
large number of proteins, synonymous single nucleotide
polymorphisms (sSNPs) were shown to distribute randomly consistent with a neutral phenotype [23]. Initial
studies of non-synonymous (ns) SNPs in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 gene, were also shown to distribute randomly [22].
However, a more recent, study, using many proteins,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/188

showed that nsSNPs preferentially locate at variable sites
and sites with high evolutionary rates, and are underrepresented at sites that are evolutionarily conserved and
have low evolutionary rates [23]. This discrepancy may be
due to differences in the nature of the nsSNPs available
e.g. ns SNPs are less disruptive when located at conserved
sites in some proteins versus others, or to a difference in
the nature of the conserved sites e.g. conserved sites in
some proteins are less tolerant to amino acid changes.
In this study, we take advantage of the > 200 mutations
reported per channel to quantitatively analyze, for the first
time, the distribution of AAMs and non-synonymous
SNPs within HERG and KCNQ1 and to determine the
chemical severity of these changes, as compared to interspecific changes.

Methods
Sequence alignment
Human protein and mRNA sequences for HERG and
KCNQ1 were obtained from NCBI. Other vertebrate
sequences were collected from a BLASTP [27] search at
ENSEMBL (default parameters) and the NCBI non-redundant database. To eliminate the inclusion of sequences
from closely related paralogs, a manual reciprocal best-hit
analysis was used. Sequences were aligned by ClustalX
[28] using default settings. Less conserved regions in the N
and/or C-termini were removed, leaving sequences corresponding to residues 1–906 and 83–599 of human HERG
and human KCNQ1, respectively.
Collection of arrhythmia-associated mutations (AAMs)
and non-synonymous polymorphisms (nsSNPs)
HERG and KCNQ1 AAMs were obtained from the NCBI
OMIM database, the Human Gene Mutation Database
(HGMD), the European Society of Cardiology Working
Group on Arrhythmias (WGA) LQTS gene database [29]
and from primary literature [15,17,30-32]. Only missense
mutations that fell within the aligned region were used,
and each was included only once, to eliminate frequency
bias, but multiple disease mutations could be associated
with a single site. nsSNPs were collected from NCBI
dbSNP, HAPMAP international and primary literature
and were assumed to be phenotypically neutral based on
their inclusion in the different databases. nsSNPs that
overlapped with identified disease mutations were
removed. The final data set included 172 AAMs and 16
nsSNPs for HERG, and 174 AAMs (Table 1) and 12 nsSNPs for KCNQ1 (see Additional file 1).
Phylogenetic analysis and determination of interspecific
variability
Aligned protein sequences, with gaps removed, were used
to construct a phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood analysis in PHYLIP [33]. SEQBOOT, PROML, and

CONSENSE programs were used with a JTT model of evolution. Ancestral sequences were determined using the
maximum likelihood method from PAMLv3.15 [34]
under a Poisson model of amino acid evolution. Discrete
values for interspecific variability (0 through n) were
determined for each residue in the protein from differences between the ancestral and descendent sequences
throughout the provided tree.
Association between AAMs or nsSNPs and evolutionarily
conserved sites
To determine whether AAMs and nsSNPs are preferentially associated with evolutionarily conserved sites, we
compared the number of observed mutations in HERG
and KCNQ1 to the number of mutations expected at each
site in both proteins based on neutral substitution [22].
Sites were binned according to counts of interspecific variability (0 through i) which were determined using PAML.
The expected number of mutations was determined using
the following equation

Diexpected = Dtotal × Ni/N

(1)

X2 = Σ0i (Dobserved-Dexpected)2/Dexpected

(2)

Determination of codon evolutionary rate of change
The evolutionary rates of change for codons were estimated using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the CODEML program of PAML [34,23], using
a discrete gamma model (eight categories). The shape
parameter was either fixed or free to vary and a likelihood
ratio test was performed to evaluate model fitting. Evolutionary rates based on a Poisson model of evolution were
established for every site and normalized to the maximum
rate observed for each protein. Values between 0 and 1
were binned into eight different categories and used to
represent eight different levels of evolutionary change.
The analysis was performed on nucleotide sequence alignments of core regions, with gaps removed, of human and
three closely related vertebrate orthologs, guided by protein sequence alignments. The expected number of mutations at the codons belonging to each rate category was
calculated using a modification of Eq. 1 where Ni is the
number of codons belonging to i category, N is the total
number of amino acid positions, and Dtotal is the total
number of disease mutations for each protein used in the
analysis.
Distribution of AAMs among functionally important
regions of the channels
To quantify over- or underrepresentation of AAMs in functionally conserved regions of the channels, we compared
their distribution to that expected from a uniform or evolutionary hypothesis [25]. First, we tested whether AAMs
were distributed uniformly across the protein. The
expected number of mutations in a given region was
determined using the following equation

Djexpected = (Rj/R) × Dtotal

(3)

where Diexpected is the expected number of mutations at
sites that have undergone i substitutions, Dtotal is the total
number of disease mutations for each channel given by
ΣDiobserved, Ni is the observed number of sites in the alignment that have undergone i substitutions and N is the
total number of residues in the gene being examined.
Therefore, Ni/N is the fraction of sites in the gene that
belong to a particular variability class (i), and if disease
mutations distribute randomly throughout the protein,
then Diexpected will be proportional to the fraction of the
total sites and the total number of disease mutations
observed in each gene.

where Djexpected is the expected number of disease mutations in a particular region, j, Rj is the number of residues
found in region j, R is the total number of residues used in
the analysis (ΣRj) and Dtotal = ΣDjobserved or the total
number of disease mutations used in the analysis.

To determine whether differences in the distribution pattern between observed values and those expected from
neutral theory were significant, the X2 statistic was calculated [22] and compared to a critical value for the given
degrees of freedom (i-1) using the following equation,

Second, we tested whether the distribution of AAMs in different regions was related to the distribution of evolutionarily conserved sites. If AAMs are overrepresented at
conserved sites, the number of AAMs for a given region
will be proportional to the number of conserved sites

The X2 statistic was calculated and compared to a critical
value for the given degrees of freedom equal to j-1, where
j is the number of different regions in the channel being
analyzed, using the following equation,
X2 = Σj (Dobserved-Dexpected)2/Dexpected

found within that region. The expected number of mutations per region was determined using the following equation,
Djexpected = Σ0i ((aij/ai) × Diobserved)

(5)

where ai is the total number of sites in a protein belonging
to variability class i, aij is the number of sites of variability
class i found within the region j, and Diobserved is the total
number of disease mutations found at variability sites, i,
across the entire protein.
Chemical severity of amino acid changes
The interspecific chemical severity of a given site was
determined by the average severity (according to
Grantham's Scale [18]) of all ancestor-descendent amino
acid differences at that site throughout the tree, as
reported by PAML. Only those interspecific changes that
result from a single point mutation were included and
each type of amino acid change at a given site was counted
once to account for common ancestry [22]. The expected
chemical severity at each site in HERG and KCNQ1 was
determined by computing the average severity of all nonsynonymous changes produced by a single point mutation from the human reference codon [21].
Weighted average for amino acid expected chemical
severity
To examine the involvement of specific amino acid residues in disease, the proportion of AAMs at a particular
amino acid was calculated as percentage of the total AAMs
in both channels. To determine whether these findings
were due to an overrepresentation of certain amino acids
in the proteins, data was normalized for the total number
of codons for a particular residue. Finally, the weighted
average for amino acid expected chemical severity was calculated by the sum of the average of each of the individual
expected codon chemical severities of the residue multiplied by its contribution to the total number of codons for
the residue in the two channels combined.

Results
Channel Structure and Mutation Mapping
HERG and KCNQ1 channels are likely formed by the
tetrameric assembly of individual alpha subunits, each of
which is composed of six transmembrane segments and
cytosolic N- and C-termini (Figure 1a, b). The voltage
sensing domain (VSD) is composed of the first four transmembrane segments and a pore region is composed of S5,
a re-entrant P-loop containing the selectivity filter, and S6.
Mapping AAMs onto the sequences and predicted topologies of HERG and KCNQ1 subunits yielded some common distribution patterns as well as some unique to the
individual proteins. The final data set used for HERG consists of 172 AAMs at 134 sites and 16 nsSNPs at 16 indi-

vidual sites (see Additional file 1). Of 30 sites harboring
multiple AAMs, 24 sites had two, 4 sites had three and 2
sites had four. For KCNQ1, the final data set includes 174
AAMs mapping to 130 sites and 12 nsSNPs to 12 individual sites (see Additional file 1). Thirty-six sites had multiple AAMs associated with them: 30 sites with two, 5 with
three and 1 with five (Figure 1).
Between the two channels, some similarities exist in the
distribution patterns of AAMs in HERG and KCNQ1, supporting results gathered when much fewer mutations were
known. [35]. For example, both channels contain a large
number of mutations within the pore region (23% and
29% for HERG and KCNQ1, respectively) (Table 2). On
the other hand, differences in percentages of AAMs do
exist in the intra- and extra-cellular linker regions as well
as the two cytosolic termini. In HERG, 23% of all known
disease mutations are found in the extracellular linkers
(between S1 and S2, S3 and S4, S5 and the P-loop, and
between the P-loop and S6). In KCNQ1, only 6% are
found extracellularly whereas 20% are found in the intracellular linkers (between S2–S3 and S4–S5). These differences suggest that different linker regions contribution to
overall function may be channel specific. Another difference occurs in the distal termini. In HERG, 27% of disease
mutations are located in the N-terminus, compared to
only 2% in KCNQ1. However, three quarters of these are
located in the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain, a basic helixloop-helix domain that is unique to the HERG N-terminus and regulates channel closing [36].
nsSNPs distribute differently from AAMs in HERG and
KCNQ1 (Figure 1). In HERG, nsSNPs are more commonly
found in the cytosolic regions (15/16) compared to the
transmembrane regions (1/16). In KCNQ1, 8/12 nsSNPs
are found in the cytosolic regions and 4/12 nsSNPs are
found in the transmembrane region. Most of these occur
at sites that do not have associated disease mutations, suggesting that location is an important determinant of disease. In both channels, however, two sites situated in
cytosolic regions harbor both disease and polymorphic
mutations, suggesting that amino acid identity plays a role
in channel dysfunction at certain sites.
AAMs occur preferentially at sites conserved throughout
vertebrate evolution and at those with lower evolutionary
rates of change
The majority of AAMs mapped to sites completely conserved throughout the evolution of the respective channel:
146/172 mutations (84.9%) in HERG, mapping to 114/
906 (12.6%) of the sites used in the analysis, and 153/174
(87.9%) in KCNQ1, mapping to 110/517 (21.3%) of the
sites used in the analysis. Conversely, 22/172 AAMs in
HERG and 20/174 AAMs in KCNQ1, map to sites with
interspecific variation (Figure 1). Only two sites in HERG

and one in KCNQ1 involve an amino acid change that is
observed in both the AAM and in interspecific change.
Because the amino acid sequences of HERG and KCNQ1
are highly conserved (over 65% complete identity
between fish and human sequences in both channels for
the regions used), a neutral mutational process would still
produce a large number of mutations at conserved sites.
To determine whether AAMs and nsSNPs occur preferentially at evolutionarily diverse sites in HERG and KCNQ1,
we utilized a quantitative approach developed previously
[23]. The evolutionary relationships and the number of
interspecific changes at each site were determined (Figure
2) and in both channels, the largest number of interspecific changes observed at any site was five. Therefore variability data was binned into six categories, ranging from
completely conserved sites (0) to highly variable (5).
A greater proportion of AAMs are found at evolutionarily
conserved sites, and a smaller proportion are found at variable sites, than would be expected by an underlying neutral process (Figure 3a). Using X2 analysis, the difference
between the distributions of observed and expected disease mutations were statistically significant in both channels, even when only the numbers of disease harboring
sites were analyzed (ruling out an effect of multiple mutations at highly mutable sites) or when data were pooled to
account for low numbers of expected disease mutations in
higher variability classes (data not shown). In KCNQ1,
nsSNPs distribute randomly but, in HERG, they were significantly underrepresented at completely conserved sites
and overabundant at variable positions (Figure 3b).
To ascertain directly whether AAMs associate preferentially with sites that experience low rates of evolutionary
change, we utilized an approach similar to the site analysis used above together with codon evolutionary rate
obtained from CODEML in PAML [23]. For both channels, AAMs are found at sites with lower evolutionary rates

(Figure 3c). In both channels, certain AAMs were located
at codons belonging to the 1st and 2nd evolutionary rate
categories as well as to variability classes 0, 1 and 2. This
implies that, when AAMs are found at variable sites, they
may preferentially occur at those with low evolutionary
rates.
Disease mutations are not equally distributed among
functional regions of the channels
Because both channels possess functional regions that are
well conserved among voltage-gated channels, we tested
for uneven domain distribution of AAMs. KCNQ1 and

Arrhythmia-associated mutations in HERG and KCNQ1 are overrepresented at evolutionarily conserved and slowly evolving
Arrhythmia-associated mutations in HERG and KCNQ1 are overrepresented at evolutionarily conserved and
slowly evolving sites. a) Counts of observed (white bars) and expected (black bars) numbers of AAMs at amino acid sites in
HERG and KCNQ1 which have undergone different numbers of substitutions among species (see methods). Because of a low
number of expected mutations in the more variable positions, the X2 statistic was also calculated for pooled data with two
bins, 0 and 1+, with 1 degree of freedom. The number of disease mutations observed at completely conserved sites (0-class) in
both HERG and KCNQ1 is significantly higher than by chance alone: HERG, X2(5 df) = 37.41, p < 0.001 or X2(1 df) = 34.65, p <
0.001; KCNQ1, X2(5 df) = 50.45, p < 0.001 or X2(1 df) = 49.37, p < 0.001. b) Counts of observed and expected numbers of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs). In HERG, fewer nsSNPs occur at completely conserved sites than
expected by chance alone (X2(5 df) = 22.94, p < 0.001 or X2(1 df) = 10.07, p < 0.05) whereas in KCNQ1, the distribution is not
significantly different from the expected count of neutral variation (X2(5 df) = 1.04, p > 0.05). c) Data were pooled to account
for low numbers of expected AAMs at variable sites and significance was confirmed. The distribution of AAMs was significantly
different than what would be expected by random chance for both HERG (X2(7 df) = 26.10, p < 0.001 or X2(1 df) = 14.17, p <
0.001) and KCNQ1 (X2(7 df) = 34.74, p < 0.001 or X2(1 df) = 18.15, p < 0.001).

HERG were divided into six or seven regions, respectively:
N-terminus, PAS domain (HERG only), VSD (S1 through
S4 transmembrane regions only), pore region (excluding
outer turret), extracellular linkers, intracellular linkers and
the C-terminus (see Figure 1). Based on the X2 analysis,
AAMs in both channels are unevenly distributed among
the defined functional domains and, in general, do not
support either a uniform pattern (in which the number of
randomly occurring mutations are proportional to the
total number of residues) or evolutionary pattern (in
which the number of randomly occurring mutations are
proportional to the total number of conserved residues)
(Figure 4a). For both channels, AAMs are overrepresented
in the pore region. AAMs are found preferentially in the
intracellular (IC) linker of KCNQ1 and the extracellular
(EC) linker of HERG, as well as the PAS domain of HERG,
but are underrepresented in the N- and C-termini of both
channels. This finding is especially striking for KCNQ1
considering 32% of its disease mutations are found in the
C-terminus. The number of AAMs in the VSD of HERG
and KCNQ1 were not different from the expected number
based on a uniform or evolutionary distribution.
To examine whether the overall conservation of a region
(average variability/site in domain) exerts a non-additive
influence on the disease susceptibility [25], the average
number of AAMs per site in a given region of HERG and
KCNQ1 was plotted against its average variability per site.
These values were correlated for KCNQ1, but not for
HERG (Figure 4b). The slope of this relationship in
KCNQ1 was greater than those based on the uniform or
evolutionary hypothesis. This indicates that AAMs are
overabundant in conserved regions and less than expected
in variable regions, which suggests that the regional
sequence conservation may play a role in KCNQ1 disease
susceptibility.
The chemical severities of AAMs are different than
changes observed throughout evolution
Two sites in each channel are associated with both an
AAM and nsSNP. In each case, the AAM and nsSNP
involve different amino acid substitutions. Additionally,
of the 42 disease sites that overlap with interspecific
change, only two sites in HERG and one site in KCNQ1
display an AAM that is the same as an interspecific change,
suggesting that the identity of the amino acid contributes
to susceptibility to disease. In previous studies, the chemical severity of disease-causing mutations, determined by
the Grantham's Scale, were on average larger than interspecific changes, and not correlated with evolutionary
changes found at the same sites [21,22]. The average
chemical severity of AAMs in HERG and KCNQ1 were also
larger than those observed throughout evolution (Table
3). Furthermore, we found no correlation between the
chemical severities of both types of change in HERG and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/188

KCNQ1 at variable sites that harbor a disease mutation
(Figure 5a).
The chemical severity of amino acid changes may depend
on the expected chemical severity of mutations that can
arise from a single nucleotide substitution in the codon
involved [21]. For KCNQ1 and HERG, the chemical severity of AAMs and expected chemical severity were correlated (Figure 5b). Interspecific and expected chemical
severities, however, were not correlated for KCNQ1, and
had a very small correlation coefficient for HERG (Figure
5c) (which becomes non-significant when three outliers
are removed; not shown). These findings are consistent
with previous studies, which suggest that interspecific
chemical severity is not influenced by the expected chemical severity of the codon involved but rather by the process of natural selection [21]. Nonetheless, the chemical
severities of changes tolerated at variable sites may be
influenced by the codon's expected chemical severity.
When completely conserved sites were removed (Figure
5d), the expected chemical severity of the involved codon
was correlated with interspecific chemical severity, for
both HERG and KCNQ1, but to a lesser extent than with
disease chemical severity based on slope and correlation
co-efficient.
We next compared the average chemical severities of
AAMs and nsSNPs (Table 3). We found a significant difference between AAMs and nsSNPs in KCNQ1, but not in
HERG, suggesting that other factors, such as location, may
play a larger role in causing channel dysfunction for AAMs
in HERG compared to KCNQ1. There were no significant
differences between nsSNP and interspecific severities in
either channel.
Involvement of specific amino acids in arrhythmogenic
disease
We next determined which amino acids in HERG and
KCNQ1 are targets in arrhythmia-causing mutations. Figure 6 displays the amino acid spectrum of residues
involved in disease for both genes. We found that 28% of
all AAMs in these two channels have occurred at either a
glycine or arginine residue (Figure 6a). This is similar to a
broader protein analysis reported previously [37]. The
contribution of a particular residue to the overall disease
spectrum may be influenced by the proportion of the
given amino acid in these proteins. Therefore, we determined the number of disease mutations at a given residue
as a proportion of the total number of the residue in both
proteins (Figure 6b). Arginine and glycine residues remain
highly represented suggesting they are more likely to be
involved in a disease phenotype compared to other residues. The proportion of tryptophan residues involved in
disease is also high, although the total number of tryptophan residues is low.

The high involvement of some residues in disease may be
due to a high mutation rate that occurs at CpG dinucleotides [21] which is a result of a cytosine to thymine transition. This transition is possible in triplets coding for only
five of the twenty amino acids, which are: arginine (4/6
codons), serine (1/6 codons), proline (1/4 codons), threonine (1/4 codons) and alanine (1/4 codons). Of the total

number of AAMs in HERG and KCNQ1, only 13.3% are
due to a C/T transition at a CpG dinucleotide. Of all
arginine mutations resulting in disease, 47% are due to
this specific nucleotide transition. These numbers suggest
that CpG dinucleotides may contribute to the disease
process but that this is not the only factor responsible for
the high numbers of mutations in this sub-set of amino

acids. A role for factors other that CpG dinucleotide
hypermutability is also supported by the high involvement of glycines and tryptophans in disease (Figure 6b),
which do not possess CpG dinucleotides.
Our findings that the overall chemical severity of AAMs is
greater than those of interspecific variation and SNPs, and
that the chemical severity of AAMs correlates with
expected chemical severity at those individual codons,
suggest that chemical severity is on a continuum and that
a threshold severity exists which, once crossed, results in
disease. We might then expect that whether mutations at
specific amino acids cause disease at all also depends on
the expected chemical severity of the involved codon. To
examine this, the proportion of total AAMs at a particular
residue was plotted against the calculated weighted average of expected chemical severity (Figure 6c). A significant, positive correlation was found between these
suggesting that expected chemical severity of a site contributes to the probability of obtaining a disease mutation, as well as to the severity of that mutation.

Discussion
In this study, we show that that AAMs are overabundant
at evolutionarily conserved and slowly evolving sites,
which are likely critical for channel function and thus
intolerant of changes in amino acid sequence. Because
KCNQ1 and HERG are highly conserved, an underlying
neutral mutational process could produce large numbers
of mutations at conserved sites. Our data provide the
quantitative backing to support an over representation of
AAMs at evolutionarily conserved positions in these channels. A smaller than expected, but still substantial, numbers of AAMs were found at sites that show interspecific
variation. However, only two sites in HERG and one in
KCNQ1 are converted to residues that are both an AAM
and an interspecific change. Thus, the identity of the residue, rather than its location, is most responsible for producing the disease at sites that have undergone
evolutionary change.
HERG and KCNQ1 possess structurally defined domains
with specific functions that have been strongly preserved
throughout the course of evolution [36,38]. We found
that AAMs are found preferentially in some domains, even
after accounting for their size and evolutionary conservation. In both channels, the pore region possesses an overabundance of mutations, while both N- and C-termini
possess an underabundance of mutations. The extracellular linker region had an overabundance of mutations in
HERG, whereas the intracellular linker had an overabundance of mutations in KCNQ1. This implies that the extracellular linker may be more important to overall function
in HERG, whereas the intracellular linker is more critical
for function in KCNQ1. The overabundance of mutations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/188

in the PAS domain, not present in KCNQ1, highlights its
functional importance and suggests that that the addition
of a functionally important domain in a protein can
increase susceptibility to disease. Overall regional conservation, which takes into account the average variability
per site in a domain, contributes to the uneven regional
distribution of disease-causing mutations in some proteins [25], but we found this only for KCNQ1 (Figure 4b).
Therefore, factors other than domain size, site conservation and regional conservation must influence the
domain specific distribution of AAMs in HERG, and possibly in KCNQ1 as well.
NsSNPs are underabundant at conserved sites in HERG,
but distribute randomly in KCNQ1. The latter finding
may be due to a small sample size, although the numbers
of nsSNPs analyzed in HERG were similarly small. This
difference between the channels may be because nsSNPs
are less disruptive when located at conserved sites in
KCNQ1, or because conserved sites in HERG are less tolerant to amino acid changes. Nevertheless, the distribution of analyzed nsSNPs in both channels suggests that
they are phenotypically neutral. The different patterns of
nsSNP distribution between the KCNQ1 and HERG
underscore the need to identify and quantitatively analyze
the distribution of more nsSNPs on each protein, and to
ascertain their impact on channel function and arrhythmia susceptibility. In HERG, it is known that some, but
not all, polymorphisms may alter channel function [39],
and also contribute to an increased QT interval duration
[40].
In both HERG and KCNQ1, AAMs are chemically more
severe than interspecific changes tolerated throughout
evolution or polymorphisms that are not associated with
disease. Codons with a higher expected chemical severity
are associated with disease mutations with a high chemical severity. These data are in keeping with those found
previously in rhodopsin [21] and suggest that the intrinsic
potential of the involved codon contributes to disease
chemical severity.

for both HERG (p < 0.0001) and KCNQ1 (p < 0.0001). The correlations and slopes of the linear regression are significantly
larger (p < 0.001) than those using all sites ('c', above). For both proteins, the slopes of the linear regression are significantly
smaller than those for AMM vs. expected chemical severities ('b', above) The correlation (r) is significantly smaller than that for
AMM vs. expected chemical severities ('b', above) for HERG (p < 0.05) and not for KCNQ1 (p = 0.058). Significant differences
in the average chemical severity were tested using the Mann-Whitney U test whereas the correlation differences between
expected chemical severity and disease or interspecific severity were tested for significance using the z-score calculations.

and stability of the channels. Finally, the chemical severities of interspecific changes in KCNQ1 and HERG also
correlate with those expected for the codons, when only
evolutionarily variable sites are considered. These novel
data argue that, in addition to a predicted role of natural
selection, the expected chemical severity of the codon
contributes to variation observed over the course of evolution in these channels. Despite the presumed predominance of natural selection, the genetic code has been
shown to influence the mutational process when evolutionary divergence is low [41]. These data are significant
given the uncertainty as to the role of natural selection versus non-adaptive forces in shaping genotypic and phenotypic variation [42,43].

Mutations occur predominantly at arginine and glycine resiMutations occur predominantly at arginine and glycine residues. a) Percentage of AAMs that occur at a given
amino acid residue. b) Relative contribution of a given amino
acid residue in HERG and KCNQ1 to AAMs. The total
number of AAMs that occur at a given amino acid was
divided by the total number of residue sites in the combination of the two protein regions used in the analysis. c) The
number of AAMs in KCNQ1 and HERG at each of the
twenty residues, proportional to their occurrence in the two
channels, is significantly correlated (p = 0.001) with the
amino acid's weighted average expected chemical severity.

We also provide novel evidence that the expected chemical severity of a codon contributes to the overrepresentation of certain amino acids in HERG and KCNQ1 AAMs,
especially arginine, tryptophan and glycine. In a recent
study of 437 proteins, these three amino acids were also
highly overrepresented in DAMs [37]. Therefore, we predict that expected chemical severity plays an important
role in determining the propensity of a given codon to
cause disease in many proteins, in addition to other factors such as the residue's roles in biosynthesis, function

Our analyses may be influenced by the fact that some
mutations may, in a systematic way, never be detected. For
example, AAMs that lead to death before natural birth, or
to SUDs, may never be identified unless the fetus or victim
is subsequently screened for arrhythmogenic mutations.
This could, in turn, reduce the number of observed mutations unique to certain sites or functional domains. The
evaluation of AAMs has broadened, and identification of
mutations in KCNQ1 and HERG, and in other candidate
genes, associated with SIDs and SUDs has been carried
out [14-17]. Identification of AAMs in a more broad population may reveal a different sub-set of mutations that
localize to unique regions within the channels, or more
strongly support the susceptibility of sites and functional
domains identified in this study to arrhythmogenic mutations.

Conclusion
Our study represents the first quantitative evolutionary
and chemical severity analysis of AAMs in the HERG and
KCNQ1 potassium channel genes. Unlike nsSNPs, AAMs
preferentially locate to evolutionarily conserved, and
functionally important, sites and regions within HERG
and KCNQ1, and are chemically more severe than
changes which occur in evolution. Expected chemical
severity may contribute to the overrepresentation of certain residues in AAMs, as well as to changes observed
throughout evolution.
Our findings, together with those from other studies, suggest that novel DAMs and AAMs may be recognized
quickly by surveying naturally occurring variation among
species [21]. If a SNP identified in an individual does not
appear in other species at that position, then it is likely to
be disease-causing. The location of AAMs (to conserved or
variable regions and/or residues) may correlate with clinical severity or other characteristics of the diseases. In the
case of Long QT syndrome, genotype and specific mutations have been shown to contribute to phenotype [4447] and the underlying genetic defects contribute to risk
stratification, prevention and therapy [12,48]. UnfortuPage 12 of 14

nately, there is still considerable variation in Long QT
phenotype and age of disease onset [13]. Therefore, continued discovery and mapping of mutations, as done in
this study, along with parallel studies on disease phenotype will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the
genotype-phenotype relationship, help to better predict
the outcome of novel disease mutations and aid in development of mutation-specific therapies.
