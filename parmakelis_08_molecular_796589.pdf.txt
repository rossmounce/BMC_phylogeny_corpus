Abstract
Background: If the insect innate immune system is to be used as a potential blocking step in
transmission of malaria, then it will require targeting one or a few genes with highest relevance and
ease of manipulation. The problem is to identify and manipulate those of most importance to
malaria infection without the risk of decreasing the mosquito's ability to stave off infections by
microbes in general. Molecular evolution methodologies and concepts can help identify such genes.
Within the setting of a comparative molecular population genetic and phylogenetic framework,
involving six species of the Anopheles gambiae complex, we investigated whether a set of four preselected immunity genes (gambicin, NOS, Rel2 and FBN9) might have evolved under selection
pressure imposed by the malaria parasite.
Results: We document varying levels of polymorphism within and divergence between the species,
in all four genes. Introgression and the sharing of ancestral polymorphisms, two processes that have
been documented in the past, were verified in this study in all four studied genes. These processes
appear to affect each gene in different ways and to different degrees. However, there is no evidence
of positive selection acting on these genes.
Conclusion: Considering the results presented here in concert with previous studies, genes that
interact directly with the Plasmodium parasite, and play little or no role in defense against other
microbes, are probably the most likely candidates for a specific adaptive response against P.
falciparum. Furthermore, since it is hard to establish direct evidence linking the adaptation of any
candidate gene to P. falciparum infection, a comparative framework allowing at least an indirect link
should be provided. Such a framework could be achieved, if a similar approach like the one involved
here, was applied to all other anopheline complexes that transmit P. falciparum malaria.

Background
Vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue constitute a major obstacle to socio-economic development in
much of the tropics and remain high on the list of priorities for the improvement of public health. Unlike other
infectious diseases, vector-borne diseases stand out
because of their complex mode of transmission, requiring
the transition from man to man or animal to man
through an arthropod vector. This method of transmission implies the simple principle that removal of the vector will lead to the elimination of the disease [1]. This
principle has been verified historically, since whenever
control of an insect-borne disease has been achieved, this
has most often been done through the control of the vector rather than the direct control of the disease through
drugs or vaccines. The only exception has been yellow
fever, for which a functional vaccine was developed early
on [2]. Having this historical fact in mind, research has
focused on controlling the vector, and this resulted in an
increased output of medical entomological research over
the last ten years or so. The best example of this is the
acquisition of the complete genome sequence of Anopheles
gambiae [3], the major malaria vector in sub-Saharan
Africa and of Aedes aegypti [4], the major vector of yellow
fever and dengue.
The wealth of results obtained has now led medical entomologists towards the development of novel ideas that
take full account of this new knowledge. One such idea in
which much research is invested is the "construction" of
"new mosquitoes" that would be unable to transmit
malaria or other diseases [5,6]. This "new mosquito"
would be based on transgenic strains carrying genes that
make them refractory to their parasites. After almost two
decades in effort, the technology for creating transgenic
mosquitoes has been developed and encouraging results
have sprouted from this research [7-9]. However, there is
still the need to identify those refractory genes best suited
for "constructing" transgenic mosquitoes.
In the case of malaria, the insect's immunity genes have
been considered as very good candidates, since following
the sequencing of the An. gambiae genome [3] a large set
of genes that mediate mosquito susceptibility to Plasmodium infections has been identified [10-16]. However, if
the insect innate immune system is to be used as a potential blocking step in transmission of malaria, then it will
require targeting one or a few genes of highest relevance
and ease of manipulation. The problem, then, is to identify those of highest importance to malaria infection. By
and large, the immune responses are adaptive for the mosquito. Therefore, modification of such genes runs the risk
of decreasing the mosquito's ability to stave off infections
by microbes in general, thereby decreasing mosquito fitness and lessening the chance to become established in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/79

the natural population. Ideally, one would want to identify a gene, or part of a gene, that specifically targets the
particular pathogen of interest. Furthermore, it is crucial
that the gene(s) used in any attempt to block transmission
in natural populations focus on genes specific to the relevant mosquito and Plasmodium species, since it has been
suggested that the defense exhibited by the vector species,
varies depending on the invading Plasmodium species
[11].
In this study we focus on the species of the An. gambiae
complex and we assess the genetic polymorphism of four
genes (gambicin, NOS, Rel2 and FBN9) that have been
identified as part of the innate immune system of An.gambiae. The An. gambiae complex is composed of seven
closely related species, i.e. An. gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles melas, Anopheles merus, Anopheles bwambae
and Anopheles quadriannulatus A and B. The first two species are the major vectors of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, with An. melas and An. merus being
intermediate in importance. The last three species are
highly zoophilic and are never or rarely exposed to the
human Plasmodium falciparum.
The studied loci have been implicated in the resistance
towards Plasmodium infections largely through microarray
and RNAi experiments [11,17-19]. Molecular population
genetics and phylogenetics is an independent approach
that could verify that evolutionary patterns re-enforce
implications from laboratory studies. Within a comparative framework, we evaluate the possibility that these four
genes evolve, in the lineages of the major malaria vectors,
under selection imposed by the direct or indirect interaction with the Plasmodium. The approach relies on the prediction that if Plasmodium infection affects the mosquito's
fitness, we may expect the accumulation of adaptive
amino acid substitutions in those anti-malarial genes that
are crucial in specifically limiting Plasmodium infection in
vector species, whereas such changes are less likely to be
found in closely related species that have historically limited interaction with the parasite. An assumption of this
approach is that the Anopheles species have exhibited an
adaptive response to P.falciparum infection which is suggested by several lines of evidence [20].

Results
Polymorphism, divergence and McDonald-Kreitman tests
Gambicin
A fragment of 589 to 682 bp (Table 1) was amplified from
all specimens. This fragment includes all the coding
sequence of the gene, consisting of 246 bp. A total of 59
sequences (Table 2) including the whole coding region of
this gene were obtained from six species of the An. gambiae complex. Out of the 59 sequences 37 represented different alleles. The nucleotide diversity (Pi) varied from

0.000 to 0.024 and 0.001 to 0.007 in the synonymous and
non-synonymous sites, respectively (Table 2). There were
very few mutations (4 mutations in 3 pairwise comparisons) shared between species, whereas there were four
alleles out of the 37, that were shared between them. For
the coding region, Dxy (average number of nucleotide
substitutions per site between species) ranged from 0.006
to 0.014. Very few fixed differences were present between
species, and in most comparisons no fixed non-synonymous differences were found (Table 3). Not surprisingly
therefore, the McDonald-Kreitman tests did not indicate
positive selection.
NOS
A total of 46 sequences were produced from the studied
species (Table 2). The sequences produced varied from
993 to 1007 bp, of which 771 bp were coding. Out of the
46 sequences 38 were different alleles. Although there
were some shared polymorphisms (10 in six pairwise
comparisons) between the species, there were no alleles
shared between them. Dxy ranged from 0.009 to 0.017 for
the coding region. Nucleotide diversity (Pi) ranged
between 0.007 to 0.050 and 0.001 to 0.003 in the synonymous and non-synonymous sites, respectively. A single
fixed replacement substitution was observed in all pairwise comparisons (Table 3) with An. arabiensis (except
with An. gambiae). However, none of the McDonald-Kreitman tests were significant.
Rel2
We obtained 74 sequences from six species. The fragments
amplified in all specimens ranged from 665 to 803 bp. Of

these approximately 710 bp were coding sequence (Table
2). Out of the 74 sequences 49 were different alleles
(Table 2). There were a few polymorphisms shared
between species (nine in two pairwise comparisons) but
there were no shared alleles. Dxy ranged from 0.014 to
0.037 between species. The nucleotide diversity (Pi) in the
synonymous as well as in the non-synonymous sites was
quite low varying from 0.000 to 0.031 in the synonymous
sites, and from 0.000 to 0.004 in the non-synonymous
sites. As was the case in the previous genes, the McDonaldKreitman tests of positive selection did not show a significant excess of fixed non-synonymous differences between
the species, although there were fixed replacement substitutions present in all the pairwise species comparisons
(Table 4).
FBN9
We successfully determined 60 sequences from the six
species all together. The fragments amplified in all specimens ranged from 764 to 807 bp, and they were all coding
sequence (Table 2). Of these 60 sequences, 54 were different alleles (Table 2). There were a lot of mutations (48
mutations in 10 pairwise comparisons) shared between
species, but again there were no alleles shared. Dxy ranged
from 0.016 to 0.029 between species. Nucleotide diversity
(Pi) in the synonymous sites was higher compared to the
previous genes and varied from 0.016 to 0.079. However,
it was quite low in the non-synonymous sites since it
ranged from 0.000 up to 0.003. As presented in Table 4
there is not even a single fixed non-synonymous substitution between the species of the complex. Consequently,

the McDonald-Kreitman tests were negative regarding
positive selection acting on the gene (Table 4).
A second series of McDonald-Kreitman tests were performed for all the genes, but this time the alleles were not
grouped according to species. They were grouped according to their phylogenetic relationships, as indicated by the
inferred phylogenetic trees. For example in Rel2, a set of
the An. gambiae alleles were pooled together with the An.
bwambae sequences to form a single group, as indicated by
the phylogenetic tree of figure 1. This group of alleles was
subsequently contrasted to the alleles of the remaining
species. Again no signs of positive selection could be
detected.
Phylogeny and maximum likelihood tests for selection
Since no non-synonymous fixed differences were found in
any species pairwise comparisons for Gambicin and FBN9
(Table 3, 4) only NOS and Rel2 were subjected to the
PAML analysis. The phylogenetic trees for these two genes,
produced from the bayesian analysis, and on which the
various models of the PAML software were evaluated for
their goodness of fit, are presented in figures 1 and 2.

In the NOS tree (Figure 2) only An. merus, An. melas and
An. quadriannulatus form strongly supported monophyletic groups. Some alleles of An.bwambae (BWA16 B/
BWA12 B and BWA11 A/BWA11 B) are placed very far
apart from their conspecific sequences. Furthermore, each
one of these two sets of An. bwambae alleles, seems to be
closely related to a different Anopheles species. The alleles

BWA16 B/BWA12 B are placed within the clade hosting
An. merus, An. bwambae and An. quadriannulatus, whereas
the alleles BWA11 A/BWA11 B seem to be more closely
related to An. gambiae and An. arabiensis. At the same time,
the alleles of An. gambiae seem to be forming two separate
clades that are firmly to each other and are ambiguously
related to the An. arabiensis clade.
In the Rel2 tree (Figure 1), the alleles of most species form
strongly supported monophyletic groups and the relationships between the species are well resolved (posterior
probabilities above 0.80). As was the case in NOS, the
alleles of An. gambiae form two separate clades that are
placed apart. In the case of Rel2, one of the An. gambiae
groups is closely related to An. bwambae, and the other is
part of a broader clade that incorporates both the An.
merus and the An. melas clades.
In the case of the NOS gene, only the likelihood ratio test
of M0 versus M3 (Table 5) was statistically significant and
in favor of variable selection pressure among sites. All
other likelihood ratio tests comparing the among sites
models, were not in favor of an ω value greater than one
among sites (Table 5). Similar results were obtained for
Rel2, where again only the comparison between models
M0 and M3 (Table 5) indicated variable selection pressure
acting on the amplified Rel2 fragment.
Regarding the branch-site tests for the NOS and Rel2
(Table 6), regardless of whether An. gambiae or An. arabiensis were designated as the foreground branches, the like-

lihood ratio tests were not in favor of positive selection
acting on at least some codons of the foreground branches
in either gene. The branch-site test 2 for NOS, was also
applied to a phylogenetically designated "gambiae" clade.
By this we mean that we considered as the gambiae clade
(foreground branch) not only the alleles of An. gambiae,
but those of An. arabiensis and An. bwambae that are
ambiguously related to the An. gambiae alleles, as well
(Figure 2). The result of the branch-site test 2 was negative
in this case as well.

Discussion
The nucleotide diversity (Pi) of all studied loci was quite
low in all the species of the An. gambiae complex both in
the synonymous and the non-synonymous substitutions
(Table 2). Gambicin exhibited the lowest levels of variation and FBN9 the least (Table 2). The levels of divergence
of these loci between the different species were low as
well. Among the four analyzed loci, Rel2 and FBN9 were
the most divergent, with Dxy values range from 1.4 to
3.7% and 1.6 to 2.9%, respectively.
In the gambicin locus it can be seen that in some species
pairwise comparisons the fixed differences (synonymous
and non-synonymous) are zero (Table 3). One could
argue that this could be the result of introgression
between the species and/or the continued segregation of
inherited ancestral polymorphisms. However, we argue
that these two processes have not equally affected the
observed pattern. Introgression cannot be ruled out
between the lineages of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis,
since in the phylogenetic tree of the respective gene (see

Additional file 1), the alleles of An. arabiensis cluster
together with the An. gambiae alleles. Evidence for introgression between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis has been
reported previously [20-23]. At the same time, the role of
the shared ancestral polymorphisms in the observed pattern is limited since in gambicin the shared polymorphisms between the species were in the majority of the
pairwise comparisons zero (see results). We estimated
(results not shown) the level of divergence between species using the non-coding regions of the gambicin gene.
The net between species average Kimura two-parameter
distance [24] as estimated by MEGA v.3.1 [25], ranged
between 0.4% (An. gambiae versus An. arabiensis) and
3.8% (An. melas versus An. arabiensis). This level of divergence is quite low compared to the respective level of
divergence for Rel2 and NOS (see below). The complete
absence of fixed non-synonymous substitutions between
pairwise species comparisons in the gambicin locus indicates that purifying selection is the major force that shapes
the observed evolutionary pattern of gambicin (Table 3).
Gambicin has been found to be an important antibacterial peptide, that is however, marginally lethal to P. berghei
[19] and has no specificity towards P. falciparum [11].
More likely, this gene as many others belonging to the
antimicrobial defense system of the mosquito, evolve
under the selection constrains imposed by the bacteria
that the mosquitoes encounter during their lifetime. As
Dong et al. (2006) also conclude there is little reason to
believe that gambicin has undergone major adaptations to
malaria.

separate and relatively well supported monophyletic
clade. The case for genetic introgression between An.
bwambae and An. gambiae has been made previously [26],

and this is reflected here as well. However, we consider
that in the case of NOS, we are also witnessing sharing of
ancestral polymorphisms between the species pairs An.
bwambae/An. merus and An. bwambae/An. quadriannulatus.

We claim this since out of ten shared polymorphisms,
four were shared between the previously mentioned pairs
of species.
The expression pattern of NOS was found to vary depending on the Plasmodium species infecting An. gambiae [18],
implying that the differential expression pattern is the
effect of co-evolution between the host and its specific
parasite. The present study does not add support to this

interpretation since both the McDonald-Kreitman tests
and the PAML analysis did not detect any signs of positive
selection acting on the NOS gene. Even though the PAML
analysis indicated that varying selective pressure is acting
on the codons of the NOS fragment amplified (Table 5),
all other likelihood models that allowed for positive selection to be acting on some codons or branches of the NOS
fragment, produced negative results (Table 5, Table 6).

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:79

In the phylogenetic tree of Rel2 (Figure 1) there is a group
of An. gambiae alleles that are very closely related to alleles
of An. bwambae. Shared polymorphisms in the Rel2 locus
are detected between An. arabiensis and An. gambiae but
not between An. gambiae and An. bwambae. Consequently,
the unexpected clustering of the An. gambiae alleles with
An. bwambae, is more likely due to introgression between
the two species, as noted above for other genes.
At the Rel2 locus the level of nucleotide differences among
species (Table 4) were comparable to those observed in
the NOS locus. However, at the Rel2 locus, there are several fixed non-synonymous differences between certain
pair of species. For example, between An. arabiensis and
An. melas there were eight non-synonymous fixed differences. Neither the McDonald-Kreitman nor the maximum
likelihood tests for selection provide evidence of positive
selection in this gene. Rel2, like gambicin and NOS was
found to be under purifying selection. As was the case in
NOS, the maximum likelihood analysis of PAML, pointed
to a varying selective pressure among sites (M0 vs M3, pvalue = 0.0036: Table 5), but no signs of positive selection
were detected in the site by site or the branch-site analysis
(Table 5, Table 6).
Rel2 regulates the expression of the antibacterial genes
CEC1, GAM1, DEF1, CEC3, and key malaria parasite
antagonists, LRIM1, TEP1, and TEP4 in An. gambiae [17].
Thus, Rel2 is regulating the expression pattern of many
and diverse genes of the Anopheles innate immune system,
among which at least two (LRIM1 and TEP1) have very
strong anti-malaria activity. However, the remaining
genes regulated by Rel2 are, as far as known, antibacterial
peptides. Therefore, even though Rel2 may be involved in
the defense against malaria infection, its involvement in
the expression pattern of many antimicrobial genes may
greatly reduce the possibility of this gene specifically
exhibiting an evolutionary response to Plasmodium. However the comparative approach applied here did detect
purifying selection acting on the amplified Rel2 fragment
from the six species of the An. gambiae, as would be
expected in a locus coding for a product that serves as the
regulator of the expression of the general antimicrobial
defense of the organism. Because Rel2 is mostly involved
in antibacterial defense, why are we not witnessing positive selection imposed by the bacterial pathogens? This
type of positive selection has been reported for GNBP1,
GNBP2 and Relish in termites and was related to the
diverse microbes encountered in different habitats [27].
In the present study, there are significant ecological differences among the studied species. For example the species
An. melas and An. merus favour brackish water for immature development, in contrast to the freshwater species An.
gambiae and An. arabiensis. Even though ecological differences among the studied species are evident, no positive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/79

selection could be detected. At this point we have to point
that the Rel2 fragment targeted in our study resides in the
N-terminal homology domain region of Rel2, whereas
positive selection has been detected [27] in the spacer
connecting this region to the C-terminal ankyrin repeat
region (see 27).
The FBN9 locus is characterized by a very large number of
polymorphic site differences (mainly synonymous)
between the species (Table 4). In the phylogenetic tree of
FBN9 (see Additional file 2) the alleles of An. gambiae are
interspersed across the tree, whereas the alleles of the
remaining species form strongly supported monophyletic
groups ambiguously connected to each other. Once more
the observed pattern could be the result of introgression
between species, or the sharing of ancestral polymorphisms. Because the shared polymorphisms are present in
almost all species pairwise comparisons in the case of
FBN9, we argue that the effect of shared ancestral polymorphisms has played a key role in this pattern. In some
cases the shared polymorphisms are as many as eight (An.
arabiensis-An. bwambae) or 19 (An. arabiensis-An. gambiae).
Characterization of the FBN gene family has suggested
that the FBNs have structural features (pattern recognition
receptors) that allow them to recognize parasites and play
an essential role in the mosquito's innate immunity, in
addition to the physiological processes associated with
blood feeding [28]. FBN9 a member of the FBN family,
was recently found to be up-regulated when An. gambiae
was invaded by P. falciparum ookinetes but not responding to P. berghei ookinetes invasion [11]. The structural
features of FBN9, as well as the fact that in RNAi gene
silencing assays, a FBN9 knockdown increases An. gambiae
mosquitoes susceptibility to both P. falciparum and P.
berghei infections [11], raise the possibility that this gene
could be evolving in response to Plasmodium. Furthermore, in a recent study [29] it was shown that positive
selection drives the evolution of pattern recognition
receptors in Drosophila. However, even in the case of FBN9
no signs of positive selection could be detected and there
were not even any fixed non-synonymous differences
between the species (Table 4). FBN9 is also involved in
the immune response against bacteria [11] and this could
be the major reason why this gene as well has not undergone major adaptations to malaria.
Presently there are only three studies assessing genetic variation in innate immunity genes specifically implicated as
being important in controlling Plasmodium infection in
Anopheles [20,30,31]. In a study of the defensin gene [31]
An. gambiae, An. arabiensis and An. quadriannulatus were
involved and the authors concluded that strong purifying
selection is acting on the mature peptide and probably the
whole coding region. Furthermore, the authors argued

Page 10 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:79

that since An. quadriannulatus is not exposed to human
pathogens, identical mature peptide and similar pattern
of polymorphism across the three species implies that
human pathogens played no role as selective agents on
this peptide. Similarly, it was concluded [30] that no evidence for strong selection could be detected on a suite of
mosquito immune system genes, CTL4, CTLMA2, LRIM1,
and APL2 (or LRRD7), which have been shown to affect
Plasmodium development in functional studies. The
authors used five different species of the An. gambiae complex, namely An. gambiae, An. arabiensis, An. bwambae and
An. merus. However, they only focused on An. gambiae and
used all remaining species as outgroups in their analyses.
One of the loci studied in [30], LRIM1, has been the subject of a separate study [20] in which besides the conservative McDonald-Kreitman tests for positive selection, a
maximum likelihood approach with PAML software was
also applied. In the latter study, six species of the An. gambiae complex were involved and it was concluded that
LRIM1 underwent adaptive evolution in the An. arabiensis
lineage.
LRIM1 was recently established as a major anti-Plasmodium factor [15] and it has been speculated that it could be
possible that only some LRIM1 alleles suppress infection
with P. falciparum, and these may even be specific for certain P.falciparum strains [20]. LRIM1 is the only gene of
the Anopheles immune system that directly interacts with
Plasmodium and has not been implicated to be involved in
the defense against other pathogens. LRIM1 is also the
only Anopheles immune gene that has been studied that
shows strong signs of positive selection acting in one of
the major malaria vectors, An. arabiensis [20].

Conclusion
It is not surprising that studies of the genes considered
here as well as those by [31] and [30] could not detect
selection related specifically to Plasmodium. However, the
positive results of [20] lend credence to the general comparative approach in identifying the minority of the hundreds of genes implicated in the insect innate immunity
response that may have responded specifically to Plasmodium. Considering the results presented here in concert
with previous studies, genes that interact directly with the
Plasmodium parasite, and play little or no role in defense
against other microbes, are probably the most likely candidates for a specific adaptive response against P. falciparum. However, even though several lines of evidence
exist and support that that the Anopheles species have
exhibited an adaptive response to P. falciparum infection
[20], we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
the mosquitoes are utilizing solely their anti-bacterial
defense system to fight against Plasmodium. Furthermore,
since it is hard to establish direct evidence linking the
adaptation of any candidate gene to P. falciparum infec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/79

tion, a comparative framework allowing at least an indirect link should be provided. Such a framework could be
achieved, if a similar approach like the one involved here,
was applied to all other anopheline complexes that transmit P. falciparum malaria. Such complexes do exist (i.e.
Anopheles funestus, Anopheles nili, Anopheles moucheti) in
continental sub-Saharan Africa. Considering the systematic status of these anopheline complexes [32,33], it can
be safely argued that the acquisition of P. falciparum by
each of these complex of species was an independent evolutionary event. In the case that the same candidate gene
and/or the same fragment of the respective gene, was
identified as being evolving under positive selection in
more than one of these complexes, then an indirect yet
very strong proof of evolution imposed by P. falciparum
infection, would be recognized.

Methods
Mosquitoes sampling
Six species of the An. gambiae species complex were
included in this study. The adult An. gambiae specimens
used were collected from two regions of Cameroon
(Mbebé and Nyabéssan). Adult An. arabiensis females
were collected from Kousseri in Cameroon, whereas adult
An. melas were collected from Ipono (Cameroon). Larvae
of An. bwambae originating from Bwamba county in
Uganda, were kindly provided by Ralph Harbach. DNA
extracts of An. merus were kindly provided by David O'
Brochta (collected from Furvela in Mozambique). Finally,
An. quadriannulatus A specimens from Kruger National
Park in South Africa, were kindly provided by Anton Cornel.
DNA methods
DNA was extracted using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen)
using either the entire mosquito or 2–3 of its legs. Species
and molecular form identification was performed following recent diagnostic protocols [34,35]. All An. gambiae
specimens belonged to the S molecular form.
Loci analysed
We amplified four An. gambiae loci that have been experimentally associated with malaria infection. Multiple
primers were designed for each one of the targeted loci
using the software FastPCR [36] and based on the An.
gambiae genome [3]. The amplified genes were: a) Gambicin (Ensembl Gene Id: AGAP008645, Chromosome 3R)
that is composed of three exons and has a total length of
648 bp. Of these only 246 bp are coding sequence. Gambicin is an antimicrobial peptide that is ultimately
secreted as a 61-aa mature peptide. It is induced during
both early and late stages of malaria infection. In vitro
experiments showed [19] that the mature peptide can kill
both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, has a
morphogenic effect on a filamentous fungus, and is mar-

ginally lethal to Plasmodium berghei ookinetes. The primer
pairs designed in this study targeted the whole coding
region of the gene and the introns in between. b) Nitric
Oxide Synthase (NOS) [Ensembl Gene Id: AGAP008255,
Chromosome 3R] which is a complex gene, and is comprised of 18 exons separated by introns of varying length
and spread over about 33 kb (exons: 3342 bp). It was
recently suggested [18] that P. falciparum ingestion triggers
a midgut-associated, as well as a systemic, response in the
mosquito, involving three genes, one of which is NOS. We
targeted a fragment of approximately 1000 bp (part of
exon 14, exons 15 and 16, part of exon 17 and all the
introns between those exons). c) Rel2 (Ensembl Gene Id:
AGAP006747, Chromosome 2L) that is comprised of 10
exons separated by introns of varying size. The total length
of the gene is approximately 11.66 kb out of which only
3779 bp belong to exons. It has been found that this gene
is involved [17] in the regulation of the intensity of mosquito infection with the malaria parasite, P. berghei. The
primers used amplified a fragment of approximately 800
bp, including parts of exons 3 and 4 and the intron in
between. d) FBN9 (Ensembl Gene Id: AGAP011197,
Chromosome 3L) that is a single exon gene (846 bp) and
produces a 282-aa mature peptide. FBN9 has been found
to be up-regulated in An. gambiae after P. falciparum infection, but not with P. berghei infection [11]. The primers
designed in this study aimed for a fragment of 810 bp covering almost the complete gene.
In most of the cases a nested PCR protocol was applied to
successfully amplify the targeted loci. In the nested PCR
protocol, the product of a PCR using a specific set of primers was used as a template for a subsequent PCR using
primers internal to the ones used in the preceding PCR.
The sequences of the primers used in the amplification of
each locus are reported in Table 1. PCR products were
examined on a 2% agarose gel, purified using the
Qiaquick Purification Kit (Qiagen) and submitted for
direct sequencing. The PCR products were sequenced in
both directions using BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (v3.1, Applied BioSystems) reagents and an 3730
ABI capillary sequencer. All individuals that were found to
be heterozygous for two or more positions were subjected
to PCR amplification again and the amplicons were
cloned using the TOPO-TA cloning kit for sequencing
(Invitrogen). From each individual, a minimum of three
transformed colonies were selected, and the size of the
DNA insert was screened by PCR using the T3/T7 primer
pair of the TOPO-TA vector. In most of the cases the correct size insert was obtained, and was subsequently
sequenced in both directions. Because of multiple insertion/deletion (indels) in the introns of the gambicin locus,
direct sequencing usually produced sequences of low
quality. In order to circumvent this issue, most of the gambicin sequences produced were obtained via cloning of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/79

PCR products. In this case, a minimum of five individually transformed colonies from each individual were
screened, and at least three were sequenced. In all PCRs to
ensure the minimum number of miss-incorporations
Platinum High Fidelity Taq (Invitrogen) was used.
All produced sequence chromatograms were inspected by
eye to confirm the validity of all differences either
between alleles of the same individual, or within and
between species. Sequences were viewed, edited and
assembled using CodonCode Aligner (v. 1.6.3 CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA, USA). All produced
sequences were compared to the published An. gambiae
genome [3] to verify their homology to the respective loci.
Sequences produced for this study have been submitted to
GenBank under the accession numbers EU304549 to
EU304787.
Species polymorphism and divergence
All sequences were aligned using CodonCode Aligner (v.
1.6.3 CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA, USA).
Basic analyses of polymorphism and divergence were performed using the computer program DNAsp v.4.10.3
[37]. Parameters estimated included the pairwise diversity
(Pi) at synonymous and non-synonymous sites and the
average number of nucleotide substitutions per site
between species (Dxy).
Tests for selection
In order to assess whether selection is acting on any of the
immunity genes amplified from the six species of the An.
gambiae complex, two different approaches were implemented. The first approach involved the McDonald-Kreitman test [38] that is intended to identify selection
through an excess of amino acid substitution between
species. This test compares the dN/dS ratio between species to within species and is based on the idea that substitutions under positive selection will go to fixation rapidly,
and are therefore rarely observed as polymorphisms.
However, they are present as fixed differences between
species and an excess of replacement fixed differences is
therefore an indication of positive selection. This test
allows the detection of selection on a whole protein is
bound to be quite conservative in detecting selection [39]
and lacks the power of a site by site analysis. This analysis
was performed using DNAsp v.4.10.3 [37].

A second and more powerful method to detect selection
was also applied. This method detects elevated dN/dS
ratios (ω ratios) using maximum likelihood approaches
(see Yang 2007) and is less conservative than the McDonald-Kreitman test. We reasoned that it may be hard to
detect positive selection on the whole of each amplified
fragment, because the majority of their codons are likely
to be functionally constrained and therefore under purify-

ing selection. However, such purifying selection may be
masking positive selection of a small number of codons
within the amplified fragments. We therefore used a
codon by codon maximum likelihood test, to ask if we
could detect any codons that have been under repeated,
strong positive selection. This method allows a site by site
analysis, thus the identification of particular codons that
have been evolving under selective constrains [40] is feasible. This analysis was performed using the software
package PAML v. 4. [41]. At this point we have to stress
that since we are dealing with a set of species very closely
related, one has to be cautious in the interpretation of the
results and the attribution of unusual patterns of diversity
to selection. It is certain that shared ancestral polymorphisms and recent introgression between the complex
members, will confound the actual processes. The loci
subjected to the PAML analysis were those that exhibited
at least one fixed non-synonymous change (i.e. NOS and
Rel2), in some of the pairwise species comparisons
(Tables 3, 4). Each locus was separately analyzed. Using
sequence data from the coding and non-coding region of
each amplified locus, a gene tree describing the phylogenetic relationships of all the taxa studied, was generated.
The trees were constructed with the phylogenetic software
program MrBayes 3.1 [42], using partitioned data. The
data sets were partitioned so that a different substitution
model could be applied to the introns, the first, second,
and third codon positions of each gene. The substitution
models implemented for each partition in the Bayesian
analysis, were those suggested by Modeltest 3.7 [43]
according to the Akaike Information Criterion [44]. The
generated Bayesian trees served as the basis for the implementation of the maximum likelihood methods of the
PAML package of programs [41] aiming at detecting adaptive molecular evolution under specific models of codon
substitution. When sequences evolve under neutrality, the
relative number of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions is expected to be 1. In the case of positive
selection, amino acid changes are favored and ω > 1,
whereas under purifying selection amino acid changes are
prevented and ω < 1.
In each one of the loci subjected to the PAML analysis, we
estimated the likelihood values of the respective phylogenetic tree as being the result of lineages evolving under the
assumptions of the site models M0, M3, M1a, M2a, M7
and M8 implemented in PAML. These models allow ω values to vary among different codons. Following the suggestions of Yang (2007) the site model pairs that appear to be
particularly useful for real data analysis, are the M1a versus M2a and M7 versus M8. However, we also compared
model M0 versus M3 in order to see if the selective pressure is uniform among sites. The strength of positive selection was calculated by comparing twice the log likelihood
difference in a chi-square test with four (M0 versus M3) or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/79

two (M1a versus M2a, and M8 versus M7) degrees of freedom.
Finally, aiming at investigating whether the branches
leading to the two major human malaria vectors, An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, are evolving under positive selection, we applied the branch-site models for each one of
this species. Thus, the An. gambiae lineage in one case and
the An. arabiensis lineage in the other case, were considered as the foreground branches (branch evolving with an
ω value different than one), and ω values were allowed to
vary among lineages and among sites [40]. Model 2, with
ω free to vary (model = 2, several ω values for branches:
settings of PAML), was compared to the same model, but
with ω fixed to one (branch-site test 2) in order to examine if indeed the ω value of the foreground lineage is significantly different from one. The strength of positive
selection was calculated by comparing twice the log likelihood difference in a chi-square test with 1 degree of freedom.
