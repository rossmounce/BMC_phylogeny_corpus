Evolution of an endofungal Lifestyle: Deductions
from the Burkholderia rhizoxinica Genome

Abstract
Background: Burkholderia rhizoxinica is an intracellular symbiont of the phytopathogenic zygomycete Rhizopus
microsporus, the causative agent of rice seedling blight. The endosymbiont produces the antimitotic macrolide
rhizoxin for its host. It is vertically transmitted within vegetative spores and is essential for spore formation of the
fungus. To shed light on the evolution and genetic potential of this model organism, we analysed the whole
genome of B. rhizoxinica HKI 0454 - a type strain of endofungal Burkholderia species.
Results: The genome consists of a structurally conserved chromosome and two plasmids. Compared to free-living
Burkholderia species, the genome is smaller in size and harbors less transcriptional regulator genes. Instead, we
observed accumulation of transposons over the genome. Prediction of primary metabolic pathways and
transporters suggests that endosymbionts consume host metabolites like citrate, but might deliver some amino
acids and cofactors to the host. The rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster shows evolutionary traces of horizontal
gene transfer. Furthermore, we analysed gene clusters coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS).
Notably, B. rhizoxinica lacks common genes which are dedicated to quorum sensing systems, but is equipped with
a large number of virulence-related factors and putative type III effectors.
Conclusions: B. rhizoxinica is the first endofungal bacterium, whose genome has been sequenced. Here, we
present models of evolution, metabolism and tools for host-symbiont interaction of the endofungal bacterium
deduced from whole genome analyses. Genome size and structure suggest that B. rhizoxinica is in an early phase
of adaptation to the intracellular lifestyle (genome in transition). By analysis of tranporters and metabolic pathways
we predict how metabolites might be exchanged between the symbiont and its host. Gene clusters for
biosynthesis of secondary metabolites represent novel targets for genomic mining of cryptic natural products. In
silico analyses of virulence-associated genes, secreted proteins and effectors might inspire future studies on
molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial-fungal interaction.

Background
The genus Burkholderia comprises a group of highly
versatile bacteria [1] that occupy remarkably diverse
ecological niches in both terrestrial and aquatic environments [2]. Their multifarious lifestyle is illustrated by
various infamous pathogens, free-living non-pathogens
and Burkholderia spp. that form mutualistic symbioses,
e.g. with vascular plants [3,4] and basidiomycetes [5]. A
particularly intriguing tripartite microbial interaction
involving a Burkholderia sp. has been unveiled in the

context of rice seedling blight, a severe plant disease
affecting rice plants in Asia. The causative agent is the
zygomycete Rhizopus microsporus, which uses rhizoxin,
a potent antimitotic agent, as a virulence factor [6,7]. In
the course of studying rhizoxin biosynthesis, we have
found that this virulence factor is in fact not produced
by the fungus, but by bacteria residing within the fungal
cytosol [8,9]. These endofungal bacteria represent a new
Burkholderia species, Burkholderia rhizoxinica [10]. A
related endofungal bacterium, Burkholderia endofungorum, was identified as the true producer of the toxic
cyclopeptide rhizonin [10,11]. These are the first
observed cases where designated mycotoxins are not
produced by the fungus itself, but by endosymbiotic
bacteria [8,12,13]. In total we have identified eight

related Burkholderia-Rhizopus associations from five different continents [14], which have likely undergone a
parasitism-mutualism shift [15]. While there have been
a growing number of reports on endofungal bacteria
[16-19], the delicate and slowly growing Rhizopus endosymbionts organisms are the first ones that could be
grown in pure culture [8,10]. Large-scale fermentation
of isolated B. rhizoxinica could drastically improve
work-up procedures and yield of even more potent antitumoral rhizoxin derivatives [20]. From an ecological
point of view, the fungus and the bacteria form an intimate association where the symbiont delivers a chemical
weapon to its host and in turn the symbiont profits
from nutrients and spreading within fungal spores. A
highly remarkable characteristic of the BurkholderiaRhizopus symbiosis is that the bacterial symbiont tightly
controls sporulation of the fungal host [21]. Strains that
have been cured by antibiotic treatment are incapable of
asexual reproduction and thus fully depend on the presence of the endobacteria. In this way, the persistence
and distribution of this unique toxinogenic bacterialfungal association is warranted. Recently, we have
sequenced the whole genome of Burkholderia rhizoxinica HKI-0454, as a reference strain for BurkholderiaRhizopus associations [22]. Here, we provide insights
into the genetic tool box of an endofungal symbiont by
extensive analysis of the full genome sequence.

Results and Discussion
Genome Properties and Comparative Genomics

The genome of B. rhizoxinica has a total size of
3,750,139 bp and a G+C content of 60.7%. It consists of
three replicons (Figure 1) including the chromosome
(2.75 Mbp), and the plasmids pBRH01 (822,304 bp) and
pBRH02 (172,525 bp) [23]. Compared to other representatives of the genus Burkholderia, the genome is
remarkably small (Table 1). Indeed, it is the smallest
Burkholderia genome published so far, being about 50%
smaller than genomes of free-living relatives. However,
compared to some obligate symbionts of insects [24-27],
B. rhizoxinica has a 3-4 times larger genome (Table 1).
The whole genome consists of 3878 ORFs, 2437 (62.2%)
of which were assigned a biological function. Among
the 1441 ORFs without known function, 897 show similarity to other database entries, while 544 remain without function and similarity.
Whole genome BLASTP analysis confirmed that the
phylogenetic origin of >67% of deduced ORFs lies within
the b-proteobacteria (Figure 2a). The distribution of best
hits within the genus Burkholderia is shown in Figure 2c.
Hits to other phyla might suggest some horizontal gene
transfer. Five deduced proteins have best hits to eukaryotic genes, however, these do not deliver evidence for horizontal transfer of host genes to the symbiont genome.

genome. Blue: Open reading frames. Black: G+C content. Green:
positive GC-skew. Violet: negative GC-skew. Simple circular
representations indicate the correct size scale for megaplasmid
pBRH01 and plasmid pBRH02. The chromosome exhibits a smooth
GC-skew pattern, whose origin is located some 50 kb upstream of
the dnaA gene. The observed shift is presumably due to a insertion
of a prophage next to the origin of replication.

Synteny plots of the chromosome indicate that the
endobacteria possess a typical member of the chromosome I family of Burkholderia (Figure 2b). The plasmids
pBRH01 and pBRH02 appear to represent strain-specific
elements. Because of its relatively small size and its lack
of structural RNA genes, we regard the megaplasmid as
a plasmid rather than a secondary chromosome, which
are regularly found in Burkholderia genomes [28]. Much
like other secondary chromosomes and plasmids of Burkholderia species, they presumably depend on a ParA/B
partitioning system [29]. ParB protein encoded on
pBRH01 aligns well with homologs found on other Burkholderia replicons. However, a phylogenetic analysis
(Additional file 1, Figure S1) did not reveal further
details about the origin of the megaplasmid, suggesting
that it has split off early in the evolution of Burkholderia
plasmids and chromosomes. ParB of plasmid pBRH02 is
significantly more distantly related to other known partitioning proteins with its closest homolog found in the gproteobacterium Enhydrobacter aerosaccus (Additional
file 1, Figure S1).
In order to obtain a subset of gene families characteristic for endofungal symbionts we conducted comparative analyses by computation of similarity clusters
with related Burkholderia species. As an example we
chose the apathogenic, free-living soil bacterium B.
thailandensis E264 and the obligate animal pathogen
B. mallei for comparative studies (Figure 2d). While
1311 ortholog clusters are shared by all three organisms, 1194 ORFs are exclusively present in B. rhizoxinica encompassing 30.8% of its genes. B. rhizoxinica

specific genes comprise 939 (78,6%) hypothetical proteins. We assume that some strain-specific genetic
material of unknown function is associated with the
development of endofungal lifestyle. Among the 255
genes with a proposed function, a large proportion
appears to be mobile genetic elements such as 55
transposase genes (21, 6%), 77 phage component genes
(30, 2%) and 16 genes coding for plasmid stability systems (6,3%).

B. rhizoxinica genome is in a process of genome erosion. In some endosymbionts like Sodalis glossninidius,
a maternally transmitted symbiont of tsetse flies, genome erosion is connected to a high number of pseudogenes [33]. Indeed, especially genes coding for mobile
genetic elements appear to be truncated or disrupted in
the B. rhizoxinica genome as well. However, an exact
estimation of the number of pseudogenes is difficult,
since well studied reference organisms with a comparable gene set are not available.

Mobile Genetic Elements and Pseudogenes

The B. rhizoxinica genome is disrupted by a considerable amount of potentially mobile genetic elements with
231 ORFs (6.0%) encoding proteins with similarity to
transposases or inactivated derivatives. Although it is
unknown how many of these form parts of active insertion elements, this number is high compared to other
sequenced Burkholderia species (Table 1). This finding
is in agreement with the hypothesis that intracellular
bacteria have a tendency to accumulate transposons in
early stages of the symbiosis [30]. Besides the shear
number of transposons, there are numerous genes for
plasmid stability proteins, reverse transcriptases, and
phage proteins. The genetic evidence supporting recent
exposure to foreign DNA contrasts obligate endosymbionts like Buchnera [25,27,30] that have been living
genetically isolated for a long evolutionary period. B.
rhizoxinica contains several predicted toxin-antitoxin
(TA) systems including RelE, MazF and PIN domain
proteins encoding genes. These factors mediate stability
of plasmids and other mobile elements by imposing an
addiction-like mechanism to the host and are widespread in prokaryotic genomes [31]. However, besides
their rather selfish role in genetic addiction these factors
have been proposed to mediate growth retardation
under stress conditions [32]. Thus, the abundance of
TA systems might be important for endofungal growth
control in certain stages of host colonization.
The high number of insertion elements combined with
reduced genome size delivers evidence that the

Primary Metabolic Capabilities and Uptake of Nutrients

Two of the key questions concerning the endofungal
lifestyle of B. rhizoxinica are, âHow do endobacteria
exchange metabolites with their fungal host and are
they producers or consumers of certain nutrients and
cofactors?â. To conceive a model for metabolic processes that may govern the intracellular lifestyle of B.
rhizoxinica, we deduced metabolic pathways for primary
metabolism, cofactor biosynthesis and membrane transport. From previous studies, it was known that B. rhizoxinica does not consume glucose, but instead prefers
glycerol as a carbon source in pure culture [10]. In
accordance to this finding, we found three genes encoding glycerol kinases and a putative glycerol uptake facilitator. On the contrary, no genes for glucose transporters
could be found in the genome [23]. Since we could
deduce all enzymes required for a functional EntnerDoudoroff pathway, we suspect that this pathway is
used for gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, genes dedicated
to ethanol assimilation and import of organic acids such
as citrate and C4-dicarboxylates (malate, fumarate, succinate) are present in the genome. This finding suggests
that B. rhizoxinica can take up citrate, malate, glycerol
or ethanol during its intracellular life and it has been
reported that Rhizopus produces ethanol and glycerol
when grown on various sugars or wood hydrolysates
[34]. Regarding intracellular energy metabolism, the presence of a gene coding for a putative ATP/ADP antiporter (RBRH_01687) on the megaplasmid is intriguing and

it might enable endobacteria to directly withdraw energy
equivalents from the cytosol of their host. While missing
in other sequenced Burkholderia strains, such specialized forms of antiporters are found in obligate intracellular pathogens such as Rickettsia [35] or the plant
pathogen Xylella fastidiosa [36]. The presence of the
ATP/ADP antiporter demonstrates the thin line between
parasitic and mutualistic lifestyle.
For amino acid metabolism, B. rhizoxinica harbors
genes responsible for importing branched-chain and
aromatic amino acids, histidine, acidic amino acids and
glycine. Furthermore, the genome encodes biosynthetic

routes for all proteinogenic amino acids and efflux systems for basic amino acids and cystein. We suspect that
amino acid transporters were adapted to the metabolic
situation during symbiosis. In addition to amino acid
transporters, the endosymbiont genome contains genes
for dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems. B. rhizoxinica harbors genes dedicated to the biosynthesis of the
essential cofactors like pyridoxin, heme, flavin, biotin
and thiamine. Combined with the previously mentioned
amino acid pathways, this finding reflects the observed
ability of isolated strains to grow in relatively nutrient
poor mineral salt media. Transport processes for

Lackner et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:210
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/210

cofactors, however, could not be inferred by genomic
data, except for a putative cobalamin transport system.
Concerning trace elements, B. rhizoxinica harbors
uptake systems for iron-siderophores, iron, magnesium/
cobalt, manganese, zinc, potassium and a sodium/calcium antiporter.
Secondary Metabolic Potential

B. rhizoxinica is known for its capacity to produce the
antimitotic polyketide rhizoxin, the virulence factor of R.
microsporus [8,20]. The genomic locus for rhizoxin biosynthesis (rhi) that encodes a hybrid system of nonribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase
(NRPS/PKS), was recently discovered [9]. Functional
analyses unveiled several unprecedented features of this
thiotemplate system [37-39]. Full genome sequencing
has now revealed that the rhi locus is encoded on the
large chromosome and neither of the megaplasmids,
however, since the rhi gene cluster is flanked by transposase genes, it may represent a potentially mobile
region of the genome.[23]. Additionally, a highly homologous gene cluster has been discovered in Pseudomonas
fluorescens Pf-5 and shown to be responsible for rhizoxin production [40,41]. Analysis of compositional
nucleotide bias and its location near the chromosomal
terminus of replication further supports the hypothesis
that the gene cluster has been horizontally acquired by
B. rhizoxinica. However, the overall G+C content clearly
disagrees with a direct transfer between ancestors of the
two species. While the G+C content of the B. rhizoxinica gene cluster is lower than the genome average
(58.3% versus 60.2%), the G+C content of the P. fluorescens cluster is higher than the genome average (65.5%
versus 63.3%). From a phylogenetic point of view it is
intriguing that we encountered a stretch of 160 bp
(rhiFâ) on the megaplasmid exhibiting high sequence
similarity with the end of the rhizoxin biosynthesis gene
cluster (rhiF). Hence, we suspect that the rhizoxin gene
cluster might have been transferred from the megaplasmid to the chromosome, where it effectively represents
an insertion of a genomic island. The neighboring gene
of rhiFâ on the megaplasmid codes for a putative drug
exporter of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) [42],
which has a homolog in P. fluorescens Pf-5. Therefore, it
is possible that this gene is involved in rhizoxin export
and was previously part of the B. rhizoxinica rhi gene
cluster. However, B. rhizoxinica harbors a variety of
efflux pumps including macrolide-specific ABC-transporters (see below), which could accomplish toxin delivery to the host fungus. Furthermore, NRPS/PKS systems
require a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPtase)
responsible for activation of the acyl and peptidyl carrier
protein domains. Whole genome data enabled us to
identify a single open reading frame encoding a PPtase

Page 5 of 13

[43] on the megaplasmid (brp, RBRH_02776) that may
function in this capacity. Apart from the conserved
holo-ACP synthase (ACPS) gene, which is typically
essential for the activation of fatty acid synthases, this is
the only gene with significant similarity to known PPtase
genes.
In addition to the rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster,
B. rhizoxinica harbors 14 non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters (Figure 3). NRPSs are giant
multimodular enzymes [23]. Each module typically catalyzes incorporation of one amino acid into the peptide
product [44]. The gene clusters and the module architecture of their corresponding NRPS systems are summarized in Figure 3. There are two gene clusters coding
for octamodular NRPSs. One of the deduced assembly
lines is equipped with three additional methylation
domains that catalyze N-methylation of the incorporated
amino acid. Another NRPS is encoded by the longest
ORF in the genome, which has a total length of 23.3 kb.
Notably, the total DNA of all PKS and NRPS loci sums
up to 322 kb, covering 9% of the whole genomic
sequence. In addition, the megaplasmid bears a gene
related to lantibiotic biosynthesis (RBRH_00226), whose
closest homolog is found in cyanobacteria [45]. However, its function is unclear, since it is not flanked by
genes for secretion or leader peptide processing. Taken
together, this considerable biosynthetic potential is surprising, since no peptides corresponding to the gene
clusters could be isolated from B. rhizoxinica up to
now. We hypothesize that some NRPS products may
function as siderophores or antibiotics. It is well conceivable that peptides serve as signal molecules, effectors in
bacterial-fungal interaction or support virulence of the
phytopathogenic host fungus.
Lipopolysaccharides and Exopolysaccharides

Carbohydrate-derived surface determinants of Gramnegative bacteria, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and
exopolysaccharides have a major impact in recognition
processes [46] and could also play a role in the Burkholderia-Rhizopus symbiosis. Recently, we have identified a
gene cluster that is involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
biosynthesis in B. rhizoxinica and solved the chemical
structure of the LPS [47]. The homopolymeric O-antigen consists of 2-substituted D-galactofuranose, [Â®2)-bD-Galf-(1Â®]n and has been shown to be important for
stability of the symbiosis. Deletion of the O-antigen
ligase gene waaL resulted in drastically decreased ability
of endosymbionts to form stable symbiosis with host
fungi. Besides possessing genes responsible for the biosynthesis of homopolymeric O-antigen LPS, which is
dependent on an ABC- transporter [48], genome
sequencing revealed genes that could enable B. rhizoxinica to produce exopolysaccharide (EPS) or type I

capsular polysaccharides [49]. Such a system requires
the antigen flippase and polymerase genes wzx and wzy
as well as genes for the trans-envelope transport complex Wza, Wzb, Wzc, and a dedicated glycosyl transferase. The homologs of Wzx (RBRH_01445,
RBRH_03897), Wzy (RBRH_00521) and Wzb
(RBRH_03824) are encoded on different loci on the
chromosome. On the megaplasmid we identified a locus
for capsular or exopolysaccharide biosynthesis including
two glycosyltransferase genes dedicated to undecaprenyl
phosphate loading, the transport complex genes wza
(RBRH_00520), wzc (RBRH_00521) and a putative mannosyl transferase gene (RBRH_00522). Surface polysaccharides represent important symbiosis factors in some
rhizobia [50,51] and we therefore suspect that they also
mediate or support the Burkholderia-Rhizopus
symbiosis.
Antibiotic Resistance and Efflux Pumps

Burkholderia rhizoxinica is naturally resistant against
various b-lactams including ampicillin, penicillin G and
meticillin, but not against imipenem [10]. This result
gives hints about the substrate specificity of a b-lactamase (RBRH_02672) encoded in the genome that is
related to other Burkholderia b-lactamases [52]. Furthermore, B. rhizoxinica has the genetic repertoire for a
broad variety of efflux pumps, including four members
of the RND superfamily, six members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily and five representatives
of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (Additional
file 2, Table S1). These systems transport low molecular
weight compounds out of the cytosol of gram-negative
bacteria, thus conferring resistance to antibacterial substances [42]. It is possible that efflux pumps are essential
for an endofungal lifestyle, since they might expel fungal
defense molecules. Another hypothetical function of
efflux pumps of the RND superfamily is the export of
virulence factors (type I secretion), a process that might
be relevant for bacterial-fungal interaction.
Protein Secretion Systems and Effector Proteins

One important mechanism of host control is secretion
of effector proteins into host cells. Thus, we examined
the genome for genes coding for further putative protein
secretion systems, which are likely to be involved in host
infection and control. B. rhizoxinica contains both the
Sec and Tat pathways for transport of proteins into the
periplasm. One route of export is the general secretion
pathway or type II secretion [53] pathway that is present
in B. rhizoxinica (RBRH_00771 - RBRH_00782). A type
III secretion system (T3SS), whose coding gene cluster
is located on the megaplasmid, has already been shown
to play a crucial role for the establishment of the symbiosis [54]. T3SSs form huge membrane complexes that

Page 7 of 13

typically secrete effector proteins directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. A putative type IV secretion
system (T4SS) is encoded on the 172 kb plasmid
pBRH02 [23]. T4SS are related to conjugation machines
(tra genes) and deliver DNA and/or proteins into recipient cells [55]. Notably, the B. rhizoxinica T4SS is related
to a plasmid encoded T4SS from B. cenocepacia J2314.
This system was shown to be involved in a plant pathogenicity phenotype of B. cenocepacia [56].
In order to understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying the bacterial-fungal interaction particular
proteins secreted by the various secretion systems need
to be identified. Generally, T2SS are dedicated to the
secretion of toxins and lytic proteins [53] into the extracellular milieu. To address this question we performed a
prediction analysis of proteins bearing a signal peptide
for Sec-dependent export to the periplasm (Additional
file 3, Table S2). Though the presence of a signal peptide is a general feature of both periplasmatic and
secreted proteins, it can give hints on putative type II
secreted proteins. Intriguingly, we found chitinase
(RBRH_02666), chitosanase (RBRH_02856) and a putative chitin-binding protein (RBRH_01547) in the pool of
Sec-exported proteins. Given the fact that chitin is a
constituent of the fungal cell wall [57,58], it is plausible
that chitinase is involved in the penetration of fungal
hyphae during infection. A chitinase (ChiA) has already
been shown to be secreted via a type II secretion system
in E. coli K-12 [59]. Chitinolytic enzymes could furthermore influence cell wall remodeling during growth or
sporulation of R. microsporus as reported for Aspergillus
species [57]. The chitin-binding protein might facilitate
symbiont attachment to fungal cell walls or assist in
directing chitinolytic enzymes to their substrate. In addition, the signal peptide prediction revealed putative virulence factors including peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
isomerases (RBRH_01604, RBRH_03962). These
enzymes have been shown to enhance virulence of plant
and human pathogens [60,61]. Also, a tetratricopetide
protein (RBRH_03961) and an ankyrin repeat protein
(RBRH_01579) bear signal peptides. Both protein
families are involved in protein-protein interaction and
represent good candidates for host interaction factors
[62]. Notably, ankyrin repeat proteins are abundant in
Wolbachia symbionts of insects [63].
Furthermore, we performed a prediction of type III
secreted proteins encoded in the genome using the
EFFECTIVET3[64] software package (Additional file 4,
Table S3). Though these results have to be interpreted
with cation, the prediction suggests that key enzymes of
essential metabolic pathways are secreted. Among them
are enzymes catalyzing crucial steps in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis (e.g. aspartate carbamoyl transferase), as well as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the

Lackner et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:210
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/210

gatekeeper to pentose phosphate pathway, which delivers ribose building blocks and NADPH for nucleotide
biosynthesis. Another predicted effector protein, ribonucleotide reductase, is a key enzyme in DNA synthesis,
while serine hydroxymethyltransferase produces 5,10methylene tetrahydrofolate, which is an important
source of C1 units for purine and thymidylate synthesis.
Furthermore, the first enzyme for branched-chain amino
acid biosynthesis (acetolactate synthase) and enzymes
for aromatic amino acid (chorismate synthase), as well
as arginine biosynthesis, are predicted to be released
into the hostâs cytosol. In addition, the predicted type III
secretome comprises enzymes for heme biosynthesis.
Last but not least, some predicted type III effectors
represent constituents of the mevalonate-independent
isoprenoid pathway including the gate-keeping 1-deoxyD-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase and a putative squalene-hopene cyclase. These findings suggests that terpenoids (e.g. ergosterol) might play a role during bacterialfungal interaction.
The prediction of factors that are substrates of the
plasmid encoded T4SS is not feasible with current
bioinformatic methods. However, the plasmid carries a
gene cluster encoding three large hypothetical proteins
without assigned function. One of them (RBRH_03371)
has a single phospholipase D domain. Phospholipase D
is important in eukaryotic signaling pathways and
known to be secreted by pathogens like Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis [65]. However, we cannot
exclude that the T4SS simply contributes to mobilization of the plasmid pBR02.
Pilus Formation and Adhesion Proteins, and Insecticidal
Toxin Complexes

B. rhizoxinica harbors several gene clusters related to
pilus formation and adhesion. We identified several
genes coding for biogenesis proteins of type IV pili
including pilin precursor (PilA, RBRH_01328), NTPbinding protein (PilB, RBRH_03238), signal peptidase
(PilD, RBRH_03240), secretin (PilQ, RBRH_02326) and
ATPase (PilM, RBRH_02329) scattered over the chromosome. Type IV pilus-like structures might play a role
in adhesion to host surfaces. However, the pilus lacks
motor protein PilT and other accessory proteins. This
explains why B. rhizoxinica cannot use pili for twitching
motility. In addition, there is a locus on the chromosome encoding a fimbrial usher (RBRH_01934) protein
[66]. These outer membrane proteins mediate export of
folded proteins across the outer membrane, often
involved in assembly of surface structures like fimbriae.
Furthermore, we identified adhesion dedicated genes
coding for proteins related to hemolysins or filamentous
hemagglutinin-like proteins (RBRH_00100, RBRH_04156
and RBRH_03315). They are clustered together with

Page 8 of 13

their corresponding secretion proteins forming a twopartner or type Vb secretion system. The giant (ca. 3
kb) hemolysin gene products are remotely related to a
HecA-homolog from Xylella fastidiosa, which has been
shown to be involved in plant pathogenicity [67]. Small
parts of these genes are duplicated in the genome of B.
rhizoxinica, possibly representing nonfunctional repetitive elements. Intriguingly, one hemolysin gene cluster is
located next to the rhizoxin biosynthesis locus on the
chromosome. Additionally, we identified two putative
surface-associated
proteins
(RBRH_03838,
RBRH_03272), which contain YadA domains and thus
represent potential autotransporters or type Va secretion
systems. [68]. It is therefore conceivable that endobacteria require a repertoire of surface proteins for their
attachment to fungal surfaces during infection and
transmission processes.
Another rather unexpected finding, again in the neighborhood of the rhizoxin locus (RBRH_02570 RBRH_2567), is a gene cluster coding for homologs of
an insecticidal toxin complex (tc) from Photorhabdus
luminescens [69]. Though the presence of another tc
cluster on the megaplasmid (RBRH_00589 RBRH_00598) might be an indication for the relevance
of these proteins, their role in endofungal bacteria is
unclear.
Transcriptional Regulators and a Lack of Quorum Sensing
Systems

The B. rhizoxinica genome contains 193 transcriptional
regulator genes (5% of all genes). This number is low
when compared to genomes of free-living bacteria,
which contain about 10% regulator genes (Table 1).
This finding likely reflects a reduced need of endobacteria to adjust to varying environmental stresses and
conditions. Compared to highly adapted endosymbionts,
however, the loss of regulators is moderate. The Wolbachia endosymbiont of B. malayi (wBM), for instance
retained only eight (1%) genes coding for transcriptional
regulators, thus exhibiting a tremendously stronger loss
of regulatory elements, which further supports the âgenome in transitionâ hypothesis for B. rhizoxinica.
Toxin production and host manipulation by bacteria
often depends on quorum sensing (QS), [70], a process
where bacteria sense their own density or secretion efficiency by small molecules like N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs). Though these processes have been
suggested to trigger toxin production and host interaction of B. rhizoxinica [71], its genome apparently lacks
common genes responsible for the synthesis of quorum
sensing autoinducers. Homologs of the AHL synthase
gene, luxI, are regularly found in related Burkholderia
species [72], yet they are missing in B. rhizoxinica.
Furthermore, no regulators of the luxR family possessing

Lackner et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:210
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/210

the autoinducer binding domain (pfam03472) could be
identified in the genome. Only three genes encoding
regulatory proteins with a C-terminal LuxR DNA-binding domain are present. However, a more extensive
search for other known QS system components did not
reveal any QS candidate genes, either. The endosymbionts lack homologs of luxM and luxS, which are
responsible for the biosynthesis of autoinducer-1 (AI-1)
and AI-2 in Vibrio harveyi [70], respectively, as well as
the Phc cell density sensing system found in Ralstonia
[73] and Cupriavidus [74]. Neither genes for biosynthesis of quinoline signal molecules known from B. thailandensis nor a close homolog of BCAM0581
responsible for cis-2-dodecenoic acid formation in B.
cenocepacia [75] could be identified. The role of QS in
endosymbiosis is not fully understood. Primary and
many secondary endosymbionts of insects like Buchnera
and Wolbachia lack QS-related genes [24,25]. However,
some secondary symbionts descending from pathogens
like Hamiltonella defensa or Sodalis glossinidius do
encode genes for AHL synthases [76]. Intracellular bacteria might have reduced needs for efficiency sensing,
since secreted effectors are directly released into the
cytosol [77]. In case of endofungal bacteria, classical QS
signals might have become obsolete, because they might
be quenched by the host [78]. However, we cannot rule
out the possibility that B. rhizoxinica does harbor an
exceptional type of QS system, since growth rate and
formation of biofilm-like structures in pure culture
seem to depend on cell density. Given the high number
of NRPS gene clusters in the genome, it is conceivable
that short cyclic peptides function as signal molecules as
it was reported for P. aeruginosa [79].

Conclusions
Many bacterial species colonize niches within eukaryotic
host organisms as endosymbionts. Excellent studies of
bacterial mutualists both of plants [51] and animals [80]
have been described on genomic level in detail. Recent
publications of symbiont genomes include symbionts of
host species ranging from plants [81] to marine microalgae [82] and amoebae [83].
However, symbionts of fungal species have long been
a widely neglected area of research, although they have
important implications for agriculture, biotechnology
and food safety [13,84-86]. Here, we analyse the whole
genome of Burkholderia rhizoxinica, which has been
sequenced recently [23]. It is the first reported genome
sequence of a mutualistic Burkholderia sp., and the first
one of a bacterial endosymbiont of a fungus. The complete genome sequence provides unprecedented insights
into the molecular equipment of a specialized symbiont
that has most likely evolved via a parasitism-mutualism
shift. B. rhizoxinica exhibits a âgenome in transitionâ [80]

Page 9 of 13

that is in an early stage of adaptation to the intracellular
niche. Loss of sugar importers, in combination with the
presence of citrate and dicarboxylate importers as well
as a putative ATP/ADP antiporter suggest a metabolic
adaptation towards an intracellular lifestyle (Figure 4).
In contrast, B. rhizoxincia has retained biosynthetic
pathways for the production of all proteinogenic amino
acids and several important cofactors, which might be
delivered to the fungus. Apart from the well-investigated
rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster, B. rhizoxinica has a
considerable biosynthetic potential for secondary metabolite production, namely NRPS gene clusters. Future
projects may reveal the exact nature and bioactivity of
these corresponding peptides. We speculate that some
of these molecules play a role in communication processes, either among endobacteria themselves or
between bacteria and fungi.
The fact that B. rhizoxinica survives within the hostâs
cytosol and is able to invade the host under laboratory
conditions suggested that B. rhizoxinica harbors specialized virulence-related factors for host manipulation and
evasion of defense mechanisms. Indeed, we could identify members of the three multi-component secretion
systems (type II, III and IV) and further putative factors
for host manipulation and defense (Figure 4). Taken
together, with this work, we hope to inspire two historically discrete scientific communities. On the one hand
B. rhizoxinica can serve as a model system for microbial
communication, infection and symbiosis. One the other
hand, from a biotechnological point of view, the organism can be used for genome mining approaches and
pathway engineering towards medically relevant rhizoxin
derivatives. Overall, the whole genome sequence of B.
rhizoxinica grants fascinating insights into the evolution
and the genetic potential of endofungal bacteria and
delivers an excellent basis for further investigations of
bacterial-fungal interactions.

Methods
