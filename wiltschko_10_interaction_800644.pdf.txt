Interaction of magnetite-based receptors in the
beak with the visual system underlying ‘fixed
direction’ responses in birds

Abstract
Background: European robins, Erithacus rubecula, show two types of directional responses to the magnetic field:
(1) compass orientation that is based on radical pair processes and lateralized in favor of the right eye and (2) socalled ‘fixed direction’ responses that originate in the magnetite-based receptors in the upper beak. Both responses
are light-dependent. Lateralization of the ‘fixed direction’ responses would suggest an interaction between the two
magnetoreception systems.
Results: Robins were tested with either the right or the left eye covered or with both eyes uncovered for their
orientation under different light conditions. With 502 nm turquoise light, the birds showed normal compass
orientation, whereas they displayed an easterly ‘fixed direction’ response under a combination of 502 nm turquoise
with 590 nm yellow light. Monocularly right-eyed birds with their left eye covered were oriented just as they were
binocularly as controls: under turquoise in their northerly migratory direction, under turquoise-and-yellow towards
east. The response of monocularly left-eyed birds differed: under turquoise light, they were disoriented, reflecting a
lateralization of the magnetic compass system in favor of the right eye, whereas they continued to head eastward
under turquoise-and-yellow light.
Conclusion: ’Fixed direction’ responses are not lateralized. Hence the interactions between the magnetitereceptors in the beak and the visual system do not seem to involve the magnetoreception system based on
radical pair processes, but rather other, non-lateralized components of the visual system.

Background
In migratory birds, two types of directional responses to
the magnetic field have been observed, namely normal
compass orientation and, under certain unnatural light
conditions, so-called ’fixed direction’ responses (for
review, see [1]). Both these behaviors differ in many
aspects; they originate in different magnetoreceptors
based on different biophysical mechanisms: compass
orientation, controlled by the avian inclination compass,
is mediated by radical-pair processes [2-4] in the eye
[5]; it is this system that provides birds with directional
orientation to locate their home direction, migratory
direction or any acquired directions. ‘Fixed direction’
responses, in contrast, are polar [1,6] and originate in

the magnetite-based receptors in the upper beak [7-10].
Their behavioral significance is unclear, as they so far
have been observed only under conditions that do not
occur in nature. Normally the receptors in the beak
appear to mediate magnetic ‘map’ information [11,12];
their additionally providing directing information might
be a phylogenetic relict from an ancient compass
mechanism that has now been replaced by the radicalpair mechanism in birds (see [1] for discussion).
Both responses-compass orientation as well as ‘fixed
directions’-are light-dependent, but also their light-dependency is fundamentally different. Compass orientation
occurs under ‘white’ light (e.g. light composed more or
less of the full spectrum) and under low intensity monochromatic light from the short-wavelength part of the
spectrum up to 565 nm green [1]. If light conditions meet
these requirements, the specific directions no longer
depend on the light regime, but on the goal the birds are

trying to reach. ‘Fixed direction’ responses, in contrast,
have been observed under bright monochromatic light,
bichromatic light with a long-wavelength component and
in total darkness, and their manifestation depends on the
ambient light regime [1]: different light conditions lead to
headings in different directions: e.g. European robins,
Erithacus rubecula, headed north under a combination of
green-and-yellow light and south under blue-and-yellow
light, regardless of season [1,13].
The observation that the ‘fixed directions’ depend on
the ambient light regime was rather surprising, because
one would not have expected magnetite-based receptors
to be influenced by light. The findings mentioned above
indicate connections with the visual system: obviously,
the visual system is involved in controlling the specific
‘fixed direction’ emerging under a given light condition.
This raises the question about the nature of this interaction. The magnetite-based receptors provide directing
input, which, however, does not seem to tell birds compass directions as it cannot be used to locate the migratory direction. The ambient light conditions modify this
input in a specific way, depending on the wavelengths
or wavelengths-composition of the light, and make the
birds head in a specific direction. Two types of interactions with the visual system seem possible: (1) the input
from the receptors in the beak could interact with information from the magnetoreception system in the eye
that normally provides birds with directional information, or (2) it could interact with other parts of the
visual system. To answer this question, we made use of
the finding that compass orientation, like many other
features associated with the eyes and vision (for review,
see [14]) is lateralized in favor of the right eye [5,15,16].
We tested birds monocularly, i.e. with one eye covered.
If the ‘fixed direction’ responses were likewise found to
be lateralized, this would suggest an interaction between
the two magnetoreception systems, while finding the
‘fixed direction’ responses not lateralized would indicate
interactions of the magnetite receptors with non-lateralized components of the visual system.

until beginning of December, when it was reduced to L:
D 8:16 h. One week before the tests began, the light
period was increased in two steps to L:D 13:11 to induce
premature Zugunruhe (migratory restlessness) that
allowed us to test the birds in spring migratory state
already in January.
For the monocular tests, we used the same method as
described by [5]: a small aluminum cap covered the eye,
fixed to the bird’s head with adhesive tape (Leukoplast).
This cap was placed either over the right or the left eye
immediately before the test and removed as soon as the
test was over. Birds to be tested binocularly received no
treatment.
All tests took place in wooden houses in the garden of
the Zoological Institute where the geomagnetic field was
largely undisturbed. Testing began when the light went
off in the housing cages, and lasted about 1 h. The birds
were tested one at a time in funnel cages lined with
thermo-paper (Blumberg Systempapiere), where they left
marks as they moved. Each funnel cage was placed in a
light-proof cylinder isolating it from the others.
Light conditions

Methods
The respective experiments were performed in Frankfurt
am Main, Germany (50°08′N, 8°40′E), from 11 January
to 21 February 2010, in the local geomagnetic field of
47 μT, 66° inclination.

For compass orientation, we used turquoise light; for a
‘fixed direction’ response, we choose the easterly one
observed under a combination of turquoise-and-yellow
light. Both these light conditions have been analyzed in
detail in previous studies, and both have been found to
show the typical characteristics of the respective type of
response (see [1]).
The test lights were produced by light-emitting diodes
(LEDs) mounted on a plastic disk that covered the top
of the cylinder. Their light passed two diffusers before it
reached the bird in the cage. Turquoise light had a peak
wavelength of 502 nm (half band-width 486-518 nm)
with an irradiance of 2.1 mW/m 2 corresponding to
5.3 1015 quanta s-1 m-2 measured within the test cage;
the turquoise-and-yellow light was a combination of the
502 nm turquoise light described above with 590 nm
yellow light (half band-width 572-609 nm) and an irradiance of 1.8 mW/m2 so that both components had equal
quantal flux of 5.3 1015 quanta s-1 m-2. Each bird was
tested three times in each condition (and in three others
belonging to another study), alternating between the
conditions in a pseudo-random sequence. The binocular
test under 502 nm turquoise light served as control.

Test birds and test performance

Data analysis and statistics

The test birds were European robins, nocturnal migrants
that breed in most parts of Europe and winter in the
Mediterranean countries. They were caught as juvenile
transmigrants, probably of Scandinavian origin, in September in the Botanical Garden in Frankfurt and kept
over the winter. The photoperiod simulated the natural

For data analysis, the thermo-paper was removed, divided
into 24 sectors, and the scratch marks in each sector were
counted double blind. Recordings with a total of fewer
than 35 scratches were excluded from the analysis and
were repeated. From the distribution of the activity within
the cage, the heading of the respective test was calculated,

and from the three headings of each bird, we calculated
the respective mean vector of that bird with the direction
ab and the length rb. The mean headings ab of the 12 test
birds were comprised in the grand mean vector for each
condition, with the direction aN and the length rN, which
were tested by the Rayleigh test for significant directional
preferences [17]. The data sets under turquoise and turquoise-and-yellow light were compared by the Watson
Williams Test for differences in direction [17]; the birds’
orientation in the monocular conditions were compared
with that in the binocular one under the same light regime
with the non-parametric Mann Whitney U-test applied to
the angular deviation of each bird’s mean from the grand
mean direction to test for differences in variance. From
the vector length rb the median was calculated to reflect
the intra-individual variance, and the data of the monocular tests were compared with those from the respective
binocular sets using the Wilcoxon test for matched
samples.

conditions; Tables 2 and 3 list the behavior of the individual birds under turquoise and turquoise-and-yellow
light, respectively. Under 502 nm turquoise light, the
robins were oriented in their seasonally appropriate
northerly migratory direction slightly east of north;
under turquoise-and-yellow light, in contrast, they preferred easterly headings in a ‘fixed direction’ response
that is significantly different from the migratory direction (F = 7.511, p < 0.05, Watson Williams test).
Monocularly right-eyed robins with their left eye covered showed no effect of the treatment under either
light regime. Covering the right eye, in contrast, led to
disorientation under turquoise light, while it had no
effect on the robins’ behavior under turquoise-andyellow light.
In summary, while the compass orientation under turquoise light broke down when the birds had to rely on
their left eye alone, the orientation under turquoise-andyellow light remained unaffected.

Results
The results are shown in Fig. 1, with Table 1 giving the
numerical data and the statistical differences between

Discussion
Compass orientation again proved to be lateralized in
favor of the right eye. So far, lateralization of the

magnetic compass had only been demonstrated under
565 nm green light in robins [5,16] and under white
light in Australian silvereyes, Zosterops l. lateralis [15],
robins (unpublished), domestic chickens, Gallus gallus
[18] and homing pigeons, Columba livia domestica [19]
(but see [20]); the present data are the first obtained
under monochromatic 502 nm turquoise light. As long
as the magnetic compass is properly working, it appears
to be lateralized in favor of the right eye, irrespective of
the light regime. Where this lateralization occurs-at the
periphery or in higher centers in the brain-is not yet
known with certainty. The asymmetrical structures in
the avian visual system (see e.g. [14,21,22]), however,
make a lateralization in higher centers most likely.
’Fixed direction’ responses, in contrast, do not seem to
be lateralized-for them, the input of both eyes appears
to be equal. This speaks against an interaction of the
receptors in the beak with the radical pair mechanism
in the right eye system for the manifestation of the
‘fixed direction’; rather, the specific directions seem to
arise from interactions of these magnetite-based receptors with visual input that is processed in a non-lateralized way. For example, at least in pigeons, feature-based

object vision is lateralized towards the left hemisphere,
while spatial orientation by using a global reference
frame is not processed in an asymmetrical way. As a
result, pigeons show right-eye superiority when using
prominent landmarks for orientation, while they display
no left-right differences when relying on a general spatial reference system [23,24].
The general influence of the visual system on magnetoreception is still poorly understood. Contour vision
plays an important role in magnetoreception, probably
in distinguishing modulations of activity caused by magnetic input of the radical pair processes from that of
objects represented by visual input [16]. The light condition leading to a disruption of compass orientation and
the emergence of ‘fixed direction’ responses do not
seem to interfere with the radical pair processes underlying the compass themselves-the radical pair mechanism should still be functioning. We must assume that
some processes in the visual system interact with the
magnetic compass system at a higher level in the brain
to deactivate the respective magnetic information (see
[1] for discussion). In this case, however, the magnetoreception system in the eye is involved, with the

respective directional information mediated by the optic
nerve and processed by parts of the visual system (e.g.
[25-27], so that interactions with visual input is easily
conceivable.
Any information from the magnetite-based receptors
in the beak, on the other hand, is transported to the
brain by the ophthalmic nerve, part of the trigeminal
system (e.g. [28-31]). The directing information from
these receptors must be combined with visual input to
produce the specific ‘fixed direction’ observed under the
respective light regime. In birds, trigeminal information
from the nucleus principalis trigemini of the brainstem
directly reaches the nucleus basorostralis (Bas) of the
telencephalon, bypassing the diencephalon [32-34]. After
being processed within the Bas and its associative surrounding, trigeminal information is conveyed towards
the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) and the arcopallium intermedium (AI) in the caudal telencephalon.
Both NCL and AI also receive afferents from the telencephalic sources of the thalamo-and tectofugal visual
systems [35]. One of the major descending motor pathways that controls important aspects of the movement
patterns in birds arises from AI [33]. Thus, both NCL
and AI could constitute the critical structures for the
integration of magnetite-based trigeminal information
and vision, reflected in the ‘fixed direction’ responses.

Conclusion
Our data show that ‘fixed direction’ responses are not
lateralized. This suggests that the interactions between
the magnetite-receptors in the beak and the visual system occurring at higher levels in the brain, do not
involve the magnetoreception system based on radical
pair process in the right eye, but rather other, non-lateralized components of the visual system.
