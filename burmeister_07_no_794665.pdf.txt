Abstract
Background: The Deltaretrovirus genus comprises viruses that infect humans (HTLV), various
simian species (STLV) and cattle (BLV). HTLV-I is the main causative agent in adult T-cell leukemia
in endemic areas and some of the simian T-cell lymphotropic viruses have been implicated in the
induction of malignant lymphomas in their hosts. BLV causes enzootic bovine leukosis in infected
cattle or sheep. During the past few years several new Deltaretrovirus isolates have been described
in various primate species. Two new HTLV-like viruses in humans have recently been identified and
provisionally termed HTLV-III and HTLV-IV. In order to identify a broad spectrum of
Deltaretroviruses by a single PCR approach we have established a novel consensus PCR based on
nucleotide sequence data obtained from 42 complete virus isolates (HTLV-I/-II, STLV-I/-II/-III, BLV).
The primer sequences were based on highly interspecies-conserved virus genome regions. We
used this PCR to detect Deltaretroviruses in samples from adult patients with a variety of rare Tcell neoplasms in Germany.
Results: The sensitivity of the consensus PCR was at least between 10-2 and 10-3 with 100%
specificity as demonstrated by serial dilutions of cell lines infected with either HTLV-I, HTLV-II or
BLV. Fifty acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples and 33 samples from patients with
various rare mature T-cell neoplasms (T-PLL, Sézary syndrome and other T-NHL) were
subsequently investigated. There were no cases with HTLV-I, HTLV-II or any other
Deltaretroviruses.
Conclusion: The results rule out a significant involvement of HTLV-I or HTLV-II in these disease
entities and show that other related Deltaretroviruses are not likely to be involved. The newly
established Deltaretrovirus PCR may be a useful tool for identifying new Deltaretroviruses.

Background
Retroviruses are the main etiologic agents in a variety of
malignant diseases in animals [1]. Bovine leukemia virus

(BLV) was the first Deltaretrovirus to be discovered in
1969 by electron microscopy [2], but it was not until 1985
that the first complete nucleotide sequence of an isolate

was reported [3]. Since the discovery of HTLV-I [4] and
HTLV-II [5] and their closely related simian counterparts
STLV-I [6] and STLV-II [7] several Deltaretrovirus isolates
have been described in various non-human primate species. In 1994, a third simian Deltaretrovirus, later designated as STLV-III, was identified in a Hamadryas Baboon
(Papio Hamadryas) [8-10]. Until recently no human counterparts of STLV-III were known, but in 2005 two independent research groups described human isolates that
showed high homology to STLV-III and were considered
to be HTLV-III isolates [11,12]. Moreover, a fourth Deltaretrovirus was identified in a single human individual
from the Rain Forest in Cameroon. It did not show sufficient homology to be classified as primate T-cell lymphotropic virus (PTLV) type I, II or III and was thus considered
to be a species representative of a hitherto unknown putative PTLV-IV virus group [12].
HTLV-I and STLV-I are etiologically linked to the induction of certain T-cell lymphomas/leukemias in their hosts
[13,14]. The oncogenic action of the virus is mediated by

the viral tax and rex genes that act as transcription factors,
thereby promoting cell growth and malignant transformation However, the etiology of many human malignant Tcell and T-/NK-cell disorders is still not well understood.
On the other hand a great deal of knowledge has been
gained in the last years on the molecular biology of Deltaretroviruses, since a large number of new isolates have
been described. To investigate the possible involvement
of Deltaretroviruses in various human T-cell neoplasms,
we have constructed a novel Deltaretrovirus consensus
PCR based on nucleotide sequence alignments of all 42
complete Deltaretrovirus isolates published to date.
Highly conserved virus genome regions were identified
that allowed the construction of a generic PCR, capable of
detecting all known Deltaretroviruses.

Results
A total of 42 complete Deltaretrovirus isolates could be
retrieved from the EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ nucleotide
sequence database (Table 1). These included 13 HTLV-I,
12 HTLV-II, 4 STLV-I, 3 STLV-II, 5 STLV-III, and 5 BLV iso-

lines frequently harbor more than one copy of the virus,
although often some of these copies are defective. When
calculating PCR sensitivity this factor has to be taken into
account. The HTLV-I/HTLV-II/BLV copy number has been
determined in various cell lines which revealed copy numbers between 1 and 17 per cell [16-18]. We thus assumed
a sensitivity of 10-2 – 10-3 for our PCR. This sensitivity
appeared highly sufficient for our purpose. The PCR produced a faint 657 bp sideband when testing human DNA
or cell line DNA diluted in human DNA (Fig. 3). Cloning
and sequencing of the 657 bp product (EMBL nucleotide
sequence database Acc No [EMBL:AM422011]) and a successive BLAST search revealed that it originated from
amplification of a sequence on chromosome 3 (Acc No
[EMBL:AC114481], Ncl 81342-80686) and 11 (Acc No
[EMBL:AP000785], Ncl 74948–75403) by primer delta-F.
It should be noted that the PCR sensitivity could be further increased to 10-3 – 10-4 (while retaining specificity)
by lowering the annealing temperature to 60°C and
increasing the number of PCR cycles but at the expense of
a stronger 657 bp sideband.

lates. A common feature of the Deltaretrovirus genus is
the use of proline tRNA as a primer for the complementary minus-strand DNA synthesis. tRNA genes are highly
conserved between different species [15]. Alignment of
the collected sequences showed a very high degree of conservation of this functionally important region. Additionally, a second highly conserved region was identified
approximately 1.8 kb 3' of the tRNA binding site (Fig. 1).
The pol ORF of HTLV-I/-II/BLV is expressed by using two
ribosomal -1 frame shifts, and the second frame shift with
the transcription start site of the pol ORF lies within this
region [1]. The high degree of conservation of this region
is thus understandable. A phylogenetic tree constructed
from the aligned region illustrates the genetic relationships (Fig. 2). No other genomic regions with a similarly
high degree of conservation were identified (see Additional File 1). Degenerate primers complementary to
these regions were constructed (Fig. 1). The degeneracy of
the primers was moderate (4-fold for (+) and 12-fold for
(-)). The PCR was tested using serial dilutions of Deltaretrovirus-infected cell line DNA in human leukocyte DNA
under various conditions (Fig. 3). Retrovirus-infected cell

A total of 83 samples were obtained from patients with
various rare mature T-cell (N = 31) and precursor T-cell
neoplasms (N = 50) and from 2 patients with NK-cell disorders. All samples had been thoroughly characterized
immunologically and genetically and contained a high
percentage (>= 50%) of malignant cells (Table 2). All samples were fresh (i.e. unfixated) tumor material, and the
DNA quality was ensured by various control PCRs.
None of the investigated samples yielded a PCR product
indicative of the presence of a Deltaretrovirus. The parallel
investigation of positive controls led to the expected
results.

Discussion
While the etiological involvement of HTLV-I in endemic
adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is beyond dispute there
have been repeated controversies whether this virus might
also play a role in other T-cell neoplasms such as T-prolymphocytic leukemia [19], Sézary syndrome or Mycosis
fungoides [20-22]. The situation is further complicated by
the fact that the classification of T-NHLs has been evolving
and changing over the years as new disease entities are recognized and refined diagnostic criteria are established
[23,24]. Thus the results of older studies may not always
be fully transferable to today's situation. Some investigators have also suggested that a truncated HTLV-I may play
a role in certain T-NHLs [19,25]. On the other hand
HTLV-II has not been convincingly linked to any specific
malignant T-cell disorder. The simian Deltaretroviruses
are implicated in lymphomatous diseases in various simian hosts (reviewed in [1]). The newly discovered HTLV-

taretrovirus-positive cases were found in our series of samples.

Conclusion
The results rule out a role of known Deltaretroviruses in
the disease entities under investigation here. The involvement of a hitherto undetected Deltaretrovirus is not completely excluded but rendered more unlikely. Truncated
proviruses that have lost their 5'-region with the tRNA
binding site may also escape detection by our PCR system.
Despite these negative results, our newly established consensus PCR may be a useful tool in the search for and
characterization of new Deltaretroviruses in primates and
other mammals.

isolates have been published yet. The tree is not intended to

between the isolates.

III and HTLV-IV isolates have not yet been fully characterized, and their distribution or possible involvement in
human disease is unknown.
A few previous investigations performed on precursor Tcell neoplasms in Germany were mainly based on HTLV-I
serology [26] which may not be as reliable as nucleic acidbased techniques [27]. Germany has a low HTLV-I seroprevalence, but virus isolates without linkage to endemic
areas have occasionally been reported [28].
The causes of most malignant T-cell disorders are only
partially understood. Numerous recurrent genetic aberrations have been described [29] but a clear and detailed
model of disease development still does not exist. Oncogenic viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus or HTLV-I are well
established causative factors in various human T-cell lymphomas and leukemias [29]. It appears possible that yet
undetected Deltaretroviruses may play a role in human Tcell malignancies.
We developed a consensus PCR for detecting Deltaretroviruses based on highly conserved genomic sequences of all
published complete Deltaretrovirus isolates. Since this
PCR is based on highly interspecies conserved sequence
motifs it may also be capable of detecting related but hitherto unknown Deltaretroviruses. However, despite high
sensitivity and specificity of our PCR approach, no Del-

Cell lines
The following cell lines were used: BL3.1 (infected with
BLV, a bovine lymphoma cell line, [30]), MJ [G11]
(infected with HTLV-I, derived from a human cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma, [31]) and Mo T (infected with HTLV-II,
derived from a patient with hairy cell leukemia, [32]). All
cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Acc No CRL2306, TIB-8294, and TIB-8066, respectively). Cell culture
was done according to the recommendations of the supplier. DNA isolated from the cell lines was used to prepare
serial dilution rows.
DNA isolation
DNA was isolated from sample material or cell lines using
the PureGene kit (Biozym Diagnostik, Hessisch Oldendorf/Germany) and dissolved in Tris/EDTA buffer at a
concentration of 60 ng/μl.
Preparation of cell line dilution series
Serial dilutions of cell line DNA in DNA from buffy coats
of blood donors were prepared as recently described [33].
Patient samples
All samples were obtained for diagnostic purposes, and
we retrospectively investigated archived material. The
patients had given their consent for scientific investigations. The T-precursor samples were obtained within the
German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL). Our study complied with
the Helsinki Declaration.
