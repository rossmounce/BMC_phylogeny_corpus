Abstract
Background: To gain insight into the branching order of the five main lineages currently recognized in
the green algal class Chlorophyceae and to expand our understanding of chloroplast genome evolution,
we have undertaken the sequencing of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) from representative taxa. The complete
cpDNA sequences previously reported for Chlamydomonas (Chlamydomonadales), Scenedesmus
(Sphaeropleales), and Stigeoclonium (Chaetophorales) revealed tremendous variability in their architecture,
the retention of only few ancestral gene clusters, and derived clusters shared by Chlamydomonas and
Scenedesmus. Unexpectedly, our recent phylogenies inferred from these cpDNAs and the partial
sequences of three other chlorophycean cpDNAs disclosed two major clades, one uniting the
Chlamydomonadales and Sphaeropleales (CS clade) and the other uniting the Oedogoniales,
Chaetophorales and Chaetopeltidales (OCC clade). Although molecular signatures provided strong
support for this dichotomy and for the branching of the Oedogoniales as the earliest-diverging lineage of
the OCC clade, more data are required to validate these phylogenies. We describe here the complete
cpDNA sequence of Oedogonium cardiacum (Oedogoniales).
Results: Like its three chlorophycean homologues, the 196,547-bp Oedogonium chloroplast genome
displays a distinctive architecture. This genome is one of the most compact among photosynthetic
chlorophytes. It has an atypical quadripartite structure, is intron-rich (17 group I and 4 group II introns),
and displays 99 different conserved genes and four long open reading frames (ORFs), three of which are
clustered in the spacious inverted repeat of 35,493 bp. Intriguingly, two of these ORFs (int and dpoB)
revealed high similarities to genes not usually found in cpDNA. At the gene content and gene order levels,
the Oedogonium genome most closely resembles its Stigeoclonium counterpart. Characters shared by these
chlorophyceans but missing in members of the CS clade include the retention of psaM, rpl32 and trnL(caa),
the loss of petA, the disruption of three ancestral clusters and the presence of five derived gene clusters.
Conclusion: The Oedogonium chloroplast genome disclosed additional characters that bolster the
evidence for a close alliance between the Oedogoniales and Chaetophorales. Our unprecedented finding
of int and dpoB in this cpDNA provides a clear example that novel genes were acquired by the chloroplast
genome through horizontal transfers, possibly from a mitochondrial genome donor.

Background
The Chlorophyceae (sensu Mattox and Stewart) is a morphologically diverse class of green algae, which together
with three other green algal classes (Prasinophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae) form the Chlorophyta
[1]. The Chlorophyceae and Ulvophyceae are presumed to
share a sister-relationship, with the Trebouxiophyceae
being sister to the Chlorophyceae + Ulvophyceae clade
and the Prasinophyceae representing the earliest offshoot
of the Chlorophyta [2,3]. Members of the Chlorophyceae
display the most variability in terms of the arrangement of
the flagellar apparatus. The flagellar basal bodies of motile
cells (vegetative cells, zoospores or gametes) are generally
directly opposed (DO) or displaced in a clockwise (CW)
direction [4]; however, those of the chlorophyceans
assigned to the order Oedogoniales display a unique
arrangement characterized by an anterior ring of flagella
[5]. Phylogenetic analyses of 18S rDNA data and combined 18S and 26S rDNA data from a broad range of chlorophyceans uncovered five major monophyletic groups in
the Chlorophyceae: the Chlamydomonadales, Sphaeropleales, Oedogoniales, Chaetophorales, and Chaetopeltidales. The interrelationships of these chlorophycean
lineages, however, could not be unraveled. Although most
internal nodes in the trees inferred from the 18S and 26S
rDNA data received poor support, the five lineages were
most often recovered as a grade, with the sister-relationship observed for the Chlamydomonadales and Sphaeropleales being the best supported [6-9].
Comparative analyses of chloroplast genomes have
proven very useful to clarify the evolutionary relationships among the main groups of green algae and land
plants [10-18]. We adopted this strategy to gain insight
into the branching order of chlorophycean lineages and
also to better understand the forces accounting for the
very fluid structure of the chloroplast genome in the Chlorophyceae. We recently described the complete chloroplast genomes of Scenedesmus obliquus (Sphaeropleales)
[19] and Stigeoclonium helveticum (Chaetophorales) [20]
and compared them to their homologue in
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonadales) [21].
All three genomes have retained only a few of the ancestral characters observed in their counterparts from other
classes. Their reduced gene repertoires, which comprise 94
to 97 genes, lack six of the protein-coding genes (accD,
chlI, minD, psaI, rpl19, and ycf20) identified in Pseudendoclonium akinetum and Oltmannsiellopsis viridis, the two
members of the Ulvophyceae whose chloroplast genomes
have been examined so far [12,22]. Some genes show
unique alterations at the structural level. In all three chlorophyceans, the rpoB gene is split into two distinct open
reading frames (ORFs) and the clpP and rps3 genes have
unusually large coding regions. Moreover, the coding
region of rps4 in Stigeoclonium displays a prominent inser-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/290

tion that is apparently devoid of any intron or intein. Both
the Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus genomes possess a
large inverted repeat (IR) encoding the rRNA operons;
however, the gene contents of their single copy (SC)
regions are entirely different and do not conform to the
ancestral quadripartite structure observed in the prasinophycean Nephroselmis olivacea [23] and in most streptophyte green algae [11,16,24,25] and land plants [26,27].
Despite these differences, they share 11 gene clusters that
have not been previously observed in other green algae.
The IR-lacking chloroplast genome of Stigeoclonium is
extremely rearranged relative to its chlorophycean counterparts and exhibits a number of distinctive traits, including four putatively trans-spliced group II introns inserted
in petD, psaC and rbcL as well as a remarkably strong bias
in gene coding regions and base composition of the two
DNA strands. Both the strand biases in coding regions and
G + C composition were found to be typical of those
observed in prokaryotic genomes that replicate bidirectionally from a single origin.
More recently, we used the sequence data of the three
abovementioned chlorophycean chloroplast genomes
together with those of the partly sequenced chloroplast
DNAs
(cpDNAs)
of
Chlamydomonas
moewusii
(Chlamydomonadales), Oedogonium cardiacum (Oedogoniales) and Floydiella terrestris (Chaetopeltidales) to reconstruct trees from nucleotide and amino acid data sets
derived from more than 40 protein-coding genes [15]. All
best trees identified two robustly supported lineages
within the Chlorophyceae: a clade uniting the
Chlamydomonadales and Sphaeropleales (CS clade) and
a clade uniting the Oedogoniales, Chaetophorales, and
Chaetopeltidales (OCC clade). This dichotomy was independently supported by molecular signatures in chloroplast genes such as insertions/deletions and the
distribution of trans-spliced group II introns [15]. Within
the OCC clade, the sister relationship observed for the
Chaetophorales and Chaetopeltidales was strengthened
by the presence of trans-spliced group II introns at two
identical positions in the Stigeoclonium and Floydiella rbcL
genes. Nevertheless, the possibility that the Chaetophorales are sister to the Oedogoniales + Chaetopeltidales
clade could not be rejected by statistical tests. Character
state reconstruction of basal body orientation using the
best tree as phylogenetic framework predicted that the last
common ancestor of all chlorophycean green algae featured quadriflagellate motile cells with the DO + DO orientation and that changes to the CW condition occurred
convergently in the CS and OCC clades [15].
We present here the complete chloroplast genome
sequence of Oedogonium (Oedogoniales) and report additional genomic characters bolstering the evidence for a
close alliance between the Oedogoniales and Chaetopho-

rales. Like its Stigeoclonium, Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus homologues, the Oedogonium genome displays a
distinctive architecture. Although this IR-containing chloroplast genome is highly shuffled in gene order relative to
the other completely sequenced chlorophycean genomes,
it shares unique gene clusters with the Stigeoclonium
genome as well as the retention and loss of specific genes.
To our surprise, we identified three genes that were
acquired by horizontal gene transfer in a 10-kb region of
the exceptionally large IR.

Results
Overall structure and gene arrangement
The Oedogonium chloroplast genome assembles as a circle
of 196,547 bp with an A+T content of 70.5% (Fig. 1). As
shown in Table 1, these values fall within the range of
sizes and base compositions observed for the three previously sequenced chlorophycean cpDNAs (Table 1). The
Oedogonium genome displays two identical copies of a
35,492-bp IR that are separated from one another by SC
regions of 80,363 and 45,200 bp, designated here SC1
and SC2, respectively. Note that the latter regions are not
designated as large and small SC (LSC and SSC) regions as
is the case for Nephroselmis and streptophyte cpDNAs
because their gene contents deviate considerably from the
ancestral partitioning pattern featured by these genomes
[23,28]. In addition, the quadripartite structure of the
Oedogonium genome differs greatly from those of its
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus homologues with respect
to the gene contents of the IR and the SC regions and also
the relative sizes of these three main genomic regions
(Table 1). In Oedogonium, the IR is significantly larger than
most of its green algal and land plants counterparts and
the vastly unequal sizes of the SC regions contrast with the
similar sizes of the same regions in Chlamydomonas and
Scenedesmus cpDNAs.

The 99 conserved genes and four free-standing ORFs of
more than 100 codons found in Oedogonium cpDNA are
densely packed (Fig. 1). The intergenic spacers account for
22.6% of the total genome sequence and vary from 22 to
1721 bp, for an average size of 370 bp. This is the lowest
proportion and smallest average size of intergenic spacers
observed thus far for the chloroplast genome of a photosynthetic chlorophyte belonging to the Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae or Chlorophyceae (UTC) (Table 1 and
[29]).
The Oedogonium IR contains six conserved genes and three
ORFs in addition to the rRNA-encoding operon, whereas
the SC1 and SC2 regions encode 54 and 34 genes, respectively. The SC1 and SC2 boundaries of the IR lie in the
3'ends of ccsA and rpoA, respectively. Interestingly, the
3'end of trnR(ucu) encompasses the SC1 boundary of the
IR; the last two bp of this gene coding region maps to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/290

IR and are thus shared with ccsA. These genes were considered as part of the IR in the breakdown of genes provided
above. The rRNA operon lies at the proximity of the SC2
region and is transcribed toward to the largest SC region
(SC1). In contrast, the rRNA operon is always transcribed
toward the smallest SC region in cpDNAs that have
retained the ancestral quadripartite structure. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the chloroplast genome
of the ulvophycean Pseudendoclonium, which carries an
atypical quadripartite structure, resembles its Oedogonium
homologue in exhibiting an IR whose rRNA operon is
transcribed toward the largest SC region [12]. Considering
that the latter region in Pseudendoclonium is clearly equivalent to the LSC region found in genomes having an
ancestral quadripartite structure, it was speculated that a
change in the transcription direction of the rRNA operon
might have occurred in conjunction with the exchange of
a few genes between the two SC regions. Subsequent analysis of an ulvophycean belonging to a separate earlybranching lineage (Oltmannsiellopis) suggested that these
genomic events might have occurred before or soon after
the emergence of the Ulvophyceae [22]. Unlike their ulvophycean homologues, the Oedogonium SC regions display
no remnant of an ancestral gene partitioning pattern, nor
do they bear any obvious similarities in gene content to
the SC regions in either Chlamydomonas or Scenedesmus
cpDNA.
A strong bias in the distribution of genes between the two
DNA strands has been noted in the Stigeoclonium chloroplast genome [20] and, to a lesser extent, in its Scenedesmus counterpart [19]. The propensity of contiguous genes
to be encoded on the same strand can be estimated using
the sidedness index [30]. Even though several gene clusters are found on the same strand in Oedogonium cpDNA
(Fig. 1), the calculated value of 0.74 for the sidedness
index indicates that this is the chlorophycean genome
where this tendency is the least pronounced (Table 1).
Conserved genes and ORFs
The 99 conserved genes of Oedogonium represent the largest gene repertoire among the four chlorophycean cpDNAs completely sequenced to date (Table 1). A common
set of 93 genes, including a fragmented rpoB, are shared by
these genomes (Table 2). The collection of conserved
genes displayed by Oedogonium closely resembles that of
Stigeoclonium, the only differences being the presence of
three extra genes [infA, trnR(ccu) and trnR(ucg)] and the
absence of trnS(gga) in the former alga (Table 2). Compared to the representatives of the CS clade, both Oedogonium and Stigeoclonium feature three additional genes
[psaM, rpl32 and trnL(caa)] and lack petA. These members
of the OCC clade also differ from those of the CS clade in
exhibiting insertions of more 2,500 codons (2,562
codons in Oedogonium and 2,682 codons in Stigeoclonium)

sequences of these insertions are extremely divergent,
thereby precluding us from decrypting their nature.
Intriguingly, the corresponding 3' regions of the
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus rps4 genes are missing
not only a large insertion but also the highly conserved
sequence corresponding to the last 40 codons [15].
As mentioned above, four free-standing ORFs in Oedogonium cpDNA showed no sequence similarity with any
genes usually present in chloroplast genomes. Three of
these ORFs (orf485, orf512 and orf538) are clustered in the

central region of the IR. The contiguous orf485 and orf538
(dpoB in Fig. 1) reside on the same strand as orf512 (int in
Fig. 1) but are separated from this ORF by trnR(ccu), a
gene located on the opposite strand. The fourth ORF
(orf1252) is located within the SC1 region between ftsH
and psbK. For all four ORFs, except orf485, our Blast
searches identified similarities with genes encoding proteins acting on DNA or RNA.
We found that the orf512 encodes a protein belonging to
the family of tyrosine recombinases. The functions of
these site-specific recombinases include the integrative

and excisive recombination of viral and plasmid DNA
into and out of the host genome, conjugative transposition, resolution of catenated DNA circles, regulation of
plasmid copy number, and DNA inversions controlling
the expression of cell surface proteins or DNA replication
[31]. The C-terminal region of the orf512 product displays
the essential tyrosine and the five other active site residues
that are diagnostic of this protein family [31,32]. BlastP
searches identified the catalytic domain found in the family of phage integrases (pfamH00589) as being the most
highly conserved in sequence with the C-terminal region
of the orf512-encoded protein. The members of the tyrosine recombinase family that proved the most similar to
the Oedogonium orf512 product are the proteins of
unknown function encoded by the mitochondrial
genomes of two green algae, the charophycean Chaetosphaeridium globosum [25] (E-value threshold of 7 × 10-8)
and the trebouxiophycean Prototheca wickerhamii [33] (Evalue threshold of 3 × 10-6).
The orf538 encodes a member of the B family of DNAdirected DNA polymerases. These polymerases were
named for their homology with the product of the polB
gene encoding Escherichia coli polymerase II. Members of
this family are extensive in number and variety, occurring
in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses [34]. [35]. The
DNA polymerase encoded by a linear mitochondrial plasmid in the fungus Neurospora intermedia (the kalilo element; [36]) revealed the highest level of sequence
similarity (E-value threshold of 7 × 10-32) with the orf538
product.
BlastP searches with the orf485-encoded protein disclosed
limited similarity (E-value threshold of 7 × 10-5) with the
conserved domain of the septation ring formation regulator ErzA (pfam06160), a protein that modulates the frequency and position of FtsZ ring formation during the
bacterial cell cycle. Because the detected similarity is marginal and restricted to a portion of the ErzA domain, the
orf485 product is unlikely to function as an ErzA protein.
Finally, a short C-terminal region of the orf1252 product
revealed sequence similarity with the maturase domain of

reverse transcriptases encoded by bacterial group II
introns and also with the maturase domain of the protein
predicted from the free-standing orf932 in Scenedesmus
cpDNA [19]. Although they carry the maturase domain,
both the Oedogonium orf1252 and Scenedesmus orf932
products lack the reverse transcriptase domain.
Each of the four Oedogonium ORFs was compared with the
set of 68 protein-coding genes to assess their similarity in
codon usage (Table 3). We found that the orf512/int differs markedly in base composition at the first and third
codon positions relative to conserved protein-coding
genes; moreover, the codon adaptation index (CAI) [37]
calculated for this ORF deviates considerably from the
average value obtained for the conserved genes. The
orf1252 also differs greatly from conserved protein-coding
genes with respect to base composition, but its CAI is not
significantly different. For the orf485 and orf538/dpoB,
only moderate differences were observed for both the base
composition and CAI relative to the conserved proteincoding genes.
Gene order
Stigeoclonium, Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus cpDNAs
were previously shown to have retained only a few ancestral gene clusters [20]. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the Oedogonium genome has retained about the same set of ancestral
clusters. Besides the intact rRNA operon, it displays the
psbF-psbL-psbJ cluster and six ancestral gene pairs (atpHatpF, psbB-psbT, rpl16-rpl14, rpl23-rpl2, rpl5-rps8 and psaJrps12). The ancestral gene pairs rpl14-rpl5, rpl2-rps19 as
well as the psbH-psbN-psbT cluster are missing from both
Oedogonium and Stigeoclonium but are present in both
Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas.

With regard to the presence of derived gene clusters, the
Oedogonium chloroplast genome clearly bears more similarity with its Stigeoclonium homologue than with the
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus cpDNAs. The pentad
psbT-psbH-psaC(ex1)-psbN-psaC(ex2), the triads atpA-atpIpetG and chlN-psaM-chlB, as well as the gene pairs atpFrpl16 and trnK(uuu)-trnI(cau) are found in Oedogonium
and Stigeoclonium but are absent from the two members of

Conservation of gene pairs in Oedogonium and other UTC algal cpDNAs

Conservation of gene pairs in Oedogonium and other UTC algal cpDNAs. For each gene pair, adjoining termini of the
genes are indicated. Filled boxes indicate the presence of gene pairs with the same relative polarities in two or more genomes.
Grey or open boxes indicate the absence of gene pairs. A grey box indicates that the two genes associated with a gene pair are
found in the genome but are unlinked. An open box indicates that one or both genes associated with a gene pair are absent
from the genome. Two horizontal lines at the bottom of the figure denote the gene pairs that are shared specifically by
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus (CS clade) and by Oedogonium and Stigeoclonium (OCC clade). The gene pairs shared by the
prasinophycean Nephroselmis and the streptophyte Mesostigma viride were presumably present in the last common ancestor of
all green algae. Chlorella vulgaris belongs to the Trebouxiophyceae, whereas Oltmannsiellopsis and Pseudendoclonium are representatives of the Ulvophyceae.

the CS clade (Fig. 2). Of the 11 derived gene clusters previously reported to be shared by Chlamydomonas and
Scenedesmus but not by Stigeoclonium, only one (the pair
rps7-atpE) was found in Oedogonium, suggesting that it
arose before the split of the CS and OCC clades. Note here
that the order of the coding regions observed for the fragmented rpoB gene was not considered in Fig. 2. In this
regard, it is interesting to point out that the two rpoB gene
fragments (rpoBa and rpoBb) are contiguous in the
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus genomes but separated
from one another by other genes in the Oedogonium and
Stigeoclonium genomes.

Regardless of their timing of emergence, a total of eight
gene clusters are conserved between the Oedogonium and
Stigeoclonium cpDNAs; they encode 26 of the 96 genes
shared by these genomes. By comparison, 16 conserved
gene clusters in the Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus chloroplasts encode 48 of the 94 genes common to these algal
genomes.
Group I Introns
As observed for Stigeoclonium, the Oedogonium chloroplast
genome is rich in introns and most of these genetic elements belong to the group I family (Table 1). The 17
group I introns in the Oedogonium chloroplast are distrib-

uted among six genes (Table 4). The psbA gene contains
ten introns, rrl and psbC each exhibit two introns, and
atpA, rrs and trnL(uaa) each contains one intron. These
introns vary from 309 bp to 1415 bp in size and, according to the classification system proposed by Michel and
Westhof [38], fall within subgroups IA1, IA2, IA3, IB and
IC3 (Table 4). Ten introns feature internal ORFs coding
for putative homing endonucleases of the HNH, LAGLIDADG and GIY-YIG families (Table 4). All 17 introns,
except the rrs intron, are located in the same positions and
possess similar structures as compared to introns in other
UTC algal chloroplast genomes (Fig. 3). The rrs intron
maps to a variable region of the RNA secondary structure
and to our knowledge, its insertion site has not been
reported previously. The Pseudendoclonium chloroplast
genome is the UTC algal genome the most closely related
to that of Oedogonium in terms of intron content; these
two genomes share a total of 11 introns, including eight
in psbA.
Group II Introns
The four Oedogonium group II introns range from 736 bp
and 2477 bp and occur in psbB, psbI, psaC and petD (Table
4). Both the putatively trans-spliced introns in psaC and
petD feature a site of discontinuity within domain I and
have positional homologues in Stigeoclonium cpDNA. In
contrast, the presence of cis-spliced group II introns in the
psbB and psbI gences is documented here for the first time
(Fig. 3). The psaC, psbI and petD introns fall within subgroup IIB according to the nomenclature proposed by
Michel et al. [39], whereas the psbB intron belongs to subgroup IIA. The predicted secondary structure of the Oedogonium psaC intron bears striking resemblance with that of
its Stigeoclonium homologue; however, the Oedogonium
petD intron shows a lower degree of similarity with the
positionally homologous intron of Stigeoclonium. As
shown by the consensus secondary structure of the Oedogonium and Stigeoclonium psaC introns (Fig. 4), the similarity observed for these introns extends well beyond the few
residues expected to be conserved in members of the same
subclass and their sites of discontinuity are found at the
same location within domain I (between D(i) and D(ii)).
Only the psbI intron displays an ORF of more than 100
codons; this 458-codon ORF, located within domain IV,
specifies a protein carrying a reverse transcriptase domain
and a maturase domain.
Repeated sequences
As is the case for the Scenedesmus chloroplast genome, that
of Oedogonium contains fewer repeated sequences relative
to its Chlamydomonas and Stigeoclonium homologues
(Table 1). Repeated sequences of more than 30 bp were
estimated to represent 1.28% of the Oedogonium genome.
As in other chlorophycean genomes, these repeats map
mainly to intergenic regions and most are dispersed

repeats. By comparing the sequences of these repeats, we
identified two repeat units (A and B). The consensus
sequence of repeat unit A (ACACRTWCAATTGTAT) is
identical to that of repeat unit B, except that the central
region contains CATTG instead of CAATTG. Repeat unit A
was identified at 82 genomic sites, whereas repeat unit B
was located at 18 locations. Degenerated versions of
repeat units A and B were also found in the Oedogonium
genome. When our searches allowed a single mismatch at
any position in each repeat unit, 293 and 33 copies were
recovered for repeat units A and B, respectively. Although
the repeats in the Oedogonium genome are generally isolated, some occur in tandem or are closely associated with
less frequent repeat units. No repeats having identical
sequences to repeat units A and B were detected in any
other completely sequenced UTC algal cpDNA.

Discussion
The distinctive architecture of Oedogonium cpDNA
discloses additional characters supporting the split of the
Chlorophyceae into two major lineages
The architecture of Oedogonium cpDNA further highlights
the extraordinary plasticity of the chlorophycean chloroplast genome. Compared to its Stigeoclonium,
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus homologues, the 196.6kb Oedogonium chloroplast genome exhibits high similarity in gene content (Table 2) but differs considerably in
gene organization. Of its 99 conserved genes, only two
[trnR(ccu) and trnR(ucg)], have not been found in other
chlorophycean genomes. Like Chlamydomonas and
Scenedesmus cpDNAs, it displays an IR; however, the patterns observed for the partitioning of genes among the
two SC regions are distinctly different in these three
genomes (this study, [19,21]). The Oedogonium chloroplast genome resembles its Scenedesmus homologue with
reference to its tight packaging of genes and paucity of
small dispersed repeats (Table 1). Among the photosynthetic UTC green algae that have been scrutinized thus far

according to Michel et al. [39]. Exon sequences are shown in lowercase letters. Positions exhibiting different nucleotides are

for their chloroplast genome [11,29], this oedogonialean
alga shows the highest gene density and lowest proportion of dispersed repeats. Only the 71.7-kb cpDNA of the
prasinophycean Ostreococcus tauri [40] and the 37.5-kb
plastid DNA of the parasitic trebouxiophycean Helicosporidium sp. [41], two genomes highly reduced in gene
content, have been reported to have a more compact gene
organization than the Oedogonium genome. In contrast,
the Chlamydomonas and Stigeoclonium chloroplast
genomes are loosely packed and rich in small dispersed
repeats. Oedogonium and Stigeoclonium cpDNAs display a

plethora of introns (each containing a total of 21 introns),
indicating that the degree of gene packaging has no influence on the size of intron populations observed in chlorophycean genomes. Although members of the group I
intron family are predominant in both genomes, introns
sharing similar structures and identical insertion positions are found at only five genomic sites (Fig. 3).
Despite its unique architecture, the Oedogonium chloroplast genome revealed shared derived characters (i.e.
synapomorphies) at the levels of gene content and gene

organization that reinforce our recent study based on
comparative analyses of chloroplast gene sequences and
gene structural features in supporting the idea that the five
recognized lineages of the Chlorophyceae fall within two
major clades, the CS and OCC clades [15]. The newly
uncovered synapomorphic characters that provide further
evidence for the close alliance of the Oedogoniales with
the Chaetophorales and for their belonging to a clade separate from the CS clade are as follows: 1) the loss of petA
from the chloroplast genome and its putative transfer to
the nucleus, 2) the loss of linkage of the two distinct ORFs
making up rpoB, 3) the gains of five derived gene clusters
(one pentad, two triads and two pairs), and 4) the disruptions of two ancestral gene pairs (rpl14-rpl5 and rpl2rps19) that are not associated with the formation of the
latter derived clusters (Fig. 2). Previously, we showed that
the gains of trans-spliced group II introns by petD and psaC
and of a large insertion by rps4 distinguish the members
of the OCC clade from those belonging to the CS clade
[15]. The study reported here also revealed that the disappearance of the psaM, rpl32 and trnL(caa) genes in both
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus represent additional
synapomorphies that provide support for the close alliance of the Chlamydomonadales and Sphaeropleales.
Furthermore, we confirmed that the duplication of
trnE(cuu) and the acquisitions of all 11 derived clusters
reported by de Cambiaire et al. [19], with the exception of
rps7-atpE, are synapomorphies uniting the members of the
CS clade. Concerning the abovementioned chloroplast
genes that underwent losses, it should be pointed out that
all four are uniformly present throughout the Chlorophyta, making it extremely unlikely that independent
losses (i.e. homoplasy) rather than shared losses were
responsible for the distribution patterns observed in the
Chlorophyceae. The petA gene was reported to be missing
from only Helicosporidium, psaM from Nephroselmis, and
trnL(caa) from Oltmannsiellopsis. Given the substantial
number of genomic characters that are consistent with the
strongly supported conclusions derived from phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast sequence data, we conclude
that there is now ample and unambiguous evidence for
the split of the Chlorophyceae into two separate clades.
Nevertheless, the precise phylogenetic position of the
Oedogoniales within the OCC clade remains uncertain.
Phylogenomic analyses of chloroplast sequence data
favoured the hypothesis that the Oedogoniales represent
the first branch of the OCC clade [15]. Although this
topology is supported by the finding that trans-spliced
group II introns are present at two identical positions in
the rbcL genes of Stigeoclonium and Floydiella but absent
from their Oedogonium homologues, the possibility that
the Chaetophorales are sister to the Oedogoniales and
Chaetopeltidales could not be excluded [15]. To unravel
the branching order of the lineages in the OCC clade, we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/290

are currently completing the cpDNA sequence of a representative of the Chaetopeltidales (Floydiella) and have
undertaken the analysis of additional chlorophyceans to
increase taxon sampling in phylogenomic analyses.
The nature of the chloroplast genome in the last common
ancestor of all chlorophyceans remains elusive
As observed for the IR-lacking cpDNA of Stigeoclonium
[20], the Oedogonium genome proved to be too different
from its Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus counterparts
and from the other previously investigated chlorophyte
genomes to reconstruct with confidence the landscape of
the ancestral chlorophycean genome with regard to the
partitioning of genes among the SC regions, the gene
order in each of these regions, and the contents in introns
and small dispersed repeats. Therefore, it remains
unknown whether the ancestral ulvophycean and chlorophycean genomes were similar with respect to their quadripartite structure and whether the transcription direction
of the rRNA operon changed before the emergence of
both the Chlorophyceae and Ulvophyceae.

The fact that the IR-containing chloroplast genomes from
the representatives of the Chlamydomonadales, Sphaeropleales and Oedogoniales feature distinct gene partitioning patterns raises questions as to the factors accounting
for this organizational diversity. Currently, there exists no
satisfactory general model for chloroplast genome rearrangements. Given that a number of highly rearranged IRcontaining cpDNAs display an increased abundance of
small dispersed repeats and that the presence of small dispersed repeats and/or tRNA genes has been observed at or
near the endpoints of rearranged blocks of genes, it has
been proposed that these elements mediate inversions by
inter- or intramolecular recombination [12,25,26,42-47].
The marked variations in sequence and abundance of
small dispersed repeats in the CS and OCC lineages indicate that these repeats evolve in a very dynamic manner;
however, whether they played a role in mediating the
observed changes in quadripartite structure remains
unknown. It is tempting to suggest that dispersed repeats
were scarce in the common ancestor of all chlorophyceans
and that they arose and proliferated independently in different lineages. Chloroplast genomes of closely and distantly related taxa from separate lineages will need to be
investigated to understand the tempo and mode of
cpDNA evolution in the Chlorophyceae. At present, only
for the Chlamydomonadales do we have chloroplast
genome data from more than one representative taxon
[48,49]. These data, which come from physical mapping
studies of a large fraction of the genes encoded by the
chloroplast genome, suggest that the most phylogenetically divergent chlamydomonadalean taxa investigated
(two representatives of the paraphyletic genus
Chlamydomonas:
Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii
and

Chlamydomonas moewusii) differ by minor changes with
respect to their patterns of gene partitioning between the
two SC regions [50].
To our surprise, we found that the distribution of group I
introns in the Oedogonium genome is strikingly similar to
that observed for the ulvophycean Pseudendoclonium (Fig.
3). Whereas 11 of the 17 Oedogonium group I introns,
including eight in psbA, are positionally and structurally
homologous to Pseudendoclonium introns, only three of
the Oedogonium introns have homologues in any of the
three other completely sequenced chlorophycean cpDNAs (Fig. 3). Considering that a large fraction of the 27
group I introns found in Pseudendoclonium cpDNA were
reported to have no known homologues when they were
discovered, that they resembled one another in both secondary structure and primary sequence and that several
encoded a putative homing endonuclease, intragenomic
proliferation of group I introns was proposed to have
occurred within the lineage leading to Pseudendoclonium
[12]. The intron mobility conferred by the presence of
homing endonuclease genes most likely explains the
remarkable similarity between the group I intron contents
of the Oedogonium and Pseudendoclonium genomes. Owing
to this mobility, we propose that chloroplast group I
introns from one chlorophyte taxon were transferred horizontally on multiple occasions to the chloroplast
genome of a chlorophyte belonging to a different lineage.
Because independent losses of many introns in several lineages would be expected, we consider less likely the scenario postulating that all the introns common to
Pseudendoclonium and Oedogonium were present in the last
common ancestor of ulvophyceans and chlorophyceans.
The ability of mobile group I introns to spread readily to
new genomes or new sites within a given genome together
with the general property of group I introns to escape
from the genomic sites they occupy through reverse splicing [51] are the main explanations for the highly variable
distribution patterns observed for the genetic elements
belonging to this class in chlorophyte chloroplast
genomes (Fig. 3). In contrast, the rare trans-spliced group
II introns inserted in chlorophycean genomes are stable,
allowing their distribution patterns to be phylogenetically
informative [15].
The remarkably large IR of Oedogonium acquired nonstandard chloroplast genes via horizontal DNA transfer
The increased size of the Oedogonium IR relative to its
Chlamydomonas and Scenedesmus counterparts (Table 1) is
largely accounted for by the numerous introns in psbA and
by the internal region of about 10 kb that harbours coding
sequences not normally found in the chloroplast, notably
the int and dpoB genes. The predicted protein encoded by
the Oedogonium int gene belongs to the family of tyrosine

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/290

recombinases, whereas the dpoB product is a member of
the B family of DNA-directed DNA polymerases.
Members of the tyrosine recombinase family are most
widespread among bacteria and bacteriophages but also
occur in archaea and eukaryotes [31,32]. The integrases of
bacteriophage λ and of the conjugative transposons tn916
and tn1545, the E. coli resolvase XerD, and the Cre and Flp
recombinases are part of this family. Tyrosine recombinases are responsible for the integration, excision or inversion of defined DNA segments [32]. To mediate sitespecific recombination, these proteins recognize an
inverted pair of recombination sites (20 to 30 bp in
length), break and rejoin single DNA strands in pairs to
form a Holliday junction intermediate. Our analyses of
the Oedogonium int and of its immediate environment in
the IR did not provide enough information to allow a
judgment concerning what would be the function of the
protein encoded by this gene if it is expressed. Its G+C
content and codon usage deviate considerably from what
we observed for the conserved protein-coding genes
(Table 3), suggesting that low levels of protein, if any,
would result from translation of mRNA. Furthermore, no
putative recombination sites or features typical of bacterial transposons and integrons could be identified in the
10-kb region housing the unusual genes in the Oedogonium IR.
Genes encoding type B DNA-directed DNA polymerases
are commonly found on linear mitochondrial plasmids of
yeasts, filamentous fungi and higher plants. These genetic
elements encode their own DNA polymerase and RNA
polymerase to ensure their autonomous replication [35].
The Oedogonium chloroplast dpoB was found to be closely
related to conserved protein-coding genes in terms of G+C
content and codon usage (Table 3), implying that it could
be actively translated if appropriate regulatory signals
allow its transcription by the chloroplast RNA polymerase. The role of such translation product, however, would
appear dispensable given that a chloroplast-encoded DNA
polymerase dedicated to cpDNA replication is absent
from all photosynthetic eukaryotes that have been examined thus far.
Because no cpDNA-encoded homologues of int and dpoB
have been reported to date, the origin of these genes in
Oedogonium is intriguing. The results of our homology
searches in databases point to a mitochondrial origin. The
closest homologues of the Oedogonium int gene was identified in the mitochondrial genomes of the green algae
Chaetosphaeridium globosum [25] and Prototheca wickerhamii [33], whereas the closest homologue of the Oedogonium dpoB was localized on the kalilo invertron, a linear
mitochondrial plasmid of Neurospora intermedia that can
integrate into the mitochondrial genome of this fungus

[36]. These observations suggest that the Oedogonium int
and dpoB genes were acquired through horizontal transfer
of mobile element(s) originating from the mitochondria
of an unknown donor. As these genes are clustered in the
same region of the Oedogonium IR, a single event of horizontal DNA transfer might have been responsible for their
insertion in the chloroplast genome.
Although prominent insertions in the IRs of the C.
moewusii and Neproselmis chloroplast genomes have also
been attributed to horizontal DNA transfer events [23,52],
the nature of the captured sequences remains unknown.
The 21-kb insertion in the C. moewusii IR lies between the
psbA and rbcL genes [53] and contains five ORFs of more
than 200 codons (our unpublished results). In the Nephroselmis IR, a 20.9-kb region between rbcL and the small
subunit rRNA gene (rrl) houses 20 ORFs of more than 80
codons, whereas a separate insertion of smaller size (6.9
kb) contains two ORFs [23]. Provided that the Oedogonium, C. moewusii and Nephroselmis insertions were really
acquired via lateral transfer, long segments of foreign
sequences would have been transferred horizontally to
the chloroplast IR on at least four different occasions during the evolution of chlorophytes. As the IR often participates in intramolecular recombination events [54], such
events might explain why the IR could to be a preferred
target site for the insertion of foreign sequences. On the
other hand, the presence of a 5.8-kb insertion carrying
ORFs of unknown origin in a SC region of the C. moewusii
chloroplast genome [55,56] suggests that the IR is not the
only region that acquired non-standard chloroplast genes
through horizontal transfer.
Our study provides the first case of horizontal gene transfer in which coding sequences of known function, not carried out by introns, were gained by the chloroplast
genome in the green algal/land plant lineage. Another rare
example of horizontal gene transfer involving non-standard chloroplast genes was recently reported for the cryptophyte alga Rhodomonas salina [57]. In this instance, a gene
encoding the tau/gamma subunit of DNA polymerase III
(dnaX) was most likely acquired from a firmicute bacterium. Only two other convincing cases of horizontal gene
transfer in the chloroplast have been documented thus
far; both events took place early during the evolution of
algae and involved the replacement of native chloroplast
genes (the rbcL and rbcS pair and rpl36) by bacterial genes
[58,59].

Conclusion
Our comparative analysis of the Oedogonium chloroplast
genome with its homologues in representatives of the
Chlamydomonadales, Sphaeropleales and Chaetophorales highlights the extraordinary plasticity of the chlorophycean chloroplast genome and provides compelling

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/290

evidence for the dichotomy of the Chlorophyceae. No significant insight was gained into the nature of the ancestral
chlorophycean chloroplast genome. Unexpectedly, our
finding of two non-standard chloroplast genes within the
exceptionally large Oedogonium IR has revealed a clear case
of horizontal transfer involving most probably the capture of a mobile element from the mitochondria of a fungal or plant species. It will be interesting to see what our
ongoing sequencing of Floydiella (Chaetopeltidales)
cpDNA will tell us about the branching order of the Oedogoniales, Chaetopeltidales and Chaetophorales and about
the forces shaping this genome in the OCC clade.

Methods
Cloning and sequencing of Oedogonium cpDNA
Oedogonium cardiacum was obtained from the Sammlung
von Algenkulturen Gôttingen (SAG 575-1b) and grown in
medium C [60] under 12 h light/dark cycles. An A + T rich
fraction containing the cpDNA of this green alga was
recovered by centrifugation of total cellular DNA in CsClbisbenzimide density gradients [61]. This DNA fraction
was sheared by nebulization to produce 1500–2000-bp
fragments that were subsequently cloned into the
pSMART-HCKan plasmid (Lucigen Corporation, Middleton, WI) [24]. After hybridization of the resulting clones
with the original DNA used for cloning, DNA templates
from positive clones were prepared with the QIAprep 96
Miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Canada) and
sequenced as described previously [62]. Sequences were
edited and assembled using SEQUENCHER 4.7 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI). Genomic regions not represented
in the clones analyzed were sequenced from PCR-amplified fragments. The fully annotated chloroplast genome
sequence has been deposited in [GenBank:EU677193].
Sequence analyses
Genes and ORFs were identified by Blast homology
searches [63] against the non-redundant database of the
National Center for Biotechnology and Information
(NCBI) server. Protein-coding genes and ORFs were localized precisely using ORFFINDER at NCBI, various programs of the Wisconsin package (version 10.3) (Accelrys,
San Diego, CA) and applications from the EMBOSS version 4.1.0 package [64]. Positions of genes coding for
tRNAs were determined using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 [65].
Boundaries of introns were located by modelling intron
secondary structures [38,39] and by comparing the
sequences of intron-containing genes with those of
intronless homologues using FRAMEALIGN of the Wisconsin package. For each of the four ORFs identified and
for the set of 68 conserved protein-coding genes, both the
codon frequency table and the base composition at the
three codon positions were calculated with CUSP in
EMBOSS. Codon usage bias in conserved genes and ORFs
was determined using CAI [37] in EMBOSS. The values

derived from the ORFs in these analyses were compared
with the corresponding, average value obtained for the
conserved protein-coding genes.

Forward and palindromic repeats larger than 20 bp were
identified with the Comparative Repeat Analysis program
[66]. Number of copies of each repeat unit was determined with FUZZNUC in EMBOSS. Populations of
repeats in different chloroplast genomes were compared
using the Comparative Repeat Analysis program. Regions
of the genome sequence containing non-overlapping
repeated elements were mapped with RepeatMasker [67]
running under the WU-BLAST 2.0 search engine [68],
using the repeats ≥ 30 bp identified with REPuter [69] as
input sequences.
Analyses of gene order
The sidedness index Cs or propensity of adjacent genes to
occur on the same DNA strand was determined as
described by Cui et al. [30] using the formula Cs = (n-nSB)/
(n-1), where nSB is the number of sided blocks, i.e. the
number of blocks including adjacent genes on the same
strand of the genome, and n is the total number of genes.
The set of genes used for this analysis did not include the
orf485, orf512/int, orf538/dpoB and orf1252. Conserved
gene pairs or gene clusters exhibiting identical gene polarities in selected green algal cpDNAs were identified using
a custom-built program.
