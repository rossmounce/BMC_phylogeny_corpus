Abstract
Background: Instructions to fabricate mineralized structures with distinct nanoscale
architectures, such as seashells and coral and vertebrate skeletons, are encoded in the genomes of
a wide variety of animals. In mollusks, the mantle is responsible for the extracellular production of
the shell, directing the ordered biomineralization of CaCO3 and the deposition of architectural and
color patterns. The evolutionary origins of the ability to synthesize calcified structures across
various metazoan taxa remain obscure, with only a small number of protein families identified from
molluskan shells. The recent sequencing of a wide range of metazoan genomes coupled with the
analysis of gene expression in non-model animals has allowed us to investigate the evolution and
process of biomineralization in gastropod mollusks.
Results: Here we show that over 25% of the genes expressed in the mantle of the vetigastropod
Haliotis asinina encode secreted proteins, indicating that hundreds of proteins are likely to be
contributing to shell fabrication and patterning. Almost 85% of the secretome encodes novel
proteins; remarkably, only 19% of these have identifiable homologues in the full genome of the
patellogastropod Lottia scutum. The spatial expression profiles of mantle genes that belong to the
secretome is restricted to discrete mantle zones, with each zone responsible for the fabrication of
one of the structural layers of the shell. Patterned expression of a subset of genes along the length
of the mantle is indicative of roles in shell ornamentation. For example, Has-sometsuke maps
precisely to pigmentation patterns in the shell, providing the first case of a gene product to be
involved in molluskan shell pigmentation. We also describe the expression of two novel genes
involved in nacre (mother of pearl) deposition.
Conclusion: The unexpected complexity and evolvability of this secretome and the modular
design of the molluskan mantle enables diversification of shell strength and design, and as such must
contribute to the variety of adaptive architectures and colors found in mollusk shells. The
composition of this novel mantle-specific secretome suggests that there are significant molecular
differences in the ways in which gastropods synthesize their shells.

Background
The ability to synthesize rigid, mineralized structures is an
essential trait to the majority of metazoan taxa. Vertebrates, echinoderms, mollusks, arthropods, brachiopods,
bryozoans, annelids, cnidarians and sponges, amongst
others, construct a spectacular diversity of endo- and exoskeletons as well as sensory and protective structures from
a range of minerals [1]. The importance of this trait is
highlighted by the observation that the so called 'Cambrian explosion' was accompanied by the diversification
of biomineralization mechanisms [2-4], despite the fact
that several lineages possessed this ability before the end
of the Proterozoic [5]. It is currently unknown whether
the molecular mechanisms used to create these structures
have been inherited from an ancestral biomineralization
repertoire, invented de novo, or are the result of an
unprecedented lateral genetic transfer [6].
The evolutionary origins, mode of construction, patterning and physical properties of the molluskan shell have
held the attention of scientists for centuries, however the
molecular mechanisms by which these structures are constructed are only now beginning to be elucidated [7-9].
The mollusk shell is assembled extracellularly and is an
ensemble of CaCO3 and organic macromolecules (proteins, glycoproteins, lipids and polysaccharides), which
are secreted by the mantle epithelium. The anterior edge
of the mantle tissue underlies the lip of the shell and
directs the ordered biomineralization of the different
structural layers of the shell and controls the patterning of
architectural and color features. While the structure and
function of a number of shell matrix proteins have
recently been characterized [7,10-17], the regulatory
mechanisms that govern these shell-building processes
remain largely unknown.

rior edge of the abalone mantle epithelium is convoluted
and partitioned into discrete zones that produce each of
these layers [24]. Within each of these zones are a number
of cell types, which contribute to the construction and
patterning of the shell [25,26].
Here we assess the complexity of gene expression in the H.
asinina mantle, and explore the regulatory and structural
factors that contribute to the construction of the shell. Previous studies have demonstrated that the organic component of the shell (often comprising less than 5% by dry
weight) is essential to its construction, and confers its
remarkable physical properties. For example, Lustrin-A
[11,27] is thought to impart fracture resistant, elastomeric
properties to the nacreous layer, while macromolecules
isolated from calcitic or nacreous environments can direct
the type of polymorph of CaCO3 that will be deposited in
vitro [28-30]. Unfortunately, shell matrix proteins are
often insoluble, highly acidic or complexed with minerals, making their purification very difficult [31]. To gain a
broader understanding of the molecular processes that
underlie seashell construction, we have analyzed
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the mantle of juvenile H. asinina. This approach allows for the identification
of gene products that are not necessarily incorporated into
the shell, but are nonetheless crucial for CaCO3 precipitation and other biomineralization events within the pallial
space adjacent to the mantle. Other mantle-localized,
secreted gene products not involved in biomineralization
will also be detected by this methodology. We have compared this EST set with the recently sequenced L. scutum
(Patellogastropoda) genome in order to infer the degree
of evolutionary conservation between shell building
secretomes within one molluskan class.

Results and discussion
It has long been acknowledged that the diversity of shell
types found in gastropod, bivalve and scaphopod mollusks are achieved through the ordered secretion of proteins and other molecules along the length of mantle [1821], however the full complexity and role of differential
gene activity in the mantle remains undescribed. The
color, structure and geometric pattern of a sea shell is a
historical record of the incorporation of proteins into the
shell matrix and onto its surface, and directly reflects the
gene expression activity of the mantle during the life of a
mollusk [22]. Using the vetigastropod Haliotis asinina
(tropical abalone) as a model, we sought to determine the
complexity of the mantle transcriptome. Abalone shells
are composed of three structurally-distinct layers: (i) the
inner nacreous (flat pearl) layer, consisting of layers of
aragonitic tablets encased within organic sheaths; (ii) the
calcitic prismatic layer, also containing organic macromolecules; and (iii) the outer periostracum, a thin organic
veneer that protects and decorates the shell [23]. The ante-

Structure of H. asinina shell and mantle
The juvenile shell of H. asinina is an ideal model system
with which to study the molecular events of shell construction and patterning. A complex but regular chromatic
pattern adorns the outermost layer of the shell, the periostracum. Here, a series of dots (either blue or orange) are
laid down on top of the ridges of the shell. The color of the
dot will be blue if it overlies a brown/red background, or
orange if it overlies a cream background (Figure 1a–c).
This model system is such that it allows for the spatial
mapping of gene expression profiles within the mantle to
patterning and structural events at the leading edge of the
shell.

The mineralogical composition of the shell is partitioned
dorso-ventrally into two major layers; a dorsal calcitic
layer and a ventral aragonitic layer (Figure 1d). The mantle epithelium, which secretes the proteins responsible for
the construction of these structures, is convoluted at its

anterior edge. Between the two main folds (the inner and
outer folds) lies the periostracal groove (Figure 1e–g), into
which the periostracum is secreted and then extruded
onto the dorsal surface of the shell. We have identified a
second minor fold within the mantle of H. asinina that we
have termed the anterior crease of the outer fold (Figure
1e, f and 1h). Although we cannot yet assign a specific
function to this structure, the fact that it possesses an
abundance of microvilli (Figure 1h) suggests that it is
actively secreting substances responsible for shell or periostracum construction.

Mantle expressed sequence tags
We have sequenced 530 randomly selected clones from a
cDNA library constructed from the juvenile mantle tissue
of the tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina (Linnaeus). These
sequences are available under GenBank accession numbers DW986183 to DQ298397. This tissue was taken
from juveniles maintained in warm water (26–28°C) that
were rapidly depositing shell material, approximately 50
μm per day [32]. From this survey, we have identified 331
unique EST clusters (unigenes) that are expressed in the
mantle (Figure 2; Additional file 1). Based on the presence
of conserved signal sequences and similarity to secreted
proteins in GenBank (Figure 2) we conservatively estimate
that 26% of these (85 unigenes) encode secreted proteins.
Amongst the 140 unigenes that lack both significant similarity to sequences lodged in public databases (Figure 2)
and a signal sequence, some may be secreted via mechanisms alternative to the classical signal peptide pathway.
Of the 106 intracellular unigenes that encode proteins
with significant similarity to GenBank sequences, 15
encode trafficking and mineral binding proteins, and are
likely to represent mechanisms essential for the supply of
shell building components. For example, based upon in
situ hybridization analyses (see below) and previous studies on bivalves [33,34], ferritin and calmodulin are likely
to be playing fundamental and evolutionarily ancient
roles in shell construction within the Mollusca.

When compared with EST surveys in other metazoan tissues (e.g. various mouse [35], pufferfish [36] and human
[36,37] proteomes), a markedly higher proportion (~twofold) of the genes expressed in the abalone mantle encode
secreted proteins. By extrapolation, we estimate that hundreds of proteins are released extracellularly from the
mantle, and contribute to the fabrication of the shell. This
estimate however needs to take into consideration nonbiomineralizing secreted proteins that do not possess similarity with previously described GenBank sequences. This
estimate is in marked contrast to the current number of
biomineralizing proteins isolated from the shells of other
gastropods and bivalves. With efforts chiefly focused on
the characterization of proteins from the nacreous layer
[38-41], fewer than 20 protein families have been shown

to contribute to shell formation to date [7,8]. Strikingly,
of the 85 unigenes that encode putative secreted proteins
in the Haliotis asinina mantle, 67 (80% of the secretome)
do not share significant similarity to any sequences in
GenBank (Figure 2). However, several novel secreted open
reading frames (ORFs) possess motifs comparable to proteins in other organisms, such as GGYGLGL repeats – similar to the elasticity regions of Spidroin, an elastomeric

spider silk protein [42] – and proline-rich repeats
(LXPLSXIPVXXPXAX) as found in plant cell walls [43]. In
comparison, 140 of the 246 intracellular genes (57%) do
not match sequences in GenBank.

L. scutum, which is estimated to be sequenced to 8× cover-

age and is currently being assembled [44], reveals that
only 13 of the 67 (19%) novel secreted proteins in Haliotis
appear to have identifiable homologues in the Lottia
genome (Additional file 2). These 13 genes may be
involved in conserved aspects of shell construction in gastropods and possibly other mollusks. In contrast, the
remaining 54 novel secreted proteins are likely to either
represent genes that evolved after these gastropod lineages
split, have been lost in the Lottia lineage or a combination
of these two scenarios. Likewise, many previously discovered molluskan shell matrix genes do not have clear
homologues in the Lottia genome (See Additional File 3
for results of these searches against Lottia genome traces).
The few shell matrix proteins, such as Lustrin [11], Perlucin [45] and Mucoperlin [46], are likely to be conserved
components of molluskan shells, although their general
function in shell fabrication and evolutionary origins are
currently unknown. Together, these data suggest that the
complex secretome involved in mollusk shell construction is encoded primarily by rapidly evolving genes.
Localized expression of mantle genes
In order to infer the function of a subset of these ESTs, we
selected 22 for spatial expression analysis on the basis of
whether they were novel, predicted to be secreted, possessed repetitive domains and/or shared significant similarity with a gene likely to play a role in biomineralization
(Figure 3). Of these, 11 are novel and one appears to have
a homologue only in the Lottia genome (i.e. gastropodspecific; Figure 3M). The spatial expression patterns of
these 22 mantle ESTs reveals a diversity of territories and
cell types in the mantle (Figure 3), and highlights the
modular nature of the mantle tissue [24]. Some of these
(9 of 22) are expressed homogenously in one or more
zones responsible for the creation of different shell layers.
For example, LustrinA, first isolated from Haliotis rufescens,
the gene product of which contributes to the elastomeric
properties of the nacreous layer [11,27,47-50], is
expressed, along with two other novel genes, in the mantle territory responsible for the production of the inner
nacreous layer (Figure 3X–Z). Other evolutionarily conserved genes, including calmodulin and a calcium-binding protein, are expressed continuously along the length
of the mantle within both the inner fold and the anterior
crease of the outer fold (Figure 3I–L), while others, such
as ferritin, are expressed only in the outer fold (Figure 3M,
N). The shared spatial expression of ferritin and calmodulin genes between the Bivalvia and Gastropoda suggests
they play a conserved role in the formation or modification of the periostracum [34,51]. The remaining 13 genes
analyzed here are restricted to specific mantle territories
and are expressed discontinuously along the length of the
mantle; either in the inner fold alone (Figure 3E–G), the
inner mantle fold and the anterior crease of the outer fold
(Figure 3H), the anterior crease of outer fold alone (Figure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/40

3O–V), or the anterior zone of the outer fold the mantle
(Figure 3W). The dynamic spatial expression of these
genes along the length of the mantle, regardless of precise
zone, implies that they are contributing to the patterning
of shell structure and/or coloration [52,53].
Blue pigmentation gene
Has-sometsuke (HasSom) is the only gene in this study to be
expressed in the anterior zone of the outer fold of the
mantle (Figure 3W and 4) and the only gene to map precisely to a shell pigmentation pattern (Figure 4). HasSom
transcripts are only detected in territories of the mantle
that underlie regions of the shell that are producing blue
dots and fields of red, which become blue upon de-calcification (Figure 1). Blue dots (Figure 1a) correspond to
zones of high HasSom expression relative to regions of red
(Figure 4). The relative abundance (blue dot or red field)
or absence (cream field) of this single gene product is consistent with a role in creating the juvenile shell pattern.
Interestingly, BLAST alignments indicate the derived Sometsuke protein shares weak similarity to the ependymins,
a family of rapidly evolving extracellular glycoproteins
previously only found in deuterostomes ([[54]; Supplementary Figure 1] and Additional File 4). There is currently no evidence of this protein family encoded in
ecdysozoan and basal metazoan genomes; we could not
detect an ependymin gene within the Lottia, Nematostella,
Amphimedon or Hydra genomes. Ependymin is highly
expressed in vertebrate cerebrospinal fluid [55] and may
be involved in echinoderm tissue regeneration [56]. With
disparate roles in these three phyla and apparent loss from
many genomes, it is difficult to infer the ancestral role of
this protein in the Bilateria. However, various functional
features of this protein, including its ability to bind calcium [57] and to undergo polymerization into insoluble
fibrils [55] support a role for Sometsuke in shell construction and patterning.

Conclusion
The spatial expression profiles of the genes surveyed here
support the supposition that specific mantle zones influence the crystal morphology of discrete layers of the
mature shell. Underlying these structural differences is a
zone-specific secretome. It appears likely that highly
dynamic gene expression patterns along the length of a
given mantle zone contribute to shell patterning. In the
case of juvenile H. asinina, these patterns include: the
ridge and valley architecture; the periodic formation of
respiratory pores, the regular deposition of blue and
orange colored dots on the ridges, and the swathes of
cream and red/brown fields that cover the shell. The correspondence of HasSom expression with shell coloration
indicates that there are direct relationships between gene
expression and shell patterns, which allows for under-

standing the molecular basis of structural and color patterning.
The modular design of the molluskan mantle [24,58],
along with distinct patterning mechanisms within each
zone, allows for immense variation in shell structure and
pattern in shell-building mollusks. This morphogenetic
system, combined with a complex and rapidly evolving
secretome, as revealed here, is likely to have provided the
foundation from which the incredible diversity of molluskan shell shapes and patterns has evolved. Despite the
advantages of this approach to the rapid identification of
novel biomineralizing proteins, it must be pointed out
that common post-translational modifications (glycosylation, lipid transfer etc.) that are likely to greatly increase
the diversity of the organic matrix, will not be detected by
this approach, and further underscores the fact that we are
some way from a detailed understanding of how nature
generates these functional and beautiful structures.

Methods
Library construction, sequencing and EST annotation
A directionally cloned cDNA library was constructed from
total RNA extracted from the mantle tissue of ten 7–15
mm juvenile H. asinina using a BD Biosciences SMART
library construction kit. Phages were converted into plasmid DNA following the manufacturer's instructions and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/40

sequenced using ABI chemistry v 3.1 [59]. EST sequences
were clustered using ClustalW [60,61] and inspected visually to yield consensus contiguous sequences and a nonredundant collection of ESTs. ESTs were first annotated
based on SWISSPROT and NCBI nucleotide, protein and
EST database searches at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the BLAST [62] family
of programs [63] and classified according to function
[64]. At the time of writing 900,172,457 L. scutum traces
were available from the NCBI trace archive [65]. These
traces were downloaded and searched against our dataset
using the standalone BLAST package (TBLASTx and
TBLASTn algorithms with default gap costs and the
BLOSUM62 matrix). Putative ORFs were identified in
ESTs either through sequence similarity or ORF Finder
[66] and manual inspection. Among the novel ESTs
(those ESTs sharing no significant similarity with publicly
available sequences) only ORFs larger than 50 codons,
encoded by the positive strand, and beginning with a
methionine residue were accepted. All conceptually
derived protein sequences were assessed for the presence
of a leader sequence using the SignalP 3.0 [67] server [68]
and were classified into extracellular or intracellular categories. An EST encoding a novel protein was only accepted
as destined for secretion if both SignalP 3.0 algorithms
(neural network and hidden Markov model) identified
the presence of a signal peptide and a cleavage site, and if
the Markov model probability was higher than 90% (in
most cases this was >95%). Sequences are deposited at
NCBI under accession numbers DW986183 to
DW986511. Has-vm2 and Has-lustrin have accession numbers DQ298397 and DQ298402 respectively.
In situ hybridization, histology and electron microscopy
Juveniles (1–10 mm) of H. asinina were relaxed with 1 M
MgCl2 in seawater and then fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M 3-(N-morpholino) propane sulfonic
acid pH 7.5, (MOPS), 2 mM MgSO4, 1 mM ethyleneglycoltetra-acetic acid (EGTA) and 0.5 M NaCl. Fixed animals
were then washed five times with 100% ethanol and
stored in 75% ethanol at -20°C. All DIG-labeled riboprobes were produced using either SP6, T3 or T7 RNA
polymerase and a PCR amplicon of the desired clone. Several sense controls were performed with probes of various
GC contents and lengths to assess background patterns.
Endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity of the mantle
tissue was also assessed and found not to be present following the in situ procedure. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) was performed as previously described
[69] usually at a hybridization temperature of 62°C. Sections (6 μm) were produced by mounting juveniles that
had undergone WMISH in EPON 812 and sectioning
using a Leica Ultracut T. Prior to WMISH shells were
removed by incubation in 1× PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde
and 350 mM EDTA. Gene expression within the mantle

was correlated to shell patterning activity by photographing individual shells prior to decalcification and relating
this to WMISH results.

For transmission electron microscopy, juveniles were
relaxed as described above and mantle tissue was dissected and processed according to [70]. Briefly, tissue was
prefixed in low osmium (0.05% OsO4 in 4% glutaraldehyde, 0.2 M Na cacodylate, 0.1 M NaCl and 0.35 M
sucrose, pH 7.2) for 10 min. This was followed with a primary fixation in the same fixative, but lacking osmium,
for 1 h. The tissue was then washed twice in buffer (0.3 M
NaCl and 0.2 M Na cacodylate, pH 7.2) before a post fixation in osmium (1% OsO4, 0.3 M NaCl and 0.2 M Na
cacodylate, pH 7.2) for 1 h. Samples were then dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, embedded in
EPON 812 and 60 nm sections taken using a Leica
Ultracut T. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate and viewed in a JEOL JEM 1010 transmission
electron microscope at 80 kV.

manually optimized. Arrows indicate conserved cysteine residues that are
characteristic of the ependymin proteins [54]. Red arrow indicates the
presence of a cysteine residue only in the H. asinina, S. purpuratus and
amphioxus sequences. Asterisk indicates the loss of a cysteine residue in S.
purpuratus. Figures following alignments are percentage identities and
percentage positives respectively and were generated by significant pairwise bl2seq alignments between HasSom and each individual sequence.

For scanning electron microscopy, whole juveniles with
the shell removed were fixed and dehydrated as described
above, then infiltrated and dried overnight in hexamethyldisilisane. Juveniles and unfixed shells were mounted
on stubs, sputter-coated with platinum and viewed in a
JEOL JSM 6300 scanning electron microscope at 15 kV.
