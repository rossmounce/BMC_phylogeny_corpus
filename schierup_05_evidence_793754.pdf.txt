Abstract
Background: The advent of live-attenuated vaccines against measles virus during the 1960'ies
changed the circulation dynamics of the virus. Earlier the virus was indigenous to countries
worldwide, but now it is mediated by a limited number of evolutionary lineages causing sporadic
outbreaks/epidemics of measles or circulating in geographically restricted endemic areas of Africa,
Asia and Europe. We expect that the evolutionary dynamics of measles virus has changed from a
situation where a variety of genomic variants co-circulates in an epidemic with relatively high
probabilities of co-infection of the individual to a situation where a co-infection with strains from
evolutionary different lineages is unlikely.
Results: We performed an analysis of the partial sequences of the hemagglutinin gene of 18
measles virus strains collected in Denmark between 1965 and 1983 where vaccination was first
initiated in 1987. The results were compared with those obtained with strains collected from other
parts of the world after the initiation of vaccination in the given place. Intergenomic recombination
among pre-/early-vaccination strains is suggested by 1) estimations of linkage disequilibrium
between informative sites, 2) the decay of linkage disequilibrium with distance between informative
sites and 3) a comparison of the expected number of homoplasies to the number of apparent
homoplasies in the most parsimonious tree. No significant evidence of recombination could be
demonstrated among strains circulating at present.
Conclusion: We provide evidence that recombination can occur in measles virus and that it has
had a detectable impact on sequence evolution of pre-vaccination samples. We were not able to
detect recombination from present-day sequence surveys. We believe that the decreased rate of
visible recombination may be explained by changed dynamics, since divergent strains do not meet
very often in current epidemics that are often spawned by a single sequence type. Signs of prevaccination recombination events in the present-day sequences are not strong enough to be
detectable.

Background
Measles virus (MV) has a genome with negative polarity,
consisting of non-segmented single-stranded RNA of
approximately 15.9 kb. MV belongs to the Paramyxoviridae
family in the order of Mononegavirales and only a single
serotype is known. It is among the most infectious viruses
known for humans, and no other host species has been
identified. Only human populations of a considerable
size are able to sustain circulation [1]. Global vaccination
programs have resulted in a dramatic decline in measles
cases and the documented discontinuation of indigenous
circulation in a number of countries [2-4] has encouraged
authorities to accomplish global control of measles. However, measles still cause a large number of deaths every
year, mainly in developing countries, where endemic circulation of MV is still ongoing [5,6] as a result of poor vaccination coverage.
Intergenomic recombination has been documented in a
vast number of virus species within most families of RNA
and DNA viruses. Recombination can allow variants of a
population to escape from the current fitness peak (escape
from Muller's ratchet) and re-appear with a new phenotypic make-up and/or even re-establish in a new host-relationship [7,8]. However, recombination has never
convincingly been documented in species of the Mononegavirales, and it is speculated whether this reflects an inability of these viruses to recombine. Yet, the order of
Mononegavirales comprises groups of viruses with an
apparently large evolutionary potential with frequent
shifts of host species. Over the past decades, a considerable number of Mononegavirales members causing diseases
in host species in which they had not previously been recognized have been identified. Examples are phocid distemper virus [9], Hendra virus [10], Menangele virus [11],
Nipah virus [12] – not to forget the re-emerging divergent
members of the Filoviridae (Marburg -and Ebola-like
viruses) [see [13,14]]. The origins of these emerging
viruses have not been identified and the mechanism(s) of
their ability to explore new niches remains enigmatic.
Co-infection of host cells with phylogenetically distinct
virus strains is required for recombination events to be
detectable in sequence surveys. As a result of the global
vaccination against measles a situation of endemic co-circulation of multiple strains [5,6,15] shifted to a situation
with a limited number of strains being re-introduced to
susceptible subpopulations in major geographical regions
[2-4,16]. By sequencing part of the hemagglutinin gene
[15], we recently characterized 18 MV strains collected
during the pre-/early-vaccination era in Denmark. In the
present study, the partial sequence of the hemagglutinin
coding region of those older strains is subjected to further
analysis and compared with strains sampled after vaccination (generally more recently identified) using various

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/52

approaches to test for the presence of intergenomic
recombination.

Results and discussion
The term pre-/early-vaccination era isolates used for isolates
collected in Denmark during the period of 1965–83 is
meant to reflect that these isolates are from a period when
vaccination against measles was not practiced in Denmark
but was gradually becoming common practice in many
other countries in the World. Thus, it cannot be excluded
that vaccination in other countries influenced measles
virus strains circulating in Denmark at the time, but it is
anticipated that these isolates still bear valuable information on the nature of strains circulating before an influence of vaccination was imposed.
Table 1 compares differences in basic population genetics
of the data sets of the pre-/early- and post-vaccination
eras. As might be expected, the global post-vaccination
data set shows more sequence variability than the Danish
pre-/early-vaccination era data set, whereas the latter
shows relatively more singletons, i.e. variants present only
in a single sequence. Some of these singletons might be
sequencing errors in the pre-/early-vaccination sequences
caused by partial degradation as also observed in other
ancient DNA studies [33]. Sequencing errors may also
explain the higher proportions of transversion substitutions (changes between purine and pyremidine base
pairs) and the higher dn/ds ratio in the pre-/early-vaccination data set. For these reasons, singletons are not considered in any of the recombination analyses. Informative
sites (i.e. non-singletons) are considered unlikely to be
artefacts of the sequencing procedure, since one would
not expect the same error to occur more than once, and all
informative sites in the pre-/early-vaccination sample are
also informative sites in the post-vaccination sample.
Codon usage bias measured as the effective number of
codons (ENC) is low in both data sets.
Figure 1a shows a minimum evolution tree of the 40 postvaccination era isolates. The tree is topologically almost
identical to the one of Christensen et al. [15] and bootstrap values support many of the genome types identified
at present even though the tree is based on only 800 base
pairs of the hemagglutinin gene for direct comparison
with the pre-/early-vaccination sample [17-19].
Figure 1b shows a tree with the same sequences as in Figure 1a, but adding the 18 pre-/early-vaccination era isolates from Denmark. As shown previously [15], the
Danish isolates cluster with genome types A, C2 and E. It
is also clear that the inclusion of pre-/early-vaccination era
samples makes the distinction of these three genome
types less obvious since the similarity distances between
post-vaccination era representatives of the genome types

A, C2 and E are broken down to the sum of minor differences between the pre-/early-vaccination era isolates. This
might reflect that the pre-/early-vaccination era sequences
are generally older than the rest and thus at the basis of
division of genome types as are also the strains used for
vaccine development (e.g. Edmonston). Alternatively, frequent recombination among pre-/early-vaccination era
genome types at that time would lead to a poorly resolved
tree. Less recombination among different surviving strains
after vaccination would then lead to the more differentiated genome types seen today. The subsequent recombination analysis addresses this possibility.

in Figure 2 are not incompatible with one another in the
post-vaccination data set even though it contains all of the
segregating sites. Thus, if the patterns observed in Table 1
were due to convergent evolution of groups of functionally important sites in different lineages, such convergent
evolution does not play an important a role in present-day
evolution of measles virus. The proportion of pairs of
informative sites which is incompatible by the four gamete test is 43% in the pre-/early-vaccination data set as
compared to only 23% in the post-vaccination data set
even though the variability in general is lower among the
pre-/early-vaccination sequences.

Analysis of recombination
Figure 2 shows all the segregating sites for the pre-/earlyvaccination era sequences with positions marked by base
pair, and whether a substitution is synonymous or nonsynonymous or both (for multiple hits and complex
codons). It is immediately clear that many incompatibilities (by the four-gamete test [27]) exist, but also that
apparent groups of physically close sites are incompatible
with other such groups. We identified by eye five such
groups of informative sites and marked them with different colours. Comparing these five groups by the four gamete test demonstrates that some pairs of blocks are
incompatible with the same evolutionary tree (Fig. 2b).
Even though the identification of these groups is subjective, the presence of such groups suggests either that they
have evolved on different evolutionary trees (i.e. recombination) or, alternatively, each of the sites for a given group
has mutated at least twice, i.e. by parallel mutations, at
approximately the same time (since there is strong linkage
disequilibrium within all groups except block 1). Note
that the incompatibilities within e.g. block 1 do not
weaken this conclusion. A similar table was prepared for
the post-vaccination era data set. Here we were not able to
visually identify groups of sites failing to satisfy the fourgamete test (results not shown), and the blocks identified

One way to distinguish whether incompatibilities are
caused by parallel mutations (i.e. true homoplasies) or by
recombination is to correlate linkage disequilibrium (LD)
between sets of informative sites to distance. Recombination causes a decrease in linkage disequilibrium and more
recombination is expected between sites that are further
apart from each other. The block structure of close sites is
visualised in a different way in Figure 3, which shows all
the significant cases of linkage disequilibrium. Visual
inspection of the Figure suggests that physically close sites
appear to be more likely to be in strong LD than sites far
apart. This observation is tested more formally by correlating LD with distance (Table 2 and Figure 4). Table 2 shows
the correlation of two commonly used measures of LD for
both data sets. A significant negative correlation is
observed by both measures of linkage disequilibrium in
the pre-/early-vaccination data set, whereas the post-vaccination data set does not show any significant decay of
linkage disequilibrium with distance. The decrease in
linkage disequilibrium with distance for the pre-/earlyvaccination sequences is shown graphically in Figure 4.
An analysis of expected number of homoplasies caused by
parallel mutations and the number of apparent homoplasies in the most parsimonious tree was performed on the

pre-/early-vaccination data set [see [32,35]]. The basic
idea is to investigate whether the number of apparent
homoplasies in the most parsimonious tree is likely to be
due to parallel (recurrent) mutations. If this is not the
case, it is a strong indication of recombination since
recombination easily creates "incompatible pairs of sites",
i.e. pairs of sites that do not fit into the same phylogenetic
tree, and thus will appear as homoplasies if assuming no
recombination and a single phylogenetic tree. There are
800 sites. Of these, 267 are third position sites, and
among these we observe 20 transition mutations. If we
assume equal mutation rates at all third position sites,
then the number of transition mutations we expect have
happened while observing 20 different ones is 20.8+/-0.9

(calculated as the sum of geometric distributions). In the
most parsimonious tree found using PAUP*, there are 26
transition mutations. In other words, given the observed
number of mutation events of the transition type, we
expect 0.8+/-0.9 parallel mutations/homoplasies under
the assumption of no recombination (and no codon
usage bias). We observe, however, 6 parallel mutations in
the tree. This suggests that some of the apparent homoplasies resulted from recombination rather than from recurrent mutations. We also calculated the effective sites
number [35] from the observed codon usage bias. However, since the codon usage bias is low, the effect is minor,
and only 1.0+/-1.0 homoplasies are expected under this
model, again significantly smaller than the six apparent

homoplasies. A large amount of mutation rate heterogeneity at the synonymous sites offers an alternative explanation of the excess homoplasies. While this explanation
cannot be ruled out, analysis of the post-vaccination data
set does not support large rate heterogeneity at silent sites
in the evolution of present-day measles virus, since the
number of homoplasies in this data set can be explained
by recurrent mutations (results not shown).
Given these different lines of evidence for recombination,
it is of interest to try to estimate the rate of recombination
needed to explain the data. The most appropriate method
is the finite site, composite likelihood approach implemented in LDhat [31]. The result (Table 2) is that a significantly positive recombination rate is found in the pre-/
early-vaccination sequences, much reflecting the results of
the similar R2 test. An estimated rate of ρ = 15.8 corresponds to that an expected 45 recombination events have
happened in the ancestral history of the 18 pre-/early-vaccination sequences. The estimated recombination rate
appears smaller than rates reported for HIV and other
viruses [31]. The estimated recombination rate in the

In conclusion, the analysis of pre-/early-vaccination era
MV sequences shows evidence of recombination at rates
important to the evolution of MV. The five different tests
of recombination should not be considered independent
tests and some of the results might be explained by
alternative mechanisms such as convergent evolution of
functionally important sites and rate heterogeneity of synonymous variation. However, all tests agree and provide
evidence of recombination both through an excess of
apparent homoplasies compared to the expected frequency of parallel mutations, and through a decrease in
LD with distance, which is difficult to explain by any other
hypothesis than recombination. Furthermore, it is difficult to imagine a mechanism other than recombination
by which apparent homoplasies could occur pairwise or
in triplets in distant parts of the sequence considering also
that such patterns are not seen in the post-vaccination
data set.

The evidence of recombination among pre-/early-vaccination era MV strains and the lack of detection of recombination among post-vaccination era MV strains are
consistent with the shift in epidemiology from a situation
of co-circulation of strains in populations to a bottleneck
situation with incidental introduction of a single strain to
a susceptible sub-population of a geographical region.
Given that intergenomic recombination and co-infection
of individuals are common phenomena of MV it might be
assumed that the lineages surviving till today did emerge
from a pool of recombining pre-vaccination era strains. A
lower level or absence of recombination due to changed
epidemiology since then has erased our ability to detect
recombination in a global sample of present day MV
despite its high level of variability. It is possible that the
Danish pre-/early-vaccination era strains are representatives of the very pool in which recombination took place
while present-day MV strains are representatives of temporally and/or geographically separated lineages. Analysing informative sites in other parts of the MV genome of
present-day lineages render it unlikely that these lineages

could have derived from a clonal population structure of
a global pool of MV strains (L. S. Christensen, unpublished data).
The template for replication in members of the Paramyxovirinae is a nucleocapsid complex in which each nucleocapsid monomer (N) is predicted to be associated by
hydrophobic bonds with 6 nucleotides in such a way as to
resist non-ionic detergent and high salt and to protect the
RNA from RNase digestion [36]. This tight association of
RNA and protein has been dubbed "the rule of six" and
excludes the intracellular presence of naked viral RNA
molecules. It raises the question of the mechanism of RNA
polymerase template recognition and has provided an
explanation of the hypothesis that recombination possibly cannot occur in this group of viruses. Our data suggests that a mechanism of partial unwinding of the
nucleocapsid structure exists to allow homologous intergenomic recombination or RNA polymerase template shift
during replication.

Conclusion
Measles virus appear to possess the ability to recombine
but the present-day epidemiology of the virus where different sequence types rarely or never meet make the
impact of recombination on the distribution of sequence
diversity negligible. However, in the prevaccination area,
endemic MV allowed more divergent strains to meet and
recombine. The present-day strains are thus descendants
of recombined sequences but the signal of the early
recombination is lost in present-day sequences.

Methods
Sequence data
The Danish pre-/early-vaccination sequences consist of an
800 base-pair region (nt. 659 to 1458) of the hemagglutinin coding region of 18 strains collected in Denmark,
Greenland and the Faeroe Islands between 1965 and 1983
(GenBank accession numbers AJ417850-AJ417867) [15].
Post-vaccination sequences of 40 strains, representative of
the 22 phylogenetic clusters identified [17-19], were
trimmed to match the region of the pre-/early-vaccination
era sequences. GenBank accession numbers of 33 of these
sequences can be found in [15]. The remaining 7 HA
sequences that complete the list of globally circulating
genome types, identified at present, are those of strains

Sequence analysis
The alignment of the 18 pre-/early-vaccination and 40
post-vaccination sequences does not contain any gaps.
The computer program DnaSP 3.99 [24] was used for estimation of standard parameters of population genetics.
Segregating sites were classified as synonymous or nonsynonymous, except for complex codons where a site may
be classified as both. Phylogenetic trees from the post-vaccination data set and the two data sets combined were
built using MEGA 2.1 [25] and the minimum evolution
criterion. The HKY substitution model [26] was assumed.
Bootstrap values were estimated from 2000 re-samples.

Recombination was examined using five different, but
complementary, approaches. (i) A graphical method by
which sets of sites in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD)
were visually identified and marked with different
colourings (Fig. 2). It was then investigated whether different sets of blocks were incompatible by the four-gamete
test [27]. If blocks are incompatible, one will infer either
recombination or recurrent mutation of the sites in a
block at about the same time. (ii) A plot of significant
pairwise linkage disequilibria was constructed using
DnaSP. (iii) Decay of linkage disequilibrium with distance (measured as either the squared correlation coefficient R2 or the standardized measure D') was investigated
following [28] and estimated using the R2-program [29].
Analysis was restricted to informative sites. (iv) Estimation of the scaled population recombination rate ρ by a
composite maximum likelihood approach [30], using the
LDhat program of [31]. This program also allows a test of
the null hypothesis of no recombination (ρ = 0) by a permutation test. This analysis was also restricted to informative sites. (v) Comparison of the expected number of
homoplasies to the number of apparent homoplasies in
the most parsimonious phylogenetic tree, closely following the approach of [32], using PAUP* [32].
