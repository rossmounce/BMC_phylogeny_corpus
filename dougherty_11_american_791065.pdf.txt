Abstract
Background: Western diets increase colon cancer risk. Epidemiological evidence and experimental studies suggest
that ginseng can inhibit colon cancer development. In this study we asked if ginseng could inhibit Western diet
(20% fat) promoted colonic tumorigenesis and if compound K, a microbial metabolite of ginseng could suppress
colon cancer xenograft growth.
Methods: Mice were initiated with azoxymethane (AOM) and, two weeks later fed a Western diet (WD, 20% fat)
alone, or WD supplemented with 250-ppm ginseng. After 1 wk, mice received 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)
for 5 days and were sacrificed 12 wks after AOM. Tumors were harvested and cell proliferation measured by Ki67
staining and apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Levels of EGF-related signaling molecules and apoptosis regulators were
determined by Western blotting. Anti-tumor effects of intraperitoneal compound K were examined using a tumor
xenograft model and compound K absorption measured following oral ginseng gavage by UPLC-mass
spectrometry. Effects of dietary ginseng on microbial diversity were measured by analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA.
Results: Ginseng significantly inhibited colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis and concomitantly reduced
proliferation and increased apoptosis. The EGFR cascade was up-regulated in colonic tumors and ginseng
significantly reduced EGFR and ErbB2 activation and Cox-2 expression. Dietary ginseng altered colonic microbial
diversity, and bacterial suppression with metronidazole reduced serum compound K following ginseng gavage.
Furthermore, compound K significantly inhibited tumor xenograft growth.
Conclusions: Ginseng inhibited colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis promoted by Western diet. We speculate
that the ginseng metabolite compound K contributes to the chemopreventive effects of this agent in colonic
tumorigenesis.

Background
Colon cancer arises from activating mutations in oncogenes and inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor
genes. While hereditary forms of this disease arise from
germline mutations such as loss of function mutations
in the adenomatous polyposis coli (apc) gene, most
colon cancers are sporadic and involve somatic

mutations in apc or other genes. Environmental especially dietary factors are believed to contribute substantially to the risk of colon cancer development [1,2]. In
this regard Western diets that are rich in Western style
fats have been shown to promote colon cancer in
experimental models [2,3]. We recently showed that epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) were required
for tumor promotion by Western diet [4,5]. In the presence of a Western diet, EGFR signals increased protooncogene MYC and pro-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2

(Cox-2). Since therapies for advanced cancers have limited efficacy, increasing attention has focused on chemopreventive approaches. Efforts to inhibit up-regulated
EGFR signals that occur with Western diets might provide such a strategy to prevent these cancers.
Complementary and alternative medicines are widely
used for a variety of health purposes. Many of these
agents are well tolerated and some have served as lead
compounds for developing more effective anti-cancer
agents. Several retrospective case-control studies in
Korea have supported chemopreventive effects of ginseng that appears to exert a broad spectrum of antitumor activities in humans [6-9]. Ginseng is a deciduous
perennial plant belonging to the Araliaceae Ivy family
that has been used for centuries in China and Korea as
an anti-inflammatory agent [10]. Ginseng extracts contain ginsenosides as the major biologically active constituents, which are glycosides with a dammarane skeleton
[11]. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated antitumor effects of ginseng alone or in combination with
anti-cancer agents [12-15]. Antioxidant, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of ginseng have been
identified that may mediate the anti-tumor effects of
this herb [16,17]. In addition, ginseng metabolites have
been shown to inhibit EGFR-induced epithelial cell
growth [18]. Moreover, a recent study in a model of
colitis-associated colon cancer showed that ginseng
reduced levels of phospho-active EGFR and phosphoactive ErbB2 as well as ERK, a down stream effector of
EGFR, indicating ginseng could suppress EGFR signals
in colonic tumorigenesis [19]. Given the requirement for
EGFR in tumor promotion by Western diet, in the current study we investigated the ability of ginseng extract
to inhibit colonic tumorigenesis under conditions of
Western dietary stress. Tumors were induced with azoxymethane (AOM) followed by dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS). Azoxymethane is a pro-carcinogen that is metabolized in the liver and further metabolized in the colon
to an active alkylating agent, presumably a methyl carbonium ion [20]. This methyl donor leads to guanine
methylations and eventually G to A transitions [21].
Proto-oncogenes targeted by AOM include activating
mutations in b-catenin and K-Ras [21]. DSS is a polysulfated polymer that arrests colonic crypt cell re-generation leading to acute mucosal ulceration and clinical
colitis that enhances tumorigenesis [22].
A number of studies have identified several bacterial
metabolites of ginseng with biological activities [23-26].
These include 20-O-b-(D-glucopyranosyl)-20(S)-protopanaxadiol or compound K that induces apoptosis in
colon cancer cells [27-29]. Since the microbiome is
essential for compound K generation, we examined the
effects of dietary ginseng on microbial diversity and
effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics on compound K

bioavailability. Several ginsenosides have been shown to
inhibit cancer growth, including colon cancer cells in
tumor xenograft models [15,30-34]. To directly test
compound K anti-tumor activity in colon cancer, we
also examined the effects of this microbial metabolite of
ginseng on colon cancer cell growth in a tumor xenograft model.
Taken together, in this study we demonstrate for the
first time that ginseng can inhibit inflammation-associated colonic tumorigenesis in mice fed a tumor-promoting Western diet. Furthermore, compound K, a
bacterial metabolite of ginsenoside Rb1, directly inhibits
colon cancer cell growth in vivo.

Methods
Ginseng extraction and chemical analysis

American ginseng root powder was obtained from Wisconsin Ginseng Board (Wausau, Wisconsin). Five

hundred grams of ginseng was extracted in 10 vol 70%
ethanol under reflux for 2 h in a water bath kept at 9095°C. The filtrate was collected and the extraction procedure repeated on the residue. The residue was discarded after the second extraction. The filtrates were
combined and passed through filter paper. Filtrate was
evaporated under vacuum. The extract was dissolved in
500 ml water and extracted 4 times (125 ml × 4) in
water-saturated n-butanol. The n-butanol phase was
evaporated under vacuum, and lyophilized. All solvents
used for extraction were US pharmacopoeia (USP) purity. The ratio of starting material (dried American ginseng) to final ginseng extract was approximately 10:1.
The ginsenosides in the extract were characterized by
UF-HPLC as described [14,36]. The ginsenoside concentrations (mg/gram extract) were Rg1, 14.0; Re, 197.9;
Rb1, 341.8; Rc, 34.2; Rb2, 4.6; Rb3, 6.8; Rd, 65.0; Rg3,
0.6 as reported [37].
Tumor Induction

Use of animals for these studies was approved under the
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) at University of Chicago, which
complies with the guidelines outlined by the National
Institutes of Health. A/J male mice weighing 20-22
grams were acclimated for 2 wks on AIN-76A chow.
We followed a modified protocol to induce colitis-associated colon cancer [22]. Mice received a single dose of
azoxymethane (AOM) 10 mg/kg body weight or saline
(AOM vehicle). Two wks later mice were randomized to
receive a Western diet (20% fat) or Western diet supplemented with 250-ppm ethanol/butanol extracted American ginseng. Western diet was 20% fat and included
beef tallow (35 gm/kg), lard (30 gm/kg) and corn oil (80
gm/kg). Detailed composition of WD was reported [35].
We calculated that the ginseng dose was approximately
0.875 mg ginseng extract/mouse/day. One wk after
starting Western diet, mice received 2.5% DSS in the
drinking water × 5 days. DSS-induced clinical colitis was
assessed as described [38]. It should be noted that there
were no endoscopically visible tumors for several weeks
after DSS. Mice were sacrificed 12 wks after AOM treatment and tumors and colonic mucosa harvested. The
protocol is summarized in Figure 1A. A/J mice are very
sensitive to AOM [39], and thus only one dose of AOM
followed by one cycle of DSS was sufficient to induce
tumors in these mice. Fifteen min prior to sacrifice mice
were treated with peroxovanadate as described to lock
in phospho-EGFR signals [40,41]. Tumors were divided
and one aliquot was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for
histology. Colonic mucosa and another aliquot of tumor
were flash frozen for Western blotting.
Tumor histology

Tumor histological features were assessed by a GI
pathologist (JH). Adenomas were defined as neoplastic

Page 3 of 11

lesions characterized by abnormal glandular architecture
with branching or elongated crypts. Cytologically, these
lesions exhibited hyperchromatic, elongated and pseudostratified nuclei with mildly increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios. Adenomas with carcinoma in situ
exhibited marked glandular complexity, including areas
with a cribriform configuration and marked cytological
atypia, characterized by large irregular nuclei and loss of
nuclear polarity.
Mouse colonoscopy

Colonoscopy was performed using Karl Storz-Endoskope
to monitor colitis and tumor development as described
[42]. The colonoscope was advanced 4 cm proximal to
the anus. If needed, water was used to irrigate the
colon. In some cases, the colonoscope was advanced to
the cecum if there was no resistance. Careful visual
inspection with white light was performed upon withdrawal. During endoscope withdrawal, lesions were
described and endoscopic pictures captured. External 5
mm marking on the colonoscope were used to estimate
lesion location within the colon.
Western Blotting

Proteins were extracted in SDS-containing Laemmli buffer, quantified by RC-DC protein assay and subjected to
Western blotting as described (4). Briefly, proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-20% resolving polyacrylamide gradient gel and electroblotted to PVDF membrane. Prestained molecular markers were included in
each gel. Blots were incubated overnight at 4°C with
specific primary antibodies followed by 1 hr incubation
with appropriate peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies that were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
using X OMAT film. Xerograms were digitized using an
Epson scanner (San Jose, CA) and band intensity quantified using UN-SCAN-IT gel software (V 5.3, Silk Scientific, Orem UT). Protein levels in tumors were
normalized to b-actin levels and expressed as fold of
control colonic mucosa (means ± SD). Protein lysates
from tumors and control colonic mucosa with equal
protein abundance as assessed by RC-DC assays showed
comparable b-actin levels by Western blotting. Tumors
of comparable stage (adenomas) were used for Western
blotting comparisons.
Immunostaining

Five-micron sections were mounted on Vectabondcoated Superfrost Plus slides. Sections were heated to
60°C for 1 hr, deparaffinized by 3 washes × 5 min in
xylene, hydrated in a graded series of ethanol washes
and rinsed in distilled water. Epitope retrieval for Ki67 was achieved by pressure cooker for 15 min in
Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9 followed by 3 washes × 2 min
in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST).
Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with
methanol/H2O2 solution (0.5%). Sections were washed

Figure 1 Ginseng inhibits colitis and colonic tumorigenesis in mice on Western diet. A. Protocol for tumor induction. Mice received AOM
at wk 2. WD was initiated at wk 4 and DSS was given beginning in wk 5. Mice were sacrificed in wk 14. B. Time course of DSS colitis. Animals
were treated as shown in Figure 1A. DSS induced colitis was scored as disease activity index (DAI) based on weight loss, diarrhea and bleeding
as described [38]. Values were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 7 AOM/DSS, n = 5 AOM/DSS + ginseng; *p < 0.05, compared to Western diet
alone). Ginseng significantly delayed onset of colitis and appeared to limit peak inflammation. C. Tumor multiplicity. Mice were treated as
described in Figure. 1A and sacrificed 12 wks after AOM. Tumor histology was determined by standard criteria. Tumor multiplicity was calculated
using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (n = 7 AOM/DSS, n = 5 AOM/DSS + ginseng; *p < 0.05 compared to AOM/DSS alone). Note that ginseng
significantly inhibited total tumor multiplicity and the number of adenomas/mouse. D. Colonoscopy detects colitis and tumors. Shown are
representative colonoscopic views of control mice (left panel), mice with colitis 5 days after DSS (middle panel) and mice with tumors 12 wks
after AOM (right panel). Note the increased mucosal erythema in the colitis-bearing mouse and intraluminal mass in the tumor-bearing mouse
(black arrows).

3 times in TBST × 2 min and blocked in Protein Block
for 20 min. Sections were incubated with 1:300 dilution of anti-Ki67 antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. After 3 TBST washes, slides were incubated at
room temperature with 1:200 dilution of biotinylated
secondary antibodies for 30 min. Antigen-antibody
complexes were detected using an HRP labeled DAKO
EnVision™+ System and 3,3’-diaminobenzidine as substrate. For negative controls, sections were incubated
with isotype matched non-immune antibodies. After
washing in distilled water, slides were stained with
Gill’s III hematoxylin, rinsed with water, dehydrated in
ethanol and cleared with xylene. For TUNEL assay,
epitopes were retrieved by treatment with protease1
digestion for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking endogenous peroxidases with hydrogen peroxide,
tissues were incubated in equilibration buffer and treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)

enzyme to detect TUNEL-positive nuclei as suggested
by the manufacturer (Roche Scientific, Indianapolis
IN). Tissues were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies and color developed with diaminobenzidine (DAB). After
counterstaining with methyl green, sections were protected with cover slip secured with mounting medium.
Tumors of comparable histology (adenomas) were used
for all immunostaining comparisons.
Immunostaining Quantitation

Ki67 nuclear staining and TUNEL positive cells were
quantified by the automated Aperio Scanning imaging
system (Vista CA). Proliferation was expressed as %
nuclei positive for Ki67. Color-specific thresholds were
used to determine brown (Ki67 positive) and blue (Ki67
negative) nuclei within the outlined regions of interest
to calculate the fraction of positively stained nuclei. Cell
death was scored as % nuclei positive for TUNEL. At

least 5 fields per tumor and 3 tumors per group
(~50,000 cells/condition) were scanned for quantitation.
Tumor Xenografts

For tumor xenograft studies, HCT116 cells obtained
from ATCC were cultured as described previously [5].
Cells (5 × 10^6) were implanted subcutaneously into the
flanks of athymic immunodeficient nude mice (nu/nu
mice). Tumors were allowed to grow for one week prior
to treatment with compound K or vehicle (DMSO).
Mice were treated daily with compound K (30 mg/kg
body wt) or DMSO. Tumor dimensions were measured
serially with a vernier calipers and tumor volume calculated as (width)2 × length/2. Tumor size was estimated
from volumes assuming a density of 1 gram/ml. Mice
were sacrificed and tumors harvested 4 wks after
implantation.
Analysis of microbial 16S rRNA

Mice were randomized to receive Western diet or Western diet supplemented with 250 ppm ginseng. Two
weeks after starting on the diet, fresh stool was collected
and bacterial DNA extracted. Clone library preparation
and sequencing analyses of bacterial genes encoding 16S
rRNA were performed as described [43]. 16S rRNA
gene sequences were amplified from DNA samples
using primers 8F (5’-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCT-CAG3’) and 1492R (5’-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3’) for
the conserved domain of bacterial 16S rRNA. PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles using Takara highfidelity Ex Taq (Takara Mirus Bio, Madison, WI, USA)
with an annealing temperature of 58°C. PCR products
were purified by QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) and cloned into pCR-2.1-TOPO® vectors
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using the TOPO-TA Cloning
Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. From
each library, 100 colonies were picked randomly and
processed for DNA sequencing using 8F as the sequencing primer.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

The 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed as
described previously [43]. Briefly, raw sequence data
were processed by base-calling, quality-trimming and
alignment, using the RDP pipeline server at the Ribosomal Database Project II (RDP-II) website http://rdp.
cme.msu.edu/pipeline. Potential chimeric sequences
were checked and excluded as appropriate using the
SimRank 2.7 package available through the RDP. The
RDP-II classifier analysis tool and NCBI BLAST tool
were used to assign 16S rRNA sequences to the taxonomical hierarchy at phylum level. For principal coordinate analysis (PCA), all 16S rRNA gene sequences
were imported using the ARB software package and
aligned into a phylogenetic tree, which was used to
perform clustering analysis without abundance

weighting using online UniFrac. All sequences will be
deposited in the GenBank nucleotide sequence databases post-publication.
Measurements of Rb1 and compound K in mouse sera

Mice were given unsupplemented drinking water or
drinking water supplemented with metronidazole (600
μg/ml) for 5 days. Mice were then gavaged with 500
mg/kg ginseng extract. At indicated times mice were
sacrificed and blood obtained for plasma measurements
of ginsenoside Rb1 and compound K by UPLC/MSTOF analysis. Mouse plasma was mixed with 20 μL of
internal standard (digoxin, 10 μg/ml). The plasma sample was diluted with 1 ml of saline and purified by
solid-phase extraction (SPE) with a Sep-Pak C8 Vac 3cc
500 mg cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). The purified
eluate, containing ginsenosides and metabolites, was
evaporated to dryness at 40°C under nitrogen and dissolved in 200 μL methanol. Chromatographic separation
was performed on an Agilent 1200 series (Agilent, Germany) liquid chromatographic system at 25°C using an
Agilent ZorBax Extend-C18 UPLC column (50 × 2.1
mm, 1.8 μm). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (B). Gradient elution started with 82% solvent A and 18% solvent B,
changed to 21% B for 6 min, then changed to 26% B
for 1 min and held for 2 min; changed to 27% B for 4
min and held for 1 min; changed to 30% B for 3 min;
changed to 36% B for 5 min; changed to 50% B for 3
min and held for 2 min; changed to 33% B for 5 min.
The flow rate was kept at 0.4 ml/min, and the sample
volume injected was set at 2 μL. The TOF/MS analysis
was performed in full-scan mode with an electrospray
ionization (ESI) source and the mass range was set at
mass to charge ratio (m/z) 100-1500 in negative mode.
The acquisition and analysis of data were controlled by
Agilent LC-MS TOF software, version A.01.00 and
Applied Biosystems/MDS-SCIEX Analyst QS software,
respectively. A calibration curve was used to calculate
the compound concentration in samples. The curve
plots the concentration of the standard (x-axis) against
the area ratio of Rb1 or compound K/internal standard
(y-axis). The measured sample area ratio then allows
estimation of sample concentration from the calibration
curve.
Statistical Methods

Continuous data were expressed as means ± SD, and
compared using Student’s t-test. Tumor multiplicity was
defined as the average number of tumors in a given
group. Tumor multiplicity was compared using negative
binomial regression and significance calculated using the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test [44]. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata v. 10, and p-values <
0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Ginseng inhibits AOM/DSS-induced colitis and
tumorigenesis under Western diet

The study protocol is summarized in Figure 1A. As
expected DSS induced clinical colitis as assessed by disease activity index that was scored as described [38]. As
shown in Figure 1B, ginseng significantly delayed the
onset of DSS-induced clinical colitis and appeared to
reduce maximal inflammation. At the time of sacrifice
there was minimal histological inflammation present.
Ginseng significantly reduced tumor multiplicity from
15.6 ± 3.1 in the Western diet group to 5.1 ± 2.3 (p <
0.05) in the group receiving Western diet and ginseng
(Figure 1C). There were also significantly fewer adenomas in the ginseng group (p < 0.05), and a trend
towards fewer cancers (p = 0.08) as shown in Figure 1C.
During the study we examined mice by colonoscopy to
monitor inflammation and tumor development. Representative colonoscopic views of control mice, mice with
colitis and mice with colonic tumors are shown in Figure 1D.
Ginseng inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis in
AOM/DSS tumors

To elucidate the effects of ginseng on proliferation and
apoptotic cell death we examined tumors for Ki67 and

proliferation and increased apoptotic cell death. Quantitation of proliferation and cell death in colonic tumors
are summarized in Table 1. Ginseng caused nearly a
50% reduction in proliferation and nearly a 50% increase
in apoptosis.
Effects of ginseng on EGFR signals and regulators of
apoptosis

To begin to dissect molecular signals potentially contributing to ginseng-induced changes in proliferation and
cell death, we examined EGFR signals and apoptosis
regulators. As shown in Figure 3, colonic tumors
induced by AOM/DSS in mice on Western diet showed
up-regulations of phospho-active-EGFR (pEGFR),
pErbB2, pERK, and pAKT (Figure 3). Dietary ginseng
significantly reduced these activations in tumors.

Figure 3 Ginseng inhibits EGFR signals and Cox-2 upregulation and increases pro-apoptotic Bax in AOM/DSS
tumors. Control mucosa (-G, Western diet alone, +G, Western diet +
ginseng) and colonic tumors were homogenized in Laemmli buffer
and indicated proteins detected by Western blotting. Shown are
representative control samples and tumors from each group.
Quantitative densitometry is provided in Table 2.

Ginseng also increased cell cycle and apoptosis regulating p21Waf1 in tumors that is predicted to inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis [45,46]. With respect to
other apoptotic regulators, ginseng decreased anti-apoptotic Cox-2 and increased pro-apoptotic Bax, consistent
with ginseng-induced increased apoptosis. Quantitative
densitometry values are summarized in Table 2.
Absorption and biological effects of ginseng metabolite
compound K

Several metabolites of ginseng require colonic microbiota for biosynthesis [47]. In recent preliminary studies
we found that whereas the ginsenoside Rb1 had limited

anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity, 20-O-b-(Dglucopyranosyl)-20(S)-protopanaxadiol or compound K,
a microbial metabolite of Rb1 potently suppressed colon
cancer cell proliferation in vitro (C. Wang et al., manuscript submitted). To directly assess the anti-tumor
effects of compound K we examined the ability of this
bacterial metabolite of ginseng to inhibit tumor xenograft growth. The structure of compound K is shown in
Additional File 1. As shown in Figure 4A, compound K
potently suppressed growth of HCT116 cells in immunodeficient nude (nu/nu) mice when administered by
intraperitoneal route.
To address a colonic bacterial requirement for compound K synthesis we pretreated mice with metronidazole a broad-spectrum antibiotic or vehicle (control).
Following 5 days treatment we measured ginsenoside
Rb1 and compound K in the sera by mass spectrometry.
As shown in Figure 4B, Rb1 absorption was not influenced by antibiotic treatment. In contrast, compound K
was undetectable in antibiotic-treated mice, but readily
detected in mouse sera from vehicle-treated mice (Figure 4C). These results are consistent with a requirement
for metronidazole-sensitive colonic bacteria for compound K synthesis.
Ginseng alters colonic microbiome diversity

While bacteria are required for metabolism of some ginsenosides, it is also possible that ginseng might alter the
microbial flora since it is a substrate for some bacteria.
To assess the effects that ginseng might have on the
microflora, we compared colonic bacterial populations
in mice on 2 wks of Western diet alone vs. those on
Western diet plus 250 ppm ginseng extract. As shown
in Figure 4D, ginseng reduced the number of Tenericutes, while increasing the Bacteroidetes population.
Principal coordinate analysis suggested that the microbial populations in mice receiving ginseng were markedly distinct from those on Western diet alone (Figure
4E). These changes support our hypothesis that ginseng
consumption might alter the colonic microbiome.
Whether these changes influence microbial metabolic
activity towards ginseng, including compound K biosynthesis, will require further study.

Discussion
We have shown for the first time that an extract of ginseng can inhibit colonic tumor development under conditions of a Western diet in a model of inflammationassociated colon cancer. These studies extend recent
findings that ginseng can inhibit colonic tumorigenesis
under standard dietary fat conditions [19]. We also
observed that ginseng delayed the onset and appeared to
lessen the severity of inflammation in this model in
agreement with a prior study [48]. Since inflammation

Figure 4 Dietary ginseng alters the composition of the bacterial flora while intraperitoneal compound K inhibits colon cancer
xenograft growth. A. Compound K inhibits colon cancer growth in tumor xenograft. HCT116 cells (5*10^6 cells) were implanted into flanks of
nu/nu mice and allowed to grow for 5 days. Mice were then treated with compound K (30 mg/kg-body wt or DMSO (compound K vehicle). At
indicated times tumor size was estimated by linear dimensions [volume = 1/2 × length × (width)2] and expressed in mg (*p < 0.05 compared to
control, n = 5 mice in each group). B. Rb1 absorption. Mice were un-treated or treated with metronidazole in the drinking water. After 5 days
animals were gavaged with 500 mg ginseng extract/kg body wt. At indicated times after ginseng gavage, plasma levels of ginsenoside Rb1
were measured by UPLC-mass-spectrometry/TOF. C. Compound K absorption. Mice were treated as described in 4B and Compound K (C-K)
measured by UPLC-mass-spectrometry/TOF. Data were expressed as means ± SEM depicted by vertical bars (p < 0.05 compared to mice not
receiving antibiotics). Note that metronidazole suppressed serum compound K but not Rb1 levels. D. Effects of ginseng on bacterial phyla. Mice
were fed Western diet or Western diet containing 250-ppm ginseng. After 2 wks feces were collected and bacterial DNA extracted. Using 16S
rRNA gene libraries, bacteria were classified by phyla as described in “Materials and Methods”. E. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) of bacterial

plays a key role in this model, the anti-cancer effects of
ginseng likely derive in part from its ability to suppress
inflammation, as also suggested by ginseng suppression
of Cox-2 a molecular marker of inflammation [49]. Cox2 inhibition has been shown to directly suppress tumorigenesis in this model [50]. Ginseng appeared to inhibit
tumor initiation, as tumor multiplicity and the number
of adenomas were significantly reduced in the ginseng
treated group. There was also a trend towards fewer
cancers in the ginseng group, suggesting that this agent

might inhibit tumor progression, but this did not reach
statistical significance. In a study under standard dietary
fat conditions ginseng inhibited tumor progression [19].
Ginseng supplementation reduced proliferation and
increased apoptosis in tumors. Compared to tumors
from the unsupplemented group, decreased PCNA
expression in the ginseng group was consistent with
reduced proliferation. Prior studies by our group and
others have shown that ginseng or its metabolites
induce anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in

Dougherty et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2011, 11:111
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/11/111

human cancer cells [12,15,31,51,52]. More recently, we
demonstrated that compound K, a microbial metabolite
of ginsenoside Rb1, induced G1 cell cycle slowing and
accelerated apoptosis of colon cancer cells (C. Wang et
al., manuscript submitted). Compound K has also been
shown to inhibit growth and increase apoptosis in a
model of liver cancer metastasis [27].
To begin to elucidate cellular signaling pathways that
mediate these anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects
we examined expression levels of several proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. We found in tumors from
the unsupplemented group that EGFR signals, including
pEGFR, pErbB2, pERK and pAKT were significantly
increased. Ginseng significantly reduced increases in
EGF receptor activation and inhibited these downstream effectors that are known to drive mitogenic and
pro-survival signals in colon cancer [53,54]. Ginseng
also increased p21Waf1, a cyclin-cdk inhibitor predicted
to retard G1 - > S cell cycle progression. While we did
not measure changes in p53, a major regulator of
p21Waf1, this cyclin-cdk-dependent inhibitor can also
regulate p53-independent pathways [46].
Among the regulators of apoptosis, we demonstrated
that ginseng significantly reduced Cox-2 and increased
pro-apoptotic Bax in tumors. Cox-2 is an EGFR effector
in this model that suppresses apoptosis in colon cancer
cells [4,55]. This pro-inflammatory molecule plays a critical role in both sporadic and inflammation-associated
colonic tumorigenesis [56,57]. With respect to Bax,
down-regulation of this protein has been suggested to
predict colon cancer prognosis in early stage disease
[58]. Changes in these regulators were consistent with
increased apoptosis in tumors from ginseng-supplemented mice. Since we showed that EGFR signals were
required for Western diet to promote colonic tumorigenesis [4,5], we speculate that inhibition of this cascade
plays a critical role in the chemopreventive effects of
ginseng by limiting proliferation and increasing apoptosis in this model. As this commonly used and safe natural herb appears to inhibit diet-promoted colon cancer,
ginseng might offer a novel chemopreventive strategy
for colon cancer, particularly in Asia where there is
widespread use of ginseng and increasing adoption of
Westernized diets.
In recent preliminary in vitro studies we showed that
the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of the
ginsenoside Rb1 were likely mediated by compound K, a
major microbial metabolite of Rb1. In agreement with
these findings, others have shown that compound K
induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells in vitro and
inhibited hepatocellular tumor xenograft growth in vivo
[27,28]. Compound K is derived from Panax ginsenoside
Rb1 by the microbial enzyme geniposide-hydrolysing
beta-D-glucosidase [47]. Antibiotic treatment suppressed

the appearance of compound K in the serum. Rb1 and
compound K appear to block IRAK-1 and NFB activation and thereby reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1b, TNF-a and IL-6 and cytokine effectors iNOS and
Cox-2 in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)treated mice, another model of colitis [59]. To directly
assess the anti-tumor effects of compound K in a colon
cancer model we examined the effect of this compound
on HCT116 tumor xenograft growth. Compound K significantly inhibited colon cancer growth. We speculate,
therefore, that this microbial metabolite contributes to
the chemopreventive efficacy of ginseng in the AOM/
DSS model. We plan to directly test this assertion in
future studies using germ-free animals.
It will also be of interest to determine how hostgenetic and environmental factors interact with the
colonic microbiome. In contrast to a bacterial requirement for compound K generation, bacteria do not
appear to be necessary to activate AOM as colonocytes
from germ free rats generated AOM from precursor
DMH at least as fast as colonocytes from conventionally colonized rats [60]. Furthermore, AOM can induce
tumors in germ free rodents [61]. In addition to an
effect of the microbes on ginseng metabolism, ginseng
in the diet might reshape the microbiome by serving
as a metabolic substrate or an environmental modifier
to enrich microbial species capable of using or
responding to this agent. This could lead to increases
in the capacity to metabolize ginseng to bioactive
molecules such as compound K. Thus, sustained use of
ginseng by individuals might promote clinical efficacy
by increasing metabolic conversion of relatively inert
ginseng to bioactive components. Such investigations
might suggest more effective dietary and probiotic
approaches to enhance ginseng-based colon cancer
chemoprevention.

Conclusions
Ginseng inhibits AOM/DSS induced colonic tumorigenesis promoted by a Western diet. Inhibition of EGFR
signals and alterations in G1 cell cycle and apoptosis
regulators appear to contribute to these chemopreventive effects. Studies in tumor xenografts suggest that
compound K, a microbial metabolite of ginseng, may
mediate some of these effects of ginseng. Further study
of this promising natural agent for chemoprevention of
colon cancer is warranted.
