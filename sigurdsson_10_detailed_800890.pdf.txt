metabolism based on human Recon 1

Abstract
Background: Well-curated and validated network reconstructions are extremely valuable tools in systems biology.
Detailed metabolic reconstructions of mammals have recently emerged, including human reconstructions. They
raise the question if the various successful applications of microbial reconstructions can be replicated in complex
organisms.
Results: We mapped the published, detailed reconstruction of human metabolism (Recon 1) to other mammals. By
searching for genes homologous to Recon 1 genes within mammalian genomes, we were able to create draft
metabolic reconstructions of five mammals, including the mouse. Each draft reconstruction was created in
compartmentalized and non-compartmentalized version via two different approaches. Using gap-filling algorithms,
we were able to produce all cellular components with three out of four versions of the mouse metabolic
reconstruction. We finalized a functional model by iterative testing until it passed a predefined set of 260 validation
tests. The reconstruction is the largest, most comprehensive mouse reconstruction to-date, accounting for 1,415
genes coding for 2,212 gene-associated reactions and 1,514 non-gene-associated reactions.
We tested the mouse model for phenotype prediction capabilities. The majority of predicted essential genes were
also essential in vivo. However, our non-tissue specific model was unable to predict gene essentiality for many of
the metabolic genes shown to be essential in vivo. Our knockout simulation of the lipoprotein lipase gene correlated well with experimental results, suggesting that softer phenotypes can also be simulated.
Conclusions: We have created a high-quality mouse genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, iMM1415 (Mus
Musculus, 1415 genes). We demonstrate that the mouse model can be used to perform phenotype simulations,
similar to models of microbe metabolism. Since the mouse is an important experimental organism, this model
should become an essential tool for studying metabolic phenotypes in mice, including outcomes from drug
screening.

Background
The first genome-scale reconstruction of metabolic networks emerged eleven years ago [1], four years after the
first whole genome sequencing of an entire organism
was published [2]. To date, 29 bacteria, 2 archaea and 5
eukaryotes have been reconstructed and for some organisms, up to 5 updates have been published [3]. The
reconstruction process is well established for metabolic
networks [4]. Once assembled, the reconstruction can
be readily converted into a mathematical format by adding balances (e.g., mass -balance constraints), steadystate assumptions and bounds (e.g. physical constraints)

[5]. The resulting model is condition-specific and can be
used for phenotype simulations using various constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA)
methods [5,6]. This approach has proven successful for
various microorganisms and eukaryotes for addressing
various biological and biotechnological questions, such
as the analysis of knowledge gaps [7], simulation of phenotype traits [8], analysis of evolution of metabolic networks [9,10] and metabolic engineering applications
[11]. The numerous applications have recently been
reviewed [3,12].
The release of the human genome [13] and its annotation has provided the appropriate foundation for human
metabolic reconstructions. Three approaches have been
published to date. Two of those, the HumanCyc [14]

and the Edinburgh Human Metabolic Network [15,16]
were created with a largely automated top-down
approach, while Recon 1 [17] was created by an extensive bottom-up manual curation of an automated draft
map, including extensive gap-assessment and filling
using bibliomic data. Recon 1 has eight compartments
(cytoplasm, extracellular space, mitochondria, Golgi
apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, peroxisome
and nucleus) and accounts for 1496 genes coding for
2004 proteins [17]. Overall, Recon 1 covers all major
metabolic pathways occurring in any human cell by
accounting for 2,233 biochemical transformations and
1,510 transport and exchange reactions. The Recon 1
can be converted into a functional in silico model can
be converted into a functional model of human metabolism, which was validated by applying 288 flux balance
analysis (FBA) based tests of core functionality of
human metabolism [17]. A recent use of Recon 1
includes a study on the topology of human disease finding that several co-morbid diseases had a functional
relationship within Recon 1 [18]. Also, expression profiling data mapped onto Recon 1 was used to create a cellular network for ten human tissue types [19].
Furthermore a systems based analysis of the effects of
imprinted genes on metabolic functions has recently
been published [20].
Metabolic networks have been reconstructed for two
further mammals, a central metabolic reconstruction of
cattle (Bos taurus) [21] and four mouse (Mus musculus)
reconstructions [22-25].Two of these mouse reconstructions were constructed manually [24,25], while the
remaining two were generated semi-automatically
[22,23]. The first genome-scale manual curated reconstruction represents the metabolism of mouse hybridoma cell lines [25] and has recently been expanded to
represent 1494 reactions coded by 724 genes in three
compartments [24]. In addition, a pre-genome sequencing reaction network of intermediate metabolism in
mouse hybridoma cell lines was built and analyzed
using linear optimization [26].
The mouse serves as a fundamental experimental animal for human biomedical applications. Furthermore,
the availability of phenotyped inbred knockout mouse
strains [27] make it ideal for examining the phenotype
prediction capabilities of mammalian reconstructions.
Therefore, a detailed reconstruction of mouse metabolism that can be converted into highly functional model
is of a great importance.
Given the high sequence homology between most
mammalian genomes, an obvious starting point for
metabolic reconstruction of mammals is the comprehensive human metabolic reconstruction, Recon 1. We
therefore sought to create draft mammalian metabolic
reconstructions based on Recon 1. The mouse

reconstruction was then manually completed and validated. We also present simulation results using a functional model of mouse metabolism to test its phenotype
prediction capabilities.

Results
Identification of homologous genes

The HomoloGene database contains information on
homologous genes in 5 mammals and 15 non-mammals
[28]. We searched the HomoloGene database for all
1496 genes of Recon 1 and found a human match for
1,464 genes (97.8%). The mammalian organism with the
highest number of genes homologous to Recon 1 genes
was the mouse (Mus musculus) (1,415 genes, 97%). The
non-mammalian organism with the highest number of
genes homologous to Recon 1 genes was the zebra-fish
(Danio rerio) (1,200 genes, 82%) (Additional file 1).
Creation of draft metabolic network reconstructions

For each mammal, a draft reconstruction was created
via two different approaches (Figure 1a). In approach A
(modelA), all reactions linked to Recon 1 genes that did
not have a homologous gene were removed from the
reconstruction of the corresponding species. Therefore,
modelA included all reactions linked to genes homologous to Recon 1 genes in addition to all non-gene associated reactions (1,514). Of the non-gene-associated
reactions, 676 were transporter reactions, 452 were
demand or exchange reactions, leaving 385 reactions
within a metabolic pathway but without gene-association. In approach B (modelB), we included only genes
and their reactions homologues to Recon 1 genes as
well as transporter and demand reactions. All other
reactions, including non-gene associated reactions, were
removed from the reconstruction.
The ratio of Recon 1 genes with a homologous gene
as well as the ratio of reactions from Recon 1 included
in the draft reconstructions for each mammal is shown
in Figure 1b. The mammal with the highest ratio of
mapped genes (97%) and reactions (98%) was the mouse
while the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) had the lowest
ratio of both mapped genes (84%) and reactions (91%).
Furthermore, we created for each mammalian
modelA and modelB a compartmentalized and noncompartmentalized version. The more complex, compartmentalized versions had more metabolic dead ends
(321 vs. 150) and therefore more reactions with zero
fluxes. The number of reactions with non-zero fluxes
for both compartmentalized and non-compartmentalized
versions of all draft mammalian models created using
approach A and B are summarized in Table 1. We performed flux variability analysis (FVA) of models of these
reconstructions, allowing uptake of all extracellular
metabolites in all models in order to maximize

reactions existed only in humans and 1 (1%) reactions
existed only in the mouse (Additional file 2). For the 25
remaining Recon 1 subsystems (excluding transporters),
we did an extensive literature search for differences
between the two species. Of those, only cytochrome P
450 metabolism was reported to differ significantly
between mouse and human [32]. These defined differences will guide the subsequent gap filling process.
However, since most of the metabolic functions seemed
to be present in both human and mouse, we can employ
the validation tests which were designed to evaluate the
predictive potential of Recon 1 [17].

likelihood of non-zero fluxes. Compared to humans, the
mouse model had the highest percentage (84-89%) and
the chimpanzee model had the lowest percentage (4154%) of active reactions with non-zero fluxes for all
model versions (Table 1). We then constructed a phylogenetic tree of the reconstructed mammals based on the
FVA results (Figure 1d,e). The results indicated that the
mouse draft model had the highest degree of similarity
with the human model for both modelA (Figure 1d) and
modelB (Figure 1e). These findings are surprising as the
chimpanzee is the closest relative of humans with
approximately 99% overall genome similarity [29]. It is
also the closest ancestor to humans of the mammals
reconstructed when protein coding sequence is compared (Figure 1c).
Identification of unique metabolic functions in the mouse

Given the high number of reactions mapped to the draft
mouse reconstruction, and the high number of reactions
with non-zero fluxes resulting in the corresponding
metabolic modelA and modelB, we sought to finalize
the mouse reconstruction by gap analysis/filling. First,
we aimed to understand the metabolic differences
between human and mouse to ensure that the mouse
reconstruction is not merely a modified version of
human metabolism. This implies that also genes and
pathways unique to mouse metabolism needed to be
identified. Therefore, we employed the Comparative
Pathway Analyzer 1.0 [30] relying on the KEGG database [31] to extract metabolic maps displaying the existence of enzymes in both mouse and human for 66 out
of 99 Recon 1 subsystems (Additional file 2). We then
used these maps to perform a manual search of potential gaps between human and mouse metabolism. Out of
1550 reactions present within these subsystems, 1492
(96%) reactions existed in both species, 46 (3%)

First, we decided to test which of the four mouse metabolic models were able to produce biomass by optimizing for the corresponding reaction accounting for all
known biomass precursors required for cell replication.
The compartmentalized and non-compartmentalized
draft mouse models from approach A produced biomass
without any modifications. In contrast, both versions of
modelB were unable to produce biomass. Therefore, we
sought to gap fill the draft non-compartmentalized
modelB to identify reactions that needed to be added to
the model for production of all biomass components.
The SMILEY gap filling algorithm identifies reactions
from a database that need to be added to a model to
fulfill the optimality condition (e.g. production of biomass) [7]. Using the SMILEY algorithm, we searched for
the minimal number of reactions within the entire
KEGG database necessary to add to the non-compartmentalized mouse modelB in order to enable the production of biomass.
The results from 40 iterations of the algorithm were
checked manually for two criteria: i) the result did not
suggest a reversible reaction for a known irreversible
reaction and ii) the added reaction(s) are known to
occur in mouse. Of the 40 iterations, 30 suggested adding the same reaction either alone or in addition to
some other metabolic reactions. This reaction (KEGG
ID R06522) exists in mouse and humans (according to
KEGG and Entrez gene [33]) but was not included in
Recon1. It is a phosphohydrolase reaction involved in
sphingolipid metabolism. Adding this reaction resulted
in the ability of the refined non-compartmentalized
modelB model to produce biomass at a similar rate as
the non-compartmentalized modelA. The addition did,
however, not result in biomass production in the compartmentalized modelB. Subsequently, we decided to
focus the remainder of the study on modelA, as it captures most of the known metabolic capabilities in the
mouse. ModelB was not further developed since it is
missing a significant fraction of metabolic reactions and
therefore does not function.

Validation of the mouse metabolic reconstruction

To validate the mouse reconstruction and to ensure
mouse-characteristic metabolic properties of the resulting models, we manually tested each of the 288 FBA
validation tests that were developed for Recon 1 [17]
using both versions of modelA. Our literature survey on
mouse metabolism, also focusing on the mouse essentiality of the 288 human tests, revealed no tests that were
essential only in the human metabolism. Furthermore
we found no evidence of mouse-specific additional tests
of essentiality that could be added to our validation process. Therefore, we evaluated manually if all required
reactions for each test are present in the mouse metabolism using Comparative Pathway Analyzer 1.0. A total of
260 tests passed the requirements and were therefore
used for validation of the compartmentalized mouse
modelA (Additional file 3). For the non-compartmentalized version of modelA, six additional tests were
removed since they were compartment specific, resulting
in 254 validation tests.
We ran the validation tests on the compartmentalized
mouse draft modelA in an iterative manner and evaluated particularly the failed tests. This process revealed
that out of the 131 reactions initially removed due to
missing homologous genes in the HomoloGene database, 36 had sequence and physiological evidence of
existence in the mouse (according to KEGG and EntrezGene databases) (Additional file 4). Those 36 reactions
were therefore added again to the model, but the
remaining 95 reactions were left out of the final model
due to missing physiologic or sequence evidence. This
addition resulted in a finalized mouse modelA that
passed all the 260 validation tests. Also, we added the
reaction discovered by the gap filling of modelB (KEGG
ID R06522). Furthermore, unique mouse reactions
which do not lead to metabolic dead ends in the model
were added (KEGG IDs R03184, R00647 and R01465).
The non-compartmentalized modelA similarly passed
100% of its 254 validation tests after the addition of
these reactions. We also determined the functionality of
modelB, even though the compartmentalized version
cannot produce biomass. The compartmentalized and
non-compartmentalized models created via approach B
passed 50% and 85% of the validation tests respectively.
Properties of iMM1415

The resulting compartmentalized mouse metabolic
reconstruction (Additional file 5), created by curation of
modelA, termed iMM1415, contains a total of 3,724 reactions and 1,415 metabolic genes (Additional file 6 contains detailed description of all reactions in iMM1415,
including the biomass reaction). Analysis of the reactions
removed from Recon 1 during the creation of iMM1415
revealed that the greatest absolute number of non-

Page 5 of 13

included reactions in the mouse reconstruction were
within steroid metabolism (16 out of 46 reactions) and
blood group biosynthesis (14 out of 46 reactions). However, the largest percentage of non-included reactions
was within the subsystems of stilbene, coumarine and lignin biosynthesis (50%, 1 out of 2 reactions) and limonene
and pinene degradation (50%, 3 out of 6 reactions). This
data suggests that simulation results from these metabolism subsystems will be more likely to be inaccurate and
points out areas for future improvement of the mouse
model. In the remainder of the paper, we will use models
derived from iMM1415 for computations.
Comparison of iMM1415 with published mouse metabolic
networks

Table 2 provides a comparison between our reconstruction and other published reconstructions, the most
detailed to date being the recently published mouse
metabolic network by Selvarasu et al [24]. Our model
functions in eight cellular compartments compared to
three compartments in most reconstructions. It has the
most detailed description of mitochondria metabolism
to date but fewer reactions in the cytosol. Furthermore
iMM1415 contains the first attempt to describe metabolism in the golgi apparatus, lysosome, ribosome, peroxisome and nucleus. Due to the compartmentalization, a
much greater number of transport reactions was
required in our reconstruction compared to the previous
ones. As less biochemical data exists on transport reactions a larger number of non-gene associated reactions
are needed in our model than in the other models.
Albeit difficult to compare directly due to different definition of minimum growth medium and biomass, our
model predicts fewer essential genes but a higher percentage of them have been experimentally verified than
in the other models published to date (Table 2).
Essentiality of mouse metabolic genes

Given the high degree of functionality of iMM1415 we
decided to employ it for phenotype simulations and to
compare the in silico results to published experimental
results from knockout mice or mice with mutations in
metabolic genes. First, we performed a simulation of single
gene knockouts for all genes in iMM1415 in order to
determine in silico gene essentiality. A minimal growth
medium supplemented with glucose was used for this
simulation (as defined in additional file 7). A total of 53
genes were found to be essential as their deletion resulted
in zero biomass production (Additional file 8). We found
information on homozygous knockout phenotype for 17
of those genes in literature (Table 3). Of those, 14 (82%)
genes had a confirmed lethal phenotype, whereas the
remaining three (18%) had non-lethal phenotypes (Table
3). The majority of the genes with a predicted and

confirmed essentiality status were within the cholesterol
metabolism. This result indicates that cholesterol metabolism is especially vulnerable to mutations and environmental insults, perhaps due to the inability of the cholesterol
metabolism to overcome disruption in metabolic reactions
via alternative pathways.
Second, we searched the Mouse Genome Informatics
database [27] for mouse reconstruction genes where a
phenotype had been described with the word “lethality”.
Furthermore, we required that these genes were homozygous for a gene knockout and had either an embryonic or
prenatal lethal phenotype. A total of 88 genes were identified this way. Five genes overlapped with the in silico
essential genes (FDFT1, SPTLC1, PHGDH, HMGCR,
CBS, SPTLC2). The observed discrepancy in lethality can
be explained by either, i) growth environment simulations, ii) incomplete biomass reaction, iii) missing regulation, iv) wrongly included reactions, or v) any
combination of the aforementioned possibilities. Wrongly
included reactions could be identified by systematically
eliminating non-gene-associated reactions from
iMM1415 (e.g., using GrowMatch algorithm [34]) to
improve the prediction of lethality. In contrast, the two
genes that were essential in silico but in vivo non-essential for growth suggest missing functions in the metabolic
network. Using SMILEY, or related algorithms, it might
be possible to identify missing candidate genes.

Prediction of normal phenotypes

To further evaluate the predictive potential of iMM1415,
we identified genes from the Mouse Genome Informatics database [27], for which a null mutation resulted
in a normal phenotype. A total of eight such genes were
found that were also present in the mouse reconstruction (OCRL, ACO1, PAFAH1B3, PGM1, FUT9, RHBG,
ITPKC, SORD). For five of those, a gene deletion had no
effect in the model, since isozymes existed within the
reconstruction. For the three remaining genes (PGM1,
FUT9, SORD), the deletion led to elimination of corresponding reactions. The effect of these deletions on
growth depends on i) the presence of alternative reactions/pathways or ii) importance of reactions for biomass precursor synthesis. We investigated the effect of
these three gene deletions on the overall network by
performing a FVA. We then compared the FVA results
of essential gene knockout (DHCR7) to the FVA results
of wild type (Table 4) by considering only major sections of metabolism (Table 4). The largest perturbation
resulted from the knockout simulation of the essential
gene DHCR7, where seven major subsections of metabolism changed significantly. The knockout simulation of
PGM1 led to significant changes within six major subsections of metabolism. The knockout simulation of the
FUT9 gene led to significant changes within two major
subsections of metabolism and the knockout simulation

Analysis of lipoprotein lipase deficiency on in silico

Finally, we sought to simulate knockouts of genes with
softer phenotypes. The LPL gene encodes lipoprotein
lipase (EC 3.1.1.34) [35], an enzyme that hydrolyzes chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)

lipase deficiency have elevated levels of triglycerides and
VLDL and suffer from recurrent episodes of abdominal
pain and pancreatitis as well as eruptive xanthomas of
the skin [35]. Mutations have been associated with
increased risk of ischemic heart disease in man [36].
Mice without lipoprotein lipase are born with greatly
elevated levels of triglycerides and VLDL, and after nursing, triglyceride levels soon become extremely high.
Heterozygotes for the null mutation of LPL survive until
adulthood but with elevated triglyceride levels [37].
We simulated the knockout of the LPL gene and performed FVA to determine the effect of the gene deletion

Transporters

For each reaction within the model, FVA determines the minimum and maximum flux resulting in the optimal solution for the objective function (here: biomass
production). Only those solutions that resulted in the same maximum biomass yield as the wild type model were used for the analysis. By comparing the flux
range (the span between vmax,i and vmin,i for each reaction i) between the knockout model and a wild type model, each reaction was assigned a status of
decreased (down), non-changing or increased (up) flux capacity (representing metabolic activity). For each metabolism subsystem, the number of reactions with
decreased and increased flux capacity are shown. Significance testing was done by performing a single value Chi-Square test with 1 degree of freedom
comparing against even probability of increased and decreased flux capacity. Significant p-values (p < 0.05/10) are typeset in bold.

to the network properties. The largest perturbation was
observed within i) the glycan metabolism, where 31
reactions had decreased and 312 reactions increased flux
capacity (p < 10-16 against even probability of decreased
and increased flux capacity); and ii) lipid metabolism,
where 100 reactions with decreased and 253 reactions
with increased flux capacity (p < 10 -15 against even
probability of decreased and increased flux capacity).
Additionally, the flux capacity changed significantly
within the triacylglycerol metabolism (Figure 2). The
results suggest that there is increased flux capacity
towards triglyceride synthesis while there is decreased
flux capacity towards triglyceride degradation. The
simulation results are therefore consistent with hypertriglyceridemia resulting from LPL mutations, as previously demonstrated with the mouse knockout model
[37-51].

Discussion
Can the success of metabolic systems biology in
microbes be repeated for more complex organisms? A
prerequisite for such success is the existence of high
quality metabolic network reconstructions. Here, we
examined if the detailed and validated network reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon 1, could be used
as a basis for reconstructing metabolic networks in
other mammals. We then focused on mouse to create a
manual curated, comprehensive reconstruction of mouse
metabolism that was subsequently employed to determine normal and lethal growth phenotypes. Overall, we
found good agreement between the model’s prediction
and reported mouse phenotypes, suggesting that the
mouse reconstruction has similar quality properties as
Recon 1.

Initial analysis of sequenced mammalian genomes
revealed that the highest number of genes orthologous
to Recon 1 genes was found in the mouse while the
lowest number was present in the chimpanzee (Table 1).
This result was surprising since the sequence homology
between human and chimpanzee is ~99% [29] while the
sequence homology between human and mouse is in
the range of 85-92% [52,53]. This observation reflects
the fact that many enzymes involved in human metabolism were discovered by analyzing their mouse orthologues, leading to a high likelihood that mouse metabolic
enzymes are known in human and thus present in
Recon 1.
The initial search for homologous genes indicated that
a functional mouse reconstruction could be produced
based on Recon 1. Using two different approaches, we
created four versions of a draft mouse model (Figure 1).
These draft models were then completed by automated
and manual gap filling analysis and validated against 260
FBA-based tests. This effort resulted in iMM1415,
which accounts for more genes and reactions, distributed over eight cellular compartments, than previously
published reconstructions (Table 2) in addition to its
representation of eight cellular compartments. Thus, the
mouse metabolic reconstruction presented herein is the
most comprehensive reconstruction available to date.
However, its usage of the human Recon 1 for reactions
information (including cellular location and reversibility)
risks that the reactions included are skewed towards
human metabolism and that reactions unique to the
mouse might be missed.
A surprisingly high number of non-gene-associated
reactions are included in Recon 1. Many of those are
intra-cellular transport reactions, demand or exchange

reactions with sparse literature supporting their existence. They were included to provide a functional
model of human metabolism across the eight cellular
compartments and were therefore also added to
iMM1415. We feel that the gain for a highly functional
model by their full inclusion supersedes the risk of artificially inflating the properties of the mouse reconstruction. Furthermore, 30-40% of all known enzymes
with an EC number are orphan meaning that their

biochemical activity is well characterized while the
encoding gene is unknown in any organism [54]. Many
of these enzymes (13-37%) are within major metabolism
pathways [55] suggesting that metabolic reconstructions
of even well-annotated organisms will have a set of nongene associated reactions in order to ensure their correct functionality. This observation also argues against
reconstructing or analyzing metabolic networks based
solely on genomic data as they are likely to have

Sigurdsson et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:140
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/140

numerous missing metabolic functions. Also, the nongene associated reactions are an extremely interesting
area of future research as they suggest pathways and
enzymes that require further experimental exploration
[55]. Furthermore, several reactions leading to metabolic
dead ends in the model were included in Recon 1 and
subsequently in our mouse reconstruction. They highlight missing links in knowledge and form testable
hypotheses that should be further investigated. Any
effort of a consensus metabolic reconstruction of the
mouse should focus on reviewing the non-gene-associated reactions and those leading to dead-ends in the
model in detail.
Our approach could in theory also be used to construct high quality metabolic reconstructions for other
mammals. Given our results (Table 1), it is likely that a
rat reconstruction could be obtained using a similar
approach as presented here (Figure 1). However, the
resulting network is expected to be less complete, limiting its application and requiring more manual curation.
Metabolic reconstructions of other mammals will be of
insufficient quality and predictive potential using the
presented approach due to the low number of homologous genes with Recon1 genes.
The phenotype prediction properties of metabolic models have been extensively applied for microorganisms,
however, only limited studies exists for mammals
[20,56,57]. The mouse is an ideal model organism for testing and validating phenotypic properties since multiple
inbred strains, several thousand gene knockout strains and
various cell lines exist [27] including knockouts of many
metabolic genes. We found that the majority of predicted
essential genes also had a lethal phenotype in vivo. Interestingly, the majority of the in silico essential genes were
found to be within cholesterol metabolism, indicating both
the importance and mutation vulnerability of this metabolism pathway. This observation is in concordance with
results based on an earlier mouse metabolic model, where
the majority of essential genes were from cholesterol
metabolism [24]. These results should guide further
research and might be helpful in understanding human
disease based on lipid abnormalities, such as atherosclerosis [24]. However, many more genes were identified in
mouse knockout databases [27] which result in a lethal
phenotype in vivo but had a non-lethal phenotype in silico.
The disagreement could result from the non-tissue specificity of iMM1415 or incomplete biomass reaction and
highlights starting points for future research to further our
insight into mouse metabolism.
The majority of genes for which an in vivo experimental knockout strain has been developed have a nonlethal phenotype. Similarly, in silico knockout

Page 10 of 13

simulations resulted in little or no perturbation of the
mouse metabolic network. Recently, it was shown for
yeast that even though deletion of ~80% of yeast genes
resulted in no apparent phenotype when grown in rich
medium, a measurable growth phenotype was observed
for ~97% of yeast genes when the medium was either
depleted of certain ingredients or biologically active
compounds added to the medium [58]. Furthermore,
virtually all genes were essential under some growth
conditions [58]. It is an important subject of future
research to see if the mammalian models suggest similar
findings, as such analysis might further understanding of
both complex genotypes and the effects of environmental factors on disease pathogenesis.

Conclusions
Here, we have created a reconstruction of mouse
metabolism based on sequence homology, using the
highly detailed Recon 1 of human metabolism as a
basis for our reconstruction. The model has been rigorously validated using 260 flux balance analysis based
tests. The resulting reconstruction, iMM1415, is to
date the most comprehensive reconstruction of mouse
metabolism. Our phenotype simulation results suggest
that the current quality of both the human Recon 1
and the derived iMM1415 models are sufficient for
phenotype predictions. The existence of these two
reconstructions should encourage the creation of
detailed metabolic network reconstructions for other
mammals. With the ongoing international knockout
mouse project http://www.knockoutmouse.org aiming
to produce knockout of all protein coding genes within
the mouse genome and the Collaborative Cross project
aiming to crossbreed eight inbred strains of mice [59],
the validation of mammalian metabolic models should
become extensive. Also, the sequencing of more inbred
strains of experimental mice will provide new opportunities in studying the effects of genetic variability on
metabolism, utilizing the mouse reconstruction as a
data analysis platform. The existent and emerging
reconstructions should be joined in a collaborative
effort to reach a consensus reconstruction of the
mouse metabolism to maximize its accuracy and utilization properties. Reconstruction jamboree meetings
have been held for various organisms to obtain consensus metabolic reconstructions and to increase their
content in a community driven approach [4,60]. Thoroughly validated genome-scale reconstructions should
provide a broad platform for studying mammalian
metabolism and can form the basis for developing
therapeutic interventions related to pathological metabolic states [38,42-44,48,51,61].

Methods
All model calculations were done in MATLAB version
2009a (The Mathworks Inc.) using the COBRA toolbox
[6] and the Mosek linear solver (Mosek ApS, Denmark).
Statistical tests and figure preparation were done in R,
version 2.9.1 (The R foundation, Austria). In-house
scripts for data processing were written in Java and are
available upon request from the authors.

two databases were used to determine candidate reactions to fill gaps in the non-compartmentalized draft
model. The gap filling algorithm was set to run 40
iterations. Each solution was then manually checked
for applicability (such as the feasibility of the suggested directionality) before choosing a proposed
solution.
Validation

Flux balance analysis and flux variability analysis

Given a reconstructed metabolic network on a mathematical form with appropriate constraints on each reaction (representing reversibility, maximum and minimum
flux etc.) and a biological objective Z (such as biomass),
flux balance analysis (FBA) calculates a set of network
fluxes that maximize Z. It has several derived applications used to further analyze the flow of metabolites
through a metabolic model [62]. One such application is
flux variability analysis (FVA) [63]. FVA uses linear programming methods to find the minimal and maximal
flux values that can be achieved by each reaction while
contributing to maximal production of the objective
reaction.

For validation of the mouse reconstruction, we used a
modification of the validation process used in the creation of the human Recon 1 network. Each of the 288
validation tests used for Recon 1 was manually checked
for applicability in the mouse. This was done by manually reviewing each validation test using Comparative
Pathway Analyzer 1.0 [30]. If all enzymes participating
in validation test of choice existed both in human and
mouse, the test was used in the mouse validation. This
resulted in 260 validation tests for the mouse model.
The model was then improved manually in an iterative
manner by checking the reactions involved in failed
tests until it passed all validation tests.
Simulations

Creation of draft reconstructions

The entire HomoloGene build 52 was downloaded on
11/17/2008 [28]. We extracted data from the dataset for
all 1,496 genes in Recon 1 [17]. For each of the 20 species in the HomoloGene database, we then checked for
the availability of a homologous gene for each Recon 1
gene. Next we created draft reconstructions for each
species using two different approaches as described in
the result section. The draft reconstructions were converted into condition-specific draft models [4]. All draft
models were checked for functionality by optimizing for
biomass while allowing unrestricted uptake of metabolites (v min, metabolite ≥ -1000 mmol/gdw hr). FVA was
performed on the draft models to determine number of
reactions with a non-zero flux. Following FVA on each
draft model, we drew phylogenetic trees of the results
and compared to phylogenetic tree based on all transcripts of protein domain sequence from the SuperFamily database [64].
Gap filling

Gap filling was done using the SMILEY algorithm, as
described elsewhere [7]. We downloaded and used the
entire KEGG database (accessed at 9/15/2009) [31] as
universal reaction database. Additionally, we created a
database of transport and exchange reaction for all
metabolites in Recon1 and the KEGG database. These

Information on mouse knockout phenotypes were
gained from the Mouse Genome Informatics site (http://
www.informatics.jax.org, accessed on 1/12/2010) [27].
For each gene whose knockout was simulated, a model
with the corresponding reaction bounds set to zero was
created. Both the wild type and knockout simulation
type models allowed cellular uptake of vital amino acids,
vital fatty acids, glucose, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur oxide,
phosphate and ions while optimizing for biomass
(detailed exchange constraints listing is in Additional
file 7). As computational methods do not allow direct
sampling of the flux solution space for large networks
[65,66], we performed FVA[63] to estimate the range of
flux values for each reaction resulting in the optimal
solution. By comparing the FVA for the wild type model
and knockout models, each reaction was then assigned a
status of decreased flux capacity (i.e., reduced vmax,i), no
change or increased flux capacity. For an unbiased selection of interesting metabolic subsystems, we counted
number of reactions with increased and decreased flux
ranges and calculated a single value Chi-Square test
with 1 degree of freedom comparing the observation
against even probability of increased and decreased flux
capacity. Since independent tests were done for each of
the 10 major subsystems, a p-value of 0.05/10 was considered statistically significant to correct for multiple
testing.
