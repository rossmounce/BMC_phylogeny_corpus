Abstract
Background: Despite the importance of egg development to the female life cycle in Drosophila,
global patterns of gene expression have not been examined in detail, primarily due to the difficulty
in isolating synchronised developmental stages in sufficient quantities for gene expression profiling.
Entry into vitellogenesis is a key stage of oogenesis and by forcing females into reproductive
diapause we are able to arrest oogenesis at the pre-vitellogenic stages. Releasing females from
diapause allows collection of relatively synchronous developing egg populations and an investigation
of some of the transcriptional dynamics apparent before and after reproductive diapause.
Results: Focusing on gender-biased transcription, we identified mechanisms of egg development
suppressed during reproductive dormancy as well as other molecular changes unique to the
diapausing female. A microarray based analysis generated a set of 3565 transcripts with at least 2fold greater expression in females as compared to control males, 1392 such changes were biased
during reproductive dormancy. In addition, we also detect 1922 up-regulated transcriptional
changes after entry into vitellogenesis, which were classified into discrete blocks of co-expression.
We discuss some of the regulatory aspects apparent after re-initiation of egg development,
exploring the underlying functions, maternal contribution and evolutionary conservation of coexpression patterns involved in egg production.
Conclusion: Although much of the work we present is descriptive, fundamental aspects of egg
development and gender-biased transcription can be derived from our time-series experiment. We
believe that our dataset will facilitate further exploration of the developmental and evolutionary
characteristics of oogenesis as well as the nature of reproductive arrest in Drosophila.

Background
Large-scale gene expression studies in Drosophilamelanogaster provide important insights into the global relationships that exist between transcription and
development [1,2]. Profiling the earliest stages of embryonic development through to late adulthood, for exam-

ple, reveals that up to 90% of transcripts are regulated at
some stage during the life-cycle [1]. The most highly conserved transcriptional components in the embryo often
originate maternally and are utilized in developmental
processes before zygotic mechanisms have been induced
[3]. Oogenesis is a dynamic, highly regulated process, that

depends on the correct developmental, environmental
and nutritional cues for normal progression. Here, we perform an extensive analysis of the expression patterns
apparent over a 72 hour period during egg development
in Drosophila. Our approach facilitates investigation of
dynamics through key transition points in oogenesis by
focusing on transcript profiles obtained before and after
entry into vitellogenesis.
Egg development in Drosophila is characterized by a process of nutrient supply to the oocyte via supporting cells
[4]. The earliest stages of oogenesis occur in the germarium, where new egg chambers are produced from germline and somatic stem cells. Once egg chambers have left
the germarium and entered the vitellarum, they comprise
three cell types: the oocyte, nurse cells and somatic follicle
cells. Processes within the vitellarium then concern further maturation of these cells, including mechanisms that
require the synchronization of processes in the ovary and
fat body for successful egg production.
The sequence of developmental events during oogenesis
are believed to follow the same overall pattern in species
from the holometabolous group of insects, although specializations in ovarian development are often apparent
due to differences in the nutritional or ecological challenges faced by different species [5]. Such specializations
include: a) the degree of ovarian development that occurs
during pupal stages, b) ovariole number and growth rate,
or c) number of eggs produced. Entry into vitellogenesis
and the switch from early egg chamber development to
more intensive oocyte growth and maturation is, however, recognized as a common control point for progression past early egg development. Vitellogenesis is
characterized by a considerable increase in the synthesis
of yolk proteins and other cytoplasmic constituents necessary for embryogenesis. Under adverse environmental
conditions, ovarian arrest can be an important feature of
egg development if continued reproductive effort has little
chance of success.
While the induction and physiological state of insects that
utilize a reproductive dormancy period are similar among
species, the duration and depth of arrest can vary widely.
For example, species that display a strong diapausing
response initiate a series of hormonally mediated events
to prepare and subsequently reduce rates of metabolism
and reproduction [6]. Once the diapausing phase is
entered it is not possible for normal activity to resume
until the developmental program is completed, regardless
of environmental conditions. In contrast, the response of
species with a shallow diapause is to reduce growth and
prevent the onset of vitellogenesis almost immediately
when environmental cues change. This state, sometimes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/242

referred to as quiescence, can be rapidly reversed under
favourable conditions with little delay [7].
When exposed to over-wintering conditions, reproductive
dormancy is induced in D. melanogaster and oogenesis is
arrested with egg chambers in a pre-vitellogenic state [8].
Females remain in this depressed developmental state for
several weeks, after which, regardless of the environmental conditions, egg production resumes. At any stage however, it is possible to restart egg development by returning
females to normal environmental conditions. In comparison to other species, these characters indicate a somewhat
shallow and conditional physiological response to ovarian arrest. Despite this flexibility, D. melanogaster diapause
is under control of the endrocrine system and circadian
response. Seasonal fluctuations affecting the lightentrained pacemaker cells of the brain, triggering hormonal conditions necessary for diapause, with D. melanogaster displaying circadian induced reproductive arrest
under laboratory conditions [8] and over environmental
clines [9,10]. This physiological state can be terminated
by transferring individuals from a short day to long day
photoperiod [8] or by the application of hormones from
the endocrine system [11-13].
The immediate hormonal basis for physiologically
induced changes during diapause, in most cases, is the
absence of Juvenile Hormone [6]. Juvenile Hormone regulates a number of early female reproductive events to
stimulate pre-vitellogenic growth of egg chambers [14].
However, while responsible for controlling early reproductive development, in D. melanogaster the deposition of
yolk proteins within oocytes and progression through the
oogenic cycle is also coincident with increasing titers of
ecydsteroids [12,13]. Ultimately there is a complex relationship between Juvenile Hormone, ecydsteroids and
yolk protein production stemming from environmental
cues that influence progression through the oogenic cycle.
Here, we use developmental arrest in D. melanogaster to
generate a transcriptional time-course from pre-vitellogenic diapause, through vitellogenesis and into the last
stages of egg development within the abdomen. We
expect that genes displaying sex-biased transcriptional
abundance are sex-biased in function, and by focusing on
gender-biased expression within fly abdomens we investigate reproductive dormancy as well as other molecular
changes unique to the diapausing female. Of particular
interest are those genes activated immediately when egg
development enters vitellogenesis. We further identify
and discuss co-expressed genes regulated after diapause in
light of the underlying site of expression, functions,
maternal contribution and evolutionary conservation
characteristic of these groups.

Results and discussion
Experimental design
Our goal was to explore the dynamics of transcriptional
variation through the oogenic cycle in Drosophila by performing a genome-wide microarray analysis of gene
expression during ovarian diapause and after the onset of
vitellogenesis. Since tissues outside the ovary contribute
to aspects of oogenesis, we elected to examine gene
expression in dissected abdomens rather than just ovaries.
The most efficient hybridization designs for two-colour
microarray experiments involve combining samples in a
staggered loop formation [15,16]. Time-points were collected before and after the release of reproductive arrest at
24 hour intervals and hybridized in a balanced loop
design, including dye-swaps (Figure 1a). Eight biological
replicates were performed for each treatment, including 3
day old male and female controls maintained under normal environmental conditions.

A short-day photoperiod (10:14 light:dark photoperiod)
and moderate temperatures (11Â°C) are required for the

induction of ovarian diapause [8]. For our microarray
experiments, 0â4 hour post-eclosion females were immediately transferred to the restrictive environmental conditions. Females were subsequently collected for RNA
extraction after 5â7 days, or were re-introduced to normal
environmental conditions to continue egg development.
A subset of ovaries were dissected from females at each
time-point and the most mature stage of ovarioles
counted to estimate progression through egg development (Figure 1b). All females dissected after 5â7 days in
diapausing conditions were pre-vitellogenic. Egg development then progressed over the next 72 hrs after the release
of diapause, with all ovarioles having entered vitellogenesis by 48 hrs and the maximum compliment of late stage
eggs apparent at 72 hrs.
Gender-biased transcription
A large proportion of genes in the genomes of sexually
reproducing species display gender-biased expression (for
a review see [17]). As a result of selection for traits that
influence the fitness of each sex, males and females can
differ dramatically, displaying sexual dimorphism in a
range of physiological or behavioural characters [18-20].
Male and female genomes typically differ by only a small
number of genes on the male Y chromosome, such that
most differences between the sexes result from sex-specific
developmental pathways that drive the differential expression of genes present in both sexes [21,22]. While dynamics of the transcriptional regulation responsible for
gender-biased expression are of interest to developmental
biologists, genes with sex-biased expression are also of
interest to evolutionary biologists in light of the antagonistic selection patterns underlying such traits.

Adult males and females display widely divergent gene
expression profiles, with over half of the genome displaying gender-biased regulation as a result of sex-specific
physiology [23-25]. In the current study, comparison of a
single time-point between male and control female samples indicate that at a 2-fold level, 2514 transcripts were
female-biased and 3238 transcripts male-biased in expression. However, we also find that the number of genes with
gender-biased expression varies significantly through the
course of the oogenic cycle (q < 0.05, 2-fold; Figure 2a).
Though typically in favour of greater male-biased transcription at any particular time-point, when transient
expression is taken into account the total number of sexually dimorphic genes becomes nearly equal, representing
49% of the genome, in accordance with previous estimates of expression. The resulting set of female-biased
genes indicates that 3565 transcripts have at least a 2-fold
greater expression in the female compared to males: of
these, 95% of transcripts in the control gender comparisons were represented [see Additional file 1]. We have

ensured the statistical power of our experiment is appropriate for further analysis (See Methods), and the use of
relatively stringent criteria allows us to focus on genes
with robust expression changes. For those interested in
more subtle changes in expression, our entire dataset is
available from the public GEO repository.
The absolute number of genes reported as gender-biased
in the literature varies widely, most probably due to a
combination of different experimental platforms, statistical methods, strains or tissues used in each study. A consensus set of sex-biased D. melanogaster genes [26],
derived from 3 independent microarray experiments
[24,27,28], was also compared to our time-series analysis.

Within the female-biased consensus set, 63% of genes
were represented in our dataset (n = 338/538), whereas an
additional 115 genes, while significantly female-biased (q
< 0.05), were expressed at levels less than two-fold that of
males. Such differences are, of course, not surprising and
even in laboratory strains of D. melanogaster expression
variation specific to females has been revealed [25]. Interestingly, 463 transcripts identified as unbiased in the consensus set were in fact up-regulated in females at some
stage during the time-course. Certainly, time-series experiments are expected to reveal information about transient
expression patterns that single-time point experiments
cannot, especially for genes with transient up-regulated
expression.

Patterns of global gene regulation during egg development
At emergence, D. melanogaster females contain early stage
egg chambers produced from germ-line and somatic stem
cells [4]. While subsequent activity of these cell types is
suppressed during diapause, the transcription level of
genes with female reproductive functions can be detected
relative to male expression, representing the stage of
development when egg production arrests. Within the
female-biased dataset, hierarchical clustering of genes by
each time-point provides a measure of global expression
similarity between samples (Figure 2b). It is clear that diapausing females in particular contain elements markedly
differentiating this time point from the others.

Indeed, while there is evidence of a rise and then fall in the
number of sexually dimorphic genes after the release of
diapause (Figure 2a), vitellogenic samples retain the most
similar global patterns of gene expression and cluster
closely together (Figure 2b). Using diapause as a reference
for pre-vitellogenic stages of development, we examined
the transcriptional variation in females progressing into
the primary period of egg production (q < 0.001, 2-fold).
We find that through the cycle, 1922 transcripts accumulated to levels at least two-fold, and 864 transcripts to levels at least three-fold, higher during diapause [see
Additional file 2]. Even though a subset of femaleenhanced transcription during diapause will concern the
early stages of egg development, other components of the
expression profile will also be linked to maintaining a diapausing state and developmental arrest, which is discussed below in more detail.
a) Suppressed oogenic activity
Of the female-biased transcripts detected during diapause,
356 are subsequently up-regulated after release from the
restrictive temperature, indicating that these transcripts
are largely repressed during this period (q < 0.001). Prior
to reproductive arrest many aspects of oogenesis have
been initiated in females. Several components of pre-vitellogenic egg chamber development are apparent, including
expression associated with 'oogenesis', 'oocyte differentiation', 'follicle cell egg chamber development' and 'vitellogenesis'. A full list of repressed female-biased processes
according to gene ontology annotations are provided (Figure 3a; [see Additional file 3, 4]).

In the early stages of oogenesis, many cellular processes
are necessary for oocyte formation. Oogenesis in insects
with meriostic ovaries is facilitated by the high degree of
polyploidy in cells responsible for egg assembly and, prior
to vitellogenesis, successive mitotic and modified cell
cycles occur in the nurse and follicle cells [29]. A large
number of transcripts repressed during diapause are
linked with such functions, including activity of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/242

'mitotic cell cycle' as well as functions of 'DNA metabolism' and 'DNA replication' being among the most significantly represented groups.
Yet another important component of egg development
repressed during diapause is the accumulation of yolk
proteins (YP). Despite confirming that after 5 days in diapausing conditions females contain egg chambers from
Stages 1â7, female-biased expression of primary yolk protein constituents were detectable (Yp1, Yp2, Yp3). Entry
into vitellogenesis begins with increased production and
incorporation of yolk protein precursors in the ovaries,
however, these tissues are not the only site of yolk protein
synthesis, since the female fat body also produces large
quantities of YPs. As products synthesized by the fat body
start to accumulate in the hemolymph immediately after
eclosion, this tissue is the most likely source of vitellogenin expression in our dataset [30]. Following the release
of diapause, all three YP transcripts are up-regulated and
expressed at high levels throughout the time-series.
b) Immediately regulated transcripts
Genes with immediate changes in expression after entry
into vitellogenesis may be directly involved in the regulation of developmental arrest and to explore this we identified those genes with a peak of activity at 24 hours that
did not subsequently change significantly through the
time-series (q < 0.001, 2-fold). The resulting set of early
regulated genes consisted of 368 up-regulated and 381
down-regulated transcripts (Figure 3a; [see Additional file
5, 6]).

Consistent with an increase in cellular activity during the
oogenic cycle, genes encoding 'protein metabolic processes' and 'RNA metabolic processes' are immediately
induced. These annotations were enriched for regulators
of 'ribosome biogenesis', including multiple members of
the TOR signalling pathway (n = 16) [31]. TOR-dependent transcription is partly responsible for controlling
growth rates and building the machinery for protein synthesis in eukaryotes. The efficiency of translation initiation is also an important correlate of cell growth and we
find genes encoding for 'transfer-RNA metabolism' regulated immediately after diapause. In particular, the growth
inhibitor Thor, which acts to prevent translation initiation, is down-regulated during this period [32].
In several insect species, a small group of transcripts from
the heat-shock family of proteins are uniquely regulated
during the oogenic cycle and are thought to have a role in
regulating entry into vitellogenesis [6,33]. Heat-shock
proteins are normally expressed in response to stress, acting as molecular chaperones to prevent the abnormal
folding of proteins. During diapause, and in the absence

Page 6 of 16

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:242

of a general stress response however, the two heat-shock
transcripts, Hsp23 and Hsp70, are up-regulated in females
until exposed to normal environmental conditions. Once
egg development has resumed, these transcripts then
become down-regulated and production of a third transcript, Hsp83, is increased.
We also find an over-representation of 'protein folding'
activity in the genes immediately regulated after diapause.
One possible reason for the expression of heat-shock proteins is that as molecular chaperones the integrity of metabolic enzymes in over-wintering periods is improved.
Certainly, expression of some of these genes is associated
with the cold hardening response of flies [34]. However,
another possibility is that they are involved in the regulation of diapause. Ecdysone, for example, directly regulates
transcription by binding to the ecdysone receptor/ultraspiracle complex, and at least Hsp83 is also associated with the
activation of this pathway [35].
As mentioned previously, the endocrine system plays a
critical role in regulating many reproductive processes and
entry into diapause is usually the result of a drop in hormone titres. Blocking Juvenile Hormone (JH) production,
as occurs in most cases of adult diapause, results not only
in the arrest of egg maturation but also induces physiological adaptations to prepare for over-wintering [6].
Increased rates of JH hydrolysis are then expected during
diapause, and we find, consistent with this expectation,
that JH catabolic activity is transcriptionally up-regulated
during reproductive arrest.
As we note above, unlike most forms of adult reproductive
arrest, yolk protein gene transcription is detected prior to
the release of diapause in D. melanogaster. While JH is, in
part, responsible for inducing many reproductive changes
during development, the deposition of egg chamber yolk
protein is coincident with increasing ecydsteroid levels
[12,13]. In our oogenesis dataset, transcript levels of the
ecdysone receptor (EcR) are not regulated significantly
through the oogenic cycle, however ultraspiracle (usp)
shows an increase in expression after the release of diapause. To date, EcR is the earliest response gene detected
in pupal diapause, and increased activity has been
recorded within an hour of returning flesh flies (Sarcophagacrassipalpis) to normal developmental activity [36]. In
contrast, the other member of the receptor complex, usp,
has a much longer response time under the same conditions, displaying a unique mode of activity in comparison
to its molecular partner. Regulation of expression was also
detected for an additional member of the early ecdysone
response hierarchy after diapause, broad. As part of the
early ecdysone genetic response, this gene has been implicated in the progression of many developmental processes, including the onset of vitellogenesis [37,38].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/242

Suppression of growth, an important characteristic of diapausing insects, is controlled by the endocrine system,
and in particular the insulin-signalling pathway. Inhibition of insulin production is critical for regulating the
metabolic switch to lipid storage in some diapausing
insects. Females destined for diapause in the mosquito
Culex pipens normally regulate transcription of the components within this pathway, including the insulin receptor
(InR) and the forkhead (foxo) transcription factor. Suppression of InR promotes activation of forkhead, prompting
lipid build-up in females and ultimately ovarian arrest
[39]. The insulin-signalling pathway has previously been
implicated in the progression of oogenesis [40,41], as well
as the ecological incidence of Drosophila reproductive diapause [9,42]. Similarly, we find regulation of forkhead
transcription, among the 'lipid metabolic processes' regulated immediately in response to diapause.
c) Response to diapause
Insects that enter into photoperiodic diapause are
expected to display patterns of expression specific to the
mechanisms maintaining developmental arrest. During
diapause, 564 transcripts are uniquely biased toward
females and we believe they represent such functions (Figure 3a; [see Additional file 7, 8]). Insects entering into a
state of reproductive arrest suppress growth and regulate
metabolic pathways ensuring that there are enough
energy reserves for prolonged periods of dormancy. Thus
we expect that transcripts representing metabolic processes should display a shift towards conserving energy
reserves. Indeed, in addition to the range of lipid metabolic processes regulated immediately after entry to vitellogenesis, we also find over-representation of 'lipid
metabolism' functions within the set of female-biased
transcripts, including a novel modulator of the insulin/
PI3K pathway, melted [32].

By reducing TOR activity (translation) and activating forkhead (gene expression), melted interacts within the insulin-signalling pathway to mimic the effects of nutrient
deprivation [32]. Consistent with these expectations,
genes implicated in the starvation response of Drosophila
were regulated within this dataset (n = 13) [43] as well as
immediately after the release from diapause (n = 30) [43].
While many of the genes influenced by melted mutations
are metabolism related, a significant number are also
associated with proteolysis [32]. Transcription of genes
encoding a variety of proteolytic enzymes was found to be
highly regulated during diapause, the majority of which
encode serine proteases, trypsin and carboxypeptidase
activity with enriched expression in the midgut (n = 36/
56).
At temperatures below 11Â°C, little digestive activity is
expected in Drosophila, and while the production of diges-

Page 7 of 16

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:242

tive enzymes is directly regulated by food availability, in
some insect species the build up of protease occurs prior
to feeding. A suite of digestive enzymes, for example, are
synthesized and stored in mosquitoes during reproductive
arrest and these are subsequently utilized in the initial
steps of digestion [44]. Unique digestive transcripts were
regulated immediately upon activation of egg development in the early response genes described above. In particular, 6 members of the Jonah gene-family, highly
enriched in midgut tissue, increased in activity and may
play an important role in the regulation of digestive activity following diapause [45,46].
Lipids are the major form of energy storage in insects.
Accumulation of triacylglycerols within specialized fat
body tissues for example act to ensure that there are
enough reserves for overwintering conditions, a process
which occurs in several temperate Drosophila species preparing for further photoperiodic diapause [47]. However,
even though slowing the use of energy reserves is crucial
to the survival of diapausing insects, carbohydrate metabolism is an important function for fuelling basal metabolic processes, which typically becomes more apparent
once an insect progresses deeper into diapause [48]. Here,
we detect regulation of such activity within diapausing
females and our dataset includes an over-representation
of both 'lipid metabolic' and 'carbohydrate metabolic'
functions. Some metabolic activity can be associated with
a sophisticated level of adaptation to prepare for overwintering conditions, and a common strategy in diapausing insects is to enhance resistance to environmental stress
[6].
Tolerance to extremes of cold and desiccation can be
improved by inducing a variety of physiological changes.
For example, it is apparent that during diapause many
'structural constituents of the cuticle' are over-represented
in our dataset. By decreasing permeability of the cuticle,
evaporation rates and water loss can be reduced, which is
critical for continued survival in harsh environmental
conditions [49]. Such physiological changes are expected
to employ molecular pathways that utilize, rather than
store, energy reserves [50]. A number of 'carbohydrate
metabolic processes' that are likely to contribute to physiological changes, including genes with 'chitin binding
activity', were found to be biased in expression.
Many of the transcripts uniquely expressed in diapausing
females are likely to have a role in longer-term adaptation
to over-wintering conditions and expression levels may be
expected to change slowly once egg development continues. Gene regulation during diapause itself is a dynamic
process that we were unable to capture in detail with the
single data-point used to characterized expression before
entry into vitellogenesis. It is expected that while some

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/242

genes will be up-regulated throughout diapause, others
will be expressed for only a short period of time, including
genes limited to expression during the early stages of
induction, later once diapause is due to terminate, or even
in a cyclically dependent fashion. Future research to
understand the molecular basis of developmental arrest in
Drosophila would benefit from an experimental design
specifically taking these aspects into consideration.
d) Constitutive & abundant expression in oogenesis
The most abundantly expressed transcripts apparent during the time-series represent another interesting set of
genes. These transcripts were identified by determining
the cumulative abundance of transcripts in the top 15th
percentile with the strongest signals and most constitutive
expression patterns [see Additional file 9, 10]. Most of the
resulting 197 transcripts correspond to functions associated with 'cellular biogenesis' and 'metabolic processes'.
Indeed, transcripts related to protein synthesis, including
translation initiation factors and ribosomal proteins, are
particularly abundant. Functions related to 'cytoskeletal
organisation' are also among the most strongly represented annotations. A variety of Tubulin and Actin encoding transcripts are members of this group, consistent with
the need for ubiquitous rates of expression and participation in the mitotic cell cycle expected for such proteins. As
expected, we find the primary constituents of 'vitellogenesis' are among the most highly expressed transcripts in the
experiment, including the three primary yolk protein molecules (Yp1, Yp2, Yp3) and vitellogenin receptor, yolkless.
We also find very high levels (up to 50-fold induction) of
genes required for eggshell production, including components secreted by the somatic follicle cells, the vitelline
membrane (Vm26Aa, Vm26Ab, Vm34Ca) and chorion
membrane (Cp15, Cp16, Cp18, Cp19, Cp36, Cp38). High
levels of eggshell gene transcription is facilitated by
genome amplification in the follicle cells during the early
stages of egg development [29]. Members of the chorion
egg shell and vitelline membrane families are known to be
expressed solely in the ovary, and serve as further validation of the datasets ability to detected genes expressed
within this tissue.
Clusters of gene expression
It is well known that female reproductive genes are typically well conserved components of the genome that are
highly expressed in the ovaries [51]. Certainly, both the
sex and tissue in which a gene is expressed influences the
degree of sequence level variation apparent in a species
[52-55]. However, not all genes expressed during egg
development are female-biased in expression and similarly many may be preferentially expressed in other parts
of the body. In order to identify biological and evolutionary processes underlying gene expression after diapause
and during vitellogenesis, we have analysed the primary

co-expression profiles apparent in our dataset using various sources of biological information [see Additional file
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].
Given the small number of time points in our experiment,
we have clustered expression patterns on the basis of an
algorithm specifically designed for short time-series analysis, whereby changes through the cycle are assigned to
discrete blocks of expression [56,57]. At each time-step,
genes are considered up or down regulated as compared
to male controls. However, it must be noted that with this
approach not all transcripts are assigned to significantly
represented clusters and here we only consider those profiles with an over-represented number of genes. Expression profiles with a minimal correlation of 0.8 were
clustered together, and in total, transcript patterns fit
broadly into five groups (Figure 3b).
The three largest clusters, P1-3, represent almost 80% of
gene expression within the dataset and several characteristics typical of egg production are apparent in these profiles. Once diapause is terminated, a major shift in the
patterns of gene expression is expected with rapidly
increasing growth rates and initiation of further develop-

ment. Not surprisingly, over-represented GO annotation
within P1 and P2 reveals a strong association with genes
involved in 'oogenesis', 'cell cycle' and 'DNA metabolism'
(Figure 3b; [see Additional file 16, 17]). Many basic cellular processes are necessary for the proper formation of
oocytes and in non-diapausing females there is an abundance of genes related to progression of the cell cycle and
supporting cellular metabolic machinery. P3 also contains genes involved in many aspects of 'cell cycle' and
'DNA repair' among other cellular functions; in addition,
'eggshell formation' transcripts were represented in this
group (Figure 3b; [see Additional file 18]).
Concordant with this, the genetic dissection of Drosophila
oogenesis has shown that many genes disrupting oogenesis often have indirect requirements or pleiotrophic effects
linked to functions performed prior to adulthood. Mutation in such genes can result in reduced viability [58] and
genes involved in egg development should reflect these
characteristics. In addition to a low number of genes with
tissue-specific transcription and a higher incidence of
ubiquitous expression than expected, the genes within
profiles P1 and P2 also have a high proportion of annotated lethal phenotypes (Figure 4a).

Another important characteristic of genes expressed during oogenesis is that they are likely to be a part of the regulatory cascades influencing early stages of embryonic
development, since early embryogenesis is largely
directed by maternally transcribed mRNA. As maternally
deposited transcripts only become translationally active
after fertilization, genes encoding such transcripts can be
classified on the basis of distinctive expression profiles
recorded during embryogenesis. An analysis of transcription from 30 time-points through the first 24 hours of
development has identified a set of maternally derived
genes in Drosophila [3], which we compared to the oogenic
time-series.
The majority of regulated profiles were enriched for
maternal products, supporting the notion that these genes
are strongly linked to egg development (Figure 4b), and as
a whole, we find 603 genes that are annotated as maternally contributed to the embryo. All maternal genes start
with high levels of relative transcription, but subsequently
show either a sharp decline "early" (3â5 hrs) or "late"
(11â20 hrs) during the time-course. Of those transcripts
in the present dataset, we find an equal representation of
genes displaying early (n = 145/331) and late (n = 278/
534) changes in expression. Among other vital functions,
maternal constituents are responsible for initiating the
replication and expression of the zygotic genome. Analysis of associated GO annotations reveals there is an overrepresentation of genes involved in 'cell division', 'DNA
metabolism' and 'chromosome organization' functions
that most likely facilitate the rapid cell divisions that take
place in the early embryo [see Additional file 22].
Evolutionary considerations
It has been reported previously that the gender in which a
gene is expressed often acts to influence sequence level
variation within and between species [55]. A large propor

tion of transcripts expressed either in the germline, or
dependent on the presence of the germline, are genderbiased [51,59]. We find that in addition to enrichment for
female-biased expression in P1 and P3, the majority of
genes are also preferentially expressed in the ovaries (Figure 4c). However, it is apparent that not all profiles are
expressed most abundantly in females when compared to
males, including a smaller subset of profiles that remain
either largely unbiased or at particularly elevated levels in
males through the time-series (Figure 5).
We explored evidence for different rates of evolution
using whole genome sequence divergence. Thanks to
recent sequencing efforts, estimates of positive selection
(Ï) in models comparing non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) divergence rates are widely available for
single orthologues in the Drosophila species complex that
covers ~15 million years of evolution [60]. In addition to
estimating the degree of evolutionary constraint across the
phylogeny with a simple model of codon substitution
(M0), we also calculate positive selection in gene profiles
on the basis of site-specific models (M7, M8). These data
are summarized in Table 1.
While female reproductive transcripts occasionally evolve
under positive selection [61], most reports indicate that
these genes are influenced primarily by balancing selection [18-20]. Here, with exception of the two largest profiles in which divergence was lower than expected,
positive selection of oogenic genes in the Drosophila phylogeny (Ï) did not differ widely from whole genome
expectations (Table 1). Overall, although some positive
selection was detected in genes from the time-series, these
instances were not over-represented and constituted only
a small proportion of the genes detected.

expression was calculated as genes with a 2-fold greater level
of expression in either sex (q < 0.05), while unbiased expression was calculated as the remainder.

In contrast, sequence variation of reproductive genes preferentially expressed in males is expected to show a high
degree of evolutionary divergence [55]. Even though two
of the five clusters in our dataset show little evidence of
female-biased expression over the time-series, and an
enrichment of gene expression in the testis (P4 +80:-10;
P5 +25:-13), they do not appear to be evolving at faster
rates (Table 1). As males and females have distinct roles in

reproduction, evolutionary conflicts commonly arise
when each sex is selected towards a different optimal phenotype. Certainly, intersexual fitness shows a substantial
degree of discourse within D. melanogaster [62]. Genes
with biased expression in the male accessory gland have
received considerable attention in this regard, because
when passed on to females during mating they can subsequently induce a variety of changes in female gene expression [63].

tional cues are necessary for normal progression of the
oogenic cycle and so may also have an important role in
maintaining developmental arrest. Our data provide a
baseline for the further exploration of diapause with the
identification of gene expression changes immediately
following release from oogenic arrest. The identified
molecular processes, both specific to the ovary and at the
whole animal level, provide an entry point for examining
the physiology of this complex biological response.

However, if a gene has either multiple functions or is
expressed in multiple tissues, strong pleiotropic constraints may exist forcing selection to be sub-optimal in
order to balance fitness requirements. Subsequent exploration of GO annotation indicates that many of these
genes in P4-P5 have a role in 'mitosis', 'chromosome segregation' and 'spermatogenesis' (Figure 3b; [see Additional file 19, 20]), but while they are enriched for
expression in the testis, these profiles also display a high
level of ovary enrichment and are generally expressed
throughout the body according to tau-statistics (Figure 4c;
See Methods). Although elevated levels of these transcripts may then be required for sperm development,
many are likely have more ubiquitous cellular functions,
as well as being necessary for egg development.

Almost 14% of genes in the genome are developmental
activated during vitellogenesis, the majority of which can
be classified into discrete blocks of co-expression. All profiles contain genes with known or predicted roles in egg
development, including an abundance of maternal constituents with important roles later in embryogenesis.
Clusters with the largest number of maternal transcripts
also display an over-representation of known lethal mutations and appear to evolve at normal or even reduced rates
compared with estimates for the whole genome. It is generally expected that genes displaying sex-biased transcriptional abundance are sex-biased in function, however, not
all profiles were preferentially expressed in females. We
identify a smaller subset of profiles that remain either
largely unbiased or preferentially expressed in males.
Despite evidence for preferential expression in the testis
and a role in spermatogenesis, these profiles were not
evolving faster than the genome-wide estimates of divergence as might be expected.

Conclusion
Our dataset provides further insight into patterns of gene
expression during Drosophila oogenesis. Entry into vitellogenesis is an important stage of egg formation and by
delaying entry past this control point, we have been able
to investigate transcriptional dynamics before and after
early egg development in the fly abdomen. Prior to reproductive arrest, many aspects of oogenesis have in fact been
initiated in females. We detect transcription associated
with several pre-vitellogenic developmental processes,
including suppression of the cellular machinery necessary
for successive mitotic and modified rounds of the cell
cycle within early egg chambers. Yolk protein transcription is also largely inhibited during this period, however,
once diapause is terminated by returning females to normal environmental conditions, a major shift in the patterns of gene expression is observed.
Immediately after introduction to normal environmental
conditions, components most likely to regulate vitellogenesis are apparent, and we discuss evidence for the
potential role of heat-shock proteins and hormone-regulated transcripts in this process. Even though Drosophila
does not have the classic diapause response of many well
adapted temperate insects, females display a shift towards
regulating lipid reserves and inhibiting growth. Regulators
of the insulin-signalling pathway that have previously
been suggested to have at least partial control of developmental arrest are detected. Certainly, the correct nutri-

Our studies provide a step towards further understanding
the genetic control networks underlying egg development
in Drosophila, and entry into vitellogenesis in particular.
Analysis confirms many of the characteristics expected for
genes involved in egg development, but also reveal a
number of expression groups with unusual characteristics,
including genes with apparent male-biased functions.
Once genes with unique expression patterns during diapause are removed, 3358 transcripts were either femalebiased in expression or significantly variable through the
time-series and are proposed to have a role in egg development. Genes expressed during oogenesis are likely to
make ideal candidates for the control of insect populations when transcripts that encode essential functions or
are related to reproductive capacity can be targeted in population engineering programs. We hope the development
of this regulatory framework will also enable comparative
studies to be initiated with species whose control has
important medical implications, such as the malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti.

nucleotide probes (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
accession: GPL5016), prepared in the FlyChip microarray
facility, University of Cambridge http://www.fly
chip.org.uk. Total RNA was prepared from samples of 10
abdomens, dissected under light CO2 aesthesia, by
homogenization and extraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Each RNA sample (5 Î¼g) was initially reverse
transcribed to cDNA before second strand synthesis was
performed to obtain double stranded DNA. Double
stranded DNA samples were then labelled with Cy3- and
Cy5-fluorescent dye using the Klenow fragment of DNA
polymerase prior to competitive hybridisation to microarrays in a Genomic Solutions hybridisation station for 16
hours at 51Â°C. After hybridization, slides were washed,
spun dry and scanned with 635-nm and 532-nm lasers
using a Genepix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). Full
protocols are available from the FlyChip website. For this
study oligonucleotide probes and genes were mapped to
Flybase version FB2008.06 http://www.flybase.org.
Microarray data has been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession series: GSE13303.
Normalisation of microarrays
After imaging, spot-finding and quantification were performed using Dapple software [64]. Dapple image analysis returns foreground and background intensity values
for each probe, along with an indicator of spot quality,
which are used to weight further normalization and analysis of differential expression. The resulting datasets were
analysed using the Bioconductor software environment
[65].

Prior to the analysis of differential expression, background correction and normalization procedures were
performed using the LIMMA package [66] to remove poor
quality features and standardize arrays for statistical comparisons. Background correction is responsible for the
removal of localized and non-specific signals on microarrays that can arise from a variety of sources, such as
labelled deposits left after washing stages or ambient
noise in the scanning equipment. One way of dealing
with such variation is to filter out low intensity spots,
where foreground expression is lower than, or equal, to
background intensity. However, this approach inevitably
leads to missing values among probes, influencing variance and downstream analysis of differential expression.
The preferred alternative is to stabilize variance as a function of intensity, such that lower intensity spots are offset
to have reduced variation in fold changes.
Here, we employ the normexp+offset (50) method for background correction, an approach that has been show to
produce the lowest rates of false discovery [67]. In addition to background correction, normalization of variation
within, as well between arrays, needs to be considered in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/242

two-colour microarray experiments. Of particular concern
is how to control for the effects of variation in printing
quality and dye incorporation on spot intensity. Print-tip
loess normalization provides a well tested method for
local normalization of M-values within separate arrays,
while variation across arrays can be standardized with
quantile normalization of intensity values [68]. The printtip loess method was implemented by weighting normalization in relation to spot quality. All analyses were performed on log-transformed ratios.
Differential expression & gene clustering
Linear modelling was used to assess the differential
expression of probes by one-way analysis of variance as
implemented in the LIMMA software package [66]. Estimates of sample variance were pooled using empirical
Bayes to generate a moderated t-statistic and increase confidence of differential expression. As part of the model,
probe quality weights were included in the estimation of
t-statistics, ensuring probes with high background intensities were removed from further analysis. Estimates of differential expression were adjusted for multiple testing
using the false discovery rate method [69]. Adjusted F-statistics were used to identify genes in male or diapause reference comparisons with variable expression at the given
fold change and significance level in the main text.

Discrimination of expression profiles through the oogenic
cycle was achieved with clusters generated by the Short
Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) [56,57]. This algorithm uses a simplification strategy to categorize expression as a function of time, in which changes through the
time-series are assigned to discrete blocks of transcription.
Simplification methods have the benefit of reducing noise
in the original dataset by decreasing overall dimensionality of expression, making this type of analysis more robust
to noise [70]. Moreover, unlike most unsupervised methods of clustering in which the number of groups must be
provided before analysis (e.g. k-means), STEM generates a
series of potential profiles with respect to the direction
and magnitude of expression, after which enrichment of
clusters is determined by comparing the distribution of
observed groups to those expected in a random permutation.
Statistical power
Post hoc power calculations were based on t-tests (alpha
= 0.05) to measure the difference between male and
female control samples [71]. The effective size for power
(Type I Errors) was calculated using standard deviation of
intensity measures within the 50th percentile of genes
with least variance. We found that with a 2-fold-change of
expression between treatments our analysis was expected
to detect 96.8% of differentially expressed genes. Similarly, Pearson correlation was determined to be R2 = 0.983

across all treatments using intensity values for genes with
a calculated variance, further indicating that there is not a
high degree of variation between the replicates of our
experiments. Gene expression measures obtained with the
INDAC probe set and quantitative-PCR are known to be
highly correlated [72-74].

Authors' contributions

Database resources
a) Gene Ontology annotation
Gene Ontology annotations http://www.geneontol
ogy.org were examined for each list of differentially
expressed genes and are available in the supplementary
information [75]. To identify over-represented GO categories (July 2008 Annotation), a hypergeometric test was
implemented in R against a subset of common high-level
and low-level annotations representative of different functions using the GOstats library from the Bioconductor
software environment [65]. Over-representation of annotations were adjusted for multiple testing using the false
discovery rate method [69].

Additional material

b) Tissue specificity
Gene lists were further integrated with the tissue-dissected
microarray database, FlyAtlas http://www.flyatlas.org[76].
Two measures of tissue specificity from 11 adult tissues
(brain, midgut, hindgut, head, crop, Malphigian tubule,
ovary, testis, accessory gland, thoracic and abdominal carcass and thoracico-abdominal ganglia) were subsequently
obtained to include; a) expression enrichment for tissues
versus whole animal comparisons, b) the degree of tissue
bias as measured by normalizing against maximal expression [77]. Tissue bias values, as measured by the t-statistic,
fall within the range of 0 to 1, in which higher values indicate more tissue-biased expression, i.e. a value of 1 indicates expression in a single tissue, and a value of 0
expression in all tissues.

DAB conceived and designed the study, performed the
diapausing experiments, and wrote the manuscript. SR
participated in the design of this study and helped to draft
the manuscript. Both authors read and approved the final
