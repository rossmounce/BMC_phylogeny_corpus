Abstract
Background: Chicken anemia virus (CAV) is the causative agent of chicken infectious anemia
(CIA). Study on the type of CAV isolates present and their genetic diversity, transmission to their
progeny and level of protection afforded in the breeder farms is lacking in Malaysia. Hence, the
present study was aimed to detect CAV from commercial broiler breeder farms and characterize
CAV positive samples based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 gene.
Results: A total of 12 CAV isolates from different commercial broiler breeder farms were isolated
and characterized. Detection of CAV positive embryos by the PCR assay in the range of 40 to 100%
for different farms indicated high level of occurrence of vertical transmission of viral DNA to the
progeny. CAV antigen was detected in the thymus and in the bone marrow but not in spleen, liver,
duodenum, ovary and oviduct by indirect immunoperoxidase staining. The 12 CAV isolates were
characterized based on partial sequences of VP1 gene. Six isolates (MF1A, MF3C, M3B5, NF4A,
P12B and P24A) were found to have maximum homology with previously characterized Malaysian
isolate SMSC-1, four isolates (M1B1, NF3A, PYT4 and PPW4) with isolate BL-5 and the remaining
two (NF1D and NF2C) have maximum homology both with isolates 3-1 and BL-5. Meanwhile,
seven of the isolates with amino acid profile of 75-I, 97-L, 139-Q and 144-Q were clustered
together in cluster I together with other isolates from different geographical places. The remaining
five isolates with amino acid profile of 75-V, 97-M, 139-K and 144-E were grouped under cluster II.
All the CAV isolates demonstrated omega values (Ka/Ks) of less than one (the values ranging from
0.07 to 0.5) suggesting the occurrence of purifying (negative) selection in all the studied isolates.
Conclusion: The present study showed that CAV is widespread in the studied commercial broiler
breeder farms. The result also indicated the occurrence of genetic variability in local CAV isolates
that can be divided at least into two groups based on characteristic amino acid substitutions at
positions 75, 97, 139 and 144 of the VP1 protein.

Background
Chicken anemia virus (CAV) is a small DNA virus with a
circular, covalently linked, single negative-strand genome.
It is the causative agent of chicken infectious anemia
(CIA) and classified in the family Circoviridae, genus
Gyrovirus [1].
CAV is an economically important pathogen with a
world-wide distribution. CAV infections are manifested
by either clinical or subclinical signs [2]. The clinical disease is mainly noticed in young chicks of 10–14 days of
age, which usually acquire the infection vertically. Chickens older than 2–3 weeks of age are also susceptible to
infection, but will only develop a subclinical disease evidenced by poor vaccine response, increased severity of
other infections [2,3], and decreased cell mediated
immune responses [4,5]. Outbreaks of the disease are
characterized by anemia, thymus atrophy, bone marrow
aplasia and immunosuppression [3,6].
In general, no significant antigenic or pathogenic difference was reported among the CAV isolates in the past.
Thus, until lately, CAV was known as a much conserved
virus of one serotype [7] with several genetic groups [8].
However, an antigenically different isolate (CAV-7) has
been reported from USA [9,10], which could be a prototype virus of serotype 2. In Malaysia, previous studies
undertaken indicated high prevalence of the virus in commercial broiler and layer farms [11]. Subsequently, CAV
isolates were isolated from broilers farms and some of
these isolates have been characterized based on pathogenicity and molecular analysis [12,13]. However, there is
no study conducted in the broiler breeder farms regarding
the extent of occurrence of the virus, type of isolates
present and their genetic diversity. In the present study we
report detection of CAV and characterization of isolates
based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of partial
VP1 gene from commercial broiler breeder chickens in
Malaysia. Level of transmission to the progeny and level
of protection afforded in the commercial broiler breeder
chickens were also analyzed and discussed.

Results
Distribution of CAV DNA in various organs in commercial
broiler breeder hens
A total of 420 organ samples collected from 60 commercial broiler breeder hens were tested by nested PCR assay
for the presence of CAV DNA. The data are summarized in
Additional file 1. The highest percentage of positive samples was detected in spleen where 45 samples out of 60
(75%) were positive for CAV DNA. Duodenum was found
to be an organ with the least distribution of CAV DNA in
which 28 organs out of 60 (46.7%) were positive for CAV
DNA. Even though, there is difference in the percentages
of CAV DNA between spleen, bone marrow, thymus and

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/128

ovary, the differences were not statistically significant (P <
0.05). However, the distributions of viral DNA in liver,
duodenum and oviduct were significantly less (P < 0.05)
from the rest of the organs.
CAV DNA in embryos and egg shell membranes (ESM)
The nested PCR assay result indicated the presence of positive embryos ranging from 40–100% in different farms
from three states of Malaysia (Fig. 1).
Nucleotide sequence analysis
Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 498 bp region of CAV
genome from position 892 to 1389; numbering according
to Meehan et al. [14], encompassing the hypervariable
region of VP1 protein revealed total nucleotide variation
among the isolates ranging from 0.3 to 6.1% whilst the
overall maximum nucleotide variation is 6.5%. The nucleotide sequence alignment with the published isolates considered for comparison revealed 9 to 30 nucleotide
substitutions in the isolates from commercial broiler
chickens (Table 2). Based on comparisons of percentage
homologies, six isolates (MF1A, MF3C, M3B5, NF4A,
P12B and P24A) were found to have maximum homology
(97.1 to 99.1%) with SMSC-1 isolate, four isolates (M1B1,
NF3A, PYT4 and PPW4) were found to have maximum
homology (98.1 to 98.9%) with BL-5 isolate and the
remaining two (NF1D and NF2C) have similar maximum
homology (98.1%) both with isolates 3-1 and BL-5 (Table
1).

Compared to isolates from other geographical places
around the world, six out of 12 isolates (MF1A, MF3C,
M3B5, NF4A, P12B, and P24A) were found to have maximum homology with Australian isolate 704. The remaining isolates showed maximum homology with isolates
from China (NF3A and PYT4), isolate A2 from Japan
(NF1D and NF2C) and CAV-B isolate from India (PPW4).
Only two of the isolates (M1B1 and NF3A) were found to
have maximum homology with isolates 26P4 and DelRos from USA.
Amino acid sequence analysis
The amino acid sequence alignment with the published
isolates considered for comparison also showed 4 to 7
amino acid substitutions in the isolates from commercial
broiler breeder chickens (Table 2). The calculation of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rate demonstrated omega values (Ka/Ks) of less than one suggesting
the occurrence of purifying (negative) selection in all the
12 isolates (Table 2). All the isolates have the omega value
ranging from 0.07 to 0.35 except for PPW4 with omega
value of 0.50. Eight variable amino acid positions were
detected in more than one isolate at amino acid positions
22, 75, 83, 97, 125, 139, 141, 144. Maximum variation
among the CAV isolates was observed at amino acid posi-

Accordingly, isolates MF1A, MF3C, M3B5, NF4A, P12B and P24A
were found to have maximum homology with SMSC-1 isolate, where
as four isolates (M1B1, NF3A, PYT4 and PPW4) were found to have

amino acid substitutions found only in the studied isolates (Table 3).
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis based on 165 deduced amino acid
sequences of VP1 protein of the 12 isolates in comparison
to 20 previously identified isolates revealed the formation
of two clusters. All the 12 isolates were found both in cluster I and II (Fig. 2). Seven of the isolates with amino acid
profile of 75-I, 97-L, 139-Q and 144-Q were clustered
together in cluster I while the remaining five isolates with
amino acid profile of 75-V, 97-M, 139-K and 144-E were
grouped under cluster II.
ELISA
The ELISA result shows that CAV infection is widespread
in these unvaccinated commercial broiler chicken farms
in Malaysia. Out of 52 chickens from which serum sample
was collected, 50 (96.15%) were positive for antibodies
against CAV (Fig. 3).

Out of the total number of hens sampled 26 hens (50%)
have anti-CAV antibody titers above 8600 (high protective
titers), 24 hens (46.15%) have the titer below 8600 but

above 1000 (moderate protective titers) and 2 hens
(3.85%) have anti-CAV antibody titers below 1000 (negative for antibodies against CAV). The ELISA-based analysis indicated that all farms had neutralizing antibodies.
Based on the correlation of ELISA titer to virus neutralizing antibody titer as recommended by the manufacturer
of the ELISA kit, 50% of hens found out to have high neutralizing antibody titers that able to confer high level protection to the progeny whilst 46.15% of hens have low
neutralizing antibody titers affording low levels of protection to the progeny (Fig. 3).
Indirect immunoperoxidase staining
All the experimentally infected chickens from hyperimmune serum production produced the highest readable
antibody titer (>8661) which remained constant starting
from two weeks after the second inoculation. Sera from
the inoculated and control chickens were used as primary
antibodies for the indirect immunoperoxidase staining.
Specific positive staining was demonstrated in thymus
and bone marrow tissue sections from commercial broiler
breeder chickens that were detected positive for CAV
DNA. Positive staining was observed in lymphoblasts in
the cortex of the thymus (Fig. 4) and in hemocytoblasts in
the sinuses of the bone marrow (Fig. 5). Specific staining
was not demonstrated in tissue sections from spleen, liver,
duodenum, ovary and oviduct.

Discussion
In the present study, out of 420 organ samples tested, 75%
of spleen, 68.3% of bone marrow, 70% of thymus, 53.3%
of liver, 46.7% of duodenum, 66.7% of ovary and 48.3%
of oviduct tested were positive for CAV DNA. CAV replicates mostly in lymphoid tissues of susceptible chickens

[15-17]. Cardona et al. [18] found out a few CAV positive
cells in spleen by in situ PCR and managed to detect CAV
in ovaries by in situ PCR even in the absence of splenic
virus. They also indicated that ovaries and to a lesser
degree infundibulum of the oviduct are sites for persistence of CAV in hens. The finding of significantly higher
positive tissues in the spleen, bone marrow, thymus and
ovary as compared to duodenum, liver and oviduct in the
present study is similar to the aforementioned findings.
Therefore, we can suggest that spleen, thymus, and bone
marrow could serve as an excellent choice of organs for
the diagnosis of CAV infection while ovary representing
more favourable tissue for the persistence of CAV in the
reproductive organs in the broiler breeder hens.
Results from ELISA reading showed that 96.15% of blood
samples collected from the same farms were positive for
antibody against CAV indicating the widespread occurrence of CAV infection in these unvaccinated commercial
broiler breeder chicken farms. Testing pooled embryonic
tissue samples (thymus, bursa of Fabricius and spleen)
together with ESM showed positive embryos for CAV
DNA in the range of 40% to 100% for different commercial broiler breeder chickens despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies in majority of the hens (96.15%)
tested for CAV antibodies suggesting high level of occurrence of vertical transmission of viral DNA to the progeny.
The detection of CAV DNA in the ovary and oviduct of
commercial broiler breeder hens with virus neutralizing
antibodies and in their embryos supports the previous
evidence that CAV may remain in the gonads of antibody
positive chickens and can be vertically transmitted to their
progeny [18-21]. The finding by Schat et al. [2] indicated
low level of viral transcripts can be detected in the devel-

Amino acids marked with an asterisk (*) are unique substitutions for isolates from commercial broiler breeder chickens. The isolates can be
grouped into two distinct groups based on their amino acid profile at positions 75, 97, 139 and 144. Five isolates (M1B1, NF1D, NF2C, NF3A and
PYT4) had amino acid profile of 75-V, 97-M, 139-K and 144-E.

oping embryo during specific developmental periods supporting the current hypothesis that, it may be possible
that a limited viral replication occurs in the embryos, but
if the embryos have VN antibodies, the VN antibodies prevent the development of viremia in the embryos [19].
Viral antigens were identified only in individual lymphocytes in the cortex of the thymus and infected hemocytoblasts in the bone marrow of tissues collected from
commercial broiler breeder chickens by the IPS. However,
consistent and observable differences on the intensity of
staining were not observed on those positive slides from
individual chickens with moderate and high protective
antibody titers at the same level of dilution of primary
antibodies. Specific staining could not be detected in
spleen, liver, duodenum, ovary and oviduct. Most of the

tissue sections obtained from commercial broiler breeder
chickens and tested positive by the nested PCR assay
turned out to be negative in IPS. This could be due to virus
replication in those tissues might be limited and below
the detection limit of the assay. It might also be related
with the age of commercial broiler breeder chickens or the
poor sensitivity of the technique compared to the other
two detection methods used in the present study namely
the nested PCR assay for detecting CAV DNA and ELISA
for detection of antibodies against CAV. Smyth et al. [17]
demonstrated viral antigens in the lymphoid tissues of
other organs including proventriculus, the ascending part
of duodenum, kidney and lung. However, they also confirmed that, infected cells in these tissues usually cannot
be detected for more than 22 days after infection at one
day of age.

Phylogenetic relationship among 32 different CAV isolates based on partial VP1 amino acid sequences. Note:
The boxes (n) indicate isolates identified in this study. The isolates were found both cluster I and II. Seven of the isolates with
amino acid profiles of 75-I, 97-L, 139-Q and 144-Q clustered together in cluster I. The remaining five studied isolates with
amino acid profiles of 75-V, 97-M, 139-K and 144-E were grouped under cluster II.

Comparisons of percentage homologies of the studied
CAV isolates with previously characterized local CAV isolates showed diverse similarity among the local isolates.
The phylogenetic analysis of 165 deduced amino acid
sequences of the VP1 protein also revealed grouping of the

Malaysian CAV isolates into two major clusters (Fig. 2).
An overall similarity with CAV isolates circulating in
south and south-east Asia and Australia was also observed
while still having limited variation with isolates from different geographical parts of the world. Natesan et al. [22]

from USA. In that study, they indicated that different CAV
isolates from Alabama can be divided into two groups
with one isolate showing an exceptionally different amino

75-I/T, 97-L, 139-Q and 144-Q can be used to group CAV
isolates into different groups. In the present study, two
distinct groups were observed in the current isolates based
on their amino acid profile at these positions. Seven of the
isolates from the commercial broiler breeder chickens
including previously characterized Malaysian isolate
SMSC-1, had 75-I, 97-L, 139-Q and 144-Q and clustered
together in cluster I of the deduced amino acid phylogenetic tree. Together in this group also included other isolates from different geographical places. This includes,
CIA-1 from USA, CAV-B from India, BD-3 from Bangladesh, isolate 704 from Australia, isolate 130 from Slovenia and NIE/19.04/118 isolate from Nigeria. The
remaining five current isolates including previously characterized Malaysian isolates BL-5 [12] and 3-1 [13] had
amino acid profile of 75-V, 97-M, 139-K and 144-E. These
isolates were found in cluster II of the deduced amino acid
phylogenetic tree with other isolates from around the
world. In addition, there was no evidence of recombina-

The analysis of the ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rate (omega value) indicated the presence of only purifying (negative) selection in the studied
isolates. This is similar to the result by Ducatez et al. [24]
where they indicated a very slow CAV virus evolution at
amino acid level corresponding to a strong negative selection (0.04 to 0.20) of VP1 gene in China and worldwide.
However, in this study, we found that one of the isolates
has omega value of 0.50 meanwhile five out of 12 isolates
have omega value between 0.25 to 0.35 and the rest with
omega value of 0.07 to 0.11 (Table 2). In our previous
study, we suggested that the BL-5 isolate was distantly
related to other Malaysian CAV isolates, SMSC-1 and 3-1
[12], has omega value of 1.50 suggesting of a positive
selection of VP1 protein in this isolate (Table 2).
The overall phylogenetic pattern and clustering of different CAV isolates based on the partial VP1 gene in this
study was similar to previous one based on complete
sequence of VP1 gene [24] or the entire CAV genome [25]
for the common CAV isolates considered in all the three
studies. This suggests that relationships of different CAV
isolates can be determined on the basis of partial
sequence of VP1 gene due to the fact that most of the
amino acid substitutions in comparisons between isolates
lies in VP1 gene and more specifically on the N-terminal
half of VP1 gene.

Conclusion
Generally, from the present study we can conclude the
widespread occurrence of CAV infection in commercial
broiler breeder farms at least in the three states of Malaysia. Detection of significantly higher percentage of positive DNA from spleen, thymus and bone marrow make
these organs an excellent choice of organs in the screening
and diagnosis of flocks for CAV infection. The finding of
CAV DNA in embryos from broiler breeder chickens with
neutralizing antibodies supports the previous finding that
CAV may remain in the gonads of antibody positive chickens and can be vertically transmitted to their progeny.
However, the importance of transmission of viral DNA
detected by nested PCR assay still needs further study and
explanation. The result also indicated the occurrence of
genetic variability in local CAV isolates that can be divided
at least into two groups based on characteristic amino acid
substitutions at positions 75, 97, 139 and 144 of the VP1
protein. However, the CAV isolates showed only negative

selection based on the calculated omega value of the partial sequences of the VP1 gene. The characterized CAV isolates show overall similarity with CAV isolates circulating
in South East Asia and Australia while still having limited
variations with isolates from different geographical parts
of the world.

Methods
Broiler breeder farms
Tissue and blood samples were collected from 12 commercial broiler breeder chicken farms located at three
states of Peninsular Malaysia. The farms were not vaccinated against CAV and the samples were collected from a

total of 60 broiler breeder hens that range in age from 25–
35 weeks.
Sample collection
A total of 420 organ samples were collected. Spleen, thymus, liver, bone marrow, duodenum, ovaries and oviduct
were organs collected from each hen. Blood samples were
collected from 52 broiler breeder hens by veno-puncture
of the wing vein. Sera were separated and stored at -20°C
until used.

Ten eggs were also collected from each farm and incubated for 18–20 days. Prior to hatching pooled embryonic
organ samples consisting of thymus, bursa of Fabricius

and spleen together with egg shell membrane (ESM) were
collected from individual embryos. Tissue samples from
the hens and embryos were stored at -20°C until DNA
extraction.
DNA Extraction from Samples
DNA was extracted from a total of 420 tissue sample from
hens and 52 pooled embryo samples. Briefly, tissue samples (1–5 mg) were homogenized in Phosphate Buffered
Saline (PBS) solution by grounding with a mortar and
pestle. Then the homogenate (~700 μl) was transferred
into 1.5 ml eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 13000 rpm
for 1 minute. The supernatant was then transferred into a
new microcentrifuge tube. DNA extraction was carried out
using MasterPure complete DNA and RNA purification kit
(Epicentre, Madison, WI), following the instructions of
the manufacturer with some modifications. The concentration and purity of the extracted DNAs were determined
by a spectrophotometer (Beckman, USA) according to the
method described by Sambrook et al. [26].
Detection of CAV by nested PCR assay
The extracted DNA was first screened for CAV DNA using
a highly sensitive nested detection PCR as previously
described by Cardona et al. [18] with slight modifications.
The first-step PCR reaction was carried out using 20 pmol
each of the primers O3F and O3R amplifying a 386 bp
fragment of the VP3 gene [18]. The PCR reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl using the following
cycling parameters: initial denaturation of 94°C for 2 min
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation, annealing and
extension at 94°C for 2 min, 50°C for 1 min and 72°C for
1 min, respectively, and the final extension was carried
out at 72°C for 3 min. An aliquot of the first PCR reaction
(1 μl) was then added to 24 μl of a new mastermix (total
volume 25 μl) containing 20 pmol of the nested primers
N3 and primer N4 for amplification of a 209 bp nested
fragment of the VP3 gene as reported by Cardona et al.
[18]. The nested PCR assay was carried out in MyCycler®
Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR
products were analyzed by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and the photographs were taken using Bio Imaging
System in GeneSnap program (SynGene, Cambridge,
UK).
Amplification of partial VP1 gene for sequencing
Spleen samples from each farm that were detected CAV
positive by VP3 nested PCR assay were used for amplification of partial VP1 gene using primers VP1F and VP1R for
the first round amplification as described by Natesan et al.
[22]. Nested fragment of first round amplification were
amplified using primers O1F and PshA1R [18]. The first
round PCR condition was carried out using the following
cycling parameters: initial denaturation of 94°C for 4 min
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation, annealing and

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/128

extension at 94°C for 1 min, 57°C for 1 min and 72°C for
2 min, respectively, and the final extension was carried
out at 72°C for 8 min. The second synthesis was carried
out in a 50 μl reaction mixture with 1 μl of the first PCR
reaction product and cycling parameters similar to that
described for nested detection PCR. The PCR products
were run on 1.6% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified
from the gel by using GeneAll® kit (General Biosystem
Inc., Korea) following the supplied instructions.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Using the gel purified PCR products, the partial nucleotide sequences of VP1 gene were determined by direct
sequencing in both direction using nested primers O1F
and PshA1R. Sequencing reactions were performed in MJ
Research PTC-225 Peltier Thermal Cycler using ABI
PRISM® BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kits with
AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (FS enzyme) (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Each sample was sequenced three times
to confirm consistency of the sequencing results.

DNA sequences of the 12 CAV isolates were aligned and
compared with 20 local and foreign CAV isolates retrieved
from the GenBank database. Sequences of VP1 gene for
the studied Malaysian isolates were submitted to GenBank under the following accession numbers: MF1A
[FJ167513]; MF3C [FJ167514]; M1B1 [FJ167515]; M3B5
[FJ167516]; NF1D [FJ167517]; NF2C [FJ167518]; NF3A
[FJ167519]; NF4A [FJ167520]; P12B [FJ167521]; P24A
[FJ167522]; PYT4 [FJ167523]; PPW4 [FJ167524]. The
retrieved CAV isolates sequence name, GenBank accession
numbers (in square brackets) and country are as follows:

sequence identity matrix and translation from nucleotides
to amino acids were determined using BioEdit software
package version 7.01 [27]. Multiple sequence alignment
of nucleotide and translated amino acids were performed
using ClustalX software [28]. The phylogenic analysis of
165 deduced amino acids of the VP1 gene was performed
with the software MEGA4 for phylogenetic and molecular
evolutionary analyses using the Neighbor Joining Phylogeny reconstruction method with Poisson correction analysis and bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000
replicates [29]. Omega values [ratio of non-synonymous
(KA) to Synonymous (KS) substitution rates] was calcu-

antigen control and a negative serum control were
included in every procedure.

ELISA
The sera were tested using a commercial ELISA kit (Idexx
Lab, USA) at a 1:100 dilution and the results were
expressed as S/N ratios (sample to negative ratio) according to manufacturer's instructions. Optical density value
was read at 650 nm wave length on an ELX 800™ microplate reader (BIO-TEK Instruments, USA). The ELISA antibody titer has 78% correlation to virus neutralization
titers [19].

Chicken hyperimmune serum production
The hyperimmune serum production was carried out in
four 60 weeks old SPF broiler breeder roosters obtained
from VRI, Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, with the following
immunization protocol: Briefly, at day 0, prior to inoculation, blood samples were collected from all chickens to
test their freedom from CAV antibody. Then the roosters
were immunized orally with 2 ml of live CAV vaccine
AviPro®THYMOVAC (Lohmann Animal Health, Cuxhaven, Germany). The immunization regimen was
repeated at 14, 28, and 42 days after the first immunization in combination with Freund adjuvant (Sigma, USA).
At day 56, blood was withdrawn from all the chickens
from the wing vein to separate the hyperimmune serum
produced. Commercial Idexx ELISA kit (Idexx Lab, Westbrook, Maine, USA) was used to evaluate the antibody
titer of the chicken hyperimmune serum at different levels
of immunization.

Experimental infection of chicks with CAV
Eight 5 days old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks were
obtained from Veterinary Research Institute (VRI), Ipoh,
Perak, Malaysia. The chicks were divided into 2 groups.
Group 1 (n = 5) was inoculated intramuscularly with 1 ml
of SMSC-1 CAV isolate cell culture inoculum containing
105.5 TCID50/ml [13]. Group II (n = 3) was left uninoculated as negative control chicks. Each group was reared
separately in different room and the chicks were observed
daily, and feed and water were provided ad libitum. The
chicks were sacrificed at 14 days p.i. (post inoculation) for
collection of organs. Tissue samples collected from
infected and uninoculated chicks were processed and considered as positive and negative control slides for immunoperoxidase
staining
(IPS),
respectively.
All
experimental research carried out on animals in this paper
(including chicken hyperimmune serum production) followed internationally recognized guidelines and
approved by animal care and use committee at the Faculty
of Veterinary Medicine in University Putra Malaysia (Ref:
UPM/FPV/PS/3.2.1.1551/AUP-R4).
Specimen preparation for immunohistochemical staining
Tissue samples were fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral phosphate-buffered formalin for about 24 hrs and were then
trimmed to the thickness of 0.5 cm. The bone marrow
samples were decalcified by 5% nitric acid solution following the procedure of Luna [31]. Following tissue
processing, tissue blocks were sectioned at a thickness of 4
μm and collected on clean silanized microscope slides
[32,33].
Immunohistochemical staining
Prior to staining, the tissue slides were deparaffinized to
remove embedding media and rehydrated following the
supplied instructions. Antigen retrieval was achieved
using the microwave-based antigen retrieval technique
[33,34]. The staining procedure of the detection system
was carried out following the manufacturer's instruction
manual [DakoCytomation Envision®+ Dual Link SystemHRP (DAB+), Denmark]. A known negative and positive

IgY purification from chicken hyperimmune serum
IgY purification was carried out using Pierce® Thiophilic
Adsorption Kit (Pierce, USA). The T-gel was initially used
according to the manufacturer's instruction for mammalian immunoglobulin purification. For the purification of
IgY from chicken serum, the manufacturer's instruction
was followed together with optimized protocol of T-gel
chromatography for the purification of IgY from chicken
sera as described by Constantinoiu et al. [35].
Statistical methods
Data from the distribution of CAV DNA in organ samples
from commercial broiler breeder chickens were analyzed
by Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA with significance
defined at P < 0.05. Groups with significance difference in
means from the rest were determined using Q-statistics
[36].

Competing interests
The isolated Malaysian CAV isolates are currently been
modified for development of live attenuated vaccines for
poultry.
