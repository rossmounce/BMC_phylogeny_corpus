The aconitate hydratase family from Citrus
Javier Terol, Guillermo Soler, Manuel Talon, Manuel Cercos*

Abstract
Background: Research on citrus fruit ripening has received considerable attention because of the importance of
citrus fruits for the human diet. Organic acids are among the main determinants of taste and organoleptic quality
of fruits and hence the control of fruit acidity loss has a strong economical relevance. In citrus, organic acids
accumulate in the juice sac cells of developing fruits and are catabolized thereafter during ripening. Aconitase, that
transforms citrate to isocitrate, is the first step of citric acid catabolism and a major component of the citrate
utilization machinery. In this work, the citrus aconitase gene family was first characterized and a phylogenetic
analysis was then carried out in order to understand the evolutionary history of this family in plants. Gene
expression analyses of the citrus aconitase family were subsequently performed in several acidic and acidless
genotypes to elucidate their involvement in acid homeostasis.
Results: Analysis of 460,000 citrus ESTs, followed by sequencing of complete cDNA clones, identified in citrus 3
transcription units coding for putatively active aconitate hydratase proteins, named as CcAco1, CcAco2 and CcAco3.
A phylogenetic study carried on the Aco family in 14 plant species, shows the presence of 5 Aco subfamilies, and
that the ancestor of monocot and dicot species shared at least one Aco gene. Real-time RT-PCR expression
analyses of the three aconitase citrus genes were performed in pulp tissues along fruit development in acidic and
acidless citrus varieties such as mandarins, oranges and lemons. While CcAco3 expression was always low, CcAco1
and CcAco2 genes were generally induced during the rapid phase of fruit growth along with the maximum in
acidity and the beginning of the acid reduction. Two exceptions to this general pattern were found: 1) Clemenules
mandarin failed inducing CcAco2 although acid levels were rapidly reduced; and 2) the acidless “Sucreña” orange
showed unusually high levels of expression of both aconitases, an observation correlating with the acidless
phenotype. However, in the acidless “Dulce” lemon aconitase expression was normal suggesting that the acidless
trait in this variety is not dependent upon aconitases.
Conclusions: Phylogenetic studies showed the occurrence of five different subfamilies of aconitate hydratase in
plants and sequence analyses indentified three active genes in citrus. The pattern of expression of two of these
genes, CcAco1 and CcAco2, was normally associated with the timing of acid content reduction in most genotypes.
Two exceptions to this general observation suggest the occurrence of additional regulatory steps of citrate
homeostasis in citrus.

Background
Citrus is one of the most important fruit crops in the
world with a total production of 122 million tons in
2008 [1]. Citrus fruits are hesperidium berries with a
very special organization composed of two morphologically distinct regions: the pericarp (peel) and the endocarp (pulp), which is the edible portion of the fruit and
consists of segments, the ovarian locules, containing the
juice vesicles. Growth and development of citrus fruit

follows a sigmoid curve divided into three stages [2].
After an initial two months interval of slow growth
mostly due to cell division (phase I), most of the fruit
growth results from cell enlargement and water accumulation during the next 4 to 6 months (phase II).
Finally, during phase III, growth is mostly arrested and
fruits undergo a non-climacteric ripening process.
Research on citrus fruit ripening has received considerable attention because of both the uniqueness of this
physiological process and the importance of citrus fruits
for the human diet as a supply of ascorbic acid, fibre

and several phytochemicals with contrasted benefits for
health [3].
Although color break, the pivotal metabolic event
characterizing external ripening, takes place during
phase III [4,5]; internal quality traits are acquired along
both phases II and III [6]. During the first half of phase
II, citrus fruits accumulate a considerable amount of
organic acids in the vacuoles of the juice sac cells and
these acids are progressively catabolized during the second half of phases II and III [7]. The physiological roles
of organic acids in fruit cells are not fully understood,
although it has been suggested that low pH could result
in an enhanced sink strength, increasing carbohydrate
uptake [8]. The characteristic decline in titrable acidity
shown by many citrus fruits is due to the utilization of
citric acid, the most abundant organic acid in citrus
juice [9].
Mature citrus pulp contains a high percentage of
water and many other different constituents, including
acids and sugars among other determinants of taste and
organoleptic quality [10]. Thus, the control of fruit acidity loss has a strong economical relevance since it is
related to the consumer perception and hence constitutes a main constraint for the citrus industry. Recent
advances in this field resulted in the identification of the
main metabolic processes involved in citrate utilization
[7,11,12] including a tonoplast citrate/H + symporter
potentially involved in citrate efflux from the vacuole
[13]. According to the current hypothesis, indirectly
supported by proteomic data [14], citrate is released
from the vacuole into the cytosol and then sequentially
isomerized into isocitrate by cytosolic aconitase and
then metabolized into 2-oxoglutarate by NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase. The utilization of 2-oxoglutarate
involves transamination into glutamate and then either
conversion into glutamine and further utilization for
thiamine biosynthesis, or conversion into succinate
through the gamma-aminobutirate shunt, eventually
leading to carbohydrate synthesis. Alternatively, citrate
may be converted to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA in a
reaction catalyzed by ATP citrate lyase. However, since
a decrease in ATP citrate lyase mRNA level during
citrus fruit ripening has been reported [7] all steps
involved in citrate utilization are initially dependent on
its isomerization into isocitrate, the step controlled by
aconitase.
Aconitase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of
citrate to isocitrate via the intermediate product cisaconitate. Two isoforms of aconitase have been detected
in all eukaryotic cells: mitochondrial aconitase that is
involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and cytosolic
aconitase that participates in several processes, such as
cytosolic citrate metabolism [7,11,12] and the glyoxylate
cycle [15,16]. It is also worth mentioning that aconitases

Page 2 of 12

are multifunctional proteins. In addition to the enzymatic activity, it has been shown, for instance, that the
yeast mitochondrial aconitase is a component of the
mitochondrial nucleoid and interacts with mitochondrial
DNA [17], while the cytosolic aconitase has RNA binding activity related to iron homeostasis in animals and
to resistance to oxidative stress in both animals and
plants [18,19].
The aconitate hydratase family has been only
described in detail in Arabidopsis [19,20]. However, the
large number of vegetal genomes sequenced to completion in the last years allows performing extensive phylogenetic analysis in these species. Besides the ones from
Arabidopsis, rice [21], poplar [22] and vitis [23], released
several years ago, the genome sequences from many
other plants are now available, and only during 2009
and the beginning of 2010 the genomes of corn [24],
sorghum [25], soybean [26] and false purplebrome [27]
have been completely sequenced. In this work, we have
first characterized the aconitase gene family of citrus
and performed, taking advantage of the availability of
complete genome sequences, a phylogenetic analysis of
the aconitate hydratase family in 14 species, which
allowed an unprecedented view of the evolutionary history of this family in plants. In addition, the role of the
citrus aconitase genes in the acid homeostasis has been
investigated studying their expression in several acidic
and acidless citrus genotypes.

Results and discussion
Molecular characterization of the Citrus aconitate
hydratase genes

In order to identify cDNAs coding for ACO proteins, a
BLASTX search was performed against 465,094 citrus
ESTs available at the GenBank, using the Arabidopsis
thaliana ACO proteins as queries. 179 ESTs produced
significant similarity with the Arabidopsis ACO proteins,
using an e value cut off of 1e-15. Assembly of the reads
with GAP4 resulted in all the ESTs but one clustering
into 3 contigs. The only singleton corresponded to a
putative immature mRNA with an intron that prevented
its assembly. The fact that all the ESTs clustered into 3
unigenes strongly supports that the aconitate hydratase
family from citrus is composed, at least, of three transcription units. Three genes have been also reported in
A. thaliana, the only plant species in which this family
has been described in detail [19,20].
One cDNA clone representing each transcription unit
was selected from a normalized full length library constructed from a variety of tissues and organs at different
developmental stages and subjected to different abiotic
stresses [28]. Clones IC0AAA40BB02RM1, IC0AAA5BE08RM1, and IC0AAA7DC07RM1 were sequenced to
completion with a primer walk strategy, resulting in 3

sequences of 3218, 3331, and 3433 bp respectively, that
were submitted to GenBank (Acc# FN552254,
FN552255, and FN552256). Conceptual translation of
the cDNA sequences showed that clones IC0AAA
40BB02RM1, IC0AAA7DC07RM1, and IC0AAA5
BE08RM1 contained ORFs coding for proteins of 900,
898, and 898 aa, respectively, named Aco1, Aco2 and
Aco3 genes, based on their similarity with the Arabidopsis ones (see Table 1 for details). An aconitate hydratase
gene from Citrus limon that was previously reported
[GenBank:AF073507] was 99% identical to Aco3 from
C. clementina.
A multiple alignment of the Arabidopsis and Clementine proteins with ClustalX exhibited a high degree of
conservation between the six proteins, with 627 identical
residues, and 142 conservative changes, representing an
overall similarity higher than 85%. Analysis of the citrus
predicted proteins with PFAM [29] showed conservation
of the catalytic and the swivel domains [20], suggesting
that the citrus proteins are able to catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and citrate via a cis-aconitate intermediate (Figure 1).
Phylogenetic analysis of the aconitate hydratase family in
plants

In order to study the evolutionary history of the aconitate hydratase family in plants, the complete genome
sequences of the dicot species Populus trichocarpa [22],
Vitis vinifera [23], Carica papaya [30], Ricinus communis [31], Medicago truncatula [32], and Glycine max
[26]; the monocot species Oryza sativa [21], Zea mays
[24], Sorghum bicolor [25], and in Brachypodium distachyon [27], and the moss Physcomitrella patens [33]
were searched for Aco genes. The BLASTX search identified 3 Aco genes in all but 3 species, which is in agreement with the results from Arabidopsis and citrus.
Soybean and poplar displayed 6 and 4 Aco genes,
respectively, while only 2 transcription units were discovered in purple false brome. Table 2 shows the Aco
ORFs obtained, indicating the species and their accession numbers.
A multiple alignment with 48 Aco sequences was carried out, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed as

described in Methods. The tree obtained (Figure 2)
shows six main clusters that include all but one Aco
ORFs. As expected, sequences from P. patens group in a
single cluster with the largest genetic distances respect
to the other sequences, which reflects the evolutionary
distance between Bryophyta and Angiosperm taxa. All
the remaining sequences but Sbi_02g034590, group into
5 clusters, that have been named Aco1, Aco2, Aco3,
Aco4, and Aco5, based on the Arabidopsis naming
system.
Sequence Sbi_02g034590 from sorghum, annotated as
a member of the aconitate hydratase family in the
BLAST searches, is not included in the previous clusters. Genetic distances with respect to the other
sequences are also in the same range than the ones
obtained for P. patens suggesting that it should not be
considered as part of this family.
Aco1 cluster is composed of sequences from both
mono and dicot species, indicating that their ancestor
was present in plants previously to the split of mono
and dicotyledonous groups. Subclusters Aco2 and Aco3
only gather genes from dicot species, while Aco4-Aco5
clades are formed only by monocot ones. This fact suggests that these clusters appeared after the monocot and
dicot split, and have diverged to give rise to new subfamilies. It is noteworthy that all the dicot species, except
poplar and soybean, display 3 Aco genes, that are distributed into the Aco1, Aco2 and Aco3 clusters. The
organization of the monocot subclusters was found to
be similar. Analogous evolutionary patterns with
sequences from mono and dicot species distributed
among mono and polyphyletic clades have been also
found for the polygalacturonase [34], lignin biosynthesis
[35], or DOF [36] gene families.
The Aco family in poplar and soybean displays a different organization since both genomes lack Aco3
homologs, and their genes group in Aco1 and Aco2
clusters with very small genetic distances between them,
suggesting the occurrence of recent duplication events.
In fact, XM_002301587 and XM_002321090 are located
on homologous genome blocks from chromosomes II
and XIV, produced in a salicoid-specific genome-wide
duplication event described in poplar that is still detectable over approximately 92% of the poplar genome [22].
The salicoid duplication has been also related to the fact
that Populus has the largest number of major intrinsic
proteins (MIPs) identified in any single plant species
[37], with the duplication of several cinnamyl alcohol
dehydrogenase (CAD) genes [38], or with the fact that
the neutral invertases (NIs) gene family has 9 members
in the Arabidopsis genome, 8 in rice, 9 in vitis, while 16
in poplar [39]. Similarly, the 6 Aco genes found in soybean might be originated by succeeding whole-genome
duplications, one of them legume specific 13 MYA ago,

and by an extraordinary level of gene retention occurred
in this species, resulting in 75% of the soybean genes
present as multiple copies [26].
In order to find how many of the predicted ORFs
were transcriptionally active, a BLAST search against
the GenBank EST database was performed with the species analyzed in the phylogenetic study. For each species, the predicted ORFs and the ESTs producing
significant scores were assembled with GAP4 (see Methods), which resulted in contigs containing the ORF
sequences and all the ESTs associated with each
hypothetical gene (Table 2). Considering the large number of analyzed ESTs in several species (1.5 MM in Arabidopsis, 1.2 MM in rice, 260.000 in Medicago, etc), the
difference in the number of ESTs found between the
Aco genes may reflect the different expression levels of
the genes in them.
It is noteworthy that in poplar, with more than
426.000 ESTs analyzed, only one predicted gene per
cluster, XM_002327692 (27 ESTs) and XM_002301587
(33 ESTs), show significant levels of expression, while
their pairs (XM_002331719, and XM_002321090) only
show none and 2 associated ESTs. Chaudhary et al.
(2009) described a similar expression asymmetry in the
analysis of the carotenoid biosynthesis genes in rice,
Arabidopsis and poplar [40]. The analysis of the polygalacturonase gene family in Arabidopsis and rice also
showed that tandem duplicated regions had one relatively highly expressed gene while the rest had either
low or no expression levels [34], Finally, unequal expression of homologous neutral invertase genes was
observed by quantitative RT-PCR in vitis [39]. These
changes in the level of expression of duplicated genes

have been related with neofunctionalization after gene
duplications [41].
Expression of aconitase genes

To understand the physiological roles of CcAco1,
CcAco2 and CcAco3 genes and their involvement in the
control of fruit acidity levels, their expression in pulp
tissues was determined by real-time RT-PCR along fruit
development in selected varieties of mandarins, oranges
and lemons. Total acidity was also determined in juice
extracts to correlate fruit acidity with aconitase gene
expression. In mandarins, analyses were performed on
two varieties differing in fruit acidity: Clemenules
(Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan. cv. Clemenules) and
Fortune (Citrus clementina Hort. ex. Tan. x Citrus reticulata Blanco). Three varieties of sweet orange (Citrus
sinensis L. Osb.) were also used: an acidless orange (cv.
Sucreña) and two normal acidic ones (cv. Comuna and
cv. Valencia Late). The two lemon varieties (Citrus
limon L. Burm.) studied were cv. Dulce, that is an acidless lemon and cv. Fino that shows normal acidity levels.
In Clemenules mandarin, total acidity was low during
phase I of fruit development (cell division stage), started
to increase at the beginning of phase II (cell enlargement stage), reached the maximum levels around 140
days post anthesis and decreased thereafter during the
second half of phase II and during phase III (ripening
stage). Fortune mandarin acidity showed a similar profile, although acid content was significantly higher at the
acidity peak (69.03 ± 4.53 mg/ml in Fortune versus
36.95 ± 1.40 mg/ml in Clemenules) and remained higher
during the second half of phase II and in mature fruit
(Figure 3A), when acid content was 7.74 ± 0.89 mg/ml

in Clemenules fruits and 27.20 ± 2.54 mg/ml in Fortune
fruits. Similarly, acidity in Comuna and Valencia Late
orange varieties also showed a peak in the middle of
phase II at 116 DPA, with acidity levels of 49.07 ± 2.13
mg/ml and 55.47 ± 2.13 mg/ml respectively (Figure 3B).
Total acidity was extremely low in the acidless Sucreña
orange and acidity at 116 DPA was 1.06 ± 0.05 mg/ml.
In cultivar Fino, a normal acidity lemon, acid content
also increased during the second half of phase II reaching levels much higher than that of mandarin and

orange varieties (for example 85.37 ± 1.18 mg/ml at 174
DPA, Figure 3C). As above, in acidless Dulce lemon, no
acidity increase was observed and acid levels remained
low and slightly higher than those of Sucreña orange
(4.61 ± 0.67 mg/ml at 116 DPA).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses (Figure 4)
allowed transcript detection for CcAco1, CcAco2 and
CcAco3 indicating that these sequences correspond to
functional aconitase genes. CcAco3 was constitutively
expressed although at low levels along all phases of fruit

development in all citrus varieties used for this study
(Figure 4C, F, I). Thus, this expression pattern suggests
that CcAco3 would not be deeply involved in the acidity
reduction process taking place in the cytosol during

Page 7 of 12

pulp ripening and that the CcAco3 protein might have a
mitochondrial localization and therefore be involved in
the tricarboxylic acid cycle taking place in the mitochondrial matrix. However, cytosolic and mitochondrial
compartimentalizations are not mutually exclusive since
evidences for the simultaneous localization of plant and
yeast aconitase proteins in cytosol and mitochondria
have been reported [42].
In general, increase of CcAco1 and CcAco2 gene
expression started during the first middle part of phase
II (Figure 4A, B). Thus, induction of these genes was
coincident or slightly preceded the acidity peak while
expression was high at the beginning and during the
reduction in acid level. This suggests that CcAco1 and
CcAco2 proteins are presumably related to the cytosolic
aconitase activity metabolizing the citrate released from
the vacuole during ripening [7,11]. Interestingly, Clemenules fruits did not show CcAco2 induction, an observation suggesting a possible mutation in the regulatory
regions of this gene, since no alteration was detected in
the coding sequence (data not shown). In spite of the
lack of CcAco2 induction in Clemenules, acidity and
CcAco1 and CcAco2 mRNA levels in Fortune were still
higher than those in Clemenules. Thus, differences in
citric acid content between these two varieties may be
related to additional regulatory steps such as the activity
of the membrane transporters mediating citrate efflux
from the vacuole during ripening [13]. Although the
mechanisms controlling citrate vacuolar compartmentalization in citrus are not fully understood, several regulatory points have been proposed for the transport of
citrate anions across the tonoplast, including a thermodynamically favoured transport through rectifying anion
channels [13] and an active ATP-driven transport
mechanism [43]. In addition, Shimada et al [13] isolated
a novel citrate-H+ symporter induced during fruit acidity
decrease in Washington Navel. The elucidation of the
mechanisms involved in the control of vacuolar citrate
compartmentalization may thus help to understand the
differences in acidity found between these mandarin
varieties.
The highest mRNA levels of CcAco1 and CcAco2
genes were found in the pulp of acidless Sucreña orange
and these levels were already high at the onset of phase
II, when the expression of these genes was still arrested
in normal acidity oranges (Comuna and Valencia Late)
mandarins and lemons. The overexpression of these
genes when citric acid is being produced in the mitochondrial matrix, released to the cytosol and exported
to the vacuole may be responsible for the acidless phenotype of the variety, since a higher aconitase activity
would degrade citric acid, avoiding its vacuolar
accumulation.

Figure 4 Aconitase expression during fruit development. Expression profiles of citrus aconitase genes CCAco1 (A, D, G), CcAco2 (B, E, H) and
CCAco3 (C, F, I), during development of fruit flesh from selected varieties of mandarins (A, B, C), oranges (D, E, F) and lemons (G, H, I). Gene
expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR. An expression value of 1 was arbitrarily assigned to the mRNA level of each gene in the
Clemenules 27 DPA sample. Mean ratios of expression ± SE are presented. Clemenules expression profiles (dotted lines) are included in panels D,
E, F, G, H and I as reference.

The comparison of Dulce, an acidless lemon variety
with Fino, a normal acidity lemon, showed no significant
differences in the expression of the putative cytosolic
aconitase genes. This suggests that different mechanisms
are responsible for the phenotypes of orange (Sucreña)
and lemon (Dulce). Furthermore, in limes, a derived species from lemon, an explanation involving additional
players has been previously proposed for the acidless trait
of sweet lime [44]. Sadka et al. [11] reported that during
the initial stages of fruit development a partial inhibition
of the enzymatic activity of lemon mitochondrial aconitase allowed the production of high amounts of citric
acid in the mitochondria during the initial stages of fruit

development. This activity decrease was correlated with a
previously reported increase in citramalate, a competitive
inhibitor of aconitase activity [44] In acidless sweet lime,
citramalate level was lower [44], suggesting that the acidless phenotype of this variety mostly related to citric acid
production instead of citric acid removal. This possibility
is compatible with the observation that in acidless Dulce
lemon, expression of the genes involved in citrate
removal was normal (Figure 4 G, H) and expression of
one aconitase gene observed at 79 and specially at 116
DPA (Figure 4I) was slightly increased.
An additional finding of this work is that despite the
strong accumulation of citric acid in lemons (Figure

Terol et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:222
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/222

3C), CcAco2 aconitase mRNA levels were similar to
those found in oranges and mandarins (Figure 4G, H).
This suggests that citric acid in ripening lemon fruit
may not be accessible to the aconitase proteins and
reinforces the above idea that regulatory differences in
the citrus tonoplast transporters may be relevant to
understand the diversity of patterns of citric accumulation and homeostasis in the several citrus fruits.

Conclusions
Phylogenetic studies showed the occurrence of five different subfamilies of aconitate hydratase genes in plants
that derived from one common ancestor of mono and
dicots. The analysis of the sequence of the aconitase
family in citrus showed that it is composed of three
active genes. The pattern of expression of two of these
genes, CcAco1 and CcAco2, was normally associated
with the timing of citrate reduction in most genotypes
including mandarins, oranges and lemons. In addition,
two exceptions to this general observation suggest the
occurrence of additional regulatory steps of citrate
homeostasis in citrus.
Methods
Plant material

Parthenocarpic citrus fruits were harvested from adult
trees grown in the field under normal cultural practices.
The following acidic and acidless varieties and species
were used: Clementina mandarin (Citrus clementina
Hort. ex Tan.; cv. Clemenules), Fortune mandarin
(Citrus clementina Hort. ex. Tan. x Citrus reticulata
Blanco), three sweet orange varieties (Citrus sinensis L.
Osb.; cv. Comuna, cv. Sucreña and cv. Valencia Late)
and two lemon varieties, (Citrus limon L. Burm.; cv.
Fino and cv. Dulce). Sucreña orange and Dulce lemon
are characterized by a very low level of acid contain and
therefore are defined as acidless varieties. Fruits were
selected by uniformity of size and appearance, and
absence of abiotic and biotic stress symptoms. Homogeneous fruits were peeled and flavedo (exocarp) and
albedo (mesocarp) discarded. The remaining tissue,
mainly consisting of juice vesicles (endocarp), the segments with their membranes and the vascular bundles,
was frozen under liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C
until used.
Two samples of Clemenules were taken during phase I
(cell division stage) on May 27, at 27 days post anthesis
(DPA), and June 24, at 55 DPA. Five samples were harvested during phase II (cell expansion stage), two before
total acidity peak (July 28, 89 DPA, and August 21, 113
DPA), one at maximum acidity (September 17, 140
DPA) and two after the peak of maximum acidity
(October 23, 176 DPA and November 26, 210 DPA).
The last sample was harvested during phase III

Page 9 of 12

(ripening) at the fully ripe stage (December 29, 243
DPA), when acidity content was again low. Samples of
Fortune mandarin were harvested at the same times.
Fruits of the sweet orange varieties Comuna, Sucreña
and Valencia Late, and from the two lemon varieties,
Fino and Dulce were harvested during phase II, around
the maximum acidity peak of Clemenules, at 79, 116
and 174 DPA. To exclude differences in gene expression
due to environmental factors, two sets of samples were
taken during the years 2005 and 2008. The data
reported here were obtained with the 2005 samples, and
similar expression patterns were observed with the 2008
samples (data not shown).
cDNA Sequencing

Plasmid DNA was extracted from liquid culture (LB
plus Amp) with the FastPlasmid Mini Kit (Eppendorf),
following manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA clones
were sequenced to completion by primer walk using the
primers shown in additional file 1 Table S1. Sequencing
reactions were performed utilizing the ABI Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequence Ready Reaction as described by
manufacturer in an ABI 3730 automatic sequencer.
Reads were assembled with the software GAP4 from the
Staden package [45], and a consensus sequence was
obtained for each transcription unit.
Phylogenetic analysis

The BLASTX tool was used to discover Aco genes in
Populus trichocarpa [22], Vitis vinifera [23], Carica
papaya [30], Ricinus communis [31], Medicago truncatula [32], Glycine max [26], Oryza sativa [21], Zea mays
[24], Sorghum bicolor [25], and Brachypodium distachyon [27]. The moss Physcomitrella patens [33], was also
analyzed as a representative of more primitive taxonomic groups. Additionally, the ORFs of the plant aconitate hydratase proteins from Citrus limon [Genbank:
AF073507], Cucurbita sp [GenBank:D29629], Lycopersicon pennelli [GenBank:AY250115], Nicotiana tabacum
[GenBank:AF194945], and Prunus avium [Genbank:
AY050485], previously described and available at GenBank, were also included in this study.
Although the genome sequence of papaya has been
published [30], only DNA sequences produced by the
whole genome shotgun (WGS) are accessible at the
GenBank. In order to obtain the aconitate hydratase
genes from papaya, a BLASTX search was performed
against the WGS scaffolds available at the public database. Three scaffolds yielding significant homology were
obtained, and ORF prediction was performed with GeneScan [46], followed by manual curation. The 3 ORFs
obtained were named Aco1, Aco2 and Aco3 based on
their similarity with Arabidopsis, and were also included
in the phylogenetic analysis.

Primer sequence

A multiple alignment with the 48 predicted Aco ORFs
was carried out with Clustal_X [47]. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [48]. Genetic distances
were calculated with the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [49] and all positions containing alignment
gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise
sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion option). There
were a total of 3.595 positions in the final dataset. The
phylogenetic tree was constructed with the NeighborJoining method [50]. The percentage of replicate trees in
which the associated taxa clustered together was calculated with the bootstrap test with 1000 replicates [51].
Similar analyses were performed with the Minimum Evolution [52] and Maximum Likelihood methods [53], and
the trees obtained confirmed the clustering obtained with
the Neighbor-Joining method (data not shown).
BLASTN [54] search tool was used to identify ESTs
associated with the Aco ORFs against the EST section of
the GenBank [55]. For each species, the ESTs obtained
were assembled with the ORF sequences using GAP4
from the Staden package [45], which allowed counting of
the number of identical ESTs associated with an ORF.
Fruit acidity determination

Fruit acidity was determined by titration of 5 ml of fresh
juice extract with 0.1 M NaOH, using phenolphtalein as
indicator. Total acidity was used as an indirect measurement of citric acid concentration, the dominant acidic
compound in Citrus fruit juice and major responsible of
fruit acidity [9].
RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue using the
RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with
RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. UV light absorption spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed
to test RNA quality as described by Sambrook et al. [56]
and RNA concentration was accurately determined by a
fluorometric assay with the RiboGreen dye (Molecular
Probes) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed with a LightCycler 2.0 Instrument (Roche) equipped with
LightCycler Software version 4.0 as described by [7].

Amplicon position
2692-2852
2671-2771
2719-2834

One-step RT-PCR was carried out with 25 ng total RNA
adding 2.5 units of MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase
(Applied Biosystems), 1 unit RNase inhibitor (Applied
Biosystems), 2 μl of LC FastStart DNA MasterPLUS
SYBR Green I (Roche) and 2.5 pmol of each oligonucleotide in a total volume of 10 μl. Incubations were
carried out at 48°C for 30 min, 95°C for 10 min followed
by 40 cycles at 95°C for 20 s, annealing temperature (55°
C for CcAco1 and CcAco3 and 58°C for CcAco2) for 10 s
and 72°C for 15 s. Fluorescent intensity data were
acquired during the 72°C extension step. Gene-specific
primers (Table 3) were designed using the Primer
Express software (Applied Biosystems). Specificity of the
amplification reactions was assessed by postamplification
dissociation curves and by sequencing the reaction products. To transform fluorescent intensity measurements
into relative mRNA levels, a 10-fold dilution series of a
RNA sample was used as standard curve. Reproducible
data were obtained after normalization to total RNA
amounts [57] since previous work in our lab indicated
that other normalization methods rendered irreproducible results [4]. For proper comparison, data were
re-scaled so that an induction value of 1-fold was arbitrarily assigned to the 27 DPA Clemenules sample. Each
sample was analyzed in triplicate and mean ratios ±
standard errors were calculated.
