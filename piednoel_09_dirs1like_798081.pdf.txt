Abstract
Background: Transposable elements are major constituents of eukaryote genomes and have a
great impact on genome structure and stability. Considering their mutational abilities, TEs can
contribute to the genetic diversity and evolution of organisms. Knowledge of their distribution
among several genomes is an essential condition to study their dynamics and to better understand
their role in species evolution. DIRS1-like retrotransposons are a particular group of
retrotransposons according to their mode of transposition that implies a tyrosine recombinase. To
date, they have been described in a restricted number of species in comparison with the LTR
retrotransposons. In this paper, we determine the distribution of DIRS1-like elements among 25
decapod species, 10 of them living in hydrothermal vents that correspond to particularly unstable
environments.
Results: Using PCR approaches, we have identified 15 new DIRS1-like families in 15 diverse
decapod species (shrimps, lobsters, crabs and galatheid crabs). Hydrothermal organisms show a
particularly great diversity of DIRS1-like elements with 5 families characterized among
Alvinocarididae shrimps and 3 in the galatheid crab Munidopsis recta. Phylogenic analyses show that
these elements are divergent toward the DIRS1-like families previously described in other
crustaceans and arthropods and form a new clade called AlDIRS1. At larger scale, the distribution
of DIRS1-like retrotransposons appears more or less patchy depending on the taxa considered.
Indeed, a scattered distribution can be observed in the infraorder Brachyura whereas all the species
tested in infraorders Caridea and Astacidea harbor some DIRS1-like elements.
Conclusion: Our results lead to nearly double both the number of DIRS1-like elements described
to date, and the number of species known to harbor these ones. In this study, we provide the first
degenerate primers designed to look specifically for DIRS1-like retrotransposons. They allowed for
revealing for the first time a widespread distribution of these elements among a large phylum, here
the order Decapoda. They also suggest some peculiar features of these retrotransposons in
hydrothermal organisms where a great diversity of elements is already observed. Finally, this paper
constitutes the first essential step which allows for considering further studies based on the
dynamics of the DIRS1-like retrotransposons among several genomes.

Background
Deep-sea vents are chemosynthetic environments which
are considered as extreme as compared to usual life standards due to their physico-chemical characteristics. For
instance, they show high levels of temperature, pressure,
heavy metals and sulfide [1]. They are also highly variable,
with physico-chemical shifts occurring over very short
spatial and temporal scales [2]. Although other marine
environments (e.g., the intertidal zone) are also variable,
hydrothermal environments are particularly unstable due
to (i) the intensity of variations observed in deep-sea
vents, e.g., variation of temperature from 400 to 2°C over
few centimeters [3], (ii) local random mix of vent fluids
with surrounding waters [4] and (iii) the relatively short
lifetime of vents [5]. Because such unstable environment
may be difficult to live in, deep-sea vents are often considered as harsh and stressful. For example, the vent shrimps
Rimicaris exoculata, which usually live between 15°C and
30°C, endure sudden changes of thermal conditions due
to the convection of fluids and can survive to exposure to
very high temperature vent emissions [6,7].
In terms of biome characteristics, hydrothermal ecosystems are also peculiar, as they show a much higher density
of individuals compared with surrounding abyssal plains.
For example, populations of R. exoculata can reach up to
2500 individuals per square meter [8]. On the other hand,
in comparison with coastal environments, hydrothermal
vents are associated to a small number of species [9,10]
(less than 600 species described to date in [11]). These
features, along with the variable nature of the hydrothermal environment, suggest that deep-sea vent organisms
may present particular genetic characteristics in relation to
their peculiar adaptive abilities. Studying transposable
elements (TEs) constitute an interesting way to investigate
the genomic bases of such adaptive capacities. Several
studies have shown that environmental variations can
promote genome plasticity through transcriptional activation and mobilization of TEs (especially retrotransposons), often in response to specific stimuli such as
biotic stress (e.g., pathogens) and abiotic environmental
changes (e.g., temperature) [12-15]. For these reasons, TEs
have a large impact on genome structure and stability,
contribute in particular to variations in genome size [1619], and are therefore considered as one of the major
sources of genetic variability in eukaryotes [20-24]. The
order Decapoda is a great model to investigate the
genomic nature of the adaptation of hydrothermal organisms and its possible relationship with TEs. First, decapod
crustaceans (shrimps, lobsters, crabs, ...) are found in various environments, with about 50 species described in
hydrothermal vents [11]. Second, they exhibit great variation in genome size, from 1.07 pg (1050 Mb) in the crab
Carcinus maenas to 40.89 pg (40000 Mb) in the shrimp
Sclerocrangon ferox [25,26], with several species (e.g.,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/86

shrimps) showing particularly large genomes that are thus
liable to harbor high TE contents. Given their abundance
and diversity, decapods have been greatly underrepresented in studies of TEs with only few elements described
to date [27-35] including a LTR retrotransposon, GalEa1,
that we have recently characterized in the hydrothermal
galatheid squat lobster Munidopsis recta [36].
LTR retrotransposons (Ty1/copia-like, Ty3/gypsy-like and
Pao/Bel-like elements) and tyrosine recombinase encoding elements (DIRS-like, Ngaro, Viper) constitute two
major groups of retrotransposons [37-39], a class of TEs
specific to eukaryotes [40]. Several phylogenetic analyses
have shown that the pol region of DIRS-like elements harbor reverse transcriptase (RT) and RNase H (RH) domains
closely related to those of Ty3/gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons [41,42]. However, these elements differ fundamentally in structure from LTR retrotransposons as they
are devoid of LTR, do not encode either Proteinase and
Integrase and harbor a Methyltransferase domain (Fig. 1)
[39,41]. Moreover, DIRS-like retrotransposons replicate
through a particular mechanism that involves a tyrosine
recombinase [43]. Within the DIRS-like superfamily [38],
two distinct groups have been described: DIRS1-like and
PAT-like elements. These two groups differ by the nature
of their termini (inverted terminal and split direct repeats,
respectively [44]) and by phylogenic relationships [45].
In contrast to LTR retrotransposons that have been found
in a wide continuous range of species [39,46,47], DIRS1like elements have a more patchy distribution being yet
reported only in a restricted number of phylogenically
diverse eukaryote organisms (Table 1) [41,43,46,48-56].
Although most of the DIRS1-like retrotransposon identifications were based on in silico approaches [41,43], they
have not been yet described in several well-studied phylum (e.g., mammals or plants), and are absent from
model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisae and Drosophila melanogaster. Moreover, only few different DIRS1like families have been found per species [41] in contrast
to the large variety of LTR retrotransposon families
[38,57-59]. In the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum,
DIRS1-like retrotransposons have been shown to harbor
an active heat-shock promoter in their inverted terminal
repeats [60,61]. Considering the high level of thermal
instability in vents, the presence of such promoters could
favor TE activation in hydrothermal species.
Hence, studying DIRS1-like elements in Decapoda could
allow both to better understand the role of TEs in the
adaptation of species in hydrothermal ecosystems and to
investigate the dynamics of these peculiar elements. We
focused on ten hydrothermal decapods that represent the
three major infraorders observed (6 caridean shrimps, 3
brachyuran crabs and 1 anomuran galatheid crab). We

have detected DIRS1-like retrotransposons in all vent
shrimps and in M. recta as well as in 8 other non-vent
decapods. To our knowledge, this paper constitutes the
first study based on DIRS1-like element distribution both
in a continuous range of species within a single taxon and
in species living in various ecosystems. Fifteen new
DIRS1-like families are at all described among 15 out of
the 25 species tested. These unusual elements are thus surprisingly more widely distributed among decapods than
expected.

Results
Fishing out DIRS1-like pol sequences in hydrothermal
shrimps
In the course of looking for Ty3/gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons in three hydrothermal shrimps (Rimicaris exoculata, Chorocaris chacei and Mirocaris fortunata) using
degenerate primers GD1 and GD2 corresponding to the
"RMPFGL" and "LTTDAS" conserved motifs of the RT

domain (Fig. 1), we PCR-amplified additional fragments
in supplement of those that correspond to Ty3/gypsy-like
elements (data not shown). Cloning and sequencing of
these additional fragments revealed that they share high
sequence identity with the pol region of DIRS1-like elements at the protein level. Detailed sequence analysis
showed that the fragments observed originated from
either GD1/GD1 amplifications (sequences RexAlvi1a
from R. exoculata and CchAlvi1a from C. chacei, [GenBank:FJ707538-FJ707539]) or from GD1/GD2 amplification with annealing of degenerate primer GD2 at a non
targeted site (sequence MfoAlvi3a from M. fortunata, [GenBank:FJ707541]). Fishing out of DIRS1-like elements
using primers designed for Ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons
can be explained by the close phylogenic relationships
between RT domains of Ty3/gypsy-like and DIRS1-like elements [43]. Although the regions in which the primers
were designed are only partly conserved between Ty3/
gypsy-like and DIRS1-like elements, partial conservation
may be sufficient for them to anneal on DIRS1-like
sequences, particularly because primers are degenerate. To
further confirm the presence of DIRS1-like elements in
these species, we designed a pair of degenerate primers,
DD1 and DD2, to amplify the region comprised between
the "LGFLIN" and "DLFAS" motifs of the DIRS1-like elements pol region (Fig. 1). We tested these primers in R.
exoculata. Unfortunately, they did not allow for amplifying a single band, but rather led to the amplification of
numerous fragments (smear). After long and tedious optimization of the PCR conditions, we managed to obtain a
major amplicon of 870 bp, which we then cloned and
sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that it corresponds
actually to a DD2/DD2 amplification product, which
shares similarity with pol region of DIRS1-like elements
only in the last 532 bp (RexAlvi2a, [GenBank:FJ707540]).
Due to the technical difficulties to obtain specific amplicons, we did not use this primer pair for other analyses.
To get insights on the genetic diversity of the DIRS1-like
elements found, we aligned the partial sequences of the
pol region that we obtained. Alignment of the 4 sequences
allowed us to define 3 families. RexAlvi1a and CchAlvi1a
sharing 89% nucleotide sequence identity, they were clustered into a single family that we called Alvi1 (see Additional file 1). On the other hand, RexAlvi2a and MfoAlvi3a
shared too low sequence identity to either Alvi1 (< 53%
and < 50% sequence identity, respectively) or to each
other (71% sequence identity) to be clustered and were
therefore considered as members of different families that
we called Alvi2 and Alvi3.
Screening for Alvi elements in other decapods
To date, DIRS1-like retrotransposons have been identified
and characterized in only a restricted number of species
(Table 1). To better understand the evolutionary dynam-

ics of DIRS1-like elements, we investigated the diversity
and the distribution of the Alvi families among several
Decapoda crustacean genomes. We first analyzed the distribution of our 3 novel DIRS1-like families among several decapods, from both hydrothermal and non
hydrothermal ecosystems. For this, we screened for Alvi
families among the 25 decapods species using different
combinations of primers (Table 2) including specific
primers of each element and Retro1+, a primer shared by
all 3 elements (see Methods and Additional file 2).
Although pairs of specific primers would allow for amplification of closely related elements, we expected that the
association of Retro1+ with a single specific primer would
be particularly useful to extract more divergent sequences
from diverse species. Cloning and sequencing of PCR
products of expected size led to the identification of either
the targeted elements or other DIRS1-like elements that
belong to another family (Table 2). Sequence analysis of
all the DIRS1-like elements found revealed that some
were highly degenerate (i.e. they were highly divergent
and harbored a large number of gaps, which did not allow
for reconstructing a proper protein sequence). These elements were not included for the rest of the study (see
Additional file 3). Among the other sequences, some corresponded to copies of the Alvi1-3 families, whereas some
others could not be clustered to any existing families, and
were considered as members of 2 new families: Alvi4 (in
Alvinocaris stactophila) and Alvi5 (in Alvinocaris markensis).
We thus decided to include these 2 families in our analysis. However, specific primers could not be designed for

the Alvi5 family, because nucleotidic differences with the
other 4 families were too spread out on the sequences.
Hence, we finally analyzed the distribution of DIRS1-like
elements in decapods using 4 families: Alvi1-4.
Results, presented in Table 2, show that Alvi elements are
only detected in hydrothermal shrimps. Two families
(Alvi1 and Alvi2) are widely shared among these species
while the two others (Alvi3 and Alvi4) are restricted to the
species where they were firstly identified (M. fortunata and
A. stactophila, respectively). Alvi2 elements could not be
detected in M. fortunata. Using Alvi2 specific primers on
this species we were only able to identify non-targeted elements of the Alvi3 family (MfoAlvi3e and MfoAlvi3f, [GenBank:FJ707602–FJ707603]), even using a supplementary
primer (Alvi2_600-) more restrictive to Alvi2 family. Non
targeted elements were also obtained when we looked for
Alvi3 and Alvi4 elements (Table 2, Additional file 3), suggesting some specificity troubles especially due to the use
of a single specific primer.
For all other decapods, no Alvi element could be detected
even in other hydrothermal organisms or in the other
closely related caridean shrimps [62]Crangon crangon and
Palaemon serratus. In the hydrothermal galatheid crab
Munidopsis recta, although no PCR amplification fragment
of the expected size was obtained, we PCR-amplified an
additional fragment (545 bp) when using Retro1+.
Sequencing of this fragment revealed that it originated
from the Retro1+/Retro1+ amplification of a new DIRS1-

like sequence (Ymur1a, [GenBank:FJ707610]). It shared
low sequence identity to Alvi1-5 families (< 50%
sequence identity) and was therefore considered as member of a novel family that we called Ymur1.
Diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Alvi DIRS1-like
retrotransposons
Screening for Alvi elements among decapods led us to
obtain 36 partial sequences of the pol region (see Additional file 3). To gain power in our investigation of the
diversity of these elements, we completed these data with
additional sequences. Two complementary approaches
were performed: extension of the sequences by PCR walking and PCR amplification of larger internal sequences
using specific primers (see Methods and Additional file
4). Seventeen new sequences were thus obtained (see
Additional file 3), enabling to well-cover the pol region of
DIRS1-like elements at least from the "YLDD" RT motif to
the end of the RH domain (Fig. 1).

All DNA sequences obtained were aligned using ClustalX
program [63] and corresponding alignment was used to
analyze the relationships between families. First, we
checked the boundaries of the different families through
the construction of a sequence identity matrix using the
pairwise gap deletion method (see Additional file 1). A
group of sequences was considered as a family if its higher
intra-group divergence was lower than its inter-groups
divergence, without overlap of the two distributions. The
clustering obtained from sequence identity matrix validates the five families that we had previously defined
(Alvi1 to Alvi5, Fig. 2). Among them, the Alvi1 copies are
more diverse (from 63 to 95% sequence identity, mean:
76% sequence identity) than other families ones. The
Alvi1 family is also more divergent toward the four other
families (53% divergence in average between the Alvi1
copies and the others) whereas Alvi2-5 families appear to
be more closely related as copies from these families differ
one by one by only 35% of divergence in average.

Second, we analyzed the relationships of the sequences
among and between the 5 families using a Neighbor Joining phylogenic analysis with pairwise gap deletion. The
tree obtained (Fig. 3) confirmed that each Alvi family is
well-supported with bootstrap values being greater than
94%. It also confirmed that the Alvi1 family highly
diverges to the other 4 families, with strong bootstrap support (100%) of the separation into an Alvi2-5 clade, and
an Alvi1 clade. Analysis of the Alvi1 subtree also revealed
a lack of structuration as compared to the other families,
this confirming the large sequence diversity observed with
the matrix analysis. On the contrary, although relationships between families within the Alvi2-5 group can not
be resolved by our tree, relationships of sequences within
each family are well resolved considering most of bootstrap values being greater than 70%. It is especially the
case for the Alvi2 family which sequences were obtained
from various hydrothermal shrimps. Phylogenic relationships among this family also fit with those of the species
[62] in which they were identified, with only few exceptions like the AmuAlvi2a sequence from A. muricola that
clusters with Alvi2 sequences from A. markensis.
Screening for DIRS1-like elements in decapods
Capacity of detection of TEs using a PCR approach
depends of the choice of the primers, as shown by the
identification of some elements using specific/aspecific
primer pairs and not using specific/specific pairs. Hence,
absence of PCR signal could be due to the divergence of
the elements rather than their absence from the species
analyzed. To detect such more distant DIRS1-like retrotransposons, we designed degenerate primers using two
types of primers: "highly" degenerate and "softly" degenerate (see Methods). Although both of these approaches
have flows (low copy number elements could be missed

using the "highly" degenerate primers and highly divergent elements could be missed with the "softly" ones),
they are complementary and should, when used in parallel, raise the detection sensitivity. Six different combinations of primers were tested (Table 3), five using "highly"
degenerate primers, and one using two "softly" ones (see
Methods).
As expected from our previous PCR results, amplification
fragments were obtained in hydrothermal shrimps whatever the degenerate primer combination used (one fragment, AmaAlvisoft, was sequenced as control in A.
markensis, [GenBank:FJ707542]). We have shown that M.
recta harbors DIRS1-like retrotransposons (Ymur1 element). Using 'highly" degenerate primers, clear amplification fragments of the expected size were only obtained
with the GD1/rcDD4 combination. Cloning and sequencing allow to obtain three additional related sequences
(Ymur2a-c, [GenBank:FJ707543-FJ707545], > 75%
sequence identity). Two others related sequences
93%
(Ymur3a-b,
[GenBank:FJ707546–FJ707547],
sequence identity) were also obtained using the "softly"
degenerate primer combination, one of them (Ymur3b)
corresponding to an unexpected additional fragment
about 1100 bp (GD1soft/GD1soft amplification).
Sequence analysis revealed that the DIRS1-like sequences
obtained in M. recta can be clustered into 3 distinct families (Ymur1-3, see Additional file 1) and phylogenic analyses indicates that Ymur1-3 families positioned
themselves as a single well supported clade (bootstrap
value of 100%) (Fig. 3).
In other decapods, the two methods gave different results
(Table 3): while using "highly" degenerate primers combinations no amplification of the expected size was
obtained, the use of GD1soft/rcDD4soft led to either trace
amplification or amplification fragments of the expected
size. Cloning and sequencing of all single bands observed
allowed us to discover new DIRS1-like elements ([GenBank:FJ707548–FJ707560]) in 8 new species (Fig. 4 and
Additional file 3): the two coastal shrimps (Crangon crangon and Palaemon serratus), the two coastal lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus and Homarus gammarus), 2 seamount
galatheid squat lobsters (Agononida laurentae and Eumunida annulosa) and 2 coastal crabs (Xantho pilipes and Maja
squinado). The sequences obtained in a given species,
except X. pilipes, cluster into a single family (> 93%
sequence identity, see Additional file 1). In the crab X.
pilipes, the two sequences obtained define two distinct
families (Ypili1a and Ypili2a, 52% sequence identity).
Moreover, elements of the galatheid crabs E. annulosa and
A. laurentae (Yannu1a-b and Yago1a, respectively) can be
clustered into a single family we called Yannu1 (> 90%
sequence identity). Likewise, elements of the two lobsters
N. norvegicus and H. gammarus (Ynno1a-b and Yhoga1a,

Page 6 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:86

respectively) clustered into the same Ynno1 family (>
82% sequence identity). We also detect in the EST databases two DIRS1-like sequences ([GenBank:CN853875.1,
FC556055.1]) of the lobster Homarus americanus, that
share high similarities with Ynno1 family (80% sequence
identity in average). Altogether, this study led us to discover 7 new DIRS1-like families (see Additional file 3). All
of these families diverge to Alvi1-5 and Ymur1-3 families
with < 56% sequence identity (see Additional file 1).
To study their distribution, two specific primers were
designed for each newly discovered DIRS1-like family
(sequences available upon request). They were used to
screen all fifteen species in which we had observed the
presence of DIRS1-like elements (Fig. 4) as well as closely
related species (same Genus). For each family, no PCR signal was obtained except in species in which the families
were firstly identified. This underlines that all elements
previously obtained do not result from potential crosscontaminations. Nevertheless, DIRS1-like retrotransposons are widely distributed among decapod crustaceans, although this distribution appears to be
heterogeneous according to the phylum considered (Fig.
4). DIRS1-like elements are yet identified in all caridean
shrimps and lobsters tested. In anomourans the distribution appears very patchy as DIRS1-like retrotransposons
are characterized in 3 out of the 4 galatheid squat lobsters
but not in porcelain crabs or hermit crab. Finally, the presence of these elements has been only detected in 2 out of
the 8 brachyuran crabs tested with especially no detection
in hydrothermal organisms.

Discussion
Methodological issues
DIRS1-like retrotransposons have yet been reported in a
restricted number of eukaryote species (Table 1), in contrast to LTR retrotransposons that show a wide and almost
continuous distribution. However, we found DIRS1-like
elements in 15 out of the 25 decapod species studied, with
15 novel DIRS1-like families identified (see Additional
file 3) and a particularly large diversity observed among
hydrothermal shrimps (Fig. 4). To characterize transposable elements among different genomes, two approaches
are usually performed: in silico approaches [57,58] and/or
PCR-based procedures [27,28,64]. Most of previous studies aiming at identifying DIRS1-like retrotransposons
were based on in silico approaches [41,43]. However, in
the case of decapods, genomic sequences are scarce, with
sequencing projects concerning only the creation of EST
databases (e.g., Petrolisthes cinctipes, Joint Genome Institute). In particular, to our knowledge no large-scale
genome sequencing project is ongoing. We therefore conducted several PCR-based approaches that enable to
screen for partial DIRS1-like pol region simultaneously in
a large number of species representing numerous decapod

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/86

taxa (shrimps, crabs, galatheid crabs, porcelain crabs, hermit crabs and lobsters). Among the 73 sequences that we
identified, 5 were obtained from PCR-amplified fragments which size differed from the one expected (see
Additional file 3). Analyses of such additional fragments,
which can be obtained for different species or using different primer combinations, provide an interesting way to
identify new TEs. One issue with DIRS-like retrotransposons is that they are sometimes abusively grouped with
Ty3/gypsy-like elements because their RT/RH domains are
closely related. Distinguishing them from each other is
however primordial, particularly if DIRS-like elements are
in fact more frequent that previously supposed. For that
purpose, it is important to check the partial pol sequence
of each element for the presence of the MT domain (specific to DIRS-like elements) (Fig. 1) before assigning them
to DIRS-like superfamily.
To classify our sequences into families, we used a nucleotide sequence identity matrix built using pairwise deletion method (see Additional file 1). This method presents
the advantage to compute a distance for each pair of
sequences, ignoring only the gaps that are involved in the
comparison and therefore including the largest amount of
information for the whole dataset. This method appears
as the most appropriate to analyze our sequences, as our
dataset is constituted of several PCR-based sequences that
only partially overlap, and because many of our sequences
harbor small internal indels. Finally, this approach
appears efficient as it enables to clearly define the different
families that we found (Fig. 2). Recently, in an attempt to
find criteria for sequence-based TE classification for the
annotation of TEs in large scale genome sequencing
projects, the "80-80-80" rule has been proposed [38]. This
rule states that two TEs belong to the same family if they
share 80% (or more) sequence identity over segments
longer than 80 bp representing at least 80% of the coding
domains, internal domains, or terminal repeat regions.
However, as noticed by the authors, this rule is more efficient on terminal repeat regions and non-coding regions
than on coding regions like pol. This property was confirmed with our dataset, thus leading to the conclusion
that, although certainly efficient for large-scale genome
sequence analysis of TEs, this rule is not adapted to our
PCR-based analysis.
Distribution of Alvi families within Alvinocarididae
genomes
Screenings for DIRS1-like elements in decapod genomes
indicates that the "highly" degenerate primers have a
lower detection sensitivity than the "softly" degenerate
ones. Oligonucleotide sequences of "softly" degenerate
primers correspond to a subset of those present in the
"highly" degenerate ones (See Additional file 5). Nevertheless, the combination of "softly" degenerate primers

Unrooted phenetic tree based on nucleotide DIRS1like sequences identified in hydrothermal organisms.
The tree was constructed using Neighbor Joining method
and pairwise deletion of gaps option included in MEGA4.1
software. Alvi1-5 families are originated from hydrothermal
shrimps and Ymur1-3 elements were identified in Munidopsis

allowed for identifying DIRS1-like elements in at least 15
diverse decapods whereas combinations of "highly"
degenerate ones detect elements in only the 6 Alvinocarididae and M. recta (Table 3). Despite their weaker detection
sensitivity, "highly" degenerate primers led to PCR amplifications in the six hydrothermal shrimps whatever the
combinations used. We suggest that these observations
may be due to a higher copy number of DIRS1-like retrotransposons in these genomes that could counterbalance
the lower detection sensitivity of the "highly" degenerate
primers.
In complement to degenerate primers, PCR screening
using specific primers is a powerful approach to study the

distribution of previously characterized elements, as well
as for identifying novel members of closely related families. Indeed, screening for Alvi1-3 families at a small phylogenetic scale (i.e. within the family Alvinocarididae) led
to the detection of the Alvi4 and Alvi5 families. Since all
hydrothermal shrimps harbor Alvi elements, these ones
likely result from the activity of DIRS1-like retrotransposons that were already present in the genome of the
common ancestor of all Alvinocarididae species. Alvi elements may thus belong to relatively ancient lineages of
DIRS1-like retrotransposons. They could be as old as several million years, since molecular estimates of divergence
show that the vent-endemic caridean shrimp species radiated 6.7 to 11.7 million years ago [62]. This is especially
true for the Alvi1 and Alvi2 families that are shared among
Alvinocarididae.
Our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3) also shows that Alvi2 to
Alvi5 families cluster into a single clade, suggesting that
these families diverged from a common ancestor. The
Alvi3 and Alvi4 families are each restricted to a single species and may therefore correspond to lineage-specific evolution. In A. stactophila, the presence of both Alvi2 and
Alvi4 families suggests that this last could result from the
differentiation of a subset of the ancestral family. In M.
fortunata, which is the most distant species among vent
shrimps [62], we observe the presence of Alvi3 instead of
Alvi2 (Fig. 4). Two alternative evolutionary scenarios
could explain this observation. If elements of the Alvi3
family were present in the Alvinocarididae ancestor, the
distribution observed would result from different lineagespecific burst-like events of different Alvi families, as
observed for LTR retrotransposons in rice-related species
[65], leading to the amplification of Alvi3 in M. fortunata
and this of Alvi2 in the common ancestor of other related
vent shrimps. On the other hand, if the Alvi3 family was
absent from the Alvinocarididae ancestor, it likely results
from a lineage-specific evolution of the ancestral Alvi2
family in the M. fortunata lineage. In addition, R. exoculata
and C. chacei, which are phylogenetically very close [62],
harbor the same distribution pattern for DIRS1-like families (Fig. 4) with close corresponding sequences (e.g. average of 89% sequence identity within Alvi1 family). All
these observations suggest that the wide distribution of
DIRS1-like retrotransposons among Alvinocarididae is
closely related to the phylogeny of species and that the
emergence of new elements is linked to the independent
evolutionary history of Alvi families within each host
genomes. Although we cannot privilege one evolutionary
scenario, all possible scenarios are in accordance with a
simple vertical transmission of the different Alvi elements.

clades: the DrDIRS1 clade that groups the DIRS1-like elements identified in teleost fishes, and the TcDIRS1 clade
that pools together elements from insects and sea urchins.
To determine the relatedness of our elements with other
DIRS1-like retrotransposons, we performed a new phylogenic analysis using the Maximum Likelihood method.
The core dataset included Alvi1-5 and Ymur3 families, the
only families for which we got sufficiently long sequences,
as well as the recently identified elements of another crustacean species, Daphnia pulex, and those of the cnidarian
Nematostella vectensis, which were never reported in phylogenic analyses to date. The resulting tree (Fig. 5) is in
accordance to those previously described. The two
DpDIRS1-2 elements from D. pulex cluster with those of
other arthropods (insects) in the TcDIRS1 clade. In contrast, DIRS1-like elements of decapods are phylogenetically divergent from these, with the Alvi1-5 and Ymur3
families forming a distinct clade among the DIRS1-like
superfamily that we called AlDIRS1-clade.
These results indicate the presence of amino acid signatures for decapod elements, in particular a Tryptophane
(W) instead of a Phenylalanine (F) amino acid in the RT
domain at position 44 on the alignment (see Additional

file 6). Interestingly, this signature is also shared by the
sequences that we obtained in other decapods. Therefore,
we propose that the decapod DIRS1-like retrotransposons
may belong to the AlDIRS1 clade, although further studies
on the phylogenic relationships of these elements are
needed to confirm this. For that purpose, two conditions
should be fulfilled: to obtain additional sequences to
build better amino acids consensus sequences, and to
enlarge the sequences obtained for the pol region to
improve the number of informative sites.
Wide distribution of DIRS1-like elements among decapods
Our analysis of the distribution of the DIRS1-like retrotransposons (Fig. 4), the first as such large scale (within an
order) gives clues to better understand the peculiar scattered distribution of these elements among eukaryote
genomes. Three species (M. recta, A. stactophila and A.
markensis) harbor at least 3 different DIRS1-like families.
Such results are similar to those observed in other wellstudied species such as the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus (4 families, [43]) and the zebrafish Danio rerio
(3 families, [49]). In particular, we show that DIRS1-like
elements can be much more than just a feature of isolate
species. When focusing on a given taxa (order Decapoda)

Figure 4
Species distribution of the different DIRS1-like families
Species distribution of the different DIRS1-like families. Names of the diverse TEs analyzed are shown on top.
Plus and minus signs indicate the presence (+) or absence (-)
of these elements in the different species tested. Genetic
relationships between species and infraorders are represented by a tree topology, reconstructed from previous
studies [27,36,62,66], with hydrothermal vent species indicated in purple. Position of Maja squinado within Brachyura is
still unresolved, this species was thus arbitrarily placed at the
base of the infraorder. * The Ynno1 family of astacideans has
been also detected in an EST database from another lobster
species (H. americanus).

the distribution of DIRS1-like retrotransposons (Fig. 4)
appears more or less patchy, depending on the infraorder
considered (as defined in [66]). Three different distribution patterns are observed: (i) presence of the elements in
a large range of species (the 8 caridean and the 3 astacidean species). (ii) presence of the elements in a subpart of
the infraorder (presence in 3 out of 4 galatheid crabs and
absence of detection in hermit crab or porcelain crabs).
(iii) presence of the elements in a restricted number of
species (2 out of 8 crabs). So, Decapoda are the first example revealing that DIRS1-like element may be frequent,
widely distributed and so probably ancient within an
order.
Species distribution of DIRS1-like retrotransposons (Fig.
4) thus appears related to species phylogeny. Some families are widely distributed among closely related species
(e.g., Alvi1-2 and Ynno1) whereas some others (e.g.,
Ypili1-2 and Yannu1) seem to be only scarcely shared,
even among species that belong to the same Genus. Considering the environmental conditions of species, DIRS1like retrotransposons are not restricted to hydrothermal
species. However, their higher detection sensitivity in vent
organisms (Alvinocarididae shrimps and the galatheid
crab M. recta) suggests some peculiar features that could
be related to a greatest element diversity and/or a higher

number of copies. To better understand the distribution
of DIRS1-like elements among Decapoda, the next step
will be to extend our study to other infraorders (e.g. Achelata (spiny lobsters) or Dendrobranchiata (large prawn)),
even to other crustaceans. Such an analysis will also allow
for analyzing the vertical transmission of DIRS1-like elements suggested by our results. Moreover, we are currently
estimating the number of copies of DIRS1-like retrotransposons. This will provide crucial information (i) to point
out possible particularities of vent species in comparison
with other decapods and (ii) to understand the dynamics
of these elements within Decapoda. We also wonder
whether such widespread distribution and diversity of
DIRS1-like retrotransposons are peculiar features of Decapoda, or if similar features can be observed in other
clades, for instance one known to harbor DIRS1-like elements (Table 1). If the widespread distribution of DIRS1like retrotransposons that we observe within a taxon is a
usual pattern, then the presence of one element in a given
species would indicate that DIRS1-like retrotransposons
are likely to be found in phylogenetically closely related
species.

Conclusion
Because of the small number of DIRS1-like elements
described to date, little is known about the distribution
and the evolutionary dynamics of these retrotransposons,
which differ to other TEs by their peculiar tyrosine recombinase -based replication model [41]. This paper presents
the first study using PCR approaches to specifically search
for DIRS1-like retrotransposons in several related species.
Fifteen new DIRS1-like families were identified in 15
decapod species which nearly doubles both the number of
DIRS1-like elements described to date, and the number of
species known to harbor such elements. Our study reveals
a larger diversity of DIRS1-like retrotransposons as we distinguish a third clade (AlDIRS1-clade) in addition to the
TcDIRS1 and DrDIRS1 clades previously described. Our
results provide a new vision of the distribution of the
DIRS1-like superfamily, and reveals that these elements
are not as scattered as previously thought. It is the first
study showing that these retrotransposons could have a
widespread distribution within a large order (Decapoda)
as well as a great diversity within a family (Alvinocarididae). These observations open the way to further studies
on the evolutionary dynamics of these elements.

Methods
Biological materials
Twenty-five species of Decapoda were sampled in 3 major
types of environment: deep-sea hydrothermal vents, the
intertidal zone and seamounts. Vent animals were sampled during different cruises. Specimens from the South
East Pacific Rise (the crabs Bythograea thermydron and

Cyanagraea praedator, and the galatheid squat lobster
Munidopsis recta) were collected during the French cruise
"BIOSPEEDO" (March–May 2004) using the French
"Nautile" deep-submergence vehicle operating from the
N.O. "L'Atalante". Samples from the LAU Back-Arc Basin
(the caridean shrimps Alvinocaris muricola and Alvinocaris
stactophila) were collected by the DSV JASON II during the
American cruise TUIM07MV (June 2005). At last, specimens from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (the caridean shrimps
Alvinocaris markensis, Mirocaris fortunata, Rimicaris exoculata, Chorocaris chacei, and the crab Segonzacia mesatlantica) were sampled on two vent fields (Lucky Strike or
Rainbow), during the French cruise "MoMARETO"
(August 2006) with the suction sampler of the ROV 'Victor 6000' operating from the R/V "Pourquoi pas ?".
For coastal decapods, 12 species (the caridean shrimps
Palaemon serratus,Crangon crangon, the brachyuran crabs
Carcinus maenas, Maja squinado, Necora puber, Xantho incisus,Xantho pilipes, the lobsters Homarus gammarus,Nephrops
norvegicus, the porcelain crabs Porcellana platycheles, Pisidia
longicornis, and the hermit crab Dardanus calidus) were collected in French Brittany.
Finally, three specimens of galatheid squat lobsters from
seamounts (Agononida laurentae, Eumunida annulosa, and
Eumunida sternomaculata) were collected south of NewCaledonia on Norfolk seamounts during the prospecting
campaigns Norfolk 1 (2001, IRD Nouméa) and Norfolk 2
(2003, MUSORSTOM).
For all samples, living specimens were fixed immediately
after collection, in liquid nitrogen for vent species or in
70% ethanol for the other species. They were then stored
at -80°C or 4°C, respectively.
DNA from one individual per species was isolated using
the CTAB method [67]. Dry DNA pellets were suspended
in TE Buffer (10 mM Tris and 0.1 mM EDTA).
Detecting DIRS1-like retrotransposons using degenerate
primers
To look for retrotransposon pol fragments, we performed
PCRs using several degenerate primer pairs (Fig. 1). Two
primers (GD1 and GD2) were designed to amplify, in
three hydrothermal shrimp species (Chorocaris chacei,
Mirocaris fortunata and Rimicaris exoculata), conserved
motifs of Ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons: 'RMPFGL' and
'LTTDAS', which are also shared with DIRS1-like elements
(see Additional file 5). Four other primers (DD1, DD2,
DD4, rcDD4 (reverse complement of DD4)) were
designed to amplify conserved motifs specific to the pol
region of DIRS1-like retrotransposons: 'LGFLIN', 'DLFAS'
and 'ASKSGWG'. Another primer, DD6, was designed on
the 'IRLHCD' motif that was conserved among the elements firstly identified in this study (Alvi1-3). Detection

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/86

sensitivity of DIRS1-like RT fragments was also improved
by using, two "softly" degenerate primers related to GD1
(GD1soft) and rcDD4 (rcDD4soft). Degeneration level of
these primers corresponds to 384 different sequences possible instead of the 1024 or 8192 sequences for GD1 and
rcDD4, respectively. Finally, we also defined a non degenerate primer (Retro1+) conserved among DIRS1-like elements of Alvinocarididae and that spans the highly wellconserved YLDD motif that is present in both LTR retrotransposons and DIRS-like elements. All primer
sequences are available in supplementary data (See Additional file 2). PCR amplifications of all primer combinations tested were performed as described in [36] and
amplification products were separated on 1% agarose
gels. Bands with the expected molecular weight were
excised from the agarose gels, purified with SpinX column
(Costar) and cloned in pGEM-T vector according to the
manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA). One to three clones were sequenced using the
Abi prism automated sequencer (Genome Express) and
the partial pol nucleotide sequences have been submitted
to the GenBank database ([GenBank:FJ707538–
FJ707560]).
Extending the pol sequences
Sequences obtained with degenerate primers allowed to
define several new DIRS1-like retrotransposons. In hydrothermal shrimps, a PCR walking approach (See Additional file 4) was then performed to extend pol sequences
from each initial fragment, in order to study the diversity
of these elements and to analyze their phylogenic relationships. PCR amplification was performed using a specific primer (sequence available upon request) designed
within the fragment in combination with a degenerate
primer pointing outward of either the 5' or the 3' edge of
the element (see Additional file 3 for details). PCR amplifications were performed as presented above. For each
walking step, one to three clones were sequenced and
each individual sequence (which corresponds to part of a
single genomic copy), was deposited in GenBank ([GenBank:FJ707561–FJ707569]). Each new sequence was
automatically validated as an extension of the initial fragment using the Cap contig assembly program included in
the BioEdit software [68] with a minimum overlap
between the two sequences of 50 bp, and a minimum
DNA identity of 95%.
Analyzing the distribution of the DIRS1-like
retrotransposons identified
Any DIRS1-like element that was newly identified in any
species was searched in other decapods studied. Primers
(sequence available upon request) were designed to be as
specific as possible of each element, i.e. common to all
sequences available for this element but unshared with
the others. These specific primers were then used to PCRscreen all other species to look for well-conserved elePage 11 of 15

Figure 5 of DIRS1-like based on RT/RH amino acid
sequences
Rooted phylogenic tree retrotransposons
Rooted phylogenic tree based on RT/RH amino acid
sequences of DIRS1-like retrotransposons. Tree performed on a core data set including representative amino
acid consensus sequences of the RT/RH domains of the
Ymur3 and Alvi1-5 families and 16 previously well-described
DIRS1-like retrotransposons (see Table 1 for accession numbers). PAT-like sequences were used as outgroup as well as
Ty3/gypsy-like elements according to the close phylogenic
relationships of their RT/RH domains with those of DIRS-like
retrotransposons: Clonorchis sinensis CsRn1, [GenBank:AAK07485]; Drosophila melanogaster 412, [GenBank:CAA27750.1]; Tetraodon nigroviridis TnGr1 available on
Retrobase database [50];Takifugu rubripes sushi-ichi, [GenBank:AAC33526]; Caenorhabditis briggsae CbPAT1, [GenBank:XP_001664700.1] and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
SpPAT1 available on Retrobase database [50]. The tree was
constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method and 100
bootstrap replicates. Only nodes with bootstrap value over
50% are indicated. Distances were calculated using WAG
model with gamma distribution's correction for amino acids.
The two previously described clades [41,48], DrDIRS1-clade
and TcDIRS1-clade, are indicated.

ments among species. PCR amplifications were performed for 30 cycles (94°C for 45 sec, 54°C for 1 min,
and 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step at
72°C for 10 min) using about 50 ng of each DNA sample,
2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 10 pmol
of each primer in a final volume of 25 μl. PCR products
were checked by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel and
those of expected size were purified using the SpinX column (Costar) then cloned in pGEM-T vector. One to three
clones were sequenced (Genome Express). Corresponding
sequences are available in GenBank ([GenBank:
FJ707570–FJ707610]).

To investigate the distribution of DIRS1-like retrotransposons at a small phylogenetic scale, we focused on the
Alvi elements identified within the family Alvinocarididae
(hydrothermal shrimps). For that purpose, two kinds of
PCR amplifications were performed, the first one using
different combinations of specific primers, and the second
using a specific primer in combination with the Retro1+
primer. Two or three specific primers (sequences available
upon request) were designed for the Alvi1-4 families. Different combinations of primers were tested for each family (See Additional file 2) on either all 25 decapod species
or on a selected subset of 12 species (i.e. all hydrothermal
species and the two non hydrothermal caridean shrimps).
Sequence analysis
Sequence similarity searches were performed using BLAST
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. Multiple DNA
and protein sequence alignments were constructed using
ClustalX [63] and manually curated using BioEdit [68].
DNA alignments were used to estimate pairwise distances
and to build phenetic trees, using the pairwise deletion of
gaps option of the MEGA4.1 software [69]. Pairwise distance calculation matrix was computed using p-distance
model. Clustering of sequences into families was then
performed in a Neighbor Joining tree [70] constructed
using the Tamura 3 parameter model [71].

Representative amino acids consensus sequences of several elements were constructed by identifying the most
common amino acid for each position of the alignment.
Amino acid multiple alignment was checked using
Gblocks [72] and ambiguously aligned sites were
removed. Phylogenic analyses were then conducted using
Maximum Likelihood method [73] included in the
Topali2 software [74] where the best-fit model (WAG
model [75] with gamma distribution) was selected. For all
phylogenic analyses, support for individual clades was
evaluated using non-parametric bootstrapping [76] using
1000 or 100 bootstrap replicates for nucleic acids and
amino acids sequences, respectively.
