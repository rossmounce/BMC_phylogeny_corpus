Abstract
Background: The Osa1 Genome Annotation of rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare)
is the product of a semi-automated pipeline that does not explicitly predict pseudogenes. As such,
it is likely to mis-annotate pseudogenes as functional genes. A total of 22,033 gene models within
the Osa1 Release 5 were investigated as potential pseudogenes as these genes exhibit at least one
feature potentially indicative of pseudogenes: lack of transcript support, short coding region, long
untranslated region, or, for genes residing within a segmentally duplicated region, lack of a paralog
or significantly shorter corresponding paralog.
Results: A total of 1,439 pseudogenes, identified among genes with pseudogene features, were
characterized by similarity to fully-supported gene models and the presence of frameshifts or
premature translational stop codons. Significant difference in the length of duplicated genes within
segmentally-duplicated regions was the optimal indicator of pseudogenization. Among the 816
pseudogenes for which a probable origin could be determined, 75% originated from gene
duplication events while 25% were the result of retrotransposition events. A total of 12% of the
pseudogenes were expressed. Finally, F-box proteins, BTB/POZ proteins, terpene synthases,
chalcone synthases and cytochrome P450 protein families were found to harbor large numbers of
pseudogenes.
Conclusion: These pseudogenes still have a detectable open reading frame and are thus distinct
from pseudogenes detected within intergenic regions which typically lack definable open reading
frames. Families containing the highest number of pseudogenes are fast-evolving families involved
in ubiquitination and secondary metabolism.

Background
Pseudogenes are defined as genes that have lost their ability to produce a functional protein. Although such relics
have been identified in all genomes, the number and persistence of pseudogenes varies greatly among species: in
human, the estimated number of pseudogenes ranges

from 10,000 to 20,000 [1,2], while in Drosophila, only
110 pseudogenes (or 1 pseudogene per 130 genes) were
identified [3]. Pseudogenes are hypothesized to arise by
gene duplication, including retrotransposition during
which a retrotransposase mediates the integration a transcript into the genome [4] (see Additional file 1). Since

they are redundant with the genes from which the transcript originated (hereafter termed parent gene) and are
integrated without a promoter into random locations in
the genome, the products of retrotransposition events are
likely to be nonfunctional and to accumulate disabling
mutations faster than functional genes. In such cases, they
are termed retrotransposed pseudogenes or processed
pseudogenes. In general, acceleration of evolutionary
rates have been measured immediately following duplication and used to explain functional diversification such as
subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization and pseudogenization [5,6].
Limited effort has been put into whole-genome identification of pseudogenes in plants, and, although wholegenome, segmental and tandem duplications have played
a large role in the evolution of plant genomes [7,8], most
of the literature has focused on the more readily identifiable retrotransposed pseudogenes. The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) has released the annotation of
859 pseudogenes in TAIR8, which were presumably the
result of a manual annotation effort [9]. Studies in rice
(Oryza sativa ssp indica) and Arabidopsis have focused on
chimeric genes originating from the recruitment of additional exons by retrotransposed genes. As by-products of
these analyses, Wang et al. [10] found 337 retrotransposed genes containing at least one frameshift mutation
in rice, and Zhang et al. [11] reported 22 in Arabidopsis. A
separate effort using more liberal criteria identified 411
retrotransposed genes in Arabidopsis, 376 of which were
disabled due to frameshifts or premature stop codons
[12].
The majority of studies on pseudogenes focus on the identification of gene relics in the intergenic regions and not
among annotated protein coding genes. This is sufficient
for highly curated genomes in which pseudogenes have
already been annotated. However, an increasing number
of genomes are annotated in an automated or semiautomated fashion, and rely partially on ab initio gene finders,
which typically do not predict pseudogenes. The Osa1
Genome Annotation (of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) consists of gene predictions made by the ab initio gene finder FGENESH, and improved through
incorporation of transcript evidence [13]. Despite expression datasets in the form of Expressed Sequence Tags
(ESTs), full-length cDNAs and Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing tags (MPSS), Serial Analysis of Gene
Expression (SAGE), and proteomic datasets, over 40% of
the non-transposable element (non-TE)-related rice genes
are not currently supported by transcript evidence. The ab
initio gene-prediction software FGENESH was chosen for
rice due to its combination of high sensitivity (78%) and
specificity (76%) at the exon level [14]. Despite this high
performance, FGENESH is likely to circumvent premature

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/317

stop codons or frameshift mutations leading to premature
stop codons in otherwise long open-reading frames (ORF)
by adding introns or interrupting the ORF prematurely.
Therefore, not only does FGENESH not predict pseudogenes, but it may predict an interrupted ORF where a
pseudogene is more likely. Rice pseudogenes annotated
by experts and deposited to the Osa1 Community Annotation project are evidence of this issue. Comparison of 72
pseudogenes annotated by community annotators in the
Osa1 Release 4 gene annotation revealed that these pseudogenes had either been entirely "missed" by the Osa1
automated pipeline (30 pseudogenes), or had been misannotated (incorrect structures were invoked to circumvent stop codons or frameshifts; 25 pseudogenes), or had
been annotated as genes (17 pseudogenes) [15]. These
results suggest that a whole-genome approach to the identification of pseudogenes in the rice gene complement
would improve the quality of the annotation.
Pseudogene detection methods rely on the alignment of
genes to intergenic regions for the identification of a pseudogene-parent pair. The characteristics of the pseudogenes are further determined based on global alignment
of the pseudogenes to their respective parents [16-18]. The
success of this type of approach is inherently dependent
on the quality of the annotation for the organism in question, as it assumes that the structure of the parent gene is
accurately predicted [2]. Yao et al. [19] used a different
strategy: human genes and pseudogenes were identified
by ranking the alignments of EST, mRNA, and protein
based on identity and coverage. Models created exclusively from non top-ranking alignments (i.e. non-cognate
evidence) were labeled as non-transcribed pseudogenes,
while models with cognate transcript(s) but frameshifted
cognate protein were designated as transcribed pseudogenes. This approach produced a set of pseudogenes with
75 to 80% overlap with manually curated pseudogenes.
An important advantage of this strategy is that it obviates
the need for a pre-determined set of functional models.
However, the authors also demonstrate that, in the case of
the human genome (~20,000 genes), a minimum of 5
million ESTs is necessary to avoid over-predicting pseudogenes, a number vastly superior to what is currently available for rice.
We blended the two methods described above by using
only fully-supported rice models to identify pseudogenes
among a set of rice genes with features potentially indicative of pseudogenes, hereafter termed Genes with Pseudogene Features (GPFs) (see Additional file 2). Pseudogene
features assessed were i) lack of alignment to an EST or
cDNA (possibly indicating lack of expression), ii) long
untranslated regions (UTRs), iii) short coding sequences
(CDS), iv) a downstream poly-A tail, and v) for genes in
segmentally-duplicated regions: differing protein length

or number of exons between the duplicated genes, or lack
of paralog and single-exon gene model structure. Parentderived models were constructed by aligning all fully-supported gene models (i.e., gene models with full-length
cDNA transcript support) to the genomic sequence of
GPFs. A total of 1,439 pseudogenes, aligning over at least
70% of the parent and containing disablement(s)
(frameshifts and/or premature stop codon) were identified in the rice gene complement. We characterized the
pseudogenes, identified their most likely origin, investigated their ancestral function, and validated our method
by comparing our results to previously identified pseudogenes in rice.

Results
Selection of a set of Genes with Pseudogene Features
(GPFs) for further study
In order to avoid over predicting pseudogenes and
thereby discarding the annotation of genuinely functional
genes, the Osa1 Release 5 gene set was partitioned using
criteria that differentiated high-confidence, well-supported genes from lower-confidence functional genes that
may be pseudogenes and should be examined. The first
criterion was transcript support, as evidence in other
organisms suggest that the vast majority of pseudogenes
are not transcribed [20]. Reasons for the lack of expression
of pseudogenes include the absence of a promoter in the
case of retrotransposed pseudogenes and the accumulation of mutations within the promoter of a gene that has
been made redundant by another type of duplication
event. Among the 41,046 Osa1 Release 5 non-TE-related
genes, we identified 17,792 genes without cognate EST or
cDNA support (unsupported category, see Table 1) and
831 genes with long 5' or 3' UTRs (long UTR category,
Table 1), which could indicate a truncated ORF. We also
identified 475 genes with long downstream stretches of

adenines, which may be remnants of poly-A tails of transcripts integrated in the genome by a retrotransposase
(polyA tail category, Table 1). An additional 734 genes,
which were not part of the official Osa1 Release 5 because
of the short length of their coding sequence (below 50
amino acids) were also selected for further study (short
CDS category, Table 1).
To identify additional pseudogenes, we examined genes
within segmentally duplicated regions [21]. Among these,
4,833 single-exon genes lacked a corresponding gene in
the duplicated segment (single-exon singleton category,
Table 1) and could be retrotransposed pseudogenes which
inserted after the segmental duplication event. Lastly, we
searched for pairs of paralogous genes within duplicated
segments [21] that showed a disparity in gene length or
exon number between their two members. A total of 248
gene pairs contained a shortened paralog based on CDS
length or exon number (segmentally duplicated category,
Table 1). In total, 22,033 genes in Osa1 Release 5, hereafter referred to as GPFs, had at least one feature associated
with pseudogenes and were selected for further investigation.
Identification of pseudogenes and parent genes
A total of 5,340 gene models with ≥ 70% coverage of the
protein encoded by the parent gene were identified using
the strategy summarized in Additional file 2. Among
these, 1,439 contained at least one disablement
(frameshift or stop codon) and are hereafter termed pseudogenes (Table 1). Only one pseudogene had all disablements in the last 10 amino acid of its sequence (marked
with a star in Additional file 3).

Pairwise alignments of the GPFs and the pseudogenes
revealed that 75% overlapped, i.e., aligned over > 35 aa

with 80% identity or with E-value < 1e-30, indicating that
most pseudogenes are variants of the FGENESH model
from which the GPFs were derived. This also suggests that
the pseudogenes identified in this study may have been
recently acquired, and may have diverged less from functional genes than pseudogenes identified within intergenic regions where ab initio gene finders are unable to
construct a model.
The vast majority of pseudogenes (1,191) originated from
the largest group of candidates, the unsupported category.
Beyond the absolute numbers, the percentage of pseudogenes identified from the GPFs in each category varied
from 0.7% to 16% (Table 1). Significant differences in size
within segmentally duplicated genes and unusually long
UTRs were the best indicators of pseudogenization, with
40 (16%) and 104 (12%) of the GPFs in these categories
respectively identified as pseudogenes. A short CDS and
singleton status within a segmentally duplicated region
were the least robust predictors for pseudogenization,
with 5 (<1%) and 202 (4%) pseudogenes, respectively. It
should be noted that the percentage of pseudogenes identified in each category depends in part on the identification of a parent for the candidate pseudogene. Any
pseudogene that has diverged from its parent gene (<40%
identity), or which has lost over 30% of its coding region,
would not be identified within the parameters used in this
study.
Duplicated pseudogenes are more abundant than
retrotransposed pseudogenes
Number of exons within the pseudogene and corresponding parent gene was used to determine the pseudogenization mechanism. Retrotransposed pseudogenes are
expected to be single-exon genes regardless of the structure of the parent, while duplicated pseudogenes to have
retained at least some of the ancestral introns based on the
low rates of intron gain and loss observed in rice [21]. We
were able to derive the pseudogenization mechanism for
the 816 (57%) pseudogenes with multi-exon parents
(Table 2). Of these, 77% were multi-exon pseudogenes

(i.e., duplicated pseudogenes) while 23% were singleexon pseudogenes (i.e., retrotransposed pseudogenes).
Among the remaining 43% pseudogenes (all with singleexon parents and therefore unresolved origin) an overwhelming majority are single-exon pseudogenes with single-exon parents (86%, 539 out of 623), and a small
proportion consist of multi-exon pseudogenes predicted
to originate from a single-exon parent (13%, 84 out of
623). It is possible that the introns in this last group of
pseudogenes are mis-predicted or appeared after the retrotransposition or duplication event, and originate from the
insertion of a retroelement [17,18].
The pseudogenes were evenly distributed throughout the
genome (see Additional file 4). Examination of the distributions of retrotransposed and duplicated pseudogenes,
segmentally duplicated regions and tandemly duplicated
genes suggest that pseudogenes are not disproportionately
associated with segmentally duplicated regions or clusters
of tandemly replicated genes (Additional file 4).
As expected, almost all of the pseudogenes identified in
paralogous pairs within segmentally duplicated regions
are of duplicated origin (36 out of 38). Among the pseudogenes of known origin, a significantly higher proportion of retrotransposed pseudogenes were identified in
the single-exon singleton category (34 out of 73 of known
origin or 46%, versus 189 out of 816 or 23% across categories, p-value < 10-5, Fisher's exact test), thereby verifying
our hypothesis that many of these pseudogenes might
have appeared by retrotransposition subsequent to the
major segmental duplication event that occurred in rice
70 million years ago [22].
Characteristics of the pseudogenes
Comparison of the characteristics in duplicated versus retrotransposed pseudogenes (Table 3) indicates that pseudogenes of duplicated origin are on average longer (492
versus 398 amino acids) and more similar to their respective parent genes as measured by nucleotide identity, protein similarity, and percent coverage. The number of

disablements is slightly higher in duplicated compared to
retrotransposed pseudogenes (1.85 versus 1.52), but this
trend is reversed when the number of disablements is normalized by the length of pseudogenes, as expressed in the
number of disablements per 1000 bases. These statistics
suggest that retrotransposed pseudogenes have diverged
more from their parent gene than duplicated pseudogenes.
Table 3 also shows that pseudogenes of unknown origin
with single-exon parents have characteristics that are more
similar to those of duplicated pseudogenes compared to
those of retrotransposed origin (with the exception of
their shorter length). This suggests that the majority of
these pseudogenes may have been generated by duplication.
The distribution of the number of disablements per pseudogene was plotted in Figure 1. Retrotransposed, duplicated, and genes of unknown origin all followed the same
relationship (not shown). The distinctive exponential
relationship between the number of disablements and the
number of pseudogenes suggests that the appearance of
disablements in pseudogenes is random and may be corollary to reduced selective pressure on the pseudogenes
[23].
Expression of the pseudogenes
Several reports of a small but significant proportion of
expressed pseudogenes in the human genome [2,20,24]
prompted us to look at the expression level of pseudogenes in rice. Given the fact that 83% of the pseudogenes
identified are in the unsupported category as defined by
lack of EST and full-length cDNA support (Table 1), we
investigated deeper expression evidence datasets provided
by MPSS expression profiles. We searched for MPSS tags
identified in 22 rice libraries [25] that mapped uniquely
to pseudogene exons. Overall, 170 pseudogenes (12% of
the total) showed at least some basal expression in the
MPSS libraries surveyed, compared to 844 parent genes
(92% of the total number of parent genes). However, the
level of expression of these pseudogenes was significantly

lower than that of their respective parent (163 versus 486
transcripts per million, p = 0.03, pairwise t-test), which is
consistent with the lack of EST and/or full-length cDNA
support for the majority of the associated GPFs. The proportion of transcribed pseudogenes ranged from 0% in
the short CDS category to 35% in the duplicate category
(Table 1). Altogether, 133 (78%) of the transcribed pseudogenes were of known origin: among them, 114 (85%)
were of duplicated origin and 19 (15%) were retrotransposed. Based on the total number of duplicated and retrotransposed pseudogenes (627 and 189 respectively), these
results indicate that 18% of the duplicated pseudogenes
are transcribed versus only 10% of the retrotransposed
pseudogenes. This difference is consistent with observations in human [2] and is likely due to the fact that inte-

Rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution of
pseudogenes
Due to their non-functional nature, pseudogenes are not
expected to be under evolutionary constraint and instead,
are expected to be under neutral selection. Thus, pseudogenes should have a synonymous substitution rate (Ks)
roughly equal to the non-synonymous mutation rate
(Ka), while functional genes should have a Ka/Ks much
lower than 1, since non-synonymous mutations present a
disadvantage and are selected against (purifying selection). Maximum likelihood estimates of the Ka and Ks
were calculated by analysis of the alignments of the pseudogenes to their corresponding parents. We found that
the Ka/Ks distribution was log-normal with a geometric
mean of 0.32. This is lower than the expected value of 1,
but can be explained in part by the fact that each pseudogene is compared to its "sibling" rather than its true,
ancestral, parent. This approximation inflates the Ks value
and therefore decreases the Ka/Ks. Furthermore, we estimated the Ka/Ks for paralogous functional genes within
segmentally duplicated regions [21] in the same manner
as for the pseudogenes and compared the Ka/Ks distribution of the pseudogenes to that of this control set (geometric mean of 0.14). The two distributions were found to
be significantly different (p < 10-15, Welch t-test)
(Figure 2).

Evaluation of pseudogene detection method with
manually curated pseudogenes
Because they are defined by their non-functional nature,
pseudogenes can not be verified experimentally. In the
absence of a set of pseudogenes defined with certainty, we
used a set of pseudogenes manually curated by the community to benchmark our pseudogene identification
pipeline. As of December 2007, over 2,200 rice genes have
been annotated by experts and deposited within the Osa1
Community Annotation project [15]. For some families
(Bric-a-Brac/Tramtrack/Broad Complex proteins (BTB/
POZ), wall-associated kinases (WAKs), cysteine-rich peptides, glycosyl hydrolase family 1, HKT sodium and potassium transporters), annotation of pseudogenes as well as
of functional genes was provided. These community
annotated models were obtained by querying the sixframe translation of the rice genome with well-characterized proteins or sequence motifs and were subjected to
manual curation [26-30]. A total of 87 annotated pseudogenes in these families overlap with Osa1 Release 5 gene
models while other genes are predicted within intergenic
regions of the genome. We found that 30 of the 87 community-annotated pseudogenes were accurately predicted
as pseudogenes in our pipeline. More importantly, 72 of
the 87 (83%) community-annotated pseudogenes were
GPFs. This proportion is significantly higher than the proportion of Osa1 Release 5 gene models selected as GPFs
(53%, p < 10-8, Fisher's exact test). As seen in Figure 3, a
BLAST alignment was obtained for the majority of the
GPFs identified as pseudogenes by the community. However, many pseudogenes identified by the community
annotators did not pass the strict coverage and disablement criteria set in our pipeline and as a consequence,
were not annotated as pseudogenes in the present study.
Ancestral function of the pseudogenes
The ancestral function of each pseudogene was determined based on the Gene Ontology Slim terms associated
with the pseudogene's corresponding parent, since the
pseudogenes may have undergone sequence loss, and
since, in the extant genome, the parent gene best represents the ancestral gene from which the pseudogene originated. A total of 513 parents corresponding to 687
pseudogenes were found to be associated with one or
more GO terms [13]. Comparison of the relative frequency of each GO term in the overall Osa1 gene complement versus the pseudogenes revealed an overrepresentation of the genes involved in secondary metabolism, amino acid and derivative metabolic process, signal transduction, and kinase activity (Table 4).

In order to refine this general categorization, the pseudogenization frequency was examined within paralogous
families that were constructed through clustering of PFAM
and novel domains of the entire rice proteome [31]. A

catalyze the first committed step in the flavonoid pathway, which produces a wide range of secondary compounds. Family 3755 (21 functional genes) is
characterized by the dimerisation domain PF08100 and
the 6 parent genes of the 7 pseudogenes in this family are
annotated as O-methyltransferases with homology to
maize ZRP4, an enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway
involved in the production of suberin [33]. Family 3770

the metal binding domain PF03936 and the N-terminal
domain PF01397 of terpene synthases, a family of
enzymes catalyzing the first step in many pathways leading to a wide range of secondary compounds and to gibberellic acid. Family 3760 (21 functional genes and 7
pseudogenes) contains the cytochrome P450 domain
PF00067. Cytochrome P450s play an important role in
hormone synthesis (gibberellic acid, abscissic acid and
brassinosteroids) and in secondary metabolism. These
pseudogenes contributed largely to the enrichment of the
GO term GO:0006519 (amino acid and derivative metabolic process) in our GOSlim analysis.

total of 558 parents of 815 pseudogenes belonging to 444
paralogous families were examined. The number of pseudogenes per family was plotted against the size of the family (Figure 4). The scatter of the data suggests that the
number of pseudogenes per paralogous family is poorly
correlated to the size of the family (r2 = 0.01).
Three families involved in ubiquitination contained a
notable number of pseudogenes. Family 3354, which
contains 14 pseudogenes and 8 functional genes are characterized by a MATH (Meprin and TRAF homology
(PF00917)) and a BTB/POZ (PF00651) domains. Two
families, 3353 and 3352, containing F-box domains
(PF00646) have respectively 8 pseudogenes for 11 functional genes and 6 pseudogenes for 6 functional genes.
Both F-box and BTB/POZ proteins assure the function of
substrate recognition during ubiquitination [26,32].

In addition, several families with no known domain or
with domain of unknown function were found to be
enriched in pseudogenes such as families 1311, 1124 and
3054 (Figure 4). Most strikingly, the paralogous family
3724, which contains 19 functional genes, was found to
have accumulated 66 pseudogenes, the largest number for
any given family. These single-exon pseudogenes are children of 3 single-exon parents, with no identified PFAM
domains, and one uncharacterized domain identified by
sequence homology.

Discussion
Number of pseudogenes in the rice gene complement
A total of 1,439 pseudogenes were identified among the
~41,800 non-TE-related genes annotated in Osa1 Release
5. Altogether, the presence of retrotransposed or duplicated pseudogene characteristics was investigated in a subset of the non-TE-related genes (22,033, 53%). To our
knowledge, our study is the first attempt at identifying
and characterizing pseudogenes of duplicated origin in a
plant species. While we identified 1,439 pseudogenes in
this study, these represent only a partial set of pseudogenes in the rice genome as we deliberately designed a
conservative approach to annotating pseudogenes to pre-

vent mis-annotation of true functional genes. First, we
limited our analysis to a set of genes that are weakly supported by transcript evidence and/or exhibit features of
pseudogenes, thereby limiting the number of functional
genes examined. Second, although disablements can be
considered to be a consequence of the loss of functionality
of a gene rather than a cause, and are therefore, by some
definition, not a required feature of pseudogenes [17], we
required the presence of frameshift(s) or a premature stop
codon in our pseudogene set. It should be mentioned that
only a minute number of pseudogenes are likely to be the
product of a sequencing errors, which was estimated at 1
in 10,000 bases in the finished rice genome sequence
[34]. Third, only fully-supported high-confidence models
were used as potential parents for the pseudogenes to
limit the propagation of errors from the parent to the
pseudogene [2]. This implies that pseudogenes with
poorly expressed parents may not be identified. Fourth,
identity and coverage thresholds used for the alignment of
the parent to the candidate pseudogene regions were conservative, although within range of what had been used in
similar analyses [1,17].
Retrotransposed versus duplicated pseudogenes
Assignment of a probable mechanism of origination was
possible for over half of the pseudogenes based on the
internal structure of the parent gene and pseudogene.
Pseudogenes of duplicated origin are more abundant than
pseudogenes of retrotransposed origin across all categories that were considered (overall ratio of 3 to 1). Moreo-

ver, comparison of duplicated and retrotransposed
pseudogene alignments with their corresponding parent
gene suggests that pseudogenes of unknown origin are
likely to have arisen by duplication. This high ratio of
duplicated versus retrotransposed pseudogenes differs
from observations in human where retrotransposition is
the source of 70–75% of the identified pseudogenes
[2,18] and in which the appearance of pseudogenes has
been linked to a burst in L1 retrotransposon activity 40–
50 million years ago [35]. However, the duplicated to retrotransposed pseudogene ratio is consistent with the
important role of duplication in the shaping of the rice
genome. By some estimates, over 50% of the genome
could be the product of duplication [7,8].
Alignments of pseudogenes to their parents showed that
retrotransposed pseudogenes are more diverged from
their parent gene than their duplicated counterparts. This
observation is consistent with the fact that products of retrotransposition, in the absence of a nearby promoter, are,
in essence, pseudogenes as soon as they are inserted in the
genome ("dead-on-arrival" [36]), and begin accumulating
mutations faster than duplicated genes which remain
functional for a period of time after duplication. Therefore, the prevalence of pseudogenes of duplicated origin
might be accentuated by the fact that a portion of retrotransposed pseudogenes are too degenerated to be identified by our method, and we can not discard the possibility
that retrotransposed pseudogenes are more abundant in
the intergenic regions.

Pseudogenes are most abundant in fast-evolving gene
families involved in ubiquitination and secondary
metabolism
Several large rice families, such as the BTB/POZ or the
cytochrome P450 family are known to contain a large proportion of pseudogenes [26,37]. Gingerich et al.[26] identified 149 functional genes and 43 pseudogenes encoding
BTB proteins in rice, 20 of which were also identified by
our method. At least 99 pseudogenes for 328 functional
cytochrome P450s were identified in rice [37], and on a
smaller scale Itoh et al. [38] identified a pseudogene in a
cluster of rice ent-kaurene oxidase genes. Although, to our
knowledge, no terpene synthase or chalcone/stilbene synthase pseudogene has been reported in rice, a wholegenome survey of terpene synthases in Arabidopsis identified a core of 32 closely related terpene synthases and 8
pseudogenes [39]. There has also been reports of pseudogenes in the chalcone synthase family of Ipomoea [40], in
the Asteraceae genus Dendranthema [41] and in Trifolium

subterraneum [42]. The fact that results obtained through
our automated pipeline are consistent with manual annotation is additional evidence of the genuine nature of the
pseudogenes in our set.
Despite the fact that superfamilies such as the cytochrome
P450 or F-box proteins contain a high number of pseudogenes, the correlation between the number of pseudogenes per family and the size of the family was found to
be low (Figure 4). This apparent contradiction can be
explained by the high granularity of the set of paralogous
families used here. Proteins were separated into paralogous families based not only on PFAM domains but also
on uncharacterized domains identified through protein
alignments [31]. The low correlation between number of
pseudogenes and family size suggests that within a large
family, the pseudogenes are often circumscribed to a subfamily of proteins. A notable exception is the pseudogenes
associated with kinases. Based on GO term analysis, a
Page 9 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:317

kinase ancestral function can be attributed to 418 pseudogenes (60% of these with a GO term, Table 4). However,
these pseudogenes are distributed among a large number
of paralogous families characterized with a kinase
domain. As a consequence, none of these families was
found to contain a noticeably large number of pseudogenes.
The families containing a large number of pseudogenes
share functional and evolutionary characteristics. Collectively, terpene synthases catalyze the first committed step
to the several pathways producing primary compounds
such as gibberellins, carrotenoids as well as pathways that
produce a wide range of secondary compounds, many of
them expressed in response to pathogen attack [43]. Some
members of the cytochrome P450 family are involved in
the synthesis of gibberrellins, abscissic acid, brassinosteroids and many take part in the synthesis of phenylpropanoids (phytoalexins) [44]. Chalcone/stilbene synthases
are the gate-keepers of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, which lead to the synthesis of the anthocyanins
responsible for flower color as well as a variety of compounds with a role in plant pathogen interactions [45].
The BTB proteins are part of the BTB E3 ligase complex
and are responsible for the recognition of the targets to be
ubiquitinated, a role similar to that of the F-box proteins
in the SCF (Skp1p-cullin-F-box) E3 ligase complex [46].
Therefore, many families rich in pseudogenes participate
in the synthesis of defense compounds or in the recognition of molecules destined for degradation.
In addition, these families contain phylogenetic clusters
of lineage-specific genes. Such indication of recent expansion has been shown for the BTB/MATH branch of the
BTB proteins in rice, the branch that harbors the 20 BTB
pseudogenes that were identified in this study and Gingerich et al. [26]. Similar observations have been made for
the F-box proteins in rice [32,47]. Phylogenetic analyses
have shown that terpene synthases are more similar
within than across species, indicating that many functions
have evolved repeatedly in different species. The same is
true of the chalcone synthase family, which has been the
subject of tandem duplication in multiple species [40,48].
Finally, enzymatic plasticity has been reported for the terpene synthases and the chalcone synthases. Substitution
of a few amino acids in the catalytic site of chalcone synthase turns the enzyme into a stilbene synthase [48]. In
the terpene synthase family, a single amino acid difference
observed in the catalytic sites of two orthologs of kaurene
synthase in indica and japonica rice shifts the product outcome from ent-isokaur-15-ene, an intermediate in the synthesis of gibberellin to the secondary compound entpimara-8(14),15-diene [49]. Changes in vitro of a few
amino acids in the catalytic site of a diterpene synthase
from Norway spruce radically changes the reaction out-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/317

come from a single product (isopimaradiene) to several
(abietadiene, levopimaradiene, neoabietadiene and
palustradiene) [50].

Conclusion
We have identified 1,439 pseudogenes in the rice gene
complement for which an ORF is still detectable. A large
number of these pseudogenes are members of fast-evolving families in plants and have a role in the response to
biotic stresses and in ubiquitination. As plants adapt to a
changing environment and evolution of pathogens,
expanded subfamilies of genes involved in plant defense
may act as sandboxes from which some genes emerge as
advantageous and are subjected to positive selection while
some are not and become pseudogenes.

Methods
Selection of genes targeted for investigation and parent
genes
Parent genes and GPFs were identified within the Osa1
Release 5 gene complement [13]. All TE-related genes
were removed from the Osa1 Release 5 gene set and, in the
event of alternative splice forms, only the representative
gene model (with the longest coding region) was used.
This set of 41,046 genes was augmented with 734 genes
with CDS shorter than 50 amino-acids [51]. In total,
41,780 genes were used in this study.

The parent gene set (16,284 genes) was defined as genes
fully supported by ESTs or full-length cDNAs [13]. GPFs
were defined as: i) genes with no full-length cDNA or EST
support as specified in the feature file provided on the
Osa1 FTP site [51], ii) genes predicted to encode proteins
of less than 50 amino acids, iii) genes with 5' or/and 3'
UTRs over 2 standard deviations (SD) above the geometric mean UTR length as calculated on the log normal distribution of the UTR length (1,155 nt for 5' and 1,408 nt
for 3' UTR), or iv) 1- to 2-exon genes with the remnant of
a poly-A tail defined as at least 17 adenines in a stretch of
20 bases located between -200 and +1400 bp of the gene's
translational stop codon if the gene has no reported 3'
UTR, or between -200 and 400 bp of the 3' end of the gene
if the gene has a poly-A tail. These large windows were
based on the calculation of the mean + 2SD of 3' UTRs
and took into account that, for many genes, the extent of
the UTR has not been defined, and that the program used
in gene model construction tends to over-predict the
length of UTRs [9].
In addition, GPFs were also selected in segmentally duplicated regions by examining pairs of non-TE related paralogous genes [21]. The mean and SD of the difference in
exon number in the coding region between duplicated
genes were calculated to be 0 and 1.98, respectively. Mean
and standard deviation of the difference in the protein
length between the two members in each pair were calcuPage 10 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:317

lated to be 0 and 137 amino acids, respectively. Pairs, for
which the absolute difference in length or exon number
was above 2*SD were selected for further analysis with the
longest gene in the pair hypothesized to be the parent
gene, and the shortest the gene targeted for investigation.
Finally, non-TE single-exon genes located in segmentally
duplicated regions that lacked a duplicate gene were targeted for investigation.
BLAST searches
With the exception of the genes in the segmentally duplicated category which, by definition, have a pre-determined parent, parent genes were identified by alignment
of the 16,284 fully-supported genes annotated in Osa1
Release 5 to the genomic sequence of the GPFs, hereafter
referred to as Locus Targeted for Investigation (LTIs, see
Additional file 2). A LTI was defined as the genomic
sequence of a GPF with a buffer of 100 bases flanking the
GPF (see Additional file 2). The parent gene set was
searched, using TBLASTN, against all the LTIs (with the
exception of short genes in segmentally duplicated
regions for which the long paralog is the parent) with E
value < 10-10 and identity cut-off ≥ 40% [17]. The BLAST
results were parsed using a set of perl scripts to identify the
best non-overlapping aligning protein(s) to each candidate region. Similar to PseudoPipe [16], the alignments of
a single protein to a LTI were "merged" into super-alignments by recording the left-most and right-most coordinates of all the alignments for the subject-query pair.
Overlapping and redundant super-alignments from different proteins were then resolved by selecting the multiexon protein comprising the alignment with the smallest
E-value as the putative parent gene for that sub-region. In
this manner, a LTI can be paired with more than one
group of non-overlapping alignments which could lead to
several parent genes and hence several pseudogenes [16].
Multi-exon genes with less homology to the LTI were
given precedence over single-exon genes due to the possibility that single-exon gene parent might themselves be of
retrotransposed origin [10]. In cases where no alignment
was derived from multi-exon genes, the protein with the
smallest E value was selected as the parent.
Global alignment of loci targeted for investigation to
parent genes
The coordinates of the LTI were recalculated so that the
alignment determined by BLAST was at the center and
flanked on each side by a genomic region three times the
size of the putative parent protein. This adjustment permitted more optimal global alignment of the putative parent in instances when the latter aligned only partially and
to the extremity of the candidate region in the BLAST step.

The global alignment tool GeneWise [52] was used to
determine the best parent-derived model that could be
constructed in the LTI by aligning the parent gene to that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/317

region. GeneWise was chosen due to its allowance of stop
codons and frameshifts in the predicted model, and therefore its ability to predict putative pseudogenes. Parentderived models covering at least 70% of their respective
parent protein and containing at least one disablement
(frameshift or premature stop codon) were termed pseudogenes (see Additional file 2). The pseudogene proteins
and nucleotide sequences, number of exons in the coding
region of the parent proteins and pseudogenes, number of
frameshifts and stop codons in the pseudogenes, length of
the pseudogenes and parent proteins were derived from
the GeneWise output.
Substitution rate ratio in the pseudogenes
Parent genes and pseudogenes were aligned using CLUSTALW [53] with the default parameters. A maximum likelihood estimate of the synonymous substitution rate Ks
(dS, number of synonymous substitution per synonymous
site) and the nonsynonymous substitution rate Ka (dN,
number of nonsynonymous substitution per nonsynonymous site) was calculated using the PAML 3.15 codeml
package, running in pairwise mode (runmode = -2), with
the equilibrium codon frequencies calculated from the
average nucleotide frequencies at the three codon positions (CodonFreq = 2) [54]. The Ka/Ks ratios of paralogous genes in segmentally duplicated regions [21] which
were not candidate pseudogenes were calculated in the
same manner. The difference in the distribution of the
log(Ka/Ks) in the control and the pseudogene set was estimated using a Welch two-sample t-test with unequal variance as implemented in the R function t. test. Only
alignments longer than 100 amino acids and with nonsaturated Ks (Ks < 2) were used in the analysis.
Pseudogene expression
Expression of the pseudogenes was inferred from MPSS
data from 22 libraries [25] using previous mapping of 17
and 20-bp MPSS tags to the rice genome [13]. A gene or
pseudogene was annotated as transcribed when at least
one MPSS tag mapped uniquely and entirely to an exon.
Average count per million for each tag was calculated as
the sum of the counts per million in each library, as provided by the Rice MPSS database [25]. In cases where several tags mapped to a gene, the tag with the maximum
frequency was selected to represent the expression of the
gene.
Pseudogene function
GOSlim terms were assigned to Osa1 Release 5 genes
based on sequence similarity to Arabidopsis genes as
described previously [13]. Each pseudogene was attributed the GOSlim term(s) of its corresponding parent
gene, since the parent gene is the closest representation of
the ancestral gene from which the pseudogene arose. Relative frequencies of each GOSlim term in the Osa1
Release 5 gene set versus the pseudogene set were calcuPage 11 of 13

lated and over-representation of GOSlim terms was determined based on the Fisher's exact test, as implemented in
the R fisher. test function. Only genes with at least one
GOSlim term were taken into consideration in the calculation.

In order to obtain a more granular view of the pseudogenes' ancestral function, we examined the distribution of
the pseudogenes in paralogous families, as classified by
Lin et al. [31]. As in the GOSlim analysis, each pseudogene
was assigned to the paralogous family of its parent. All
GPFs for which a pseudogene was identified were
removed from the paralogous families, so that only one
gene or pseudogene per locus was counted. For each family, a count of the numbers of genes and pseudogenes was
obtained.

Definitions used in this article. Genes with Pseudogene Features (GPF,
in blue) were identified first. The corresponding loci, with flanking buffer
regions were termed Locus Targeted for Investigation (LTI, thick black
lines). Parent genes were identified by searching fully-supported genes
against the LTIs. The parent-derived models were created by re-aligning
each parent gene to the corresponding LTI with GeneWise. Pseudogenes
were defined as parent-derived models with disablements (thick red vertical lines) and covering at least 70% of the parent protein.
