Abstract
Background: Reliable and consistent methods are required for the identification and classification
of freshwater snails belonging to the genus Bulinus (Gastropoda, Planorbidae) which act as
intermediate hosts for schistosomes of both medical and veterinary importance. The current
project worked towards two main objectives, the development of a cost effective, simple screening
method for the routine identification of Bulinus isolates and the use of resultant sequencing data to
produce a model of relationships within the group.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequence for a large section (1009 bp) of the
mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) for isolates of Bulinus demonstrated
superior resolution over that employing the second internal transcribed spacer (its2) of the
ribosomal gene complex. Removal of transitional substitutions within cox1 because of saturation
effects still allowed identification of snails at species group level. Within groups, some species could
be identified with ease but there were regions where the high degree of molecular diversity meant
that clear identification of species was problematic, this was particularly so within the B. africanus
group.
Conclusion: The sequence diversity within cox1 is such that a barcoding approach may offer the
best method for characterization of populations and species within the genus from different
geographical locations. The study has confirmed the definition of some accepted species within the
species groups but additionally has revealed some unrecognized isolates which underlines the need
to use molecular markers in addition to more traditional methods of identification. A barcoding
approach based on part of the cox1 gene as defined by the Folmer primers is proposed.

Background
Freshwater snails belonging to the genus Bulinus act as
intermediate hosts in the life cycle of the widespread and
debilitating parasitic disease schistosomiasis in Africa,
Madagascar and adjacent regions (see Fig. 1). Schistosome
species within the S. haematobium group which depend on
snails from Bulinus for transmission include three human

pathogens (S. haematobium, S. intercalatum and S. guiniensis) and five others which may infect wild and domestic
ruminants (S. bovis, S. curassoni, S. mattheei, S. leiperi and
S. margrebowiei). The relationship and interaction
between schistosomes and snails is very specific and compatibility may differ over quite small geographical ranges
[1]. A reliable taxonomy of the genus Bulinus is a fundaPage 1 of 15

mental prerequisite for understanding the epidemiology
of this disease.
The thirty six species within the genus have been placed
into four species 'groups' [2]; the B. africanus group, B. forskalii group, B. reticulatus group and the B. truncatus/tropicus complex. For the most part, species have been
classified on the basis of their morphology although, in
recent decades, the study of ploidy [3], allozymes [4-6]
and DNA methods [7-13] have all played an increasing
role in species discrimination. Morphological characters,
whilst adequate to allocate a specimen to a species group
are sometimes unreliable when used to classify at higher
resolution [8,10] especially within the B. africanus group.
Consequently, there is a requirement for a robust system
of identification and classification to supplement more
traditional approaches. The data presented here represent
initial steps towards achieving consistency and uniformity
in the identification process. Nuclear (its2) and mitochondrial (cox1) sequences are compared with respect to their
ability to resolve species and species group relationships
within Bulinus and cox1 is used to screen 81 isolates and
place them in a phylogenetic context.

Methods
Samples
The available samples selected for study represented as
diverse a group as possible within the genus Bulinus and
comprised of both collected and donated material that
took the form of specimens from the field and maintained
cultures which were stored in liquid nitrogen, ethanol or
used fresh (Table 1). Those specimens preserved in ethanol were left in TE buffer pH 7.4 overnight in order to per-

Extraction of genomic/mitochondrial DNA
Total genomic DNA was extracted from whole snail tissue
in a manner similar to that outlined by Stothard et al [7]
with minor modification. Snail tissue was homogenized
in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris, 1.4 M NaCl, 16 mM EDTA,
2% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide [CTAB]). To
this was added 20 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and the
whole mixed in a rotisserie incubator at 55°C for 1.5 to
2.0 hours. Subsequently, an equal volume of chloroform/
isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added to the digest and gently
mixed. Tubes containing the digest were then spun at
13,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The upper aqueous layer was
removed using 'wide bore' pipette tips and nucleic acids
were precipitated in 'Analar' grade absolute ethanol. Following precipitation for 15 minutes at -20°C, the DNA
was centrifuged again at 13,000 rpm to form a pellet. The
absolute ethanol was removed and the pellet washed in
70% ethanol before a final centrifugation at 13,000 rpm.
The ethanol was then discarded and the pellet dried in a
dry heating block at 90°C for 5 minutes before dissolution in an appropriate amount of purified water.
Amplification of cox1 and its2 fragments
The partial cox1 fragment was amplified in one, two or
more sections from the mitochondrial component of
extracted total genomic DNA using the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and various combinations of the primers
that are shown in Table 2 (see additional file 1, for PCR
and sequencing primers that proved successful with particular isolates and Fig. 2 for approximate primer locations). Amplicons of its2 were generated in a single section
using two primers ETTS1 and ETTS10 (see Table 2). Either
an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 2400 or
2700 thermal cycler were used throughout the project in
combination with GE Healthcare 'Ready-To-Go' PCR
beads. Upon reconstitution with an appropriate volume
of template, primer and pure water to a total of 25 μl, each
dissolved bead forms a solution containing 200 μM of
each dNTP, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl and 1.5 mM of
MgCl2. Cycling conditions for both cox1 and its2 PCR
reactions were as follows: one cycle of 94°C for 5 min, 45
cycles of 94°C for 15 sec, 40°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 45
sec (in the case of cox1 this was increased to 1 min for
amplicons over 1000 bp) and a final single cycle of 72°C
for 7 min. PCR fragments were separated on a 1% agarose
gel and bands were excised using a scalpel blade. The
recovered DNA was purified for sequencing using a
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Following quantification and a check for purity with a Nanodrop ND-1000
Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies Inc),
sequencing reactions were performed directly on each
PCR product using an Applied Biosystems Big Dye Kit ver-

sion 1.1 and run on an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA
Analyzer. Resultant electropherograms were checked and
cox1/its2 sequences edited using Sequencher 4.6 software
(Gene Codes Corporation).
Phylogenetic analysis of sequence data
Following basic editing and analysis of compiled cox1 and
its2 sequences on Sequencher 4.6, the sequences were
used to perform BLAST searches [14] via the National
Center for Biotechnology Information against GenBank
and EMBL sequence databases in order to ensure that parasitic and other potential contaminant sequences had not
been obtained in error. Sequences were then aligned and
analysed using MEGA 3.1 [15] where alignment was
undertaken using Clustal W [16]. The cox1 data for all taxa
were analysed solely as nucleotides and subject to analysis
by both Neighbour-Joining and Minimum Evolution
methods using Kimura's 2 parameter model (K2P) for
pair-wise distance calculations as this accommodates the
difference in the rate of accumulation between transitions
and transversions. The Minimum Evolution algorithm
employed Close-Neighbour-Interchange (CNI – level 1)
to explore the most optimal topology with the initial,
temporary tree obtained by Neighbour-Joining. All gaps
were deleted from the dataset using the 'complete deletion' option in MEGA 3.1 and the invertebrate mitochondrial code was used throughout. Nucleotide sequence
data for its2 was analysed in a similar manner except that
p-distance was employed instead of K2P.

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/15

The different forms of analysis were subject to bootstrapping (1000 repeats) as a means of testing the reliability of
individual branches within the generated tree. Biomphalaria glabrata was used as an outgroup taxon upon which
to root the structures. Sequence saturation for cox1 was
visualized graphically, using the program DAMBE [17]
that allows the number of differences between isolates or
species in terms of transitional and transversional substitutions to be plotted against pair-wise distance values.
Sequences have been submitted to the EMBL database and
have accession numbers [EMBL:AM286284 to
AM286318, EMBL:AM921806 to AM921851 (cox1) and
EMBL:AM921961 to AM921990 (its2)].

Results
Analysis of its2 sequence data
Twenty nine samples were selected for sequencing of an
amplicon containing the 3' end of the 5.8S gene and the
entire its2 region. This was undertaken in order to compare the phylogenetic signal of a nuclear marker with that
of cox1 (see Fig. 3). Both loci were able to discriminate the
4 species groups in a Neighbour-Joining tree. The B. forskalii, B. reticulatus and B. truncatus/tropicus species groups
resolved well, the main point of difference being F52
which in the its2 tree had closer affinity with the East African B. forskalii group snails. The B. africanus group within
the its2 tree had short branch lengths with poor resolution
and bootstrap values. Clear discrimination between B.

nasutus nasutus and B. nasutus productus was not possible
using the its2 data and sequence differences in this region
are unlikely to be of value for the detection of hybridization events among isolates with overlapping geographic
ranges. The its2 sequence data for B. wrighti were unusual
in having two unique insertions relative to other Bulinus
isolates, a short 16 bp insertion between fragment positions 219 and 234 and a larger 63 bp insertion between
positions 248 and 310.
Analysis of cox1 sequence data
The sequence of the mitochondrial cox1 gene within Bulinus was found to be highly variable. The nucleotide composition regarding this genus was AT rich (69.4%) which
is in close agreement with previous work [12]. In order to
test which areas of the cox1 amplicon gave the best phylogenetic signal, the fragment was analysed in its entirety,
using the first 644 bp and also the final 387 bp. Stothard
and Rollinson [9] and Jones et al [12] used the latter section of the cox1 sequence and this corresponds to the
region encompassed by primers Asmit1 (AT1) and Asmit2
(AT2) shown in Fig. 2. The first 644 bp covers an area
comparable to the sequence bounded by the Folmer primers LCO1490 (CO1) and HCO2198 (CO2) [18] and
which has been used previously for barcoding studies
[19]. Figure 4 shows three Neighbour-Joining trees generated for each region using both transitional and transversional substitutions. Resolution of the tree improves as
progressively longer stretches of sequence are included in
the analysis. However, saturation analysis of the 'Asmit'

and 'Folmer' regions show that both are subject to saturation of transitional events suggesting that inclusion of
transversional substitutions only in the calculation would
present a more accurate estimate of isolate relationships
within the genus. Figure 5 shows a graph where mean,
pair-wise genetic distances of the two areas calculated
from transversional substitutions only are compared with
the corresponding distance matrix co-ordinates for the
complete fragment. In this manner, the variability of
genetic distance figures for the 'Asmit' and 'Folmer'
regions relative to the complete fragment may be shown.
For small genetic distance values correspondence is good
between the three regions, however, as distances increase
in size those associated with the 'Asmit' fragment tend to
drift away from the corresponding complete sequence
derived genetic distance values within the mid-range of
the 'x' axis. Distances of the 'Folmer' region also exhibit a
degree of variation when compared with those of the
complete fragment but to a smaller extent. Additionally, a
short span of genetic distance values between approximately 0.058 and 0.064 is entirely missing within the
dataset. To a lesser degree this is reflected in a smaller
region between 0.013 and 0.018. Figure 6 shows the same
procedure undertaken for transitional substitutions where
correspondence of distance values for the 'Asmit' and 'Folmer' areas again 'drifts' with increasing genetic distance
relative to the complete fragment. However, whilst the
overall number of pairs contributing to each distance figure is considerably less than in Fig. 5, the numerical variation of distance values present in the matrices is far

greater, particularly between the ranges 0.035 to 0.077.
Neighbour-Joining and Minimum Evolution trees were
therefore generated for the dataset using transversions
from the complete fragment sequence in order to obtain
the maximum resolution possible. The resultant trees contained divisions corresponding to the four species groups
(see Figs 7 &8).

Discussion
B. africanus species group
Classification within this complex is probably the most
difficult of the four Bulinus snail species groups. The cox1
sequence data for samples within this group revealed an
extensive degree of genetic variation throughout the continent (see the designation 'A' in Figs 7 &8). There are
three areas within the data set that may be used as reference points for interpretation of Figs 7 &8. The first is
identified by sample code A23, a snail from Kinyasini,
Unguja, which on the basis of previous work [8,9,20], represents the species known as B. globosus. The second are
samples of B. africanus, from South Africa, namely, A28

and A29 and the third are those specimens labelled A35 to
A40 and A41 to A51 representing B. nasutus productus and
B. nasutus nasutus, respectively. The split of B. nasutus into
two subspecies as recognised previously [2] may be clearly
seen in Figs 7 &8 with B. nasutus productus being represented by samples from inland sites in Uganda and Tanzania and B. nasutus nasutus present in coastal Kenya and
the Islands of Unguja, Pemba and Mafia. The molecular
data support the view that these forms are closely related
species and it would seem acceptable to consider them as
B. productus and B. nasutus.
One of the most interesting facts to emerge is the division
between samples of B. globosus from West and East Africa
and the rather surprising finding that B. africanus has
closer affinities to the West African B. globosus samples. B.
globosus has the greatest geographical range of any member of this species group and it does seem that greater
attention must be given to specific status and distribution.
The cox1 barcode for B. africanus may be helpful in discriminating snails where species overlap especially when

morphological differences are often difficult to determine,
hence samples A9 and A10 identified as B. globosus can be
distinguished from A28 and A29, B. africanus. The two
species differ in the penis sheath, which is bigger in B. africanus being longer and/or thicker than the preputium [2]
but such characters have been found unreliable for species
discrimination [10].
Kenyan specimens from the Kisumu region used by Raahauge and Kristensen [10] have been included in the
present study (A11 to A13 & A33). Utilizing RAPD profiles and PCR-RFLP results, these authors concluded that
those samples labelled in Figs 7 &8 as A11 to A13 all
appeared to be local variants of the same species and this
conclusion is confirmed in the present analysis with all of
the snails identified as B. globosus. In addition, they also
showed that another sample screened in their study (ADC
farm, Kisumu), labelled in Figs 7 &8 as A33, was different

from the other Kisumu specimens and this has also been
supported.
B. forskalii species group
The group as a whole splits into two main sections,
namely, snails from West Africa i.e. Cameroon, Bukina
Faso, Niger, Senegal, São Tomé and Angola (F53 to F58)
and those from the eastern side, East Kenya, Pemba, Mafia
and Mauritius (F59 to 65). Additionally, isolate F52 from
Uganda although sharing a common ancestor with East
and West African B. forskalii group isolates, is quite distinct from the other species. However, only one specimen
has been examined and more samples from this locality in
Uganda are required for further study. The its2 tree
showed F52 to have a closer relationship with East African
members of the B. forskalii group. Within this group certain isolates are of known species and can be used as reference points, namely F58, which is B. forskalii, F61 and
F62 both being B. cernicus from Mauritius and F63 to F65

from Pemba and Mafia considered by the authors as B.
barthi.
Fewer isolates of the B. forskalii group have been tested
and analysed as compared with the B. africanus group and
so it might be imprudent to draw too many specific conclusions from the data. However, using fifteen allozyme
loci from B. camerunensis, B. forskalii and B. senegalensis,
Mimpfoundi & Greer [6] could find no differences
between the two former species and suggested that the
validity of B. camerunensis as a separate species might be
open to question. Jones et al [12] used ITS1, RAPDs and
cox1 to show that B. camerunensis clustered unequivocally
with B. forskalii confirming that the taxonomic position of
B. camerunensis is debatable. Only a single example of this
species was available for our analysis (F53) although it
came from the same area as that examined in Mimpfoundi's paper, namely, Lake Barombi, Kotto. The isolate
shared genetic characteristics with B. forskalii from other

West African countries such as Burkina Faso (F54) and
Niger (F55), re-emphasising its questionable taxonomic
status.
Bulinus forskalii from the island of São Tomé (F57) is
responsible for the transmission of S. guiniensis and in this
analysis grouped most closely to B. forskalii (F58) from
Angola with both being well differentiated from other
West African B. forskalii. Brown [21] was of the opinion
that it was appropriate to identify the snails from São
Tomé as extreme conchological variants of B. forskalii.
Interestingly, in the analysis of Jones et al [12]B. forskalii
from São Tomé clustered with B. crystallinus also from
Angola. There is a need to sample and characterize more
thoroughly B. forskalii group snails from Angola to assess
their relationship with snails from São Tomé and West
Africa as it appears that there may be more than one species involved.

B. cernicus from the island of Mauritius was once regarded
as a form of B. forskalii, however, significant morphological differences with the latter were noted [2]. The current
data reinforces the view that B. cernicus should be considered a separate species from both B. forskalii and B. barthi.
Isolates F59 and F60 are also distinct from B. forskalii, B.
barthi and B. cernicus. Stothard et al [22] sequenced the
short 'Asmit' region for a snail collected from Mafia Island
(SF369612). Although covering only a third of the current
sequence for F59 and F60 the corresponding data match
exactly and imply that this particular un-named Bulinus
species is present in Pemba, Mafia and also East Kenya.
B. truncatus/tropicus species group
Both Figs 7 and 8 confirm the position of B. nyassanus in
the B. truncatus/tropicus complex and this species together
with the cluster comprising B. tropicus, B. natalensis and B.
truncatus appear to derive from a common ancestor. However, the conjecture by Nascetti & Bullini [5] that possible
hybridization between B. tropicus and B. natalensis might
have given rise to B. truncatus cannot be confirmed by the
Minimum Evolution tree (Fig. 8). The observation by
Brown [2] that there were indications of a "significant biological difference" between B. tropicus and B. natalensis is
supported. The cluster representing B. truncatus in Figs 7
&8 has very short branch lengths implying that the
hybridization event which Goldman et al. [3] suggested
gave rise to this tetraploid is a relatively recent phenomenon.
B. reticulatus group
There are only two recognised species within this group and
it has only been possible to examine one of them, B. wrighti.
This species has a characteristic cox1 sequence which positions the group close to the B. truncatus/tropicus complex.
Barcoding
The sequence information presented here is not a typical
'barcode' in so far as the sequence is longer than most barcodes which are usually around 650 bp in length
[19,23,24]. Moreover, the generated PCR fragments have
been amplified and sequenced using a wide variety of different primers due to the highly variable nature of the
sequence. A pan-species group/isolate barcode in the
usual 'sense' might be possible to locate but requires a
common set of primers to be designed which will amplify
all species within the genus for a particular cox1 region
and that the area so determined mirrors the results generated by the current longer sequence. For this reason, a
Neighbour-Joining tree (Fig. 9) has been generated for the
area of Bulinus cox1 which corresponds approximately
with the 'Folmer' barcode region. Agreement of Fig. 9 with
Figs 7 &8 whilst not identical is very close and provides
hope that this region could be used for barcoding Bulinus
species in future.

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/15

The advantages [19] and disadvantages [25] over the use
of barcoding, and the utilization of a single mitochondrial
gene such as cox1 for identification and phylogenetic purposes have been the subject of considerable debate. It is
accepted that a range of both nuclear and mitochondrial
markers are required to provide a more accurate estimate
of evolutionary history. However, a technique for routine
screening which is relatively quick, cost effective and
reproducible is essential given that resources are limited.
The selected area of sequence from the cox1 gene appears
to achieve this by forming a framework upon which a classification can begin to be constructed. Previous studies
have used cox1 in the phylogenetic evaluation of Bulinus,
namely, Stothard & Rollinson [9], Stothard et al. [11] and
Jones et al. [12] and, in this respect, the current project is
not unique, however, the sequences used in the present
paper are three times the length of those previously
employed and the range of Bulinus isolates/species much
more extensive. The study is ongoing and undoubtedly as
more taxa are acquired and sequences added to the database, the shape of the Neighbour-Joining and Minimum
Evolution trees as shown in Figs 7 &8 will progressively
alter and become more informative.
