Abstract
Background: The shape of phylogenetic trees has been used to make inferences about the
evolutionary process by comparing the shapes of actual phylogenies with those expected under
simple models of the speciation process. Previous studies have focused on speciation events, but
gene duplication is another lineage splitting event, analogous to speciation, and gene loss or deletion
is analogous to extinction. Measures of the shape of gene family phylogenies can thus be used to
investigate the processes of gene duplication and loss. We make the first systematic attempt to use
tree shape to study gene duplication using human gene phylogenies.
Results: We find that gene duplication has produced gene family trees significantly less balanced
than expected from a simple model of the process, and less balanced than species phylogenies: the
opposite to what might be expected under the 2R hypothesis.
Conclusion: While other explanations are plausible, we suggest that the greater imbalance of gene
family trees than species trees is due to the prevalence of tandem duplications over regional
duplications during the evolution of the human genome.

Background
Most phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary history
of groups of organisms, with the leaves representing species (or higher taxa) and internal nodes representing speciation events. In contrast, molecular phylogenies for gene
families (e.g. figure 1a) usually display sequences for different orthologous groups of proteins [1] from one or
more species. These trees can thus show a complicated
tapestry of orthology and paralogy, and nodes on such
trees may represent either gene duplications or speciations
(figure 1, [2]): both are splitting events, producing daughter lineages that henceforth have independent evolutionary histories (at least in the absence of gene conversion or
introgression [3]). This similarity between gene duplica-

tion and speciation allows similar tools to be used to
study the two analogous processes, and techniques developed to investigate speciation and extinction may give
some insight into the pattern of gene duplication and
gene loss [4,5].
Tree shape has been used to make inferences about the
processes of speciation and extinction that govern the
birth and death of organismal lineages [6]. We can similarly investigate the processes of gene duplication and
gene loss, or deletion, on phylogenies where all the nodes
represent gene duplication events, such as those containing homologous genes from a single genome (figure 1). In
particular, gene sequences from a completely sequenced

due either to errors in phylogenetic reconstruction or bias
in data collection. Previous work has found that poorly
supported maximum-parsimony trees tend to be less balanced than well-supported ones [10], while UPGMA (and
presumably other distance-based) trees change little in
balance despite being as prone to error as parsimony trees
[11], while It seems likely that there is no significant difference between the two for fairly robust data [12]. Mooers [10] demonstrated that complete trees (that include all
extant members of a taxon) are more balanced than
incomplete trees, as expected if taxon selection across a set
of trees is clumped [13]. A second category of explanations claim that deviation from the ERM model accurately
reflects that the speciation process is more complex than
this model allows. More complex (and perhaps more realistic) models of the speciation and extinction process have
been proposed by a number of authors, including Heard
[14] and Kirkpatrick & Slatkin [15], who both propose
models in which diversification rates evolve through time,
producing unbalanced trees, although extremely high rate
variation is required to produce the degree of imbalance
observed in real data.

(a) Tree balance, bias and macroevolution
Much of the large literature on tree shape has focused on
the balance of trees – how 'comb-like' or 'bush-like' the
tree is, ignoring branch length information. In particular,
a great deal of work has investigated how the balance of
real phylogenies matches that expected under more-orless simple models of the speciation process [6]. The simplest realistic model is the Equal-Rate Markov model
(ERM) or Yule model [7]. Under the ERM model, every
lineage has an identical and constant rate of splitting to
form new lineages (the actual rate of splitting has no
effect). This is often contrasted with the proportional-todistinguishable arrangements (PDA) model [8], under
which every different labelled tree is equally probable.
The PDA model may not be realistic [6,9], but is useful
because it represents the case in which a tree-building
method is selecting randomly from all possible trees.
Many models are relaxations of the assumptions of the
ERM model, while inaccurate estimation will bias tree
shape towards the PDA model.

(b) Duplication mechanisms and tree balance
While accurate modelling of species trees has proved complex, the gene duplication process is likely to be even
more complicated. Gene duplications within a single gene
family are not always independent events, as duplications
can occur by a number of different molecular mechanisms
[[16] pp. 89–109], some of which copy large quantities of
DNA in a single event – duplication by polysomy (the
multiplication of a single chromosome pair) and polyploidy (the multiplication of the entire genome) will copy
many or all genes in a genome. There is substantial evidence [17,18] that two rounds of whole-genome duplication occurred early in vertebrate evolution (the "2R
hypothesis" [16,19]). Duplication of multiple members
of a gene family by a single event of these kinds will produce more symmetrical trees than expected under the
ERM model if other duplication has occurred at a constant
rate (figure 2), or at least shift trees towards greater balance than the underlying process. An equivalent suggestion has been made that balanced species trees may be
produced by "synchronous speciation caused by vicariance events that affect most or all of the species in a clade"
[15], but whereas large-scale gene duplication is known to
occur in a range of different groups, sufficiently large biogeographic events are likely to be rather rare.

Previous investigations of tree shape have established that
empirical phylogenetic trees are significantly more unbalanced than expected under the ERM model [6]. A number
of different explanations for this have been put forward,
falling into two categories. The first set of explanations
claim that this deviation from the null model is an artefact

Another peculiarity of gene duplication will have the
opposite effect on tree balance, tending to produce less
balanced trees. Tandem gene duplications, where a piece
of DNA is duplicated adjacent to the original copy, will
produce arrays of related genes, such as observed in the
developmental Hox gene clusters of metazoans [20].

genome allow inferences about the process of deletion to
be made without confounding this with the absence of a
gene from the sequence databases.

ancient episodes of genome duplication (as shown in d). Recent duplications leave a larger signal in Im values, despite Im giving
higher weight to basal branches [43].

These repeats of similar sequence will themselves tend to
increase the rate at which illegitimate meiotic recombination occurs, and so lead to further tandem duplications
[[16] pp. 62–64]. While we know of no suitable quantitative evidence from gene family arrays, this process certainly occurs in minisatellites [21]. Any tendency for the
rate of duplication to increase following a duplication will
produce unbalanced tree topologies (see figure 3) – it is
the opposite situation to that modelled by Losos & Adler
[22]. In fact, the problem is rather more complex than
this, as only a small proportion of possible tree shapes
could actually represent the history of tandem-duplicated
genes. While techniques for randomly generating these

trees are available [23], it is not clear what the equivalents
to the PDA and ERM distributions are for tandem duplication trees.
(c) Shape of gene family phylogenies
In this paper, we make an initial attempt to use tree balance to make inferences about the process of gene duplication. We compare the imbalance of trees for human
gene families with expectations from the ERM model and
with the imbalance of species phylogenies collated by
other workers. This latter comparison is useful because of
the uncertainty surrounding how tree construction might
affect balance: to the extent that both are constructed from

similar data, differences between the balance of gene trees
and species trees will be due to differences in the branching processes of duplication and speciation. We can effectively use the species tree data as an informal control to
highlight whether the balance of gene trees requires explanation in terms of the mechanism of gene duplication.
Previous work on the imbalance of gene family trees
looked exclusively at using four-member gene families to
test the 2R hypothesis. In the absence of other duplication
and gene deletion, two consecutive genome duplications
should amplify a single gene into a 4-member gene family
with a perfectly balanced tree topology [24,25]. Hughes
[25] and Martin [24] both found that most 4-member
gene families are unbalanced, and hence rejected the 2R
hypothesis. Our dataset enables us to put these earlier
results in context by comparison with gene families of
other sizes.

Results
The single-linkage clustering approach divided the protein-coding genes from the human genome into 17,908
gene families (including families of a single gene, see
methods). The distribution of gene family sizes was consistent with previous work [26]. Trees were constructed for
1,265 gene families with reasonable alignments for more
than 3 members. Colless's index is undefined for polytomous trees, and 550 trees were excluded because they contained at least one zero-length internal branch, leaving a
total dataset of 715 gene families.
Figure 4 shows the imbalance of our trees in comparison
with expected values under the ERM and PDA models.

Clearly, gene family trees are more unbalanced than
expected under the ERM model but substantially more
balanced than expected under the PDA model. This can be
confirmed for the ERM model because the individual pIm
scores can be combined using Fisher's method to yield an
overall p-value that the trees have been drawn from an
ERM distribution [[27] pp.794–797], which is significantly rejected for our data (χ2 = 1693.9, df = 1430, P <
0.0001). A test of shape for unrooted trees [28] confirms
that the gene family trees are significantly less balanced
than expected under the ERM and do not fit the PDA distribution, showing that these results are not simply due to
the rooting information (for ERM, 1-tailed test, χ2 =
2456.4, df = 1430, P < 0.0001; for PDA, 2-tailed test, χ2 =
2120.6, df = 1430, P < 0.0001).
Gene family data were compared with existing datasets of
species phylogenies using GLMs as described in Methods.
These data support the finding of Stam [29] that transformed pIm scores are not independent of tree size. Using
the categorical models as described, our data were found
to be significantly more unbalanced than real trees for two
out of three incomplete-tree datasets for which full information was available [30] (for Harcourt-Brown 2002 data

scores with number of leaves and dataset as factors:
Nleaves (number of taxa) F = 12.038, df = 34/814, P <

dataset as factors: Nleaves F = 14.962, df = 27/814, P <

Heard 1992 data [249 trees], GLM of arcsine-transformed
pIm scores with number of leaves and dataset as factors:
Nleaves F = 22.992, df = 19/963, P < 0.0001, dataset F =
6.470, df = 1/963, P = 0.0111). Imbalance measures for all
of these sets of trees are shown on figure 4. The only dataset that is not significantly different from our gene family
trees by this test is that of morphological trees from Harcourt-Brown [31]. This is probably because half of the
trees from this dataset include fossil taxa, which make
these trees more unbalanced than trees containing only
contemporaneous leaves [31].
Data for complete trees was available from two different
compilations [10,29]. Comparison with Mooers [10] data
is difficult as neither topologies or Im scores for individual
trees were available, but our gene family trees are more
unbalanced than the ones compiled by Mooers (median
pIm scores for his data, with Nleaves from 8–14, is 0.429,
gene family trees of 8–14 leaves,152 trees with median pIm
score 0.246). Stam [29] collected a larger set of 69 complete species trees, including larger trees than Mooers. A
statistical test as above confirms that human gene family
trees show significantly less balance than the trees col-

For all the GLMs summarised above, there was no significant interaction between tree size and dataset, so the interaction term was not included in any analysis. Treating tree
size as continuous, an 8th-order polynomial was needed
to model the relationship between tree size and pIm (terms
up to the 8th power of Nleaves were significant, terms
with higher powers were not). These analyses gave identical results to those reported above (treating tree size,
Nleaves, as categorical) in that it made no difference to the
significance or otherwise of any terms in the models, and

confirms the direction of the effect – that gene family trees
are less balanced than species trees.
For four-member gene families, 215 out of 293 gene families, or 73%, are unbalanced, while two-thirds of such
trees should be unbalanced under the ERM model. Tests
based on pIm scores have little power for small gene families, but a binomial test confirms that significantly more
trees are unbalanced than the ERM expectation (n = 293,
prob. = 2/3, P = 0.0055), reflecting the general trend of
human gene family trees.

Discussion
Human gene family phylogenies are more unbalanced
than species trees compiled from the literature and than

expected under the ERM model, suggesting that the process of gene duplication occurs similarly, but not identically, to that of speciation. This difference in balance may
be due to different biases acting on gene trees than on species trees. Taxon sampling seems unlikely to be the explanation as our gene family trees are complete (they sample
all extant genes in the human genome) and our gene family trees are more unbalanced than complete species trees.
The difference between our trees and published cladograms is unlikely to be due to differences between morphological and molecular data as our trees are less balanced
than a compilation of molecular trees [30] and studies
have found no significant difference between the balance
of trees from morphological and molecular data [30,32].
It seems that the imbalance of gene family trees demands
a mechanistic rather than methodological explanation.
Many differences between the processes of gene duplication and speciation might explain the different shapes of
the trees produced and, in principle, any of the models
that have been invoked to explain deviations of observed
species trees from ERM expectations could be acting on
gene duplications to a greater extent. For example, if the
model of evolving rates suggested by Heard [14] applied
to duplication rates with greater variation than for speciation rates, this would predict the sort of difference
observed. It is unclear what molecular mechanism could
cause this. Given that the processes of regional, large-scale
gene duplication and tandem duplication through recombination are known to occur in genomes, we interpret our
results in terms of these mechanistic models.
Seen in this light, the high imbalance of gene family trees
suggests that large-scale duplication has not played a sufficiently large role in gene family evolution to leave any
signal in the cladistic balance of gene family trees, or that
the rate of gene shuffling after tandem duplication is high
enough to move duplicated genes apart before regional
duplication occurs [33]. The continuous process of duplication and loss that appears to have occurred during the
evolution of many genomes [4,34] produces highly
imbalanced gene family trees. Our data do not provide a
powerful test of the 2R hypothesis, as gene deletion may
have erased any trace of this event from many of our gene
families, particularly if massive gene loss quickly followed
the polyploidy events [35]. Similarly, it is not surprising
that the balance of four-taxon trees from our data supports previous work [24,25] as we would expect these
trees to be shaped by a variety of gene duplication events
and show similar imbalance to larger gene families.
If many of our gene families do sample duplications from
the 2R event, our results are even more striking, as gene
family trees are highly imbalanced despite this large event,
but there are further caveats. The simulations of figure 2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/66

are probably an inadequate model of how the 2R event
occurred: Furlong and Holland [36] have suggested that
the two genome duplications of the 2R-event may have
been closely spaced in time, leading to a period of autooctoploidy. This octoploid genetic system would break
down through a gradual and random return to diploidy as
chromosomes pair increasingly preferentially with particular other homologues. In this case, the phylogeny of the
duplicated genes will reflect the process of diploidisation
rather than the pattern of polyploidisation that produced
the duplicate copies. For example, if diploidisation
occurred by pairs of homeologues diverging from the pool
of chromosomes sequentially, it could lead to imbalanced
gene family trees, while if it occurs through a pseudotetraploid intermediate stage, it would tend to produce
balanced topologies. If Furlong and Holland are right,
and the two '2R' events occurred almost consecutively,
then the balance of gene families will be a product of the
background duplication process superimposed over the
signal from the diploidisation process, which will be hard
to disentangle.
We have identified two processes – large-scale gene duplication and tandem duplication – that have shaped gene
family phylogenies and do not apply in the analogous
process of speciation. More sophisticated models of
regional gene duplication would show the different effects
that the size, number, and timing of such events could
have on the balance of phylogenetic trees, as we have
modelled only two very simple situations (figures 2 and
3). The balance of gene family trees may reflect the relative
rates of large-scale duplication and tandem duplication,
but other processes can also affect tree balance. While tree
balance provides a method to study these processes, further progress will also require a better understanding of
the background birth-death processes of speciation and
extinction and gene duplication and loss.

Conclusion
Gene family trees are significantly less balanced than
would be expected under the equal-rate Markov (ERM)
model and are even more unbalanced than published species trees. The different balance of gene family trees and
species phylogenies suggests some difference between the
processes of gene duplications and speciation. This difference is surprising, as regional duplication is known to
occur, leading to non-independent gene duplications,
which should produce more balanced trees. The imbalance of gene family trees suggests that relatively few gene
duplications have occurred as segmental duplications
affecting multiple loci. Some models of tandem duplication suggest that this process should produce unbalanced
gene family trees, so our results might indicate that tandem duplications are more common, or at least have had
a greater impact on the shape of gene trees. One important

complication is the uncertainty over the effect the 2R
event could have had on the evolution of vertebrate gene
families.

Methods
Additional material is available from [37]. Available from
this site is a text file listing the number of taxa and Colless's index of imbalance for each family, a Mathematica
notebook for calculating expected values of this index
under the ERM and PDA models and tables of expected
values for Colless's Index under these models for trees of
between 3 and 500 leaves. C++ code for generating the
distribution of Colless's Index under ERM and PDA models and for the simulations shown in the paper is also
available, as are full results for the statistical tests
described.

simultaneously as the final cladogenesis event (Figure 2a,
b). A separate simulation simulated two consecutive
genome duplications as the first cladogenesis events in a
gene family, followed by subsequent evolution under the
ERM model (Figure 2d).
c) Colless's index
The most widely used index of tree imbalance is Colless's
[42] coefficient of imbalance (Im) and it has proved to be

mathematically tractable [43].This index takes the sum,
over every node in the tree, of the absolute difference in
the number of leaves descended from its two descendant
nodes. Im is usually normalised to range from 0 (for a
completely balanced topology) to 1 (for a completely

(n − 1)(n − 2)
, where
2
n is the number of leaves on the tree. Recursion equations
for the probability distribution of this measure under
both the ERM and PDA models are available [43][44]. Im
is a powerful statistic for trees from a variety of models but
different measures have different properties [6][45][46],
and may be more useful in different situations. Despite
this, to allow easy comparison with previous data sets we
only employ the normalised form of Colless's Im in this
paper.
unbalanced topology) by dividing by

a) Building gene family trees
The blastclust program [38] was used to form single-linkage clusters for all human genome genes using amino-acid
sequences from the NCBI reference sequence of 15/05/
2006, with sequences linked if they have a mean bit score
of 0.75 over at least 50% of each sequence (-S 0.75 -L 0.5
-b T options of blastclust). These sequences were then
matched with invertebrate outgroups by blast searches
against the entire invertebrate section of Genbank. A database of all the sequences was compared with the outgroup
database using the blastp option of the blastall program,
taking the two best hits per sequence with expectation (Evalue) less than 0.1. Alignments were generated for all
families with more than 3 and less than 500 member
sequences using ClustalW [39] with default parameters.
Short sequences (less than 30% the mean length for a
family, and families with aligned length less than 50 residues) were removed, and phylogenetic trees constructed
using the neighbour-joining algorithm [40] on maximum-likelihood distances inferred using Tree-Puzzle v5.0
[41] under the model selected by the program. Gene families were taken as subtrees containing only human
sequences, and so contain paralogs generated since the
last common ancestor of the vertebrates. Midpoint rooting of our trees produced phylogenies more balanced
than outgroup rooting, suggesting that the outgroups are
not too distant from the ingroup taxa for accurate rooting.
Some families were discarded due to difficulties in alignment or tree reconstruction. Trees were rooted using the
outgroups and Colless's Im was calculated using a C++
program.
b) Simulating genome duplications
To establish the effect that non-independent gene duplication has on tree balance, the effect of the most extreme
non-independent event, a whole-genome duplication,
was simulated. A C++ program was used to evolve trees
under the ERM model but with every lineage duplicating

d) Statistical tests of imbalance
In common with previous workers, statistical tests were
based on pIm scores [15,32]. To calculate these scores, each
tree's Im was compared with that of 10,000 trees of the
same size simulated under the ERM model, and the pIm
score was taken as the fraction of these with the same or
more extreme Im scores: i.e. the p-value of observing this
unbalance under the ERM model. To ensure greater
homogeneity of variance within tree sizes, pIm scores used
in statistical tests were transformed using the arcsine
transformation [[27] p.421]. Statistical tests used here
include the number of leaves in the model as pIm scores
are not independent of tree size [29]. As the relationship
between pIm and number of leaves is non-linear we adopt
a conservative method, treating number of leaves as categorical so that pIm values are only compared for trees of the
same size. An alternative approach, treating number of
leaves as continuous, and using a suitable polynomial to
fit the non-linear relationship between pIm and number of
leaves was also used to ensure that statistical significance
was not an artefact of the statistical model. An equivalent
and more elegant approach would be use the Im statistic
re-normalised to be independent of tree size for data from
the Yule distribution [47].
