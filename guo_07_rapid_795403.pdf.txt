Abstract
Background: Fabaceae (legumes) is one of the largest families of flowering plants, and some
members are important crops. In contrast to what we know about their great diversity or
economic importance, our knowledge at the genomic level of chloroplast genomes (cpDNAs or
plastomes) for these crops is limited.
Results: We sequenced the complete genome of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Negro
Jamapa) chloroplast. The plastome of P. vulgaris is a 150,285 bp circular molecule. It has gene
content similar to that of other legume plastomes, but contains two pseudogenes, rpl33 and rps16.
A distinct inversion occurred at the junction points of trnH-GUG/rpl14 and rps19/rps8, as in adzuki
bean [1]. These two pseudogenes and the inversion were confirmed in 10 varieties representing
the two domestication centers of the bean. Genomic comparative analysis indicated that inversions
generally occur in legume plastomes and the magnitude and localization of insertions/deletions
(indels) also vary. The analysis of repeat sequences demonstrated that patterns and sequences of
tandem repeats had an important impact on sequence diversification between legume plastomes
and tandem repeats did not belong to dispersed repeats. Interestingly, P. vulgaris plastome had
higher evolutionary rates of change on both genomic and gene levels than G. max, which could be
the consequence of pressure from both mutation and natural selection.
Conclusion: Legume chloroplast genomes are widely diversified in gene content, gene order, indel
structure, abundance and localization of repetitive sequences, intracellular sequence exchange and
evolutionary rates. The P. vulgaris plastome is a rapidly evolving genome.

Background
Chloroplasts are derived from an endosymbiotic cyanobacterium that invaded the eukaryotic cell a billion years
ago. During the evolutionary process from endosymbiont
to contemporary organelles, the cyanobacterium lost the
bulk of its genome and retained the genes encoding the
photosynthesis machinery and the components of several
chemical pathways. During this process, it also acquired
many host-derived properties and was thus transformed
into a distinct organelle: the chloroplast.
Angiosperm chloroplast genomes present a similar gene
content and gene order. They are circular molecules that
can also be present in linear forms with multiple copies,
ranging in size from 120 kb to 160 kb, but usually around
150 kb with about 90–110 unique genes [2]. A pair of
large inverted repeats (IR) about 21–28 kb in length
divides the genome into one large single-copy region
(LSC) and one small single-copy region (SSC). rRNA
genes are always located in IR regions.
Despite the overall conservation of plastomes, genomic
diversification was also experienced in many respects.
Many genes were lost phylogenetically, independently in
parallel or uniquely lost in a particular species [3]. An
extreme example is the cpDNA of the parasite plant Epifagus virginiana, which lost 13 tRNA genes and retained only
60 genes so that the genome was reduced to 70 kb [4]. It
was found that several kinds of inversions interrupted the
gene order of the plastome [5-11]. They are generally associated with specific lineages and thus could be a sign of
important events in evolutionary diversification [12,13].
Sequence duplication is another feature of some land
plant chloroplast genomes. For example, Pelargonium ×
hortorum contains some large duplicated fragments,
including several genes, and numerous simple repeats as
well as a tremendous extension of IR (75 kb) [14]. Definite evidence supporting transposition within plastid
genomes is lacking, but intramolecular recombination
mediated by short direct repeats has been reported [15].
The chloroplast genes have been extensively used to study
the phylogenetic relationships at several taxonomic levels,
especially in the analysis of basal clades, mainly because
they have slower mutation rate in comparison with the
nuclear genes [16]. The Fabaceae (legume) family is one
of the largest and more diverse angiosperm families. It
comprises about 20,000 species, which are distributed
essentially in tropical regions. Chloroplast-derived markers have been used to study the evolutionary relationship
between some legume plants (Fabaceae) [17-21]. However, to date, only the sequences of three legume chloroplast genomes have been reported: Lotus japonicus, Glycine
max, [22,23] and Medicago truncatula (AC093544, unpub-

lished). The common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, is a major
food crop, domesticated independently in two sites: Mesoamerica and South America[24]. The physical map of its
chloroplast genome was published in 1983 [25] and some
small pieces of the chloroplast genome were sequenced to
study domestication [26] and phylogeny issues. Here we
report the chloroplast sequence of P. vulgaris cv. Negro
Jamapa. A comparative analysis of this sequence with
other legume chloroplast genomes indicates that these
genomes are highly diversified in sequence and organization. Moreover, we provide evidence that one plastome
(P. vulgaris) evolved faster than another (G. max) at the
genomic and gene levels, which could be the consequence
of pressure coming from both mutation and natural selection.

Results
General features of the genome
The genome of P. vulgaris chloroplast is a circular molecule of 150,285 bp that contains an identical IR of 26,426
bp, separated by an LSC of 79,824 bp and an SSC of
17,610 bp (Fig. 1). The noncoding regions, including
both introns and intergenic regions, comprises 40.4% of
the genome. The overall A+T content for the genome is
64.6% in contrast to 68.7% for the noncoding regions.
rRNA genes and tRNA genes have the lowest A+T composition with 45.1% and 47.6%, respectively. A total of 127
genes were assigned to the genome, 108 of which were
unique and 19 were duplicated in IR regions. The unique
genes included 75 coding-protein genes, 30 tRNA genes,
and 4 rRNA genes. There were 17 genes containing one or
two introns, six of which were tRNA genes.
Gene content
The gene content of chloroplast genomes of P. vulgaris, G.
max, L. japonicus, and M. truncatula, the legume chloroplast genomes sequenced up to date, was similar. All
lacked the rpl22 genes and infA, which occurred in other
flowering plants. A distinctive characteristic of the P. vulgaris chloroplast genome was the presence of two pseudogenes: rps16 and rpl33. rps16 is an intron-containing gene
present as a functional gene in both L. japonicus and G.
max but absent in M. truncatula. In P. vulgaris, rps16 has
several features that define it as a pseudogene: firstly, it
contains four stop-codons within the second exon; secondly, the gene lacks a functional motif located from the
positions 16 to 47 of the amino acid sequence (comparing
with the soybean sequence); finally, its initial amino acid
is not ATG but ATA. The second pseudogene, rpl33, has
three stop-codons within its CDS and possesses a GTC as
the initial codon. To determine if the stop-codons in these
pseudogenes were "corrected" during the RNA-editing
process, we compared their sequence against an EST
library of P. vulgaris cv Negro Jamapa [27]. A cDNA with a
perfect match to rpl33 sequence was found, indicating that

this pseudogene was transcribed and that the stop codons
were not edited in its mRNA. In contrast, the rps16
sequence was not represented in this library. To demonstrate that the presence of these pseudogenes is not a peculiarity of the bean cultivars that we used in this work, the
regions containing rps16 or rpl33 from 10 other varieties
of P. vulgaris, belonging to two different domestication
centers, were amplified by PCR and the products were
sequenced. They gave the same sequence, except for 1–3
SNPs (not shown), indicating that their presence is a common characteristic of the species. P. vulgaris, G. max, and
L. japonicus chloroplast genomes contained 21 unique
introns. However, M. truncatula lacked intron 1 of clpP
and the intron present in the 3'-end of rps12.
Gene order
Each one of four-sequenced legume cpDNAs possessed its
own genome structure (Fig. 2). In comparison with the
Arabidopsis chloroplast genome (outgroup), L. japonicus
chloroplast genome has almost the same gene order,
except for a 51-kb inversion extending from rbcL to rps16
in the LSC region, which is present in most taxa of the
Papilionoideae subfamily of Leguminosae [8,12,22]. In
contrast to the plastome of L. japonicus, G. max cpDNA
seems to have a second inversion embracing the region
located between LSC and IRs, but is another isomer product of the flip-flop intramolecular recombination present
in platomes [28]. G. max and M. truncatula shared the
same gene order but the conspicuous difference between
them was the absence of the IRb region in the latter. The
P. vulgaris cpDNAcontained an inversion at the junction
between trnH-GUG/rpl14 and rps19/rps8 which was
absent in the three other legume chloroplast genomes. We
confirmed the presence of this peculiar structure in 10
other P. vulgaris varieties originating from Mesoamerican
and South American domestication centers, using a concatenated long PCR analysis. This genome inversion has
also been reported in the adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) [1]
and mung bean (Vigna radiata) [8]. These results indicate
that the structure found in L. japonicus cpDNA was closer
to the legume ancestral gene order.
IR region
The IR in P. vulgaris contained 19 complete genes and
spanned 26,426 bp, longer than G. max (25,574 bp) and
L. japonicus (25,156 bp). The P. vulgaris duplicated region
included the whole rps19 gene and 572 bp of its downstream sequence, whereas in both G. max and L. japonicus,
the IRs included only a partial fragment of the rps19 gene.
Thus, the length increase of IR was principally attributed
to the expansion of the IR region at the junction between
IR/LSC.

The junction points of IR/LSC were located in 24 bp from
the start base of rps3 CDS at one end and 53 bp from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/228

start base of rps8 CDS at the other. This was exactly like the
adzuki bean[1], indicating that this IR predated the speciation of these two bean species, but after the separation
from soybean. The boundaries between SSC/IR are
located within the ycf1 gene and for this reason, 505 bp of
this gene's 5'-end is repeated. A similar repetition was
found in G. max (478 bp) and L. japonicus (514 bp), which
are shorter than the repeat in Arabidopsis (1027 bp).
Indel structure
A number of insertions/deletions (indels) present on
cpDNA homologous regions shared by M. truncatula, G.
max, L. japonicus, and P. vulgaris were detected by DNA
alignments. In Figure 3, indels greater than 20 bp are
shown. Indels in P. vulgaris were principally concentrated
at the LSC region, only one was in IRs (24 bp); but deletion was more common than insertion in its cpDNA,
which resulted in the reduction of the genome size. In
contrast, M. truncatula had more and larger indels than
other legume plants, and even lost one copy of IR. A large
part of the indels was located at the intergenic regions or
introns but some of them lay within genes, common in
ycf1, ycf2, psaA, rps16, rps18, and accD.
DNA repeat analysis
All repeated sequences of 20 bp or larger with 100% identity were examined in each of the four legume chloroplast
genomes. M. truncatula had the largest number of repeats,
as described by Saski [23], whereas P. vulgaris had the
least. Repeats were generally located within the intergenic
regions or within introns; however, some of them were
present in genes, usually ycf1, ycf2, psaA, and accD.

The biggest direct repeat found in P. vulgaris cpDNA was a
287-bp duplication of an internal fragment of ycf2 (ψycf2,
Fig. 1). In P. vulgaris and G. max, this repeat had the same
size, while in L. japonicus this segment was a little smaller,
265 bp. These two copies in P. vulgaris were identical, as
well as in G. max and in L. japonicus, but in M. truncatula,
it already diverged, sharing 56% of identity. Palindromic
repeats were normally situated within intergenic regions
and in proximity to the gene end. In P. vulgaris, an identical 20-bp-sized palindromic sequence was found within
70 bp from the ends of genes trnH-GUG, ycf3, and ycf1,
indicating that they could have the same function.
Tandem-repeat analysis
The distribution of tandem repeats in the legumes cpDNAs is shown in Table 1. Phaseolus has five groups of tandem repeats, the smallest number of the sequenced
legume cpDNAs. One repetitive unit of 16 bp was duplicated four times within the IR region and was located
close to the boundaries of IR/LSC (coordinate positions:
80116–80179 and 149929 – 149992). The alignment of
this region with the corresponding sequences of other leg-

ume cpDNAs available from Genbank showed that adzuki
bean possessed this duplicated tandem repeat, but with
three repeated units each. G. max and L. japonicus lost this
sequence. However, M. truncatula had only one 16-bp
unit with 75% identity at this position.
M. truncatula had a similar number of reverse and palindrome repeats to other legume plastomes but had a higher
proportion of tandem repeats (2% of its genome), compared to other legume cpDNAs. The majority of tandem
repeats were located within coding regions of accD, ycf1,
and ycf2 genes and into intergenic regions between clpP/
rps12-5'end and ycf1/trnN. For example, the accD gene
contained seven kinds of repeats in tandem from two to

five copies. Of all tandem repeats found in M. truncatula,
only one (coordinate number: 37267–37401) in ycf2 was,
to a different extent, shared by all the legume plastomes.
Consensus sequences of repetitive units of each tandem
repeat present in M. truncatula cpDNA were obtained and
searched in the other legume cpDNAs. The consensus
sequences of repeats within ycf1, ycf2, rps18, and psaA were
found in the other genomes but as single sequences (not
repeated).
The largest tandem repeat in M. truncatula, spanning 286
bp, was situated at the end of clpP (coordinates 55590 and
55875), and it was exclusively found in cpDNA of this
plant. It consisted of two identical tandem copies of 143

bp, repeats A and B (Fig. 4). In fact, this segment was also
composed of six copies of a smaller repeated unit of
approximate 48 bp, of which some copies were altered by
a few bases (a1, b1) or had some base insertions (a2, a3,
b2, b3), but the backbone was conserved. This structure
suggests that the 48 bp was first duplicated two consecutive times, and then each of these units underwent some
degree of diversification to form the 143 bp. More
recently, this last element was duplicated. Similar situations were found in the accD gene and the intergenic
region ycf1/trnN.
Phylogenetic analysis
Legume chloroplast phylogenies were established using a
phylogenomic approach and the phylogenetic information of individual genes. In our analyses, we always used
the A. thaliana chloroplast genome as the outgroup. From
the phylogenomic perspective, we made two large alignments: one with all homologous regions of the five cpD-

NAs but excluding the paralogous regions, and the other,
by pasting together the individual alignments of 102 individual genes. Both gave similar tree topologies, forming
two subgroups with a bootstrap value of 100: Phaseolus
with Glycine and Medicago with Lotus (Fig. 5a, b), which
correspond to the previously well-established phylogeny
[21]. It was apparent that, in the group of Phaseolus with
Glycine, Phaseolus has accumulated more substitutions
than Glycine, thus Phaseolus diversified much faster (2.3
times), while M. truncatula and L. japonicus has a similar
substitution rate (Fig. 5a, b). To support the phylogeny
obtained with genomes, we also did phylogenies with
each of the 75 protein-encoding genes (rps12 is a divided
gene: its -5' and 3'ends were considered here as two genes
because they are encoded at different loci; ycf4 was not
used due to the absence in M. truncatula and L. japonicus
plastomes). Ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA genes were
not included because of fewer base substitutions. 60 protein-coding genes produced phylogenies with bootstrap

values higher than 50. These 60 phylogenies were classified into five topologies: three of them were obtained
more frequently (Fig. 5c–e) and the other two topologies
were only supported by single genes (not shown). The
most frequent topology, representing 28 genes (47%),
matched the topology obtained with phylogenomic analysis. Topologies D and E represent phylogenies of 18
(30%) and 12 (20%) genes, respectively. In all of these
topologies G. max and P. vulgaris made a cluster, but M.
truncatula or L. japonicus differed in the relation to A. thaliana, the outgroup. It is important to point out that phylogenies obtained with matK and rbcL (topology D), two
genes commonly used in plant phylogenic analysis, do
not fit the genome-based topology, suggesting that care
must be taken in interpreting data obtained with these
gene-markers.
Relative evolutionary rate
The genome-based phylogenies indicate that legume chloroplast genomes change at different rates. To identify
which genes and to what extent these genes contribute to
the overall evolutionary rate, a relative rate test was performed. The relative rates between Phaseolus and Glycine
and those between Medicago and Lotus in K, Ks, and Ka of
all protein-coding genes were determined. Considering
that the outgroup plastome could affect, to some extent,
the analysis, each relative test employed one of three different genomes alternatively as an outgroup. The relative
rate tests between P. vulgaris and G. max were evaluated
using as a reference species, A. thaliana, M. truncatula, or L.
japonicus. Similarly, the relative rate tests between M. truncatula and L. japonicus were calculated using A. thaliana, P.
vulgaris, or G. max as reference group.

In the comparing P. vulgaris and G. max, we found a
number of P. vulgaris genes with a strong tendency to
evolve faster, despite the different reference species used
(Fig. 6). All the genes with statistical significance (p <
0.05) K, Ka, and Ks values also produced the same results

(Fig. 6, Tables 2 and 3). We therefore concluded that there
was faster diversification of the P. vulgaris plastome than
G. max at the genomic level. Comparing M. truncatula-L.
japonicus,12 genes evolved at a significantly different rate
(K), 10 of which accumulated more substitutions in M.
truncatula (Fig. 6A, B, and 6C), and two of which had
more substitutions in L. japonicus.
In both groups, P. vulgaris-G. max and M. truncatula-L.
japonicus, all the pet, psa, psb, and atp genes showed no
significant difference in substitution rates, and six genes
(accD, ycf1, ycf2, clpP, ndhF, and rpoC2) evolved at different rates (Tables 2 and 3, Fig. 6). Some genes containing significant differences in the group P. vulgaris-G. max
did not demonstrate significant differences in M. truncatula-L. japonicus. This result suggests that, in legume plastomes, some genes showed similar evolutionary tendency
and others diversified faster in a particular plastome. accD
and ycf2 presented different rates of both synonymous
and nonsynonymous changes, implying that these genes
have low functional compromise. Moreover, accD and
ycf2 had a ω index (Ka/Ks) higher than 1, indicating that
they are subjected to a strong diversifying process. The rest
of the genes with significant change rates had a ω index
lower than 1, showing that these genes are under purifying selection.

Discussion
Gene order and gene content of legume plastomes
In contrast to the genome organization in A. thaliana,
most taxa of the subfamily Papilionoideae, including the
four species of which plastomes are sequenced, present a
51-kb inversion within the LSC region [12]. Another
inversion at the junction points of trnH-GUG/rpl14 and
rps19/rps8 was only reported to occur in two genera, Phaseolus and Vigna[1,19,29], indicating that this chloroplast
genome arrangement is characteristic of the PhaseolusVigna species complex. The chloroplast genome of M.
truncatula lacks one IR, a feature shared with other legume

Hedysareae, Trifolieae, and Vicieae and some genera of
other groups [13]. Now, all these tribes form a new clade,
IRLC (inverted-repeat-loss clade) [30]. Thus, the foursequenced plastomes represent three types of plastome
structure, suggesting that the cpDNA organization is very
diverse in legume plants.

Legume cpDNAs do not contain rpl22 [31,32] and infA
[33] genes, indicating that they were phylogenetically lost
from this lineage. A specific character of P. vulgaris cpDNA
is the presence of the two pseudogenes rps16 and rpl33.
The first is functional in L. japonicus and G. max but is lost
in M. truncatula [23,32]. The cpDNAs of other land plants,
Selaginella uncinata, Psilotum nudum, Physcomitrella patens,

pendently [4,34,35]. rpl33 is a functional gene basically
present in all land plant chloroplasts, except in S. uncinata. These data suggested that P. vulgaris cpDNA is still
undergoing genome reduction.
The accD gene encodes an acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase
subunit similar to prokaryotic accD in structure[36], and
is the most variable gene present in legume chloroplasts.
Its size is widely different: 1299 bp in G. max; 1422 bp in
P. vulgaris; 1506 bp in L. japonicus, and 2142 bp in M. truncatula. Medicago has the largest accD of prokaryotic form,
containing seven kinds of tandem repeats and one 43-bpsized separate direct repeat situated between two conserved regions. We did a BLAST-search with the accD gene
against the EST bank of M. truncatula. One tentative consensus segment of 9334 bp (TC106672) was found to

contain the identical sequences of chloroplast genes trnSGCU, trnQ-UUG, psbI, psbK, accD, psaI, cemA, and petA,
indicating that these genes are transcribed. Nevertheless,
the large amount of tandem repeats present in the M. truncatula accD gene calls into question its functionality.
Another landmark of the legume plastomes is the duplication of a portion of ycf2. The duplicated segment, named
ψycf2, was first identified as a pseudogene in Vigna angularis [1]. It is present in the same relative position in the
legume plastomes analyzed here. In G. max, P. vulgaris and
L. japonicus, ψycf2 is identical to its copy within ycf2, but
in M. truncatula they are very divergent (60 % of identity).
This result indicates that the last common ancestor of
these plants already had this duplication and gene conversion occurred in the plastomes containing IR.

Nature of tandem repeats
The sequence and distribution of repetitive elements are
characteristic of each chloroplast genome, and they can be
classified in two broad categories: large repeats and short
dispersed repeats (SDRs). Both categories can be found in
different proportions in chloroplast genomes. Oenothera
and Triticum chloroplasts contain some dispersed repeats,
but 20% of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii plastome con-

sists of repeated sequences, many of them are tandem
repeats (TR) [37-39]. In legume plastomes, clear differences reside in the number, location, and sequence of TR.
M. truncatula possess a plastome with greater number and
larger TRs, and P. vulgaris has a plastome with fewer TRs.
Usually, TRs are classified as a subcategory of SDRs, but
our analysis of the legume chloroplast genomes shows

that TRs have a different origin from the rest of the SDRs.
The repetitive unit of an SDR family is dispersed throughout the genome and different members of an SDR family
share high identity. In contrast, the repetitive unit of a TR
is not dispersed, and the consensus sequence of each TR
has low identity with the consensus sequences of other
TRs, with the exception of some repeats with low complexity (i. e. ATATAT). In other words, each TR is specific
to a site.
Multi-alignments among plastomes frequently show that
a repetitive consensus unit of a TR can be found in other
chloroplast genomes at similar positions without duplication, or the region containing corresponding sequences
are completely deleted from a specific plastome. Moreover, some small insertions from 7 bp to 21 bp are the
duplication events of one of the flanking sequences in a
specific plastome to form a small TR (only two tandem
units). On the other hand, more complicated TRs by consecutive duplication, as shown in Figure 4, also exist in
other sites of the plastome. Taking together our observations, we conclude that TRs came from in situ sequences
and do not share the same origin of dispersed repeats.
We propose that homology-facilitated illegitimate recombination is the mechanism that creates TRs. The reasons
are: 1). TRs arise from in situ sequences, actually from 7 bp
to 143 bp long in the present study; 2) About 4–17 bp initial bases of some larger insertions are the iteration of
their flanking sequence; 3) There are many copies of the
plastome in a cell, both in circle and in linear forms,
which provide the opportunity of such recombination; 4)
Homology-facilitated illegitimate recombination is corroborated by the gene transformation in the chloroplast
of Acinetobacter sp. [40]. Recombination mediated by
short direct repeats was reported in wheat chloroplast
[15].
Intracellular sequence exchange
Recently, Kami reported the sequence from a nuclear BAC
clone, 71F18, containing a chloroplast-derived DNA of P.
vulgaris [41]. The sequence comparison between the P.
vulgaris plastome and the BAC clone showed that two separate regions (trnG-rps14 in 914 bp, trnI-ndhB in 7901 bp)
in the plastome were linked together in the nuclear
genome, with the same similarity (99.01%) to their
nuclear homologues. We noted that the nuclear homologues did not contain the insertion in comparison with
its plastome sequence, but had 8 deletion segments ranging in size from 8 bp to 583 bp. We therefore postulate
that the original fragment transferred from the plastome,
likely spanned the whole fragment from trnI-GAU to rps14
(73 kb), and then some deletions occurred, including the
deletion of 64 kb fragment from trnL to psbZ.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/228

A BLAST-search of the M. truncatula plastome sequences
with available nuclear genome sequences of this species
found that 51% of the plastome is present in the nuclear
genome with more than 99% identity. These identified
chloroplast-derived segments of the M. truncatula nuclear
genome can be as large as 25 Kb. One must take into
account that we only had the opportunity to explore a partial nuclear genome that is available up to date in Genbank, suggesting that the whole plastome could be found
in the nuclear genome if the complete nuclear genome
becomes available. If so, it is similar to the case of the rice
genome [42], but different from A. thaliana, in which the
chloroplast-derived fragments found in the nuclear
genome have a lesser degree of identity (commonly 92–
98%) and the transferred fragments are smaller in size,
generally less than 4 kb, indicating that cpDNA transfer
occurs earlier in the A. thaliana genome. In the rice
genome, cpDNAs are continuously transferred to the
nuclear genome, which incessantly eliminates them, until
an equilibrium is reached [42]. On the other hand, we did
not find significant similarity between the plastome of L.
japonicus and its nuclear genome. There are several
hypotheses to explain the gene transfer from chloroplast
to nuclear genomes [43]. The most common mechanism
of transfer depends on chloroplast lysis, but it is still difficult to elucidate why the nuclear genome of A. thaliana
did not integrate cpDNA with the same patterns as M.
truncatula or O. sativa.
Rate of evolutionary change in legume plastomes
There are only a few reports that describe the evolutionary
rate of the chloroplast genome [44-46]. In the present
study, we demonstrate that one plastome (P. vulgaris) globally evolved faster than another plastome (G. max),
which has not been observed before.

In regard to the evolutionary rate of legume plants, Lavin
reported that Phaseolus and closely related genera have the
fastest substitution rates at the matK locus, within Leguminosae [21]. Delgado-Salinas recently suggested this accelerated substitution rate in matK (within the intron of trnK)
is related to the formation of the modern Trans-Mexico
volcanic belt [47]. We present further evidence here that
the Phaseolus plastome genomically diversified rapidly.
Considering that all the genes in this genome were
affected, we deduced that some factor likely impacted this
plastome globally, leading to a higher rate of evolutionary
change.
Evolutionary rate can be mainly affected by the following
factors: generation time, population size, specific mutation rate, and natural selection [48]. The first three factors
should influence all the genes of a genome as a whole,
whereas the third is able to impinge on specific genes.
Generation time is usually considered as an important

cause for acting on the evolutionary rate, and has been
applied in the elucidation of the discrepancy of evolutionary rates between rodents and other mammals [49],
between the plastomes of Phalaenopsis aphrodite and grass
crops [50], and between rice and maize [46]. However, it
cannot be applied to explain the phenomenon in the
present study because both G. max and P. vulgaris are
annual crop plants, sharing the same generation time.
Population sizes of G. max and P. vulgaris cultivars seem
to be similar because they are important domesticated
plants with a highly limited genetic diversity [51]. The
divergent mutation rate could be one of the causes of the
variance in the substitution rate between Phaseolus and
Glycine. The reasons are: 1) overall Ks in Phaseolus is much
higher than Glycine (see Additional File 1); 2) the sites of
synonymous substitution are far from saturation in this
plastome (< < 1); 3) and these two crop plants have the
same generation time and similar reproductive mode
(self-fertilization), which prevents genetic recombination
from other plants; and 4) the chloroplast is rarely
imported from other compartments of a cell as genetic
elements. On the other hand, natural selection should be
a factor for the relative rate of specific genes. The present
research shows that almost all genes are under a purifying
selection (ω < 1). Therefore, we conclude that the different
evolutionary rate between Phaseolus and Glycine is a consequence of the pressures of both mutation and natural
selection.
The M. truncatula and L. japonicus plastomes evolved at a
similar rate (K). However, the genes with significant differences showed a remarkably distinct rate: 10 M. truncatula genes evolved significantly faster than did their L.
japonicus counterparts, but two genes, rpoC2 and ndhF,
changed faster in L. japonicus. In this case, it seems that the
particular reason that leads to faster evolution of some
genes in one plastome must be natural selection.

Conclusion
Plastomes of leguminous plants have evolved specific
genomic structures. They have undergone diversification
in gene content, gene order, indel structure, abundance
and localization of repetitive sequences, intracellular
sequence exchange and evolutionary rates. In particular,
the P. vulgaris plastome globally has evolved faster than
that of Glycine.

Methods
Biological materials
The P. vulgaris cultivars used in this work were Negro
Jamapa, Pinto V1-114, Kentucky wonder, Carioca, Olathe,
Othello, MSU Fleet Wood, Jalo EEP558, and BAT93,
derived from the mesoamerican domestication center and
Cardinal and Red Kloud, derived from the Andean
domestication center.

Chloroplast DNA extraction, DNA sequencing, and
genome annotation
P. vulgaris cv. Negro Jamapa cpDNA was isolated from
intact chloroplasts using the method reported by Jansen
[52]. To construct the shotgun library, DNA was fragmented by nebulization. Fragments between 2 and 5 kb
were recovered from 1% agarose gel, blunt-ended, and
cloned in pZERO™-2 in its EcoRV site (Invitrogen).
Recombinant clones were sequenced using the Dye-terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, USA). Sequencing reactions were run in an ABI
3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). To seal small gaps,
specific regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the obtained products were sequenced.
Assemblages were obtained using the PHRED-PHRAPCONSED software [53,54] with a final quality of < 1 error
per 100,000 bases. Genome annotation was performed
with the aid of the DOGMA program [55]. The start and
stop codons and the boundaries between introns and
exons for each protein-coding gene were determined by
comparison with other published chloroplast genomes
using BLASTX [56]. We also annotated the M. truncatula
plastome because its annotation is not available from
Genbank.
PCR amplification
Concatenated long PCR was adopted to confirm the gene
order of the P. vulgaris chloroplast genome and to analyze
the gene order of closely related bean varieties. Primers for
amplifying the whole genome as overlapping segments
are shown in Additional File 2. The pairs of primers for the
amplification of pseudogenes, rps16 and rpl33, were:
rps16F (5'-tgtagcgaatgaatcaatgc-3'), rps16R (5'-tgccttactcaatgtttgttc-3'); rpl33F (5'-aaattcggagtgaaactcg-3'), rpl33R
(5'-tctcagtcgactcgctttt-3'). PCR assays were performed in a
25 µl reaction volume containing 250 ng template DNA,
1× reaction XL buffer II, 1.1 mM Mg(OAc)2, 200 µM
dNTPs, 5 pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of rTth DNA
polymerase XL (Perkin Elmer). PCR amplifications were
carried out in a 9700 thermocycler (Perkin Elmer) with
the following conditions: an initial denaturation at 94°C
for 1 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for15 s,
annealing and extension at 62°C for 3–15 min (depending on the fragment size needed to amplify); and a final
extension at 72°C for 7 min.
Genome analysis
Gene order comparison between the chloroplast genomes
of P. vulgaris (DQ886273), A. thaliana (AP000423),G.
max (DQ317523),L. japonicus (AP002983), and M. truncatula (AC093544) was performed with MAUVE [57].
REPuter [58] was used to identify the number and location of direct, reverse, and palindromic repeats of
genomes with minimum identical repeat size of 20 bp.

Evolutionary analysis
Genes were defined as homologs with the criterion of E
value, 1×10-12, in a BLAST search, using as queries the P.
vulgaris genes against other chloroplast genomes mentioned above [56]. Two big alignments were made. The
first one was a multigenome alignment produced by
MAUVE [57]. The second one was constructed by two
steps: creating the homologous alignments of each of 74
individual protein-encoding genes that had at least one
copy in each genome by MUSCLE [60] and then pasting
all the individual gene alignments together to form a big
one (concatenated alignment). Alignments were edited to
exclude gap-containing columns.

A DNA substitution model was selected using Akaike
information criterion with Modeltest, version 3.7 [61].
For the alignments described earlier, the General Time
Reversible (GTR) model, including rate variation among
sites (+G) and invariable sites (+I), was chosen as the best
fit. One thousand replicates were generated with SEQBOOT. Phylogenies were constructed using PHYML [62]
and DNAPARS and the consensus phylogenetic tree was
obtained with CONSENSE. For each of the 74 individual
gene alignments, a phylogeny was produced with PHYML,
using a nonparametric bootstrap analysis of 100 replicates. TREEDIST was used to estimate how many different
topologies there are, but only the topologies with nonparametric bootstrap values higher than 50 were considered.
SEQBOOT, DNAPARS, CONSENSE, and TREEDIST were
downloaded from the PHYLIP package version 3.61 [63].
The number of nucleotide substitutions per site "K" was
calculated with MEGA3 [64]. The number of nucleotide
substitutions per synonymous site "Ks" and the number
of nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous site "Ka"
were deduced with yn00 from PAML13.14 [65]. Based on
these data, K, Ks, and Ka, a triplet relative rate test was
employed to evaluate the evolutionary rate difference
between P. vulgaris and G. max or that between L. japonicus
and M. truncatula.
