Gene expression throughout a vertebrate’s
embryogenesis
Goran Bozinovic1,5, Tim L Sit2, David E Hinton3, Marjorie F Oleksiak4*

Abstract
Background: Describing the patterns of gene expression during embryonic development has broadened our
understanding of the processes and patterns that define morphogenesis. Yet gene expression patterns have not
been described throughout vertebrate embryogenesis. This study presents statistical analyses of gene expression
during all 40 developmental stages in the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus using four biological replicates per stage.
Results: Patterns of gene expression for 7,000 genes appear to be important as they recapitulate developmental
timing. Among the 45% of genes with significant expression differences between pairs of temporally adjacent
stages, significant differences in gene expression vary from as few as five to more than 660. Five adjacent stages
have disproportionately more significant changes in gene expression (> 200 genes) relative to other stages: four to
eight and eight to sixteen cell stages, onset of circulation, pre and post-hatch, and during complete yolk
absorption. The fewest differences among adjacent stages occur during gastrulation. Yet, at stage 16, (pre-midgastrulation) the largest number of genes has peak expression. This stage has an over representation of genes in
oxidative respiration and protein expression (ribosomes, translational genes and proteases). Unexpectedly, among
all ribosomal genes, both strong positive and negative correlations occur. Similar correlated patterns of expression
occur among all significant genes.
Conclusions: These data provide statistical support for the temporal dynamics of developmental gene expression
during all stages of vertebrate development.

Background
Much effort has been expended to define developmental
stages: cellular and morphological hallmarks of critical
points during embryogenesis. Stages, unlike developmental time alone, provide insights into cellular and
molecular processes as simple as the eight-cell stage or
as complex as the onset of circulation. Although numerous aspects of development have been discovered
through studies of diverse species [1-3], a comprehensive analysis of gene expression for each separate stage
of vertebrate development is lacking.
Among vertebrates, developmental processes are
shared [4,5]; thus insights from fish inform human studies [4,5]. Fundulus heteroclitus, similar to zebrafish and
medaka (rice fish), has external development and transparent eggs, which facilitate associations between

morphological developmental changes and patterns of
gene expression. Unlike many other developmental
models, F. heteroclitus has a ~14 day development that
allows greater precision in defining specific stages than
is possible in vertebrate species with short developmental times. Finally, this species has large population sizes,
a well-described phylogeny, and locally adapted populations making it an exceptional model for environmental
and evolutionary studies [6].
To provide quantitative and statistical analyses of
development, we used four biological replicates from all
40 developmental stages (from fertilization to free swimming larvae, Figure 1A; Additional File 1 shows the full
in vivo morphological atlas and Additional File 2 shows
late organodifferentiation histology) of F. heteroclitus.
These biological replicates provide the data for statistical
analyses of the expression of 6,857 genes throughout
embryogenesis and a better understanding of the differences among stages and developmental pathways.
Although 6,857 genes are not the full complement of

genes expressed in vertebrates, they provide a statistically robust measure of differences between stages,
which is important for experimental sciences that
explore embryo responses to altered environments, chemical exposures and physiological differences.

Results and Discussion
Expression of 1,607 genes (23% of 6,857) differs significantly (p < 0.01) among all stages. Our a priori query
addressed the number of significant differences between
adjacent stages: expression of 3,062 genes (45%) differs
significantly between stages. Hierarchical clustering of
these genes (Figure 1B and 1C) groups stages into three
main clusters: 1) stages 1-13: fertilization-early gastrula;
2) stages 14-25: blastoderm-heart formation; 3) stages
26-40: onset of circulation-late organogenesis and posthatch. These groups are in developmental order with a
few exceptions (Figure 1C). Thus, the patterns of gene
expression recapitulate the series of developmental
stages.
The number of genes that alter expression between
adjacent stages differs widely, from 5 to 665 (Figure 1D
Additional File 3). At a critical p-value of 0.01, one
expects approximately 70 differences due to type-1
errors. Fifteen pairs of adjacent stages have less than
this false expectation. Three of these pairs of adjacent
stages with few significant genes occur among gastrulation stages (12-13, 16-17, 17-18) and two are prior to
the 4-cell stage (1-2, 2-3). Not surprisingly, few differences in expression occur between fertilization and first
cell division. In contrast, the lack of changes in expression throughout formation of the germ layers during
gastrulation is unexpected.
Expression of 610 (8.9%) and 461 (6.7%) genes are significantly different between the 4-cell (stage 4) and 8cell (stage 5) stages and the 8-cell and 16-cell (stage 6)
stages, respectively. During zebrafish embryogenesis,
these stages correspond to the timing of maternal gene
degradation and onset of embryo gene activity [7]. The
large number of significantly differently expressed genes
suggests similar timing for F. heteroclitus. Notice, a large
number of genes show both significant increases and
decreases from stage 4 to 5 (Figure 1D). However,
between stages 5 and 6, most significant differences
(83%) are increases in expression (negative value for
log2 values of stage 5 - log2 values of stage 6) suggesting
that initiation of embryonic gene expression becomes
more dominant at stage 6.
The greatest number of differentially expressed genes
(665, 9.7%) occurs between pre-hatching (stage 35) and
hatching (stage 36), which validates our incentive to distinguish these two stages in contrast to previous work
[8]. Other notable differences occur between stages 38
and 39 (294, 4.3% of genes), when most of the yolk is

Page 3 of 10

consumed by the free-swimming Fundulus larvae
(eleutheroembyros [9]) and between stages 25 and 26
(223, 3.3% of genes), marked by the onset of circulation.
Times to stage have large variances (Table 1 Additional File 4 gives full stage descriptions). For example,
stages 5 and 6 are on average one hour apart yet have a
combined standard deviation greater than one hour.
Variability in times to stage becomes more pronounced
as later stages become longer (Table 1). For stages 35
and 36, with 665 differences in expression, the mean
times to stage differ by fourteen hours, which is nearly
equal to the standard deviation for each stage. Thus,
using time alone rather than developmental markers can
lead to misinterpretations of gene expression changes.
The wave of maximum gene expression throughout
development provides insight into how the magnitude
of expression relates to developmental processes (Figure
2AAdditional File 3). Four distinct quadrants, similar to
the hierarchical clustering results, are formed: stages 113 (unfertilized egg-early gastrula), stages 14-25 (blastoderm-onset of circulation), stages 26-35 (growth and
organodifferentiation-pre-hatching), and stages 36-40
(hatching and growth). Pre-mid gastrulation (stage 16)
has the most genes (738) with peak expression, followed
by pre-hatching (stage 35, 521 genes) and the 8-cell
stage (stage 5, 400 genes). Thus, although most genes
have a significant increase in expression between 8 and
16 cell stages, the greatest number of genes reaches
maximum expression during pre-mid gastrulation. Notably, the lack of many significant differences among gastrulation stages (15-18, Figure 1) corresponds to the
large block of maximum expression. These data suggest
that both qualitative differences in expression (initiation
of new gene expression) and quantitative differences (as
reflected in peak gene expression) are important for
defining developmental processes.
Genes with peak expression during stage 16 (pre-mid
gastrula) are significantly enriched for ribosomal genes
(p < 2.7 × 10-16, Fisher exact test, Table 1), which show
highly positively correlated expression patterns (Figure
2BAdditional File 5). Interestingly, these ribosomal
genes are significantly negatively correlated with many
of the other ribosomal genes expressed during development. Stage 16 also is significantly enriched for genes
involved in oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and translation as well as proteases (p < 0.0425,
0.0060, 0.0049, and 0.0067, respectively, Fisher exact
tests, Table 1). Taken together, these data suggest that
peak gene expression during gastrulation enhances highenergy demands during cellular proliferation and protein
synthesis and turnover.
Among the 1,607 genes significantly differently
expressed across all stages, almost half (49.2%) have
a significant correlation coefficient (> 0.4 or < -0.4,

p < 0.01): 27.5% are significantly positively correlated
and 21.8% are significantly negatively correlated (Figure
2CAdditional File 6). Among pairs of genes with larger
correlation coefficients, the ratio of significant positively
to negatively correlated genes increases. Thus, when the
absolute value of the correlation coefficients exceeds 0.5,
this ratio is 1.4 (20.4%/14.4%), and when these correlation coefficients exceed 0.8, it is 6.3 (2.5%/0.4%). The
numerous correlated genes suggest concerted changes in
gene expression throughout development. Moreover, the
increase in the relative amount of positive associations
with stronger correlations suggests common regulatory
factors while the less significant negative correlations
may reflect coordinate regulation, potentially using similar signalling pathways, but with a variety of different
regulatory factors.
The last five stages (post-hatch) compared to the 35
embryonic developmental stages give insight into preadult versus developmental gene expression. Eighthundred and eighty-nine genes (13.0%, p < 0.01) are significantly differently expressed during pre-hatching
(stages 1-35) versus post-hatching (stages 36-40)
(Figure 3); 417 genes (47%) have higher expression levels
before hatching, while 472 genes (53%) are up regulated

after hatching (Additional File 7). Several post-hatch up
regulated genes have important functions in muscle tissue development and movement including parvalbumins
alpha and beta (calcium-binding proteins involved in
muscle relaxation have 5-9-fold higher expression posthatch [10,11]), myosin regulatory light chain, skeletal
muscle isoform (6.1-fold increase [12]), myosin light
chain 3, skeletal muscle gene (5.2-fold increase [13]),
myosin binding protein C (3.4-fold increase [14,15]) and
troponins I, T and C (~3-fold increases [16]). Increased
transcript levels of these genes suggest increases in
movement and muscle activity of a free-swimming Fundulus compared to restricted movement within a chorion microenvironment before hatching. In addition, the
creatine-kinase system is important for energy delivery
in skeletal and cardiac muscle [17], and the 3-fold up
regulation of muscle type creatine-kinase post-hatch
indicates increases in metabolic activity and ATP consumption resulting from skeletal muscle activity caused
by swimming.
Low transcript levels pre-hatch, and higher levels posthatch of both retinal-cone rhodopsin-sensitve cGMP
(2.4-fold increase) and photosystem I reaction center
subunit II-like gene (3.6-fold increase) are associated

distinct peaks. 4-16 cells encompass stages 4-6. Gastrula

with vision [18,19]. Since both genes are induced by
light and Fundulus embryos are exposed to higher light
intensity after hatching than within the chorion [20], the
up regulation of these two genes suggest embryo photoreceptor system response to a brighter external
environment.
Finally, several up regulated genes post-hatch suggest
changes in metabolic activity of the free-swimming Fundulus. These include nucleoside diphosphate kinase
NBR-B (6-fold increase), required for nucleoside triphosphate synthesis (other than ATPs) and necessary for
lipid and polysaccharide synthesis, protein elongation,
signal transduction and microtubule polymerization
[21,22], trifunctional purine biosynthetic protein adenosine-3 (5.6-fold increase) which plays a major role in
purine biosynthesis [23,24] and fatty acid-binding protein required for lipid transport and metabolism. Both

liver and heart fatty acid binding protein genes are up
regulated in Fundulus post hatch (liver: 2.3-fold, heart:
2-fold), and the increased expression levels likely reflect
changes taking place within the last two stages of Fundulus development marked by the transition period
between complete yolk consumption and increasing
dependence on external food sources.

Conclusions
Statistical analyses of nearly 7,000 Fundulus genes during all 40 stages of vertebrate embryogenesis highlight
the temporal dynamics of developmental gene expression and stage clustering. Analyses of differences in
gene expression between adjacent stages and onset of
peak gene activity emphasize the importance of correctly
identifying stages during embryogenesis. These data
show clear differences between the transitions among
stages: 4-16 cell stages have many more significant
changes than similar stages (e.g., onset of early blastula
has 1/10 the number of significant genes); pre-post
hatching involves the largest number of significant temporal changes in gene expression associated with transition from egg enclosed embryos to free swimming

larvae. These statistical analyses are possible because
gene expression was quantified with biological replication among well-defined stages.

Methods
Fish field collection and maintenance

Adult Fundulus heteroclitus were captured from King’s
Creek, VA (37° 17’ 54.04"N; 76° 25’ 32.06"W) using minnow traps and transported under controlled temperature
and aeration conditions to NCSU Aquatic Laboratory.
Fish were maintained at 20°C and 15 ppt salinity in 40
gallon flow-though re-circulating tanks under a pseudosummer light cycle (16 h light/8 h dark) for 2 months
prior to embryo culturing. Effluent from the tanks was
passed through an activated charcoal filter system, and
20% of the water was changed weekly. Fish were fed (brine
shrimp flake, blood meal flake, and Spirulina flake - FOD,
Aquatic Biosystems), and checked for health status daily.
Fish spawning, fertilization, development, and egg
collection for atlas, histology and gene expression

To minimize variability, we used embryos from a single
Fundulus population, developing under controlled
laboratory conditions. Mature females were stripped of
their eggs and sperm from mature males were collected
in separate beakers. Eggs from multiple females were
fertilized by sperm from multiple males, and excess
sperm were removed. Fertilized embryos were maintained in Petri dishes half submerged in 15 ppt filtered
seawater in a 25°C environmental chamber under light
during the first two stages of development (2-cell stage).
Embryos that successfully reached the 2-cell stage within
3 hours were incubated under a 16 hour light/8 hour
dark photoperiod at 25°C in the environmental chamber
(818 Low Temperature Illuminated Incubator, Precision
Scientific, USA). Fertilization success and embryo progress was monitored daily by examining representative
stages during pre-determined time periods ([8]; internal
data) using a dissecting stereo microscope (Nikon
SME1500, Japan). Time to stage, normal versus abnormal development, and mortality also were recorded.
Unfertilized eggs, malformed and/or dead embryos were
removed from the population, and times and stages of
arrest and abnormal development were recorded accordingly. Once the normally developing embryos reached
pre-determined developmental stages, embryos were
photographed using a Micropublisher 5.0 RTV Camera
(QImaging) fitted on the stereo microscope, immediately
placed in pre-chilled 1.5 ml microfuge tubes and snapfrozen at -80°C for later RNA analyses.
Average time to stage and heart rate

To determine the average time to stage for all 40 stages,
three embryos from 10 different families (each family

Page 7 of 10

consisted of offspring from a single female and male
cross) were monitored in individual 20-ml scintillation
vials. Identification of each stage was determined using
a dissecting stereo microscope (Nikon SME1500, Japan)
at 70-80× magnification. Multiple images of developing
embryos were taken at different phases of each developmental stage. Images were captured with the Micropublisher 5.0 RTV Camera (QImaging), and catalogued,
stored, and analyzed using QCapture Pro imaging
software.
We calculated average times during which >50% of
observed embryos showed most of the morphological
characteristics of a particular stage. The embryos were
observed during pre-determined time periods based on
the reported Fundulus developmental data [8] and our
preliminary results.
The same embryos used to determine average time to
stage were used to determine heart rate during early
organogenesis (stage 31) and pre-hatching (stage 35).
A beating heart is formed, with both chambers completely differentiated and in full view by stage 31, and the
heart rate can be accurately determined from that stage
on. Individual embryos were placed on a depression
slide under the dissecting stereo microscope for 1 minute prior to taking heart rate measurements so that the
stressed embryo could re-establish resting heart beat
(most Fundulus embryos temporarily arrest their heart
beat due to a sudden change of environment, such as
transfer from the petri dish to a well-lit slide surface).
The heart rate of each embryo was measured by counting the number of heart beats for 30 seconds (preliminary results showed no change in the average heart beat
when counts were taken at either 30 second or 1 minute
intervals).
Differences among embryos were analyzed with Prism
Statistical Software using one-way Analysis of Variance
(1-way ANOVA, p < 0.05) for time-to-stage and heart
rate differences among embryo groups (families), respectively. A pairwise t-test (p < 0.05) was used to test the
differences of the means between families for both timeto-stage and heart rate.
Histology

Decisions to refer to a structure as a specific organ or
tissue were made using at least three criteria:
1. Spatial - position, relationship to other structures;
2. Temporal - time at which the structure first
appears;
3. Features of its tissue and cellular components.
All of these criteria were made possible by the publications of earlier works, which have defined stages in
development of various fish species [8,25-28]. Observations made with stereoscopic dissection microscopes at
relatively low magnification are sufficient to provide a

Bozinovic et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:132
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/132

list of structures for early cellular stages of development.
Similarly, as organ systems begin to appear, take on pigmentation and/or move, their presence provides markers
for consistent recognition of specific developmental
landmarks.
What has been less common is provision of detailed
histological sections with sufficient resolving power to
recognize organs, tissues and their component cell
types. Despite the strengths of differentiating stains and
greater magnification and resolution, the ability to orient
sections within the changing architectural plan of a
developing embryo is essential for accurate characterization to organ, tissue and cellular levels of organization.
In this work, we used horizontal-longitudinal, sagittal
and transverse sections. Horizontal-longitudinal sections
cleave the embryo into dorsal and ventral portions. This
is analogous to the frontal sections of mammalian
organisms. However, since the embryo is curved over
the yolk sac, a single plane of section is unlikely to be
maintained through the length of the embryo. Sagittal
sections cleave the embryo at the midline creating equal
right and left halves of the organism. Sections to the
side of the sagittal section are referred to as parasagittal.
Transverse sections separate rostral from caudal portions of the embryo.
Due to the fact that the embryo and the outer surface
of its associated yolk are curved, spatial relationships are
difficult to define in entirety. This is a result of the
embryo being inside spherical membranes and positioned flat upon a spherical surface subsequently maintained through processing by the cross-linking of
proteins in the fixed embryo. Given the above, histological sections yielding true planes completely defining all
of the above relationships are rare, if they exist at all.
Thus, we often were faced with sections skewed to
some degree, along dorsal-ventral, lateral to contralateral, lateral to medial, and/or horizontal to longitudinal
orientations. For continuity and for overall representation, we regard relationships seen nearly in their entirety
at lower magnification (10× objective) as valuable and
these are followed by analysis of smaller areas using
higher magnification and for the most part, differentiating power (i.e., the ability to distinguish one structure
from its neighbors) giving us the potential to label
organs, tissues and cells.
We chose late organogenesis of Fundulus development as a representative stage of major histological
structures. During this stage, the heart chambers are
fully differentiated and all the major organ systems are
developed and fully functional. Upon confirming the
stage and measuring the heart rate, the embryo pictures
were taken and catalogued, the embryos were fixed in
10% neutral buffered formalin for 24-48 hours and
stored overnight in 30% sucrose. The embryos were

Page 8 of 10

punctured through the chorion once, using the tip of a
hypodermic needle, transferred to the mesh tissue cassettes, and allowed to fix longer overnight due to the
thickness of chorionic membranes.
Embryos were embedded in paraffin, trimmed into 100
micron blocks and reinfiltrated in paraffin, and then
reimbedded into the block. Tissues were then embedded
for sectioning, which was done at 5 microns and placed
on Silanized coated slides. Embryos were stained with
hemotoxylin and eosin. Histological sections were viewed
under a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope, and the images
were taken using Lumenera Infinity 2 (model #2-2C) 2.0
megapixel, 12 fps, CCC color camera. Digital images
were analyzed using Eclipse Net Version 1.16.5 software.
Embryo RNA isolation, amplification, and labeling

Pools of frozen embryos collected at each developmental
stage were used for RNA isolation, labeling, and microarray hybridization. Four pools of 25 embryos were used
for stages 1-10, four pools of 15 embryos were used for
stages 11-15, and 4 pools of 10 embryos were used for
stages 16-40. Embryo RNA was extracted using a TRIzol ® buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Purified
RNA was quantified with a spectrophotometer, and
RNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis. RNA
for hybridization was prepared by one round of amplification (aRNA) using the Amino Allyl MessageAmp
aRNA Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) to form copy
template RNA by T7 amplification. Amino-allyl UTP
was incorporated into targets during T7 transcription,
and resulting amino-allyl aRNA was coupled to Cy3 and
Cy5 dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Labeled aRNA samples (2 pmol dye/ul) were hybridized
to slides in 10 ul of hybridization buffer [50% formamide
buffer, 5× SSPE, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2 mg/ml
bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm
DNA (Sigma), and 1 mg/ml RNAse free poly(A) RNA
(Sigma)] for 44 hours at 42°C. Slides were prepared for
hybridization by blocking in 5% ethanoloamine, 100 mM
Tris pH 7.8, and 0.1% SDS added just before use for 30
minutes at room temperature, washed for one hour in 4×
SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50°C, and then boiled for 2 minutes in
distilled water to denature the cDNAs. Resulting 16 bit
Tiff Images were quantified using ImaGene® (Biodiscovery, Inc.) spotfinding software. Controls and any gene that
did not have at least one individual with a signal greater
than the average signal from all herring sperm control
spots (non-specific hybridization signal) plus one standard
deviation were removed prior to statistical analyses. In
total, 6,789 genes were analyzed.
Microarrays

Amplified cDNA sequences for 7,000 genes from F. heteroclitus cDNA libraries were spotted onto epoxide

Bozinovic et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:132
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/132

slides (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) using an inkjet
printer (Aj100, ArrayJet, Scotland, UK). The cDNAs
used for the arrays were derived from libraries made
from all 40 stages of Fundulus development, immediately post-hatch whole larvae, and adult tissues. Each
slide contained four spatially separated arrays of ~7,000
spots (genes) including controls. All spotted genes were
sequenced and represent all of the unique contigs [29]
isolated from the cDNA libraries. Thus, even if multiple
sequences were annotated identically, they were treated
as different genes. Multiple sequences with the same
annotation do not contig together because: 1) they really
are the same gene, but the sequences do not overlap,
2) they represent duplicate genes with different chromosomal locations, or 3) they share a high similarity (and
hence are named based on this similarity) but are not
the same gene. We erred on the side of caution and
treated every gene-spot as unique. Each spot was analyzed as a separate gene for all analyses except the ribosomal correlations. For ribosomal correlations, only
ribosomal genes that also had unique names were correlated to minimize correlations among potentially the
same gene or recent gene duplicates. These ribosomal
genes were chosen arbitrarily as the first gene in the
gene list with a unique name.
Experimental design for microarrays

A double loop design was used for the microarray hybridizations where each sample is hybridized to 2 arrays
using both Cy3 and Cy5 labelled fluorophores [30,31].
The loop consisted of Cy3 and Cy5 labelled embryo
aRNAs from 4 biological pools for each of 40 stages (S).
In total, 160 biological pools were hybridized to 80
microarrays. Each array had different combinations of
biological pools [32]. The double loop formed was S1 ®
S2 ® S3® ... S40® S1 and S40® S39 ® S38 ® ... S2
® S1 ® S40 where each arrow represents a separate
hybridization (array) with the biological pool at the base
of the arrow labeled with Cy3 and the biological pool at
the head of the arrow labelled with Cy5.
To control for batch effects, the biological replicates
for each stage were randomized on arrays and were not
processed simultaneously, the same batch of arrays was
used for all hybridizations, and all arrays were processed
within three days.
Embryonic gene expression

Log 2 measures of gene expression were normalized
using a linear mixed model in JMP Genomics 3.2 (SAS,
Cary, NC, USA) to remove the effects of dye (fixed
effect) and array (random effect) following a joint regional and spatial Lowess transformation in MAANOVA

Page 9 of 10

version 0.98.8 for R to account for both intensity and
spatial bias (Additional File 8 shows representative MA
plots after normalization) [33].
The linear mixed model was of the form yij = μ + Ai +
D j + (AxD) ij + ε ij where, y ij is the signal from the i th
array with dye j, μ is the sample mean, A i and D j are
the overall variation in arrays (arrays 1-80) and dyes
(Cy3 and Cy5), (AxD)ij is the array × dye interaction
and ε ij is the stochastic error [34,35].
Residuals from the above model were used in a linear
mixed model to test for differences between stages on a
gene-by-gene basis. The model was rijk = μ + Ai + Dj + Tk
+ ε ijk where Tk is the kth treatment (stage 1-40, 39 d.f.),
the Dj effect is fixed (1 d.f.) and the Ai effect is random (79
d.f., leaving 40 d.f. for the residual error). We used a
similar analysis to test for differences between pre and
post-hatch embryos except the kth treatment represented
pre-hatch (stages 1-35) and post-hatch (stages 36-40). In
this analysis, we had 1 d.f. for dyes, 79 d.f. for arrays, and 1
d.f. for treatment, leaving 78 d.f. for the residual error.
For all mixed model analyses, we used a nominal p-value
cut-off for significant genes of p < 0.01. Using this p-value
reveals more genes that may be differentially expressed
but risks identifying genes that may be false positives.
Microarray data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene
Expression Omnibus [36] and are accessible through GEO
Series accession number GSE21372 http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE21372.
Hierarchical clustering used JMP Genomics 3.2, Cluster 3.0 for Mac OS X, and Java TreeView version 1.0.8
[37]. Correlation analyses were done in JMP Genomics
3.2 and MATLAB version 7.2 was used for visualization.
For peak expression, genes were ordered by their time
of peak expression and standardized least square means
were visualized. Separate peaks were defined as within
the 90% CI of the maximum transcript level measured
and at least 3 stages away from another peak.
