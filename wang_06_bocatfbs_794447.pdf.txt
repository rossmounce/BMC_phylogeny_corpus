Background

Snyder and colleagues [8] mapped nuclear factor (NF)-κB
binding sites in human chromosome 22 in a high-throughput
manner. A number of other publications have similarly
mapped the sites of other transcription factors [9,10]. ChIPchip technology has been applied to the human genome for a
variety of different factors [11]. Additionally, there are related
techniques such as ChIP-SAGE (serial analysis of gene
expression) [12-14]. Unfortunately, the ChIP-chip technique
and its variants are still time consuming, sensitive to the

information

Understanding the targets that are regulated by transcription
factors in the human genome is highly desirable in the postgenomic era. Some experimental methods, such as footprinting [2] and SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by
exponential evolution) [3], exist for identifying transcription
factor binding sites (TFBSs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip technology was introduced originally to
identify genomic binding regions of transcription factors in
yeast [4-6]. It was later applied to the human genome [7].
There have been many applications to single chromosomes in

human. ChIP-chip technology, otherwise known as microarray-based readout of chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays, is a procedure for mapping in vivo targets of transcription factors by ChIP with antibodies to a transcription
factor of interest in order to isolate protein-bound DNA, followed by probing a microarray containing genomic DNA
sequences with the immunoprecipitated DNA.

interactions

The diverse phenotypes from an invariant set of genes are
controlled by a biochemical process that regulates gene activity [1]. Transcription is central to the regulation mechanisms
in the process of gene expression. It is regulated by interplay
between transcription factors and their binding sites.

refereed research

Comprehensive mapping of transcription factor binding sites is essential in postgenomic biology.
For this, we propose a mining approach combining noisy data from ChIP (chromatin
immunoprecipitation)-chip experiments with known binding site patterns. Our method
(BoCaTFBS) uses boosted cascades of classifiers for optimum efficiency, in which components are
alternating decision trees; it exploits interpositional correlations; and it explicitly integrates massive
negative information from ChIP-chip experiments. We applied BoCaTFBS within the ENCODE
project and showed that it outperforms many traditional binding site identification methods (for
instance, profiles).

ular transcription factor's binding sites (hepatocyte nuclear
factor 4α) [22].

Many computational methods for identifying TFBSs have
been proposed in the literature [15-17]. Some of the methods
attempt to discover potential binding sites for any transcription factor given only a collection of unaligned promoter
regions for suspected coregulated genes (for example MEME
[18], AlignAce [Gibbs sampling] [19], and BioProspector
[20]). Other methods attempt to predict TFBSs for a specific
transcription factor given a collection of known binding sites
already available [15,21-23]. Our proposed method in this
paper is relevant to the latter problem.

An alternative approach, phylogenetic footprinting, identifies
functional regulation elements from noncoding DNA
sequence conservation between related species [31-33]. It has
successfully been applied to single genome loci, but this
method is limited by the short length of functional binding
sites and the large number of insertion/deletion events within
regulatory regions. There are also other methods, such as
maximal dependence decomposition [34] and the nonparametric method [35]. Singh and coworkers [15] evaluated traditional TFBS prediction methods and introduced perposition information content and local pair-wise nucleotide
dependencies to four major traditional methods (for further
detail, see Materials and methods, below). Their benchmark
results on Escherichia coli transcription factors indicated
that the best results were achieved by incorporating both perposition information content and local pair-wise correlation;
however, all of the conventional methods of TFBS prediction
generate a high false-positive rate when applied to the
genome [36].

Consensus sequences or regular expressions are still frequently used to depict the binding specificities of transcription factors. They represent a somewhat simplistic view of the
binding sequence and only work well in highly conserved
motifs because they do not contain useful information about
the relative likelihood of observing the alternate nucleotides
at different positions of a TFBS. However, variability is
believed to have a critical impact on the fine regulation of
gene expression. This makes it very difficult to identify all
potential binding sites without the aid of computational
techniques.
Another more common method is the profile method, also
known as positional specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or position weight matrix [21]. The largest and most commonly used
collection is the TRANSFAC database, which catalogs transcription factors, their known binding sites, and the corresponding profiles (PSSMs) [23]. In addition, a number of
tools such as MATRIX SEARCH [24], MatInd/MatInspector
[25], Mapper [26], SIGNAL SCAN [27], and rVISTA [28],
have been developed to enable the user to search an input
sequence for matches to a PSSM or a library of PSSMs. However, PSSMs treat each position of the binding sites as independent from each other. They cannot model the interactions
between positions within DNA-binding sites, nor can they
model explicit coevolution of related positions within binding
sites. PSSMs normally describe only a fixed length motif,
whereas many DNA-binding proteins can bind to variable
length sites. Finally, it is not always feasible to construct a
multiple alignment of the binding sites necessary to build a
PSSM.
Graphical models were also introduced to represent the
dependences between positions [29,30]. In particular,
Markov chains were utilized to statistically model the number
and relative locations of TFBSs within a sequence. Although
the hidden Markov model allows dependencies among positions to be encoded in the state transition probabilities [29],
not all dependencies are well treated systematically. An optimized Markov chain algorithm was introduced to integrate
pair-wise correlation into Markov models to predict a partic-

Local pair-wise correlation within TFBSs was discovered in
some recent experimental and theoretical research. Microarray binding experiments indicated that nucleotides of TFBSs
exert interdependent effects on the binding affinities of transcription factors [37]. Also, Kwiatkowski and coworkers [38]
showed that there are nucleotide positions in the TFBSs that
interact with each other by using principle coordinate analysis to predict the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms
within regulatory sequences on DNA-protein interactions.
Finding TFBSs is particularly challenging in the human
genome in comparison with simpler organisms such as yeast
and fly. TFBSs can occur downstream, upstream, or possibly
in the introns of the genes they regulate [8-10]. Moreover, the
human genome is about 200 times larger than the yeast
genome, and approximately 99% does not encode proteins.
Thus, it can be very difficult to find TFBSs in noncoding
sequences using relatively simple computational tools.
In this postgenomic era, comprehensive high-throughput
experiments (such as ChIP-chip) or gene annotation provides
a huge amount of information about sites that are not bound
by a factor, as well as some information about the sites that
are bound. In fact, such techniques provide better information about nonbinding sites than about binding sites because
the resolution of the binding sites is limited by the size of
probes in the ChIP-chip experiments and there are only limited binding regions detected, whereas there is a very large
amount of information on sites not bound. Moreover, the
ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project [39] is
expected to produce a surge in the availability of massive
ChIP-chip datasets.

in addition to positive samples in order to decrease the high
positive rate inherent in traditional methods such as PSSM.
Second, its efficient cascade structure quickly discards the
'easy' over-represented class samples and focuses on the
'harder' ones and the promising regions. This boosted cascade procedure improves the detection performance through
stages and decreases the computation time, which is an
important consideration for genome-scale applications.
Third, there is massive nonbinding site information and only
limited binding site information. Thus, classification may be
biased toward the over-represented class. The boosted cascade also solves the imbalance issue by random subset selection and removal of the over-represented set in an inherent,
natural way. Fourth, the BoCaTFBS method uses ADTboost
as the learner for each stage. It considers features from both
positions and relationships among positions within TFBSs.
ADTboost provides classification with a real-valued measurement, whose absolute value has been interpreted as a confidence measure. One of the features of ADTboost is that it
generates classification rules that are smaller and easier to
interpret than other machine learning methods (such as support vector machine and neural networks).

In principle, one could define an optimization framework in
which the number of classifier stages and the number of
boosting steps in each stage are traded off during the cascade
training. Unfortunately, finding this optimum is a difficult
and impractical problem [41,43]. In practice, a very simple
approach is used to produce an effective classifier empirically.
An arbitrary number of cascade stages and number of boosting steps in each stage may be predefined. These parameters
are adjusted and determined by testing on a randomly
selected small validation subset for good performance. The
boosting procedure will stop if adding one more base classifier or cascade stage increases the error for the reserved validation set. An example is shown in Figure 1. Two cascade
stages and 12 features in each stage are predefined for NF-κB
binding site prediction. This cascade predictor was tested by

refereed research

In this report we propose an efficient and effective classification method based on a boosted cascade of ADTboost in order
to predict the TFBSs, focusing on the human genome. Our
method (which we call 'BoCaTFBS') is specifically designed to
be coupled with ChIP-chip experiments. These experiments
only give an approximation of the locations of binding
regions, but they produce a massive amount of nonbinding
information. We use this massive nonbinding information
and the known binding information for prediction of the
binding sites. Our method efficiently integrates nonbinding
information as well as positional information and interpositional relationships. Thus, it has many advantages in identifying TFBSs. First, we trained BoCaTFBS with negative samples

In addition to presenting this method, we benchmarked performance of BoCaTFBS. We comprehensively compared it
with many traditional methods (PSSM, Centroid, Berg von
Hippel, consensus, and their improved variants), 'crippled'
BoCaTFBS, and single boosting algorithm. Moreover, we
applied BoCaTFBS to ongoing ENCODE projects.

deposited research

Efficiency and scalability are key challenges for handling
massive datasets in a boosting paradigm [42]. The amount of
nonbinding information in the whole human genome ChIPchip experiment is truly massive [39]. It is on the order of billions (3 million negative probes multiplied by their average
length of 1000 base pairs [bp]). It is critical to incorporate
efficiently the large scale negative, nonbinding information.
One of the issues for a standard boosting method is that it
must consider sequentially all of the positive and negative
instances at each iteration of the boosting process. However,
when the size of the dataset becomes very large, efficiency and
scalability issues arise. A straightforward static sampling over
such a large dataset may result in a significant loss of information and a potentially biased classifier. A standard boosting algorithm can not deal with such datasets efficiently [42].

Here we propose a general and robust method for automatically identifying TFBSs. Because an enormous amount of
nonbinding information has been generated from ChIP-chip
experiments, our new method should not only be able to utilize positional information and interpositional correlation in
TFBSs, but it should also systematically incorporate information from the numerous nonbinding sites.
Our method is designed to harness specifically this information about sites that are not bound. We call this negative
information 'massive nonbinding site information'. The nonbinding regions from yeast were recently used in another
computational method proposed by Hong and coworkers. In
particular, those investigators described a single boosting
approach (MotifBooster) and applied it to yeast ChIP-chip
data [40]. MotifBooster classifies the bound and nonbound
regions of ChIP-chip experiments, and represents a significant innovation by explicitly including the nonbinding region
information. A single boosting classifier using PSSMs as the
basis for its weak classifiers was trained over the yeast ChIPchip datasets. However, in the human genome, data become
substantially more massive and the distribution of the class
labels (binding or nonbinding) is even more skewed. As is
described below, to train a single boosting classifier can be
difficult for the whole human genome because of the computational inefficiency for training over massive datasets [41].

cross-validation, and shows 82% sensitivity (true positive
rate) at a 5% false-positive rate. The resulting classifier incorporates discriminative features, rather than just the descriptive features, and differentiates the binding sites from the
nonbinding sites. In contrast, the single ADTboost classifier
at the first cascade stage shows 71% true positive rate at 5%
false positive rate. It seems that the further stage refines the
positive prediction and increases the true positive rate over
the prior cascade stages.
Figure 2 shows the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis results based on the performance of these five
methods. Each ROC curve plots the percentage of correctly
predicted positive examples (true positive rate; specifically,
the ratio of true positives over the sum of true positives and
false negatives) as a function of the percentage of incorrectly
predicted negative examples (false positive rate; namely the
ratio of the false positives over the sum of false positives and
true negatives).
The results indicate that our BoCaTFBS method performs
consistently better than all four traditional methods. For
example, at the 5.5% false-positive rate level, the sensitivity of
our method is approximately 11% higher than the centroid,
BvH, and PSSM approaches. At each specificity level, the true
positive rate of our BoCaTFBS prediction method is clearly
higher than the other methods, whereas the false-positive
rate of our method is less than that with the other methods at
each sensitivity level. The consensus approach has the worst
performance, as anticipated; the other three traditional
methods had comparable performance. Additionally, for our
BoCaTFBS method, a P value was estimated by permuting the
dataset labels ('binding' or 'nonbinding') randomly and reevaluating the sensitivity rate at the same specificity level
(5.5%). We permuted the dataset 1000 times and found that
none of the classifiers had better sensitivity at the same specificity level. This shows empirically that the P value is less
than 1/1000.2

Comparison with positional information methods
We compared our BoCaTFBS method with the improved
methods reported by Singh and coworkers [15], which introduced the per-position information content and pair-wise
correlations with the four traditional methods (described in
Materials and methods, below). Cross-validation and comparative studies were performed between these methods and
our BoCaTFBS method on NF-κB binding prediction by ROC
analysis.
Figure 3 evaluated the performance of our BoCaTFBS method
and the other four methods incorporating the per-position
information content (IC). The results indicate that our
BoCaTFBS method consistently outperforms the other four
methods utilizing the per-position IC. At the 5.5% false-positive rate level, for example, our boosted cascade method outperforms the centroid-IC, BvH-IC, and PSSM-IC approaches

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/11/R102

by approximately 9%. At each specificity level, the true positive rate of our BoCaTFBS method is clearly higher than that
with the other methods, whereas at each sensitivity level the
false-positive rate of our BoCaTFBS method is lower than that
of the other four methods. The consensus-IC approach still
performs the worst, although it gains improvement by incorporating the per-position IC.
The performance of our BoCaTFBS method and the other
four methods incorporating both the local pair-wise correlations and per-position information content (pair IC) was evaluated in Figure 4. Although the centroid-pair IC, BvH-pair IC,
and PSSM-pair IC gain some improvement over their simpler
counterparts, our BoCaTFBS method still consistently has the
best performance. For example, at the 5.5% false-positive
rate, our boosted cascade method outperforms the centroidpair IC, BvH-pair IC, and PSSM-pair IC approaches by about
7% to 8%.

Demonstration of the value of non-binding information
from ChIP-chip experiments
ChIP-chip experiments distinguish between binding regions
and nonbinding regions for transcription factors [8].
Although the binding regions can only be narrowed down to
thousands of nucleotides instead of precise sites, the nonbinding regions from these experiments provide useful information for identifying TFBSs.
We evaluated the contribution of the negative information
from ChIP-chip experiments to the prediction capability of a
classifier. We did this by comparing the performance of the
normal BoCaTFBS built with ChIP-chip data and a specially
'crippled' classifier built without the negative information
from ChIP-chip data. For this 'crippled' classifier, we still
used the 52 NF-κB (p65) binding sites [38] as the positive
dataset. However, for the negative data pool for cascade training, we selected a total of 99,837 ten-nucleotide segments
randomly from among 16,944,132 DNA segments tiled on
chromosome 22 in the experimental design reported by Martone and coworkers [8]. That is, we picked negatives randomly from the segments used in the ChIP-chip experiment
without knowing their actual binding results in the ChIP-chip
experiment. The 52 known binding sites are excluded from
this negative picking process. Both the positive dataset and
negative data pool were utilized for 10-fold cross-validation
and ROC curve calculation. As shown in Figure 5, at each specificity level the sensitivity of this 'crippled' BoCaTFBS prediction without correct negative samples from ChIP-chip
experiments is about 7% to 8% below our normal BoCaTFBS
prediction using nonbinding information from ChIP-chip
experiments. Also, the results show that there is no improvement using our TFBS prediction method without nonbinding
information from ChIP-chip experiments against other prior
methods (centroid-pair IC, BvH-pair IC, and PSSM-pair IC).
The results indicate that ChIP-chip experiments provide

In this section, we describe how we applied our BoCaTFBS
method to the ENCODE regions of the human genome. These
ENCODE regions were selected because they are intensively
studied and we can investigate a variety of different transcription factors present in them. They provide an ideal platform
for assessing the scalability and applicability of the method to
the entire genome. The ongoing ENCODE project is making
more human genome-wide ChIP-chip experimental data
available [39]. Furthermore, we compared BoCaTFBS with
other benchmarks, including the single boosting method, on
the ENCODE regions.

Applications to the ENCODE project and further
comparisons

Three transcription factors (Sp1, cMyc, and P53) datasets
were retrieved from the work of Cawley and coworkers [44].
To obtain the positive training set, we used Clover, a program
for identifying functional sites in DNA sequences [45], on the
ChIP-chip binding regions (P < 10-5) to acquire the putative
binding sites on these regions. The source of motifs is the
JASPAR CORE collection of eukaryote TFBS patterns [46].
To avoid introducing more noise, we set a stringent threshold
using a Clover P value of 0.01, which indicates the probability
that the motif's presence in the target set can be explained just
by chance, to retrieve these binding sites. The putative binding sites on chromosome 22 were retrieved by Clover in this
way. There are 173 Sp1 binding sites, 627 cMyc binding sites,
and 43 P53 binding sites identified in these regions on chromosome 22. Moreover, the nonbinding sites were retrieved
based on the chromosome 22 sequence (14 September 2001,

Chromosome 22 Project website [48]. To simplify the problem, the preprocessing also included the application of
RepeatMasker [49], a program that screens DNA sequences
for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences
[47]. There are a total of 34,344,351 cMyc nonbinding sites,
34,539,027 Sp1 nonbinding sites, and 34,566,391 P53 nonbinding sites on chromosome 22. For simplicity, a sliding
window of five nucleotides was applied. Therefore, there are
6,869,066 cMyc nonbinding sites, 6,907,805 Sp1 nonbinding
sites, and 6,913,291 P53 nonbinding sites. Both the binding
sites and nonbinding sites were used for the training of the
algorithms and cross-validation.
We compared our BoCaTFBS method with other methods on
these three transcription factor datasets. The detection
results of the binding sites on chromosome 22 for all of these
three transcription factors (at false-positive rate 0.001) are
shown in Table 1. The parameters were set empirically: the
size of negative pool (δ) was set at 2000 arbitrarily; 25 cascade stages and 35 boosting steps for each stage were set for
the cMyc BoCaTFBS learner; 20 cascade stages and 28 boost-

ing steps for each stage were set for the Sp1 BoCaTFBS
learner; and three cascade stages and 25 boosting steps for
each stage were set for P53 BoCaTFBS learner. Moreover,
because there was a memory insufficiency problem for a single boosting learner to train over all the negative data, we
trained the single boosting learner from the positive training
set and a fairly large (50,000) negative training subset. The
number of iterations for the single boosting learner is the
number of cascade stages multiplied by the number of the
boosting steps per stage correspondingly. The results indicate
that our BoCaTFBS method and the single boosting method
performs consistently better than PSSM, centroid and BvH
methods, and the improved variants reported by Singh and
coworkers [15] (the consensus method performs consistently
worse than all other methods as expected). The findings indicate that the discriminative methods (BoCaTFBS and single
boosting method) take account of the discriminative features
extracted from nonbinding sites, in addition to the information from binding sites.
Thus, our BoCaTFBS method and the single boosting method
are capable of providing more accurate and delicate detection

FBS method uses the nonbinding site information and
improves the prediction accuracy of binding site identification. BoCaTFBS also incorporates the positional information
and inter-dependence between positions. There is an abundance of nonbinding information available from ChIP-chip

an efficient and scalable method, and serves as a powerful
complementary tool for experimental studies for identifying
potential target genes of a given transcription factor. We foresee that a combination of computational searches and experiments will become an efficient approach for the
identification of TFBSs.

of the binding sites. Moreover, BoCaTFBS performs better in
ENCODE applications than the single boosting method
trained on 'reduced-to-fit' datasets. This indicates that an
intelligent subsampling strategy embedded in BoCaTFBS cascade is more robust and efficient than a static 'reduce-to-fit'
sampling. Boosting is known as a sequential procedure that is
efficiently applicable only to relatively moderate datasets
[41,42]. A straightforward sampling over a massive volume of
data will possibly lose information and potentially become
biased. BoCaTFBS intelligently re-samples and discards the
'easy negatives' rapidly through the cascade process (see
Materials and methods, below). It avoids training over all the
massive negative data in the repetitive learning process and is
able to take more complete negative information into account
through the cascade.

Currently, the ENCODE project is creating an increased availability of massive ChIP-chip datasets. More ChIP-chip 'tracks'
will be available from the ENCODE browser for UCSC human
genome assembly [50-52]1. This trend has motivated us to
develop fast, scalable, and accurate approaches to ChIP-chip

data analysis and binding site recognition. The boosting technique has proved to be a good solution for differentiating true
binding targets in ChIP-chip data from yeast [40], which has
a small genome of only 16 megabases (Mb) of DNA. However,
a single boosting classifier has limitations on massive datasets, because the size of the dataset can be a bottleneck. One
has to load sequentially and train on all of the 'massive training samples' repetitively during each step in trying to learn a
single complex classifier [42]. This is impractical in many situations in human genomic research. Even in our simplified
example, where we only focused on ChIP-chip experimental
results of the second smallest human chromosome (chromosome 22), the enumeration of negative segments from NF-κB
nonbinding regions already takes 809 Mb in FASTA format
[8]. Furthermore, the Human Genome Project has finished
about 3 gigabases of sequence (released April 2003). Finally,
the highly skewed distribution of training samples makes the
classifier biased toward the dominant class, which is undesirable. The expanding large-scale human genomic ChIP-chip
datasets present a challenge that demands scalable and efficient methods.

ble' motif model that scores and classifies the bound and nonbound yeast ChIP-chip regions given a motif seed, whereas
our BoCaTFBS method aims to classify the precise binding
sites and massive nonbinding sites based on the human
genome-wide ChIP-chip experiments. Second, the base classifier for MotifBooster is based on position-specific scoring
matrix, whereas BoCaTFBS uses alternating decision trees
(ADTBoost) within the cascade, which directly takes into
account inter-position correlations as well as positional information. Finally, and most importantly, MotifBooster uses a
standard boosting algorithm [42] that does not scale to massive datasets [42]. Our BoCaTFBS method adopts a boosted
cascade framework [41], which provide an efficient and scalable method for massive and highly unbalanced datasets.
Therefore, BoCaTFBS has wide application in genome-wide
studies.

To handle massive datasets, it is necessary to bypass the need
for loading and repetitively training over the entire dataset in
the memory of a single computer as standard boosting
requires. Notably, the boosted cascade employed in our
BoCaTFBS method is computationally efficient by training
only over small subsets and cascading its training and evaluation. In particular, the technique of boosted cascade has
proved to perform extremely quickly in domains where the
distribution of the positive and negative examples is highly
skewed [41,53]. The key idea of the boosted cascade is that
smaller and therefore more efficient boosted classifiers based
on a small subset instead of the whole dataset can be constructed to reject many of the negatives while detecting most
of the positive instances. In the training, simple classifiers are
utilized to exclude the majority of the negatives and focus on
only false positives before more complex classifiers are called
upon to achieve a low false-positive rate. Therefore, BoCaTFBS avoids storing and training over all the massive amount
of negative information in the repetitive boosting process and
achieves optimal efficiency. In the testing, the cascade also
attempts to reject as many negatives as possible in the earliest
stages. Thus, the boosted cascade is one of the most efficient
algorithms when the distribution of the positive and negative
examples is highly unbalanced, like the TFBS identification
problem. The computational efficiency and scalability of our
BoCaTFBS method is very important given the large sizes of
chromosomes in the genome that need to be scanned. As the
running time of our BoCaTFBS method is in minutes when

applied to our experiments on chromosome 22, we can estimate that our method will most likely finish in hours when
applied to the whole genome.

Conclusion

In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of gene
regulation, a robust method is required to discriminate
TFBSs from nonbinding sites on a genomic scale. Experimental methods such as ChIP-chip experiments, although gaining
great success, remain time-consuming, expensive, and noisy.
Traditional computational methods for binding site identification, such as consensus sequences, profile methods, and
hidden Markov models, are known to generate high false-positive rates when applied on a genome-wide basis. They are
based on training only with positive data, which are small
number of known binding sites. Thus, we were motivated to
propose a new computational method (BoCaTFBS) to discover TFBSs that combines the noisy data from ChIP-chip
experiments with known positive binding site patterns.
Our method uses a boosted cascade of classifiers, in which
each component is an individual alternating decision tree (an
ADTBoost classifier). It uses known motifs, taking advantage
of the inter-positional correlations within the motifs, and it
explicitly integrates the massive amount of negative data
from ChIP-chip experiments. We tune BoCaTFBS to reduce
the false-positive rate when applied genome-wide and use the

In order to predict the TFBSs, we employ a form of supervised
machine learning: a number of ADTboost learners coupled in
a boosted cascade. ADTboost is a special extension of AdaBoost. For clarity, we introduce our algorithm for identifying
TFBSs in a logical order of AdaBoost, ADTboost, and Boosted
Cascade (see the supplementary website [54]).
Initially, we start with the following type of data. In the training stage of TFBS prediction, its input is (x1, y1) ... (xn, yn),
where each xi belongs to an instance space of a string of four
nucleotides (A, T, G, C) corresponding to each position in the
TFBSs and yi belongs to label set Y = {+1,-1} (where +1 represents 'binding' and -1 represents 'nonbinding' for a given transcription factor).

Given the scale of the human genome and the noisiness and
error in both the purely computational predictions and the
ChIP-chip experiments, we feel that this hybrid approach,
which combines ChIP-chip data with efficient computational
learning, provides promise for the future. We envision that
when more data are available from larger experiments, we
will be able to refine our classifier further, thereby achieving
a lower false-positive rate.

consideration for genome-scale applications. We show that
BoCaTFBS outperforms many traditional binding site identification methods (such as profiles) in terms of sensitivity and
specificity. We also show how its improvement is directly tied
to the inclusion of the negative information from ChIP-chip
experiments. Moreover, we show that BoCaTFBS can be successfully applied in the ongoing ENCODE project, which aims
to identify all functional elements in the human genome
sequence.

In this report we utilize a special extension of AdaBoost called
the alternating decision tree (ADTboost). AdaBoost is used to

AdaBoost generates the 'alternating decision tree' from the
training data (as described above) as the detailed algorithm in
Figure 7 shows [57]. In the testing stage, the alternating tree
maps each instance to a real valued prediction, which is the
sum of the predictions of the base rules in its set along the
related paths in the tree that actually incorporates positional
information and inter-positional relationships by logical
combination. The classification of an instance is the sign of
the prediction. In order to explain the concept in a simple
way, we utilize a straightforward example. This example,
shown in Figure 8, predicts some molecules' DNA-binding

cal difficulties of earlier boosting methods [55,56]. It takes
the training data as described above. AdaBoost repeatedly
calls a given base learning algorithm in t rounds. Wt(i) represents the weight of the distribution on training example i on
round t (set of weights over the training examples). At each
iteration t, the base learner is utilized to find a weak hypothesis ht: X → {-1,+1} appropriate for the distribution. The
weights will be updated. Usually, the weights of incorrectly
classified examples are increased so that the base learner is
forced to concentrate on the hard examples in the training set.
The base learner is called again with new weights over the
training examples, and the process repeats. At last, all the
weak hypotheses are combined into a single, strong hypothesis using a weighted majority vote (see algorithm details in
Figure 6).

A simple example of the alternating decision tree (ADTboost). The alternating decision tree contains splitter nodes (squares, associated with a test) and
prediction nodes (circles, associated with a value). Each prediction node represents the results of a weak prediction rule. The number in the prediction
nodes (circles) defines the contributions to the prediction score. In this example, negative contributions are evidence of nonbinding, whereas positive
contributions are evidence of binding. The position and nucleotide features are used for constructing the weak prediction rule. In order to evaluate the
prediction for a particular DNA sequence, we begin from the top node and follow the arrows down. We sum all the values at all the prediction nodes
reached. This sum represents the prediction score, and its sign is the prediction by default. For instance, in the DNA sequence of AACGCTAATA, the
nucleotide at position 1 is A, the nucleotide at position 3 is C, position 4 is not A, position 5 is not T, position 6 is not G, and position 7 is A. Applying the
alternating decision tree in the figure to this, we derive the following prediction nodes: +0.541 (from A at position 1), +0.425 + -0.444 (from C at position
3 followed by not A), +0.441 + -0.167 (from not T at position 5, followed by not G), and +0.138 (from A at position 7). Notice that we do not refer to
position 2 and other positions because they are not relevant to the rules here. The overall sum of all the nodes is +0.803, a confident score indicating that
this is predicted to be a binding site.

Datasets for application of the method
We utilized transcription factor NF-κB (p65) as the test case
for our methods. The 52 NF-κB (p65) binding sites [38] are
used as the positive dataset. For simplicity, a total of 99,837
nonbinding sites for NF-κB from ChIP-chip experimental
data on human chromosome 22 [8] were utilized as the
negative data pool for cascade training. These 99,837
nonbinding sites were randomly chosen from the 16,775,258
nonbinding sites from the ChIP-chip experiments to facilitate
computation. In the training cascade, each negative subset δ,
consisting of 3000 sequences, was randomly chosen from the
screened negative training set N. Both the positive dataset
and negative data pool were utilized for repeated tenfold
cross-validation and ROC curve analysis. The ROC curves for
every prediction method were averaged vertically based on
repeated tenfold cross-validation in order to evaluate the performance of each prediction method [58].

Other TFBS prediction methods compared
We compared the performance of our method with those of
other TFBS prediction methods and their advanced extensions (Table 2). We only very briefly describe these methods
as follows. At first, we considered four basic methods
(consensus, PSSM, BvH, and centroid), and then considered
enhancements to those methods and a crippled version of
BoCaTFBS, and finally MotifBooster.

Consensus
The consensus method is the simplest method for TFBS prediction. For each position, if the frequency of the most frequent base is larger than 0.5, then this base is the consensus
base for the position. Otherwise, if the sum of the frequencies

is larger than 0.75, then these two bases are the consensus
bases. If neither of the preceding is true, then there is no con-

The detection process is also represented as a 'cascade'. A positive result from the first classifier triggers the evaluation of
the second classifier, which has also been adjusted to achieve
very high detection rates. A positive result from the second
classifier triggers a third classifier, and so on. A negative outcome at any point leads to immediate rejection. Figure 9 panels a and b depict the training and detection cascades,
respectively.

We also applied our method to the ChIP-chip datasets from
the ENCODE project. Three transcription factors (Sp1, cMyc,
and P53) datasets were retrieved from the work of Cawley and
coworkers [44]. The ChIP-chip binding regions of these three
new transcription factors are available on the world wide web

To train a cascade of classifiers, we can construct boosted
classifiers that reject many of the negative instances while
detecting almost all the positive instances; specifically, the
threshold of a boosted classifier can be adjusted so that the
false-negative rate is close to zero. The process of training a
cascade of classifiers is an iterative process. First, randomly
choose a negative training subset δ from the negative training
set N. Second, train a classifier C(i) with a positive training set
P and the chosen negative training subset δ using ADTboost.
Third, adjust the threshold to minimize the false negatives (to
make all the positive training samples predict 'positive').
Fourth, screen the negative training set N by the adjusted
threshold in step three to arrive at set N'. Fifth, redefine N' to
be the negative training set N. Finally, repeat this process
above until some predefined criteria is met to stop the
cascade.

For TFBSs, there are a number of binding sites (positive training sets) and a significantly large quantity of nonbinding sites
(negative training sets). In machine learning, besides the
scalability and efficiency issues, an imbalance problem also
arises when there is a great size disparity between the positive
and negative training sets. This imbalance problem could lead
to accurate prediction of the over-represented class but
unfortunately incorrect prediction of the under-represented
class. To solve these problems, an algorithm for constructing
a cascade of classifiers [41] was developed, achieving excellent detection performance while radically reducing
computation time. Our BoCaTFBS method uses such a cascade of classifiers for the TFBS identification problem.

Acknowledgements

Singh and coworkers [15] introduced information content
(IC) and local pair-wise correlation concept into these four
basic methods to augment the prediction performance. They
extended the four methods above by incorporating pair-wise
dependencies. The notion of scope delimits the pairs that are
considered correlated into the scoring scheme. IC is an
important concept based on the information theoretic notion
of entropy. The entropy of a binding site position expresses
the number of bits necessary to describe that position, and the
information content of a position is defined as the difference
between the position's maximum possible entropy and its
entropy. They incorporated the per-position information content as a multiplicative factor to weigh the contribution of
each position (or pair of positions) in scoring a target binding
site sequence. Based on the benchmark results on E. coli
TFBS predictions reported by Singh and coworkers [15], the
use of per-position IC improves the performance of the four
traditional methods in many cases, and the best prediction
results were obtained by incorporating both IC and local pairwise correlations.

To evaluate the contribution of negative information from
ChIP-chip experiments, we also use a 'crippled' BoCaTFBS as
a benchmark. The only difference between 'crippled' and
normal BoCaTFBS is that the 'crippled' one is built without
the negative information from ChIP-chip data.

MotifBooster and related method
Hong and coworkers [40] introduced a standard boosting
approach to model transcription factor-DNA binding using
yeast ChIP-chip data. It constructs an ensemble motif model,
which scores and classifies bound and nonbound regions in
ChIP-chip experiments. The base classifiers of MotifBooster
