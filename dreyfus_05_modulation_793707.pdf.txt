Abstract
Background: In this work we present evidence that the p53 tumor suppressor protein and NF-κB
transcription factors could be related through common descent from a family of ancestral transcription
factors regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis. P53 is a homotetrameric transcription factor known
to interact with the ankyrin protein 53BP2 (a fragment of the ASPP2 protein). NF-κB is also regulated by
ankyrin proteins, the prototype of which is the IκB family. The DNA binding sequences of the two
transcription factors are similar, sharing 8 out of 10 nucleotides. Interactions between the two proteins,
both direct and indirect, have been noted previously and the two proteins play central roles in the control
of proliferation and apoptosis.
Results: Using previously published structure data, we noted a significant degree of structural alignment
between p53 and NF-κB p65. We also determined that IκBα and p53 bind in vitro through a specific
interaction in part involving the DNA binding region of p53, or a region proximal to it, and the amino
terminus of IκBα independently or cooperatively with the ankyrin 3 domain of IκBα In cotransfection
experiments, κBα could significantly inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53. Inhibition of p53-mediated
transcription was increased by deletion of the ankyrin 2, 4, or 5 domains of IκBα Co-precipitation
experiments using the stably transfected ankyrin 5 deletion mutant of κBα and endogenous wild-type p53
further support the hypothesis that p53 and IκBα can physically interact in vivo.
Conclusion: The aggregate results obtained using bacterially produced IκBα and p53 as well as
reticulocyte lysate produced proteins suggest a correlation between in vitro co-precipitation in at least one
of the systems and in vivo p53 inhibitory activity. These observations argue for a mechanism involving direct
binding of IκBα to p53 in the inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity, analogous to the inhibition of NFκB by κBα and p53 by 53BP2/ASPP2. These data furthermore suggest a role for ankyrin proteins in the
regulation of p53 activity. Taken together, the NFκB and p53 proteins share similarities in structure, DNA
binding sites and binding and regulation by ankyrin proteins in support of our hypothesis that the two
proteins share common descent from an ancestral transcriptional factor.

Background
In this work we present evidence that the p53 tumor suppressor and NF-κB transcription factors could be related
through common descent from a family of ancestral transcription factors regulating cellular proliferation and
apoptosis. P53 and related proteins are transcription factors that regulate DNA repair and cellular apoptosis in
response to stress and injury, notably those resulting in
DNA damage [1-4]. Although it is a non-essential gene,
loss of p53 function in humans through hereditary syndromes is associated with a markedly increased rate of
malignancy. Furthermore, over 50% of malignancies have
mutated p53 alleles [5]. These observations suggest p53
and related proteins function as a checkpoint for malignant transformation either by repairing DNA damage or
by eliminating cells with irreparably damaged DNA [6-8]
P53 is a homotetrameric transcription factor that binds a
consensus sequence 5' RRRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY-3' (where
R indicates purine, A or G; and Y indicates pyrimidine, C
or T)[9]. The consensus sequence is usually present as a
dimer in p53 inducible gene promoters such as the
p21WAF1 protein regulating cell cycle progression [10]. P53
protein can be divided into three functional domains, the
amino-terminal activation domain encompassing amino
acids 1–43, the core sequence-specific DNA-binding
domain (amino acids 100–300), and the multi-functional
carboxy-terminal domain (amino acids 300–393)
[11,12]. Point mutations in p53 identified in malignant
cells are clustered around volutionarily conserved regions
in the DNA binding region of p53 and simultaneously
eliminate both sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activity [12-14].
P53 is regulated on multiple levels including post-translationally by modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, protein degradation, and protein-protein
interaction [15,16]. Phosphorylation of p53 induces conformational changes that alter interactions with regulatory proteins such as MDM2, which in turn can regulate
p53 stability, and can also activate site-specific DNA binding activity [17-22]. Additional cellular proteins that bind
to p53 include proteins of the general transcription
machinery such as CBP/p300 [23,24]. CBP/p300 binding
to p53 regulates acetylation and p53 transcriptional activation [25,26]. P53 is also regulated through association
with ankyrin repeat proteins such as p53 binding protein
1 (53 BP1) and p53 binding protein 2 (53BP2, now
known to be a fragment of apoptosis stimulating protein
of p53 or ASPP2) [27] and gankyrin [28,29]. Thus, it is
likely that p53 is modulated by association with and/or
modification by a variety of regulatory proteins including
kinases, transcription factors, and ankyrin-containing
proteins. In addition, viral proteins also bind to and modify p53 and may contribute to malignant transformation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/6/12

of infected cells by viruses such as papilloma [30,31],
cytomegalovirus
[32],
and
Epstein-Barr
virus
(EBV)[33,34].
NF-κB transcription factors also play a central role in the
control of apoptosis [35-37]. NF-κB transcription factors
bind to the consensus sequence 5'-GGRNNYYCC-3' in the
promoters of both cellular and viral genes [38,39]. The
RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB is regulated by the ankyrin
repeat protein IκBα which masks the nuclear localization
signal of the p65/p50 NF-κB heterodimer [40,41]. NF-κBinducing signals are transmitted from the cell surface to
the cytoplasm resulting in site-specific phosphorylation at
two sites in the N-terminus of IκBα [42-45], conjugation
of ubiquitin molecules to IκBα, and subsequent degradation of ubiquitinated IκBα by the 26S proteasome complex [46-49]. Degradation of IκBα in turn unmasks the
nuclear localization signal of p50/p65 followed by translocation of the active transcription factor to the nucleus.
Other NF-κB subunits including a homodimer of the p50
subunit also bind IκBα [50]. IκBα deficient animals while
viable, die of uncontrolled inflammation in infancy, and
mice overexpressing IκBα display an abnormal immunologic repertoire suggesting that a major physiologic role of
IκBα is to limit immune and inflammatory responses
through a feedback pathway [35,51,52].
Interactions between p53 and NF-κB have been noted, for
example both factors compete for a binding site in the regulatory factor CBP/p300 [53]. Transfection of a constitutively active form of IκBα protein can block p53
dependent cell death [54-56] and p53 regulatory factors
can modulate NF-κB pathways [57-59]. Not only are p53
and NF-κB transcription coregulated under a variety of
physiological conditions, but similarity has been noted
between the crystal structures of p53 and NF-κB p50
[14,60-62]. Both proteins contain a similarly sited zinc
atom that coordinates site specific DNA binding and similar secondary and tertiary organization, but no primary
amino acid similarity was noted between the two proteins. Furthermore, p65 has been shown to bind the
ankyrin protein p53-binding protein 2 (53BP2). 53BP2
has been shown to be a fragment of a larger protein,
ASPP2, that promotes the apoptotis-inducing effects of
p53 [27]. P65 apparently inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis by binding to 53BP2/ASSP2 [63]. As with p53, NF-κB
transcription is altered by viral pathogens [64-67].
In this work, we present evidence for the specific binding
of the NF-κB inhibitor and ankyrin protein, IκBα, to p53.
A physical interaction between p53 and IκBα was also
reported by Chang [68], as well as Zhou, et al. [69], and
was shown to be regulated by proapoptotic and growth
suppressing stimuli. Our studies show the binding interaction to involve both ankyrin and non-ankyrin

sequences in the IκBα protein, and the DNA binding core
domain of p53. We demonstrate that transient expression
of IκBα is associated with NF-κB independent decreases in
p53 mediated transcription of a p53 reporter gene in vivo.
These observations were made in Akata cells, an EBVgenome positive lymphoblastoid cell line originally
derived from a Burkitts lymphoma. Akata cells lack
endogenous functional p53 [33]. We propose that the
binding of the ankyrin protein IκBα to p53 is based upon
the similarity in molecular structure of NF-κB and p53.

Results

Similarity between p53 and NF-κB transcription element
binding sites
The hemi-dyad DNA consensus binding sites of p53 and
NF-κB transcription factors are intriguingly similar as has
been noted previously by Foo, et al., [70]; for p53, the
binding site sequence is 5'-RRRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY-3' and
for NF-κB the binding site sequence is 5'- GGGRNNYYCC3' where N, R, and Y indicate any nucleotide, purine (A or
G), and pyrimidine (C or T), respectively. Two changes in
the nucleotide sequence of the C(A/T)(A/T)G core (underscored, above) of a p53 binding site is sufficient to generate the RNNY core (underscored, above) of a NF-κB
binding site while sequences flanking the core are conserved. Depending on the specific sequences, these binding sites potentially encode a hairpin structure that could
promote these nucleotide substitutions. Under these circumstances, only one mutagenic event would be necessary, since the second nucleotide exchange could occur by
excision-repair following a mutagenic event in the first
site. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that both
regulatory factors shared descent from a common ancestral transcription factor, a proto-p53/NF-κB. An alternative possibility is that two independent families of
transcription factors, proto-p53 and proto-NF-κB, converged to independently recognize a similar recognition
sequence.

If both p53 and NF-κB descended from a common ancestral protein, they might retain the ability to bind to common proteins or proteins of related structures in addition
to binding similar DNA sequences. With independent
descent converging upon a similar DNA binding sequence
no such common interactions would be expected. In support of descent from a common ancestral protein, the
crystal structure of NF-κB p65 aligns with that of p53 (Figure 1B and 1D, discussed below) a relationship that
would not be expected unless the two proteins were
related through phylogeny (descent) as well as ontogeny
(function). Furthermore, numerous p53 binding proteins
have in common the ankyrin repeat structure, a feature
shared with the IκB family of NF-κB regulatory proteins.

Structural alignment of p53 and p65 and ankyrin proteins,
53BP2 and IκBα
To test the hypothesis that p53 and p65 may share structural homology, the known crystal structures of both molecules were aligned using the program C3D4.1 [71]. P53
(Figure 1A) has previously been crystallized in association
with the ankyrin protein 53BP2 (Figure 2C) [28]. Like
IκBα (Figure 2A), 53BP2 is also an ankyrin protein and
has been identified as a fragment of a larger protein
known as ASPP2 (apoptosis stimulating protein of p53)
[27]. The structure of p65 (Figure 1C) is taken from the
crystal structure of the dimer comprised of p65 and p50 in
association with IκBα [50]. P65 has also been crystallized
as a homodimer in association with IκBβ [72].

We used the information content algorithm of C3D4.1
which uses a BLOSUM62 based matrix to calculate conservation between the two pairs of proteins: p53 and p65
(Figure 1E); and IκBα and 53BP2 (Figure 2E). The amino
acids colored red in the aligned structures of 1D and 2D
and the amino acid sequences of 1E and 2E depict regions
of highest conservation while the grey areas are regions
where there is no conservation. As shown by the regions
of the two molecules colored red, we observed a surprising degree of structural alignment between the Rel homology domain of p65 and the p53 core domain, supposedly
unrelated molecules (Figure 1D). The sequence alignment
corresponding to the structures in 1D is depicted in 1E.
Using these same methods, we aligned the structures of
the ankyrin proteins, IκBα [50] and 53BP2 (Figure 2D and
2E). The structure used for IκBα (Figure 2A) contains 71–
280 of the wild-type protein. We omitted the SH3 domain
of the 53BP2 structure (Figure 2C) since it is not relevant
to this report. The IκBα protein contains six ankyrin
motifs while the 53BP2 contains four. As expected, the
two ankyrin proteins show a high degree of alignment.
The fourth and 5th ankyrins of IκBα are in very close alignment to the second and third ankyrins of 53BP2 (Figure
2D). The sequences corresponding to these structures is
shown in Figure 2E.
Specific binding between IκBα and p53 occurs in vitro
Purified IκBα protein was specifically labelled in vitro with
[32P] using p90rsk which we have previously shown to
quantitatively phosphorylate IκBα. [32P] -labeled IκBα
was incubated with purified p53 (GST-p53) and precipitated either with glutathione/Sepharose (Seph-GSH)
beads to bind the glutathione binding tag on GST-p53 or
a p53-specific antibody (Ab2) and protein A/G beads. As
shown in Figure 3, evidence of a specific association
between purified bacterially-produced p53 and purified
bacterially-produced wild-type IκBα was observed in vitro
(Fig. 2A). The conformation-specific p53 antibody (Ab5)
does not recognize bacterially produced p53

Purified IκBα protein was specifically labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using p90rsk (lane 5). [32P]-labeled IκBα was incubated with purified p53 (GST-p53, lanes 1–3) or a control GST fusion protein (GST-c-Jun, lane 4). P53 was precipitated either by a glutathione
binding tag on GST-p53 and glutathione Sepharose beads (Seph-GSH, lane 1) or a p53 specific antibody (Ab2, lane 2) and protein A/G Sephadex beads. IκBα protein (position indicated) was not precipitated by p53 specific Ab5 (lane 3) that does not recognize bacterially synthesized p53 protein, or by incubation with GST-c-Jun and precipitation with glutathione Sepharose beads
(lane 4). Proteins were separated by PAGE and detected by autoradiography of [32P]-labeled protein. Electrophoresis of the

P53/ IκBα complexes were then precipitated with glutathione Sepharose beads and
analyzed by PAGE/Western blotting. In the left panels, ∆N1 and ∆A2 proteins were detected using a rabbit polyclonal antisera

(unpublished observations), and Ab5 was used as a control for non-specific association between IκBα and antibody or Protein A/G beads. A c-Jun protein with a
glutathione binding protein tag (GST-c-Jun) was used as a
control for non-specific association between IκBα and
glutathione beads. As shown, no association between control proteins or antibodies was evident.
Relatively decreased in vitro binding between IκBα and
p53 results from deletion of the N-terminus of IκBα
Initial experiments conducted with both p53 and IκBα
made in bacterial cells supported the hypothesis that the
p53 protein could bind to IκBα. Post-translational modifications of the proteins when expressed in eukaryotic
cells could affect the interactions noted, particularly with
respect to relative binding affinities of mutant proteins.
Furthermore, bacterially produced protein may differ in
conformation to those produced in mammalian hosts.
Overexpression of IκBα alleles in COS cells was used to
confirm that binding to p53 was evident with IκBα produced in vivo and also to map the p53 binding to sites
within IκBα. Only some alleles of IκBα can be overexpressed in COS cells including IκBα deleted of N-terminal
regulatory sequences, denoted ∆N1(missing amino acids
2–36), ∆A2 (missing amino acids 110–136), and ∆C1
deleted of the PEST-containing non-ankyrin C- terminus
(amino acids 264–317). A schematic of deletion mutants
of IκBα used is depicted in Figure 3C.

After expression of IκBα in COS cells, whole cell lysates
were co-precipitated with bacterially produced purified
GST-p53 (Figure 3B). These experiments confirmed that
binding between the proteins was not related to production of an aberrant form of the IκBα protein in bacterial
cells since alleles of IκBα protein produced in COS cells
were enriched by incubation and co-precipitation with
GST-p53. In representative experiments shown, relatively
less ∆N1 protein protein co-precipitated with GST-p53
from COS cell lysates as compared to the proportions of
∆A2 or ∆C1 IκBα proteins associating with p53 suggesting
that binding between the proteins at least in part required
an intact N-terminal region of IκBα. Relative co-precipitation of the C-terminally deleted form of IκBα was comparable to that of wild-type protein (wild-type data not
shown), suggesting that the amino acids 264–317 of IκBα
was not important for binding to p53.
The binding between IκBα and p53 is disrupted by an
antibody to the DNA-binding region of p53
Experiments detailed above confirmed that a specific
binding association occurs between IκBα and p53 in vitro.
Further experiments were designed to approximate the
region on p53 responsible for IκBαbinding by use of
epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. Glutathionesepharose beads (G) were used to precipitate p53 (Figure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/6/12

4A, lane 1, and 4B, lanes 1 and 5) and were found to coprecipitate IκBα. A monoclonal antibody directed at
amino acids 46–55 in the amino terminus of p53 (Ab2)
recognized purified bacterially produced p53 (4B, lanes 2
and 6) and also co-precipitated IκBα with p53 (4A, lane
2). In contrast, a different p53-specific monoclonal antibody directed at amino acids 212–217 within the DNA
binding core of p53 (Ab3), while able to recognize and
precipitate bacterially produced p53 protein (4B, lanes 3
and 7), did not co-precipitate IκBa (4A, lane 4). These
observations suggested that the binding site between purified IκBα and p53 in part coincided with the Ab3 epitope,
a region which is within the p53 DNA binding core. Alternatively, the antibody could hinder or disrupt IκBα binding to regions near the recognized. epitope or alter the
structure of p53 into a conformation unfavorable for IκBα
binding.
Overexpression of wild-type IκBα modulates p53
dependent transcription of a synthetic p53 reporter gene
in vivo
In vitro studies supported the hypothesis that a direct
physical association between p53 and IκBα can occur but
they did not provide evidence that such interactions occur
in vivo. We hypothesized that transient overexpression of
IκBα in cells with co-transfected transcriptionally active
p53 might reveal effects of IκBα upon p53 mediated transcription. Using forced overexpression of both proteins
from identical viral CMV promoter elements rather than
endogenous promoters would eliminate confounding
transcriptional effects of IκBα upon transcription of p53
or vice versa. Any effect of NF-κB upon CMV would be normalized as well.

Akata cells were used because these B-lymphoblastoid
cells are known to lack endogenous p53. Neither the wildtype nor a mutant protein is expressed that could complicate interpretation of results. P53 transiently transfected
into these cells using dextran sulfate is transcriptionally
active. As a control for non-specific effects of transfected
plasmid DNA, effects of IκBα expression plasmids were
compared to co-transfected plasmid containing an identical CMV promoter element (pCMV). Results shown were
also normalized to expression of co-transfected pRL-SV40,
a plasmid expressing a second form of luciferase as a control for cell viability and transfection efficiency. We found
that wild-type IκBα was associated with decreased p53dependent transcription of the p53 reporter gene
pG(13)PyLuc in Akata cells (Figure 5). Increasing the relative ratio of transfected expression plasmids between
IκBα and p53 from 1:1 (equivalent to 200 ng IκBα plasmid transfected) to 10:1 (equivalent to 2000 ng IκBα plasmid transfected) demonstrated a dose response effect that
varied with different IκBα alleles. Immunoblotting for wtp53, ∆C-p53, and IκBα alleles show relatively equivalent

Purified p53 with a glutathione binding protein epitope tag (GST-p53) and purified IκBα protein were incubated together in

Ab2 (lane 3), Ab3 (lane 4), or Ab5 (lane 5) and Sephadex protein A/G beads. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDSPAGE and detected by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the N-terminus of IκBα. Mobility
of IκBα protein is indicated (lane 1). This also represents the total input IκBα. Similar quantities of murine immunoglobulin
heavy chain (HC, lane 6) were precipitated by protein A/G beads and served as the negative control. B. GST-p53 was quantitatively precipitated in the absence (- IκBα) or presence (+ IκBα) of IκBα by glutathione Sepharose (denoted G, lanes 1,5), Ab2
(lanes 2,6), and Ab3 (lanes 3,7), but not Ab5 (lanes 4,8), as detected with a rabbit polyclonal p53 antiserum. This blot is essentially identical to that shown in panel A but for the antibody used in the Western blotting step. Since Ab5 did not precipitate
GST-p53, it served as a negative control for non-specific association between IκBα protein and either antibody or protein A/G
beads.

Transient transfection of IκBα alleles specifically blocks p53 transcription in EBV-positive Akata cells
Figure 5
Transient transfection of IκBα alleles specifically blocks p53 transcription in EBV-positive Akata cells. A. 200 ng of a p53dependent reporter plasmid encoding 13 copies of the p53 response element driving a firefly luciferase (pG(13)Py/Luc) were
cotransfected into 2 × 105 cells with 1 ng of an SV40 promoter driven Renilla luciferase (pRLSV40) and 200 ng of a CMV-promoter driven wild-type p53 cDNA construct (wt-p53, denoted below the x-axis) or a C-terminally deleted transcriptionally
active p53 (∆C-p53, denoted below the x-axis). The effect of 800 ng of CMV-promoter driven IκBα alleles or a control construct that did not contain DNA encoding IκBα (to which all data were normalized) were used to determine the effect of IκBα
on wild-type p53-mediated transcription of pG(13)Py/Luc while 1600 ng of CMV-promoter driven IκBα alleles (or control)
were used in experiments where the ∆C-p53 allele was used. Immunoblotting controls for wt-p53, ∆C-p53 and IκBα alleles. B:

protein levels for these proteins in these extracts (Figure
5B–D).
Allele specific modulation of p53 transcription by IκBα are
independent of the effects of the alleles on NF-κB
transcription in vivo
The wild-type IκBα protein is subject to signal-dependent
phosphorylation and subsequent degradation leading to
release of inhibition of NF-κB. Deletion (e.g. as in the ∆N
allele deleting amino acids 2–36) or mutation of the
phosphorylation sites (S32 and S36) in the amino terminus of IκBα leads to a stable mutant that constitutively
represses NF-κB transcription. Cotransfection at a 1 to 1
ratio of ∆N1 to p53 expression plasmid (200 ng each of
p53 and IκBα plasmid transfected) had no significant
effects upon p53 transcription (data not shown). Increasing the relative ratio of ∆N1 expression plasmid to p53
showed that at higher ratios, ∆N1 could significantly
decrease p53-dependent transcription (Figure 5A, inhibition of the constitutively active ∆C-p53 is shown at 1600
ng ∆N1 plasmid. Similar results were obtained when the
ratio of ∆N1 to wild-type p53 was increased to 8:1, data
not shown). However, at the lower ratio of 4:1 shown for
the wild-type p53 allele, in Figure 5A, there was little inhibition of transcriptional activity by ∆N1. The relatively
poor inhibitory activity of ∆N1 towards p53 is consistent
with its relatively poor binding affinity for p53 as shown
in Figure 3B and described above.

The finding that the ∆N1 allele is only partially competent
to inhibit p53 is consistent with our previous observation
that deletion of the N-terminus of IκBα reduced its physical affinity for p53 (Figure 3). While the ∆N1 allele is a
super-repressor of NF-κB, the ∆A5 allele does not repress
NF-κB, and thus this allele could be used to ask whether
p53 repression and NF-κB inhibition are separable characteristics of the IκBα molecule. Remarkably, ∆A5, which
cannot repress NF-κB transcription, had very pronounced
inhibitory effects upon transcription by p53 (Figure 5A),
comparable to that of wild-type.
Mapping of interactions between IκBα and p53 in vivo to
the ankyrin 3 domain of IκBα
Ankyrin regions in IκBα, shared with other members of
the IκB gene family are the sites of binding to NF-κB transcription factor family members. Further experiments
were performed to define the effects of deletion of additional ankyrin domains of IκBα upon p53 transcription in
Akata cells. In these experiments, shown in Figure 5, IκBα
plasmids were transfected at 800 ng (at a ratio of 4:1 relative to p53 plasmid). Deletion of either the second (∆A2,
amino acids 110–136, not shown) or fourth ankyrin
domains (∆A4, amino acids 182–208) had the most
potent inhibitory effects upon p53 transcription. Deletion
of amino acids 264–317 in the carboxyl terminus (∆C1),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/6/12

distal to the 6th ankyrin domian, were similarly inhibitory.
This region retains the 6th ankyrin domain but deletes a
potentially regulatory acidic PEST region. Deletion of the
ankyrin 1 domain of IκBα was not evaluated in this work.
In multiple experiments with wild-type p53, deletion of
the ankyrin 3 (∆A3) domain of IκBα (missing amino acids
143–169) resulted in a loss of inhibitory activity towards
p53 transcription. Thus ∆A3 acts as a null allele for both
p53 and NF-κB transcription in vivo, while other ankyrin
deletion alleles of IκBα (∆A2, ∆A4, ∆A5) act as null alleles
for NF-κB but gain of function with respect to p53. Thus,
our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the
ankyrin 3 and N-terminus of IκBα are cooperatively or
independently involved in repressing p53. We cannot,
however, rule out an alternative possibility, that the deletion of the ankyrin 3 (∆A3) of IκBα resulted in a protein
with high turnover in Akata cells.
Relative effects of alleles of IκBα are conserved with
constitutively active p53 and require transcriptionally
active p53
P53 transcription is regulated in part by phosphorylation
of the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Phosphorylation
induces a conformational change in p53 so that an autoinhibitory region of the carboxyl terminus no longer
inhibits DNA binding [73-75]. To determine whether the
effects of IκBα upon p53 transcription required the autoinhibitory carboxyl terminus of p53, experiments were
repeated with a truncated form of p53 containing the first
353 amino acids (Figure 5A, ∆C-p53) together with an 8fold excess of IκBα plasmid (1600 ng). As expected, these
experiments demonstrated increased p53 transcriptional
activity measured as p53 -dependent transcription of
pG(13)PY/Luc in Akata cells at the same plasmid concentrations compared to experiments using wild-type p53.
Co-transfection of a fixed concentration of a plasmid
expressing ∆C-p53 protein (200 ng), and IκBα alleles
(1600 ng) demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus of
p53 was not required for the association between p53dependent transcription and IκBα expression. As in
experiments with wild-type p53, deletion of the ankyrin 4
(∆A4) domain of IκBα was associated with greater
decreases in p53-dependent transcription than other alleles of IκBα. A transcriptionally inactive p53 mutated in
the p53 DNA binding core (pC53-CSX3, V193A) gave very
low levels of luciferase activity that were not altered by cotransfection of any IκBα alleles (data not shown). Thus,
the effects of IκBα upon p53 transcription in Akata cells
were found to be entirely dependent upon the presence of
co-transfected transcriptionally active p53 but independent of the carboxyl-terminus regulatory sequences of p53.

correspond to allele specific modulation of transcription in
vivo
Some alleles of IκBα including ∆A3 and ∆A4 were not stable in COS cells (unpublished observations). Therefore,
COS cells could not be used to determine the correlation
between IκBα and p53 binding in vitro (Figure 2B) and
transcriptional effects in Akata cells (Figure 5). Thus, to
overcome this technical problem, p53 and IκBα proteins
were both separately synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte
lysate system (Figure 6). IκBα synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate system is functionally active in its effects upon
NF-κB transcription factors and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Likewise, but in contrast to bacterially synthesized p53, p53 synthesized in RRL system is functionally
active as a site-specific DNA-binding protein and like IκBα
is degraded in vitro by a ubiquitin-dependent pathway.
Experiments were performed to determine whether RRL
produced p53 that could interact with IκBα alleles likewise translated in vitro in RRL.

Coupled transcription/translation of a plasmid encoding
wild-type p53 in RRL (lane 1, Figure 6B) resulted in several template-specific products that could be precipitated
from lysates with p53-specific monoclonal antibodies
(lanes 2 and 3, Figure 6B). These products appeared to be
a mixture of full length and less-than full-length p53 proteins resulting from internal initiation sites in the p53
template. Negative control precipitation with IgG2A
immunoglobulin (lane 4) or protein G/A beads (lane 5)
resulted in undetectable levels of p53 recovery.
IκBα was precipitated with a polyclonal antiserum
directed at the IκBα C-terminus in the absence (p53-) or
presence of p53 (p53+) protein after both proteins were
synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate system (Figure 6A).
Deletion of the carboxyl terminus of IκBα did not interfere with binding between GST-p53 and IκBα synthesized
in COS cells (Figure 2), suggesting that binding of antibody directed at the IκBα carboxyl terminus would not
interfere with binding between p53 and IκBα. Visual
inspection and gel densitometry of these co-precipitation
experiments confirmed a specific association between
wild-type IκBα and p53. The association of ∆A3 IκBα
allele to p53 was significantly reduced (Figure 6A, p53+,
lane 3) as determined by gel densitometry (Figure 6D, p <
0.05) relative to the association between the wild-type
IκBα, ∆A4, and ∆A5 alleles of IκBα to p53. Gel densitometry was not sensitive enough to determine whether small
differences in the binding of other IκBα alleles to p53
were significant. In the absence of labeled IκBα, bands
corresponding to p53 were still evident (5A, lane 1, p53+)
suggesting either non-specific binding or co-precipitation
with endogenous unlabeled IκBα. There are small quantities of immuno-detectable IκBα in certain preparations of
RRL (L. Ghoda, unpublished observations). Similar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/6/12

results were obtained in experiments in which an antibody against p53 (Ab2) were used to co-precipitate p53
and IκBα alleles (unpublished observations). Binding was
also evident between IκBα and p53-related proteins
smaller in size than full-length p53 although these interactions could not be reliably quantitated due to variable
co-migrating protein species in the relevant portions of
the gel.
In vivo binding of ∆A5-IκBα to wild-type p53
The melanoma cell line A2085 expressing endogenous
wild-type p53 was stably transfected with the hemagluttinin (HA)-tagged ∆A5 allele of IκBα [76]. The ∆A5 allele
was chosen because it has no effect on NF-κB activity but
is one of the more potent alleles of IκBα in modulating
p53-dependent transcription. Several independent stable
clones as well as pooled transfectants were expanded and
used for experiments for which results of the pooled transfectants (DA5) are shown here (Figure 7). Results were
qualitatively similar with pooled vs cells expanded from
single colonies. Pooled transformants resulting from antibiotic selection of vector transfected cells were used as
controls (Con). Association of ∆A5-IκBα with p53 was
evident when UV-irradiated cell extracts were immunoprecipated using anti-p53 antibody and the immunoprecipitates probed with anti-IκBα antibody (top panel).
Likewise, association between transfected IκBα and p53
are evident when immunoprecipitates generated using
anti-HA were probed with anti-p53 (bottom row). Immunoprecipitation with normal rabbit serum (ns) precipitated little or no IκBα or p53. Association between
endogenous wild-type IκBα and p53 are also evident as
seen by the upper band detectable with anti-IκBα western
blotting in Con and DA5 lanes when extracts are
precipitated with anti-p53. When extracts of irradiated
cells are immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, and immunoblotted with anti-IκBα, Both endogenous and ∆A5 are evident. This is likely due to the precipitation of wt- IκBα
with the p53/ ∆A5-IκBα complex since p53 exists as a
tetramer.

Discussion
In this work we determined that IκBα and p53 bind in
vitro through a specific interaction in part involving the
DNA binding region of p53, or a region proximal to it,
and the amino terminus of IκBα independently or cooperatively with the ankyrin 3 domain of IκBα. A physical
interaction between p53 and IκBα has been noted by two
other groups [68,69]. Generally, our data corroborate
these previously reported interactions and provide further
evidence for direct transcriptional modulation of p53 by
IκBα. There are some notable differences in our observations from that of others, in particular, the binding site on
IκBα was reported as existing in the non-ankyrin C-terminus by Chang [68] in an yeast two-hybrid system using a

Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) produced p53 and IκBα proteins interact in vitro. A. Wild-type IκBα and mutant proteins were
synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (lane 1, RRL no RNA; lane 2, ∆A2; lane 3, ∆A3; lane 4, ∆A4; lane 5, ∆A5; and lane 6,
wild-type) and precipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the C-terminus of IκBα using protein A/G sephadex
beads either in the absence (p53-) or in the presence (p53+) of RRL synthesized, [35S]-labeled, p53. Equal volumes of RRL were
used in all cases. For p53- reactions, RRL programmed with empty vector was incubated with [35S]-labeled methionine. A control reticulocyte lysate without IκBα protein template (lane 1) was included in these experiments. ∆A2 (lane 2), ∆A3 (lane 3),
∆A4 (lane 4) ∆A5 (lane 5) and wild-type (lane 6) IκBα proteins were co-incubated with p53, precipitated and analzyed by SDSPAGE followed by radiography. B. Wild-type p53 protein translated in RRL (lane 1) produced both putative full-length p53 protein (denoted p53, mobility approximately 55 kD) and also at least two less-than-full length translation products (denoted * and
**; lanes 1–3). Putative full-length and less-than full-length p53 translation products were precipitated by p53-specific monoclonal antibodies and protein A/G sephadex beads (lane 2, Ab1 recognizing the carboxyl terminus of p53; lane 3, Ab2 recognizing the amino terminus of p53). Less-than full-length proteins were more readily precipitated by Ab1 than Ab2. Control
precipitation with IgG2A immunoglobulin (lane 4) or protein G/A beads (lane 5) did not precipitate p53. C. IκBα proteins were
precipitated in similar quantities by IκBα antiserum. A shorter exposure of the gel than in panel A is shown. D. Densitometry

retained in our construct but deleted in Chang's, may in
fact contain another p53 contact point, the loss of which
were observed by Chang but not by us.
We also found that deletion of the ankyrin 2, 4, or 5
domains of IκBα increased the inhibitory effect of IκBα
on p53-dependent transcription in Akata cells. We speculate that the compacting of the structure by elimination of
an ankyrin domain may promote better binding of the
protein to p53 as it may convert IκBα to a structure closer
in size to that of 53BP2 which only contains four
ankyrins. Mutations in the ankyrin regions of IκBα have
been characterized regarding their effects upon NF-κBmediated transcription as well as nuclear translocation,
with most deletions of ankyrins including deletion of
ankyrin 5 leading to a null phenotype (confirmed in part
in this work in Akata cells) with respect to NF-κB transcription. Nevertheless, over-expression of ∆A5-IκBα was
more effective than wild-type at decreasing p53 transcrip-

tion at all but the lowest concentrations examined. Thus,
it was evident that over-expression of some alleles of IκBα
could influence p53 transcription independently of their
effects upon transcription by NF-κB. Deletion of the
ankyrin 3 region of IκBα eliminated detectable interactions between IκBα and p53 in vivo and in vitro suggesting
a critical role of the ankyrin 3 region in a specific in vivo
interaction with p53. The combined results obtained
using bacterially produced IκBα and p53 (Figure 2) as
well as RRL produced proteins (Figure 6) suggest a correlation between in vitro co-precipitation in at least one of
the systems and in vivo p53 inhibitory activity. These
observations argue for a mechanism involving direct
binding of IκBα to p53 in the inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity.
Our interpretation of these observations is that binding
between IκBα and p53 occurs primarily between the p53
DNA-binding core or a region proximal to it, and the

ankyrin 3 and N-terminal regions of IκBα. Binding results
in decreased p53-dependent transcription when both
IκBα and p53 are overexpressed in vivo. These results are
consistent with those published by Zhou, et al. [69] where
induction of p53 regulatable genes such as p21 and
Mdm2 in response to doxorubicin was abrogated by
expression of a degradation-resistant form of IκBα. These
interactions are strikingly similar to the known interactions between IκBα and its physiologic ligand, NF-κB. We
suggest that these interactions are a result of a conserved
relationship, i.e., that of a common descent, of p65 and
p53 from a primordial transcription factor which we term
proto p53/NF-κB (Figure 8B). Not only do the two transcription factors bind ankyrin proteins but both NF-κB
and p53 have similar DNA binding sites (Figure 8A). Furthermore, both factors bind a viral protein encoded by the
EBV BZLF-1 open reading frame (also known as ZEBRA)
and can transcription can be modulated by this viral protein when overexpressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines
[64,77]. As shown in Figure 8C, we found that a cryptic
ankyrin like region is present in the dimerization region of
BZLF-1, coincident with the region required for binding to
both p65 and p53. With the exception of ankyrin
domains, BZLF-1 and IκBα are otherwise not similar in
sequence, structure, or function.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/6/12

and IκBα are members of multi-gene families, and both
protein families regulate apoptosis. Previously, a cooperative relationship between p53-dependent apoptosis and
NF-κB activation had been reported [59]. Our observations may represent the converse of this situation where
inactivation of NF-κB (i.e. as a result of elevated IκBα levels) results in inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity.
Alternatively, a situation where accumulation of IκBα free
of NF-κB, as a result of phosphorylation of p65 by RSK1
and ensuing dissociation of NF-κB from IκBα, could result
in the regulation of p53 by IκBα [78]. Another setting
where our observations may play a significant physiological role is during herpesvirus infection. The Epstein-Barr
nuclear antigen (EBNA1) contains a region enriched in
gly-ala repeats, and this repeat sequence inhibits the 26S
proteasome leading to inhibition of peptide presentation
by the MHC Class I restricted pathway [79]. EBNA1 is
expressed during viral latency, a condition where it is beneficial for the virus to inhibit apoptosis. Proteasome inhibition will lead to inhibition of all cellular protein
degradation and the impact would be the greatest on
those proteins with extremely short half-lives such as p53
and IκBα. Thus, the accumulation of IκBα under these circumstances may down regulate the activity of p53.

Thus, ankyrin repeat domains appear to be key points of
interaction between diverse proteins in the NF-κB and
p53 superfamilies. A similar conclusion is suggested by
the crystal structure of a complex between p53 and 53BP2
[28]. 53BP2 is a 1002 amino acid protein containing four
ankyrin repeats that has been found to be a fragment of an
even larger protein known as ASPP2. Residues TYSD
located in the 4th ankyrin repeat of 53BP2/ASPP2 (Figure
2E, 133 TYsd) binds to the L2 loop of p53 immediately
after the zinc ligand site in p53, while the non-ankyrin,
SH3 domain of 53BP2 also contribute to the binding
interactions. These four residues in 53BP2/ASPP2 are
exactly aligned with an equivalent block in the sixth
ankyrin repeat of IκBα (Figure 2E, 181 TYqq). It is interesting to note that this corresponds to the 6th ankyrin
domain predicted to be a contact point for p53 as outlined above. Paradoxically, 53BP2/ASPP2 is exclusively
cytoplasmic thus it may only inhibit and sequester p53 in
the cytoplasm. IκBα thus may fall into a paradigm of
endogenous and viral p53 regulatory proteins where
ankyrin and non-ankyrin domains contribute to p53
binding and transcriptional modulation. Other ankyrin
proteins that bind to either NF-κB or p53 could also bind
and potentially modulate each other.

Decreased p53-dependent transcription could limit the
ability of p53 to trigger cellular apoptosis in the presence
of inflammation since levels of targets of NF-κB, including
IκBα, are up-regulated. If, in fact, IκBα inhibits or
dampens p53 function, cells could continue to proliferate
and differentiate in the presence of an inflammatory event
even if there is DNA damage or other cellular injury that
would normally activate p53-dependent cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis. Thus, a combination of inflammation and
cellular damage could increase malignant transformation
of cells since the threshold for p53 levels to trigger apoptosis may be elevated. It is notable that we know little
about what thresholds regulate p53 function – in particular, what determines whether a cell repairs DNA and
resumes transit through the cell cycle or dies. A molecule
such as IκBα may be involved in influencing thresholddependent cell fate decisions. The observation that
truncated p53 proteins may bind to IκBα raises the possibility that short p53-related peptides could alter the binding between IκBα and p53, in turn altering a putative
regulatory relationship between these proteins in vivo.
Modulation of this regulatory interaction by pharmacologic or other means could potentially alter the balance
between cellular proliferation and cell cycle arrest/apoptosis in the context of inflammation.

Conclusion

Methods

In conclusion, modulation of p53 transcription by IκBα
and related host and viral proteins could play a role in the
regulation of p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo. Both p53

laevis p90rsk (a gift of Dr. James Maller, Howard Hughes
Memorial Institute and UCHSC, Denver CO) [80] and
detected with polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific to the
N- or C-terminus of IκBα as described (a gift of Dr. Warner
Greene, the Gladstone Institute for Virology & Immunology, UCSF, San Francisco, CA) GST-p53 produced from a
pGEX construct in bacteris was incubated with
hexahistidine-tagged IκBα purified as described in [44] in
IP buffer buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 75 mM
KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.15% NP-40, and 1
mM DTT. Protein complexes were purified using either
glutathione conjugated Sepharose beads to bind GST
(Pharmacia) for GST-p53 or Protein A/G conjugated
Sephadex beads (Oncogene Science, CA). Proteins were
separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
on either 10% or 12% gels which were dried and autoradiographed on photographic film (Fuji) for detection of
radiolabeled protein or transferred to supported nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane and probed with antibodies
using the Renaissance system for western blotting (NEN,
Boston, MA). p53 specific monoclonal antibodies Ab1,
Ab2, Ab3, Ab5, and Ab6 were obtained from Oncogene
Science [81].
Expression of IκBα alleles in cells
COS cells and Akata cells were transiently transfected
using Superfectin (Qiagen, Chatworth, CA) with expression vectors for IκBα alleles in an expression plasmid regulated by a CMV promoter (pCMV5) obtained from Dr.
S.C. Sun (Penn State, Hershey, PA). COS cells were lysed
in IP buffer (see above) and incubated with p53-pGEX.
Overexpression and coprecipitation of IκBα proteins in
COS cells was complicated by the apparent instability of
some IκBα alleles (∆A3, ∆A4) these cells and lack of an
association between other alleles (∆A5) and p53-pGEX
(unpublished observations). Following PAGE, ∆N1 IκBα
protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antisera
directed at the C-terminus of IκBα, while ∆C1 IκBα protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antisera
directed at the N-terminus of IκBα in these experiments
(antibodies to N- and C-termini of IκBα were a gift of Dr.
W.C. Greene, the Gladstone Institute for Virology and
Immunology and the University of California, San Francisco, CA).
Transient transfection of Akata cells
Akata cells were obtained from Dr. J. F. Jones (National
Jewish Medical Research Center, Denver, CO). The identity of Akata cells was confirmed by expression of EBV lytic
gene products following ligation of surface IgG (data not
shown). Cells were cultured using standard conditions in
RPMI medium (GIBCO-BRL) supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml) and
L-glutamine (2 mM). As previously reported, endogenous
p53 protein was not detected in Akata cells by Western

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/6/12

blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antisera directed at the
entire p53 coding sequence (Santa Cruz Biologicals, Santa
Cruz, CA) [21,81].
Akata cells were transiently transfected with plasmids
using dextran sulfate (Pharmacia). p53 protein transiently
expressed by plasmids transfected into Akata cells could
be detected in nuclear extracts of transfected cells (data
not shown). Levels of transfected wild-type IκBα protein
were not detected by Western blotting above a high background of endogenous IκBα proteins in Akata cells,
although expression of IκBα protein could be inferred by
effects on transcription of NF-κB reporter genes. Akata
were grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and 1 ml of
cells for each experiment were transfected with Dextran.
After transfection, cells were incubated in fresh culture
medium for 24 hours prior to determination of luciferase
activity.
Luciferase assay
A luciferase reporter gene regulated by 13 tandem copies
of a p53 response element, denoted pG(13)PyLuc, or p21
promoter reporter, denoted WWP/Luc, were transfected
into Akata cells in experiments at concentrations indicated. As noted in the text the relative effects of different
alleles of IκBα upon p53 dependent luciferase expression
varied with the relative ratios of expression vector for IκBα
to expression vector for p53. CMV-promoter driven p53
expression plasmids encoding wild-type p53 (pC53-SN3)
and a DNA binding mutated p53 (pC53-CSX3 V193A)
were obtained from Dr. B. Vogelstein, (Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, MD). An expression plasmid
encoding a carboxyl-terminus deleted p53 (pCEP4-353)
was obtained from Dr. J. Pietenpol, Vanderbilt Univ.,
Memphis, TN). Plasmids were prepared using either the
Promega (Madison, WI) or Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) procedures with similar results.

A plasmid encoding a second form of luciferase (Renilla
luciferase) driven by an SV40 promoter was used as an
internal control for transfection efficiency and cell viability (pRL-SV40, Promega, Madison WI). Similar results
were obtained without pRL transfection by normalization
of luciferase activity to total cellular protein. Luciferase
activity was measured using the Stop and Glo assay
(Promega) and an Analytical Luminescence Laboratory
luminometer (San Diego, CA). Each data point shown
from luciferase assay experiments represents pooled data
from at least three independent experiments. Standard
error and significant differences (p < 0.05, indicated with
an asterick, *) were as determined by the students t-test for
multiple comparisons of data points using statistical software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

Reticulocyte lysate expression and immunoprecipitation
For reticulocyte lysate expression and immunoprecipitation studies, IκBα expression vectors were digested with
XbaI/HindIII and ligated into the XbaI/HindIII site of pBS
KS(Stratagene) to place the open reading frames downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter element. These
IκBα constructs lack epitope tags. Vectors encoding p53
wild-type (SN3) and DNA binding mutant p53 protein
(pBKS-273) for reticulocyte lysate expression were
obtained from Dr. B. Vogelstein. 35S-Cysteine/methionine
labelled IκBα and p53 proteins were produced in the TNT
coupled transcription/translation system (Promega)
using T7 RNA polymerase for wild-type p53 and IκBα and
T3 for mutant p53. 10 µl of reticulocyte lysates, as indicated, were incubated in a total volume of 100 µl IP buffer
for 2 hours at 4°C. Antibodies were added and incubated
for an additional 1 hour, and proteins were precipitated
with Protein G plus/A Sephadex (Oncogene Science).
Beads were washed once with 500 µl IP buffer and proteins denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and separated
on 10 or 12% PAGE gels dried and visualized by autoradiography. Despite possibly confounding variables due to
the presence of the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB and possibly other related factors in reticulocyte lysates (unpublished observations), a correlation was evident between
the quantity of p53 coprecipitated with IκBα and the relative effect of individual alleles upon in vivo p53 transcription in Akata cells. In particular, there was a lack of a
detectable interaction between the ankyrin 3 deletion
mutant of IκBα and p53 in vivo or in vitro.
