Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global public health problem in both
developed and developing countries. The prevalence and genetic diversity of HCV in pregnant
women in Gabon, central Africa, is not known. We therefore evaluated the prevalence and the
circulating genotypes of HCV in a large population cohort of pregnant women.
Methods: Blood samples (947) were collected from pregnant women in the five main cities of the
country. The prevalence was evaluated by two ELISA tests, and the circulating genotypes were
characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.
Results: Twenty pregnant women (2.1%) were infected with HCV. The seroprevalence differed
significantly by region (p = 0.004) and increased significantly with age (p = 0.05), being 1.3% at 14–
20 years, 1.1% at 21–25 years, 1.9% at 26–30 years, 4.1% at 31–35 years and 6.0% at > 35 years.
Sequencing in the 5'-UTR and NS5B regions showed that the circulating strains belonged to
genotypes 4 (4e and 4c).
Conclusion: We found that the HCV seroprevalence in pregnant women in Gabon is almost as
high as that in other African countries and increases with age. Furthermore, only genotype 4 (4e
and 4c) was found. More extensive studies aiming to evaluate the prevalence and heterogeneity of
HCV genotypes circulating in the general population of the country are needed.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global public
health problem in both developed and developing countries. More than 170 million people are chronically

infected with HCV worldwide, and the infection results in
the development of chronic liver diseases, including liver
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV has been
clustered into six distinct genotypes and numerous subPage 1 of 7

types on the basis of nucleic acid sequence [1]. Genotyping of HCV strains is an important tool for
epidemiological and clinical purposes; in particular,
examination of sequence diversity can aid understanding
of different patterns of serological reactivity, virulence and
response to treatment [2,3].
Genotypes 1, 2 and 3 are distributed widely throughout
western countries, whereas types 5 and 6 are largely confined to South Africa and southeast Asia, respectively, and
type 4 was first found predominantly in the Middle East
[4] and then in central Africa [5-7]. Data on HCV prevalence and molecular epidemiology are available for only a
few African countries. In Gabon, central Africa, the seroprevalence was previously reported to be up to 6.5% in
the general population of the eastern part of the country
[8], and genotype 4 was found by screening a few
sequences [7]. These data are based on small groups of
individuals and third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), molecular (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)) assays
having rarely been used. Furthermore, no data are available on the presence of circulating HCV or the genotypes in
pregnant women in Gabon. A serological and molecular
study was therefore undertaken on a large population
cohort of pregnant women in the five main cities of the
country.

Methods
Area and study population
Gabon occupies 270 000 km2 in the Gulf of Guinea near
the equator, with tropical forest covering three-quarters of
the territory. The population was estimated in 2003 to be
1 273 000 persons, belonging to more than 40 ethnic
groups.

To determine the prevalence and the circulating genotypes
of HCV in pregnant women in Gabon, five sentinel sites
were selected: Libreville, the capital, in the north-west;
Port-Gentil, the port and economic capital in the west;
Lambaréné, in the centre of the country; Franceville in the
south-east; and Oyem in the north-east (Figure 1).
Between January and March 2005, blood samples were
collected from all pregnant women at their first antenatal
examination, after full informed consent had been
obtained. The samples were anonymous, but age and geographic origin were retained. The study obtained ethical
clearance from the public health authorities (Ministry of
Public Health and the "Programme National de Lutte contre le Sida" in Gabon).
Serological tests
All samples were screened for anti-HCV antibodies with a
commercial third-generation ELISA (Monolisa, anti-HCV
Plus version 2, Bio-Rad, Marne-La-Coquette, France). The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/82

results of the assay were expressed quantitatively as the
ratio of the optical density of the test sample to the calculated cut-off absorbance, as recommended by the manufacturer. Sera with ratios > 1.1 were considered to be
positive, sera with R values of 0.9–1.1 were recorded as
indeterminate, whereas those with R values < 0.9 were
considered negative. Positive and indeterminate sera were
re-tested with another third-generation ELISA assay,
Innotest HCV Ab IV (Innogenetics NV HCV, Gand, Belgium). Samples were considered HCV positive when they
were positive in the two ELISA tests.
HCV amplification and molecular and phylogenetic
analysis
Viral RNA was extracted from 140 μl of plasma with a
Qiamp® viral mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). The extracted RNA
was used as a template and amplified by nested RT-PCR
with primers specific to the 5'UTR (5' non-coding region),
as described previously [9,10]. Reverse transcription and
first amplifications were performed with a Titan One Tube
RT-PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany),
according to the manufacturer's protocol. A portion of the
NS5B region was also amplified with degenerated primers, as described previously [11], and then sequenced
according to standard procedures. The HCV sequences
and phylogenetic results were studied as reported previously [11]. The GenBank accession numbers of the new
NS5b sequences are EU0334530 to EU0334534, and
those of the 5'UTR sequences are to EU0334545.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by the chi-squared test
with Yates' correction, and the prevalences and odds ratios
were calculated. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals were reported as measures of statistical significance.
Analyses were performed with Epi-Info (version 6.04dfr,
ENSP-Epiconcept-InUS, 2001).

Results
HCV prevalence in pregnant women
Between January and March 2005, sera from all 947 pregnant women recruited at the five sentinel sites were
screened for HCV antibodies with the two ELISA tests; 20
pregnant women (2.1%) were found to be seropositives
for HCV (Table 1). The seroprevalence differed significantly by region (p = 0.004), with the highest prevalence
(4.9%) in Franceville (Haut Ogooué region in the southeast) and no cases in Port Gentil. There was a significant
increase in HCV seroprevalence with age (p = 0.05), being
1.3% at 14–20 years, 1.1% at 21–25 years, 1.9% at 26–30
years, 4.1% at 31–35 years and 6.0% at > 35 years (Table
1).

HCV RNA detection and molecular analysis of circulating
genotypes
HCV RNA targeting 5'-UTR was found in 13 of the 20 positive samples, showing that 1.3% of the pregnant women
were viraemic. Sequencing in the 5'-UTR region was successful for 11 RNA-positive isolates (Table 2). BLAST
searches of the 5'-UTR sequences classified the 11 strains
as genotype 4. Of these, nine belonged to genotype 4e,
with 99–100% homology with the reference sequences

GAB809 (L29625) and CAM73 (L29591) from Gabon
and Cameroon, respectively [12]. The other two
sequences belonged to genotype 4c, with 98% homology
with the reference sequences Z6 (M84862) and GB358
(L29608) from Zaire and Gabon, respectively [13] (Table
2).
To confirm the circulating genotypes obtained with 5'UTR sequences and for phylogenetic analysis, the NS5B

regions of three strains were amplified and sequenced. We
also amplified and sequenced two new positive samples
obtained from routinely screened pregnant women in the
region with the highest HCV prevalence (Franceville).
These two samples were also included in the phylogenetic
analysis. Sequence analysis of the NS5B region confirmed
that the strains from pregnant women were closely related
to genotypes 4e and 4c, with 94.5% and 93.7% homology
with other strains from Gabon, as described previously
[12]. Phylogenetic analysis of the NS5B region confirmed
the sequence homology analysis, showing that the strains
from pregnant women in Gabon belonged to genotypes
4c and 4e (Figure 2). Within genotype 4e, our strains clustered with strains from Cameroon and with other strains
from Gabon described previously [12]. In genotype 4c,
the strains from Gabon were closely related to other
strains identified previously by Stuyver et al. (1994).

Discussion
We found an overall seroprevalence of HCV in pregnant
women in Gabon of 2.1%, which is similar to that in
other African countries, such as Cameroon (1.9%) [14]
and Burkina Faso (2%) [15]. The prevalence in our study
was lower than that described previously in the general
population of eastern Gabon (6.5%) [8]. This difference
could be related to age, as we observed an increasing prevalence with age and low prevalences in the youngest age
groups (Table 1). Similar observations have been made in
previous studies in several African countries, including
Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in
both pregnant women and the general population
[14,16]. Although studies to evaluate the routes of HCV
transmission in Africa are needed [17], ritual procedures,
such as scarification and tattooing, which are common
tribal customs in various areas of Gabon, may facilitate
transmission [18]. Furthermore, in rural health centres in
Gabon, drugs such as antibiotics are commonly given by
intramuscular injection, and the sterilization procedures
are often inadequate, increasing the risk for HCV transmission. People are therefore exposed to new infection
throughout their lives. This might explain in part the
increasing prevalence of HCV with age.
We also showed that HCV seroprevalence differed significantly by region. Many factors can influence the transmission of HCV in Africa, including environmental, ethnic,
ritual (see above), economic and genetic factors. In Egypt,
it was reported that transmission of HCV was related to
extensive antischistosomiasis injection campaigns [19]. It
is not known whether previous vaccination campaigns in
Gabon had the same effects in various areas of the country. Further epidemiological, molecular and genetic studies are required to determine the factors responsible for
the high prevalence of HCV in some regions of Gabon.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/82

Of the 20 seropositive women, seven were ELISA-positive
but RNA-negative. These seven samples also had a low
ratio in the two ELISA tests. It has been reported previously that during the natural history of HCV infection,
20–30% of infected individuals eliminate the virus spontaneously [20,21]. Results similar to ours were obtained
in studies conducted in Cameroon and Japan [14,22]. The
presence of HCV antibodies in the pregnant women in
our study might have been due to a previous infection.
We also showed that the HCV circulating in pregnant
women in Gabon belongs to genotype 4 (4e and 4c). In a
previous study, Xu et al. [7] published three sequences of
HCV selected from 1172 persons in the general population of Gabon. Sequence comparisons showed that these
three sequences were closely related to genotype 4, and
the authors suggested that they might be related to genotype 4c or to 4d as described by Buck et al. [13]. In our
study, the sequences of 11 samples were also found to be
closely related to genotypes 4c and 4e. These two studies
thus confirm that genotype 4 is the only genotype circulating in Gabon.
In our study, we also found that 4e predominates in five
widely separated geographical regions of the country. SubSaharan Africa is known to have a wide diversity of genotypes 1, 2, and 4 and a remarkable diversity of subtypes
[6,11,23]; genotypes 4 and 5 predominate in several African countries [24-26], and genotype 4f has been described
in Cameroon. We found only genotypes 4e and 4c in pregnant women in Gabon. Indeed, the plasma samples used
in the present study, obtained after screening for HIV,
HTLV, HBV/HDV and HEV, were insufficient to perform
more sequence analyses. However, the two strains
obtained from further routinely screened pregnant
women in the region of the highest HCV prevalence
(Franceville) confirm, however, that the circulating strains
in this population belong to genotype 4 (4c and 4e). A
larger study in the general population is needed to better
characterize the circulating genotypes.

Conclusion
Our study represents the first serological and molecular
epidemiological investigation on HCV in a homogeneous
population in Gabon. We showed that the HCV seroprevalence in pregnant women in Gabon is almost as high as
that in other African countries and increases with age.
Thus, preventive measures to decrease the spread and
transmission of HCV in Gabon are warranted. These
measures should include systematic HCV screening of
pregnant women, in order to counsel them about the risk
for HCV transmission and the development of associated
diseases.

Only genotype 4 (4e and 4c) was found in these pregnant
women. More extensive studies aiming to evaluate the
heterogeneity of HCV genotypes in samples collected
from the general population of the country are needed.
