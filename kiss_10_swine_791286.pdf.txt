Abstract
Swine influenza virus isolates originating from outbreaks in Sweden from 1983, 2002 and 2009 were subjected to
nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The aim of the studies was to obtain an overview on their
potential relatedness as well as to provide data for broader scale studies on swine influenza epidemiology. Nonetheless, analyzing archive isolates is justified by the efforts directed to the comprehension of the appearance of
pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Interestingly, this study illustrates the evolution of swine influenza viruses in Europe, because the earliest isolate belonged to ‘classical’ swine H1N1, the subsequent ones to Eurasian ‘avian-like’
swine H1N1 and reassortant ‘avian-like’ swine H1N2 lineages, respectively. The latter two showed close genetic
relatedness regarding their PB2, HA, NP, and NS genes, suggesting common ancestry. The study substantiates the
importance of molecular surveillance for swine influenza viruses.
Findings
The records of the swine influenza history in Europe start
with H1N1 viruses dating back to 1938, when an H1N1
strain of early human influenza virus gene pool was isolated from pigs in Great Britain [1]. In 1950, classical
swine influenza viruses (SIVs) were isolated in Czechoslovakia but after that no swine influenza virus detection
was reported for more than two decades [1,2]. Between
the mid 1970 s and mid 1980 s, human origin H3N2
influenza viruses and classical SIVs circulated simultaneously. In 1979, an H1N1 influenza virus of avian origin
was first detected in pigs, in Belgium, which gradually
replaced the classical viruses and became dominant in
Europe [3,4]. Reassortment events between human origin
H3N2 and avian-like H1N1 SIVs resulted in the emergence of H3N2 viruses possessing surface glycoprotein
genes of human and internal genes of avian origin. These
viruses eventually superseded the former H3N2 viruses
of human origin around 1983-84 [5,6], but their current
presence show great variation across Europe [1]. As a
results of further reassortment events several kinds of
H1N2 subtype SIVs arose: the first case was reported in
France in 1987 [7]. This virus comprised HA of avian
and NA of human origin, which had not become widespread among the European pig population. In 1994, a

further reassortant variant was identified in the UK, comprising haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
genes of human origin and internal genes of avian origin
(’human-like’ reassortant SIV H1N2 viruses)[8]. The different H1N2 viruses have reassorted with each other as
well as with avian-like H1N1 viruses resulting in difficulties to characterize and classify them [1]. Recently, novel
reassortant H1N2 SIVs were isolated in Germany and in
Italy, having a mixture of the characteristics of porcine
H1N2 and H3N2 viruses [1,9]. In 2006, a further type of
reassortant was isolated in Italy, belonging to H3N1 subtype SIVs, which plausibly arose by the exchange of
genetic material between H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs [10].
The occurrence and prevalence of SIVs vary among the
different regions in Europe but the avian origin H1N1
appears to be the most predominant subtype, followed by
reassortant H3N2 and to a lower extent by the H1N2
subtypes, which comprise viruses of diverse genetic constellation [1,11].
Our goal was to investigate the genetic composition of
the available archive and recent Swedish SIV isolates in
order to establish their relation to the existing lineages
and to find out if they were genetically or epidemiologically related to each other, and further, to provide data
for broader scale studies on swine influenza virus ecology and evolution. The viruses were collected in 1983,
2002 and 2009, from swine influenza outbreaks in
Sweden [12,13]. Prior to the 1983 outbreak there was no

evidence of the presence of swine influenza in Sweden
[12]. The isolates were subjected to PCR and nucleotide
sequencing to obtain representative portions of the viral
genome by using the method described and applied earlier [13,14]. The genetic material of A/swine/Lidköping/
1193/02(H1N1) virus was amplified directly from nasal
swabs collected and stored from a pig herd showing
respiratory clinical signs, which subsequently was diagnosed as swine influenza. The obtained samples were
processed as mentioned above. For the phylogenetic
analyses closely related nucleotide sequences were collected based on the BLAST search, while additional
sequences, considering the literature, were obtained
from the Influenza Virus Resource platform of NCBI
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html.
The genes were assigned to lineages according to the
Influenza A Virus Genotype Tool [15] and in the case
of HA and NA also in accordance with Liu et al. [16],
who proposed a comprehensive nomenclature system
for influenza A viruses based on the panorama phylogeny of approximately 23 000 sequences related to the
surface glycoproteins. Sequence assembly, multiple
alignment and alignment trimming were performed with
the CLC Main Workbench 5.5 (CLC bio A/S, Aarhus,
Denmark). Distance based neighbor-joining and character based maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees were
generated using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis (MEGA) software v.4.0. [17]. The topology of
the trees was confirmed with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
For the neighbor-joining trees, the Kimura 2-parameter
method was used [18]. Other models tested showed
similar results. The nucleotide sequences obtained by
this study were deposited in the GenBank (accession
numbers GU236506-GU236521).
The isolates were genotyped as follows: A/swine/
Skåne/1321/1983(H1N1) [B, A, C, 1A, A, 1B,A, 1A], A/
swine/Lidköping/1193/02(H1N1) [F, G, I, 1C, F, 1F, F,
1E], and A/swine/Sweden/1021/09(H1N2) [F, G, I, 1C,
F, 2A, F, 1E], indicating that the two more recent isolates showed more nucleotide homology with each other
than with the one from 1983. Abusugra et al. [12,19]
found that isolate A/swine/Skåne/1321/83(H1N1) was
very similar to that time “US viruses”, now termed classical SIVs, by using haemagglutination and neuraminidase inhibition, as well as oligonucleotide fingerprinting
methods. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial nucleotide
sequences of each viral gene confirmed the previous
findings (for HA and NA see Figures 1 and 2).
Both A/swine/Lidköping/1193/02(H1N1) and A/
swine/Sweden/1021/09(H1N2) proved to be European
SIV variants, the latter one belonging to the ‘avian-like’
(so-called ‘second-generation’) reassortant H1N2 viruses,
similar to those earlier detected in France, Italy and
recently in Denmark [1,13,20]. Sequence comparison of

the relevant genes of the isolates from 2002 and 2009
showed the following nucleotide identities: PB2
(93.45%), PB1 (90.99%), PA (90.74%), HA (92.59%), NP
(94.90%), M1 (95.41%) and NS1 (94.64%). Regarding the
internal genes the phylogenetic analyses revealed that
they had closely related PB2, NP and NS genes, and
grouped together with SIVs isolated in Hong Kong (i.e.,
A/swine/Hong Kong/NS857/2001(H1N2)) at the beginning of the last decade [21] (Figures 3, 4, and 5).
The matrix genes of the Swedish isolates did not show
close phylogenetic associations (data not shown): A/
swine/Lidköping/1193/02(H1N1) grouped together with
SIVs isolated in Thailand in 2005, which obtained its M
from Eurasian strains [22], while A/swine/Sweden/1021/
09(H1N2) was related to German strains in this genome
segment (e.g., A/swine/Muesleringen-S./IDT4263/05
(H3N2). In contrast, the NS genes of the two more
recent Swedish strains were closely related to each other
(belonging to 1E lineage), and particularly to H1N1 and
H1N2 viruses of French and Asian origin, while the
1983 isolate had an 1A lineage NS gene, a characteristic
of classical SIVs (Figure 5).
The HA genes of the two more recent Swedish isolates (i.e., from 2002 and 2009) grouped together with
other European lineage 1C HA genes (h1.1.3 sublineage
by Liu et al., [16]), which is a descendant of an avian
virus lineage (Figure 1) [3]. The 1983 isolate had a lineage 1A (h1.3.2 sublineage, Liu et al., [16]) HA, which is
associated with classical SIV isolates.
The NA genes represented three lineages: 1B, 1F, and
2A corresponding to the 1983, 2002, and 2009 viruses,
respectively, according to the Influenza A Virus Genotype Tool [15]. 1B (sublineage n1.3.2 in accordance with
Liu et al., [16]) NAs are the characteristics of classical
SIVs. NA 1F (n1.1.7) is represented by A/swine/Belgium/WVL1/1979(H1N1), which was the first SIV isolate of H1N1 avian influenza virus origin in Europe [21],
and NA 2A (n2.2.3) belongs to a large number of influenza viruses of diverse origin, comprising avian, swine,
and mainly human strains, including the A/Hong Kong/
1/1968(H3N2) pandemic isolate [23]. The phylogenetic
position of the NA gene of the 2002 isolate was alike its
HA while the 2009 virus had its NA gene originated
from European SIV-like H3N2 viruses (Figure 2) [13].
Taken together, the nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that the 1983 outbreak was caused by a classical
SIV. After some reports about its presence in Europe in
the first half of the last century, this type of SIVs was
reintroduced into Europe and isolated first in Italy in
the late 70’ies supposedly by imported pigs from the US
[24]. The following two outbreaks in Sweden were
caused by European avian-like SIVs, the most recent
one of them being a ‘second generation’ H1N2 reassortant, which were occasionally isolated in France and

Italy in the last decade and in Denmark lately [1,13,25].
Due to the lack of nucleotide sequence information of
the Danish viruses their genetic relationship to the
Swedish H1N2 SIVs could not be investigated. Nevertheless, the PB2, HA, NP and NS genes of the two latter
Swedish SIVs appeared to have a relative recent common ancestor. Along with that, at PB2 627 position,
which is considered to play important role in the virulence of influenza strains [26], the 2002 H1N1 and the
2009 H1N2 viruses contained glutamic acid, as most
avian isolates [27], while the “classic” Swedish virus a
lysine. Similarly, and in accordance with the prevalent
European SIVs, the two recent strains possessed the M2
S31N substitution, indicative of amantadine resistance
[28], while this is missing from the classical isolate. The
phylogenetic position of the isolates and the length of
the respective branches did not indicate a direct parentprogeny relationship between them, but rather that the
acquisition of these genes had occurred independently
form the ancestor viruses. Since swine influenza surveillance was not practiced in the past in the region it is
not known if SIVs of other subtypes have circulated in
the country potentially contributing to the gene constellation of the described isolates, as it is not uncommon
to have multiple subtypes of swine influenza viruses
being present in the same region in the same year [16].
The rest of the genes apparently originated from different lineages of SIVs, best exemplified by the NA
genes of three different sources (Figure 2).
Although the antigenic evolution of SIVs occurs at a
lower rate than in case of human viruses [29,30], their
frequent reassortation pose diagnostic and controlling
problems. From the diagnostic point of view, the widely
used haemagglutination inhibition tests can be affected
by the degree of homology between the antigen used/
investigated in a testing [9]. Recognizing the importance
of the presence of H1N2 subtype viruses in the member
countries there are trivalent vaccines already available in
the EU for controlling SI, which comprise all three subtypes of SIV (H1N1, H3N2, and human-like H1N2;
http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/vet/opinion/66108409en.
pdf;
http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/vet/opinion/
66111609en.pdf). There is weak cross-reactivity between
human-like and avian-like H1N2 SIVs induced immune
responses [11]. Therefore, the antigenic composition of
the vaccines needs regular re-evaluation and update
based on the epidemiological data on swine influenza,
taking into account the growing number of influenza
virus variants circulating in pigs, including the new
H1N1 viruses http://www.pighealth.com/influenza.
htm#Outbreaks. The knowledge on the genetic constellation of SIVs contributes to the comprehension of
these subjects and to the development of improved prevention strategies. Therefore, the molecular surveillance

of SIVs is an important and rational task. Moreover, in
order to comprehend the evolution and ecology of influenza viruses retrospective analyses are also indispensable, as exemplified by the numerous studies aiming at
the understanding of the appearance of pandemic H1N1
influenza viruses [31].
A recent surveillance investigation for the occurrence
of SIVs in five European countries demonstrated the
presence of multiple subtypes in each country [11].
Furthermore, it showed that the so-called ‘second-generation’ (avian-like reassortant) H1N2 SIVs, that are
alike the latest Swedish and recent Danish SIV isolates
[13], were not common in the investigated pig herds. In
fact, after their first notice in Europe in 1987 [7], they
had not spread beyond their region of isolation [1].
Swine influenza outbreaks are quite rare in Sweden,
thus, the number of isolates subjected to detailed
genetic studies is limited. In order to improve the
knowledge on the incidence of SIVs in the region, a
working group/network was established with the participation of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland,
Norway, and Sweden) in order to harmonize and facilitate research and diagnostic activities related to influenza in pigs by means of information exchange and
joint activities.
