Abstract
Background: WC1 co-receptors are group B scavenger receptor cysteine-rich molecules that are
found exclusively on γδT cells and are thought to be encoded by a multi-gene family. Previous
studies have shown γδT cells that respond to a particular stimulus have unique WC1 molecules
expressed. Prior to the onset of the studies described here only one full-length WC1 nucleotide
sequence was publicly available, though three WC1 molecules had been distinguished based on
monoclonal antibody reactivity. Furthermore, the number of WC1 genes found in the bovine
genome and their sequences had not yet been resolved.
Results: By annotating the bovine genome Btau_3.1 assembly, here we show the existence of 13
members in the WC1 gene family and their organization within two loci on chromosome 5
including three distinct exon-intron gene structures one of which coded for a potentially more
primitive and smaller WC1 molecule that is similar to the swine WC1 gene. We also provide
cDNA evidence as verification for many of the annotated sequences and show transcripts for
isoforms derived by alternative splicing.
Conclusion: It is possible that WC1 diversity contributes to functional differences that have been
observed between γδT cell populations. The studies described here demonstrate that WC1
molecules are encoded by a large, multi-gene family whose transcripts undergo extensive
alternative splicing. Similar to other non-rearranging immunoreceptors, it is likely that the WC1
gene repertoire underwent expansion in order to keep pace with rapidly changing ligands.

Background

γδT cells play important roles in immune responses by
their capacity to produce IFN-γ [1,2], down-modulate
immune responses following pathogen clearance [3,4]
and develop recall responses to antigen [1,5-7]. Thus it is
important to understand the manner by which they are
engaged in immune responses. Workshop cluster 1
(WC1) co-receptors are group B scavenger receptor
cysteine-rich (SRCR) transmembrane glycoproteins that

are unique to γδT cells [8-10] of some species including
cattle [11], sheep (T19) [9,12] and swine [13], but have
not yet been identified for humans or mice. Since different molecular forms of WC1 are found on functionally
distinct subpopulations of bovine γδT cells [2,14], we propose it to be a pattern recognition molecule and/or
involved in regulating signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR). Support for this comes from other group B
SRCR molecules found on immune system cells including

CD5 which is a positive and negative regulator of TCR and
B cell receptor signaling [15] and CD6 which functions as
an adhesion molecule [16] and for activation [17-19].
Also CD163, predominantly expressed on monocytes and
macrophages [20], plays an important role in down-regulating inflammatory responses [21] while DMBT1 on
macrophages functions as a pattern recognition molecule
(for review see [22]).
Diversity among the immune system-associated SRCR
molecules can result from alternative splicing of their
individual genes. CD5 and CD6 undergo alternative splicing within the cytoplasmic tail region [23-25] but function of these isoforms is unclear. Both CD163 and
DMBT1 undergo extensive alternative splicing of the
extracellular and cytoplasmic coding regions, and a
CD163 isoform lacking the transmembrane region has
been described [22,26,27]. While the predominant shorttailed CD163 variant mediates ligand internalization and
degradation, the function of the long-tail CD163 variant
is unknown [28] as is the role of DMBT1 splice variants.
Alternatively spliced variants have also been reported for
swine and sheep WC1 orthologs, splicing occurs within
both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, and isoforms lacking the transmembrane region have been identified [29,30]. Thus while isoform formation appears to
be common among SRCR molecules, diversity of immunoreceptors can also result from multiple genes and in
this regard WC1 is distinguished from the others.
Although WC1 is unique among group B SRCR molecules
because it alone is coded for by a large multi-gene family
[23,24,26,31,32], other non-SRCR immunoreceptors are
coded for by multi-gene families including the C-type lectin-like Ly49. Ly49 is a major receptor that regulates natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. It has 15 functional
genes in mice [33,34], but only a single copy in humans
[35,36] and cattle [37]. Additionally, the killer Ig-like
receptor (KIR) multi-gene family found on NK and T cells
of primates [38,39] and cattle [37] encodes products that
are functionally similar to but structurally distinct from
those of the Ly49 family. Both the KIR and Ly49 gene families are believed to have resulted from rapid repeated
gene duplication [33,40,41]. It has been speculated that
these families of closely related non-rearranging immunoreceptors have evolved to include large numbers of
duplicated genes to keep pace with rapidly changing ligands. This appears to be the case for MHC class I molecules, which comprise a large family and are the ligands
for Ly49 receptors in mice and rats and for KIR family
members in cattle and primates [33,37,42,43]. We
hypothesize that in the case of γδT cells WC1 is similarly
important in inducing and perpetuating γδT cell responses
thus necessitating the expansion of the WC1 repertoire.
This is supported by previous studies showing that anti-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/191

gen responsive WC1+ γδT cells express a restricted set of
TCR gamma genes regardless of the WC1 molecule found
on the cells [44] and that subpopulations of γδT cells that
respond to different stimuli express different WC1 molecules [2,14].
While three distinct WC1 molecular forms have been distinguished based on partial sequence and their reactivity
with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) [45], the number of
WC1 genes found in the bovine genome and their
sequences has yet to be resolved. Only one full-length
nucleotide sequence is publicly available (i.e. WC1.1,
known as the archetypal WC1) [11]. For sheep WC1 (also
known as T19), over 50 genes are predicted [46,47] based
on Southern blot analysis while for cattle many related
genes are predicted based on Southern blots [11] and 13
based on cDNA sequences of the WC1 intracytoplasmic
tails [48]. While the number of genes coding for porcine
WC1 proteins is unknown, swine have a more abbreviated
version of WC1 which has 6 SRCR domains. This suggests
swine WC1 genes did not undergo the same internal SRCR
domain-duplication that occurred in cattle [29] since previously described bovine WC1 molecules have 11 SRCR
domains [11]. By annotating the bovine genome Btau_3.1
assembly, here we demonstrate the existence of 13 members in the WC1 family and show their organization
within two loci including a bovine gene coding for the
putatively more primitive and smaller swine-like WC1
molecule. We also provide cDNA evidence as verification
for many of the annotated sequences as well as for isoforms derived by alternative splicing.

Results
Annotation of WC1 genes
Here we set out to annotate the bovine genome to confirm
the existence of the large number of WC1 genes (10–13
genes) transcript analyses supported for cattle [11,48].
While diversity in cattle WC1 molecules could result from
alternative gene splicing as occurs for another T cell
expressed-SRCR gene CD6 [23], Southern blots indicated
up to 50 WC1 genes in the closely related ruminant species of sheep [46,47]. It is known that in ruminants WC1
SRCR domains are each encoded by a single exon and that
at least archetypal WC1.1 consists of 11 SRCR domains,
the first of which is a unique Domain 1 followed by a
region of 5 SRCR domains that is repeated once [11].
Archetypal WC1.1 also has three inter-domain regions
and a transmembrane region that are encoded by single
exons and a cytoplasmic tail coded by either 4 or 5 exons
[2]. Using this paradigm as a starting point, we identified
three types of WC1 genes based on unique exon-intron
structures (Figure 1). All three types contained exons coding for highly-related repeating SRCR domains, interdomain sequences, transmembrane domains and intracytoplasmic tail domains. The distinguishing features

Figure 1
Schematic representation of WC1 exon-intron structure
Schematic representation of WC1 exon-intron structure. Three structures were identified and were found to contain
differing numbers of exons. Representative structures of WC1 genes containing (A) 20 exons (Type I; based on genomic
sequence for WC1-5, GLEAN_13176) (B) 21 exons (Type II; based on genomic sequence for WC1-9, GLEAN_12191) (C) 15
exons (Type III, based on genomic sequence for WC1-11, GLEAN_09904 and GLEAN_12182) are shown. Exon numbers and
SRCR domain numbers are indicated. Scale is shown in base pair increments beneath the schematic. Abbreviations are as follows: ID, inter-domain sequence; TM, transmembrane region; ICD, intracytoplasmic domain.

between the types represented by the schematic in Figure
1A (Type I) and Figure 1B (Type II) is that Type I genes
contained one less exon than Type II genes for a total of
20 or 21 exons, respectively. This additional exon in Type
II was found within the intracytoplasmic coding sequence
and accounts for the "long-tail" WC1 molecular form [2]
which can have 15 to more amino acids in the intracytoplasmic tail region than are found in Type I genes. Both of
the types shown in Figure 1A and Figure 1B demonstrates
that WC1 genes encompass a coding region of approximately 60 kb. This is in contrast with the third type of
WC1 genes identified here (Type III, Figure 1C), which
contained 15 exons total and encompassed a coding
region of approximately 25 kb. Type III genes code for a
WC1 molecule structurally similar to the described swine
WC1 with 6 SRCR domains [29]. Unlike Type I and Type
II genes, whose intracytoplasmic domains are encoded by
four or five exons, respectively, Type III genes appear to

have a much longer intracytoplasmic domain which is
encoded by six exons resulting in approximately 80 additional acids relative to Type I.
Using these three gene structures as a basis for annotation
of GLEAN gene-prediction models from the Btau_3.1
assembly, the organization and orientation of 13 WC1
genes on chromosome 5 was determined (Figure 2). WC1
genes were identified on four scaffolds including Chr5.17,
Chr5.128, Chr5.129 and Chr5.130 and chromosomal
locations are reported in Table 1. Annotated genomic
WC1 sequences were classified and named generally
based on chromosomal location. The following GLEAN
gene models were identified by BLAST search using the
archetypal WC1 sequence and were manually annotated
as WC1 genes: GLEAN_13183 (WC1-1), GLEAN_13182
(WC1-2), GLEAN_13181 (WC1-3), GLEAN_13179
(WC1-4), GLEAN_13176 (WC1-5), GLEAN_00457/

Alignment of WC1 deduced amino acid sequences identified in the genome (part 1). Full-length deduced amino
acid sequences of the annotated WC1 genes were aligned using ClustalW2 and the default parameters and were refined by
hand. The archetypal WC1 sequence (WC1.1, GenBank accession number X63723) was included in the analysis for comparison. WC1-2, WC1-3, WC1-6, WC1-8 and WC1-12 sequences are partial due to gaps in the genome sequence. Gene types (I, II
or III), as determined based on exon-intron structure are indicated to the left of the sequences. Identities are indicated by dots
(.), gaps resulting from the alignment are indicated by tildes (~), gaps resulting from lack of genomic sequence (when the gaps
were found adjacent and not within a coding region) are indicated by dashes (-). SRCR domains are indicated in roman numerals and the transmembrane region is shown underlined for the archetypal WC1.1 sequence.

were found in opposite orientations of one another it is
possible that scaffold Chr5.130 itself was assembled in
the wrong orientation. In some cases gaps in the genomic
sequence made it impossible to annotate a complete gene
and therefore some of the sequences are incomplete (see
Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6). Specifically, sequences were incom-

plete due to gaps adjacent to the coding region (WC1-2,
WC1-3 and WC1-8), gaps within the coding region (WC112) or because the gene was situated at the end of a scaffold (WC1-6). Also, sequences coding for additional
SRCR domains were found both outside and within the
coding regions of putative WC1 genes and were predicted
to be either pseudogenes (not shown) or part of intronic
sequence based on the presence of premature stop codons
or frameshifts that resulted in premature stop codons.
Nevertheless, the data presented here support the existence of a large family of genes, with three distinct structures, coding for individual WC1 molecules in ruminants.

Alignment of WC1 deduced amino acid sequences identified in the genome (part 2). Full-length deduced amino
acid sequences of the annotated WC1 genes were aligned using ClustalW2 and the default parameters and were refined by
hand. The archetypal WC1 sequence (WC1.1, GenBank accession number X63723) was included in the analysis for comparison. WC1-2, WC1-3, WC1-6, WC1-8 and WC1-12 sequences are partial due to gaps in the genome sequence. Gene types (I, II
or III), as determined based on exon-intron structure are indicated to the left of the sequences. Identities are indicated by dots
(.), gaps resulting from the alignment are indicated by tildes (~), gaps resulting from lack of genomic sequence (when the gaps
were found adjacent and not within a coding region) are indicated by dashes (-). SRCR domains are indicated in roman numerals and the transmembrane region is shown underlined for the archetypal WC1.1 sequence.

with the archetypal WC1 sequence (Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6).
Genes are grouped according to their distinct gene structure (i.e. Types I – III) and it is evident that genes of a particular type have sequence similarity. However, despite
WC1-4 and WC1-9 having different types of gene structures their extracellular regions are very similar although
differences within their intracytoplasmic tail regions occur
as would be expected since WC1-9 has an extra exon.
When WC1 gene distribution on chromosome 5 was evaluated it was found that their relatedness based on type did
not correlate entirely with their genomic location (refer to
Figure 2).

cDNA evidence for WC1 distinct gene structures
mRNA derived from bovine PBMC was analyzed to confirm the transcription of the multiple genes annotated
above. To verify that cDNA sequences (designated with a
prefix of 'CH') obtained were indeed representative of
multiple genes, instead of genetic variation among animals, all reactions were performed using mRNA from a
single animal. Also, because WC1+ γδT cells with different
WC1 molecular forms respond to different activation
stimuli [2,14], reactions were performed with pooled
cDNA from ConA-activated, leptospira-activated and ex
vivo PBMC in order to maximize the number of WC1
transcripts amplified.

Alignment of WC1 deduced amino acid sequences identified in the genome (part 4). Full-length deduced amino
acid sequences of the annotated WC1 genes were aligned using ClustalW2 and the default parameters and were refined by
hand. The archetypal WC1 sequence (WC1.1, GenBank accession number X63723) was included in the analysis for comparison. WC1-2, WC1-3, WC1-6, WC1-8 and WC1-12 sequences are partial due to gaps in the genome sequence. Gene types (I, II

Analysis of PCR products showed that primer combinations (see Table 2 and Methods) used to amplify fulllength WC1 yielded two bands of approximately 4.4 kb
and 2.7 kb for primer pairs WC1atg-for/WC1group1,2-rev
and WC1atg-for/WC1group4-rev and approximately 2.9
kb and 2.2 kb for primer pair WC1atg-for/WC1group3rev. Sequencing revealed that the larger bands of approximately 4.4 kb were most frequently full-length WC1 of

Type I and II while the 2.9 kb was most frequently fulllength Type III. However, on occasion some transcripts in
these bands were found to be alternatively spliced. The
smaller sized bands of approximately 2.7 kb and 2.2 kb
contained transcripts that always represented alternative
splicing and are described further below. Sequence alignments were generated based on the deduced amino acid
sequences from representative cDNA clones and anno-

Domain 1 is the most variable SRCR domain
When we compared individual WC1 SRCR domains using
cDNA and annotated genomic sequences by aligning
deduced amino acid sequences we found the greatest variability among Domain 1's, with percent identities as low
as 50.4% (Table 4). There was less variability among the
other domains with Domain 9's sharing the most identity
ranging from 88.2% to 99.0% (Table 4). Classification of
WC1 cDNA clones described here, based on exon-intron
structure and on sequence identity to annotated WC1

tated WC1 genes and percent identities were calculated
based on those alignments (Table 3). Because the
sequences varied in length due to either incomplete
genomic sequence availability or alternative splice variation, sequences were aligned in a pairwise manner and
were truncated so that comparisons were made only
between regions that were common to both sequences.
Archetypal WC1 sequence (GenBank accession number
X63723) was compared to both the annotated WC1 gene
sequences as well as the cDNA sequences generated as part
of this study. This analysis revealed that while primer pairs
WC1atg-for/WC1group1,2-rev
and
WC1atg-for/
WC1group4-rev amplified the same transcripts, primer
pair WC1atg-for/WC1group3-rev specifically amplified
cDNA whose sequence represented Type III genes and
thus was most similar to swine WC1 (GenBank accession
number CAA67709). This also demonstrated that cDNA
evidence was available for many of the predicted genes
including ones representing each of the three types including WC1-1, WC1-3, WC1-4 and WC1-13 as Type I, WC19 as Type II and WC1-11 as Type III.

sequences, is reported in Table 5 based on the following
reasoning. In many cases sequence identity of ≥ 98%,
based on comparison of full-length sequence as described
in Table 3, was sufficient to classify cDNA sequences:
CH501 as WC1-1, CH496 as WC1-4, CH505 as WC1-9
and CH486 as WC1-11. In every case, except for CH486,
additional WC1 genes shared > 90% identity with classified cDNA sequences.
In other cases classification required refinement. That is,
because Domain 1's were found to be the most variable
domain, cDNA and genomic sequences coding for
Domain 1's were aligned (Figure 7A) and used to generate
a phylogram (Figure 7B). Only non-redundant sequences
were included in the analysis and included those
described here as Type II (WC1-9, WC1 -10, WC1-12 and
CH505), Type III (WC1-11 and CH486) and Type I
(remaining sequences for which type could be determined). These were useful in classifying cDNA sequences
with regard to the annotated sequences. While we found
when comparing full-length sequences that CH534 was
97.1% identical to WC1-5, its Domain 1 sequence is most
identical to WC1-3 and was therefore classified as such.
Conversely, CH504 was 94.6% identical to WC1-2 but
was classified here as WC1-13 (which was 93.8% identical) because no WC1-2 Domain 1 sequence is currently
available for comparison. Likewise, CH525 was found to
be 97.0% identical to WC1-2 but was not classified as
such due to lack of Domain 1 sequence and is instead designated as WC1-nd1. CH525 was the only complete cDNA
clone for which no related genomic WC1 was identified
out of a total of 35 sequences evaluated. Therefore our
findings indicate that differing WC1 molecular forms are
based on germline sequences and are not a result of
domain-exon rearrangements among individual WC1
genes as occurs for T cell receptor and immunoglobulin
genes. The sequence for WC1-nd1 is likely to occur in the
assembly gaps and suggests at least one additional WC1
gene.
Domain 1 comparisons also provided evidence for transcription of two more genes. CH590 and CH601 Domain
1 sequences (Wang F, Herzig CTA, Baldwin CL, Telfer JC:
Response of bovine γδT cells to Leptospira requires WC1
expression. Genes and Immunity, submitted) corresponded to those of the genes designated WC1-5 and
WC1-10, respectively, for which corresponding full-length
transcripts were not found above. Since the relationship
between other cDNA and genomic sequences seen in
Table 3 were largely maintained when just Domain 1
sequences were compared here (Figure 7), this is reasonable evidence for transcription of WC1-5 and WC1-10.
Finally, one Domain 1 cDNA sequence, CH583, lacked
genomic corresponding sequence and thus was named
WC1-nd2 and suggests a fifteenth WC1 gene.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/191

The phylogram generated based on Domain 1 sequences
(Figure 7B) demonstrated that although the genes differ in
their exon-intron structures, there was not a similarly clear
distinction between the genes when just their Domain 1's
were evaluated. However, these data do confirm findings
shown in Table 4 indicating that Domain 1 is the most
variable domain. This is most notable when seen in contrast with a multiple sequence alignment of deduced
amino acid Domain 9 sequences (Figure 8A) and its subsequent phylogram (Figure 8B). Domain 9 was found to
be the least variable of the 11 WC1 SRCR domains and
this is reflected in the phylogenetic analysis. It is possible
that, if Domain 1 is indeed the ligand binding region,
selective pressures that drive Domain 1 variability would
not necessarily apply to the other SRCR domains.
Intracytoplasmic region analysis and classification
It could be reasoned that the most divergent of the 11
WC1 SRCR domains, i.e. Domain 1 as shown above,
would be the ligand binding region of the WC1 co-receptor and thus that the WC1 Domain 1 sequence associated
with a particular γδT cell could influence its response to
various stimuli. However, it is also possible that variation
in the intracytoplasmic tail regions of WC1 could convey
signaling differences which would influence the outcome
of receptor ligation. This is supported by previous observations regarding the tail function [49]. Therefore, comparisons of WC1 intracytoplasmic region cDNA
sequences with genomic intracytoplasmic sequences were
done.

The alignment (Figure 9A) and resulting phylogram (Figure 9B) confirmed that tail sequences clustered according
to their exon-intron structure (described in Figure 1). That
is, WC1-9, WC1-10, WC1-12 and CH505 clustered and
are representative of the Type II WC1 molecular forms
and, with the exception of WC1-11 which is Type III, all
other WC1 genomic and cDNA sequences in the various
other clusters are classified as Type I. One cDNA clone
included in those (CH533) contained archetypal WC1.1
sequence with a premature stop in the intracytoplasmic
domain which should not affect tyrosine phosphorylation
based on its location [49]; this sequence had been previously independently obtained as well [48]. For Type III,
WC1-11 clustered with CH486 and their tail sequences
were found to be most similar to swine WC1 supporting
evidence described above for this unique type. To confirm
this relatedness, swine WC1 sequences were included for
comparison. There are five publicly available sequences
for swine WC1 including one unique Domain 1 sequence
and two unique intracytoplasmic tail sequences
(swppWC1 and swWC1-29e1; GenBank accession numbers CAA67710 and CAA67709, respectively). Here we
demonstrated bovine WC1-11 intracytoplasmic tail
sequence is more closely related to swWC1-29e1 than to

any other bovine WC1 intracytoplasmic tail region. However, the intracytoplasmic region of WC1-11, and its corresponding cDNA clone CH486, is strikingly longer than
that of the other bovine WC1 genes and contains additional sequence (amino acids 790–837) that is not found
even in swine WC1. Overall, the relationships established
by comparing WC1 Domain 1 sequences (see Figure 7B)
were largely maintained by the comparisons of tail
sequences. However, some WC1 molecules, such as WC14 and WC1-9, have highly similar extracellular domains
suggesting that they may bind the same ligand, but they
differ in their tail structures, as illustrated in Figure 9B.
This suggests that cells bearing WC1-4 or WC1-9 might
differ in their functional responses (as occurs with other
paired receptors [50]).
Evidence for isoform generation
As mentioned above, RT-PCR products for WC1 transcripts yielded bands of approximately 2.7 kb and 2.2 kb
in addition to the larger bands that most commonly contained full-length sequence. When the smaller bands were
sequenced they were found to represent alternative splice
variants. All 35 WC1 cDNA sequences obtained in this
study are shown schematically with alternative splice variants aligned with non-spliced sequences to indicate the
missing domains (Figure 10) providing evidence of isoform generation. Interestingly, on some occasions the
larger bands were also found to contain transcripts representing alternative splice variants that lacked the transmembrane region and/or a single SRCR domain (e.g.
CH503 and CH529). Spliced cDNA sequences were designated as a particular WC1 if the existing deduced amino
acid sequence shared ≥ 98% identity with the corresponding full-length WC1 sequence.

There was no apparent pattern to WC1 splicing. It was
most common for entire SRCR domains to be missing,
though in one case (CH485) half of a domain was missing
but it still appeared to result in a viable transcript. Most
often five contiguous SRCR domains were missing so that
the resulting transcript contained six SRCR domains; however, transcripts lacking anywhere from one to six full

SRCR domains were identified. WC1 transcripts lacking
the transmembrane regions (thus are putatively secreted
molecules) were also identified as otherwise full-length
WC1 sequences as well as for WC1 splice variants lacking
either four or five SRCR domains. While two WC1 cDNA
sequences (CH533 and CH520) have shorter intracytoplasmic domains due to premature stop codons, there was
no evidence of alternative splicing within the intracytoplasmic domain.

Discussion
To better characterize the bovine WC1 co-receptor family
we annotated the WC1 genes in the bovine genome
Btau_3.1 assembly and identified 13 WC1 genes distributed between two loci on chromosome 5. This included a
novel WC1 gene that more closely resembles swine WC1
than it does previously identified ruminant WC1 genes.
Work is ongoing to resolve the gaps in the genome assembly of chromosome 5. However, the number of WC1
genes in the multi-gene family agrees reasonably well with
previous reports estimating the occurrence of many
related WC1 genes based on Southern blots [11] and of 13
WC1 genes based on cDNA analysis of intracytoplasmic
tail region transcripts [48] but is fewer than the 50 WC1
genes predicted for sheep by Southern blotting [46,47].
The distribution of WC1 genes between two loci is reminiscent of the two TCR gamma loci for cattle and sheep
(TRG1 and TRG2) where it is predicted that a number of
duplication events and a subsequent translocation event
resulted in the formation of the TRG2 locus [51]. It is possible that similar events contributed to the formation of
the WC1 loci because the distribution of WC1 genes based
on sequence similarity does not support the idea that a
single WC1 locus underwent duplication. Also, interestingly, the distribution of the three distinct exon-intron
structures identified here for the WC1 genes (i.e. Type I, II
or III) among the two loci also does not support locus
duplication alone because the Type II and III genes are
found only within a single locus.
We verified the gene annotations by amplifying and
sequencing WC1 cDNA from bovine cells derived from a

single animal. cDNA evidence confirmed the presence of
at least a single functional gene, in an individual animal,
for each of the three types of genes differentiated by their
exon-intron structure. It is important to note that the profile of WC1 transcripts obtained from this individual animal is not necessarily representative of all WC1 genes
expressed. This is despite using an experimental design in
which cDNA from several conditions was pooled prior to
PCR as well as using a variety of primers in an attempt to
avoid biased amplification of particular WC1 transcripts.
With regard to this, it was notable that transcripts representative of archetypal WC1.1, the only full-length
sequence previously published [11], were not found to be
abundant, to the extent that it was necessary to design a
separate primer to preferentially amplify archetypal
WC1.1 transcripts. Nevertheless, we confirmed the presence of 8 out of 13 WC1 genes based on cDNA sequences
that corresponded to genomic sequences while cDNA evidence for WC1-2, WC1-6, WC1-7, WC1-8 and WC1-12
was not found. (Because many of those gene sequences
are partial, it cannot be ruled out that cDNA evidence does
exist for those genes but could not be classified as such at
this point). Although all cDNA transcript sequences varied to some extent from corresponding genomic
sequences, variations found between cDNA and related
genomic sequences are most likely attributable to variation between animals due to single nucleotide polymorphisms. Indeed, even within a single animal there was
preliminary evidence of allelic polymorphism (C.T.A.
Herzig, unpublished data). Only two WC1 sequences
derived from RT-PCR, CH525 and CH583, lacked any corresponding genomic sequence and were assigned the gene
names of WC1-nd1 and WC1-nd2, respectively. The identification of a cDNA sequence lacking a corresponding
genomic sequence could be a consequence of a gap in the
genome sequence thus necessarily precluding the annotation of the corresponding gene. There is also evidence for
copy number variation of WC1 genes among animals (G.
Liu and J. Keele, personal communication, December 7,
2007) and this would also account for the observed differences.

Prior to these studies WC1 sequence corresponding to
swine WC1 had not been identified in ruminants. The
bovine swine-like WC1-11 reported here is structurally
similar to WC1 in swine containing 6 SRCR domains, a
transmembrane region and a long intracytoplasmic tail. It
has been suggested that swine WC1 is the primitive version of its ruminant ortholog [29], so it could also be reasoned that in bovine WC1-11 is the most primitive of the
ruminant WC1 genes. However, interestingly, the bovine
WC1-11 has a very long intracytoplasmic region while
swine WC1 genes have intracytoplasmic regions that are
approximately the same length as those of the more classical bovine WC1 genes despite much dissimilarity in
sequence [45]. Current evidence for the classical bovine
WC1 intracytoplasmic tails indicates that both tyrosine
and serine phosphorylation is important for activation
signals and endocytosis, respectively [49]. It is possible
that the presence of a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation
motif within the unique portion of bovine WC1-11 intracytoplasmic region could result in a signaling and/or functional role that is distinct from other WC1 genes.
With regard to this, Wijngaard and co-workers identified
and designated three distinct WC1 gene products as
WC1.1, WC1.2 and WC1.3 based on reactivity with specific mAbs using WC1-transfected cells [45]. Based on
those studies, WC1 bearing γδT cells were subsequently
defined based on mAb reactivity as WC1.1+, WC1.2+,
WC1.1+/WC1.2+ or WC1.1+/WC1.3+ wherein the WC1.3+
population is only found as a subpopulation of WC1.1+
cells. While the sequence for WC1.1 has been reported in
its entirety, only limited putative amino acid sequence for
Domains 1 and 2 and nucleotide sequence for segments
of the intracytoplasmic tails for WC1.2 and WC1.3 have
been reported. WC1.3 was unique with regard to its long
intracytoplasmic tail [45] and that sequence can be found
to correspond to Type II WC1 tail sequences here. However, based on our annotations no WC1 gene was identified that had the sequence reported by Wijngaard et al.
[45] as that corresponding to Domain 1 of WC1.3; in fact
similar sequence was instead found in Domain 6 of WC14 and WC1-9, and thus we suggest part of the published

WC1.3 sequence is erroneous. Despite this problem it has
already been shown that functionally distinct subpopulations of bovine γδT cells can be defined based on the presence of particular WC1 molecules that react with
monoclonal antibodies recognizing WC1.1 or WC1.2
[2,14] and we now know that WC1 intracytoplasmic tails
corresponding to the archetypal WC1.1 sequence play a
critical role in signal transduction in response to antigen
[49]. Thus, it is important to further evaluate the role of
the long intracytoplasmic tail regions contained in Type II
genes WC1- 9, WC1-10, WC1-12 and the swine-like Type
III gene WC1-11. Because Domain 1 is the most diverse
among WC1 SRCR domains, as shown here, it is possible

that it serves as the pattern recognition portion of the
WC1 molecule and could be a region where bacterial
products are ligated as occurs for DMBT1 [52]. Therefore,
pairings of particular WC1 Domain 1's with particular
intracytoplasmic tail regions may be crucial to directing
γδT cell responses and functions. Future studies will be targeted towards better understanding those relationships.
For instance, transfection experiments with WC1-4 and
WC1-9 would enable us to determine whether they bind
the same ligands but their intracytoplasmic tails send different signals and thus result in differing functional
responses.

Finally, the occurrence of a large variety of bovine WC1
molecules can be explained only in part by the number of
WC1 genes since here we report evidence for extensive
alternative splicing of bovine WC1 transcripts. In fact, all
but one of the expressed WC1 genes we identified had corresponding splice variants. Immunoprecipitation of γδT
cell membranes with anti-WC1 mAb results in a variety of
bands including 144, 180, 200, 220, 240 and 300 kDa
[10,12,53-57], lending support to the occurrence of multiple isoforms and/or swine-like WC1-11 on γδT cells.
While the possibility remains that what appear to be alternative splice variants are instead genes that were not identified during the annotation process as a result of gaps in
the genomic sequence, all but two alternative splice variants can be related to unspliced transcript sequences that
are ≥ 98% identical. Moreover, previous reports indicate
that swine and sheep WC1 orthologs [29,46] as well as
other SRCR family immune system molecules (i.e. CD5,
CD6 and CD163) produce transcripts that are alternatively spliced [22-27]. However, interestingly, unlike for
CD6 and CD163 [23-26], WC1 intracytoplasmic tail
length appears to be dictated by the particular gene encoding a transcript and not by alternative splicing.
It is notable that Domain 1, the putative ligand-binding
portion, was never found to be missing as a result of alternative splicing. While this could be an artifact due to
primer design, the forward primer was designed to anneal
in the leader sequence and thus that explanation is
unlikely. Precedence for multiple isoforms of a T cell coreceptor is shown by the two CD4-like genes in fish which
differ from each other structurally [58,59]. The function of
these smaller WC1 molecules with apparently intact
Domain 1's and intracytoplasmic tails is unknown but
intriguing. Because WC1 serves as a co-receptor on γδT
cells, smaller WC1 molecules may be better able to cocluster in the immune synapse with the shorter TCR
chains (each being about 30 kDa). It is also possible that
WC1 isoforms differ in their flexibility given that fulllength WC1 molecules contain inter-domain or "hinge"
regions following SRCR domains 3, 8, and 10, and this
could affect interaction with the TCR. Differences in flexibility have been noted for functionally different immunoglobulin heavy chains with IgE and IgM lacking hinge
regions. It is yet to be determined whether transcripts of
the same gene but with different alternative splice variants
are found expressed by an individual cell but perhaps
WC1 splicing is initiated following interaction with its ligand.

Conclusion
Based on annotations of the bovine genome we identified
13 members of the WC1 gene family and their organization within two loci. Many of those genes had not been
previously described, including a gene coding for a puta-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/191

tively more primitive and smaller swine-like WC1 molecule. Furthermore, we provide cDNA evidence as
verification for many of the annotated sequences as well
as evidence for isoforms derived by alternative splicing
and the suggestion of at least two more WC1 genes. It is
possible that WC1 diversity contributes to functional differences that have been observed between γδT cell subpopulations and here we have demonstrated that diversity
of WC1 molecules is attributable to a large, multi-gene
family as well as to the fact that WC1 transcripts undergo
extensive alternative splicing.

Methods
Genome annotation
In conjunction with the Bovine Genome Sequencing Consortium
http://genomes.arc.georgetown.edu/bovine/,
manual annotation of the WC1 genes was performed
using the Apollo Genome Annotation and Curation Tool,
version 1.6.5 [60] and the bovine genome assembly
Btau_3.1 [61]. Predicted gene models of putative WC1
genes were identified by performing a BLAST search of
archetypal WC1.1 sequence against the Bovine Official
Gene Set (called GLEAN). Predicted gene models were
then analyzed using the Apollo software and the following actions were performed when necessary based on
available EST or cDNA evidence: (i) models were checked
for correct exon-intron structure, (ii) initiation and termination codons were identified, (iii) exons were either
added or deleted if it was determined that the coding
region in the predicted model was incorrect and (iv) predicted gene models were split when a single model
encompassed more than one gene or merged when two
models coded for a single gene. Predicted gene models
identified from the BLAST search were considered pseudogenes when premature stop codons, frameshifts and/or a
WC1 coding region exceeding approximately 60 kb
occurred in areas where the sequence integrity was
deemed adequate.
Animals and cells
Blood was collected via jugular venipuncture into heparin
from a single female Belted Galloway between the ages of
11 and 19 months. Animal use complied with federal
guidelines and had IACUC approval. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated via density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque™ PLUS (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. PBMC were cultured at 2.5 × 106
cells/ml with Concavalin A (ConA; 1.0 μg/ml; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) or leptospira antigen ([1], 0.5 μg/
ml; sonicated whole cells of L. borgpetersenii serovar
hardjo clone RZ33) in RPMI 1640 medium containing
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone,
Logan, UT), 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 μM 2-mercaptoetha-

nol and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37°C with 5% CO2 in air
for six days.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR
Pelleted ex vivo, ConA-activated or leptospira antigenactivated cells were resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and RNA was isolated according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription (RT) was
performed using 1 μg of total RNA, oligo dT primers and
AMV reverse transcriptase (AMV RT kit; Promega, Madison, WI). 2 μl of pooled cDNA was used as template in
subsequent polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using the
Elongase Amplification system (Invitrogen) and a final
concentration of 1.5 mM Mg2+. Generally, PCR was conducted using a forward primer (designated "WC1atg-for")
designed to amplify all WC1 transcripts based on the
annotations described here and an additional forward
primer (designated "WC1full-forA") was used in separate
reactions to preferentially amplify archetypal WC1.1 transcripts. Reverse primers (designated WC1groups1,2-rev,
WC1group3-rev and WC1group4-rev) were designed to
specifically amplify each of three sequence-related subgroups of WC1 transcripts based on the WC1 genes identified here. Primer sequences are in Table 2. Cycling
parameters were 30s at 94°C, 30s at 52°C and 4 m 30s at
68°C for 35 cycles for all reactions. In a limited number
of cases, WC1 Domain 1 only was amplified in PCR reactions using the WC1atg-for primer and a reverse primer
which was designed within a conserved region to amplify
Domain 1 of all known WC1 molecules, designated
SRCR1-rev (Table 2). Cycling parameters for those reactions were 30s at 95°C, 1 m at 58°C and 1 m at 72°C for
30 cycles with an expected band size of approximately 530
bp. PCR products were analyzed on 1.2% TAE agarose
gels, visualized using SYBR Safe (Invitrogen) or ethidium
bromide and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen)
or the pCR-XL vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 35 full-length cDNA clones
were sequenced commercially (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ) in order to verify the insert identity and for subsequent sequence analysis.

Table 5 for accession numbers), and classified based on
annotated genomic sequences described herein. Other
sequences used for comparisons in analyses included
bovine archetypal WC1.1 (GenBank accession number
X63723) and swine WC1 (GenBank accession numbers
CAA67706 to CAA67710). Exon-intron structure schematics were based on alignments of cDNA and genomic
DNA sequence using SIM4 [63] and visualized with LalnView http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/lalnview.html.
Multiple sequence alignments were performed using
ClustalW2
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/
index.html; [64]) and the default parameters, refined by
hand when necessary, and were visualized using JalView
[65]. SRCR domain organization of alternatively spliced
variants was determined using ClustalW2 analysis of
deduced amino acid sequences to determine which
domains were represented in each clone. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed using deduced amino acid
sequences of individual WC1 domains or tails, as indicated. Phylogenies were constructed in MEGA4 [66] using
the neighbour-joining method [67] and the p-distance
model for amino acid sequences and were tested using
bootstrap analysis [68] with 1000 replications.

Sequence analyses
Sequencing of plasmids containing full-length WC1
cDNA was initially performed using T7 forward and M13
reverse primers. Subsequent sequencing reactions were
performed using internal primers designed based on individual plasmid sequences (Table 2). Typically, four to six
sequencing reactions were required to fully sequence a
single WC1 transcript in the forward and reverse directions. Nucleotide sequences were aligned and consensus
sequences were created using BioEdit version 7.0.5.3 [62].
WC1 sequences reported here that were derived from
cloned RT-PCR products were submitted to GenBank
