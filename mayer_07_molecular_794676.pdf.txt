Abstract
The lack of obvious morphological differences between species impedes the identification of
species in many groups of organisms. Meanwhile, DNA-based approaches are increasingly used to
survey biological diversity. In this study we show that sequencing the mitochondrial protein-coding
gene NADH dehydrogenase, subunit 1 (nd1) from 534 bats of the Western Palaearctic region
corroborates the promise of DNA barcodes in two major respects. First, species described with
classical taxonomic tools can be genetically identified with only a few exceptions. Second,
substantial sequence divergence suggests an unexpected high number of undiscovered species.

Findings
A total of at least 1.5 million species of organisms are
described, but an estimated number of 10 to 100 million
species may live on our planet [1,2]. This huge gap gave
rise to search for new technologies to describe the biological diversity. Meanwhile, genetic screening approaches
involving a single or a small number of genes – often
referred to as DNA barcoding – were started in diverse taxonomic groups for two major aims: (i) to establish a
standardized technique to identify species, and (ii) to
detect new species in an efficient manner to bring us
closer to the true number of species [3-6]. So far, DNA barcodes were primarily used for genetic species identification of taxonomically poorly studied taxa and geographic
regions like the tropics [7-11]. Here we tested the applicability of DNA sequencing for species delineation and species identification in one of the best-known taxonomic
groups in an intensively sampled geographic region.
A recently compiled list of all mammal species of the
world specifies a total of 44 vespertilionid bats species for

the Western Palaearctic region [12]. One additional species was recently described (Pipistrellus hanaki [13]) and
another was given species rank (Plecotus christii [14]). In
this study we sequenced 900 base pairs of the mitochondrial nd1 gene [15] of 534 bats from 41 of the 46
described species [see Additional file 1]. This revealed species-specific DNA sequences that differed at least by 4%
(uncorrected p distance) from sequences from other species in 816 of 820 pairwise species comparisons. Intraspecific variation was much lower than interspecific
variation, which allowed a reliable genetic identification
of most species (figure 1). Only four pairs of species
showed genetic distances below 2.5% and species did not
split in two monophyletic groups in all four pairs of species. Individuals of different species within these four species pairs occasionally shared the same sequence type.
This lack of substantial sequence divergence between two
species can have different reasons. Recent speciation or
introgression of mitochondrial haplotypes are likely
explanations for similar mitochondrial DNA sequences
within the three species pairs Eptesicus serotinus/E. nilssonii

[15], Myotis myotis/M. oxygnathus [16,17] and possibly also
for Pipistrellus kuhlii/P. deserti. In contrast, the observed
genetic similarity of only 0.3% sequence divergence and
the similarity in morphology and echolocation calls
between Hypsugo ariel and H. bodenheimeri is due to the
fact that both taxa are likely to represent one single species
as morphological differences are restricted to an additional cusp at the second upper incisor in H. bodenheimeri
[18]. Therefore, we treated both taxa as a single species. In
total, nd1 sequences of 40 investigated species allowed the
unambiguous genetic identification of 34 species, which
equals to 85%.
Substantial nd1 sequence divergence allowed also the distinction of several morphologically characterized taxa
whose species status was questioned until recently
[12,19]. Sequences of Barbastella leucomelas from the type
locality on the Sinai Peninsula differed on average by
13.3% from sequences obtained from European B. barbastellus. In addition, morphologically characterized subspecies within four species (Eptesicus bottae, E. serotinus,
Plecotus auritus and P. kolombatovici [see Additional file 2])
showed mean genetic distances between 5.8 and 15.2%.
These examples illustrate that morphologically similar
taxa can be genetically well differentiated and that the
combination of morphological and mitochondrial DNA
sequence datasets is a powerful approach to resolve taxonomic uncertainties. The congruence between slight morphological differences and substantial sequence
divergence of at least 5% indicates distinct species. Nevertheless, only the sympatric occurrence of both taxa can
finally proof the existence of true biological species [20].
Highly divergent mitochondrial lineages were found in
four species. Most astounding were two bats in central
Europe (southern Austria and northern Italy) that had
been identified as Myotis nattereri according to external
morphology. They differ in their sequences from other
central European M. nattereri by on average 9.7%. Among
108 individuals of Myotis mystacinus from all over Europe
we found two individuals in Bulgaria that carried another
mtDNA haplotype that differed on average by 10.2% from
typical M. mystacinus. Bats originally assigned to Hypsugo
savii split even into three highly divergent lineages [see
Additional file 2]. Finally, in Pipistrellus kuhlii a western
(Europe, Morocco and Libya) and eastern (Israel, Syria
and Iran) lineage can be distinguished, which differ on
average by 5.2%.
Highly divergent mitochondrial lineages provide strong
evidence for cryptic species diversity in western Palaearctic
bats. Sequence differences of at least 5% clearly fall into
the range of interspecific and even intergeneric differences
in bats and other mammals [21]. They are concordant
with genetic distances between recently discovered cryptic

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/4

species pairs in bats [15,22-25]. A comparison of interspecific genetic variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cob) between sister taxa in four mammalian orders including bats led to the conclusion that
sequence divergences of >5% are a powerful first indicator
for unrecognized cryptic species [21]. The two mitochondrial protein coding genes nd1 and cob are known to
evolve at a similar rate [16]. We thus applied a somehow
arbitrary species delineation threshold of 5% nd1
sequence divergence, which suggests nine new bat species
in the Western Palaearctic. This value drops to still six yet
new species, if a more conservative threshold of 9% is
applied. Both thresholds indicate at least three new species for Europe, one of them even occurring in central
Europe. The validity of these newly proposed bat species
will now be tested by analysing other characters like morphological, behavioural or ecological traits. However, the
mitochondrial sequences constitute a reliable sorting criterion to search for species-specific phenotypic traits.
Although sequencing of the mitochondrial nd1 gene
revealed evidence for substantial cryptic bat diversity in
Europe, it is likely that further species exist that are morphologically and genetically difficult to recognize. First,
mitochondrial lineages with less than 5% DNA sequence
divergence as found within the species Plecotus macrobullaris, Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Otonycteris hemprichii might
also represent distinct species [see Additional file 2]. Second, it is well known that DNA barcodes fail to distinguish recently diverged species [5]. A possible example are
specimens of Myotis mystacinus bulgaricus from southeastern Europe (Myotis aurascens sensu Benda and Tsytsulina
[26]) that differ from the nominate central European M.
mystacinus in the chromosomal locations of nucleolus
organizer regions [27] and in some morphological characters [26]. However, they show similar nd1 sequences that
do not split into two separate lineages. Therefore,
sequencing parts of the mitochondrial genome will
always provide only the lower limit of true species diversity.
Prior to the emergence of DNA sequencing in taxonomy
37 morphological defined vespertilionid bat species were
acknowledged for the Western Palaearctic realm. Now a
total of 51 species can be distinguished according to mitochondrial nd1 sequences (figure 2). However, neither the
morphological nor the genetic approach alone detected
all species. It is the combination of both that results in a
preliminary total of 54 species in the Western Palaearctic
(figure 2). This clearly shows the need for an integrative
taxonomy approach in which phenotypic and genetic data
are combined [28]. Only external morphological characters will enable rapid species identification in the field,
which is an essential requirement for behavioural, ecolog-

chosen at random. This resulted in a total of 217
sequences that were included in genetic distance calculations.

ical and evolutionary studies or conservation programs
(e.g. European Bat Agreement, EU Habitats Directive).
The raise in species number from 37 to 54 corresponds to
an increase by almost 50%. New species were discovered
in all major genera. Since Western Palaearctic bat species
are among the best-studied taxonomic groups in terms of
number of studied individuals, geographic coverage and
applied techniques, we anticipate an enormous rise in bat
species diversity in less studied areas like for example the
tropics.

Methods
Sampling
Morphological measurements and a wing tissue sample
with a diameter of 5 mm were taken from each individual
before it was released. Tissue samples were immediately
stored in 80% ethanol and kept at room temperature. The
number of specimens and geographic coverage varied
among taxa and ranged from one to 112 individuals [see
Additional file 1]. To avoid a bias due to unequal sampling intensity, we kept only five sequences per major
mitochondrial lineage. Sequences from different localities

Genetic analysis
We sequenced 900 bp of the mitochondrial gene nd1
(NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1) because a large data set
was already available and the nd1 gene in vespertilionid
bats evolves at a similar evolutionary rate as the mitochondrial protein coding gene cytb [16]. Unfortunately,
no data from bats were available for the mitochondrial
gene for cytochrome oxidase, subunit 1 (cox1), which is
commonly used in DNA barcoding. The protocols of DNA
isolation, amplification and sequencing were previously
published [15]. Sequence alignments were unequivocal.
We found neither insertions, deletions nor stop codons
that would have been expected for nuclear pseudogenes.
Sequence differences of all divergent lineages were confirmed by sequencing 550 base pairs of a second mitochondrial gene, the gene for 16S rRNA, which was
proposed as a standard DNA barcoding marker for vertebrates [29] [see Additional file 3]. Genetic distances
(uncorrected p and Kimura 2-parameter with a gamma
distribution shape parameter of 0.5) were calculated and
illustrated in a neighbor-joining tree by using the computer program PAUP* 4.0b10 [30]. In the text we always
refer to uncorrected p distances. All DNA sequences are
