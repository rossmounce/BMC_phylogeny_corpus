Abstract
Background: Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are widely used as experimental
animals in biomedical research and are closely related to other laboratory macaques, such as
rhesus macaques (M. mulatta). We isolated 85,721 clones and determined 9407 full-insert
sequences from cynomolgus monkey brain, testis, and liver. These sequences were annotated
based on homology to human genes and stored in a database, QFbase http://
genebank.nibio.go.jp/qfbase/.
Results: We found that 1024 transcripts did not represent any public human cDNA sequence
and examined their expression using M. fascicularis oligonucleotide microarrays. Significant
expression was detected for 544 (51%) of the unidentified transcripts. Moreover, we
identified 226 genes containing exon alterations in the untranslated regions of the macaque
transcripts, despite the highly conserved structure of the coding regions. Considering the
polymorphism in the common ancestor of cynomolgus and rhesus macaques and the rate of
PCR errors, the divergence time between the two species was estimated to be around 0.9
million years ago.
Conclusion: Transcript data from Old World monkeys provide a means not only to
determine the evolutionary difference between human and non-human primates but also to
unveil hidden transcripts in the human genome. Increasing the genomic resources and
information of macaque monkeys will greatly contribute to the development of evolutionary
biology and biomedical sciences.

Background
Genomic resources and information about primates are
valuable for evolutionary and biomedical studies to determine how and why phenotypes specific to humans, as
well as human diseases, have been formed. Moreover,
they are important for extrapolating the results of laboratory experiments to medical research because the physiology of primates is more similar to that of humans as
compared with other common experimental animals such
as rodents. The cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis), also known as the long-tailed or crab-eating macaque,
is an Old World monkey living in Southeast Asia. It is bred
in laboratories worldwide and is one of the most popular
primates used for laboratory animal studies, such as those
on infectious diseases, immunology, pharmacology, tissue engineering, gene therapy, senescence, and learning
[1]. Cynomolgus macaques, rhesus macaques (M.
mulatta), and Japanese macaques (M. fuscata) are widely
used for experimental studies and are closely related to
each other [2-4]. The US government funded genome
sequencing of the rhesus macaque because it is the most
common laboratory animal bred in the US, and in 2007,
the draft sequence of the rhesus macaque was published
[5].
Since cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys are very closely
related at the genetic level, we aim to determine the extent
to which the rhesus macaque genome sequence can be
used as a reference for biomedical studies involving
cynomolgus macaques. At the chromosomal level, a previous study suggested that a pericentric chromosome
inversion occurred in the cynomolgus lineage after splitting from rhesus macaques [6]. At the nucleotide
sequence level, the genetic divergence between cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys has been measured using mitochondrial DNA sequences [2,3] or a limited number of
loci on the chromosomes [4,7]. Thus, the divergence of a
sufficient number of loci between cynomolgus and rhesus
macaques would assist in determining the degree of
genetic divergence between them. In addition, recent
studies have shown that there is a considerable amount of
genetic diversity within the species themselves [5-10],
which also hampers the measurement of the genetic divergence. Because the divergence between the two macaques
is very recent (much later than the divergence between
humans and chimpanzees), we must consider the segregation of polymorphisms in the common ancestral population to estimate the correct species divergence time
[11,12]. By analyzing the number of loci in the two species, we can determine the history of divergence between
them, including the ancestral population size, divergence
time between species, and possible gene flow [13,14].
We have constructed full-length-enriched cDNA libraries
from cynomolgus monkey brain, testis, and liver using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/90

oligo-capping method. Many comparative genomics
projects have focused on sequencing of the genome or
expressed sequenced tags (ESTs), and full-length cDNA
sequences are uniquely informative resources for accurately predicting the full structure of transcripts in the
genome [15]. Furthermore, because cynomolgus and rhesus macaques are very closely related, transcriptome data
from cynomolgus macaques is useful for annotating the
genome sequence of other macaques whose transcriptome data is less than 1% of that from humans and whose
full-length cDNA data is scarce.
Along with the cynomolgus macaque cDNA sequencing
project, we have published a part of our results, such as
novel gene findings [16-19], search for fast-evolving genes
[19], molecular evolution of 5'-untranslated regions
(UTRs) [20], and evolution of brain-expressed genes [21].
In this study, we summarize the final sequencing project
and present novel findings with an expanded dataset. In
total, 85,721 ESTs and 9407 full-length sequences were
determined, annotated, and stored in an in-house database and the public databases (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank).
Our study focused on the divergence between the
cynomolgus and rhesus macaque genes. We did not intensively analyze the divergence between humans and
cynomolgus monkeys, because a study on rhesus genome
has investigated this thoroughly [5]; it also identified and
discussed positively selected genes or extensively duplicated genomic regions during the evolution of Catarrhine
primates.

Results
Summary of cDNA sequences
We constructed several oligo-capped cDNA libraries from
cynomolgus monkey testis, liver, and seven anatomical
parts of the brain (cerebellar cortex, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, medulla oblongata,
and brain stem). The oligo-capping method selectively
amplifies full-length cDNAs with a cap structure and
poly(A) tail [22]. We sequenced the 5'- or 3'-end of 85,721
clones, yielding 63,395 and 22,326 sequences of 5'- and
3'-ESTs, respectively, after filtering the vector and low
quality sequences. These EST sequences grouped into
16,466 clusters with 11,016 singletons (BLAST e-value:
1e-30). We classified them based on homology to the
26,575 non-redundant human RefSeq sequences (see
methods). Of the 85,721 EST sequences, 68,257 (80%)
were homologous to the human RefSeq gene set and were
clustered into 9065 types of genes, indicating that our EST
sequences would cover about 34% of the known human
transcripts (Table 1). In particular, when we limited the
human reference genes to the validated protein-coding
genes (i.e., RefSeq accession beginning with NM), 47% of
the human reference genes were represented in the
macaque cDNAs.

*Numbers of genes with the RefSeq homologs are shown in parentheses.

In parallel to EST sequencing, we determined about 9500
full-insert sequences of the cDNA clones. About 2500
clones whose 5'-EST sequences were not homologous to
the public cDNA sequences and 7000 clones whose 5'-EST
sequences were homologous to the human RefSeq
sequences were chosen [16-21]. Out of the 9407 fullinsert sequences, 7407 sequences were homologous to
5384 types of human genes (Table 1). The averaged length
of the full-insert sequences was 1864 bp, excluding the
length of the poly(A) tail. The macaque sequences were
annotated for gene function and homologous locus in the
human genome using information from the Entrez Gene
[23] and Gene Ontology (GO) databases [24].
Database construction
All cDNA sequences and annotations were deposited in
the public databases and stored in a simple in-house database, QFbase [25]. On the QFbase website, users can
search the macaque clones by keywords and BLAST
searches. For each human gene, the distribution of the
macaque homologs is represented graphically and users
can easily retrieve information of the objective macaque
cDNA clones. The entries are further linked to the gene
annotation in the outside databases, GenBank [26],
Ensembl [27], OMIM [28], and H-InvDB [29]. The cDNA
sequences were mapped on the human and rhesus
genome sequences using the UCSC genome browser [30].
Moreover, 4665 human-macaque orthologous alignments are provided in the QFbase. For each alignment, the
non-synonymous substitution rate (Ka) and the synonymous substitution rate (Ks) between the human and
macaque cDNA sequences were estimated. Non-synonymous substitutions are nucleotide changes that replace
amino acids between species whereas synonymous substitutions cause no amino acid changes. The relative pace of
protein evolution was thus determined using Ka/Ks,
assuming that the Ks value reflects the neutral mutation
rate [31]. Using the database, users can sort the align-

ments according to the Ka and Ks values. For example,
users can determine the Ka and Ks values of a particular
gene or view the list of the 100 most rapidly evolved genes
between humans and cynomolgus monkeys. The cDNA
clones are distributed through the Human Science
Research Resource Bank in Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Further
information is available at the QFbase website.
Analysis of unidentified transcripts
Of the 9407 full-sequenced cDNAs, about 2000 were not
homologous to the human reference gene sequences (RefSeq, built on Sep 14, 2006; BLAST: E = 1e-60). These NonRefSeq transcripts clustered into 1245 non-redundant
transcripts, which were further classified as shown in Figure 1. The list of the Non-RefSeq transcripts is provided in
Additional file 1. We filtered 11 junk sequences and 210
known transcripts. The 210 transcripts matched with the
unannotated human cDNA sequences in the database and
were called as orphan transcripts. These may help in further annotation of the human genome.

After removing the junk sequences and orphan transcripts, the remaining 1024 transcripts were referred as the
unidentified transcripts although 40% (406/1024) of the
transcripts showed homology to human ESTs (BLAST: E =
1e-60), because no full cDNA sequence of humans has
been registered in the public databases. One of the advantages of full-length cDNAs is that we can determine the
splicing pattern and reading direction of the transcripts in
the genome. We categorized the unidentified transcripts
as anti-transcript, intronic spliced transcript, intronic single-exon transcript, intergenic spliced transcript, or intergenic single-exon transcript. Among the intergenic
transcripts, 82 were located within 5 kb of the genic
regions with the same direction as the genes. Of these, 6
were mapped on the upstream regions and 76 were
mapped on the downstream regions of the known genes.
The result showed they may be hidden extensions of the

categorized as junk sequences. The remaining sequences were BLAST-searched against all public human cDNA sequences for
the forward strand. Homologous sequences to the unannotated human cDNAs were classified as orphan transcripts for the
forward strand and anti-transcript for the reverse strand. The remaining 947 clones were mapped on the human genome
sequence and arranged according to the annotation from the UCSC genome browser (hg18). The transcripts that overlapped
with the genic regions including UTR were classified as intronic transcripts, and the transcripts that were mapped more than 5
kb away from the genic region were classified as intergenic transcripts.

known transcripts, using alternative promoters and/or
poly(A) signals in the human genome. These sequences
were filtered from the intergenic transcripts and classified
as 'flanking' to genic regions. The largest group was the
intronic single-exon transcripts. Although they might be
acquired from premature mRNA molecules in the cell
nucleus, recent studies have revealed the potential abundance of short intronic transcripts in the human genome
[32]. Among these classes, anti-transcripts and intergenic
spliced transcripts are the most biologically relevant
classes, which are unlikely to be derived from contamination by premature mRNAs.
We designed oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix
GeneChip) containing probes complementary to the
known genes and unidentified transcripts. Hybridizations
were performed using the RNA sampled from a 3-year-old
macaque cerebrum, cerebellum, liver, and testis with
duplications. The significance of expression was determined using Affymetrix MAS5.0 software [33] (see methods). The proportion of the expressed transcripts is
presented in Figure 2. In the unidentified transcripts, 544
transcripts were expressed in at least one of the four tissues
(P < 0.05; Table 2). Because all the unidentified transcripts
were isolated from the macaque brain or testis, fewer transcripts were expressed in the liver (14%) than in the cerebrum (31%), cerebellum (41%), and testis (24%). The
expressed proportion of the unidentified transcripts was

significantly smaller than that of 8428 RefSeq homologs
(51% and 81%, respectively; P < 10-15; Fisher's exact test).
The orphan transcripts were expressed in an intermediate
proportion (72%). The percentages of the expressed unidentified transcripts ranged from 33% to 57% (Fig. 1). A
large difference was observed between the intergenic and
intronic transcripts; more intronic transcripts displayed
significant expression on the microarrays than intergenic
transcripts (P = 0.0005; Fisher's exact test).
Previous studies have shown that many unannotated transcripts are not conserved at a DNA sequence level in many
organisms [34]. In practice, sequence conservation is
determined by investigating whether the region is alignable. Here, we directly measure the difference in the DNA
sequences between humans and macaques. For proteincoding genes, previous studies have shown large disparities in sequence divergence between brain- and testisexpressed genes, both in the CDS and UTR, owing to the
stronger functional constraint on the brain-expressed
genes [20,21]. We further inquired whether the trend was
observed in the unidentified transcripts. We classified the
transcripts into brain-expressed transcripts (expressed in
the cerebrum and not in the testis) and testis-expressed
transcripts (expressed in the testis and not in the cerebrum). As shown in Figure 3, while the non-synonymous
substitution rates of the RefSeq homologs were higher in
the testis than in the brain, the DNA sequence divergence

of the unidentified transcripts was not associated with the
expression pattern. Furthermore, there was no evidence
that the unidentified transcripts were more conserved
than the synonymous sites of the RefSeq homologs.
We further evaluated the expression level of the 231 intergenic transcripts. We collected the strongest signal intensity of the significantly expressed intergenic transcripts. As
shown in Figure 4, even if they were significantly
expressed, signal intensities of the intergenic transcripts
were significantly weaker than those of the control genes
(P < 10-13; Wilcoxon test). Weak expression levels of
intergenic sequences have been previously reported
[35,36] and these may cause weak detection levels of the

intergenic transcripts. To test the reproducibility of the
microarray experiments using another method, we
selected eight intergenic spliced transcripts and tried to
amplify human and macaque transcripts using RT-PCR.
We designed the PCR primers that would match both
human and macaque sequences and would amplify
introns of genomic sequences when the genomic DNA is
contaminated. A gel picture of the RT-PCR products is
shown in Figure 5. Two transcripts showed positive
results, while six showed negative results on the microarray. We confirmed the expression of the two transcripts in
the macaque brain using both the microarray and RTPCR. Furthermore, even though we failed to detect the
expression of the six transcripts on the arrays, we recov-

ered the expression of the two transcripts by RT-PCR. In
these two transcripts, the expression levels detected by RTPCR resulted in considerably weaker bands on the gel
(Fig. 5), indicating that the microarray failed to capture
their expression at a very low level. In total, we detected
the expression of four transcripts in the macaque brain. Of
these four transcripts, two were not detected and one was
transcribed in an unspliced form in humans. The other
showed multiple extra bands in both humans and
macaques. Overall, the expression of the macaque intergenic spliced transcripts was not well conserved between
the human and the macaque brain.
Hidden transcript structures in the human genome
Of the 9407 macaque cDNA sequences, 2261 covered the
entire CDS of the human RefSeq genes in a single BLAST
hit chain. In the 2261 cDNAs, we sought a stretch of UTR
sequences (> 50 bp) that did not match any homologous
human cDNA sequence. Simple genomic insertion or
deletion in the genome was not counted. After filtering
the ambiguous entries, in the UTR of macaque cDNAs, we
found 262 exons that were not found in the human cDNA

data. Out of the 262 unidentified exons, 85 (32%) did not
match any human EST sequence. We classified the unidentified UTRs as follows: (A) extended exons and (B)
novel exons (Fig. 6). Those unidentified exons were further classified into internal and external exons (Fig. 6). As
shown in Figure 1, the distribution of the different types
of unidentified exons was not uniform; most of them
were external exons.
Because the human transcriptome data is more complex
than previously thought, as revealed by genome tiling
DNA microarrays [34-36], these unrepresented exons may
be expressed at a very low level in human tissues. Moreover, these exons have not been found in the conventional
cDNA exploration methods. However, previous studies
have suggested a frequent evolutionary turnover of exon
sequences [37]. The evolutionary alteration of external
exons in the 5'-UTR may be caused by the alternative
usage of promoter sequences [38]. The evolutionarily
altered exons in the 3'-UTR may be caused by the alternative usage of poly(A) adenylation signals [39]. All the unidentified exons are provided in Additional file 2.

Comparison of the human, cynomolgus, and rhesus genes
We compiled 2655 human-rhesus-cynomolgus cDNA
alignments (dataset I) using the rhesus macaque genome
and the predicted transcript sequences. The phylogenetic
relationship among the three species is shown in Figure 7.
Because the rhesus and cynomolgus genomes are very
similar, we wanted to minimize non-orthologous alignments, which inflate the average and variance of the
nucleotide divergence between them. Therefore, the
macaque genes showing > 80% homology to more than
one locus in the rhesus genome were filtered (dataset II).
Although the number of genes analyzed was reduced to
1499 in the second dataset, the subset of the genes would
be useful in estimating the divergence among the three
species. The results were obtained using dataset II in the
following manner. The results using the unfiltered dataset
(dataset I), which resulted in the inflation of variance, are
provided in Additional file 3. Genes that have evolved
under positive selection were searched with the modelbased likelihood ratio test [40]. In total, 39, 15, and 22
genes showed evidence of positive selection in the
human, cynomolgus, and rhesus lineages, respectively (P
< 0.05). Thirty-eight genes also showed a positive selection signature between the two macaques and 74 were
detected in all the three lineages (Table 3). Note that, in

Figure 7, the phylogenetic tree is unrooted. The list of positively selected genes is provided in Additional file 4.
Excluding the overlapped genes, we identified 101 out of
1499 genes (6.7%) that underwent positive selection in
any lineage at 5% significance level. The number of positively selected genes in each of the two macaque lineages
was comparable to that estimated in the human-chimpanzee lineages using the same method [41]. Although these
candidates of positively selected genes contain many biologically interesting functions, such as transcriptional regulation (RELA, ZNF263, and L3MBTL4), visual perception
(RGS9, GPRC5B, and RPGRIP1), and mitochondrial localization (PET112L,VARS,ACAA2,YARS2, FOXRED1, and
COQ9) [19], none of the GO categories were statistically
overrepresented probably because of the small sample
size.
Genetic divergence between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques
Using the above dataset, we estimated the nucleotide substitution rates of each lineage from the common ancestor
of cynomolgus and rhesus macaques (presented in Table
4). Numbers and rates of the non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions for each lineage were estimated
using the maximum likelihood method. We assumed that
synonymous substitutions are nearly neutral and used

them to estimate the divergence time. If we set the divergence of humans and Old World monkeys to 25–35 million years ago (Mya) [42], genes of the two macaques
would be considered to diverge 1.9–2.6 Mya on average.
However, since the two species diverged very recently, we
have to consider the ancestral polymorphisms segregating
at the time of speciation [11,12]. Figure 7 illustrates the
impact of the ancestral polymorphisms on the estimation
of the divergence time. Suppose that the common ancestor of two macaques had the same population size as the
population size of extant chimpanzees, i.e., 1–2 Mya to
the most recent common ancestor [43]. In this situation,
only one Mya divergence is assigned to the actual divergence time of the two species. Therefore, without considering ancestral polymorphisms, we tend to overestimate
the true species divergence. We applied the maximum
likelihood method to estimate the divergence time and
ancestral population size of the rhesus and cynomolgus

monkeys. As a result, we obtained 2tu = 0.00213 ±
0.00022 and 4Neu = 0.00327 ± 0.00025 where t, Ne, and
u represent the divergence time after speciation, ancestral
population size at speciation, and mutation rate with
standard errors, respectively. We also noticed that a nonnegligible number of nucleotide substitutions were erroneously assigned to the cynomolgus macaque lineage
owing to PCR errors in the cDNA libraries. Therefore, the
actual substitution rate was estimated by correcting the
PCR error using a computational method (see methods).
After the correction, we obtained 2tu = 0.00181 ± 0.00021
and 4Neu = 0.00311 ± 0.00024 (Table 4). If we consider u
= 10-9 (nucleotide substitution rate per year of Old World
monkeys [44]), the divergence time between the two
macaques would be estimated as 0.91 ± 0.11 Mya with a
standard error. We also estimated the ancestral population size to be 43,200 ± 3300 with a mutation rate per
generation of 1.8 × 10-8 in humans [45]. The result suggests that more than a half of the genetic divergence
between the two macaques is derived from the ancestral
polymorphisms.

Discussion
In summary, the sequencing project of cynomolgus monkey cDNAs yielded 85,721 ESTs and 9407 full-length
sequences. Since our project mainly studied the brain and
testis, the dataset is deficient in other tissue-specific genes,
e.g., the genes related to the immune system that many
medical researchers would want to explore [46]. The construction of cDNA libraries from other tissues and EST
sequencing is still ongoing to complement the transcriptome of cynomolgus monkeys. The latest sequencing status can be confirmed from the website. Because of the
close relationship between the cynomolgus and rhesus
macaques, cDNA resources of cynomolgus macaques not
only are useful for research using cynomolgus macaques
but also complement the relative paucity of the transcriptome data from rhesus macaques. Using macaque tissues
to scan the primate transcriptome is advantageous
because RNA molecules are unstable and are instantly
degraded in the tissues during sampling. This causes serious problems for RNA sampling from human tissues,
especially in the brain, where fresh samples are rarely
obtainable. Therefore, we hope to uncover rare transcripts

that would be hidden in the human transcriptome data.
In this study, we identified 1024 macaque cDNAs that
were not represented in the public human cDNA
sequences. Although 51% of the cDNA did not show a
positive signal on the microarrays, the following RT-PCR
experiments recovered the expression in half (3/6) of the
transcripts. The results indicate that these unidentified
transcripts were expressed at a low level in the tissues even
though the microarray could not detect the expression.
The M. fascicularis oligonucleotide microarrays contain
probes that matched 8316 known genes and 1024 unidentified transcripts. We determined the number of probe
sets for the known genes that overlapped among the commercially available microarray (Affymetrix GeneChip)
and previously published microarray of rhesus macaque
by Wallace et al., which contains the largest number of
probe sets among the published microarrays [47]. Of our
8316 probes for the known genes, 1728 (21%) were not
represented in the commercial microarray and 1091
(13%) were not found in the published microarray. Combining the three microarrays, 417 probes for the known
genes were represented only in the M. fascicularis microarrays [see Additional file 5]. In our preliminary study of the
polymorphisms within cynomolgus macaques, we found
that the level of polymorphisms in cynomolgus macaques
was greater than that in rhesus macaques and slightly
smaller than the level of divergence between rhesus and
cynomolgus macaques (Osada et al., unpublished data).
Therefore, even if we should be careful about sequence
mismatches within and between species, the information
from both macaque transcripts and the rhesus genome
can be combined to build more versatile and comprehensive DNA microarrays that can be used for biomedical surveys using laboratory macaques.
Suppose that we identify positively selected genes in the
human lineage after the spilt from chimpanzees. Such
genes are useful for understanding the human-specific
physiology only when those genes have not been under

positive selection in other primate lineages. We identified
37 genes under positive selection between the two
macaques at 5% significance level. None of these genes
were shared with 387 genes under positive selection in the
human or chimpanzee lineages previously determined
from the whole genome scan [41], providing support that
the method has correctly identified positively selected
genes in the specific lineages.
For estimating of the divergence time between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, we assumed that there is no
gene flow between the ancestral species throughout their
speciation and divergence time (i.e., allopatric model).
However, considering the ancestral polymorphisms and
the PCR error rate, we estimated the divergence time to be
around 0.9 Mya, which is less than the estimation of the
age of MRCA of rhesus macaques [10]. Indeed, more than
half of the genetic divergence between the two macaques
was derived from ancestral polymorphisms. If continuous
gene flow is present during speciation, the variance component would be inflated and we would tend to overestimate the amount of ancestral polymorphisms [14].
In this analysis, we used the rhesus macaque genome
sequence to represent rhesus macaques. We should note
that the rhesus macaque used for genome sequencing was
an Indian rhesus macaque; these macaques have genetically differentiated from Chinese rhesus macaques [9]. In
addition, our samples of cynomolgus macaques were
obtained from different geographic subpopulations. Previous studies using mitochondrial DNA sequences [10]
and our preliminary analysis using nuclear DNA
sequences (Osada et al., unpublished data) showed that
there is a substantial genetic divergence between
cynomolgus monkeys of Sundaland (Indonesia and Indochina) and Philippine populations. Therefore, our phylogenetic inference using two sampled sequences has a
technical limitation and may be accurate only if there are
no complex population structures among the ancestral
cynomolgus and rhesus macaque populations. Elucidat-

ing the polymorphisms and divergence among macaque
species would provide further insight into the evolutionary history of macaques and benefit biomedical research
using macaque monkeys.
In Table 4, without correcting the PCR error rate, both the
non-synonymous and synonymous divergences are
greater in the cynomolgus lineage. This may be due to
shorter generation time and smaller population size of
cynomolgus monkeys. However, a more reasonable
explanation is that the cDNA sequences of cynomolgus
monkeys might incorporate the errors resulting from PCR
amplification during the construction of the oligo-capped
cDNA libraries. The synonymous substitution rate in the
cynomolgus lineage is about 0.0005 points higher than
that in the rhesus lineage, and the non-synonymous substitution rate differs in about 0.0004 points. Assuming
that the selective constraint and generation time of the
two macaque lineages are the same, excess divergence of
0.04%-0.05% in the cynomolgus lineage may be an artifact introduced by PCR amplification, which is fairly close
to the estimation from the experiment by Suzuki and Sugano [48]. If we reflect the substitution rate in the rhesus
lineage to that in the cynomolgus lineage for correcting
the errors, the total divergence of the two macaques will
be reduced to about 90% (Table 4).

Conclusion
Transcript data from Old World monkeys provide us with
means to determine not only the evolutionary difference
between human and non-human primates but also the
hidden transcripts in the human genome. Actual cDNA
clones of macaques are also indispensable resources for
genetic engineering studies. It is considered that the species divergence between rhesus and cynomolgus
macaques would be much later than the previous estimates, and the speciation process between them might
have been complex. To use laboratory macaques more
efficiently, we need to be more aware of the genetic difference within and among macaque monkeys. Increasing the
genomic resources and information of macaque monkeys
will greatly contribute to the development of evolutionary
biology and biomedical sciences.

Methods
Cynomolgus monkey samples
Samples from two cynomolgus monkeys, a 16-year-old
female (Philippine origin) and a 15-year-old male (Cambodian-Thai hybrid), were used for the cDNA libraries,
except for the liver cDNA library (Qlv). The liver samples
were collected from three adult cynomolgus monkeys of
unknown origin. The monkeys were cared for and handled according to the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National
Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) of Japan and the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/90

standard operating procedures for monkeys at the Tsukuba Primate Center, NIID (present National Institute of
Biomedical Innovation), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. Tissues
were excised in accordance with all the guidelines in the
Laboratory Biosafety Manual, World Health Organization, at the P3 facility for monkeys of the Tsukuba Primate
Center. Immediately after collection, the tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for RNA extraction. Oligocapped cDNA libraries were constructed according to the
method described previously [48]. The prefix in each
clone name represents the location of the source of the tissue: Qnp (brain, parietal lobe), Qfl (brain, frontal lobe),
Qtr (brain, temporal lobe), Qor (brain, occipital lobe),
Qbs (brain stem), Qmo (medulla oblongata), Qcc (cerebellar cortex), Qlv (liver), and Qts (testis).
Sequencing of cDNA clones
The cDNA clones were sequenced with ABI 3700 and
3730 automated sequencers. The EST sequences were
trimmed to avoid the vector sequence of pME18-FL3
[DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank: AB009864]. Entire sequences of
the clones were determined by the primer walking
method. The repeat sequences at the 5'- and 3'-ends were
masked using the Repbase Update database [49] before
BLAST search. The BLAST search was performed with an e60 cut-off value against non-redundant human RefSeq
data. The non-redundant data was based on the annotation in the Ensembl Gene database. The longest transcript
in the locus was selected as the representative cDNA
[24,50]. The macaque cDNA sequences were deposited in
the public DNA databases [DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank:
CJ430287–CJ493524;
BB873801–BB894695;
AB303966–AB303967].
Classification of unidentified transcripts
Classification of the Non-RefSeq transcripts was performed as shown in Figure 1. Transcripts shorter than 300
bp after masking the repetitive sequences were categorized
as junk sequences. The remaining sequences were BLASTsearched against all public human cDNA sequences
(downloaded on Aug 3, 2007) for the forward strand.
Homologous sequences to the human cDNAs were classified as orphan transcripts for the forward strand and antitranscript for the reverse strand. The remaining 947 clones
were mapped on the human genome sequence (build
36.1) by BLAST algorithm and arranged according to the
annotation from the UCSC genome browser (hg18). The
transcripts that overlapped with the genic regions including UTR were classified as intronic transcripts, and the
transcripts that were mapped more than 5 kb away from
the genic region were classified as intergenic transcripts.
Expression assays
Affymetrix GeneChip was designed using the available
cDNA sequences of M. fascicularis. The chip loads 10,307

probe sets. RNA samples from the cerebrum, cerebellum,
liver, and testis of a 3-year-old male cynomolgus monkey
were extracted using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) and hybridized
to the GeneChip with duplication in a single experiment.
The M. fascicularis GeneChip contains at most 11 perfectmatch probes (25-mers complete matches to the cDNA
sequences) and 11 mismatch probes (containing one mismatched oligo) for each probe set, similar to other GeneChip formats. Normalization, signal detection, and signal
intensity calculation of the microarrays were performed
using Affymetrix MAS5.0 software. Transcripts were considered as expressed when the probe set of both the duplicates agreed for the significant expression (P ≤ 0.05) [33].
The raw array data were deposited in Gene Expression
Omnibus [GEO: GSM201873–201880]. The array design
and the sequences of oligonucleotide probes were deposited in the public database [GEO: GPL5396].
RT-PCR
Templates of the human brain RNA were purchased from
Clontech. The macaque brain RNA was obtained from a
21-year-old male cynomolgus monkey. One microgram
of total mRNA was amplified using the PrimeSTAR® RTPCR Kit (TakaraBio). The temperature and time schedules
were 30 cycles at 94°C for 20 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C
for 1 min. All primer sequences are presented in Additional file 6.
Human-cynomolgus cDNA sequence alignment
Human-macaque orthologous gene pairs were assigned
by the reciprocal best BLAST hit with an e-60 cut-off value.
We aligned only that part of the coding sequences (CDS)
that was homologous to a BLAST search, because representative human and macaque cDNAs do not necessarily
have the same splicing isoforms. The sequences of human
and macaque cDNAs were aligned using CLUSTAL W
[51], and an unaligned macaque nucleotide was marked
by the letter X in the database. Alignments shorter than
100 bp (≤ 33 codons) were filtered for further analysis. In
the database, the positions including deletion in the
human sequence (or insertion in the macaque sequence)
were dropped for estimating the substitution rates. The
non-synonymous substitution rate per non-synonymous
site (Ka) and the synonymous substitution rate per synonymous site (Ks) were estimated using the Li-PamiloBianchi method [52,53]. Ka/Ks ratios were set to 100 in
the database when the Ks value was zero.
Human-rhesus-cynomolgus cDNA sequence alignment
The predicted cDNA sequences of rhesus macaques were
downloaded from Ensembl (MMUL1.0) and aligned with
the human RefSeq sequences. Orthology between the rhesus and cynomolgus genes was confirmed again using the
cynomolgus-rhesus reciprocal BLAST hit, and human-rhesus-cynomolgus cDNA alignments were compiled. Align-

ments containing any frameshifting indels and those
shorter than 100 bp (≤ 33 codons) were filtered, which
resulted in 2655 alignments (dataset I). The rhesus cDNA
sequences were then mapped on the draft genome
sequence of the rhesus macaque (rheMac2). The rhesus
macaque genes showing > 80% homology to more than
one locus on the rhesus genome were removed from the
alignments, which yielded 1499 human-rhesus-cynomolgus cDNA alignments (dataset II). To estimate the divergence among the three species, Ka(dn) and Ks(ds) were
estimated using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the PAML program package [54]. We estimated
the transition/transversion ratios in 4-fold degenerated
sites using the concatenated cynomolgus and rhesus
alignments in advance, and fixed the value to the observed
value. The test of positive selection was conducted using
the branch-site test of positive selection described by
Zhang et al. [41], applying the critical values of 2.71 and
5.41 at 5% and 1% significance level without a Bonferroni
correction, respectively.
Estimation of the divergence time between cynomolgus and
rhesus macaques
Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the divergence
time and ancestral population size was performed using
the method of Takahata and Satta [11,14]. MLE was determined using the Newton-Raphson algorithm with many
possible initial values. The standard error was determined
from the numerically evaluated Fisher information
matrix. In order to correct a PCR error rate, we estimated
the PCR error rate to be 5.40 × 10-4, which was derived
from the difference in the synonymous substitution rates
of the cynomolgus and rhesus lineages. We assumed that
the generation time and the effect of selection on the synonymous sites of the two macaques were the same, and
that the erroneous nucleotide incorporated by PCR did
not skew. Therefore, when a synonymous substitution in
the cynomolgus lineage was found, it was considered that
the substitution is because of the PCR error with a probability of 0.178 (5.40 × 10-4/3.04 × 10-3). We randomly
corrected the number of substitutions in the raw data,
generated pseudo data for 1000 times, and estimated the
evolutionary parameter for each time.
