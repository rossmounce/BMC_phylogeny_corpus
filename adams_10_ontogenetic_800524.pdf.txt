morphology in European cave salamanders
(Family: Plethodontidae)

Abstract
Background: A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the evolution of phenotypic diversity. Both natural
and sexual selection play a large role in generating phenotypic adaptations, with biomechanical requirements and
developmental mechanisms mediating patterns of phenotypic evolution. For many traits, the relative importance of
selective and developmental components remains understudied.
Results: We investigated ontogenetic trajectories of foot morphology in the eight species of European plethodontid
cave salamander to test the hypothesis that adult foot morphology was adapted for climbing. Using geometric
morphometrics and other approaches, we found that developmental patterns in five species displayed little
morphological change during growth (isometry), where the extensive interdigital webbing in adults was best
explained as the retention of the juvenile morphological state. By contrast, three species exhibited significant
allometry, with an increase in interdigital webbing during growth. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that multiple
evolutionary transitions between isometry and allometry of foot webbing have occurred in this lineage. Allometric
parameters of foot growth were most similar to those of a tropical species previously shown to be adapted for
climbing. Finally, interspecific variation in adult foot morphology was significantly reduced as compared to variation
among juveniles, indicating that ontogenetic convergence had resulted in a common adult foot morphology across
species.
Conclusions: The results presented here provide evidence of a complex history of phenotypic evolution in this clade.
The common adult phenotype exhibited among species reveals that selection plays an important part in generating
patterns of foot diversity in the group. However, developmental trajectories arriving at this common morphology are
distinct; with some species displaying developmental stasis (isometry), while others show an increase in foot webbing
during growth. Thus, multiple developmental solutions exist to the same evolutionary challenge. Our findings
underscore the importance of examining morphological adaptations from multiple perspectives, and emphasize that
both selective hypotheses and developmental processes must be considered for a more comprehensive
understanding of phenotypic evolution.
Background
How can we explain the extent of phenotypic diversity
observed in nature? Since Darwin, a myriad of studies
have proposed adaptive explanations for phenotypic variation, and have focused on the role of natural and sexual
selection in shaping patterns of diversification. For
instance, divergent selection often generates discontinui* Correspondence: dcadams@iastate.edu

ties among populations and species, enhancing adaptive
differences through time [1-4]. Additionally, common
selective pressures found in distinct locations can generate similar patterns of morphological evolution among
unrelated groups, resulting in evolutionary convergence
[5-8] or parallelism [9-12]. These examples, and many
others, provide strong evidence of adaptation, and speak
to the power of selection in directing morphological
change [13].

adaptive and molded by natural selection, several addi-

tional mechanisms play important roles in influencing
and constraining morphological change [14,15]. For
example, functional and biomechanical requirements can
restrict the evolutionary response to selection, particularly when competing functional demands on the same
trait cannot be simultaneously optimized [16,17]. Likewise, patterns of genetic covariance [18-20] and underlying developmental pathways [21,22] can alter both the
direction and extent of morphological change, and influence the degree to which selection can operate. Such
structural mechanisms commonly interact with selection
to shape the course of evolution, and while phenotypic
traits are often portrayed as being the result of either
selection or constraints, a full appreciation of the evolutionary process requires understanding the contributions
of both components [23].
In some instances, the mechanisms responsible for the
evolution of phenotypic traits commonly considered to
be adaptive are more intricate than was previously
believed. For example, many tropical plethodontid salamanders are arboreal [24,25], and as adults, have extensive webbing on their hands and feet. Because this
interdigital webbing has evolved repeatedly in the group,
it was long hypothesized that this derived trait was an
adaptation to their arboreal habit [24,26]. Indeed, an
ontogenetic analysis revealed that webbed and nonwebbed Bolitoglossa species diverge in their developmental trajectories, with webbed species maintaining a high
degree of webbing throughout growth (paedomorphosis),
while non-webbed species attained less webbing as adults
[27]. Interestingly however, an analysis using a biomechanical model for foot growth [26] revealed that webbed
and non-webbed species shared a common pattern of
increased foot area relative to body size. Thus, it was concluded that foot webbing was not an adaptation for
climbing in these species [27], as the high-degree of webbing did not result in increased foot area in the webbed
species (the critical parameter for successful climbing:
see [26]). Only a single webbed species (the cave-dwelling
Chiropterotriton magnipes) had a growth trajectory
where foot area increased relative to body size in a manner consistent with adaptation. This example demonstrates the importance of considering both selective and
structural mechanisms when assessing patterns of morphological change.
The European plethodontid salamanders provide an
interesting opportunity to examine the relative influence
of selection and development on patterns of morphological evolution. These species are part of a larger clade
(Hydromantes) inhabiting North America and Europe
[28,29]. The eight European species diverged from their
North American counterparts during the Eocene [29-31],
and based on their disjunct distribution and their monophyly, some refer to the European lineage as a separate

Page 2 of 10

genus, Speleomantes [31,32] [some authors have placed
species of Hydromantes in one of several subgenera
[28,33]; here we refer to all European species as Hydromantes (Speleomantes)]. European Hydromantes are
direct-developing amphibians (i.e. they display no larval
stage), and frequently inhabit caves and crevices, where
they can be found climbing the walls and ceilings
[30,34,35]. In more terrestrial environments, they often
cling to rock faces, walls, and trees [31,36-38]. As adults,
these species display considerable webbing on their hands
and feet, a morphological trait believed to be an adaptation for climbing [31,34]. However, the degree of foot
webbing has not been examined throughout the course of
development in these species. Thus, it remains unknown
whether patterns of foot webbing in adults are the result
of adaptation, as the hypothesis has not been formally
tested. The purpose of this paper is to explore the ontogenetic trajectories of foot morphology in European Hydromantes to determine what forces may have shaped
patterns of morphological evolution. Specifically, we test
the hypothesis that adult foot morphology represents an
adaptive condition, as previously proposed [31,34]. We
also examine ontogenetic patterns in light of the phylogenetic history of the group, to examine the extent to which
developmental processes influence patterns of adult foot
morphology [28].

Results
We quantified foot morphology from juvenile and adult
specimens of all eight species of European Hydromantes
native to continental Italy and Sardinia (Figure 1A; species listed in Figure legend). Foot morphology was characterized using a variety of measures (Figure 1B),
including sinuosity (a measure of the degree of interdigital webbing [27]), and foot shape derived from a set of
nine landmarks and geometric morphometric methods
[39-41]. The five species inhabiting Sardinia attain a
larger body size and larger foot size than do species from
continental Italy. Despite this, we found that adults of all
species attain similar and relatively low values of sinuosity ( X range = 2.38 to 2.73), implying that they display a
high degree of interdigital webbing. Surprisingly however, when examined over the course of development, we
found very different ontogenetic patterns among species.
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that
developmental trajectories differed among species (Table
A1A), with most species displaying no change in foot
webbing through ontogeny (Table 2). Thus, these species
are best described as isometric, as their adult morphology was similar to that observed in juveniles. In stark
contrast, three of the species from Sardinia (H. (S.) flavus,
H. (S.) sarrabusensis, and H. (S.) supramontis) exhibited
significant allometry, where the degree of interdigital

webbing increased as animals grew larger (Table 2; Figure
2A, B). A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) of foot shape also revealed species-specific allometric trajectories (Table B1B), consistent with the
observations of foot webbing. As with the degree of foot
webbing, most species displayed little change in foot
shape with changes in size, again implying that adult
morphology in these species was similar to that seen in
juveniles. By contrast, the same three species from Sardinia exhibited considerable changes in foot shape across
their ontogenetic trajectories (Figure 2C, D). For these
species, adults have relatively wider feet with increased
foot webbing, while juveniles have relatively narrower
feet and less interdigital webbing (Figure 3).
To better understand the evolution of these ontogenetic
trajectories we used a recently published molecular phylogeny [28] and maximum likelihood ancestral character
state reconstruction [42]. We found that isometry was the
most likely ancestral condition for the European lineage,
with a single evolutionary transition to an allometric
growth pattern at the base of a clade containing four of
the Sardinian species (Figure 4). However, one of these

species, H. (S.) imperialis, displayed isometric foot
growth, so an evolutionary reversal to isometry must also
be proposed. Interestingly, the growth trajectory of one of
the three North American species (H. platycephalus) has
also been examined (M. Jaekel, pers. comm.), and this
species exhibits allometric growth similar to that
observed in the three Sardinian species. When H.
platycephalus was included in the analysis, the patterns
described above remained unchanged, but the ancestral
condition for the entire genus was hypothesized to be
allometric. This result implied that an evolutionary
change to isometry occurred at the base of the lineage of
European species (though if the remaining North American species also display variation in their growth patterns, the ancestral condition for Hydromantes would be
harder to determine). Together, these analyses reveal that
ontogenetic trajectories in Hydromantes are evolutionarily labile, with transitions between allometry and isometry occurring repeatedly within the lineage.
One striking feature of the observed interspecific ontogenetic trends was the fact that adults across species
appeared more similar to one another than did juveniles

by a factor of two to facilitate visual interpretation.

(Figure 2). We performed a formal test of this observation, and found that the variation in the degree of interdigital webbing was significantly smaller in adults than it
was in juveniles ( Djuv - Dadult = 3.3302; Prand = 0.0002). A
similar finding was also obtained for variation in foot
shape ( Djuv - Dadult = 0.8362; Prand = 0.0001). These
results revealed that foot morphology among species was
more similar in adults than it was among juveniles.
Therefore, in contrast to tropical plethodontids whose
differing growth trajectories resulted in divergent adult
foot morphologies, the ontogenetic trajectories of European Hydromantes have converged on a common adult
phenotype.
Finally, we examined allometric parameters of foot
growth relative to a biomechanical model [26,27] to
determine whether foot growth was adapted for climbing
(see [27]). We found that foot growth parameters in the

European plethodontid salamanders (α = 0.75, b = 0.14)
were most similar to those of a tropical cave dwelling salamander, Chiropterotriton magnipes [27]. Interestingly, in
a recent study of tropical plethodontids with extensive
foot webbling, C. magnipes was the only species whose
pattern of foot growth was adapted for climbing [27].
Thus, when compared to the growth parameters for this
species, our findings suggest that patterns of foot growth
in some European Hydromantes may also be adapted for
climbing.

Discussion
Understanding the evolution of morphological diversity
requires a pluralistic approach, where both selective and
structural mechanisms are investigated. In this study, we
examined developmental trajectories of foot morphology
in European plethodontid salamanders to determine
what forces may have shaped patterns of morphological
variation, and to test the hypothesis that adult foot morphology was an adaptation for climbing. Our results provide evidence that both selection and development
influence patterns of foot morphology, implying a complex history of morphological evolution in the group.
First, our morphological analyses identified speciesspecific developmental trajectories of foot growth. Statistical models describing variation in foot morphology
revealed a significant Species × Size interaction term
(Table 1), indicating that patterns of foot growth were not
consistent across all species of European Hydromantes.
Upon further examination of these patterns (Table 2; Figure 2), we found that the species-specific patterns could
be classified into two general categories. For most species
of European Hydromantes, there was little change in the
degree of foot webbing during growth, as both juveniles
and adults displayed extensive foot webbing. Similar patterns were found in many tropical plethodontid species
[27], which also displayed a high degree of interdigital
webbing as adults. Thus, viewing our findings in light of
previous results suggests that for these species of European Hydromantes, the extensive foot webbing observed
in adults can be described as resulting from isometry
during development (see discussion in [27]).
The remaining three species in our study displayed significant foot allometry, where the degree of interdigital
webbing increased during growth (Table 2; Figure 2, Figure 3). This ontogenetic pattern may be expected under
an adaptive scenario, given that a biomechanical model
established that a greater degree of webbing and foot surface area is required for successful climbing as salamanders grow larger [26]. This hypothesis is further
supported by the fact that for our species, the growth
parameters of foot area relative to body size were most
similar to those found in a tropical cave dwelling salamander (C. magnipes), whose foot growth was previously

Adams and Nistri BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:216
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/216

determined to be adapted for climbing [27]. These findings therefore provide some support for the hypothesis
that foot morphology in the allometric European
plethodontids is adaptive [31,34], and is, at least in part, a
response to natural selection.
Surprisingly, despite the distinct ontogenetic trajectories in foot development observed in this lineage, patterns of adult foot morphology were strikingly similar
among species. A formal test of this observation revealed
that variation in adult foot morphology was significantly
smaller than variation in juvenile foot morphology,
implying that a common adult phenotype exists among
species, despite large differences in their developmental
trajectories. Such ontogenetic convergence was unexpected, as a study of tropical plethodontids found that
different growth trajectories resulted in divergent adult
foot morphologies among species [27]. Further, this ontogenetic convergence among species of European Hydromantes suggests that adult foot morphology may be more
functionally constrained than that of juveniles, a hypothesis that was previously suggested for these species [34].
It also suggests that those species displaying allometric
foot growth have overcome their initial unwebbed juvenile state via an evolutionary shift in their developmental
trajectory, which results in an adult morphology with
more extensive foot webbing. Indeed, functional experiments have shown that the ability of plethodontids to
adhere to vertical surfaces is facilitated by increased foot
surface area and increased webbing, particularly as animals grow larger [26]. Further, a biomechanical model
demonstrated that clinging to vertical surfaces becomes
more difficult as animals increase in size [26,27]. Based
on these observations, it is reasonable to suggest that
selection for climbing is more intense in adult European
Hydromantes than it is in juveniles, and our observations
of ontogenetic convergence are consistent with this interpretation.
When viewing these patterns in light of phylogeny, we
found that ontogenetic growth trajectories were not
static, and that multiple transitions between allometric
and isometric growth had occurred during the evolutionary history of the group. This result implied that some
degree of flexibility exists in the developmental program
of these species, and that their ontogenetic trajectories
are evolutionarily labile. However, all instances of allometry in this lineage followed a similar developmental trajectory, with an increase in foot webbing during growth.
While the opposite pattern of decreased foot webbing
during growth has been found in other plethodontids
[27], this pattern was not observed in European Hydromantes. We hypothesize that this differences stems from
the functional requirements for climbing. Our results
suggest that there is a minimal degree of foot webbing
(and thus foot area) required for European Hydromantes

Page 7 of 10

to climb successfully, and that this limit is more extreme
for larger animals (see also [26,27]). The fact that different species arrive at a common adult phenotype from different juvenile morphologies lends further support to this
hypothesis. Interestingly, the three species displaying
allometric foot growth (H. (S.) flavus, H. (S.) sarrabusensis, and H. (S.) supramontis) are all geographically
restricted species, and are found in more arid and rocky
environments with a narrower range of available habitats
as compared to the remaining species in the group (C.
Corti, pers. comm.; A. Nistri, unpubl. data). Thus, selection on particular morphological traits may be accentuated in these species at all developmental stages due to
their environmental condition. To date however, no
quantitative, comparative, ecological studies have been
performed of these species, which would provide critical
evidence to test this hypothesis. Regardless, if this
hypothesis is correct, it conforms with the previous suggestion that selection plays a role in shaping patterns of
foot morphology in these salamanders [31,34]. The evolutionary changes seen in ontogenetic trajectories across
the phylogeny for the group may therefore reflect the
complex interplay between developmental processes on
the one hand, and selective pressures that are more
intense at a single developmental stage (adults).
Finally, we note that our findings differ from those of
previous studies [27] in one important respect. In tropical
Bolitoglossa, paedomorphic (isometric) and allometric
trajectories diverge during growth to generate distinct
adult phenotypes (webbed and unwebbed adults respectfully: [27]), while in European Hydromantes, isometric
and allometric growth trajectories converge on a common adult morphology with extensive foot webbing. This
distinct pattern of interspecific convergence provides
strong evidence of selection on adult foot morphology in
European Hydromantes, and raises a number of interesting evolutionary questions for future work. For instance,
because both juveniles and adults of all European Hydromantes climb successfully, and are found in similar habitats, it is of interest to determine whether the juveniles of
isometric species are 'over-engineered' for climbing, or
whether there is a cost to having more extensive foot
webbing as compared to juveniles of other European
Hydromantes species. In addition, the fact that ontogenetic patterns of foot growth are so evolutionarily labile
in Hydromantes begs the question of what may be
responsible for such lability, and how the genetic underpinnings of these traits affect the ontogenetic patterns.
When viewed in light of the biogeography of the species,
our patterns imply that perhaps the evolutionary changes
in ontogenetic trajectories are associated with specific
distributional changes of the species, such as founder
events or the colonization of new habitats. Finally, the
fact that both isometric and allometric growth patterns

Adams and Nistri BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:216
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/216

converge on a common (selectively advantageous) foot
morphology implies that both developmental trajectories
may be selectively beneficial, and suggests that in this
instance, multiple developmental solutions exist to the
same evolutionary challenge.

Conclusions
This study characterized ontogenetic trajectories of foot
morphology in all eight species of European plethodontid
cave salamanders to test the hypothesis that adult foot
morphology was an adaptation for climbing. We showed
that five of the eight species displayed little change in foot
morphology during growth (isometry), while the remaining species showed an increase in foot webbing as animals grew larger. Despite these different developmental
trajectories however, we also showed that adult foot morphology converged on a common phenotype across species, suggesting that functional demands for vertical
climbing are more intense in adults than in juveniles. We
further showed that growth patterns were consistent with
selection for improved climbing. The findings presented
here demonstrate that both selection and developmental
processes have influenced phenotypic evolution in this
group.
Methods
A total of 330 salamander specimens from the collections
of the Museo di Storia Naturale (Sezione di Zoologia),
Universitá di Firenze (MZUF) were used in this study
(mean = 41; range = 24 - 54). To capture ontogenetic
information, we included a wide size range of juveniles
and adults for each species (these species are directdevelopers with no larval stage). Only specimens from a
single geographic locality per species were utilized to
minimize among-locality variability. We characterized
foot morphology using several different quantitative
measures. All measurements were taken from the right
foot of each specimen (with the exception of a few specimens whose right foot was poorly preserved). First, we
used a sinuosity measure, which quantified the degree of
interdigital webbing for each individual [27]. Here the
perimeter of the distal portion of the foot was measured
as the outline from the tip of digit one to digit five, and
sinuosity was measured as the ratio of this perimeter relative to the width of the foot (p/d: Figure 1B). Sinuosity
decreases as the degree of interdigital webbing increases.
Second, we quantified foot shape using geometric morphometric methods [39-41]. These methods quantify the
shape of anatomical objects from the coordinates of
repeatable locations, after non-shape variation has been
mathematically held constant (e.g., [9,43,44]). For this
approach, the locations of nine anatomical landmarks
were recorded from the foot of each specimen (points 19: Figure1B). Landmark configurations for each specimen

Page 8 of 10

were then optimally aligned using a generalized Procrustes superimposition [45], and from the aligned specimens, Procrustes tangent coordinates were used as a set
of shape variables for all multivariate analyses. The centroid size for each foot was also retained for further analysis. Finally, we measured total foot area for each
specimen (A: Figure 1B), as well as the body weight for
those specimens that were fully intact (some specimens
could not be weighed because some limbs had been previously removed for other investigations, or because they
were overly dry due to preservation).
We performed a number of statistical analyses to examine the ontogeny of foot morphology. First we used an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare allometric
trends in foot webbing across species, using species, foot
width, and their interaction as model effects. We also
conducted linear regressions of the degree of foot webbing versus foot width for each species separately. Next,
we performed a multivariate analysis of covariance
(MANCOVA) to compare allometric trends in foot
shape, using species, centroid size, and their interaction
as model effects. Multivariate patterns of ontogenetic
change were visualized using scores from a multivariate
regression of foot shape versus log(Centroid Size) [46],
and thin-plate spline deformation grids [47] were used to
facilitate biological interpretation of allometric changes
in foot shape. Plots of predicted values from species-specific multivariate regressions were also generated to facilitate species-level comparisons.
To determine whether ontogenetic trajectories in foot
morphology converged on similar adult morphologies,
we performed a permutation procedure that compared
variation in juveniles to variation in adults among species. With this approach, predicted morphologies along
each species' ontogenetic trajectory were estimated for all
specimens, and the predicted morphologies for the smallest and largest observed specimen in each species were
obtained. Next, the Euclidean distances between all pairs
of small specimens and between all pairs of large specimens were calculated. These distances were then
summed, and the test statistic ( Djuv - Dadult) was calculated. A positive test statistic implied that adults were
more similar to one another than were juveniles, while a
negative test statistic implied that juveniles were more
similar to one another than were adults. Finally, the
observed test statistic was compared to a distribution of
possible values obtained through permutation. Here, the
predicted morphologies for all individuals were randomized with respect to their size, new predicted morphologies at small and large values were obtained, and a new
test value was calculated. The proportion of randomly
generated test values (of 9,999) larger or equal to the
observed was taken as the significance level (for a related

Evolutionary transitions in ontogenetic growth were
estimated using maximum likelihood ancestral state
reconstruction [42]. A recent molecular phylogeny [28],
containing all eleven species of Hydromantes and several
additional taxa was used in these analyses. First we
pruned the phylogeny so that a single population per
European Hydromantes species was retained (populations corresponded geographically to those locations
from which we obtained our morphological data). We
then coded each ontogenetic trajectory as 'allometric' or
'isometric', based on whether or not the species-specific
regression of sinuosity versus foot length was significant.
We then used discrete-based maximum likelihood [42] to
estimate ancestral states for each internal node of the
tree.
Finally, we quantified allometric patterns of foot growth
to determine whether they conformed to adaptive expectations based on a prior biomechanical model [26,27].
Here, total foot area (A) was modeled as a function of
body weight (W) using the allometric equation: A = bWα.
From this the allometric growth parameters (α and b)
were obtained, where b represents the intercept and α is
the relative growth parameter. These were then compared to values previously identified for other plethodontid salamanders [27]. Prior work had shown that one
tropical species, the cave-dwelling C. magnipes, exhibited
foot morphology adapted for climbing and clinging to
vertical surfaces, while other tropical, arboreal species
(genus Bolitoglossa) did not display adaptive patterns. We
therefore compared parameters for European Hydromantes to these species, to determine which species more
closely matched the observed foot ontogeny in this group.
All statistical analyses were performed in R 2.10.1 [51].
