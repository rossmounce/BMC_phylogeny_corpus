Abstract
Background: Tanabin, transitin and nestin are type VI intermediate filament (IF) proteins that are
developmentally regulated in frogs, birds and mammals, respectively. Tanabin is expressed in the
growth cones of embryonic vertebrate neurons, whereas transitin and nestin are found in myogenic
and neurogenic cells. Another type VI IF protein, synemin, is expressed in undifferentiated and
mature muscle cells of birds and mammals. In addition to an IF-typical α-helical core domain, type
VI IF proteins are characterized by a long C-terminal tail often containing distinct repeated motifs.
The molecular evolution of type VI IF proteins remains poorly studied.
Results: To examine the evolutionary history of type VI IF proteins, sequence comparisons,
BLAST searches, synteny studies and phylogenic analyses were performed. This study provides new
evidence that tanabin, transitin and nestin are indeed orthologous type VI IF proteins. It
demonstrates that tanabin, transitin and nestin genes share intron positions and sequence
identities, have a similar chromosomal context and display closely related positions in phylogenic
analyses. Despite this homology, fast evolution rates of their C-terminal extremity have caused the
appearance of repeated motifs with distinct biological activities. In particular, our in silico and in vitro
analyses of their tail domain have shown that (avian) transitin, but not (mammalian) nestin, contains
a repeat domain displaying nucleotide hydrolysis activity.
Conclusion: These analyses of the evolutionary history of the IF proteins fit with a model in which
type VI IFs form a branch distinct from NF proteins and are composed of two major proteins:
synemin and nestin orthologs. Rapid evolution of the C-terminal extremity of nestin orthologs
could be responsible for their divergent functions.

Background
The intermediate filament (IF) family is composed of
more than 70 genes that are expressed in a tissue- and
developmental stage- specific manner in metazoan cells
[1-3]. All IF proteins exhibit a tripartite structure comprising a central α-helical core domain flanked by globular
head and tail regions [4]. Members of the IF family are

grouped together in a class of nuclear proteins (lamins:
type V) along with four or five classes of cytoplasmic proteins (types I-IV, VI) depending on the criteria used for
their classification [3-6]. Keratins represent the first two
classes (types I and II) of IF proteins and they are obligatory heteropolymers. Keratin genes are the most abundant
IF family members. In humans, they are clustered on chroPage 1 of 10

mosomes 17q21 (type I) and 12q13 (type II) [7]. Vimentin, desmin, peripherin and GFAP form type III IF proteins
that can assemble in filaments on their own, or in combination with type IV and type VI IF proteins. Neuronal IF
proteins comprise NF-L (light), NF-M (medium), NF-H
(heavy) neurofilament protein subunits that along with
α-internexin are classified as type IV IF proteins.
Upon its identification in 1990, nestin was designated as
the prototype of a new IF protein group (type VI) because
it did not fall clearly into any of the previously described
types [6]. Some debate arose on this classification since
nestin gene structure is closely related to the neurofilament branch in having two of its three intron positions in
common with NF genes [8]. Accordingly, it had been proposed to re-classify nestin as a type IV IF protein [9]. However, the low level of sequence similarity of the α-helical
region of nestin and NF proteins as well as the presence of
a third intron in the nestin gene constitute strong arguments in favor of its classification as a distinct type
[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the discovery of tanabin in Xenopus
laevis a few years later led to the proposal that this tanabin
protein could be the prototype of a different IF type (type
VII) because of the lack of significant sequence similarities
with other IF proteins [11]. Shortly after nestin and tanabin were sequenced, the gene structures of synemin
[12,13] and transitin [14] were also described. According
to their sequence similarities, tanabin was then grouped
with transitin, paranemin (a splice variant of transitin),
synemin and nestin as type VI IF proteins. All these proteins are distinguished by a long C-terminal extremity and
by the fact that they cannot self-form into filaments.
Rather, they need other IF proteins to build filamentous
structures [10,15].
Tanabin is specific to amphibians, transitin to birds and
nestin to mammals. Tanabin is expressed during neurulation of X. laevis and its function is not well understood
[11]. Transitin and nestin are transiently expressed in
myogenic and neurogenic cells of birds and mammals,
respectively [6,16-20]. Chicken transitin is co-expressed
with vimentin in proliferating myoblasts and is associated
for a short period of time with desmin at the Z line during
muscle differentiation [17]. Transitin expression persists
in the smooth muscle cells of elastic arteries and in
Purkinje fibers where it is expressed in association with
vimentin [21]. Its expression is also induced in activated
Müller glial cells of chicken retinas following acute retinal
damage [22]. Paranemin, a splice variant of transitin [14],
is important for the formation of an extended IF network
when co-transfected with desmin in SW13 cells [23].
Recently, transitin has been shown to play an important
role in determining the intracellular localization of Numb
in mitotic neuroepithelial cells [24]. In mammals, nestin
expression is induced in certain tumors as well as in regen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/164

erating skeletal muscles [25,26]. In addition, nestin is
implicated in vimentin intermediate filament disassembly during mitosis [27] and is a survival determinant
through cdk5 regulation in oxidant-induced cell death
[28]. All these observations suggest that both transitin and
nestin have important and distinct functions in various
cell types during embryonic development and in tissue
regeneration in adults.
Despite a low level of sequence identity, the large tail
domains of nestin and transitin display some similarities
including the presence of highly charged glutamate-rich
stretches and of repeated motifs prone to α-helicity. The
tail domain of transitin contains a motif comprised of
more than 50 leucine zipper-like heptad repeats (HR
domain) of the consensus sequence LQVEHGD [29]
whereas that of nestin features an 11-amino acid repeat
motif whose number of repetitions varies according to the
species [6]. Synemin is another type VI IF protein
expressed in developing and adult skeletal muscles of
both birds and mammals [30-32]. Different studies report
that interaction of the long C-terminal tail of synemin
with other cytoskeletal components may be a key component linking myofibrillar Z lines to costameres in skeletal
muscle cells [33,34].
The molecular evolution of type VI IF proteins remains
poorly studied. As already mentioned, the common
denominator shared by all IF proteins is the presence of
an α-helical region involved in filament assembly. Two
prototypes of cytoplasmic IF proteins, defined by the presence or absence of a long lamin-like coil 1b within the αhelical domain, seem to parallel metazoan phylogeny.
The first prototype has the long coil 1b subdomain and
often a lamin homology segment in its tail domain. It has
been documented for 12 protostomic phyla [35,36] and
an hemichordate, although the "long" coil 1b is shortened
by 11 residues in the latter [36]. The second prototype,
restricted to the chordates, contains a coil 1b shortened by
42 residues and lack a lamin homology segment. Following a 42 residue deletion that occured at the origin of the
chordate branch, type I-III- IF proteins were established by
duplication events and sequence drift. The genes encoding
type IV NF proteins have different intron positions than
do type I-III genes. They were proposed to be derived from
retrotransposition of an intron-less intermediate followed
by the acquisition of new introns [37] but this hypothesis
has been recently challenged by the documentation of a
fish gene combining type I-III intron positions with type
IV intron positions [38].
To analyze the evolution of genes encoding type VI IF proteins, sequence comparison, BLAST searching, synteny
studies and phylogenic analysis were performed with
members of this group. This study provides new evidence

that tanabin, transitin and nestin are indeed orthologous
type VI IF proteins. These proteins possess significant
diversity in composition of their long C-terminal tails that
likely provides them with different, but specific functions
in myogenic and neurogenic cells of developing vertebrate
systems. In particular, in silico and in vitro analyses provide
evidence that the C-terminal extremity of (avian) transitin, but not that of (mammalian) nestin, contains a repeat
domain displaying nucleotide hydrolysis activity.

Results and discussion
1-Overview of type VI IF proteins
The cDNA sequence of tanabin from X. laevis has been
published [11], but the organization of its gene structure
is not known. In order to analyze the evolution of type VI
IFs, we first determined the exon/intron structure of the
tanabin gene of X. tropicalis using JGI portal v.4.1. As tanabin was first described in X. laevis [11], a BLASTp search
was made to determine the putative ortholog of tanabin
in X. tropicalis. The protein sequence of tanabin from X.
laevis (tanabin-xl) was used as the query sequence in
BLASTp searching carried out at the JGI portal against the
X. tropicalis genome assembly v4.1. A sequence named
fgenesh1_pg.C of 1868 bp was found to be 67% identical
to tanabin-xl. Tanabin from X. tropicalis (tanabin-xt) is
1970 amino acids (aa) long and possesses the typical αhelical rod domain of IF proteins and a long C-terminal
tail of more than 1400 aa. Tanabin-xl and tanabin-xt share
more than 90% sequence similarity in their IF rod domain
(data not shown).

The mRNA sequence encoding for tanabin-xt was then
compared with the genomic sequence of X. tropicalis
(assembly v4.1.) to determine intron boundaries (Fig.
1a). The genomic sequence of tanabin-xt revealed the
presence of 5 exons of 804 bp, 125 bp, 65 bp, 4848 bp
and 71 bp as well as 4 introns of 4610 bp, 3715 bp, 499
bp and 6593 bp, respectively. The first three exons encode
for the IF core domain and the last two for the C-terminal
domain. Comparison of the gene structure of tanabin
with that of the other type VI family members (nestin,
transitin, synemin) is illustrated in Figure 1b. All genes
share 3 identical intron positions within the 5' portion of
the gene and, as already observed [8,39], the positions of
the two most upstream introns are also shared by the NF
genes. The IF rod domain of type VI IF proteins is thus
encoded by three exons. Our analysis also shows that tanabin has a supplementary intron located at the 3'end of
the gene (Fig. 1A).
The protein sequences of type VI IF proteins were compared using BL2SEQ on the NCBI web site to verify the
level of similarity in their IF rod domain and their C-terminal tail (Table 1). Tanabin-xt and transitin share 51%
sequence identity in their rod domain, which is the most

important level found among type VI IF proteins. Transitin exhibits 44% identity with human nestin in this
domain, a little lower than the usual 50% observed in IF
proteins of the same group. The overall level of sequence
identity in the carboxy-terminal domain of the proteins is
lower at around 20%.

cal rod domain. The consensus sequence for this motif is:
E-Y-Q-X-L-L-D/N-V-K-X-R/A-L-D/E-X-E-I-A-T-Y-R-K/R-LL-E-G-E-E/D-X-R-L/N/I [4]. Multiple alignments using
type VI IF proteins as well as desmin and NF-M sequences
show that the helix termination motifs of type VI IF chains
diverge from the consensus sequence at specific sites: D/
G/E-R/D/G/Y-Q-X-L-A/M/L-H/Q-L/V-K-X-S/G-L-S-X-E-VA-T-Y-R-T/S/A-L-L-E-A/G-E-X-R-L/I/Q/E (Fig. 2A). The
helix termination motif contains key residues that are
important for structure and assembly of IFs and this
region represents one of the two mutation hotspots in IF
proteins [40]. The observed divergences suggest that type
VI IF proteins evolved in a branch distinct from NF proteins and that they gained new residues at the same sites
of segment 2B: Q95, H98, S102, S104 and A116 (asterisks
in Fig. 2A). Those residues may be implicated in specific
functions of type VI IF proteins.
To investigate potential relationships among type VI IF
proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using a multiple alignment of the entire sequence of known type VI
proteins. The sequence of NF-M proteins was also used to
examine how closely related type VI IF proteins are to NF
proteins. As seen in Fig. 2B, such phylogenetic analysis
shows that synemin, transitin, tanabin and nestin are all
part of a group that is distinct from the NF-M protein. This
correlates with the idea that type VI IF genes are the evolutionary result of a duplication event of an ancestral NF
gene and that type VI IF genes then evolved independently
from NFs. Transitin and tanabin are probably more
closely related to each other than to other type VI IF proteins as suggested by their close phylogenetic proximity.
In summary, our analysis indicates that tanabin, transitin
and nestin form a branch distinct from NF proteins and
they are more closely related to each other than to synemin.
2-Tanabin, transitin and nestin are orthologous proteins
To investigate whether tanabin, transitin and nestin are
orthologous proteins, a synteny analysis was performed
using the NCBI mapped genomic scaffolds of human,
mouse, rat and chicken along with the JGI genomic scaffolds of X. tropicalis. As seen in figure 3, regions of strong
synteny conservation exist around both the nestin gene in
all three mammalian species and the transitin gene in
chicken. Nestin and transitin genes both locate between
BCAN and PRCC genes and the order of the neighboring
genes is conserved. Tanabin was located close to the
BCAN gene on X. tropicalis Scaffold_790. The PRCC,
SH2D2A and ARHGEF11 genes were grouped on a different scaffold (not shown). This indicates that the genomic
location of amphibian tanabin, avian transitin and mammalian nestin has been conserved. These observations,
combined with the fact that these genes have the same

and nestin originate from the same ancestral gene.
3-ATPase and GTPase activity of the transitin HR domain
We examined the domain architecture of the type VI IF
proteins through the CDD database (Table 2). As
expected, this analysis confirmed the presence of a canonical IF domain in the N-terminal moiety of tanabin, transitin and nestin but a new domain was revealed in their Cterminal extremity, corresponding to an ATPase motif of
either the SMC type (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes superfamily of proteins) or the AAA+ family
(ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities). The
highest score was obtained for the transitin tail and corresponded to its HR domain. Lower scores were obtained
for tanabin and nestin C-terminal extremities from different species (Table 2). The exact function of the transitin
HR domain is unknown. Paranemin, a splice variant of
transitin, has been shown to be involved in the formation

desmin in IF-free cells [23]. The HR domain may be implicated directly in this mechanism since this protein motif
has been shown to interact with type III IF proteins vimentin and desmin during myogenesis (Guérette et al., submitted). The low sequence identity between the repeated
motifs of transitin and nestin carboxy-terminal extremities and the lowest score for an ATPase motif in the nestin
tail may be the consequence of the rapid evolution of this
part of the gene. As previously shown, the carboxy-termi-

to size fluctuations among rodents and human that could
be linked to its higher evolutionary rates, compared to the
IF rod domain [8]. Incidentally, better E-values were
obtained for an ATPase motif using sequences from dog,
dolphin and human rather than from rodents (Table 2).
We verified by in vitro means whether the C-terminal
repeated domains of both chicken transitin and mouse
nestin could have either ATPase or GTPase activity. To do
so, fusion proteins representing either the entire HR
domain of transitin (HR) or the entire C-terminal

repeated domain of nestin (CTR) were expressed in the
same bacterial strain. These fusion proteins were purified
and ATP and GTP hydrolysis activities were assayed for
phosphate release using the malachite green colorimetric
method for phosphate determination (Fig. 4) [41]. The
HR domain of transitin has ATPase (Fig. 4a) as well as
GTPase (Fig. 4b) activity as shown by an OD augmentation in our assay. Using such an assay, it has not been possible to detect any ATPase or GTPase activity in the mouse
nestin CTR. These experimental results are concordant
with our in silico analysis suggesting that transitin ATPase
activity could have been lost during the rapid evolution of
nestin C-terminal repeat domain in mammals.

The SMC and AAA+ proteins contain two nucleotidebinding modules, the Walker A and Walker B motifs [42],
defining a broad superfamily of nucleotide-binding proteins including many ATPases, myosin and numerous
kinases [43]. In these proteins, the ATP-binding module is
activated by the formation of an oligomeric assembly and
drives conformational changes affecting target substrates.
The Walker A and B motifs of SMC proteins, which show
the highest score with transitin HR domain, are located in
the N- and C-terminal extremities of these proteins and
are separated by a central domain composed of a hinge
sequence flanked by two long coiled-coil motifs [44]. As
the bulk of transitin HR domain is predicted to have a
coiled-coil structure [45], it may be anticipated that the
HR domain presents ATPase activity at one or both ends.
The Walker B signature motif, as decribed by Walker [42],
corresponds to R/KX3GX3Lh4D (h = hybdrophobic and X
= any residue) and could loosely match with the sequence
RDLQEGHGDLQVEHED located at the N-terminal
extremity of the HR domain. In fact, hydrolytic activity
has been detected in our ATPase assay using fragment
HR1–4, which contains the first 4 repeats of the HR
domain. In addition, this domain has been shown to
completely disassemble the IF network when overexpressed in avian myoblasts (Guérette et al., submitted).
Site-directed mutagenesis is now under way to identify the
most important residues for ATP binding and hydrolysis.

In vitro ATPase and GTPase activity of the HR domain
In vitro ATPase and GTPase activity of the HR
domain. The HR domain of chicken transitin and the CTR
domain of mouse nestin were expressed in bacteria and purified. Their ATPase/GTPase activities were tested individually
using the malachite green colorimetric method for phosphate
release determination. Phosphate release was determined at
25°C for each recombinant protein incubated with either A)
ATP or B) GTP. The optical density at 650 nm was determined in triplicate at regularly timed intervals during the
course of the enzymatic reaction and the mean values are
presented with standard deviation error bars. Control:
Buffer with the HR recombinant protein without NTP.

4-Conservation of the HR domain in some species
Since the HR domain is a feature unique to transitin in
that it possesses both ATPase and GTPase activities in vitro,
we focused on the evolution of this particular domain.
Assuming that transitin and nestin are orthologous proteins and that nestin CTR does not show significant
sequence identity with transitin HR domain, we looked
for the presence of HR domain-like sequences in other
genomic regions. BLASTn searches demonstrated that the
transitin HR domain has sequence similarities to two
genomic clones from human and mouse origins. The
human clone RP1 155d22 (gi: 2827470) is located on
chromosome 6q27 and is 82% identical over 118 nt to the
HR domain of chicken transitin (E-value = 4e-7). This
clone does not correspond to the human nestin gene,
located on chromosome 1. The mouse genomic clone
RP2389A3 (gi: 106520665) is located on chromosome 17
and is 79% identical over 353 nt to the HR domain of
chicken transitin (E-value of 5e-16). An hypothetical protein is also predicted (gi: 94403328) with an E-value of
4e-13. This protein is encoded in part by an RP2389A3
clone that likely corresponds to the mouse version of the
HR domain. The human and mouse versions of the HR
domain are not part of any currently known gene. Moreover, these regions are devoid of any IF core feature in the
5' regions suggesting that the putative HR domain found
in human (HRH) and mouse (HRM) may be part of pro-

teins that are not members of the IF family. The HR
domain of chicken transitin was used as a query for a
BL2SEQ alignment with the HRH and HRM sequences.
Both have 50% protein sequence identity with the chicken
transitin HR domain. Consensus repeated sequences
found in HRH and HRM are LQVEEGS and MQVEHDG
respectively, compared with the consensus sequence of
LQVEHGD in the chicken transitin HR domain. Furthermore, monoclonal antibody VAP-5 directed against a
repeated epitope of the HR domain of chick transitin [45]
targets a similar epitope on a synthetic HRM protein (Fig.
5). The HRM sequence has been subcloned in a pET-based
expression vector and a His-tag-HRM fusion protein bacterially produced under IPTG induction. In induced bacterial cultures, an immunoreactive band of the expected
Mr value was observed in Western blots using the antiHis-tag antibody and VAP-5. This protein was not
detected in uninduced cultures (Fig. 5: without IPTG).

A synteny search was conducted using the physical maps
of human, mouse and chicken genomes to determine
whether the genes encoding the HR domain in human
and mouse were conserved among the same set of neighboring genes. The "mammalian" HR domain genomic
segments were syntenic in human (chromosome 6q27)
and mouse (chromosome 17) (Fig. 6a) and correspond to
a well-conserved gene cluster on chicken chromosome 3
from which the "avian" HR domain genomic segment was
absent (Fig. 6b) as it is located on chromosome 25 as part
of the transitin gene (Fig. 6a). These observations suggest
that the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the conserved HR domain in human and mouse likely originated

upstream branches of vertebrate evolution, a tBLASTn
search of Takifugu rubripes (pufferfish) was made using the
entire transitin protein sequence. Genome sequence analysis of T. rubripes did not reveal the presence of a nestin
homolog [38]. This may explain why the rod domain of
desmin was found by tBLASTn analysis to be the strongest
hit to the rod domain of transitin (27% identity). On the
other hand, the HR domain of transitin is 22% identical
to a retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-like (RPGRlike) protein spanning 555 nt with an E-value of 2e-28. As
the protein sequence of tanabin is closely related to transitin, tanabin was used to conduct a second tBLASTn
search. Once again, the RGPR-like protein emerged (22%
identical) spanning 580 nt with an-E value of 2e-21 to the
C-terminal of tanabin. The observations suggest that tanabin and transitin tail domains have evolved from an
RPGR-like protein.
5-Model for the evolution of type VI IF proteins
Type VI IF proteins have two of the three intron positions
in common with type IV NF genes but the level of similarity in the α-helical regions is only 20% compared with
50% observed among the NF genes. It has been postulated
that a type VI IF gene ancestor branched off before the
split into the three NF genes where the ancestor later
gained a third intron [8]. We propose a model to explain
the evolution of type VI IF proteins (Fig. 7). This model
suggests that the first type VI IF gene arose evolutionarily
as the result of incorporation of an RPGR-like cassette into
the 3' extremity of an ancestral NF gene. From tanabin in
amphibians, the history of type VI IF genes may have
included loss of the supplementary intron in the 3' part of
the gene followed by fast evolution of the C-terminal
RPGR-like cassette giving rise to the HR domain as it is
found in avian transitin. In mammals, this domain must
have evolved quickly as some similarity is found between
the chicken HR domain and the dog CTR domain but
none exists between the chicken HR domain and the CTR
domain of mouse and human nestin. According to this
model, the tail domain of human nestin would not have
resulted from the loss of the RPGR-like cassette and its
substitution by the CTR domain but rather from a fast
evolution rate leading to loss of its nucleotidase activity.
In addition, the HR domain could have been duplicated
since it is found in a non-IF hypothetical gene which has
been conserved in a syntenic way among mice and
humans.

Evolutionary model for type VI IF proteins
Evolutionary model for type VI IF proteins. Fugu lacks
obvious nestin homologs [38] and NF proteins may well represent ancestral type VI IF proteins [8]. Our model proposes
that the first type VI IF protein resulted from the fusion of a
RPGR-like cassette C-terminal to a NF gene. The C-terminal
domain of a tanabin-like protein may have evolved giving rise
to the HR domain displaying nucleotide hydrolysis activity in
birds whereas this activity was progressively lost in mammalian nestins. In addition, the HR domain may have been duplicated and conserved in a mammalian gene that is not part of
the IF family.

hydrolysis activity in silico, and indeed, ATPase activity
was measured in vitro within the HR domain of transitin.
This domain apparently experienced a fast evolution rate
that could have resulted in loss of ATPase activity in mammals.

Methods

Conclusion

Known type VI protein sequences
Type VI IF protein sequences used in this study were:
chicken transitin [GenBank: X80877], human nestin
tanabin-xl
[GenBank:
[GenBank:
NM_006617],
M99387], tanabin-xt [JGI: 186291], human synemin
[GenBank: CAC83859]. Other protein sequences used in
this study were: human NF-M [GenBank: CAA68276],
mouse NF-M [GenBank: CAA29127], human desmin
[GenBank: NP_001918], mouse desmin [GenBank:
NP_034173], and RPGR-like [GenBank: AAG00554].

Many lines of evidence based on sequence identity, gene
structure, synteny comparison and phylogeny searching
point to the conclusion that frog tanabin, chicken transitin and mammalian nestin are orthologous members of
the type VI IF proteins. The C-terminal domains of both
tanabin and transitin were predicted to have nucleotide

BLAST, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenic tree
analysis
BLASTn, BLASTp, tBLASTn and BL2SEQ searches were
performed in NCBI or JGI (in the case of X. tropicalis) databases. Default parameters were used to conduct the

searches. Multiple sequence alignments were prepared
using CLC workbench version 3.0.1. These multiple
sequence alignments were used to create a phylogenic tree
with neighbor-joining methods with 100 bootstrap analysis using CLC workbench version 3.0.1 software.
Syntenic relationship identification
Chromosomal locations of nestin and transitin genes
were identified using physically-mapped human (build
36.1), mouse (build 35.1), rat (build v3.4) and chicken
(build 1.1) genomes. For each species, syntenic genes
were located using mapviewer (NCBI). In the case of transitin, as this gene was not located on any chicken chromosome (build 1.1) at the onset of our study, the contig
NW_094723.1 containing the transitin gene was used to
identify neighboring genes. These genes were later located
to chicken chromosome 25 (build 2.1) and then compared with physically mapped human, mouse and rat
genomes. To analyze synteny relationships of the transitin
HR domain, the contigs containing the human and
mouse HR sequences were located on human and mouse
chromosomes and the genes surrounding these sequences
were positioned and compared with the chicken genome.
Assay of ATPase and GTPase activity
Different fusion proteins were cloned as described previously [45]. Fusion proteins were purified by T7-tag affinity
purification (Novagen) or by His-tag Sepharose (Amersham) according to the instructions of the manufacturers.
ATPase and GTPase activities were determined using
"malachite green phosphate assay kits" from BioAssay
Systems. After purification, fusion proteins were dialyzed
against Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2,
100 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol) overnight at 4°C and concentrated using Centricon
YM-10 (Millipore). Protein concentrations were determined with a Micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Fusion
proteins (0.04 µg/µl) were incubated in Buffer A with 1
mM ATP or 1 mM GTP at 25°C. Aliquots were taken at different times and mixed with malachite green buffers as
described by the manufacturer (BioAssay Systems). After
15 min of incubation, the O.D. at 650 nm was determined
using a Multiskan Spectrum spectophotometer (ThermoLabSystems). A standard curve with free phosphate was
produced according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

electrophoresis sample buffer. The protein samples were
resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes as described [46]. For Western blots, the
membranes were saturated for 1 hour at room temperature using 1% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics). The
primary antibody (anti His-tag or mAb VAP-5) was incubated for 1 hour and the secondary antibody for 45 minutes, both at room temperature. The proteins were
detected using the BM chemiluminescence kit (Roche
Diagnostics).
