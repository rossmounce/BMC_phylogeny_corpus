expression, such as sequence changes that affect alternative
splicing or RNA stability. However, one of the major causes of
changed gene expression is likely to be changes in gene regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, and silencers
[3,4]. Such sequence changes might increase or decrease
affinities for specific transcription factors, or indeed result in
the acquisition of new binding sites.

Results: To explore this hypothesis, we performed genome-wide identification of conserved
candidate transcription-factor binding sites that have evolved since the divergence of humans and
chimpanzees. Analysis of candidate transcription-factor binding sites conserved between mouse
and chimpanzee yet absent in human indicated that loss of candidate transcription-factor binding
sites in the human lineage was not random but instead correlated with the biologic functions of
associated genes.

Background: Despite the recent completion of the chimpanzee genome project, few functionally
significant sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees have thus far been identified.
Alteration in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms represents an important platform for
evolutionary change, suggesting that a significant proportion of functional human-chimpanzee
sequence differences may affect regulatory elements.

Donaldson and Göttgens

Comparative gene expression profiling can identify subsets of
genes for which expression levels differ between human and
chimpanzee tissues [5-8]. This provides a potentially powerful approach to identifying those differences in the genome
that are responsible for the different expression patterns or
levels. Accordingly, a recent study [8] showed that the degree
of sequence divergence in aligned human and chimpanzee
core promoters correlated with the divergence of gene expression levels. However, two important issues remain unresolved. First, which specific DNA sequence changes are
responsible for the altered levels of gene expression? (These
will not be restricted to core promoters and may be located far
away in enhancers.) Second, which of the expression changes
contribute to the phenotypic differences between humans
and chimpanzees?
When compared with lower eukaryotes, the greater biologic
complexity of mammalian genomes is thought largely to be a
result of intricate mechanisms of gene regulation [9]. Consequently, although deciphering gene regulatory mechanisms is
a prerequisite to understanding human genome function, the
complexity of regulatory mechanisms raises several problems. The connectivity or 'hard wiring' of transcriptional regulatory networks is achieved through transcription factors
binding specific sequence motifs in gene regulatory regions
[10]. However, the identification of functional regulatory
motifs is hampered by the fact that transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are often short (four to six nucleotides) and
degenerate. This means they occur by chance alone in the
genome, thereby obscuring functional sites. Moreover, and
unlike in simpler genomes such as worm or yeast, in mammalian genomes TFBSs are frequently located outside the proximal promoter of a gene in distal 5' and 3' enhancers or within
introns.
One method by which discovery of functional sites can be
improved is by using phylogenetic footprinting that focuses
on the areas of sequence conservation between two or more
species [11]. For example, comparison of human and mouse
sequences (separated by 70 million years) is a widely used
approach to identifying gene regulatory sequences [12-15].
However, this method is not sensitive enough to detect functional differences between evolutionarily 'close' species, such
as human and chimpanzee. Phylogenetic shadowing represents a possible alternative because it was designed for the
analysis of closely related genomes. However, this method
requires sequences from multiple closely related species to
function effectively [16].
Here, we conducted a genome-wide comparative analysis of
candidate TFBSs that have changed since the human-chimpanzee divergence. We show that, when categorized based on
Gene Ontology (GO) annotation [17], changes in candidate
regulatory motifs correlate with genes that perform specific
biologic functions, principally the sensory perception of
chemical stimulus (smell). Our data therefore suggest that

a significant role in human evolution.

Results
Identification of candidate regulatory TFBSs that have
evolved since human-chimpanzee divergence
Because neither human-mouse comparisons nor phylogenetic shadowing appeared to be useful strategies in identifying candidate regulatory motifs that have evolved since
human-chimpanzee divergence, we devised an alternative
strategy. Our approach initially entailed the identification of
candidate binding sites that are conserved in mouse-human
and mouse-chimpanzee whole genome alignments. Data files
containing these sites can be downloaded from our website
[18]. This approach therefore uses sequence conservation as
the criterion to enrich for functional TFBSs. The mouse
genome was used as the common reference sequence for both
alignments to facilitate the identification of those binding
sites conserved between mouse and chimpanzee but not
between mouse and human. The TFBS consensus sequences
chosen for the above searches were the top 30 motifs from a
recently published seminal study [19] that identified common
regulatory sites conserved in human, dog, mouse, and rat
genomes.
The number of sites conserved in the mouse-chimpanzee and
mouse-human genome alignments ranged from fewer than
20 to more than 200,000, depending on the complexity of the
TFBS consensus sequence (see supplementary data at our
website [18]). Although the numbers of conserved TFBSs
were similar for both comparisons, fewer conserved sites
were found for mouse-chimpanzee than for mouse-human
alignments. This is most likely due to the draft status of the
chimpanzee genome, in which some sequence is still missing
or may contain errors [1,20]. Using the mouse genome as the
common reference sequence allowed us to compare corresponding lists of TFBSs directly and, for example, to identify
those sites that were conserved between mouse and chimpanzee but absent in human (referred to as human mutated sites;
available from our website [18]). In subsequent analysis we

The candidate regulatory TFBS consensus sequences used in
the present study were based on the top 30 hits from a recent
study [19] that was designed to identify sequence TFBSs that
play an important role in gene regulation. Importantly, no
specific regulatory functions have been assigned to these sites
as yet. Therefore, detailed analysis of whether particular overrepresented human mutated motifs recurrently occur in the
vicinity of specific groups of genes is at present limited in its
ability to yield deep biological insight, but it may become useful in the future. Nevertheless, a striking observation was that

refereed research

We then addressed the distribution of candidate TFBSs
mutated since the human-chimpanzee divergence. As our
searches were based on the top 30 TFBS consensus sequences
from the report by Xie and coworkers [19], it was important
to control for any potential bias in their genome-wide distribution. We therefore divided each chromosome into 50 kilobase (kb) nonoverlapping tiles and calculated the following:
the relative number of mouse-chimpanzee conserved sites as
a proportion of these sites on the chromosome; the relative
number of human mutated sites as a proportion of these sites
on the chromosome; and the ratio of the relative number of
human mutated sites over the relative number of mousechimpanzee conserved sites (fold enrichment). To facilitate
subsequent analysis of those parts of the genome that were
highly enriched in human mutated sites, the mean and
median values of fold enrichment were calculated for each
chromosome. Subsequently, enrichment thresholds were set
at mean plus twofold standard deviation as well as threefold

The analysis outlined above demonstrated that the TFBSs
generated from the consensus sequences derived by Xie and
coworkers [19] are not distributed evenly across the genome,
thus emphasizing the need to control the distribution of
TFBSs lost in human. Importantly, however, the distribution
of TFBSs lost in human did not simply shadow the distribution of the total TFBS data set (Figure 2c). This allowed us to
characterize further those regions of the genome that were
relatively enriched for candidate TFBSs lost in the human
genome.

had significantly higher fold enrichment at 9.68, 6.33, and
12.67, respectively. Chromosome Y only had two enriched
tiles and we set enrichment thresholds to 6, 5, and 10, respectively. The chromosome specific data were plotted against the
University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) mouse genome

concentrated on the human mutated sites because of the draft
status of the chimpanzee genome sequence. For the converse,
namely those TFBSs that were conserved in mouse and
human but absent in chimpanzee, some chimpanzee motifs
might be counted as absent because of missing or erroneous
chimpanzee sequence. By contrast, given the high accuracy of
current human genome sequence builds, most mouse-chimpanzee motifs not present in human are likely to be results of
mutations in the human lineage rather than a result of
sequencing artifacts. Two examples of human specific
sequence changes in candidate TFBSs are shown in Figure 1.
Data files containing binding site positions conserved in
mouse and chimpanzee but absent in the human genome can
be downloaded from our website [18]. These files therefore
represent a genome-wide resource cataloging candidate
TFBSs that have evolved in human and chimpanzee lineages
since their last common ancestor.

a small number of biologic functions (as indicated by GO
annotation) were statistically over-represented in genes
within the vicinity of these TFBSs.
To correlate changes in candidate TFBSs with possible biologic functions, the GOToolBox program 'GO-Stats' was run
using the genes identified throughout the genome in areas
over-represented by human mutated TFBSs. We also
included genes with 25 kb either side of the 50 kb tiles,
because sites of interest can be close to the boundary of a tile
and may control genes not within the original tile coordinates. First, we cataloged all genes present in tiles enriched in
human mutated sites (mean plus two standard deviations as
well as threefold and sixfold over median). We focused GO
analysis on these groups because we reasoned that regions
exhibiting enrichment were more likely to contain at least
some biologically important sequence changes than those
with lower levels of enrichment. (Of course, this does not
exclude the possibility that areas with lower enrichment may

contain some biologically important sequence changes.) The
input files for GOToolBox can be downloaded from our website [18]. Several GO terms were either statistically over-represented (enriched; P < 0.01) or under-represented
(depleted; P < 0.01) relative to the distribution of the same
terms in the complete mouse genome (Table 1). Similar
results were obtained when we analyzed our data set with an
analogous tool made available as part of the Panther Classification System [21] (data not shown).
Eleven GO terms were significantly over-represented in the
most restrictive group of genes (sixfold over median density
of human mutated sites). When visualized as a GO tree (a
facility of GOToolBox), it became apparent that these GO
terms were biologically linked in two clusters, culminating in
the GO terms 'sensory perception of smell' and 'G-proteincoupled receptor protein signaling pathway' (Figure 3). The
fact that a small number of GO terms were over-represented
suggests that candidate TFBSs mutated since the human-

Our approach to restrict analysis to likely regulatory sites is in
many ways analogous to previous studies of human-chimpanzee divergence that studied the evolution of protein coding sequences [27,28] and divided sequence alterations into
synonymous and nonsynonymous changes. Nonsynonymous
changes are more likely to affect protein function than are
nonsynonymous ones. By analogy, sequence alterations in
candidate TFBSs are more likely to affect gene regulatory
mechanisms than changes in noncoding sequence not
thought to be involved in regulatory control. The second key
aspect of our methodology was to study likely TFBSs in a
comparative way in human, chimpanzee, and mouse to enrich
further the likely functionality of candidate sites. Restricting

We next investigated the GO terms that were under-represented in the gene lists derived from candidate TFBSs lost in
humans. This analysis should identify biologic functions
associated with gene loci where mutation of candidate binding sites was a relatively rare event in recent human evolution. Only five GO terms were significantly underrepresented in the sixfold over median group: 'nucleobase,
nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism', 'development', 'cellular physiological process', 'primary metabolism', and 'cell organization and biogenesis'. For the threefold
over median set the first three GO terms were found as well as
several additional terms: 'transcription, DNA dependent',
'regulation of cellular metabolism', 'regulation of biological
process', 'regulation of physiological process', 'regulation of
cellular process', 'cellular defense response', and 'regulation

It was proposed more than 30 years ago that gene regulatory
mutations account for many of the major biologic differences
between humans and chimpanzees [22]. This idea has been
reinforced by the recent demonstration of widespread heritability of variation in gene expression levels in humans [23].
Nevertheless, a recent theoretic analysis of human and chimpanzee genome sequences [24] argued that, due to small population sizes in primates, selection may not be effective for
regulatory mutations. However, concerted functional analysis of specific genes has identified positive selection of
regulatory variants during recent primate evolution. For
example, comparative analysis of various primates focusing
on the factor VII and prodynorphin gene promoters [25,26]
demonstrated selection of sequence variants affecting transcriptional activity, thus supporting the hypothesis that regulatory mutations have been important in human evolution.
The apparent discrepancies between the theoretical and
experimental studies may at least partly be a consequence of
the theoretical study treating all bases equally. By contrast,
we aimed to focus our analysis on a small subset of noncoding
sequence by incorporating sequence conservation and TFBS
content criteria, and the data obtained using these criteria are
consistent with regulatory evolution having contributed to
recent human evolution.

chimpanzee divergence are not randomly distributed across
the genome. Moreover, olfactory receptor genes encode Gprotein-coupled receptors, thus linking the two groups of GO
terms shown in Figure 3. GOToolBox analysis of the threefold
over median enriched set gave similar results with only one
difference; 'physiological process' was no longer identified
whereas 'response to pheromone' was (data not shown).
GOToolBox analysis of the mean plus two standard deviations enriched set again gave similar results. The same 10
overlapping GO annotations were identified, and 'physiological process' was now replaced with 'keratinization' (data not

terms were the same as for the sixfold over median set ('nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism',
'development', 'cellular physiological process') and one additional term was also identified ('organ development'). Consistent with a slow rate of evolutionary change at the
respective loci, all depleted GO terms describe very fundamental biologic processes that are likely to be conserved
across large evolutionary distances. Taken together, our
observation that specific GO terms were identified consistently using three different thresholds suggests that this
approach may be used to identify potential pathways underlying human-chimpanzee divergence.

and chimpanzee but absent in humans was again similar to a
principle employed in a recent comparative analysis of
human/chimpanzee/mouse coding sequences [29]. The latter study provided strong evidence for non-neutral evolution
of coding sequences and, similar to our study, suggested that
positive selection during human evolution was affiliated with
a subset of biologic processes.
Clearly, the evolutionary pressures acting on coding versus
gene regulatory sequences may be different. Nevertheless,
'sensory perception' - the biologic process most strongly associated with positive selection in human protein evolution [29]
- was also shown to be over-represented in the present study,
and indeed represented the GO term that integrated most of
the other terms found to be over-represented. The data presented here therefore suggest that recent divergence of sensory perception of smell between humans and chimpanzees
may have occurred at the gene regulatory level as well as the
protein sequence level. Interestingly, when a lower threshold
of motif over-representation was applied using the Panther
classification tool (threefold over median, as opposed to sixfold over median), several GO terms associated with B-cell
immune function were identified in addition to the olfactory
pathway (data not shown). Interestingly, the GO term 'B-cell
function' had not been associated with recent human evolution when human and chimpanzee coding sequences were
compared [29]. This may be the result of different evolutionary pressures acting on coding sequences versus regulatory
mechanisms.
Two recent studies attempting to uncover general principles
governing the recent evolution of human coding and regulatory sequences reached opposing conclusions. According to
the neutralist model of evolution between human and chimpanzee genes, divergence of protein coding sequence and
expression are tightly linked [1]. By contrast, the selectionist
view argues that there is no, or very little, correlation between
coding sequence divergence and expression [30,31]. Our
analysis was restricted to potential regulatory motifs lost
since human-chimpanzee divergence. We therefore did not
address the potential for newly created TFBSs. Moreover, we
only analyzed those motifs lost during human evolution.
Given the potentially different evolutionary pressures acting
on coding and regulatory sequences, we would argue that
generalized concepts explaining the parallel evolution of coding sequences and regulatory elements may not be applicable
in a genome-wide manner. Our observation that olfactory
receptor genes exhibit apparent accelerated evolution at both
the gene regulatory and protein levels is consistent with the
neutralist model of evolution. However, this parallel accelerated evolution may not apply to genes playing a role in B-cell
function. By providing a genome-wide catalog of candidate
TFBSs mutated since the human-chimpanzee divergence, the
present study will not only allow the characterization of general patterns of evolutionary change but also facilitate analysis of specific gene loci.

Conclusion

Alteration in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms represents an important platform for evolutionary change. This
report suggests that a significant proportion of functional
human-chimpanzee sequence differences may affect regulatory elements, thus supporting the notion that changes in
transcriptional regulation played an important role in recent
human evolution. Moreover, by identifying genes associated
with mutated candidate binding sites, the present study highlights potential pathways underlying human-chimpanzee
divergence.

Materials and methods
Discovery of conserved binding sites in aligned
genomes and the determination of sites mutated in the
human genome
The genome assemblies used in the mouse-human and
mouse-chimpanzee sequence alignments were mouse
(mm6), human (hg17), and chimpanzee (panTrog1). The
localized alignments for each comparison (specifically the
axtNet processed alignments) were downloaded from the
Genome Bioinformatics group at the UCSC [32]. Conserved
binding sites were located using our PERL program TFBSsearch [33], excluding those located in repetitive sequence
identified in the alignments by softmasking.
For 30 TFBS consensus sequences, positions of mouse-chimpanzee conserved binding sites were compared with mousehuman conserved binding sites (using a PERL script); those
motifs that could not be found to be conserved in the mousehuman alignments were retained for further study. Of these
motifs we removed duplicated sites, those located in annotated exons, and areas affected by genomic structural variation (using PERL scripts). Duplicate sites are present as eight
of the motifs contain palindromic sequence and our program
searches the entire genome on both strands. We chose to
remove sites located in annotated mouse exons (both coding
and untranslated), the positions of which were retrieved
using the Ensembl API v32 [34]. Genomic structural variations are manifest by deletions, insertion, and inversions
between the human and chimpanzee genomes [35]. To this
end we only considered motifs in areas of the mouse genome
that are present in both human and chimpanzee genome pairwise alignments.

Localization of Ensembl genes to binding sites mutated
in the human genome
For each of the 50 kb tiles (± 25 kb) over-represented by
human mutated TFBSs, we employed a PERL script [33] utilizing the Ensembl API v32 to identify all genes in these
regions. Gene symbols (represented by the Ensembl identifier
'db_xref: MarkerSymbol') were extracted from each localized
gene file and were processed to ensure all gene symbols are
only represented once in the data set.

comment

The web-based tool GOToolBox [36,37] was used to identify
statistically over-represented or under-represented GO terms
in our gene symbol data sets compared with the distribution
of the terms among the annotations of the complete genome.
The 'Create Dataset' program was used to make a file compatible with the 'GO-Stats' program. To run 'Create Dataset' Mus
musculus was selected as the target species and 'biological
processes' was chosen for the ontology type. Other options
were left as default. The resulting file was used with the 'GOStats' program employing the hypergeometric statistical test
and correction for multiple tests using the Bonferroni
method.
