Abstract
Background: The origin and evolution of the homologous GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins FtsZ
typical of Bacteria and tubulin characteristic of eukaryotes is a major question in molecular
evolutionary biology. Both FtsZ and tubulin are central to key cell biology processes – bacterial
septation and cell division in the case of FtsZ and in the case of tubulins the function of microtubules
necessary for mitosis and other key cytoskeleton-dependent processes in eukaryotes. The origin
of tubulin in particular is of significance to models for eukaryote origins. Most members of domain
Bacteria possess FtsZ, but bacteria in genus Prosthecobacter of the phylum Verrucomicrobia form a
key exception, possessing tubulin homologs BtubA and BtubB. It is therefore of interest to know
whether other members of phylum Verrucomicrobia possess FtsZ or tubulin as their FtsZ-tubulin
gene family representative.
Results: Verrucomicrobium spinosum, a member of Phylum Verrucomicrobia of domain Bacteria, has
been found to possess a gene for a protein homologous to the cytoskeletal protein FtsZ. The
deduced amino acid sequence has sequence signatures and predicted secondary structure
characteristic for FtsZ rather than tubulin, but phylogenetic trees and sequence analysis indicate
that it is divergent from all other known FtsZ sequences in members of domain Bacteria. The FtsZ
gene of V. spinosum is located within a dcw gene cluster exhibiting gene order conservation known
to contribute to the divisome in other Bacteria and comparable to these clusters in other Bacteria,
suggesting a similar functional role.
Conclusion: Verrucomicrobium spinosum has been found to possess a gene for a protein
homologous to the cytoskeletal protein FtsZ. The results suggest the functional as well as structural
homology of the V. spinosum FtsZ to the FtsZs of other Bacteria implying its involvement in cell
septum formation during division. Thus, both bacteria-like FtsZ and eukaryote-like tubulin
cytoskeletal homologs occur in different species of the phylum Verrucomicrobia of domain Bacteria,
a result with potential major implications for understanding evolution of tubulin-like cytoskeletal
proteins and the origin of eukaryote tubulins.

Background
Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes are now known to possess cytoskeletal proteins, including tubulin components
of the eukaryotic microtubules important in mitosis and
the tubulin homolog FtsZ of bacteria which forms a septal
Z-ring during bacterial cell division[1,2]. Most bacteria
possess a cell division protein more closely related to FtsZ,
the homolog of tubulin present almost universally within
bacteria, than to the tubulin characteristic of eukaryotes
[3-5]. Some rare bacterial species appear to lack any tubulin or FtsZ homolog at all [4]. Both FtsZ and tubulin are
significant for evolutionary cell biology since FtsZ is pivotal to cell division in most bacteria and tubulin is a
cytoskeletal eukaryote signature protein [6]central to
models for origins of eukaryote cell organization [7,8].
Tubulin has been confirmed to be the homolog of FtsZ at
the 3D structural level by crystallography [9,10]. Both proteins can polymerize into filaments, in the case of tubulin
as a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits that forms the
basis in vivo of eukaryote cytoskeletal microtubules central
to many processes of eukaryote cell biology, and in the
case of FtsZ into protofilaments in vitro and septal rings in
vivo [2].
The genus Prosthecobacter is a member of the phylogenetically divergent phylum Verrucomicrobia [11] which forms
a superphylum with other phyla Planctomycetes and
Chlamydia of the domain Bacteria [12], and species of this
genus such as P. dejongeii, possess the proteins BtubA and
BtubB more closely related to eukaryotic tubulin than to
bacterial FtsZ [13]. BtubA and BtubB appear to be genuine
tubulins, and can form three-dimensional bundles of up
to 30 protofilaments in the presence of GTP in vitro [14].
Prosthecobacter dejongeii, however, does not apparently
possess FtsZ [14]. It would be expected that other members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia would also possess
such a tubulin homolog e.g. if a last common ancestor of
the verrucomicrobia also possessed such a homolog. We
therefore searched the draft genome of Verrucomicrobium
spinosum for the presence of genes similar to cytoskeletal
proteins such as FtsZ and tubulin, and revealed the presence of a gene coding for a protein with primary and secondary structural characteristics and evolutionary
relationships consistent with closer relationship to genes
for bacterial FtsZ than to those for eukaryotic tubulins.

Results and discussion
A putative gene (Genbank: DQ845344) which appears to
code for an ortholog of bacterial FtsZ, a cytoskeletal protein involved in cell division, was amplified to confirm
the sequence from examining the draft genome of Verrucomicrobium spinosum. The translated protein VerFtsZ from
this putative gene is 673 amino acids long, and application of FingerPRINTScan showed that VerFtsZ contains
each of the six motifs specific to bacterial FtsZ [15]. Con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/37

sistent with this, application of GeneFIND for gene family
identification showed a highly probable relationship to
the FtsZ and FtsZ1 superfamily[16].
The core region of FtsZ in bacteria starts with a highly conserved isoleucine with only 14 changes at the position in
225 sequences from different organisms and ends with a
recognizable version of the amino acid sequence LVITG.
The core region of bacterial FtsZ also contains a sequence
similar to the highly conserved tubulin signature motif
(PROSITE motif PS00227: ([S/A/G]GGTG [S/A/T]G).
VerFtsZ aligns perfectly with the conserved isoleucine of
other FtsZ sequences at the start of the core region and
also contains the tubulin signature – as manifested by the
sequence GGGTGSG (Fig. 1). However, VerFtsZ shows a
fairly divergent sequence at the end of the core region (Fig.
1), which was observed in seven sequences of Archaea
FtsZ3, as well as in Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium FtsZ. The C-terminal region of bacteria,
which interacts directly with FtsA, lacks a classical consensus sequence due to substitutions but a sequence logo has
been derived from an alignment to display the pattern of
protein sequences at the C-terminal [4], and there is some
relative conservation of amino acids at particular positions. The C-terminal of VerFtsZ seemed to vary slightly
from this sequence logo but it does share the highly conserved Proline position (position number 728 in Fig. 1)
with other FtsZ sequences.
A more detailed examination of the core region of VerFtsZ
reveals significant divergence at amino acid positions otherwise conserved among other phyla. There are 8
instances (red arrows in Fig. 1) of amino acid changes to
another amino acid of different physico-chemical properties from those conserved completely in the other
sequences, which could imply possible structural and
physiochemical significance e.g. hydrophilic to hydrophobic for the change of lysine to cysteine at position 75.
The amino acid serine within the tubulin signature motif
(highlighted with blue arrow at position 174) presents yet
another significant difference. An examination of available database for the tubulin signature motif at PROSITE,
and that compiled by Vaughan et al., revealed that a serine
at this position is present only in the FtsZ of the alphaproteobacterium Magnetospirillium magnetotacticum, plastids of some members under Viridiplantae and the
Archaea Halobacterium species NRC-1, but highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic tubulins and also in
BtubA and BtubB of Prosthecobacter.
Preliminary deduction of VerFtsZ protein structure from
secondary structure comparisons using Cn3D database at
NCBI resulted in reasonable alignment to the structural
model of 1FSZ for FtsZ of Methanococcus jannaschii from
Protein Data Bank (note that this species is synonymous

with Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, the name used in
some other databases employed for this study).
In order to investigate the relationship of VerFtsZ to FtsZ
of other bacteria, we performed phylogenetic analysis
using the alignment in Fig 1 which consists of a set of reference sequences of FtsZ of bacteria of different phyla. The
alignment contains the functional core and C-terminal
domains of FtsZ while the variable spacer region has been
omitted. Phylogenetic analysis of an alignment including
VerFtsZ and reference sequences of FtsZ from bacteria was
performed using Treefinder [17]. In the analysis (Fig. 2),
the long branch of VerFtsZ confirms its divergence from
the other representatives of FtsZ among the domain Bacteria with no apparent implication of horizontal gene
transfer from any existing bacterial phyla.
VerFtsZ displays lower similarity to FtsZs of other Bacterial
phyla than the similarity of the FtsZs of any of those phylum representatives to the FtsZs from any other Bacterial
phylum. For example, when calculated using an alignment without the variable spacer region, the FtsZ of
Aquifex aeolicus, widely considered a deep-branching bacterium, exhibits a similarity to VerFtsZ of only 36.8%, yet
shows a similarity of at least 42% to the other representative FtsZs, and other Bacterial FtsZs often display greater
similarity to any other Bacterial FtsZs than to VerFtsZ.
In other Bacteria, the ftsZ gene is known to form part of
the dcw gene cluster which possesses other genes coding
for proteins concerned with cell division coordinated with
FtsZ in the divisome, such as FtsA, FtsI, FtsW, FtsQ and
several genes concerned with cell wall synthesis such as
the peptidoglycan synthesis mur genes murG, murD and
murE [18]. V.spinosum contains an almost complete set of
proteins of the dcw gene cluster (Fig. 3), with only MraZ
and FtsL missing from the cluster. The genes for MurB,
MurC and EnvA are absent from the V. spinosum dcw cluster but corresponding sequences are present elsewhere in
the genome of this species. The order of the genes in the
dcw cluster in V. spinosum can be seen to be similar to the
gene order of the dcw clusters of bacteria in several distinct
phyla (as represented by Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis,
Thermotoga maritima and Chlamydia trachomatis in Fig. 3,
members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Thermotoga, and Chlamydia respectively). Despite sharing membership of a potential superphylum with Chlamydia
trachomatis, the dcw cluster of V. spinosum, like E. coli and
B. subtilis, possesses FtsQ, FtsA and FtsZ in that same
order, while these are missing from the dcw cluster of C.
trachomatis, an organism known to possess no FtsZ.
The organization of the ftsZ gene of V. spinosum within a
gene cluster known to be concerned with formation of a
septation divisome and related cell wall synthesis in E. coli

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/37

suggests that the verrucomicrobial FtsZ protein also participates in a multi-protein divisome organizing septum
synthesis.

Conclusion
It is clear from the above analysis that VerFtsZ of the verrucomicrobia member Verrucomicrobium spinosum is a true
ortholog of other FtsZ sequences from Bacteria, and differs markedly from the tubulin homologs BtubA and
BtubB of Prosthecobacter dejongeii. BtubA and BtubB have
been shown to form a similar heterodimer to αβ-tubulin
and seem to be bacterial tubulins fundamentally distinct
from FtsZ while sharing the features common to the FtsZtubulin family [19]. This difference between the V. spinosum FtsZ and the P. dejongeii tubulins is of considerable
evolutionary interest, since clearly from our analysis,
these two markedly different proteins occur in two species
within the same phylum Verrucomicrobia of domain Bacteria. One would expect from phylogenetic considerations
that members of the same monophyletic phylum level
group within the Bacteria would possess orthologs of only
FtsZ or tubulin but that both of these closely related but
quite distinct orthologs would not be present in the same
phylum. The occurrence of both FtsZ and tubulin
homologs within different genera of the same phylum can
be explained either by a gene loss and replacement by a
lateral gene transfer event or by a close relationship of the
FtsZ and tubulins found in this phylum to a last common
ancestor possessing a protein with similarities to both. It
has been pointed out from structural considerations that
horizontal gene transfer is one explanation for the origin
of the tubulin homologs BtubB and BtubA in P. dejongeii
[19].
The unexpected occurrence of both FtsZ and tubulin
cytoskeletal proteins in one bacterial phylum could be
explained in several ways. Both proteins could have been
present in the common ancestor of Verrucomicrobium and
Prosthecobacter and then may have been differentially lost
or have significantly diverged. Alternatively, horizontal
transfer from proto-eukaryotes or eukaryotes to Prosthecobacter may account for tubulin in this genus and this
is supported by genome data suggesting a largely bacterial
nature for P.dejongeii genes [19].
Verrucomicrobium spinosum and Prosthecobacter dejongeii
form a relatively shallow clade within the verrucomicrobia according to other genes. The 16S rRNA similarity
between Verrucomicrobium spinosum and Prosthecobacter
dejongeii as well as all other species of Prosthecobacter is
quite high at 91%, relative to the similarity of members of
both these genera to deeper-branching species of verrucomicrobia such as Victivallis vadensis (76% in each case) or
Opitutus terrae (80%). This should be more compatible
with a late lateral gene transfer of tubulin genes into Pros-

thecobacter species than an ancient gene duplication in a
verrucomicrobial ancestor (since retention of tubulin in
both members of a resulting lineage or clade within verrucomicrobia would be expected if inherited vertically from
a common ancestor).
Lateral transfer of tubulin genes seems more likely than
transfer of FtsZ genes since a whole dcw cluster would
have to be transferred. Loss and replacement of a complete multi-gene cell division mechanism necessary for
viability of a cell population seems an unlikely scenario in
case of one incorporating either FtsZ or tubulin, but the
similarity of ancestral FtZs and tubulins could have meant
such ancestral proteins could have been easily interchangeable within a common gene organization. Otherwise a version of the 'complexity hypothesis' [20]relating
to cell division as a complex system of interacting proteins
suggests that it would be difficult to replace FtsZ within a
dcw cluster with a more evolved tubulin. From existing
draft genome sequence, it appears that the significant gene
for the FtsA protein important for interaction with FtsZ is
missing from P. dejongeii, though genes of the dcw cluster
concerned with peptidoglycan synthesis such as murD are
present. P. dejongeii also seems to have a gene for FtsW,

known to interact with peptidoglycan synthesis proteins[21]. Significantly, the tubulin genes in this species
are organized in an operon along with a kinesin-like gene,
suggesting they are not a part of the dcw cluster [13]. Coexpression of btuba and btubb in E. coli results in either
prominent rods running along the cell length or loose spirals so this suggest that these proteins by themselves may
be able to form cytoskeletal filaments in vivo [14].
Tubulin genes may be found in other verrucomicrobia
branching more deeply than Prosthecobacter species within
the verrucomicrobia. This is suggested by the report via
anti-tubulin antibodies of tubulin in the 'epixenosomes',
verrucomicrobial symbionts of marine ciliate protozoan
Euplotidium [22]. Epixenosomes are members of subdivision 4 of the phylum Verrucomicrobia [23,24] along with
the cultured Opitutus terrae. The distribution of genes for
both tubulins and FtsZ must be determined in a wider
selection of verrucomicrobia among all 5 subdivisions
distinguished[25,26], e.g. cultured members of genera
Opitutus and Chthoniobacter, in order to determine an optimal basis for further investigations of their evolution via
data from genomics and cell biology. Since genome data
for Verrucomicrobium spinosum and Prosthecobacter dejongeii

is only in draft form so far, there is a possibility that either
or both of these species possess both FtsZ and tubulin,
and this should be confirmed or refuted by annotation of
completed genomes for these species.
Discovery of a verrucomicrobial FtsZ in at least one genus
and species combined with our existing knowledge of a
tubulin in another verrucomicrobial genus reveals that
two markedly different members of the tubulin-FtsZ
cytoskeletal protein family occur within the same clade of
the same bacterial phylum. This result may be of potential
significance for our understanding of eukaryote and Bacterial cytoskeleton evolution, since such occurrence may
suggest new models for cytoskeletal protein evolution e.g.
derivation of both FtsZ and tubulin from an ancestral protein or proteins present in a Bacterial ancestor, or lateral
transfer of cytoskeletal genes between domains at early
stages in their evolution. Members of the phylum Verrucomicrobia may hold a key to the ancient molecular evolutionary stages by which tubulins and FtsZ's diverged and
differentiated, or alternatively, the trace of an early event
in the gene transfer network between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes which may have preserved an early 'snapshot'
of the evolution of eukaryote cytoskeletal proteins. Such
models may be testable via a combination of further
genomic and bioinformatic analysis of existing and newly
discovered verrucomicrobia.

Methods
Bacterial strains and culture
Cultures of Verrucomicrobium spinosum DSM 4136 were
grown aerobically at room temperature in modified
medium B agar [27].
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from Verrucomicrobium spinosum cultures by using the Instagene matrix (Bio-Rad).
Amplification of verftsz
The verftsz gene was amplified from single V. spinosum colonies via PCR. PCR primers used for the PCR (5' – 3') were
as follows: AGTATTCCAGTGTAACCCG (forward) and
GTCTCTTGAAGTGAAGGCTC (reverse). PCR was carried
out with an initial denaturation at 96°C for 3 mins, followed by 32 cycles of 94°C for 1 min 30 sec, annealing at
58°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min 30 sec
followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 10 mins.
Primers used for sequencing were the same as for PCR
with the addition of two internal sequencing primers (5'
– 3') CTCCTTTGAGGGGCGTCGT (forward) and TGTCCCCTTCATCTTCCTCA (reverse).
Sequence analysis
The putative protein hereby termed VerFtsZ was analysed
for signature motifs using the program FingerPRINTScan

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/37

[28,29]. Gene family identification was done through
Gene Family Identification Network Design (GeneFIND)
[30]. Secondary structure of putative sequences was determined using the three-dimensional molecular structure
viewer program Cn3D 4.1 [31] by structural homology
matching against 1FSZ, the FtsZ structure of Methanococcus
jannaschii [9]in the Protein Data Bank at NCBI.
Conserved region analysis
Regions of conservation such as the core and C-terminal
regions were analysed based on a published analysis of
FtsZ [4], and an alignment of VerFtsZ against published
reference sequences of Bacterial amino acid sequences was
performed using CLUSTALX. V. 1.8 [32]
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignment of VerFtsZ against reference sequences of Bacterial FtsZs was performed using CLUSTALX. V. 1.8 [32].
Optimization of the alignment i.e removal of variable
spacer region and alignment of C-terminal region was performed using GeneDoc [33] The Modelgenerator [34] was
used to obtain the model and parameters for the likelihood analysis for the alignment of VerFtsZ and FtsZ. Modelgenerator selected WAG + G as the best model for the
maximum likelihood analyses based on the Akaike Information Criterion 1, Akaike Information Criterion 2, and
Bayesian Information Criterion. A maximum likelihood
tree was generated using TreeFinder [17]. Bootstrap analysis using 1,000 replicates with 4 gamma categories under
the WAG substitution matrix [35] under the assumption
of gamma-distributed, substitution rate variation [36] was
performed on the tree with the highest likelihood score.
Similarity values were calculated within PHYLIP Protdist
advanced options within Institut Pasteur's Software for
Biology site [37].
In silico analysis
Homology search
Gene searches utilized the Verrucomicrobium spinosum
genome made available for public release by TIGR (The
Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, Maryland).
Searches for the proteins of the dcw gene cluster (mraW,
mraY, mraZ, murB, murC, murD, murE, murF, murG,
FtsA, FtsI, FtsL, FtsQ, FtsW, FtsZ and ddlB) were conducted
using query amino acid sequences from Escherichia coli
and the similarity search function (tblastn) at The Institute of Genome Research (TIGR).
