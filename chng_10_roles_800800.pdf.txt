Roles of Sema4D and Plexin-B1 in tumor
progression
Ewe Seng Ch’ng1*, Atsushi Kumanogoh2

Abstract
Sema4D, also known as CD100, is a protein belonging to class IV semaphorin. Its physiologic roles in the immune
and nervous systems have been extensively explored. However, the roles of Sema4D have extended beyond these
traditionally studied territories. Via interaction with its high affinity receptor Plexin-B1, Sema4D-Plexin-B1 involvement in tumor progression is strongly implied. Here, we critically review and delineate the Sema4D-Plexin-B1 interaction in many facets of tumor progression: tumor angiogenesis, regulation of tumor-associated macrophages and
control of invasive growth. We correlate the in vitro and in vivo experimental data with the clinical study outcomes, and present a molecular mechanistic basis accounting for the intriguingly contradicting results from these
recent studies.
1. Introduction
Semaphorins are a large family of secreted, transmembrane or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins
containing a phylogenetically conserved extracellular
“sema” domain. They are classified into eight classes, of
which classes 3 to 7 contain vertebrate semaphorins [1].
Their major receptors have been identified as plexins. In
contrast to semaphorins, plexins are transmembrane
proteins containing a phylogenetically conserved intracellular “sex and plexins” domain. They are subdivided
into plexin A to D subfamilies [2].
Since the discovery of semaphorins as axon guidance
cues, semaphorin-plexin interactions have been traditionally best described in the nervous system. Recently
their interactions in other systems have also been
explored, notably in the cardiovascular development, following revelation of their regulatory roles in cellular
motility [3,4]. Intriguingly, semaphorins are also extensively involved in immune response regulation, qualifying some of them as “immune” semaphorins [5]. Recent
studies have also focused on the pathological aspects, in
particular on their links to several hallmarks of cancer
such as tumor angiogenesis and invasiveness. Indeed,
these processes recapitulate the many semaphorin-plexin
roles in physiologic development. Several recent reviews

nicely summarized the accumulating evidence of semaphorin-plexin involvement in cancer progression [6-9];
however, the majority of the content referred to particularly secreted class 3 semaphorins. In this review, we
focus on a transmembrane class 4 semaphorin, Sema4D
and its receptor, plenxin-B1. We also present a molecular mechanistic basis to reconcile the conflicting results
of these molecules in tumor progression from the recent
studies.

2. Sema4D has versatile roles in immune
regulation and axonal guidance
Sema4D, also known as CD100, is a 150kD homodimeric
transmembrane glycoprotein first identified in immune
cells [10-12], and later classified as a member of class 4
semaphorin based on its distinctive structure [1].
Biological activities of Sema4D are well characterized
in the immune system. Sema4D is highly expressed in
resting T cells. Although its expression is low in resting
B cells and antigen-presenting cells, Sema4D is up-regulated in these cells upon activation. As a ligand acting
via its low affinity receptor CD72, Sema4D promotes
the aggregation and survival of B cells, and enhances the
activation of B cells in antibody production [11,13,14].
Sema4D is also involved in the activation and maturation of antigen-presenting cells [14,15]. Via its high affinity receptor Plexin-B1 [2], Sema4D inhibits the
migration of monocytic and B-cell lineage cells [16,17].
Reciprocally, acting as a receptor, Sema4D regulates T

cell activation [18,19], and is involved in the terminal
stages of B cell differentiation [20].
Sema4D is also widely expressed in embryonic nervous tissue, especially in cortical plate and dorsal root
ganglia [12], and postnatally in white matter, especially
in myelinating oligodendrocytes [21]. As an axonal guidance cue in central nervous tissue, Sema4D functions
in a seemingly contradicting fashion. For example, it
induces growth cone collapse in primary hippocampal
neurons [22,23], but stimulates axonal outgrowth of
embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons [24] and guides

the migratory process of gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone-1 cells [25]. Contradictory to its interaction with CD72 in the immune system, Sema4D
interacts with its high affinity receptor, Plexin-B1, in the
nervous tissue.
However, cumulative data have suggested wider roles
for Sema4D. In vitro and in vivo studies recently have
given many insights into the involvement of Sema4D in
tumor progression via interaction with Plexin-B1 (Figure
1). The mechanistic roles of Sema4D and Plexin-B1 in

regulation of tumor-associated macrophages as well as
the invasiveness of the tumor itself are highlighted in
the following discussion.

3. Sema4D acts as an angiogenic factor through
its high affinity receptor Plexin-B1
Evidence demonstrating the proangiogenic properties of
Sema4D has emerged from several in vitro and in vivo
studies. Sema4D is able to induce cell migration and
promote tubulogenesis in endothelial cells, mimicking
pivotal events in angiogenesis. Notably, this angiogenic
response elicited by Sema4D is comparable to that by
other well-known angiogenic molecules such as VEGFA, HGF, and bFGF and is independent of any up-regulation of these molecules. In vivo studies employing chick
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and Matigel
plug assay confirmed this finding [26,27].
The signaling mechanism behind this Sema4Dinduced angiogenic response has also been extensively
studied. Plexin-B1, a high affinity receptor for Sema4D,
is highly expressed in endothelial cells. Sema4D specifically binds and activates this endothelial receptor to elicit an angiogenic effect [26,27]. However, the signaling
cascade beyond the Sema4D-Plexin-B1 interaction is
complex and is still debated as described below.
Regarding the angiogenic process, two mechanisms
have been proposed with conflicting results (Figure 2.).
One mechanism proposes a signaling mechanism utilizing the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of Plexin-B1,
which binds two RhoGEFs, PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG,
and subsequently activates RhoA. Through the engagement of integrins, this pathway also activates an intracellular tyrosine kinase cascade, notably one that
involves Pyk2 [27-29]. The other proposed mechanism
involves Met activation and tyrosine phosphorylation
through Plexin-B1-Met interaction upon Sema4D binding [26]. Both of these mechanisms lead to cytoskeletal
reorganization in endothelial cells and their migration.
Given its proangiogenic properties, the possible involvement of Sema4D in tumor angiogenesis was explored.
Sema4D is indeed highly expressed in a wide range of
human tumors such as prostate, colon, breast, oral, head
and neck carcinomas as well as soft tissue sarcomas
[30,31]. In one study employing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines with high expression of
Sema4D, tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in vivo
were greatly impaired in the absence of Sema4D [31]. In
addition, induction of angiogenesis by tumor cells was
made possible by proteolytic cleavage of this membranebound Sema4D from the tumor cell surface, releasing its
soluble form and thereby permitting Sema4D to act on
local as well as distant tumor microenvironments [32].
Another study employing breast cancer cell lines in
Sema4D knockout mice demonstrated that the

Page 3 of 9

presence of Sema4D in the tumor microenvironment is
important for tumor growth and metastasis, which is
attributed to tumor vessel maturation induced by
Sema4D [33]. Contradicting to the role of tumorderived Sema4D in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, this study however showed that tumor-associated macrophages but not tumor cells per se are the
main cells that produce Sema4D in the tumor microenvironment, which enhances angiogenesis and contributes to tumor growth [33]. This discrepancy remains
unsolved possibly due to differences between these
tumor cell lines.
Similar to other in vitro studies, tumor angiogenesis
induction by Sema4D is mediated through its interaction with Plexin-B1 [31] (Figure 2). A study using
Sema4D-expressing melanoma transplants in PlexinB1 knockout mice, however, showed no significant
impairment in tumor angiogenesis. This result indicated that Plexin-B1 is sufficient but not essential for
Sema4D-induced tumor angiogenesis; possibly the
redundant lower affinity receptors such as Plexin-B2
could be engaged by Sema4D in tumor angiogenesis
[34] (Figure 2).

4. Sema4D regulates monocytic lineage cells and
tumor-associated macrophages in tumor
microenvironment
Focusing on the effect of Sema4D on a monocytic lineage, an inhibitory effect on cell migration was demonstrated [16]. A recent study also showed that sequential
engagement of CD72 and Plexin-B1 is crucial in this
inhibitory effect during the maturation of monocytes
into immature dendritic cells. Modulation of cytokine
production towards either an anti-inflammatory or a
pro-inflammatory cytokine profile seems to be dependent on Sema4D concentration [14,17]. Upon activation,
Sema4D expression in dendritic cells is up-regulated.
Augmentation of response in an autocrine manner by
the proteolytic release of Sema4D acting on receptors in
the same cells could ensue [15]. In tumor-associated
macrophages, although the lack of Sema4D itself did not
alter the differentiation and activation capabilities as
well as the cytokine production profile, a significantly
lower number of tumor-associated macrophages was
observed in the tumor microenvironment [33]. However,
the precise mechanism behind these findings awaits
elucidation.
Considering these results, the inhibition of cell migration by Sema4D could be alternately interpreted as a
means of prolonging cell-cell contact in a physiologic
immune response. Exploitation of this mechanism by
tumor cells would lead to the retention of tumor-associated macrophages and the subsequent induction of
angiogenesis could therefore be triggered.

Figure 2 Sema4D-Plexin-B1 signaling pathways in angiogenesis. Sema4D engages Plexin-B1 to induce angiogenesis and tumor
angiogenesis via two independent downstream pathways. Plexin-B2 might also play a redundant role in this aspect.

5. Sema4D-Plexin-B1 interaction controls invasive
growth
Invasive growth is a complex morphogenetic program
that includes several steps such as cell-cell dissociation,
motility, colonization of new sites, proliferation and survival. Invasive growth under physiologic conditions
occurs during embryogenesis and wound healing. However, when this program is hijacked, cancer progression
and metastasis, the pathologic counterpart, ensue [35].
An invasive growth phenotype in epithelial cells could
be elicited by Sema4D through Plexin-B1 coupled with
the Met signaling pathway [36]. Another study along the
same line showed that Ron, a scatter factor receptor
similar to Met, also couples with Plexin-B1 in transducing Sema4D signals (Figure 3). Moreover, over-expression of Plexin-B1 is observed in breast, colon, liver,

pancreatic and gastric carcinoma cell lines. Signaling
through Plexin-B1 coupled with Met is essential for
invasive response in these cell lines [26,37,38].
However, signaling by Sema4D through Plexin-B1
coupling with Met in invasive response is partially disputed by a recent study. This study demonstrated that
the antimigratory or promigratory effects of Sema4D in
breast cancer cell lines depend on the stoichiometry of
the expression of Plexin-B1, Met and ErbB-2 [39]. ErbB2 is a well-known poor prognostic factor in breast cancer. Coupling of Plexin-B1 with Met inhibits migration,
while coupling with ErbB-2 promotes it. By competing
for Plexin-B1, these two molecules counter each other’s
effects in the same tumor cell, determining the net antimigratory or promigratory effect of Sema4D. These
molecular complexes further control a downstream

Figure 3 Control of cellular motility by Sema 4D-Plexin-B1 interation via the coopeative mechanism. Coupled with the Met, Ron or ErbB2 tyrosine kinase receptor at the cellular membrane surface, Sema4D interacts with Plexin-B1 to control cellular motility and invasive growth via
Gab1 or Rho-dependant pathways.

Rho-dependent pathway that is similar to the mechanism proposed to promote endothelial cell angiogenesis
[39,40] (Figure 3).
Although not shown in most studies involving cancer
cell lines, another line of investigation of Sema4D and
Plexin-B1 interactions centered on the collapse of neurite outgrowth. Recently, Plexin-B1 has been discovered
to have intrinsic GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity towards R-Ras [23]. Inactivation of R-Ras reduces
cell adhesion, cell migration, and growth cone outgrowth [41]. In contrast to the activating pathways discussed above, this inhibitory pathway is believed to
inhibit cancer cell migration. Mutations that abolish the

R-Ras GAP activity of Plexin-B1 in cell lines promote
cell adhesion, motility and invasion [42] (Figure 4).

6. High expression of Sema4D is a poor
prognostic factor in soft tissue sarcomas
Cumulative evidence regarding the roles of Sema4DPlexin-B1 interaction in tumor progression came from
in vitro and in vivo studies. A recent clinical study on
soft tissue sarcomas revealed that higher Sema4D
expression was correlated with higher mitotic counts,
cellularity, a higher necrosis ratio and Ki-67 index [30],
suggesting a proliferative advantage in tumors with
higher Sema4D expression. Accordingly, higher Sema4D

expression is associated with poorer overall survival and
disease-free survival [30] (Table 1). Similarly, via activation by Plexin-B1, Sema4D-expressing CD38+ B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells have better viability
and a higher proliferative rate [43].

7. Clinical studies offer insights into the role of
Plexin-B1 in human oncogenesis
Recently clinical studies have also provided further
insights into the significance of Plexin-B1 in human
cancers (Table 1.). In human breast cancers, gene
expression microarray analysis showed that low PlexinB1 expression was associated with high histologic grading, ErbB-2 over-expression and a high proliferative
index in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. Low
Plexin-B1 expression also predicts poor outcome in
terms of disease-free survival in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers [44,45]. Similarly, Plexin-B1

expression is also down-regulated in renal cell carcinomas where 169 out of 209 carcinomas showed negativity
in a recent report. Reintroducing Plexin-B1 into the
renal adenocarcinoma cell line reduced the proliferative
rate [46]. These results imply a tumor suppressor role of
Plexin-B1 in oncogenesis.
In contrast, a recent study on human breast and ovarian cancers using immunohistochemistry showed that
co-expression of Plexin-B1 and Met was significantly
associated with a higher tumor grade and lymph node
metastasis. Met was activated in the presence of PlexinB1 expression in a majority of these cancers [47]. In
human prostate cancers, Plexin-B1 and Sema4D are
strongly associated and highly expressed compared to
the non-neoplastic tissue (77% versus 6% and 58% versus 3.5% respectively). Mutations in Plexin-B1 are frequently detected in primary and metastatic prostate
cancers [42]. Among the mutations, the more frequent

amino acid changes are mapped to the Rho GTPase
binding domain of Plexin-B1. Structural analysis
revealed a reduced Rho GTPase binding affinity in some
of these mutations [48]. In vitro studies showed that
these mutations impaired the R-RasGAP activity of
Plexin-B1, leading to increased cell adhesion, motility
and invasion [42]. These results instead suggest an
oncogenic nature of Plexin-B1. Interestingly, a recent
study on melanoma also revealed contradicting effects
of Plexin-B1 expression on cell migration: enhancement
in primary tumor cells but inhibition in metastatic
tumor cells [49].

8. Intrinsic and cooperative mechanisms
determine the overall signaling of Plexin-B1 in
tumor progression
Recognizing the fact that both the stimulatory and inhibitory domains coexist in the Plexin-B1 cytoplasmic
domain, we speculate that “intra-molecular” preferential
Plexin-B1 signaling pathways in cancers could constitute
a sound explanation to reconcile these conflicting clinical results of Plexin-B1 in tumor progression. Inhibitory
signals of Plexin-B1 would enable it to function as a
tumor suppressor gene as implied from the breast and
renal cancer studies [44-46]. In contrast, impairment in
the Plexin-B1 inhibitory pathway due to mutation,
together with over-expression of Plexin-B1 would allow
its stimulatory signals to prevail and act as an oncogene
such as in prostate cancer [42].
In addition, fine-tuning the inhibitory or stimulatory
downstream signaling of Plexin-B1 is possible through
the association with competing receptor tyrosine kinases
such as Met and ErbB-2, which in turn would deliver
additional signals. Although a recent study on human
breast and ovarian cancers implies that Plexin-B1 functions as an oncogene when coupled with Met activation
[47], involvement of ErbB-2 in this association has yet

to be addressed in clinical studies. The available in vitro
data, nonetheless, support the ErbB-2 instead of Met
coupling in determining the invasiveness of tumor cell
lines [39,40].

Conclusion and perspective
Although the interaction of Sema4D and Plexin-B1 has
profound physiologic effects in the immune and nervous
systems, emerging data suggests their involvement in
tumor progression and especially in tumor angiogenesis
where Sema4D acts as a proangiogenic factor via PlexinB1. Over-expression of Sema4D in tumor confers on the
tumor cells a selective proliferative advantage. Sema4D
might also influence via Plexin-B1 several functional
aspects of tumor-associated macrophages such as their
migratory capability and capability to induce tumor
angiogenesis. In contrast to responses elicited in nontumorous components such as endothelial cells and
macrophages, signaling through Plexin-B1 in various
cancers gives rise to seemingly contradicting responses,
as highlighted in this review. Current results suggest
that either the stimulatory or inhibitory signaling could
be induced via the respective stimulatory or inhibitory
domain in the Plexin-B1 molecule itself. This could also
be achieved via association with the competing receptor
tyrosine kinases such as Met and ErbB-2 (Figure 3 and
4). This double-checkpoint mechanism based on intrinsic and cooperative signaling signifies the complexity
and importance of Plexin-B1 signaling in tumor progression. Further studies will certainly solidify the basis for
these unique mechanisms.
