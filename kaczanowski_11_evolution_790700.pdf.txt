Evolution of apoptosis-like programmed cell
death in unicellular protozoan parasites
Szymon Kaczanowski1*, Mohammed Sajid2 and Sarah E Reece3

Abstract
Apoptosis-like programmed cell death (PCD) has recently been described in multiple taxa of unicellular protists,
including the protozoan parasites Plasmodium, Trypanosoma and Leishmania. Apoptosis-like PCD in protozoan
parasites shares a number of morphological features with programmed cell death in multicellular organisms.
However, both the evolutionary explanations and mechanisms involved in parasite PCD are poorly understood.
Explaining why unicellular organisms appear to undergo ‘suicide’ is a challenge for evolutionary biology and
uncovering death executors and pathways is a challenge for molecular and cell biology. Bioinformatics has the
potential to integrate these approaches by revealing homologies in the PCD machinery of diverse taxa and
evaluating their evolutionary trajectories. As the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in model organisms are well
characterised, and recent data suggest similar mechanisms operate in protozoan parasites, key questions can now
be addressed. These questions include: which elements of apoptosis machinery appear to be shared between
protozoan parasites and multicellular taxa and, have these mechanisms arisen through convergent or divergent
evolution? We use bioinformatics to address these questions and our analyses suggest that apoptosis mechanisms
in protozoan parasites and other taxa have diverged during their evolution, that some apoptosis factors are shared
across taxa whilst others have been replaced by proteins with similar biochemical activities.
Introduction
Apoptosis-like programmed cell death (PCD) has been
described in multiple taxa of unicellular protists, including the protozoan parasites Plasmodium [1,2], Trypanosoma [3,4] and Leishmania [5]. PCD in protists appears
to share some morphological features with apoptosis in
multicellular organisms, including chromosomal condensation, nuclear DNA fragmentation, cell shrinkage, loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential, formation of
apoptotic bodies, and the externalisation of phosphatidylserine [2,4]. However, without knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the apoptosis-like PCD of
parasites, it is unclear which markers are expected to be
observed and under which conditions. Apoptosis in multicellular organisms is initiated in response to a wide variety of stress factors, ranging from cell senescence to
oxidative damage [6,7], and is executed by the activation
of the caspase family of cysteine proteases [8]. Although
apoptosis-like PCD in unicellular organisms can also be

initiated by a variety of stresses [4,5,9] and the morphological features (diagnostics) are similar across multicellular
and unicellular taxa [2,4,9], much of the molecular
machinery of unicellular organisms appears to differ. For
example, canonical caspases are encoded only in the
Metazoan genomes [10-12].
This mixture of similarities in the basic features of
apoptosis but key differences in the underlying mechanisms across taxa has resulted in controversy over whether
apoptosis, or a form thereof, is actually the process being
observed in protozoan parasites. This controversy must
be resolved as the possibility of manipulating cell death
pathways in parasites may offer a new avenue for disease
control. Empirical tests of gene function have made progress in identifying some the molecules involved in
executing apoptosis, and bioinformatics offers a complimentary approach to integrate these results across taxa.
Bioinformatic comparisons of multicellular model systems, protozoan parasites, and their free-living relatives
can reveal candidate genes that encode proteins with
similar function across taxa with different modes of life,
and reveal the extent of conservation or divergence in
their sequences. Here, we use a bioinformatics approach

to identify initiators and executioners of cell death that
appear to be shared between protozoan parasites and
multicellular taxa. This type of analysis can aid functional
studies in the search for possible drug targets and can
also shed light on whether these shared mechanisms
have arisen through convergent or divergent evolution,
which is necessary to inform studies asking ‘why’ such
traits have evolved.
Understanding the evolutionary and ecological pressures shaping the expression of apoptosis-like PCD in
protozoan parasites is also central to the success of interventions targeting this trait. The evolution and ecology of
apoptosis-like PCD in protozoan parasites is addressed in
Pollitt et al. [13], but briefly: natural selection is predicted
to favour genotypes (clones) in which some parasites
undergo apoptosis if it increases the transmission of their
clone-mates (kin). This hypothesis predicts that parasites
should employ apoptosis according to their relatedness
and in line with changes in their density. For example, a
parasite genotype (a group produced through clonal
expansion) may benefit from reducing its proliferation
rate if uncontrolled replication is likely to result in premature death of its host or vector. In a situation when an
infection is composed of close kin (i.e. clone-mates), the
parasites that die may facilitate the transmission (fitness)
of their relatives and indirectly pass on shared genetic
information by being prudent. However, if an infection
contains multiple, unrelated, co-infecting genotypes, then
the benefits of PCD are shared across all genotypes. In
this situation, if parasites were to undergo PCD they
would be helping unrelated competitors - which is not a
strategy favoured by natural selection.
Recent empirical work suggests that Plasmodium
parasites, like bacteria, are capable of coordinating behaviours as a clonal group and alter their reproductive
strategies in response to changes in both relatedness
and density [13-17]. If the expression of apoptosis-like
PCD is influenced by relatedness and density then identifying the mechanisms underpinning this trait could
also reveal how parasites co-ordinate their social behaviour. However, testing whether apoptosis-like death in
single-celled organisms per se is challenging and to date,
few studies provide supportive data (reviewed in [18]).
Alternatively, apoptosis in single-celled organisms could
potentially be an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of some cellular processes (such as ageing [18]).
In this case, identifying the molecules involved in apoptosis- like PCD could reveal genes associated in pleiotropic interactions. As the same selection pressures may
not necessarily be involved in both the evolution and
maintenance of apoptosis-like death, within and across
parasite taxa, the identification of machinery involved in
the initiation and execution of death is required.

Apoptosis in multicellular organisms

During apoptosis in multicellular organisms, the cell activates suicide machinery that culminates in chromosomal
condensation and nuclear DNA fragmentation [19,20]. In
mammals, the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated by
permeabilisation of the mitochondrial membrane [21,22]
and release of the mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome c
[23], apoptosis induction factor (AIF) [24] and endonuclease G (EndoG) into the cytoplasm [25]; activation of
the cysteine endoprotease family of caspases is key in the
catabolic execution of apoptosis [8]. Cytochrome c, AIF
and caspases activate nucleases. In plants, apoptosis is also
activated by the release of factors from the mitochondria
(though cytochrome c seems not to be involved), which
results in chromatin condensation and DNA degradation
[26]. Plants do not contain canonical caspases, but their
orthologues in the metacaspase family fulfil this role.
Interestingly, plant metacaspases have different substrate
specificities compared to mammalian caspases but they
still exhibit a biological activity akin to caspases that
results in apoptosis [26,27].
Apoptosis like PCD in unicellular organisms

Physical and chemical stresses have been shown to initiate apoptosis in a variety of free living unicellular organisms, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [9] and
the freshwater algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [28].
Many of the elements of the apoptosis network of yeast
are similar to those described previously in mammals
[29,30]. This includes translocation of the mitochondrial
proteins AIF [31], EndoG [32] and cytochrome c [33] to
the cytoplasm, where their modes of action resemble
those of their mammalian counterparts. Like plants,
yeast cells express the caspase-homologues, metacaspases [10,11]. The disruption of yeast metacaspases
abrogates hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis, whereas
over-expression of metacaspases increases hydrogen
peroxide-induced proteolytic activity of metacaspase,
resulting in apoptosis [10]. Apoptosis also occurs in
free-living unicellular ciliated protists during conjugation. For example, in Tetrahymena thermophila, the parental macronucleus is selectively eliminated from the
cytoplasm by an apoptosis-like process [34].
Apoptosis like PCD in parasites

Compared to apoptosis in model organisms, understanding of PCD mechanisms in parasitic organisms remains
limited. However, studies have revealed apoptosis markers
in diverse parasite taxa, including Trypanosomes [3,4],
Leishmania [5], and Plasmodium [1,2,35,36]. Typical features of apoptosis-like cell death are observed in these
organisms, such as cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation or
DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-family proteases

Kaczanowski et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:44
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/44

and accumulation of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm [2,4].
Apoptosis can be induced using a variety of agents, such
as drugs or oxidative stress resulting from hydrogen peroxide [4,5] or naturally occurring nitric oxide donors [35].
Rates of apoptosis have been quantified for Plasmodium
parasites [1,2,13] - in P. berghei up to 50% of parasites in
the mosquito midgut (ookinetes) undergo apoptosis [1].
However, there is considerable variation in the timing
and proportion of ookinetes positive for apoptosis, both
across species and according to the markers used [13].
The functions of just two apoptosis factors of unicellular
protozoans, AIF of Tetrahymena [37] and EndoG of trypanosomatids [38], have been experimentally confirmed.
Whilst such studies offer an elegant way to experimentally
determine the functions of gene products, this can be
complicated if molecules are involved in multiple regulatory pathways or are only active under certain situations.
Furthermore, the complexity of apoptosis induction and
execution mechanisms in other taxa, may suggest that
multiple pathways are also involved in protozoa.
Apoptosis executors: caspases

Biochemical experiments suggest that proteases are activated during apoptosis in Plasmodium [2] and trypanosomatid parasites of the genus Leishmania [39]. However, it
is not clear which proteases are central to the execution
of apoptosis-like cell death. Although the genomes of
these parasites do not encode ‘classical’ caspases, they
encode the close family members, metacaspases [40,41],
as do other non-mammalian eukaryotes [10,11,26,27]; the
metacapases, like the true caspases, belong to family C14
with the clan CD cysteine proteases [42]. It has been suggested that metacaspases can carry out a functionally
analogous biological roles to metazoan caspases, and
although data are scarce, they have been linked to programmed cell death in plants and yeast [10,11,26,27].
Whether metacaspases are directly involved in protozoan
apoptosis remains unclear as evidence for their involvement is controversial, for the reasons outlined below.
First, whilst vertebrate caspases have specificity for Asp
and P1, to date, no characterised cysteine protease from
protozoan parasites has the same P1 preference; indeed,
where studied, metacaspases, including the plant metacaspases, have an Arg and/or Lys specificity at P1. Secondly, Trypanosoma brucei possesses five metacaspase
genes. Two of them (MCA1 and MCA2) lack a predicted
active site cysteine and so are probably not active
cysteine proteases [43]. A triple null mutant lacking the
active metacaspases was isolated after sequential gene
deletions but activation of apoptosis programs was still
observed in this mutant. These experiments demonstrate
that metacaspases are not solely involved in the apoptosis-like cell death of trypanosomatids [44]. Thirdly, Plasmodium parasites possess three metacaspases. Addition

of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk to Plasmodium berghei results in a reduction of apoptotic ookinetes, and
also an increase in the number of oocysts in the mosquito midgut [1]. However, the use of probes designed
for mammalian cells, such as Z-VAD-fmk, at high concentrations could result in the inhibition of cysteine proteases other than metacaspases. Such an off- target effect
could be further compounded by the small hydrophobic
residue, Ala, at P2 of Z-VAD-fmk as it has a preference
for papain family cysteine proteases [45]. Studies of Plasmodium berghei metacaspase 1 reveal that this protein is
expressed in female gametocytes and in all mosquito
stages, including the midgut stages. However, when
PbMC1 was deleted the authors failed to detect a phenotype related to apoptosis [46] though they did not
observe apoptosis-like cell death in their wild-type control line either. The picture is further complicated by the
suggestion that MC1 deletion is involved in elevating
parasite density, but not via prevention of apoptosis [13].
In general, knowledge of evolutionarily conserved substrates of caspase-family proteases involved in apoptosis is
still very limited. In fact, TSN (Tudor Staphylococcal
Nuclease) a nuclease involved in the process of RNA
splicing, is the only well-known substrate of apoptosis proteases of higher plants and mammals [27]. Caspasemediated proteolysis of TSN is important for the progress
of apoptosis because inactivation of TSN expression in
plant [27] and human cells [27] leads to the induction of
the apoptosis program. Cleavage of TSN inhibits its activation of mRNA splicing and its ribonuclease activity and
this is an important role in the execution of apoptosis.
Identifying the substrates of protozoan metacapases would
provide another approach for functional studies to assess
the role of metacaspases in apoptosis. To address this, we
used BLASTP [47] to detect homologues of TSN in the
genomes of protozoan parasites and found homologues
of this protein across trypanosomatids and Apicomplexa
(e-values < 5.1e-54). Specifically, we recovered the following putative TSN nucleases (top blast hits) in: L. major
(uniprot ID Q4Q5I7_LEIMA), T. cruzii (uniprot ID
Q4DY53_TRYCR), P. falciparum (plasmodb PF11_0374),
and T. gondii (uniprot ID B6KG97_TOXGO). We suggest
that as TSN proteins are substrates of animal caspases and
plant metacaspases, they may be also substrates of apoptosis proteases in protozoan parasites.
Apoptosis executors: nucleases

As previously mentioned, nucleosomal fragmentation of
DNA is classical hallmark of apoptosis in metazoan systems [19,20]. DNA fragmentation is caused by apoptosis
nucleases, which cut nuclear DNA during the apoptosis
program. The putative primary target of DNases is parasitic plasmids and viruses of bacteria. This hypothesis is
supported by the fact that close homologous proteins of

Kaczanowski et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:44

Page 4 of 8

nucleases (for example EndoG [25,32,38], ZEN1 [48],
NUC1 [49]) are present in bacterial genomes. Many
types of DNases involved in apoptosis have been identified in different species. Table 1 presents the results of
our BLAST homology searches for homologues of different apoptosis nucleases, which are discussed below.
One of the best-known apoptosis nuclease is the mammalian caspase-activated DNase, or CAD [50]. CAD is
found in a complex with its inhibitor protein, ICAD, also
called DNA fragmentation factor 45 [51]. It has been
shown that cleavage of this inhibitor by caspases activates
apoptotic degradation. As shown in Table 1, homologues
of CAD and ICAD are present in only some animal genomes. Another well-described apoptosis nuclease is
endonuclease G [25,32,38], a mitochondrial DNase that
is released from the mitochondria during apoptosis.
Experimental evidence indicates that the activity of this
protein is evolutionarily conserved in multicellular organisms, yeast and trypanosomatids [25,32,38]. As shown in
Table 1, EndoG is evolutionarily conserved in the majority of eukaryotic systematic groups, including plants and
some Apicomplexa. Surprisingly, there are no obvious
orthologues in Plasmodium species. It is well known that
the Plasmodium genome is difficult to work with using
bioinformatic approaches (see [52]) so we confirmed this
result using PFAM domain analysis [53,54]. The endonuclease NS domain (PFAM ID PF01223) is typical for
EndoG protein and is not detected in known Plasmodium proteomes.
This observation suggests that deletion of EndoG
occurred during the evolution of Plasmodium parasites

from other Apicomplexa, suggesting that Plasmodium
parasites must have other apoptosis nucleases. Another
typical apoptosis DNase in animal taxa is NUC1 [49].
As shown in Table 1, NUC1 is encoded in the genome
of Tetrahymena but not in protozoan parasites. In addition to EndoG, ZEN1 is a key apoptosis DNase in
plants, [48]. As shown in Table 1, homologues of ZEN1
are present in protists but not in animals or fungi.
ZEN1 is a putative apoptosis DNase of parasitic unicellular protists. We suggest that this enzyme may be
active during apoptosis in Plasmodium parasites, which
have neither EndoG nor NUC1 homologues. These
results also suggest the hypothesis that the apoptosis of
protozoan parasites is more similar to apoptosis processes in plants than animals. However, it is also interesting to note that trypanosomatids have homologues of
both Zen1 and EndoG.
Apoptosis induction factor

AIF (apoptosis induction factor) is a mitochondrial flavoprotein [24], first characterised in mammalian cells. It has
been shown that AIF is sufficient to induce the apoptosis
of isolated nuclei and that during apoptosis this protein
translocates to the nucleus. Microinjection of AIF into the
cytoplasm induces the condensation of chromatin, the
digestion of DNA and the dissipation of the mitochondrial
transmembrane. It can also function as an electron transferase through a similar mechanism to ferredoxin reductases in bacteria [55]. The pro-apoptosis activity of AIF
does not require the cofactor FAD or caspase activity.
More recently, apoptotic degradation of DNA induced by

AIF has been observed in the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans [56] and in the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum [57]. A very recent paper shows [37] that AIF is also
an apoptosis induction factor in the free-living ciliate protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. Disruption of AIF
delays normal nuclear apoptosis and nuclear condensation. In this case, AIF also translocates from the mitochondria to the macronucleus during nuclear apoptosis. These
observations suggest that AIF-mediated programmed cell
death is a phylogenetically primitive form of apoptosis
conserved in multicellular organisms and protozoa. We
used BLAST homology searches to detect homologues of
AIF genes in the genomes of parasitic protists. Our phylogenetic analysis, shown in Figure 1, indicates that orthologues of AIF are encoded in the genomes of Apicomplexa
but not in the genomes of trypanosomatids. It also indicates that homologues of AIF encoded by genomes of trypanosomatids are more closely related to other proteins
than to AIF, suggesting there are no orthologues of AIF in
trypanosomatids.

to understand how it is regulated. For example, apoptosis
is not always an irreversible process, and apoptosis can
interact with other forms of cell death such as autophagy.
In mammals, apoptosis can be induced via the activation
of death signalling complexes [40]. These include ligands
(for example TNF), receptors (for example FAS, TNFR1)
and adaptors such as TRAF and MATH. The majority of
these proteins have no obvious orthologues outside multicellular organisms [see [40] for a review], but detection
of evolutionarily relationships between animals and unicellular homologous signalling proteins requires very
sensitive tools for domain analysis [40]. However, it is
also possible that mechanisms for the regulation of apoptosis are less evolutionarily conserved than the machinery
involved in execution of apoptosis. If different circumstances elicit an apoptosis response in different parasite
species, then a variety of regulatory mechanisms might
be required, but could signal to the same execution
machinery.
Another key gap in understanding apoptosis is how
cells decide whether or not to initiate programmed
death. For example, nutrient sensing pathways [58] are
well understood and could provide signals to initiate programmed death via autophagy in response to starvation.

If apoptosis-like PCD is analogous to suicide, evolutionary theory predicts that it should be conditionally
initiated in response to the density and relatedness of
parasites within the infection (reviewed in [13]). If so,
how do individual parasite cells detect this information
and determine if their circumstances merit apoptosis or
proliferation? For example, are the stress factors known
to elicit apoptosis, actually detected by parasites to gather
information about density and relatedness? An obvious
parallel here is the regulation of social behaviours in bacteria, through quorum sensing [59]. Clonally related
groups of bacteria use quorum sensing to initiate density-dependent behaviours appropriate to their circumstances, including: secretion of antibiotics, production of
extracellular matrix and biofilm formation, emission of
light, and switches in mode of motility [59]. It is hard to
predict if such homologues have similar function in
eukaryotes because signaling and regulatory networks
evolve rapidly [60-62]. Therefore, whilst many genes
involved in quorum-sensing networks have been verified,
identifying homologues in the genomes of prokaryotic
and eukaryotic organisms is very challenging. Alternatively, recent work revealing receptors involved in density-dependent differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei
may provide a starting point in the search for densitydependent influences in apoptosis. The transmission of
trypanosomes to the tsetse fly requires differentiation
from “slender forms” to “stumpy forms” which circulate
in the host in G0 arrest, pre-adapted for transmission
[63]. The production of stumpy forms is density-dependent and involves a density-dependent signal (SIF), which
results in expression of transporters in the PAD family
that convey signals for environmental change [63]. However, our BLASTP searches did not identify homologous
proteins of these receptors in Plasmodium or Tetrahymena, supporting the suggestion that there is considerable variation in mechanisms regulating apoptosis-like
PCD within protozoan parasites.
Apoptosis- like PCD without mitochondria

Trichomonas vaginalis does not have mitochondria [64]
but instead has hydrogenosomes. Hydrogenosomes are
reduced both structurally and biochemically compared to
the classical mitochondria and recent studies suggest that
they share a common ancestry with mitochondria [64].
In T. vaginalis, apoptosis-like cell death can be induced
by treatment with pro-apoptosis drugs (caspase activators) or nutrient depletion in [65,66], and pancaspase
inhibitors are able to prevent apoptosis. DNA fragments
in canonical apoptosis have a defined length and are
detected with a typical electrophoretic ladder profile. In
contrast, T. vaginalis exhibits DNA fragmentation without a specific scale pattern and fragments are observed as
a smear.

We used bioinformatics to ask whether elements of
apoptosis machinery appear to be shared between mitochondrial and amitochondrial protozoan parasites, focussing on AIF, EndoG and cytochrome c using BLASTP
searches. When baker yeast cytochrome c (uniprot ID
CY1_YEAST) and human endonuclease G (uniprot ID
NUCG_HUMAN) were used as a query sequences the
best hits were detected with very low e-values (0.56 and
0.6), suggesting that homologoues of these proteins are
not present in T. vaginalis. However, when using Tetrahymena AIF, six strong hits were detected with e-values
smaller than 0.01. We then checked this result using reciprocal blast with our HT-SAS annotation server [67,68].
This reveals that putative AIF homologoues are more
closely related with bacterial flavoproteins, thioredoxin
reductase, nitric oxide reductase flavorubredoxin and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. We also detected homologues of
the apoptosis factors: DNases ZEN1, NUC1 (see Table 1)
and TSN (uniprot ID A2DM81_TRIVA; e-value 2.2e-34)
when using BLASTP homology searches in the uniprot
database. These analyses suggest that mitochondrial apoptosis factors are absent in T. vaginalis but that their function has been replaced by nuclear apoptosis factors.

Conclusions
Putative mechanism of apoptosis in unicellular protozoa

We suggest the following putative, general, mechanism of
apoptosis in most protozoan parasites. Apoptosis like
PCD is induced by caspase-family proteases and the
execution of apoptosis requires the release of EndoG and
AIF from the mitochondria. During apoptosis, cysteine
proteases similar to caspases cut molecules, including
those similar to TSN. Nucleosomal fragmentation is
caused by the apoptosis DNases ZEN1 and EndoG.
There are some differences in these mechanisms among
different taxa. EndoG has been lost in the Plasmodium
and ciliate lineages, and AIF has been lost from trypanosomatids. NUC1 is encoded only in the genomes of freeliving ciliates and not in those of protozoan parasites. In
parasites without mitochondria, such as T. vaginalis,
mitochondrial apoptosis machinery is replaced by nuclear
machinery.
Apoptosis of unicellular protozoa evolved due to
divergent evolution

We suggest that the mechanisms involved in apoptosis
of unicellular parasites are due to divergent evolution,
but processes and morphologies involved are similar
across animals, protists and fungi. For example, the
mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and EndoG,
induce apoptosis in different taxa, and as these proteins
are both involved in electron transport. We suggest that
their function in apoptosis-like death could be due to
co-option because it is unlikely that such a co-option

event would independently occur often during the evolution of the same set of proteins, and this may explain
why different inducers have evolved in different systematic groups. Another key stage in the execution of
apoptosis is fragmentation of nuclear chromatin by
apoptosis DNases. We suggest that over the course of
evolution, apoptosis enzymes have been replaced by
others with similar activities. For example, animals and
plants use different apoptosis DNases, and animals use
different proteases to fungi and plants. This gene replacement may explain the existence of apoptosis enzymes
and mechanisms in unicellular protists that are very different from those in those in other systematic groups.
This fact also highlights a limitation of comparative
genomics; in using this approach, the detection of divergent genes is possible, but traits and mechanisms that
arise through convergent evolution are hard to identify absence of evidence does not necessarily mean evidence
of absence.
