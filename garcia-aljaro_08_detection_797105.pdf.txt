Abstract
Background: Cell-to-cell communication (also referred to as quorum sensing) based on N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) is a widespread response to environmental change in Gram-negative
bacteria. AHLs seem to be highly variable, both in terms of the acyl chain length and in the chemical
structure of the radicals. Another quorum sensing pathway, the autoinducer-2-based system, is
present both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In this study the presence of signal
molecules belonging to both quorum sensing signalling pathways was analysed in the marine
symbiotic species Vibrio scophthalmi.
Results: Three AHL-like signal molecules were detected in V. scophthalmi supernatants with the
Agrobacterium tumefaciens sensor assay. This observation was further supported by the decrease in
the presence of these signal molecules after cloning and expression of lactonase AiiA from Bacillus
cereus in the V. scophthalmi strains. One of the signal molecules was identified as N-(3-hydroxy
dodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone. V. scophthalmi was also shown to carry a functional LuxS
synthase. The coding sequence for a luxS-like gene was obtained showing a maximum similarity of
78% with Vibrio vulnificus. Analysis of the translated sequence revealed that the sequenced luxS gene
carried the conserved domain, which is common to luxS sequences found in other species, and
which is essential for LuxS enzymatic activity.
Conclusion: The data are consistent with the presence of quorum-sensing signal molecules from
both AHL- and autoinducer 2-based quorum sensing systems in V. scophthalmi, which are
homologous to others previously described in various Vibrio species. How this bacterium interacts
with other bacteria and eukaryotic cells to compete ecologically with other intestinal bacteria
present in the fish Scophthalmus maximus warrants further investigation.

Background
Quorum sensing is an extensive system whereby bacteria
can communicate not only with members of their own
species, but also with other species to coordinate their
behaviour in response to population density, thereby

modulating the expression of specific genes in a population-density dependent manner. This phenomenon,
known as quorum sensing (the term proposed by [1],
relies on the production and sensing of one or more
secreted low-molecular-mass signal molecules, the extraPage 1 of 11

cellular concentration of which is related to the population density of the producing organism. Once the signal
molecule has reached a critical concentration, equivalent
to a certain cell density, the population elicits a particular
response. This mechanism has been demonstrated in various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, various biological functions have been shown to be
regulated by these molecules either directly or indirectly,
including bioluminescence in Vibrio species [2], the
expression of virulence factors (Erwinia sp., Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, E. coli O157:H7, Vibrio
cholerae) [3-7], and biofilm formation and swarming
motility in P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia [8,5], among others.
Two main types of quorum-sensing signalling pathways
have been described for Gram-negative bacteria: the acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-based system and the autoinducer 2-based system, which is described below. The first
AHL-based quorum-sensing system described was
involved in the control of bioluminescence in V. fischeri
via the LuxR/I system [9,10]. LuxI synthesizes the diffusible signal molecule N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine
lactone, which increases in concentration as the cell density increases. At a critical concentration, LuxR first binds
the signal molecule and then activates the expression of
target genes. Genes homologous with this system have
been found in several Gram-negative bacteria, although
N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) seem to be highly
variable, both in terms of the acyl chain length and in the
chemical structure of the radicals. Moreover, different
AHLs synthases have been described in different quorum
sensing signalling pathways. For instance, in V. harveyi a
3-hydroxy-C4-HSL is synthesized by the LuxM synthase
and received by luxN protein. The genes coding for these
proteins show no homology to the previously described
LuxR/I quorum sensing system. The complex quorum
sensing circuit also differ from other previously reported
systems as stated below [11]. It has also to be noted that
some bacteria have been shown to express enzymes that
are able to interfere with AHL-based quorum-sensing systems from other species: acylases, which remove the side
chain from the lactone ring from the AHLs by hydrolyzing
the connecting amide bond between the ring and the side
chain [12] and lactonases, which hydrolyze the lactone
ring of the AHLs [13].
On the other hand, bacteria have been shown to possess a
different mechanism for interspecies communication,
namely the LuxS (AI-2) system previously described [14].
The LuxS is an autoinducer synthase produced by many
diverse bacteria, including both Gram-negative and
Gram-positive species [14]. luxS encodes an S-ribosyl
homocysteinase, which converts S-ribosyl homocysteine
from the methyl cycle into homocysteine (which is then

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/138

returned to the active methyl cycle), as well as the autoinducer 2 [15], a borate diester of the cyclized 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione [16]. The AI-2 system has been
shown to regulate several physiological activities including pathogenicity (though the control of toxins and other
virulence expression factors), motility, biofilm formation,
antibiotic production, and bioluminescence, among others (see review [15]).
Vibrio scophthalmi belongs to the highly heterogeneous
Vibrionaceae family, which is comprised of 64 species,
including both free-living and symbiotic species characterized by mutualistic or pathogenic relationships [17]. V.
scophthalmi was first described in association with turbot
(Scophthalmus maximus), being the most abundant Vibrio
species found in intestinal bacterial populations [18]. It
has been shown that V. scophthalmi maintains host specificity, despite showing a different phenotype pattern in
15–57 day-old larvae [19]. This fact, together with the
finding that this organism is not the most abundant Vibrio
spp in those waters surrounding the fish, led us to hypothesise that the benefits of turbot gut colonization by V.
scophthalmi could be dependent upon a quorum-sensing
system that responded when a sufficient number of bacteria were present in the gut.
Some symbiotic species belonging to the Vibrionaceae
family have been shown to regulate bioluminescence
through a complicated network of quorum-sensing systems involving the lux genes. Homologues to the LuxR/I
system have been described for V. fischeri, V. anguillarum,
V. cholerae, V. logei and V. parahaemolyticus [20-23]. In V.
harveyi, the quorum-sensing as stated above, is a complex
circuit consising of a multichannel two-component phosphorelay signal transduction pathway. In this bacterium
the LuxR/I system is not present. Instead, the LuxM/N system works in parallel as well as the CqsA/S system with
the LuxS/PQ to regulate a transcriptional activator, LuxR
(not similar to other LuxR-type quorum-sensing proteins). [11]. Another complex quorum system was also
described in V. cholerae [24].
Here we study the quorum-sensing signal synthases in V.
scophthalmi, focusing on the two most common signal
molecules in Gram-negative bacteria described above
(AHLs and AI-2). The expression of AHLs was analyzed by
thin layer chromatography (TLC) using different AHL sensor strains. Recombinant V. scophthalmi strains expressing
an aiiA gene that coded for a lactonase were obtained and
the loss of AHL production investigated. The presence of
AI-2 synthase was analyzed by using the V. harveyi autoinducer bioluminescence bioassay [2] while the luxS gene,
which is known as the synthase for AI-2, was detected by
PCR and then sequenced.

Results and discussion
Identification of AHLs autoinducers
The V. scophthalmi strains A089 and A102 were grown
overnight in different growth media (mLB, mTSB, mPW,
and AB) and the supernatant was analysed for the presence of AHL-like molecules. Three different signal spots
were detected in the TLC assay performed with the A.
tumefaciens strain NTL4 (pZLR4) (Fig. 1a), which were not
present in the medium alone used as negative control,
suggesting the presence of three AHL-like molecules in the
supernatant of V. scophthami. The retention factor (Rf) of
the three AHL-like molecules was 0.62 (± 0.055), 0.46 (±
0.038) and 0.25 (± 0.018), from higher to lower Rf,
respectively, as a result of three independent experiments.
These three AHL-like molecules detected by the A. tumefaciens sensor strain were produced with any of the
employed growth medium: mLB, mTSB, mPW, and AB
(data not shown). Moreover, as shown on Fig. 1b, all
three molecules were detected by TLC in the mid-exponential growth phase and maintained over the stationary
phase.

In order to further characterise these molecules, different
AHL standards and different sensor strains, which have
been shown to detect previously described AHLs, were
used. The autoinducer bioassay for the detection of AHLs,
which employed the BB886 V. harveyi sensor strain,

B

showed no induction of the luminescence signal compared with the negative control. Neither signal was
detected with the Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 or the
Pseudomonas putida F117 (pAS-C8) and P. putida F117
(pKR-C12) sensor strains. This may be related to the varying sensitivities of these sensor strains to a wide range of
AHLs. The C. violaceum forward bioassay [25], detects
preferably short chain AHLs, preferably HHL, although it
has been also shown to detect 3 hydroxy-C6-HSL [26] but
not longer chain AHLs. The P. putida F117 (pAS-C8) sensor strain is sensitive to C8-HSL and P. putida F117 (pKRC12) is highly sensitive to C12-HSL, 3-oxo-C12-HSL,
C10-HSL, and 3 oxo-C10-HSL [27]. The fact that it was
not possible to detect any signal in the V. harveyi BB886
autoinducer bioassay suggests that the putative AHLs
from V. scophthalmi detected with the A. tumefaciens assay
are sufficiently different from that of V. harveyi to be recognised.
Chemical characterisation of the AHL-like molecules
Detailed analyses of the AHL-like molecules detected were
carried out exclusively with the strain V. scophthalmi A102,
since both strains presented the same TLC pattern. Two
different culture media, mTSB and mPW, were evaluated
for growing V. scophthalmi A102 in order to carry out the
extraction of AHLs. Due to the high background observed
with the mTSB medium, we decided to use the mPW cul-

ture medium. Only that extract corresponding to the
lower Rf spot resulted in a structure composition similar
to an AHL, which hypothetically corresponded to an N(3-hydroxy dodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (N-3hydroxy-C12-HSL). This molecule matched the empirical
formula C16H29NO4 + H+ with mass (m/z) 300.2167 and
an error of 0.39 ppm (see Fig. 2). As far as we know, this
constitutes the first description of an AHL in V. scophthalmi; moreover, it has proven different from those produced by other Vibrio species. It was not possible to
identify any recognizable AHL-like structures in the other
signalling spot extracts, even after carrying out four independent extraction experiments.

The high background levels caused by other molecules in
relation to the amount of AHL produced of the other two
putative AHLs may have hindered the detection of these
molecules. However it can not be discarded that these two
signalling spots that were detected with the A. tumefaciens
sensor strain, but not detected by HPLC coupled with
mass spectrometry, might indeed not represent AHLs but
AHL-derived or AHL-regulated molecules, that would
induce non-specifically the A. tumefaciens sensor strain,
since this sensor is known to be activated non-specifically.
Acylhomoserine lactone signal synthases have been studied in other Vibrio species. This species have been shown
to produce several AHLs, which are produced by different

a Mariner TOF MS, whose exact mass was later confirmed as m/z 300.2167 after HPLC and mass spectrometry with electrospray ionisation analysis. This molecule matched the empirical formula C16H29NO4 (with an error of 0.39 ppm) for M and
hypothetically corresponds to a molecular structure of a hydroxylated-C12HSL. A peak of 282.2256 was also observed which
could represent loss of OH group due to fragmentation of the molecule, and a 599.4826 peak, an aggregation of two molecules. Other peaks were originated from components of the medium used for growing the bacterium.

synthases: V. anguillarum (hexanoyl homoserine lactone
and 3-hydroxy-hexanoyl homoserine lactone synthesized
by VanM (homologous to the LuxM from V. harveyi) and
the 3-oxo-decanoyl homoserine lactone, synthesized by
VanI, a LuxI homologue) [26], V. fischeri (3-hydroxybutanoyl homoserine lactone, synthesized by LuxI, and
octanoyl homoserine lactone synthesized by AinS, a LuxM
homologue) [28], V. harveyi (3-hydroxy-butanoyl homoserine lactone, synthesized by LuxM) [11], V. vulnificus
(butanoyl homoserine lactone, 3-oxo-decanoyl homoserine lactone, 3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone, and
in minor amounts, hexanoyl homoserine lactone, 3-oxooctanoyl homoserine lactone, and 3-oxo-tetradecanoyl
homoserine lactone, synthesized by a LuxI homologue),
and V. salmonicida (3-oxo-hexanoyl homoserine lactone
and hexanoyl homoserine lactone, synthesized by a LuxI
homologue) [29].
Heterologous expression of aiiA in V. scophthalmi
In order to confirm the presence of AHLs, AHL-derived or
AHL-regulated substances in the supernatant of Vibrio
scophthalmi, the lactonase gene aiiA from the Bacillus cereus
strain A24 was subcloned into the pACYC184 plasmid
and then electroporated into E. coli DH5α. This plasmid
was subsequently transferred to the Vibrio strain by conjugation. We utilized two strains for those experiments
addressing heterologous expression: V. scophthalmi A089
and V. scophthalmi A102. As measured by both, diffusion
assays in agar plates and TLC, expression of the aiiA gene
in both strains reduced autoinducer accumulation (Fig.
3). We constructed a control strain by conjugating the
pACYC184 plasmid without the aiiA gene. As this control
strain showed no AHL reduction, we attributed the
decreased AHL production in recombinant strains to heterologous expression of the lactonase gene, confirming
that these three putative autoinducers possessed an AHLlike structure or were AHL-regulated.

This finding indicates not only that lactonase is expressed
in the Vibrio strains, but also that its activity results from
the hydrolysis of AHL lactone bonds, as has been reported
in other bacterial species [30]. We demonstrate that this
lactonase is able to degrade hydroxylated AHLs, such as N3-hydroxy-C12-HSL, thereby increasing its substrate spectrum. These findings are consistent with other studies that
have shown that lactonases from the Bacillus genus are
characterized by certain variability in their capacity to
degrade different AHLs [13]. This is true for the lactonase
from the B. cereus strain, which reduced the concentrations of C6-HSL, oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL from P. aeruginosa to non-detectable levels [4].
Detection of a LuxS synthase in Vibrio scophthalmi
The presence of LuxS activity in the supernatants from the

Two negative controls were included, consisting of the
incubation medium alone, and the medium with the sensor strain. Although we tested two different culture media,
mTSB and the mPW, the former was discarded due to the
fact that some of the components of the mTSB induced
the sensor strain producing a false positive reaction. As
shown in Fig. 4, the maximum induction level for the
reporter strain was obtained in those supernatants from V.
scophthalmi A089 grown in mPW medium, which corresponded to the late logarithmic phase. Here, we recorded
a maximum induction value of 35% with respect to the
positive control used in this assay, V. harveyi BB120.

These molecules were likely to be synthesized by the AI-2
synthase LuxS, whose coding sequence was determined
for V. scophthalmi, and which exhibited a maximum similarity to the V. vulnificus luxS gene (78%). The coding
sequence consisted of 519 bp, which is common to other
luxS sequences from various Vibrio species. This sequence
was submitted to the GenBank database under the accession number [GenBank:EF363481]. A phylogenetic tree of
different Vibrio luxS sequences is shown on Fig. 5a. The
translated sequence revealed that the sequenced luxS gene
carried a conserved domain common to luxS sequences
found in other species, which is essential for LuxS enzymatic activity (Fig. 5b, sites 54–58, HTLEH). The sites
118–126, NKIPELNEY, representing a hypothetical phosphorylation site [31], was also conserved. This domain
has already been detected in luxS homologous sequences
from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia sp.,
and Shigella sonnei, among others [31]. All of these findings support the contention that V. scophthalmi possesses
a functional LuxS synthase.

Conclusion
This study confirms the presence of quorum-sensing signal molecules in V. scophthalmi from the AHL-based and
type 2 (AI-2)-based systems. How this bacterium interacts
with other bacteria and eukaryotic cells to compete ecologically with other intestinal bacteria present in the fish
Scophthalmus maximus warrants further investigation. In
this way, in vivo and in vitro analyses will be needed, so

Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are
listed in Table 1. All strains were grown at 30°C, agitated
at 180 rpm in LB for Escherichia coli, or modified (i.e., the
same medium with a final concentration of 2% NaCl) TSB
(mTSB) (Difco, Barcelona, Spain) or LB (mLB) [32] for
Vibrio strains, unless otherwise stated. In order to detect
AHLs, different media were used for growing V. scophthalmi, mTSB, mLB, AB (autoinducer bioassay medium
[2], and modified peptoned water (mPW) (i.e., peptone
water containing 2% NaCl (w/v)). When necessary, the
concentration of the antibiotics used was as follows: 25
μg/ml tetracycline, 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 25 μg/
ml chloramphenicol for counter selecting Vibrio recombinants and E. coli, respectively, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin
for E. coli. TCBS medium (Oxoid S.A., Madrid, Spain) was
used for selection of specific Vibrio strains.
Detection of AHLs by thin layer chromatography (TLC)
AHLs were extracted as follows: for analytical TLC, 5 ml
free-cell overnight cultures of the relevant strains were
mixed 1:1 with acidified ethyl acetate. The solvent phase
was recovered with a pipette and residual water in the
extract was eliminated by adding anhydrous magnesium
sulphate. The extract was then filtered through a Whatman paper 3 MM, dried with nitrogen flux air, and resuspended in 20 μl of ethyl acetate. For preparative TLC, we
used the same procedure except that the extract was rotary
evaporated instead of nitrogen air-dried.

The presence of AHLs in the extracts was tested by C18
reverse-phase TLC (Uniplate RPS Reverse-Phase Hydrocarbon Impregnated Silica Gel; Analtech, Sigma-Aldrich, Barcelona, Spain) using methanol/water (60:40, v/v) [33].
Different QS-sensor strains were employed to test for the
presence of AHLs (Table 1). Briefly, the plates were dried
and overlaid with 50 ml of soft agar; LB for C. violaceum,
and AB for A. tumefaciens, containing 20 ml of an overnight culture of the corresponding sensor strain to give a
final concentration of 0.7% agar (w/v). For A. tumefaciens,
gentamicin (30 μg/ml) and X-Gal (80 μg/ml) were added.
The plates were incubated for 24 h at 30°C; the emergence
of blue spots was considered a positive signal for the presence of AHLs [34]. For Pseudomonas putida sensor strains
(Table 1) LB with 25 μg/ml gentamicin was used instead.
The presence of AHLs was determined by emission of fluorescence that was detected by illumination with blue
light by using an HQ 480/40 filter (AHF-Analysentechnik) in combination with an halogen lamp as a light
source in a dark box equipped with a light sensitive cam-

Pentax CCTV camera lens and an HQ 535/20 filter.
Identification of AHL molecules
Extracts were prepared from 1 l of overnight-free-cell culture supernatant extracted with ethyl-acetate, as described
above. It was then concentrated to 1 ml by rota-evaporation. TLC was subsequently carried out and the signalling
spots were analyzed separately by cutting off the silica
from the plates and extracting the AHLs in 1 ml of ethylacetate. The silica was then discarded and the solvent
phase was resuspended in 0.5 ml of methanol prior to
analysis.

Identification of AHLs was carried out at the "Serveis Cientifico-Tècnics" of the University of Barcelona by HPLC coupled with Mass Spectrometry and Electrospray Ionisation
using an API™ – Mariner TOF device (Applied Biosystems)
based on the protocol described previously [35].
Empirical formula confirmation
Confirmation of the AHL formula was performed at the
"Unitat d'Espectrometria de Masses" of the University of Barcelona. The system used consisted of an Agilent LC/MSD
TOF coupled to an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC. The TOF
was equipped with a dual-nebulizer electrospray source,
which allows continuous introduction of an internal ref-

erence mass compound at a low concentration for automatic internal mass calibration. The instrument scanned
from 100 to 1000 m/z. This range included two reference
mass compounds: Purine m/z: 121.050873 and HP-0921
m/z: 922.009798. Resolution 10000 at m/z: 922.009798.
Instrumental parameters were as follows: Positive ESI
Capillary 4 KV; Fragmentor 215 V; Gas temperature:
300°C, Nebulizer gas (N2) 15 p.s.i. (1 p.s.i. = 6.9 kPa),
drying gas (N2) 7 l min-1.1 μl of the sample, extracted as
indicated above, was pumped into the source at a flow
rate of 0.2 ml/min with a mixture of H2O:CH3CN 1:1 1%
(v/v) formic acid as eluent. Spectra from the appropriate
chromatogram were averaged and the suspected molecular ion was then selected (m/z: 300.2170). Possible formulas were determined by using the elemental
composition calculator built into the data analysis software, and applying constraints on the elemental composition.
DNA isolation and nucleotide sequencing
Plasmid DNA was isolated with the Qia Prep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, California, United States).
Genomic DNA was isolated with the Qiagen DNA Blood
Kit (Qiagen). DNA sequencing was performed with the
Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit
3.1 (Applied Biosystems).

Cloning of the aiiA gene on the broad host-cloning vector
pACYC184
The aiiA gene from the Bacillus cereus A24 strain, coding
for a lactonase, was subcloned from the pME6860 plasmid onto the pACYC184 plasmid [36], following a variation of the method previously described [4]. Briefly, the
aiiA gene was amplified by PCR (3 min at 95°C; 21 cycles
of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 50°C, 2 min at 72°C; 10 min
at 72°C) from the DNA plasmid pME6860. The primers
used for this amplification were designed as follows: aiiAF-Bam:
ACgTggATCCCgCAggATCCATATgACAgTAAAgAAgCTT and aiiA-R-Sal: gCTggTCgACCgTCgACTATATATATTCAgggAA. Restriction sites for BamHI and
SalI are underlined and the ribosome-binding site is written in bold. The PCR product was subcloned into the
pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega, Barcelona, Spain) following the manufacturer's instructions. E. coli strains carrying
the vector construction were screened on LB plates containing 100 μg ampicillin ml-1 (Sigma Aldrich) and 50 μg
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactosidase (X-Gal)/
ml (Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain) used for the blue-white
selection. The resulting plasmid was electroporated into E.
coli DH5α. The pACYC184-aiiA vector was constructed by
cloning the aiiA gene from the pGEM-T-easy vector by
sequentially cleaving with the BamHI and SalI restriction
enzymes and ligating into the pACYC184 vector [37]. The
aiiA gene was then sequenced in both strands to ensure
that no mutations had occurred during the PCR reaction.
The construct pACYC184-aiiA expressed aiiA from the vectors' constitutive tetracycline promoter.
Conjugative plasmid transfer
Plasmids were delivered to Vibrio strains by triparental
mating as previously described [38], using the helper
strain E. coli HB101 (pRK2073), the donor strain E. coli
(pACYC184-aiiA), and the Vibrio scophthalmi recipient
strain A089 and A102. TCBS medium supplemented with
10 μg/ml chloramphenicol was used for counter selection
of donor, helper, and untransformed recipient cells. The
plates were incubated overnight and yellow colonies were
selected and tested for the presence of the plasmid and the
aiiA gene using the primers and conditions described
above. Two recombinant strains were selected for further
study: V. scophthalmi A089-aiiA and V. scophthalmi A102aiiA. To confirm that the transconjugants were V. scophthalmi, sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was also performed using the universal primers previously described
[39].
Effects of aiiA gene expression on recombinant strains
The effects of lactonase aiiA expression on the AHL accumulation levels in recombinant strains was analyzed visually by inducing the A. tumefaciens sensor strain by AHLmolecules separated by TLC, as described above. Growth
kinetic analysis were also performed with the V. scoph-

thalmi A089 and A102 strains, as well as the respective
recombinants carrying the pACYC184-aiiA plasmid and
the pACYC184 plasmid alone
Bioluminescence assay for detecting AHL (AI-1) and
autoinducer 2 (AI-2) quorum-sensing signal molecules
An overnight culture of V. scophthalmi was prepared and
inoculated into fresh medium (1:100) in a final volume of
200 ml and incubated with agitation at 30°C, taking a 5ml aliquot every hour in order to analyze the kinetics of
autoinducer production. The absorbance of the culture
was measured at 600 nm, centrifuged, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore Corporation, Barcelona, Spain) and kept at -20°C until
analysis. V. harveyi indicator strains BB886 (sensor AI-1;
sensor AI-2 defective) and BB170 (sensor AI-1 defective,
sensor AI-2), as well as the positive control BB120 (AI-1
producer; AI-2 producer) [2], were used to detect the presence of autoinducers in the culture supernatants. Induction of the sensor strain was measured using a Lambda
Fluoro 320 Plus reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski,
Vermont, USA) and evaluated with the KC4 software (BioTek, Instruments, Winooski, Vermont, USA). The results
are expressed as the fold induction of the reporter strain
over background when buffer or medium alone was
added to the reporter. All assays were repeated at least
three times.
LuxS detection and sequencing of the gene
The presence of a LuxS-like molecule in the V. scophthalmi
A089 strain was assessed by detection of LuxS activity following the bioluminescence method previously described
[40] using the media and culture conditions stated in the
previous section. Detection of the luxS gene was also performed by PCR. To this end, a set of degenerate primers
was designed based on the sequence of previously
reported luxS gene sequences recorded in the GenBank
database with the following accession numbers: V. vulnificus [GenBank:NC_004459], V. parahaemolyticus [GenBank:BA000031], V. alginolyticus [GenBank:AY391122] V.
harveyi [GenBank: GenBank:AF120098], and V. fischeri
[GenBank:NC_006840]. The sequences of these primers
within the luxS gene were as follows: LuxSF15'ATGCCWTTRYTVGAYAG 3' and LuxSR2-5' TCRTCRTTYTTRTTHAC 3'. The PCR conditions were as follows: 5
min at 95°C; 35 cycles: 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 45°C, 1
min at 72°C; 10 min at 72°C. Two amplimers were
obtained, and that which presented a similar size to the
control strain was sequenced as described above. The similarity to the previously reported luxS sequences was then
analyzed. In order to obtain the complete coding
sequence of the gene, we designed an inverted PCR. For
this purpose, genomic DNA was digested overnight with
an NstI restriction enzyme (Promega) and ligated with T4DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The resulting ligated DNA mole-

cules were amplified using a new set of primers: the
LuxSF3 5' GAGCTGAATGAATACCA 3', designed from the
previously sequenced amplimer, and a newly degenerated
primer based on the sequences described above, LuxSR1
5' CCCATHGGYGADATATC 3'. The same PCR conditions
were used except that the annealing temperature was set at
50°C. The resulting amplimer was sequenced using the
same primers described above (LuxSF3 and LuxSR1), producing an overlapping sequence to the amplimer previously obtained, which allowed us to sequence the entire
gene (519 bp). The complete gene sequence was confirmed by PCR using the primer previously described
LuxSF1
and
primer
LuxSRseq,
5'-TTAATCGACGCGAAGCTCAT 3', which was located downstream
from the luxS gene coding sequence deduced from the
obtained sequence.
