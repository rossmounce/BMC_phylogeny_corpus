Abstract
Background: The origin of the translation system is, arguably, the central and the hardest problem in the study of the
origin of life, and one of the hardest in all evolutionary biology. The problem has a clear catch-22 aspect: high translation
fidelity hardly can be achieved without a complex, highly evolved set of RNAs and proteins but an elaborate protein
machinery could not evolve without an accurate translation system. The origin of the genetic code and whether it evolved
on the basis of a stereochemical correspondence between amino acids and their cognate codons (or anticodons),
through selectional optimization of the code vocabulary, as a "frozen accident" or via a combination of all these routes
is another wide open problem despite extensive theoretical and experimental studies. Here we combine the results of
comparative genomics of translation system components, data on interaction of amino acids with their cognate codons
and anticodons, and data on catalytic activities of ribozymes to develop conceptual models for the origins of the
translation system and the genetic code.
Results: Our main guide in constructing the models is the Darwinian Continuity Principle whereby a scenario for the
evolution of a complex system must consist of plausible elementary steps, each conferring a distinct advantage on the
evolving ensemble of genetic elements. Evolution of the translation system is envisaged to occur in a compartmentalized
ensemble of replicating, co-selected RNA segments, i.e., in a RNA World containing ribozymes with versatile activities.
Since evolution has no foresight, the translation system could not evolve in the RNA World as the result of selection for
protein synthesis and must have been a by-product of evolution drive by selection for another function, i.e., the
translation system evolved via the exaptation route. It is proposed that the evolutionary process that eventually led to
the emergence of translation started with the selection for ribozymes binding abiogenic amino acids that stimulated
ribozyme-catalyzed reactions. The proposed scenario for the evolution of translation consists of the following steps:
binding of amino acids to a ribozyme resulting in an enhancement of its catalytic activity; evolution of the amino-acidstimulated ribozyme into a peptide ligase (predecessor of the large ribosomal subunit) yielding, initially, a unique peptide
activating the original ribozyme and, possibly, other ribozymes in the ensemble; evolution of self-charging proto-tRNAs
that were selected, initially, for accumulation of amino acids, and subsequently, for delivery of amino acids to the peptide
ligase; joining of the peptide ligase with a distinct RNA molecule (predecessor of the small ribosomal subunit) carrying a
built-in template for more efficient, complementary binding of charged proto-tRNAs; evolution of the ability of the
peptide ligase to assemble peptides using exogenous RNAs as template for complementary binding of charged proteotRNAs, yielding peptides with the potential to activate different ribozymes; evolution of the translocation function of the
protoribosome leading to the production of increasingly longer peptides (the first proteins), i.e., the origin of translation.
The specifics of the recognition of amino acids by proto-tRNAs and the origin of the genetic code depend on whether

or not there is a physical affinity between amino acids and their cognate codons or anticodons, a problem that remains
unresolved.
Conclusion: We describe a stepwise model for the origin of the translation system in the ancient RNA world such that
each step confers a distinct advantage onto an ensemble of co-evolving genetic elements. Under this scenario, the primary
cause for the emergence of translation was the ability of amino acids and peptides to stimulate reactions catalyzed by
ribozymes. Thus, the translation system might have evolved as the result of selection for ribozymes capable of, initially,
efficient amino acid binding, and subsequently, synthesis of increasingly versatile peptides. Several aspects of this scenario
are amenable to experimental testing.

Background
The Darwin-Eigen cycle, the emergence of biological
complexity, and the continuity principle
As first outlined by Darwin [1], the evolution of life is
based on the triad of heredity (the property of progeny to
resemble their parent(s)), variation (generation of variants as a result of errors during reproduction), and selection (differential reproduction of variants). The theory of
self-replicating systems that was developed, primarily, by
Eigen and coworkers in the 1970ies [3] revealed an important limit (hereinafter the Eigen threshold) on the relationships between the reproduction fidelity and the
amount of information contained in the system. Simply
put, if the product of the error (mutation) rate and the
information capacity (genome size) is safely below one
(i.e., less then one error per genome is expected to occur
per replication cycle), most of the progeny will be exact
copies of the parent, and reproduction of the system will
be sustainable. If, in contrast, this value is significantly
greater than one, most of the progeny will differ from the
parent, and the system will not possess sufficiently faithful heredity to reproduce itself; in other words, a system
whose fidelity drops below the Eigen threshold is headed
for collapse resulting from an error catastrophe (a term
and idea traceable to the early hypothesis of Orgel on the

possible contribution of translation errors to aging [4]). It
appears that the product of the replication fidelity and the
genome size of modern life forms, from RNA viruses to
complex eukaryotes, is, typically, close to the Eigen
threshold, indicating that evolution solves an optimization problem with respect to replication fidelity, information content of the genome, and, possibly, variation
(evolvability) [5].
Taking the replication process over the Eigen threshold is
required for sustainable replication and is, per force, a prerequisite for the start of biological evolution (Fig. 1).
Indeed, the very origin of the first organisms presents, at
least, an appearance of a paradox because a certain minimum level of complexity is required to make self-replication possible at all, and high-fidelity replication requires
additional functionalities that need even more information to be encoded. At the same time, the existing level of
replication fidelity limits the amount of information that
can be encoded in the genome [3,6,7]. What turns this
seemingly vicious circle into the (seemingly) unending
spiral of increasing complexity (the Darwin-Eigen cycle,
after Penny [8]) is a combination of natural selection with
genetic drift. Even small gains in replication fidelity are
advantageous to the system, if only due to the decrease of
the reproduction cost as a result of the increasing yield of
viable copies of the genome. In itself, a larger genome is
more of a liability than an advantage due to higher replication costs. However, moderate genome increase, e.g., by
duplication of parts of the genome, or by recombination,
can be fixed via genetic drift in small populations [9]. Replicators with a sufficiently high fidelity can take advantage
of such randomly fixed and, initially, useless genetic
material by evolving new functions, without falling off the
"Eigen cliff" (Fig. 1). Among such newly evolved, fitnessincreasing functions will be those that increase replication
fidelity which, in turn, allows further increase in the
amount of encoded information. And so the DarwinEigen cycle recapitulates itself in a spiral progression, leading to a steady increase in genome complexity (Fig. 2).

below). Hence the dramatic paradox of the origin of life:
in order to attain the minimal complexity required for a
biological system to get on the Darwin-Eigen spiral, a system of a far greater complexity appears to be required.
How such a system could evolve, is a puzzle that defeats
conventional evolutionary thinking, all of which is about
biological systems moving along the spiral; the solution is
bound to be unusual.

The crucial question on the origin of life is how did the
Darwin-Eigen cycle start, i.e., how was the minimal complexity attained that is required to achieve the minimally
acceptable replication fidelity. In even the simplest modern systems, such as RNA viruses with the replication
fidelity of only ~10-3, replication is catalyzed by a complex
protein replicase [10]. The replicase itself is produced by
translation of the respective mRNA(s) which is mediated
by a tremendously complex molecular machinery (see

The Darwin-Eigen cycle. The Darwin-Eigen cycle, driven, in
part, by selection and, in part, by drift, provides the path to
the increasing complexity in course of the evolution of biological systems.

The origin of complex biological systems is a classical
topic in evolutionary biology and, probably, the principal
object of attacks of anti-darwinists of all ilk, including the
notorious Intelligent Design movement. The gist of the
criticisms is that many biological systems are not just
complex but "irreducibly complex" and, as such, could
never evolve via the Darwinian mechanism of gradual,
stepwise adaptive change because intermediate stages of
evolution would have no selective value and so could not
be fixed. Darwin himself was perfectly aware of the problem and its dimensions and addressed it in one of the
most famous passages of the Origin, the one on the evolution of the vertebrate eye [1]. The solution offered by Darwin and developed ever since in numerous works of
evolutionary biology was straightforward in principle and
extremely ingenious when it came to details. Darwin
noticed that primitive eyes (or eye-like perceptive organs)
were found in a variety of animals and outlined a hypothetical, multistage scenario for the evolution of the eye in
which each simple, small step was selected for a particular
advantage it conferred onto the evolving organism. Darwin depicted the gradual complexification of the organ of
visual perception from a light-sensitive spot to a fullyfledged eye; in this example, the function of the organ,
while evolving, remained, in principle, the same. When
an evolutionary biologist strives to explain the origin of a
truly novel system that is seen only in its elaborately complex state and, at face value, appears to be irreducibly
complex, the task is much harder. Because evolution has
no foresight, no system can evolve in anticipation of
becoming useful once the requisite level of complexity is
attained. Instead, the evolving system must have a selectable function(s) distinct from the modern one, a possibility recognized by Darwin [1] and emphasized by Gould in
the concept of exaptation, that is, reassignment of function in the course of evolution [11,12]. In either case, the
general Darwinian principle applies: evolution must proceed via consecutive, manageable steps, each one associated with a demonstrable increase in fitness. Darwin did
not use a specific term for this crucial tenet of evolutionary
biology; we will call it the Continuity Principle, following
the recent insightful discussion of this issue by Penny [8].
The developments in the 150 years since Darwin taught us
to be more flexible about this principle than he was. It is
no longer prudent to demand, as Darwin did, that all evolutionary changes are "infinitesimal"; some genome mod-

Biology Direct 2007, 2:14

ifications may have had a substantial one time effect on
fitness, e.g., those that involve horizontal gene transfer,
gene loss, or genome rearrangement [13]. Furthermore, it
cannot be demanded that every change is selectively
advantageous because neutral or even slightly deleterious
mutations can be fixed by drift, especially, in small populations [9,14]. Nevertheless, these newly discovered factors of evolution, however important by themselves, are
but modifications of the Continuity Principle â evolution
of complex systems still needs to be deconstructed into
successive steps and explained in a Darwinian way.
We discussed the principles of evolution of complex biological systems at some length because they are most pertinent to the fundamental problem we wish to address
here: the origin of the translation system and the genetic
code. Indeed, the translation system might appear to be
the epitome of irreducible complexity because, although
some elaborations of this machinery could be readily
explainable by incremental evolution, the emergence of
the basic principle of translation is not. Indeed, we are
unaware of translation being possible without the
involvement of ribosomes, the complete sets of tRNA and
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), and (at least, for
translation to occur at a reasonable rate and accuracy) several translation factors. In other words, staggering complexity is inherent even in the minimally functional
translation system. Thus, as outlined above, it appears
that the evolutionary origin of translation is to be sought
along the exaptation route, i.e., by retrodiction of the
ancestral functions of various components of the translation system that would allow them to evolve functionalities enabling their recruitment for translation.
Even this, however, does not do the full justice to the difficulty of the problem. The origin of translation appears to
be truly unique among all innovations in the history of
life in that it involves the invention of a basic and highly
non-trivial molecular-biological principle, the encoding
of amino acid sequences in the sequences of nucleic acid
bases via the triplet code[15,16]. This principle, although
simple and elegant once implemented, is not immediately
dictated by any known physics or chemistry (unlike, say,
the Watson-Crick complementarity) and seems to be the
utmost innovation of biological evolution.
The obvious common wisdom is that a system as complex
as the translation machinery, even in its primitive state
(let alone the modern version, with its hundreds of RNA
and protein components â see below), could not have
emerged in one sweep. Such an abrupt emergence would
appear an outright miracle and an obvious violation of
the Continuity Principle. Elsewhere, one of us considers a
different worldview that might bring the chance emergence of complex (pre)biological systems, in particular,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

translation and replication, within the realm of the possible [17]. Here, however, we address the formidable problem of the origins of translation within the Continuity
Principle, by harnessing evidence from comparative analysis of the translation system components, theoretical and
experimental work on the hypothetical primordial RNA
world, and the experimental study of interactions between
amino acids and their codons and anticodons. After synthesizing the evidence from all these lines of enquiry, we
embark on evolutionary modeling, with its unavoidable
element of speculation, in an attempt to construct a
sequence of plausible, incremental stages each of which is
associated with a selective advantage to the evolving prebiological entities â in accordance with the Continuity
Principle.
Evolution of the translation system â the case for a
complex RNA world
The design of the translation system in even the simplest
modern cells (e.g., parasitic and endosymbiotic bacteria
and archaea, such as Carsonella, Mycoplasma, or Nanoarchaeon) is extremely complex. At the heart of the system is
the ribosome, a large complex of at least three RNA molecules and 60â80 proteins arranged in a precise spatial
architecture and interacting with other components of the
translation system in the most finely choreographed fashion [18-22]. These other essential components include the
complete set of tRNAs for the 20 amino acids (~40 tRNA
species considering the presence of isoacceptor tRNAs in
all species), the set of 18â20 cognate aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases (aaRS), and a complement of at least 7â8
translation factors. An extraordinary feature of the translation system is the conservation of its core across all modern cellular life forms. Indeed, of all functional categories
of proteins, translation is by far the most conserved one:
among the ~60 proteins that are represented by an
ortholog in every single cellular life form with a
sequenced genome, over 50 are components of the translation machinery [23]. Together with the universal conservation of ~30 RNA species [three rRNAs, the signal
recognition particle (SRP) RNA, and tRNAs of at least 18
specificities] and the virtual universality of the genetic
code, this proves that, the substantial differences between
the translation machineries of archaea (and the eukaryotic
cytosol) and bacteria (and the eukaryotic organelles) notwithstanding, the modern translation system is the best
preserved relic of the Last Common Universal Ancestor
(LUCA) of modern cellular life forms. Put another way,
the conservation of the core of the translation machinery
is the strongest available evidence that some form of
LUCA actually existed.

Given this extraordinary conservation of the translation
system, comparison of orthologous sequences reveals very
little, if anything, about its origins â because the emer-

Biology Direct 2007, 2:14

gence of the translation system is beyond the horizon of
the comparison of extant life forms. Indeed, comparativegenomic reconstructions of the gene repertoire of LUCA
point to a complex translation system including at least 18
of the 20 aaRS, several translation factors, at least 40 ribosomal proteins, and several enzymes involved in rRNA and
tRNA modification; thus, it appears that the core of the
translation system was already fully shaped in LUCA [24].
However, sequence and structure comparisons of protein
and RNA components of the translation system itself are
informative thanks to the extensive paralogy among the
respective genes. Obviously, when the origin of each of a
pair of paralogous genes antedates LUCA, the respective
duplication must have been an even earlier event, so
reconstruction of the scenario of such events opens a window into very early stages of evolution.
The story of the paralogous aaRS is particularly revealing.
The aaRS form two distinct classes of 10 specificities each,
with unrelated catalytic domains and distinct sets of accessory domains [25,26]. The catalytic domains of the class I
and class II aaRS belong to the Rossmann fold and the
biotin synthase fold, respectively. The analysis of the evolutionary histories of these protein folds has far-reaching
implications for the early evolution of the translation system and beyond. It has been shown that the catalytic
domains of the Class I aaRS form but a small twig in the
evolutionary tree of the Rossmann fold proteins; the
advent of the common ancestor of the aaRS is preceded by
a number of nodes along the evolutionary path from the
primitive, ancestral domain to the highly diversified state
that corresponds to LUCA [27,28]. The striking corollary
of this simple observation is that a substantial diversity of
Rossmann fold domains has evolved prior to the series of
duplications that led to the emergence of the aaRS of different specificities which, in turn, antedates LUCA. A very
similar evolutionary pattern is implied by the analysis of
the biotin synthase domain that gave rise to Class II aaRS
[29]. Thus, even within these two folds alone, a remarkable structural and functional complexity had been
attained before the fully-fledged RNA-protein machinery
of translation resembling the modern one has evolved.
The evolutionary analysis of the vast class of P-loop
GTPases, in which a variety of translation factors comprise
distinct, tight families, leads to essentially the same conclusions: in the succession of evolutionary bifurcations
(tree branchings) that comprise the history of the GTPase
domain, the translation factors are relatively late arrivals
[30]; not to be forgotten that the GTPases are but one of
the major branches of the P-loop fold [30]. This might
strike one as counter-intuitive but it is an inevitable conclusion from the comparative analysis of ancient paralogous relationship between proteins within the translation
system: with the interesting exception of the core ribosomal proteins, all proteins that play essential roles in

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

modern translation are products of long and complex
evolution of diverse protein domains. So here comes the
Catch-22: for all this protein evolution to occur, an accurate and efficient translation system was required. This
ancient translation system might not have been quite as
accurate and efficient as the modern version but it will be
a safe bet to infer that is must have been within an order
of magnitude from the modern one in terms of fidelity
and translation rates, to make protein evolution possible.
However, from all we know about the modern translation
system, this level of precision is unimaginable without a
complex, dedicated protein apparatus [31].
Thus, the translation system presents us with the DarwinEigen paradox as clearly as it gets: for a modern-type, efficient and accurate translation system to function, many
diverse proteins are needed, and for those proteins to
evolve, a translation system almost as good as the modern
one would be necessary. There is only one solution to this
paradox, and it lies in an, at least, partial refutation of the
first part of the above opposition: we are forced to conclude that a translation system comparable to the modern
one in terms of accuracy and speed functioned without
many proteins, possibly, without any proteins at all.
Hence the very existence of a complex, elaborate RNA
world (see the next section), in which a primitive version
of the Darwin-Eigen cycle was already operating, can be
conjectured from the comparative analysis of the translation system components (again, a different perspective on
this issue is given elsewhere[17]).
This is not all the comparative analysis can do: comparison of RNAs themselves also yields important information and startling puzzles. The conservation of the
structure, some sequence elements (e.g., the pseudouridine loop), and even modification sites of the tRNAs of all
specificities (and, needless to say, all species) leaves no
doubt that they all evolved from a single common ancestor [32-34]. Hence the second paradox of translation evolution ensuing from the comparison of modern sequences
and structures: if, at some point in evolution, there was a
single progenitor to tRNAs of all specificities, how could a
translation system function â and, if there was no translation system at that stage, what would be the driving force
of evolution of the amino-acid-specific tRNAs?
Ribozymes and the RNA World
The famous central dogma of molecular biology [16]
states that, in biological systems, information is transferred from DNA to protein through an RNA intermediate
(the possibility of reverse information flow from RNA to
DNA has been added after the discovery of reverse transcriptase):

DNAâRNAâprotein

Obviously, when considering the origin of first life forms,
one faces the proverbial chicken-and-egg problem: what
came first, DNA or protein, the gene or the product? In
that form, the problem might be outright unsolvable.
Indeed, there is a crucial feedback in this system: to replicate and transcribe DNA, functionally active proteins are
required, but production of these proteins requires accurate replication, transcription, and translation of nucleic
acids. If one sticks to the triad of the Central Dogma, it is
impossible to envisage what could serve as the starting
material for the Darwin-Eigen cycle. Even removing DNA
from the triad and postulating that the original genetic
material consisted of RNA, while an important idea (see
below), is not going to help much because the feedback
remains as crucial as it is elusive. In order for evolution
toward greater complexity to take off, the system needs to
somehow get started on the Darwin-Eigen cycle prior to
establishing this feedback.
The brilliantly ingenious and, perhaps, the only possible
solution has been independently proposed by Woese
[35], Crick [36], and Orgel [37] in 1967â68: neither the
chicken nor the egg but what is in the middle, that is, RNA
alone! The unique property of RNA that makes it a credible, indeed, apparently, the best candidate for the central
role in the primordial replicating system is its ability to
combine informational and catalytic functions. This
notion has been greatly boosted by the study of ribozymes
(RNA enzymes), which was pioneered by Cech and coworkers' discovery, in 1982, of the autocatalytic cleavage of
the Tetrahymena rRNA intron [38], and by the demonstration, in 1983, by Altman and coworkers, that RNAse P is
a ribozyme [39]. Since the time of these seminal discoveries, the study of ribozymes has evolved into a vast,
expanding research area (at the time of this writing, March
1, 2007, the keyword 'ribozyme' retrieves 4883 documents from the PubMed database; for recent reviews, see
[40-43]).
The discovery of ribozymes made the idea that the first
replicating systems consisted solely of RNA molecules,
which catalyzed their own replication, extremely attractive. In 1986, Gilbert coined the term "RNA world" to designate this hypothetical stage in life's evolution [44], and
the idea caught up big way, becoming the leading, in fact,
almost universally accepted hypothesis on the early stages
of life's evolution [45-48].
The popularity of the RNA World hypothesis has, in turn,
further stimulated ribozyme research, aimed, in large part,
at testing the feasibility of various RNA-based catalytic
activities, above all, perhaps, an RNA replicase. It is noteworthy that the main approach to developing ribozymes
with desired activities is in vitro selection that, at least conceptually, mimics the Darwinian evolution of ribozymes

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

thought to occur in the primeval RNA world [49,50].
Essentially, these directed selection experiments are
designed in such a fashion that, from a random population of RNA sequences, only those are amplified that catalyze the desired reaction. In such multiple-round
selection experiments, ribozymes have been evolved to
catalyze an extremely broad variety of reactions. Since
here we are concerned with the problem of the origin of
translation, Table 1 lists only those of the ribozyme-catalyzed reactions that appear to be specifically relevant to
this problem. Notably, all three elementary reactions
required for translation, namely: i) amino acid activation
through the formation of aminoacyl-AMP, ii) (t)RNA
aminoacylation, and iii) transpeptidation (the peptidyltransferase reaction), have been successfully modeled
with ribozymes (Table 1). It is particularly remarkable
that the key self-aminoacylation reaction has been
selected in vitro with considerable ease such that the best
of the resulting ribozymes catalyzed it with a rate and specificity greater than those of the respective aaRS [51].
Understandably, major effort has focused on the demonstration of nucleotide polymerization and, ultimately,
RNA replication catalyzed by ribozymes, the key processes
for the hypothetical, primordial RNA World. While these
reactions are not directly involved in translation, they are
highly relevant to the problem considered here inasmuch
as replication with a fidelity above the Eigen threshold is
a pre-requisite of biological evolution (see above). The
outcome of the experiments aimed at the creation of
ribozyme replicases so far has been somewhat mixed.
Ribozymes have been obtained capable of extending a
primer annealed to a template by 10â14 nucleotides; initially, the ribozymes with this activity could function only
by specific base-pairing to the template but, subsequently,
general ribozyme polymerases of this class have been
evolved through additional selection [52-56]. However,
these ribozyme polymerases are still a far cry from processive, sufficiently accurate (in terms of the Eigen threshold)
replicases, capable of catalyzing replication of exogenous
templates and themselves, that appear to be a conditio sine
qua non for the evolution of the hypothetical RNA World.
It is often noted that the RNA World is not just a concept
supported by the catalytic prowess of ribozymes: while
overshadowed by the multitude of proteins with catalytic
and structural functions, the RNA World still lurks within
modern life forms [57,58]. Reactions catalyzed by
ribozymes, while by far less numerous than those catalyzed by protein enzymes, are of crucial importance in
modern cells. The foremost case of a today's natural
ribozyme is the ribosome itself, where the crucial peptidyltransferase reaction is catalyzed by large-subunit rRNA
without direct participation of proteins [59-61]. In the
nearly ubiquitous tRNA-processing enzyme RNAse P, the

organelles, are ribozymes that catalyze their own excision
from RNA transcripts, often, facilitated by specific proteins, the maturases [64-69]. It is generally believed that
the myriads of eukaryotic spliceosomal introns, as well as
the snRNAs that comprise the active moieties of the
eukaryotic spliceosomes, have evolved from Group II
introns [68,69], leaving, perhaps, the most conspicuous
imprint of the RNA World on modern genomes [70]. Similarly, in the smallest known infectious agents, viroids and
virusoids, the ribozyme-catalyzed reactions are directly
involved in replication: although the polymerization of
nucleotides is catalyzed by a protein polymerase, processing of replication intermediates into genomic units
depends on a built-in ribozyme [71]. The existence and
importance of these (and, perhaps, other, still undiscovered) RNA-catalyzed reactions in modern cells imply a
major role of RNA catalysts in the early evolution of life
but in no way prove the reality of the primordial RNA
world as it is defined above â a large community of RNAs
possessing diverse catalytic activities and replicated by
ribozyme polymerases. Nevertheless, these features of
modern RNAs are fully compatible with such an evolutionary stage and greatly add to its plausibility. In particular, the fundamental fact that the peptidyltransferase
reaction in the ribosome is catalyzed by a ribozyme
strongly suggests that this was the functional mode of the
primordial translation system.

To recapitulate, three independent lines of evidence converge in support of a major role of RNA, and in particular,
RNA catalysis at the earliest stages of life's history, and are
compatible with the reality of a complex, ancient RNA
world that was first postulated by Woese, Crick, and Orgel
on purely logical grounds. First, comparative analysis of
the protein components of the translation machinery and
their homologs involved in other functions strongly suggests that extensive diversification of the protein world
took place at the time when the translation system was
comprised, primarily, of RNA. Second, several classes of
ribozymes operate within modern cells, and their properties are compatible with the notion that they are relicts of
the ancient RNA world. Third, while limited in scope and,
obviously, inferior in catalytic activity compared to protein enzymes [41], ribozymes have been shown or, more
to the point, evolved to catalyze a remarkable variety of
reactions including those that are central to the evolution
of translation (Table 1).
All these arguments in favor of the reality of the RNA
World notwithstanding, there are two major sources of
doubts. First, despite all invested effort, the in vitro
evolved ribozymes remain (relatively) poor catalysts; the
lack of efficient ribozyme polymerases seems particularly
troubling. Admittedly, it might be unrealistic to expect
that experiments on in vitro evolution of ribozymes could
easily mimic the actual complexity of the primordial RNA
world. Indeed, although these experiments harness the
power of selection, they are, obviously, performed on a
totally different time scale and conditions that cannot
possibly reproduce those of life's origin. The latter, of

course, are not known but it seems reasonable to surmise
that, if there was a complex RNA World at the brink of the
Translation Breakthrough, it was brought about by millions of years of evolution of ensembles of replicating
RNAs in a compartmentalized environment similar, at
least, in principle, to the networks of iron sulfide compartments existing at hydrothermal vents [72-74]. The environment of this type can be reproduced in the laboratory
but condensing eons of evolution into a manageable
timescale is a grand challenge. Interestingly, a recent simulation study indicates that, if there was some RNA synthesis in such compartments[75,76], the resulting
polyribonucleotides would accumulate to very high concentrations, an observation that increases the plausibility
of this model. Of course, this scenario remains a model;
other forms of compartmentalization are conceivable.
A recent study of Szathmary and coworkers puts some
important numbers on the complexity that, potentially,
might be attainable in the RNA World and the replication
fidelity required to reach this level of complexity [77]. An
estimate based on the functional tolerance of well-characterized ribozymes to mutations suggests that, at a fidelity
of 10-3 errors per nucleotide per replicase cycle, an RNA
"organism" with ~100 "genes" the size of a tRNA (~80
nucleotides) would be sustainable. This level of fidelity
would require only an order of magnitude improvement
over the most accurate ribozyme polymerases obtained by
in vitro selection [52,78]. Conceivably, this is, roughly, the
intrinsic complexity limit on ensembles of co-evolving
"selfish cooperators" that might have been the "organisms" of the RNA world [74]. As aptly commented by
Poole, "Getting from an RNA world to modern cells just
got a little easier" [79]. Of course, "a little" is a crucial
qualification here as all this evidence falls far short from
proving the reality of a fully fledged RNA world; nevertheless, in the rest of this article, we proceed with the RNA
world as a premise.
Even under the best case scenario, the RNA world does not
appear to have potential to evolve beyond very simple
"organisms". To attain greater complexity, invention of
translation and the Protein Breakthrough were required.
However, the selective forces underlying the emergence of
the translation system in the RNA World remain obscure,
and tracing the path to translation is extremely hard. This
lack of clarity with regard to the continuity of evolution
from the RNA World to an RNA-protein world can be construed as a second major objection against the RNA World
as a crucial stage of life's evolution, an objection, perhaps,
even more prohibitive than the first one, dealing with the
imperfection of ribozymes. A radical alternative, "no RNA
World" hypothesis, is considered elsewhere [17]. In the
rest of this article, we discuss possible ways to derive the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

translation from the RNA World through a path of evolution adhering to the Continuity Principle.
The nature and origins of the genetic code: a
stereochemical correspondence between amino acids and
codons or anticodons, a frozen accident, selection, or all of
the above?
To understand how translation might have emerged, the
nature and origin of the codon assignments in the universal genetic code are crucial. The problem of code evolution fascinated researchers even before the code was fully
deciphered, and the earliest treatises on the subject
already clearly recognized three, not necessarily mutually
exclusive models: i) steric complementarity resulting in
specific interactions between amino acids and the cognate
codon (codon recognition model, or CRM) or anticodon
triplets (anticodon recognition model, or ARM), ii) "frozen accident" â fixation of a random code that would have
been virtually impossible to significantly change afterwards (frozen accident model, or FAM), and iii) adaptive
evolution of the code starting from an initially random
codon assignment [35,36,80-86]. The internal structure of
the code is such that codons for related amino acids are
adjacent in the code table resulting in a high (although
not maximum) robustness of the code to mutations and
translation errors as first noticed by Woese at a qualitative
level [35,82] and subsequently demonstrated quantitatively [87-93]. The robustness of the code seems to falsify
the frozen-accident scenario in its pure form; however, the
stereochemical model, the selection model, a combination thereof, or frozen accident followed by adaptation all
could explain the observed properties of the code.

The principal dilemma is whether or not a stereochemical
correspondence between amino acids and cognate triplets
(in the form of either CRM or ARM) exists or not. The
answer to this straightforward question proved to be surprisingly elusive. The early attempts to establish specificity
in interactions of (poly)amino acids and polynucleotides
have been inconclusive, indicating that, if a correspondence exists, it must be much less than precise, and the
interactions involved would be weak and dependent on
extraneous factors [94-96]. Although some tantalizing
cases of non-randomness in amino-acid-nucleotide interactions have been claimed (e.g., [97-102]), one is forced
to conclude that, in general, the attempts to demonstrate
such interactions directly have failed.
A recent resurgence of the stereochemical hypothesis was
brought about by the application of the selection amplification (SELEX) methodology for isolation of oligonucleotides (aptamers) that specifically bind amino acids
[103,104]. The latest survey by Yarus and coworkers
reports detailed aptamer data for 8 amino acids: phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, histidine, glutamine, arginine,

Page 8 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:14

tyrosine, and tryptophan [104]. With the sole exception of
glutamine, the aptamers for each amino acids were
enriched for codon and/or anticodon triplets at a statistically highly significant level [104-106]. On the whole,
associations with anticodons were more pronounced than
those with codons. However, the results are complementary in that arginine (the amino acid characterized in
greatest detail in aptamer experiments) showed a significant enrichment only for codons in binding sites, whereas
for phenylalanine, leucine, and tryptophan, the binding
sites were significantly enriched for anticodons; rather surprisingly, isoleucine and tyrosine were associated with
both types of cognate triplets [104]. Taken together, the
experimental results on aptamer binding that, in the case
of arginine, have been analyzed in great detail for possible
effects of statistical and chemical artifacts [107] are construed as a strong argument for the stereochemical
hypothesis of code origin [104]. Moreover, for histidine,
isoleucine, and tryptophan, it has been shown directly
that the simplest binding aptamers contained the cognate
codon or anticodon [108-112], lending credence to the
idea that similar molecules might be relevant for modeling evolution in the RNA world [104].
Nevertheless, serious questions remain as to the ultimate
validity and relevance of these results. The presence of
both codons and antidocons in aptamers binding several
amino acids is hard to interpret in terms of stereochemical
complementarity. Furthermore, the amino acids for
which detailed aptamer data is available are those that
have complex side chains (which, presumably, mediate
interactions with the aptamers) and are thought to be late
recruitments to the genetic code [113]. At least, until similar results are obtained for simpler, supposedly, ancient
amino acids, it is hard to view the aptamer selection
results as a definitive case for the stereochemical hypothesis of code origin.
A different, and elegant version of the stereochemical correspondence hypothesis has been proposed by Copley
and coworkers[114]. This scenario links the origin of the
code to the synthesis of amino acids by postulating that,
under prebiotic conditions, dinucleotides covalently
bound Î±-keto acids and specifically enhanced amino acid
synthesis from these precursors. Unfortunately, there is no
empirical evidence in support of this interesting model.
Thus, the jury is still out with regard to any role direct
interactions between amino acids and cognate triplets
might have played in the origin of the code. Accordingly,
in what follows, we strive to be objective and consider the
origin of the code in three distinct contexts: i) specific
interaction between amino acids and the cognate codons
(CRM), ii) specific interactions between amino acids and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

the cognate anticodons (ARM), and iii) frozen accident
(FAM) as the starting point for the evolution of the code.
Previous hypotheses on the origin of translation
During the 40 years since the discovery of the translation
mechanism and deciphering of the genetic code, numerous theoretical (inevitably, speculative, sometimes, far
fetched, often, extremely ingenious) models of the origin
and evolution of various components of the translation
apparatus and aspects of the process itself have been proposed. A comprehensive, critical review of this literature
would be a truly daunting task and will not be attempted
here. We outline only a few of the more straightforward
and, in our opinion, more plausible, evolutionary
schemes and then discuss in somewhat greater detail the
only published coherent scenario for the evolution of the
translation system we are aware of.

One popular and potentially important idea on the origin
of the genetic code is the hypothesis of Szathmary on the
role of so-called coding coenzyme handles (CCH), i.e.,
oligonucleotides with various ribozyme activities using
amino acids as cofactors, as evolutionary progenitors of
tRNAs [115-117]. This hypothesis ties in with the idea
that tRNAs evolved by two successive duplications of
amino-acid-binding hairpins [118]. The CCH are thought
to have assembled via their proto-anticodons on emerging mRNAs. A modification of the CCH hypothesis proposed by Knight and Landweber involves evolution of
aminoacylating ribozymes (which is compatible with the
available experimental data â see Table 1) and emergence
of non-templated, ribozyme-mediate peptide synthesis as
an intermediate stage in the evolution of translation
[107]. An alternative to the CCH scheme is the directRNA-templating (DRT) hypothesis of translation origin
proposed by Yarus [119]. Under the DRT model, the original form of amino-acid-proto-tRNA interaction was
direct binding, presumably, via anticodon triplets; subsequently, direct binding has been supplanted by the adaptor mechanism, probably, with the participation of
aminoacylating ribozymes, as under the modified CCH
hypothesis.
These and other hypotheses tackle important aspects of
the origin and evolution of the translation system. However, they all stop short of proposing a complete, coherent
scenario for the transition from the RNA world to the
modern mode of translation. We believe that the reason
for the near lack of such scenarios in the current literature
is the formidable difficulty of breaking this transition into
incremental steps associated with a biologically plausible
selective advantage, thus making the entire transition
compatible with the Continuity Principle.

We are aware of two proposals that come closest to such a
complete scenario, and it seems to be more than a remarkable coincidence that the two present essentially the same
model, differences in detail notwithstanding. The essence
of this model, originally sketched by Altstein [120-122],
and later, independently and more completely developed
by Poole, Jeffares, and Penny [8,123], is that the ribosome
and the translation mechanism are derived from an
ancient ribozyme replicase.
Let us examine in some detail the model of Poole and
coworkers, which is better reconciled with various facets
of the RNA World than the original proposal of Altstein
(not surprisingly, given that the first version of Altstein's
hypothesis [120] has been proposed prior to the discovery
of ribozymes). Crucially, in this model, the protoribosome is postulated to have functioned as a "triplicase", i.e.,
a complex ribozyme combining the activities of a RNA
polymerase and a RNA ligase by building a nascent RNA
molecule complementary to the template in three-nucleotide steps. The "triplicase"-protoribosome would facilitate the assembly of tRNA-like molecules (perhaps,
analogous to the CCH) on the template RNA through
base-pairing of (proto)anticodons with complementary
triplets (codons) on the template, cleaving off the rest of
the pre-tRNA, and joining (ligating) adjacent triplets (Fig.
2 in [8,123]). A RNA-based replication mechanism
involving complementary interaction of trinucleotides
with the template, as opposed to mononucleotides, was
deemed plausible by Poole et al., given the low efficiency
(long characteristic turnover times) of ribozymes. A complex of template RNA with a complementary trinucleotide
would persist orders of magnitude longer than a complex
with a mononucleotide, giving the triplicase a chance to
ligate the adjacent triplets. The hypothetical triplicase
mechanism was considered particularly plausible [8] in
view of the demonstration, by Fredrick and Noller, that
the ribosome, without the involvement of translation factors, threads mRNA through the ribosome in three-nucleotides steps, with concordant movements of tRNAs [124].
Thus, the modern ribosome, of which the primary functional part is rRNA, is a versatile machine that catalyzes
the stepwise joining of amino acids to form polypeptide
chains and also mediates the associated movements of
RNA molecules. It seems tempting to view this mechanism, which is crucial for modern translation, as a relic of
the primordial "triplicase" system of RNA replication [8].
Of course, the transition from a triplicase to a moderntype translation-replication system requires the emergence of the genetic code, in this case, at the level of amino
acid recognition by the proto-tRNAs, and the feedback
between translation and RNA replication. Furthermore, a
subfunctionalization stage would be required where the
triplicase would give rise to separate proto-ribosome and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

replicase, the latter having to switch from triplet joining to
the conventional, one nucleotide at a time, replication
mechanism. Perhaps, most damningly, the triplicase/protoribosome would have to be a tremendously advanced,
complex RNA machine. Poole et al. [123] are not particularly specific about the organization of this machine and
the likely mechanisms of and selective forces behind each
of the necessary evolutionary steps, which renders the
triplicase model incomplete and leaves one with the suspicion that, all its attraction notwithstanding, the triplicase might not be the most likely solution to the origin of
translation problem. Nevertheless, regardless of the validity of its details, the triplicase model drives home a crucial
point: evolution having no foresight, protein synthesis
could not be the selective advantage that fuelled the initial
evolution of the translation system; inevitably, it must
have evolved via the exaptation route.
An overview of the existing models for the origins of translation and coding shows that none of them, not even the
attractive triplicase model, offer a complete, compatible
with the Continuity Principle outline of the path to the
Protein Breakthrough. In the rest of this article, we explore
three versions of such scenarios, two building upon specific interactions between amino acids and codons or anticodons, respectively, and the third one centered around
frozen accident. We draw on aspects of the previously
published models, in particular, the DRT, CCH, and triplicase hypotheses, and the experimental data on
ribozymes, and also propose several original steps.

A conceptual scenario for the origin of
translation and the genetic code
The assumptions, premises, and settings
1. The Continuity Principle remains the central principle of
evolution despite the demonstration of the importance of
fixation of neutral or slightly deleterious changes due to
drift, and the possibility of substantial single-step innovations brought about by HGT, recombination, duplication,
and other processes. All these important phenomena are
but additions that only emphasize the basic validity of the
Continuity Principle: evolution has no foresight and does
not perform miracles. It proceeds step-by-step, and each
step is, generally, associated with a selective advantage for
the bearers of the respective innovation, even as some of
these steps might not be infinitesimal as Darwin thought
they had to be.

2. A diverse RNA world antedating translation. As discussed above, the latest results on the catalytic activities of
ribozymes suggest the possibility of a versatile RNA world
that already harbored a considerable diversity of catalytic
activities, including, among others, RNA polymerases
(replicases). Comparative analysis of translation system
components points in the same direction, i.e., indicates

Page 10 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:14

that the primordial translation system consisted (predominantly) of RNA. The RNA World is a conjecture not a
proven fact but, for the purpose of this paper, we assume
that it existed.
3. Evolution has no foresight â thus, before there were
functional proteins facilitating replication, production of
proteins could not be the driving force behind the evolution of the translation system. Translation must have
evolved as a by-product of selection for some other function, i.e., via the exaptation route.
4. Fidelity of translation in the late RNA world was comparable to that of the modern translation. Counter-intuitively
but undeniably, the fidelity of the primitive translation
system that evolved within the ancient RNA world could
not have been dramatically lower than that of the modern
translation system, with all its numerous, essential proteins. This is the logical conclusion from the results of protein sequence and structure comparisons which reveal
extensive diversification of at least several protein folds
antedating the emergence of the protein components of
the modern translation system (in principle, it is possible
to imagine that the primordial translation system
included a complement of proteins distinct from the
modern one; however, this hypothesis not only has no
empirical support but also leads to infinite regression). A
corollary is that, already within the confines of the RNA
world, the translation machinery, in its principal features,
resembled the modern one. In particular, it is impossible
to imagine a high-fidelity translation system functioning
without a set of tRNAs for many, probably, most of the 20
amino acids found in modern proteins.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

recognition of amino acids by cognate triplets or other
sites must have occurred at the level of the adaptors from
the earliest stages of the evolution of the translation system. In that regard, it is highly encouraging that highly
efficient self-aminoacylating ribozymes are among thos
that are most easily selected in vitro [51].
7. Ensembles of selfish cooperators â genetic elements coexisting in a compartmentalized habitat. The models
detailed in the next section depend on the existence of a
certain level of complexity in the RNA world â manifested
not only in the diversity of catalytic activities but also in
the existence of co-selected ensembles of replicating RNA
molecules, the "selfish cooperators" [74]. The notion of
selfish cooperators, related to the previously developed
stochastic corrector model [125,126], entails co-existing,
functionally coupled molecules (e.g., replicases and
ribozymes that catalyze the synthesis of RNA precursors)
that are physically confined (compartmentalized) and
selected as a group. We are considering selfish cooperators
within the framework of a particular scenario of the early
evolution of life that implicates networks of inorganic
compartments, existing at hydrothermal vents on the
ocean floor and consisting, primarily, of iron sulfide, as
the hatcheries of pre-cellular life [73,74]. The models
developed here are not, actually, linked to this particular
scenario, which we adapt for the sake of concreteness;
however, co-selected ensembles of RNA molecules and
some form of compartmentalization are salient conditions.
8. Extensive formation of non-templated peptides in
ribozyme-catalyzed reactions occurring within the compartments and stimulation of various ribozymes by peptides-

5. Specific interactions (or lack thereof) between amino
acids and codons or anticodons. We believe that the jury is
still out on the reality and relevance of putative specific
interactions between amino acids and cognate triplets â
either codons or anticodons. Accordingly, we formulate
and explore three alternative models for translation origin
depending on whether or not amino acids specifically recognize cognate triplets: i) interaction of amino acids with
codons (CRM), ii) interaction of amino acids with anticodons (ARM), and iii) no specific interactions between
amino acids and any of the cognate triplets â the frozenaccident model (FAM).
6. Adaptors must have been part of the emerging translation
system from the start because peptide formation via direct
binding of amino acids to a RNA template is stereochemically implausible. Indeed, a simple 3D model shows that,
even if there was a specific affinity between amino acids
and cognate codons, the distances between amino acid
assembled on an RNA template would be far too long for
the formation of peptide bonds (Fig. 3). Thus, any direct

an optional but plausible condition that would boost the
model developed here. Abiogenic synthesis of at least several amino acids occurs readily in numerous variations of
the classical Miller experiment and, more notably,
ribozymes have been selected that efficiently catalyze
non-templated synthesis of diverse peptides [127-129].

The model: emergence of the translation system in the
RNA world
Despite substantial differences caused by the nature of
amino-acid-triplet interactions incorporated into the
model (or no interactions at all), the three models â CRM,
ARM, and FAM â have many features and steps in common. As we will point out, it seems that these steps are, in
effect, logically inevitable in any model of the evolutionary origin of translation. Therefore, in the presentation of
these models that follows, the common steps are outlined
just once, and forking paths are taken consecutively as
they emerge (the designations of the model-specific steps
have suffixes CRM, ARM, and FAM).

As outlined above, the starting point of all scenarios for
the origin of translation is a replicating ensemble of selfish cooperators consisting of RNA molecules with various
ribozyme activities and existing within a network of inorganic compartments [73,74]. One of the functions performed by these ribozymes is that of a replicase; other
activities, such as RNA precursor synthesis, are likely to be
present as well (Fig. 4). The scenarios include the following steps.
0. Ribozyme R (Fig. 4) is a part of an ensemble of selfish
cooperators within a compartment. This ribozyme should
possess sufficient complexity to catalyze the reaction
(XâY) affecting the fitness of the ensemble and to include
a certain number of evolvable positions allowing, in principle, the emergence of new activities.
1. Two or more abiogenic amino acids present in the compartment bind to R. Specific binding of the amino acids is
mediated by an ad hoc binding site present in R. Involvement of a stereochemical proto-code (in the form of either
ARM or CRM) at this stage is possible but would not substantially affect the proposed scenario. It is postulated that
the bound amino acids enhance the XâY reaction catalyzed by R (Fig. 5). As indicated above, ribozymes strongly
stimulated by peptides have been produced by in vitro
selection [130]. Conceivably, stimulation of R by amino
acids would be picked up by natural selection, in the context of the selfish cooperative evolution, leading to gradual perfection of the spatial alignment of amino acids on
R and selection of the optimal sequence and structure for
amino-acid-binding.

Origin of the translation system and the genetic code in the
RNA World. Step 0 (the pre-requisite): a ribozyme R catalyzes an arbitrary reaction beneficial for an ensemble of selfish cooperators.

2. R evolves an additional peptide ligase activity, yielding
oligopeptide P from adjacent amino acids bound to R
(Fig. 6). Highly active ribozymes with peptide ligase activity, albeit with low specificity, have been obtained by in
vitro selection [127,131]. It is most likely, however, that
only short peptides consisting of, at best, four-five amino
acids, could be synthesized by this class of ribozymes. The
selective advantage of this innovation would be the
increased stability of the reactive complex resulting in a
further boost to the XâY reaction.
An inevitable question with regard to this step is where
does the energy required for the peptide bond formation
come from. In the case of experimentally characterized
ribozyme peptide ligases, one of the substrates is an aminoacyl adenylate, so the energy of the ester bond is utilized [127,131]. This mimics the situation in translation
where the aminoacyl adenylate is used by the aaRS to
charge the cognate tRNAs, and the high-energy ester bond

of the latter is utilized for transpeptidation. It is not inconceivable that the primordial peptide ligase functioned in
the same mode using aminoacyl adenylates or other activated derivatives of amino acids produced by other
ribozymes; indeed, ribozymes that catalyze this reaction
have been reported [132].
3. Spontaneous disassembly or decay of R would release
the peptide P into the compartment (Fig. 7). If P has a
generic ribozyme-stimulating and/or ribozyme-stabilizing capacity, it might be captured by another ribozyme E,
which catalyzes a different reaction (UâV). An interesting
example could be a peptide containing a pair of acidic
amino acids and coordinating a magnesium ion as seen in
a great variety of unrelated modern nucleic acid metabolism enzymes (polymerases, nucleases, ligases, topoisomerases, and more) [133-135]. If P boosts the catalytic
activity of E, it again increases the fitness of the entire
ensemble. Consequently, selection will favor appropriate

adjustments to E, strengthening its association with P, and
further increase of the selective pressure on R to keep producing P.
4. With the activity of E relying on the presence of P, a
copy of R (RL) might lose the original XâY activity, with
a concomitant enhancement of the amino acid ligase
activity, whereas other copies (R0) would retain the original activity, still enhanced by the peptide P (Fig. 8). This
would be a typical case of subfunctionalization that is
thought to be the preferred route of evolution of genes
after duplication in modern genomes [136,137]. Subfunctionalization might have been important already in the
RNA world, with the benefit of improved catalysis by R0
and E outweighing the increased replication cost (the
necessity to maintain both RL and R0).

useful commodity for the evolving selfish cooperatives.
Amino acids are small polar molecules that easily diffuse,
especially, through the Fe-S gel, the principal constituent
of the hydrothermal compartments [72,73]. Accumulation of amino acids (along with other important molecules) within a compartment, obviously, would be
beneficial. Small, amino-acid-binding RNAs (T) evolve
under the pressure of selection for amion acid accumulation ; these molecules would be analogous to amino-acidbinding aptamers that have been studied in a variety of
experiments [103,104,110]. Originally, the T RNAs bind
amino acids non-specifically. Autocatalytic aminoacylation of the 3' end of RNA T evolves, resulting in an
increase in affinity and specificity of amino acid binding
(Fig. 9). As with the peptide ligase in step 2, there should
be a source of energy for this reaction; activated amino
acid derivatives, such as aminoacyl adenylates would
serve in this capacity. Since the aminoacyl-RNA bond is a
high-energy one, the association between RNA T and the
amino acid remains labile like in modern aminoacyltRNAs (e.g., Ref. [138], p. 57).
6. Different species of T RNAs specifically binding different amino acids evolve by duplication and diversification,
with the retention of variants driven by selection for efficient accumulation of a broad repertoire of amino acids.
The specific details of the binding mechanism would differ under the different modes of the amino acid-RNA recognition. Under the ARM, binding of the amino acid by
the cognate RNA T would be mediated, in a concerted
fashion, by two distinct moieties, the amino-acid-specific
anticodon loop and the stem region with a non-specific

affinity to the amino acid backbone (NH3-CÎ±-COOH)
(Fig. 10). The sterical problem of binding a small amino
acid molecule by two separate regions of RNA T could be
solved either by tight folding of the RNA chain or by the
formation of dimers where a pair of RNA T molecules
binds two amino acids (Fig. 10).
The CRM would require a similar but more complicated
binding mechanism. Since, ultimately, the anticodon
must be left exposed in a mature RNA T, one can envisage
a folding flip between two conformations (one of them
involving a complementary pairing of codon and anticodon), induced by the interaction with the cognate amino
acid (Fig. 9).
Finally, FAM would require a different mode of amino
acid recognition by RNA T whereby the recognition site is
unrelated to either the codon or the anticodon, whereas
the sequence of the exposed loop (the ancestor of the anticodon loop) in RNA T is chosen by chance (Fig. 10).
Regardless of the specific model (even under FAM), this is
the critical step where the correspondence between amino
acids and cognate triplets is established, directly or indirectly, creating the basis of the genetic code.

RNA complexes instead of individual amino acids (Fig.

to transpeptidation, which would result in an increased
yield of peptides thanks to the high energy of the aminoacyl-RNA bond. Notably, it has been shown that the 50 S
subunit of bacterial ribosomes, of which the ribozyme RL
is deemed the progenitor, is capable of catalyzing the
transpeptidation reaction at a rate comparable to that displayed by the complete ribosome [139]. These findings
seem to support the plausibility of this step of the model.
8. An accessory RNA subunit RS evolves, driven by selection for increasingly efficient binding and positioning of
aminoacyl-T complex on RL (Fig. 12). The burden of specific recognition shifts from an ad hoc (Van der Vaals and
hydrogen-bonds) interaction between RNA T and RL to
the specific base-pairing between the exposed (now anticodon) loop of T and an extended RNA strand of RS. The
transpeptidation activity remains the function of RL. This
is the crucial step of the emergence of bona fide translation,
a mechanism based on the adaptors (proto-tRNAs, the T
RNAs in this model) combining amino acids with the cognate codons [15].
The evolutionary path from the set of primitive T RNAs
(Fig. 10) to the modern tRNAs seems mysterious given the
indisputable common ancestry of tRNAs of all specificities
(see above). Conceivably, at the early stages of the

transalation system evolution outlined in steps 1â8, different species of T RNAs evolved along, roughly, parallel
(convergent) paths. However, the common origin of
tRNAs implies a subsequent bottleneck through which
only a single winner has passed, an L-shaped molecule
with the acceptor CCA 3'-end. Selection for spatial complemtarity and efficient interaction between the aminoacylated T RNAs and the peptidyl-transferase RL could be
the driving force behind the selection for this structure.
This selection originally would affect only one T RNA, perhaps, the one chargeable with the most abundant primordial amino acid. Since a relatively minor modification (a
concerted change in the amino-acid-binding site and the
anticodon loop) would switch the specificity of the prototRNA, a sweep by a single proto-tRNA species, taking over
the function of other, unrelated and unevolved, T RNAs
one by one, seems to be plausible. We tentatively place
this sweep in an early stage in the evolution of the translation system; however, an alternative possibility is that it
took place at a later stage, concomitantly with the evolution of aaRS and their takeover of the key role in the pairing of amino acids with the cognate anticodons.

plex (Fig. 13). At this and the next step, selection for the
most beneficial peptides would "freeze" the correspondence between the anticodon of the RNA T and the identity
of the associated amino acid under FAM.

subfunctionalization). In particular, new forms of RS

base triplets.

10. As the next step, we envision the physical separation
of the template strand M from RS, resulting in further disentanglement of coding and catalysis (Fig. 14). At this
point, the strand M is practically free from evolutionary
constraints associated with the binding and catalytic activities involved in the primitive translation because all of
these functions are provided by physically distinct RNA
molecules, RL, RS, and the proto-tRNAs. The only requirement for M is to adopt a semi-extended conformation to
accommodate the codon-anticodon base-pairing that is
required for the binding of an aminoacyl-T RNA. The
selective benefits of such separation are obvious: transient
association of RSRL (which, at this point, we will call the
proto-ribosome for the first time) with different oligo/
polynucleotides present in the compartment would lead
to the production of an increasing variety of peptides, thus
enhancing the catalytic potential of the ensemble. Furthermore, this step would enable the selection for
improved replication potential (e.g., high-affinity replicase recognition sites) of those species of M that encode
useful peptides, leading to enrichment of these RNA species in the compartment. Thus, an RNA-peptide EigenSchuster hypercycle [6], a distinct version of the DarwinEigen cycle, would be effectively established within the
selfish cooperative.

longer peptides, i.e., the first proteins (Fig. 15). This is
when the Protein Breakthrough takes place.
The evolutionary path from the breakthrough stage outlined above to the modern-type translation system was,
largely, a story of takeover of the primordial ribozyme
functions by evolving proteins. Proteins have an incomparably greater potential for evolution of diverse binding
and catalytic capacities than peptides or RNA and, accordingly, they soon began to gradually supplant the
ribozymes. Given the greater chemical versatility and efficiency of proteins as catalysts, each such displacement is
irreversible, as insightfully stressed by Penny [8].
The rest, as they say, is history.

system. And the origin of the translation system is far from
being a trivial matter. The main difficulty is not even its
complexity per se but the necessity to invent a new principle, that of the genetic code, the correspondence between
the a priori unconnected sequences of nucleotides and
amino acids. It might not be much of an exaggeration to
note that, at least, at first glance, the origin of the translation system evokes the scary specter of irreducible complexity.
Thus, our main incentive with the present analysis was to
deconstruct the formidable problem of the emergence of
translation into a series of plausible and manageable
steps, in accordance with the Continuity Principle. We
believe that, in doing so, we achieved a somewhat greater
level of detail and coherence than any of the previous
models we are aware of. Importantly, in constructing this
model, we were both constrained and driven by: i) comparative-genomic data, ii) experimental data on aminoacid-codon recognition, iii) experimental data on the
diverse catalytic activities of ribozymes.

Discussion and conclusion
The status of the model: incentives and constraints
The scenarios for the origin of the translation system and
the genetic code outlined here are both sketchy and highly
speculative. Why, then, bother building such conceptual,
qualitative models at all? The justification for this kind of
theorizing can be succinctly put in the short phrase: we
have to get from there to here. There being the early, cooling earth with no complex organic molecules, and here
being a minimally complex genetic system with moderntype translation, transcription, and replication machineries, a system that would be subject to biological evolution
much like modern organisms. The replication and transcription problems are, at least, logically relatively
straightforward, even if hard from the chemical point of
view, inasmuch as no new principles, beyond base complementarity, and enzymatic catalysis need to be
invented. Thus, plausible, even if conflicting, accounts of
the emergence of these systems have been derived from
comparative-genomic data and evolutionary reasoning
[70,140-144]. There is, however, a crucial snag about
these models: they all rely on a pre-existing translation

Comparative-genomic analysis indicates that an elaborate
translation system, comparable to the modern one in
terms of fidelity and efficiency, has evolved within the
RNA world. Indeed, extensive diversification of many protein folds occurred before the advent of some of the essential components of the modern translation system, such
as aaRS and translation factors. Before the emergence of
these dedicated proteins, the translation system must have
been a machine comprised primarily, if not exclusively, of
RNA. The only conceivable alternative, that the primordial translation system employed a different, currently,
extinct complement of essential protein factors, inevitably
leads to infinite regression. Thus, it seems to be a virtually
inevitable conclusion that the ancient, RNA-only translation system was comparable in efficiency to the modern
one. This might seem paradoxical and even not credible at
a superficial glance. However, a quick reflection suggests
that: i) the skeleton of the modern translation system
actually consists of RNA, with the proteins being elaborations, however numerous and important, and ii) logically,
it hardly could have been otherwise: indeed, in order to
Page 17 of 25

Biology Direct 2007, 2:14

switch to a new type of constituents (proteins), biological
systems needed the means to produce them accurately. It
is conceivable and, indeed, likely that peptides produced
by the first, RNA-based proto-translation systems provided positive feedback leading to hypercycle formation
(Figs. 4, 6). However, this primitive version of translation
must have been quite sloppy and hardly could master production of anything beyond relatively short peptides. Evolution of the (nearly) complete set of tRNAs was a prerequisite for achieving the fidelity required to kick off protein evolution in earnest.
In our description of the model, the alternative scenarios
based on CRM, ARM, and FAM are considered on equal
footing. As discussed above, the currently available data
are too ambiguous to conclude which of these models for
the origin of coding is most likely. However, it should be
noted that, important as they are in terms of the actual
physico-chemical underpinning of the code, the differences between CRM, ARM, and FAM do not translate into
major modifications of the evolutionary scenario. Indeed,
the central principles remains the same, i.e., specific recognition of amino acids by proto-tRNAs such that an
amino acid is paired with the cognate anticodon with sufficient reliability.
Lasting principles and ephemeral details
The models presented here were deliberately constructed
at the level of considerable detail -at the risk of getting
many, perhaps, most aspects wrong â in order to provide
a proof of principle, i.e., to illustrate a plausible sequence
of selectively advantageous steps along the path from the
RNA world to the modern-type translation system. This
being said, there seem to be several underlying principles
that are likely to stand regardless of further developments.
We briefly recapitulate these:

1. Evolution having no foresight, selection for translation
per se is not feasible.
Translation must have evolved as a by-product of selection for some other function, i.e., via the exaptation route.
2. Given that the essence of translation is the intimate link
between RNA and proteins, it seems most likely that, in
some form, this connection existed from the very beginning of the evolutionary path from the RNA World to
translation. Thus, the proposed starting point, i.e., stimulation of ribozymes by amino acids and peptides seems to
be a strong, almost, logically required, candidate for this
role (see also [145]).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

adaptors have been key to the establishment of the genetic
code. These ancestral adaptors, although, in all likelihood, smaller and simpler than modern tRNAs, must
have been endowed with catalytic capacities lacking in the
latter, i.e., they would have to catalyze specific self-aminoacylation with the cognate amino acids.
4. The primordial translation system was dominated by
RNA although peptides might facilitate its functioning.
However, the fidelity of this primordial, (nearly) RNAonly translation system must have been comparable to
that of modern translation systems, considering that
extensive protein evolution took place prior to the diversification of the proteins that are essential for the modern
translation.
Problems and testability
The current scenario for the evolution of translation in the
RNA World faces formidable difficulties because,
although the ribozyme catalysis of the elementary reactions required for translation has been demonstrated
experimentally (Table 1), the required complex RNAmediated functions have not. The crux of the problem
seems to lie in the postulated catalytic adaptors that
would have to possess a notable spectrum of capabilities
including, in addition to the apparently feasible specific
recognition of amino acids and self-aminoacylation, the
ordered binding to the progenitor of the large subunit
(RL), and at a subsequent stage, recognition of a specific
region in the progenitor of the small subunit (RS). With
regard to RL and RS themselves, ribozyme stimulation by
amino acids and peptides has been demonstrated but,
beyond that, the postulated properties of these molecules
remain hypothetical. It seems that a focused experimental
effort aimed at the construction/selection of ribozymes
with the properties of the postulated T RNAs, in particular, their postulated interaction with other, more complex
ribozymes, could provide crucial evidence in support of
this or a similar scenario for the evolution of translation.

Although the individual ribozyme-catalyzed reactions
involved in the postulated scheme are feasible, the succession of multiple evolutionary steps that appear to be
required for the emergence of translation might be legitimately viewed as far fetched, particularly, considering the
inevitably inefficient ribozyme-mediated replication that
must have been prevalent in the RNA World. Be as it may,
this is, at present, our best effort to develop a conceptual
model for the origin of translation. Elsewhere, one of us
(EVK) examines a radical alternative [17].

Reviewers' comments
3. Synthesis of peptides directly on an RNA template is
stereochemically unfeasible. Hence adaptors must have
been part of the primordial translation system from the
start. Accordingly, from the very onset of translation,

error threshold to provide a new, comprehensive model
for the origins of translation. Specifically, they build on
Szathmary's (1993) model of amino acids as coenzymes
in an RNA metabolism as a starting point for the genetic
code. As pointed out by Knight & Landweber (2000),
there are three pathways to a protein-based genetic code
from the RNA world that preserves continuity of features
of the genetic code: the RNAs that bind directly could have
played the roles of tRNAs, mRNAs, or aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases. Wolf & Koonin favor a model along the lines
of the latter role, suggesting that cofactor-enhanced catalysis, and then nonribosomal synthesis of short peptides,
were the original driving force for RNA-catalyzed translation. They present an intriguing new overall model of the
evolution of the translation system, and highlight aspects
of this model that could be tested in the laboratory. The
main weakness of the manuscript in its current form is its
endorsement of the frozen accident model (FAM) of the
genetic code's evolution without the presentation of alternative explanations of the evidence in favor of the optimality of the genetic code relative to random codes, and
the coding triplet/binding site associations that have been
observed through SELEX and in the Group I intron. However, as the authors themselves point out, the resurrection
of the frozen accident model is not an important feature
of their overall model for the emergence of translation,
and this discussion could be omitted without diminishing
the manuscript's contribution.
The manuscript presents some interesting ideas that I have
not seen elsewhere and that appear to shed substantial
new light on the difficult problem of the origin of translation.
For example, the discussion on p. 13 that shows that the
domains in the aaRS are highly derived relative to
domains in other proteins is extremely interesting,
because we might have expected the aaRS to be among the
earliest proteins. If they are not, the likelihood that they
displaced some other system for coded translation
increases dramatically (Theobald & Wuttke's 2005 study
of OB-fold superfamily relationships also supports this
idea). One point that should be specifically noted in this
context is that not only do these relationships imply that
the aaRS are relatively late arrivals, but also that coded
translation must have predated the aaRS so that the
sequence information that allows us to determine the
phylogenetic relationships among these folds could be
transmitted to the present. In other words, if comparable
folds were once produced by a different synthesis mechanism, either we would need either a system of reverse
translation to copy the sequence information into nucleic
acids, or all of the proteins produced by that mechanism
would have been lost when coded translation took over.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

Similarly, the discussion on pp. 33â39 of a plausible scenario for the evolution of the modern translation system
seems plausible and is more detailed than most such scenarios to be found in the literature.
A couple of areas of the manuscript could potentially be
supported by drawing on additional literature. For example, on p. 8, Dennett has an excellent discussion in "Darwin's Dangerous Idea" (Simon & Schuster, 1995) of the
production of apparently irreducibly complex phenomena through simplification of an even more complex system, e.g. building an arch by taking away stones from a
pile of rubble. The complexity of the system of peptidespecific synthetases that would be required for the model
proposed here might make this an appropriate metaphor.
Similarly, Yarus's (2001) article "On translation by RNAs
alone", and Yarus & Welch's (2000) article "Peptidyl
transferase: ancient and exiguous" contain some thoughts
that would be relevant here and later in the manuscript.
Author response: Dennett's metaphor of the Roman arch is,
indeed, excellent and might be relevant, even if not directly,
because, here, we are talking more of stepwise displacement
than selective elimination, and do not really postulate an initial
state that was more complex than the final one. In any case, one
of the strengths of the Biology Direct model is that the review is
published, so the reader can read about this metaphor here.
Ditto for the reviews by Yarus: the reader now knows of them
and may turn to them if desirable (other work from Yarus' laboratory is cited extensively).
The discussion of ribozymes on p. 18 could possibly benefit from a discussion of riboswitches and their implications for control mechanisms in the cell, and/or for the
other roles or RNA that suggest the RNA World (use in
cofactors, role in nucleotide metabolism, use of RNA as a
primer in DNA synthesis, etc.) However, the manuscript is
fairly long as it is, and most of these points have been
raised many times in the cited literature already.
Author response: Yes, the paper is fairly long, and we believe
that riboswtiches are of no direct relevance.
Finally, some of the specific contentions could benefit
from more elaboration. For example, on pp. 11â12, we
find the statement:
"Put another way, the conservation of the core of the
translation machinery is the strongest available evidence
that some form of LUCA actually existed (it is, in principle, conceivable that life started off as a multitude of distinct forms but a single variant of the translation system
subsequently took over as a result of a sweeping horizontal gene transfer; however, this is a decidedly non- parsimonious scenario)."

Biology Direct 2007, 2:14

Given that the present manuscript already proposes the
evolution of an entire suite of RNA-based aminoacyltRNA synthetases that no longer exist, and given that some
authors such as Carl Woese propose that the division of
life into distinct phylogenetic lineages was a relatively late
event (e.g. Woese 2002), it is unclear why horizontal gene
transfer should be dismissed in this context.
Author response: Upon more careful consideration (also considering Mushegian's comments below), we have deleted this
whole claim. Suffice it to say, in this context, that the conservation of the translation machinery is evidence of some form of
LUCA.
Similarly, on p. 20, the authors seem to be strongly in
favor of the hydrothermal vent scenario for the origin of
life. A few words of caution to the effect that this is one of
many hypotheses for life's origin, and that data are still far
from conclusive, might be in order.
Author response: we have included a few words to that effect
but also cite new references that, we believe, add credibility to
the hydrothermal vent scenario (refs. 75, 76).
The discussion of the current evidence relating to the
hypothesis that the genetic code arose through direct
interactions between RNA and amino acids on p. 23 is
good, but on p. 41 we read that "these affinities are weak,
only manifest as a statistical trend, and worst of all, are
seen, mostly, for chemically complex amino acids like
arginine or histidine, rather than simple ones, such as glycine or alanine, that would be readily produced abiogenically." This statement requires some elaboration. Many of
the potentially prebiotic amino acids, such as glycine, are
difficult to evaluate with the affinity chromatography paradigm for technical reasons. It is possible that other methodologies, such as the allosteric selections pioneered by
Tang & Breaker (1997), will allow us to see interactions in
these cases, but for now absence of evidence should not be
taken as evidence of absence. It is also far from certain that
the biosynthesis of complex amino acids such as arginine
would have been beyond the capabilities of RNA World
organisms, so the primordial genetic code need not have
been confined to simple amino acids. Second, the physical interactions involved are often far from weak: some
amino acid aptamers, such as the best of Famulok's
(1996) arginine aptamers, have sub-micromolar dissociation constants. It is true that the inconsistency between
codon and anticodon modes of recognition remains to be
resolved, but I do not agree with the assertion that "objectively, we should accept FAM as the most likely model for
the emergence and evolution of translation". To accept
FAM given what we know now about the optimality of the
genetic code relative to random genetic codes, and the
relationships between amino acid binding sites and cog-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

nate triplets, requires an alternative explanation for the
strong statistical evidence that supports these hypotheses.
In the absence of such an alternative explanation for why
we see these patterns, which would be extremely unlikely
under the FAM, I would recommend that the discussion
be confined to pointing out where these processes would
most likely be able to act in the model (for example, everyone agrees that direct interactions between coding triplets and amino acids are not relevant to the modern
genetic code). It is possible that FAM is not an optimal
description of what is actually meant in the discussion in
the text â really, the claim seems to be that there is no necessary relationship between triplets of RNA and amino
acids, rather than that there is in fact no pattern. However,
in my opinion, the discussion of FAM vs. ARM vs. CRM as
presented is likely to be a distraction from the overall
value of the new ideas presented in the manuscript.
Author response: We cannot agree that this description is a
distraction; we think it is part and parcel of the paper, even if
the choice between ARM, CRM, and FAM has a limited effect
on the actual model considered here. However, this discussion
has been shortened and modified to make it more neutral with
regard to the choice between the model of amino acid- T RNA
recognition. The statement regarding weak interactions
between amino acids and aptamers has been dropped along
with the over-assertive statement regarding FAM as "the most
likely model". It seems like in the text we clearly explain what
we mean by FAM â indeed, it is about a lack of any direct connection between amino acids and cognate triplet. Also, we consider the amended version of FAM where subsequent
adaptation of the code is deemed likely.
Finally, the description of experimental tests on p44 could
benefit from more detail. Which properties of the postulated T RNAs are in doubt, and which steps would, if
experimentally confirmed, best support the model? More
specific guidance might increase the probability that supporting laboratory work would be carried out.
Author response: A brief discussion has been added.

synthesis. It is very tempting to buy into all of the authors'
arguments. It is equally tempting to criticize them all.
The main postulate of Wolf and Koonin is that they are
trying to build a model based on the Continuity Principle.
In lay language, this means they are trying to put little
solid rocks into the vast swamp that separates the evolutionary island of the RNA World, where most of the biochemical reactions are catalyzed by ribozymes, from the
island of the modern nucleic acid-protein world, where
biochemistry is carried out primarily by protein enzymes
whilst nucleic acids are involved mostly in storage and
expression of genetic information. Trying to bridge this
gap, the authors envision the intermediate steps on the
evolutionary path to the genetic code and coded protein
synthesis, where innovations that arose at each of the
steps could be selected for. In this approach, Wolf and
Koonin strive to allow for the fewest number of evolutionary gaps that would require a significant leap rather than
a small jump. Not that this is a new approach â most of
the previous attempts to delineate the origin of protein
synthesis were based on a generally similar idea. However,
in the prior works, it was probably more of an intuitive
attempt to build a plausible scenario than a formulated
goal as in the essay of Wolf and Koonin.
The question is how closely those rocks of Wolf and
Koonin are spaced and how solid they are. Some of them
appear to be nicely positioned and are fairly solid,
whereas the others, in my view, are either shaky or missing.
It seems to be a very reasonable idea that some of the RNA
World ribozymes could benefit from a bound amino acid
cofactor or even cofactors. It appears to be a much more
far-fetched speculation that two or even more of these
cofactors would bind in such close proximity of each
other that the formation of a peptide bond between them
would be possible and beneficial. Furthermore, it is not
entirely clear from where a hypothetical peptide ligase
would derive the energy that is required for peptide bond
formation. In the modern ribosome, the energy that powers peptide bond formation is conserved in the highenergy ester bond that links the C-terminal amino acid of
a nascent peptide to tRNA. The energy of this ester bond is
derived from ATP consumed by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase â a source hardly available in the RNA world.
Author response: Yes, the issue of the energy source is important. One would have to propose that one of the substrates of
the primordial peptide ligase was an activated amino acid, perhaps, even an aminoacyl adenylate. In the RNA world, such
derivatives would have to be produced by other ribozymes, and
ribozymes with such an activity, indeed, have been described
(see Table 1). Alternatively, the original ribozyme R might

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

have been an ATPase such that the emerging peptide ligase
would couple ATP hydrolysis with peptide synthesis. The text
was amended to address these issues.
Though the proposed route that leads to the origin of the
original peptide ligase/aminoacyl polymerase is questionable, the resulting entity â a ribozyme capable of polymerizing amino acids into peptides in an unprogrammed
fashion â seems highly plausible. As early experiments of
Monro have shown, the large ribosomal subunit of the
modern ribosome, a ribozyme in its own right, is still
capable of carrying out such a reaction if provided with
properly activated amino acids. So, if one is to accept Wolf
and Koonin's idea of a peptide ligase derived from a
ribozyme that is able to connect its amino acid cofactors
into a single peptide, then the next few steps in their scenario are rather convincing. The use of the resulting peptides by other ribozymes, a subfunctionalization of the
original peptide-ligating ribozyme into a specialized peptide ligase or amino acid polymerase, and the general benefit of having such a peptide ligase ribozyme in the
assembly of selfish cooperatives appear to pave a rather
smooth path for the ancestor of the large ribosomal subunit.
Having 'prepared' the key catalyst of protein synthesis,
Wolf and Koonin then address the problem of a tRNA
adaptor. An elegant idea they propose to justify the evolutionary necessity for establishing a link between pretRNAs and amino acids is that this would limit the diffusibility of a small amino acids and would help to increase
their local concentration. Given that ribozymes with tRNA
aminoacylating activities have been identified in SELEX
experiments, it is easy to imagine that ribozymes with
similar activities could have been selected through natural
evolution in the RNA World. When considering the correspondence between the tRNA anticodon and the amino
acid, Wolf and Koonin chose to not take sides in the discussion of whether the origin of the genetic code is based
on a chemical complementarity between an amino acid
and a codon or anticodon or is a result of a frozen evolutionary accident. Though the all-inclusive approach inevitably makes the description of this step somewhat fuzzy,
any of several scenarios mentioned in this section are
pleasantly consistent and provide good food for thought.
The next step is equally convincing: the invention of aminoacyl-tRNA organically leads to its use by the prototype
peptide ligating/aminoacyl polymerizing ribozyme and
thus completes the route to the large ribosomal subunit
ancestor.
The origin of the coded protein synthesis is based on
availability of three main players: the adaptor aminoacylRNA molecules with a strict amino acid-anticodon corre-

lation, an enzyme that can polymerize the activated
amino acids (the large ribosomal subunit precursor), and
a precursor of the small ribosomal subunit, a "reading
head" that selects the adaptor aminoacyl-RNA according
to the input genetic text. Wolf and Koonin derive the origin of the ancestor of the small ribosomal subunit not
from a pre-existing ribozyme but from a segment of the
large subunit precursor. In this 'Adam's rib' scenario, an
accessory RNA subunit RS evolves as a tool to enhance
binding and positioning of aminoacyl-tRNA on the catalytic subunit, then acquires the "burden of specific recognition," and later on, one of its own parts assumes the role
of a diffusible template. I am not sure whether this, rather
sketchy scenario, satisfies the acclaimed Continuity Principle. Furthermore, it is poorly supported by the fact that
the modern large ribosomal subunit can rather efficiently
catalyze peptide bond formation using tRNA substrates
even in the absence of the small subunit (Wohlgemuth,
Beringer, Rodnina, (2006) EMBO Rep., 7, 699â703).
From the point of view of this reviewer, it is more reasonable to root the origin of the small subunit in one of the
pre-existing ribozymes that could operate with RNA templates. The extant activities of the modern small ribosomal subunit, including its interaction with an RNA
template (mRNA) and ability to assemble on it the complementary sequences of the tRNA anticodons, bear the
features expected from the ancestral RNA replicase/RNA
ligase. Such a ribozyme could be viewed as an ancestor of
the ribosome decoding center. The suspected ability of the
modern 30 S subunit to cleave mRNA during ribosome
stalling or under the influence of specific protein factors
argues that the putative ancient catalytic center capable of
breaking (and thus forming) phosphodiester bonds may
still exist in the ribosome.
Author response: The possibility that the small subunit of the
ribosome evolved from an RNA replicase/triplicase is an interesting one, and we have considered a version of it when working
on the current model. This could directly connect the model discussed here with the triplicase model of Pool-Jeffares-Penny.
However...direct evidence is missing, so we decided to avoid
"overfitting" the model. Let the reader learn about this idea
from Mankin's comment. However, it is completely unclear to
us why the work of Wohlgemuth et al. is construed as evidence
against the model presented in the paper. We believe that, on
the contrary, it is readily compatible with this model, and we
cite it in the revision.
In conclusion, the essay of Wolf and Koonin is an interesting and highly stimulating work. Inadvertently, my review
sounds more critical than was intended. The reason is simple: the ideas we disagree with are more interesting for us
than the points we easily accept. The majority of the
points in the paper are of this latter category; the points
my comments mostly focus on are of the former.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/14

Other points of critique and comments:
1. The discussion of the model per se starts on p. 28. It
seems that an almost 30-page introduction is excessive
and often repetitive. The work would strongly benefit if
the first 28 pages were expressed more succinctly, possibly
as bulleted points in 2 pages.
Author response: We appreciate the virtues of brevity but this
paper was conceived as a specific model for the origin of translation placed against the critically examined background of the
relevant general evolutionary principles and previous research
in the area. We feel that it has to stay that way.
Reviewer #4: Arcady Mushegian
The most significant contribution of this study is in
decomposing the tantalizingly complex problem of the
origin of genetic code, translation, and RNA replication
into a series of proposed small evolutionary transitions,
each associated with its own contribution to the fitness of
the genetic system that experiences these transitions. I
whole-heartedly recommend this manuscript for publication and expect that this series of transitions will be further scrutinized, perhaps along the lines of necessity and
sufficiency.
My only scientific complain is about the half-haphazard
conclusion that the frozen-accident model of adaptor recognition by amino acids is the most likely one. It might
be, or it might be not: the fact that current direct experiments fail to establish specific recognition of cognate
(anti)codons for evolutionarily more primitive amino
acids does not make a "frozen accident" mechanistically
attractive. Moreover, if, for example, primitive nucleobases were abiotically derivatized (see the work from
S.Benner's lab that seems to point in this direction), then
the experiments with the present-day codons or anticodons are not even answering the right question. The
authors should mention that work or at least stay even
more agnostic about the recognition model.
Author response: we infused considerable extra agnosticism,
also, in response to Knight's comments (see above).
Other, minor, comments:
"The Continuity Principle" has connections with Anton
Dorn's change-of-function principle (Ursprung der Wirbeltiere und das Prinzip des Funktionswechsels, Leipzig,
1875) â perhaps this is worth acknowledging.
Author response: In truth, the principle really goes back to
Darwin, the rest are reformulations and explanations. We
jump to a modern version immediately, leaving Dorn out.

As discussed by the authors, should Darwin-Eigen cycle be
renamed Darvin-Eigen-Lynch-Conery cycle?
Author response: If one wants to be really fair, then, maybe,
Darwin-Eigen-Penny-Lynch-Conery -(Wolf-Koonin)? For the
time being, we are sticking with the original name, after Penny.

The study is well-written, but perhaps it can be edited a bit
more. For example, the notion that "evolution has no
foresight", however important, is seen at least five times,
including two times within one bulleted list on pg 29.
