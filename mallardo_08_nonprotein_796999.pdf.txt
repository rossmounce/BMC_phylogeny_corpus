Abstract
Background: In these years a huge number of human transcripts has been found that do not code
for proteins, named non-protein coding RNAs. In most cases, small (miRNAs, snoRNAs) and long
RNAs (antisense RNA, dsRNA, and long RNA species) have many roles, functioning as regulators
of other mRNAs, at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, and controlling protein
ubiquitination and degradation. Various species of npcRNAs have been found differentially
expressed in different types of cancer. This review discusses the published data and new results on
the expression of a subset of npcRNAs.
Conclusion: These results underscore the complexity of the RNA world and provide further
evidence on the involvement of functional RNAs in cancer cell growth control.

Background
In recent years a large number of non-protein coding transcripts has been discovered. Many transcripts have been
identified with low coding potential, possessing only
short open reading frames (smaller than 200 nucleotides), potentially coding for 50–70 amino acid small
peptides. The possibility of coding for peptides has been
excluded for npcRNA in the following cases: absence of
ORFs longer than 60 bases; presence of ORFs but absence
of Kozak sequences at translation start sites; or no interspecies phylogenetic conservation of the first methionine
codon, or absence of conservation in the ORF in related
species analysed by comparative genomic analysis. Bioinformatic methods can assist in the discrimination of noncoding from coding sequences, based on four principles:
open reading frame size, sequence similarity to known

proteins or protein domains, statistical models of proteincoding sequence, and synonymous versus non-synonymous substitution rates [1].
Some npcRNAs affect transcription [2] and chromosome
structure [3]. The human 7SK RNA binds and inhibits the
transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. 7SK RNA and the
components of the splicing apparatus U1–U6 snRNAs are
implicated in the regulation of transcriptional elongation.
TFIIH (transcription factor IIH), a general transcription
initiation factor, appears to associate specifically with U1
snRNA, a core splicing component. A human npcRNA, the
steroid receptor activator (SRA) RNA, was identified as
interacting with progestin steroid hormone receptor and
may serve as a coactivator of transcription [4,5]. In SRA,
the production of a peptide is an additional function. SevPage 1 of 12

eral extremely long npcRNAs detected in mammalian cells
have been implicated in silencing genes and changing
chromatin structure across large chromosomal regions.
Examples include the human Xist RNA required for X
chromosome inactivation and mouse Air RNA required
for autosomal gene imprinting. The chromosome-associated RNA has been proposed to recruit proteins that affect
chromatin structure, in order to establish and/or maintain
gene silencing. An eukaryote-specific RNA that is required
for proper chromosome replication and structure is the
telomerase RNA. This ncRNA is an integral part of the telomerase enzyme and serves as the template for the synthesis of the chromosome ends. Basal telomerase activity is
dependent on expression of the hTERT and hTR genes and
upregulation of telomerase gene expression is associated
with tumour development, and features of the tumour
environment itself may influence telomerase gene regulation. The majority of solid tumours contain regions of
hypoxia: it has recently been demonstrated that hypoxia
can increase telomerase activity. The chromatin landscape
of the telomerase promoters during hypoxia, revealed
dynamic recruitment of a transcriptional complex involving the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription factor,
together with p300, RNA polymerase II and TFIIB. HIF-1
traffics along and remains associated with the hTERT gene
as transcription proceeds. This study showed that hTERT
and hTR are subject to similar controls under hypoxia
highlighting the rapid and dynamic regulation of the telomerase genes in vivo [6]. Also in the analysis of the function of Vault complex (formed by the Vault protein, VPARP and Vault-RNA) by using mouse knocked out in
each Vault-component, some of these components has
been associated to cellular functions as: intracellular trafficking, lipid rafts, and cell proliferation (E. Wiemer, personal communication).
RNAs also regulate mRNA stability and translation. Some
npcRNA mimics the structures of other nucleic acids; the
6S RNA structure is reminiscent of an open bacterial promoter, and the tmRNA has features of both tRNAs and
mRNAs. Other npcRNAs, such as the RNase P RNA, have
catalytic functions. Although synthetic RNAs have been
selected to have a variety of biochemical functions, the
number of natural npcRNAs shown to have catalytic function is limited. Many npcRNAs are associated with proteins and augment their functions. One example is the
RNA activators of dsRNA-protein kinase [7]. The heatshock RNA, Hsr-1, switches on the transcriptional activity
of heat shock factor HSF-1 by inducing trimerization.
Other npcRNAs, such as the snRNAs and the SRP RNA,
serve key structural roles in RNA-protein complexes.
Expression studies helped in correlating a specific induction factor and the expression of transcripts with
unknown function. As example, the oxygen radical
response induces AK001558, a npcRNA often overex-

http://www.jeccr.com/content/27/1/19

pressed in cancers. AK027352 is a gene regulated by
hypoxia, often overexpressed in cancers, with features of
transmembrane proteins but also of npcRNAs as well.
It has become clear, also from chromosome tiling experiments using DNA microarrays, that most part of the
genome is transcribed, also in genomic regions previously
thought to contain junk DNA, and that many introns give
rise to new RNA species. In fact, not only these small RNA
species are constituents of RNP particles, but in many
cases regulate the alternative splicing of essential proteins,
a phenomenon that has great implication in inflammation, in disease and in cancer.
The H-Invitational (H-Inv) database of human full length
cDNAs, update 3.4 released in april 2006, contain about
30000 protein coding genes, 15000 peptide coding transcripts, a set of transcribed pseudogenes, and a huge array
of putative genes and candidate npcRNAs lacking any
open reading frame [8]. In addition to these genes, it was
shown that 10% of the protein coding genes are cotranslated with its antisense RNAs that regulate the levels of
expression of the sense mRNAs.
Nowadays, the most comprehensive database of npcRNAs
is curated by the ARC Research Centre in Brisbane [9] with
annotation of human, mouse, and literature curated
ncRNAs, an overview to the PubMed data, a BLAST function, and functional data and tissue expression patterns.
Human and mouse orthologs were screened for sequence
conservation and software for analysing secondary structures such as QRNA, RNAfold, RNAz [10], Evofold [11]
and Foldalign [12]. Three-dimensional architectural
motifs are increasingly recognized as determinants of
RNA functionality [13]. Such motifs can encode spatial
information. RNAs are targeted to subcellular localities in
many eukaryotic cell types, and especially in neuronal and
glial cells, RNAs can be transported over long distances to
their final destination sites. Such RNAs contain cis-acting
long-range targeting elements, and recent evidence suggests that kink-turn motifs within such elements may act
as spatial codes to direct transport. Kink-turns are complex RNA motifs that feature double- and single-stranded
components and introduce a signature three-dimensional
structure into helical stems.
Recently, the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE)
Project was set up in order to identify all functional elements in the human genome. The pilot phase is for comparison of existing methods and for the development of
new methods to rigorously analyze a defined 1% of the
human genome sequence. Experimental datasets are
focused on the origin of replication, DNase I hypersensitivity, chromatin immunoprecipitation, promoter function, gene structure, pseudogenes, non-protein-coding

RNAs, transcribed RNAs, multiple sequence alignment
and evolutionarily constrained elements. These databases
links to the University of California Santa Cruz browser,
to visualise the genes on the chromosomes [14].
A recent paper [15], in which long SAGE was used to identify 660000 transcripts isolated from a human brain,
described more than 20% novel and differently expressed
transcripts, showing that the actual number of genes in
human genome contain probably twice the number of
genes and transcribed regions.
The Head and Neck Annotation Consortium, as well as
the ENCODE consortium, produced a huge number of
transcripts of unknown function, often originating from
introns and from untranslated regions of the genome
[16]. It is hypothesised that some of them functions as
npcRNA.
The majority of the well-known ncRNAs are relatively
abundant. It was shown that long RNAs can produce
small RNA species, as in the case of H19 that give rise to
small RNA as well as to one identified microRNA [17].
The 130 kb deleted region on chromosome 3p12 in lung
(GLC20 line) and breast (U2020 and HCC38) cancer cell
lines was found to contain, near the protein coding gene
ROBO1/DUTT1 (Deleted in U2020), two npcRNAs with
short segments highly conserved among mammal
genomes, that are highly overexpressed in various cancers
in respect to normal tissues [18].
In a functional analysis of npcRNAs through highthroughput screens, a repressor of NFAT was found [19].
This npcRNA, NRON, by interacting with β-importins,
negatively regulates the nuclear trafficking of NFAT. In
another case, the expression of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene is repressed by one of its regulatory transcripts produced from the minor promoter showing a
mechanism of promoter-specific transcriptional repression [20]. EGO was shown to be essential for the expression of major basic protein in eosinophils [21]. However,
while a group of npcRNAs is conserved between mammalian genomes, a second group has been recognized as primate-specific [22] by applying phylogenetic and
comparative genomics analyses.
The mechanisms of action for the characterized ncRNAs
can be grouped into several general categories. There are
ncRNAs where base-pairing with another RNA or DNA
molecule is central to function. Antisense RNAs can regulated the induction of transcripts from different promoters or producing a spectrum of UTRs with various lengths.
One recent finding showed the regulation of the PTEN
induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) locus by a natural antisense producing a dsRNA [23]. There are snoRNAs that

http://www.jeccr.com/content/27/1/19

direct RNA modification, RNAs that modulate translation
by forming base pairs with specific target mRNAs, and
probably most of the miRNAs are examples of this category. Sno-like RNAs and other classes of regulatory RNAs
originate either from introns and exons of protein coding
and npcRNA genes produced by the RNA Polymerase II
transcription machinery, or transcribed (as H1, U6 or
7SK) by the RNA Pol III machinery. Recently, new human
ncRNAs have been detected and functionally characterised, which have high homology with protein-coding
genes [24]. The authors' data confirms the existence of a
sense/antisense-based gene regulation network, where
part of the Pol III transcriptome could control its Pol II
counterpart. In particular, the 21A transcript was shown
to co-regulate CENP-F gene and to modulate CENP-F
expression at post-transcriptional level: 21A overexpression specifically inhibited cell proliferation in their culture system [24]. This effect was related also to the finding
that 21A ncRNA is downregulated in tumour cell lines
(HeLa, 293T, and LAN5).
The microRNAs is the class of 21 base-long small RNAs,
having a hairpin structure, that affect target genes by forming perfect matches or base pairing to highly similar
sequences. In sheep, mutant Texel MSTN mRNA has mistakenly become the target of miRNAs because of its disguise using a target octamer motif borrowed from genuine
target genes. This phenomenon led to muscular hypertrophy in the "callipyge" sheep. In analogy, other genes were
found deregulated, as PEG11 and its antisense transcript
[25]. Subject to a similar mechanism of regulation, many
human disease susceptibility loci are related to SNPs
within a microRNA or its target gene.

Cancers
It has recently become evident that cancer is also subject
to translational control [26]. Several cancer-related regulatory events are mediated by the cap-dependent mRNA
binding stage of translation initiation. This implicates that
cap-dependent protein synthesis pathway is a pleotropic
integrator and amplifier of many essential oncogenic signals, and the translational control network as a bona fide
molecular target for regulation by RNA sequences. The
most important changes leading to cancer development
are caused by DNA mutations, deletions and chromosomal rearrangements. Besides genotypic alterations, epigenetic events as DNA hypermethylation or posttranslational modification of histones and DNA binding
proteins mostly affect the physiological levels of expressed
proteins (phenotypic alterations). Different regulation
and usage of promoters and alternative splicing produce
new protein isoforms. Alternative spliced isoforms of antioncogenes (devoid of activity) and constitutively-activated spliced forms of signalling proteins are cancero-

genic, and upregulation of the splicing factor SF2/ASF
transforms immortal rodent fibroblasts [27].
Although reprogramming of chromatin normally has
been shown during early telophase, the effect of singlestranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNAs (activator
RNA, fountain RNA, antisense RNA) can result in chromatin reprogramming during interphase. The formation of
by base-pairing between complementary RNAs may elicit
regulatory responses at the transcriptional level. Analysis
of antisense transcription at several imprinted loci has
suggested a number of other mechanisms that may not
require formation of dsRNA [28]. Many molecular lesions
after transformation are DNA-based, including chromosomal amplification, deletion, mutation, and translocation. Epigenetic lesions, not involving directly DNA
sequences, are RNA-based, and perhaps amenable to RNA
exchange during reprogramming. An interesting experiment [29] published in 1963, showed that pure isolated
RNA from normal bone marrow was able to temporarily
reverse into a normal phenotype the neoplastic state of
human acute myelocytic leukemia cells following intramarrow injection. RNA-based lesions may be more reversible than DNA-based lesions within human neoplasms.
Many cellular pathways are implicated in cancer development, as the DNA damage response, the growth arrest, the
regulation of survival genes, and the apoptotic pathway.
For some microRNA, a direct role in some of these pathways has been shown. In the case of the growth arrest
genes, gas5, which contains intronic sequences producing
small nucleolar RNAs, is itself a npcRNA [30].

npcRNAs implicated in cancer
Cancer is a multistep genetic and epigenetic disease with
a complex etiology. Several defects such as mutations,
down-regulation, over-expression and deletions in oncogenes and tumor suppressor protein-coding genes have
been extensively described in cancer cells. Recently, transcriptome analysis and different experimental approaches
comparing tumor cells to normal ones are providing
strong evidence that defects in ncRNAs might occur in
tumors [31,32]. The H19 gene was the first example of a
large ncRNA associated with tumors to be described [33]
and we are now facing a growing list of ncRNA transcripts
implicated in different types of cancer [34]. Some of these
examples are discussed in the next sections and shown in
Table 1. The metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma
transcript 1 (MALAT-1) gene is one of the major genes
upregulated in Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) of the
uterus a rare uterine malignancy. In addition, MALAT-1 is
found overexpressed in other cancers as in endometrial
sarcoma of the uterus [35] and in hepatocellular carcinomas. It was recently identified as noncoding nuclear
enriched abundant transcript (NEAT2) from the locus on
chromosome 11 coding for two TncRNAs, and is the polyadenylated component of nuclear speckles [36]. NAMA,
found downregulated in papillary thyroid carcinomas
[37], is a gene induced by the DNA damage response.
OCC1 is overexpressed in colon carcinomas [38].
TRNG10 has been related to various types of cancer [39].
His-1, a gene involved in leukemias by frequent viral
insertion in mouse, has a human counterpart [40].
HOST2 is a npcRNA gene expressed in ovarian cancer cells

[41]. Ovarian cancers show alteration of the 17q25
region, in which the SEPT9 locus originates a large
number of transcripts. A difference in the level of the produced mRNAs, that encode exactly the same polypeptide,
is present in their 5'UTR. It is postulated that variations in
the use of the untranscribed regions may affect the production and amount of proteins. The down-regulation of
the cytoglobin gene, in tylosis with oesophageal cancer
was shown to be caused by a trans-allele repression mechanism [42]. Many of the mechanisms that modify the
UTRs, or that affect differential splicing, make use of RNA
regulation, antisense RNAs, and may involve RNP complexes.
Hormone dependent cancers
The function of some npcRNA as tumor suppressor and of
other as oncogenes is not well understood, but in many
case the resistance to apoptosis or the proliferative ability
do not well relate with tumour development. Mammary
gland development is associated to the induced expression of the npcRNA PINC [43], in cells that have progenitor-like ability but show inhibition of carcinogen-induced
proliferation. Breast cancer with oestrogen receptor positivity is associated with high expression of ncRNAs as SRA
[5,44]. The up-regulation of SRA in many human tumours
of steroid-dependent tissue may reflect a cellular effort to
antagonize excessive proliferation. Additional studies are
needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved. It is possible that tumor progression is controlled by the specific
composition of ribonucleoprotein complexes containing
SRA, whose expression level determines whether transcriptional coactivators or corepressors are incorporated.
This model is consistent with to the reported role of SRA
in attenuation of Steroid Receptor transactivation. Even
so, the analysis of SRA in mouse models suggest that the
promotion of proliferating functions used to achieve
established tissue structures occurs in conjunction with
mechanisms to prevent tumour formation. H19 is found
at high levels in the cell line SKBR3 overexpressing the
ERBB2 kinase; H19 is known to produce also a microRNA
[16]. Duplex RNAs complementary to the progesterone
receptor (PR) promoter increased the expression of PR
protein and RNA after transfection into cultured T47D or
MCF7 human breast cancer cells [45]. Upregulation of PR
protein reduced the expression of downstream cyclooxygenase 2 gene but did not change concentrations of estrogen receptor, demonstrating that activation of RNAs can
manipulate physiologically relevant cellular pathways.
Prostate cancer is an hormone-dependent tumour in
which androgen receptor activity is related to the expression of PSA (prostate specific antigen) as well as to other
cancer-associated npcRNAs (DD3, PCGEM1). In some
cases, sensitivity to low levels of androgen is increased by
amplification, mutations and/or elevated levels or broadened specificity of co-activators of the androgen receptors.

http://www.jeccr.com/content/27/1/19

After anti-androgenic treatment, primary prostate cancers
can also shift to an androgen-independent state and
become recurrent, activation of androgen receptors occurring in the absence of androgens due to crosstalk via other
signalling pathways. A correlation was shown between
androgen receptor activation and the expression of
intronic npcRNAs [46], in the antisense direction in the
majority of cases, in LNCaP cells treated with the hormone. In addition, the binding of the nuclear receptor to
an upstream regulating region of an intron was demonstrated.
Resistance to chemotherapeutics and malignant phenotype
Many chemotherapeutics used for cancer treatment may
be ineffective due to the expression of npcRNAs. It was
shown that the overexpression of PCGEM1, a prostate
associated npcRNA, inhibited the apoptosis induced by
doxorubicin, etoposide and sodium selenite, in the
LNCaP cell culture model [47]. The attenuation of apoptotic response was shown to be androgen dependent, ass
is the induction of PCGEM1 expression. A major obstacle
for clinicians in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer
is the inevitable progression to chemo-resistance, especially to docetaxel and taxans. It was shown that this effect
is mediated through the activation of STAT1 phosphorylation, and downstream to the expression of clusterin. It
would be important to individuate the mechanisms
involving proteins and possibly npcRNAs that could
block this pathway. Many data are known on the beneficial activity of curcumin, tea polyphenols and other flavonoids on the inhibition of STAT1 activation. Resveratrol
was shown to increase the deacetylase activity of sirtuins.
It is not yet known the identity of possible partners in the
control of this pathway and the cellular components
inside the cell on which bioactive plant compounds exert
their effect. It could be possible that some npcRNA can
bind to bioactive compounds and be regulated by a riboswitch-like mechanism.
Leukemias
Deleted in leukemia (Leu-1), a npcRNA gene transcribed
head to head to Leu-2 in the opposite direction, is located
on chromosome 13q14, in the 30-kb region of loss in
chronic B-cell lymphocytic leukaemia, near the miR-15/
miR16 cluster [48]. The homozygous loss of this region
has great effects on the regulation and control of normal
CD5+ B lymphocytes and their homeostasis. Leu-1 was
found expressed in normal thymus, testis, intestine, and
to a lesser extent in other tissues. BCMS was found to be a
long mRNA containing Leu-1 and the most likely candidate for the tumor suppressor gene in 13q14 [49]. In this
review, we will not discuss the cases of snoRNAs found in
the chromosomal breakpoints involved in some types of
human B-cell lymphoma and other leukemias, since their
location in the breakpoints could be a mere coincidence.

HIS-1 is a common site of viral insertion in mouse. His-1,
when overexpressed, induces myeloid leukemias. The 5'flanking region is highly conserved in the human
homolog. Sequence comparisons between the mouse and
human genes identified conservation of other putative
functional domains in exon 3 and in each of the two
introns, but none of the multiple candidate ORFs in the
mouse RNA were conserved in the human sequence, suggesting that the RNA may be the final and functional
product from the human and mouse His-1 genes [40].
microRNAs in cancers and leukemias
Few classes of ncRNAs have a well-defined function. One
group that is well characterized, at the biochemical level,
is represented by miRNAs. This group comprises a large
class of small non coding RNAs (~22-nucleotide RNAs)
acting through base pairing to partially complementary
sites in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) of the targeted
messenger RNA [50]. This lead to reduced translation of
the related proteins (natural RNAi) [51]. Similarly to transcription factors, miRNAs can play an essential role in regulation of gene expression and control of the cellular fate.
miRNAs biogenesis has very peculiar features if compared
to other ncRNAs classes, such as two maturation steps
occurring in different subcellular districts. Several miRNAs are embedded within introns of protein-coding genes
or non-coding RNA transcripts [52]. This observation suggests that a large number of miRNAs might be transcriptionally linked to the expression of their host-gene
promoters. An amplification or a block of the effects of
miRNAs on their target genes is observed when nucleotide
substitutions appear in microRNAs or in its target genes,
blocking thus their interaction. miRNAs are generated as a
primary transcript (pri-miRNA) by RNA polymerase II
[53] or by RNA polymerase III-like viral miRNAs [54]. PrimiRNAs are capped, polyadenylated [55] and subsequently they enter a microprocessor complex (500–650
kDa) consisting of a Drosha (an RNase III endonuclease)
and an essential cofactor DGCR8/Pasha protein containing two double-stranded RNA binding domains [56,57].
There, they are processed and cleaved giving rise to
another precursor of 60–80 nucleotide stem-loop
sequence (pre-miRNA) with a 5' phosphate and two 3'
nucleotide overhang. The pre-miRNAs are then transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5, a member of the
Ran transport receptor family [58]. Finally, the stem-loop
structure is sequentially processed by the cytosolic RNase
III Dicer [59] to yield the mature single-stranded miRNA.
The single-stranded mature miRNA is incorporated into
the cytosolic effector complex, called RNA-Induced
Silencing Complex (RISC). Within the RISCs miRNA
exarches its function of translational silencing by basepairing the 3' UTR of the specifically targeted mRNAs
[60,61].

http://www.jeccr.com/content/27/1/19

Recently, it has been shown that in addition to this mechanism, silencing by miRNA can be triggered by a miRNAinduced rapid deadenylation of the messenger RNA that
leads to rapid degradation of the latter [62].
Although the elucidation of miRNAs function has not
progressed as other aspects in the field, the role of this
family of ncRNAs in the molecular aetiology of cancer has
been extensively investigated. Several laboratories have
modified DNA microarray technology to form miRNA
microarray technology. Using this technique they have
performed the miRNA expression profile (miRNome) in
cancer patients with solid tumors or hematological malignancies and found that miRNAs are differentially
expressed in normal and tumor tissues [63]. These differences are often tumor-specific and, in some cases, can be
related to prognosis.
One of the firsts evidences for the involvement of miRNAs
in cancers came from molecular studies characterizing the
13q14 deletion in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) and the localization of human miR-15a/miR-16
cluster and miR-146 at the chromosomal breakpoint or
deletion sites [48]. These data suggested their possible
involvement in the aetiology of the chronic lymphocytic
leukemia [64]. (Calin et al. 2002) and multiple myeloma
[65]. Further, Cimmino and colleagues [66] showed that
miR-15 and miR-16 induce apoptosis by targeting antiapoptotic gene B Cell Lymphoma 2 (BCL2) mRNA, a key
player in many types of human cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, and carcinomas [67]. In this respect,
miR-15 and miR-16 can be considered as potential tumor
suppressor genes. Another miRNA, Let7a, could be a
potential tumor suppressor gene. Takamizawa [68]
showed that let7a was significantly downregulated in lung
cancer. This data was confirmed by the finding that let7a
overexpression in lung cancer cell lines inhibited cell
growth in vitro. Moreover, Johnson et al. [69] demonstrated that Ras protooncogene mRNA is targeted by let7a
and this leads to repression of Ras protein translation.
Lung tumor tissue displays low let7a expression whereas
Ras protein is significantly overexpressed compared to
normal lung tissue [68]. Conversely, miR155, encoded by
the non-protein coding Bic gene, displays numerous
oncogenic features. Recently, Costineau [70] showed that
selective overexpression of miR155 in B cell, constitutively driven by Eμ-enhanced promoter, led to B-cell polyclonal proliferation followed by high-grade lymphoma
pre-B leukemia. In accordance to this observation,
miR155 is overexpressed in pediatric EBV-positive Burkitt
lymphoma [71], Hodgkin lymphomas, primary mediastinal and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas [72], and in EBVimmortalized B-cell lines (Mallardo et al., unpublished
results). Although the above mentioned works seems to

genes or tumor suppressor genes, further work is needed
to fulfil this important issue. Indeed, a peculiar situation
is represented by miR-17-92 cluster. He and colleagues
[73] showed that overexpression of miR17-92 cluster
obtained by viral transduction in hematopoietic stem cells
from Myc transgenic mice strongly triggers tumor development. This finding can indicate an oncogenic function
of the miR cluster. Consistently, overexpression of miR17-92 cluster has been observed in human lung cancer
where it enhances cell proliferation [74]. On the other
hand, O'Donnell found that overexpression miR-17-92
cluster, directly driven by c-myc-binding to the cluster
promoter, provokes downregulation of E2F1 translation
whose mRNA is targeted by miR17 [75]. E2F1, a myc target, promotes cell proliferation. According to these findings miR-17-92 cluster would act as tumour suppressor
gene.
If it is currently accepted that miRNAs can play a central
role in the molecular aetiology and maintenance of cancer, several groups are investigating to address the question of whether the miRNA expression profile could
become a useful biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Data on miRNA expression profile, obtained by
miRNA microarray, on cohorts of patients with cancer
compared to normal people are giving raise evidences that
miRNA are differentially expressed in cancer and normal
tissue. The evaluation of miRNA expression profiles of 10
normal and 76 neoplastic breast tissues, using miRNA
microarray, showed that the miRNAs expression patterns
were significantly different between normal and neoplastic breast tissues [76]. In particular, miR-125b, miR-145,
miR-21, and miR-155 were significantly reduced in breast
cancer tissues. Furthermore they observed an interesting
correlation between the expression of miRNAs and specific breast cancer biopathologic features, such as tumour
stage, proliferation index, oestrogen and progesterone
receptor expression, and vascular invasion [76]. Another
report shows the correlation of high miR-155 expression
with short survival in lung cancer pointing out the importance of miRNA expression pattern with prognosis [64]. A
large miRnome analysis on 540 samples including breast,
lung, stomach, prostate, colon and pancreatic tumours
identified a solid-cancer signature of overexpressed miRNAs, such as miR-155, miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-21,
miR-92 and miR-106a [77]. Calin [64] reported significant differences in miRNA expression between human
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia B cells and their normal
counterpart CD5+ B cells. Lately, it has been shown a link
between a miRNA signature and prognosis and progression of CLL [65].
Although miRNAs are a newly discovered class of ncRNAs,
they have quickly got importance in molecular oncology.
Therefore, it seems to be clear that the understanding of

http://www.jeccr.com/content/27/1/19

their function and the investigation of the expression profile of these peculiar ncRNAs will provide insight in
molecular basis of cancer and, in the near future, powerful
tools for diagnosis, prognosis and classification of cancers.
Tumour-associated viruses and npcRNAs
Globally, it is estimated that 20% of all cancers are linked
to infectious agents. Studies of oncogenic DNA viruses
have contributed to the understanding of key molecular
mechanisms of tumorigenesis and viral oncogenicity.
Human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), a retrovirus that infects 20 million people worldwide, was the first
retrovirus to be shown to be causal for a human cancer,
adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL). The maintenance of ATL
transformation seems to require the function of a novel
antisense protein and RNA, termed HTLV-1 basic leucine
zipper factor (HBZ). A mechanism by which viruses survive inside cells is by inactivating the cellular antiviral
machinery, or inactivating the RNA interference response,
or acting on the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR).
Virally encoded oncoproteins such as adenovirus E1A and
human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 can bind an array of cellular proteins to override proliferation arrest. Adenovirus
VA1 noncoding RNA can inhibit small interfering RNA
and MicroRNA biogenesis, both by inhibiting nuclear
export of shRNA or premicro-RNA precursors, competing
for the Exportin 5 nuclear export factor, and inhibiting
Dicer function by direct binding of Dicer [78]. Recently,
many viral-encoded miRNAs have been discovered,
mostly in viruses transcribed from double-stranded DNA
genomes. Several virus-encoded miRNAs have unique
aspects to their biogenesis, such as the polymerase that
transcribes them or their location within the precursor
transcript. Additionally, viral interactions with cellular
miRNAs have also been identified, and these have substantially expanded the knowledge of miRNA functions.
The functions of most viral-derived miRNAs are
unknown; however, functions have been documented or
proposed for viral miRNAs from three different viral families-herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, and retroviruses.

HPV and HSV are the most well known viruses that act
through the production or through the regulation of cellular npcRNAs. The family of human herpesvirus include
pathogens such as herpex simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and for murine tumours the
herpesvirus 68 (MHV68). These viruses share the ability to
establish latency in the host after an early replication
phase. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that is normally carried lifelong as an asymptomatic
infection. However, EBV is also the causative agent of
infectious mononucleosis and is linked to the development of several malignant tumours, including B-cell neo-

plasms such as Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's
disease, certain forms of T-cell lymphoma, and epithelial
and nasopharyngeal cancers. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is
shown to express at least 17 distinct microRNAs (miRNAs) in latently infected cells, which potentially regulate
both viral and cellular genes. The BART miRNAs are
expressed at high levels in latently infected epithelial cells
and at lower, albeit detectable, levels in B cells. The
BHRF1 miRNAs are found at high levels in B cells undergoing stage III latency but are essentially undetectable in
B cells or epithelial cells undergoing stage I or II latency.
Induction of lytic EBV replication was found to enhance
the expression of many, but not all, of these viral miRNAs.
In addition, oncogenic potential of EBV, independent of
its effect on c-myc-induced apoptosis, is exerted by 2
highly expressed small non-protein-coding RNAs, EBER1
and EBER2. In Herpesviruses, EBER RNA block the activity
of dsRNA-PKR in infected cells.
The pathogenic Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(KSHV) encodes an array of 12 distinct miRNAs [79] all of
which are expressed at readily detectable levels in latently
KSHV infected cells. Target candidate genes of the viral
microRNAs include several mRNAs previously shown to
be down-regulated in KSHV-infected cells. Herpesvirus:
The latency-associated transcript (LAT) of herpes simplex
virus-1 (HSV-1) is the only viral gene expressed during
latent infection in neurons. LAT inhibits apoptosis and
maintains latency by promoting the survival of infected
neurons. No protein product has been attributed to the
LAT gene and the mechanism by which LAT protects cells
from apoptosis is not yet known. It was shown that a
miRNA encoded by the HSV-1 LAT gene confers resistance
to apoptosis. Mir-LAT downregulates also transforming
growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and SMAD3 expression [80].
Experimental results and advancements in npcRNAs
regulation and expression
Retinoids (Vitamin A) have important functions in development, maintenance of epithelial surfaces, immune
competence, and reproduction. All-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) induces the transcription of a selected number of
ncRNAs, in a tissue specific way [81]. The ability of ATRA
to regulate expression of several hundred genes through
binding to nuclear transcription factors is believed to
mediate most of these functions. The role of all-trans
retinoic may extend beyond the regulation of gene transcription because a large number of noncoding RNAs also
are regulated by retinoic acid. Additionally, extra-nuclear
mechanisms of action of retinoids are also being identified. Furthermore, specific binding proteins are involved
in several of these enzymatic processes as well as in delivery of all-trans retinoic acid to nuclear receptors. Thus,
substantial progress has been made in our understanding
of retinoid metabolism and function. Retinoids as critical

http://www.jeccr.com/content/27/1/19

molecules in vision, normal embryonic development, and
in control of cellular growth, differentiation, and death
throughout life. Retinoids are also therapeutically effective in the treatment of some cancers. It was shown that
ATRA induces differentiation of HL60 and NB4 cell lines.
The growth-inhibitory effect of all-trans retinoic acid on
tumour cells was put in relationship with the expression
of retinoic acid receptor alpha gene [82]. Retinoic acid
receptors activation triggers transcriptional events leading
either to transcriptional activation or repression of retinoid-controlled genes. Using high-density oligonucleotide
arrays representing essentially all nonrepetitive sequences
on human chromosomes 21 and 22, for mapping the
DNA binding sites for Sp1, cMyc, and p53 transcription
factors, transcription of non-protein coding RNAs
dependent on retinoic acid was shown [83]. It is possible
that RAR-α activates many transcription factors as NF-k-B,
C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β and C/EBP-ε [84]. In addition, also in
HL-60 cells ATRA induces growth arrest. ATRA reduces the
expression of Survivin, an anti-apoptotic oncogene, in
NB4 cells. ATRA downregulation of RAS correlates with
the overexpression of let-7a (Mallardo, manuscript in
preparation). miR-15a/miR-16-1 decreases the level of
Bcl2: in several human CLL cases, miR-15a and miR-16-1
expression is abolished or diminished. PML-RAR translocation in leukaemia cells is a particular case of malignancies with low aggressive potential, in which therapeutic
intervention using retinoic acids has been shown feasible.
We speculate that among the ATRA induced genes there
are npcRNAs that cooperate to control the transcriptional
activity and able to revert the cells into a more differentiated state. We manufactured a DNA array with 500 oligonucleotides relative to human npcRNA genes and
monitored their differential expression in NB4 cell line
before and after ATRA treatment, individuating 30
npcRNAs that are deregulated by retinoic acid (manuscript in preparation). A functional assignment to these
deregulated genes could lead to the identification of candidate tumour modifiers with antiproliferative activity.
Transcriptional Cancer Therapeutics
The treatment of cancers can be approached either by
potentiating established therapies either by intervening
on the epigenetic control of gene expression, and also by
silencing cancer activator genes. p53, the tumour suppressor and transcriptional shield to cancer, is mutated in
many cancers: for some mutations, p53 can be reactivated
by peptides and chemical compounds. It was shown that
the expression levels of a number of miRNAs is affected by
wt-p53, with consequences on the expression of proteins
involved in proliferation [85]. p53 is regulated at posttranscriptional level: one of these mechanisms is p53
deacetylation by sirtuins. Cell proliferation activity can be
controlled by chemical intervention on histone acetylase
and deacetylase enzymes, involved in the regulation of

transcriptionally active euchromatin and inactive heterochromatin. Histone Acetyltransferases and Histone
Deacetylases (HATs and HDACs) show deregulated activity in many tumours, and treatment of hypermethylated
DNA with demethylating agents and drugs as an associated therapy is an approach that can reactivate tumour
suppressor expression. The anti-leukemic effects of distinct histone deacetylase (HDAC1 and Sir2) inhibitors,
i.e. sodium phenyl butyrate (PB) and vitamin B3, respectively, on human promyelocytic leukaemia cells HL-60,
using HDAC Inhibitors alone and in combination with
ATRA was recently investigated [86], showing significant
acceleration and a high level of granulocytic differentiation. Another level of epigenetic control is achieved by
regulation of gene expression by methylation of CpG
islands. One of the hallmarks of tumour cells is deregulated DNA methylation patterns. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is the major mammalian enzyme
responsible for maintaining CpG methylation patterns in
the cell following replication. Chemical intervention and
reactivation of silenced genes is today possible in various
cancers. A different approach to induce a change in gene
expression is through the uptake inside the cells of RNAlike sequences, with promising therapeutic applications
[87,88]. Anti-gene dsRNA, directed to specific regions in
gene promoters, can activate and repress gene expression
at the DNA level [89], without targeting the chromosomal
DNA itself. It is more likely that the agRNA is targeting
npc-RNA that is transcribed either in the sense or antisense direction. There is mounting evidence that such
antisense transcripts do indeed regulate coding transcripts. agRNAs may elicit or help Argonaute proteins
responsible for unwinding of dsRNA during RNAi, to bind
a complementary npc-RNA. The complex could recruit
proteins or change the conformation of proteins already
bound to the chromosomal DNA resulting in gene repression or activation. Over the last years, RNA interference
(RNAi) has become a widely used technique that permits
the knock-down, and hence functional analysis, of individual genes in vertebrate cells. Experimental steps and
expression vectors have been optimised [90] to facilitate
the effective knock-down of almost any vertebrate gene
product in cultured cells or in experimental animals.
Inflammatory pathways, sustained through NF-kB and
AKT/PI3K signalling, converge to Stat 3 [91] and Stat1
activation. Activation of Stat1, and its subsequent regulation of clusterin, and STAT3, and its subsequent regulation of c-myc, cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, survivin, VEGF, and miR21 [92] shows that these pathways sustain cell proliferation and antiapoptotic signalling. STAT3 have been linked
with chemoresistance and radioresistance. It is essential to
prevent the induction of resistance to taxanes or to other
commonly used anticancer drugs, by finding a correct
association of therapeutics and modulators of signalling
pathways. It is likely that using a combination of different

http://www.jeccr.com/content/27/1/19

therapeutic compounds and by intervening on various
target mechanisms it will be possible to intervene on certain types of cancer through regulation of the transcriptional machinery.

Conclusion
These data and those on other ncRNAs found implicated
in cancer as HULC in hepatocarcinomas [93] and on the
involvement of CUDR in drug resistance in squamous carcinoma cell lines [94] show that non-coding RNAs in cancer can be used either as biomarkers and also as therapy
targets. It is envisaged the possibility in the future to individuate and act through npcRNAs linked to the transcription machinery in normal cells, either by means of RNA
silencing or reactivation of expression, or through chemicals that bind and regulate the activity of npcRNAs.
