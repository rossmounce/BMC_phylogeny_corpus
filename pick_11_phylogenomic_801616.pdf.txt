Phylogenomic analyses of malaria parasites and
evolution of their exported proteins
Christian Pick1†, Ingo Ebersberger2†, Tobias Spielmann3, Iris Bruchhaus3 and Thorsten Burmester1*

Abstract
Background: Plasmodium falciparum is the most malignant agent of human malaria. It belongs to the taxon
Laverania, which includes other ape-infecting Plasmodium species. The origin of the Laverania is still debated. P.
falciparum exports pathogenicity-related proteins into the host cell using the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL).
Predictions based on the presence of a PEXEL motif suggest that more than 300 proteins are exported by P.
falciparum, while there are many fewer exported proteins in non-Laverania.
Results: A whole-genome approach was applied to resolve the phylogeny of eight Plasmodium species and four
outgroup taxa. By using 218 orthologous proteins we received unanimous support for a sister group position of
Laverania and avian malaria parasites. This observation was corroborated by the analyses of 28 exported proteins
with orthologs present in all Plasmodium species. Most interestingly, several deviations from the P. falciparum
PEXEL motif were found to be present in the orthologous sequences of non-Laverania.
Conclusion: Our phylogenomic analyses strongly support the hypotheses that the Laverania have been founded
by a single Plasmodium species switching from birds to African great apes or vice versa. The deviations from the
canonical PEXEL motif in orthologs may explain the comparably low number of exported proteins that have been
predicted in non-Laverania.

Background
Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases,
putting about two billion humans at risk and resulting
in about one million fatalities each year [1]. Malaria is
caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium
(Haemosporidae; Apicomplexa). Species of this genus
undergo a complex life cycle including an asexual proliferation phase in the erythrocytes of vertebrate hosts.
Although hundreds of Plasmodium species are currently known, only few infect humans. In moderate climate zones, human malaria infection is largely due to P.
vivax, but the life-threatening form of this disease is
almost exclusively caused by P. falciparum. About 60
years ago, the high pathogenicity of P. falciparum led to
the proposal that this parasite may be a rather recent
acquisition from a non-human host [2]. Since then, it
has become evident that P. falciparum indeed is closely

related to other Plasmodium species from African great
apes [3,4]. Together they constitute the subgenus Laverania and several reciprocal host switches have occurred
during the evolution of this group of malaria parasites
[5-9].
The evolutionary ancestry of P. falciparum and the
other Laverania is still a matter of debate. Until now, it
has not been conclusively agreed on whether this subgenus is more closely related to other mammalian malaria
parasites or whether it shares a common ancestry with
bird-infecting Plasmodium species (reviewed in [10]).
Most molecular phylogenetic studies of the genus Plasmodium are based on the analysis of single proteins
such as cytochrome b oxidase, adenylosuccinate lyase,
and caseinolytic protease C [10]. While these proteins
contain sufficient phylogenetic information to resolve
the relationships within the Laverania, multiple substitutions per site (homoplasy) limit their utility at a deeper
phylogenetic level [10].
Upon invasion by P. falciparum, erythrocytes are subjected to an extensive remodeling process resulting in
altered mechanical and adhesive properties [11].

Prominent examples include the formation of cytoadherence knobs at the erythrocyte membrane and the associated exposure of PfEMP1 (P. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein) at the surface of the infected cell
[12]. Plasmodium proteins involved in this remodeling
process have to pass the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) on their way from the parasite into the
erythrocyte; most of these proteins are characterized by
a hydrophobic signal sequence for targeting the protein
to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a sequence motif
(RxLxE/Q/D) either referred to as Plasmodium export
element (PEXEL; [13]) or vacuolar transport signal [14].
The PEXEL motif is cleaved by the aspartyl protease
plasmepsin V in the ER of the parasite [15-17] and the
nascent protein is released into the parasitophorous
vacuole. From there it is transported through the PVM
into the host cell by the Plasmodium translocon of
exported proteins (PTEX; [18]). Predictions based on
the presence of the PEXEL suggest that more than 300
P. falciparum proteins are exported into the host cell
[13,14,19,20]. Notably, PfEMP1s are structurally different, having an export element that precedes the signal
sequence (R/KxL/V/MxE/D; cf. [13]). This export element appears to be necessary for export [13] but is not
cleaved in vivo, and therefore might be functionally distinct [21].
The conservation of plasmepsin V and the components of PTEX throughout the genus Plasmodium indicates that the same protein export machinery is used by
all Plasmodium species [16-18]. In addition, PEXEL
sequences from P. falciparum proteins proved to be
functional in rodent malaria parasites [13] and vice
versa [22]. Thus, in principle, the screens to detect
exported proteins in P. falciparum should be extendable
to other Plasmodium species. However, surprisingly few
proteins have been detected outside of the Laverania
using the P. falciparum PEXEL motif, and it has been
suggested that these species export substantially fewer
proteins into the host cell than P. falciparum [13,14,19].
Non-Laverania, however, also induce elaborate morphological changes in their host cells and the low number of predicted exported proteins may argue for a
prominent role of PEXEL-negative exported proteins
(PNEPs; reviewed in [23]). An additional, thus far unexplored, explanation could be a slightly different consensus of the PEXEL motif in Plasmodium taxa other than
Laverania that could hamper the prediction of these
proteins. This would inevitably lead to an underestimation of the respective exportomes.
Here, we took advantage of the available genomic
sequences from eight Plasmodium species and four
other apicomplexan species. Orthologous proteins were
identified and used (i) to reconstruct the phylogeny of
these species, (ii) to obtain a set of exported P.

falciparum proteins that are conserved throughout Plasmodium evolution, and (iii) to investigate the evolutionary plasticity of the corresponding Plasmodium export
elements.

Methods
Source of sequence data

The genomic sequences of P. falciparum 3D7 [24], P.
yoelii 17XNL [25], P. berghei Anka [26], P. chabaudi AS
[26], P. knowlesi H [27], P. vivax Sal-1 [28], as well as P.
reichenowi and P. gallinaceum (both unpublished data
produced by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute; used
with permission) were obtained from PlasmoDB v. 6.1
[29]; sequences of Toxoplasma gondii ME49 were
obtained from ToxoDB v. 5.2 [30], sequences of Babesia
bovis T2Bo from Integr8 [31], sequences of Cryptosporidium parvum Iowa from CryptoDB [32]; sequences of
Theileria annulata Ankara [33] were downloaded from
the Sanger Institute http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/
downloads/protozoa/.
Collection of orthologs

The dataset of orthologous proteins for phylogeny
reconstructions was compiled as described before [34].
In brief, InParanoid-TC was used with P. falciparum, P.
vivax, P. knowlesi, P. yoelii, P. berghei, P. chabaudi, T.
gondii, and B. bovis as primer taxa. For 921 proteins
orthologs were present in all eight primer taxa. These
921 core orthologs served then as input for HaMStR to
search for the corresponding proteins in P. reichenowi,
P. gallinaceum, C. parvum, and T. annulata. Following
search species - reference species pairs were used in the
HaMStR search: P. reichenowi - P. falciparum, P. gallinaceum - P. falciparum, C. parvum - T. gondii, and T.
annulata - B. bovis. HaMStR could extend 218 core
orthologs with sequences from all four species such that
each ortholog group consisted of twelve sequences. The
amino acid sequences for each of the 218 core orthologs
were aligned with MAFFT [35] using the options –maxiterate 1000 and –localpair. The 218 single alignments
were concatenated to form a super-alignment with
192,102 aa positions. This super-alignment was processed twice: (i) positions for which less than half of the
sequences were represented by an amino acid were
removed, and (ii) Gblocks 0.91b [36] was applied using
the following parameters: –minimum number of
sequences for a conserved position was set to 7; –minimum number of sequences for a flanking position was set
to 10; –maximum number of contiguous nonconserved
positions was set to 4; –minimum length of a block was
set to 10; and –allowed gap positions was set to none.
To obtain the collection of exported proteins that
have functionally equivalent orthologs in the other Plasmodium species, the two most comprehensive

Pick et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:167
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/167

predictions of exported P. falciparum proteins were
used [19,20]. These predictions contain 396 and 422
proteins (not including the structurally distinct
PfEMP1s), respectively; the combination of both resulted
in a non-redundant set of 531 putatively exported proteins. Each protein was used as query for a tBLASTn
search against the P. falciparum genome. Proteins, for
which the E value of the best BLAST hit (not considering the hit against itself) was larger than 10 -10 , were
considered to have no paralogs present in P. falciparum
and were used for further analysis. For each paralog-free
protein a reciprocal tBLASTn search was performed to
identify candidate orthologs in the other Plasmodium
species (E value cut-off: < 10-10). Proteins with a single
ortholog present in each of the eight Plasmodium species were aligned with MAFFT [35] using the options
–maxiterate 1000 and –localpair.
Phylogeny reconstruction

Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were reconstructed
with RAxML v. 7.2.2 [37] using the WAG model [38] of
amino acid sequence evolution with empirical amino
acid frequencies (option F). Substitution rate heterogeneity was modeled using a gamma distribution, allowing
for a fraction of invariant sites (option GAMMAI). Bayesian tree search was performed with PhyloBayes v. 3.2
[39] using the WAG model. Four MCMC chains were
run for 10,000 cycles. Every 10th cycle was sampled and
convergence of the chains was pair-wise checked with
bpcomp allowing for a burn-in of 1,000 cycles. Increasing the burn-in or usage of other models of amino acid
sequence evolution such as the CAT [40] or LG model
[41] did not change the results (not shown).
Testing of alternative phylogenies

The small number of taxa in our study allows the evaluation of every possible tree topology. However, we
reduced the number of tested trees by imposing the following constraints: monophyly of the genus Plasmodium; monophyly of B. bovis and T. annulata
(Piroplasmida); monophyly of T. gondii and C. parvum
(Eimeriorina); monophyly of P. yoelii and P. berghei;
monophyly of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi; monophyly of P. vivax and P. knowlesi. Note that all seven
constraints represent accepted evolutionary relationships
(see references in Table 1) except the monophyly of T.
gondii and C. parvum [42], and have been confirmed by
our unrestricted heuristic tree searches. We computed
the likelihood of the resulting 105 alternative tree topologies with TREE-PUZZLE v. 5.2.pl21.1 [43] using the
WAG model of sequence evolution. Substitution rate
heterogeneity was modeled with a gamma distribution
assuming four rate categories and empirical amino acid
frequencies. Hypothesis testing was performed using the

Page 3 of 12

routines provided by TREE-PUZZLE and by CONSEL
[44].
Sequence analysis

Pairwise amino acid identities and similarities were calculated with GeneDoc v. 2.6 [45] using the Blosum 62
model. PEXEL sequences of the P. falciparum proteins
were identified via a match to the published consensus
sequences [13,14,19,20]. The putative PEXEL sequences
of proteins from other Plasmodium species were
extracted by aligning these proteins to their ortholog in
P. falciparum; we then used the homologous amino acid
positions to the P. falciparum PEXEL as candidate
export elements in these species. PEXEL sequences from
the individual proteins were aligned separately for each
species by hand and the corresponding PEXEL motifs
were generated with WebLogo [46]. Presence of hydrophobic signal sequences was assessed using SignalP v.
3.0 [47].

Results and Discussion
Evolutionary ancestry of P. falciparum and other
Laverania

We extracted the genomic sequences of eight Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P. reichenowi, P. vivax, P.
knowlesi, P. gallinaceum, P. chabaudi, P. yoelii, and P.
berghei) and four additional apicomplexan species (T.
gondii, C. parvum, T. annulata, and B. bovis) from public databases. HaMStR, a Hidden Markov Model based
tool [34], was used to identify 218 proteins with orthologs in all twelve species (Additional file 1). This number is similar to that used in a recent phylogenomic
study of eight apicomplexan species, including two species from the genus Plasmodium [48].
The single alignments of the 218 proteins were concatenated and positions for which less than half of the
taxa were represented by an amino acid were removed.
This resulted in a super-alignment with 135,360 aa positions (Additional file 2), which was used for initial maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian tree reconstructions.
While tree topologies inferred from the ML analysis
were identical with those obtained in later analyses (see
below; Figure 1), MCMC chains did not converge on a
single topology, indicating that the dataset includes conflicting phylogenetic information. Therefore, the 135,360
aa alignment was further processed using Gblocks [36].
This procedure has been demonstrated to improve phylogenetic analyses by reducing the impact of misaligned
regions (due to very high sequence divergence) and
homoplasy (due to sequence saturation) [49]. We
obtained a final alignment comprising 49,521 aa positions and no missing data (Additional file 3). In Bayesian
analysis, MCMC chains readily converged on the same
topology (maxdiff: 0; meandiff: 0). In the resulting

consensus tree all nodes received strong support and the
same topology was obtained in ML analyses (Figure 1).
The phylogenetic analyses show that the eight Plasmodium species form a monophyletic clade (100% bootstrap support and 1.00 Bayesian posterior probabilities).
The malaria parasites from rodents (P. chabaudi, P. yoelii, and P. berghei) are clearly separated from those
infecting birds and primates (100% bootstrap support
and 1.00 Bayesian posterior probabilities). Notably, the
Laverania (P. falciparum and P. reichenowi) do not
group with the other primate-infecting malaria parasites,
but form a well-supported clade with P. gallinaceum

(99% bootstrap support and 1.00 Bayesian posterior
probabilities).
ML as well as Bayesian methods return only the best
tree and thus provide no information on other tree
topologies with likelihoods that may not be significantly
worse. To address this issue, 104 alternative tree topologies were tested by inferring their expected likelihood
weights (ELW; [50]) and their probabilities in the
approximately unbiased (AU) test [51]. All alternative
tree topologies (including those with P. gallinaceum
being the sister group of mammal Plasmodium species)
were rejected with high confidence (Figure 2; Additional

Phylogenetic tree reconstructions were based on 218 proteins. The
single alignments were concatenated to form a super-alignment
and problematic alignment regions were subsequently removed
with Gblocks. This procedure resulted in an alignment with 49,521
aa positions (no missing data), which was used for ML tree
reconstruction and Bayesian tree search. T. gondii, C. parvum, T.

file 4). Thus, the position of P. gallinaceum as sister
group to the Laverania receives unambiguous support
from the data.
Until now, two other whole-genome approaches
attempted to resolve the evolutionary relationships of
the eight Plasmodium species. Dávalos and Perkins [52]
based their analyses on a set of 104 proteins (~26,000 aa
positions), recovering the same topology among Plasmodium species as displayed in Figure 1. However, no outgroup taxa were included to root the tree, and thus no
information on the evolutionary ancestry of the Laverania could be provided. Silva et al. [53], on the other
hand, based their analyses on a set of 29 proteins
(~12,000 aa positions) and used two species from the
genus Theileria to root the tree. While they proposed
the monophyly of mammalian Plasmodium species,
some of their results supported a grouping of P. gallinaceum and the Laverania.
Dávalos and Perkins [52] as well as Silva et al. [53]
both used slow-evolving proteins for their phylogenetic
inferences. To assess the effect of the evolutionary rate
on our analysis, we partitioned the 218 proteins of our
dataset. We first computed a ML tree for each protein
individually. The length of this protein tree, i.e. the sum
of its branch lengths, then served as an approximation
for the evolutionary rate (Figure 3; see also Additional
file 5). Subsequently, the proteins were categorized into
three subsets according to their tree lengths. Dataset 1

phylogenetic inferences. The length of the individual protein
trees, i.e. the sum of its branch lengths, served as an approximation
for the evolutionary rate. Note that only the proteins of primer taxa
(P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, P. yoelii, P. berghei, P. chabaudi, T.
gondii, and B. bovis) were considered. See also Additional file 5.

Pick et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:167

comprised 65 slow-evolving proteins (tree lengths of less
than two expected substitutions per site). Dataset 2
comprised 88 proteins evolving at an intermediate speed
(tree lengths of two or more but less than four expected
substitutions per site). Dataset 3 comprised the 66 fastevolving proteins (tree length of four or more expected
substitutions per site). For subsequent tree reconstruction, 65 proteins were randomly chosen from each partition such that the same number of proteins was used
for each dataset. The individual alignments were concatenated, processed with Gblocks as described and used
for ML tree reconstruction (Figure 4). All three datasets
agree in placing P. gallinaceum as sister of the Laverania. The topology of the tree was thus identical with
that inferred from the complete dataset (Figure 1). We
conclude that our reconstruction of the Plasmodium
phylogeny does not depend on the evolutionary rates of
the proteins used for the phylogeny.
The bootstrap support for the clade consisting of P.
gallinaceum and Laverania was maximal for the dataset
comprising proteins evolving at an intermediate speed
(98%) and minimal for the dataset comprising the fastevolving proteins (76%). The branch leading to the clade
consisting of P. gallinaceum and Laverania was short
(~0.02 expected substitutions per site; cf. Figure 4).
When using fast-evolving proteins, multiple substitutions in the dataset might confound the phylogenetic
signal leading to artifacts due to long branch attraction
[54]. On the other hand, using only slow-evolving proteins is likely to result in a dataset with a phylogenetic
signal that is too weak to resolve this branch (see also
Additional file 6). This may explain why proteins evolving with an intermediate rate provide the most robust
tree.
The finding of a relationship between the Laverania
and avian malaria parasites agrees with earlier studies by
Waters et al. [55], Escalante and Ayala [56], and Kissinger et al. [57]. However, it contradicts more recent
results by Perkins and Schall [58], Leclerc et al. [59],
Roy and Irimia [60] and Martinsen et al. [61]. This discrepancy may be attributed to the limited phylogenetic
information in the few proteins that were used in those
studies [10]. While the selection of proteins may have
some effect (see above), the number and choice of the
outgroup taxa deserve particular attention (e.g., [62]).
Alternative root placements lead to different conclusions
about the order in which the individual Plasmodium
species emerged (c.f. Figure 2). In many previous studies, only a single outgroup taxon was used (Table 1).
Moreover, in some cases this outgroup was evolutionarily so distantly related that a meaningful placement of
the root is unlikely (e.g., [63]). Most recent studies of
Plasmodium phylogeny used selected species from the
closely related genus Leucocytozoon as an outgroup (c.f.

subsets of proteins with varying evolutionary rates. The
proteins used for the initial phylogenetic inference were categorized

bars are equal to 0.05 expected substitutions per site.

Table 1). However, the limited amount of sequence data
available for this taxon - mainly a few mitochondrial
genes - currently prevents its use in phylogenomic studies. Other haemosporidians (i.e., species from the genera Haemoproteus, Parahaemoproteus, and Hepatocystis)
should not be considered as an outgroup since the
genus Plasmodium has been shown to be paraphyletic
with respect to these taxa (e.g., [61]). Alternative

strategies for a reliable root placement employ the inclusion of multiple outgroup taxa to break the branch
separating the ingroup from the outgroup, and the use
of a comprehensive set of proteins [64]. Our trees
include four apicomplexan species as an outgroup and
are based on 218 orthologous proteins. We have
obtained identical tree topologies by employing different
tree reconstruction methods (ML and Bayesian inference)
and different models of sequence evolution. Moreover,
our findings remain unchanged when we use proteins
with different evolutionary rates. Ultimately, likelihood
ratio tests rejected all alternative tree topologies. Thus,
we are confident that our root placement is robust and
that P. gallinaceum and the Laverania indeed share a
common ancestry.
An avian parasite as sister to the Laverania has significant implications: it suggests that a host switch from
birds to African great apes or vice versa has occurred.
Host switches have repeatedly taken place during the
evolution of avian Plasmodium species [61]. Moreover,
avian Plasmodium species are able to infect mammals
under experimental conditions [65]. Both observations
are congruent with an evolutionary scenario in which
the laveranian lineage was established by a single Plasmodium species switching from birds to African great
apes. Subsequent diversification of Laverania associated
with multiple host switches within the apes eventually
led to the emergence of P. falciparum in humans [5-9].
Note that this scenario also implies that the great diversity of malaria parasites infecting birds [61] may in fact
derive from an early host switch by another mammalian
Plasmodium species. At present, however, we cannot
exclude the alternative scenario in which the avian Plasmodium lineage was established by a Plasmodium species from the laveranian lineage. Therefore,
phylogenomic analyses considering additional Plasmodium species (and in particular those infecting birds and
squamate reptiles) will be necessary to provide a more
detailed picture of how the Laverania emerged.
Evolutionary plasticity of the Plasmodium export element

The availability of Plasmodium genome sequences
together with the reliable reconstruction of their phylogenetic relationships provides a robust framework to
investigate the evolutionary history of exported P. falciparum proteins. Here, we used 531 P. falciparum proteins that had been predicted to be exported into the
host cell [19,20] to identify functionally equivalent
orthologs in the other Plasmodium species. BLAST
searches in the P. falciparum genome identified 102
proteins without any recognizable paralog (Additional
file 7), whereas the other 429 proteins mainly belong to
large gene families such as RIFINs (repetitive interspersed family) and STEVORs (subtelomeric variable

open reading frames). These gene families have a complex evolutionary history and have undergone independent lineage-specific diversifications [19]. This indicates
that even if homologs of these proteins exist in the
other Plasmodium species, they do not necessarily share
the same function. These proteins were therefore
excluded from further analyses.
Subsequent BLAST searches for homologs of the 102
paralog-free proteins in the other Plasmodium species
identified 33 proteins with a homolog present in each of
the species (Table 2). Orthology between the members
in the 33 groups of proteins was confirmed by inferring
the corresponding sequence trees with a Bayesian
approach as described in the Methods section (Figure 5;
Additional file 7). Whereas in 27 cases this tree was
congruent to the species tree, six sequence trees differed
from the species tree in the position of the P. gallinaceum sequences. However, subsequent likelihood ratio
tests revealed that superimposing the species tree did
not lead to significantly worse likelihoods (Additional
file 8). The pairwise similarities between the P. falciparum proteins and their orthologs in the other Plasmodium species are given in Table 2. The orthologs from
P. reichenowi display the highest degree of similarity.
This finding is expected given the sister group relationship of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi. Among the
remaining six non-laveranian taxa the orthologs from P.
gallinaceum are overall most similar to the P. falciparum proteins. This lends further support to our conclusion that the Laverania and P. gallinaceum share a
common ancestry.
Both reciprocal best BLAST hit searches and phylogenetic tree reconstructions indicate that the proteins in
the 33 groups are encoded by genes that remained single copy throughout evolution (one-to-one orthologs).
Ample evidence exists that such one-to-one orthologs
are functionally equivalent [66]. Therefore, we conclude
that if the P. falciparum protein is exported, its orthologs in other Plasmodium species are exported as well
and hence, that these proteins are suitable to assess the
evolutionary plasticity of the PEXEL motif. Note that
five of these 33 proteins have already been confirmed to
be exported in P. falciparum using GFP-constructs
([20]; Table 2). However, five proteins appear not to be
exported ([19,20]; Table 2); thus they were omitted from
further analyses.
The amino acid alignments of the remaining 28 ortholog groups were used to identify the regions that correspond to the P. falciparum PEXEL in the sequences
from the other species. Subsequently, the candidate
PEXEL sequences from all proteins were extracted and
aligned separately for each species (Additional file 8).
From these alignments the individual PEXEL motifs
were determined and compared to those of P.

falciparum (Figure 6). The motifs were found to be largely similar across the different Plasmodium species.
However, several deviations from the functionally
important amino acids were observed; the amino acids
at position 1 and 3 are crucial for an efficient cleavage
by plasmepsin V, while the amino acid at position 5
affects the export rate of the nascent protein [67].
The most prominent difference between the Plasmodium species was found for the positively charged
amino acid at position 1 of the PEXEL motif. All 28 P.
falciparum proteins harbor an arginine (R), whereas
about 20% of the proteins from non-Laverania have a

lysine (K) at this position. Three lines of evidence indicate that this alternate PEXEL is nevertheless functional:
(i) lysine at position 1 of the PEXEL was found in orthologs of those P. falciparum proteins whose export into
the host cell has been confirmed (Figure 5), and thus
our observation is not restricted to proteins that might
have been erroneously predicted as being exported; (ii)
recent experimental evidence suggests that the typical
cleavage at the leucine (L) at position 3 can occur in
proteins containing lysine at position 1 (PFI1780w and
MAL3P8.15; [70]); and (iii) a small number of proteins
with a lysine at position 1 of the PEXEL have already

been predicted to be exported using a Hidden Markov
Model based prediction method (21 in P. falciparum,
three or less in each of the other Plasmodium species;
cf. [19]). Other deviations at position 1 that are less prominent include the presence of histidine (H) in the P.
knowlesi and P. vivax orthologs of PFC0435w and of
glutamine (Q) in the P. gallinaceum protein that is
orthologous to PFA0210c (Figure 5). Both PFC0435w
and PFA0210c belong to the confirmed set of exported
proteins in P. falciparum [20] and therefore these
PEXEL sequences are likely to be functional as well.
Position 3, which almost invariably harbors a hydrophobic leucine (L), was also found almost invariable in the
orthologs of the confirmed exported P. falciparum proteins. However, several orthologs of P. falciparum proteins that have not yet been confirmed to be exported
have an isoleucine (I) at this position (Figure 6). Position
5, which is considered to be the least conserved position
[13,14], was found to be even more variable in the
group of confirmed exported P. falciparum proteins.

Even though it remains to be demonstrated that these
orthologous proteins are cleaved and exported with the
same efficiency, these observations suggest that the
PEXEL motif is more variable than previously acknowledged. This provides a possible explanation for the
small number of exported proteins predicted for some

Plasmodium species. Taking this plasticity into account
will be essential to arrive at a more comprehensive set
of exported proteins for all Plasmodium species.

Conclusion
Our phylogenetic analyses of orthologs deduced from
the Plasmodium genomes strongly suggests that the subgenus Laverania was established by a single host switch
from birds to African great apes (or vice versa). However,
sequences from additional bird-infecting Plasmodium species and the closely related Haemosporida are required to
better understand the early evolution of the Laverania.
Exported proteins, as identified by the PEXEL motif, play
a major role in Plasmodium virulence and facilitate the
parasite’s survival in the host cell. Our results suggest that
the number of exported proteins is higher in the nonlaveranian Plasmodium species than previously assumed.
Comprehensive knowledge of their diversity and evolution
will help to unravel the emergence of the high pathogenicity of P. falciparum, and may allow the identification of
novel targets for malaria therapy.
