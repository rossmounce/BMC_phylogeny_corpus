Background

Ancient symbioses are responsible for some of the major
eukaryotic innovations. It is widely accepted that mitochon-

dria and plastids are derived respectively from an α-proteobacterial and a cyanobacterial endosymbiont in early
eukaryotes [1]. It also has been suggested that the nucleus, a

Conclusion: Our findings provide a glimpse into the complex interactions that were necessary to
establish the primary endosymbiotic relationship between plastid and host cytoplasms, and thereby
explain the rarity with which long-term successful endosymbiotic relationships between
heterotrophs and photoautotrophs were established. Our data also provide strong and
independent support for a common origin of all primary photosynthetic eukaryotes and of the
plastids they harbor.

interactions

Results: We conducted phylogenomic analyses of the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae to identify
genes specifically related to chlamydial homologs. We show that at least 21 genes were transferred
between chlamydiae and primary photosynthetic eukaryotes, with the donor most similar to the
environmental Protochlamydia. Such an unusually high number of transferred genes suggests an
ancient chlamydial endosymbiosis with the ancestral primary photosynthetic eukaryote. We
hypothesize that three organisms were involved in establishing the primary photosynthetic lineage:
the eukaryotic host cell, the cyanobacterial endosymbiont that provided photosynthetic capability,
and a chlamydial endosymbiont or parasite that facilitated the establishment of the cyanobacterial
endosymbiont.

Background: Ancient endosymbioses are responsible for the origins of mitochondria and plastids,
and they contribute to the divergence of several major eukaryotic groups. Although chlamydiae, a
group of obligate intracellular bacteria, are not found in plants, an unexpected number of chlamydial
genes are most similar to plant homologs, which, interestingly, often contain a plastid-targeting
signal. This observation has prompted several hypotheses, including gene transfer between
chlamydiae and plant-related groups and an ancestral relationship between chlamydiae and
cyanobacteria.

hallmark of eukaryotic cells, either arose directly from or was
mediated by an ancient symbiosis between archaeal and bacterial partners [2-7]. Additionally, secondary and tertiary
symbioses through engulfment of a plastid-containing cell
played an important role in the evolution of several major
eukaryotic lineages, including heterokonts, apicomplexans,
dinoflagellates, euglenids, and others [8-12]. Undoubtedly,
the evolution of extant eukaryotes was significantly shaped by
past symbioses.
Chlamydiae are a group of obligate intracellular bacteria of
uncertain evolutionary position [13-15]. Many chlamydiae,
including Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis, are important pathogens in humans and other animals [16] whereas others such as Protochlamydia,
Neochlamydia, and Fritschea are endosymbionts in environmental amoebae and insects [17,18]. Although the available
evidence suggests increasing chlamydial diversity in free-living amoebae and in the environment [19], thus far no chlamydial species has been reported in photosynthetic eukaryotes
or plastid-containing lineages. However, chlamydial genome
analyses revealed an unexpected number of genes that are
most similar to plant homologs [20,21], which, interestingly,
often contain a plastid-targeting signal [13]. This observation
has prompted several hypotheses, notably an ancestral evolutionary relationship between cyanobacteria (plastids) and
chlamydiae [13] and gene transfer between the two groups
with the donor being either chlamydiae [22,23] or plantrelated groups [21,24,25]. Additionally, it has also been suggested that plants might have acquired these genes from
mitochondria [26] or through intermediate vectors such as
insects [17].
Reconstructing possible evolutionary scenarios that explain
the chlamydial and plant sequence similarity requires an
understanding of the taxonomic distribution and the origin of
all involved genes. However, available phylogenetic data from
chlamydial genome analyses often suffer from small taxonomic sample size [20,21]. Most other relevant studies are
heavily biased toward the gene encoding ATP/ADP translocase, which has an uncertain evolutionary origin and a narrow distribution, mainly in obligate intracellular bacteria
(chlamydiae and rickettsiae) and photosynthetic eukaryotes
[22,25-28]. The evolutionary history of a single gene, even if
correctly interpreted, might not reflect those of others. If a
single evolutionary event underlies the current observation of
chlamydial and plant sequence similarity, then a compatible
evolutionary history of multiple genes should provide more
convincing evidence.
Given the common belief that all primary photosynthetic
eukaryotes, including glaucophytes, red algae, and green
plants, share a common ancestry [11,29,30], we undertook a
phylogenomic analysis of Cyanidioschyzon merolae (the only
red alga whose complete genome sequence is currently available) to search for genes that are evolutionarily related to

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R99

chlamydial homologs. Our data suggest a likely ancient symbiosis (sensu deBary; including mutualism, commensalisms,
and parasitism) [31] between a chlamydial endosymbiont and
the ancestor of primary photosynthetic eukaryotes. The
ancient chlamydial endosymbiont contributed genes to the
nuclear genome of primary photosynthetic eukaryotes and
might have facilitated the early establishment of plastids.

Results and discussion
Chlamydiae-like genes in primary photosynthetic
eukaryotes: direction of gene transfer
The nuclear genome of Cyanidioschyzon contains 4,771 predicted protein-coding genes [32]. Phylogenomic screen and
subsequent phylogenetic analyses identified 16 probable
chlamydiae-related genes in Cyanidioschyzon, 14 of which
were also found in green plants. Five other previously
reported genes [13,23] from green plants were also classified
as chlamydiae-related after careful re-analyses. The genome
sequences of glaucophytes are currently not publicly available, but the gene encoding ATP/ADP translocase is reportedly
present in the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa and the
diatom Odontella sinensis [25]. In our search of the Taxonomically Broad EST Database (TBestDB) [33], ATP/ADP
translocase homologs were also found in another glaucophyte
(Glaucocystis nostochinearum), euglenids (Astasia longa
and Euglena gracilis), and a haptophyte (Pavlova lutheri).
This suggests that chlamydiae-related genes are present in all
primary photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages and that the
ADP/ATP translocase has been retained in at least some secondary photosynthetic groups (eukaryotic lineages that
emerged by engulfing another algal cell as endosymbiont).
Therefore, a total of 21 genes from primary photosynthetic
eukaryotes are listed here as chlamydiae-related (Table 1).
Sequences that are not exclusively related to chlamydial
homologs and those that form a monophyletic group with
chlamydial homologs but with insufficient bootstrap support
(<80%) are not included. These very stringent criteria
excluded a large portion (18/37) of previously reported
chlamydiae-related plant sequences [13,23].
The chlamydiae-like genes identified in this study does not
constitute an accurate list of all chlamydiae-related genes in
primary photosynthetic eukaryotes, but rather is an estimate
from our phylogenomic analyses. This number is probably an
underestimate, because the evolutionary origin of many
genes is difficult to ascertain using available phylogenetic
algorithms, and because some other chlamydiae-like genes
may exist in glaucophytes and other red algae but are not
retained in the smaller genome of Cyanidioschyzon. With the
exception of the genes encoding sugar-phosphate isomerase
and a hypothetical protein, the protein sequences of all other
genes listed in Table 1 contain a plastid-targeting signal as
predicted by ChloroP [34] or TargetP [35], or experimentally
determined to be plastid localized; this is consistent with the
previous report that chlamydiae-related gene products tend

information

The bacterial nature of chlamydiae-like genes in primary photosynthetic eukaryotes suggests that they were transferred
either from chlamydiae to these eukaryotes or from plastids
to chlamydiae. The latter scenario (plastid-to-chlamydiae
transfer) implies a plastidic (cyanobacterial) origin for the
transferred genes listed (Table 1). For many of the genes, this
scenario can be rejected because it does not account for the
specific relationship of the chlamydiae-like genes in primary
photosynthetic eukaryotes to the Protochlamydia homologs
(Figure 1a-d, Figure 2a, and Additional data file 1), and
because it is incompatible with the cyanobacterial homologs
forming a well supported group that is distinct from the
chlamydial homologs (Figures 1 and 2, and Additional data
file 1). After all, plastids evolved from a cyanobacterial ancestor, and therefore any gene acquired by chlamydiae from
plastids should also be more closely related to cyanobacterial
than to other bacterial sequences. Additionally, five of the

interactions

The chlamydial and plant sequence similarities were previously suggested to be an indication of gene transfer from
plants or plant-related groups to chlamydiae [21,24,25,28].
However, the genes listed in Table 1 are predominantly distributed in bacteria, indicating a likely bacterial origin (Figures 1 and 2, and Additional data file 1). In all cases,
sequences from primary photosynthetic eukaryotes and
sometimes from other plastid-containing lineages form a well
supported monophyletic group with chlamydial homologs. In
most cases they are more closely related to homologs of Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25 (a chlamydial
species that is found in free-living acanthamoebae and environmental samples and was previously classified as a member
of Parachlamydia or Parachlamydia-related [36]) than to
chlamydial sequences as a whole (Figures 1 and 2, and Additional data file 1). However, the sequence relationships
among primary photosynthetic eukaryotes vary slightly and
differ from the expected organismal relationship, mostly

because of insufficient phylogenetic signal as evidenced by
low internal bootstrap support, and sometimes because of
possible differential gene losses or other evolutionary scenarios (for instance, see Figure 2). These chlamydial and primary
photosynthetic eukaryotic sequences also do not appear to be
particularly related to homologs from other eukaryotes (Figures 1 and 2, and Additional data file 1).

although containing a weak plastid-targeting signal (score
0.504 and 0.610 from ChloroP and TargetP, respectively), is
believed to be associated with the endomembrane of plant
cells [23].

Although the chlamydiae-cyanobacteria hypothesis offers a
popular explanation for the sequence similarity between
chlamydiae and plants [20,22,27], it has not been rigorously
tested. The major shortcoming of this hypothesis is that all
plastids certainly are derived from a past cyanobacterial
rather than a chlamydial endosymbiont. Even if chlamydiae
and cyanobacteria indeed shared a common ancestry, any
sequences of plastidic origin should be more closely related to

In all studies of gene transfer, there are always alternative
explanations for each individual gene tree (for example, see
the discussion of Figure 2 in section "Further evidence for an
ancient chlamydial endosymbiosis with primary photosynthetic eukaryotes") [40]. Overall, however, the pattern from
our phylogenetic analyses does not support the hypothesis
that cyanobacteria (plastids) and chlamydiae share a close
ancestral relationship. This consistent phylogenetic signal
from multiple genes should not be dismissed lightly as artifacts of phylogenetic reconstruction, but rather suggests a
clear evolutionary link between chlamydiae and primary
photosynthetic eukaryotes. Furthermore, given their often
specific affinity with environmental Protochlamydia
homologs (Figures 1 and 2, and Additional data file 1), if all of
these primary photosynthetic eukaryotic sequences were

deposited research

The relationship between chlamydiae and other bacterial
groups remains largely unresolved. Phylogenetic analyses of
16S rRNA suggested that chlamydiae form a sister group with
either planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia [14,15,20,37] or
cyanobacteria [13,38], without significant support. An ancestral relationship between chlamydiae and cyanobacteria was
hypothesized by Brinkman and coworkers [13], largely based
on the possession of a predicted plastid-targeting signal in
chlamydiae-like plant sequences. Those authors explicitly
excluded the possibility of horizontal gene transfer between
chlamydiae and their hosts, and assumed that these plant
plastid-targeted sequences were of cyanobacterial origin.
According to Brinkman and coworkers, these plant sequences
are similar to chlamydial homologs because chlamydiae and
cyanobacteria (plastids) are evolutionarily related. A few
additional characters uniquely shared by cyanobacteria and
chlamydiae were identified in the usually structurally conserved ribosomal superoperon [13], including the absence of
S10 and S14 genes, which are present in different chromosomal locations in chlamydiae and cyanobacteria. However, a
more detailed phylogenetic and comparative study of S14 suggested that this gene was probably independently transferred
from α-proteobacteria to cyanobacteria, chlamydiae, and
actinomycetes [39]. Therefore, the absence of S14 from the
cyanobacterial and chlamydial ribosomal superoperons
might be due to relaxed selection to maintain redundant
homologs in the genome, rather than an indication of evolutionary relatedness between the two groups.

All red algal and green plant genes listed in Table 1 clearly are
more closely related to chlamydial than to cyanobacterial
homologs, with the exception of the genes encoding 4hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase (gcpE)
and enoyl-ACP reductase (fabI), which include distinct gene
copies in red algae, glaucophytes, and other plastid-containing eukaryotes (Figure 2 and Additional data file 1). Some of
the identified chlamydiae-like genes (for instance, that
encoding polyribonucleotide phosphorylase) also contain a
number of conserved amino acid residues uniquely shared by
chlamydiae, red algae, and green plants. In our molecular
phylogenetic analyses of 12 of the genes that contain both
cyanobacterial and chlamydial homologs, the cyanobacterial
sequences form a clade that is clearly distinct from the
chlamydial homologs (Figures 1 and 2, and Additional data
file 1). Added to this observation is the fact that several
chlamydiae-like genes are not found in cyanobacteria and
that the gene encoding glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase
has identifiable homologs (using Arabidopsis [GenBank:
NP_849738] and Protochlamydia [GenBank: CAF24042]
sequences as queries) only in chlamydiae, red algae, green
plants, and the apicomplexan Plasmodium, which also contains a nonphotosynthetic plastid. The closer relationship
between certain chlamydial and plant sequences was also
observed in independent studies [20].

cyanobacterial than to chlamydial homologs, unless these
sequences diverged so rapidly as to generate long-branch
attraction artifacts or lateral gene transfer was involved.
Based on this reasoning, we have paid particular attention to
the relationships among homologous sequences from
chlamydiae, cyanobacteria, and primary photosynthetic
eukaryotes in our analyses.

reviews

chlamydiae-like genes in photosynthetic eukaryotes lack
identifiable cyanobacterial homologs. (The genes encoding
ATP/ADP translocase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase,
oligoendopeptidase F, sodium-hydrogen antiporter, and the
malate dehydrogenase chloroplast precursors in green plants
lack significant hits to cyanobacterial sequences in GenBank
searches.) This suggests that the majority of the genes listed
in Table 1 were probably transferred from chlamydiae to primary photosynthetic eukaryotes.

indeed of plastidic origin (even though they do not group with
cyanobacterial homologs), then this would make chlamydiae
a paraphyletic group. Such an observation contradicts the
common belief that chlamydiae are monophyletic [14,15] and
weighs further against the hypothesis that chlamydiae and
cyanobacteria are sister taxa.

Conceivably, if horizontal gene transfer occurred from
chlamydiae to the earlier cyanobacterial progenitor of
plastids, then chlamydial genes could end up in the nuclear
genomes of photosynthetic eukaryotes following subsequent
intracellular transfer from plastids to the nucleus. Given the
number of chlamydiae-like genes detected in our analyses
and the fact that most of the original plastidic (cyanobacterial) genes were lost in modern photosynthetic eukaryotes
[41], this scenario entails massive gene transfers from ancient
chlamydiae to the cyanobacterial progenitor of plastids.
Although gene transfer indeed occurs frequently in prokaryotes [42-44], thus far no chlamydiae-like genes have been
reported in any extant cyanobacterium to suggest such massive transfer events.
Because chlamydiae are found in insects, it has also been suggested that plants might have acquired chlamydial genes
through insect feeding activities [17]. However, the presence
of chlamydiae-like genes in red algae and glaucophytes,
which are not a favorable food source for insects, makes this
scenario less likely. Furthermore, red algae, glaucophytes,
and green plants represent one of the major deep lineages of
eukaryotes [45,46]. Such an insect-to-plant transfer scenario
would also push the emergence of insects to before the split of
primary photosynthetic eukaryotes, which contradicts all
available molecular and fossil evidence [47,48].

(b) sequences from green plants, diatoms, chlorarachniophytes, and
apicomplexans form a strongly supported group, whereas cyanobacterial
and red alga Cyanidioschyzon homologs form another group. Colors
represent different phylogenetic affiliations.

An unexpectedly high number of chlamydial genes that are
most similar to plant homologs has been reported in several
independent studies [13,20,21]. For example, most eukaryote-related sequences of Chlamydia trachomatis tend to
group with plant homologs in phylogenetic analyses [21]. In a
similarity-based genome survey, sequences of rickettsia,
cyanobacteria, and chlamydiae represented only 14% of the
analyzed genes, but they accounted for 65% of bacterial genes
that were most similar to eukaryotic homologs; these cyanobacterial and chlamydial sequences disproportionately correspond to plant proteins [13]. Although our focus is to
elucidate the cause of chlamydial and plant sequence similarity rather than to reiterate the previous conclusion, our analyses yielded similar findings. For all likely transferred genes
in Cyanidioschyzon whose origins can be reliably inferred,
chlamydiae-like genes (n = 16) account for the greatest
number from any single group other than cyanobacteria
(plastids) and α-proteobacteria (mitochondria), and are followed by five genes from γ-proteobacteria and β-proteobacteria. The latter are also the most represented bacterial groups

Further evidence for an ancient chlamydial
endosymbiosis with primary photosynthetic
eukaryotes
Because chlamydiae are found in diverse eukaryotes such as
acanthamoebae and animals [17,57], it is tempting to speculate that the chlamydial endosymbiosis might have existed
before the split of the primary photosynthetic eukaryotes
from other eukaryotic groups. In this study, we searched the
GenBank database, which includes genome sequences of

information

The residence of plastids and mitochondria within eukaryotic
cells led to frequent gene transfers from these organelles to
the nucleus [51-53]. Indeed, it has been reported that thousands of genes were transferred from chloroplasts to the
nucleus in Arabidopsis [53]. Therefore, an apparent question
related to our hypothesis is, can we infer the chlamydial endosymbiosis event based on 21 genes?

reports

Counting the numbers: can endosymbiosis be inferred
from 21 genes?

To answer this question, it should be re-emphasized that all
extant chlamydial species are obligate intracellular bacteria.
Therefore, if these chlamydiae-like genes in primary photosynthetic eukaryotes resulted from gene transfer from
chlamydiae, then they are probably derived from a chlamydial endosymbiont. It should also be noted that although gene
transfer from organelles to the nucleus occurs frequently in
eukaryotes, the actual scope of transfer might vary among lineages. For example, up to 18% of the nuclear genome was
interpreted as derived from plastids in Arabidopsis, but a
much lower percentage of intracellular gene transfer has been
found in the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa (9.1%) [54]
and in the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Huang and
Gogarten, unpublished data). Given the relatively smaller
genome of Cyanidioschyzon (4,771 predicted protein-coding
genes) and a lower level of intracellular gene transfer, it
would probably not be possible to identify thousands of genes
of any organellar or endosymbiont origin (mitochondrial,
plastidic, or chlamydial) in our genome analyses. Most
importantly, the retention of transferred genes is often
related to the retention and functionality of the organelles in
eukaryotic cells [41]. Because the protein products of intracellularly transferred genes often function in the original
organelles, loss of certain biochemical functions or even of the
organelles themselves will certainly lead to the loss of related
transferred genes. For instance, even though thousands of
genes were reportedly transferred from chloroplasts in Arabidopsis [53], the number of such genes is significantly lower in
apicomplexan parasites that harbor a relict, nonphotosynthetic plastid. About 30 genes of plastidic origin (<1% of the
nuclear genome) were reported in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum [55] and only two such genes
were identified in Cryptosporidium that probably lost the
plastid entirely [49]. None of these intracellularly transferred
genes in apicomplexans are related to photosynthesis. A similar scenario was suggested for Entamoeba, which contains a
reduced mitochondrion-derived organelle and appears to
have lost most mitochondrial pathways [56]. Therefore, the
number of chlamydiae-like genes identified in photosynthetic
eukaryotes, albeit being a small fraction of the cyanobacterial
genes reported in Arabidopsis and still lower than reported in
some heterotrophic apicomplexans, is many times higher
than in Cryptosporidium. This lower number of chlamydiaelike genes in primary photosynthetic eukaryotes is in accordance with the seeming absence of chlamydial endosymbionts
in modern plastid-containing lineages.

reviews

The high number of genes transferred between chlamydiae
and photosynthetic eukaryotes is probably due to a more stable association of these two groups in the past. In general,
such an association could theoretically occur in the form of
symbiosis or physical contact between donor and recipient
organisms. However, given the distribution of chlamydiaelike genes mainly in primary photosynthetic eukaryotes and
the fact that all extant chlamydial species are obligate endosymbionts, we propose that these genes resulted from an
ancient chlamydial endosymbiosis with the ancestor of primary photosynthetic eukaryotes, rather than multiple independent horizontal transfer events or an ancestral
relationship between chlamydiae and cyanobacteria. Presumably, the chlamydial symbiotic partner was similar to extant
environmental Protochlamydia. We use the term 'symbiont'
(or 'endosymbiont' in the case of chlamydiae) in the sense of
deBary [31] to include mutualistic, parasitic, and commensal
associations. Such an ancient endosymbiotic association,
similar to those giving rise to mitochondria and plastids,
would allow ample time for intracellular (or endosymbiotic)
gene transfer from the chlamydial endosymbiont to the
nucleus of its eukaryotic hosts (either the ancestor of all primary photosynthetic eukaryotes or individual plastid-containing lineages such as green plants or red algae) and
occasionally between the chlamydial endosymbiont and the
plastids. Additionally, because the protein products of these
intracellularly transferred genes often target to the original
organelles, the co-existence of chlamydial and cyanobacterial
endosymbionts within the same eukaryotic cell also led to the
targeting of chlamydial gene products into plastids and vice
versa.

comment

in GenBank (the taxonomy browser in Entrez of the National
Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] reported
1,692,357 protein sequences from γ and β-proteobacteria, and
only 28,831 from the chlamydiae/verrucomicrobia group as
of 4 November 2006). Because of a greater level of stringency,
the number of chlamydiae-like genes identified in our phylogenetic analyses is much lower than previously reported (19
versus the 37 reporrted by Brinkman and coworkers [13] in
green plants), but this number is still striking, given that
using similar methods only a total of 31 genes acquired from
all other sources (including those likely from plants and plastids) were identified in the apicomplexan Cryptosporidium
parvum [49] and about 50 genes in the kinetoplastid
Trypanosoma brucei [50].

many early-branching eukaryotes, and the TBestDB, which
covers diverse groups of protists. Chlamydiae-like genes were
found to be restricted mainly to primary photosynthetic
eukaryotes and other plastid-containing lineages, supporting
specifically an association between chlamydiae and the
ancestor of primary photosynthetic eukaryotes. An association with an even earlier eukaryote is not supported.
The hypothesis of an ancient chlamydial endosymbiosis is
consistent with the available data. For example, the gene
encoding ATP/ADP translocase is a key innovation by obligate intracellular bacteria (chlamydiae and rickettsiae) that
live as energy parasites. Instead of making ATP on their own,
these bacterial parasites gain ATP from their host cells and
transport ADP back for recycling. Aside from these obligate
intracellular bacteria, recognizable homologs of the ATP/
ADP translocase gene are only found in the microsporidial
Encephalitozoon (another obligate intracellular parasite) and
photosynthetic eukaryotes, where they provide plastids (the
original cyanobacterial endosymbiont) with the ATP necessary for starch and fatty acid biosynthesis or as an energy supplement for carbon dioxide fixation [58-60]. The common
origin of plastidic and chlamydial ATP/ADP translocases was
confirmed by all available phylogenetic analyses [22,25-28],
and various evolutionary scenarios have been proposed
[13,22,25-28]. However, gene transfer from a chlamydial
endosymbiont to its photosynthetic eukaryotic hosts offers a
more logical and parsimonious explanation (also see
Schmitz-Esser and coworkers [27] for related discussions).
The phylogenies of gcpE and fabI (Figure 2) also are in agreement with our hypothesis of an ancient chlamydial endosymbiont in the ancestor of primary photosynthetic eukaryotes.
Like the genes encoding 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (ispD) and 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (ispE; Figure 1a,b), gcpE is
related to isoprenoid biosynthesis (see section "Implications
for plastid and eukaryotic evolution" for discussion). The
gcpE sequences from green plants, apicomplexans, haptophytes, and chlorarachniophytes form a strongly supported
monophyletic group with chlamydial (in particular Protochlamydia) homologs. On the other hand, the gcpE sequences
from red algae and glaucophytes form another strongly supported group with cyanobacterial homologs. These two
groups are not particularly related (Figure 2a) and it is highly
unlikely that the chlamydial gcpE gene was acquired from
cyanobacteria or plastids. The most plausible explanation for
this observation is that two distinct gcpE gene copies were
originally contributed by chlamydial and cyanobacterial
(plastidic) endosymbionts to the nuclear genome of the
ancestral primary photosynthetic eukaryote and differentially
retained in green plants, red algae, and glaucophytes. The
chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella and apicomplexan Plasmodium, and the haptophyte Isochrysis are believed to contain a
green and a red algal endosymbiont, respectively [10,61,62];
their proximity in the same chlamydial group (Figure 2a)

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R99

probably resulted from independent losses of the plastidic
(cyanobacterial) gcpE gene copy in these taxa.
FabI is another chlamydiae-related gene, aside from the gene
encoding β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (fabF; Table 1 and Figure
1c), which is involved in type II fatty acid biosynthesis. Similar to the gcpE gene phylogeny, cyanobacterial and red algal
Cyanidioschyzon fabI sequences form one group, whereas
homologs from chlamydiae, green plants, apicomplexans,
chlorarachniophytes, and diatoms form another group. These
two very distinct sequence groups differ in several highly conserved insertions and deletions, but the relationship between
them is less certain because of insufficient internal bootstrap
support on the gene tree. Therefore, although it is more likely
that the two sequence groups in photosynthetic eukaryotes
are derived from cyanobacterial and chlamydial endosymbionts, respectively, it is also theoretically possible that chlamydiae acquired their fabI from the plastids of a plant-related
group [63]. Because of the distinct sequence difference of the
two fabI copies, this second scenario entails one of the two
following possibilities. The first is the existence of two fabI
paralogs in the cyanobacterial progenitor of plastids and subsequent independent losses in extant cyanobacteria, and in
red algae and other plastid-containing eukaryotes. The second possibility is that independent transfer events occurred
from plastids to the nucleus of green plants, apicomplexans,
other plastid-containing groups, and the ancestor of extant
chlamydiae. In either of the alternative scenarios, a chlamydial endosymbiont and its co-existence with plastids in the
same host cell would provide a favorable intracellular environment for transfer between chlamydiae and other
organelles.

Implications for plastid and eukaryotic evolution
Ancient endosymbionts gave rise to organelles, including
mitochondria, hydrogenosomes, and plastids [1]. Thus far, no
chlamydial endosymbiont has been reported in photosynthetic eukaryotes. Whether a relict organelle derived from the
proposed ancient chlamydial endosymbiont exists in extant
plastid-containing lineages remains to be further investigated. On the other hand, it also would not be surprising if the
chlamydial endosymbiont had degenerated entirely during
the evolution of photosynthetic eukaryotes. As obligate intracellular bacterial parasites, chlamydiae depend on their hosts
for certain nutrients, and consequently they have a relatively
reduced genome [20,21]. Many dispensable genes were probably lost as a result of their parasitic lifestyle. Given the lack
of apparent benefit to the host cell, such gene losses in an isolated intracellular system could gradually lead to deterioration of the endosymbiont genome and ultimately the
endosymbiont itself [64].
Almost all chlamydiae-like genes identified in red algae and
green plants (Table 1) contain a predicted plastid-targeting
signal, although the example of CMP-KDO synthetase suggests that this prediction may not always be reliable. The

In the second stage, gene transfer between the chlamydial
endosymbiont and the host cell ensued because of their physical association. As a result, the eukaryotic host acquired
transporters from the chlamydial endosymbiont, facilitating
its communication with the cyanobacterial captive. At this
stage, the relationship between chlamydial endosymbiont
and the host cell might be considered transiently mutualistic.
Gene transfer between the cyanobacterial captive and the
host cell might also have occurred during this stage (Figure
3c).

information

The likely ancient chlamydial endosymbiosis with primary
photosynthetic eukaryotes has some other important implications for eukaryotic evolution. Ancient endosymbiosis
events, such as those that gave rise to mitochondria and plastids, to a large degree defined the evolution of eukaryotes. Our
data suggest that these ancient endosymbiosis events might

interactions

Once a rich repertoire of transporters were in place in primary photosynthetic eukaryotes, transport of photosynthetic
products and other metabolites across the photosynthetic
organelle might be more easily adapted to the different membranes in secondary or tertiary endosymbiotic hosts [70].
This also explains the observation that secondary endosymbiosis is more frequent than primary endosymbiosis in eukaryotic evolution.

refereed research

In the fourth and final stage, once the plastid organelle was
fully established in the host cell, the benefits of the chlamydial
endosymbiont to the host became less apparent. It is possible
that the chlamydial endosymbiont remained in the host cell
mostly as a bacterial parasite. Such a parasitic relationship
might not be sustained over a long period of time and the
chlamydial endosymbiont might have gradually degenerated.
It is also possible that the chlamydial endosymbiont was
transformed into an organelle yet to be recognized in photosynthetic eukaryotes (Figure 3e).

deposited research

In the third stage, the cyanobacterial captive was gradually
transformed into a photosynthetic organelle (plastid) in the
host cell and a stable, mutualistic relationship between the
plastid and the host cell was in place. The plastid provided
photosynthetic products to the host, whereas the host offered
shelter and also transported protein products of the intracellularly transferred genes (both from the chlamydial endosymbiont and the cyanobacterial captive) and other necessary
metabolites to the plastid organelle (Figure 3d).

reports

We suggest that three organisms were involved in establishing the primary photosynthetic lineage: the eukaryotic host
cell, the cyanobacterial endosymbiont that provided photosynthetic capability, and a chlamydial endosymbiont or parasite that facilitated the establishment of the cyanobacterial
endosymbiont. The coexistence of three partners with different biological requirements and capabilities might have
offered an opportunity for some transient mutualistic interactions, and the acquisition of genes such as those encoding
ATP/ADP translocase and sodium:hydrogen antiporter from
the chlamydial endosymbiont might have facilitated the successful endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria by allowing energy
flux into the protoplastid organelle and effective regulation of
ion composition. Specifically, we hypothesize that the origin
and the establishment of primary plastids might have
involved the following stages.

In the first stage, a chlamydial bacterium, similar to the
extant Protochlamydia, entered a mitochondrion-containing
eukaryote as a bacterial parasite. This chlamydial endosymbiont possessed a necessary transport system to gain nutrients
and other metabolites from the host cell. At about the same
time, a once free-living photoautotrophic cyanobacterium
was captured by the eukaryotic host by chance, initially possibly as a food source (Figure 3a,b).

reviews

Secondary endosymbioses between photoautotrophic algae
and heterotrophic host cells occurred several times during
eukaryotic evolution [9-12]. In contrast, the formation of the
primary cyanobacterial endosymbiosis appears to have been
unique (but also see the report by Marin and coworkers [69]).
Our finding of the probable participation of a third symbiotic
partner offers an explanation for this rarity. As free-living
photoautotrophic cells, in which ATP is generated in the main
cytoplasmic compartment, cyanobacteria do not need mechanisms to transport energy-rich metabolites between membrane-enclosed compartments. However, for an enslaved
cyanobacterium in a heterotrophic host to transform into a
photosynthetic organelle, new transport systems are necessary. Therefore, the initial adaptation of a photoautotrophic
cyanobacterium toward a photosynthetic organelle was probably a difficult process contingent on the simultaneous presence of suitable transport systems. At least in part these
transporters might have evolved in a chlamydial parasite that
was present within the same eukaryotic host cell. These transporters enabled chlamydiae to parasitize energy and other
molecules from the host cell, but also allowed for ATP/ADP
equilibration with the cyanobacterium.

Huang and Gogarten R99.9

comment

chlamydiae-like genes are involved in a variety of biochemical
activities in plastids, including fatty acid biosynthesis, ion
transport, nitrogen metabolism, and RNA processing, among
others. Notably, three of these genes (ispD, ispE, and gcpE)
are key enzymes of the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)
pathway, which leads to the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate, a major metabolite for isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacteria and plastids [65-67]. The chlamydial origin of ispD and
ispE was also confirmed by independent studies [68], which
hypothesized that the DXP pathway in primary photosynthetic eukaryotes was probably derived from plastids. In our
phylogenetic analyses of ispD and ispE, the chlamydial and
primary photosynthetic eukaryotic sequences form a monophyletic group that is distinct from the cyanobacterial
homologs (Figure 1a,b), suggesting probable gene displacement after the endosymbiotic origin of plastids.

degenerated in modern photosynthetic eukaryotes. Note also that the
cyanobacterial endosymbiont was initially captured to solely benefit the

process facilitated by the chlamydial endosymbiont) and was gradually

have occurred more frequently, and some of them might have
been contingent on others. Such ancient endosymbioses and
subsequent intracellular gene transfers contributed to the
evolution of host organisms and their descendent lineages,
regardless of whether an organelle derived from past endosymbionts is retained in extant species.

The finding of this study also weighs into the relationship of
primary photosynthetic eukaryotes. Although a common
origin of these groups and of their plastids has been supported by many studies [29,30], several other analyses, particularly those of nuclear genes, have provided ambiguous or
conflicting results [71,72]. The ancient chlamydial endosymbiosis at the root of the primary photosynthetic lineages provides strong and independent evidence for a common origin
of all primary photosynthetic eukaryotes and of the plastids
they harbor.

Conclusion

The availability of a complete genome sequence of the red
alga Cyanidioschyzon and expressed sequence tag (EST) data
for diverse deep eukaryotes allows a more detailed study of
the distribution and evolution of chlamydiae-like genes in
primary photosynthetic eukaryotes. Our very stringent phylogenomic analyses indicate that these chlamydiae-like genes
are unlikely to have derived from independent horizontal
gene transfer events or evolutionary relatedness between
chlamydiae and cyanobacteria. The chlamydiae-like genes in
photosynthetic eukaryotes probably resulted from an ancient
endosymbiosis event between chlamydiae and the ancestor of
primary photosynthetic eukaryotes, with the chlamydial partner being similar to extant environmental Protochlamydia.
This ancient chlamydial endosymbiosis with primary photosynthetic eukaryotes might also have played a role in the
establishment of plastids by providing genes that possess new
functions and by allowing effective communications between
the cyanobacterial endosymbiont and the eukaryotic host cell.

Phylogenomic analyses of Cyanidioschyzon, which is the only
red algal species whose complete genome sequence is yet
available, were performed using PhyloGenie [75] and the
NCBI nonredundant protein sequence database to identify
chlamydiae-related genes. The results were compared with
those of previously published analyses and further detailed
phylogenetic analyses were performed. For detailed phylogenetic analyses, sequences were selected from major groups
within each domain of life. Multiple protein sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE [76] and clustalx [77],
followed by cross-comparisons and manual refinement. Only
unambiguously aligned sequence portions were used. The
alignments are detailed in Additional data file 1. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed with a maximum likelihood method
using PHYML [78] and a distance method using the program
neighbor of PHYLIP version 3.65 [79], with maximum likelihood distances calculated using TREE-PUZZLE [80]. Branch
lengths and topologies of the trees depicted in all figures (Figures 1 and 2, and Additional data file 1) were calculated with
PHYML [78]. All maximum likelihood calculations were
based on the JTT substitution matrix and a mixed model of
four gamma-distributed rate classes plus invariable sites.
Maximum likelihood distances for bootstrap analyses were
calculated using TREE-PUZZLE [80] and PUZZLEBOOT
v1.03 (ME Holder and AJ Roger; available on the web [81]).
The plastid-targeting signal of identified chlamydiae-like protein sequences was predicted using the web-based ChloroP
[34] and TargetP [35].

Protein sequences for the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae
were obtained from the Cyanidioschyzon Genome Project
[73]. The predicted protein sequences for the green alga
Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii
were
acquired
from
Chlamydomonas genome sequencing project at the Joint
Genome Institute [74]. EST sequences of several protists were
obtained from TBestDB [33] and all other sequences were
from the NCBI GenBank protein sequence database.
