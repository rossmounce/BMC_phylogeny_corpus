Abstract
Background: Robustness is a fundamental property of biological systems and is defined as the
ability to maintain stable functioning in the face of various perturbations. Understanding how
robustness has evolved has become one of the most attractive areas of research for evolutionary
biologists, as it is still unclear whether genetic robustness evolved as a direct consequence of
natural selection, as an intrinsic property of adaptations, or as congruent correlate of environment
robustness. Recent studies have demonstrated that the stem-loop structures of microRNA
(miRNA) are tolerant to some structural changes and show thermodynamic stability. We therefore
hypothesize that genetic robustness may evolve as a correlated side effect of the evolution for
environmental robustness.
Results: We examine the robustness of 1,082 miRNA genes covering six species. Our data suggest
the stem-loop structures of miRNA precursors exhibit a significantly higher level of genetic
robustness, which goes beyond the intrinsic robustness of the stem-loop structure and is not a
byproduct of the base composition bias. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phenotype of
miRNA buffers against genetic perturbations, and at the same time is also insensitive to
environmental perturbations.
Conclusion: The results suggest that the increased robustness of miRNA stem-loops may result
from congruent evolution for environment robustness. Potential applications of our findings are
also discussed.

Background
Robustness, a fundamental and ubiquitously observed
phenomenon in biological systems, is defined as the ability to maintain stable functioning in the face of various
perturbations, and is characterized as genetic or environmental robustness, depending on whether the perturba-

tions are inheritable or not [1]. Genetic robustness
describes insensitivity of a phenotype facing genetic mutations, and the insensitivity to environmental factors is
called environmental robustness. Phenotype robustness
appears at various levels of biological systems, including
gene expression, protein folding, metabolic flux, physio-

logical homeostasis, development, and even organism fitness [2]. It is consequently not surprising that biologists
have a long-standing interest in robustness, going back to
Fisher's work on dominance [3-5], and to Waddington's
developmental canalization research [6,7]. Hiroaki
Kitano argues that the requirements for robustness and
evolvability are similar, since robustness facilitates evolution and evolution favours robust traits [8]. A proper
understanding of the origin of robustness in biological
systems will catalyze our understanding of evolution [9].
The evolution of mechanism underlying the buffering of
the phenotype against genetic and environmental influences has received much theoretical and experimental
attention in recent years, yet the evolutionary origin of the
observed robustness remains unresolved. Whether it is a
consequence of natural selection or a nonadaptive correlated side-effect of other phenotypic traits is by and large
unknown. A recent review article categorized the theories
addressing the evolution of genetic robustness into three
main classes: adaptive, intrinsic, and congruent [2]. The
most straightforward explanation for the evolution of
robustness, according to the Darwinian tradition, is adaptive robustness. In this scenario, almost all mutations lead
to deviations from the optimum, and robustness is
favored by natural selection. High mutation rates, large
populations, and asexual reproduction generally favor the
evolution of robustness [10,11]. Genetic robustness may
also evolve simply because buffering is a necessary consequence of character adaptation; that is, robustness is a
nonadaptive correlated side effect of the stabilizing selection acting on other traits [12]. Additionally, because
environmental perturbations often have a higher frequency and stronger impact on fitness, they will serve as
the driving force; that is, genetic robustness evolves as a
correlated side-effect of the evolution for environmental
robustness. This is an appealing hypothesis as there is no
aspect of an organism that is inherently and persistently
vulnerable to genetic but not environmental perturbations [12]. Support for this theory comes from a recent
computational study of RNA secondary structure by Ancel
and Fontana [13], who find that RNA shapes that are
robust against environmental (thermodynamic) perturbations are also robust against mutational perturbations.
Simplified modeling of protein structures suggests that a
similar correlation between genetic robustness and thermodynamic stability might also exist for proteins [14-16].
Further supports come from recent studies of heat-shock
proteins, such as Hsp90 and GroEl, which are thought to
have evolved to protect organisms from environmental
and developmental perturbations, but appear to also
buffer against genetic perturbation in Drosophila [17], Arabidopsis [18], and Escherichia coli [19]. However, to date,
the extent to which each of these evolutionary forces contributes to the evolution of robustness remains unre-

solved, partly due to the difficulty in providing evidence
for robustness in natural biological systems [20].
Addressing this challenge, recent studies have resorted to
bioinformatics and experimental approaches. One important effort to provide the evidence of environmental
robustness has focused on the thermodynamic stability of
noncoding RNA secondary structures [21-26]. Although
the shuffling sequences generated in these studies rule out
the bias of base composition, they do not preserve the
structural phenotype of the native RNA sequences. Consequently, it cannot be determined whether the observed
increased robustness goes beyond the intrinsic robustness
of specific, functionally important structures. Comparing
with environmental robustness, genetic robustness, on
the other hand, is connected with major technical difficulties [20]. The classical approach has inferred genetic
robustness from the increase in genetic variance after a
major mutation or exposure to an environmental challenge during development [2], as exemplified by the
measurements of vibrissae number in mice, ocelli in D.
subobscura, and wing- and cross-vein interruptions and
scutellar bristle numbers in D. melanogaster, which are all
discussed in detail by Scharloo [27]. However, the evidence is often indirect and suffers from the lack of a natural reference genotype [20]. Experimental evolution is a
more direct approach that has been applied to the study
of robustness recently, which utilizes direct laboratory
observation of short-term evolutionary processes, mostly
in microbes [19,28]. Although its evolutionary potential
is limited by time constraints, this approach does not suffer from a lack of control and promises exciting new data
and insights for a more comprehensive theory of the evolution of genetic robustness [2].
Using a plausible background model is another strategy
applied to elucidate the evolution of robustness, allowing
evaluation of the significance of any greater robustness
found in the wild-type (WT) [2]. Wagner and Stadler have
compared the mutational stability of conserved and nonconserved elements in the secondary structure of a RNA
viral genome with respect to point mutations, using nonconserved elements as the reference set [29]. Their
research has demonstrated that the conserved elements
show a consistently lower variability than non-conserved
elements, suggesting that the virus evolves to a state of
increased mutational robustness. While their data do not
prove that selection that acts directly on the mutational
stability of the RNA secondary structure, increases thermodynamic stability, this study do provide the first hint
that "genetic canalization" (genetic robustness) can, in
fact, evolve as a correlated response to selection for "environmental canalization" (thermodynamic stability), as
predicted by population genetic models [1]. On the other
hand, experimental studies have demonstrated that

miRNA secondary structures are tolerant to some structural changes [30-33], with reports that miRNA precursors
exhibit a significantly higher level of thermodynamic stability [21]. We therefore hypothesize that miRNA genetic
robustness may evolve as a correlated side effect of the
evolution for environmental robustness. To our knowledge, no systematic effort has been made to test this
hypothesis in a genome-wide scale, with the exception of
an experimental study on the effect of single point mutation for limited miRNAs [30-33].
Previous researches have demonstrated that miRNAs are
abundant endogenous ~22-nucleotide (nt) noncoding
RNAs, occupying between 1–5% of the genes in any given
animal genome [34]. miRNAs regulate gene expression at
the post-transcriptional level for cleavage or translational
repression through the binding of a minimal-recognition
'seed' sequence [35-38]. Recent comparative phylogenetic
studies have revealed that conserved miRNA-binding
sequences are in more than one-third of all genes, suggesting that miRNA regulation may be relevant to a large portion of cellular processes [39-44]. Mature miRNAs are
cleaved from ~70 nt precursors (pre-miRNA) that fold
into a stem-loop hairpin structure, through the action of
Dicer endonuclease [45-47]. The miRNA stem-loop structure is conserved in evolution, and plays a crucial role
throughout miRNA gene maturation processing steps
[33,46,48-50]. Additionally, there is a selective pressure to
stabilize the stem-loop structure and some structural
changes are tolerated [51], which may result in the evolution of robustness. As well, the use of program packages
for RNA secondary structure prediction, such as Mfold
[52] and Vienna RNA package [53], facilitates genotypephenotype mapping and measurement of the structural
robustness of a given miRNA stem-loop sequence, by
comparing the predicted structure of this sequence with
the predicted structure of all its one-mutant neighbors.
Different types of reference sequences, with similar phenotypes and/or with exact or nearly exact mononucleotide
and dinucleotide base composition as the real premiRNA, can be easily generated for miRNAs, allowing for
careful control of the effects of secondary structure evolution. These merits make the miRNA stem-loop structure
an ideal system to study the evolution of genetic robustness.
In our previous study, we have developed a method to
quantitatively measure the genetic robustness of RNA secondary structure [54]. Here, we will apply this method to
investigate the robustness of 1,082 miRNA genes from six
different species. Our data suggest that the hairpin structures of miRNA precursors exhibit a significantly higher
level of mutational robustness. Additionally, through the
careful design of reference backgrounds, we show that this
excess robustness goes beyond the intrinsic robustness of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/223

the stem-loop structure, and is not the byproduct of a base
composition bias. Examination of the environmental
robustness of real miRNA stem-loops also demonstrates
that the phenotype of miRNAs buffers against genetic variations, at the same time is insensitive to environmental
perturbations. These data suggest that the increase in
genetic robustness may evolve as a correlated side effect of
the evolution for environmental robustness.

Results
m
For each real pre-miRNA, the robustness γ 1 at threshold

level T1 is compared with that of 1,000 random sequences,
and the P-value versus Z-score is showed in Figure 1(a).
Figure 2(a) shows the corresponding P-value distribution
of genetic robustness for the 1,082 miRNAs at threshold
level T1. Of the 1,082 miRNA investigated, 920 (85.0%),
534 (49.4%), 376 (34.8%) miRNA genes show significant
increases in robustness at FDR-controlled P-values of <
0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.005, respectively (Figure 3 and Table
S1, Additional file 15). We further compare the robustness
y1 of each real pre-miRNA with that of 1,000 pseudo premiRNAs, and the P-value versus Z-score is showed in Figure 1(b), so as to exclude the intrinsic robustness associated with the stem-loop hairpin structure. The
corresponding P-value distribution of genetic robustness
for the 1,082 miRNAs at threshold level T1 is showed in
Figure 2(a). Our results suggest 787 (72.7%) miRNA
genes of 1,082 are significantly more robust than pseudo
pre-miRNAs at FDR-controlled P-value of < 0.05 (Figure 3
and Table S2, Additional file 15). These data suggest that
the genetics of miRNA robustness is not a byproduct of
the specific stem-loop structure. Additionally, investigation of the robustness y1 of miRNA genes within species is
similar for each species individually (Table 1 – 2).
The mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies of an
RNA sequence, not preserved in random sequences, are
crucial for the physical stability of the secondary structure
[21-23,26]. It is consequently essential to verify that the
greater robustness of real pre-miRNAs is not a byproduct
of a bias in the base composition of the real pre-miRNA
sequences, compared with random sequences. To this
end, we generate four types of shuffled miRNAs that preserve the exact or nearly exact mononucleotide and dinucleotide base composition as the real pre-miRNA (see

Methods). The robustness γ 1 of each real pre-miRNA is

compared with that of 1,000 shuffled sequences generated by four types of shuffled methods, and the P-value
versus Z-score is showed (Additional files 1 and 2). More

810 (>75%) miRNAs show significant more robust than
shuffled pseudo pre-miRNA sequences at FDR-controlled
P-value of < 0.05 (Figure 3, Table 2, Additional files 3 and

genetic robustness of miRNA is not a byproduct of the
specific stem-loop structure and that there is no bias of the
base composition on the intrinsic robustness analysis.
These results also demonstrate that the different types of

2, ʜ, 9 of each real pre-miRNA, is compared with that of
1,000 shuffled sequences and shuffled pseudo pre-miRNAs at each threshold level, respectively (Additional files
5 and 6). These data demonstrate the threshold levels
have not affect robustness and the different types of shuffled methods are indistinguishable (Figure 4 and Additional files 5 and 6).
Due to the correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the minimum free energy structure of a given
sequence and its genetics robustness [55], the increased
genetic robustness described above may arise from the
increased thermodynamic stability of miRNAs, as recently
reported by Bonnet et al. [21]. If so, genetic robustness
may have evolved as a correlated side effect of environmental robustness. Here, we not only examine the thermodynamic stability of miRNAs in an analogous manner

to that done by Bonnet et al. [21] but also using a background model, based on random and shuffled pseudo
pre-miRNAs, that maintain the stem-loop structure as in
the real pre-miRNA (see Methods). Figure 5 graphs Pvalue against Z-score of environmental robustness for all
the 1,082 miRNAs, and the corresponding P-value distribution is showed in Figure 6. Comparison with random
sequences suggests 917 out of 1,082 (84.8%) show a high
level of thermodynamic stability at FDR-controlled Pvalue of < 0.05, similar to that previously reported [21]
(Figure 7, Table 3, and Table S3, Additional file 15). As
comparing with random pseudo pre-miRNAs, significant
thermodynamic stability is also observed in most miRNAs
(904 of 1,082, 83.5%) at FDR-controlled P-value of <
0.05, suggesting that it is not a byproduct of the special
stem-loop structure (Figure 7, Table 4, and Table S4, Additional file 15). There are also a high proportion of miRNA
sequences at each FDR-controlled P-value (Figure 7, Table

is also observed at FDR-controlled P-value of < 0.005 (Figure 7, Table 4, and Table S4- Additional file 15). Additionally, examining the thermodynamic stability of miRNA
genes within species provides a similar picture for each
species separately (Figure 7, Additional files 7, 8, 9, 10,
Table 3 – 4, and Additional file 15, Tables S3–S4).
We also investigate the correlation between genetic
robustness and thermodynamic stability of miRNA. Figure 8 shows the scatter plots of Z-scores of genetic and
environmental robustness for all the 1,082 miRNAs.
Although a strong correlation is not observed (Pearson's
correlation coefficient is 0.43, 0.40 for random sequences
and random pseudo pre-miRNAs, respectively), most of
the significantly genetic robust miRNA genes exhibit significant thermodynamic stability at the same time. Of the
1,082 miRNA genes investigated, 789 (72.9%) and 662

(61.2%) miRNAs are showed significantly genetic and
environmental robustness with FDR-controlled P-value of
< 0.05 (Figure 9, Table S5 and S6 Additional file 15), compared with random sequences and random pseudo premiRNAs, respectively. These also can be seen from the 3D
histogram plots of Z-scores of genetic and environmental
robustness (Figure 10). Furthermore, the correlation
between the genetic and environmental robustness is not
a byproduct of a base composition bias (Additional files
11, 12, 13, 14 and Tables S5–S6 Additional file 15). Our
results demonstrate that the stem-loop structures of miRNAs buffer against genetic variations, at the same time is
also insensitive to environmental perturbations, indicating that the increase in genetic robustness may evolve as a
correlated side effect of the evolution for environmental
robustness.

Discussion
There has been a growing interest of evolutionary biologists in the origins, mechanisms and consequences of
robustness [2], which is a fundamental and ubiquitously
observed property of biological systems [8]. A greater
understanding of the evolution of robustness is needed to
clarify whether genetic robustness evolved as a direct consequence of natural selection (adaptive robustness), as a
byproduct of stabilizing selection acting on fitness-related
traits (intrinsic robustness), or as a correlated response to
environmental robustness (congruent robustness) [2].
Recent studies have demonstrated that the stem-loop
structures of miRNA are tolerant to some structural
changes and show thermodynamic stability. We therefore
hypothesize that the genetic robustness of miRNAs may
evolve as a correlated side effect of the evolution for environmental robustness in the current study. Using the
method proposed in our previous study [54], we examine
the robustness of 1,082 miRNA genes covering six species,
and show that the stem-loop structures of miRNA precur(a)

sors exhibit a significantly higher level of genetic robustness at different FDR-controlled P-values. Additionally,
we generate a reference background of phenotypes similar
to real pre-miRNAs (pseudo pre-miRNAs), and demonstrate that this excess robustness of miRNA genes goes
beyond the intrinsic robustness of the stem-loop structure. The effect of base composition bias on robustness is
ruled out by careful design of corresponding shuffling reference backgrounds. Examination of the environmental
robustness of real pre-miRNAs also demonstrates that the
phenotype of miRNA buffers against genetic perturbations, and at the same time is insensitive to environmental
perturbations. These results suggest that increased genetic
robustness may evolve as a correlated side effect of the
evolution for environmental robustness.
Pang et al. [56] argue that even slight changes in miRNA
sequences can fundamentally alter their function, when
they interpret the conservation of miRNAs and snoRNAs.
Our data suggest this interpretation might be premature.

Experimental studies also have demonstrated that stemloop structures of miRNAs are, to a certain degree, tolerant

which no effects are noted resulting from changes in the
loop sequence [30-33] and further suggesting that the

bation, compared with random RNA sequences with similar stem-loop structures [57], suggesting that this excess
robustness of miRNAs goes beyond the intrinsic robustness of the stem-loop hairpin structure. The study further
demonstrates that this excess robustness is not the
byproduct of a base composition bias. These results are in
much agreement with our findings, although the quantitative measures of genetic robustness defined in these two
studies are quite different. The authors then reexamine the
thermodynamic stability of miRNA utilizing the method
used by Bonnet et al. [21], with a background model
based on inversely folded sequences rather than the shuffled sequences, and find that most of the statistical effect
vanished, suggesting that the excess robustness of miRNA
stem-loops is the result of direct evolutionary pressure
toward increased robustness. The different conclusions
(adaptive robustness vs. congruent robustness) may have
resulted from differences in the reference backgrounds
employed. The reference backgrounds in our study are
made up of random and shuffled pseudo pre-miRNA
sequences with preserved phenotypes that are similar to
real pre-miRNAs (see Methods). Their reference backgrounds, on the other hand, are produced by inverse folding.
On the other hand, Hermission and Wagner classify
robustness as adaptive and intrinsic [58]. The adaptive
robustness in their definition encompass both adaptive
and congruent scenarios within the classification system
established by de Visser et al. [2]. They consider robustness to be adaptive if the buffering of that trait with
respect to some source of variation has the target of natural selection. In other words, robust character states are
selected because of their reduced variability. According to
this view, our study and the study of Borenstein and Ruppin [57] come to the same conclusion of adaptive robustness, which is a property that evolves for its own sake. The
difference is that the natural forces, assumed to be responsible for its evolution, function as a kind of stabilizing
selection acting directly on a character, or on some highly
correlated pleiotropic trait [58].
Our study will facilitate the in silico identification of
novel miRNAs. Computational identification of miRNAs
is based largely on the phylogenetic conservation and the
structural characteristics of miRNA precursors [59-61]. A
recent study integrating bioinformatics predictions with
microarray analysis and sequence-directed cloning, that
does not include inter-species conservation, identifies
hundreds of new human miRNAs, many of which are
poorly conserved beyond primates [62]. The significantly
greater robustness of the miRNA stem-loop structures that
buffers environmental and genetic perturbations may also
facilitate improved miRNA identification on a single
genome and can serve as a complementary method to fil-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/223

ter out random pseudo pre-miRNA sequences. Our findings may also be utilized for the improvement of in vitro
selection or SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by
Exponential enrichment), an experimental method for
selecting functional RNAs from a large pool (1015) of random sequences [63,64]. The use of designed sequences
with thermodynamic stability and genetic robustness, in
lieu of random sequences, may increase the probability of
identifying novel functional RNAs.
The in silico approach utilized in the current study is a
simple yet powerful, biologically well-grounded model
for studying the evolution of genetic robustness. The
importance of this computational approach is emphasized by the fact that the large numbers of perturbations
(more than 2 × 109 point mutants are generated and
folded) analyzed here are not easily studied in laboratory
experiments. Although this in silico study can not completely rule out all alternative hypotheses, the carefully
designed reference background model and the statistical
analysis of the results strongly support the hypothesis of
congruent evolution of robustness. A greater understanding of the evolution of robustness will require quantitative
knowledge of the forces producing robustness, such as the
distribution of fitness effects of mutations [12]. Further
researches are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms
of the evolution of robustness.

Conclusion
The current study investigate the evolutionary origin of
genetic robustness – a fundamental evolutionary molecular biology problem which has not been fully elucidated.
We have shown that miRNA stem-loop structures exhibit
a significantly higher level of genetic robustness at different FDR-controlled P-values, which goes beyond the
intrinsic robustness of the stem-loop structure and is not
a byproduct of a base composition bias. Furthermore, we
have demonstrated that the phenotypes of miRNAs buffer
against genetic perturbations, and at the same time are
also insensitive to environmental perturbations. Our findings suggest that the increased robustness of miRNA stemloops may evolve as a correlated side effect of evolution
for environmental robustness.

Methods
Real pre-miRNAs, reference sets and RNA folding
1,082 real pre-miRNA sequences included in the analysis
are selected from MicroRNA Registry release 7.1, which all
have been experimentally verified to avoid a possible bias
introduced by consideration of predicted miRNA precursors (Table 5) [65,66]. The available sequences covered six
species: H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, D. rerio, C. elegans, M.
musculus, and R. norvegicus.

In addition to the real pre-miRNAs specified in Table 5, a
reference set consisting of 1,000 random RNA sequences
for each real pre-miRNA is generated, and an additional
reference set consisting of 1,000 hairpin sequences with
similar stem-loops as real pre-miRNAs (pseudo pre-miRNAs) using a similar idea of the RNAinverse program in
Vienna RNA package [53] is also generated to investigate
whether the increased robustness stemmed intrinsically
from the miRNA stem-loop structures. To rule out the
effect of base composition bias on robustness, four types
of reference sets for each real pre-miRNA are made using
four different sequence shuffling methods: mononucleotide shuffling, dinucleotide shuffling and shuffling
based on a zero and first order Markov model. Each type
of reference set is also consisted of 1,000 shuffled
sequences that preserved the exact or nearly exact mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies as real premiRNA. Additionally, four types of shuffling reference sets
which consisted of 1,000 shuffled pseudo pre-miRNAs
that preserved not only the stem-loop structure but also
the exact or nearly exact mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies as real pre-miRNA are generated for each
miRNA. These sequence shuffling methods first generate
the corresponding shuffling sequences preserving exact or
nearly exact mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies with the methods previously used in the studies of the
thermodynamic stability of RNA secondary structures [2123,26], and then search for the shuffling sequences with
similar stem-loop as real pre-miRNAs using a similar idea
of the RNAinverse program [53].

tural changes [30-33]. To reflect this flexibility in
sequence/structure requirements, at a given threshold, Tj,
we define the robustness [54], γj, as follows:

γj = ΌNj(d)΍, j = 1, 2, ..., 9.

(1)

where d is the structure distance between the secondary
structure of the WT sequence and the secondary structure
of the mutant, and Nj(d) is number of mutants with structure distance lesser than or equal to the threshold Tj. γj is
the average of Nj(d) over all 3 × L one-mutant neighbors.
The maximum value of the structural distance between
the secondary structure of the WT sequence and the secondary structure of the mutants is used as a baseline value
to evaluate the threshold level [54]. The threshold Tj, j = 1,
2, ..., 9 is set to 10%, 20%, ..., 90% of the maximum value
of the metric, respectively. The larger value of the robustness γj at threshold Tj indicates a relatively higher level of
robustness.
We compare the secondary structure between WT and its
mutant using a variety of distance measures for secondary
structures [53,67-69], including topological indices [70],
tree-edit and string-eidt distance [53,71], and base-pair
distance [55]. While the data in this paper are obtained by
base-pair distance, the qualitative results are obtained
independent of the distance measure used.

At each threshold Tj, we evaluate the robustness γ m of the

The RNAfold in Vienna RNA package (version 1.6) [53] is

optimal folding results.

the simultaneous testing of thousands of hypotheses,
multiple hypotheses testing is important to control the
