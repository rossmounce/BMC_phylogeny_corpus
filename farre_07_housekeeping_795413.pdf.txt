information

The correct functioning of multicellular organisms depends
on a complex orchestration of gene regulatory events, which
ensure that genes are expressed at the right time, place and
level. Much of this regulation occurs at the level of gene tran-

interactions

Conclusion: This is the first report that shows that the promoters of housekeeping genes show
reduced sequence conservation with respect to genes expressed in a more tissue-restricted
manner. This is likely to be related to simpler gene expression, requiring a smaller number of
functional cis-regulatory motifs.

refereed research

Background: Understanding the constraints that operate in mammalian gene promoter
sequences is of key importance to understand the evolution of gene regulatory networks. The level
of promoter conservation varies greatly across orthologous genes, denoting differences in the
strength of the evolutionary constraints. Here we test the hypothesis that the number of tissues in
which a gene is expressed is related in a significant manner to the extent of promoter sequence
conservation.

Housekeeping genes tend to show reduced upstream sequence
conservation

Farré et al.

Changes in gene expression patterns can cause important
phenotypic modifications. Mutations in cis-regulatory motifs
can alter the binding affinity of transcription factors and
affect the expression of a gene. However, the evolutionary
dynamics of promoter sequences are still poorly understood.
A commonly used approach to assess the existence of evolutionary constraints and identify regulatory motifs is the identification of conserved non-coding sequences across
orthologues. This rationale is behind several described 'phylogenetic footprinting' methods to discover functional regulatory sequences [2-4].
Contrary to coding sequences, gene expression regulatory
sequences do not have very well defined boundaries. A region
spanning approximately 100 base-pairs (bp) upstream of the
TSS, known as the basal promoter, plays a fundamental part
in the assembly of the transcription initiation complex. Further upstream regulatory sequences are of variable length
depending on the particular gene [1]. Nevertheless, a recent
study has shown that, at distances longer than 2 Kb from the
TSS, the similarity between orthologous promoters drastically drops, indicating that most of the functional elements
concentrate in the 2 Kb promoter region [5]. In accordance,
about 85% of the known mouse transcription regulatory
motifs are located within 2 Kb of the gene promoter region [6]
and functional assays have shown that a region spanning 500 to +50 relative to the TSS region is sufficient to drive
transcription in cultured cells for most human genes [7].
Promoter sequence comparisons across different species
have shed light on the different constraints exhibited by promoters of different types of genes. In particular, it has been
observed that the promoters of genes encoding regulatory
proteins, such as transcription factors and/or developmental
proteins, tend to show remarkably strong sequence conservation [8,9], suggesting that the expression of this class of genes
requires a relatively large amount of cis-regulatory motifs.
Another important factor that may be related to promoter
sequence conservation is the number of tissues in which a
gene is expressed. In the adult organism, some genes show
high tissue-specificity while others show little or no tissue
expression restrictions (ubiquitous expression). The effect of
expression breadth on promoter conservation has not been
addressed previously. Here we provide evidence that, in
mammals, the simple expression patterns exhibited by
housekeeping genes - expressed in all or nearly all tissues are often associated with limited promoter sequence conservation, while tissue expression restrictions are associated
with increasingly high promoter conservation. This defines a
new important property of mammalian gene promoters.

Results
Divergence of orthologous human and mouse
promoter sequences
The promoters of different genes exhibit varying degrees of
sequence divergence [8-10]. In genes from nematodes [11]
and yeast [12], the level of promoter sequence divergence is
positively correlated with the evolutionary rate of the encoded
protein. An interesting question is whether such a correspondence also exists in mammals. We collected human and
mouse orthologous promoters (6,698 pairs, 2 Kb from the
transcription start site) and applied different measures of
sequence divergence. We aimed at quantifying promoter
sequence divergence, evaluating the strength of selection and
identifying any significant relationship between the divergence of promoter and coding sequences.
First, we calculated the fraction of the promoter sequence
that failed to align between human and mouse orthologues.
We used the local pairwise sequence alignment program
described in Castillo-Davis et al. [11], which provides a score,
dSM (shared motif divergence), that corresponds to the fraction of non-aligned sequence. The average value was 0.701,
which means that, on average, 29.9% of the 2 Kb promoter
sequence was successfully aligned. On the promoter alignments we estimated the number of nucleotide substitutions
per site using PAML [13]. This promoter substitution rate,
which we term Kp, was, on average, 0.334 substitutions per
site.
Next we estimated the synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates of the corresponding gene coding sequences using PAML. In mammals, Ks can be used to
account for the background mutation level. Ka, on the contrary, corresponds to changes at the amino acid level and
reflects the strength of selection on the protein. In the orthologous dataset, the average Ks was 0.709 and the average Ka
0.084. The approximately two-fold difference between Kp
and Ks (0.334 and 0.709, respectively) indicates stronger
negative or purifying selection in the evolution of promoter
sequences with respect to synonymous sites in coding
regions.
We subsequently addressed the question of whether the level
of promoter sequence divergence is related to the evolutionary rate in the corresponding coding sequence in mammals.
Interestingly, we found a modest although significant positive
correlation between the promoter divergence (dSM) and the
coding sequence substitution rate (dSM and Ka, r = 0.20, p <
10-58; dSM and Ka/Ks, r = 0.14, p < 10-29; dSM and Ks, r = 0.18,
p < 10-48). That is, in general, proteins that showed high
divergence between human and mouse (high Ka or Ka/Ks)
showed a tendency to be encoded by genes with reduced promoter sequence conservation.

refereed research

Additional support for the results was obtained using human
gene expression data. We mapped the orthologous genes to
the eVOC database (anatomical system and cell type) [17],
based on expressed sequence tag data, and to Gene Atlas [18].
The results obtained using these datasets were in strong
agreement with the results presented in Table 1 (see Supplementary tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively, in Additional data
file 1). That is, the fraction of human genes with the broadest
tissue expression (HK genes) always showed significantly
higher promoter divergence values.

deposited research

We used mouse transcriptome microarray data from Zhang et
al. [14] to classify the previously defined genes into different
groups according to their expression in 55 mouse organs and
tissues (see Supplementary table S5 in Additional data file 1).
The orthologous dataset with expression data contained
3,893 genes. The tissue distribution profile in five-tissue bins
(Figure 1) showed a bimodal shape with a moderate excess of
genes expressed in a few tissues and a more acute excess of
genes expressed in a very large number of tissues. Genes with
expression restricted to 1-10 tissues were classified as
'restricted' (986 genes), those with ubiquitous or nearly ubiquitous expression (51-55 tissues) as 'housekeeping' (HK;
1,018 genes), and the rest, expressed in 11-50 tissues, as
'intermediate' (1,889 genes).

reports

Gene expression breadth

We compared dSM, Kp, Ka and Ks values for genes classified
in the three different expression groups (Table 1). We
observed that the average dSM score, which corresponds to the
fraction of the 2 Kb promoter that cannot be aligned, consistently increased with the expression breadth. The average dSM
in HK genes was 0.732 (26.8% promoter conservation),
whereas in genes with 'restricted' expression it was 0.688
(31.2% promoter conservation). The dSM values were significantly different between HK genes and the other non-HK
groups (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, p
< 10-5). The nucleotide substitution rate within aligned
regions, Kp, was, instead, not significantly different across
the different datasets. Kp also showed decreased variability
with respect to Ks, with about three times lower standard
deviation values (Table 1). In contrast to promoter divergence, both Ka and Ka/Ks in coding sequences were significantly lower in HK genes than in the other groups (Table 1).
In fact, we observed a negative correlation between expression breadth and Ka (r = -0.31, p < 10-87), in accordance with
previous results [15,16]. Therefore, while at the promoter
level the constraints appeared to be weaker in HK genes than
in the rest of the genes, at the level of the protein sequence the
situation was reversed.

Figure 2
Promoter sequence conservation in HK and non-HK genes
Promoter sequence conservation in HK and non-HK genes. The x-axis shows 100 nucleotide bins along 2 Kb upstream of the TSS. The y-axis shows
percent conservation ((1 - dSM) × 100). Genes were grouped according to the presence or absence of a CpG island and Ka/Ks values. Significant p values
for 2 Kb promoter sequence divergence comparisons are indicated below the curves. Beneath these, the p values obtained for regions -2,000 to -500
(left), and -500 to the TSS (right), are given in smaller font size.

The next question we addressed was whether the reduced
sequence conservation observed in HK genes was uniformly
distributed along the 2 Kb upstream sequence or,
alternatively, it could be mapped to a particular region of the
promoter. Considering the complete 2 Kb sequences, dSM differences between HK and non-HK datasets were significant at
p < 10-6 (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Then, we calculated
the average sequence conservation (1 - dSM) in 100 nucleotide
overlapping sequence windows (bins) along the 2 Kb promoter sequence in HK and non-HK genes (Figure 2, top row,
left). We found that the region spanning from the TSS to position -100 showed the highest level of sequence conservation
(average 1 - dSM 0.576, or 57.6% promoter conservation). Further upstream, the sequence conservation gradually dropped,
with a stronger decay in HK than in non-HK genes (Figure 2,
top row, left). If we considered only the proximal promoter
region, from the TSS to position -500, we did not detect statistically significant differences (p = 0.0633). However, using
the region from the TSS to -600, differences became significant at p < 0.05 (p = 0.0195). On the other hand, when we
considered the distal promoter region only, from -500 to 2,000, the gap between the two types of sequences regarding
promoter divergence increased (p < 10-8). Therefore, we concluded that the observed lower promoter sequence conserva-

tion of HK genes concentrated in regions upstream from
position -500.

Functions of encoded gene products
Our data show that HK genes contained poorly conserved
promoters, particularly in the promoter distal part (upstream
from -500). Other studies reported differences in the conservation of promoter sequences in relation to the function of the
protein [8,9]. As HK genes encode proteins with biased function composition [19,20], we measured the over- and underrepresentation of different Gene Ontology (GO) terms [21] in
the group of HK genes. We also assessed whether the functional biases in HK genes could alone explain the differences
observed in promoter sequence conservation.
We determined which GO classes were over- or under-represented among HK genes (p < 0.01, χ2 test), using the 'molecular function', 'biological process', and 'cellular component'
classification systems (Supplementary table S4 in Additional
data file 1). As expected, an important fraction of the classes
statistically over-represented among HK genes showed significantly high promoter sequence divergence. For example,
in genes classified as 'structural constituent of ribosome', and
'mitochondrion' the average promoter sequence conservation

Given the promoter sequence divergence differences among
gene functional classes, one possibility was that the functional class bias in HK genes could fully explain the differences found between HK and non-HK genes. For this reason

we tested whether there were any dSM differences between HK
and non-HK genes within the same GO class. For statistical
robustness we considered only GO classes with a minimum of
150 genes (22 classes; Table 2). In 19 of these classes, the
average dSM of HK genes was higher than that of non-HK
genes. For example, transcription factors with HK expression
had an average dSM of 0.673 (32.7% promoter conservation),
while those with no HK expression had an average dSM of
0.602 (39.8% promoter conservation). Of the 19 classes, 9
showed significant dSM differences between HK and non-HK
genes (p < 0.05). On the other hand, in the three classes with
higher average dSM scores in non-HK than in HK genes the
differences were not significant (p > 0.64). Therefore, we con-

was only 23% (dSM = 0.77). On the other hand, many classes
under-represented among HK genes showed significantly
high promoter sequence conservation (low dSM). For example, genes annotated as 'transcription factor activity' or 'nervous system development' showed an average promoter
conservation of 42% (dSM = 0.58), and genes annotated as
'cell differentiation' showed an average promoter conservation of 43% (dSM = 0.57).

cluded that the promoter sequence divergence differences
between HK and non-HK genes were essentially maintained
within the different GO classes.

CpG island content and coding sequence evolutionary
rate
The promoters of HK genes are rich in CpG islands [22-25].
This could potentially influence the level of conservation of
promoter sequences. Therefore, we divided the gene dataset
into genes containing CpG islands (CpG+) and genes not containing CpG islands (CpG-), according to the presence or
absence of a CpG island in the region -100 to +100 (see Materials and methods), and analyzed the two groups separately.
Of the mouse genes, 65% were classified as CpG+ (91% of the
human orthologs of these were also CpG+). Among the genes
classified as HK, this number went up to 88%. The length of
CpG islands was not significantly different in HK and non-HK
genes.
Within CpG+ genes, we observed the previously described
positive relationship between promoter sequence divergence
(dSM) and expression breadth. HK genes (expressed in 51-55
tissues) had an average dSM of 0.739, whereas genes
expressed in an intermediate number of tissues (11-50) and
those with restricted expression (1-10 tissues) had average
dSM scores of 0.708 and 0.679, respectively. These scores are
comparable to those obtained previously (Table 1) and the
differences between HK and non-HK genes were highly significant (p < 10-4; Figure 2, top row, middle). Similar results
were obtained with other gene expression datasets (Figures
S1, S2 and S3 in Additional data file 2).
In contrast, in CpG- genes the differences between HK and
non-HK genes were smaller, and did not reach statistical significance in the mouse gene dataset (Figure 2, top row, right).
Indeed, HK genes that did not contain CpG islands (12% of
the HK genes) showed average promoter sequence divergence similar to that of non-HK genes (around 0.69). Thus,
this minority of HK genes with no CpG islands appeared to
have increased sequence evolutionary constraints in relation
to the rest of the HK genes.
We also assessed if the presence or absence of CpG islands
influenced dSM differences between HK and non-HK genes
within the same GO class. In CpG+ genes the differences
between HK and non-HK genes were even more marked than
in the complete dataset, and three additional GO functions
showed statistical differences (Table 2). In CpG- genes,
instead, the differences between HK and non-HK genes per
GO class were, in almost all cases, not significant.
We had previously described a positive correlation between
the non-synonymous substitution rate, Ka (or Ka/Ks), and
promoter sequence divergence (dSM). That is, many rapidly
evolving coding sequences were associated with poorly conserved promoters. This seemed at first to contradict the find-

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R140

ing that HK genes, with typically low Ka values, tended to
have highly divergent promoters. To unravel the effect of coding sequence evolutionary rate and expression breadth in
promoter sequence evolution, we divided the gene dataset
into two groups, genes with Ka/Ks < 0.06, a fraction representing about one-third of the genes and highly enriched in
HK genes, and the rest of the genes, with Ka/Ks ≥ 0.06.
The first observation was that, according to the general correlation, genes with more slowly evolving coding sequences
(Ka/Ks < 0.06) showed higher promoter conservation than
those with Ka/Ks ≥ 0.06 (average dSM of 0.663 and 0.722,
respectively). However, this was mostly due to genes that
were not HK genes (Figure 2, middle row, left), which
explained the apparent contradiction mentioned before.
Among genes with Ka/Ks < 0.06, the average dSM was 0.72 for
HK genes, but 0.65 for non-HK genes. Not surprisingly, we
found that the previously observed correlation between dSM
and Ka/Ks was more relevant in non-HK genes (r = 0.17, p <
10-19) than in HK genes (r = 0.10, p < 0.002).

Cis-regulatory motif content in housekeeping gene
promoters
The differences in promoter sequence divergence associated
with expression tissue distribution are likely to reflect the
presence of different functional regulatory motifs in genes
with diverse expression patterns. Among the expression
groups previously defined (restricted, intermediate and HK)
only the HK gene group probably represents a rather homogeneous class from a gene expression regulatory perspective.
Other groups include genes that are active in diverse tissues
and that are likely to be regulated by very different factors. We
thus investigated whether the promoters of HK genes were
enriched in specific transcription factor binding motifs.
In the first place, we mapped all experimentally verified transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) from TRANSFAC [26]
in the human and mouse promoter sequences. We observed
that approximately 75% of mapped TFBSs fell into conserved
regions, which only occupy approximately 30% of the
sequence analyzed. However, as only less than 2% of the
genes in the dataset contained known TFBSs, we could not
infer any statistically significant biases from these data. For
this reason, we decided to use motifs predicted by weight
matrices representing known TFBSs. We performed separate
analysis with the vertebrate TFBS weight matrix collections
available from TRANSFAC and PROMO [27]. We identified
nine motifs that were consistently over-represented in the
aligned parts of HK gene promoters using the two weight
matrix datasets (χ2 test, p < 10-5; Table 3). The motifs were
recognized by particular transcription factors or families of
transcription factors, according to data in TRANSFAC and
PROMO. Among them were commonly found regulators such
as Sp1, or members of the ATF (activating transcription factor) family. We also analyzed HK motif over-representation
separately in aligned regions located either downstream or

interactions

The existence of a positive correlation between the speed of
evolution of regulatory sequences and that of coding
sequences in orthologous genes is suggestive of a link
between rapid diversification of a protein and its expression
pattern. We have found that in mammals there is a weak but
significant correlation between these two factors, in accordance with previous observations in nematodes [11] and yeast

refereed research

In this work we present the first evidence, at least to our
knowledge, of a relationship between promoter sequence
divergence and gene expression breadth. We have observed
that the promoters of HK genes tend to be less conserved than
those of non-HK genes, especially in the distal promoter
region, upstream of position -500. Given the strong conservation of HK gene expression patterns across organisms [28],
high promoter sequence divergence is likely to reflect weak
functional constraints rather than sequence diversification
driven by the acquisition of new functionalities. These observations raise the interesting possibility that HK genes have
shorter functional promoters. Interestingly, other features of
HK genes tend to shortness; in particular, they have been
described to have shorter coding, intronic, and intergenic
sequences [29-31]. As a consequence, and with the exception
of plants [32], transcripts of HK genes tend to be short. One
hypothesis put forward to explain this observation is selection
for economy in transcription and translation [30,31]. An
alternative hypothesis, called 'genome design', is that tissuespecific genes require a greater amount of non-coding DNA

In mammals, conservation of a gene's upstream sequence is
related to the function of the encoded protein [8,9]. Iwama
and Gojobori [9] found that genes encoding transcription factors and developmental proteins showed high gene upstream
sequence conservation. Similarly, Lee et al. [8] showed that
genes involved in complex and adaptative processes, such as
development, cell communication, neural function, and signaling, were associated with higher promoter sequence conservation despite their relative recent emergence during
evolution. On the contrary, genes involved in basic processes,
such as metabolism and ribosomal function, contained poorly
conserved promoters. Our study is consistent with these findings, as the former genes are under-represented in HK genes,
while the later are over-represented. However, by directly
relating promoter conservation to mode of expression, we are
able to propose a more direct explanation for the differences
in promoter sequence conservation between genes that perform basic housekeeping functions, and which are simply regulated, and genes that are important for tissue- or organspecific processes, which may require a more complex regulation. In addition, function alone cannot explain the differences across genes, as the reduced promoter sequence
conservation in HK genes with respect to non-HK genes is
essentially maintained within different functional (GO)
classes.

Discussion

due to their more complex regulation [29]. Our results show
that HK genes contain more divergent distal promoter
sequences than non-HK genes. In line with the 'genome
design' hypothesis, this may be due to their relatively simple
expression patterns, requiring less regulatory sequences.

reports

upstream of position -500. Whereas in the region from the
TSS to -500 the nine distinct motifs became even more
strongly over-represented than in the 2 Kb promoter, in the
more distal promoter region, upstream of -500, four of the
motifs - ATF, CREB, NRF1/2 and USF - were no longer significant. We next determined the expression class of the transcription factors that could bind to the nine motif types, using
the previously defined three expression groups. Importantly,
all transcription factors showed HK or intermediate expression patterns (Table 3), and none showed tissue-restricted
expression, which is consistent with a putative role in the regulation of HK genes. Therefore, we could define a group of
factors that, mainly through interactions with HK proximal
promoter regions, are likely to play important roles in the
maintenance of adequate levels of expression of this type of
genes.

[12]. Interestingly, we have observed that this relationship is
especially relevant for non-HK genes, while in HK genes the
effect is practically negligible.
The CpG island gene classification and association with
expression breadth observed here is consistent with other
reports [22,24]. The majority of mammalian promoters
contain CpG islands and HK genes are particularly rich in this
type of sequence. Our study shows that promoters that do not
contain CpG islands are more strongly conserved than those
that do, and even more so if the genes encode slowly evolving
proteins. Promoters with no CpG islands correspond to classical TATA-containing promoters and it has been recently
shown in a large-scale analysis that they are particularly wellconserved across different mammalian species [33].
We identify nine different motifs, corresponding to known
transcription factor binding sites, that are significantly overrepresented in HK genes. Most of the transcription factors
that bind to these sites are themselves encoded by HK genes
and the rest are encoded by genes classified as of intermediate
expression breadth. Five of the motifs (binding Sp1, USF,
NRF1, CREB, or ATF) show high frequency peaks in the vicinity of the TSS (-200 to -1) in a large collection of human promoters, and the combination of two of them (binding Sp1 and
NRF1) is over-represented in HK gene promoters [34]. Some
of the motifs identified are bound by known regulators of HK
genes; examples are Sp1 and USF for the APEX nuclease gene
[35] or Sp1 and HIF-1 for the endoglin gene [36].
Of note, besides HK genes, we also find differences between
the groups of genes with restricted expression (1-10 tissues)
and intermediate expression (11-50 tissues). 'Restricted'
genes tend to show higher promoter conservation than 'intermediate' genes (Table 1; Aupplementary Tables S1, S2, and S3
in Additional data file 1). These results may seem counterintuitive, as one could argue that genes expressed in only a
few tissues should have more simple regulation than genes
expressed in an intermediate number of tissues. However,
one possibility is that 'restricted' genes contain a larger
number of negative regulatory elements. Interestingly, gene
reporter assays of promoter activity in ENCODE regions
(approximately 1% of the genome) have shown that negative
elements appear to be present from 1,000 to 500 nucleotides
upstream of the TSS in 55% of genes [37]. This indicates that
motifs for inhibitory transcription factors may be present in a
substantial fraction of genes. One expects that such regions
will be more common in tissue-specific 'restricted' genes,
which would be consistent with the observed stronger distal
promoter sequence conservation.
It has been observed that metazoan-specific proteins tend to
be more tissue-specific than universal eukaryotic proteins
[20]. In other words, HK genes are enriched for proteins of
ancient origin. Old eukaryotic proteins typically evolve more
slowly and are longer than proteins of a more recent origin,

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R140

probably due to increased functional constraints [38]. However, at the level of gene expression regulatory regions they
may be simpler and less constrained than genes that represent innovations in multi-cellular organisms. Cross-species
comparisons will be used in future studies to gain further
insight into these questions.

Conclusion

We describe that genes with housekeeping expression contain
more divergent promoters than genes with a more restricted
tissue expression. Importantly, this property cannot be fully
explained by the functional class of the encoded gene products, or by a higher prevalence of CpG islands in HK gene promoters. In addition, we have identified a number of
transcription factors that are likely to play a predominant role
in the control of HK gene expression. We argue that the lower
promoter conservation observed in HK genes could be due to
a more simple regulation of gene transcription.

Materials and methods
Sequence retrieval and alignment
We identified human and mouse orthologous genes using the
Ensembl database (release 34) [39]. We considered only
orthology relationships of type UBRH (unique best reciprocal
hit): 17,620 records of human genes with orthologous mouse
genes (human-mouse dataset) and 12,868 of mouse genes
with orthologous human genes (mouse-human dataset). We
extracted the promoter sequences from these genes, comprising 2 Kb upstream of the TSS, from the UCSC database (hg17
and mm6 releases) [40], excluding genes with multiple TSSs,
discarding duplicates, and considering only gene pairs with
human-mouse and mouse-human orthology data that were
both available and congruent. The resulting dataset contained 8,972 orthologous promoter sequence pairs. We discarded repeats from alignments using RepeatMasker (release
1.1.65) [41]. We aligned the sequences with the local pairwise
sequence alignment program described in Castillo-Davis et
al. [11], using a minimum alignment length of 16 nucleotides.
For each orthologous pair we obtained the promoter
sequence divergence score (dSM; shared motif divergence),
which is the fraction of the sequence that does not align, taking the average between the human and mouse promoter
sequences. The fraction of sequence aligned was then 1 - dSM.
We calculated the average 1 - dSM in 100 nucleotide sequence
windows overlapping by 20 nucleotides. Failure to align portions of the promoter may be due to very high divergence or
the occurrence of insertions/deletions. To obtain an estimate
of the dSM random expectation we aligned, with the same program, 1,000,000 pairs of 2 Kb random sequences and calculated their dSM scores. We discarded orthologous pairs with
an overall average dSM > 0.97 (random expectation ≥0.01),
obtaining 7,330 orthologous promoter sequence pairs. Coding sequences were extracted from the Ensembl database
(release 34) and aligned with ClustalW [42].

Transcription factor binding site predictions
We used weight matrices from PROMO (release 3) [27,45]
and TRANSFAC (release 7.0) [26] to predict transcription
factor binding sites. Motif searches were carried out with a
similarity cut-off of 0.85. We selected motifs consistently predicted by both matrix collections that were over-represented
in HK genes versus all the genes taken together using the chisquare test.

We used mouse transcriptome microarray data from Zhang et
al. [14] to classify the previously defined genes into different
groups according to their expression in 55 different mouse
organs and tissues (see Supplementary table S5 in Additional
data file 1). Zhang et al. [14] considered genes to be expressed
only if their intensity exceeded the 99th percentile of intensities from the negative controls.

We extracted sequences -100 to +100 with respect to the TSS.
We classified genes as CpG+ (CpG island-positive near TSS),
when the C+G content exceeded 0.55 and the CpG score
(observed CpG/expected CpG) exceeded 0.65 in the -100 to
+100 region, or as CpG- (CpG island-negative near TSS), otherwise. This classification is similar to that used by Yamashita
et al. [22], but with more stringent values for CpG+ determination, in line with the CpG island definition proposed by
Takai and Jones [46]. To study differences in CpG island
sequence conservation between HK and non-HK genes, we
extended the CpG islands upstream, such that the G+C content exceeded 0.55 and the CpG score exceeded 0.65, calculating in this manner the 5' end point of CpG islands.

reports

In addition, we used human gene expression data from Gene
Atlas (GNF1H), based on transcriptome microarray data [18],
and human gene expression data from the eVOC database
(anatomical system and cell type ontologies, release 2.7),
based on expressed sequence tag data [17]. We considered
genes to be expressed in a tissue according to Gene Atlas data
only if the expression level was ≥200. Gene Atlas covers 79
human organs and tissues (see Supplementary table S5 in
Additional data file 1). For eVOC anatomical systems and cell
types we discarded classes with a very small number of genes
(<1,000) or large classes with high redundancy (>90% of
genes shared with other classes). This resulted in 57 anatomical systems and 10 cell types (see Supplementary table S5 in
Additional data file 1). HK, intermediate and restricted
expression groups were defined following similar criteria as
for the mouse transcriptome data.

Synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution
rates were estimated with the codeml program in PAML [13].
From the 7,330 orthologous pairs, 6,698 remained after discarding those with Ka ≥ 0.5, Ks ≥ 2.0, or Kp ≥ 2.0 (saturated
pairs). We estimated, for each gene, the number of nucleotide
substitutions per site in the concatenated promoter sequence
alignment, using the baseml program, with the Hasegawa,
Kishino and Yano (1985) model [43], in PAML. This substitution rate was termed Kp.
