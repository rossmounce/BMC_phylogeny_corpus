Abstract
Background: The MYB superfamily constitutes the most abundant group of transcription factors
described in plants. Members control processes such as epidermal cell differentiation, stomatal
aperture, flavonoid synthesis, cold and drought tolerance and pathogen resistance. No genomewide characterization of this family has been conducted in a woody species such as grapevine. In
addition, previous analysis of the recently released grape genome sequence suggested expansion
events of several gene families involved in wine quality.
Results: We describe and classify 108 members of the grape R2R3 MYB gene subfamily in terms
of their genomic gene structures and similarity to their putative Arabidopsis thaliana orthologues.
Seven gene models were derived and analyzed in terms of gene expression and their DNA binding
domain structures. Despite low overall sequence homology in the C-terminus of all proteins, even
in those with similar functions across Arabidopsis and Vitis, highly conserved motif sequences and
exon lengths were found. The grape epidermal cell fate clade is expanded when compared with the
Arabidopsis and rice MYB subfamilies. Two anthocyanin MYBA related clusters were identified in
chromosomes 2 and 14, one of which includes the previously described grape colour locus. Tannin
related loci were also detected with eight candidate homologues in chromosomes 4, 9 and 11.
Conclusion: This genome wide transcription factor analysis in Vitis suggests that clade-specific
grape R2R3 MYB genes are expanded while other MYB genes could be well conserved compared
to Arabidopsis. MYB gene abundance, homology and orientation within particular loci also suggests
that expanded MYB clades conferring quality attributes of grapes and wines, such as colour and
astringency, could possess redundant, overlapping and cooperative functions.

Background
The MYB superfamily exemplifies how both conserved
and divergent domains are present within a transcription
factor family. MYB genes are exclusive to eukaryotes [1,2]
and although in animals their function is restricted to the

control of the cell division and differentiation [3], they
have diverse functions in plants [4].
MYB genes in plants are modulated by diverse hormones
[5] and participate in key processes related to epidermal

cell destiny [6] (which includes pigmentation [7] and formation of trichomes [8]), seed development [9], response
to drought [10] and cold [11,12], pathogen-disease resistance [13-15] stomatal movements [16,17], phytochrome
A-dependent light-sensing responses [18] and sucrose
related responses [19], among many other functions.
Different MYB families have evolved after duplications of
their DNA binding domains [4]. MYB DNA binding
domains are 100–160 residues in length, depending on
the number of imperfect repeats (named R) in the N-terminal region. From the different classes identified, the
R2R3 subfamily is the most abundant in plants [20-22].
Each repeat adopts a helix-helix-turn-helix structure
which interacts with regulatory elements in the promoter,
while the C-terminal region is responsible for establishing
protein-protein interactions with other components of
the eukaryotic transcriptional machinery. Based on their
well conserved DNA-binding domains, R2R3 MYB genes
have been annotated in both monocotyledonous and
dicotyledonous genomes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, there are
an estimated 126 R2R3 subfamily members [5], although
only some of them have been functionally characterised.
Despite MYB genes have also been identified in woody
species such as poplar, grape and apple, no genome-wide
characterization of this family has been conducted in such
species. In grapes, the MYB genes characterised to date are
all involved in the control of flavonoid synthesis (MYBA
[23], MYB5a (MYBCS-1) [24], MYB5b [25], and MYBPA1
[26]). Since quality parameters in grapes and wines such
as colour, bitterness and astringency are determined by
flavonoid compounds accumulating in fruit tissues, these
studies have focussed on anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin synthesis and their regulation via MYB factors. In
species such as Arabidopsis, petunia and maize, it has been
determined that MYB proteins can act together with
bHLH and WDR proteins in a transcriptional complex
capable of regulating flavonoid synthesis and other processes concerning epidermal cell identity [27,28]. The
affinity of MYB proteins for the DNA binding sites in each
promoter can be influenced by the interaction with these
factors.
The annotated genome sequence of Vitis vinifera has
recently become available [29] after an Italian-French
effort to obtain a highly homozygous Pinot noir
(PN40024) genome [30]. In addition, an Italian consortium sequenced a highly heterozygous Pinot noir genotype (ENTAV115) [31,32]. These two initiatives provided
a genomic platform for studying this fruit crop. To date, its
sequence has been assigned to 19 chromosomes [30] or
linkage groups [32], the same number as in Poplar (Populus trichocarpa) [33]. While the PN40024 genotype is predicted to contain 30,434 genes in 487 Mb (46% of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/83

genome; [30]), the ENTAV115 clone is predicted to have
29,585 genes within 531 Mb [32]. Although some supercontigs are still being correctly assembled and oriented in
each chromosome, the sequence shows that 41.4% of the
genome is composed of transposable elements mostly
located in introns, explaining its high variability and heterozygocity [30]. Paralogous regions in the grape genome
arose by gene duplication and are present in clusters, forcing gene expansion and diversification. The best example
of this event is the terpene synthase gene family, with 30–
40 members in Arabidopsis and almost 90 members in
grape [30]. To date, information regarding expansion
events of the MYB gene superfamily in Vitis is absent.
In this work, we describe the putative R2R3 MYB gene subfamily by means of in silico analysis of the grape genome
sequence, in order to predict protein domain architectures, and to assess the extent of conservation and divergence between grape and Arabidopsis gene families.
Candidate genes were chosen for isolation and their
expressions were tested in different grape organs to compare expression patterns of closely grouping co-orthologues. This extended analysis is the first to be performed
on a dicotyledonous species other than Arabidopsis. Possible gene retention, loss and expansion processes of MYB
genes are discussed.

Results and Discussion
Identification and chromosomal distribution of grape
R2R3 MYB genes
The genome sequence of the homozygous PN40024 genotype of Vitis vinifera cv. Pinot noir [29] was searched for
MYB gene models. These are predicted from combining ab
initio models together with V. vinifera complementary
DNA sequences (from EST databases) and alignments of
gene/protein models from other species [30]. A consensus
R2R3 MYB DNA binding domain sequence (Additional
file 1) was used in a BLATsearch, which maintains an
index of the entire genome in memory and finds
sequences of 20 amino acids or more with 80% or higher
similarity in the genome. The MYB superfamily has been
defined as the most abundant transcription factor family
in plants [34], with at least 198 members in Arabidopsis
and 183 in rice [5]. In grapevine, a total of 279 MYB genes
were previously estimated [32], including members of the
R1R2R3, R2R3, atypical MYB and MYB-related gene subfamilies. The Arabidopsis and rice R2R3 subfamilies are
composed of 126 and 109 members, respectively [5],
while in grape 108 candidate genes were identified in this
study. These were further analysed in terms of their putative protein sequences, exon lengths and their positions
and orientations in each chromosome (Additional file 2).

This analysis revealed that grape MYB genes are distributed in almost all chromosomes, except for chromosome

(<100 bp – >1000 bp). Presence of a fourth and fifth exon
is exclusive to some particular genes. Despite this variability, the modal lengths of the first two exons are very similar (exon 1, 133 bp; exon 2, 130 bp) and highly conserved
(exon 1, 38.7% occurrence; exon 2, 63.2% occurrence).
These occurrence values are very similar in Arabidopsis,
suggesting that MYB DNA binding domains could be partially conserved because exons coding for this domain
have restricted lengths during the evolution of plant species. It is interesting to note that the exon lengths observed
for the R2R3 MYB subfamily coincide with the average
exon length predicted from models of other grape gene
families (130 bp, [30]).
Although exon 3 is the most diverse in size, MYB subfamilies from both species are similarly distributed when
the first three exon lengths are considered (Figure 2B).
Exon 3 codes for the last region of the R3 repeat and for
the C-region of the protein. Changes both in length and
sequence of this exon could have generated functional
divergence between MYB homologues within and
between species, leading to different functional motifs
and domains [35].

chromosome MYB abundances were obtained from TAIR.

(chr) 10 (Figure 1). However, thirteen MYB gene models
have not yet been assigned to a particular chromosome
and it is possible that some of them are positioned in
chr10. Chromosomes with more abundant MYB gene
models are 1, 3 and 5 in Arabidopsis and 2, 4 and 14 in the
Vitis genome. These were subsequently analysed for gene
cluster expansion events.
Exon/intron organisation of Vitis and Arabidopsis MYB
families
Exon structures are highly conserved when the grape and
Arabidopsis R2R3 MYB subfamilies are compared (Figures
2 and 3). Exons 1 and 2 code for almost the entire R2R3
DNA binding domain, although this pattern differs in
complex multiexonic genes (e.g. AtMYB88 and 124). As
shown in Figure 2A, exon 1 appears to be the most
restricted in length, while exons 2 and 3 are more variable

In order to gain further insights into exon conservation,
the split positions of the R2R3 repeats within the DNA
binding domain were classified in the grape and Arabidopsis gene models (Figure 3; note that this classification does
not consider the final number of exons). It is possible to
distinguish four groups in Arabidopsis, the first three of
which are also present in grape (Figure 3A). All groups differ in the organisation of exons determining the R2R3
domain. In general, the R2R3 domain consists of 106
amino acids. The N-terminal region before this domain
may vary within each group. Groups I and II have their R2
repeat split between exons 1 and 2, but in Group I, the R3
repeat is divided between exons 2 and 3 (Figure 3B; note
that the last exon in Groups I, II and III may have additional introns depending on the gene). In Group III, the
first exon codes the complete R2 repeat but R3 is split
between in exons 1 and 2. Group IV consists only of 1
exon coding for the complete MYB protein: members of
this group have not been identified to date in grapes.
AtMYB88 and AtMYB124 are not included in any group of
the Arabidopsis plot because of their more complex exon/
intron organization (10–11 exons, respectively).
Seven Arabidopsis MYB genes and the grape gene model
GSVIVT16947001 could not be positioned in these
groups. Together with MYB118 and 106, all share a longer
N-terminal region before the start of the R2 repeat
(between 52 and 213 residues). Regarding their exon
boundaries, the R2 and R3 repeats are organised differently and can not be classified by these means. The other
Arabidopsis MYBs and their grape gene homologues are

maintained in the same respective groups. Despite the
occurrence of different duplication and diversification
events in these two species, MYB exons are highly conserved. Length and sequence restrictions in the first two
exons could help maintain functionality and achieve
sequence specificity of the R2R3 domain, while variations
in the exons coding for the C-terminal regions could facilitate the gaining of new or cooperative functions when
new domains are included.

Updated functional clustering of the Arabidopsis R2R3 MYB
Subfamily
Taking the complete Arabidopsis R2R3 MYB subfamily
(126 members, Additional file 3), a phylogenetic tree was
constructed to update new functional clades which could
also be present in the grape subfamily (Figure 4). Most
genes sharing similar functions were clustered in the same
phylogenetic clades and subclades (functional clades),
suggesting that most closely-related MYBs in the same species could recognise similar target genes and possess
redundant, overlapping, and/or cooperative functions.

Integrated evolutionary relationships of the 126 Arabidopsis R2R3 MYB proteins

was inferred by Neighbour-Joining method and 1000 bootstraps using Mega4 software. Each functional clade is highlighted. References for MYB gene functions are also shown in Additional file 3.

The resulting tree is validated as it shows the same subgroups (1–17) observed in phylogenetic trees constructed
by Kranz et al [36] and Yanhui et al [5]. New functions
have been recently identified, including MYBs involved in
glucosinolate biosynthesis [37-41] and hormone induced
responses. These new functions are also clustered within
this phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4), although a particularly polyphyletic feature within this Subfamily is
observed: flower development. Flower organs were conceived as an adaptive process late in plant evolution. Several mechanisms involving cell cycle regulation,
secondary metabolite accumulation and hormonal control have been related to reproductive male organ development. MYB genes regulating these events have been
recently identified (AtMYB103 [42,43], AtMYB26 [44],
AtMYB24 [45], AtMYB21 [46], AtMYB32 [47] and

AtMYB101, AtMYB65 and AtMYB33 [48,49]). Although
they cluster in different clades within the MYB subfamily
and their target genes seem to be different, all ultimately
regulate anther development.
The R2R3 domain provides both the MYB nuclear localisation signals [50] and regulatory specificity [51]. C-terminal regions often possess protein-protein interaction or
DNA-repression motifs. Such is the case of the C2 motif
repressor clade. Members of this group possess the C1 and
C2 motifs, known to participate in bHLH interactions
[52] and promoter repression, respectively (e.g. CH4 promoter for AtMYB4; [52] and RD29A promoter for
AtMYB8; [12]).

Among flavonoids, flavonols are known to have functions
such as filtering UV radiation and auxin retention and
transport (reviewed in [53]). They also have pharmaceutical properties when consumed by animals. Recently, their
synthesis has been shown to be regulated by three closely
related MYBs (AtMYB11, 12 and 111 [53]). These MYBs
are found together in the 'production of flavonol glycosides' clade (Figure 4) and act at different times and tissues
throughout plant development [53]. This new clade
appears to share an ancestral MYB gene both with the 'C2repressor motif' clade and the 'epidermal cell fate' clade
(which includes the anthocyanin and trichome related
subclades). These clades regulate different processes but
share up to some extent the control of phenolic compound synthesis.
Phylogenetic analysis of the grape R2R3 MYB Subfamily
The same alignment protein weight matrices and phylogeny algorithms used for the construction of the Arabidopsis
tree were employed for the integrated analysis of the Arabidopsis, rice and Vitis MYB subfamilies (Additional files 4
and 5). Grape protein models with a complete R2R3
domain (91 sequences), seven characterised grape proteins and 126 Arabidopsis homologues were included in
the first phylogeny. The remaining grape models generally
possessed an incomplete R2 repeat, so were not included
in this analysis.

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis using
both the single R2R3 DNA-binding domain and the full
predicted protein sequences were produced (Additional
file 4A and 4B, respectively). Outside the DNA binding
domain, MYB proteins had the greatest sequence divergence. Although a full sequence alignment could be
highly sensitive to the dissimilarities in the C-terminal
regions outside the conserved motifs, both trees are
extremely similar regarding topology and bootstrap values. Possible orthologues between both species appear
outside and inside the functional clades previously
described for Arabidopsis (Additional files 4 and 5).
In some cases, it was easy to identify two putative orthologues in Arabidopsis and Vitis, since they were grouped in
pairs within a clade. In other situations, grape and Arabidopsis homologues were clustered by species within a
clade (e.g. proteins from the C2-repressor motif clade,
with the exception of MYB4). Their functional characterisation will help prove which genes are orthologues within
each clade.
None of the grape gene models were grouped within the
Arabidopsis 'glucosinolate' clade (Additional file 4). Several lines of evidence suggests that this clade resulted from
a β-type duplication [5] which evolved independently in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/83

the order Brassicales as an adaptive response to herbivory
[54,55], explaining its absence in rice and grape.
For several transcription factor families, linear correlations of abundance have been identified in Arabidopsis
and Vitis [32]. In Arabidopsis, the MYB superfamily consists of 198 R1R2R3, R2R3, MYB related and atypical MYB
genes [5], in contrast to the 279 estimated MYB superfamily members in Vitis. In addition, because of the anatomical and physiological differences between grapes and
Arabidopsis, it can be suggested that some clades could be
differentially expanded when comparing Arabidopsis and
Vitis R2R3 subfamilies. Both inside and outside of some of
these functional clades, grape gene expansions were
observed as gene pairs or clusters (highlighted with asterisks in Additional file 4). Such is the case of the Vitis-specific MYB5a and MYB5b, the MYB4 gene pair within the
C2-repressor motif clade, MYB101 ('GAMYB like/miRNA
regulated' clade) and MYB 38/RAX1 ('axillary meristem'
clade). Outside the functional clades, expanded MYBs are
represented by dichotomous pairs of grape MYB15, 17,
35, 67 and 102 homologues, whose functions have yet to
be determined. In the case of the 'production of flavonol
glycosides' clade, one member (possibly MYB11) may be
absent in grape. This could be a result of the loss of a clade
member or a mis-annotation of the Vitis genome. It is possible that new R2R3 MYB genes could be identified in the
future as annotations improve. For instance, AtMYB88
and AtMYB124 grape homologues, which belong to the
'guard cell division restriction' clade, have yet to be found,
possibly because their complex exon/intron structure
(10–11 exons) makes them difficult to identify during an
annotation procedure.
Expansion of grape MYB genes affecting wine quality
parameters
After the sequencing of the grapevine genome, the expansion of large gene families involved in wine characteristics
was observed [30]. Such was the case of the Stilbene Synthase Family, responsible for the synthesis of the phytoalexin resveratrol, and the Terpene Synthase Family,
involved in aroma production. Other studies have also
revealed that genes belonging to terpene and flavonoid
metabolic pathways have suffered selective amplifications
in the grape genome, in contrast to other plant genomes
[32]. If this situation is evident for some biosynthetic
genes of the grape phenylpropanoid pathway (PAL, CHS,
F3H, F3'5'H, FLS and LAR), it is reasonable to expect that
MYB genes controlling this pathway could also be
expanded. Nevertheless, it is also possible to suggest that
these genes were maintained in the grapevine genome by
means of human domestication, and lost in other plant
genomes. For example, many genes were lost in Arabidopsis after its two wide genome duplication (WGD) events
[56].

Two different scenarios have been described regarding
possible WGD episodes in grape: the first states there is no
evidence for such event [30], while in the second, a recent
WGD event might have occurred in close proximity to the
Vitis speciation event [32]. In our analysis we observed
that MYB genes from the 'epidermal cell fate' clade
involved in the synthesis of molecules which confer quality to grapes and wines are largely expanded in the Vitis
genome.
Grape and wine colour is defined by glycosylated
anthocyanins. Any perturbation in their cytoplasmic synthesis, conjugation or vacuole transport thus directly
affects berry colour. Several MYB genes have been characterised in Arabidopsis, maize, petunia, antirrhinum, and
apple, which regulate some of the processes concerning
anthocyanin production. It was discovered that white
grapes arose from multiallelic mutations of the VvMYBA1/
A2 genes [57-60], which controls the last biosynthetic step
of anthocyanin synthesis, a glycosylation reaction mediated by the UDP-GLUCOSE FLAVONOID 3-O-GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE (UFGT) enzyme [23].
The Vitis-Arabidopsis phylogenetic tree shows that there are
nine anthocyanin-related MYB gene models distributed
on chromosomes 2 and 14 from grape, the most abundant MYB-containing chromosomes (Figure 5A). An additional gene model (GSVIVT 9898001) has yet to be linked
to a specific chromosome. Recently, a grape colour locus
was described [60], which we now localised on chromosome 2. In the previous study, four R2R3 MYB genes were
found at this locus, but only two (VvMYBA1 and
VvMYBA2) had a regulatory effect on fruit colour. These
proteins differ in the lengths of their C-regions: MYBA2
has a duplicated C-terminal repeat when compared to
MYBA1, while MYBA3 almost completely lacks this
region. These differences could cause novel or cooperative
functions, and it has been suggested that VvMYBA3 could
control anthocyanin synthesis in grape tissues other than
the fruits [60]. In addition to the VvMYBA1-3 genes, three
other R2R3 MYB gene models were detected in the grape
colour locus located on chromosome 2 (Figure 5B,
between 12 and 13 Mb. Note that MYBA1 was annotated
as two contiguous gene models: GSVIVT38763001 and
38762001).
Chromosome 14 contains three anthocyanin related
MYBs, some of them being predicted as possible orthologues of the Arabidopsis anthocyanin-related AtMYB75
and AtMYB90 proteins (Figure 5A). Further experiments
are required to determine whether these genes are functional, in order to verify if this new locus influences the
colouring of fruits or other plant organs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/83

In concordance with the Arabidopsis chromosomal duplications classified by Bowers et al [61], MYB gene evolution is though to involve segmental duplications [5]. The
Arabidopsis
'anthocyanin-related' subclade, which
includes AtMYB75, 90 [62], 113 and 114 [63] (all positioned on chromosome 1), was described as a cluster
which may have arise by tandem duplications (see Supplementary material in [5]). The anthocyanin and trichome-related subclades within the Arabidopsis 'epidermal
cell fate' clade may have experienced a major rapid expansion after diverging from monocots but before separating
from other dicots [5]. Supporting this hypothesis is the
finding that these two clusters are absent in the rice subfamily (Additional file 5). Considering the homology and
orientation of the nine anthocyanin related MYBs found
in the two grape loci, it is possible that some of the original MYBs could have undergone new multiple tandem
duplication events somewhere before or after the separation of the Arabidopsis-Vitis lineages. However, if this event
occurred before lineage separation, this second expansion
has clearly been lost during the subsequent evolution of
the Arabidopsis genome.
Seed pigmentation is defined by the accumulation and
oxidation of flavan-3-ols, which are transported in the
same way as anthocyanins, but are additionally polymerised into proanthocyanidins (PA) and condensed tannins
inside vacuoles (reviewed in [64]). In wines, these molecules define astringency and bitterness. AtMYB123 (also
known as TT2) controls the final steps of PA synthesis [7].
Our analysis suggests that grapevine possesses several
putative TT2 orthologues (Figure 5A), many of which are
more closely related to TT2 than the previously characterised MYB5a, MYB5b and MYBPA1. These genes control PA
synthesis and also regulate other biosynthetic genes of the
flavonoid pathway [24-26]. Chromosomes 4, 9 and 11
possess four, one and two grape TT2 homologue genes,
respectively. MYBPA1/GSVIVT00006679001 and MYB5a/
b are shown as dichotomous pairs. Taken together, MYBs
related to PA synthesis also appear expanded. The fact that
in Lotus japonicus the TT2 lineage compromises a threemember subclade [65], addresses the question whether
this expansion is exclusive to grape. When including the
rice MYB subfamily into this analysis, only two models
appeared as putative TT2 orthologues (Additional file 5),
indicating that grape has substantially more TT2 loci than
other species characterised to date.
The observed new expansion events are specific to the
anthocyanin related subclade and the TT2 related lineage
in grapevine, but not to the trichome subclade. Both the
grapevine adaptive responses (because of the adaptative
functions of flavonoids) and human breeding and domestication practices could have helped in the selection of

MYB gene expression profiles in different grape organs and during different stages of inflorescence and berry skin development
MYB gene expression profiles in different grape organs and during different stages of inflorescence and berry
skin development. Veraison corresponds to the onset of ripening, when clusters are 30–50% coloured and sugar concentration reaches 5° Brix (5% w/w soluble solids). Standard deviations (SD) are the result of three independent replicates. Weeks

colour and astringency.

cDNA sequences were 95–100% similar to their respective
gene models (annotated from cv. Pinot noir).

Selection of grape gene models for expression analysis and
modelling of their DNA binding domains
In order to test the annotation procedure and validate
gene models, six annotated genes were randomly selected,
isolated and their expression patterns were screened in
different grapevine organs. VvMYB4 (Genbank accession
EF113078), a AtMYB4 repressor orthologue recently characterised in our group was also included. Complete coding regions of VvMYB12-like, 14-like, 24-like, 30-like, 60like and a C2motif containing repressor-like gene were
isolated from different organs of cv. Cabernet-Sauvignon
by RT-PCR (Genbank accessions in Additional file 6). The

Although some Arabidopsis MYBs have yet to be functionally characterised, global gene expression data throughout
plant development is available on the Arabidopsis Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph (eFP) Browser [66,67]. All
selected grape MYB genes are highly expressed in reproductive organs and revealed organ-expression profiles
remarkably similar to their putative Arabidopsis orthologues (Figure 6 and Additional file 7). In addition,
VvMYB24 and 14-like genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in ripped berries/inflorescences and seeds,
respectively, in a similar way as in Arabidopsis. Subsequent

experiments are needed to examine the precise function of
these putative orthologies.
A comparative modelling approach (SWISSMODEL)
using crystallised mammalian c-MYB (1GV2.PDB) as the
structural template was conducted in order to study DNA
binding domains from the previously selected MYBs. The
in silico 3D model of these R2R3 domains suggest significant structural homology with rat R1R2R3 c-MYB (Additional file 8). Structural studies of the mammalian c-MYB
factor show that its DNA binding domain requires several
trypthophan residues which participate in the hydrophobic grouping within the DNA-protein interaction interface
[68]. These residues are maintained in the grape homologues (as displayed in asterisks in Additional file 8A).
Some subtle differences between the animal and plant
MYBs are also present. Animal MYB domains have a single
cysteine residue that needs to be reduced for DNA binding
and transcriptional activity [69], contrary to most plant
R2R3 MYB domains (including grapes) which contain
two cysteines (Additional file 8A,C). Under non-reducing
conditions, these cysteines form a disulfide bond preventing DNA binding [69]. The second cysteine residue, conserved in both animals and plants, is essential for
regulatory activity in animals. Comparatively, the first
cysteine, present only in plants, is crucial for MYB function, demonstrating structural and functional differences
between plants and animals that could influence the
dynamics of the protein-DNA interaction. The residues
surrounding these cysteines are highly similar in the grape
MYB domains analysed, further suggesting the importance of their conservation.
Turns between the α2 and α3 helices in each repeat (Additional file 8B, middle and right panels) are essential for
conferring globular-like structures (Additional file 8C).
Grape R2R3 MYB domains are mostly conserved in the
DNA-interacting R2α3, R3α1 and R3α2 helices and turns,
as well as in their charge. The most distinct domains in
terms of general architecture and positive net charge (yellow regions in each of the structures) were those from
VvMYB4 and VvMYBC2 repressor-like proteins, possibly
due to their mechanism of action; it has been postulated
that MYB repressors affect other MYBs in their binding by
either protein-protein interactions or as dominant negative factors [70].

Conclusion
The sequencing of the grape genome constituted a powerful tool for gene search and evolution studies. Many protein families have been studied in terms of genome
conservation across species, in order to establish a
genome evolution scenario regarding duplication events
and functional diversification. As an example, exon-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/83

intron boundaries, expression patterns and regulatory elements in plant D-type cyclin promoters were found to be
strongly conserved between Arabidopsis and poplar
genomes [71]. The identification of grape MYB genes and
their comparative analysis with the Arabidopsis genome
suggests strong conservation but also expansions of particular functional clades. Despite recent events of diversification, the exon/intron organisation of MYB genes is highly
conserved, suggesting restrictions in R2R3 domain variations while allowing C-terminal modifications for gaining
new or cooperative functions.
The identification of MYB genes in grapevine opens the
possibility of modulating MYB gene expression in order to
control specific aspects of grape physiology and development. In particular, genes involved in flower and seed
development or in flavonoid synthesis might be interesting targets for functional characterisation in light of
expression similarities in Arabidopsis and their possible
duplication histories.

Methods
Search for MYB homologues in the Grape Genome and
Isolation of Candidate genes
The consensus MYB R2R3 DNA binding domain
sequence, obtained from the alignment of previously-isolated and characterised genes from Vitis vinifera and Arabidopsis (Additional file 1), was used in a BLATsearch to
identify homologous gene models in the Grape Genome
Browser, designed by Genoscope (the French National
Sequencing Center [29]). The results obtained were compared to tentative consensus (TC) sequences available at
the Grape TIGR Gene Index EST-database.
Phylogeny reconstruction and bootstrap analysis
To place the obtained sequences in a phylogenetic context, a phylogeny reconstruction was performed with the
single DNA-binding domain and full predicted amino
acid sequences of grape MYB genes and then integrated in
the Arabidopsis phylogenetic tree. Alignments were performed using the BLOSUM matrix (Gap opening and
extension penalties of 25 and 1, respectively) using the
ClustalW algorithm-based AlignX module from Mega4
software [72]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed
using the Neighbour Joining Tree Method in Mega4 and
confirmed with Mega3. Tree nodes were evaluated by
bootstrap analysis for 1000 or 2000 replicates. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated
from the dataset (Complete deletion option in Mega4
software). Evolutionary distances were computed using
the Poisson correction method and are represented as
amino acid substitutions per site. Sequences of all 126
Arabidopsis R2R3 MYB proteins were downloaded from
the TAIR Arabidopsis genome annotation version 7.0,
released on April 2007.

Plant materials, RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Seven MYB candidate genes were isolated from different
cDNAs using specific primers (Additional file 7). Different
vegetative and reproductive tissues were collected from
grapevine plants (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet-Sauvignon)
growing in commercial fields in central Chile. Total RNA
was isolated according to the procedure of Reid et al [73],
using a CTAB-spermidine extraction buffer. For cDNA
synthesis, one μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed
with random hexamer primers in an 18 μl reaction mixture using the StrataScript® reverse transcriptase (Statagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Standard PCR profiles (35 cycles of 30 sec. at 95°C for
denaturing, 30 sec. at 57°C for annealing and 1 min at
72°C for extension) were used to amplify MYB genes.
Amplified fragments were cloned in TOPO-SD cloning
vector (Invitrogen, USA), checked for insertion by PCR
amplification and sequenced.
Expression of grape MYB genes in grape organs
Relative transcript quantification of MYB genes was
achieved by real time RT-PCR, using the Brilliant® SYBR®
Green QPCR Master Reagent Kit (Stratagene) and the
Mx3000P detection system (Stratagene) as described in
the manufacturer's manual. PCR conditions, standard
quantification curves for each gene and relative gene
expression calculations were conducted according to [74].
Amplification of the UBIQUITIN1 gene (99 bp; TC53702,
TIGR database, VvGi5) was used for normalisation. The
ratio between the gene of interest (GOI) and UBIQUITIN
expression was calculated using the equation [1]:
(1+ E GOI ) −ΔCt
(1+ E GOI ) −(Ct GOI − Ct GOI calibrated)
=
−(Ct Ubi − Ct Ubi calibrated)
−ΔCt (1+ E
(1+ E Ubiquitin )
Ubiquitin )

(1)
where E corresponds to each primer amplification efficiency value. Gene expression levels were normalised to
that of the organ sample with the lowest expression in
order to obtain a calibrated ΔCt for each gene.
Comparative modelling of grape R2R3 MYB DNA binding
domain structures
Using the Ratus sp. c-MYB crystal structure (1GV2.pdb) as
a template, grape MYB structures were produced by
SWISSMODEL [75] and viewed using 3D Molecule
Viewer. Charge distributions were analysed in each structure generated.
