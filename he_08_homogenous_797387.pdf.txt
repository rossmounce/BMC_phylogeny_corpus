Abstract
Background: China, with around 30 unique breeds, has a diverse duck genetic pool. Currently,
there is no systematic report which investigates the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship, and
matrilineal genetic structure of these domestic breeds and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).
Results: In this study, we sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region segments
in 278 domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) from 19 indigenous breeds/populations and
70 wild mallard samples and analyzed them together with the 101 control region sequences from
published sources. Fifty-two samples were then sequenced for a cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene
fragment to solidify the pattern emerged from the control region sequences. All domestic duck and
wild mallard haplotypes were essentially indistinguishable and were clustered together in the
phylogenetic tree. There was no geographic differentiation and breed/population-specific
distribution of duck lineages.
Conclusion: Our results showed that unlike other domesticated farm animals in China such as
chicken, cattle, goat, and yak with multiple matrilineal components, the matrilineal pool of Chinese
ducks was homogenous.

Background
Domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) play a key
role in the agricultural and economic sectors of Asia.
There are numerous domestic duck breeds in China
including 27 indigenous breeds, two introduced breeds,
and a few developing breeds according to the 2004 systematic field investigation [1]. About 70% of the recorded
breeds are distributed along the mid to downstream
regions of the Yangtze and Pearl rivers, as well as, in the
coastal districts [1]. With the increasing demand for duck
products, including meat, eggs, and down feathers, the

duck breeding industry has flourished in China. In comparison to other domestic animals in China, the present
conservation situation for local duck genetic resources is
above average. Despite this, the overall population size of
eight renowned breeds (Beijing duck, Youxian Sheldrake,
Liancheng white duck, Jianchang duck, Jinding duck,
Shaoxing duck, Putian black duck, and Gaoyou duck) has
seen a sharp decline during the last decade. Fortunately,
these local breeds are included in the National Genetic
Resources Protection list http://www.agri.gov.cn/blgg/
t20060609_626418.htm which ensures essential meas-

urements are in place to sustainably manage these genetic
resources.
The domestic duck is thought to have been domesticated
independently from the wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos),
see a review by Li et al. [2]. A recent study of the mtDNA
D-loop sequence variation among nine duck breeds along
the Yangtze-Huai River also suggested a single matrilineal
origin from the wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) [3].
However, comparisons of mtDNA polymorphisms
among two local domestic ducks, the wild mallard and
one wild spot-billed duck (Anas zonorhyncha), using RFLP
(restriction fragment length polymorphism) showed that
both wild duck species contributed to the gene pool of
domestic ducks in Fujian Province, Southeast China [4].
Analysis of the nuclear DNA sequence variation in representative Chinese duck breeds, wild mallard, and spotbilled duck by RAPD (random-amplified polymorphic
DNA) [5], AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) [6] and SSR (simple sequence repeat, microsatellite) markers [7] further supported this notion. Based on
the archaeological assemblages, Xie proposed that Chinese native ducks were domesticated in the middle and
lower region of the Yangtze River more than 2,000 years
ago [8]. After the initial domestication in China, the Chinese domestic ducks were subsequently introduced into
Japan via Taiwan [9].
Overall, molecular studies investigating the duck breeds
and populations in China are limited, focusing primarily
on blood protein polymorphisms [10-12], random
amplified polymorphic DNA [5,13], and microsatellite
markers [7,14-17]. Much of the research is overshadowed
by the superficiality of the research work (especially those
published in Chinese) and the limited breeds and populations investigated. mtDNA sequence variation has been
used extensively to study the genetic structure and matrilineal origin of farm animals [18-28]. However, mtDNA
reports about domestic duck and wild mallard are relatively sparse [3,9,29,30]. In this study, we analysed the
genetic diversity and phylogeographic profiles of 374
specimens from 26 Chinese domestic duck breeds/populations and five Thailand native duck samples based on
mtDNA sequence variation. To better understand the matrilineal origin of domestic ducks in China, we also
sequenced 70 individuals from three wild mallard populations and compared them with the domestic samples.
Our results revealed that the Chinese native duck gene
pool is homogeneous, without clear geographic differentiation of the regional breed/population pools.

Results
mtDNA control region and Cyt b sequence variation
A total of 449 domestic duck and wild mallard samples
were analyzed in this study (Table 1 and Figure 1). Among

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/298

these samples, 374 individuals were from 26 Chinese
domestic duck breeds/populations (including 96 reported
sequences, which were shared by 22 haplotypes with GenBank
accession
numbers
EF126702–EF126706,
EF126711–EF126718,
EF126721,
EF126708,
EF126723–EF126728, EF126731), five domestic duck
samples (Anas platyrhynchos) were from Thailand (GenBank accession nos. EU013948–EU013952), and 70 individuals were from three wild mallard populations in
China. Forty-one haplotypes were identified and were
defined by 30 polymorphic sites in the 481 bp fragment
(Additional file 1). Among these haplotypes, H6 was predominant and occurred in 282 samples from all 30
breeds/populations; haplotypes H22, H1, and H5 were
distributed in 32, 21, and 12 individuals, respectively.
Nineteen haplotypes were shared by two to ten samples,
while the remaining eighteen haplotypes were found in
only a single individual. The five Thailand native ducks
shared the most common haplotype H6. Haplotype H14,
a one-step mutation derive of haplotype H6, was only
found in three wild mallard samples, whereas the other
wild mallard samples shared haplotypes with the domestic samples. The detailed haplotype distribution pattern
among different breeds/populations is shown in Additional file 2.
Based on the haplotype distribution pattern of the
mtDNA control region sequences, we further selected 52
samples and analyzed a Cyt b fragment (Table 1), to solidify the pattern emerged from the control region
sequences. Three haplotypes (defined by two variable sites
15274 A>T and 15574 A>G) were discerned in 52 Cyt b
sequences analyzed in this study. Specifically, variant
A15274T was detected in four Jianchang ducks and one
Jinding duck and caused an amino acid change from Leucine to Phenylalanine. Variant A15574G was synonymous
and appeared in one Jinding duck.
Phylogenetic profile of domestic ducks
In the rooted neighbour-joining (NJ) tree based on the
mtDNA control region haplotypes, all domestic duck and
wild mallard samples were clustered together, whereas the
spot-billed ducks formed another cluster (Figure 2). The
wild mallard samples were intermingled with the domestic samples. There was no breed/population-specific clustering pattern. The network based on the mtDNA control
region haplotypes revealed similar pattern as the NJ tree,
with no essential distinction between the wild and
domestic samples (Figure 3). Moreover, the network presented a star-like profile, consistent with a pattern of population expansion in the past. Twenty-three haplotypes
differed from haplotype H6 by one mutation, and the
remaining 17 haplotypes diverged from H6 by no more
than three-mutation distance (Figure 3). The 70 wild mallard samples shared the predominant haplotype and eight

other haplotypes with the domestic samples. The paucity
of sequence variation in the Cyt b sequences was consistent with the less resolved tree based on the mtDNA control region sequences. We did not perform phylogenetic
analysis for Cyt b sequences due to the lack of sequence
variation.
Genetic diversity of duck breeds
Among the 30 duck breeds/populations analyzed in this
study, the genetic diversity of each population/breed var-

ied substantially (Table 1). Only one haplotype was
detected in each sample of the crossbred populations of
the Cherry Valley duck, the Gaoyou duck (CT), the Zhenyi
duck and the Gaoyou duck (BY), as well as, the Thailand
domestic duck (TH). The Jingjiang Sheldrake (JJ) had the
highest haplotype diversity, while the Beijing duck (BD)
had the highest nucleotide diversity. The haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity in all the domestic ducks was
0.619 ± 0.029 and 0.00218 ± 0.00016, respectively, which
was higher than those of the wild mallard (haplotype

diversity, 0.461 ± 0.072; nucleotide diversity, 0.00190 ±
0.00036). The average haplotype diversity and nucleotide
diversity in all 449 samples was 0.598 ± 0.027 and
0.00217 ± 0.00015, respectively. The small sample size of
some breeds/populations and their unique breeding histories may account for the high variability of genetic diversity (Table 1). In addition, potentially biased sampling,
e.g. from one cultured population that is hard to avoid the
potentially close affinity of individuals, could reduce the
haplotype and nucleotide diversities.
Population demographic history
We performed the Fs test of Fu [31] and the mismatch distribution analysis [32] to estimate the demographic history of duck. A statistically significant rejection of the
neutrality hypothesis revealed by the Fs test [31] and a
unimodal or Poisson-like mismatch distribution [32]
would characterize a population expansion in the past. In

contrast, a population with a constant size in the past
would have a multimodal mismatch distribution and
insignificant Fs test result [31,32]. As shown in Table 2,
the Fs tests [31] for the domestic duck samples, wild mallard samples, and the total samples were all statistically
significant (P < 0.05). The mismatch distributions for all
samples (including domestic ducks and wild mallards)
showed a (biased) unimodal shape (Figure 4). Similar distribution shape was detected for the domestic ducks.
However, the wild mallard samples showed a seemingly
bumpy mismatch distribution, which was characteristic of
a population in equilibrium [32] and was consistent with
an explanation for population fragmentation if it was not
caused by the small sample size [33] or other demographic effects. Combined with the star-like shape of the
network profile (Figure 3), we speculated that the domestic duck in China might have undergone population
expansion in the past.

the wild mallards, while the white represents the domestic ducks. Circle area is proportional to haplotype frequency.
To further compare the results with other farm animals in
China, we estimated the mismatch distributions for animals, such as domestic yak, goat, cattle, and chicken (Figure 5). All these farm animals showed multimodal
mismatch distribution patterns, especially yak, goat, and
cattle, which were apparently caused by multiple divergent matrilineal components in each pool (Table 3),
instead of indicating a population in equilibrium. Indeed,

the multimodal mismatch distributions of Chinese cattle
were derived from the existence of both Bos taurus and Bos
indicus types [22,34]. An analysis of the mismatch distributions based on Bos taurus or Bos indicus types only
showed a unimodal distribution (data not shown). Overall, the mismatch distribution patterns of goat, yak, cattle,
and chicken were dramatically different when compared
to that of the domestic duck. Note that the comparison

Discussion
In this study we discerned the genetic diversity and origin
of Chinese native ducks. The weak phylogeographic structure of Chinese domestic ducks and wild mallards is
clearly discerned in the NJ tree and the network profile
based on the mtDNA control region haplotypes. The
results suggest that the matrilineal pool of Chinese
domestic ducks is homogeneous and all samples can be
grouped into one haplogroup, which is analogous to a
single matrilineal origin. The Cyt b gene sequences in 52
domestic duck and wild mallard samples that were
selected based on their control region sequence information contain only two variable sites, which further supports the homogeneous nature of the duck matrilineal
pool. The overall diversity of Chinese domestic duck estimated in our study was similar to the recent reports based
on the microsatellite markers [14] and the mtDNA control
region sequence variation [3].

aWe did not consider the nested sub-haplogroups within each main
haplogroup and neglected the potentially different age estimates for
each haplogroup when counting the number of haplogorups.

In a recent study, Hitosugi and colleagues analyzed the
Cyt b sequence variation of duck samples from East and
Southeast Asia, and they found that the samples from Taiwan and Japan were grouped into the Northeast Asian
group, whereas those from Indonesia, Vietnam, and west
Malaysia were clustered into the Southeast Asian group
[9]. This paraphyletic pattern of duck mtDNAs directly
contrasts the clustering pattern of Chinese samples.
Because we analyzed up to 26 domestic duck breeds/populations (which covers about 80% of the recorded native
duck breeds/populations in nearly all current habitats
across China; Table 1 and Figure 1) and three wild mallard populations, we believed that our sampling could
represent the entire matrilineal pool of Chinese duck (at
least for the Mainland region) and we should identify lineages belonging to the two groups. An audit for the Cyt b
sequences that were grouped into the Southeast Asian
group reported by Hitosugi et al. [9] showed that all these
sequences should be nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes
(NUMTs), as these Cyt b fragments contained a premature
termination codon. The invasion of NUMT is not infrequent in birds [35-37] and it had been identified in several goose species [36]. Among the two haplotypes in the
Northeast Asian group [9], one shared sequence with the
duck reference sequence (GenBank accession number
NC_009684) and the other was a close derivative of the
main haplotype in Chinese duck. Therefore, after eliminating the NUMTs in the data of Hitosugi et al. [9], the
emerging pattern from their duck Cyt b sequences is consistent with our results. In fact, Hitosugi et al. [9] also
sequenced the mtDNA control region sequences for these
East Asian duck samples and observed no variation; a
result that concurs with our findings.
An important issue which needs clarification concerns our
belief that the mtDNA sequence data generated in the
present study were free of NUMTs and DNA contamination, although we did not perform specific experiments

Mismatch distributions for domestic yak, goat, cattle, and chicken in China
Mismatch distributions for domestic yak, goat, cattle, and chicken in China. The data were from our previous studies and others [21-23,39]. The sample sizes for yak, goat, cattle, and chicken were 52, 795, 209, and 900, respectively.

for confirmation. Three lines of evidence justify our claim.
First, the mutation spectrum left by spurious amplification of a NUMT could be detected because it usually is
considerably different from the authentic natural spectrum [38]. Among all blood/tissue samples analyzed in
this study, we did not detect any sequences showing a
remarkable divergence (which would be resulted from the
different evolutionary rate between authentic mtDNA and
the NUMTs). Second, we obtained consistent patterns
between two different mtDNA fragments and all Cyt b
sequences could be fully translated. Third, DNA contamination between different samples and co-amplification of
NUMTs and authentic mtDNA would result in many heteroplasmic mutations in the sequence, which was not
observed in this study.

Interestingly, the matrilineal pool homogeneity of Chinese native ducks differed substantially with other domesticated Chinese animals, as judged by the numbers of
main matrilineal components (Table 3) and the mismatch distribution patterns (Figures 4 and 5). In contrast
to the unimodal shape for Chinese native ducks, the mismatch distributions for Chinese domestic yak [23,27],
goat [26,39], cattle [22,25,34], and chicken [20,21] were
bumpy or multimodal, which reflects the highly divergent
lineages within the population (Table 3). Multiple
domestication events of these latter farm animals could
account for the difference in their respective matrilineal
pools. We did not attempt to discern the domestication
time for Chinese domestic ducks in this study because of
concerns with the molecular clock [40-42]. Similarly, the
indistinguishable matrilineal components among different breeds/regional populations of both domestic ducks

and wild mallards have deterred any attempts to elucidate
the initial domestication site(s) of Chinese domestic
ducks.
Kulikova and colleagues detected two mtDNA haplogroups (A and B) of mallards that were collected from
western Russia to mainland Alaska, and found that the
haplogroup A was predominantly distributed in western
Russia and North Asia territories [29,30]. All Chinese
domestic duck and wild mallard mtDNAs in this study
could be grouped into haplogroup A, suggesting a close
relationship between the mallard matrilineal pools of
China and North Asia. The fact that five Thailand domestic duck samples shared haplotype H6 with Chinese
domestic ducks and wild mallards is also evidence for a
genetic continuality among these regional pools. Nonetheless, due to the small sample size of the Thailand
domestic duck, such a speculation should be interpreted
with caution.
During the past decade, many molecular studies (mainly
based on nuclear genetic markers) showed that the wild
mallard and spot-billed duck have contributed to the
genetic pool of Chinese domestic ducks, with the mallard
contributing a greater proportion [1,4-7]. However, in the
phylogenetic tree based on the mtDNA control region
sequences, the three spot-billed ducks were robustly separated and none of the Chinese domestic ducks and wild
mallards (including the Thailand sample) were clustered
with the spot-billed ducks. A possible explanation for this
unique pattern is that the genetic contribution of spotbilled duck to Chinese domestic duck pool might be via a
male-biased gene introgression, as have been described
between the eastern spot-billed duck and the mallard
[29]. Study of the paternal markers in wild spot-billed
duck, mallard, and domestic ducks will help to clarify this
important issue.

Conclusion
In this study, we analyzed Chinese domestic duck and
wild mallard mtDNA control regions and partial Cyt b
sequences variation. The results showed that all domestic
duck and wild mallard haplotypes were essentially indistinguishable and were clustered together in the phylogenetic tree. The matrilineal pool of Chinese domestic ducks
and mallards was rather homogeneous, without clear geographic differentiation of the regional breed/population
pools. This pattern substantially differs from other farm
animals in China.

Materials and methods
Sampling, DNA amplification and sequencing
In total, we collected 348 blood/tissue samples from 19
Chinese domestic duck breeds/populations (N = 278) and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/298

three wild mallard populations (N = 70) in East, Central
and South China (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood/tissue samples
using a standard phenol/chloroform method. The
mtDNA control region fragments (481 bp) were amplified
and sequenced using primer pair L194: 5'-CCTACCTATCGGACTACCCTC-3'/H716:
5'-GCAGGTGTGTCCAGGCTTAGA-3', which was designed in this study. PCR
amplification was performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture
containing 100 ng of DNA, 10 mM Tris – HCl (pH 8.3),
2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 pM of each primer, and 1
unit of Taq polymerase following 33 cycles of 50 s at
94°C, 40 s at 58°C, and 90 s at 72°C. PCR products were
purified on spin columns and were directly sequenced for
both strands using Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) on an ABI
PRISM® 3100 DNA sequencer according to the manufacturer's manual.
The Cyt b fragment (508 bp) was amplified and
sequenced using primer pair designed in this study
(L15230: 5'-ACCCTGACCCGATTCTTC-3'/H15774: 5'GATGCGAGTTGCCCGATGA-3') under the same condition as for mtDNA control region analysis but with a
modification of annealing temperature (55°C) during the
PCR amplification.
Data analysis
The domestic duck and wild mallard mtDNA control
region and Cyt b sequences were edited and aligned using
the DNAstar program (DNAS Inc, Madison, WI, USA).
The sequences obtained were aligned based on the complete mitochondrial genome of Anas platyrhynchos (GenBank accession number NC_009684). We retrieved 106
Chinese domestic duck mtDNA control region sequences
from nine native breeds/populations (including two
breeds that were overlapped with our sampling) and five
Thailand native ducks (GenBank accession numbers
EU013948–EU013952) from GenBank. All these reported
control region sequences were aligned with the new
sequences generated in this study and were truncated to
481 bp fragments in the following analyses. Ten reported
mtDNA sequences (shared by nine haplotypes; GenBank
accession numbers EF126707, EF126709, EF126710,
EF126719, EF126720, EF126722, EF126729, EF126730,
and EF126732) were excluded for further analysis because
of apparent sequencing and reading errors by applying an
error-pinpointing approach described in our previous
study and others [43,44]. Three mtDNA control region
sequences of the spot-billed duck (Anas zonorhyncha) were
retrieved
from
GenBank
(accession
numbers
AY506945–AY506947) and were included in the NJ tree
analysis to discern their phylogenetic relationship to
domestic samples.

The NJ tree was constructed based on the haplotypes identified in domestic ducks, mallards, and spot-billed ducks
and the Kimura-2-parameters model using MEGA 4.0
[45]. The Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata; GenBank
accession number L16769) was chosen as the outgroup to
root the tree. Median-joining network of the mtDNA control region sequence haplotypes was constructed according to Bandelt et al. [46] using program Network 4.1 http:/
/www.fluxus-engineering.com/sharenet.htm. We estimated the haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity
(π) of the breeds/populations using DnaSP 4.10 [47]. The
Fs values of the neutrality test [31] and the mismatch distributions [32] for the domestic ducks and wild mallards,
as well as the total samples were analyzed using DnaSP
4.10 [47]. We also estimated the mismatch distributions
for some reported Chinese domestic animals, such as
chicken, cattle, yak, and goat [21-23,39], in comparison to
that of the duck. The new duck mtDNA control region and
Cyt b sequences generated in this study were deposited in
GenBank
under
accession
numbers
and
EU678194–EU678245,
EU677846–EU678193
respectively.
