Abstract
Background: Associated with appropriate crop and soil management, inoculation of legumes with microbial
biofertilizers can improve food legume yield and soil fertility and reduce pollution by inorganic fertilizers.
Rhizospheric bacteria are subjected to osmotic stress imposed by drought and/or NaCl, two abiotic constraints
frequently found in semi-arid lands. Osmostress response in bacteria involves the accumulation of small organic
compounds called compatible solutes. Whereas most studies on rhizobial osmoadaptation have focussed on the
model species Sinorhizobium meliloti, little is known on the osmoadaptive mechanisms used by native rhizobia,
which are good sources of inoculants. In this work, we investigated the synthesis and accumulations of compatible
solutes by four rhizobial strains isolated from root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris in Tunisia, as well as by the
reference strain Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899T.
Results: The most NaCl-tolerant strain was A. tumefaciens 10c2, followed (in decreasing order) by R. tropici CIAT
899, R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3, R. etli 12a3 and R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3. 13C- and 1H-NMR analyses
showed that all Rhizobium strains synthesized trehalose whereas A. tumefaciens 10c2 synthesized mannosucrose.
Glutamate synthesis was also observed in R. tropici CIAT 899, R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3 and A. tumefaciens
10c2. When added as a carbon source, mannitol was also accumulated by all strains. Accumulation of trehalose in
R. tropici CIAT 899 and of mannosucrose in A. tumefaciens 10c2 was osmoregulated, suggesting their involvement
in osmotolerance. The phylogenetic analysis of the otsA gene, encoding the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase,
suggested the existence of lateral transfer events. In vivo 13C labeling experiments together with genomic analysis
led us to propose the uptake and conversion pathways of different carbon sources into trehalose. Collaterally, the
b-1,2-cyclic glucan from R. tropici CIAT 899 was co-extracted with the cytoplasmic compatible solutes and its
chemical structure was determined.
Conclusions: The soil bacteria analyzed in this work accumulated mainly disaccharides in response to NaCl stress.
We could not find a direct correlation between the trehalose content of the rhizobial strains and their
osmotolerance, suggesting that additional osmoadaptive mechanism should be operating in the most NaCltolerant strain R. tropici CIAT 899.

Background
Rhizobium-legume symbiosis represents the most
important nitrogen-fixing mechanism, which may have
the potential to increase nitrogen input in arid and
semi-arid ecosystems. However, biotic (i.e., pests or

diseases), and abiotic (i.e., salinity, drought, high temperature or heavy metals) constraints limit legume crop
production in arid and semi-arid lands, which are often
located in developing countries [1]. Both drought and
salinity impose osmotic stress, as a result of large concentrations of either salt or non-ionic solutes in the surrounding medium, with the resulting deficit of water [2].
The Rhizobium-legume symbiosis is highly sensitive to
osmotic stress. Therefore strategies to improve the

symbiosis efficiency and legume production under this
constraint should target both symbiotic partners,
together with appropriate crop and soil management [1].
Rhizospheric rhizobia are subjected to frequent fluctuations in the osmolarity of their environment due to
the succession of drought and rain periods, the exclusion of salts like NaCl from root tissues, the release of
plant exudates, or the production of exopolymers by
plant roots and rhizobacteria. In addition, rhizobia must
also adapt to the osmotic situation during the infection
process and in a nodule exchanging nutrients with the
host plant [3]. Therefore, besides symbiotic efficiency,
osmotolerance may constitute a competitive trait for
either native or inoculant rhizobia, in order to persist in
drought/salt-affected soils, and/or after the process of
seed coat-mediated desiccation, and maybe to improve
the colonization and/or infection process.
One of the main mechanisms of bacterial adaptation
to hyperosmotic conditions is the intracytoplasmic accumulation of low molecular-weight organic osmolytes
[2,4]. These molecules are termed compatible solutes
because they do not interact with macromolecules in
detrimental ways [5]. Compatible solutes are accumulated either by uptake from the environment (exogenous
compatible solutes or osmoprotectants) or by de novo
biosynthesis (endogenous compatible solutes). The
diversity of compatible solutes is large but falls into a
few major chemical categories, such as sugars (i.e.,
sucrose, trehalose), polyols (i.e,, sorbitol, mannitol),
amino acids and derivatives (i.e. proline, glutamate, glutamine), betaines and ectoines [4]. It is very common
for microorganisms to use a cocktail of compatible
solutes, a strategy that allows the cell to adapt the compatible solute pool to different environmental injuries.
Indeed, the role of compatible solutes goes beyond
osmotic adjustment alone, to protection of cells and cell
components from freezing, desiccation, high temperature and oxygen radicals [4,6,7]. On the other hand,
hypoosmotic adaptation in gram-negative bacteria,
including the Rhizobiaceae, involves the accumulation of
periplasmic cyclic glucans, which appear to contribute
substantially to periplasmic osmolarity [3,8].
Among the Rhizobiaceae, the best studied species
regarding osmoadaptation is Sinorhizobium meliloti one
of the most common alfalfa microsymbionts. Specific
concomitant accumulation of potassium and glutamate
was found to be the primary response in S. meliloti to
hyperosmotic stress [9]. Out of four potassium uptake
systems found within the S. meliloti genome, Trk was
shown to be the most important K+ importer involved
in the osmoadaptation of this bacterium [10]. By using
13
C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (a particularly useful technique for osmoadaptation studies
because all types of organic compounds can be detected

Page 2 of 16

at once), it was shown that S. meliloti long term
response to hyperosmotic stress involves the synthesis
and accumulation of the dipeptide N-acetylglutaminylglutamine amide and the disaccharide trehalose, the latter one specially when cells are subjected to severe
osmotic stress [3,11].
Trehalose is a non-reducing glucose disaccharide that
is widespread in nature. It protects numerous biological
structures against abiotic stresses including desiccation,
oxidation, heat, cold, dehydration, and hyperosmotic
conditions [6]. Recently, the importance of trehalose in
osmotolerance and nodulation of their legume hosts by
S. meliloti [12] and Bradyrhizobium japonicum [13] has
been firmly established. Trehalose has shown to play
also a major role in desiccation tolerance of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii [14].
Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is an important
staple crop in the diets of people of Latin America, Asia,
Africa, and other regions of the developing world. Paradoxically, despite common bean is a promiscuous
legume able to form symbioses with a number of rhizobial species including R. tropici, R. etli, R. gallicum, R.
leguminosarum bv. phaseoli or R. giardinii [15-17], it is
considered as a poor nitrogen fixer, if compared to
other grain legumes [18,19]. This problem has been
attributed to the ineffectiveness of indigenous rhizobia
[20] or to adverse abiotic conditions [21]. In a recent
work, Suarez et al. [22] reported an increase in root
nodule number and nitrogen fixation by P. vulgaris cv.
Negro Jamapa (a Mesoamerican cultivar) inoculated
with a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase-overexpressing
strain of R. etli. Thus, manipulating trehalose metabolism in P. vulgaris looks a promising strategy to improve
plant tolerance to osmotic stress and grain yield. Compared to this body of knowledge on the osmoadaptation
of these agronomically important rhizobacteria, little is
known about the osmostress responses of rhizobial
strains nodulating common bean in Africa. The purpose
of the work described here was threefold. First, we used
13
C-NMR to compare the osmoadaptive responses of
three effective Rhizobium strains isolated from root
nodules of P vulgaris grown in Tunisian fields under
rainfed conditions [23,24] with that of the reference
strain R. tropici CIAT 899 T, a Latin American isolate
that has been shown to tolerate several abiotic stresses,
including high temperature, low pH, or salinity
[15,25,26]. Despite a number of R. tropici CIAT 899
osmosensitive mutants has been characterized, none of
them was affected in compatible solute synthesis [26,27].
In fact, the complete set of compatible solutes in this
strain was unknown previously to this work. Second, we
aimed to determine the osmoadaptive mechanism of
Agrobacterium sp. 10c2 (proposed in this paper as A.
tumefaciens 10c2), which was isolated from the same

Tunisian common bean fields as the above strains [24].
Agrobacterium sp. 10c2 could not nodulate P. vulgaris
per se, but it was able to colonize pre-formed P. vulgaris
nodules [28] and to modulate, either positively or negatively, nodulation of common beans by native rhizobia
[29]. Third, we focused on trehalose, which we found as
the major compatible solute in the four Rhizobium
strains. We determined the trehalose content of the
strains and traced its biosynthetic pathway both molecularly and biochemically. Collaterally, the b-1,2-cyclic glucan from R. tropici CIAT 899 was co-extracted with the
cytoplasmic compatible solutes when cells were grown
at low salinity, and its chemical structure was determined by using a suite of one-dimensional and twodimensional NMR spectra and mass spectrometry.

Results
Strain identity and phylogeny

Strains R. gallicum bv. gallicum 8a3, R. etli 12a3, Agrobacterium sp. 10c2 and R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli
31c3 were previously isolated by Mhamdi et al. [23]
from nodules of P. vulgaris grown on neutral soil samples collected from North Tunisia. A preliminary strain
affiliation was made upon RFLP analysis of the 16S
rRNA, nodC and nifH genes [24], and partial sequence
of the 16S rDNA and BLAST search for homologous
sequences (for Agrobacterium sp. 10c2 [28]). To confirm
the identity and phylogenetic position of the strains, we
sequenced their nearly complete 16S rDNA Figure 1
shows the phylogenetic tree constructed using the
neighbor-joining method based on these sequences and
those of closely related rhizobia obtained from GeneBank. Strains R. etli 12a3, R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3,
and Agrobacterium sp. 10c2 grouped with the R. etli, R.
gallicum and A. tumefaciens type strains. On the basis
of its phylogenetic relatedness to the type strain of A.
tumefaciens, we propose strain Agrobacterium sp. 10c2
to be named as A. tumefaciens 10c2. R. leguminosarum
bv. phaseoli 31c3 was in the same cluster as the type
strains of R. leguminosarum bvs. trifolii and viciae, but
in a separate branch. Interestingly, the type strain of R.
leguminosarum bv. phaseoli, was in a separate group,
close to the R. etli type strain. This lack of clustering
between the type strains of R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli and the other two biovars of R. leguminosarum was
previously reported [30], and it was proposed that R.
phaseoli should be retained as a separate species.
Differences in halotolerance of the strains

As a previous step to investigate the compatible solute
content of the local and reference strains, we selected a
suitable minimal medium for their growth and determined their tolerance to NaCl. Growth was tested in
two chemically defined minimal media (M79-I or MAS)

with two different carbon sources (20 mM glucose or
mannitol). Cell yield (as measured by turbidimetry)
showed that R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3 grew better in
M79-I with glucose, R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3
and R. etli 12a3 in M79-I with mannitol, and R. tropici
CIAT 899 and A. tumefaciens 10c2 in MAS with mannitol (data not shown). Subsequently, cells were grown in
50 ml of their optimal minimal media containing
increasing NaCl concentrations up to 600 mM NaCl.
Cultures were incubated at 28°C and growth was monitored up to the stationary phase. The most salt-tolerant
strain was A. tumefaciens 10c2, which grew well in MAS
medium containing 400 mM NaCl and displayed optimal growth at 200 mM NaCl (Figure 2). A. tumefaciens
10c2 growth was totally impaired at 600 mM NaCl (not
shown). The second most NaCl-tolerant strain was R.
tropici CIAT 899, which grew well in MAS medium
containing up to 200 mM NaCl and showed optimal
growth at 50 mM NaCl. Strains R. leguminosarum bv.
phaseoli 31c3, R. etli 12a3 and R. gallicum bv. phaseoli
8a3 were the most salt sensitive ones, showing optimal
growth in basal M79-I medium with no extra salt
added. R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3 was slightly
more salt-tolerant than R. etli 12a3 and R. gallicum bv.
phaseoli 8a3. Growth of these three strains was severely
impaired over 100 mM NaCl (Figure 2).
Analysis of major intracellular solutes

The differences found in salt tolerance of the strains
prompted us to investigate and compare their compatible solute content. For this purpose, we analyzed cellular
extracts by using 1 H- and 13 C-NMR. The 13 C-NMR
spectrum of R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3 grown
in mannitol M79-I medium with 100 mM NaCl contained three sets of chemical shifts that were assigned to
the disaccharide trehalose (61.2, 70.4, 71.7, 72.8, 73.2,
and 93.9 ppm), the sugar alcohol mannitol (63.9, 70.0,
and 71.6 ppm) and the amino acid glutamate (27.6, 34.2,
55.4, 175.2, and 181.9 ppm) (Figure 3A). Trehalose and
mannitol, but not glutamate, were also majoritarily
found in extracts from strain R. etli 12a3 cultivated in
mannitol M79-I medium with 100 mM NaCl (Figure
3B). The identity of these three compatible solutes was
confirmed by 1H-NMR analysis of extracts from the two
strains (not shown).
When grown in MAS medium with 100 mM NaCl in
the presence of mannitol, R. tropici CIAT 899 spectrum
displayed three sets of resonances that could be assigned
to trehalose, mannitol and glutamate, and a fourth set of
six sugar carbon resonances (at 61.3, 69.5, 76.1, 77.0, 82.5,
and 102.6 ppm) that could not be initially assigned to any
known compound (Figure 4A). However, the presence of a
signal with a chemical shift above 102 ppm, indicated b
configuration of a glucose unit. When the salt

medium, only chemical shifts due trehalose and glutamate
were observed, whereas those corresponding to mannitol
and the unknown sugar were not detected (Figure 4B).
Trehalose, mannitol, and an unknown minoritary sugar
showing a similar resonance pattern as the unidentified
compound found in R. tropici CIAT 899, were detected in
the 13 C-NMR spectra of R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3
grown in M79-I medium with 100 mM NaCl and mannitol (Figure 4C). However, mannitol was not accumulated
in R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3 cultivated in the same

medium with glucose as a carbon source (Figure 4D), suggesting that mannitol accumulation depends on its transport, rather than synthesis, in this strain.
Figure 5 shows the 13C-NMR analysis of A. tumefaciens
10c2 grown in mannitol MAS medium with increasing
salinity. At the lowest salt concentration tested (100 mM
NaCl), mannitol was the only intracellular solute detected
(Figure 5A). However, above 100 mM NaCl mannitol was
absent, and spectra contained five resonances attributed
to glutamate and twelve resonances corresponding to
the disaccharide mannosucrose (b-fructofuranosyl-a-

Identification of the latter was performed by comparison
of the observed and published chemical shifts of this compound, which was reported to be accumulated by A. tumefaciens strain NT1 [31].
Trehalose content of the rhizobial strains

As the four Rhizobium strains which accumulated trehalose displayed different salt tolerance, we investigated if

there was a correlation between their intracellular trehalose content and their tolerance to salinity. For this purpose, trehalose was quantified colorimetrically from cells
grown up to early stationary phase in their optimal
minimal medium with 0.1 M (all strains) or 0.2 M NaCl
(only CIAT 899) NaCl. As illustrated in Figure 6, intracellular trehalose content of strains R. leguminosarum
bv. phaseoli 31c3, R. etli 12a3 and R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3 grown at 0.1 M NaCl ranged from 0.11 to 0.16
μmol/mg protein. At the same salinity, cells of the more
salt-tolerant R. tropici CIAT 899 accumulated ca. 0.03
μmol of trehalose per mg of protein, but they displayed
a 3.2-fold higher trehalose content when they were
grown at 0.2 M NaCl, suggesting that trehalose accumulation in this strain is osmoregulated. However, even at
0.2 M NaCl trehalose levels of R. tropici CIAT 899 were
equivalent to those of the more salt-sensitive strains R.
leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3 and R. gallicum bv.
phaseoli 8a3 grown under their NaCl limiting conditions
(0.1 M NaCl). The above data suggest that there is not a
direct correlation between trehalose content of the
strains and their salt tolerance. In addition, they suggest
that, although trehalose accumulation in R. tropici CIAT
899 is osmoregulated, trehalose alone cannot account
for the higher halotolerance of R. tropici CIAT 899.
Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of the otsA gene

Since all Rhizobium strains tested synthesized trehalose,
we were interested to check if this occurs through the
OtsA-OtsB pathway. This very well conserved route
involves the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to
glucose-phosphate to form trehalose-6-phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (OtsA). Then, a trehalose-

Figure 4 Analysis of major intracellular solutes in R. tropici CIAT 899 and R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3. R. tropici CIAT899 was grown in
MAS minimal medium with 20 mM mannitol and 100 mM (A) or 200 mM (B) NaCl. R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3 was grown in M79-I minimal
medium with 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM mannitol (C) or glucose (D). Cellular extracts were analyzed by 13C-NMR. Resonances due to trehalose
(T), mannitol (M), glutamate (G), and unknown sugars (X, Y) are indicated.

6-phosphate phosphatase (OtsB) dephosphorylates this
intermediate to produce trehalose [32,33]. The otsA
genes of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii [14], S. meliloti
[12], R. etli [22] and B. japonicum [13] have been
recently isolated. To check the presence of otsA in the
genome of the Rhizobium strains, we designed oligonucleotides covering two very well-conserved regions and
amplified the corresponding genes from genomic DNA
of the selected strains. Single PCR products of ca. 1 kb
were obtained from genomic DNAs of R. etli 12a3, R.
gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3 and R. leguminosarum bv.
phaseoli 31c3 (by using the primers OTA1 and OTA2),
and R. tropici CIAT 899 (by using the primers OTAS1
and OTAS2). As expected, A. tumefaciens 10c2 DNA
was not amplified with any of the two otsA primer pairs.

The aligned OtsA proteins were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, and the resulting tree is shown in Figure 7.
As expected, the OtsA proteins from R. tropici CIAT 899,
R. etli 12a3, R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3 and R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3 grouped with OtsA proteins of aproteobacteria, but some incongruencies were found. For
example, R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3 OtsA was more
related to the OtsA proteins of Sinorhizobium (i.e. S. meliloti 1021 or Rhizobium sp. NGR 234) than to those of R.
etli or R. leguminosarum. In addition, R. etli 12a3 OtsA
did not cluster with R. etli CFN 42 OtsA but with the
OtsA proteins from R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3
and R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii. From the above results,
we suggest that the OtsA-OtsB pathway may be involved
in trehalose synthesis in all strains tested.

Synthesis of trehalose by R. tropici CIAT 899 from
different carbon sources

The results presented so far indicated that trehalose is
synthesized from mannitol-derived glucose via the OtsAOtsB pathway in the four Rhizobium strains tested. We
were interested to know if trehalose could be also synthesized from other carbon sources. For this purpose, R. tropici CIAT 899 was grown in 0.1 M NaCl MAS with
glucose, galactose, mannose and mannitol and the accumulated compounds were analyzed by 1H NMR. Figure
8A-D shows that whereas the unknown sugar (later identified as a cyclic b-glucan) was synthesized from any of
the tested carbon sources, trehalose was only accumulated when glucose, galactose or mannitol, but not mannose, was present in the culture medium.

To elucidate if the synthesis of trehalose by R. tropici
CIAT 899 involves the transformation of mannitol to
one or both of the trehalose glucose units, or a full
degradation of the carbon source followed by a synthesis
de novo, this strain was grown in 0.1 M NaCl MAS
medium with 1-13C-mannitol as carbon source, and the
cellular extracts were analyzed by 1H spectroscopy. As
shown in Figure 8E, only resonances corresponding to
the C1 and C6 carbons of the glucose units of trehalose
and the unknown sugar, as well as those of the C1/C6
of mannitol, could be observed. In contrast, the three
signals corresponding to glutamate were 13 C-labelled.
These findings indicate that the two glucose moieties of
trehalose, as well as the unknown sugar units, were
derived directly from mannitol, whereas glutamate

synthesis occurred de novo, after complete mannitol
degradation.
The unknown sugar accumulated by R. tropici CIAT 899 at
low salinity is a cyclic (1!2)-b-glucan

Initially, the six remaining resonances in the 13C-NMR
spectrum of cellular extracts from R. tropici CIAT 899
grown at low salinity could not be assigned to any
known compatible solute (see Figure 3A). To determine
the structure of this unknown sugar, we took advantage
of the fact that R. tropici grown in the presence of mannose does not synthesize trehalose, which could interfere in the identification of this compound. Thus, cells
of R. tropici were grown in MAS medium containing 20
mM mannose as a carbon source, and the unknown
sugar was identified by using a set of 1H-NMR, COSY,
NOESY, HSQC, HMBC and MS experiments. First, in
the 1H spectrum, a doublet at 4.87 ppm (J 7.9 Hz) was
unequivocally assigned to the anomeric hydrogen of a
b-glycoside unit. Second, the combination of the COSY
and NOESY spectra (not shown) and the 1H-13C HSQC
spectrum permitted the assignment of all proton and
carbon signals in the compound (Table 1). Third, the
HMBC experiment confirmed a 1!2 link between two
monosaccharide, unsubstituted, molecules (Figure 9A).
Finally, the mass spectrum showed a peak at m/z 1400
corresponding to [M+Na] ++ , from which we could
deduce a molecular weight of 2754, corresponding to 17
b-glucopyranose units. On the basis of this result, the
structure of the compound was established as a cyclic
(1!2)-b-glucan formed by 17 b-glucopyranose units
(Figure 9B). This compound had been previously
described as an extracellular glucan secreted by R. tropici CIAT 899 [34]. Our results clearly indicate that, as
expected, the R. tropici CIAT 899 cyclic (1!2)-b glucan
is also cell-associated.

Discussion
In this work, we investigated the osmoadaptive mechanisms used by four native rhizobia isolated from root
nodules of P. vulgaris cultivated in north Tunisia [23].
Strains R. etli 12a3, R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3 and R.
leguminsarum 31c3 are potentially good inoculants as
they were infective and showed efficient nitrogen fixation in symbiosis with P. vulgaris [23]. In addition, Agrobacterium 10c2 was able to colonize preformed P.

vulgaris nodules [28] and to specifically favour nodulation by some local strains [29], suggesting that it might
be used as co-inoculant. Our results confirm the strain
affiliations proposed by Mhandi et al. [24,28]. In addition, on the basis of its phylogenetic relatedness to the
A. tumefaciens type strain, Agrobacterium 10c2 is proposed in this work to be renamed as A. tumefaciens
10c2.
As shown by 13 C- and 1 H-NMR analyses, the longterm response of the four Rhizobium strains to NaCl
involved the accumulation of trehalose, mannitol and
glutamate; but the latter one was only observed in R.
leguminsarum 31c3 and R. tropici CIAT 899. The reason
why glutamate was not present in the extracts of R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3 and R. etli 12a3 is unknown. It
might be that glutamate is accumulated in these strains
only during the early osmostress response, as the most
commonly used charge counterbalance for K+ influx [4],
but it is subsequently replaced by trehalose. This was
previously demonstrated in S. meliloti by Gouffi et al
[35]. On the other hand, mannosucrose and glutamate
were the main osmolytes in A. tumefaciens 10c2 grown
at high salinity, whereas at low salt only mannitol was
observed. Mannosucrose accumulation was found to be
NaCl-dependent in A. tumefaciens 10c2 (this study), A
tumefaciens strains C58 and NT1 [31] and in rhizobial
isolates from Acacia nodules [36], supporting the
hypothesis that this compatible solute participates in
alleviating osmotic stress. However, isolation and analysis of osmosensitive mutants would be necessary to
prove the latter statement, and additional mechanisms
involved in A. tumefaciens 10c2 osmoadaptation cannot
be ruled out.
In the tested strains, mannitol was not accumulated
when glucose was used as a carbon source (Figure 4,
and data not shown). On the other hand, cells grown
with [1/6-13C]mannitol as a carbon source accumulated
[1/6- 13 C]mannitol, indicating that mannitol was not
synthesized de novo but accumulated upon transport
from the external medium. Bacteria rarely synthesize
mannitol as a compatible solute, but it is frequent to
find it as an external osmoprotectant [4]. In general,
uptake and accumulation of osmoprotectants is preferred over the synthesis of endogenous compatible
solutes, as the latter is energetically more costly [37].
However, R. tropici CIAT 899 and A. tumefaciens 10c2
used mannitol both as carbon source and as an osmoprotectant solute at low salinity, but mannitol was
replaced by endogenous compatible solutes (i.e. trehalose or mannosucrose) when cells were exposed to
hyperosmotic stress (see Figures 3 and 4). This finding
may be explained by two, non-exclusive, reasons: (i) that
trehalose and mannosucrose are better osmolytes than
mannitol, and/or (ii) that energy-requiring systems,

other than trehalose or mannosucrose synthesis, were
operating at high salinity, and mannitol catabolism was
enhanced in detriment of its accumulation.
The role of trehalose as a compatible solute involved
in bacterial tolerance to osmotic stress has been widely
demonstrated in the literature. Thus, E. coli [38], S.

meliloti [12] and B. japonicum [13] mutants lacking the
otsA gene for the synthesis of trehalose are osmosensitive. In another study, Alarico et al. [39] found a direct
correlation between the presence of genes for trehalose
synthesis (otsA/otsB) in Thermus thermophilus strains
and their halotolerance. In this work, we found that

Fernandez-Aunión et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:192
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/192

trehalose synthesis in R. tropici CIAT 899 is osmoregulated (Figure 6), suggesting the involvement of trehalose
in the osmotolerance of this strain. However, we could
not find a direct correlation between the trehalose content of the rhizobial strains and their osmotolerance. On
the contrary, trehalose levels in the less salt tolerant
strains grown at 0.1 M NaCl were 10 fold-higher than
those of the more salt-tolerant R. tropici CIAT 899
grown under the same conditions (Figure 6). Therefore,
trehalose alone cannot account for the higher osmotolerance of R tropici CIAT 899. It is improbable that
accumulation of mannitol by R tropici CIAT 899 conferred it a higher halotolerance, as mannitol was also
accumulated by the less salt-tolerant strains. Other saltinduced responses, as modifications in the pattern of
extracellular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides
might be involved [3]. Upon transposon mutagenesis,
Nogales et al [27] identified eight gene loci required for
adaptation of R tropici CIAT 899 to high salinity. These
included genes involved in regulation of gene expression, genes related to synthesis, assembly, and maturation of proteins, and genes related with cellular buildup
and maintenance.
To date, three different enzymatic pathways have been
described for trehalose synthesis in rhizobia (OtsAB,
TreS and TreYZ; [40]). The most common two-step
OtsAB pathway catalyzes the synthesis of trehalose from
UDP-glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. Trehalose
synthase (TreS) catalyzes the reversible conversion of
maltose and trehalose. Finally, the two-step TreYZ pathway acts in the production of trehalose from a linear
maltodextrin (e.g., glycogen) [32]. In this work, we
showed the presence of otsA within the genome of the
four Rhizobium analyzed strains, suggesting that trehalose synthesis in these strains occurs at least via OtsAB.
Synthesis of trehalose from maltooligosaccharides in R.
tropici CIAT 899 was earlier reported [41], although
TreY activity could not be detected [40]. Interestingly,
the phylogenetic position of OtsA from R. gallicum bv
phaseoli 8a3 and R. etli 12a3 was not consistent with
the 16S rDNA-based tree, suggesting the existence of
lateral transfer events. Avonce et al. [32] also found
inconsistencies in the topology of a proteobacterial
OtsA-based tree, and suggested to be caused by either
lateral gene transfer or differential loss of paralogs.
Cyclic (1!2)-b-glucans have a role in hyposmotic
adaptation of the legume symbiont rhizobiaceae [8]. In
R. tropici CIAT 899 (and probably R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3) cells grown at low salinity, the cyclic b-glucan
was co-extracted with the cytoplasmic compatible solute
pool, suggesting that high amounts of beta glucan were
present in the periplasm.. As trehalose, cyclic (1!2)-bglucans are synthesized from UDP-glucose [8]. We
found that mannitol and galactose were substrates for

Page 12 of 16

both trehalose and the b-glucan of R. tropici CIAT 899.
In contrast, mannose was a substrate for the b-glucan
but not for trehalose.. From the above data, we conclude
that R. tropici CIAT 899 can convert mannitol and
galactose into UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate,
the two trehalose precursors, but it cannot transform
mannose into glucose-6-phosphate. In E. coli and other
bacteria, galactose degradation pathway I (Leloir pathway) can yield both UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate [42]. Thus, a similar route might be operating in
R. tropici CIAT 899. By using [1/6- 13 C]mannitol as a
carbon source, we showed that both trehalose moieties,
as well as the b-glucan units, where derived directly
from mannitol. In E. coli and other bacteria, mannitol
and mannose enter the cell via specific phosphotransferase systems so the first intracellular species are mannitol-1-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphate, respectively.
In a second step, these phosphoderivatives are converted
by a single dehydrogenase or isomerase reaction, respectively, into the glycolytic intermediate fructose-6-phosphate, which in turn is converted to glucose-6phosphate by the action of a phosphoglucose isomerase
[43,44]. A search in the KEGG specialized pathway database [45] showed that the genomes of R. etli CFN 42, R.
leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841, S. meliloti 1021, A.
tumefaciens C58, Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099, B.
japonicum USDA 110 and Rhizobium sp. NGR 234,
among others, do not carry the mtlA gene encoding the
specific mannitol phosphotransferase, suggesting that in
the Rhizobiaceae mannitol do not use a phosphotransferase system to enter the cell. Instead, we found the
smoEFGK genes encoding a sorbitol/mannitol ABC
transporter, mtlK (encoding a mannitol 2-dehydrogenase
that converts mannitol to fructose), and xylA (encoding
a xylose isomerase that converts fructose to glucose). By
analogy with these phylogenetic relatives, we suggest
that in R. tropici mannitol could be converted into glucose via fructose. In the case of mannose, we found that
the above genomes carried manX, encoding the phosphohistidine-sugar phosphotransferase protein, suggesting that the first intracellular species is mannose-6phosphate. The gene manA, encoding the mannose-6phosphate isomerase (isomerizing mannose-6-phosphate
into fructose-6-phosphate) is present in S. meliloti, Rhizobium sp. NGR 234, A. tumefaciens and B. japonicum,
but not in R. etli, R. leguminosarum, or M. loti. This
finding suggests that the latter microorganisms, and
most probably R. tropici CIAT 899, cannot convert
mannose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate, and
consequently it cannot yield glucose-6-phosphate. R.
etli, R. leguminosarum and M. loti carried noeK, encoding a phosphomannomutase that converts mannose-6phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, and noeJ, encoding
a mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase that

Fernandez-Aunión et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:192
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/192

converts mannose-1-phosphate to GDP-mannose, a precursor for glucan biosynthesis. In addition, R. tropici
CIAT899 carries a noeJ-like gene, as described by
Nogales et al [27]. Again by analogy with its close relatives, we suggest that a similar pathway might be operating in R. tropici, explaining why this microorganism can
synthesize the cyclic b-glucan from mannose, but cannot convert mannose into trehalose.

Conclusions
The accumulation of compatible solutes is referred as
one of the main mechanisms of bacterial tolerance to
osmotic stress conditions such as salinity and drought.
In this work, we found that all Rhizobium strains tested
synthesized trehalose, whereas the most NaCl-tolerant
strain A. tumefaciens 10c2 synthesized mannosucrose.
Whereas this finding suggests that mannosucrose might
be a better compatible solute than trehalose, this would
need experimental support. Despite trehalose synthesis
was osmoregulated in R. tropici CIAT 899, our data suggest that trehalose alone cannot account for the higher
osmotolerance of this strain. Thus, osmoadaptation in R.
tropici CIAT 899 (and most soil microorganisms) is
probably a complex process involving many physiological and biochemical response mechanisms, not yet fully
elucidated. Although trehalose, without doubt, participates in some way to alleviate osmotic stress, there is
increasing evidence that trehalose is primarily a stress
metabolite designed to ensure cell survival. In fact, trehalose synthesis in E. coli is under the control of the
general stress factor s S , which is responsible for the
expression of genes induced upon entry of stationary
phase [38]. In S. meliloti, trehalose synthesis is under
the control of the general stress factor RpoE2 [46],
which is also necessary for desiccation resistance [47].
Thus, it may be possible that NaCl-induced synthesis of
trehalose and mannosucrose in the isolated soil strains
are also involved in drought tolerance. This will be
investigated in a future work.
In this work, we showed the presence of otsA within
the genome of the four studied Rhizobium strains, suggesting that trehalose synthesis in these strains occurs at
least via OtsAB. In addition, by using [1/6-13C]mannitol
as a carbon source, we showed that in R. tropici CIAT
899 both trehalose moieties, as well as the b-glucan
units, where derived directly from mannitol. This finding, together with in silico analysis of rhizobial genomes,
suggests that R. tropici takes up mannitol via a sorbitol/
mannitol ABC transporter. Subsequently, mannitol is
converted to fructose (by a mannitol 2-dehydrogenase)
and the latter one into glucose, the trehalose precursor,
by a xylose isomerase. In the case of mannose, the in
silico analysis suggest that R. tropici incorporates it
through a phosphotransferase system, yielding mannose-

Page 13 of 16

6-phosphate, but it cannot convert mannose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate, as it may lack the mannose-6-phosphate
isomerase.
This
metabolic
reconstruction would explain why R. tropici CIAT 899
cannot synthesize trehalose from mannose.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Bacterial strains used in this study were R. gallicum bv.
gallicum 8a3, R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3, R.
etli 12a3, Agrobacterium sp. 10c2 (in this work renamed
as A. tumefaciens 10c2) [23,24], and R. tropici CIAT
899 T [15]. The reference strain R. tropici CIAT 899 T
belongs to the CIAT (International Center for Tropical
Agriculture, Colombia) culture collection. It is able to
form effective symbiosis with P. vulgaris and Leucaena
trees [15] and to tolerate high temperature, low pH, and
salinity [25,26]. Rhizobial strains were routinely grown
in complex TY medium [48] at 28°C. For determination
of salinity range and preparation of cell extracts for analysis of compatible solutes, two minimal media were
used: MAS medium [49] or M79-I. M79-I is a modified
M79 medium [50] in which yeast extract was substituted
by 2.75% KNO3. The basal salinity of both M79-I and
MAS was 17 mM NaCl. The osmotic strength of the
media was increased by the addition of 50 to 600 mM
final concentrations of NaCl. Glucose, mannitol, mannose, galactose or 1/6-13C-mannitol was used as carbon
source at a final concentration of 20 mM. Growth was
monitored by measuring the optical density at O.D.600
of the cultures with a Perkin Elmer Lamda 25 UV/Vis
spectrophotometer.
Preparation of cell extracts, NMR spectroscopy and Mass
spectrometry

Rhizobial strains were grown in 200 ml of M79-I or
MAS minimal media up to late exponential/early stationary phase phase of growth. Carbon source and NaCl
concentrations used varied according to the strain.
Extraction of endogenous compatible solutes was performed as described by García-Estepa et al. [51]. For
1
H- and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, dried extracts were resuspended in D2O (0.5
ml). NMR spectra were recorded at 25°C on a Bruker
AV500 spectrometer at 500 MHz for 1H-NMR and 125
MHz for 13C-NMR. The chemical shifts are reported in
ppm on the δ scale relative to tetramethylsilane. Signals
corresponding to trehalose, glutamate, mannosucrose,
and mannitol were confirmed by comparison with previously 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of pure compounds
or published chemical shift values [31]. Signals in the
NMR spectra of the unknown sugar observed in R. tropici CIAT 899 extracts (later on identified as a b-glucan)
were assigned by using a suite of COSY (correlated

spectroscopy), 1 D NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect
spectroscopy), HSQC (heteronuclear single-quantum
coherence), and HMBC (heteronuclear single-quantum
coherence) experiments. The final cyclic (1!2)-b-glucan
structure was determined by Mass spectrometry by
using a Applied Biosystems QTRAP LC/MS/MS system
(Foster City, USA) consisting of an hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap (QqQ LIT ) mass spectrometer
equipped with an electros pray ion source (Turbo IonSpray). This structure was later confirmed by literature
data [34].

M phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 (Sigma) and 50 μl of 2.33
mg ml-1 o-toluidine. After 30 min incubation at 37°C,
1.5 ml of water was added to the samples and absorption was measured at 420 nm in a Perkin Elmer Lambda
25 UV/Vis spectrophotometer and compared to glucose
standards in a concentration range of 0-300 μg ml -1 .
Finally, trehalose content was inferred from the glucose
content by performing a standard curve with commercial trehalose (Sigma) ranging from 1 to 5 mM. Trehalose concentration was expressed as μmol mg protein-1.
Isolation of the otsA and 16S rRNA genes

Determination of protein content

To estimate total cell proteins, each rhizobial strain was
grown at 28°C in its optimal minimal medium until late
exponential/early stationary phase. The same culture
was used for determination of both trehalose and protein content. Cell protein content was determined by triplicate by using the “Test-tube procedure” of the
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce). Cell
suspensions (1 ml) were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 4
min and the supernatant was removed. Cell pellets were
dried overnight at 100°C and resuspended in 1 ml of
demineralized water by shaking at room temperature for
30 min. After addition of 2 ml of the BCA reagent to
100 μl samples, incubation was done at 37°C (standard
protocol, working range of 20-2,000 μg protein ml-1) or
60°C (enhanced protocol, working range of 5-250 μg
protein ml-1) for 30 min. Then, absorption of samples
was measured at 562 nm in a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25
UV/Vis spectrophotometer and compared to protein
standards containing bovine serum albumin in a concentration range of 0-600 μg ml-1.
Extraction and determination of intracellular trehalose
content

Trehalose determination was performed basically as
described by Blázquez et al. [52] by the following procedure. Cell pellets from 15 ml of early stationary phase
cultures in their optimal minimal medium were washed
with isotonic carbon-free medium and resuspended in 1
ml of the same medium. Cells were lysed by 30 min
incubation at 95°C and, after centrifugation, trehalose
was assayed in a 200 μl total volume reaction containing
100 μl of the supernatant, 90 μl of 25 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.6) and 0.02 U of commercial trehalase
(Sigma). For each culture sample, endogenous glucose
content was monitored by performing a parallel reaction
in which trehalase was substituted by water. After overnight incubation at 37°C, glucose released by trehalose
hydrolysis was determined on 150 μl of the previous
reaction by addition of 150 μl of a glucose oxidase/peroxidase mixture (0.66 mg ml-1) Aspergillus niger glucose
oxidase and 0.25 mg ml-1 horseradish peroxidase in 0.5

Total DNA was isolated by using the CTAB method
[53]. Amplification of about 1-kb of the otsA gene from
R. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a3, R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c3, and R. etli 12a3 was performed by using the
primers OTA1: 5’-ATC TGG ATG GGA TGG TCG
GGA-3’ and OTA2: 5’-GAC ATA TTC CTT GGC AAC
GAG GTT-3’. For strain CIAT 899, otsA was amplified
by using the degenerated primers: OTAS1: 5’-CAT CTG
GAT GGG (CT)TG GTC GG-3’ and OTAS2: 5’-GGC
GAC ATA TTC CTT GGC (GC)AC (GC)AG GTT-3’.
The amplification protocol consisted of the following
steps: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min followed by
30 cycles of denaturation (45 seconds at 94°C), annealing (45 seconds at 58°C), extension (1 min at 72°C), and
a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Sequencing of
the otsA genes was performed by the company Newbiotechnics (NBT, Seville, Spain). PCR amplifications of the
complete 16S rRNA genes were carried out as previously described [54]. The PCR products were used as
templates in sequencing reactions with internal primers
to get partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene (NBT,
Seville, Spain). The resulting overlapping sequences
were analyzed by using the ChromasPro software (version 1.34) to assemble the complete 16S rRNA gene of
each strain.
Phylogenetic analysis

The 16S rRNA gene and OtsA protein sequences were
used as queries for BLAST searches at the NCBI
(National Center for Biotechnology Information) web
server http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Homologous and
validated (for 16S rRNA) sequences showing a high
degree of similarity were included in the phylogenetic
analyses. 16S rRNA-based and OtsA-based phylogenetic
analyses were conducted by using the MEGA 4 software
[55]. Nucleotide (16SrRNA) alignments were constructed with Clustal W (1.6). The tree was constructed
by using the neighbor-joining method [56] and the evolutionary distances were computed using the two-parameter method [57]. The rate variation among sites was
modeled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter =
0.25) and all positions containing alignment gaps and

missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence
comparisons. The robustness of the tree branches was
assessed by performing bootstrap analysis of the neighbor-joining data based on 1000 resamplings [58]. There
were a total of 1469 positions in the final dataset. The
partial OtsA protein-coding sequences were aligned
with Clustal W (1.6) using a BLOSUM62 matrix and
manually edited. The phylogenetic tree was inferred
using the neighbor-joining method and the evolutionary
distances were computed using the Poisson correction
method. The rate variation among sites was modeled
with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 1) and
all the positions containing gaps and missing data were
eliminated from the dataset obtaining a total of 287
positions. The robustness of the tree branches was
assessed by performing bootstrap analysis of the neighbor-joining data based on 1000 resamplings.
