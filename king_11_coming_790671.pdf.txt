Abstract
Background: The process of Greek colonization of the central and western Mediterranean during the Archaic and
Classical Eras has been understudied from the perspective of population genetics. To investigate the Y
chromosomal demography of Greek colonization in the western Mediterranean, Y-chromosome data consisting of
29 YSNPs and 37 YSTRs were compared from 51 subjects from Provence, 58 subjects from Smyrna and 31 subjects
whose paternal ancestry derives from Asia Minor Phokaia, the ancestral embarkation port to the 6th century BCE
Greek colonies of Massalia (Marseilles) and Alalie (Aleria, Corsica).
Results: 19% of the Phokaian and 12% of the Smyrnian representatives were derived for haplogroup E-V13,
characteristic of the Greek and Balkan mainland, while 4% of the Provencal, 4.6% of East Corsican and 1.6% of West
Corsican samples were derived for E-V13. An admixture analysis estimated that 17% of the Y-chromosomes of
Provence may be attributed to Greek colonization. Using the following putative Neolithic Anatolian lineages: J2aDYS445 = 6, G2a-M406 and J2a1b1-M92, the data predict a 0% Neolithic contribution to Provence from Anatolia.
Estimates of colonial Greek vs. indigenous Celto-Ligurian demography predict a maximum of a 10% Greek
contribution, suggesting a Greek male elite-dominant input into the Iron Age Provence population.
Conclusions: Given the origin of viniculture in Provence is ascribed to Massalia, these results suggest that E-V13
may trace the demographic and socio-cultural impact of Greek colonization in Mediterranean Europe, a
contribution that appears to be considerably larger than that of a Neolithic pioneer colonization.

Background
The collapse of the Late Bronze Age societies of the
Eastern Mediterranean (circa 1200 BCE) led to a cascade of initial demographic retrenchment then expansion, particularly among the Phoenicians of the coastal
Levant and the Greeks of the Aegean Sea [1]. Both the
Greeks and Phoenicians established a set of partitioned
colonies along the coast of Mediterranean Europe and
North Africa and engaged in extensive trade of a variety
of goods including tin and other minerals, wine and

olive oil [2]. The Greeks, at the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE founded cities along the Asia Minor (Anatolian) coast, divided into the Aeolian cities of
northwest Anatolia, the Ionian cities of central western
Anatolia and the Dorian cities of southwest Anatolia
[1,3]. Although the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia of
southern Italy and Sicily were established from a mixture of predominantly Dorian cities of the Aegean, the
Peloponnesus and central Greece, the historical attestation of the Greek colonization of the western Mediterranean coastal regions of Provence, Spain and Corsica
indicates a dominant influence from the Ionian city of
Phokaia (AKA Focia, Phocaea) (Figure 1) [4]. The Phokaian Greeks founded the city of Massalia circa 600 BCE
at the location of the present city of Marseille and Alalie
circa 560 BCE on the eastern coast of Corsica [4].

Figure 1 Map showing locations of the Asia Minor Greek cities, Phokaia and Smyrna, in blue, and their western Mediterranean
colonies, in red, as well as source populations studied in Greece and Turkey (in yellow). Putative source populations including Basques,
central Anatolians, and Mediterranean Anatolians are designated with black circles. Inset shows the 4 districts in Provence from which samples
were collected.

Here the Phokaians encountered and interacted with the
indigenous Celto-Ligurian populations, as evidenced by
large caches of wine amphora, which the local tribes distributed along the Rhone River and the Mediterranean
coast [5].
Few genetic studies have explored the Greek contribution to the modern populations of Italy and France.
A recent study of Y-chromosome haplogroups in a Sicilian population [6] showed a major impact of presumptive Greek immigration to the island estimated by
admixture analysis to be about 37% using a localized
Balkan/Greek marker E-V13. This level of admixture
was higher than that predicted by classical demographic
studies. Previous Y-chromosome genetic studies of
Phoenician colonization have demonstrated that haplogroup J2 frequency was amplified in regions containing the Phoenician colonies of Iberia and North Africa
in comparison to areas not containing Phoenician colonies [7]. However, these studies did not address the role
of either Greek colonization or early Neolithic colonization of Western Europe.
Y-chromosome studies have investigated the contribution of various Y haplogroups to the spread of farming
from the Near East to Europe [8-10]. Haplogroup J2 frequency has been correlated with aspects of the symbolic
material culture of the Neolithic in Europe and the Near
East (painted pottery and ceramic figurines) [11] and

sub-Haplogroups of J2 have also been associated with
the Neolithic colonization of mainland Greece, Crete
and southern Italy [12]. On the other hand, E-V13
appears to have originated in Greece or the southern
Balkans [13,14] and then spread to Sicily at high frequencies with the Greek colonization of the island.
E-V13 is also found at low frequencies on the Anatolian
mainland [13] and thus may be useful in teasing apart
the relative contributions of Greek colonization (E-V13)
from Early Neolithic colonization (J2) to Western Europe. In this report, a sampling of individuals whose
ancestry traces to the Ionian Greek city of Phokaia will
be compared through Y-chromosome genotyping to
samples from the Aeolian/Ionian city of Smyrna and a
set of samples from Provence. These data will reveal
genetic patterning characteristic of 1) the Ionian foundation of Phokaia versus the Aeolian/Ionian foundation of
Smyrna. 2) the relative Y chromosome contributions of
Phokaian Greeks and local Anatolian/Neolithic and/or
central Anatolian populations in these two Asia Minor
Greek city-states and 3) the contribution of Greek and/
or Neolithic Y-chromosomes to the demographic pattern of Provence.

Results
The phylogenetic relationships and haplogroup frequencies for the data from the two sites in Asia Minor:

demonstrated that both language/religion and geography
discriminated the sample groups (Table 3).
MDS analyses show that both mainland Greek and
Phokaia separate from the Turkish samples while
Smyrna positions between mainland Greeks and the
Turks (Figure 3). Since the Phokaian and Smyrnian samples could not be distinguished from each other in
terms of Fst, they were aggregated for the subsequent
admixture analyses.
The dominant haplogroup of Provence is R1b-M269
at 58.8% (Figure 2). Also found in Provence is haplogroup E-V13 (3.9%) and J2a-DYS445 = 6 (7.8%). All
the V13 derived samples are from western Provence
along the Rhone, while all the J2a-DYS445 = 6 are from
Var in eastern Provence.
The admixture analysis (Table 4) indicates a high level
of indigenous Basque admixture throughout Provence
(70-90%). Also detected is a 17% contribution of Greek

Phokaia and Smyrna, three mainland Greek sites, the
four regions from Turkey and the Neolithic sites in
Provence are given in Figure 2. Phokaia and Smyrna
have just subtle differences in their haplogroup composition. The dominant haplogroups in both Phokaia and
Smyrna are E-V13 (19.4% and 12.1%) and R1b-M269
(22.6% and 27.8%) respectfully. In addition, J2a is also
common, attaining a frequency of 9.7% in Phokaia and
15.5% in Smyrna. This high frequency of haplogroup
J2a-Page55 (formerly DYS413≤ 18) in Smyrna is characteristic of non-Greek Anatolia. Table 1 describes populations analyzed in this study. The AMOVA (Table 2)
showed no significant distinction between Phokaia and
Smyrna, whereas Smyrna was significantly differentiated
from central Anatolia and Phokaia from western Anatolia. Smyrna also differed from both the Sesklo/Dimini
samples from Thessaly and the Lerna/Franchthi Cave
samples from the Peloponnese. The AMOVA analysis

Phokaia/Smyrna and a 0% Neolithic (central Anatolian
and/or Mediterranean Anatolian) contribution to the
Neolithic sites and surname based Provence samples.
Investigating the apportionment of the pooled data from
Neolithic sites and surname based into eastern Provence
(n = 127) and western Provence (n = 292) the data
showed a 12% Greek component and an 18% Neolithic
component to eastern Provence, while attesting a 19%
Greek component and a 0% Neolithic component to
Western Provence. This does not exclude other sources
of early Neolithic demographic episodes to Provence
such as the radiation of R1b-269 sub lineages [15]. Of
the 323 Y-chromosomes studied in Corsica 4.6% were
derived at E-V13 in east Corsica and 1.6% in west Corsica. The network plot of eight V13 YSTRs for Provence,
Corsica, Smyrna and Phokaia (Figure 4, Additional file 1:
Supplemental Table S1) showed haplotype sharing
among the E-V13 representatives. Coalescent times for
E-V13 in Corsica, Greek Anatolia and Provence are presented in Additional file 2: Supplemental Table S2. The
mean ages are oldest in Greek Anatolia consistent with

Indigenous source

it being a source population. The values should be
viewed as upper bounds. The ages for Corsica and Provence exceed the founding dates from the archeological
record of the Greek colonies in the Mediterranean. This
discordance is most likely a consequence of multiple
E-V13 founders inflating the variance.

Discussion
This study presents the first genetic data on those Greeks
whose ancestry traces to western Anatolia before the
1923 exchange with Turkey. The two sites: Phokaia and
Smyrna have a long established historical record and
represent somewhat different Archaic Greek dialects and
regions. Archaic Smyrna, a small polis of approximately 6
hectares in size, perhaps containing 700 individuals, was
initially Aeolic with a subsequent immigration of Ionic
Greeks from nearby Kolophon [16,17]. Phokaia was a
larger Ionic city-state (50 hectares), containing an estimated 6000 individuals including its surrounding chora,
its agricultural territory [3,16]. Smyrna, on the other
hand, being a smaller polis, may show evidence of

indigenous Anatolian admixture likely from neighbouring
Lydia [17] with higher frequencies of J2a-Page55 derived
chromosomes.
The frequency of J2a-DYS445 = 6 in Phokaia (6.5%) is
comparable to that of central Anatolia (5.5%). Interestingly, the Anatolian Greek samples derived for J2a with
DYS445 = 6 have DYS391 = 9 repeats, while samples
from central Anatolia and Antalya in Mediterranean
Anatolia and Crete, either are equally mixed with
DYS391 = 9/10 or dominated by J2a-DYS445 = 6 with
DYS391 = 10 or more repeats. The similar frequencies
of J2a-DYS445 = 6 in the Greek city-state and Anatolia
make the marker less useful for detecting a pure Neolithic component in other regions; however, the separation by DYS391 offers some utility in teasing apart the
relevant components.
In France, Massalia was the unique initial Greek colony founded by the Phokaians circa 600 BCE [4]. The
initial colony was small, likely 12 hectares in area, but
rapidly expanded during the following century to 40
hectares [5]. Thus, its initial population may have numbered 1000 to 1500 rapidly growing to 5000 people

including its small hinterland chora, later cultivated in
large part with vineyards. In contrast, the departments
of Var, Vaucluse and Bouche-du-Rhone contain an area
of 14,000 square kilometers. During the Roman period,
according to Beloch [18] who estimates a density of 10
individuals per square km in northern Italy, the population might have numbered 140,000. Even with an earlier
600 BCE reduction in population density around Massalia, it is probable that the indigenous Ligurians may
have numbered at least 50,000. This would have yielded
a maximum of 10% Greek input to Provence, much
lower than the estimated 20% Y-chromosome input.
However, this increase in Y-chromosome admixture
from Greece is in accord with the recent results from
Sicily, which estimated a 37% Greece input, in accordance with the demographic estimate of [18,19]. We
acknowledge that population history of Provence has
been influenced by additional demographic events
besides the Neolithic and Greek colonization events. One
potential confound is the impact of the Roman Empire.
However in other regions well known to have been
settled by Romans, e.g. England, southern Spain, Morocco and Sardinia, the frequency of E-V13 ranges from
zero to 1% [13]. The impact of Phoenicians is minimal
since the frequency of E-V13 in Lebanon is zero out of
42 samples (unpublished results, OS). Thus the presence
of E-V13 in the western Mediterranean is most likely driven by Greek colonists. Interestingly the female input,
estimated using mtDNA data may be minimal in Provence. One mtDNA study of Var, showed a negligible
Neolithic (Near Eastern and hence Greek) component to
the mtDNA distribution of Var [20]. Results from a single
locus like the Y chromosome phylogeny must be interpreted cautiously since haplogroup designation and
population are not absolutely equivalent. In addition
founder effects, sex-biased reproduction, sexual selection
can skew the interpretation of a population’s history.
The Greeks of Massalia, between 500 BCE and 300
BCE, conquered a vast nearby area and set up satellite
trading posts, settlements and forts. These sites included
Monoikos (Monaco), Nikaia (Nice), Antipolis (Antibes),
Olbia and Tauroeis [4,5]. The Greeks from Massalia also
engaged in a major trading network along the Mediterranean coast and up the Rhone evidenced by Massaliote
wine amphora and other ceramics [5]. Our data are consistent with a male-mediated asymmetric gene flow into
the indigenous Celto-Ligurian populations of Iron Age
Provence due to possibly differential mating practices,
elite dominance or enslavement.
The island of Corsica contains E-V13 Y-chromosomes,
particularly in the eastern portion of the island at a frequency of 4.6%. Eastern Corsica was the site of a major
Phokaian colony, Alalie, and the E-V13 network pattern
suggests overlap among the regions studied. On the

other hand, using J2a-DYS445 = 6, G-M406 and J2aM92, we detected a Neolithic (Anatolian), impact on the
demography of east Provence. This may be a slight overestimate, since no J2a-M92 or G-M406 derived chromosomes were found in the Provence samples. That said,
the predominant region in which J2a-DYS445 = 6
lineages are present is Var, situated near initial Neolithic
impressed ware sites [21]. West of Var, J2a-DYS445 = 6
frequency drops off precipitously suggesting the demographic impact of Neolithic colonists from Anatolia
does exceed beyond this region. The western districts of
Vaucluse and Bouches du Rhônes contains Mesolithic
sites and later cardial Neolithic package [21]. The high
level of indigenous Basque admixture in Provence is
consistent of a model of the cultural diffusion of agriculture. The lack of Y-chromosome Neolithic markers in
west Provence suggests that the subsequent cardial Neolithic may reflect a cultural adoption of farming in this
area.

Conclusion
The Greeks from both mainland Greece and Anatolia
made a major contribution to the development of

western European culture through their Mediterranean
colonies (Italy, France, and Spain) during the Iron Age.
Haplogroup E-V13 may trace the movement of the
Ionian Greeks to key areas of France and Corsica that
introduced viniculture to Western Europe [22]. Further
studies will help elucidate the relative contribution of
the Greek and Neolithic migrations in other areas of the
western Mediterranean.

Methods
Our population samples included a total of 89 male subjects, currently living in Greece, who trace their grandpaternal ancestry to either the area near Phokaia (n = 31)
or Smyrna (n = 58) prior to the 1923 Exchange of Lausanne. In addition 323 males living throughout Corsica
who trace their paternal ancestry to the island, and
51 subjects from villages near Neolithic sites in Provence
who trace their grand-paternal ancestry to Provence and
the Principality of Monaco were also studied. A total of
23 of the subjects from Provence villages were from the
western departments of Provence: Vaucluse and Bouchedu- Rhone, while 28 apportioned to the eastern departments: Var and Alps-de-Haute-Provence or to Monaco.
Regarding the new samples introduced in this study, the
Anatolian Greek component was approved by the IRB of
Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece. The French
samples were approved by the French Committee for the
Protection of Persons in Biomedical Research (CCPPRB)
and the entire French collection were also declared to
and approved by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research. All subjects gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The location of the
Anatolian Greek, mainland Greek, Turkish and Basques
samples are shown in Figure 1. In addition the locations
of Massalia and its trading posts and the Greek city of
Alalie in Corsica are indicated. Additionally, a description
of populations analyzed in this study is summarized in
Table 1.
All 89 samples from Anatolian Greeks were genotyped
using 29 Y-chromosome binary polymorphisms in a
sequential manner using Y tree branching patterns to
infer upstream haplogroup status. The following binary
markers were genotyped: YAP, M35, V13, M78, M123,

M497, Page55, Page94, and M530 are newly listed SNPs
whose specifications are listed in Additional file 3:
Supplemental Table S3. Binary marker genotyping was
done by RFLP assay, DHPLC or direct sequencing. Each
of the Phokaia and Smyrna samples were typed at
37 YSTRs listed in Additional file 4: Supplemental
Table S4.
The 51 samples from areas near Neolithic sites in
Provence had derived alleles for the following markers:
V13, M34, Page94, M253, M438, M497, M530, M67,
M198 and M269. In order to compare the selected 51
Neolithic samples to a larger Provence set, 368 subjects
from the departments of Provence: Var (n = 68),
Bouche-du-Rhone (n = 209), Vaucluse (n = 60) and
Alps-de-Haute-Provence (n = 31) whose surname was
blindly determined to be of French origin, were genotyped for E-V13, M406, Page94, M423, M269 and all
the following J-lineages: M304, Page55, M267, M12,
M410, M67, M530 and M92 as well as ten YSTRs for
the J and E-V13 derived samples. DYS445 was typed in
M530 derived samples (Schrack B.E., Athey T.W., Wilson J.F., 2006, The American Society of Human Genetics. Abstract). The 323 samples from Corsica were only
typed for E-V13.
An AMOVA [23] was performed using Arlequin 2000
[24] to test the population affinities of the two Anatolian
Greek samples to three mainland Greek samples (Nea
Nikomedeia, Sesklo/Dimini, Lerna/Franchthi Cave), and
four regions of Turkey (western Aegean, Marmara, central
Anatolia and Mediterranean Turkey) [25]. Furthermore a
Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS) (SPSS 18.0) was
performed using the Fst measure as a distance metric
across the 9 populations. An AMOVA comparing the
effects of geography (Asia Minor vs. Mainland Greece)
and religion/language (Christian/Greek vs. Muslim/Turkish) was also calculated using these 9 populations.
To analyze the impact of the attested Greek colonization of Provence, an admixture analysis [26] was conducted using a Basque population (n = 116) [27] as an
indigenous (non-Neolithic pre-Greek) source population
and the Phokaia/Smyrna data as the Greek colonizing
source represented by E-V13 frequency. As a signal of
putative Neolithic immigration to Provence, central
Anatolian and Mediterranean Turkey data [25] were
used. Specifically the following markers M92, M406 and
J2a-(DYS445 = 6) were chosen as indicative of Neolithic
ancestry. The frequencies of M92 and J2a-(DYS445 = 6)
in the Basque population were estimated from their
YSTR pattern [27]. In order to assess the degree of
E-V13 affinity, a 8 loci YSTR network using Phokaia,
Smyrna, Provence and Corsica samples was constructed

Page 7 of 8

[28]. Networks were constructed by the median joining
method using Network 4.5.0.2, where ε = 0 and microsatellite loci were weighted proportionally to the inverse of
the repeat variance observed in each haplogroup [29].
Coalescent times for E-V13 based on the following 8 loci
DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392,
DYS393 and DYS439 were computed using the methodology of Zhivotovsky et al. [30] as modified according to
Sengupta et al. [31]. A microsatellite evolutionary effective
mutation rate of 6.9 × 10-4 per 25 years was used [30].
