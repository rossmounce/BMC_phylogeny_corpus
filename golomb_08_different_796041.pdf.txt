Abstract
Background: Myosins are actin-activated ATPases that use energy to generate force and move
along actin filaments, dragging with their tails different cargos. Plant myosins belong to the group
of unconventional myosins and Arabidopsis myosin VIII gene family contains four members: ATM1,
ATM2, myosin VIIIA and myosin VIIIB.
Results: In transgenic plants expressing GFP fusions with ATM1 (IQ-tail truncation, lacking the
head domain), fluorescence was differentially distributed: while in epidermis cells at the root cap
GFP-ATM1 equally distributed all over the cell, in epidermal cells right above this region it
accumulated in dots. Further up, in cells of the elongation zone, GFP-ATM1 was preferentially
positioned at the sides of transversal cell walls. Interestingly, the punctate pattern was insensitive
to brefeldin A (BFA) while in some cells closer to the root cap, ATM1 was found in BFA bodies.
With the use of different markers and transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, it was
found that myosin VIII co-localized to the plasmodesmata and ER, colocalized with internalized
FM4-64, and partially overlapped with the endosomal markers ARA6, and rarely with ARA7 and
FYVE. Motility of ARA6 labeled organelles was inhibited whenever associated with truncated ATM1
but motility of FYVE labeled organelles was inhibited only when associated with large excess of
ATM1. Furthermore, GFP-ATM1 and RFP-ATM2 (IQ-tail domain) co-localized to the same spots
on the plasma membrane, indicating a specific composition at these sites for myosin binding.
Conclusion: Taken together, our data suggest that myosin VIII functions differently in different
root cells and can be involved in different steps of endocytosis, BFA-sensitive and insensitive
pathways, ER tethering and plasmodesmatal activity.

Background
The Arabidopsis myosin gene family contains 17 members. The myosin XI group, which is related to unconventional myosin V [1,2], includes 13 members while the
myosin VIII group, which is related to unconventional
myosin V [2] but also to myosin VI [1], includes four
members. Both myosin groups VIII and XI are specific to

plants [3]. Typically, the Arabidopsis myosins contain a
conserved motor domain, a number of IQ domains for
light-chain binding, a coiled-coil domain that is predicted
to facilitate their dimerization and a specific tail to bind
the cargo [3]. Plant myosins are generally implicated in
cytoplasmic streaming [4], organelle movement [5-7],

cytokinesis [8-10], plasmodesmatal functioning [10,11],
and endocytosis [10,12,13].

rescence of GFP-ATM1 (IQ-tail) was visible in the roots
but almost undetectable in the shoots and leaves.

Myosin VIII (ATM1) was the first plant myosin to be identified and sequenced [14]. A specific antibody raised
against a peptide corresponding to its unique tail was used
to show, in both immunofluorescence and electron
microscopy studies, that ATM1 was localized to plant-specific structures such as the plasmodesmata and plasma
membrane of newly formed cell walls in root cells of
maize and Arabidopsis [11,15]. ATM1 has also been
found in pit fields in the inner cortex cells of maize root
apices, where it was predicted to be involved in fluidphase endocytosis [12]. In a more recent work, the same
antibody was used to show that in cells of maize root caps,
ATM1 localized around the nuclei but relocated to amyloplasts and to plasmodesmata following 5 min and 90 min
of osmotic stimulus, respectively [16]. The latter suggests
acto-myosin involvement in root osmo-sensing [16].
When ATM1 was fused to GFP, its fluorescence was concentrated mostly at the developing cell plate in BY2 cells
[17]. The four members of myosin VIII are ATM1, ATM2,
myosin VIIIA and myosin VIIIB. While ATM1 is more similar to VIIIA, ATM2 is related to VIIIB both in sequence
and expression pattern.

To verify that the chimera is expressed properly, PCR was
performed on DNA prepared from the transgenic plants
and from wt plants as a control, and compared to PCR of
DNA from the plasmid encoding the chimera used to generate the transgenic plants. Figure 1A shows that the full
length of the expected fragment (1734 bp) was detected in
the PCR using DNA from transgenic plants similar to the
fragment obtained from plasmid DNA. Control plants
were negative. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of the full-length chimera (~57 kDa) and showed
that the level of expression of the GFP-ATM1 chimera in
transgenic plants is very low compared to the expression
of GFP alone in control plants (Figure 1B). Because of the
lack of good anti ATM1 antibodies in our hands, no comparison to endogenous protein's level of expression was
done. Confocal-microscope images of roots of the transgenic plants revealed that the chimera GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail)
is differentially localized in different cells. While in epidermis cells at the root cap fluorescence was equally distributed all over the cell, in epidermal cells right above
this region fluorescence accumulated in dots or aggregates
of 850 ± 150 nm in diameter. Further up, in cells of the
elongation zone, GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail) was preferentially
positioned at transverse cell walls (Figure 2A, B and 2C).
This pattern of GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail) subcellular distribution was found in roots of 5-day-old (Figure 2A) and 20day-old (Figure 2B and 2C) seedlings, including the lateral roots (Figure 2B) of 20-day-old seedlings. When a
three dimension image of figure 2B was constructed and
rotated around its axis, it could be distinguished that the
dots were scattered around the cells making it difficult to
distinguish between membrane and cytoplasmic specific
localization (Additional file 1). In root hairs, GFPATM1(IQ-tail) also formed a pattern of dots (Figure 2D).

In this work, we followed myosin VIII using GFP fusions.
We show that in transgenic plants expressing GFPATM1(IQ-tail) fluorescence is differentially localized in
different root cells. Sensitivity to BFA also differed
between root cells. When transiently expressed in N.
benthamiana, GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail) was found in pit fields
accumulating callose, and co-localized with the ER. ATM1
also co-localized with internalized FM4-64 and partially
co-localized with the endosomal markers ARA6, and
rarely with ARA7 and FYVE. Furthermore, truncated ATM1
inhibited the motility of associated ARA6 labeled
organelles but could be found on motile FYVE labeled
organelles. Only large excess of ATM1 associated with
FYVE labeled organelles arrested their motility. Taken
together our data suggest that myosin VIII differentially
functions in different cells and can be involved in different steps of endocytosis, BFA sensitive and insensitive
pathways, ER tethering and in plasmodesmatal activity.

Results
Transgenic plants expressing GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail)
Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GFP-ATM1(IQtail) were generated. Among tens of seedlings resistant to
kanamycin, only one seedling expressed detectable levels
of GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail), suggesting some cytotoxicity of the
mutant molecule. GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail) was expressed and
passed on to subsequent generations but no significant
phenotypes or changes in cell morphology relative to
wild-type (wt) plants were observed. Interestingly, fluo-

Differential sensitivity of ATM1 to BFA in different root
cells
Unlike in several other species where BFA treatment leads
to redistribution of Golgi proteins to the ER [18], in Arabidopsis root cells, BFA leads to the formation of BFAbodies that are derived from endosomal membranes and
accumulate endocytosed markers [19-22]. Thus it has
been shown that the BFA-sensitive process in Arabidopsis
is endosomal trafficking [19,20,22-24]. Since myosin VIII
has been implicated in endocytosis [10,12,13] we
addressed the question of whether BFA treatment would
affect the specific subcellular organization of GFPATM1(IQ-tail) in the different root cells and whether
ATM1 would be found in the BFA bodies. Figure 3A, B and
3C shows that BFA treatment did not disrupt the punctate
pattern of ATM1 and no ATM1 was found in the BFA bodies formed in these particular cells; suggesting that here,

genic seedling expressing GFP alone were treated with BFA
and FM4-64. In these plants GFP was diffused all over the
cytoplasm of root cells where BFA bodied were detected
(Additional file 2). To check whether ATM1 is involved in
different steps of endocytosis, we used a variety of different endosomal markers.

Verification of GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail) expression in
transgenic plants. A. PCR was performed using a forward
primer corresponding to the 5' end of GFP starting from the
ATG and a reverse primer corresponding to the 3' end of
ATM1 including its stop codon. The size of the expected
fragment was 1734 bp. The template DNA was as follows:

ATM1's function is BFA-independent. In contrast, in cells
closer to the root cap where ATM1 was equally distributed
all over the cell before BFA treatment, after BFA treatment
it was found in BFA bodies (Figure 3D, E and 3F). This
suggests that in these cells, ATM1 is BFA-sensitive and
might be involved in endosomal trafficking at specific
developmental stages. For comparison and control, trans-

Sub-cellular localization of ATM1 transiently expressed in
N. benthamiana
When fluorescent chimeras (GFP or RFP) of ATM1(IQtail) were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves
using Agrobacterium infiltration, fluorescence accumulated as dots (or aggregates of dots) on the plasma membrane of abaxial leaf epidermal cells (Figure 4A). To verify
whether this is a general pattern of localization for myosin
VIII members, we checked ATM2, myosin VIIIA and
myosin VIIIB. ATM2 and ATM1 gave a similar pattern of
dots (590 ± 180 nm in diameter) while myosin VIIIA
formed smaller dots (330 ± 50 nm in diameter) (Figure 4B
and 4C). Myosin VIIIB was very similar to myosin VIIIA
(not shown). The vast majority of ATM1 fluorescent dots
were stationary but rarely, less than 1% of the dots were
motile (Additional file 3). The family members of myosin
VIII exhibit different expression patterns as shown by genevestigator analysis (Additional file 4) [25]. While ATM1
and myosin VIIIA are similarly expressed in most organs,
ATM2 and myosin VIIIB are more highly expressed in pollen and to a lesser extent in the stamen and root hairs
(Additional file 4). It was thus interesting to determine
whether the dots formed by ATM1 and ATM2 overlap in
N. benthamiana leaves. GFP-ATM1 and RFP-ATM2 were
therefore co-expressed in these leaves, and both localized
to the same specific spots on the plasma membrane (Figure 4D–F). This suggests the existence of specific foci at
the plasma membrane that are able to bind both myosins.
Interestingly, when the ATM1 fluorescent chimera was coexpressed with an ER marker, ERD2-GFP [26], the punctate labeling pattern of ATM1 correlated with the ER (Figure 4G–I). The same picture was observed with ATM2 (not
shown). Using aniline blue to stain callose [27], ATM1
was shown to accumulate in plasmodesmata-enriched pit
fields (Figure 4J–L). To extend our view on the possible
involvement of ATM1 in endocytosis the membrane dye
FM4-64 was used to follow membrane internalization.
ATM1 was found not only at the plasma membrane, but
also in the cytoplasm where it co-localized with internalized FM4-64 (Figure 5A–C). In addition, fluorescent chimeras of ATM1 were co-expressed with the endosomal
markers ARA6-GFP and GFP-ARA7, Rab5 orthologs from
Arabidopsis [28], and DsRed-FYVE. The FYVE domain is a
conserved protein motif characterized by its ability to
bind with high affinity and specificity to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (Pi(3)P), a phosphoinositide that is
highly enriched in early endosomes [29] and has been
shown to co-localize with ARA7 and with internalized

than 1% of the labeled organelles, colocalization with

ATM1 was observed (Figure 5D–F, G–I). Generally, the
motility of FYVE and ARA7 labeled organelles was not
affected by the presence of truncated ATM1 in the same

cell, probably because most of them were not colocalized
(Additional file 5). However, occasionally both motile
organelles co-labeled with FYVE and ATM1 (Additional
file 6), and motionless FYVE labeled bodies surrounded
by excess of GFP-ATM1 could be detected (Additional file
7). About 80–90% of ARA6 labeled organelles colocalized
with ATM1 at or close to the plasma membrane (Figure
5J–L). Importantly, while ARA6 labeled organelles were
highly motile in the absence of GFP-ATM1 (additional file
8), in the presence of ATM1, all co-labeled organelles,
became motionless and only those free from ATM1
remained motile (Additional file 9). The above suggests a
major role for ATM1 in the function of ARA6 labeled
endosomes and a minor role in the function of ARA7/
FYVE labeled endosomes [31].

Discussion
Here, we studied transgenic plants expressing a chimera of
GFP fused to a truncated myosin VIII – the IQ-tail domain
of ATM1. This mutant molecule, lacking the head, motor
domain that bind actin but containing the neck and tail
domains, is expected to bind to its cellular targets and
function as dominant negative by blocking wt myosin
binding. Indeed, among many seedlings expressing the
gene for antibiotic resistance, only one was found expressing the fluorescent chimera of myosin, at very low levels.
This might be the result of a cytotoxic effect of the mutant.
The fact that no detectable phenotypes were observed in
the plants expressing the mutant myosin was a surprise,
but might be explained by the low level of expression. In
this regard, it should be mentioned that when other trun-

cated myosins were expressed in plant cells, no significant
inhibition of organellar movement was observed [32]
suggesting redundancy in myosin's function. In the transgenic plants, we show differential localization and function of ATM1 in root cells. Similar differential localization
was shown for myosin VIII in maize roots stained with
anti myosin VIII antibody where it was found to be distributed diffusely in root cap cells but appeared as fine
spots in the distal part of the apical meristem, in cells of
the inner cortex, and in the distal part of the elongation
region [11].
In view of its differential sensitivity to BFA in different
root cells and its co-localization with different endosomal
markers, we propose that ATM1 participates in various
stages of endosomes biogenesis and function. We confirm
previous data that myosin VIII resides at the plasma membrane and is enriched in plasmodesmata [11,12,15,33]. In
addition, we confirm a previous conclusion that myosin
VIII is involved in endocytosis [13] and participates in
tethering cortical elements of the ER to the plasma membrane [10].
ATM1 at the plasma membrane and endosomes
Based on their findings, Dieter Volkmann and co-workers
concluded that myosin VIII may be less important for
intracellular motility and more involved in the anchoring
of actin filaments at cell peripheries [15]. They predicted
another possible role for myosin VIII in forming a structural support for the cortical ER elements tightly underlying the plasma membrane, both outside and inside the
plasmodesmata [10]. They also suggested that myosin VIII
might drive invagination of the plasma membrane during
fluid-phase endocytosis [12].

While ATM1 is more or less equally expressed in all plant
organs, ATM2 show specificity to male reproductive
organs (Additional figure 2). Other gene families of
cytoskeletal proteins show differential expression in vegetative and reproductive tissues, such as actin [34], profilin
[35,36] and myosin XI (genevestigator expression profiles
[25]). We provide evidence here that both ATM1 and
ATM2 co-localize at specific sites on the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaf.
This is the first time that two plant myosins have been
shown to co-localize at the same spots on the plasma
membrane, suggesting a unique composition of the
plasma membrane at these sites. The myosin VIII-labeled
spots on the plasma membrane might be sites where the
cortical actin fibers are linked to the plasma membrane
such as "focal contacts" [10,37,38], sites of endocytosis
[31], sterol-enriched complexes [24] or something else
that we do not yet know about. Since our myosin constructs do not contain the head domain which is the actin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/3

binding domain, we could not use them to address the
question of actin binding to the plasma membrane.
In addition, we show co-localization of ATM1 (Figure
5G–I) with the ER in N. benthamiana leaves. When BDM
(2,3-Butanedione 2-monoxime) which is a general inhibitor of myosin ATPases of eukaryotic cells, was applied to
growing maize roots, alterations of the typical distribution patterns of myosin VIII, actin filaments and cortical
ER elements associated with plasmodesmata and pit fields
were observed [39]. Nevertheless, as shown here, the
expressed GFP-ATM1 which is a mutant molecule lacking
the head, actin binding domain, did not disrupt the ER
network. This suggests that myosin VIII is necessary but
not essential for anchoring the cortical ER to the plasma
membrane [40] and that other proteins with overlapping
functions are there. Since ER spans the plasmodesmata
[41] it further suggests close relationships between ATM1
and the ER. Plasmodesmatal myosin VIII was postulated
to be involved in regulating conductivity by the force it
can generate to control the spacing between desmotubules and plasma membrane [11]. Our data suggest that
the cross talk between ER and myosin VIII is not limited
to plasmodesmata because colocalization was observed at
the outer membrane of epidermal cells. Two models have
been proposed for the role of myosin V in ER localization
and movement in yeast and animal cells; in model-A
Myosin V actively transport ER tubules, while in model-B
myosin V plays a role in tethering ER to the cell surface
[42]. The prediction is that in plants, myosin XI plays the
role of model-A while myosin VIII the role of model-B.
In root hairs (Figure 1D) GFP-ATM1 formed punctuate
pattern along the cell. The clear zone of root hairs tip is
rich in membrane recycling activity and organelles
marked by the endosomal marker FYVE [30]. Myosin XI
was also found in the clear zone of pollen tubes [43]. The
presence of ATM1 in the clear zone of elongating root
hairs should be carefully analyzed.
When ATM1 was co-expressed with different endosomal
markers, partial co-localization was found with ARA6,
and rarely with ARA7 and FYVE. Endosomes in mammalian cells are categorized into four classes; early endosomes, late endosomes, recycling endosomes and
lysosomes [44]. In plants there is no similar classification,
and the functional differences between endosomes is not
clear. The Rab5 small GTPases typically regulate early
endosomes [45] and ARA6 and ARA7, which are plant
Rab5 orthologs, localize to different and partially overlapping sub-populations of endosomes [28,46]. While ARA6
co-localized with SNARE proteins characteristic of the prevacuolar compartment (PVC), ARA7 did not [46]. This
suggested that ARA7 labels an earlier endosomal compartment [46]. Indeed it has been shown that in plants, the

routes of endocytosis and vacuolar transport merge at the
PVC [47]. However, when ARA7 was co-expressed with
other PVC markers – PS1-GFP [48] or AtPEP12p:HA [49],
it was also detected in the PVC. In our working system,
ATM1 was mainly detected at the plasma membrane in a
punctate pattern; however, it was also observed in the
cytoplasm, albeit rarely. The dots of cytoplasmic GFPATM1 were co-localized with internalized FM4-64 and
rarely with the markers FYVE and ARA7. Co-localization
of ATM1 with ARA6 was pronounced and seemed to be at
the plasma membrane. Indeed it was previously indicated
that GFP-ARA6 resides on the plasma membrane and also
on the ER [28] whereas Ara7 and Rha1 are different [46].
By showing preference of ATM1 to ARA6 labeled endosomes and by demonstrating that each ARA6 labeled
organelle loose its motility when associated with truncated ATM1 while FYVE labeled organelles can remain
mobile although associated with ATM1 and only large
excess of truncated ATM1 could arrest their motility, we
provide another evidence for the presence of different
subpopulation of endosomes [46]. Our data suggests that
ATM1 is more crucial for the motility of ARA6 containing
endosomes and plays only a minor role, if at all, in the
function of FYVE/ARA7 containing endosomes. Importantly, the observation that ARA6-GFP partially co-labeled
BFA-induced structures in roots [24] is in agreement with
our findings of the association of ATM1 with ARA6-GFP
on the one hand, and with BFA bodies in specific root cells
on the other hand.
The partial localization of ATM1 to different vesicles
marked by ARA6, ARA7 or FYVE and to BFA bodies suggests that it has a role in the motility of endosomes at different stages of maturation and in endosomal recycling to
the plasma membrane [19,20,22-24]. A dual role in endocytosis, both at the plasma membrane and in endosomal
motility, has been suggested for myosin VI [50,51], which
is phylogenetically close to myosin VIII [1]. Myosin VI is
implicated in both the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane and the movement of nascent uncoated vesicles from the actin-rich cell periphery to
the early endosome in animal cells [50,51]. Interestingly,
myosin VI was found to move toward actin's minus end
[52] in a processive manner [53]. The latter functions are
still not known for myosin VIII.
Possible differential roles for myosin VIII in different root
cells
Plant roots are very sophisticated sensors that are able to
perceive various different environmental and soil cues
such as gravitation force, touch, water potential and
osmolarity. Gravity-sensing is done by specialized cells
that are located within the columella root cap. The signal
is perceived by specialized cells, statocytes, containing
specific amyloplasts, statoliths that sediment in these cells

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/3

according to the gravitation force [54]. The gravity perceived signal is transmitted from the columela cells by a
mobile auxin signal to the cells at the elongation zone
[55]. The actin meshwork is believed to be the cellular
structure that sedimenting amyloplasts pass through or
interact with to trigger the downstream signaling events
leading to root orientation [56]. There is also accumulating evidence that the transport of auxin, is regulated by
actin [24,57-59]. Thus the differential localization of
ATM1 in root cap and elongating cells might reflect the
different roles that it plays as part of the actin cytoskeleton
during signaling perception. We did not detected particular phenotypes related to gravitropism in the GFP-ATM1
(IQ-tail) plants. Although ATM1 seems to have polarized
localization to transverse walls in cells at the elongation
zone its role in the polarized accumulation of auxin transporters [19,24] is still to be determined. It was also shown
that touch stimulation but not gravity-stimulation led to
transient increases in Ca2+ ions in root cells [60] and that
the increase induced in the cap cells was larger and longerlived than in cells in the meristematic or elongation zone
[60]. The touch induced calmodulin like protein 2
(TCH2) [61] was found by us to interact with the IQ
domains of ATM1 in a calcium regulated manner [62].
Thus ATM1 can be involved in differential touch
responses in the different root cells, being regulated by
TCH2 as a light chain. ATM1 was also shown to be responsive to osmo-signals specifically in root-cap cells where it
was found to be recruited to plastids surfaces following
stimulation [16]. The dotted pattern seen in some of the
root cells was identified by an anti myosin VIII antibody
in maize roots[11,15] as plasmodesmata enriched pit
fields. Using a specific stain for callose we confirmed the
presence of ATM1 in pit fields of N. benthamiana leaves,
however, in the transgenic plants, ATM1 fluorescent dots
are scattered all over the cell. Thus we don't know precisely, what is the different function that ATM1 plays in
these particular cells. Also, not all cells in the "belt" of
cells showing dotted pattern of GFP-ATM1 were dotted,
the reason might be the absence of synchronization in
their developmental stage.

Conclusion
While a truncated GFP fusion of ATM1 lacking the head
domain can be expressed by plants that remain normal, it
was found to be a useful probe for ATM1's behavior in
root cells. Using these plants it is shown here, in live cells,
that ATM1 changes its localization in root epidermal cells
as they develop. This change in localization is accompanied by a change in sensitivity to BFA, indicating on a
functional modification. Further this work provide evidence using microscopy of live cells, that Myosin VIII is
preferentially involved in the function of ARA6 associated
endosomes and is localized to ER and pit fields rich in
plasmodesmata.

Methods
Plant material
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 were seeded on MS
(Murashige & Skoog) media, incubated 4 days at 4°C in
the dark and then transferred to a growth room at 24°C
under 16 h light/8 h dark. After 7–10 days, seedlings were
transferred to pots with peat and grown in a temperaturecontrolled (23°C) greenhouse under continuous light.

Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in peat in a controlled growth room at 25°C with optimum light for 16 h
daily.
Plasmids
In order to fuse the IQ-tail domain of ATM1 to GFP, we
used a cDNA clone kindly provided by Dieter Volkmann
(University of Bonn, Germany) and the following primers: Fwd-GGG GTA CCC GTA CTC TCC ACG GCA TT and
Rev-CGG GAT CCG TGC TTG GGA ATG CTG CC. The
resulting fragment was ligated downstream of GFP using
KpnI and BamHI into the plasmid ART7 containing GFP
with a linker of 10XAla at its C terminus. Similarly, ATM1
was ligated to ART7 containing RFP cherry [63] with a
linker of 10XAla at its C terminus. The ATM2 IQ-tail
domain was isolated from Arabidopsis RNA using RT-PCR
and the following primers: Fwd-GGG GTA CCA GGA AAA
AGG TTC TTC AAG GC and Rev-CGG GAT CCC TAG CCT
CTT TTT CCC CA. Similar clones of myosin VIIIA were isolated using these primers: Fwd-GGGGTACCCAGA
TTGGGGTTCTTGAAGAT,
and
Rev-CGGGATCCTTAATACCTAGTA CTCCTCAA. And for myosinVIIIB FwdGGGGTACCGTAATTAGCG TCCTTGAGGAA, and RevCGGGATCCTCAATAACTTTTCTTGCACCA. These were
fused to either GFP or RFP as described for ATM1.

The entire expression cassettes containing the fluorescent
chimeras under the regulation of the 35S promoter were
then transferred to the binary vector pART27 using a NotI
cleavage. The plasmid encoding DsRED-FYVE was provided by Josef Samaj from the University of Bonn [30].
Plasmids encoding GFP fusions of ARA7 and ARA6 were
provided by Takashi Ueda from RIKEN, Japan [28]. The
plasmid encoding the GFP fusion of the H/KDEL receptor,
ERD2-GFP, was provided by Chris Hawes from Oxford
Brookes University, UK [26].
Plant DNA and RNA preparation
DNA was prepared as follows: two to three fresh mature
leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder
and dissolved in a mixture containing: extraction buffer
(350 mM sorbitol, 100 mM Tris PH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA pH
7.5), Nuclei lysis buffer (200 mM Tris PH 7.5, 50 mM
EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 2% CTAB) and 5% N-lauroylsarcosine
at 1:1:0.4 ratio. After 15 min incubation at 65°C, chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction was performed. DNA was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/3

precipitated in isopropanol and re-suspended in sterile
ddH2O. Total RNA was prepared as follows: 2.5 gr of
plant tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder and incubated 10 min in 20 ml hot (65°C) CTAB
buffer (2% PVP, 2% CTAB, 2 M NaCl, 25 mM EDTA PH8,
0.1 M Tris PH8). Chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction
was followed and RNA was precipitated in 2.5 M LiCl. The
pellet was re-dissolved in SSTE buffer (1 mM EDTA, 10
mM Tris PH8 1 M NaCl, 0.5% SDS) and additional chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction was performed. RNA
was precipitated in ethanol and NH4Ac and the pellet was
dissolved in sterile double distilled ddH2O. Poly-A RNA
was isolated using Oligotex kit of Qiagen (Cat No. 7002)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was
performed using the SuperScript reverse transcriptase of
Invitrogen (Cat No. 18064-022).
Western blot analysis
The amount of 250 mg of seedlings of transgenic plants
was grinded to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. The powder was boild in 200 µl of Laemmli's protein sample
buffer [64] for 10 min and then centrifuged 10 min at 14
krpm in room temp. A sample (30 µl) of the extract was
separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose
membrane. GFP fusion proteins were detected with anti
GFP antibody (Santa Cruz), and a secondary HRP conjugated antibody (Jacksom ImmunoResearch). For chemiluminescent reaction, the SuperSignal kit (Pierce) was used.
Fluorescent microscopy and staining
An IX81/FV500 laser-scanning microscope (Olympus)
was used to observe fluorescently labeled cells. The following filter sets were used: for observing GFP, 488 nm
excitation and BA505-525; RFP, 543 nm excitation and
BA610; FM4-64, 488 or 515 nm excitation and BA660.
The objective used was PlanApo 60 × 1.00 WLSM 8/0.17.
To observe aniline blue we used 405 nm excitation and
BA430-460, using objective UPlanSApo 60 × 1.35 oil, 8/
0.17 FN26.5. When GFP and RFP were detected in the
same sample, we used DM (dichroic mirror) 488/543 and
when aniline blue was added, DM 405/488/543/633 was
used. In all cases, where more than one color was monitored, sequential acquisition was performed. FM4-64
(Molecular Probes) staining was performed at a final concentration of 8 µM for 5–20 min. Callose was stained by
incubating leaf segments for 40 min in a mixture of 0.1%
aniline blue in ddH2O and 1 M glycine, pH 9.5, at a volumetric ratio of 2:3, and pre-mixed for at least 1 d before
use [27]. BFA (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of
50 µM for 50 min. in the presence of 4 µM of FM4-64.
Agrobacterium infiltration into N. benthamiana leaves
The fluorescent chimeras were expressed using Agrobacterium infiltration. Briefly: Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain
GV3101 was transformed with the plasmid and grown at

28°C for 48 h. Bacterial culture originating from one colony was grown, precipitated and dissolved to an OD600 of
0.5 in the following buffer: 50 mM MES, pH 5.6, 0.5%
glucose, 2 mM NaPO4 and 100 µM acetosyringone (cat.
no. D13440-6, Sigma Aldrich). Leaves of 3-week-old N.
benthamiana plants were infiltrated with the bacterial culture using a 1-ml syringe. Expression of the fluorescent
chimera in the leaf cells was detectable after 24 h, peaking
at 48 h.
Transgenic Arabidopsis plants
Arabidopsis plants were transformed as previously
described [65]. A culture of Agrobacterium GV3101 was
grown in 1 liter of LB for 24 h at 28°C. The bacteria were
precipitated at 5000 rpm for 15 min and dissolved to an
OD600 of 0.8 in the following buffer: 5% sucrose, 10 mM
MgCl2, and 0.044 µM BA (benzylamino purine). The
detergent Silwet L-77 (LHELE SEEDS Texas USA) was
added to a final concentration of 0.03%. Plants at the
closed-flower-bud stage were dipped in the Agrobacterium solution for 5 min. The plants were then covered
with plastic bags and transferred to controlled growth
conditions. After 48 h, the bags were removed and after 1
month, seeds were collected. Seeds were sterilized in 1%
NaClO for 5 min and washed three times with sterile
H2O. Seeds (~5000) were plated on 10-cm Petri dishes
with MS, the relevant antibiotics and 500 µg/ml claforan
(Aventis) to prevent Agrobacterium growth. Antibioticresistant seedlings were transferred to a new Petri dish and
scanned for GFP or RFP expression under a fluorescent
binocular.
