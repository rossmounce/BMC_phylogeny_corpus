Abstract

A policy of 'open annotation', using the internet as the forum
for annotation, and bringing annotation into the mainstream
has been suggested as a means to eliminate the restraints of
manual annotation and to develop high quality gene annotation [13-15]. Several systems have successfully adopted this
policy for prokaryote gene annotation (ASAP [16], PeerGAD

information

Gene structure determination is particularly difficult for
eukaryotic genomes. Here, we focus on protein-coding genes.
In higher eukaryotes, most of these genes contain introns,
and a large fraction of the genes appear to permit alternative
splicing [1-3]. High-throughput computational gene structure annotation has been highly successful in providing a first
glimpse of the gene content of a genome, but current methods
fall short of the goal of complete and accurate gene structure

annotation (for example, [4-6]). Recent research has focused
on improving prediction sensitivity and specificity by combining multiple sources of evidence [7-9]. However, complexities of transcription and pre-mRNA processing, such as
introns in non-coding regions, non-canonical splice sites, and
utilization of alternative splice sites, still pose formidable
challenges for merely computational methods. Re-annotation
efforts for most eukaryotic model genomes have, therefore,
relied in large part on manual inspection of gene structure
evidence [5,10,11]. However, manual annotation also has
shortcomings, such as being typically time-consuming, having exclusive participation, and providing annotations only
intermittently [4,10,12].

interactions

Complete and accurate gene structure annotation is a prerequisite for the success of many types of genomic projects. For
example, gene expression studies based on gene probes
would be misleading unless the gene probes uniquely labelled
distinct genes. Identification of potential transcription signals relies on correct determination of transcriptional start
and termination sites. Characterization of orthologs or paralogs and other studies of molecular phylogeny are also compromised by incomplete or inaccurate gene structure
annotation.

Rationale

deposited research

Your Gene structure Annotation Tool for Eukaryotes (yrGATE) provides an Annotation Tool and
Community Utilities for worldwide web-based community genome and gene annotation.
Annotators can evaluate gene structure evidence derived from multiple sources to create gene
structure annotations. Administrators regulate the acceptance of annotations into published gene
sets. yrGATE is designed to facilitate rapid and accurate annotation of emerging genomes as well
as to confirm, refine, or correct currently published annotations. yrGATE is highly portable and
supports different standard input and output formats. The yrGATE software and usage cases are
available at http://www.plantgdb.org/prj/yrGATE.

[17], PseudoCAP [18]). Eukaryotic gene annotation projects
have not been able to reap the full benefits of community
manual annotation because of the absence of an open online
community gene annotation system. Here, we describe newly
developed software, Your Gene structure Annotation Tool for
Eukaryotes (yrGATE), which seeks to compensate for the
inadequacies of traditional manual annotation and to provide
a community alternative and/or companion to computational
gene annotation, specialized for eukaryotes. yrGATE provides
similar functionality as the Apollo annotation tool [19] and
NCBI's ModelMaker [20], but includes community utilities,
specialized portals to external gene finding and annotation
software, and web browser accessibility.

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R58

The yrGATE package consists of a web-based Annotation
Tool for gene structure annotation creation and Community
Utilities for regulating the acceptance of the annotations into
a community gene set. The yrGATE Annotation Tool can be
used without the Community Utilities for analysis of gene loci
independent of a community. The Annotation Tool presents
pre-calculated exon evidence in several summaries with different selection mechanisms and provides other methods for
specifying custom exons, allowing thorough analysis and
quick annotation of loci. Annotators access the tool over the
web, where they create an annotation, decide to save the
annotation in their personal account, or submit the annotation for review for acceptance into the community gene set.
The online nature of yrGATE permits a large and nonexclusive group of annotators, ranging in expertise from professional curators to students [21]. This also provides a
continuous timeframe for gene annotation, allowing annotators to examine new sequence evidence as it becomes available and eliminating the delays of periodic annotation.
yrGATE is particularly well suited for emerging genomes that
are in the process of being sequenced, such as maize. Additionally, the user-friendly character of the yrGATE system
contributes to its accessibility and to its potential for community adoption.

Annotation tool

The Annotation Tool of the yrGATE package is a web-based
utility for creating gene structure annotations. The inputs and
outputs of the Annotation Tool are depicted in Figure 1. The
input consists of a genomic sequence, exon evidence, and evidence references. The output of the Annotation Tool is a gene
annotation, which consists of a gene structure (coordinates of
exons and introns), the inferred mRNA sequence, a corresponding protein coding region and its associated translation
product, evidence attributes, description, and functional
information. The input and output can be in several formats
(indicated in Figure 1), which will be described in detail in the
Implementation section below.
Defining a gene's exon-intron structure is the central step in
creating a eukaryotic gene annotation. The Annotation Tool
provides two general categories to specify exons: pre-defined
evidence-supported exons and novel user-defined exons. Predefined exons are provided by the Annotation Tool from prior
computations and are supported by evidence derived from
spliced alignments of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and
cDNAs, ab initio predictions, or a combination of sources.
The evidence is filtered by stringent thresholds to provide
exons suggestive of authentic genes. User-defined exons are
exons not contained in the pre-defined evidence and are individually specified by the user. Annotators have several channels to designate both categories of exons.
The Annotation Tool contains three representations of the
evidence: the Evidence Plot, the Evidence Table, and links to

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R58

Genome Biology 2006,

To document the annotator's procedure and parameters, the
Exon Origins attribute of an annotation record automatically
stores information about the source of each exon. The following information is stored: the method of exon-generation, a
score associated with the method and exon, sequence identifiers used in the method, unique database identifiers to the
specific output file or record, and a hyperlink to the program
output yielding the exon. Exon Origins allows for complete
re-creation of the gene structure annotation and for analysis
of manual annotation procedures that could aid in future
manual annotation efforts and techniques.
After a gene structure has been defined, a user can specify the
protein coding region of the annotation through entry of
genomic coordinates (4 in Figure 2a) or by using the ORF
Finder [20] portal. The ORF Finder portal (Figure 2b), operating similarly to the User Defined Exons portals, allows a
user to select an open reading frame, which upon selection is
imported into the Annotation Tool window and is graphically
represented in the Preview Structure.

pictorially (10 in panel a) for comparison with the Evidence Plot. A protein-coding region was evaluated using the portal to the (c) ORF Finder and
imported into the Annotation Tool (4 in panel a) using the yellow button.

refereed research

For cases in which genomic sequence requires editing, such as
correction of sequencing errors or annotation of genes undergoing mRNA editing, the Sequence Editor Tool (7 in Figure
2a) enables annotators to insert, delete, or change bases
through a web interface. These changes are incorporated into
the Annotation Tool and stored with the annotation record.

deposited research

Coordinately with gene structure and protein coding region
designation and edits, the mRNA and protein sequence fields
are updated (3 and 5 in Figure 2a). Hyperlinks, attached to
the appropriate sequence, are provided to BLASTN,
TBLASTX, BLASTX, TBLASTN and BLASTP at NCBI [20] for
an annotator to find similar sequences and/or assign a putative function. Additional pieces of information that can be
added to a gene annotation are a description and alternative
identifiers.

reports

As an additional channel provided for designating gene structures, the tool allows pasting a coordinate structure into the
mRNA structure field (6 in Figure 2a). The format for specifying an mRNA structure follows the conventional notation of
designating exons by start and end coordinates separated by
non-digits, with multiple exons separated by commas (for
example, the Perl regular expression for a two-exon gene
structure is [\d+\D+\d+,\d+\D+\d+]). This channel is

appropriate for comparing external gene structures with the
evidence. Exons not found in the pre-defined evidence are
given an 'unknown' source in the User Defined Exons table.

reviews

User-defined exons are specified through portals to exongenerating programs or through entry of the genomic coordinates of an exon. As these exons are defined, they are listed in
the User Defined Exons Table (2 in Figure 2a). Acting as a
type of web service, portals deliver the genome sequence of
the annotation region to an online exon-generating program,
with appropriate default parameters specified while allowing
the user to change these parameters. The program's output is
internally reformatted such that the user can directly add
exons from the program's output window into the current
gene structure displayed in the yrGATE Annotation Tool window. Currently, portals are available to the gene prediction
programs GENSCAN [22] and GeneMark [23] and to the
GeneSeqer spliced alignment web server [24]. Administrators
can easily add new portals for other exon-generating programs or sequence analysis programs, such as folding programs for non-coding RNA annotations. A template portal is
provided with the package.

evidence reference files. The Evidence Plot is a clickable
graphic that presents evidence in a color-coded schematic (8
in Figure 2a). The Evidence Table (11 in Figure 2a) groups
exons into mutually exclusive groups of exon variants. For
each exon, the table lists its genomic coordinates, the maximum score from the method that generated the exon, and the
evidence sources that support the exon. The evidence identifiers are hyperlinked to reference files for the exon, which
could be an alignment or other program output. Annotators
can select pre-defined exons by clicking on exon diagrams in
the Evidence Plot or clicking on buttons in the Evidence
Table. The annotator's developing gene structure is graphically displayed below the Evidence Plot for visual comparison
(10 in Figure 2a).

information

The first case study is a novel maize annotation using the
ZmGDB yrGATE implementation. An unannotated genome
region, 158659-162032 of BAC 51315585, was chosen by the
annotator using the genome browsing function of ZmGDB. A
screenshot of the Annotation Tool shows the completed
annotation (Figure 2). Exons were initially selected from the
pre-computed evidence. The evidence, though, consists of
two separate groups of ESTs (9 in Figure 2a) with no spanning
evidence in the region 160260-160664. The annotator
decided to use the GENSCAN and the GeneSeqer@PlantGDB
portals to explore potential exons in this region (2 in Figure
2a). After adding three user defined exons, a gene structure
connecting both groups of ESTs was defined (6 and 10 in Figure 2a). The portal to the ORF Finder was used to define a
protein-coding region, which spanned all eight exons of the
putative transcript. Terminal exons, supported by ESTs
71435182 and 32859895, were selected to maximize the
untranslated regions. The final step of the annotation session
was a BLASTP search at NCBI to compare the novel gene
annotation and to assign a putative gene product function.
The protein of the annotation had high similarity over most of
its length to rice protein NP_915525 and to Arabidopsis protein NP_190282. These proteins provided a putative functional assignment of 'sugar transporter' for the annotation.
The annotator was satisfied with the annotation and submitted it for review. Administrators reviewed the annotation and
accepted it because it was novel and of good quality. The

interactions

For specific implementations, the described community
annotation process can be adjusted by dropping any of the
steps, such as eliminating the user log in or eliminating the
review process so that all submitted annotations are published. New steps can also be added to the review process,
such as a voting utility for submitted annotations.

PlantGDB includes a family of species-specific databases:
AtGDB [26,27] for Arabidopsis, ZmGDB [28] for maize, and
OsGDB [29] for rice. These species-specific databases each
have an annotation community and an implementation of
yrGATE. Input to the yrGATE annotation tool is supplied by
the respective PlantGDB database. Pre-calculated exon evidence consists of spliced alignments of EST and cDNA
sequences generated by the GeneSeqer program [30]. Evidence references consist of hyperlinks to GeneSeqer output
files, which are a part of the respective databases. Genome
sequence segments are also supplied by the database. In these
PlantGDB implementations, yrGATE Community Utilities
regulate user management and annotation curation according to the described default configuration (Figure 3). We illustrate yrGATE usage at PlantGDB with two gene annotation
case studies.

refereed research

This newly submitted annotation is listed in the Administration Tool, where an administrator can 'check out' this annotation for review, so that other administrators do not review
this annotation concurrently. The administrator accesses the
'checked-out' annotation in a review version of the Annotation Tool. Then, the administrator reviews the annotation and
is able to edit any attributes of the record. When satisfied with
their analysis, the administrator accepts or rejects the annotation. If a decision cannot be reached, the annotation is
returned to the to-be-reviewed group. Accepted annotations
are added to the public community gene annotation database,
where they are presented through the Community Annotation Central and Annotation Record facilities. Rejected annotations can be edited by the annotator to be resubmitted for
review.

Community annotation at PlantGDB

deposited research

A typical annotation submission begins with an annotator
logging in to their private account, which contains all of the
annotations created by the annotator. Then, the annotator
creates a new annotation using the Annotation Tool and
decides to submit the annotation to the community.

The yrGATE package can be implemented in different configurations depending on the input and output (Figure 1) and on
the annotation review process (Figure 3). The input can be
either from a local database or a DAS server. The output can
be an entry in a local database or to a simple text or GFF3 file.
The optional Community Utilities provide annotation review
and community maintenance facilities. Two yrGATE implementations, having different configurations, are described
below.

reports

The yrGATE package includes community annotation utilities for sharing annotations among a public or private community. These utilities form a process for annotation
management and review (diagrammed in Figure 3) for two
different types of users, annotators and administrators. The
types of users are distinguished by their actions: annotators
create annotations and administrators review these annotations for acceptance into a community gene set. The community annotation process will be described from the
perspective of a new annotation submission and review.

comment

At the conclusion of a gene annotation session, an annotator
decides the outcome of their annotation record (1 in Figure
2a). Annotation records can be saved in the annotator's personal account, which limits access of the annotation to the
owner of the annotation. Annotations can be submitted for
review, in which case the annotation is sent to administrators,
who decide to accept or reject the annotation into a community database for sharing with the community. Alternatively,
annotations can be saved locally on the annotator's machine
by displaying the annotation in a simple text or GFF3 [25] format. Annotators are also able to delete stored annotations
that have not been accepted.

DAS servers provide sequence and annotation information
that can be queried and is in a standard format [32,33]. The
abundance of DAS servers for a variety of organisms provides
rich and diverse sources of input for the yrGATE Annotation
Tool. An implementation of yrGATE using input data from
DAS servers is provided for general use [34]. This implementation, 'yrGATE with DAS input', does not have a community
aspect, although a different configuration could add community functionality. The 'yrGATE with DAS input' Selection
Page allows an annotator to specify a DAS reference server

The primary evidence also suggests an annotation on the
reverse strand that contains the angiopoietin-2 gene within
one of its introns. However, current annotations on the
reverse strand are inaccurate and incomplete based on mRNA
and EST evidence (3 in Figure 5b). The first half of this potential gene is represented in some annotations (2 in Figure 5b;

Alignments of other species' RefSeq genes [43] (not pictured)
indicate a larger gene boundary than the displayed annotations, but this boundary is still too short compared to the primary evidence and does not contain all of the exons supplied
by the primary evidence. A novel gene annotation was created
on the reverse strand by selecting compatible exons from primary evidence using the Annotation Tool. An open reading
frame was designated, and the protein sequence was used to
find homologous genes in related species. Based on BLASTP
results, this gene was assigned the putative function microcephalin. Interestingly, several species (including human and
mouse) have an annotated microcephalin gene with high protein sequence similarity and also maintain the local genome
structure of angiopoietin-2 within an intron of the microcephalin gene on the opposite strand.

Figure 5 represents a case study of a novel chicken gene structure annotation. The Selection Page specifies the chicken
genome chromosome 3 segment 86850000-86990000 as the
genome entry point [35,36]. The selected evidence sources
include primary evidence of mRNA and EST BLAT alignments and, for comparison, annotations of types RefSeq
[37,38], TWINSCAN [39], Ensembl [40], Geneid [41], and
SGP [42]. The published annotation evidence sources are
selected so that the annotator can compare primary evidence
against existing annotations. Inspection of the primary evidence in the Evidence Plot of the Annotation Tool suggests
one gene on the forward strand (approximately 8688700086934000; 1 in Figure 5b) and another gene on the reverse
strand (approximately 86853000-86975000; 2 in Figure 5b).
The gene on the forward strand (1 in Figure 5b; for example,
RefSeq Gene angiopoietin-2, dark blue, labelled
NM_204817.1) is accurately annotated based on mRNA and
EST evidence. Additional alternative variants are also accurately annotated.

reviews

The second PlantGDB case study concerns alternative splicing and correction of an inaccurate published annotation of
an Arabidopsis gene model using the yrGATE implementation at AtGDB. A screenshot of the transcript view of AtGDB
presents two accepted community annotations (green
structures in interior window, Figure 4). The annotator
decided to investigate this genome region (chromosome 1,
segment 30370180-30373939) because, upon visual inspection, the first exon of the published annotation At1g808010.1
conflicts with EST and cDNA evidence (3 in Figure 4). Initially, the annotator used cDNA 23270370 to define the gene
structure and EST 496433 to extend the 3'-untranslated
region. Through the Evidence Table and evidence reference
links to GeneSeqer output of the Annotation Tool, the annotator recognized exon 11 has an alternative size supported by
EST 507078. The annotator examined open reading frames of
both transcript structures, and seeing that both protein-coding regions extend over all exons except for the 5'-most
untranslated exon, decided to create two annotations for this
locus. An AtGDB administrator reviewed the annotations and
accepted both into the community database because they corrected an inaccurate published annotation and captured
alternative splicing variants. These alternative splicing variants are displayed in the Transcript View of AtGDB (1 in Figure 4), which displays sequence alignments coordinated to a
diagram. In the Transcript View, the green vertical rectangle
(2 in Figure 4) relates the diagram to the multiple sequence
alignment, where nucleotides in introns are represented by
'>' symbols. Comparing alignments for sequences 23270370
and 507078, a three base difference in the start of the exon 11
is apparent (4 in Figure 4). The upstream intron sequences
reveal that both intron variants terminate with the standard
AG dinucleotide, which suggests this is a probable alternative
splicing event. The Transcript View of AtGDB makes such
minute differences distinguishable, which were previously
concealed in the diagram.

and DAS evidence sources (Figure 5a). The green 'look up'
buttons beside each text box provide a list for annotators to
make selections. After these selections are stored, the
Annotation Tool can be accessed with the selected input DAS
data (Figure 5b).

Community implementation of yrGATE at the PlantGDB Arabidopsis genome browser, AtGDB, for correction of a public annotation and for alternative
Community implementation of yrGATE at the PlantGDB Arabidopsis genome browser, AtGDB, for correction of a public annotation and for alternative
splicing. This two-window screenshot depicts yrGATE annotations in the AtGDB browser. The outer window contains a genome context view of AtGDB,
which has links to the yrGATE Annotation Tool and to AtGDB's Transcript View (1). The inner window contains the Transcript View, which presents a
genome context graphic and sequence alignments represented in the graphic. The graphic has the following color assignments: yrGATE annotations, green;
the public annotation, blue; cDNAs, light blue; ESTs, red; annotation protein coding regions, green and red triangles. The multiple sequence alignment in
the lower panel of the Transcript View corresponds to the region of graphic contained within the green rectangle (2). The first exon (3) of the public
annotation, At1g80810.1, is not supported by expressed sequence evidence, which instead suggests a downstream exon. There are two yrGATE
community annotations, yrGATE-At1g80810-1 and yrGATE-At1g80810-2, both of which contain the first exon supported by the evidence but differ at the
3'-end, because the evidence suggests two alternatives for exon 11 (as seen in the multiple alignment display (4)).

Usability and availability

The Annotation Tool was designed with emphasis on usability
for annotators. Annotators can immediately select from high
quality evidence that has a high likelihood of yielding an accurate annotation and can specify new custom evidence for
cases where the evidence is inadequate. The two categories
provide for a good annotation process where high quality evidence is first examined and then additional evidence is

checked, which is completed in a minimal amount of mouse
clicks and screen display, achieved by the tool's design.
The main components of the tool are contained in one standard 1,024 × 768 resolution screen. The tool is loaded once per
genomic region, and the form fields are dynamically updated,
which allows annotators to quickly evaluate the impact of different exon variants and combinations of exons on the gene
structure, mRNA sequence, and protein sequence. yrGATE is

Conclusion

15.

yrGATE opens gene structure annotation to a large, nonexclusive community. The characteristics of yrGATE contribute
to its potential for user appeal and community adoption.
Among other applications, it is particularly useful for
annotating emerging genomes and for correcting inaccurate
published annotations. yrGATE is easily adaptable to different input data and can support a community using the Community Utilities.
