Abstract
Background: Integrons are genetic elements capable of the acquisition, rearrangement and expression
of genes contained in gene cassettes. Gene cassettes generally consist of a promoterless gene associated
with a recombination site known as a 59-base element (59-be). Multiple insertion events can lead to the
assembly of large integron-associated cassette arrays. The most striking examples are found in Vibrio,
where such cassette arrays are widespread and can range from 30 kb to 150 kb. Besides those found in
completely sequenced genomes, no such array has yet been recovered in its entirety. We describe an
approach to systematically isolate, sequence and annotate large integron gene cassette arrays from
bacterial strains.
Results: The complete Vibrio sp. DAT722 integron cassette array was determined through the
streamlined approach described here. To place it in an evolutionary context, we compare the DAT722
array to known vibrio arrays and performed phylogenetic analyses for all of its components (integrase, 59be sites, gene cassette encoded genes). It differs extensively in terms of genomic context as well as gene
cassette content and organization. The phylogenetic tree of the 59-be sites collectively found in the Vibrio
gene cassette pool suggests frequent transfer of cassettes within and between Vibrio species, with slower
transfer rates between more phylogenetically distant relatives. We also identify multiple cases where nonintegron chromosomal genes seem to have been assembled into gene cassettes and others where
cassettes have been inserted into chromosomal locations outside integrons.
Conclusion: Our systematic approach greatly facilitates the isolation and annotation of large integrons
gene cassette arrays. Comparative analysis of the Vibrio sp. DAT722 integron obtained through this
approach to those found in other vibrios confirms the role of this genetic element in promoting lateral
gene transfer and suggests a high rate of gene gain/loss relative to most other loci on vibrio chromosomes.
We identify a relationship between the phylogenetic distance separating two species and the rate at which
they exchange gene cassettes, interactions between the non-mobile portion of bacterial genomes and the
vibrio gene cassette pool as well as intragenomic translocation events of integrons in vibrios.

Background
The integron/gene cassette system is now known to be
widely distributed amongst the Bacteria and is a major
contributor to the dispersal of genes by Lateral Gene
Transfer (LGT). The system can facilitate LGT by virtue of
the fact that the integron encodes a site-specific recombination (SSR) system [1,2]. The targets for SSR are gene cassettes [3]. These are independently mobilizable units of
DNA, usually composed of a single gene bound by a
recombination site, designated a 59-base element (59-be)
or alternatively attC. The DNA integrase catalysing SSR,
IntI, is encoded by the integron. This integrase recognises
two families of recombination sites. The first of these is
the cassette associated 59-be [4] and the second is a site
contained within the integron designated attI. IntI can catalyze a reversible reaction by which gene cassettes can be
inserted into, or excised from, an integron via recombination between the attI site and a 59-be or between two 59be sites [5,6]. Multiple recombination events are common. As a consequence, integrons are normally associated
with arrays comprising multiple cassettes, which in some
species of Vibrio can number well in excess of a hundred
[7]. Gene cassettes do not normally include a promoter.
Instead, where it has been examined, transcription of cassette genes is driven by a promoter (Pc) located in the integron itself [1]. Thus, the integron and gene cassettes
comprise both a gene capture and gene expression system.
Integrons were first identified in the context of multi-drug
resistance. In this context, pathogenic bacteria are often
resistant to many antibiotics as a consequence of possessing an integron that has captured several gene cassettes
containing resistance genes [2]. These integrons recovered
from clinical environments are often embedded in other
types of mobile elements such as plasmids and transposons [8]. It is now clear however that integrons are also
a common feature of the chromosomes of various bacteria, being found in the gamma-proteobacteria (vibrios,
xanthomonads, pseudomonads, Shewanella), beta-proteobacteria (Nitrosomonas europea) and spirochaetes
(Treponema denticola) (Figure 1). Another notable feature
of chromosomal integrons is the wide diversity of functions encoded by the genes found in their gene cassettes
[9]. This, coupled with the observation that cassette arrays
can be quite large, clearly hints at a system that can greatly
impact on the adaptive potential of bacteria [10]. Given
that cassette associated genes are part of the gene pool that
is LGT-associated and mobilizable, they also represent a
community resource that can be shared between individuals [11].
Bacteria of the Vibrio genus are rapidly becoming a model
system for the study of the chromosomal integron/gene
cassette system [12-14]. As noted above, their cassette
arrays are characteristically large, encompassing several

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/3

percent of genomic coding capacity in many cases. Representatives of this genus display such a high level of variation in terms genome size and content that "species" units
can rarely be identified by the sequencing of one or a few
genetic markers [15]. Many complete integron arrays have
now been assembled from various species of Vibrio as a
result of whole genome sequencing initiatives. These
include V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus (two
strains) and V. fischeri [16-19]. These collective sequencing efforts have helped to highlight the enormous amount
of novel genetic diversity contained within integron
arrays. However, it is also becoming clear that whole
genome sequencing is a relatively blunt instrument for
assessing gene cassette diversity. This is because, although
individual strains of Vibrio can contain large arrays, the
total number of cassettes harboured by any single individual is very small compared to the overall size of this community resource [11]. As an alternative approach to
recovering gene cassettes, the cassette PCR technique has
been developed [20]. This method selectively amplifies
gene cassettes to the exclusion of other genomic
sequences and can be applied to both metagenomic (environmental) DNA and to the DNA of defined strains. However, cassette PCR only recovers cassettes in isolation (i.e.
outside their genetic context) and cannot aid in the assembly of contiguous arrays. Also, although gene cassette PCR
is selective, there is always the possibility for some false
positives (non-cassette DNA fragments being amplified)
[20]. When a gene cassette is found within an array, there
is no doubt about its nature.
To more rapidly access and analyse the mobile gene cassette pool, we adopted a genomics approach that allows
us to specifically isolate DNA fragments containing large
integron gene cassette arrays and exclude the vast majority
of the genome that is common to most members of a species. No such large cassette array has previously been isolated and fully sequenced without completely sequencing
the genome of its host. Using our streamlined approach,
we isolate and sequence the integron from a close relative
of the widespread marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi, a wellknown member of the core vibrio group to which V. parahaemolyticus also belongs (Figure 2). To place it in an evolutionary context, we compare it to known vibrio integron
arrays and perform a phylogenetic analysis of all of its
components (integrase, 59-be sites, gene cassette encoded
genes). This reveals strong interaction between vibrio integrons through LGT, high variability of array contents and
wide functional diversity of gene cassettes. These analyses
also yield insights on the processes of gene cassette recruitment from non-mobile genes and the possibility of cassette de-recruitment. Differences in the genomic context
of integrons from various vibrios suggest several events of
intragenomic translocation for these genetic elements.

to which they belong. Support values displayed above the

the dataset (only values >80% are displayed). The sequences
of the intI genes from Vibrio sp. DAT865, DAT868 and
DAT722 strains were obtained in this study.

Characterization of the Vibrio sp. DAT722 cassette array
The method used to isolate a complete vibrio gene cassette
array takes advantage of the fact that cassettes are linked,
having been assembled at a single locus, the integron attI
site. By making genomic libraries and screening individual clones by cassette PCR or with PCR primers targeting
the intI gene, we can recover large inserts that comprise
exclusively, or in large part, of contiguous arrays of mobile
gene cassettes. Here we demonstrate this principle on an
environmental strain of a Vibrio sp. from an aquaculture
facility in Darwin, Australia. We show that using a fosmid
vector (insert size between 30–40 kb) to construct a
genomic library (480 clones), we can recover the whole 82
kb integron array in four PCR screening rounds, the first
of which identifies a clone bearing the intI. A structured
query language (SQL) script was developed to facilitate
annotation of integron arrays, made difficult by the presence of non-coding elements such as 59-be sites. The
script performs a search for short DNA motifs on a DNA
segment and detects intervening ORFs, outputting annotation in GenBank format.

The gene cassette array of Vibrio sp. isolate DAT722 has an
average G+C content of 40.7%, compared to 44.8% for
the flanking DNA regions. A G+C content lower than the
genomic average of the host is typical of vibrio integrons,
and differences ranging from 2.8 to 5.7% can be found in
completely sequenced vibrio genomes harbouring an
integron (data not shown). The DAT722 array contains
116 gene cassettes (Figure 3), falling between the shortest
vibrio array of 36 cassettes (V. fischeri) and the longest
array of 219 cassettes (V. vulnificus CMCP6) (Table 1).
However, DAT722 contains a high diversity of cassettes,
comprising 94 different cassette types out of a total of 116
cassettes. A cassette type represents either a non-paralogous cassette or a group of paralogous cassettes, the latter
being defined as a group of cassette that have reciprocal
BLASTP or BLASTN matches with an e-value of 1E-10 or
less). This number of different cassette types is only
equalled or surpassed by much larger arrays (V. cholerae
with 95 cassette types of a total 173 cassettes and V. vulnificus CMCP6 with 141 cassette types of a total 219 cassettes). Consistent with this cassette diversity, the DAT722
array also encodes a wide variety of functions including
DNA modification and primary metabolic enzymes
(Table 2). Also typical of gene cassette arrays, there is a
high proportion of cassettes either with no detectable
homolog (37 cassettes) or with sequence matches only to
hypothetical proteins (40 cassettes). Only a minority of
cassettes encodes a protein to which a putative function
can be assigned: 8 cassettes can be assigned a specific function with reasonable certainty and another 12 a broad
function (for example matching a general super-family of
proteins such as acetyltransferases).

Interestingly, Vibrio gene cassette arrays vary enormously
in the proportions of their contents which is composed of
non-coding cassettes. Cassettes are defined as "non-coding" when they have no BLASTX matches and they do not
contain ORFs longer than 150 bp. Given this definition,
the proportion of the array made-up of non-coding cassettes can vary from 6% (V. cholerae) to 49% (V. vulnificus CMCP6) and does not appear to be correlated with
array size. There seems to be some correlation, however,
between array size and content in paralogous (whether
coding or non-coding) cassettes, as all large arrays (the
two V. vulnificus strains and V. cholerae) have in excess of
44% of cassettes repeated at least twice in the array while
smaller arrays all have around 25% of paralogs (Table 1).
One remarkable feature of non-coding cassettes is that
they either have very close homolog(s) in other vibrios
(>80% nucleotide identity) or no homologs at all. In the
Vibrio sp. DAT722 array, of 25 non-coding cassettes, 8
have no significant BLASTN hits and 17 are closely related
to non-coding cassettes from other vibrios. None of these
cassettes seem to represent pseudo-genes, as they do not
display any matches to public databases using amino acid
translations of all possible reading frames as query

(BLASTX). Furthermore, all cassettes defined as non-coding that do have BLASTN matches in other vibrios are similar to these homologs across their whole length. Noncoding cassettes also tend to be paralogous in all vibrio
integrons. Although there are only 6 copies of the most
prevalent non-coding cassette in the Vibrio sp. DAT722
array, there is a highly paralogous family of non-coding
cassettes which has 45 representatives in V. vulnificus
CMCP6 and 34 in V. vulnificus YJ016.
Coding cassettes are also frequently paralogous (i.e. have
reciprocal BLASTP or BLASTN matches with an e-value of
1E-10 or less). For example, they account for 19 out of the
31 paralogous cassettes in the DAT722 array. The V. cholerae array displays the most paralogy among coding cassettes, boasting 115 proteins with some degree of
paralogy. However, only two of its paralogous groups
have more than 4 members, even when a generous
BLASTP similarity cut-off is used to determine paralogy (evalue 1E-10). Coding cassettes differ most significantly
from non-coding cassettes by having homologs both
inside and outside of the vibrios. Out of 91 coding cassettes in the Vibrio sp. DAT722 array, 29 have no BLASTP
or BLASTX hit (e-value cutoff 1E-10), 34 have a best match
to other vibrios and 28 have a best match outside vibrios.
Variability of gene cassette array composition
Comparison of cassette content between vibrio strains/
species arrays reveals important variability. The number of
cassettes shared between the arrays of two different species of Vibrio, counting repeated paralogous cassettes only
once, varies between 1 and 14 (arrays contain anywhere
from 31 to 141 cassette types) (Table 3). The two V. vulnificus strains, respectively containing 88 and 141 cassette
types, only have 34 cassettes in common. This represents
a 30–39% shared content (based on the two different
array sizes), which is much lower than the 78–85% shared
gene content of their whole genomes when compared
with the same homology criteria (BLAST cut-off of 1E-10).
The difference in shared gene content between arrays and
genomes is even more pronounced when comparing different species. For example, V. vulnificus CMCP6 shares
60–72% of its genomic genes with V. cholerae but only
10–15% of its array genes.
Origins and fates of gene cassettes
There are multiple examples of cassette-encoded vibrio
genes only found in a single vibrio strain but showing
strong similarity to chromosomal genes from other types
of bacteria. Two striking examples are the proteins coded
by cassettes 11 and 75 from the DAT722 array. Cassette 11
encodes a putative DNA topoisomerase that has 68%
amino acid identity to a similarly annotated protein from
Shewanella amazonensis (Table 2). The cassette 11 protein
also shares 40% identity with proteins coded by uncul-

tured marine alpha-proteobacteria from the SAR116 cluster. The protein coded by cassette 75 shares 55% identity
(e-value 4E-44) with selenocysteine lyase from the cyanobacteria Anabaena variabilis yet does not display homology
to any other protein in current databases. Another notable
case is the hypothetical protein encoded by cassette 112,
whose only homologs are found in two Salmonella and
two Bordetella species, with which it shares ~50% amino
acid identity. It is not possible to perform meaningful
phylogenetic analyses of these genes to get a more complete picture of their evolutionary history, as there are not
enough known homologs. However, the high degree of

similarity between these cassettes and their non-cassette
homologs, combined with the lack of any vibrio
homologs, suggest that they have been recruited from
chromosomal genes of other types of bacteria.
Vibrio cassette-encoded ORFs are also found to have noncassette ORFs homologs in other vibrio strains. The three
most striking cases from the DAT722 array are cassettes
31, 74 and 103. Cassette 31 codes for a putative betaphosphoglucomutase that has 70% amino acid identity
with a non-cassette ORF occuring in both V. vulnificus
genomes, as well as more distant homologs in a variety of

other bacteria (Figure 4A). Cassette 74 (Figure 4B) codes
for a haemagglutinin associated protein and shares 88%
amino acid identity with a V. cholerae cassette-encoded
homolog. This cassette product also has 75% identity with
a non-cassette protein found in V. parahaemolyticus and
Photobacterium profundum. Cassette 103 (Figure 4C)
encodes a putative acetyltransferase that shares 76% identity with a non-cassette ORF in V. fischeri, and is additionally found in many other bacteria. No traces of 59-be site
can be found next to the non-cassette homologs, and it is
unclear wether these vibrio non-cassette ORFs closely
related to cassette-encoded ORFs represent cassette generation events or non-specific cassette insertion events. The
latter scenario of cassette insertion outside an integron
context has been previously documented for gene cassettes generally associated with class 1 integrons [3]. The
nature of this secondary site insertion appears to generate
a non-functional 59-be thereby preventing subsequent
mobilization [3].
There is one clear-cut example of cassette insertion outside
an integron emerging from the analysis of the DAT722
array. Cassette 102 encodes two short proteins together
forming a toxin-antitoxin stability system widespread in
vibrio integrons [18] (a phylogenetic tree of the antoxin
protein, which is highly similar to the tree of the toxin
protein, is displayed in Figure 4D). The amino acid
sequence of the antitoxin protein from DAT722 is 92%
identical to its non-cassette homolog in Shewanella oneidensis and but only 78% identical to its relative encoded

by a cassette in the sequenced V. fischeri array. This
DAT722 cassette-encoded protein also shares significant
similarity to a Xanthomonas non-cassette homolog (62%
identity). It seems likely in this case that a vibrio gene cassette has been inserted non-specifically in the S. oneidensis
genome, since the Shewanella homolog clusters strongly
inside a clade of vibrio cassette-encoded homologs.
Although Shewanella oneidensis is known to possess a functional integron, it only harbours 3 cassettes and the
vibrio-like antitoxin gene is found at a different chromosomal location (Figure 1).
Non-coding cassettes differ from those that are coding in
terms of distribution, as no homologs outside the vibrios
can be found for these cassettes. Instead, closely related
homologs in other vibrio species and frequent paralogs in
the same array are found for most non-coding cassettes.
For example, non-coding cassette 26 is 84% and 88%
identical to paralogous cassettes 46 and 48 at the nucleotide level and shares 89% identity with homologous
non-coding V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus cassettes.
This high level of sequence conservation from one species
to another suggests that non-coding cassettes are under
purifying selection. The degree of sequence conservation
of paralogous non-coding cassettes could also be
enhanced by a process of gene conversion, where recombination between paralogs leads to a more homogeneous
set of gene sequences [21]. This sequence conservation,
linked with their limited distribution and frequent paralogy leads to two possibilities: 1) They could be selfish ele-

ments associated with vibrio integrons; 2) They have a
function beneficial to the integron (contain promoters
that regulate neighboring gene cassette encoded gene
expression or can be transcribed as RNA molecules that
play a role in integron regulation). In either case, they
most likely have originated within the vibrios and spread
to most representatives of this group harbouring integrons.
Translocation of integron gene cassette arrays
The genomic context of an integron and its associated cassette array can provide important information on its history. The context of the Vibrio sp. DAT722 cassette array
differs significantly from the context of its closest
sequenced relative, the V. parahaemolyticus array. Although
the same 16 genes (in an identical order) are found 5' of
the integrase gene in both arrays, the context suddenly
changes past this conserved block. None of the next 15
genes upstream of this block in DAT722 has a homolog in
a nearby location in V. parahaemolyticus, some of them are
found 0.5 mb away on the large V. parahaemolyticus chromosome and two of them match genes found some 35 kb
after the end of the array. Similarly, genes found after the
end of these two arrays are completely different, with the
exception of homologous transposase genes (IS3 family)
being found near the last cassette of both arrays. As suggested by Rowe-Magnus et al. [12], the fact that the core
vibrio group (which includes V. parahaemolyticus and
Vibrio sp. DAT722) integron integrases are flanked by a different gene than their V. cholerae and V. vulnificus
homologs most likely represents an integron translocation event in the ancestor of the former group (Figure 2).
It therefore seems that an integron was inserted at a given
location (next to the VC1310 gene) in the ancestor of the
V. harveyi / V. parahaemolyticus core vibrio group, and that
the array might have then been moved by a transposition
or genome rearrangement event. However, since we do
not know the degree of synteny (conservation of gene
order) between the V. parahaemolyticus and Vibrio sp. DAT
722 genomes, the possibility that the genome of either of
these strains was rearranged on both side of its integron
cannot be excluded.

Translocation events like the potential integron movement in the V. parahaemolyticus and/or Vibrio sp. DAT722
lineage(s) seem likely, as the V. cholerae integron has certainly been moved from its original position on the large
chromosome, being the only Vibrio integron found on the
smaller of the two chromosomes typically found in this
genus [18]. As is the case for the arrays of Vibrio sp.
DAT722 and V. parahaemolyticus, the block of genes flanking the integron integrase gene is conserved between V.
cholerae and V. vulnificus (limited to 4 genes rather than 16
in this case, including the ribosomal protein gene directly
flanking the integrase gene, rplT), with entirely different
contexts beyond this block. This block of genes would
have accompanied the integron when it was translocated
from one V. cholerae chromosome to the other. Transposases could have been involved, as the V. cholerae integron (including the 4 genes block linked to it) is flanked
by genes coding for such proteins on both sides.
Those translocation events do not seem to occur solely
within and between chromosomes. Vibrio salmonicida carries a large 170 MDa plasmid (pRSV1) harbouring an integron [22]. The integrase of the pRSV1 integron is clearly a
vibrio-type integrase, not one of the class 1 or SXT constin
integron integrases previously found on vibrio plasmids.
This is shown by its strongly supported clustering with
vibrio-type integrases in phylogenetic analyses (Figure 1).
One of the gene cassettes of this integron encodes a transposase and another a dihydrofolate reductase type I usually found in class 1 integrons. It therefore seems that the
V. salmonicida integron originates from a translocation
(possibly transposition) event of a chromosomal vibriotype integron to a plasmid and later acquired cassettes
from class 1 integrons.
The frequent association of vibrio integrons with transposases, along with the variability in their genetic context
and the DNA molecule carrying them (plasmid, large or
small chromosome), suggest that some of them could be
mobilized. As discussed above, there is strong evidence for
intragenomic and intracellular translocation of integrons,
but what remains to be established is whether lateral

phylogenetic analysis of 59-be based on this alignment.
Three major clades emerge in the resulting tree: 1) All V.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/3

fischeri 59-be sites cluster together to the exclusion of all
others with strong statistical support (94% bootstrap
value); 2) most (151/173 or 87%) V. cholerae 59-be sites
fall in a single clade along with four 59-be sites from other
species with robust support (87% bootstrap value); 3) a
large proportion (181/406 or 45%) of 59-be sites from
either of the two V. vulnificus strains form a cluster with a
single 59-be site from V. parahaemolyticus (weakly supported, 65% bootstrap value). The vast majority of clusters beside these three are formed of 59-be sites from a
variety of species.

A phenomenon that could contribute to enhancing the
degree of homogeneity between the 59-be sites found in a
given species is gene conversion. This non-reciprocal
recombination process occurs between relatively small
tracts of DNA and is known to lead to the sequence
homogenization of multiple paralogous genes found in a
given organism, such as rRNA genes [21]. This could also
be the case with 59-be sites, and linked with the process of
nucleotide substitutions due to replication or repair
errors, could lead to the creation and maintenance of distinct pools of 59-be sites in divergent organisms.

The major clades observed for V. fischeri, V. cholerae and V.
vulnificus contrast with the absence of such phylogenetic
structuring for V. parahaemolyticus or Vibrio sp. DAT722.
The presence/absence of species-specific clades in the 59be sites tree seems to be correlated with the phylogenetic
distance of a species from others represented the dataset.
In the most phylogenetically distant species of the dataset,
V. fischeri, no exchange of 59-be sites with other species
(indicated by mixed clades) is observed. V. vulnificus and
V. cholerae also lack close relatives in the dataset, both
being represented by relatively long branches in the rpoB
tree (Figure 2). They both display one major species-specific clade along with some exchange of 59-be sites with
other species. Vibrio sp. DAT722 and Vibrio parahaemolyticus are relatively close species (Figure 2) and neither of
them displays a species-specific clade in the 59-be site tree.

Evolutionary rate of gene cassette arrays
Mixed phylogenetic clades composed of 59-be sites from
different vibrio species, observed with V. cholerae and V.
metschnikovii by Rowe-Magnus et al. [12] and here with a
more substantial dataset, suggest frequent transfer of gene
cassettes between vibrios. However, the phylogenetic
structure present in the 59-be site tree, where 59-be sites
from a given species cluster more frequently with others
sharing a similar host, also suggest a correlation between
phylogenetic distance and frequency of cassette exchange.
This could be due to a lower efficiency of integrons at integrating gene cassettes from divergent species, as their 59be sites did not co-evolve with the integrase and attI site of
the host species. This hypothesis is supported by the
recent findings of Biskri et al. [23] that the range of 59-be
sites efficiently recombined by the V. cholerae integrase is
narrower than the range of 59-be sites efficiently recombined by class 1 integrases. Performing similar assays of
recombination efficiency using combinations of 59-be
sites, attI sites and integrases from different vibrio species
could allow direct testing of a correlation between phylogenetic distance and frequency of cassette exchange in
vibrios.

Of 85 nodes with a bootstrap support value >80%, 65
contain only 59-be sites from the same species and 20
contain 59-be sites from multiple species, indicating
transfer of gene cassettes between species. All species of
vibrio are involved in such transfers except for the more
phylogenetically distant V. fischeri (5 events involve V.
parahaemolyticus as either donor or recipient, 8 V. cholerae,
8 Vibrio sp. DAT722 and 12 V. vulnificus). Among the 65
well-supported nodes containing 59-be from a single species only, 36 nodes contain 59-be sites solely from V. vulnificus. Of these 36, 30 contain 59-be sites from a single
strain and 6 contain 59-be sites from both CMCP6 and
YJ016. Transfer of gene cassettes can therefore be assumed
to happen at both the subspecies and species levels among
vibrios. The frequency of such transfer events seems to be
broadly correlated with phylogenetic distance between
the proponents (with a higher frequency between close
relatives). Comparison of closely related vibrios, such as
Vibrio sp. DAT722 and V. parahaemolyticus or individual
strains of V. vulnificus, shows evidence of frequent transfer
events that disrupt vertical inheritance patterns, ultimately leading to the absence of a major monophyletic
clade for their 59-be sites. At the other extreme, transfer of
cassettes between V. fischeri and other vibrios must be very
rare or absent, as illustrated by the monophyly of all of its
59-be sites.

Looking at the difference between two gene cassette arrays
relative to their genomic context can yield insight on the
rate of evolution of those arrays versus the rate at which
the rest of the genome evolves. The two most closely
related strains of Vibrio for which we have complete array
sequences, V. vulnificus YJ016 and V. vulnificus CMCP6,
share 30–39% of their gene cassettes (34 cassettes on an
array size of 88 and 141 non-repeated cassettes, respectively). This represents a minimum of 107 gene cassette
gain/loss events between the arrays (54 of YJ016 88 cassettes are not found in CMCP6 and the latter has 53 additional cassettes). This divergence is striking, as these
strains are very closely related, displaying differences of
only 6 bp in the 1500 bp of their intI genes and 7 bp in a
1000 bp fragment of their rpoB gene. Furthermore, the
shared content of the array is also misleading for the estimation of cassette gain/loss events, as shared cassettes do
not necessarily represent an evolutionarily conserved trait,
but can have different histories, as is suggested by the lack

of conservation in gene order between the arrays as
opposed to the relatively conserved organization of the
surrounding genomic genes [19]. Given that the impact of
acquiring/losing a gene on organismal fitness would generally be greater than that of a nucleotide substitution,
integrons are of immense evolutionary value for their
host. Comparison of the cassette content of integrons
from a large number of closely related strains, combined
with a multi-locus sequence analysis to estimate the
nucleotide substitution rate in the genome of these
strains, could allow for a quantitative estimate of the relative evolutionary rate of integrons.

Conclusion
The entire 82 kb integron gene cassette array of Vibrio sp.
DAT722 was isolated and sequenced using a streamlined
approach that could be used with most, if not all, integron-containing bacteria (Figure 1). The ease of preparation and high efficiency of fosmid libraries combined
with the possibility to screen for integrons by PCR (targeting either of their main components, the integron integrase gene or 59-be sites), makes this approach widely
applicable. Non-coding genetic elements such as 59-be
sites are not readily identified by automated genome
annotation tools, which focus mostly on identifying
ORFs. Even for the identification of ORFs encoded within
gene cassette arrays, these programs perform poorly, as
they often identify the 59-be sites as being part of gene
cassette ORFs or being ORFs themselves. This is in part
due to the frequent use of alternative start codons in gene
cassette encoded ORFs [24]. The approach implemented
here, a simple motif search for the conserved ends of 59be sites identifies gene cassettes with almost 100% efficiency, provided that sequence information is available
from gene cassettes of an integron belonging to the same
class as the target. By searching for the 59-be sites first and
subsequently identifying ORFs that fall in-between these
elements (allowing for minimal overlap), the accuracy of
the annotation is improved significantly.
Although the mechanistic aspects of integrons are now
relatively well understood (recombinase activity, preferential integration of cassettes at the attI site, etc.), little is
known on their general biology, such as the size range of
their gene cassette arrays, the composition and diversity of
their genetic pool and their rate of evolution. Isolating
and comparing gene cassette arrays from multiple closely
related organisms is necessary to understand their role in
natural environments. Because of the almost ubiquitous
presence of large integron gene cassette arrays in vibrios
and the wide distribution and ease of isolation of these
bacteria, they represent an ideal model system to study
this genetic element and its impact on natural populations. The comparative analyses performed here confirm
previous studies as to the functional diversity contained in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/3

vibrio integrons as well as the high variability of their gene
cassette content [12,19]. Additionally, evolutionary analyses of the gene cassettes of the Vibrio sp. DAT722 array
revealed that these mobile elements can be recruited from
genomic genes of various origins and can also be derecruited, becoming a 'sedentary' gene after a non-specific
integration event and the loss of its associated 59-be sites.
This suggests a two-way interaction between the gene pool
made up of gene cassettes and the larger gene pool composed of non-mobile bacterial genes. Our phylogenetic
analysis of 59-be sites suggests that the gene cassette pool
itself is fragmented along phylogenetic lines. The 59-be
sites linked to gene cassettes are not homogeneous across
all vibrios but tend to be more similar if found in closely
related strains or species, suggesting more frequent transfers of gene cassettes among close relatives. Accumulation
of sequence data on complete gene cassette arrays will
allow for more precise estimates of the rates of gain, loss
and transfer of gene cassettes and perhaps even on the
degree of gene order conservation, provided that the
arrays of very closely related organisms can be isolated.

Methods
DNA extraction and strain characterization
The Vibrio harveyi ATCC14126 reference strain was
obtained from the American Type and Culture Collection.
All other strains used in this study were isolated from
marine environments in Australia: strains labeled DAT
were obtained from aquaculture tanks used to raise mudcrab larvae in Darwin, Northern Territory (Vibrio sp.
DAT722, Vibrio sp. DAT1706, Vibrio sp. DAT865, Vibrio sp.
DAT868, Vibrio sp. DAT447); strains labelled SH originate
from Sydney Harbour (New South Wales) seawater samples (Vibrio sp. SH32 and Vibrio fischeri SH36). All vibrios
were isolated by plating water samples directly on thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose (TCBS) agar plates. Pure cultures of
the strains were grown in rich medium (10 g tryptone, 10
g NaCl, 4.0 g MgCl2·6H2O, 1.0 g KCl, make up to 1 L with
distilled H2O, adjust pH to 7.5 with 1 M NaOH).
Genomic DNA was extracted as described in Wilson [25].
A 1127 bp DNA fragment of the RNA polymerase B gene
(rpoB) (from nucleotide position 1315 to 2442 in reference to the E. coli rpoB gene), was amplified by PCR from
the genomic DNA of all vibrio strains using general vibrio
primers (rpoB1315F 5'-GGCGAAGTGGACGATATCGACC-3' and rpoB2442R 5'-GATCGAGTCTTCGAAGTTGTA-3'). A phylogenetic analysis of these rpoB fragments
along with their homologs from completely sequenced
vibrio genomes was performed to identify relationships
between the isolates.
PCR amplification and sequencing of PCR products
PCR amplifications were carried out in a final volume of
25 µl containing 1–5 ng of template DNA, 1.0 mM of each
primer, and 12.5 µl of PCR Master Mix (PROMEGA). The

reactions were performed with an initial denaturation at
94°C for 2 min., 30 cycles with a denaturation at 94°C for
30 sec., primer annealing at 55°C for 30 sec., and primer
extension at 72°C for 1 min. PCR products were gel purified with the MinElute kit (QIAGEN) and cloned in
TopoTA (INVITROGEN). Two clones were sequenced
from both directions for each PCR product using an
ABI377 automated DNA sequencer and BigDye v3.1
chemistry.
Screening strains for the presence of integrons
Genomic DNA isolated from a pure culture of each strain
was screened for the presence of an integron using one of
two sets of primers: one set targeted part of intI (VintI_R
5'-CTGATATWMGWACMGTACAAGARC-3') and most of
the gene known to be upstream of it in strains from the
vibrio core group such as V. parahaemolyticus, VC1310
(VC1310_F 5'-CTGAATGTCTTATTTGCCTTTGG-3'); the
second set targeted Vibrio gene cassettes 59-be sites
(V59be_F
5'-CACACCTTARSNSRGCGTTA-3'
and
V59be_R 5'-TCCCTCTTGARCNSYTTGTTA-3'). Strains
SH32 and SH36 were positive only for gene cassettes.
Strains DAT722, DAT868, DAT865 were positive for both
intI flanked by VC1310 and gene cassettes. Once the PCR
products were confirmed by sequencing, these three
strains were selected for genomic fosmid library construction.
Construction and screening of fosmid libraries
Fosmid libraries were constructed from the genomic DNA
of strains DAT722, DAT865 and DAT868 using the EPIFOS kit (EPICENTRE). Purified genomic DNA was run on
a low-melt 1% agarose gel (AMRESCO) in a pulse-field gel
electrophoresis apparatus (BIORAD) and the DNA of ~40
kb in size was cut out, purified from the agarose, ligated to
the fosmid vector, packaged in phage capsids and used to
infect E. coli as described in the EPIFOS kit manual. 480
colonies from each of the resulting libraries were picked
from agar plates and used to inoculate 96-well blocks containing 1 ml of LB broth with 12.5 µg/ml of chloramphenicol (to select for the presence of fosmids) in each well.
These cultures were grown overnight and glycerol stocks
were made by mixing 140 µl of culture from each well
with 60 µl of 50% glycerol in a 96-well plate. 10ul was
sampled from each well and pooled by row in eppendorf
tubes (120 µl per tube). The latter tubes were centrifuged
to remove the LB broth and cells were resuspended in 15
µl of pH 7.0 Tris-HCl buffer. 1 µl of resuspended cells was
added as template to PCR reaction tubes for screening. 40
PCRs were required to screen each library (1 reaction per
12 wells row, 8 rows per 96-well block, 5 96-well blocks
per library). The PCR screening was done using primers
targeting the intI gene and its upstream neighbor VC1310.
For all positive rows of the blocks, 1 µl was taken out of
each well from that row in the corresponding glycerol

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/3

stock to inoculate a new PCR screening reaction. Clones
testing positive in this second round of screening were restreaked on LB agar plates containing 12.5 µg/ml of chloramphenicol, which were used to inoculate a liquid culture for extraction of pure fosmid DNA (as described in
the EPIFOS kit manual). From 2 to 7 positive clones were
obtained for each 480 clones library, with an average of 5
or ~1 % of positives.
Sequencing reactions were performed on one intI /
VC1310 positive fosmid for each of the DAT722, DAT865
and DAT868 libraries using primer VintI_F (5'-CTTGTACGGTACGAATATCAGC-3') to obtain the complete
sequence of their intI genes (completing the partial intI
sequence on the intI / VC1310 fragment). An intI-bearing
fosmid from the library with the most positive clones for
intI (the DAT722 library, 7 positive clones / 480 total
clones) was then selected for whole shotgun sequencing.
Assembly of the complete Vibrio sp. DAT722 integron
The intI-containing DNA insert from the DAT722 library
was cleaved from its fosmid vector using EcoRI and separated from it by PFGE. The insert DNA recovered from the
low-melt agarose gel (EPIFOS kit manual) was then
sheared in 1 kb fragments by nebullization and cloned in
the TopoTA vector (INVITROGEN). Sub-clones were
sequenced to obtain 8× coverage of the complete insert.
Fragments were assembled using PHRED-PHRAP, which
was also used to assess the quality of the sequencing. Lowquality regions were targeted by PCR giving a final average
coverage of 11.8 (average for all the fosmid clones
sequenced here). This yielded a 36 kb contig that included
the intI gene, 33 kb of flanking DNA on one side and three
gene cassettes integrated at attI on the other. To extend the
array in the direction of the gene cassettes, a set of PCR
primers targeting the last cassette of the contig was
designed and used to re-screen the library. Both ends of
library clones positive using this set of primers were
sequenced to determine overlap with the original 36 kb
contig. A fosmid clone with minimal overlap (2–5 kb)
was selected for sequencing. This "walking" procedure
was repeated until the end of the array was reached (i.e.
gene cassettes were absent at one end of the last fosmid
sequenced). This yielded a total of four fosmid clones of
36 kb, 32 kb, 30 kb and 37 kb in size, covering the entire
82 kb DAT722 integron gene cassette array as well as 33
kb of DNA on one side and 20 kb on the other (total

Detection and annotation of gene cassettes in DNA
sequence data
59-be sites were located in the DNA sequence using a
Transact SQL procedure run in MSSQL 2000. The procedure searched for the conserved regions identified in the
59-be sites of previously analyzed vibrio strains (5':
TAACAA, 3': GCGTTA). The results were then filtered by
ensuring that the distance between the 5' conserved region
and the 3' conserved region fell in a length range of 80 to
150 bp, as previously observed for other vibrio 59-be sites.
These possible 59-be sites were then ranked based on how
well they conformed to the consensus motif found in
other vibrio 59-be sites on a scale of 1 to 20 and potential
59-be sites with scores below 15 (likely false positives)
were discarded.

Once the 59-be sites had been identified, ORFs were
located using another T-SQL procedure and then filtered
by size (>50aa) and proximity to existing 59-be sites.
ORFs that intruded too far (15 bp or more) into a 59-be
site were disregarded or shortened. Overlapping ORFs
were then examined manually and the most likely of them
was retained (usually the ORF with a BLASTP match in the
NCBI database). Once the 59-be sites, gene cassettes and
ORFs had been found, they were automatically annotated
in GenBank format using an ASP.net script. Cassettes in
which no ORF was found according to the criteria defined
above were used as a BLASTX query against the GenBank
database to identify potential pseudogenes. Also, to confirm the "non-coding" nature of these cassettes with no
apparent ORFs, all homologs of such cassettes found
using BLASTN were aligned (>75% of potential non-coding cassettes had homologs). If all homologous cassettes
were conserved across their whole length and no mutation pattern reminiscent of the variability of synonymous
codon positions could be observed, the cassette was confirmed as non-coding. The SQL script used to annotate
gene cassette arrays can be obtained from the authors
upon request.
Comparison of Vibrio gene cassette arrays
The DNA sequences of all integron gene cassette arrays
found in completely sequenced vibrio genomes (along
with the ORFs they encode) were retrieved from the KEGG
database [26]. A PERL script was written to perform reciprocal BLASTP and BLASTN of the gene cassette contents of
two arrays against each other (to detect homologs) and of
an array against itself (to detect paralogs). The script can
be obtained from the authors upon request. A cut-off evalue of 1E-10 was established to determine homology.
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis
The 800 59-be sites present in all gene cassette arrays from
sequenced vibrio genomes as well as the DAT722 array
were identified and retrieved using the Transact SQL pro-

cedure described above. They were then aligned using
CLUSTALW [27]. The alignment was subsequently edited
manually to remove ambiguous characters, leaving 123
unambiguous positions for phylogenetic analysis. The latter was performed in PAUP* 4.04b [28] and applying the
Neighbor-Joining tree reconstruction method using the
GTR (general time-reversible) nucleotide substitution
model. Support values represent the consensus of 100
Neighbor-Joining trees constructed from bootstrap
pseudo-replicates of the original dataset.
Phylogenetic analyses were also carried at the DNA level
for the rpoB gene. Third codon positions did not display
mutational saturation and were therefore included in the
analyses. The rpoB trees were constructed with PAUP*
4.04b, applying the heuristic-search option and using the
TBR branch-swapping algorithm. Maximum likelihood
was used as the tree reconstruction method, with the
nucleotide substitution model (GTR), gamma rates
parameter α, proportion of invariable sites and nucleotide
frequencies determined using MODELTEST [29]. The confidence of each node was determined by building a consensus tree of 100 maximum likelihood trees from
bootstrap pseudo-replicates of the original dataset.
Amino acid alignments of the Vibrio sp. DAT722 gene cassette encoded ORFs and their homologs as well as the IntI
protein family were constructed using CLUSTALW and
edited manually to remove ambiguous characters. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were applied to
these datasets using PROML with the JTT amino acid substitution matrix, a rate heterogeneity model with gammadistributed rates over four categories with the α parameter
estimated using TREE-PUZZLE, global rearrangements
and randomized input order of sequences (10 jumbles).
Bootstrap support values represent a consensus (obtained
using CONSENSE) of 100 Fitch-Margoliash distance trees
(obtained using PUZZLEBOOT and FITCH) from pseudoreplicates (obtained using SEQBOOT) of the original
alignment. The settings of PUZZLEBOOT were the same
as those used for PROML, except that no global rearrangements and randomized input order of sequences are available in this program. PROML, CONSENSE, FITCH and
SEQBOOT are from the PHYLIP package version 3.6a
[30]. TREE-PUZZLE and PUZZLEBLOOT can be obtained
from the programs website [31].
