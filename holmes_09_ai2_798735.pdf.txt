Abstract
Background: Campylobacter jejuni contains a homologue of the luxS gene shown to be responsible
for the production of the signalling molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio
cholerae. The aim of this study was to determine whether AI-2 acted as a diffusible quorum sensing
signal controlling C. jejuni gene expression when it is produced at high levels during mid exponential
growth phase.
Results: AI-2 activity was produced by the parental strain NCTC 11168 when grown in rich
Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) as expected, but interestingly was not present in defined Modified
Eagles Medium (MEM-). Consistent with previous studies, the luxS mutant showed comparable
growth rates to the parental strain and exhibited decreased motility halos in both MEM- and
MHB. Microarray analysis of genes differentially expressed in wild type and luxS mutant strains
showed that many effects on mRNA transcript abundance were dependent on the growth medium
and linked to metabolic functions including methionine metabolism. Addition of exogenously
produced AI-2 to the wild type and the luxS mutant, growing exponentially in either MHB or MEM did not induce any transcriptional changes as analysed by microarray.
Conclusion: Taken together these results led us to conclude that there is no evidence for the role
of AI-2 in cell-to-cell communication in C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168 under the growth conditions
used, and that the effects of the luxS mutation on the transcriptome are related to the
consequential loss of function in the activated methyl cycle.

Background
Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of foodborne diarrhoeal illness in the developed world. In 2000
there were approximately 60 000 reported cases in Eng-

land and Wales [1], and there is an estimated 4 million
infections (with between 200 and 1000 deaths) each year
in the United States [2].

In humans, Campylobacter infection causes a range of
symptoms from mild, watery diarrhoea to severe, bloody
diarrhoea. The illness is self-limiting but infection with
certain serotypes is a common antecedent to Guillain-Barré syndrome [3,4]. Reactive arthritis also occurs in approximately 2% of C. jejuni enteritis [5,6].
In many species of bacteria including enteric pathogens
such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Vibrio cholerae, quorum sensing is thought to play a role in the
expression of factors involved in diverse processes such as
biofilm formation and pathogenesis [7]. Quorum sensing
is the process by which bacteria sense cell density via the
synthesis, secretion and detection of signalling molecules
commonly known as autoinducers. Whole communities
of bacteria are able to control and initiate a concerted
response by sensing a threshold concentration of small
diffusible signalling molecules when a certain cell density
or quorum is reached [8-10].
The only quorum sensing system shared by both Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria involves production
of autoinducer-2 (AI-2), first discovered as a regulator of
bioluminescence in Vibrio harveyi [11]. The precursor of
AI-2, 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), is produced by the enzyme LuxS which has been identified in
over 55 different species [10,12]. DPD undergoes cyclisation to form furanone derivatives which possess the ability to induce bioluminescence in V. harveyi. Since many
bacteria produce the LuxS enzyme, and thus the AI-2 signal, a role of this molecule in inter-species communication has been suggested [12-16]. Different bacteria
respond to AI-2 in different ways. Some, notably Vibrio sp.,
detect the presence of AI-2 using specific two component
signal transduction to initiate a phospho-relay [17-19].
Others, like Salmonella and Escherichia coli possess ABC
transporter proteins which import and modify AI-2
[16,20-22]. In each of these scenarios, the precise chemical nature of AI-2 appears to differ since the binding protein components have been shown to interact with
different, but structurally related molecules. The LuxP AI2 binding protein of V. harveyi was co-crystallized with a
furanosyl-borate
diester
(3A-methyl-5,6-dihydrofuro(2,3-D)(1,3,2)dioxaborole-2,2,6,6A-tetraol; S-THMFborate) [23], whilst LsrB of S. entericia serovar Typhimurium was found in complex with (2R, 4S)-2-methyl2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran (R-THMF) [24].
Other cyclisation derivatives of DPD such as 4-hydroxy-5methyl-3(2H)-furanone (MHF) or a furanosyl carbonate
diester [25] have also been shown to possess AI-2 activity
[14,26].
The LuxS enzyme is an established part of the activated
methyl cycle (AMC) that generates S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) the methyl donor for methylation of RNA,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/214

DNA, proteins and certain metabolites. In this cycle, SAM
is first converted to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH)
which is then detoxified by the Pfs enzyme to generate
adenine and S-ribosyl-L-homocyteine (SRH), the substrate of the LuxS enzyme. In the conversion of SRH to
homocysteine, DPD is produced as a byproduct and derivatives of this with AI-2 activity are found in culture supernatants [14,26]. The homocysteine moiety is then
converted to methionine and subsequently, SAM. Using
AI-2 induced bioluminescence of V. harveyi as a reporter
system, numerous species of bacteria have been shown to
produce AI-2 activity including Helicobacter pylori [27], E.
coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
[22,28,29], Neisseria meningitidis [30-32], Haemophilus
influenza [33]Clostridium difficile [34] and C. jejuni [35].
Many of the AI-2 producing bacteria studied are pathogens, and currently numerous reports concluding that
LuxS and AI-2 contribute to novel signalling systems exist,
although critical evaluation of this data suggests that further studies are required to verify these observations
[10,26,36-38]. The potential importance of LuxS in recycling intermediates in the activated methyl cycle via the
conversion of SRH to homocysteine and then methionine
should not be overlooked. Indeed the disruption of luxS
itself could decrease the virulence of a pathogen through
metabolic perturbations without any involvement of AI-2
in cell-to-cell signalling. Support for this hypothesis
comes from two recent studies in Neisseria meningitidis
where evidence for a proteomic or transcriptional
response to AI-2 was lacking [31,32], but the mutant was
significantly attenuated in vivo [30,39].
Discrimination between the two roles of LuxS/AI-2 is
somewhat hazardous. It is complicated by the existence of
strain variation of LuxS-dependent phenotypes (e.g. in
Serratia [40]), and is likely influenced by the immediate
environment, i.e. whether it is replete or deficient in nutrients that can repair a metabolic imbalance. To establish a
cell-cell communication defect as the underlying cause of
an altered phenotype relies on addition of purified signal
molecule at an appropriate time and concentration to the
cells in the environment under study. Addition of AI-2 or
DPD to biofilm communities has revealed that some
organisms require low levels (amounts undetectable in
the V. harveyi bioluminescent assay (0.08 nM DPD) effectively restored phenotypes for oral commensals Streptococcus oralis and Actinomyces reslundii whilst high levels did
not [41]); and others require levels similar to those
encountered in vivo to complement altered phenotypes
exhibited by luxS mutants (e.g. in Staphylococcus epidermidis [42]). In vivo levels of DPD are in the M range (e.g.
1.95 M V. harveyi and 0.26 M Strept. mutans [43]) Establishing a definitive role for disruption of the AMC in the
maintenance of a phenotype may also be problematic. It

cannot be predicted that the transcription of all the genes
encoding AMC participating enzymes will alter upon
interruption of the cycle, as biochemical pathways are
often controlled by regulation of one or two key enzymes.
Although SAM levels influence methionine de novo synthesis in enteric bacteria, AMC disruption may not result
in major changes in gene expression as growth media contain all the methionine and SAM required by the cells. An
initial step towards greater understanding of the consequences of AI-2 production and luxS inactivation would
be to study transcriptome changes under conditions
where it had been established that AI-2 is produced, and
compare this to non-AI-2-containing conditions.
Planktonic, exponentially growing C. jejuni has been
shown to produce functional AI-2 capable of inducing
bioluminescence in a V. harveyi bioassay whereas culture
supernatants from an isogenic luxS mutant strain had no
effect on bioluminescence [35]. The C. jejuni luxS mutant
was comparable to the wild type in its growth rate and its
ability to resist oxidative stress and invade Caco-2 monolayers, however it showed significantly decreased motility
in semisolid media leading to the suggestion that a quorum sensing role of AI-2 in C. jejuni could involve regulation of motility [35]. In line with this, a null mutation of
luxS in C. jejuni strain 81116 reduced motility and transcription of flaA [44]. Recently, the effect of luxS mutation
in C. jejuni strain 81-176 on global gene expression has
been reported to be limited, with gene expression modulations focused primarily upon genes involved in motility
and metabolism [37]. With the aim of gaining further
insight into the potential role of AI-2 as a quorum sensing
molecule in C. jejuni we set out to determine whether the
repertoire of gene expression changes influenced by LuxS
was strain dependent, and address the primary role of
LuxS in metabolism as suggested by He et al., 2008 [37] To
do this, we analysed the transcriptome of C. jejuni NCTC
11168 and its isogenic luxS mutant grown in both defined
and complex media. Furthermore, exogenous in vitro-produced AI-2 was added back to growing cultures of the luxS
mutant to monitor the transcriptional response induced
by this extracellular signal.

Methods
C. jejuni strains and growth conditions
The bacterial strains used in this study were kindly
donated by Simon Park and Karen Elvers (University of
Surrey). C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168 (wild type) and its
isogenic luxS mutant, LuxS01 [35] were routinely grown at
42°C under microaerobic conditions (10% CO2, 85% N2,
5% O2; all vol/vol) on Skirrow agar plates, in Mueller Hinton broth (MHB; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK), or in MEM-
medium (Invitrogen, UK) on an orbital shaker (380 rpm)
inside a MACS-MG-1000 controlled atmosphere workstation (Don Whitley Scientific, UK). When required, kan-

amycin at a final concentration of 25 g ml-1 (SigmaAldrich, UK) was added to the medium. To test for AI-2
activity, 50 ml of MHB or MEM- was inoculated with C.
jejuni wild type or luxS mutant grown on Skirrow agar and
incubated overnight (16-18 h). A 3% inoculum was then
used to inoculate a fresh 50 ml broth and grown to late
logarithmic phase (approx. 8 h; determined by viable
counts and OD600). Samples were taken at intervals (typically 8 h) during the logarithmic growth phase to test for
AI-2 activity using the V. harveyi bioassay. For this assay 1
ml was removed from each culture and centrifuged at
12000 g, 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was then filtersterilised with a 0.2 m filter unit (Millipore) and stored
at -80°C before analysis.
Motility Assays
Motility assays were performed as described by Elvers and
Park [35] using MHB and MEM- broth, respectively,
both containing 0.4% (wt/vol) agar. Plates were incubated at 37°C and 42°C and motility halos were examined after 16 h, 24 h and 48 h. Parallel experiments were
performed on cultures grown in the presence or absence
of exogenous AI-2.
Analysis of culture supernatants for AI-2 activity
Cell-free culture supernatants were prepared by centrifugation and 0.2 m filtration.

AI-2 activity in supernatants was analysed as described by
Bassler et al. 1997, using 20 l AI-2 extract and 180 l
1:5000 diluted overnight cultured V. harveyi BB170 in AB
medium [13]. Changes in bioluminescence upon addition of AI-2 were determined at 30°C every 30 min using
a combined, automated luminometer-spectrometer
(Anthos Labtech Lucy1). AI-2 activity was defined as the
fold increase in light production in comparison with
medium or buffer controls. For a single experiment, the V.
harveyi bioassay was performed at least in duplicate for
each sample. Experiments were repeated at least three
times.
RNA isolation and purification
Cultures were grown in triplicate as described above and
bacteria were harvested during late logarithmic phase of
growth (approximately 8 h, OD 0.3 and verified by viable
counts) by centrifugation at 3000 g for 20 min. Pellets
were resuspended in 1 ml of Tri Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich,
UK) to which 0.2 ml chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) was
added, mixed by vortexing and equilibrated at room temperature for 10 min. After centrifugation at 12000 g for 15
min the aqueous phase was removed and applied to Qiagen's RNeasy Mini columns for RNA purification according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA removal was
ensured by treatment with DNA-free (Ambion, UK) and

the quality and quantity of RNA was checked using the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, UK).
Construction of the C. jejuni DNA microarray
Internal DNA fragments corresponding to unique segments of the individual open reading frames (ORFs) in
the annotated genome sequence of strain NCTC 11168
[45] were amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers
(Sigma Genosys ORFmer set), then purified and spotted
on GAPSII slides (Corning, USA) using an in-house Stanford designed microarrayer as previously described [46].
Transcriptome analysis
Labelled cDNA was prepared from 15 g RNA using
Stratascript RT (Stratagene, UK) with the direct incorporation of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes (Amersham, UK), applied to
microarrays, washed, scanned and statistically analysed as
described by Holmes et al. [47]. Dye-swapping indicated
that equal dye incorporation occurred. In short, duplicate
microarray experiments were performed for each of the
triplicate RNA samples and each ORF was present on the
microarray in triplicate. The normalised data from each
microarray were unified in one single dataset and reanalysed to identify the differentially expressed genes. Full
methodology of the statistical analysis of the data was previously described [47].
Production of AI-2 in vitro
AI-2 was synthesised essentially as described by Winzer et
al., [26]. 2 mM S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH, purchased
from Sigma) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7·7,
was converted enzymatically to S-ribosylhomocysteine
(SRH) through incubation with purified E. coli Pfs enzyme
(100 g ml-1) at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently, purified E.
coli LuxS (500 g ml-1) was added, and the reaction mixture incubated for a further 2 h. SAH solutions were bubbled with helium before addition of the enzymes and the
reaction mixtures were incubated in an anaerobic cabinet
to prevent oxidation of the reaction products.

Levels of synthesised AI-2 were measured indirectly by
quantification of homocysteine generated via the LuxS
reaction. Homocysteine concentrations were determined
using the Ellmans reagent as previously described [26]. AI2 negative controls, for addition to control cultures, were
prepared as follows: SRH was synthesised enzymatically
as described above and adjusted to the concentration calculated for the AI-2 in vitro reaction, by dilution with reaction buffer and addition of homocysteine and adenine
contained within the same buffer (also yielding the concentrations calculated to be present in the AI-2 in vitro
reaction). Thus, apart from AI-2 (and other DPD derivatives) control and AI-2 positive sample had an identical
composition.

Production of AI-2 using crude cell-extracts
Cell pellets were harvested from exponentially growing C.
jejuni cultures by centrifugation (3000 g for 20 min) and
resuspended in an appropriate volume of 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.7) containing freshly added lysozyme (100 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich UK) and 'Bugbuster
Benzonase' nuclease (1 l ml-1; Novagen UK). After 30
min incubation at 37°C, debris was pelleted by centrifugation (10000 g for 15 min) and the crude cell extracts
transferred to a new microfuge tube. To assess LuxS activity, cell-extracts were added in a 1:1 ratio to 4 mM SAH in
sodium phosphate buffer, or to 2 mM SRH that was enzymatically produced from SAH as previously described
[26]. In each case the resulting mixture was incubated for
2 hours at 37°C, mixed with an equal volume of chloroform, centrifuged, and the aqueous extract analysed for
AI-2 activity using V. harveyi BB170 strain as a bioluminescent reporter [13]. As positive and negative controls for
LuxS activity, cell extracts of E. coli MG1655 and DH5,
respectively, were used, as well as C. jejuni extracts incubated with buffer lacking the substrate.
Addition of exogenous AI-2 to C. jejuni cultures
Cultures of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 and LuxS01 were grown
as described above. After 2.5 h, in vitro-produced AI-2 was
added to test cultures and the AI-2 negative mix was added
to the control cultures as described above. This gave the
cells time to reach exponential growth phase, and ensured
AI-2 levels were maintained throughout the same growth
period as is observed for the WT grown in MHB. Light
assay samples were taken from controls and AI-2 samples
immediately following addition of AI-2, then again at 8 h,
before the cells were harvested and the RNA extracted for
microarray expression analysis.

Results

C. jejuni produces AI-2 in MHB but not MEM-
In line with observations made in other C. jejuni strains
(NCTC 11168, 81116, and 81-176; [37,44,48], we found
that in MHB, AI-2 production and motility by C. jejuni
strain NCTC 11168 was abolished in an isogenic luxS
mutant strain (LuxS01). We set out to understand the
nature of the phenotypes reported for C. jejuni luxS
mutants, which have been attributed to AI-2 mediated
quorum sensing [44,48], or more recently at least in part
to the role of LuxS in central metabolism [37]. To do this,
we monitored the extracellular AI-2 profile during growth
of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 and the isogenic luxS mutant
strain (LuxS01) in a defined medium (MEM-). As in the

rich MHB media, disruption of luxS had no effect on
growth in MEM- (Data not shown). Interestingly, however, the growth medium had a marked effect on AI-2 production. For the first time we demonstrated that in MEM, AI-2 was hardly detectable (Data not shown). These
data suggested that either AI-2 is not released from the cell
in MEM-, or that part of the AMC is not active under
these conditions. To distinguish between the two possibilities, cell extracts of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 were prepared
from cells harvested after 5 h growth and analysed for
LuxS activity (see Methods for details). As positive and
negative controls, cell extracts from E. coli strain MG1655
and strain DH5 containing a luxS frame shift mutation
were used. Whole cell lysates were prepared and SRH
added. Conversion to homocysteine and DPD were
assessed using Ellmans reagent and the V. harveyi bioassay
respectively. In agreement with previous studies [26,49]
crude extracts of E. coli MG1655 contained detectable levels of homocysteine and DPD indicating LuxS activity
(data not shown). However, neither compound was
detectable in cell extracts of E. coli DH5 luxS mutant
(negative control) or C. jejuni NCTC 11168. Neither
growth in MHB nor MEM- to the point when extracellular AI-2 levels are high in MHB (5 h) yielded C. jejuni
NCTC 11168 extracts capable of converting SRH to homocysteine and DPD (i.e. exhibiting LuxS activity), suggesting either lack of DPD production (with detection limit
for AI-2 of approx 6 M) or rapid turnover.
Mutation of luxS alters gene expression in a mediumdependent fashion
Microarrays were employed to compare the transcriptomes of C. jejuni wild type and luxS mutant grown in
either MHB or MEM-. This analysis, which was performed with cells harvested in late exponential growth (8
h after inoculation), revealed a number of differentially
expressed genes [see Additional Files 1 and 2). Interestingly, most of the observed differences were mediadependent and associated with metabolic functions (i.e.
catabolism, anabolism, transport, and energy production). There were also considerably more differentially
expressed genes when the mutant and wild type strains
were grown in MHB rather than in MEM- (131 and 60
genes with a greater than twofold change respectively). 20
genes (comprising 14 probable transcription units) were
differentially expressed in both media (thus comprising a
third of the changes seen in MEM-), suggesting that they
were linked to loss of luxS function. These included genes
with (putative) roles in amino acid and lactate uptake
(Cj0982c and lctP, respectively), electron transport and
respiration (Cj0037, Cj0073, Cj0074, Cj0075, sdhC) and
oxidoreductase reactions (Cj1199, Cj0415). Some of the
identified genes are known to play a role in anabolic pathways such as amino acid (e.g. trpA, trpB, glnA) and fatty
acid (fabI) biosynthesis or central metabolism such as the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/214

tricarboxylic acid cycle (e.g. sdhC). Interestingly, gene
Cj0982c has recently been shown to be involved in
cysteine uptake. The upregulation of this gene in the luxS
mutant is in agreement with the hypothesis that luxS
mutants have an increased requirement for sulphur-containing amino acids [50]. In MEM-, Cj0982 transcript
levels were increased 7.2-fold. Together with Cj1199 (6.2fold), Cj1200 (14.8-fold), and Cj1422c (9.1-fold) this
was one of the most substantial changes observed under
these conditions.
Interestingly, in MHB the largest changes in transcript
abundance were observed for several putative stress
response genes, which were all down-regulated in the luxS
mutant. These include the putative hrcA-grpE-dnaK
operon (Cj0757-Cj0758-Cj0759; 34.1, 28.7, and 21-fold
changes, respectively), and a clpB chaperone homologue
(Cj0509c; 28.1-fold). Smaller changes were also observed
for the putative heat shock regulator hspR (Cj1230; 3.5fold), crpA (Cj1229, encoding a dnaJ like protein; 4-fold)
and the groES-groEL operon (Cj1220-Cj1221; 2.4 and 5.6fold, respectively). Of these, only clpB transcript levels
were also changed in MEM- (2.4-fold). Transcript
changes in MHB were also observed for the putative metabolic genes Cj1364 (fumC; 10.4-fold) and Cj0481 (a
putative class I aldolase; 12.1-fold), as well as the conserved hypothetical Cj1631c (16.7-fold).
For the C. jejuni luxS mutant, reduced motility in MHB
agar plates has been reported [35], a phenotype that was
also confirmed in this study (data not shown). In agreement with these data, a set of 14 genes involved in flagella
assembly and modification was found to be down-regulated in the MHB-grown luxS mutant. This included flaA
(4.2 fold lower) reported previously to be reduced in a
luxS mutant of strain 81116 [44]. Interestingly, the luxS
mutant was also less motile in MEM- based motility
agar, although none of the flagellar genes differentially
expressed in MHB were significantly altered. However in
MEM- the transcript levels of two different putative flagellar genes Cj0336c (motB) and Cj1312 were significantly
reduced.
Two genes whose functions are associated with the AMC
were found to be differentially regulated. In MHB, a 2.6fold reduction of the pfs (Cj0117) transcript level was
observed (Pfs is responsible for providing the LuxS substrate SRH), whereas in MEM- the putative metF
(Cj1202) gene was found to be down-regulated (2.4fold).
Transcriptional changes imposed by mutation of luxS are
not caused by a lack of AI-2-dependent signalling
To test the hypothesis that a lack of extracellular AI-2 was
responsible for the observed changes in the LuxS01 tran-

Discussion
Differentially expressed genes in C. jejuni NCTC 11168
and its luxS mutant
In Vibrio spp, AI-2 functions as an extracellular signalling
molecule. Many other bacteria also possess the enzyme
LuxS and produce extracellular AI-2. Often, the phenotypic differences observed between luxS mutants and wild
types have also been interpreted as AI-2 (i.e. quorum sensing)-dependent in these species. However, the observed
phenotypic changes may be linked to a metabolic imbalance resulting from the disruption of AMC rather than the
lack of an AI-2 signal [36,50]. Both underlying mechanisms have been presented as the basis for phenotypic
modulation in C. jejuni [37,44,48]. In this study, the transcriptomes of exponentially growing C. jejuni NCTC
11168 and its luxS mutant were analysed using microarrays to distinguish between the two possibilities alongside
examining potential strain-specific effects.

The transcriptomes were compared under a number of
different conditions, which included growth in complex
medium (MHB), in defined medium (MEM-), and in the
presence of in vitro synthesized AI-2. Since C. jejuni is asaccharolytic, the main carbon and energy sources drawn

scriptome, in vitro-synthesized AI-2 was added to C. jejuni
cultures. The amount of AI-2 added was adjusted so that
the resulting AI-2 activity at the time point of cell harvest
was comparable to that produced naturally by the wild
type in MHB [see Figure 1]. In the case of the LuxS01
mutant, in vitro synthesized AI-2 was added to both MEM and MHB grown cultures after 2.5 h. As AI-2 was not
produced by the parent strain in MEM-, it was also added
after 2.5 h to test whether gene expression would be
affected by quorum signalling. Levels of AI-2 in the culture
supernatant were measured immediately after addition
(time 0) and then again after incubation for 3.5 h and 5.5
h. Interestingly, AI-2 activity diminished over time when
added to the cultures of the luxS mutant grown in MHB or
MEM- [See Figure 1], suggesting that it was either inactivated or taken up by the cells. A similar reduction of AI-2
was observed for the WT grown in MEM-. Despite this
reduction, levels did not fall significantly below those in
3.5 h cultures where endogenous AI-2 was present. The
cultures were harvested 5.5 h after AI-2 addition (i.e. 8 h
of total growth) and RNA was extracted and assessed for
transcriptional changes using DNA microarrays. No significant changes were observed between control cultures
and those with AI-2 added in the luxS mutant. Parallel
addition of exogenous AI-2 to the luxS mutant did not
restore motility (see materials and methods, data not
shown). This suggests that under the conditions of this
study, extracellular AI-2 was not acting as a signal molecule and was not responsible for the transcriptome differences between wild type and luxS mutant.

Levels of exogenous AI-2 decrease during culture
with C.jejuni. Experiment A: In vitro produced AI-2 (10
M final concentration) was added to LuxS01 mutant after
2.5 h growth in MHB (white bar). A control buffer of enzymatically synthesised SRH supplemented with homocysteine
and adenine control culture but lacking AI-2 was added to
LuxS01 as a control (undetectable AI-2, at baseline). For
comparison production of AI-2 by the wild type NCTC
11168 strain (grey bars) and also a replicate culture to which
the control buffer was added (black bars) is shown. At 0, 3
and 5.5. h after addition of in vitro synthesized AI-2, its activity was measured in the culture supernatant using the V. harveyi light assay. The supernatant activity is expressed as the
fold increase in light production relative to sterile medium as
a control. Experiment B: results for a similar experiment
to that described in experiment A, except that the cultures
were grown in MEM-. As AI-2 was not produced by C.
jejuni in this medium it was added to both the LuxS01 mutant
(white bars) and the wild type strain NCTC 11168 (grey
bars) after 2.5 h in culture. As controls the buffer mixture
lacking AI-2 was added to LuxS01 mutant (undetectable AI-2
thus not indicated) and the wild type strain (black bars). To
investigate the response of LuxS01 and wild type strain to
exogenously added AI-2, cells from experiments A and B
were harvested in late exponential phase for RNA extraction
and microarray gene expression analysis. In both experiments the error bars represent 1 SD from the mean.

upon are likely to be amino acids such as serine, aspartate,
glutamate and proline in both media [51-53]. 60 and 131
genes were differentially regulated when the strains were
grown in MEM- and MHB, respectively. Furthermore, 20
of these genes were differentially expressed in both media.
Two of these genes (cj1199 and cj1200, located immediately downstream of luxS) were similarly modulated in
the transcriptome analysis of the C. jejuni 81-176 luxS
mutant [37]. The difference in the MHB profiles generated
by He et al., 2008 [37] and this study, may reflect an
altered genetic background in the two strains or the different growth conditions (8 versus 17 hours of growth, late
exponential versus stationary growth phase, and shaken
versus static cultures). Comparing our data with that of He
et al., 2008 [37], 14% of the genes showing differential
expression in this study were also noted by He et al., 2008
[37] using microarrays and RT-PCR, with 60% of these
being
modulated
in
the
same
direction.
Overall, this indicates that inactivation of luxS influenced
the expression of numerous genes, either directly or indirectly. However rather than a global affect on gene expression, there is a selection of genes modulated. None of
these changes could be reversed by the addition of in vitro
synthesized AI-2 under the conditions tested, suggesting
that lack of AI-2 activity in the culture medium was not
responsible for the observed differences. This contrasts to
the situation in Streptococcus mutans, where exogenous AI2 restored the level of gene expression some genes (e.g.
acid tolerance, bacterocin synthesis and oxidative stress
tolerance), but not others (including transcriptional regulators and membrane transporters)[54]. The exact mechanistic link between luxS mutation and the observed
transcriptional changes is still not well understood. Several possibilities exist, which include an increased metabolic burden (due to the inability to salvage the
homocysteine unit of SAH), accumulation of toxic intermediates, or a lack of DPD (which may be used as a precursor for biosynthetic purposes not connected with
signalling). While the latter two possibilities can not be
excluded, at least some of the observed changes are related
to the metabolism of sulphur amino acids and, thus, can
be interpreted as a response of the cell to the disruption of
the AMC.
One of the genes up-regulated in the luxS mutant in both
MHB and MEM- is cj0982c, the product of which is a
periplasmic binding protein specific for L-cysteine and
has been proposed to be part of an ABC transporter
involved in cysteine uptake [55]. The increased expression
of this gene may reflect the need of the luxS mutant to
counteract the loss of homocysteine salvage by increasing
cysteine uptake from the environment. There is also some
homology between Cj1200 and the D-methionine-binding lipoprotein MetQ involved in import of D-methio-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/214

nine, although there is a second closer homologue
elsewhere
on
the
C.
jejuni
chromosome.
Expression of the putative metF gene (Cj1202) was
reduced in the luxS mutant grown in MEM- and also in
the stationary phase cells analysed by He et al., 2008 [37].
MetF (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) catalyses the
formation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a cofactor
required for providing a methyl group during the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. The observed downregulation of metF could be the consequence of a regulatory mechanism that responds to the reduced availability
of homocysteine. A very similar situation is present in S.
Typhimurium [20], where inactivation of luxS reduced the
expression of metE. In S. Typhimurium, metE expression is
positively regulated by MetR and homocysteine is known
to considerably stimulate this activation [56,57]. Thus,
reduced intracellular homocysteine level in the S. Typhimurium luxS mutant appears to be responsible for the
reduced metE expression. A similar mechanism may have
led to differential expression of metF in C. jejuni NCTC
11168 luxS. Another example of a differentially regulated
AMC gene is pfs (Cj0117). This gene, which was up-regulated in the luxS mutant in MHB both in logarithmic
phase (this study) and in stationary phase [37], is required
for the conversion of SAH (for the purpose of detoxification and salvage of the resulting homocysteine and adenine moieties). The increase in pfs transcript levels could
be the result of a regulatory mechanism responding to the
concentration of AMC derivatives. Little is known about
the regulation of luxS and pfs in different bacteria, but at
least in S. Typhimurium, pfs expression depends on
growth conditions and growth phase, whereas luxS is
expressed constitutively [58].
The differential expression pattern of other genes is more
difficult to explain and future work will need to address
the regulatory mechanisms that respond to the intracellular changes associated with AMC disruption. Of particular
interest in this context are the genes that encode putative
homologues of enzymes involved in major metabolic
pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Cj0438
[sdhB], Cj0439 [sdhC], Cj1364 [fumC]), fatty acid biosynthesis (Cj0116 [fabD], Cj0441 [acpP], Cj1400 [fabI]), and
amino acid biosynthesis (Cj0346 [trpD], Cj0347 [trpF],
Cj0348 [trpB], Cj0349 [trpA], Cj0405 [aroE], Cj0891
[serA], Cj1599 [hisB], Cj1600 [hisF], Cj1601 [hisA]) only
some of which are differentially expressed in both media
[see Additional Files 1 and 2]. Also, it is not clear why
major stress response genes were down regulated in the
luxS mutant and why this change is only seen in MHB but
not MEM-, as a metabolic defect would have been
expected to generate stress conditions, rather than to
reduce them. It is also noteworthy that the profile of
stress-response linked genes differentially expressed in

this study was not the same as that observed in the MHB
grown stationary phase cells analysed by He et al., 2008
[37], emphasizing that growth conditions have a significant influence upon gene expression. It is interesting that
in this study the stress response was observed under the
conditions where high levels of AI-2 were produced by the
wild type. It must be emphasised, however, that these
changes could not be reversed by the addition of exogenous AI-2, which argues against a role of quorum sensing
in this response.
Contrary to a previous report [48], no downregulation of
the cytolethal distending toxin genes (cdtA, B and C:
Cj0079c, Cj0078c, Cj0077c respectively) was observed in
the luxS mutant. This may be a reflection of the different
growth times (we used 8 h, they 3 days), or strains used in
the two studies (81116 by Jeon et al., 2005, NCTC 11168
here).
From Tables 1 and 2 [see Additional files 1 and 2] it is
apparent that several sets of neighbouring genes were differentially regulated in a similar manner, suggesting that
they may form operons and that their encoded proteins
might function in the same pathways. For instance, the
hypothetical iron-sulphur proteins Cj0073, Cj0074,
Cj0075 appear to be transcriptionally linked with the
putative lactate permease gene Cj0076 (lctP). Other examples include some of the flagellar genes, amino acid biosynthesis genes, and heat shock genes.
Of particular interest is the observed down-regulation of
14 putative flagella genes in the MHB-grown C. jejuni
NCTC 11168 luxS mutant. This is in agreement with the
reduction of motility in semi-solid MHB agar plates, as
previously described for strains NCTC 11168 [35] and
81116 [44]. However, is in contrast to the recently published transcriptional data of the luxS mutant of C. jejuni
strain 81-176 [37]. This may reflect the co-ordinate regulation exerted upon flagellar components and regulators,
which, as He et al. 2008 [37] pointed out, is influenced by
bacterial growth phase and environmental factors. Both
genes encoding cheomotaxis proteins (Cj0363, Cj0284c
(CheA) and Cj0144) as well as the flagellin genes flaA and
flaB were among those found to be down-regulated in the
present study. The former may impact upon motility [59],
and the latter matches the findings of Jeon et al. (2003),
who reported reduced flaA expression for C. jejuni 81116
luxS, and showed that the flagellar structure was still preserved in this strain [44]. Reduced motility of the C. jejuni
NCTC 11168 luxS mutant was also observed in MEM-
based agar plates (data not shown), although only the
flagellar motor protein motB and the putative flagellar
gene cj1312 were down-regulated under these conditions.
A loss of LuxS function impacts on motility-associated
genes in a range of different bacteria. For enterohemor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/214

rhagic E. coli (EHEC), H. pylori, and C. jejuni a role of AI-2
in the regulation of motility associated genes has been
proposed [35,44,60,61]. At least for C. jejuni, this view is
not supported by the data contained within the present
study. The defect in motility caused by deletion of luxS in
H. pylori was shown to be restored by addition of cell free
medium containing AI-2 [62], but this could not be demonstrated for the C. jejuni luxS mutant in this study. The
flagella regulator flhA was also shown to be induced by
addition of AI-2 in a luxS mutant background providing
further evidence for the role of AI-2 in the global regulation of flagella gene transcription [62]. In contrast, transcription of flhA was not altered in a luxS mutant of C.
jejuni (this study and [37]). A phylogenetic tree of the
LuxS protein revealed that the LuxS of C. jejuni is phylogenetically distant to that of H. pylori which could, in part,
explain differences in function between the LuxS protein
in C. jejuni and H. pylori [63]. Since it was probably
acquired independently in the two species, the primary
role taken on by luxS (gene regulation versus metabolic)
would differ depending on what other pathways were
already established.
AI-2 production and degradation
Virtually no AI-2 activity was detectable when C. jejuni
NCTC 11168 was grown in MEM-. This could be due to
a lack of AI-2 export, rapid intracellular turnover of DPD
or AI-2 or lack of luxS or pfs expression and thus DPD synthesis. The latter possibility could not be ruled out, as it
was not possible to detect Pfs and LuxS enzyme activity in
cell extracts obtained from strain NCTC 11168 growing in
MEM- or in MHB. The reason for this remains unclear, as
SAH and SRH conversion could be detected in similarly
prepared E. coli cell extracts. It could be that in C. jejuni,
enzyme activity levels are below those detectable in the
assay. There is unlikely to be an absence of pfs expression
in MEM-, as previous studies have indicated modulated
pfs expression [58] rather than an on/off control. Moreover, pfs mutations cause severe growth defects [64]. Given
the absence of a growth defect in MEM-, Pfs is likely to
be present. In support of this, although the differential
expression was not significant (confidence level was 18%,
based on two separate P-values; slope and intercept), the
luxS mutant had 1.9 fold more pfs expression than the WT
in MEM-. The overall differential gene expression
detected in MEM- suggests that the WT, but not the
mutant produces LuxS.

Exogenous AI-2 activity gradually diminished when
added to MHB or MEM- grown C. jejuni cultures suggesting either uptake or degradation. However, C. jejuni does
not seem to possess an AI-2 uptake system homologous to
that found in S. Typhimurium and E. coli. In these organisms, AI-2 induces the expression of the lsr ABC transporter [16,20,22]. AI-2 is reported to be cleaved following

Page 8 of 11

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:214

phosphorylation into PG and another unidentified C3
fragment [65]. Modulation of the lsr operon (with approximately 10 fold magnitude) can be detected using microarrays to compare transcriptomes of WT and luxS mutants
of E. coli [66] and although a similar system may exist in
C. jejuni, the complete lack of AI-2-responsive genes suggests that uptake is not inducible by AI-2. He et al., 2008
[37] were also not able to select a potential uptake mechanism and noted the lack of sequence similarity that hampers the identification of ABC transporters involved in AI2 uptake. Interestingly, extensive analysis could not identify an AI-2 receptor of either the ABC transporter or two
component regulator type in C. jejuni [67]. Since the
reported E. coli lsr regulation [66] was media-dependent,
it cannot be ruled out that regulation of an uptake system
in C. jejuni would occur under different conditions e.g. in
biofilms [38]. Moreover, in addition to acting as a signal
molecule under certain environmental conditions, the
activity of AI-2 may be influenced by the phase of growth;
for example, when extracellular AI-2 levels are maximal in
late exponential/stationary phase. Further studies are
therefore required to complete the characterization of the
basis for phenotypic alterations caused by LuxS/AI-2 in C.
jejuni, and these should carefully assess the effect of a
range AI-2 concentrations and growth conditions to be
fully conclusive.

Conclusion
Whatever the C. jejuni strain investigated, it is apparent
that mutation of luxS impacts upon expression of a subset
of defined genes rather than with a pleotropic global
change in the transcriptome. The genes modulated are primarily metabolic in nature and reflect the growth phase
and nutritional environment of the cells analysed. Since
exogenously added AI-2 had no impact on gene expression, it can be concluded that in C. jejuni strain NCTC
11168 this product of LuxS does not act as part of a quorum sensing machinery under the conditions used in this
study.
