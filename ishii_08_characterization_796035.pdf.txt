Abstract
Background: Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are devices that exploit microorganisms to generate
electric power from organic matter. Despite the development of efficient MFC reactors, the
microbiology of electricity generation remains to be sufficiently understood.
Results: A laboratory-scale two-chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC) was inoculated with rice paddy
field soil and fed cellulose as the carbon and energy source. Electricity-generating microorganisms
were enriched by subculturing biofilms that attached onto anode electrodes. An electric current of
0.2 mA was generated from the first enrichment culture, and ratios of the major metabolites (e.g.,
electric current, methane and acetate) became stable after the forth enrichment. In order to
investigate the electrogenic microbial community in the anode biofilm, it was morphologically
analyzed by electron microscopy, and community members were phylogenetically identified by 16S
rRNA gene clone-library analyses. Electron microscopy revealed that filamentous cells and rodshaped cells with prosthecae-like filamentous appendages were abundantly present in the biofilm.
Filamentous cells and appendages were interconnected via thin filaments. The clone library analyses
frequently detected phylotypes affiliated with Clostridiales, Chloroflexi, Rhizobiales and
Methanobacterium. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization revealed that the Rhizobiales population
represented rod-shaped cells with filamentous appendages and constituted over 30% of the total
population.
Conclusion: Bacteria affiliated with the Rhizobiales constituted the major population in the
cellulose-fed MFC and exhibited unique morphology with filamentous appendages. They are
considered to play important roles in the cellulose-degrading electrogenic community.

Background
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are devices that exploit microorganisms to generate electric power from organic matters
and potentially applicable to wastewater treatment and

energy recovery from organic wastes [1-4]. Recent technical developments of MFC processes are noteworthy, and
the power output of MFC has been rapidly increasing in
recent several years [1]. Some workers consider that MFCs

will be practically applied in the near future, but further
studies, such as stability improvements and scale-up evaluations, are necessary for that.

established on graphite anodes, which allowed us to suggest a bacterial lineage important for electricity generation.

A conventional MFC reactor is comprised of two chambers, the anode and cathode chambers [1-4]. In the anode
chamber, organic matter is oxidized to carbon dioxide by
microorganisms under anaerobic conditions, reducing
equivalents are discharged to the anode as electrons, and
these electrons are transferred to the cathode. Protons are
simultaneously generated in the anode chamber, passively transferred to the cathode chamber through a membrane and react with oxygen molecules on the cathode
electrode to form water molecules. All these steps influence the total efficiency (e.g., power density, coulombic
efficiency and organic-loading rate [1]) of a MFC process,
and each of these steps has been a subject for technical
improvement. For example, the membrane has been optimized to achieve efficient proton transfer [5] and the cathode was modified to accelerate the proton-reducing
reaction [6].

Results

It has been suggested that in addition to process optimization, the understanding of ecology and physiology of electricity-generating microorganisms (EGMs in this study;
other studies use the terms exoelectrogens [2] and electricigens [3]) is necessary for further improvement and
reliable operation of MFCs. In order to identify what
organisms are involved in electricity generation, microbial
communities established in anode chambers have been
analyzed by molecular ecological approaches [7-9].
Although metal-reducing bacteria, such as Geobacter [10]
and Shewanella [11], have been considered as model
EGMs, they have not always been detected in MFCs, and
electrogenic populations seem to be more diverse than
previously thought [7-9]. Physiological studies aim to
reveal how these microorganisms transfer electrons to
anodes. Recent studies have suggested that Geobacter and
Shewanella use electrically conductive extracellular filaments (termed nanowires) for transferring electrons to
solid electron acceptors, such as graphite anodes [12-14].
However, it is unclear whether or not other EGMs occurring in MFCs also use nanowires. Many important questions remain unanswered concerning microbiology of
electricity generation (electrogenesis).
In this study, electrogenic communities established in a
cellulose-fed MFC were analyzed. Cellulose was selected
as a substrate, because it is one of the major constituents
of waste biomass. Previous studies have analyzed cellulolytic methanogenic communities in anaerobic digesters
[15,16]; but so far only a few studies have examined cellulolytic electrogenic communities [17]. Our analysis here
emphasizes the morphological characterization and phylogenetic identification of microorganisms in biofilms

Electricity generation from cellulose
An H-type two-chamber MFC similar to those previously
reported [1,10,18] was constructed, and its performance
was evaluated using Geobacter sulfurreducens [10] as a
model EGM. It was demonstrated that the reactor performance was equivalent to those previously [10].

The anode chamber of the MFC was inoculated with the
rice paddy field soil and supplemented with cellulose.
Current outputs of approximately 0.2 mA were immediately detected (Fig. 1), while no current was observed in
the control MFC (no soil inoculation) (data not shown).
During the initial 25 days, acid fermentation proceeded in
the anode chamber, resulting in the accumulation of acetate and propionate and a drop in the current. After the
pH was adjusted to 7 by adding a Na2CO3 solution, methane was actively produced (from day 30 to 45 in phase I).
When the cation-exchange membrane cracked and the
anode medium leaked into the cathode chamber due to a
high gas pressure in the anode chamber, the biofilm-harbouring anode was transferred to a new anode chamber
containing fresh medium. In these phases of subcultures
(phases II to V), the MFC system also produced a current
of 0.2 mA to 0.3 mA (the maximum current of 0.31 mA,
equivalent to 10 mW m-2 [per anode surface] and 0.15 W
m-3 [per anode-chamber working volume]), while methane production was slower than that in phase I. Hydrogen
was not detected (below 5 Pa in the headspace). Production rates of electron (estimated from electric currents),
methane, hydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in these
phases are summarized in Table 1. Acetate was produced
and accumulated constantly, while only small amounts of
the other VFAs were produced. Short-chain alcohols (ethanol, propanol and butanol) were not detected throughout the experiment. The pH in the anode chamber
gradually dropped and was occasionally adjusted to 7 by
adding a Na2CO3 solution (Fig. 1). Electric current was
tightly linked to pH fluctuations. As shown in Table 1, the
performance of the MFC became stable in phases IV and
V, indicating that the enrichment of microbial populations was accomplished in these phases. When potassium
ferricyanide was added to the cathode chamber (from
days 87 to 96 in Fig. 1), the electric current was increased
to approximately 0.8 mA. The methane-production rate
decreased from 0.44 mmol day-1 to 0.32 mmol day-1 during this period (Table 1). The coulombic efficiency was
not calculated, since the rate of cellulose degradation
could not be accurately determined.

subjected to field emission-scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM).
Electron micrographs revealed unique biofilm structures
and cell shapes (Figs. 2 and 3). Photos show that biofilms
were sparsely distributed on the graphite fibers (Fig. 3A)
along with highly complicated structures comprised of
morphologically different cells and cellulose fibers (Fig.
2B). Many rod-shaped cells had long filamentous appendages (approximately 100 nm in thickness) that, as seen at
the edge of the biofilm (Figs. 2C), bridged between microbial cells and the electrodes. In other cases, cells themselves were filamentous and occasionally intertwined
with each other (Fig. 2D). Rods with filamentous appendages seemed to be more abundant than filamentous cells.

time when the cathode chamber was supplemented with

Resazurin and cysteine may act as electron shuttles and
substrates, respectively. When resazurin was omitted from
the anode medium, the same level of current was generated (data not shown), suggesting that other electrontransfer mechanisms existed in our MFC. The amount of
cysteine added was less than one tenth than that of cellulose. Considering the results of a previous study [18]
where cysteine was shown to be the sole carbon source for
electricity generation, it is likely that cysteine was rapidly
depleted and did not largely affect methane and electricity
production in latter days of each phase. In fact, cysteine
was depleted within 14 days after commencing a new
phase of enrichment culture (data not shown).
Biofilm morphology
In phases II to V, most of the microorganisms adhered
onto the anodes and formed biofilms. The culture media
in the anode chamber became a transparent brown color,
and cell concentrations were below 107 cells ml-1 (as determined by the DAPI [4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole] direct
count method using an epifluorescence microscope [19]).
In order to examine the morphology of anode biofilms,
biofilm samples were taken on day 216 (phase IV) and

Magnified electron micrographs revealed the presence of
large amounts of thin, thread-like appendages (approximately 10 nm in thickness) that interconnected microbial
cells and thick filamentous appendages (Fig. 3AB). We
also observed G. sulfurreducens PCA cells adhering onto
the anode electrodes (Fig. 3CD) and found that they had
an abundance of thin network filaments (20 to 30 nm in
thickness) that were somewhat thicker than the thin
thread-like appendages in the soil-derived biofilms. These
observations revealed that a variety of filamentous structures were present in the anode biofilms.
Phylogenetic composition
The unique morphology of the anode biofilm prompted
us to identify what organisms constituted these biofilms.
For this purpose, we constructed 16S rRNA gene clone
libraries for the phases I to V communities, and compared
them to each other. As described in previous papers, 16S
rRNA gene clone library analyses suffer from the biases
associated with PCR amplification [20]. To obviate this
limitation as much as possible, we selected the universal
PCR primer set that has been reliably used in previous
studies (for example, reference [21]), and PCR cycles were
minimized. In addition, we constructed clone libraries for
a microbial community in the soil and those in the MFC
in the different phases and compared phylotypes in these
libraries, allowing us to identify sequences that specifically occurred in one library.

The rarefaction-curve analysis (Fig. 4) showed that the
biofilm communities were much less diverse than the soil
community; the biofilm libraries seemed to be comprised
of 20 to 30 different phylotypes. This analysis indicates
that the biofilm libraries covered most organisms in the
anode biofilms.
Results of the sequence analysis are summarized in Table
2 and show the phylogenetic affiliations of the major phylotypes (those including more than 5 clones). Informa-

tion regarding the minor phylotypes (indicated as others
in Table 2) is provided upon request to the authors. It was
shown that most clones were affiliated with the domain
Bacteria, while others were affiliated with the Archaea
(closely related to Methanobacterium). No sequences of the
Eukarya were obtained. Large portions (80% to 90%) of
the biofilm clones were categorized into the major phylotypes (Table 2). The libraries for biofilms in the functionally stable phases (phases IV and V) were comprised of 7
or 8 major phylotypes (those including more than 5
clones); among them, 2 Clostridiales (Mfc-2 and Mfc-3),
Chloroflexi (Mfc-6), Rhizobiales (Mfc-9) and Euryarchaeota
(Mfc-11) were stably present in these libraries. Mfc-5
increased in the phase-V library, while Mfc-8 decreased.
The stably present phylotypes may have represented
important populations in these phases of MFC.
Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH)
Among the stably present phylotypes, Mfc-6 is affiliated
with Chloroflexi Subphylum I that is comprised of filamen-

tous microorganisms present in anaerobic digesters
[22,23], whereas Mfc-9 is affiliated with Rhizobiales that
include prosthecate bacteria (e.g, Hyphomicrobium [24])
known to possess filamentous appendages called 'prosthecae' [25-27]. In order to investigate the cell morphologies of bacteria represented by these phylotypes, we
carried out FISH with specific oligonucleotide probes
Hypho1241 [24] and GNSB941 [22]. The nucleotide
sequence of probe Hypho1241 was 100% matched with
Mfc-6, and the other phylotypes obtained in the present
study had more than two mismatches. GNSB941 was
100% matched with phylotypes affiliated with Chloroflexi
Subphylum I, among which Mfc-6 was the only phylotype
abundantly obtained; non-Chloroflexi Subphylum I phylotypes had more than two mismatches. As shown in panel
D in Fig. 5, the FISH result shows that GNSB941 labelled
filamentous cells. On the other hand, Hypho1241
labelled rod-shaped cells (panel B), and Nano orange
staining showed that some of these cells had filamentous
appendages (panel A). Cells with filamentous appendages

were relatively few, probably because filamentous cells
were difficult to be detached from the biofilm. Nevertheless, it was shown that Hypho1241-labeled cells were
abundantly present (38% ± 5% [SD, n = 5] of the Nano
orange-stained total cells).

Discussion
The present study investigated the electrogenic biofilm
communities established in the anode chamber of a cellulose-fed MFC. In our MFC system, methane was produced
along with current (Fig. 1 and Table 1). As 8 moles of electrons are used to biologically produce one mole of methane from carbon dioxide, it is estimated that methane
production and electricity generation nearly equally contributed to the terminal electron-accepting reaction in the
stable enrichments (phases IV and V). When the cathode
was supplemented with ferricyanide (day 87), however,
the current was increased to 0.8 mA, while the methaneproduction rate decreased. In addition, when the external
resistor was changed to 100 Ω, the current was increased
to over 0.5 mA (data not shown). These results indicate
that the electricity generation was suppressed by instrumental limitations of the MFC system. We therefore conclude that electricity generation is superior to methane
production in the terminal electron-accepting reaction
coupled to cellulose oxidation. From the metabolite analysis, acetate was considered to be one of the major inter-

The FE-SEM observation revealed three distinctive morphological features of biofilm organisms in the cellulosefed MFC (Figs. 2 and 3). First, many cells were straight filaments, while some were spiral. Second, many rodshaped cells had thick filamentous appendages. Third, filamentous cells and thick filamentous appendages were
interconnected to each other via thin filaments. Several
previous studies have reported SEM pictures of biofilms
on anodes [7,10], while no reports have documented the
presence of filamentous cell structures in these biofilms.
Several factors can be considered to explain this difference. First, there were differences in the MFC operational
conditions, including organic substrates, inorganic ingredients and seed inocula. In addition, our high-resolution
FE-SEM may have facilitated the detection of thin filaments of the biofilm microorganisms, including the network filaments of Geobacter (Fig. 3). Recent studies have
suggested that metal-reducing bacteria, such as Geobacter
and Shewanella species, utilize electrically conductive
nanowires to discharge electrons to extracellular electron
acceptors [12-14]. Interestingly, we found that the naturally occurring electrogenic biofilm (enriched from soil)
produced an abundance of filaments that connected the
microbial cells to the electrode and interconnected to each
other. There have been several reports presenting microscopic observations of microbial communities engaged in
methanogenic cellulose degradation [15,16]; however, filamentous structures were not abundant in these communities. In addition, methanogenic biofilms enriched on
graphite fibers from the same soil did not include filamentous appendages (our unpublished data). From these
data, we postulate that the filamentous structures should
be important for electron transfer to the anode, although
other mechanisms, such as the use of electron shuttles [9],
should also be taken into account.
Environmental rRNA gene sequences have been used to
infer properties and ecological roles of organisms that
they represent [21,28], although this type of analysis may
only be possible if some common properties are known
for isolated organisms affiliated with the same phylogenetic group. This study attempted to deduce ecological
roles of microorganisms represented by the major phylotypes in the stable enrichment phases (phases IV and V in
Table 2). Two major phylotypes, Mfc-2 and Mfc-3, were
affiliated with the order Clostridiales and closely related to
the genera Clostridium [29] and Propionispora [30], respectively. These genera have been known to include anaerobic fermentative organisms that degrade complex (e.g.,
cellulose) and simple (e.g., glucose) carbohydrates. Since
the other major phylotypes were not related to cellulolytic
anaerobes, we deduce that these clostridia were involved

in cellulose degradation. Phylotype Mfc-6 was affiliated
with Chloroflexi subphylum I [22,23]. Organisms affiliated
with this subphylum are known to be filamentous organisms and ferment sugars [23]. Cell morphology of this
group of organisms in the MFC was confirmed by the
FISH analysis (Fig. 5). Mfc-7 and Mfc-8 were affiliated
with the orders Bacteroidales and Spirochaetales, respec-

tively. Organisms in these groups have commonly been
detected in anaerobic digesters (for example, reference
[31]). Although the ecological roles of these organisms in
the anaerobic digestion are unclear, they are considered to
ferment small carbohydrates and amino acids [31]. In
addition, Mfc-11 should have represented hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

Mfc-9 was affiliated with the order Rhizobiales. The database search indicated that it was closely related to strain
RR54, a bacterium isolated from the roots of rice plants
(an unpublished strain only found in the nucleotide
sequence databases). In addition, Mfc-9 was also related
to strains belonging to Rhizobiaceae and Hyphomicrobiaceae. A common feature of these organisms is that they
are facultatively aerobic heterotrophs [32], suggesting that
they have respiratory electron-transport chains. Another
feature shared by many strains in this group is that they
possess one or several long cylindrical appendages called
'prosthecae' [25-27]. Prosthecae are sticky filaments that
play important roles when prosthecate bacteria adhere
onto solid surfaces [25]. The prosthecae-like appendages
of Mfc-9 bacteria were shown in the FISH analysis (Fig. 5).
The FISH data also confirmed that Mfc-9 bacteria were
abundantly present in the anode biofilms. It is also note-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/6

worthy that bacteria belonging to the Rhizobiaceae are
known to have efficient uptake hydrogenases that allow
them to recycle hydrogen generated in the nitrogen fixation process within legume nodules [33,34]. Most importantly, different from the other major phylotypes
obtained in the present study, Rhizobiales sequences have
not been found in cellulolytic methanogenic communities in anaerobic digesters [15,16]. We have conducted the
phylogenetic analysis of a biofilm community attaching
onto graphite fibers that was enriched from the same
paddy field soil and engaged only in methanogenic cellulose degradation; in that analysis, no Rhizobiales phylotype was recovered (our unpublished data). From these
analyses, we suggest that Mfc-9 abundantly occurred in
the anode biofilm in response to electricity generation
and may have been involved in the electricity generation.
In order to investigate their activities and physiology, they

should be isolated for pure-culture studies. In addition,
we are also interested in investigating properties (e.g.,
electric conductivity and adhesiveness) and the roles of
thick and thin filaments abundantly present in the anode
biofilm.

Conclusion
In a MFC reactor, a microbial community enriched from
rice paddy soil generated electricity of up to 0.3 mA by utilizing cellulose as the energy source. Microbiological analyses revealed that Rhizobiales bacteria with filamentous
appendages constituted the major population in the
anode biofilm. Comparative analyses based on available
physiological information of closely related bacterial isolates suggest that they were possibly involved in the electricity generation. Isolation of these Rhizobiales bacteria
will deepen our understanding of how microbes generate
electricity from cellulose.

Methods
Microorganisms and culture conditions
G. sulfurreducens PCA (= DSM 12127) was obtained from
Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH. The growth medium contained the following (per liter): 0.1 g of KCl, 0.2 g of NH4Cl, 0.6 g of
NaH2PO4, 10 ml of a vitamin solution [35], 10 ml of a
trace element solution [35], 50 µl of a titanium citrate
solution [36], 10 mM acetate and 40 mM fumarate. Cultivation was conducted in a bottle (125 ml in capacity,
sealed with a Teflon-coated butyl rubber septum and
secured with a crimped aluminum cap) containing 50 ml
of the medium at 30°C under an atmosphere of N2 and
CO2 (80/20 [v/v]) with shaking. Cultivation was initiated
by inoculating with 5 ml of a preculture in the same
medium. Rice paddy field soil was obtained at Kamaishi,
Japan in August 2005.

the vitamin solution, 1 ml of the trace element solution, 1
ml of a Se/W solution [35], 1 mg of resazurin and 0.5 g of
L-cysteine per liter (pH 6.8) and supplemented with 6 g l1 cellulose (Avicel, Asahi Kasei) as a substrate. The headspace of the anode chamber was filled with N2 and CO2
(80/20 [v/v]). The cathode chamber was filled with 300
ml of a sterilized 30 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) supplemented with 0.1 g of KCl, 0.2 g of NH4Cl and 0.6 g of
NaH2PO4 and bubbled with the filter-sterilized air. Potassium ferricyanide (20 mM) was occasionally used as an
oxidizing agent in the cathode chamber. The anode chamber was inoculated with rice paddy field soil (3.5 g [wet
weight]) and slowly agitated using a magnetic stirrer. The
MFC reactor was operated in a temperature-controlled
room (at 30°C). The two electrodes were connected with
an electric cable and an external resistor (510 Ω), and a
voltage across the resistor was measured using a potentiostat (multipotentiostat 2092, Toho Giken). An electric
current was converted to moles of electron using the following equations and constants; 1 C = 1 A × 1 s, 1 C = 6.24
× 1018 electrons, and 1 mol = 6.02 × 1023 electrons
(96,500 C mol-1). The pH of the anode medium was occasionally adjusted to 7 by adding a Na2CO3 solution (5%
[w/v]). When the cation-exchange membrane was cracked
or the electric current dropped independent of pH, the
biofilm-bearing anode electrodes were taken out from the
anode chamber and transferred to a new anode chamber
containing the fresh medium; this was done in an anaerobic glove box filled with N2 and CO2 (80/20 [v/v]).

MFC configuration and operation
An H-type two-chamber MFC similar to those previously
reported [1,10,17] was constructed using two glass vessels
(each 450 ml in capacity) connected with a glass tubing
and a pinch-clump assembly. Liquids in the two chambers
were separated by a cation-exchange membrane (Neosepta CIMS, Astom). The top of each chamber was covered
with a glass dome with three sampling ports. All junctions
and sampling ports were sealed with tight butyl-rubber
stoppers. Anode electrodes were bundled graphite fibers
(6 µm in diameter, 5000 fibers per anode) (Sogo carbon,
Yokohama), while a cathode electrode was an unpolished
graphite plate with no catalyst (3 cm × 10 cm × 0.5 cm)
(the Fuel cell store Japan, Hamamatsu).

Chemical analyses
After a liquid sample was passed through a 0.22 µm pore
membrane (type GV, Millipore), volatile fatty acids were
analyzed using a high-pressure liquid chromatography
(Organic acid analysis system, Shimadzu) equipped with
CDD detector and dual packed columns (Shim-pack
SCR102-H, Shimadzu). As an eluant, a mixture of an
equal volume of 5 mM p-toluenesulfonic acid solution
and 20 mM Bis-Tris solution containing 5 mM p-toluenesulfonic acid and 100 µM EDTA was used at 0.8 ml min1. The filtrate was acidified with concentrated HCl, and
short-chain alcohols were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-2010; Shimadzu) with a flame ionization
detector and a DB-FFAP column (Shimadzu). Methane,
hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide at the headspace
of the anode chamber were measured using a gas chromatograph (GC-14A, Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector and parallel packed columns
(molecular sieve 5A 60–80/porapack Q 80–100, Shimadzu) as described previously [35]. Cysteine was measured as described elsewhere [36].

After sterilization, the anode chamber was filled with 300
ml of a sterilized anaerobic MFC medium comprised of
0.1 g of KCl, 0.2 g of NH4Cl, 0.6 g of NaH2PO4, 1 ml of

FE-SEM
FE-SEM was performed as described previously [35]. A
small portion of graphite fibers harbouring biofilms were

carefully removed from the anode electrode, and the biofilm cells were fixed with 1.25% glutaraldehyde and 1.3%
osmium tetraoxide. After cells were dehydrated using a
graded series of ethanol solutions, they were dried using
an HCP-2 drier (Hitachi). The resultant specimen was
coated with osmium using a CVD coating device (Hitachi)
and observed under an S4500 FE-SEM (Hitachi) at 5 kV.
PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA
gene fragments
Total DNA was extracted from the rice paddy field soil
(0.5 g) and biofilms on graphite fiber electrodes (approximately 0.5 g) using FAST DNA spin kit for soil (Q-BIO
gene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. PCR
amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments was performed
using U515f (5'-CTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3', nucleotide position 515 to 533 in the Escherichia coli
sequence) as a forward primer and U1492r (5'-GGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3', nucleotide position 1492 to 1510)
as a reverse primer. A PCR solution (50 µl) contained 1.25
U of Taq DNA polymerase (Amplitaq Gold, Applied Biosystems), 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of 200 µM, 50 pmol of each
primer and an appropriate amount of template DNA. The
amplification conditions were as follows: an initial step of
94°C for 10 min; 25 to 30 cycles consisting of 94°C for 1
min, 50°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min; a final elongation step at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR cycles were set at
minimum values at which sufficient quantities of products were obtained. Amplified fragments were purified
with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN), ligated
into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and cloned into
Escherichia coli competent cells as described previously
[19]. Vector harbouring clones were selected on Luria-Bertani plates supplemented with ampicillin (50 µg ml-1).
PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments were recovered
from colonies by PCR using primers T7W (5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3') and SP6W (5'-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATACTC-3') (the primers targeted the
pGEM-T vector sequences flanking the insertion) as
described previously [19]. Clones containing appropriate
sizes of the insertion were selected by the electrophoresis
analysis, and their nucleotide sequences were determined
as described previously [19]. A rarefaction analysis was
conducted using the Analytic Rarefaction program [37].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/6

for chimeric sequences were conducted using the chimera
check program in the Ribosomal Database Project database [40].
FISH
Probes Hypho1241 (targeting Hyphomicrobium and
related Rhizobiales bacteria [24]) and GNSB941 (targeting
Chloroflexi Subphylum I bacteria [22]) labelled with Cy5
were used. Hybridization conditions (see below) were
determined by theoretical analyses [41] and in vitro
hybridization experiments [42] using positive and control
16S rRNA sequences cloned in the present study; nucleotide sequences with more than two mismatches were not
hybridized with these probes under conditions described
below. Bacterial cells attaching onto anode fibers were
detached by vortexing in phosphate-buffered saline [19],
and it was checked by microscopic observation. Cells were
fixed in a 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde solution for 4 h
at 4°C. The cells were attached to APS-coated glass slides
(Matsunami) and dehydrated by sequential washes in 50,
75, and 98% (vol/vol) ethanol (2 min each). Subsequently, 20 µl of hybridization solution (0.9 M NaCl, 20
mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.2], 0.01% [wt/vol] sodium dodecyl
sulfate, 10% [wt/vol] formamide) containing 100 ng of a
probe was added to each hybridization well and was incubated at 45°C for overnight under a humid condition.
Slides were washed twice in the hybridization solution at
48°C for 5 min before cells were stained with Nano
orange (Molecular probes). Nano orange (a protein-binding fluorescent dye) was used for staining total microbial
cells. The Cells were overlaid with an anti-fading reagent
(VectaShield, Vector) and observed under a fluorescence
microscope (BX60, Olympus) equipped with a CCD camera (PXL1400, Photometrics). Images were analyzed using
the Photoshop software (Adobe), and numbers of probelabeled cells and those of Nano orange-stained cells were
counted on a computer screen. More than 100 Nano
orange-stained cells in five sights were counted to obtain
a ratio.
