Abstract
Background: The human Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) domain and its mouse orthologue include a cluster of
paternally expressed genes which imprinted expression is co-ordinately regulated by an imprinting center (IC)
closely associated to the Snurf-Snrpn gene. Besides their co-regulated imprinted expression, two observations
suggest that the spatio-temporal expression of these genes could also be co-regulated. First, the PWS genes have
all been reported to be expressed in the mouse nervous system. Second, Snurf-Snrpn and its associated IC are the
most ancient elements of the domain which later acquired additional functional genes by retrotransposition.
Although located at least 1.5 megabases from the IC, these retroposons acquired the same imprinted regulation
as Snurf-Snrpn. In this study, we ask whether the IC, in addition to its function in imprinting, could also be involved
in the spatio-temporal regulation of genes in the PWS domain.
Results: We compared the expression pattern of Snurf-Snrpn and C/D-box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)
MBII-85 and MBII-52 to the expression pattern of the two evolutionary related retroposons Ndn and Magel2, in
the developing mouse embryo. We show that these genes have highly similar expression patterns in the central
nervous system, suggesting that they share a common central nervous system-specific regulatory element. Among
these genes, Ndn and Magel2 display the most similar expression patterns. Using transgenic mice containing the
Ndn and Magel2 genes, we show that the transgenic Ndn gene whereas not imprinted is correctly expressed.
Search for DNase I hypersensitive sites in the Ndn-Magel2 genomic region and comparative genomic analyses
were performed in order to identify potential transcriptional cis-regulatory elements.
Conclusions: These results strongly suggest that paternally expressed genes of the PWS domain share a
common central nervous system-specific regulatory element. We proposed that this regulatory element could
co-localize with the IC. However, we demonstrate that the IC, if required for imprinted regulation, is not involved
in the spatio-temporal regulation of distantly located retrotransposed genes such as the Ndn gene in the PWS
domain.

Background
Genomic imprinting in mammals is a process that leads to
the preferential mono-allelic expression of specific genes
in diploid cells, depending on whether they are inherited
from the sperm or from the oocyte. To date, approximately 70 mammalian imprinted genes have been identified which map to at least 11 regions of the mouse
genome [1]. Most imprinted genes are therefore located in
clusters, which are generally conserved between human
and mouse. For some of these clusters, coordinate
imprinted gene regulation has been shown to be controlled by imprinting centers (IC) [2]. Imprinted genomic
regions from the two parents are differentially marked by
heritable epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation and histone acetylation and/or methylation. These
epigenetic modifications or imprints are established at
least for some of them in the germ line of either parent [2].
The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) domain on human
chromosome 15q11-q13 and its ortholog on mouse chromosome 7C-D1 are large chromosomal domains containing paternally expressed genes [3]. PWS results from the
loss of expression of several of them including SNURFSNRPN, NDN, MAGEL2, MKRN3 and the C/D-box small
nucleolar RNAs(snoRNAs). In humans, mini-deletions,
upstream the SNURF-SNRPN transcriptional unit, have
led to the characterization of an IC which coordinates
their imprinted expression [4]. One sub-region of this IC
defined as the shortest region of deletion overlap in PWS
patients (PWS-SRO) and encompassing the SNURFSNRPN promoter, has been shown to be required for
maintaining the paternal imprint [5,6]. Its deletion in the
germ line or post-zygotically on the paternal chromosome
leads to silencing of all paternally expressed genes of the
PWS domain [4,6]. In mice, although the Snrpn promoter
is not required for genomic imprinting [7], deletion of a
35 kb region including 16 kb of sequences upstream
Snurf-Snrpn exon 1 to Snurf-Snrpn exon 7 unit also leads to
silencing of the paternally expressed genes, indicating that
both the position of the IC and its role in the coordinate
imprinted expression of genes is conserved between
human and mouse [8,9].
Recently, examination of tissue-specific pattern of mRNA
expression at a genomic scale allowed the identification of
several chromosomal regions harbouring tissue-specific
co-regulated genes defined as regions of correlated transcription (RCTs) [10]. Noticeable, some of these RCTs
overlap with known imprinted loci and it suggests that
transcriptional regulatory elements controlling imprinted
expression might also regulate tissue-specific expression.
Therefore, one might hypothesize that this type of regulation is applied at the PWS domain. Two arguments support this hypothesis. First, all the murine orthologues of
the PWS genes have been reported to be expressed in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/1

developing nervous system [11]. Second, Nicholls proposed an evolutionary model for the origin of the human
and mouse PWS domains [12,13]. In this model, the
Snurf-Snrpn locus and its associated IC would be the
ancestral imprinted transcriptional unit of the domain.
The other genes, which are intronless, would have later
and sequentially been acquired by retrotransposition and
adopted the same imprinted regulation. Altogether, these
data suggest that a spatio-temporal co-regulation of PWS
genes could exist and have been acquired through the evolution of the domain. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that
the cis-regulatory element(s) initially involved in the spatio-temporal regulation of the Snurf-Snrpn locus might
influence the spatio-temporal regulation of retrotransposed genes in the PWS region. The IC could be a good
candidate to play this role.
In this study, we investigate this hypothesis. First, we compared the expression pattern of the Snurf-Snrpn, MBII-85,
MBII-52, Ndn and Magel2 in the developing mouse
embryo. We show that their expression in the embryo is
restricted to neural tissues and that these genes display
strikingly similar expression patterns in the central nervous system. Second, we created transgenic mice with a
BAC containing the Ndn and Magel2 genes. We showed
that the Ndn transgene is not imprinted but is correctly
expressed in the developing embryo. These results demonstrate that if the IC is required for imprinted regulation,
it is not involved in the Ndn spatio-temporal regulation.
Finally, since we have shown an almost identical spatiotemporal expression profile of Ndn and Magel2 in the
developing embryo, it suggests that these two genes might
share common cis-acting regulatory elements which
should be present in the BAC transgene. We therefore
searched for DNaseI hypersensitive sites in the NdnMagel2 genomic region and performed comparative
genomic analyses in order to identify potential transcriptional cis-regulatory elements.

Results
Nervous system tissue-specific expression of mouse PWS
genes in the embryo
In order to determine if mouse PWS genes might be transcriptionally co-regulated, we compared the expression
profiles of Snurf-Snrpn, MBII-85, MBII-52, Ndn and
Magel2 by in situ hybridization in the developing mouse
embryo (Fig. 1, 2 and 3). In the 10.5 and 13.5 mouse
embryos, Snurf/Snrpn, MBII-85, MBII-52, Ndn and Magel2
are almost exclusively expressed in the developing nervous system, and although expressed at different levels,
they display strikingly similar expression patterns in the
central nervous system (brain and spinal chord). As previously reported for Ndn [14], they are predominantly
expressed in all the ventral parts of the neural tube, mostly
or even exclusively in marginal areas where differentiating

neurons reside. In the peripheral nervous system, Ndn and
Snurf/Snrpn are both expressed at high levels in cranial
and dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic and parasympathetic
ganglia, structures in which MBII-85, MBII-52 and Magel2
trancripts are expressed at much lower levels or not at all
(Fig. 2 and 3). Magel2 when compared to Ndn, SnurfSnrpn and MBII-85/ -52 seems to have a more highly
restricted expression domain. In the 12.5 embryo, Magel2
transcripts are detected at high levels and predominantly
in the hypothalamus (Fig. 3). Careful examination shows
that although found at low or very low levels, Magel2 transcripts are present in similar domains as the four other
PWS genes studied. Ndn and Magel2 also share expression
domains in some non-neuronal tissues such as in the
muscles (skeletal muscles and tongue) and in some nonneuronal neural crest cells derived structures such as the
branchial arches (Fig. 3; data not shown). Magel2 transcripts are detected at very low levels in the dorsal root
ganglia and not detected in cranial ganglia.
In conclusion, all the PWS genes that we studied were
expressed mainly (Ndn and Magel2) or even exclusively
(Snurf-Snrpn, MBII-85/-52) in the mouse developing nervous system at E12.5 and E13.5, with strikingly similar
identical patterns in the central nervous system (brain and
spinal chord). More divergent expression patterns were
observed in the peripheral nervous system (cranial and
dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic ganglia), some genes
being expressed at high levels (Ndn and Snurf-Snrpn) and
the others being expressed at low levels or not at all (MBII85, MBII-52 and Magel2). Our in situ hybridization data

suggests the presence in the PWS domain of a central nervous system-specific neural element which coordinates the
PWS genes expression.
Transgenic experiments
In order to determine if the spatio-temporal transcriptional regulation of PWS genes is dependant upon the IC,
we initiated BAC transgenic analyses and chose to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the Ndn gene outside
its natural genomic context. Since Ndn and Magel2 are coregulated and the intergenic region between these two
genes is around 30 kb only, we chose a bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC 109) containing both genes to generate transgenic mice (Fig. 4A). Three transgenic male
founders were obtained and crossed with C57BL/6
females. Only one male transmitted the BAC109 transgene to its progeny and gave rise to the transgenic line 92
(Tg92) described in this study. The presence of BAC vector
sequences allowed us to discriminate the transgenic from
the wild type DNA. Genomic DNA from Tg92 mice was
thoroughly analyzed by PFGE, Southern blot and PCR, to
precisely determine the structure and the number of copy
of the integrated transgene (Fig. 4A, data not shown). The
transgene integrated in one full copy along with a truncated copy containing the whole 5' region upstream Ndn
up to the Ndn promoter (Fig. 4A), near the centromeric
region of chromosome 2, as determined by DNA FISH
analysis (data not shown).

Transgenic Ndn expression analysis was performed by
Northern blot hybridization, on adult tissues of mice

inheriting the transgene either maternally or paternally,
on an Ndn null background (Tg92mat-Ndn+/-pat and
Tg92pat-Ndn+/-pat, respectively). Whether maternally or
paternally inherited, the transgenic Ndn gene was
expressed with the same tissue specificity as the endogenous Ndn gene (Fig. 4B). Transgenic Ndn transcripts were
only detected in the brain, although at a slightly lower
level than endogenous transcripts. It should be noted that
no transgenic Ndn gene expression was detected in muscle, a tissue in which endogenous Ndn transcripts are
detected although at low levels as compared to the brain.
In situ hybridization experiments were then performed on
transgenic embryos carrying a paternal deletion of the

Ndn allele (Tg92mat-Ndn+/-pat) and wild type mouse
embryos, to compare the transgenic and endogenous profile of Ndn expression. Transgenic Ndn transcripts were
detected in embryos from E10.5 as endogenous Ndn transcripts, and in the same structures, namely the central and
peripheral nervous system (Fig. 5), at a slightly lower level
in transgenic embryos as it was noted in transgenic adult
tissues. No transgenic Ndn expression was detected in the
dermo-myotome, the muscles or the tongue, although
endogenous Ndn transcripts were detectable in these tissues (Fig. 5: H and I). Since Magel2 null mice were not
available, Magel2 imprinting and expression from the
BAC109 transgene could not be analyzed. However, no

E10.5 (A, B, C, D) and E12.5 (E, F) mouse embryos on adjacent sagittal sections, and in E12.5 (G, H) mouse embryos on
adjacent transversal sections. In the E10.5 embryo, the predominant expression in the ventral parts of the neural tube is
particularly evident (A, B, C, D) for both genes. Magel2 and
Ndn display a strikingly similar profile of expression in the
infundibulum recess (C, D). Asterics indicate expression of
both genes in symetrical ventral stripes of cells in the neural

mandibular component of the first branchial arch (C, D), in
the tongue (E, F). In the E12.5 embryo, Magel2 and Ndn are
expressed in identical structures such as the ganglionic eminence, the pons, the medulla oblongata, in the preplate of the

presence of the 54 and 50 kb Eag1 transgenic fragments
detected by the 5' and the 3' probes respectively demonstrate the integrity of the transgene. Eag1 is a methylation
sensitive enzyme which explains the presence of a higher
hybridization band corresponding to undigested methylated
DNA (Und). Hybridization of PmeI digested genomic DNA

Ndn transgenic mRNAs are not detected in adult muscles
whereas Ndn endogenous mRNAs are. After being hybridized to an intragenic Ndn probe, Northern blots were

we first undertook an experimental approach. We analyzed the chromatin DNase I sensitivity of the genomic
sequences present in the BAC transgene. In the adult
brain, hybridization of BglII- or BamHI-cut DNA with a
series of probes described in Fig. 1 led to the characterization of several major DNaseI hypersensitive sites associated to the Ndn gene (HS1/2, HS3 and 4) and of one site
upstream the Magel2 gene (HS5) (Fig. 6). The probes used
allowed a systematic analysis of the Ndn/Magel2 genomic
sequences present in the BAC transgene, from -17.5 kb
upstream the Ndn gene to17 kb downstream the Magel2
gene. Additional upstream Ndn sequences which were
present in the BAC could not be analyzed since their
sequences are not yet available.

ectopic site of Magel2 expression was noted during
embryogenesis.
Since the transgenic Ndn gene was not imprinted, methylation studies of the transgenic Ndn promoter region and
CpG island were omitted.
Search for Ndn transcriptional regulatory elements
Since Ndn was correctly expressed at least in the nervous
system from the BAC transgene, Ndn regulatory elements
must be present in the BAC109 genomic sequences. With
the increasing availability of genomic sequence and the
recent development of powerful global alignment algorithms, interspecies genomic sequence comparisons are
becoming an efficient mean to identify conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) which regulatory potential can
further be assessed experimentally [15,16]. However,
since the whole human and mouse PWS domains are
rather highly conserved which might render difficult to
discriminate between functional and non functional CNS,

Hybridization of BglII-cut DNA with probe 1 revealed two
adjacent (~50–70 bp apart) and strong DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS1 and HS2) in the Ndn promoter region of
the paternal allele (Fig. 6B). Hybridization with probe 2
revealed two additional but weaker DNase I hypersensitivity sites on the paternal allele (HS3 and HS4), localized in
the Ndn 5'UTR and at the beginning of the coding region,
respectively. In contrast to the paternal allele, the maternal allele was highly resistant to DNase I digestion. In the
adult kidney, a tissue in which Ndn is not expressed, the
two parental alleles were highly and almost equally resistant to DNase I digestion (data not shown). The presence
of DNase I hypersensitive sites HS1/2, HS3 and HS4 is
therefore closely linked to the transcriptional activity of
the Ndn gene since they were present on the paternal allele
and only in Ndn-expressing tissues.
Hybridization of brain BamH1-cut DNA with probe 6 or
BglII-cut DNA with probes 7 and 8 revealed one relatively
strong DNase I hypersensitive site (HS5) 3.5 kb upstream
the Magel2 gene, which was present on both parental alleles and co-localized with a polymorphic BglII site present
on the CAST/Ei allele. HS5 was localized 1 kb upstream
newly isolated full length Magel2 ESTs (AK086725,
AK082944, AK086725; see Fig. 6A) which initiate around
2.5 kb 5' to the described Magel2 mRNA (NM013779)
[17]. HS5 was present on both maternal and paternal alleles and in tissues in which Magel2 and/or Ndn are not
expressed such as the adult kidney (data not shown)
which suggests that this DNase I hypersensitive site is not
linked to the transcriptional activity of these two genes.
No prominent DNase I hypersensitive site were detected
in the Ndn-Magel2 intergenic region (excepted HS5). Multiple faint hybridization signals could however be
detected with probes 3 and 4 on BglII-cut DNA (data not
shown) and with probe 5 on BamH1-cut DNA, revealing
regions of low DNase I hypersensitivity in the Ndn-Magel2
intergenic region (Fig. 6B). Finally, hybridization of probe
10 on brain BamH1-cut DNA allowed the detection of a

were not able to precisely localise the HS6 site(s) as well
as its (their) parental origin.
We next mapped HS1 to 6 DNase I hypersensitive sites on
a mouse/human sequence alignment (Fig. 6-C). The available mouse sequences used for this comparison start from
-17.5 kb upstream the Ndn gene to the Magel2 extremity
of BAC109. Several CNS defined as orthologous
sequences greater than 100 bp and greater than 70%

regions: upstream the Ndn gene (region A), in the intergenic Ndn-Magel2 region (region B) and in a 2.8 kb
upstream the Magel2 gene (region C). None of the hypersensitive sites identified in this study mapped to region A,
B or C. HS1/2 which are closely linked to the transcriptional activity of the Ndn gene are localized in a CNS
immediately upstream the Ndn gene. HS5 co-localized to
an isolated CNS localized 0.7 kb upstream the highly conserved C region and around 1 kb upstream the newly
described full length Magel2 ESTs. However, the functional significance of HS5 in the Magel2 and/or Ndn gene
transcriptional regulation remains to be determined since
this site was neither allele nor tissue-specific. It should be
noted that there was almost no conservation of sequence
in the region downstream the Magel2 gene. In contrast,
the intergenic Ndn-Magel2 region was relatively well conserved and regions of low DNase I hypersensitivity were
detected in this region which might have functional
importance.

Discussion
Coordinated central nervous system-specific expression of
PWS genes
Study and comparison of Snurf-Snrpn, MBII-85/-52 snoRNAs, Ndn and Magel2 expression profiles brought new
information on the transcriptional regulation of these
genes. Snurf-Snrpn, the snoRNAs MBII-52 and MBII-85
and the distantly located Ndn and Magel2 genes were
expressed in the mouse developing nervous system at
E10.5 and E13.5 with strikingly similar patterns in the
central nervous system.

More divergent expression patterns were observed in the
peripheral nervous system and non-neuronal tissues.
Accordingly, Snurf-Snrpn, MBII-85 and MBII-52 snoRNAs
were exclusively expressed in the developing nervous system, and in identical structures in the central nervous system. Marked differences of expression between SnurfSnrpn and the snoRNAs were found in cranial and dorsal
root ganglia, structures in which Snurf-Snrpn was highly
expressed whereas the snoRNAs were expressed at very
low levels (MBII-85) or not at all (MBII-52). These results

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/1

reinforce the proposal that the snoRNAS derive from the
processing of long primary transcripts initiated at the U
exons, upstream Snurf-Snrpn [18] (Le Meur et al., submitted). It is interesting to note that Snurf-Snrpn was previously reported to be ubiquitously expressed in adult
tissues [12], whereas we found it to be exclusively
expressed in the nervous system at E10.5 and 13.5 of
mouse embryogenesis.
As previously reported [14,11], Ndn and Magel2 mRNAs
were detected almost exclusively in the nervous system of
the mouse embryo from E9.5/10.5 onwards, and
although Magel2 transcripts were detected at much lower
levels than Ndn transcripts, these two genes displayed
almost identical expression patterns in the central nervous
system (brain and spinal chord). Particularly striking was
their identical pattern of expression in the E10.5 embryo.
At later developmental stages, Magel2 expression domain
became more restricted but remained included in Ndn
expression domain. Magel2 transcripts were however
detected at very low levels in almost all the structures in
which Ndn was expressed, including non neuronal structures such as the mandibular component of the first
branchial arch, the tongue and the muscles. Magel2 transcripts have been reported to be particularly instable due
to the presence of AU-rich elements (ARE) in their 3'
untranslated region [17] and this could explain why they
were detected at such low levels.
Our expression analysis in the mouse embryo indeed suggests the existence of a central nervous system-specific
neural regulatory element coordinating the PWS genes
expression. Ndn and Magel2, specifically, could share
additional regulatory elements.
Co-expression of PWS genes and the IC
We further emitted the hypothesis that the central nervous
system-specific regulatory element could be physically
associated to the PWS IC because of the proposed evolutionary history of the PWS domain and because the IC is
involved in coordinating long range chromatin
modifications leading to imprinted expression of genes in
the whole domain. The Snurf-Snrpn locus with its associated IC has been proposed to be the most ancestral transcriptional unit of the domain [12,13]. Other PWS genes
(Ndn, Magel2, Mkrn3 and Frat3) would have later been
acquired by retroposition and/or local cis-duplication of
retroposed genes and would have adopted the same transcriptional regulation as the Snurf-Snrpn transcriptional
unit. Unless retroposons arise from reverse-transcriptasemediated processing of aberrant or alternative transcripts
including endogenous promoter elements, their functionality is dependent upon regulatory elements present at
their site of insertion. Retroposons in the PWS region
could have therefore adopted the Snurf-Snrpn regulation

both for imprinted and spatio-temporal expression.
Finally, the fact that paternal deletions of the IC abolish
the expression of all the PWS genes [8,7] also suggests a
possible intertwining between regulatory elements controlling both imprinting and spatio-temporal expression.
Our study did not however confirm that the IC might
coordinate the spatio-temporal expression of PWS genes.
Our transgenic analysis clearly showed that Ndn does not
rely on the IC for its spatio-temporal expression. Ndn was
correctly regulated from the BAC transgene lacking the IC
both in the developing embryo and in adult tissues. These
results demonstrate that the cis-regulatory sequences
involved in both the developmental and tissue-specific
expression of Ndn were present in the transgene and were
not associated to the IC. The fact that the IC was not
involved in the spatio-temporal regulation of the Ndn
gene does not however exclude its putative involvement
in the spatio-temporal regulation of the Snurf-Snrpn transcriptional unit. No transcriptional regulatory elements or
sequences excepted those involved in the imprinted
expression [19] have yet been characterized in the SnurfSnrpn transcriptional unit.
Search for Ndn and Magel2 regulatory elements
Since the cis-regulatory sequences involved in both the
developmental and tissue-specific expression of Ndn were
present in the transgene and since we showed that Ndn
and Magel2 expression was coordinated both in the central nervous system and in some non neuronal tissues of
the mouse embryo, we searched for Ndn and Magel2 regulatory elements in the BAC109 genomic sequences. Ndn
and Magel2 are two evolutionary related retrotransposons,
which belong to the MAGE D gene family [20]. Phylogenetic studies could not predict whether these two genes
arose from two distinct retroposition events or whether
they arose from the initial retroposition of one of these
two genes followed by a cis-duplication event (Blanc M.,
unpublished observations). Their close genomic localisation, within 30 kb in the mouse genome, would however
be in favour of this second hypothesis. The co-expression
of Ndn and Magel2 could therefore result from regulatory
elements sharing and/or duplication. Intraspecies
genomic comparisons of mouse or human Ndn and
Magel2 upstream sequences did not reveal any significant
homology which does not exclude the possibility that one
of these two genes arose by a cis- duplication. Our experimental search for regulatory elements elements in the
Ndn/Magel2 genomic sequences was limited to sequences
available in the databases and was therefore not exhaustive. However, we found several DNase I hypersensitive
sites (HS1/2, HS3 and 4) linked to Ndn transcriptional
activity and associated to the Ndn promoter. Previous
transgenic studies in the zebrafish using a series of hybrid
transgenes containing various mouse Ndn promoter

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/1

sequences associated to the reporter LacZ gene suggested
that the mouse Ndn promoter from -845 bp to +63 bp
functioned in the zebrafish embryo in a temporal, spatial
and tissue-specific manner [21]. In particular, a cis-acting
element driving the neuronal-specific expression was
located into an 87 bp sequence from -173 to -87 bp of the
Ndn gene which exactly co-localizes with HS1/2. No identified transcriptional factor brain-specific binding site
could however be identified in this sequence. Deletion of
promoter sequences in Ndn-KO mutant mice [22] did not
affect Magel2 transcriptional regulation (Watrin F., data
not shown) which suggests that if the coordinated Magel2
and Ndn expression results from the sharing of a putative
enhancer, this enhancer is not associated to Ndn promoter
sequences.
The human NDN gene has been shown to be expressed in
a larger panel of tissues than the mouse Ndn gene [23,24]
but our data suggest that these two genes might have
similar expression profiles in the nervous system [23]
(data not shown). An interspecific (mouse/human) comparison of available genomic sequences was therefore performed in order to identify genomic sequences involved
in central nervous system expression. This comparison did
not allow the identification of such sequences but nevertheless brought some new information on the Magel2
transcriptional unit, showing the existence of a 2.5 kb
highly conserved region upstream the described Magel2
gene. Identification of full length embryonic and brain
specific Magel2 ESTs including this region further confirms that this region belong to the Magel2 transcriptional
unit.
In view of our results, expression of the Ndn and Magel2
genes could be coordinated by a common enhancer distinct from Ndn promoter sequences and which could be
localized in sequences upstream the Ndn gene that we
could not analyze. It should be noted that the Ndn/Magel2
intergenic region was rather well conserved and harbored
several regions of low DNase I hypersensitivity which
might deserve further investigation.
The transgene is not imprinted
As expected, our transgene which was physically separated
from the IC was not imprinted. When outside of its natural genomic context, Ndn was expressed from either
parental allele. Whether particular genomic sequences
around or associated to Ndn such as the 5' CpG island are
necessary to respond to the primary imprinting signal
established at the IC remains to be determined. An
imprinted brain-specific Ndn non coding (nc) antisense
RNA (PX00010K13; DDBJ accession no. AK14392) initiated in (or including) the 5' part of Ndn coding sequence
and extending in Ndn upstream sequences has recently
been described and according to the authors, this anti-

BMC Genetics 2005, 6:1

sense transcript could be involved in the imprinted
expression of Ndn mRNA [25]. This transcript could
potentially be transcribed from our transgene. We did not
detect this antisense nc transcript in transgenic brain RNA
which is coherent with the fact that the transgene was not
imprinted. However, we did not detect it in wild type
brain either (data not shown). In one of the mouse models in which part of the Ndn CDS -and therefore the region
in which the antisense transcript is initiated- was deleted
[26], the LacZ gene which replaced the Ndn was monoallelically expressed, further strengthening an absence of
role of this hypothetical antisense transcript in Ndn
imprinting.

Conclusions
Our analysis strongly suggests the existence of a central
nervous system-specific regulatory element which would
coordinate expression of the PWS genes in the developing
mouse embryo and we proposed that this element could
be associated to the IC. However, our transgenic studies
clearly demonstrate that when physically separated from
the IC, a transgenic Ndn gene, although not imprinted
anymore, can still be correctly expressed in the developing
nervous system of the mouse embryo. The BAC transgene
therefore contained the regulatory elements needed for
the spatio-temporal expression of Ndn (and most likely
Magel2) in the developing nervous system. Three hypotheses can be made: 1) the PWS genes co-expression that we
observed is incidental, 2) the element(s) localised in
genomic sequences surrounding the Ndn/Magel2 and
which regulate(s) Ndn (and Magel2) expression could also
regulate other PWS genes, 3) several central nervous system-specific regulatory elements resulting from duplication events might be present in the PWS domain. The
evolutionary history of the PWS domain is more in favour
of the third hypothesis but will need further investigations
to be confirmed.

Methods
Mice
Adult C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 X CBA mice were purchased
from IFFA CREDO, and M. musculus castaneus (CAST/Ei)
male mice from the Jackson Laboratory. Mice carrying an
Ndn null mutation on a 129/Sv genetic background [22]
and transgenic Tg92 mice were bred in-house.
In situ hybridization
All in situ hybridization experiments for the study of PWS
genes expression were performed on C57BL/6 embryos. In
situ hybridization was performed on 14 µM paraformaldehyde-fixed cryosections with antisens digoxigenin-labeled
riboprobes. Sections were washed in 1X PBS, treated with
RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 8), postfixed in paraformaldehyde, acetylated and further washed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/1

in PBST before the hybridization step. All hybridization
and post-hybridization washes were performed at 70°C.
Hybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 5X SSC,
5X Denhart's solution (Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml herring sperm
DNA, 0.25 mg/ml yeast RNA. Washes were performed in
50% formamide, 2X SSC, 0.1% Tween 20. Digoxigenin
labelling was detected using anti-digoxigenin Fabs (Roche
Biochemicals) coupled to alkaline phosphatase and NBT/
BCIP (Sigma). The Ndn riboprobe (290 bp) hybridizes to
the 3' UTR of the Ndn mRNA (nt 2130 to 2420; accession
number D76440). The Magel2 riboprobe (318 bp)
hybridizes to the 3' part of the Magel2 ORF (nt 3730 to
4048; accession number AK086725). The snoRNAs MBII85 and MBII-52 riboprobes were synthesized from plasmids given by J. Cavaillé. The Snurf riboprobe (277 bp)
hybridizes to U/Snurf-Snrpn transcripts and recognizes
sequences from the 3' end of the Snurf exon 1 to the 3' end
of the Snurf exon 3 (nt 3639 to nt 77687; accession
number AF332579).
Generation and breeding of transgenic mice
BAC109 was isolated by hybridization of mouse bacterial
artificial (BAC) high-density membranes (Research
Genetics, Inc, USA) with a genomic Ndn probe, and contains a 103 kb NotI insert comprising the Ndn and Magel2
genes. The Ndn gene is localized in the center of BAC109,
the EagI intragenic site being situated 54 and 50 kb away
from the vector NotI sites and the 3' extremity of the
Magel2 gene is localized 17 kb from one of the vector NotI
site (Fig. 3). Unlinearized cesium chloride gradient purified BAC109 DNA was resuspended in injection buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 100 mM
NaCl, 30 µM spermine, 70 µM spermidine) at 3 ng/µl and
microinjected in the pronucleus of C57BL/6 X CBA fertilized eggs. Founders were identified by Southern blot
analysis using a PCR probe amplified from the
pBeLoBAC11 vector and a BglII digestion, and subsequently bred on a C57BL/6 genetic background. Transgene copy number and integrity were determined by PFGE
and Southern blot analysis. The 5' and 3' probes used in
the Southern blot analysis correspond to the probes 1 and
2 described in the "DNase I Hypersensitivity Mapping"
section. Transgenic Ndn expression analysis (Northern
blot and in situ hybridization) was performed on embryos
or adult mice inheriting the transgene either paternally or
maternally, on a Ndn null background. These embryos or
adult mice were obtained by mating transgenic males carrying the Ndn null mutation to wild type C57BL/6 females
(Tg92pat-Ndn+/-pat) or transgenic females to males carrying the Ndn null mutation (TgBAC92mat-Ndn+/-pat).
DNase I hypersensitivity mapping
Tissues were dissected either from inter-specific F1
hybrids between M. musculus C57BL/6 females and M.
musculus castaneus males (B6 x CAST/Ei) F1 or from inbred

C56BL/6 mice (B6). Nuclei were isolated from adult
mouse tissues as described [27]. Nuclei were resuspended
in DNase I digestion buffer (0.3 M sucrose, 60 mM KCl,
15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 15 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.4 mM CaCl2,
5% glycerol) at a concentration of 5.107 nuclei/ml.
Increasing amounts of DNase I (bovine pancreas grade I;
Boehringer Mannheim) from 0 to 100 units diluted in 5
µl of DNase I digestion buffer were added to 95 µl aliquots of nuclei. After a 1 min incubation at 25°C, the digestion was stopped by addition 100 µl of stop solution (20
mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) and samples
were incubated overnight at 37°C. Genomic DNA was
purified by multiple phenol/chloroform extractions and
precipitated with ethanol. After resuspension, the DNA
was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes,
separeted by gel electrophoresis, and transferred to
Hybond N+ membranes. The membranes were hybridized by random hexamer- radiolabeled probes, in church
solution (0.5 M NaPi pH 5.5, 7% SDS), at 65°C. Filters
were washed three times in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C
and exposed to X-ray film at -70°C. When necessary, blots
were stripped by incubation in 0.1X SSC, O.1% SDS at
95°C. Most probes were prepared by PCR amplification
of BAC109 sequences, using the following primers: Probe
1: S-5'-AGATCTGAAGACATAATG-3', AS-5'-GCTCTCCATTTCTAT TAGGTC-3'; Probe 2:S-5'-ATAAGTATTTGGTACTTTCAC-3', AS-5'-TGCTAAGTGCCTACACTGAG3';
Probe 3: S-5'-GAGCGAAACTATTCTGACAG3', AS-5'AAGCTTCCTCCTCTATGGCAA-3'; Probe 4: S-5'-GATTTCTGCTAAGATTGG-3', AS-5'-ATGTTCCCTCTAGAAACC3'; Probe 6: S-5'-AGTTAGAGACAAGCCTAG-3', AS-5'TTCTGGGATGTCTCAGGA-3'; Probe 7: S-5'-GCATTTTGAGGAAGTACCCA-3', AS-5'-CATGGCCATTTCTAACTGTG-3'; Probe 8: S-5'-CCAAGGAGCTTGGAGGGC-3', AS5'-CTCGTAGAGTGCGGCCAA-3'; probe 9: S-5'-ACATCAATAGTTTGATAC-3', AS-5'-GGGTGTGGCTGTGCATTGTT-3'
