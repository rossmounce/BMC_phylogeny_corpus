Abstract
We introduce a hypothesis which presumes that damage to the vomeronasal organ during a Le Fort
I osteotomy of the maxilla for the purpose of orthognathic surgical treatment of congenital or
acquired jaw deformities affects the patient's social life in terms of the selection of mates and
establishment of relationships. The vomeronasal organ is chemosensory for pheromones, and thus
registers unconscious olfactory information which might subsequently act on the limbic system of
an individual and influence the selection of mates. We believe it is connected to an inhibitory
feedback mechanism which is responsible for the exclusion of inappropriate mates. When the
vomeronasal organ is removed or damaged during a maxillary osteotomy, the inhibitory function
is lost, the patient loses the involuntary ability to exclude inappropriate mates, may become less
committed to an existing mate, or even become promiscuous.

Background
Orthognathic surgery is a surgical discipline aimed at correcting congenital or acquired jaw deformities. It may be
indicated for functional and/or aesthetic reasons. Clinical
situations demanding such correction include the need
for reconstruction of biting and chewing functions [1], the
correction of sleep apnea syndrome [2-5], temporomandibular joint disorders [6], or cleft palate [7]. Orthognathic surgery is primarily based on osteotomy of the
facial bones and advancement or set back of the upper
and/or lower jaw bone. Maxillary osteotomy is performed
in fracture line Le Fort I, originally described by Rene Le
Fort [1,6].
Orthognathic surgery significantly affects the psychological aspects of a patient's personality in almost all cases. In
the majority of cases, it significantly increases the patient's
self-confidence [8]. Retrospective studies suggest a very

high level of satisfaction following orthognathic surgery
in comparison with other types of cosmetic surgery, such
as rhinoplasty or breast augmentation/reduction [9]. It
has been shown that patients significantly improved their
psychological-psychiatric profile, including psychoses,
neuroses, personality disorders, and social integration
[10]. Most importantly for our study, physical attractiveness has a considerable impact on the establishment of
new relationships, including dating [11].
In mammals, the vomeronasal organ (VNO), also known
as Jacobson's organ, is a chemosensory organ, the function of which is still not precisely known. In some phylogenetically older animals, such as mice or rats, the VNO is
most likely used in the detection of pheromones, i.e., a
chemical substance which carries a message about the
physiological or behavioral state of a living organism to
members of its own species, resulting in a specific reaction

[12,13]. Connections between the VNO and the amygdala
and limbic system have been described, both of which are
recognized as the seat of emotional, hormonal, and autonomic control [14]. For example, snakes use this organ to
sense prey, sticking their tongue out to gather scents and
touching it to the opening of the organ when the tongue
is retracted [15]. Elephants transfer chemosensory stimuli
to the vomeronasal opening in the roof of their mouths
using a prehensile structure, sometimes called a "finger,"
at the tip of their trunks. Some mammals, such as horses,
use a distinctive facial movement, referred to as the flehmen response, to direct inhaled compounds to this organ.
House cats often may be seen making a grimace when
examining a scent that interests them. In some other
mammals, the entire organ contracts or pumps in order to
draw in the scents [12].
The presence and role of the VNO in humans remains
controversial. Some reports state that it completely
regresses during fetal development, while others are
emphatic regarding its presence in humans [16,17]. Its
function is stated to be similar as in animals, i.e., the ability to register the presence of pheromones [18].
Presentation of the hypothesis
We hypothesize that the VNO might be unilaterally, or
more often bilaterally removed or irreversibly damaged,
during a Le Fort I osteotomy when maxillary advancement, impaction, or extrusion is performed, in order to
achieve a good esthetic and/or functional result during
orthognathic surgery. During a Le Fort I osteotomy, the
VNO, together with the supplying nerve, is excised in the
course of dissecting the nasal mucosa from the hard palate
osseous base.

As a result of this surgical intervention, the patient loses
the ability to recognize all scents of a pheromone nature,
which significantly changes sexual preferences and behaviour, including personal criteria for the choice of a mate.
Evaluation of the hypothesis
Why the VNO exists in adult humans
Although some authors dismiss the existence of a true
VNO, there are many observations demonstrating a specific organ in the nasal mucosa which is not of a respiratory or olfactory nature [16,17,19]; thus, there should be
no doubt that the VNO exists in humans. The VNO is
often described as a blind-ending diverticulum in the septal mucosa opening via a depression, called the VNO pit,
into the nasal cavity approximately 2 centimetres from the
nostril [17].

On the basis of phylogenetic development, it would be
surprising if all chemosensory communication has been
lost. The fact that chemical communication does not seem

http://www.head-face-med.com/content/5/1/5

to be a strong determinant of human behaviour is not a
very strong argument for dismissing vomeronasal function, as implied by Keverne [20] and Meredith [12]. The
truth will likely be somewhere in between, i.e., the VNO
is developed in adult humans, but has a significantly
reduced function during phylogenetic development due
to the more rapid development of other senses.
Why the VNO exhibits properties of a sensory organ
The VNO in humans does not have the classical appearance of a peripheral sensory ending, from which a bundle
of nerve fibres originates and terminates in the central
nervous system. It has been shown that adult human
vomeronasal epithelium has a limited number of bipolar
cells, positive for neuron-specific enolase, a specific
marker for cells of neural origin [17,21]. In addition, a significantly higher density of unmyelinated axons has been
observed in the mucosa below and near the human VNO,
in comparison with other nasal mucosa [22]. On the
other hand, axons observed in the mucosa do not reveal
the continuity or synaptic contact with the epithelial cells
of vomeronasal nature [23].

The innervation of the VNO in animals is quite complex
(for a review, see [13]). In the human fetus, as in other
species, the terminalis nerve, i.e., the zero cranial nerve,
connects the VNO and the brain, acting as a pathway for
migration of luteinizing hormone releasing hormoneproducing neurons from the region of the VNO epithelium into the brain [24-26]. In addition, the terminalis
nerve clearly persists in human adults [12,27]. Although it
has not been shown that the terminalis nerve carries the
axons of the VNO in adults, such speculation had often
been published [12,28,29].
Why the VNO responds to pheromones
There is electrophysiologic evidence of a response of the
VNO to urine [18]. Jacob and colleagues [30,31] have
reported changes in mood in humans elicited by chemicals extracted from human skin, including androstandione and estratetraenyl compounds. It has been reported
that a local electrophysiologic response to the application
of small amounts of the same substances, confined
directly to the vomeronasal region and termed the electrovomeronasogram response [32,33]. In addition,
responses from isolated cells and also a systemic response
to such an application have been reported. Importantly,
conventional odours did not elicit such response [32].

Several indirect reports of the presence of pheromone-like
substances, influencing human behaviour, have been
published (for a review, see [12]). One of the most notable examples is a trend towards synchronization of menstrual cycles in women who live together [34]. This
function might be phylogenetically-based, i.e., the Lee-

Boot effect, showing that group-housed female mice suppress estrus in order to conserve the energy normally put
into cycling when there is no possibility of pregnancy
[35]. Conversely, in the presence of male stimuli, i.e., pheromones, group-housed females return to estrus cycling,
the so-called Whitten effect [36]. We can speculate that
signalling pheromones might communicate information
that alters an individual's probability of responding without necessarily evoking an immediate observable
response in humans.
How the VNO influences human behaviour
Although the VNO has more functions, probably the most
important and most studied function of the VNO is its
influence on sexual behaviour. Experiments on animal
models have shown that the destruction or deafferentation of the VNO produces severe sexual behavioural deficits in both males and females (for a review, see [13]).
Based on a number of studies, the experiments of Bruce
[37] most closely support our hypothesis. In these experiments, fertilised eggs failed to implant if a strange male
was exchanged for the mating male in the cage of a female
within 4 days of copulation. This effect was later shown to
be dependent on the functional VNO [38]. These experiments also indicated the important role of memory in the
process of recognition of pheromones by the VNO.
Recently, there has been a report showing that male mice
deficient in Trpc2, an ion channel specifically expressed in
VNO neurons and essential for transduction in the VNO,
are impaired in sex-discrimination and male-male aggression, whereas females deficient in Trpc2 show a reduction
in female-specific behaviour, including maternal aggression and lactating behaviour. In addition, the same results
have been observed after the VNO is removed [39].
Why the VNO is lost during a Le Fort I osteotomy
Our hypothesis presumes the VNO is lost during maxillary movement. In the case of maxillary impaction, we
perform not only bony structure reduction, but also partial reduction of the inferior cartilagineous part of the
nasal septum to prevent unfavorable and non-esthetic
nose bending. During such a reduction, the VNO is electrocoagulated to control the bleeding from the nasopalatine artery, or even removed in toto. This statement is
indirectly supported by the findings of Trotier et al. [17],
who found a substantially lower number of VNOs in
patients who underwent septal surgery of a different
nature in comparison with healthy individuals.
Why the loss of the VNO influences behaviour
To our knowledge, no comprehensive scientific study has
analyzed the role of VNO loss during orthognathic surgery
on the post-operative establishment of new relationships
and mating behaviour of patients. However, several indirect reports have supported this statement. Jacobson [11]

http://www.head-face-med.com/content/5/1/5

observed a 65% increase in positive influence on personality and self-confidence in patients after orthognathic
surgery. In addition, 24% of patients stated an improvement in the establishment of relationships with the opposite sex [11]. Williams et al. [40] showed that of patients
who were not aware they had a problem in their social
life, 24% stated that their social life was significantly
improved after orthognathic surgery.
Importantly, social anxiety and depression rating indices
of patients scheduled for esthetic surgery in the facial
region, such as a blepharoplasty, face lift, or otoplasty,
were significantly higher then the same indices of patients
scheduled for orthognathic surgery. Thus, orthognathic
patients present a significantly lower grade of psychological vulnerability [41]. In addition, patients having orthognathic surgery seem to have fewer postoperative
complications than patients having other cosmetic procedures [42]. Pogrel and Scott [43] conclude that most
orthognathic surgery patients are psychologically normal,
so any routine psychological or psychiatric preoperative
examination is not necessary. These data indicate the
orthognathic patients are primarily not expected to
change their personal lives dramatically. However, our
experiences with more than 1000 patients who underwent
combined orthodonthic and orthognathic treatment in
our department indicate that the number of patients who
changed their social life in terms of a change in existing
mates or even became promiscuous is not as low as might
be expected (Foltán, unpublished).
Consequences of the hypothesis and discussion
Our hypothesis presumes there is an inhibitory role of the
VNO in terms of identification of inappropriate individuals for mating. This inappropriate individual excretes pheromones which are recognized as inappropriate by the
VNO and such information is transduced into limbic
brain structures and evokes an involuntary response in
terms of not "liking that person" or "feeling something
strange." We believe this is a phylogenetically old function for the exclusion of inappropriate mates for the conceiving of descendants and their additional care. The preand post-delivery care of the mother, which is important
for females, but also the need for the proper selection of a
mother capable of giving birth to healthy children, which
is important for males, were and are more important in
humans than in, for example, mice, because the time
needed for the pregnancy and also the lactation period are
quite long.

Kimchi et al. [39] recently showed that the murine VNOmediated pheromone inputs act in wild-type females to
repress male behaviour and activates female behaviour.
On the basis of these results, they concluded that functional neuronal circuits underlying male-specific behav-

iour exist in the normal female mouse brain [39]. Thus,
when applied to our hypothesis, when the inhibitory
mechanism, i.e., the VNO, is destroyed, the mechanism of
negative feedback is disrupted and the individual is free to
choose a partner for mating; however, he/she might prefer
more than one individual and therefore suddenly
becomes promiscuous.

On the basis of our hypothesis, a comprehensive study of
orthognathic patients with a focus on social life, together
with the number and gender of mates, analyzed before
and after surgery, might be developed. Importantly,
patients who underwent a Le Fort I osteotomy should be
evaluated separately from those who underwent a sagittal
split osteotomy of the mandible and/or a genioplasty
without maxillary advancement and/or set back.

Conclusion
Our hypothesis presumes that the loss of the VNO during
orthognathic surgery might influence the post-operative
social life of patients in terms of a loss of negative feedback, which is important for exclusion of inappropriate
mates.
