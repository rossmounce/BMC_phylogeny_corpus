Abstract
Background: Duplicated genes are common in vertebrate genomes. Their persistence is assumed
to be either a consequence of gain of novel function (neofunctionalisation) or partitioning of the
function of the ancestral molecule (sub-functionalisation). Surprisingly few studies have evaluated
the extent of such modifications despite the numerous duplicated receptor and ligand genes
identified in vertebrate genomes to date. In order to study the importance of function in the
maintenance of duplicated genes, sea bream (Sparus auratus) PAC1 receptors, sequence
homologues of the mammalian receptor specific for PACAP (Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating
Polypeptide), were studied. These receptors belong to family 2 GPCRs and most of their members
are duplicated in teleosts although the reason why both persist in the genome is unknown.
Results: Duplicate sea bream PACAP receptor genes (sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B), members of family
2 GPCRs, were isolated and share 77% amino acid sequence identity. RT-PCR with specific primers
for each gene revealed that they have a differential tissue distribution which overlaps with the
distribution of the single mammalian receptor. Furthermore, in common with mammals, the teleost
genes undergo alternative splicing and a PAC1Ahop1 isoform has been characterised. Duplicated
orthologous receptors have also been identified in other teleost genomes and their distribution
profile suggests that function may be species specific. Functional analysis of the paralogue sbPAC1s
in Cos7 cells revealed that they are strongly stimulated in the presence of mammalian PACAP27 and
PACAP38 and far less with VIP (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide). The sbPAC1 receptors are equally
stimulated (LOGEC50 values for maximal cAMP production) in the presence of PACAP27 (-8.74 ±
0.29 M and -9.15 ± 0.21 M, respectively for sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B, P > 0.05) and PACAP38 (-8.54
± 0.18 M and -8.92 ± 0.24 M, respectively for sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B, P > 0.05). Human VIP was
found to stimulate sbPAC1A (-7.23 ± 0.20 M) more strongly than sbPAC1B (-6.57 ± 0.14 M, P <
0.05) and human secretin (SCT), which has not so far been identified in fish genomes, caused
negligible stimulation of both receptors.
Conclusion: The existence of functionally divergent duplicate sbPAC1 receptors is in line with
previously proposed theories about the origin and maintenance of duplicated genes. Sea bream

PAC1 duplicate receptors resemble the typical mammalian PAC1, and PACAP peptides were found
to be more effective than VIP in stimulating cAMP production, although sbPAC1A was more
responsive for VIP than sbPAC1B. These results together with the highly divergent pattern of tissue
distribution suggest that a process involving neofunctionalisation occurred after receptor
duplication within the fish lineage and probably accounts for their persistence in the genome. The
characterisation of further duplicated receptors and their ligands should provide insights into the
evolution and function of novel protein-protein interactions associated with the vertebrate
radiation.

Background
Increased gene number and complexity are generally
assumed to have contributed to the success of vertebrates.
The evolutionary driving forces behind this are still under
debate however gene and/or genome duplications and
exon shuffling events are proposed to have been of fundamental importance [1-5]. The increased complexity of
metazoan genomes have been attributed to rounds of
gene or whole genome duplication [1,6-9]. Analysis of
metazoa genomes reveals that a remarkable percentage of
duplicated genes exist [10-13] and whilst some genes
decay to non-functionality and are subsequently eliminated from the genome, others are maintained either
through the acquisition of novel functions (neofunctionalisation) or by partitioning the function of the ancestral
molecule between the duplicated isoforms (subfunctionalisation).
The secretin family of G-protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs) (a.k.a. family 2 GPCRs) is a large hormone and
neuropeptide receptor gene family present in metazoan
genomes. Members of this family have been identified in
both protostomes and deuterostomes [14-16] and their
conserved sequence and gene organisation has led to the
proposal that they evolved from a common ancestral gene
as a consequence of total, or partial genome duplication
[14]. Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Pituitary
Adenylate Cyclase Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) receptors (VPAC and PAC1, respectively) are closely related
members of family 2 GPCRs. They are important pharmaceutical targets as their ligands, the brain-gut peptides VIP
and PACAP, control a number of important physiological
functions in mammals [17,18].
In humans three receptors exist, PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2
and binding studies reveal that VPACs are able to bind the
ligands, VIP and PACAP with similar affinities, while
PAC1 preferentially binds PACAP [18,19]. In vertebrates,
activation of PAC1/VPAC receptors occurs via three intracellular transduction mechanisms. These involve either
cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, IP turnover via PLC or/
and calcium mobilization as a consequence of the activation of a G-protein complex [18,20-22]. In mammals, five
PAC1 isoforms, which result from the insertion of one or

two, 28 (hip or hop1 variant) or 27 (hop2 variant) amino
acid cassettes in intracellular loop 3 (IL3) have been identified [23,24]. In addition, two VPAC1 and VPAC2 isoforms have been recently described which lack TM6 and
TM7 [25]. In other vertebrates PAC1 splice isoforms have
been isolated, however no alternative splice forms of
VPAC have yet been identified and in vertebrates these latter receptors do not activate the IP3 signalling pathway
[26-28].
Teleosts, which diverged from the tetrapod lineage
approximately 450 million years ago (MYA), represent
one of the most successful vertebrate groups with over
25,000 species. The existence of a variety of teleost
genome sizes and ploidy levels has made them very useful
for studies of gene evolution and function [29]. Recently
duplicated PAC1 and VPAC receptor genes have been
identified in teleosts using in silico approaches [16] and in
Takifugu they have a differential tissue distribution [15].
In the present study duplicate PAC1 cDNAs were isolated
from the marine teleost, sea bream (Sparus auratus) and
their tissue expression and functional profile characterised using the peptides VIP, PACAP27, PACAP38 and SCT
(secretin). The persistence of duplicate sbPAC1 receptors
in teleost genomes is discussed in relation to the current
proposed theories for gene evolution in vertebrates.

Results
Sea bream duplicate PAC1 receptors
Two complete putative sbPAC1 cDNAs, namely sbPK713
(2368 bp) and sbPP1C (2791 bp), were isolated from a
sea bream kidney and pituitary cDNA libraries, respectively (Figures 1 and 2). The isolated cDNAs encode putative proteins of 444 and 448 amino acids respectively, and
share an overall amino acid identity of 77% due to the
highly conserved TM domains and C-terminal regions; the
N-terminal domain is only 48% identical. The sbPK713
and sbPP1C cDNAs share 91% and 86% amino acid
sequence identity respectively, with the previously identified Takifugu PAC1A and PAC1B and for this reason were
designated sbPAC1A (AJ514930) and sbPAC1B
(AJ514931). Analysis of sea bream genomic DNA by RTPCR coupled with Southern blot (data not shown) confirmed that both sea bream PAC1 cDNAs are encoded by

single genes and are not the result of alternative splicing.
This observation is confirmed by mapping of sbPAC1A
and sbPAC1B genes in the recently released sea bream
gene-based radiation hybrid (RH) map, to group 6 (RH6)
and 2 (RH2), respectively [30].

(ENSORLP00000022250 and ENSORLP00000016315)
and zebrafish (NM_001013444 and XM_701685) (Table
1). In contrast, a single copy of a PAC1 gene was identified
in the Atlantic salmon (Salmon salar, CK885244) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, AY706216). It seems
likely that further PAC1 receptors exist in salmonids and it
is expected that these will be identified as sequence coverage of their genomes is enriched.

A microsatellite sequence is present in the 5'UTR region of
both receptors and sbPAC1A contains an imperfect (AC)32
dinucleotide repeat and sbPAC1B an imperfect (GA)28
repeat upstream of the initiation codon (Figures 1 and 2).
Genotyping of the microsatellites using genomic DNA
from sea bream caught at different geographic locations
and a family panel, revealed both microsatellites are polymorphic and the locus sbPAC1B scores more alleles (8
alleles) than sbPAC1A (4 alleles) (Additional file 1).
Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis
Sequence comparison of sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B with vertebrate homologue receptors revealed six conserved
cysteine residues and two putative N-glycosylation sites at
the N-terminal domain which are implicated in ligandbinding [20](Figure 3). Additional conserved motifs characteristic of PAC1 are also present. Within intracellular
loop three (IL3) the amino acid motifs, P-D-M and R-L-AR (Basic-L/A-L/A/V/S-Basic), important for functional
coupling with the Gsα protein, are conserved in the teleost and tetrapod receptors. Amino acid residues K322 and
E394, which are involved in activation of the cAMP pathway in humans [21] are also conserved suggesting that a
similar receptor signalling pathway may exists in sea
bream. A putative signal peptide sequence is also present
along with the consensus signature motif of TM7 in mammalian PACAP and VIP receptors: FQGBBVXXBYCFXNXEVXQ (where X is any amino acid and B is a basic amino
acid [15,31]. Duplicate PAC1 genes also exist in other teleosts
genomes,
such
as
stickleback
(ENSGACP00000022696 and ENSGACP00000007143),
Tetraodon
(GSTENP00011829001
and
GSTENP00034495001),

Phylogenetic analysis of sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B receptors
with the vertebrate PAC1, VPAC1, VPAC2, PRP, GHRH and
SCT receptors confirmed their identity as duplicated
members of the vertebrate PAC1 family (Figure 4, Additional file 2). The tree topology indicates that vertebrate
PAC1, VPAC (1 and 2), PRP and GHRH receptors evolved
from a common ancestral gene and that a teleost specific
duplication has occurred which is in line with the proposed partial or whole genome duplication event within
their lineage [9,12,15,16,32,33].
Linkage analysis
Gene environment comparisons of the PAC1 homologue
genomic regions revealed it is highly conserved across vertebrates (Figure 5). In human, PAC1 is localized on chromosome 7 and in chicken it maps to chromosome 2 and
is in close proximity with the chicken GHRH and VPAC1
receptors. In teleosts the duplicate genes map to different
genome regions and are localised in the Takifugu scaffolds
N000080 and N00239 and in zebrafish chromosomes 10
and 2. Three genes (RT-like protein, PDE1C and
NeuroD6-B genes) were found to be shared between the
Takifugu, chicken and human genomic regions analysed.
The PAC1 gene is linked with the PRPR gene in Takifugu
and chicken suggesting these genes arose by tandem
duplication, although it has been lost in the human. In
Xenopus, in which the genome assembly is incomplete,
PAC1 maps to the final region of scaffold_333 and
NeuroD6-B and PDE1C to scaffold_588 suggesting that

Phylogenetic analysis of the vertebrate PAC1 members
Phylogenetic analysis of the vertebrate PAC1 members. This figure represents the upper quartile of the consensus
tree, for full image and details please refer to Additional file 2. Sea bream PAC1 receptors are in bold and the novel teleost
PAC1 receptors identified are refereed by their Ensembl nomenclature. PAC1 accession numbers are: Human, P41586; Mouse,
P70205; Rana, Q90Y07; Takifugu1A, AJ494861, Takifugu1B, AJ490804; zebrafish1A, NM_001013444 and zebrafish1B,

these two regions are contiguous in the genome although
so far no homologue of PRPR was identified.
Tissue expression of sbPAC1 receptors
PAC1 tissue distribution was carried out in several sea
bream tissues by RT-PCR using specific primers for each
receptor (Figure 6). These primers were designed in order
to amplify all potential receptor transcripts. The sbPAC1A
was found to be expressed in the pituitary, kidney, duodenum and skin and weakly in heart and gonads whilst
sbPAC1B was restricted to brain and pituitary. A larger
sbPAC1A PCR product was also amplified which had an
overlapping tissue distribution with sbPAC1A with the
exception of heart and gonads. Sequence analysis indicates that the larger sbPAC1A PCR product corresponds to
the homologue of the mammalian PAC1hop1 isoform
and contains an insertion of 28 amino acids within IL3
region. No other PAC1A isoforms were amplified and no
alternative splice forms for sbPAC1B were detected.

Functional studies of duplicate sbPAC1
The sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B were successfully expressed in
Cos7 and Hek293 cell lines as confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Cos7 cell extracts
subject to Western blot contained a specific immunoreactive fusion protein of approximately 52 kDa in transfected
cells, which corresponds to the estimated molecular
weight in silico of the fusion proteins, (T7PAC1A is 52.75
kDa and T7PAC1B is 52.32 kDa). Cos7 and Hek293 cell
lines expressing the recombinant vector were activated by
Forskolin and gave maximal cAMP production. Negative
control experiments in which Cos7 and Hek293 cells were
transfected with pcDNA3 without insert and incubated
with the maximum concentration used of test peptide (106 M), revealed that Hek293 cells are responsive to PACAP
and VIP peptides. This suggests the existence of endogenous receptors in Hek293 which is confirmed by available proteome data [34]. For this reason only the results
obtained with transfected Cos7 cells are presented.

Figure 5 linkage analysis of the PAC1 receptors
Short-range linkage analysis of the PAC1 receptors. The gene environment of Takifugu, chicken and human PAC1
regions is represented. Homologue genes present in all three study organisms are represented by open boxes and black boxes
represent flanking genes that had no corresponding homologues. Genes are named according to the HUGO annotation and
PAC1 genes are in bold. Takifugu scaffolds (assembly 4) are represented using the NIX annotation [40]. The gene environment
of PAC1 in Xenopus is not represented since it was very incomplete. The Takifugu gene environment is represented and the
scale corresponds approximately to 10 Kb and the relative position of linked genes in the chromosomes of the chicken and
human is given.

The cAMP potency profile of Cos7 transfected cells
expressing the recombinant sbPAC1 receptors in the presence of different concentrations of VIP and PACAP
(PACAP38 and PACAP27) peptides is depicted in Figure 7.
All mammalian peptides were able to stimulate cAMP
production in a dose dependent manner. The peptide activation profile for the sbPAC1A gene was as follows
PACAP27 ≈ PACAP38 > VIP as assessed by the LOGEC50 values for cAMP production for each peptide (-8.74 ± 0.29 M,
-8.54 ± 0.18 M and -7.23 ± 0.20 M, respectively). The stimulation of cAMP production by VIP was significantly
lower (P < 0.05) than for PACAP peptides. The peptide
activation profile of sbPAC1B was also tested and found to
be similar to sbPAC1A and is as follows PACAP27 ≈
PACAP38 > VIP and the LOGEC50 values for maximal cAMP
production for each peptide are -9.15 ± 0.21 M, -8.92 ±
0.24 M and -6.57 ± 0.14 M, respectively. The stimulation
of cAMP by VIP was significantly lower than PACAP27 and
PACAP38 (P < 0.001). Human SCT causes a negligible

increase above the basal concentration of cAMP production in non-stimulated Cos7 cells transformed with either
sbPAC1A or sbPAC1B (data not shown). Comparison of
the potency profile of each peptide (PACAP27, PACAP38
and VIP) for the duplicate sea bream receptors revealed
that PACAP stimulates both receptors equally. In contrast,
VIP is significantly more potent for sbPAC1A (-7.23 ± 0.20
M) compared to sbPAC1B (-6.57 ± 0.14 M, P < 0.05).

Discussion
In the present study, duplicate sea bream PAC1 genes
(sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B) have been isolated and functionally characterised. Structural motif identification and
expression assays reveal they are functional family 2
GPCR members. The sbPAC1B is predominantly found in
brain and pituitary while sbPAC1A has a widespread distribution but is absent from brain. The overall tissue distribution of the sbPAC1 receptors is similar to the single
mammalian PAC1 receptor and suggests they may have

Figureexpression of the duplicate sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B receptors
Tissue 6
Tissue expression of the duplicate sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B receptors. Expression was carried out by RT-PCR using
specific primers to amplify potential receptor transcripts. PCR products of approximately 1200 bp, 1000 bp and 1280 bp were
obtained and corresponded to sbPAC1A, sbPAC1B and sbPAC1Ahop1 isoform, respectively.

similar functions in the endocrine, nervous, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems [17,18]. In common with
the mammalian PAC1 receptor both sbPAC1 receptors are
highly stimulated by PACAP but poorly by VIP and SCT.
The tissue distribution of PAC1 receptors in sea bream is
different from that in Takifugu in which PAC1B has a widespread tissue distribution and PAC1A distribution is
restricted to brain, gill and gonads [15]. Therefore, despite
the high sequence conservation between teleost PAC1A or
PAC1B genes (91% and 86%, respectively), the paralogue
genes seems to have evolved in a species specific manner
in relation to tissue distribution and possibly function.
Duplicate PAC1 genes have been identified in other teleosts and also for other family 2 GPCR members [14,15] as
expected in light of the proposed partial or full genome
duplication event suggested to have occurred within the
teleost lineage [32,33,35-37].
Analysis of teleost genomes indicates that duplicate PAC1
genes are linked with the recently reclassified GHRH-like
receptor which based upon ligand binding characteristics
has been reassigned as a teleost PRP receptor (PRPR)
[38,39]. In Takifugu, PAC1A and PRPR genes are localised
on scaffold N000080 and PAC1B/PRPR in scaffold
N002399 and in the zebrafish genome on chromosome
10 and 2, respectively [40,41]. In terrestrial vertebrates,
with the exception of mammals, co-localization of both
receptors is also observed suggesting that PAC1 and PRPR
genes arose by tandem gene duplication prior to the teleost divergence and that PRPR gene was subsequently lost
in the mammalian lineage (Figure 6).

Stimulation of cAMP production and not peptide affinity
or activation of alternative signalling pathways has been
investigated and revealed that sbPAC1 receptors are highly
stimulated and have identical potency profiles for the
mammalian PACAP27 and PACAP38 peptides compared to
VIP. The latter peptide was found to be more potent for
sbPAC1A in comparison to sbPAC1B. Although, the identification in teleosts of duplicate genes for the ligands and
the existence of two potentially active PACAP peptides
raises further issues in relation to PAC1 receptor activation
and function. Two copies of PACAP are present in Takifugu (DQ659331 and DQ659332), Tetraodon (Q4RN19
and Q4RH43) and zebrafish (NW_652622 and
NW_634478), but functional studies with the duplicate
receptors and their ligands are scarce. The ligand binding
characteristics of the duplicated zebrafish zfPACAP27 peptides for the zebrafish PAC1 receptor, the sequence homologue of sbPAC1A, was tested and both peptides strongly
stimulate in a similar way the cAMP and phospholipase
pathways [28,42] suggesting conservation of function. A
further measure of complexity is also introduced by the
identification of duplicate VIP genes in teleost genomes
[38,43] and it will be of importance in future to establish
the affinity of the duplicate peptides for the duplicate
receptors, as well as compare their tissue distribution in
teleosts.
Moreover, a microsatellite is identified for the first time in
the 5'UTR of PAC1 receptors. Genotyping analysis of the
microsatellite reveals it is polymorphic in sea bream and
raises intriguing questions about its potential influence
on gene expression. Analysis of homologue regions in

ment [17,18] and the presence of a microsatellite in its
receptor suggests it may be a useful tool for genomic and
functional analysis. A previous study of early growth variation in the Artic charr (Salvelinus alpinus, [47]) revealed a
strong marker-trait association with a single nucleotide
polymorphism (G/A) of the 18th base pair of the intronic
region between the exons that code for PACAP-related
peptide and PACAP in the PRP/PACAP gene precursor.

other teleosts [41] also reveals the presence of a microsatellite in the 5'UTR. For example, in the stickleback PAC1A
and PAC1B respectively, two perfect microsatellite repeats
(TG)21 and (CA)34 and an imperfect (CA)21 dinucleotide
repeat are present. The PAC1A gene in medaka contains a
(TG)8 repeat, although no microsatellite is present in the
paralogue gene (Additional file 3). So far no microsatellites have been described or identified in the mammalian,
chicken, frog and goldfish homologue receptors [28,4446]. The importance of PACAP in growth and develop-

The human SCT peptide failed to significantly stimulate
cAMP production by the sbPAC1 receptor which may indicate either a failure to activate the cAMP signalling pathway or a failure to bind the receptor. The preceding results
are at odds with the physiological role attributed to secretin in fish, pancreatic stimulation via cholecystokinin and
oxyntomodulin [48]. However, SCT has only been identified by immunohistochemistry in the gastrointestinal
tract of the flower fish (Pseudophoxinus antalyae) [49]. The
failure to identify in teleosts a gene for the SCT receptor or
its ligand suggests they probably evolved subsequent to
teleost divergence or were lost during the teleost radiation
and the significant sequence differences between SCT and
VIP or PACAP probably explains the absence of activity of
SCT in the present study [16].
Gene duplicates and generation of alternative splice isoforms are major contributors to functional diversity of the
vertebrate proteome. In teleosts, the existence of gene
duplicates is proposed to reduce the incidence of gene isoforms since they are assumed to generate functional
redundancy of single-copy gene splice isoform [50], and
this may explain reduced number of PAC receptor splice
isoforms detected in the sea bream. In sea bream, a
PAC1Ahop receptor isoform was identified with an overlapping tissue distribution with the shorter PAC1A receptor transcript, but it was different from the tissue
distribution reported for alternative splice isoforms in
zebrafish and goldfish [26,28]. Recently in zebrafish, two
novel IL3 splice isoforms were characterised, a hop2 isoform (insertion of 87 bp) present in ovaries and a novel
skip isoform (resulting in a truncated protein) in the gills
[28]. Characterisation of a recently isolated PAC1 and
hop1 receptor isoform in the goldfish reveals that they
have similar activation profiles raising question about
their functional role [26]. The mounting evidence for the
presence of hop1 receptor isoforms in all vertebrates suggests that a homologue transcript was probably also
expressed by the PAC1 receptor gene in ancestral metazoa
[50]. In order to understand the functional relevance of
duplicate receptors and isoforms it will be important to
establish if they are co-localised in vivo in order to establish possible interactions.
Expression studies of the sbPAC1 genes demonstrated they
are functional family 2 GPCRs and PACAP and VIP pep-

tides were able to stimulate cAMP production in a dose
dependent manner. Such assays also indicate that both
sea bream receptors are specific PACAP receptors and have
different activation profiles for VIP although, as only
cAMP production was measured, it remains to be established if a similar activation profile occurs for the alternative IP3 signalling pathway. One hypothesis for the
apparent functional divergence and differential expression of sea bream paralogue receptors may be related to
functional specialisation related to the existence in teleosts of duplicate ligands which might also explain the significant amino acid changes (48% sequence identity)
observed in the N-terminal region. In mammals, important amino acid motifs involved in receptor binding have
been identified and mutation studies reveal the importance of the N-terminus [20]. Amino acid motifs involved
in ligand binding are conserved between tetrapod and teleost homologue receptors and include the motifs W-D, GW-S and the following amino acids W, P and P (Figure 3).
However, the amino acid motifs that account for potential
ligand selectivity of the teleost duplicated receptors are
still unknown, future receptor mutation studies should
help to clarify this issue.
An intriguing aspect about the sbPAC1 genes is their divergent tissue distribution and this may be the basis of their
specific physiological functions and persistence in the
genome. Understanding the biological function of receptors is complex as it is not only the availability and concentration of receptors but also of ligands and accessory
factors at a given site which will determine receptor preference/activity and ultimately biological function. Physiological studies of the ligands, PACAP and VIP, in teleosts
are not very numerous and certainly do not encompass all
the actions assigned in mammals making it difficult currently to assign possible biological roles to the duplicate
receptors. However, one major function attributed to
PACAP is its role in GH-release [46,51,52]. In common
with mammals, PACAP38 is the predominant isoform in
teleost brain and this peptide is found to have a more
potent stimulatory effect on fish GH secretion by pituitary
cells when compared to GHRH and GnRH (potent mammalian GH releasing factors). In contrast, VIP has little or
no effect on GH release [46,51,52] and this has been taken
to suggest that teleost GH-release is mediated via PAC1
pituitary receptors and the sea bream PAC1B may play a
central role in this process. Relatively few studies have
been carried out to characterise the biological activity of
fish VIP and as in mammals it is proposed to have an
important role in the gastrointestinal system [51,53,54].
In cod, Gadus morhua, VIP stimulates gastric and pancreatic secretion [55,56] and in tilapia it is involved in ion
and water absorption by the intestine [57]. In sea bream,
tissue distribution of PACAP and VIP transcripts indicate
that PACAP is mainly restricted to nervous tissue whilst

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/221

VIP is abundant in the gastrointestinal system but is also
present in a wide range of other tissue (unpublished data).
The widespread distribution in non nervous tissue of
sbPAC1A indicates that this receptor may have a broader
physiological role. Unquestionably much more work is
required to elucidate the physiological relevance of duplicate sbPAC1 and alternative approaches such as ligand
mutational studies; gene knock-down strategies and physiological experiments will be needed.

Conclusion
Duplicate PAC1 receptors genes are present in the majority
of teleost genomes, although the reason for their persistence is not yet clearly established. The present study with
duplicate sbPAC1 receptors suggests that their maintenance may be due to a process of neofuncionalisation as
a consequence of the accumulation of mutations in the
ligand binding domain of the receptors after duplication.
Such a proposal is supported by the poor sequence conservation (48%) in the N-terminal ligand binding domain
of the receptor. The divergent tissue distribution of the
receptors, with one form predominantly found in nervous
tissue and the other with a more widespread distribution
is highly suggestive of functional divergence. The isolation
and characterisation of ligands for the receptors in teleosts
will be an important step in establishing receptor function, as will improved characterisation of the tissue distribution of both receptors and ligands and the factors
regulating their expression.

Methods
Sea bream cDNA library screening
A homologous PAC1 receptor probe (620 bp) was
obtained by RT-PCR using sea bream brain cDNA and
degenerate primers flanking transmembrane regions 2
and 7 (Table 2). PCR reactions were performed in a 25 μl
reaction volume with 1 × PCR buffer (Biocat, Italy), 1,5
mM MgCl2 (Biocat), 0,2 mM dNTPs (GE healthcare, UK),
1 mM of each primer, EuroTaq DNA Polymerase 5 U/μl
(Biocat) and DNase Free water (Sigma-Aldrich). The PCR
product was used to screen sea bream pituitary and kidney
cDNA libraries constructed using the λ-Zap vector II kit
(Stratagene, USA) [58]. The phage libraries were titred to
obtain approximately 500,000 pfu per plate and blotting
procedures were performed in duplicate using Nylon
membranes (Hybond-N, GE healthcare, UK). Probes were
radioactively labelled using α-P32dCTP (GE healthcare,
UK) and the Rediprime kit (GE healthcare, UK) following
manufacturer's instructions. Membrane filters were
hybridised overnight at 58°C with Church-Gilbert
hybridisation solution (1 mM EDTA pH8; 0.5 M NaPO4
pH7.2, 7% (w/v) SDS) and washed under high stringency
conditions at 58°C and exposed to X-OMAT film (Kodak,
USA) at -80°C for 24 hours. Positive clones were selected
based on the intensity of signals and their presence on the

duplicate plate. Single clones were excised into phagemid
vectors using the manufacturer's protocol and DNA was
extracted and sequenced to confirm its identity.
RT-PCR analysis of receptor tissue distribution
Tissue distribution and analysis of PAC1 splice variants
was carried out by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from
sea bream pituitary, brain, kidney, gills, gut, heart,
gonads, liver and skin using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich,
Spain). Mature sea bream of 11–13 months old weighing
approximately 350–500 g were sacrificed by decapitation
and their tissues collected and immediately frozen at 80°C. cDNA was synthesised using 1 μg of sea bream total
RNA and a reverse transcription system kit (Promega,
Spain) and hexameric oligonucleotides following the
manufacture's instructions. The quality of cDNA obtained
was verified by PCR with sea bream EF1-α (a housekeeping gene) using the following thermocycle; 94°C for 2
minutes; 25 cycles (94°C for 1 minute, 58°C for 1 minute
and 72°C for 1 minute) and a final extension step at 72°C
for 5 minutes. Specific primers for each sbPAC1 gene were
designed (Table 2) and PCR was performed as previously
described using the following cycle: 94°C for 2 minutes;
34 cycles (94°C for 1 minute, 62°C for 1 minute and
72°C for 1 minute) and a final step at 72°C for 5 minutes.
The products obtained were sequenced to confirm their
identity.
Genotype analysis
The variability of a microsatellite identified in the 5' UTR
of sbPAC1A and sbPAC1B was assessed using specific
primers (Table 2) and sea bream genomic DNA from fish
of diverse geographic origins (Morocco, Portugal, France
and Adriatic sea) and from a genomic panel composed of
parents and 50 first generation progeny. PCR reactions
were performed using fluorescently labelled forward
primers (0.3 μM; 6-FAM and TET; Metabion International

AG) and unlabelled reverse primers (0.3 μM) using the
following thermocycle: 95°C for 2 minutes; 35 cycles
(95°C for 30 seconds, 57°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for
30 seconds) and a final step at 72°C for 5 minutes. PCR
products were separated using high resolution 6% Long
Ranger acrylamide gels (Cambrex, USA) on a automated
ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) and data
was analysed with the GenScan software (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Database searches, sequence alignments and phylogenetic
analysis
The conserved amino acid sequence of sbPAC1 transmembrane (TM) domains was used to search for homologous
receptors in teleost genomes. Briefly, the amino acid
sequences of the seven TM domains were extracted, concatenated and used in BLAST sequence similarity searches
[59] against the Tetraodon nigroviridis [41], medaka
(Oryzias latipes), stickleback(Gasterosteus aculeatus),
zebrafish (Danio renio) [41] and atlantic salmon (Salmon
salar) [60] genome databases and NCBI EST database
[61]. The amino acid sequence of the TM domains of a
total of 52 receptors were concatenated and a multiple
sequence alignment was produced using the ClustalX
vs1.83 (Blosum matrix and Gap opening penalty 10 and
Gap extension 0.2) [62] and percentage of identity/similarity calculated using Genedoc [63]. The alignment produced (length 170, with 162 informative sites) did not
require the insertion of gaps and was used to construct
phylogenetic trees using both maximum parsimony and
neighbour joining methods [64] with 1000 bootstrap replicates, complete gap deletion and Poisson correction in
MEGA 3.1 phylogenetic programme [65].
Short-range linkage analysis
The gene environment of the Takifugu, Xenopus, chicken
and human PAC1 homologue regions were compared

Page 12 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:221

using a sequence similarity approach. The human and
chicken gene environments were accessed using the NCBI
Mapview interfaces [61] and Xenopus using the Ensembl
database [41]. The gene environment of the Takifugu scaffolds (release17/05) was accessed using NIX annotation
[40] and the neighbouring genes were used to search for
orthologues in human, chicken and Xenopus genomes
using the tblastn algorithm [61].
Construction of the recombinant expression vector
Specific primers for each sbPAC1 gene were designed to
amplify the mature receptor sequence (Table 2) and were
cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, UK) containing a
signal peptide of CD33 and a T7-epitope tag (CD33-T7pcDNA3, [66]). In order to facilitate cloning, restriction
digestion sites for BglII and EcoRI enzymes were incorporated in the forward and reverse primers respectively.
Template amplification was carried out using the thermocyle; 95°C for 2 minutes; 35 cycles of (95°C for 1 minute,
68°C for 1 minute and 70°C 2 minutes); 72°C for 10
minutes with a proof-reading Pfu DNA polymerase
(Promega, Spain) in a 25 μl reaction volume containing 1
× PCR buffer (Promega, Spain), 1,5 mM MgCl2 (Promega,
Spain), 0,2 mM dNTPs (Amersham), 1 mM of each primer
and 1,5 U Pfu DNA polymerase (3 U/μl)) and DNase Free
water (Sigma-Aldrich, Spain). The amplified PCR products were cloned into pGEMT-easy vector (Promega,
Spain), sequenced and subcloned into CD33-T7-pcDNA3
vector in frame with the T7-epitope tag. The recombinant
constructs produced (CD33-T7-pcDNA3+sbPAC1A and
CD33-T7-pcDNA3+sbPAC1B) were sequenced and used
to transfect mammalian Cos7 and Hek293 cells lines. The
CD86 (NM_175862) membrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily cloned in CD33-T7-pcDNA3
expression vector was used as positive control for cell
transfection (de Vet et al., 2001).
Mammalian cell transfections
Mammalian Cos7 and Hek293 cell lines were transfected
using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen, Germany)
and the success of transfection was assessed by western
blot and immunofluorescence assays using antisera raised
against the T7-epitope tag protein [66]. One day prior to
transfection, approximately 60,000 to 70,000 Cos7 and
Hek293 cells were seeded and transfections carried out
using approximately 0.4 μg of recombinant construct
(pcDNA3+sbPAC1A or B) and cells were grown for 2 days
at 37°C. The viability of transfected cells was determined
by dye exclusion using Trypan blue (0,4% solution,
Sigma) and the success of transfection calculated by fluorescent confocal microscopy using DAPI (4',6-Diamidino2-phenylindole) and FITC (Fluorescein) staining for Cos7
cells and the FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting)
method for Hek293 cells. The percentage of cell transfec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/221

tion was estimated to be approximately 30% in both cell
lines.
Immunofluorescence and western blot assays
An anti-T7 epitope monoclonal antibody (Novagen, UK)
was used in immunofluorescence and western blots assays
to assess the success of transfection and production of
recombinant fusion protein (T7+sbPAC1) as described in
de Vet et al., 2001 [66]. Briefly, for the immunofluorescence assay, cells were grown in 6 well plates (Greiner,
Germany) on sterile cover slips. Approximately 120,000
cells were used per well and cell transfections were carried
out using 0.4 μg of DNA as described above. Immunofluorescence localization studies were performed [67] and
DAPI and FITC staining examined using a microscope
linked to a confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad, UK). Western blots were carried out by lysing transfected cells (30
μl) in 1× Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer [68] and proteins were fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel with a
constant current of 35 mA. The fractionated proteins were
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE healthcare,
UK) and blocked (2% milk powder in 1 × PBS/
0.1%Tween) for 1 hour at room temperature. Incubations
were carried out with anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody
(Novagen, UK) and a secondary antibody coupled to
Horse-Radish peroxidase as described in de Vet., 2001
[66]. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the
ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, UK). The size of
the immunoreactive protein was comparable to the estimated sizes of the recombinant receptor protein determined in silico using the Swiss Prot database interface
[69].
Ligand-binding studies
Ligand binding studies were performed two days after
transfections, in three independent experiments. Transfected cells were incubated in duplicate with different concentrations (10-6 to 10-11M) of the human VIP, PACAP38
and secretin (SCT) peptides and ovine PACAP27 peptide
for 30 minutes (Sigma-Aldrich, Spain). Homologous sea
bream peptides are unavailable but their predicted amino
acid sequences are 82%, 100%and 92% identical to
human VIP, PACAP27 and PACAP38 respectively and
important amino acids at N-terminus potential involved
in receptor binding are totally conserved (unpublished
data). Prior to ligand-binding assays, Cos7 and Hek293
cells were washed 3 times with DMEM medium without
fetal calf serum and incubated in a CO2 incubator with 1
mM of IBMX (3-Isobutyl-1-Methylxantine) for 30 minutes. Ligand-binding assays were performed by incubating
the cells in fresh medium containing the peptides in the
presence of 1 mM IBMX for 30 minutes at 37°C in the
CO2 incubator. After incubation, cells were lysed and
stored at -80°C until required. Mammalian Cos7 and
Hek293 cells transfected with wild type pcDNA3 were

used as negative controls which were incubated with the
highest tested peptide concentration (10-6mM). Prior to
assays the responsiveness of transfected Cos7 and Hek293
cells was tested by stimulating cAMP production using
Forskolin (10 mM, 1 mM and 0.1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich).

Radioimmunoassay (RIA) and statistical analyses
The quantification of cAMP produced was determined by
radioimmunoassay using the TRK432 kit (GE Healthcare,
UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cos7 and
Hek293 cells were lysed by sonication, centrifuged and
the supernatant heat denatured for 10 minutes at 100°C.
The concentration of cAMP produced (pmol/well) was
determined in duplicate for each sample and calculations
performed based on a linear regression curve constructed
using standard concentrations of labelled (3H) cAMP. The
cAMP data was normalized as a percentage of stimulation
above basal levels and plotted as a percentage of cAMP
production per well (%cAMP/well). The results are presented as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments in duplicate and analysis was performed using the
SigmaPlot9.01 programme. Data was analyzed by comparing the potency profile of each sbPAC1 receptor in the
presence of different concentrations of test peptides and
by comparing the potency profile of both receptors in the
presence of identical peptide concentrations. The presence
of significant differences in cAMP production was
assessed with the SigmaStat3.11 programme using two
way Anova and the Holm-Sidak method for pairwise multiple comparisons (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001 were considered statistically significant).

Authors' contributions
The majority of the work described was carried by JCRC
and the cell expression studies were carried out in collaboration with ECJMV and GE. BL carried out the genotype
analysis. MSC and DMP planned the study, discussed the
results and critically revised the manuscript for important
intellectual content and data analysis. All authors read
and approved the final manuscript.
