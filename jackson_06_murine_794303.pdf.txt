Abstract
Background: The rodent specific reproductive homeobox (Rhox) gene cluster on the X
chromosome has been reported to contain twelve homeobox-containing genes, Rhox1-12.
Results: We have identified a 40 kb genomic region within the Rhox cluster that is duplicated eight
times in tandem resulting in the presence of eight paralogues of Rhox2 and Rhox3 and seven
paralogues of Rhox4. Transcripts have been identified for the majority of these paralogues and all
but three are predicted to produce full-length proteins with functional potential. We predict that
there are a total of thirty-two Rhox genes at this genomic location, making it the most gene-rich
homoeobox cluster identified in any species. From the 95% sequence similarity between the eight
duplicated genomic regions and the synonymous substitution rate of the Rhox2, 3 and 4 paralogues
we predict that the duplications occurred after divergence of mouse and rat and represent the
youngest homoeobox cluster identified to date. Molecular evolutionary analysis reveals that this
cluster is an actively evolving region with Rhox2 and 4 paralogues under diversifying selection and
Rhox3 evolving neutrally. The biological importance of this duplication is emphasised by the
identification of an important role for Rhox2 and Rhox4 in regulating the initial stages of embryonic
stem (ES) cell differentiation.
Conclusion: The gene rich Rhox cluster provides the mouse with significant biological novelty that
we predict could provide a substrate for speciation. Moreover, this unique cluster may explain
species differences in ES cell derivation and maintenance between mouse, rat and human.

Background
Homeobox genes encode transcription factors defined by
a 60 amino acid homeodomain motif and have fundamental roles in many aspects of biology [1-4]. The most
studied example of these are the Hox genes which have an
ancestral role in the patterning of the primary body axis
and in vertebrates have adopted additional roles in a
number of processes including limb and genital development [5-7]. In the majority of species, Hox genes are further defined by their clustered organisation in the
genome. For example, in Drosophila, eight Hox genes are
present in a single cluster whereas in mammals, four clusters exist of up to twelve genes on four separate chromosomes [8]. The clustered organisation of Hox genes is
crucial to their function. Hox genes show colinearity of
expression where the relative position of the Hox genes
along the cluster correlates with the time and domain of
gene expression along the anterior -posterior axis of the
body [9]. The maintenance of Hox clusters has provided a
model of evolution by gene duplication, an essential
source of material for the generation of novel gene function. It is predicted that, initially, newly duplicated genes
are functionally redundant. Three different evolutionary
outcomes exist which will resolve this redundancy. Duplicate genes can either be lost by degenerative mutations
(nonfunctionalization), functionally compromised in a
complementary fashion such that the duplicated genes are
functionally equivalent to the single copy ancestral gene
(subfunctionalisation) or acquire novel function through
natural selection of beneficial mutations (neofunctionalization). Hox clusters provide evidence for all three evolutionary processes [10,11].
Recently, a novel homeobox gene cluster (Rhox) was discovered on the X chromosome containing 12 genes
(Rhox1-12). Rhox genes are primarily expressed in reproductive tissues and placenta with additional expression
domains in endodermal derived tissues [3]. Rhox5 is
essential for the production and motility of sperm [3] and
we have shown that Rhox4 plays an important role in the
early stages of ES cell differentiation [12]. It was reported
that the Rhox cluster also displays colinearity with the
level and timing of expression during spermatogenesis of
subsets of Rhox genes consistent with their position within
specific sub-clusters [3]. Interestingly, the Rhox cluster
appears to be rodent specific with only two Rhox homologues identified in humans leading to speculation that
the cluster is involved in the increased reproductive capacity of rodents compared to humans [3].
We describe an extensive duplication within the murine
Rhox cluster consisting of eight tandem repeats of a 40
kilobase (kb) unit containing Rhox2, 3 and 4 potentially
increasing the number of Rhox genes in this cluster to
thirty-two. Transcripts have been identified for the major-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/212

ity of these paralogues and all but three are predicted to
produce full-length proteins. Sequence and evolutionary
analyses reveal significant differences in the evolutionary
signatures of Rhox 2,3 and 4 paralogues indicative of distinct selection pressures. We have performed functional
studies in ES cells that strongly support a role for both
Rhox2 and Rhox4 in embryonic stem cell biology.

Results

Genomic structure of the duplicated Rhox α sub-cluster
In the course of a detailed analysis of the Rhox4 gene from
the mouse genome assembly, we identified multiple copies of Rhox2, Rhox3 and Rhox4 spanning approximately
350 kb of the X chromosome at region A2 from position
29780 K to 30100 K. Dotplot analysis of this genomic
region identified a tandem segmental duplication composed of an approximately 40 kb unit repeated eight
times; six in the forward orientation (A-F) and two in
reverse orientation (G&H) (Figure 1A). Each of these
duplications contain a single copy of Rhox2, 3 and 4 with
the exception of repeat F which lacks Rhox4 due to a truncation of the 3 prime end. There are therefore eight paralogues of Rhox2 and Rhox3 and seven of Rhox4 (Figure 1A)
producing 32 Rhox genes in total. Variation exists between
each repeat that is primarily due to small rearrangements
and repeat element insertions, particularly long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). Outwith these features,
BLAST analysis reveals greater than 95% similarity
between each repeat, the majority of which is intergenic
sequence (Figure 1B). From the level of similarity and the
small rearrangements and repeat element insertions
between the different units, one can make the hypothesis
that there were several rounds of duplication with the oldest repeats being at the 3 prime end. Indeed for the two
reverse repeat units at the 3 prime region it is difficult to
define their boundaries accurately because of more extensive rearrangements. The organisation of this duplication
is consistent with other rodent segmental duplications
that are largely tandem or tightly clustered [13]. The maintenance of orientation and spacing between the different
paralogues of Rhox2, 3, and 4 suggests that it is unlikely
that any of the paralogues have arisen independently of
the 40 kb tandem segmental duplications.

Given such high similarity between the duplications, we
sought to eliminate the possibility of improperly assembled database sequence using Southern Blot analysis.
Genomic DNA from CGR8 ES cells was digested with HindIII and Asp718, two enzymes that are predicted to produce significantly different fragment sizes when probed
with Rhox4 sequence spanning exon1 and intron1. The
Rhox4 probe hybridises to multiple HindIII fragments of
approximately 20, 13, 10 and 5 kb with Asp718 producing 23, 18, 13, 10, and 8 kb fragments (Figure 1C) that are
consistent with the predicted sizes from the database

repeat A to B-H, second row repeat B to C-H and so on. C. Southern Blot analysis. CGR8 ES cell genomic DNA digested with
Asp718 (lane 1) and HindIII (lane2) and hybridised to Rhox4 exon 1 and intron 1 probe. Multiple bands can be seen with both
digests (arrowed) of approximately 20, 13, 10 and 5 kb (HindIII) and 23, 18, 13, 10, and 8 kb (Asp718). Mus domesticus (lane 3)
and Mus spretus (lane 4) genomic DNA digested with HindIII and hybridised to a Rhox4 exon 2 probe. Fragment sizes common
to the Mus musculus (ES cells) and Mus domesticus are arrowed. Additional bands are predicted to be due to the differences
between the probes used. Positions of size standards are provided in kilobases.

sequence. Identical results were observed for genomic
DNA isolated from the Mus musculus strains C57/Bl6,
Balb/c and FVB. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
from Mus domesticus and Mus spretus identified multiple
fragments hybridising to Rhox4 consistent with multiple
duplications of the Rhox cluster in these species. These
data suggest that the database sequence represents genuine genomic duplications and are highly unlikely to be
artefacts of the genomic sequence build.

Predicted cDNA and protein sequences encoded by
duplicated Rhox genes
We analysed the gene structure and the predicted cDNA
and amino acid sequence of each Rhox paralogue. The
similarity between each of the duplications is manifest in
the preservation of intron-exon structure between each
variant of Rhox2, 3 and 4 [see Additional file 1]. Clustal W

from repeats A-H revealed, as with the overall duplication

unit similarity, greater than 95% similarity between
Rhox2A-H, Rhox3A-H and Rhox4A-H [see Additional file
2]. Despite such a high similarity we were able to build up
a unique nucleotide profile of each copy of Rhox2, 3and 4
allowing them to be definitively identified (Figure 2A, C,
[see Additional file 3]).
We focussed on Rhox2A-H and Rhox4A-H and used these
nucleotide profiles to determine whether these paralogues
were expressed. Using primer sequences common to all
copies of Rhox2 or Rhox4, we cloned and sequenced RTPCR products derived from RNA isolated from differentiating ES cells and placenta, cell types known to express
Rhox2 and 4. In addition, the mouse subset database of
expressed sequence tags (est_mouse) was analysed for the
unique nucleotide profile of each paralogue. Using both

techniques, the expression of six out of eight paralogues of
Rhox2 (A, B, C, D, G, H) and five out of seven paralogues
of Rhox4 (A, B, D, E, H) were confirmed (Figure 2A, C).
Translation of the predicted cDNAs for each of Rhox2, 3
and 4 paralogue is presented in Figure 2B, D and [see
Additional file 1]. ClustalW analysis of RHOX2, 3 and 4
paralogues identifies most variation in protein sequence
within the RHOX2 paralogues with RHOX3 showing the
least variation (Figure 2; [see Additional files 2 and 3]).
Both RHOX2 and RHOX4 groups have non-conservative
amino acid variations within the homeodomain region
including residues crucial for homeodomain packing or
DNA binding [9] (Figure 2B, D). Such protein sequence
variation could provide functional variation between the
RHOX2 and RHOX4 paralogues with, for example,
changes in homeodomain sequence leading to different

DNA binding characteristics. Alternatively, such changes
may reflect the nonfunctionalisation of paralogues due to
disrupted DNA binding. RHOX3B, D and G contain nonsense mutations that truncate the predicted proteins after
9 (B and G) or 174 (D) amino acids [see Additional file
3]. These three genes are unlikely to be functional due to
the absence of the homeodomain indicating that these
paralogues have become pseudogenes.

Table 1: Calculation of dN,dS and ω values for all Rhox2,3 and 4
paralogues.

These data, therefore, predicts that eight of the Rhox2, five
of the Rhox3 and seven of the Rhox4 paralogues are capable of producing full-length proteins. Therefore, of the
thirty-two genes in the Rhox cluster, at least twenty-nine
are predicted to be functional which is over twice the
number of genes present in the largest homeobox cluster
identified to date in any species.

cations are relatively recent [16]. Moreover, there is a 10fold difference in the synonymous substitution rates
between Rhox2 and Rhox3 or Rhox4. Given that the gene
paralogues were duplicated together as single genomic
fragments this suggests that the rate of nucleotide change
is significantly different between Rhox2, 3 and 4.

Molecular evolution of Rhox2, 3 and 4
Rhox2, 3 and 4 are in tandem alignment with each other
and show some sequence similarity. However, nucleotide
similarity is low; for example, Rhox2 and Rhox4 are
approximately 65% similar and are, therefore, evolving as
separate loci. Given that the paralogues present on each
duplication unit arose simultaneously, this could be suggestive of different evolutionary pressures on the paralogues within each duplication unit. To test this
hypothesis we calculated maximum likelihood estimates
of rates of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous substitution (dS) among alignments of Rhox2, 3 and 4 paralogues using a codon-based model of sequence evolution.
These models allowed both the analysis of branch specific
ratios of the rates of dN and dS, or codon specific ratios
along the sequence, following the methods proposed by
Yang and colleagues [14,15] respectively. Generally, it is
assumed that synonymous substitutions among lineages
(genes) accumulate through a neutral or nearly neutral
process, and by comparing this rate of accumulation to
that for non-synonymous substitutions it is possible to
ask whether the non-synonymous substitutions accumulate more (diversifying or positive selection) or less (constrained) than the neutral rate. Effectively a dN/dS rate of
one is neutral, dN/dS significantly greater than one suggests positive or diversifying selection and a significant
dN/dS of less than one indicates amino-acid constraint.
We calculated these ratios, henceforth called ω, for the
whole gene for each lineage to ask whether particular lineages (duplicates) were evolving under positive selection
and for each codon across all lineages in order to ask
whether a codon was under positive selection.

The estimates of dN, dS and ω across each set of paralogues of Rhox2, 3 and 4 are given in Table 1. Both the dN
and dS rates are relatively low particularly in comparison
to genome-wide estimates of divergence between Mus
musculus and Rattus norvegicus confirming that these dupli-

To confirm that the ω values are different between Rhox
genes, we selected Rhox2 and Rhox4 and asked whether
they are evolving differently after aligning the Rhox2 and
Rhox4 paralogues to each other. Allowing the Rhox2 genes
to have one ratio and the Rhox4 genes to have another
ratio, we found that the likelihood (l) of a model with different ratios (l = -1838.04, number of parameters (np) =
31) significantly differed from a model where all the Rhox
genes had the same ratio (l = -1844.17 np = 29, 2(Δl) =
12.26 p-value < 0.01 with df = 2). Taken together, this
data shows that the Rhox loci, as part of a relatively
recently duplicated genomic region, are under different
evolutionary selection.
Given that there was significant variation among the Rhox
loci, it seemed reasonable to test whether ω values were
the same among the individual paralogues within each of
Rhox2, 3, and 4. Given a tree for each set of genes (Figure
3A) we estimated substitution rates along each lineage.
For Rhox2, the one-ratio model, which assumes the same
ω parameter for the entire tree, leads to l0 = -1242.17. We
performed analysis of models allowing all branches to
have different ω values and we also placed different constraints on the different branches, particularly for
branches labelled A and B; (Figure 3A): ωA, ωB, ω0. Ratios
for branches A and B (ωA = ωB) are significantly greater
than the background ratio (2Δ l = 10.32 p < 0.05) and also
significantly greater than one. However, a model allowing
all branches to vary did not significantly differ from the
one ratio model.
Among the Rhox4 paralogues (Figure 3C) mostly non-synonymous substitutions were observed. Again, the log-likelihood difference between the one-ratio model and the
free-ratio model suggests that there are no significant differences between the ratios of different branches (2Δ l =
6.16, df = 10, 0.50 < p-value < 0.90). This analysis is limited as no ω values can be calculated for certain lineages
due to the absence of synonymous substitutions. For

Rhox3 paralogues B, D and G have in-frame stop codons
and we would expect mutations to accumulate in a neutral
fashion in these paralogues if they have lost function. The
comparison of the free-ratio model and the one-ratio
model indicates that there are no differences among
branches (2Δ l = 5.33, df = 12, 0.50 < p-value < 0.90) (Figure 3B).
We next tested for variable ω among codons. The strict
neutral model assumes that a proportion p0 of sites are
conserved with ω 0 = 0 and a proportion p1 = 1- p0 are neutral with ω1 = 1 fitting the data better than a strict one-ratio
model which assumes the same ratio for all sites. The
alternative model allows for variable ω among codons,
with some codons having ω1> 1 (diversifying positive
selection). We used a likelihood (PAML) and a bayesian
approach [17] to test for a departure from neutrality
among codons. The likelihood approach assumes no
recombination (one phylogenetic history) whereas the
bayesian approach allows for recombination to occur
among lineages throughout the sequence (and hence,
independent multiple genealogies). Using PAML, all
models that allow for positively selected sites suggest
existence of such sites among Rhox2 and Rhox4 paralogues
(Figure 4A, B). For example, the selection model (M8 in
PAML) suggests that ≈ 9% of Rhox2 amino acid sites are
under positive selection. For Rhox3, the test of variable
ratios among sites (codons) suggests that no particular
codon is under positive selection which is consistent with
a potential set of pseudogenes. Using the bayesian
approach implemented in Omegamap (see methods)
similar regions and codons identified with PAML analyses
above were likely to be subject to positive selection (Figure 4C, D). Very different codons appear to be under positive selection in the two genes. For example, the extreme
5' coding portion of the Rhox2 appears to be under positive selection wheras the same region appears to be highly
constrained in Rhox4. The complete lack of overlap in positive selection between Rhox2 and Rhox4 suggests that
these two genes families have diverged to perform different functions. There is little evidence of recombination
between paralogues (ie. Between Rhox2 and Rhox4) as
these genes are very different from each other. Regardless,
it appears that the possible presence of gene conversion or
recombination has not inhibited our ability to detect positive selection on some codons at the Rhox cluster.
Rhox2 has a comparable function to Rhox4 in ES cells
Given the complexity of this genomic region, it is not possible to specifically delete Rhox2, Rhox3 or Rhox4 from the
genome by standard homologous recombination technology. A more complex genome engineering approach
would have to be employed to delete the whole duplicated region and subsequent transgenic rescue approaches
performed to assign specific functions (if any) to Rhox2,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/212

Rhox3 or Rhox4. As an alternative, and more immediate
approach we have used an overexpression strategy in an
attempt to compare the function of the different Rhox
genes.
We had previously identified Rhox4 (Ehox), as a crucial
factor in the early stages of ES cell differentiation [12]. We
identified Rhox2 as the most closely related gene to Rhox4
within the Rhox cluster, so we were interested to assess
whether it had a comparable function. We therefore used
the same episomal expression system [18,19] to directly
compare the function of these two genes in this system.
Rhox2 and Rhox4 are expressed at comparable levels in
undifferentiated ES cells and are downregulated as ES cells
initiate differentiation in the absence of Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) [12] (data not shown). We directly compared the effects of altering the level of expression of
Rhox2 and Rhox4 on the self-renewal and differentiation
potential of ES cells both in the presence and absence of
LIF. E14/T ES cells were transfected with constructs
expressing RHOX2A or RHOX4B, cultures were selected in
puromycin in the presence of LIF and the numbers of
resistant colonies were counted six days later (Figure 5A).
Flow cytometry of enhanced green fluorescent protein
(eGFP) transfected control cultures and the expression
levels of Rhox2 anti-sense transcripts in ES cells transfected
with Rhox2 anti-sense expression constructs demonstrated
a very high transfection efficiency [see Additional file 4].
We confirmed our previous findings that over-expression
of RHOX4B was incompatible with the maintenance of
undifferentiated ES cells [12] as indicated by the significant reduction in the number of puromycin resistant colonies. Over-expression of RHOX2A had a similar effect
with virtually no colonies surviving after puromycin selection. However, we were able to maintain a pool of
RHOX4B-over-expressing ES cells upon replating in LIF
[12] (Figure 5B) whereas it proved impossible to maintain
a line of ES cells over-expressing RHOX2A (Figure 5B).
This difference could either reflect slight functional differences between RHOX2A and 4B or by the differences in
expression levels that are achieved using the Internal
Ribosomal Entry Site- Puromycin resistance (IRES-PURO)
construct. We can conclude that expression of RHOX2A or
RHOX4B at a high level is incompatible with an undifferentiated ES cell phenotype possibly driving them into a
differentiated cell type that has a significantly reduced viability and/or clonogenic potential.
We used constructs carrying full-length anti-sense
sequence of Rhox2A and Rhox4B that have the potential to
block expression of endogenous transcripts. We have
observed successful knockdown of RHOX4B protein
when anti-sense Rhox4B was co-transfected in COS7 cells
[12] and we see no reduction in RHOX4B protein when
anti-sense Rhox2A is co-transfected with the Rhox4B-

expressing vector (Figure 5C). Furthermore, the antiRHOX4 antibody does not detect a band in COS7 cells
transfected with Rhox2A-expressing plasmid (Figure 5C)
so taken together these data suggest that this strategy can
be effective and specific. Given the similarity between paralogues of each gene we predict that this type of anti-sense
approach could knockdown all paralogues of the gene
under test.
Rhox4 anti-sense expression resulted in a comparable
number of colonies compared to control transfections,
whereas Rhox2 anti-sense expression resulted in a slight
increase in the number of puromycin resistant colonies
(Figure 5A). This could indicate that blocking RHOX2

expression using the full-length anti-sense construct conferred a survival advantage on undifferentiated ES cells
and contributed to them maintaining their undifferentiated state and self-renewal capacity. The phenotype of
alkaline phosphatase-stained colonies after puromycin
selection and subsequent re-plating in the absence of LIF
further substantiated this finding (Figure 5B). We had previously shown (and confirm here) that when LIF is withdrawn from ES cells expressing anti-sense Rhox4, small,
undifferentiated colonies were detected but no differentiated cells were observed (Figure 5B). This suggested that
blocking the expression of RHOX4 inhibits ES cell differentiation even in the absence of LIF. In contrast, when LIF
is withdrawn from anti-sense Rhox2 expressing cells a pro-

portion of cells remain undifferentiated but we also
observe a significant number of differentiated cells. Thus
inhibiting expression of RHOX2 and RHOX4 apparently
results in a partial or complete block in differentiation,
respectively. A block in differentiation is also apparent in
anti-sense Rhox4 expressing cells when cultured in the
presence of LIF, where all colonies are alkaline phosphatase positive (stem cell) with no spontaneous differentiation observed (Figure 5B). Many spontaneously
differentiating cells are observed when anti-sense Rhox2

expressing cells are cultured in LIF (Figure 5B), a finding
that is consistent with the idea that blocking RHOX2 only
partially blocks differentiation. This qualitative difference
in the degree of differentiation may reflect a functional
difference between RHOX2 and RHOX4 in ES cells. Alternatively, this observation could be explained by differences in the levels of sense and anti-sense expression. We
can conclude however, that the levels of expression of
both RHOX2 and 4 play a role in the early stages of ES cell
differentiation in vitro.

Discussion
We have identified extensive tandem duplications of
Rhox2, 3 and 4 on the mouse X chromosome resulting in
a total of 32 Rhox genes of which all but three are predicted to produce functional proteins. The Rhox cluster
therefore, has more genes than any other homeobox cluster identified in any species. Moreover, the degree of similarity between the genomic regions and molecular
evolutionary analysis of Rhox2, 3 and 4 suggests that this
represents the most recent homeobox gene duplication
identified to date. Despite such a recent duplication event,
Rhox2 and 4 paralogues show evidence of positive selection in their evolutionary history suggesting a potential
function for these genes. We have also identified a role for
Rhox2 and Rhox4 in the maintenance and differentiation
of ES cells supporting the biologically importance of this
duplication.
A mouse specific duplication of Rhox2, 3 and 4
The lack of sequence divergence between each 40 kb
duplication unit and the dS values for Rhox2, 3 and 4
imply that the duplication events are relatively young. We
predict that the duplications occurred after the divergence
of mouse and rat. The alignment of over 70,000 exons
common to mouse and rat predicts a synonymous substitution rate of 0.17 [16] over 10-fold greater than the Rhox2
paralogues with a dS value of 0.0122 and 100-fold greater
for the Rhox4 paralogues at 0.001. Obviously, the dS values are an average for all Rhox2, 3 and 4 paralogues and
do not reflect the sequential nature of the duplication
events. Nevertheless, assuming that mouse and rat
diverged 16 million years ago [20,21], a constant molecular clock would result in the relative age of the Rhox duplicates being less than one tenth the time split between
mouse and rat or approximately <1.6 million years. However, the dS ratio is not an accurate measure of time as
unequal cross-over and gene conversion events can act to
alter dS values. This may be particularly relevant in a
region showing such repetitive similarity.

Mus spretus and Mus domesticus are predicted to have
diverged from Mus musculus approximately three million
and one million years ago respectively [22]. The presence
of multiple Rhox4 copies in Mus spretus suggests that the
duplication events were well underway before the divergence of these species 3 million years ago. Preliminary
Southern blot analysis using mouse specific Rhox4 probes
suggest that, at most, two copies of Rhox4 exist in rat (data
not shown). Moreover, we screened the rat genome
(RGSC v3.4) with the highly conserved exon 3 sequence
of Rhox2, 3 and 4 to see if we could identify different paralogues of these genes as evidence for the presence of
these duplications in rat. We identified a single homologue of Rhox4 on the rat X chromosome (95% similarity)
but none for Rhox2 or 3. By comparison the same screen

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/212

in mouse identifies multiple copies with different chromosomal coordinates. Although the synonymous substitution rate and absence of Rhox paralogues in the rat do
not definitively show the absence of Rhox duplicates in rat
these data support our contention that the duplications
are murine specific.
Molecular evolution of the Rhox cluster
The molecular evolution analysis of all paralogues, individual paralogues and individual codons within paralogues suggests that both Rhox2 and Rhox4 have different
degrees of diversifying selection in their evolutionary history whereas Rhox3 is evolving neutrally. An extensive
analysis of single gene duplicates from a number of species reveals that duplicates typically undergo a phase of
relaxed selection or even accelerated evolution at replacement sites and progressively become more constrained as
they age [23]. Although we report a multiple duplication
event, our data is consistent with this observation. The differences observed between the evolutionary profiles of
Rhox2, 3 and 4 could reflect a number of evolutionary and
functional differences. Rhox2, 3 and 4 are expressed at different stages in the development of the testes and ES cell
differentiation and Rhox4 is uniquely expressed in the
developing and adult thymus [3,24]. We predict that such
differing biological functions for Rhox2, 3 and 4 will put
different evolutionary constraints on these genes resulting
in different evolutionary outcomes.

Despite the relatively young age of these duplications
these data supports divergent selection pressures on a subset of Rhox2 and Rhox4 paralogues that is driving functional change. This is at odds with many other
transcription factors, including Hox genes, which typically
show strong evolutionary constraint [25]. However, it is
consistent with a function for Rhox genes in reproduction.
Sexual conflict, sexual selection and sperm competition
are predicted to exert a strong selective pressure driving
the rapid evolution of reproductive genes including transcription factors [26,27]. For Rhox2 we identified two lineages that show significant diversifying selection in their
evolutionary history. This data is indicative of a degree of
neo-functionalisation for Rhox2A, D and E relative to the
other Rhox2 paralogues. Within Rhox2 and 4, individual
codons have been identified which show evidence of positive selection. Of interest are Rhox2(132) and
Rhox4(170)which translate to non-conservative substitutions within the homeobox region of these genes. Mutations within homeodomains are significant as subtle
changes in DNA binding affinity could have important
biological affects due to the alteration of downstream
gene activation or repression. Consequently, there exists
important constraint on homeodomain evolution with
Rhox5 providing one of the few examples of positive selection within this region [27,28].

One surprising feature of the molecular evolution of
Rhox2, 3 and 4 is the marked differences in the synonymous substitution rates. Differences in base composition,
variable mutation rate and gene conversion are all mechanism by which the synonymous substitution rates could
vary between genes. Studies in E.coli and S. cerevisiae suggest a relationship between gene expression levels and
mutation rates [29,30]. Although its significance in mammals is unknown, Rhox2 is expressed 5-fold higher than
Rhox4 during testis development [3]. Moreover, if the
transcriptional control elements of each gene are preserved between duplication units then so will the mechanism for variable dS values between genes. Gene
conversion could be a factor in suppressing sequence variation in Rhox3 and Rhox4 paralogues but not Rhox2
although, again, this would have to be consistent over all
duplication units to maintain the discrepancy in dS values. Regardless of mechanism, Rhox2 paralogues show significantly more sequence variation than Rhox3 and 4,
which may affect the evolutionary trajectories of these
genes. Regardless of whether gene conversion is contributing to the evolution of these genes, it is unlikely to affect
our inferences of adaptation at this region [31].
Rhox function in ES cells
We provide experimental evidence to show that at least
two genes (Rhox2 and Rhox4) within the duplicated region
of the Rhox cluster play a role in the maintenance and
early differentiation of ES cells. Although we used paralogues RHOX2A and RHOX4B in these studies, the similarity between the Rhox2 and Rhox4 paralogues would
predict that these other paralogues would have comparable effects. Both genes are expressed in undifferentiated ES
cells so we tested the effects of altering the levels of expression of RHOX2 and RHOX4 on the undifferentiated phenotype. This strategy has revealed other homeoboxcontaining genes, Oct4 and Nanog as key stem cell regulators [19,32]. Increases in Oct4 expression levels in ES cells
induces differentiation in a manner that is dominant over
the suppressive effects of LIF and overexpression of Nanog
has been shown to drive self-renewal of ES cells in the
absence of LIF. We show that artificially high levels of
RHOX2 or RHOX4 are incompatible with an undifferentiated ES cell phenotype either because such high levels of
these proteins affect the viability of undifferentiated ES
cells or because they override the effects of LIF and drive
undifferentiated ES cells into a differentiated state that
cannot survive. We favour the latter explanation because
when we reduce the levels of RHOX4, differentiation of ES
cells appears to be blocked. Reduction of RHOX2 protein
increases the numbers of self-renewing colonies in the
presence of LIF and, in the absence of LIF, blocking either
RHOX2 or RHOX4 results in is a persistence of self-renewing stem cells that are not observed in control cultures. As
mentioned, we predict that the anti-sense approach we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/212

have used to disrupt Rhox gene function is likely to affect
all paralogues. A siRNA approach could extend these studies to assess the function of the individual paralogues.
Although ES cells have proven invaluable as a research
tool they are not considered to be entirely equivalent to
the inner cell mass tissue from which they are derived
[33]. Consequently, relating the function of Rhox proteins
in the in vitro ES cells system to any evolutionary analysis
is inappropriate. However, RHOX4 is expressed in trophoblast stem (TS) cells in vitro and in vivo supporting a
function for Rhox4 in the stem cell compartment of developing placenta that would provide selective pressure for
evolutionary change [3,24]. Consequently, the analysis of
Rhox function in TS cells would be more applicable to
molecular evolutionary data. For example, over-expression of different Rhox paralogues in TS cell cultures may
help identify whether positive selection of certain paralogues or codons is associated with differences in downstream gene expression changes.
Our data suggest that the expression levels of Rhox2 and 4
may be crucial to their function in ES cells and this phenomenon may be applicable to other cell types in which
they are expressed. Gene duplication is used by a number
of genes, for example rRNA and histones, as a means of
driving high-level gene expression. The possibility arises
that the number of Rhox2, 3 and 4 paralogues is linked to
the expression levels of these genes. The modulation of
Rhox gene expression levels in ES cells and the consequent
affects on ES biology will begin to address this issue.
Our studies reveal the crucial role for this duplicated
region of the Rhox cluster in murine ES cell biology. It is
well documented that ES cells derived from mouse, rat
and human exhibit markedly different characteristics in
terms of their growth requirements and developmental
potential [34,35]. The mouse specific duplication of
Rhox2, 3 and 4 and the rodent specific Rhox cluster are
obvious candidates for mediating these species differences.

Conclusion
The Rhox cluster therefore appears a very plastic region of
the rodent genome with the mouse containing twenty
more Rhox genes than rat and rat containing ten more
Rhox genes than human. Expression in the reproductive
tissues and a function for Rhox5 in male fertility has lead
to the hypothesis that the rodent specific cluster may, in
part, mediate the higher reproductive capacity of rodents
relative to humans. The expanded Rhox cluster in the
mouse provides a large number of substrates for the generation of evolutionary novelties. This is of particular
interest as it has been postulated that both gene duplica-

tion and the rapid evolution of reproductive proteins are
an important mechanism in speciation [23,26].

Methods
Genome sequence analysis
The genomic sequence used for this study is from the
NCBI m33 mouse assembly (freeze May 27, 2004, strain
C57BL/6J). The dotplot was created by comparing the first
duplication unit ("A") to the entire rhox cluster region. We
used Advanced Pipmaker on the Pipmaker website [36]
with the Dotplot and single coverage option. Repeat content has been determined using RepeatMasker. Presence
of LINE fragments larger than 500 bp have been annotated in the dot plot. Similarity between repeat units was
calculated by first removing repeat elements insertions
and small rearrangements. Sequences were subsequently
compared using the BLAST algorithm and an overall percentage similarity match calculated.
Southern blot
Southern blotting was carried out as previously described
[37]. Briefly, genomic DNA from CGR8 ES cells was
digested with Asp718 and HindIII and hybridised to a 208
bp probe spanning Rhox4 exon1 and intron1. Mus domesticus and Mus spretus genomic DNA was digested with HindIII and hybridised to a 370 bp Rhox4 exon 2 probe.
Sequence alignment and expression analysis
The individual paralogues of Rhox2, 3 and 4 were assembled from the genomic sequence (see above). Alignments
were carried out using the ClustalW algorithm within the
MegAlign program of DNAstar [38]. The individual profiles of each paralogue were determined by selecting 10
nucleotides that gave a unique profile. RNA was isolated
from CGR8 ES cells and placenta and RT-PCR was performed as described previously [12] using the primers
Rhox2-5' GGAATAAGGACTTCCACGGCTTTACA and
Rhox2-3' AACTGTGTTGTAACAGGGCTTTGGCGGC to
amplify Rhox2A-H and Rhox4-5' CGACTCAGAATCTGCTGGGG Rhox4-3' CAGGGGTCTGCACGTGGCTC to
amplify Rhox4A-H. PCR products were TA cloned (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The BLAST algorithm [39] was used
to search the mouse subset database of expressed
sequences using the full length Rhox2A or Rhox4A
sequence (most recently analysed July 2005) and positive
hits compared to the unique nucleotide profile for each
paralogue of Rhox2 and Rhox4. Each unique nucleotide
profile for Rhox2 and 4 has a minimum of 3 different
nucleotides between paralogues with the exception of
Rhox2B and E (2 nucleotides different), Rhox2D and G (1
nucleotide difference) and Rhox4A and C (2 differences).
Misidentification of individual paralogues due to
sequencing errors would require a minimum of 3 independent sequencing errors in these positions and is therefore extremely unlikely.

Molecular evolution
Sequences were aligned using ClustalX Maximum likelihood estimates of dN/dS (the parameter) for each lineage
in the phylogenies (see Figure 3) were derived by a
method employing different evolutionary models, using
the CODEML program of PAML Version 3.0 b
[14,15,40,41]. Investigation of evolutionary rates
between lineages was carried out using alternative likelihood models, one with a single dN/dS ratio (M0, oneratio) [42] estimated for all branches and another that
allowed independent dN/dS ratios for each branch (FR,
free-ratio) [15]. Statistical testing of differences between
the different models [14,15,40] was carried out using
twice the log likelihood difference (2l) which conforms to
a chi-square distribution (the Likelihood Ratio test, LRT),
with the degrees of freedom based on the difference
between the number of parameters estimated from the
models. Sequences Rhox3B, Rhox3D and Rhox3G have
stop codons at intermediate positions in the coding
regions. The third nucleotide position of these codons has
been adjusted as undetermined in order to allow us to perform dN/dS analyses. The posterior p-values for estimates
of dN/dS for each codon (using model M8) are also
shown and were inferred using PAML.

To infer selection across codons within the Rhox clusters,
we also used a new method implemented in omegamap
[17] for estimating the selection parameter from a sample
of potentially recombining gene sequences. Uncertainty
in the evolutionary history was taken into account using a
coalescent-based approximate (PAC) likelihood. Variation was modelled as a block-like structure with a variable
number of blocks. We averaged over the number and
position of the blocks using reversible-jump MCMC to
obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters (specifically dN/dS in this case). We output the dN/dS value for
each codon as well as its posterior p-value. Posterior values greater than 0.95 (blue line) indicate likely codons
subject to positive selection (dN/dS > 1).
ES cell cultures
ES cells were cultured as described previously [12]. E14/T
ES cells are transgenic for polyomavirus large T and can be
supertransfected with a second plasmid containing polyoma ori. The second plasmid is maintained at high copy
number as an episome and achieves high levels of expression of the target gene [18,19]. This second plasmid contains either Rhox2 or 4 in sense or antisense orientations
on a bicistronic expression cassette driven by the CAG
promoter with puromycin resistance coupled to expression via an IRES element. E14/T were electroporated with
the expression plasmids and selected in 0.75 – 1.0 ug/ml
puromycin (Sigma) for 6 days in GMEM +LIF. To assess
the effects of withdrawal of LIF, cultures were trypsinised
and 104 cells were replated into 6 well plates in the pres-

ence of puromycin. Cultures were stained for alkaline
phosphatase (Sigma leukocyte kit) and colonies were
scored as undifferentiated (alkaline phosphatase positive), differentiated (alkaline phosphatase negative) or
mixed (partially alkaline phosphatase positive).
COS7 cell transfection
COS7 cells were plated into 6 well plates and transfected
with 2 μg of the appropriate plasmid using Fugene accordingly to manufacturers instructions (Roche). Cells were
lysed after 2 days in 2 × lameli sample buffer.
