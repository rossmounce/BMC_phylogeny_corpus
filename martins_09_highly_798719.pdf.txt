Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic fossils of
ancient retroviral integrations that remain in the genome
of many organisms. Because these remnants are present in
many related species, they have become an interesting and
useful tool to study phylogenetic relationships [1]. The
determination of the insertion time of these viruses has
been based upon the assumption that both 5' and 3' Long
Terminal Repeats (LTRs) sequences are identical at the
time of insertion, but evolve separately afterwards. Similar
approaches have been using either a constant evolutionary rate or a range of rates for these viral loci, and only single species data. These methods, however, are based on a
very general and wrong assumption: that both LTRs
evolve at the same rate [2] (figure 1). Instead, we show
that there are strong advantages in using multiple species
data and state-of-the-art phylogenetic analysis. We incorporate both simple phylogenetic information and Monte
Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods to date the insertions of these viruses based on a relaxed molecular clock
approach over a Bayesian phylogeny model and applied
them to several selected ERV sequences in primates. These
methods treat each ERV locus as having two distinct evolutionary rates for each LTR, and make use of consensual
speciation time intervals between primates to calibrate the
relaxed molecular clocks (figure 2). Our results show
strong improvements when applying simple inference
methods that take in account the obtained branch lengths
and is computationally inexpensive.

Conclusion
It is possible to get more robust and realistic integration
time estimates by incorporating multiple species data
whenever available. A more computationally expensive
approach such as the MCMC might be superior but
impractical for genome-scale annotations.
