Golgi (COG) complex in vertebrates

Abstract
Background: The Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is an eight-subunit assembly that localizes peripherally
to Golgi membranes and is involved in retrograde vesicular trafficking. COG subunits are organized in two
heterotrimeric groups, Cog2, -3, -4 and Cog5, -6, -7, linked by a dimeric group formed by Cog1 and Cog8. Dysfunction
of COG complex in humans has been associated with new forms of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG),
therefore highlighting its essential role. In the present study, we intended to gain further insights into the evolution of
COG subunits in vertebrates, using comparative analyses of all eight COG proteins.
Results: We used protein distances and dN/dS ratios as a measure of the rate of proteins evolution. The results showed
that all COG subunits are evolving under strong purifying selection, although COG1 seems to evolve faster than the
remaining proteins. In addition, we also tested the expression of COG genes in 20 human tissues, and demonstrate
their ubiquitous nature.
Conclusions: COG complex has a critical role in Golgi structure and function, which, in turn, is involved in protein
sorting and glycosylation. The results of this study suggest that COG subunits are evolutionary constrained to maintain
the interactions between each other, as well with other partners involved in vesicular trafficking, in order to preserve
both the integrity and function of the complex.
Background
Most cellular processes are carried out by multiprotein
complexes that constitute important functional units in
the cell [1]. This fact has motivated a number of studies
aiming to investigate the structure, function and evolution of such multisubunit molecular machines [e.g., [14]].
A cellular process in which protein complexes are
known to be involved is the transport of proteins between
cellular compartments (vesicular trafficking) [5,6]. Proteins synthesised in the secretory pathway are transported inside vesicles that move from the endoplasmic
reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, from where polypeptides are then sorted to several cellular compartments [7].
As progression through the Golgi occurs, proteins may
undergo modifications like glycosylation, a necessary step
for their stability and function [8]. Several large protein
complexes play an important role in the fidelity of vesicle

fusion, acting as tethering factors through the formation
of physical links between membranes prior to fusion
[5,6,9]. One of these is the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi
(COG) complex [10], which localizes at the cytoplasmic
surface of the Golgi apparatus [11-14].
Several studies have been performed demonstrating the
involvement of COG in retrograde vesicular trafficking of
Golgi resident proteins [15-18], including enzymes that
participate in glycans biosyntesis [19,20]. Consequently,
COG impairment results in abnormal Golgi morphology
(dilated cisternae and accumulation of vesicles
[10,17,21,22]) and function (glycosylation defects
[reviewed in [23] and references therein]). However, its
precise mechanism of action is not completely understood.
COG complex is composed by eight distinct subunits
[10,12,13,24-26], Cog1 to Cog8, arranged in two lobes
consisting of Cog1 to Cog4 (lobe A) and Cog5 to Cog8
(lobe B) [10]. Although several models have been
advanced refining the architecture of COG [22,27-29],
the most recent studies converge in suggesting that mammalian COG members are organized in two heterotri-

meric groups, Cog2-Cog3-Cog4 and Cog5-Cog6-Cog7,
which are linked by the dimeric group formed by Cog1
and Cog8. In particular, Cog1 associates with Cog2Cog3-Cog4, whereas Cog8 interacts with Cog5-Cog6Cog7 (Figure 1) [22,29].
Previous studies have shown the possibility that COG
components have different roles within the complex,
since mutations or deletion of individual subunits cause
sharply distinct phenotypes [25,26]. In yeast, the deletion
of any one of the four lobe A subunits causes a severe
growth defect, whilst disruption of the remaining genes
(COG5 to COG8) does not substantially interfere with
normal cell growth [25]. In mammals, COG1- and
COG2-deficient cells present several dilated cisternae
[10] and pleiotropic defects in the synthesis of N-, O- and
lipid-linked glycans [8]. A similar phenotype is observed
in COG5-deficient cells, although the alterations in glycosylation are subtle [22]. In addition, COG3 depletion
entails the accumulation of vesicles distributed throughout the cytoplasm [17]. More recently, COG dysfunction
caused by mutations in specific subunits has been associated with new forms of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) in humans [reviewed in [30,31]].
In the present study, we used a broad range of comparative sequence analyses to track the evolutionary profile of
this complex in vertebrates.

Methods
In silico orthologs retrieval

Human protein sequences corresponding to each COG
subunit (COG1-COG8) were retrieved from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [32].
These sequences were used as queries to search orthologous proteins from the reference proteins database (RefSeq) using the BLASTP algorithm [33], with an E-value
cutoff of 10-3 and using the reciprocal best-hit approach

Page 2 of 9

[34]. Alternatively, sequences were retrieved from
Ensembl genome browser [35], release 57 from March
2010, via the orthogues option. Available sequences from
the following taxa were considered in this study: mammals (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus,
Macaca mulatta, Callithrix jacchus, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Equus caballus,
Canis familiaris, Bos taurus and Monodelphis domestica),
birds (Gallus gallus and Taeniopygia guttata), reptiles
(Anolis carolinensis), amphibians (Xenopus tropicalis)
and fishes (Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes, Gasterosteus
aculeatus, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Oryzias latipes).
COG3 from G. aculeatus, COG5 from X. tropicalis and
COG6 from D. rerio were assembled based on the
genomic sequence through the comparison with the
orthologous protein from other species, and through
TBLASTN searches on ESTs database. Accession numbers are available in the additional file 1. In addition, due
to probable assembling errors, residues 82 to 124 from P.
troglodytes COG4, residues 57 to 146 and 436 to 470 from
P. pygmaeus COG7 as well as residues 493 to 522 from M.
mulatta COG7 were replaced by missing data.
Protein Distances

Protein sequences were aligned with MUSCLE [36] and
manually refined by removing sites at which all sequences
except one or two have alignment gaps. Additionally, the
initial and terminal regions of the multiple sequences
alignment had, in some cases, to be removed because
they were poorly aligned. This step was particularly
important in COG5 and COG8. The final alignments of
each group of orthologous sequences are available at
additional file 2. Protein distances were calculated using
Protdist from PHYLIP 3.69 package [37], with the JonesTaylor-Thornton (JTT) evolutionary model and gamma
distribution of rates with a fixed shape parameter of 1.
Divergence times between species were obtained with
TimeTree [38,39].
Phylogenetic analysis and dN/dS (ω) ratios

COG complex. COG is organized in two heterotrimeric subcomplexes
(Cog2 to Cog4 and Cog5 to Cog7), which are connected by a heterodimer (Cog1 and Cog8). Numbers represent COG subunits. Adapted
from [29].

To reconstruct species phylogeny, the protein-coding
sequences were aligned with ClustalW program [40]
implemented in Bioedit version 7.0.9.0 [41], using protein
alignments as template to avoid out-of-frame gaps. The
poorly aligned positions and divergent regions in each
alignment were eliminated with GBlocks program [42]
and the resulting blocks were concatenated in a single
alignment of 15195 positions. To identify the model of
nucleotide substitution that best fits the data the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) was applied, using the
jModelTest 0.1.1 [43]. The selected model (GTR +I +G)
was used to reconstruct the maximum likelihood phylogeny in Phyml 3.0 [44]. The tree was drawn with FigTree

program [45]. The resulting tree topology, but not branch
lengths, was used to fit different models in PAML.
The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous sites (dN) have been
estimated with CODEML from the PAML v.4.4 package
[46], using the F3 × 4 codon frequency model and treating alignment gaps as ambiguity characters (cleandata =
0). The input alignments were modified by removing
positions that showed evidence to represent true indels,
while keeping those that appear to be missing data.
Alignments are available in additional file 3. Several models that allow for different levels of heterogeneity in the
dN/dS ratio (ω) among lineages have been applied: the
one-ratio model that assumes the same ω ratio for all
branches in the phylogeny; the free-ratios model that
allows ω to vary on every lineage; and the two-ratio
model, which assumes that the branch of interest has an
ω value (ω1) different from the ratio of the other lineages
(ω0- background ratio). The above models can be compared using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to test different
hypothesis, as described by Yang [47]. Because synonymous sites saturation prevents comparisons of too divergent sequences, only species from humans to birds were
considered in this analysis.
Expression analyses

Expressed sequence tag (EST) profiles from several
human and murine tissue samples were extracted for
COG genes from the UniGene database [48] as EST
counts per million transcripts and were log2 transformed
(Homo sapiens: UniGene Build #223 and Mus musculus:
UniGene Build #183). A number of erroneously assigned
ESTs for human and mouse COG8 were manually
removed. For simplicity, only homologous tissues for
which information was available in both organisms were
included, resulting in a total of 29 tissues. The clusters on
the heatmaps were made by an in house tool, using correlation as the measure of similarity.
In addition, because in several tissues some COG genes
have no detectable expression (absence of EST counts),
we have further tested the presence of all COG transcripts in 20 different human tissues included in a RNA
panel obtained from Ambion (FirstChoice Human Total
RNA Survey Panel). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of
RNA using the First Strand cDNA synthesis Kit (Fermentas Life Sciences, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers specific
for COG transcripts, as well as for the positive control
GAPDH, were designed to avoid amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, either because they span an intron
or the forward primer anneals with an exon/exon boundary (additional file 4). PCR amplifications were per-

mix with 0.5 μl of cDNA in a 12.5 μl final reaction volume. Final primer concentration in the reaction was 0.4
μM. Thermocycling conditions used included pre-incubation for 15 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 90 s at 58°C, and 60 s at 72°C, with a final incubation for 10 min at 72°C. Amplification products ranged
from 100 to 253 bp and were separated by horizontal
electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gels and visualized
by silver staining. RT-PCR products from one sample
were confirmed by direct sequencing.

Results
Evolutionary Analyses

As a first measure of the rate of COG proteins evolution,
we calculated the pairwise protein distance for human
proteins and each of the 20 orthologs. These values were
plotted against the corresponding divergence times for
the compared species, and the linear regression trend line
was estimated from each group, as shown in Figure 2.
From the slope of the lines and the r2 values we are able to
compare the rate of proteins evolution and its constancy
over time, respectively. The results presented in Figure 2
show that COG1 is the subunit with the fastest rate of
evolution; COG6, COG3, COG5 and COG4 have the
lowest rates; while the remaining proteins (COG7, COG8
and COG2) have intermediate rates. Although being the
most divergent protein, COG1 (along with COG7) is the
one in which the rate of evolution has remained most
constant (r2 = 0.993).
In addition, we used a classical measure of protein evolution based on the nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous
(dS) substitutions rate ratio (dN/dS or ω).
A ω value higher than 1 can suggest that genes undergo
positive selection, while less than 1 is indicative of purifying selection [49]. Following this approach, we tested
whether ω ratios for each COG gene are different among
lineages, based on the maximum likelihood phylogeny
previously inferred (Figure 3). Therefore, a likelihood
ratio test (LRT) comparing the one-ratio model, that
assumes the same ω for all lineages, and the free-ratio
model, which assumes independent ω ratios for every
branch, was applied. The log likelihoods obtained under
each model are presented in Table 1 and indicate significant variation in ω values among lineages in all COG
genes except for COG7, suggesting relaxation of the
strong selective constraints in some lineages, yet with low
ω. The ω values for branches in the phylogeny for each
gene are available at additional file 5. It is interesting to
note that the length of the branch that leads to modern
rodents (mouse and rat) obtained for COG2 and COG6 is
very long, revealing the accumulation of many substitu-

Figure 2 Protein distances vs divergence times between human and different species. Divergence times between humans and other species
were obtained with TimeTree [38] and are as follow: Ptr: 6.13 Myr; Ppy: 15.44 Myr; Mac: 29.6 Myr; Cja: 44.2 Myr; Glires (average of Mmu, Rno and Ocu):
91 Myr; Laurasiatheria (average of Eca, Bta and Cfa): 97.4 Myr; Mdo: 176.1 Myr; Sauropsida (average of Tgu, Gga and Aca): 324.5 Myr; Xtr: 361.2 Myr;
Actinopterygii (average of Dre, Ola, Gac, Tni and Tru): 454.6 Myr. Linear regression trend lines were set to intercept the origin.

tions (additional file 5). Notwithstanding, the corresponding ω values are low, even when compared with
shorter branches represented by non-rodent species.
This suggests that rodent lineage has accumulated mainly
synonymous rather than nonsynonymous substitutions,
thus preserving the amino acid composition of the

encoded protein. In fact, when the same COG2 and
COG6 trees were drawn with branches lengths proportional to the expected nonsynonymous substitutions rate
(dN), the rodent's branch length is more similar to all the
other branches (additional file 6).
Although the ω ratio obtained under the one-ratio
model does not fit every branch in the phylogeny, it represents an average over all sites and lineages [50] and
therefore can be used to compare the strength of constraints imposed to different COG genes. As presented in
Table 1, all ω values are very low, indicating that COG
genes are evolving under strong purifying selection. The
highest ratio is observed for COG1, while the lowest
refers to COG4 and COG6.
Expression analyses in human and mouse

Figure 3 Maximum Likelihood phylogeny of the 14 species used
in the analyses with PAML. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree
was constructed based on the concatenated alignment of the eight independent protein coding sequences alignment (see methods). Tree
was midpoint rooted. Bootstrap values are shown at nodes and were
calculated from 100 replicates. This tree topology was used to fit different models in PAML.

Although several studies have been accumulating in the
last years about COG complex, particularly in what concerns to the interaction between subunits, thus far the
expression profile of different COG genes remains
uncharacterized. Therefore, as a preliminary approach to
study the expression of COG genes, tissue dependent
expression patterns have been inferred from EST profiles
accessible in UniGene database [48]. For comparative
purposes, the analysis was performed in homologous tissues in human and mouse for which expression information was available for both organisms.

Figure 4 shows the clustering of gene-expression data
for human and mouse. In general, COG genes appear to
have a ubiquitously pattern of expression, yet differences
in the level of expression can be observed. However, some
of the tissues studied (e.g. adipose tissue) have no detectable expression of specific COG genes. In order to assess
the presence of COGs transcripts in some of those and
other human tissues, we performed reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Although no quantitative inferences
could be made, using this simple methodology we were
able to detect the eight COG transcripts in 20 human tissues (Figure 5) thereby confirming their ubiquitous
nature.
It is important to recognize, however, that from EST
data and RT-PCR analysis we are not able to infer the precise pattern of expression of COG genes, revealing the
need for more reliable quantitative data.

Discussion
COG complex is essential to establish and maintain the
structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, which has
itself a key role in many cellular processes, such as protein sorting and glycosylation.
In the present study, in order to better understand the
evolution of COG subunits in vertebrates, we have
applied distinct comparative strategies, including evolutionary and expression analyses.
We demonstrate that all COG proteins are evolving
under strong evolutionary constraints, as revealed by the
low dN/dS values. This pattern of purifying selection must
reflect the critical role of COG complex for Golgi function. This is well illustrated by mutations in COG-specific
subunits, which give rise to different human diseases
belonging to the Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation
(CDG). CDGs are a genetically heterogeneous group of
disorders characterized by a deficient glycosylation of
glycoconjugates, such as proteins and lipids. Since 2004,

defects in COG1 [51], COG4 [52], COG5 [53], COG7
[19,54-56] and COG8 [57,58] have been reported.
Recently, a novel mutation in COG1 gene was detected in
two patients with a cerebrocostomandibular-like syndrome [59], showing that the impact of COG dysfunction
is far from being completely known.
Being part of a multi-subunit assembly and having such
an important functional role in cells must impose strong
constraints on the evolution of COG proteins. On one
hand, they must be constrained to maintain the structural
integrity of the complex, presumably through the conservation of the residues that are involved in the interaction
between subunits. This is expected to be true if we
assume that COG structure is maintained by the same
type of protein-protein interactions in different species.
On the other hand, additional interactions with other
functional partners (e.g. other protein related to trafficking, such as SNAREs or small GTPases [reviewed in [60]])
also need to be preserved. The study of the crystallographic structure of the C-terminal region of human
COG4 protein, for instance, showed that distinct
domains are responsible for the integration of the protein
within the complex and for its function [61]. This suggests that a large proportion of the protein sequence of
each member of COG complex must be constrained to be
evolutionarily conserved.
In fact, the low rate of evolution of COG proteins is
consistent with results from more comprehensive studies
showing that evolutionary conservation increases from
monomeric proteins to members of transient interactions
and finally to components of stable complexes (proteins
that are permanently associated with each other) [1,62].
Wong and collaborators [4] also demonstrated that as the
number of unique proteins in a complex increases, the
mean dN/dS ratio of the associated genes tends to
decrease.

To evaluate the impact of different selective forces on
COG proteins, it would be interesting to compare the
rates of substitution for interacting and non-interacting
residues, and also structural and functional domains.
Unfortunately, the structure of fragments of only two
COG subunits have been reported [61,63], hampering us
to analyze with more detail the evolution of distinct
regions of each protein.
Despite all COG proteins are evolving under strong
selective constraints, COG1 seems to be the one with the
highest rate of evolution. This subunit, together with

COG8, is the bridging subunits of the mammalian COG
complex, bringing together COG2-4 and COG5-7 subcomplexes [22,29]. Interestingly, a quite similar interaction map has been reported in the yeast complex,
although in this case only COG1 is required for the association of the two subcomplexes [28]. COG1 from
humans and COG1p from yeast share no detectable
sequence homology, as happens with COG2 and COG7
[25]. Interestingly, our results revealed that COG1 and
COG2 are also the less conserved subunits in vertebrates,
suggesting that they are evolving under more relaxed

selective constraints. The biological implication of the
higher divergence of these proteins is difficult to infer,
although we can speculate that it might be related with
distinct requirements of COG's function in different species, or with the interactions established by these proteins. The remaining COG proteins (COG3, COG4,
COG5, COG6 and COG8), in contrast, have related
homologs in human and yeast [25].
In this study we have also demonstrated that the
expression of COG genes exhibit a ubiquitous nature.
These results can be taken as a starting point for more
detailed quantitative expression studies that can bring
additional insights into COG subunits interaction and
function and, eventually, to the understanding of the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with different COG
defects.

Conclusions
In the past years several studies have been focused on the
evolution of protein complexes in terms of type of interactions, revealing that proteins in stable complexes are
more conserved than those in transient interactions and
those with no apparent interacting partners [62].
In this study, in turn, we have investigated the evolution
of different subunits belonging to the same protein complex in vertebrates. Our results showed that the eight
COG subunits seem to be conserved and evolving under
strong purifying selection, in order to maintain the integrity and function of the complex. Finally, we confirm the
ubiquitous tissue expression of the eight COG transcripts
in 20 human tissues.

synonymous substitutions) was not significantly higher than the background ratio (0.094). Moreover, the LRT comparing the two-ratio model
with and without the constraint ωEuarchontoglires ≤ 1 revealed that this ratio
was not significantly higher than 1 as well.
