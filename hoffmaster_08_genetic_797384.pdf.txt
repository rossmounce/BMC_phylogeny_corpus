Abstract
Background: Bacillus cereus is most commonly associated with foodborne illness (diarrheal and
emetic) but is also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe and fatal infections. Several
multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes have recently been developed to genotype B. cereus
and analysis has suggested a clonal or weakly clonal population structure for B. cereus and its close
relatives B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis. In this study we used MLST to determine if B. cereus isolates
associated with illnesses of varying severity (e.g., severe, systemic vs. gastrointestinal (GI) illness)
were clonal or formed clonal complexes.
Results: A retrospective analysis of 55 clinical B. cereus isolates submitted to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention between 1954 and 2004 was conducted. Clinical isolates from
severe infections (n = 27), gastrointestinal (GI) illness (n = 18), and associated isolates from food
(n = 10) were selected for analysis using MLST. The 55 isolates were diverse and comprised 38
sequence types (ST) in two distinct clades. Of the 27 isolates associated with serious illness, 13
clustered in clade 1 while 14 were in clade 2. Isolates associated with GI illness were also found
throughout clades 1 and 2, while no isolates in this study belonged to clade 3. All the isolates from
this study belonging to the clade 1/cereus III lineage were associated with severe disease while
isolates belonging to clade1/cereus II contained isolates primarily associated with severe disease
and emetic illness. Only three STs were observed more than once for epidemiologically distinct
isolates.
Conclusion: STs of clinical B. cereus isolates were phylogenetically diverse and distributed among
two of three previously described clades. Greater numbers of strains will need to be analyzed to
confirm if specific lineages or clonal complexes are more likely to contain clinical isolates or be
associated with specific illness, similar to B. anthracis and emetic B. cereus isolates.

Background
The phylogenetically related species of the Bacillus cereus
group include: B. cereus, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B.

mycoides and two recently described species, B. pseudomycoides and B. weihenstephanensis [1-4]. B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis have been the most characterized

due to their pathogenic nature. B. anthracis is the etiologic
agent of anthrax, B. thuringiensis is an insect pathogen, and
B. cereus can be associated with a variety of human infections. B. cereus is most frequently associated with food
poisoning, characterized by strains producing emetic or
diarrheal toxins. It is also an opportunistic pathogen
resulting in localized (wound, ocular, oral) and systemic
infections (bacteremia, septicemia, endocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia) especially in immunocompromised
patients [5,6]. However, although B. cereus is ubiquitous
in the environment, particularly soil, it does not generally
pose a health threat.
Systemic infection due to B. cereus can be associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. Typically the species
of Bacillus most commonly associated with serious
human illness is B. anthracis. However, pulmonary infections caused by B. cereus can be severe and fatal but have
been described predominantly in patients with significant
risk factors [7-14]. There are rare reports in the literature
of fulminating pneumonia associated with B. cereus infections in patients not known to be immune compromised
[15-18]. Interestingly, B. cereus strains have been shown to
harbor diverse plasmids which can share conserved
sequences with B. anthracis virulence plasmids pXO1 and
pXO2 [19-21], and isolates associated with a few of these
severe infections were shown to contain B. anthracis virulence genes. B. cereus G9241, an isolate associated with a
severe pneumonia case, contained a plasmid, pBCXO1,
which was 99.6% similar to the B. anthracis pXO1 virulence plasmid [17]. More recently several B. cereus isolates,
associated with fatal pneumonias in Texas, were described
that harbored B. anthracis toxin and/or capsule virulence
genes (i.e., pagA, lef, cya, and capBCA) [17,22]. G9241 and
the Texas isolates were recovered from patients who were
not obviously immunocompromised; however, all three
infections were in metal workers, an occupation that may
have affected their susceptibility to respiratory infections
[23-25].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/191

some pathogenic B. cereus isolates associated with periodontal disease and emetic gastrointestinal illness are limited to specific clonal groups [29,30]. A recent MLST study
found 30 of 48 isolates of clinical origin were associated
with clonal complexes and some groups contained strains
isolated from similar human sources [31]. In contrast, two
studies using MLST analysis on smaller numbers (n = 8
and n = 10) of B. cereus isolates from severe infections
were found to be diverse and not restricted to single clonal
groups or lineages [3,32]. In this study we used MLST to
examine the phylogenetic diversity and relatedness of 55
clinical B. cereus isolates, from a historical collection of B.
cereus recovered from 1954–2004.

Methods

The population structure of pathogenic bacteria varies
over a wide range, from strictly clonal to effectively panmictic [26]. A study of localized populations of the B.
cereus group in soil using multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) suggested frequent recombination among B. weihenstephanensis, while B. cereus and B. thuringiensis
appeared clonal [27]. Two additional MLST studies, each
using different MLST gene sets, also suggested a weakly
clonal to clonal B. cereus population structure with evolutionary changes occurring through point mutations
[4,28].

Bacterial isolates
A total of 55 strains of B. cereus associated with severe
(septicemia and pneumonia) or gastrointestinal illness
were analyzed (Table 1 and 2). The strains were selected
from over 400 Bacillus in the collection of the Special Bacteriology Reference Laboratory, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The isolates represent a diverse
collection of strains received between 1954 and 2004
from 19 states in the U.S. All isolates found in the collection associated with severe systemic human infections of
the blood or lungs were selected for this study. This
resulted in the identification of 27 isolates from 26 epidemiologically distinct infections. In addition, a convenient
sampling of 28 isolates associated with cases of GI illness
or food remnants connected to eight foodborne outbreaks
and five sporadic cases of food poisoning were included
for comparison. Foodborne isolates were generally
selected if associated with two or more clustered cases. All
strains shared common biochemical/phenotypic characteristics that are consistent with the identification of Bacillus cereus. They were motile rods with peritrichous flagella,
and hemolytic with β-hemolysis or lavender-green coloration under heavy growth indicating proteolysis. They
produced catalase, lecithinase, and reduced nitrate. They
fermented D-glucose and maltose but were variable in fermenting lactose and sucrose. There was no fermentation
of D-xlyose and D-mannitol. Production of oxidase and
urease was variable while there was no production of
indole. Toxin crystals were not detected for these isolates.
16S DNA sequencing was determined as described previously [33]. Isolates were cultured on trypticase soy agar
containing 5% sheep blood (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD) at 37°C overnight. Bacterial
genomic DNA extractions for PCR were prepared as
described previously [34]. Emetic isolates were identified
by PCR as described by Ehling-Shulz et al. [35].

While the overall population structure of the B. cereus
group is not yet clear due to limited numbers of strains
examined, data suggest that in addition to B. anthracis,

cations described previously [36]. Briefly, approximately
10 ng of DNA extracted from bacterial cultures were used
as the template in the PCR reactions with the primers
described on the B. cereus MLST website http://
www.pubmlst.org/bcereus to generate amplicons from
the seven MLST gene loci (glpF, gmk, ilvD, pta, pur, pycA
and tpi). Primers described for "Option 1" were used in
the cases of the ilvD and gmk gene primers. Amplification
products of the correct size and similar concentrations,
based on visual inspection of agarose gels, were obtained
from all 55 isolates and were then purified by using a
QiaAmp PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
The nucleotide sequences of both DNA strands of the PCR
fragments were determined using the amplification primers and the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit version
3.1 according to the manufacturer's instructions, except 3
μl of BigDye was used instead of 8 μl (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing products were sepa-

rated from unincorporated dye terminators by Centri-Sep
column purification (Princeton Separations, Adelphia,
NJ) and resolved with an Applied Biosystems model 3100
automated DNA sequencing system.
Data analysis
Sequence editing and alignment was completed using the
Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package version
10.3 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The chromatograms from
the ABI 3100 sequencer were exported, visually examined,
and assembled in SEQMERGE. The sequences of each of
the seven housekeeping genes were edited to the previously described allele lengths (between 348 and 504 bp).
These were then assigned allele numbers based on those
already described in the B. cereus MLST database http://
www.pubmlst.org/bcereus. Isolates were assigned a
sequence type (ST) on the basis of the combination of the
seven alleles. Allelic sequences differing from known alleles were assigned new allele numbers and ST and added to
the B. cereus MLST database.

The seven gene fragments from each of the 55 isolates
were concatenated and downloaded from the MLST website. To assess the relationships of the isolates in this study
with other strains, a phylogenetic tree was derived from
the aligned concatenated sequences using the neighborjoining method [37] using the Kimura 2-parameter model
[38] and 1000 step bootstrap analysis of the data using
Mega 3 [39], as described previously [36]. Simpson's
index of diversity was calculated as described by Hunter
and Gaston [40].

Results
Forty-five clinical and 10 food-associated isolates of B.
cereus were selected from over 400 Bacillus submitted to
the CDC Special Bacteriology Reference Laboratory
between 1954 and 2004 and were analyzed using MLST.

Twenty-seven strains were recovered from severe atypical
Bacillus infections in 26 patients presenting with either
pneumonia or septicemia (Table 1). Eight of these 26
cases were fatal. Twenty-eight isolates were recovered
from sporadic cases of GI illness, foodborne outbreak
investigations or associated foods. The 55 isolates represented 38 STs (Table 3), 27 of which were new to the
MLST database http://www.MLST.net. The number of
alleles per locus observed in the isolates in this study
ranged from 18–23 and averaged 19.9. The Simpson's
index of diversity was calculated using a subset of epidemiologically distinct isolates and found to be 0.989
(where 1.0 is equal to absolute discrimination).
A neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the seven
concatenated allele sequences from the isolates in this

study and selected isolates from the MLST database (Figure 1). The isolates in this study were not monophyletic
by morbidity or mortality; instead, they were distributed
among the Bacillus group clades 1 and 2 and in numerous
lineages as previously defined [28].
Clade 1
Thirteen of 27 isolates associated with severe illness
grouped in clade 1, while nine of 18 GI-associated isolates
and seven of 10 food isolates were also grouped to this
clade. Isolates associated with severe illness were found in
all three previously described Cereus lineages within clade
1. Isolates recovered from GI illness grouped in Cereus I
and II lineages, but not Cereus III.

All of the emetic B. cereus isolates were represented by two
(ST 26 and 144) of the four previously described STs of
emetic strains [41]. ST 26 was the most commonly identified ST in this and other reports [28,41]. Over half (6/9)
of the GI-associated clinical isolates and five of the seven
food isolates in clade 1 were associated with emetic GI illness (Figure 1).
Three STs (ST 102, 78 and 123) found to cluster in clade
1 did not group into described lineages [28]. The ST 78
and 123 isolates were sufficiently divergent to possibly
warrant a designation of a fourth Cereus lineage (Cereus
IV) in clade 1 (Figure 1). All three isolates of ST 78 were
associated with severe pneumonia cases, of which two

were fatal. Both isolates of ST 123 were associated with a
diarrheal disease and group with ST 78 isolates, based on
alignment of the concatenated sequences, however, these
two STs share only two of seven allele types (Table 3).
Clade 2
Fourteen of 27 isolates associated with severe illness
grouped in clade 2, while nine of 18 GI-associated isolates
and three of 10 food isolates were also grouped into this
clade. Isolates recovered from severe illness were found in
three of four previously described Cereus lineages within
clade 2, but not in the Sotto lineage [28]. Isolates associated with GI illness grouped in all four clade 2 lineages
(Figure 1). A single isolate associated with a pneumonia
case (ST 111) clustered to clade 2, but did not belong to
any of the described lineages.

Discussion
In this study we used MLST to examine the phylogenetic
diversity and relatedness of B. cereus isolates that were
associated with different clinical presentations. Allelic
diversity among the isolates in the study was examined
and the average number of alleles per locus was determined to be 19.9. Previously, Helgason et al. found an
average of 33.6 alleles per locus in 67 Bacillus isolates [4]
and Priest et al. found an average of 30.5 alleles per locus
in 105 isolates [28]. Adjusted for the number of isolates
included in the study, the allelic diversity in this study was
less than that described by Helgason and greater than the
diversity reported by Priest et al. (0.5 > this study-0.36 >
Priest-0.29). We used the Simpson's index of diversity to
measure the discriminatory power of this subtyping
method (i.e., likelihood of two isolates from epidemiologically distinct events having the same ST). The overall
discrimination index was 0.989 (where 1.0 is equal to
absolute discrimination), making MLST a very useful tool
for molecular epidemiology. However, this value is clearly
biased by the types of isolates that are included. For
instance, the discrimination would be quite poor for analysis of foodborne isolates associated with emetic disease
(for which only four STs have been observed).
Only three STs were seen more than once from epidemiologically distinct cases (ST 26, 78 and 94). ST 26 was associated with four separate emetic GI outbreaks. This was
not unexpected since ST 26 has been the most common ST
associated with emetic isolates in previous studies
[28,41]. ST 78 and ST 94 are not closely related (i.e., ST 78
is in clade 1 and ST 94 is in clade 2) however, all the isolates of these STs (n = 5) were associated with pneumonia
cases. Interestingly, all three of the ST 78 isolates were the
cause of pneumonia in metal workers (two cases were
fatal). In addition, we have previously shown all three isolates (G9241, G9898, and 03BB87) produce a capsule and
were PCR positive for pBC218 plasmid genes (putative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/191

polysaccharide polymerase and translocase genes)
hypothesized to be required for a polysaccharide capsule
production in G9241 [17,22,42]. Thus far, we have only
seen these plasmid genes in isolates of ST 78. Perhaps this
is an under sampled clonal group harboring a specific virulence plasmid similar to B. anthracis.
The clade 1/Cereus III lineage is most closely related to the
Anthracis lineage and was previously shown to include
both B. cereus and B. thuringiensis [28]. All the Cereus III
isolates analyzed for this study were associated with systemic illness. This lineage contained isolates from Texas,
including 03BB102 (ST 11) which was isolated from a
fatal case of pneumonia in a welder [22], and a ST 62 clinical isolate recovered from a septicemic patient (TX,
1975). The other isolate in this lineage, B5780, was recovered from blood and shares ST 76 with another invasive
isolate in the MLST database.
The clade 1/Cereus II lineage, which is also closely related
to the Anthracis/Cereus III lineages, contained isolates
from both systemic and GI illnesses. Nine of the 10 GIassociated isolates, recovered from both clinical specimens and food samples, in cereus II are emetic isolates
and were shown to produce a functional emetic toxin peptide or were PCR positive for the emetic genetic determinants. The single ST 26 isolate that was negative for these
emetic loci, E6345, was recovered from lung. It is possible
this isolate never had these determinants or, since they are
plasmid-borne [43], the plasmid may have been cured
prior to or during laboratory manipulations. We have limited information on the case from which E6345 originated. It is possible that the pneumonia may have resulted
from aspiration due to infection with bacteria that originally produced emetic toxin. The clade 1/Cereus II lineage
appears to contain mostly isolates associated with severe
systemic infections and emesis.
Several studies have suggested that B. cereus isolates that
cluster closely with B. anthracis are more likely to be associated with clinical cases as opposed to environmental
sources [4,44,45]. This suggests that it may be possible to
infer the virulence of a strain (i.e., pathogenic potential)
based on ST. The MLST data from this study suggests
strains associated with severe disease presentations (pneumonia, septicemia, and bacteremia) are phylogenetically
diverse within clades 1 and 2 but continue to appear
restricted to these clades and are not present in clade 3.
Thus, while clinical isolates are diverse, there may be differences in pathogenic potential at the clade level of resolution. In addition, some lineages appear to have more
clinical isolates associated with severe or emetic illness
such as the Cereus II and III lineages. Whether these or
additional lineages or clonal complexes contain isolates
primarily associated with specific diseases may become

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:191

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/191

clearer as more clinical and environmental isolates are
added to the database. Attempts to correlate ST with pathogenic potential of B. cereus are complicated by several
factors. First, the pathogenic potential of environmental
isolates is unknown. The source of an isolate (clinical versus environmental) does not necessarily correlate with
pathogenic potential. B. cereus is not an obligate pathogen, therefore, isolates like those recovered from clinical
specimens should also be found in the environment.
Studies have shown that environmental isolates of the B.
cereus group harbor a variety of B. cereus virulence genes,
such as hemolysins, enterotoxins, cytotoxin K and phospholipase C [46,47]. Host susceptibility and whether or
not B. cereus is associated with the primary infection or is
a secondary infection may also complicate efforts to segregate strains or clonal complexes by virulence or pathogenic potential.

Conclusion

3.

Clinical isolates in general are diverse and well represented throughout clades 1 and 2, while no clinical isolates have been identified in clade 3. STs of isolates
associated with severe disease were distributed throughout clades 1 and 2; however, the majority of GI isolates
within clade 1 were limited to emetic strains of B. cereus.
There was some evidence, based on limited numbers, of
isolates within lineages or clonal complexes being associated with severe disease or a specific illness such as ST 78
with pneumonia. However, further work will be needed
to clearly understand the relationship of isolates within
the clades and lineages and how they may be related to the
potential of isolates to cause a variety of illnesses. A more
robust picture of the B. cereus group is not yet realized due
to low number of sequenced isolates and biased sampling. The existence of multiple MLST schemes for the B.
cereus group (n = 5) further hampers efforts. A recent
report, however, describes the creation of a supertree database (SuperCAT) that combines and integrates data from
all the published schemes [48] which should aid in the
effort to better view the B. cereus group phylogeny. The
true population structure of B. cereus will emerge as more
diverse isolates, including clinical isolates with good epidemiological data, are analyzed and added to the public
databases.
