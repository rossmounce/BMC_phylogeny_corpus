Abstract
Background: Persistent colonization of the human stomach by Helicobacter pylori is associated
with asymptomatic gastric inflammation (gastritis) and an increased risk of duodenal ulceration,
gastric ulceration, and non-cardia gastric cancer. In previous studies, the genome sequences of H.
pylori strains from patients with gastritis or duodenal ulcer disease have been analyzed. In this study,
we analyzed the genome sequences of an H. pylori strain (98-10) isolated from a patient with gastric
cancer and an H. pylori strain (B128) isolated from a patient with gastric ulcer disease.
Results: Based on multilocus sequence typing, strain 98-10 was most closely related to H. pylori
strains of East Asian origin and strain B128 was most closely related to strains of European origin.
Strain 98-10 contained multiple features characteristic of East Asian strains, including a type s1c
vacA allele and a cagA allele encoding an EPIYA-D tyrosine phosphorylation motif. A core genome
of 1237 genes was present in all five strains for which genome sequences were available. Among
the 1237 core genes, a subset of alleles was highly divergent in the East Asian strain 98-10, encoding
proteins that exhibited <90% amino acid sequence identity compared to corresponding proteins in
the other four strains. Unique strain-specific genes were identified in each of the newly sequenced
strains, and a set of strain-specific genes was shared among H. pylori strains associated with gastric
cancer or premalignant gastric lesions.
Conclusion: These data provide insight into the diversity that exists among H. pylori strains from
diverse clinical and geographic origins. Highly divergent alleles and strain-specific genes identified in
this study may represent useful biomarkers for analyzing geographic partitioning of H. pylori and for
identifying strains capable of inducing malignant or premalignant gastric lesions.

Background
Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative spiral-shaped bacterium that persistently colonizes the human stomach [1].

Persistent H. pylori colonization of the human stomach is
a risk factor for several diseases, including non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric lymphoma, and peptic ulcerPage 1 of 14

ation [1,2]. The incidence of these diseases varies
considerably throughout the world. For example, the incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma is substantially higher in
East Asia, Central America, and South America than in
most other parts of the world [3].
H. pylori isolates from unrelated humans exhibit a high
level of genetic diversity [4,5]. Genetic variation is readily
detectable by analyzing the nucleotide sequences of individual genes in different H. pylori strains [6]. H. pylori
allelic diversity is probably the consequence of multiple
factors, including a high rate of mutation, a high rate of
intraspecies genetic recombination, and a long evolutionary history of the species [4,7]. Corresponding alleles in
different H. pylori strains typically are 92 to 99% identical
in nucleotide sequences [4,6], but several H. pylori genes
exhibit a much higher level of genetic diversity [8,9].
Further analyses have shown that there is geographic variation among H. pylori strains [10-16]. Based on multilocus sequence analysis of a panel of 370 H. pylori strains
isolated from humans in different parts of the world,
seven populations of strains with distinct geographic distributions have been identified [17]. These H. pylori populations reflect the migration of humans from Africa to
other parts of the world over a time period estimated to be
approximately 58,000 years [12]. Geographic differences
among H. pylori strains could potentially be a factor that
helps to explain the varying incidence of H. pylori-associated diseases in various parts of the world.
In addition to variation among H. pylori strains in the
sequences of individual genes, there is considerable variation among strains in gene content. One study analyzed
genomic DNA from 56 different H. pylori strains using
array hybridization methods and identified 1150 genes
that were present in all of the strains tested (thus representing a "core" genome) [18]. Among 1531 genes analyzed, 25% were absent from at least one of the 56 H.
pylori strains. It was predicted that the H. pylori core
genome would consist of 1,111 genes if a much larger set
of isolates were tested [18]. Other studies have reported
the existence of core genomes comprising 1091 or 1281
genes, based on DNA array analysis of 34 or 15 H. pylori
strains, respectively [19,20]. One study reported that the
phylogeny of H. pylori strains based on MLST analysis was
substantially different from the phylogeny of H. pylori
strains based on analysis of gene content [18].
One of the most striking differences in gene content
among H. pylori strains is the presence or absence of a 40kb region of chromosomal DNA known as the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) [8,21-24]. In the United States and
Europe, about 50–60% of H. pylori strains contain the cag
PAI and the remaining strains lack this region of the chro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/3

mosome [8,21-24]. In many other parts of the world,
including East Asia, nearly all H. pylori strains contain the
cag PAI [15,25,26]. The H. pylori cag PAI encodes an effector protein, CagA, and a type IV secretion apparatus that
translocates CagA into gastric epithelial cells [27]. H. pylori
strains harboring the cag PAI are associated with an
increased risk of non-cardia gastric cancer or peptic ulcer
disease compared to strains that lack the cag PAI [21,28].
The correlation between these diseases and presence of
the cag PAI provides an example of how the clinical outcome of H. pylori infection is determined in part by genetic
characteristics of the strains with which a person is
infected.
In previous studies, the complete genomes of three H.
pylori strains have been analyzed [29-31]. These three H.
pylori strains were isolated from patients who had gastritis,
atrophic gastritis, or duodenal ulcer disease. In the current
study, we sought to analyze genetic features of H. pylori
strains isolated from patients with two different H. pyloriassociated diseases: gastric ulcer and gastric cancer. For
this analysis, we selected a gastric ulcer strain (B128) that
readily colonizes the stomachs of mice and Mongolian
gerbils. This strain is of particular interest because an animal-passaged derivative of strain B128 (strain 7.13)
causes gastric cancer in a Mongolian gerbil model [32,33].
For an analysis of a gastric cancer-associated H. pylori
strain, we selected strain 98-10, which was isolated from a
gastric cancer patient in Japan [34], a country with a very
high incidence of gastric cancer [3,35].

Results
General features of H. pylori genomes
Prior to the current study, the complete genome
sequences of H. pylori strains isolated from patients with
superficial gastritis, atrophic gastritis, or duodenal ulcer
disease had been reported [29-31]. In the current study,
we analyzed the genome sequences of an H. pylori strain
(98-10) that was isolated from a patient with gastric cancer [34] and a strain (B128) that was isolated from a
patient with gastric ulcer disease [32]. General features of
the two genomes analyzed in the current study in comparison to three previously sequenced genomes are summarized in Table 1. To identify transposable genetic elements
that might be present in the two newly sequenced
genomes, the nucleotide sequences of each genome were
used as queries to search an insertion sequence database
http://www-is.biotoul.fr. Strain 98-10 contained ORFs
(HP9810_5g1 and HP9810_5g2) homologous to ORFs
found in IS607 (accession number AF189015) [36].
Strain B128 contained ORFs (HPB128_26g16,
HPB128_26g17, and HPB128_26g18) homologous to
ORFs found in ISHp608 (accession number AF357224),
but nucleotide insertions are predicted to disrupt the
transposase gene in strain B128 [37]. IS607 and ISHp608

distributed geographically among H. pylori strains, and
this element was reported to be more abundant in strains
from Peruvian patients with gastric cancer than in strains
from Peruvian patients with gastritis only [37].
MLST analysis of H. pylori strains
In previous studies, MLST analysis has been used to classify H. pylori isolates into several haplogroups that have
distinct geographic distributions [17]. To assign the two
newly sequenced H. pylori strains to one of the previously
described population clusters, we compared eight gene
sequences from each strain to the corresponding
sequences of 434 other H. pylori isolates, using an MLST
database as described in the Methods. Based on this analysis, strain 98-10 was classified as a member of the East
Asian population cluster and strain B128 was classified as
a member of the European population cluster. A neighbor-joining tree depicting relationships of the two newly
sequenced strains to representative reference strains isolated from diverse geographic locations is shown in Figure
1. The clustering depicted on this neighbor-joining tree
accurately reflects the geographic origins of the reference
strains, and is in agreement with previous assignments of
the reference strains to distinct population groups [18]. In
agreement with an earlier report [17], one of the previously sequenced H. pylori strains (J99) was most closely
related to strains isolated in West Africa, and another
(26695) was most closely related to strains isolated in
Europe. A third H. pylori strain (HPAG1) analyzed in a
prior study was closely related to strains isolated in

Europe. Figure 1 illustrates that strain 98-10 is most
closely related to strains of East Asian origin, and therefore, strain 98-10 belongs to a population cluster different
from those of strains for which genome sequences were
previously reported. Collectively, the genome sequences
available for analysis represent three main geographic
populations of H. pylori strains [European (26695,
HPAG1, and B128), West African (J99), and East Asian
(98-10)].
Analysis of cagA and vacA
CagA and VacA are two important H. pylori virulence factors that are secreted by a type IV secretion pathway and a
type V (autotransporter) secretion pathway, respectively
[14,38]. Diversity in cagA and vacA genes has been investigated in detail in previous studies, and diversity in these
genes provides a basis for typing H. pylori strains [8,1315]. Therefore, we analyzed the cagA and vacA genes in
each of the two newly sequenced strains.

When strain 98-10 was incubated with AGS gastric epithelial cells as described previously [39], CagA underwent
tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown), which indicates that this strain has a functional type IV secretion system for translocation of CagA into host cells [27]. The
CagA protein encoded by strain 98-10 contains 3 EPIYA
motifs (sites of tyrosine phosphorylation), which have
been designated EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and EPIYA-D [14].
The presence of an EPIYA-D motif is characteristic of H.
pylori strains isolated in East Asia [13,14]. Broth culture
supernatant from strain 98-10 caused vacuolation of HeLa
cells, indicating the presence of an active VacA toxin. This
strain contains a type s1c/m1 vacA allele, a feature that is
characteristic of H. pylori strains isolated in East Asia

Phylogenetic structure based
Phylogenetic structure based on sequence analysis of 8 H. pylori core genes. H. pylori strains analyzed in this figure
include strains 98-10, B128, three strains for which genome sequences were previously determined (26695, J99, HPAG1), and
representative strains isolated from patients in diverse geographic locations [18]. The figure lists the strain designations and the
countries where strains were isolated. The nucleotide sequences of the concatenated MLST loci were aligned and compared,
as described in Methods. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset. There were a total of
3041 positions in the final dataset. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed based on distances estimated by the Kimura 2parameter model of nucleotide substitution [57,58]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to
represent the evolutionary history of the strains analyzed [59]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in fewer than
50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The tree is drawn to scale, with the branch lengths in the same units as those of the
evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [63]. Five H. pylori
strains for which genome sequences were available are denoted by diamonds. Three main H. pylori population groups (East
Asian, European, and West African) are identifiable.

[15,40]. Identification of East Asian cagA and vacA motifs
in strain 98-10 is consistent with the results of the MLST
analysis, which classified strain 98-10 as a member of the
East Asian population cluster of H. pylori strains.

antisera indicated that this strain did not produce a detectable VacA protein, and broth culture supernatant from
this strain did not cause vacuolation of HeLa cells (data
not shown).

Similar to strain 98-10, strain B128 has a functional type
IV secretion system that can translocate CagA into gastric
epithelial cells, and CagA subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation [41]. The CagA protein encoded by
strain B128 contains two EPIYA motifs, designated EPIYAA and EPIYA-C [14]. Strain B128 contains a type s1/m2
vacA allele, but a vacA mutation in this strain is predicted
to prevent expression of a full-length VacA protein. The
presence of the latter mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis of a vacA fragment amplified by
PCR. Immunoblot analysis using multiple anti-VacA

Characterization of the H. pylori core genome
Delineation of a H. pylori core genome (i.e. genes that are
consistently present in all H. pylori isolates) is of interest,
because many such genes are likely to be required for colonization of the human stomach. Based on the use of
BLAST score ratio analysis as described in the Methods, we
identified 1237 genes that were present in all 5 H. pylori
genomes (Figure 2 and Additional file 1). In a previous
study, 56 different H. pylori strains were analyzed by array
methodology, and a core genome of 1150 genes was
reported to be present in all 56 strains [18]. Among the

the Methods. Proteins depicted within the box at the lower left corner (BSR <0.4) correspond to proteins present in the reference proteome (strain 26695) but absent from the two query proteomes. The upper right quadrant represents proteins
conserved in all three proteomes.

1150 genes reported to comprise the H. pylori core
genome based on array analysis, 1094 were present in all
5 strains analyzed in the current study, as determined by
sequence analysis. The list of core genes detected in all five
strains by sequence analysis but not by array analysis
includes >20 genes located within the cag PAI. Although
the cag PAI is present in all 5 strains analyzed in the current study, this region of DNA is known to be absent from
many H. pylori strains [24]. Five other clusters of contiguous genes (each with at least 4 genes per cluster) were
present in all 5 sequenced strains, but were absent from
the list of core genes identified by array analysis
(HP0061–0065,
HP0797–0800,
HP1339–1343,
HP1400–1403, and HP1455–1458) (Additional file 1).
The differences in designation of core genes in the current
study compared to previous studies can be attributed to
numerous factors, including differences in the number of
strains analyzed and differences in methodology for gene
detection.
An analysis of the 1237 core genes indicated that, in
almost all cases, there were differences in the amino acid
sequences of the proteins encoded by individual strains.
Pairwise comparisons of proteins encoded by different
strains indicated that the levels of relatedness ranged from
65% to 100% amino acid identity. A representative comparison of the core proteins encoded by two strains (9810 and 26695) is shown in Figure 3. Only 11 genes were
identified for which the amino acid sequences of encoded
proteins were identical among all 5 strains. Seven of these
11 genes encoded ribosomal proteins; others encoded a
translation initiation factor (IF-1), a lipoprotein (Lpp20),
a flagellar basal body protein (FliE), and a protein of
unknown function (HP0031).
Analysis of divergent genes in an East Asian cancerassociated H. pylori strain
H. pylori strains isolated from unrelated humans exhibit
allelic diversity (typically 92–99% nucleotide identity
among corresponding alleles), which provides a basis for
classification of strains into population clusters via MLST
analysis. Several genes exhibit a substantially higher level
of allelic diversity. For example, at least two genes (cagA
and a sel1 homologue) are known to be markedly divergent in East Asian H. pylori strains compared to Western H.
pylori strains [13,14,42]. We hypothesized that additional
genes might be highly divergent in the East Asian strain
98-10 compared to the other 4 sequenced strains. To identify gene products encoded by the genome of 98-10 that
are markedly divergent compared to products encoded by
the other 4 genomes, we focused on analysis of the 1237
core genes that were present in all 5 sequenced strains. By
using the approach described in Methods, we identified 8
gene products that were highly divergent in the East Asian
strain compared to the other four strains (Table 2). These

the Methods. The deduced amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins encoded by strain 98-10 were used to
search a database of sequences from strain 26695 using
FastA. The best match was identified, and the percent amino
acid identity was calculated. The histogram shows the

include CagA and a sel1 homologue, which were previously reported to be markedly divergent in East Asian
strains compared to strains from other parts of the world
[13,42]. The amino acid sequences of these divergent proteins encoded by the Japanese strain 98-10 were each
<90% identical to sequences of corresponding proteins
from the other four strains (Table 2). In each case, the
divergent alleles in strain 98-10 and corresponding alleles
in the other four strains were flanked by the same chromosomal genes.
As shown in Figure 1, strain J99 was most closely related
to H. pylori strains isolated in West Africa, a population
cluster different from those of the other strains for which
genome sequences were available. Therefore, we hypothesized that specific genes might be highly divergent in the
West African strain J99 compared to the other 4
sequenced strains. To identify such genes, we used the
same approach as described above. Four unique highly
divergent alleles were identified in strain J99 (Table 3),
each encoding products that were <90% identical to cor-

responding proteins in the other four strains. Unique
highly divergent alleles were not readily identifiable in
strains 26695, HPAG1, or B128. A notable exception was
the identification of a highly divergent vacA allele in strain
B128 (gene HPB128_147g10). Identification of vacA as a
divergent allele in strain B128 is attributable to the presence of an s1/m2 vacA allele in this strain and the presence
of s1/m1 alleles in the four other strains; m1 and m2
forms of VacA typically exhibit only 60–70% amino acid
identity within the mid-region of the protein [38].
Identification of novel strain-specific genes
To identify strain-specific genes uniquely present in one of
the two newly sequenced genomes but not previously
sequenced H. pylori genomes, we again used a BLAST score
ratio analysis, as described in the Methods (Figure 2).
Strain 98-10 contained 22 novel strain-specific genes and
strain B128 contained 51 (Additional files 2 and 3). In
addition, we identified 16 genes that were present in both
strain 98-10 and B128, but not present in any of the previously sequenced strains (Additional file 4). Several of

the strain-specific ORFs in H. pylori strains 98-10 and
B128 were <100 nucleotides in length, and it is uncertain
whether or not these very short ORFs are actually translated into proteins. An analysis of unique strain specific
genes in the three previously sequenced H. pylori genomes
(26695, J99, and HPAG1) revealed a similar number of
unique strain-specific genes (Table 1), which have been
described in previous studies [29-31].
To identify potential functions of the strain-specific genes
found solely in strain 98-10 or B128 (or both 98-10 and
B128), the deduced protein sequences were used as queries for BLAST searching of an NCBI database of nonredundant protein sequences (Table 4 and Additional files
2, 3, 4). Most of the strain-specific proteins found solely
in strain 98-10 or B128 were not closely related to any
known proteins or were related to proteins in the database
for which the functions are not known. Several of the
strain-specific genes found exclusively in strain 98-10 or
B128 have been previously detected in strains of H. pylori
for which the genome sequences have not been deter-

mined. As described above, insertion sequences and transposase-encoding genes (IS607 and ISHp608) were
identified. Two strain-specific genes in H. pylori strain
B128 (HPB128_11g15 and HPB128_11g23) encoded
proteins related to type IV secretion system components
(VirB9 and VirD4, respectively). The genes in this cluster
(spanning HPB128_11g15 to HPB128_11g23) were not
detected in the original genomic analyses of strains J99,
26695, or HPAG1 [29-31], but were subsequently
detected in strain J99 and several other H. pylori strains
[43].
Interestingly, strain B128 contains several genes
(HPB128_155g19, HPB128_156g11, HPB128_156g12,
HPB128_184g1, HPB128_190g1) predicted to encode
proteins that are more closely related to proteins encoded
by H. acinonychis (a Helicobacter species isolated from large
cats) [44] or H. cetorum (a Helicobacter species isolated
from sea mammals) [45] than to any previously reported
H. pylori protein sequences (Additional file 3). Similarly,
strain 98-10 contains a gene (HP9810_5g6) predicted to
encode a protein more closely related to a protein
encoded by H. cetorum than to any previously reported H.
pylori protein sequences (Additional file 2).
Subsets of the strain-specific genes found exclusively in
strain 98-10 or B128 were found in contiguous chromosomal loci (Table 4). Two such gene clusters were identified in strain 98-10 and 11 were identified in strain B128.
These gene clusters ranged from two to nine genes in
length. Most of the gene clusters encode proteins of
unknown function, but as noted above, one cluster
encoded transposases and one cluster encoded two genes
with homology to type IV secretion system components.
The % G+C contents of three gene clusters in strain B128
(containing ORFs HPB128_65g16, HPB128_65g17,
HPB128_156g11, HPB128_156g12, HPB128_192g1,
HPB128_192g2, and HPB128_192g3, encoding proteins

of unknown function) were each <30%, a value substantially lower than the total % G+C content of strain B128
(38.8%) and lower than the % G+C content of previously
analyzed H. pylori strains (39%) [29,30]. The low % G+C
content of these gene clusters suggests that these segments
of DNA may have been acquired via horizontal transfer
events.
Strain-specific genes present in strains associated with
gastric cancer or premalignant gastric lesions
Atrophic gastritis is a premalignant lesion [3], and H.
pylori-infected patients with gastric ulcer disease have an
increased risk of gastric cancer compared to H. pyloriinfected patients with duodenal ulcer disease [46,47].
Strain 98-10 was isolated from a patient with gastric cancer, and strains HPAG1 and B128 were isolated from
patients with atrophic gastritis and gastric ulcer disease,
respectively. Therefore, we sought to identify strain-specific genes present in these three strains, but absent from
the other two strains for which genome sequences were
available (strains 26695 and J99, isolated from patients
with superficial gastritis and duodenal ulcer disease,
respectively). Ten strain-specific genes were found in the
former 3 strains but were absent from strains 26695 and
J99 (Table 5 and Additional file 5). These included 5 genes
encoding restriction-modification systems and a gene predicted to encode an outer membrane protein; a previous
study reported marked strain-specific variation in the size
and sequence of this outer membrane protein [48]. We
also performed a similar analysis to identify strain-specific
genes present in various pairs of strains associated with
malignant or premalignant conditions, but absent from
strains 26695 and J99 (Table 5 and Additional files 4, 6,
7). The most commonly identified genes in these groups
encoded restriction-modification systems or hypothetical
proteins (Table 5 and Additional files 4, 6, 7). One of the
genes in strains B128 and HPAG1 (hrgA) is a restriction
endonuclease-replacing gene that was previously reported

to be more prevalent among strains from Asian gastric
cancer patients than among strains from non-cancer
patients [49]. Three strain-specific genes found in strain
B128 and strain HPAG1 (HPB128_146g1,
HPB128_146g2, and HPB128_146g3) were previously
reported to be localized on a plasmid in strain HPAG1
[31]. Another gene found exclusively in strain B128 and
HPAG1 (HPB128_141g11) is found at the 3' end of the
cag PAI in some H. pylori strains, and encodes a protein of
unknown function (designated HP0521B) [50]. Strainspecific genes shared by 26695 and J99 (associated with
superficial gastritis and duodenal ulcer disease), but not
present in the three strains from patients with gastric cancer or premalignant gastric lesions are listed in Additional
file 8.

Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the genome sequences of an H.
pylori strain isolated from a patient with gastric cancer and
an H. pylori strain from a patient with gastric ulcer disease,
and compared these with previously determined genome
sequences of H. pylori strains associated with superficial
gastritis, atrophic gastritis, and duodenal ulcer disease. We
identified 1237 genes that were present in all 5 of these H.
pylori strains. This group of genes may be considered to
represent the H. pylori core genome. Some of the genes
within the core genome are predicted to be essential for H.
pylori viability in vitro. One previous study identified 33
genes that were essential for H. pylori viability [51]; all of
these essential genes were present in the list of 1237 core
genes identified in the current study. Other genes in the H.
pylori core genome are not required for bacterial viability
in vitro, but are predicted to be essential for H. pylori colonization of the stomach. Among 47 genes essential for H.
pylori colonization of a gerbil model [52], 45 were
included in the core genome described in the current
study. Similarly, among 23 genes essential for H. pylori
colonization of a mouse model (based on detection of a
colonization defect in two different H. pylori strains) [53],
19 were included in the core genome described in the current study.

Several previous studies used array-based methodology to
identify genes that are consistently present in all H. pylori
strains analyzed [18-20]. The core genomes described in
these previous studies have ranged from 1091 genes to
1281 genes. Potential reasons for differences in the
reported size of the H. pylori core genome include variations in the number and choice of H. pylori strains selected
for analysis, as well as variation in the DNA sequences that
were used for array synthesis. In comparison to arraybased methods, genome sequence analysis offers several
potential advantages for delineation of a core genome. For
example, genome sequence analysis is likely to be superior to array-based assays when differentiating between
closely related paralogues, and genome sequence analysis
is more likely to be successful in detecting the existence of
highly divergent alleles. The main limitation of the
sequence-based approach used in the current study for
delineation of a core genome is that a relatively small
number of genomes was analyzed. Nevertheless, there was
reasonably close agreement between the core genes identified in the current study and the core genes identified in
a previous array study [18].
Analysis of the 1237 core genes identified in this study
revealed that the nucleotide sequences of these genes in
individual strains were typically non-identical, and were
differentiated by the presence of both synonymous and
non-synonymous substitutions. As expected, allelic variation was detected within several housekeeping genes that
have previously been used for MLST analysis. MLST analysis indicated that one of the strains analyzed in this study
(98-10) belonged to an East Asian population cluster of
H. pylori strains, whereas the other strains for which
genome sequences were available belonged to European
or West African population clusters. Thus, strain 98-10 is
the first H. pylori strain from an East Asian population
cluster to be analyzed by genome sequence analysis. We
then focused on the identification of core genes in strain
98-10 that encoded proteins that were highly divergent
compared to proteins encoded by the other 4 strains for
which genome sequences were available. Eight such genes
were identified (Table 2). Two of the genes shown in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/3

Table 2 (cagA and a sel1 homologue) have previously been
reported to be highly divergent in East Asian strains compared to Western strains [13,42]. We speculate that several
of the other genes listed in Table 2 may exhibit similar patterns of geographic divergence. Potentially the observed
high level of divergence is associated with alterations in
the functional activities of these proteins. The approach
used in the current study prioritized identification of alleles that were highly divergent in one strain but similar in
length compared to alleles in four other strains. A larger
number of highly divergent alleles would have been identified if genes with substantial variations in length were
included.

Conclusion

We identified several strain-specific genes in strain 98-10
or strain B128 that had not been previously described.
Many of the new strain-specific genes identified in the current study were not closely related to any genes in the
databases or were related to proteins for which the functions are not known. Notably, several of the new strainspecific genes identified in this study were closely related
to genes present in related Helicobacter species, such as H.
acinonychis [44] and H. cetorum [45].

Methods

Three of the strains for which genome sequences were
available were isolated from patients with gastric cancer
(98-10) or premalignant gastric lesions (atrophic gastritis
and gastric ulcer; HPAG1 and B128). Therefore, we sought
to identify genes present in these strains that were absent
from strains isolated from patients with non-malignant
conditions. We identified numerous genes that fulfilled
these criteria (Table 5). Potentially several of these may be
useful biomarkers for strains capable of inducing malignant or premalignant gastric lesions. Further studies
involving larger numbers of strains will be needed in
order to test this hypothesis.
Finally, it is notable that one of the strains selected for
analysis in the current study (strain 98-10) was isolated
from a gastric cancer patient in Japan, a country with a
very high incidence of gastric cancer [3,35]. The biological
basis for geographic variation in the incidence of gastric
cancer is not yet clearly understood. Both environmental
factors (such as a high-salt diet) and host genetic factors
may be contributory [2,3]. In addition, H. pylori strains
circulating in some parts of the world may have an
increased carcinogenic potential compared to strains circulating in other parts of the world. In support of the latter
hypothesis, most H. pylori strains isolated in Japan express
forms of CagA that have multiple sites where tyrosine
phosphorylation can occur and a unique tyrosine phosphorylation site (EPIYA-D), resulting in high levels of
tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA within gastric epithelial
cells and potent activation of the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase [13,14,25]. In future studies, it will be important

to study further the geographic variations that exist among
H. pylori genomes by analyzing a larger number of strains,
and to determine whether the presence of particular allelic
variations or strain-specific genes correlates with specific
disease outcomes such as gastric cancer.

In this study we analyzed the genome sequences of an H.
pylori strain isolated from a patient with gastric cancer and
a strain isolated from a patient with gastric ulcer disease.
Each strain contained novel genes not present in previously described H. pylori genomes. In addition, highly
divergent alleles were identified. Comparative analysis of
H. pylori strains isolated from patients with different clinical conditions provides a foundation for understanding
why H. pylori may be associated with a variety of different
gastroduodenal diseases.

H. pylori strains
H. pylori strain 98-10 was isolated from a patient in Japan
with gastric adenocarcinoma [34]. H. pylori strain B128
was isolated from a patient in the United States with a gastric ulcer [32]. The genome sequences of H. pylori strains
26695, J99, and HPAG1 have been published previously
[29-31]. Strain 26695 was isolated from a patient in the
United Kingdom with gastritis [29]. Strain J99 was isolated from a patient in the United States with duodenal
ulcer disease [30]. Strain HPAG1 was isolated from a
patient in Sweden with chronic atrophic gastritis [31].
Genome sequencing
A single colony of H. pylori 98-10 and a single colony of
strain B128 were isolated and DNA was purified as
described previously [54]. DNA sequencing was accomplished using an emulsion method for DNA amplification, and an instrument (Genome Sequence 20 System)
that performs pyrophosphate-based sequencing (pyrosequencing) in picolitre-sized wells (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT). Random libraries of DNA fragments were
generated by shearing an entire genome and isolating single DNA molecules by limiting dilution. Specialized common adapters were added to the fragments, the individual
fragments were captured on their own beads and, within
the droplets of an emulsion, the individual fragments
were clonally amplified [55]. This approach does not
require subcloning in bacteria or the handling of individual clones, as the templates were handled in bulk within
the emulsions. Three runs of the sequencing instrument
were used for analysis of strain 98-10 and two instrument
runs were used for analysis of strain B128. Assembly of
sequence data was performed as described by Margulies et
al. [55]. The average depth of sequencing coverage was
approximately 20-fold. Sequence data from strain 98-10
were assembled into 51 large contigs, each > 600 nucle-

otides in size (average contig length 30,819 nucleotides).
Sequence data from strain B128 were assembled into 73
large contigs, each > 600 nucleotides in size (average contig length 22,592 nucleotides). As described by Oh et al.
[31], analysis of an H. pylori genome via this approach
yields results comparable to results obtained by traditional Sanger sequencing.
Analysis of sequence data
ORFs in the genomes of H. pylori strains 98-10 and B128
were
predicted
by
FGENESB
http://
www.softberry.coberry.phtml?topic=fgenesb&group=pro
grams&sub group=gfindb[56], an algorithm based on
Markov chain models of coding regions and translation
and termination sites that was "trained" on the genome
from H. pylori strain 26695.
Multi-locus sequence typing
To analyze relationships between the strains analyzed in
this study and other globally distributed H. pylori patient
isolates, we used a multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
database http://pubmlst.org/helicobacter containing data
on 434 H. pylori strains that were isolated from patients in
a broad range of geographic locations. This MLST database contains sequence data (398 to 627 bp per gene) for
eight core genes (atpA, efp, mutY, ppa, trpC, ureI, vacA, and
yphC) that are distributed throughout the H. pylori
genome. Nucleotide sequences of the concatenated MLST
loci were aligned using ClustalW algorithm within
MEGA4. Phylogenetic relationships were constructed
using MEGA4 with the Kimura 2-parameter model of
nucleotide substitution and neighbor-joining clustering
[57,58]. The tree shown in Figure 1 is the product of 1000
bootstrap replicates [59].
Identification of strain-specific genes and core genes
To identify strain-specific genes and genes present in all 5
H. pylori genomes analyzed in the current study, we used
a BLAST score ratio (BSR) algorithm [60]. This algorithm
is based on an analysis of BLAST raw scores, which, in contrast to comparison to analysis of BLAST output E-values,
more accurately accounts for the length of the similarity
between the Reference and Query sequences. As a first
step, ORFs were translated into deduced amino acid
sequences. BLAST score ratios were computed by first
determining the BLAST raw score for each Reference peptide against itself; this raw score was designated as the Reference score. Each Reference peptide was then compared
to each peptide in individual query proteomes, and each
best BLAST raw score was recorded. The BSR was calculated by dividing the Query score by the Reference score
for each Reference peptide. Thus, all BSRs were normalized within a range between 0 and 1. A score of 1 indicates
a perfect match of the Reference peptide to a Query peptide and a score of 0 indicates no BLAST match of the Ref-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/3

erence peptide in the Query proteome. To identify strainspecific genes, multiple separate analyses were performed,
each using a different strain as the reference. A BSR threshold value of 0.4 was used for identification of strain-specific genes. This stringent threshold value corresponds to
approximately 30% amino acid identity over approximately 30% of the peptide length, a commonly used
threshold for peptide similarity [60]. The same analytical
approach was used to identify core genes that were present
in all 5 strains for which genome sequences were available.
Identification and analysis of alleles encoding highly
divergent gene products
Among the core genes that were identified in all five H.
pylori strains (BSR >0.4), we sought to identify alleles
found in a single strain that differed markedly from corresponding alleles found in the other four strains. Candidate divergent alleles in a particular strain were initially
identified by selecting peptides having a 0.4<BSR<0.9 in
multiple analyses, each using a different strain as the reference. Deduced amino acid sequences from the 5 strains
were aligned and compared using the NWay Comp program [61]. Alignments were manually inspected to
exclude cases in which low BSRs were primarily attributable to differences in peptide length. Each gene product of
interest from strain A was compared with corresponding
gene products from strains B, C, D, and E, and a mean %
amino acid identity value was calculated; similarly, the
gene products in strains B, C, D, and E were compared in
all permutations, and a mean % amino acid identity value
was calculated. A gene from strain A was considered
highly divergent if the former value was significantly
lower than the latter value.
