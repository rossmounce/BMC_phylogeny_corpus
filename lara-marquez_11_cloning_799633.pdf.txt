Abstract
Background: Microorganisms produce cell-wall-degrading enzymes as part of their strategies for plant invasion/
nutrition. Among these, pectin lyases (PNLs) catalyze the depolymerization of esterified pectin by a b-elimination
mechanism. PNLs are grouped together with pectate lyases (PL) in Family 1 of the polysaccharide lyases, as they
share a conserved structure in a parallel b-helix. The best-characterized fungal pectin lyases are obtained from
saprophytic/opportunistic fungi in the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium and from some pathogens such as
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.
The organism used in the present study, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, is a phytopathogenic fungus that can be
subdivided into different physiological races with different capacities to infect its host, Phaseolus vulgaris. These
include the non-pathogenic and pathogenic strains known as races 0 and 1472, respectively.
Results: Here we report the isolation and sequence analysis of the Clpnl2 gene, which encodes the pectin lyase 2
of C. lindemuthianum, and its expression in pathogenic and non-pathogenic races of C. lindemuthianum grown on
different carbon sources. In addition, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence
of Clpnl2 based on reported sequences of PNLs from other sources and compared the three-dimensional structure
of Clpnl2, as predicted by homology modeling, with those of other organisms. Both analyses revealed an early
separation of bacterial pectin lyases from those found in fungi and oomycetes. Furthermore, two groups could be
distinguished among the enzymes from fungi and oomycetes: one comprising enzymes from mostly saprophytic/
opportunistic fungi and the other formed mainly by enzymes from pathogenic fungi and oomycetes. Clpnl2 was
found in the latter group and was grouped together with the pectin lyase from C. gloeosporioides.
Conclusions: The Clpnl2 gene of C. lindemuthianum shares the characteristic elements of genes coding for pectin
lyases. A time-course analysis revealed significant differences between the two fungal races in terms of the
expression of Clpnl2 encoding for pectin lyase 2. According to the results, pectin lyases from bacteria and fungi
separated early during evolution. Likewise, the enzymes from fungi and oomycetes diverged in accordance with
their differing lifestyles. It is possible that the diversity and nature of the assimilatory carbon substrates processed
by these organisms played a determinant role in this phenomenon.

Background
Pectin is one of the major components of the primary cell
wall of plants and is also found in dividing cells and in the
areas of contact between cells that have a secondary cell
wall, including xylem and the fibrous cells of woody tissue.
Pectin comprises approximately 35% of the primary cell
wall of dicots and non-graminaceous monocots. Although
its content in secondary walls is greatly reduced, it is
believed that pectin plays an important role in the structure and function of both primary and secondary cell
walls. The functions of pectin in cell walls are diverse and
include plant growth and development, morphogenesis,
defense, cell adhesion, cell wall structure, cellular expansion, porosity, ion binding, hydration of seeds, leaf abscission and fruit development, among others [1,2]. In
general, pectin is considered to be a group of polysaccharides that are rich in galacturonic acid (GalA) and present
in the form of covalently linked structural domains: homogalacturonan (HG), xylogalacturonan (XGA), rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II)
[1,2]. The main enzymes involved in the degradation of
the HG backbone of pectin are polygalacturonases (PGA,
E.C. 3.2.1.15 and XPG, E.C. 3.2.1.67), pectate lyases (PL, E.
C. 4.2.2.9 and 4.2.2.2) and pectin lyases (PNL, E.C.
4.2.2.10) [3].
Pectin lyases (PNLs) catalyze the degradation of pectin
through b-elimination; they remove a proton and generate
an unsaturated bond between the C-4 and C-5 carbons of
the non-reducing end of pectin, which is a neutral form of
pectate in which the uronic acid moiety of galacturonic
residues has been methyl-esterified. The activity of PNLs
is highly dependent on the distribution of the methyl
esters over the homogalacturonan backbone. PNLs exhibit
pH optima in the range of 6.0-8.5 and, unlike PLs, their
activity is independent of Ca2+ ions; it is believed, however,
that the residue Arg236 plays a role similar to that of Ca+2
[4,5]. Pectinase gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the pH of the medium and by carbon
sources, as it is induced by pectin and pectic components
and repressed by glucose [6-8].
PNLs are grouped into Family 1 of the polysaccharide
lyases [9] and into the pectate lyase superfamily that, in
addition to pectin lyases and pectate lyases, also includes
plant pollen/style proteins. The three-dimensional structures of five members of the pectate lyase superfamily
have been determined. These include Erwinia chrysanthemi pectate lyase C (PELC) [10] and pectate lyase E
(PELE) [11], Bacillus subtilis pectate lyase [12] and Aspergillus niger pectin lyase A (PLA) [13] and pectin lyase B
(PLB) [14]. These enzymes fold into a parallel b-helix,
which is a topology in which parallel b-strands are wound
into a large right-handed coil [15]. Although PLs and
PNLs exhibit a similar structural architecture and related

Page 2 of 14

catalysis mechanisms, they nonetheless diverge significantly in their carbohydrate binding strategy [4,13].
Currently, strategies are available for developing functional
information from three-dimensional images of enzymes.
The growing number of databases on the structure of pectinolytic enzymes has facilitated the analysis of minor
structural differences that are responsible for the specific
recognition of a unique oligosaccharide sequence in a heterogeneous mixture [4].
Most of the available information about fungal PNLs
and their corresponding encoding genes has been
obtained from saprophytic/opportunistic fungi such as
Aspergillus niger [16-19], A. orizae [20,21], A. fumigatus
[22], Penicillium griseoroseum [23], P. occitanis [24] and
to a lesser extent from the phytopathogenic fungi Glomerella cingulata [25] and C. gloeosporioides [26].
The ascomycete C. lindemuthianum is an economically important phytopathogen, and along with its host
Phaseolus vulgaris, it provides a convenient model to
study the physiological and molecular bases of plantpathogen interactions [27]. It is an intracellular hemibiotrophic pathogen with physiological races that invade
the plant in an interaction consistent to the gene-forgene model [28], and monogenic dominant resistance in
common bean cultivars leads to the appearance of localized necrotic spots typical of the hypersensitive
response (HR) [29]. After penetration of a host epidermal cell in a susceptible cultivar, the pathogenic races of
C. lindemuthianum develop an infection vesicle and
extend into adjacent cells by producing large primary
hyphae, which invaginate without penetrating the host
cell membrane and thus persist as a biotrophic interaction. Once a large area of the plant tissue has been colonized, necrotrophic hyphae develop [29], and this step
closely correlates with the production of a number of
host cell-wall-degrading enzymes that are characteristic
of phytopathogenic fungi [30-32]. Up to know, race 0 is
the only strain of C. lindemuthianum unable to infect P.
vulgaris, which contrasts with 1472, one of the most
virulent races isolated in México [33]. This difference
makes the two races an excellent model to investigate
the role of pectinolytic enzymes in virulence of C. lindemuthianum. Previous results from this laboratory
revealed significant differences between pathogenic
(1472) and non-pathogenic (0) races of C. lindemuthianum in terms of growth and production of extracellular
PNL activity on different carbon and nitrogen sources in
liquid culture. Accordingly, race 1472 grew faster in
media containing glucose or polygalacturonic acid, and
on 92%-esterified pectin, it produced levels of PNL
activity that were approximately 2-fold higher than
those produced by race 0. In contrast, cell walls isolated
from P. vulgaris hypocotyls and, to a lesser degree, from

cellulose sustained the growth of both races but induced
PNL only in the pathogenic race [34].
Here we report the isolation and sequence analysis of
the Clpnl2 gene, which encodes pectin lyase 2 of C. lindemuthianum, and its expression in pathogenic and nonpathogenic races of C. lindemuthianum in response to cultivation on different carbon sources. To determine the relationship among the three-dimensional structures of PNLs
and the lifestyle of PNL-producing microorganisms, we
performed a phylogenetic analysis using protein sequences
and deduced amino acid sequences reported for PNLs. A
comparative analysis of the three-dimensional structure of
the Clpnl2 protein predicted by homology modeling, covering the main body of the protein and the carbohydrate
binding site, and the three-dimensional structures of the
PNLs used in the phylogenetic analysis was also performed.

Methods
Strain and culture conditions

C. lindemuthianum races 0 (non-pathogenic) and 1472
(pathogenic) were kindly provided by Dr. June Simpson
(CINVESTAV-IPN, Unidad Irapuato, México) and maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA, Difco) at 20°C. For
DNA extraction, mycelia from C. lindemuthianum race
1472 grown on potato dextrose (PD) for 9 days at 20°C
with continuous shaking (150 rpm), was recovered by
filtration through Whatman paper No. 1 and stored at
-85°C. For induction, 1.6 mg (about 5 cm2 ) of mycelia
from races 0 and 1472 were inoculated in 250 ml-Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of PD medium and shaken
(150 rpm) at 20°C. After 9 days, mycelia was collected by
filtration, washed with water and transferred to 250 mlErlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of modified Mathur’s
medium (10 mM MgSO4.7H2O, 20 mM KH2PO4, 36 mM
L-glutamic acid, distilled water up to 1 L; final pH, 5.5)
[35] supplemented with either 2.5% glucose, 92%-esterified
pectin or cell walls from P. vulgaris. Flasks were shaken
(150 rpm) at 20°C and after different periods of growth,
mycelia was collected by filtration, washed with water and
stored at -85°C until use.
Preparation of plant cell walls

Seedlings of P. vulgaris cv. Flor de Mayo were grown for
7 days, and cell walls were extracted and purified from
hypocotyls as described elsewhere [36].
DNA and RNA isolation

Genomic DNA was isolated from C. lindemuthianum
mycelia that had been grown for 9 days in PD medium
according to standard protocols [37]. Total RNA was purified from mycelia using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA
samples were treated with DNAse I according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen) to eliminate DNA. The
quality and concentration of total RNA were verified using

Page 3 of 14

the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (2100 Agilent
Bioanalyzer).
Isolation of the homologous DNA Clpnl2 probe from
C. lindemuthianum

Genomic DNA from race 1472 was amplified by PCR
using the upstream primer pnlD (5’-CAGTACGTCTG
GGGTGGTGA-3’) and downstream primer pnlR (5’AAGTAGTTGTTGACGACGTGG-3’, which are homologous to sequences between 595 and 614 nt and 891 and
911 nt, respectively, of exon 3 of the Clpnl2 gene from
C. gloeosporioides [GenBank: AAD43565]. The PCR incubation mixture was heated at 95°C for 5 min in a thermocycler (Eppendorf Master Cycler Gradient, Brinkmann,
Westbury, NY), followed by denaturation for 1 min at
95°C, annealing for 2 min at 48°C and extension for 2 min
at 72°C. PCR was then performed for 35 cycles, followed
by a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. A PCR product
of 383 bp corresponding to pnl2 gene (clpnl2 fragment)
was ligated into the pCR 2.1 vector and introduced into
E. coli TOP 10 strain from the TOPO TA Cloning kit
(Invitrogen).
Genomic DNA library construction and screening

Partial Sau3AI digestion of genomic DNA from race 1472
was used to construct a genomic library in Lambda DASH
II/BamHI according to manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene). Screening was performed using 15 × 10 4 UFP
with three rounds of hybridization filters and the homologous Clpnl2 fragment, which was 32P-radiolabeled using
the Radprime DNA Labeling System Life Technologies Kit
(Tech-Line).
Molecular cloning of the Clpnl2 full-length cDNA and
expression analyses

The cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR as specified by the
manufacturer. SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) was used to prepare cDNA
from total RNA. PCR was performed using the upstream
primer Pnl67 (5’-ATGAAGTCTACCATCTTCTCCG-3’)
and downstream primer Pnl1569 (5’-TTAGATCTTGCGAAACCGGC-3’) designed from the DNA Clpnl2 genomic sequence of C. lindemuthianum. The PCR incubation
mixture was heated at 94°C for 5 min in a thermocycler
(Eppendorf Master Cycler Gradient, Brinkmann, Westbury, NY), followed by 30 cycles of denaturation for 20 sec
at 94°C, annealing for 30 sec at 54°C, extension for
1.5 min at 72°C and then by a final extension for 7 min at
72°C. A PCR product of 1,140 bp obtained from total
RNA of race 1472 induced with pectin for 4 h and corresponding to the Clpnl2 gene, was ligated into the pCR 2.1
vector (Invitrogen) and three clones were selected and
sequenced. The 5’ end of cDNA was amplified by 5’RACE
as specified by the manufacturer (5’RACE System for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/260

Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Invitrogen), with total
RNA from race 1472 induced for 4 h with 92%-esterified
pectin, using the specific reverse primers Pnl1249 (5’-GTA
GTT GTT GAC GAC GTG GAC G-3’) and Pnl975 (5’CGA TGT GCT GGC GGC CG-3’). The amplification
products were cloned and five clones were selected and
sequenced. For expression analysis, total cDNA (1140 pb)
was amplified with specific primers Pnl67 and Pnl1569 in
the same conditions described above using total RNA of
mycelia from both races induced with 92%-esterified pectin or cell walls from P. vulgaris for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h.
For expression analysis, cDNA obtained from cells grown
under different conditions was also amplified by PCR
using oligonucleotides prepared from ribosomal 18S RNA
as a control (5’- TTAGCATGGAATAATRRAATAGGA3’and 5’-ATTGCAATGCYCTATCCCCA-3) [38]. The
PCR incubation mixture was heated at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94°C,
annealing for 1 min at 56°C, extension for 1 min at 72°C
and then a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. The cDNA
of Clpnl2 and the amplified RT-PCR products were analyzed in a Bioanalyzer using the system for quantification
and molecular size Agilent DNA 7500 (2100 Agilent
Bioanalyzer).
Southern blot hybridization

Genomic DNA of mycelia from race 1472 was digested
with selected restriction endonucleases. Digestion products were size-fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotec, England), hybridized and detected with
a 32P-radiolabeled Clpnl2 probe. Hybridizations were carried out at 60°C in 2X SSC containing 0.5% blocking agent
(Roche) and 0.1% SDS. After hybridization, the blot was
washed at 60°C for 15 min with 2X SSC containing 1%
SDS and then at 60°C for 15 min with 0.2X SSC containing 0.1% SDS.
Sequencing and DNA analysis

The sequences of both strands of DNA of race 1472 and
cDNA of both races were determined by the dideoxy-chain
termination method using the ABI Prism Dye Cycle
Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit in an ABI PRISM 310
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
The nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the DNAsis
(Hitachi) and 4Peaks v 1.7.2 software (http://mekentosj.
com). In silico analyses of putative transcription factor
binding sites were performed using the AliBaba2.1 software
[39] and the Transfac 7.0 database [40]; the regulatory
sequences reported for genes of fungal lytic enzymes were
also compared. The N-terminal secretion signal sequence
was identified with the SignalP 3.0 web server [41]. The
protein molecular mass, pI and N-glycosylation sites were
calculated on an ExPASy Proteomics Server [42].

Phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the Clpnl2
deduced amino acid sequence and the deduced amino
acid sequences of 34 pectin lyases that were previously
reported (Table 1). Protein sequences were aligned with
Clustal × software [43] using default parameters. Prior to
phylogenetic analyses, signal peptide sequences and
N-terminal and C-terminal extensions were excluded.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed under Bayesian,
maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining criteria, using
the programs MrBayes Vs. 3.1.2 [44], PAUP*v 4b10 [45]
and Mega 4 [46]. We used the amino BLOSUM G2 evolution model with gamma correction for Bayesian analysis. In total, 10,000 trees were obtained based on the
settings ngen = 1000 000 and sample freq = 100 for Bayesian criteria. Prior to estimating the support of the topologies that were found, we checked the convergence of
overall chains (4) when the log likelihood values reached
the stationary distribution. The first 2500 trees were
‘burn-in’ and discarded, and a 50% majority rule consensus tree of the remaining trees was generated. For maximum parsimony analyses, the most parsimonious trees
were estimated using the heuristic search option (TBR
branch swapping, saving only a single tree in each case)
with random sequence addition (five random replicates).
Support was evaluated by bootstrap analysis using the
full heuristic search option with 1000 replicates. For the
neighbor-joining method [47], a JTT matrix was used,
and 1000 bootstrap replicates were performed. We used
the A. thaliana pectate lyase [GenBank: CAB41092] as
an outgroup for pectin lyase analyses.
Protein homology modeling

The tertiary structure of the deduced amino acid
sequence of Clpnl2 was predicted by homology modeling using the Swiss-Model Server [48] using Pel B
from A. niger (PDB: 1qcxA) as template [14]. The prediction of three-dimensional structures of the deduced
amino acid sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis
was performed in a similar manner. The structural
parameters and prediction quality of the modeled
structures were evaluated using the program SPDBV v.
4.01 [49]. The energy minimization of the model was
performed by GROMOS96 [50], which was provided
by the SPDBV program. MMV 2010.2.0.0 (Molegro
ApS) and SPDBV v. 4.01 were used for visualization of
molecular structures.
Multiple comparisons of protein structures

The comparison of protein structures was performed
using the Voronoi contact method [51] with the ProCKSIServer [52]. Calculations were performed using default
parameters, and the resultant similarity matrixes (Voronoi-contacts) were standardized and used as the input for

Results and discussion
Isolation and sequence analysis of the Clpnl2 gene

Nine positive clones were isolated from the screening of a
C. lindemuthianum genomic library using the 32P-radiolabeled fragment of Clpnl2. Southern blot analysis of the
clones allowed the identification of a 4.0-kb fragment that
hybridized with the PCR probe. The 4.0-kb fragment was
subcloned, and 2,159 bp containing the Clpnl2 gene was
sequenced [GenBank: JN034038]. The full-length Clpnl2
cDNA of races 1472 [GenBank: JN034039] and 0 [GenBank: JN653459] obtained by RT-PCR from total RNA of
mycelium induced for 4 h with 92%-esterified pectin, was
sequenced using specific primers designed from the
Clpnl2 gene sequence.
The analysis of the cDNA sequences showed no differences between the two races. The coding region of the
Clpnl2 gene consisted of 1428 bp interrupted by four
introns ranging in size from 60 to 87 bp (Figure 1).
According to the 5’RACE analysis, a putative transcription
starting point was localized [19], and the context of the
start codon ATG matched with the Kozak sequence for
filamentous fungi [54]. Two possible regulatory sequences
were identified in the 5’ untranslated region of Clpnl2: a
putative regulatory sequence for binding to RAP1, which
is a transcriptional factor that participates in the activation
of transcription and the silencing of genes in yeast cells,

located at position +54 [55] and a possible binding
sequence for the transcription factor AbaA at position
+69. AbaA binding sites have been observed in several
genes that participate in the control of cell development in
organisms such as A. nidulans and the dimorphic fungus
P. marneffei, where AbaA has been related to morphogenesis and dimorphism, respectively [56,57]. These putative
regulatory elements were localized downstream the transcription site which is an uncommon finding. Multiple
binding sites to AbaA have been reported in cis regulatory
regions and some downstream the transcription starting
site in A. nidulans genes. No attempts were made in this
study to determine the function of these elements. Due to
the size of the promoter region of Clpnl2, it was not possible to locate more elements commonly found in genes
encoding for pectinolytic enzymes. The 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (5’UTR and 3’UTR) were 129 and 563 bp,
respectively. Two consensus sequences (AATAAA and
TTTCACTGC) found in the terminal regions of eukaryotic mRNAs [58], and two of the three consensus sequences
for yeast 3’-terminal regions (TAGT and YIT) [59] were
detected in the Clpnl2 3’UTR.
The Clpnl2 cDNA contains an ORF of 1140 nucleotides that encodes a putative protein of 379 aa with a Nterminal secretion signal sequence of 19 amino acids,
according to the SignalP 3.0 web server [41]. A protein of
molecular mass 37.4 kDa and a pI of 9.1 was calculated,
and one potential N-glycosylation site was located at
position 110 (ExPASy Proteomics Server) [42]. These

results are consistent with those reported for the amino
acid sequences of Pnl2 and pnlA of C. gloeosporioides
[25,26]. Despite N-glycosylation is common in pectinolytic enzymes and has been reported in several fungal pectin lyases al similar positions, little is known about the
function of this posttranslational modification. Although
it is believed that it affect enzyme stability and activity
[60,61].

Southern blot analysis

The genomic organization of the Clpnl2 gene was investigated by Southern blot analysis. Total DNA was
digested with the restriction endonucleases BamHI,
EcoRI, Hind III, XhoI, EcoRI/BamHI and Hind III/XhoI.
The digested DNA was fractionated on a 0.8% agarose
gel and hybridized to the 32P-radiolabeled Clpnl2 probe.

a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane and hybridized
with a 32P-radiolabeled Clpnl2 fragment.

product was detected. In addition, a very faint signal
probably resulting from hybridization with another gene
of low similarity was observed. These results suggest that
the C. lindemuthianum genome contains a single copy of
the Clpnl2 gene, as does C. gloeosporioides [26].
Protein homology modeling

The tertiary structure of Clpnl2 predicted by homology
modeling coincided with the typical topology of the parallel b-helix of PNLs (Figure 3). After energy minimization, the energy value was -17418.428 kJ/mol, and the
quality of the model generated was assessed by plating
dihedrals F and Ψ onto Ramachandran plots (SPDBV v.

To elucidate the relationship of Clpnl2 from C. lindemuthianum with bacterial, oomycete and fungal pectin
lyases, sequences reported in databases were analyzed.
Protein or deduced amino acid PNL sequences from 14
fungal species including: basidiomycetes, ascomycetes
and one oomycete species, three bacterial species, and a
pectate lyase sequence from A. thaliana as an external
group, were used to generate phylogenetic trees. Clustal
alignment used for phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4)
allowed to determine the location of amino acids
expected to have a catalytic role in the PNLs [4,13].
Asp154 and Arg176 (numbered from A. niger PELA) are
conserved in fungi and oomycetes, although Arg 176
could not be located in P. griseoroseum [GenBank:
AF502280], and Arg 236 is conserved in all analyzed
sequences. Additionally, several conserved domains
among the sequences of fungi and oomycetes were
observed, and some of these were shared with bacterial
amino acid sequences.
The trees inferred by the maximum parsimony (MP)
and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods showed less resolution than those built by Bayesian analysis, as they had a
number of unresolved branches. The general topology
obtained is represented by the Bayesian 50% majority
rule consensus tree, in which the Bayesian posterior
probabilities, MP and NJ bootstrap support are indicated
on the branches (Figure 5).

Identical residues are marked with an asterisk (*). Dashes represent gaps introduced to preserve alignment. Conserved catalytic residues are
indicated in boxes.

Bayesian analysis allowed the separation of pectin lyases
into two groups: one representing bacteria with 100% posterior probability and 100% bootstrap support for MP and
NJ analysis, and the other one representing fungi and
oomycetes with 100% posterior probability and 98% bootstrap support for NJ. In the group formed by bacteria,
sequences from Pectobacterium atrosepticum, P. carotovorum and Bacillus subtilis cluster together with 100%
posterior probability. This early separation between amino
acid sequences of bacteria and those of oomycetes and
fungi can be explained in terms of the evolution of lytic
enzymes in these microorganisms for different purposes.
Bacteria and some anaerobic fungi produce multi-enzymatic complexes called cellulosomes, which are anchored
to the cell surface, allow the microorganisms to bind to
lignocellulose substrates and increase the breakdown efficiency of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin [62,63]. In
contrast, in the majority of fungi and oomycetes, cellulases, pectinases and hemicellulases are not integrated in
cellulosome complexes, and the pectin degradation is
regulated by a multifunctional control system in which the
enzymes act in a synergistic manner and are induced by
monosaccharides or small oligosaccharides that are generated as products of the same enzymatic reactions [64,65].
The inferred tree also showed that the analyzed
sequences of saprophytic/opportunistic fungi are clustered
into a monophyletic group with 98% posterior probability
and 75% and 70% bootstrap support for MP and NJ analyses, respectively. However, phytopathogenic fungi and
oomycetes were not clustered together. This may be the
result of a reduced representation of sequences in the analysis arising from the few PNL sequences reported for
members of these groups.

C. lindemuthianum is found clustered with the amino
acid sequences of PnlA and Pnl2 of the fungal pathogen
C. gloeosporioides with 100% posterior probability for
Bayesian analysis as well as 96% and 99% bootstrap support for MP and NJ analysis, respectively.
Pectin and pectate lyases fold into a parallel b-helix, in
which a high structural conservation occurs in regions
distant from the active site and particularly in those that
contribute to the parallel b-helix architecture. The binding cleft and surroundings constitute the most divergent
part of the molecule, which allows variation in substrate
specificity [13,15]. On this background, the results of
the phylogenetic analyses and the fact that the classification of the pectin lyases is based both on amino acid
sequence similarities as well as their structural features
[9], we believe that a structural comparison would help
to strengthen the phylogenetic analysis and to establish
a relationship between the genes encoding PNLs with
their three-dimensional structures involved in carbohydrate binding.
Multiple comparisons of protein structures

Once the tertiary structure of Clpnl2 was predicted, the
tertiary structures corresponding to the amino acid
sequences used in phylogenetic analyses and covering the
central body of the enzyme including the carbohydratebinding site of these proteins were predicted and evaluated. The multiple comparisons of protein structures led
to the formation of two clusters: one composed of the
structures corresponding to the amino acid sequences of
bacteria and another that was composed of fungal and
oomycete structures (Figure 6). Furthermore, in agreement with the phylogenetic analyses, it was possible to

distinguish the cluster formed mainly by sequences of
fungi and oomycete pathogens, including Clpnl2, from
the cluster formed by saprophytic/opportunistic fungi.
Nevertheless, this analysis clustered the fungal sequences
in two clearly defined groups: fungi and oomycete pathogens and saprophytic/opportunistic fungi. These results
strongly support the notion that there is a close relationship between the tertiary structure of PNLs and the lifestyle of the microorganisms. The training of these groups
was also observed for the elimination method FAST [66]
and the hybrid heuristic URMS/RMS approach [67]
using the ProCKSI-Server [52] (data not shown). Comparative modeling techniques and multiple comparisons
of three-dimensional structures have been utilized for
different purposes (e.g., searching for putative biological
functions, drug design, protein-protein interaction studies). However, to our knowledge, this is the first study
that uses a comparative analysis of protein structure in

combination with a phylogenetic analysis to explore the
evolution of lifestyle. We believe that a structural analysis
can be an important tool for studying the evolution of
microorganisms and their enzymes, since structural differences may reflect other important properties such as
substrate specificity and others that can not be inferred
from the analysis of amino acid sequences only.
Expression analysis of Clpnl2

Analysis of the Clpnl2 transcript in cells grown with
glucose as the carbon source showed similar low basal
levels of expression in the 0 and 1472 races (Figure 7C).
When grown on cell walls, levels of Clpnl2 transcript in
the pathogenic race, 1472, increased quickly after 2 h,
reached a peak after 6 h, started to decrease and then
again increased, giving a maximal value after 12 h of
incubation (Figure 7B and 7C). Race 0 exhibited different expression kinetics: the amount of transcript peaked

after 6 h and then fell to undetectable levels after 10 h
(Figure 7A and 7C). At all time points between 2 and 8
h, expression levels were lower than those observed in
the pathogenic race. The transcript was expressed again
after 12 h but at levels that reached only 23% of those
observed in the pathogenic race.
The differences between the two races were much
more noticeable when 92% esterified pectin was used as
the sole carbon source. Transcript expression in the
pathogenic race started to increase rapidly, reached the
highest levels after 4-6 h and then started to decline, giving a still significant increase at the end of the experimental period (Figure 7B and 7C). The maximum
transcript levels on this substrate were clearly higher

than those observed on glucose. In contrast, the levels of
the Clpnl2 transcript in the non-pathogenic race
remained undetectable after 8 h of incubation. Late
expression occurred after 10-12 h of cultivation, reaching
values comparable to those observed after 4 h of culture
on cell walls (Figure 7A and 7C). These results agree
with the differences found by Hernández et al. [34], who
analyzed the extracellular activity of pectin lyase in both
races of C. lindemuthianum under the same conditions
employed in this study. When both races were grown
with glucose, extracellular PNL activity was barely
detected after 8 (race 1472) and 10 (race 0) days of incubation, as observed in this study. Plant cell walls from
P. vulgaris induced a similarly low PNL activity in the

two isolates after 7-8 days of incubation. When pectin
esterified to 92% was used as the carbon source, the
activity in the pathogenic race nearly doubled compared
with the activity in the non-pathogenic race. Early transcription of genes encoding lytic enzymes and late detection of the corresponding activities is a well documented
phenomenon in different fungi [8,30,65,68]. Apart from
the presence of a regulatory system controlling gene
expression, the production of active pectinase and probably other lyticases can be modulated by other mechanisms such as postranslational modification and protein
transport [69]. These alternatives may help to explain the
differences observed in this study.
The pectin lyase of the pathogenic race of C. lindemuthianum is able to degrade highly esterified pectin
(92%), unlike that of the non-pathogenic race. Apparently, the differences between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic races of C. lindemuthianum occur as much
at the expression level as at the level of enzymatic

activity, and it is clear that the non-pathogenic and
pathogenic races of C. lindemuthianum respond of different form to the carbon sources (except for glucose,
where the mRNA of Clpnl2 and the active enzyme is
synthesized at basal levels).
It has been proposed that the basal level of enzymatic
activity breaks down the substrate, generating degradation products that further induce enzymatic activity
[64]. A similar behavior has been observed in our
laboratory for other enzymes that degrade cell walls,
such as cellulases and the xylanase and b-xylosidase of
C. lindemuthianum (unpublished data).
Several studies have reported that the pectinolytic
enzymes play an important role in pathogenesis [70,71].
These are the first enzymes that act during the infection
of the plant, causing extensive degradation of the cell
wall and the main symptoms of the disease [72]. However, in addition to enzyme production, the sequence in
which the enzymes are produced, the speed of synthesis,

Lara-Márquez et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:260
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/260

concentration and diffusion of enzyme are also fundamental aspects of the pathogenesis process [72]. The
non-pathogenic race of C. lindemuthianum used in this
work is unable to infect P. vulgaris, and thus its lifestyle
is closer to that of a saprophytic fungus. Therefore, it is
possible that the differences found between the nonpathogenic (0) and pathogenic (1472) races of C. lindemuthianum are related to the speed of activation of the
lytic enzyme genes during the interaction with the host.
The number of pectin lyase sequences corresponding to
different species of saprophytic/opportunistic fungi used
in our analysis surpassed those of pathogenic oomycetes
and fungi. This may be because more species of saprophytic/opportunistic have been studied and their degradation
systems are better known. Alternatively, the enzymatic
diversity may be the evolutionary effect of the heterogeneity of substrates that were encountered during interactions
with an extended variety of hosts. For pectate lyases, it has
been proposed that differences in the degree of pectin
methylation can explain the existence of isozymes [4].
Pathogenic fungi and those who have close relationships
with their host have developmental strategies that allow
them to avoid the plant defenses and penetrate cell walls
through the use of lytic enzymes. Plants also rely on strategies that allow them to detect and to defend against the
attack of pathogens by producing inhibitors of these
enzymes [70,73,74]. It is therefore possible that the evolution of unique enzymes was induced in pathogenic fungi
and that a greater variability of these enzymes was induced
in those fungi with a saprophytic lifestyle, which would
explain the presence of amino acid sequences and tertiary
structures corresponding to enzymes of saprophytic/
opportunistic fungi located between the sequences of
pathogenic fungi and oomycetes in the phylogenetic analysis and comparison of structures.
There is evidence that supports a relationship between
lytic enzyme production and the lifestyles of fungi and
oomycetes. For instance, the genome of the oomycete
Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis has lost several of its
hydrolytic enzymes compared with Phytophthora sp.,
which is likely its ancestor [75,76]. According to an analysis
of the hydrolytic profiles of saprophytic/opportunistic and
pathogenic fungi using diverse substrates, the species of
phytopathogenic fungi are more active than the non-pathogenic fungi on six of eight tested substrates [74]. It has also
been observed that pathogenic fungi of monocotyledonous
plants are better adapted to degrade the cell walls of monocotyledonous plants, and pathogens of dicotyledonous
plants are better able to degrade the cell walls of dicotyledonous plants, reflecting the host preference [74].

Conclusions
The Clpnl2 gene, which was cloned from a genomic
library of C. lindemuthianum, is a unique copy and

Page 12 of 14

contains the characteristic elements of a pectin lyase of
Family 1 of polysaccharide lyases.
Phylogenetic analyses showed an early separation
between the enzymes of bacteria and those of fungi and
oomycetes as well as a tendency of the amino acid
sequences of fungi and oomycetes to cluster together
according to their lifestyle. These results were confirmed
by multiple comparison analysis of structures. According
to these results, we believe that is possible that the diversity and nature of the substrates processed by these microorganisms play a determining role in the evolution of their
lifestyle. In addition, our results showed that both races of
C. lindemuthianum express the Clpnl2 gene, although
some differences are observed in the timing and level of
expression: the pathogenic race responds faster and at
higher levels than the non-pathogenic race. This suggests
that there are at least two levels of determination of the
lifestyle of the microorganisms: one related to the evolution of the enzymes and one concerning the regulation of
the expression of the enzymes. In our model, one race of
C. lindemuthianum behaves as a hemibiotrophic pathogen
and, according to its inability to infect bean, the other race
behaves as a saprophyte. Although this study included the
analysis of pectin lyase 2 only, we have observed this behavior with other enzymes of the complex involved in the
degradation of the cell wall suggesting that it may be a
general phenomenon. The differences at this level can be
part of the general response of the fungi to host components. However future studies comparing the enzymatic
complex of degradation of more fungi species with different lifestyles are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Finally, we consider this type of information to be of
great importance for the study of the biotechnological
potential of these enzymes, as the efficiency of the
enzymes could depend on the complexity of the vegetal
material to be processed and the lifestyle of organism
that is the source of enzymes and/or genes.
