Abstract
Background: Butyrylcholinesterase is an enzyme that may serve as a marker of metabolic
syndrome. We (a) measured its level in persons with diabetes mellitus, (b) constructed a family tree
of the enzyme using nucleotide sequences downloaded from NCBI. Butyrylcholinesterase was
estimated colorimetrically using a commercially available kit (Randox Lab, UK). Phylogenetic trees
were constructed by distance method (Fitch and Margoliash method) and by maximum parsimony
method.
Results: There was a negative correlation between serum total cholesterol and
butyrylcholinesterase (-0.407; p < 0.05) and between serum LDL cholesterol and
butyrylcholinesterase (-0.435; p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation among the
other biochemical parameters. In the evolutionary tree construction both methods gave similar
trees, except for an inversion in the position of Sus scrofa (M62778) and Oryctolagus cuniculus
(M62779) between Fitch and Margoliash, and maximum parsimony methods.
Conclusion: The level of butyrylcholinesterase enzyme was inversely related to serum
cholesterol; dendrogram showed that the structures from evolutionarily close species were placed
near each other.

1. Introduction
The enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE; EC 3.1.1.1.8)
has a well-defined pharmacologic function in hydrolyzing
succinylcholine, a muscle relaxant used in anesthetic practice. It could have other roles, though much less well
defined, such as modulating the phenotypic expression of

dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Serum levels of
the enzyme are affected by dietary fat, obesity, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus [1].
With genomic sequences from many species being available in the public domain [2], it is possible to annotate

proteins in evolutionarily terms. Such analysis is particularly useful for proteins with poorly defined physiological
role, such as BchE. A phylogenetic analysis of amino acid/
nucleotide sequences could throw light on 'how the family might have been derived during evolution' [3]. The
analysis is represented as an evolutionary tree, which is a
two-dimensional graph; it shows evolutionary relationships of genes from different organisms.
Here we (a) studied the level of BChE among persons with
diabetes mellitus (b) constructed the phylogenetic tree of
25 BChE genes from publicly available sequence data.

2. Materials and methods
We studied 30 individuals with clinical type 2 diabetes
mellitus at our Centre in southern India (14 men, 16
women; age 51.9 years+/- 7.9 years, duration of diabetes
6.6 years+/-3.74 years). Butyrylcholinesterase was estimated colorimetrically using a commercially available kit
(Randox Lab, UK). Serum insulin and C-peptide were
measured by radioimmunoassay, and lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol) by colorimetry.

matrix. This process was repeated till all sequences were
added to the tree.

Results are expressed as mean+/- SD. Multiple correlation
analysis was done by SPSS package (v10.5). A p value of <
0.05 was taken as significant.

3. Results

Twenty five sequences of BchE gene were retrieved from
National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI):
Rattus norvegicus (Accession no: NM_022942), Mus musculus (NM_009738), homo sapiens (NM_000055), homo sapiens (BC018141), homo sapiens (BC008396), Sus scrofa
(AF222914), Gallus gallus (AJ306928), Panthera tigris tigris
(AF053484), Felis catus (AF053483), Equus caballus
(AF178685), Rattus norvegicus (AF244349), Oryctolagus
cuniculus (X52092), Oryctolagus cuniculus (X52091), Oryctolagus cuniculus(X52090), homo sapiens (M16541), Oryctolagus cuniculus(U04814), homo sapiens (M16474), Canis
Familiaris (M62411), Bos taurus (M62410), Macaca
mulatta (M62777), Ovis aries (M62780), Oryctolagus cuniculus (M62779), Sus scrofa (M62778), Mus musculus
(NM_009599), and homo sapiens (NM_000446).
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using two methods:
distance method (Fitch and Margoliash method) and maximum parsimony method (MP) [3].
In the distance method (Fitch and Margoliash) the
sequences were aligned by local pair-wise method and a
distance score obtained for each pair of sequences (25 ×
25 matrix). The scores were represented as a distance
matrix; the most closely related sequences in the matrix
were identified and represented as a tree/branch. The average distance between these sequences and each of the
other sequences was calculated to obtain a new distance

In the maximum parsimony method sequences were
aligned by global pairwise method, possible trees constructed, parsimony cost of each tree calculated and the
one with minimum cost identified as the optimal tree,
which was the selected output.

The results are presented in Table 1. There was a negative
correlation between serum total cholesterol and butyrylcholinesterase (-0.407; p < 0.05) and between serum LDL
cholesterol and butyrylcholinesterase (-0.435; p < 0.05).
There was no statistically significant correlation among
the other biochemical parameters.
Both methods of tree construction gave similar dendrograms, except for an inversion in the position of Sus scrofa
(M62778) and Oryctolagus cuniculus (M62779) between
Fitch and Margoliash, and maximum parsimony methods
(Figs 1, 2). There were two main subdivisions in the phylogenetic tree, with homo sapiens proteins together, and a
pairing together of rattus (A5244349, NM_022942), Felicus catus (AF053483), Panthera tigris (AF053485), and
Oryctolagus cunniculus (X52092, X53091)

4. Discussion
BChE breaks down ester type of neuromuscular blocking
agents used in anesthesia [4]. It may also play a role in
lipid metabolism [5], and may be affected by dietary fat
[6]. Similarly, diabetes mellitus has been shown to alter
the levels of the enzyme. BchE, which can affect cell membrane oxidative stress and fluidity [1], is structurally
homologous to lipase [7]. The ratio of BChE to HDL cholesterol could be a marker of cardiovascular risk in the
metabolic syndrome [8]. However recent studies have
suggested BchE may not have a direct pathophysiological
role in the development of metabolic syndrome [9], but
may be considered as secondary markers for this syndrome in obese individuals with the CHE2 C5- phenotype

[10]. In consonance with earlier studies, level of butyrylcholinesterase was related to changes in serum lipids;
however there was a relationship to serum triglycerides in
a previous study [9] and to serum cholesterol in ours.
BChE activity could also be used to select the drug for
treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus [11]. Similarly diabetes was one of the risk factors for
coronary artery disease that independently correlated with
BchE activity [12].

In the construction of evolutionary trees, the differences
in Sus scrofa and Oryctolagus cuniculus was the only variant
in the two methods. The sequences being similar, such an
output is to be expected. Consistent with an earlier report
[13], the genes of the following were close to each other:
cow (Bos taurus M62410) and sheep (Ovis aries M62780),
pig (Sus scrofa M62778) and dog (Canis familiaris
M62411), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus U04814) and
house mouse (Mus musculus NM_009599).
Animal BchE gene structure was shown to be similar to the
human gene [13]. The rate of evolution was reported to be

rapid, but not more than other proteins with well-known
function. BchE evolution had a 2.2 unit evolutionary
period (ie, 2.2 million years for a 1% amino acid change)
[13].
A broad based phylogenetic synthesis using combined
and separate analysis of published molecular and morphological source phylogenies showed generally comparable tree structures [14]: tiger, cat and horse together.

Despite the limitations in the study, it establishes proof of
concept that clinical and biochemical parameters can be
linked to data from nucleotide sequences; an evolutionary
perspective may be obtained, especially for proteins with
poorly defined physiological functions.
In conclusion we (a) found a negative correlation between
serum total cholesterol and butyrylcholinesterase and
between serum LDL cholesterol in persons with type 2

sequences of BchE using distance method (Fitch and Margoliash method) and maximum parsimony method.
