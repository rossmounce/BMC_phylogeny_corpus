Ginger DNA transposons in eukaryotes and their
evolutionary relationships with long terminal
repeat retrotransposons
Weidong Bao, Vladimir V Kapitonov, Jerzy Jurka*

Abstract
Background: In eukaryotes, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons such as Copia, BEL and Gypsy integrate
their DNA copies into the host genome using a particular type of DDE transposase called integrase (INT). The Gypsy
INT-like transposase is also conserved in the Polinton/Maverick self-synthesizing DNA transposons and in the ‘cut
and paste’ DNA transposons known as TDD-4 and TDD-5. Moreover, it is known that INT is similar to bacterial
transposases that belong to the IS3, IS481, IS30 and IS630 families. It has been suggested that LTR retrotransposons
evolved from a non-LTR retrotransposon fused with a DNA transposon in early eukaryotes. In this paper we analyze
a diverse superfamily of eukaryotic cut and paste DNA transposons coding for INT-like transposase and discuss
their evolutionary relationship to LTR retrotransposons.
Results: A new diverse eukaryotic superfamily of DNA transposons, named Ginger (for ‘Gypsy INteGrasE Related’)
DNA transposons is defined and analyzed. Analogously to the IS3 and IS481 bacterial transposons, the Ginger
termini resemble those of the Gypsy LTR retrotransposons. Currently, Ginger transposons can be divided into two
distinct groups named Ginger1 and Ginger2/Tdd. Elements from the Ginger1 group are characterized by
approximately 40 to 270 base pair (bp) terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and are flanked by CCGG-specific or
CCGT-specific target site duplication (TSD) sequences. The Ginger1-encoded transposases contain an approximate
400 amino acid N-terminal portion sharing high amino acid identity to the entire Gypsy-encoded integrases,
including the YPYY motif, zinc finger, DDE domain, and, importantly, the GPY/F motif, a hallmark of Gypsy and
endogenous retrovirus (ERV) integrases. Ginger1 transposases also contain additional C-terminal domains: ovarian
tumor (OTU)-like protease domain or Ulp1 protease domain. In vertebrate genomes, at least two host genes, which
were previously thought to be derived from the Gypsy integrases, apparently have evolved from the Ginger1
transposase genes. We also introduce a second Ginger group, designated Ginger2/Tdd, which includes the
previously reported DNA transposon TDD-4.
Conclusions: The Ginger superfamily represents eukaryotic DNA transposons closely related to LTR
retrotransposons. Ginger elements provide new insights into the evolution of transposable elements and certain
transposable element (TE)-derived genes.

Background
All transposable elements (TEs) can be divided into two
major classes: retrotransposons and DNA transposons.
Based on their transposition mechanisms, eukaryotic retrotransposons can be further divided into non-long
terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and LTR retrotransposons [1]. The latter include five clades: Copia,

BEL, Gypsy, endogenous retroviruses (ERV) and DIRS.
DNA transposons in eukaryotes can be divided into ‘cut
and paste’ transposons, self-replicating transposons
(Polinton/Maverick), rolling circle transposons (Helitron),
and tyrosine recombinase transposons (Crypton) [2,3].
Cryptons were originally identified in fungi [4], and
recently they were found in sea anemone (Nematostella
vectensis), sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) [5]
and insects [6,7].

All known ‘cut and paste’ DNA transposons consist of
17 superfamilies [2,3,8]. Each superfamily encodes a
superfamily-specific transposase (TPase), which is generally referred to as DDE transposase for the universally
conserved catalytic amino acids it contains: two aspartic
acids (D) and one glutamic amino acid (E). The Copia,
BEL, Gypsy and ERV LTR retrotransposons also code
for DDE transposases responsible for integration of their
cDNA copies into the host genome. The LTR retrotransposon-encoded transposases are similar to each other
and are conventionally called integrases. The integrases
are significantly related to bacterial transposases of IS3
and IS481 insertion sequences, but their relationship to
bacterial IS630 insertion sequences and eukaryotic
Tc1/Mariner DNA transposons appears to be more distant [9-11]. It has been proposed that integrase-encoding LTR retrotransposons evolved from the combination
of a non-LTR retrotransposon and a DNA transposon
[1,10,12,13]. Also, Gypsy integrase-like TPases have been
found in rare eukaryotic DNA transposons, TDD-4 and
TDD-5 [14,15]. However, it is unclear whether these
eukaryotic DNA transposons were derived directly from
a Gypsy LTR retrotransposon or an ancestral DNA
transposon. Moreover, Polinton DNA transposons also
encode a conserved protein similar to the Gypsy integrase, and it was suggested that an ancestral Polinton
DNA transposon arose by recruiting either an LTR retrotransposon integrase or DNA transposase by a virus
or linear plasmid [16].
In the present work, we describe a superfamily of cut
and paste DNA transposons called Ginger (for ‘Gypsy
INteGrasE Related’), coding for the transposase similar to
Gypsy integrases. The Ginger superfamily is composed of
two distinctive groups, Ginger1 and Ginger2/Tdd. The
Ginger1 group is reported in this paper, and Ginger2/Tdd
represents elements phylogenetically related to the previously reported DNA transposon TDD-4 [14].

Results
Ginger1 DNA transposons

A typical autonomous Ginger1 element encodes a single
approximately 500 to 800 amino acid long TPase that
includes an approximately 400 amino acid N-terminal
region highly similar to the integrase (INT) encoded by
Gypsy LTR retrotransposon (Figure 1). The homologous
regions include the H2C2 zinc finger domain, DDE catalytic domain, and the GPY/F motif that mediates multimerization [17]. The latter is a hallmark of Gypsy and
ERV integrases [18]. The amino acid identity between
Ginger1 TPases and Gypsy integrases is up to 40% in
the approximately 170 amino acid long DDE catalytic
region (Figure 1c). Remarkably, in addition to the
domains mentioned above, Ginger1 TPases and some
Gypsy integrases further share an approximate 40 amino

acid motif immediately upstream of the zinc finger
domain (Figure 1a, b). This motif is not universal in
Gypsy integrases; it is only present in a limited number
of integrases belonging to the Athila/Tat group, Cer1
group and a few Athila/Tat related groups containing
Gypsy-6-I_HM, Gypsy-15-I_NV, Gypsy-1-I_RO, Gypsy-1I_DD and DGLT-A1_I (Figures 1b and 2). This motif is
designated as YPYY for the four conserved amino acids:
Y/F-P-Y/F-Y/F (Figure 1b). So far, we have identified
dozens of Ginger1 families in four animal species,
including hydra (Hydra magnipapillata), gastropod
(Aplysia californica), lancelet (Branchiostoma floridae)
and aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). The hydra genome
harbors the most diverse and abundant Ginger1 elements; a total of 12 Ginger1 families were identified in
this species (Table 1). In the Ginger1-2_HM family, the
divergence of some elements from the consensus is less
than 1%, suggesting that Ginger1-2_HM elements are
still active in H. magnipapillata genome. In the current
release of B. floridae genome sequences, Ginger-1_BF is
found as a single autonomous copy (Table 1), but a few
non-autonomous copies carrying the same 5’ and 3’ end
sequences are also found. In the genome of A. pisum,
only degenerated Ginger1 elements are recognizable, but
complete elements are identified in the remaining three
species. The full length Ginger1 elements vary from
approximately 2.6 kb to 7 kb, and their terminal
inverted repeats (TIRs) are approximately 40 to 270
base pairs (bp) long (Table 1). The target site duplication (TSD) sequences of Ginger1 are 4-bp long and the
sequences are highly specific: CCGG (75%) or
CCGT/ACGG (24%) (Figure 1a). The 5’ ends of Ginger1
elements show the same conserved TGTNR pattern as
those of Gypsy LTR retrotransposons.
In addition to the INT domains, extra domains are
also found at the C-terminus of all Ginger1 TPases with
the exception of Ginger1-1_BF TPase. These domains
include the ovarian tumor (OTU) cysteine protease
domain (pfam02338), the C-terminal catalytic domain of
Ulp1 protease (pfam02902) and the plant homeodomain
(PHD) finger motif (smart00249) from the Conserved
Domain Database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/
entrez?db=cdd (Table 1, Figure 1a, e, f). Either OTU or
Ulp1 is present in a particular Ginger1 TPase, but not
both. Ginger-1_BF TPase does not contain these extra
C-terminal domains, however, it is not clear whether
Ginger-1_BF TPase itself lacks these C-terminal domains
or this particular single copy element contains an internal deletion. It is also worth noting that some Ginger1
TPase encoding sequences are interrupted by 1 to 4
introns (Table 1). Except for the first intron of Ginger5_HM (GC-AG) and the first intron of Ginger-1_AC
(GT-TG), all these introns conform to the canonical
GT-AG intron type [19].

Ginger2 DNA transposons

To our knowledge, only two families of eukaryotic DNA
transposons, TDD-4 and TDD-5, have been reported to
code for a Gypsy-like integrase. They are present in the
protist Dictyostelium discoideum, and are characterized
by 5-bp TSD [14,15]. Their amino acid identity to Ginger1 TPases is only approximately 24% in the DDE catalytic domain. To find out more members of this
potentially new group of Ginger elements, we used the
DDE core domain of the TDD-4 TPase as a query in
Tblastn or Blastp searches against the available National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. As a result, we
identified >6 families of homologous DNA transposons
from different metazoan species, including hydra
(H. magnipapillata), sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis), aphid (A. pisum), nematode (Trichinella spiralis),
sea snails (Littorina saxatilis) and lancelet (B. floridae)
(Table 2). All these transposons contain approximately
50 to 180 bp long TIRs and produce 4 bp TSDs, instead
of the 5 bp TSDs of TDD-4 and TDD-5. However, as
shown below, all these elements and TDD-4 or TDD-5
belong to the same group (Figure 2), referred to as Ginger2. In the fungus Malassezia globosa, we also found a
protein named XP_001728957.1 closely related to the
Ginger2 TPases. Neither of the two 5-kb regions flanking the XP_001728957.1-coding region encodes the
ribonuclease H or reverse transcriptase. Therefore, even
if the XP_001728957.1-coding region is not flanked by

TIRs, we classify it as a Ginger2-1_MG DNA transposon
vestige (Figure 2) rather than an LTR retrotransposon.
Like Ginger1 and the vast majority of Gypsy LTR retrotransposons, the termini of Ginger2 follow the same
conserved pattern, TGTNR. However, in contrast with
the GC-rich 4-bp Ginger1 target sequences, Ginger2 elements preferentially target 6-bp AT-rich sequences,
RTATAY (Figure 1a). Ginger2 TPases contain the H2C2
zinc finger domain and the DDE catalytic domain, but
they lack the GPY/F and YPYY motifs present in Ginger1 TPases. The lowest pairwise amino acid identity in
the DDE catalytic core region of the Ginger2 elements is
approximately 30%, compared with the 36% identity
within the same region of the Ginger1 group. This suggests that the Ginger2 group is more divergent than the
Ginger1 group and it is consistent with the observation
that Ginger2 elements are present in protists, fungi and
animals, whereas Ginger1 elements were identified only
in four animal species.
Phylogeny of Ginger1, Ginger2 and Gypsy integrases

To better understand the relationships between Ginger1,
Ginger2, and the Gypsy lineages, we performed phylogenetic analyses of a wide collection of integrases from
Gypsy LTR retrotransposons, exogenous/endogenous
retroviruses, and Polinton/Maverick DNA transposons.
Copia and BEL integrases and some integrase-like transposases from bacteria and protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis were included as outgroups. These bacterial
transposases are from the IS3 and IS481 elements, the

Figure 2 Phylogenetic relationship between the integrases of Ginger1 (for ‘Gypsy INteGrasE Related 1’), Ginger2 and Gypsy LTR
retrotransposons. The tree, based on the multiple alignments in the zinc finger domain and the DDE domain (see Additional file 1), is
constructed by the minimum evolution (ME) method (Poisson correction model, pairwise deletion, gamma parameter = 2, bootstrap replicates =
1,000). The neighbor-joining (NJ) tree is shown in Additional file 2. The ME and NJ bootstrap values of major clades are shown in parenthesis,
respectively. Lines in non-black colors differentiate the non-Gypsy integrases. The names of known Gypsy lineages follow previous literatures
[18,20,43,44]. The eukaryotic IS481-like integrases in Trichomonas vaginalis are designated as IS418EU. The two distinct Copia clades [45] are
named Copia-I and Copia-II, respectively. Integrases containing the YPYY motif are marked with red dots. The clades containing the GPY/F motif
are marked with green dots.

Bao et al. Mobile DNA 2010, 1:3
http://www.mobilednajournal.com/content/1/1/3

protozoan integrase-like TPases are closely related to
them. TPase from eukaryotic Mariner/Tc1 and Pogo elements and bacterial IS630 elements are not included for
analysis because they are phylogenetically closer to each
other [8], and are more distantly related to the integrases encoded by LTR retrotransposons and Ginger
than those encoded by IS3 and IS481 elements (data not
shown). Although our phylogenetic tree is based on the
limited sequence information from the zinc finger
domain and the DDE core domain (see Additional
file 1), most Gypsy integrases are clustered together
away from other older groups, such as IS3/IS481, Copia,
BEL and retrovirus [1], with the exception of two
lineages ofGypsy-like integrase from fungal species, clustering with Polinton group and retrovirus groups,
respectively (Figure 2). Except for the Woot element
being separated from the Osvaldo clade, the clades and
the polytomy distribution of all known Gypsy lineages
are consistent with the other studies based on the analysis of multiple domains [20,21]. In addition to the
known lineages, some extra Gypsy clades also appear in
our phylogeny, probably due to a larger data set; some
of them might represent new lineages of the Gypsy LTR
retrotransposons. Remarkably, the Ginger1 and Ginger2
groups are distinctly separated (Figure 2): Ginger2 integrases tend to group with the integrases of Polinton/
Maverick DNA transposons, while Ginger1 are closely
grouped with Athila/Tat lineage of Gypsy LTR retrotransposons. Although the YPYY motif is not included
in the sequence information used to build the tree, the
majority of YPYY motif-containing Gypsy integrases
apparently cluster together with the Ginger1 TPases that
also contain the YPYY motif (Figure 2), indicating the
YPYY motif is genetically significant. However, no
Gypsy lineages are found coclustering with Ginger1 or
Ginger2 TPases with significant bootstrap values. A
similar pattern is also observed in the tree constructed
using the different neighbor-joining method (see Additional file 2).
Host genes derived from Ginger1 TPases

Gypsy integrase-1 gene (Gin-1), encoding a Gypsy integrase-like protein, was thought to have evolved from a
Gypsy LTR retrotransposon related to the 412/Mdg1
lineage [22]. However, Gin-1 genes and a number of
other homologous genes actually evolved from the Ginger1 elements. The most parsimonious scenario is that
two independent exaptations of Ginger1 took place during the evolution of vertebrates, which gave rise to two
sets of orthologous genes designated here as Gin-1 and
Gin-2 (Figure 3). The first exaptation event gave rise to
Gin-2 genes and probably happened in the common
ancestor of vertebrates, while the second gave rise to
Gin-1 genes and happened more recently in the common ancestor of reptiles and mammals. For example,

Page 6 of 10

Gin-1 genes are present in lizard Anolis carolinensis
(FG759656.1), chicken Gallus gallus (XP_424858.2),
opossum Monodelphis domestica (XP_001380076.1) and
human (NP_060146.2); Gin-2 genes were found in fish
Danio rerio (CAM46974.1), frog Xenopus tropicalis
(AAI69154.1), lizard Anolis carolinensis (FG723791.1)
and chicken Gallus gallus (XP_415124.1). Gin-2 genes
are not found in any currently sequenced mammalian
genomes and it is likely that Gin-2 gene was lost in the
early stage of mammal evolution. Consistent with this
scenario, Gin-1 and Gin-2 encoded proteins form two
clusters in the phylogenetic tree, and both cocluster
within the Ginger1 families rather than any other Gypsy
lineages (Figure 3a, Additional file 3).
Of the six to eight introns in each of the host genes, only
three are universally conserved: they are found at the same
positions and have the same intron phases (Figure 3b).
Strikingly, all the three conserved introns are found in
Ginger1-5_HM TPase gene (Figure 3b), which has four
introns in total. In addition, the first conserved intron is
also present in the Ginger1-6,7,8_HM TPase genes (data
not shown). The data strongly indicate that Gin-1 and
Gin-2 genes are derived from a Ginger1-5_HM-like element. In invertebrate tunicate Ciona intestinalis, two
genes (XM_002130131.1 and FF869668.1) may also be
host genes derived from Ginger1-5_HM-like elements.
They also contain the three conserved introns (Figure 3b),
and their upstream and downstream genes are only within
the range of approximately 0.5 kb to 2.5 kb, within which
no flanking TIRs are found.

Discussion
In the present work, we report a new eukaryotic superfamily of DNA transposons, named Ginger, encoding
transposases homologous to the integrases of Gypsy
LTR retrotransposon. To date, we have identified two
distinct Ginger groups, Ginger1 and Ginger2/Tdd. These
groups could also be viewed as different superfamilies
based on their plausible independent origin. However,
further classification is left open here, due to uncertainties inherent in the current phylogenetic data. Previously, DIRS and Ngaro retrotransposons and Crypton
DNA transposons were also found to encode the same
class of proteins (tyrosine recombinase). However, their
evolutionary relationship is not well understood yet due
to the scarcity of data [4,23]. Therefore, the relationship
between the Gypsy LTR retrotransposons and the Ginger
DNA transposons is of particular interest from the evolutionary perspective.
It is known that transposases from bacterial transposons
that belong to the IS3 and IS481 families are significantly
similar to the integrases encoded by eukaryotic LTR retrotransposons [9,11]. Moreover, numerous families of the
IS3 and IS481 transposons are characterized by the 3’-TG

and CA-5’ termini, and by 3 to 5-bp TSDs, analogous to
LTR retrotransposons [9,11]. It has also been proposed
that in an early eukaryotic species a first LTR retrotransposon evolved from a non-LTR retrotransposon, which
recruited a transposase from a DNA transposon
[1,10,12,13]. Given the significant similarity between the
integrases encoded by Ginger1, Ginger2 and various LTR
retrotransposons, either the Ginger1 or Ginger2 groups of
transposons, or both, can be viewed as descendants of the
ancestral eukaryotic DNA transposons which provided a
TPase transformed into the integrase of the first LTR retrotransposon in early eukaryotes. However, as suggested
by the modular evolution model of transposable elements
[13], the evolutionary scenarios of Ginger and LTR integrases may be multifold.
If Gypsy was first derived through the fusion of reverse
transcriptase with a DNA transposase [1,10,12,13], one

possible scenario is a ‘reverse evolution’ in which Ginger1
elements originated from a Gypsy LTR retrotransposon.
This scenario is based on the remarkable similarity
between Ginger1 TPase and Gypsy INT, plus the fact that
Ginger1 and Ginger2/Tdd are two distinct groups on the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). Ginger1 TPases not only
share up to 40% amino acid sequence identity in the
DDE region with some Gypsy integrases, but also contain
a GPY/F domain, which has been found only in Gypsy
and retroviral integrases so far [18]. Moreover, Ginger1
TPases and a subset of Gypsy integrases contain the same
YPYY motif (Figures 1b and 2). The figure of 40% amino
acid sequence identity is comparable to the upper similarity level between integrases from different Gypsy
lineages (data not shown). In this scenario, the Ginger2
elements may resemble the ancestor element that was
recruited into the first LTR retrotransposon.

Alternatively, it is still possible that that Gypsy, Copia
and BEL LTR retrotransposons arose independently in
early eukaryotes by recruiting three different transposases from the same Ginger-like superfamily. According
to this scenario, Ginger1 transposase/transposons may
be the ‘best preserved’ descendants/relatives of the
eukaryotic transposon that ‘gave birth’ to the first Gypsy.
Another variant of this scenario is that all LTR retrotransposon-encoded integrases arose from the common
ancestor of Ginger1 and Ginger2 TPases. Thus, among
numerous hypothetical lineages of this ancestor DNA
transposon, Ginger1 and Ginger2 may be the only
lineages that survived from the times of early eukaryotic
evolution, which took place over 1.6 billion years ago.
According to this scenario, the ancient eukaryotic transposase that transformed into the integrase of the first
LTR retrotransposon was likely composed of the H2C2
zinc finger, GPY/F motifs and YPYY motifs. During
their evolution, the Ginger2, Copia and BEL lineages
might have lost the last two motifs.
Of the various Gypsy lineages shown in Figure 2, no
lineage clusters with Ginger1 groups with significant
bootstrap support. This does not preclude the possibility
that Ginger1 groups arose from particular Gypsy
lineages. It merely reflects the polytomy of Gypsy LTR
retrotransposons [1]. The true ancestral lineages leading
to Ginger1 may simply not be present in the available
dataset, or they might have been lost in the evolutionary
history, for example, due to the recombination process
that produces the solo LTRs [24]. The chain of events
that could lead to the hypothetical transformation of an
LTR retrotransposon to a DNA transposon is also
unclear. One simple possibility is that the TIRs of Ginger1 transposons were derived from two LTRs incidentally flanking the integrase region in opposite
orientations: one would be the original 3’ LTR of an
LTR retrotransposon and the other coming from
another LTR retrotransposon inserted upstream. The
enzymatic mechanism underlying the excision of Ginger1 elements is also unknown (the same applies to
Polinton/Maverick transposons). In the life cycle of LTR
retrotransposons, integrases normally are responsible
only for the integration process. However, in vivo data
have shown that retrovirus integrases can reverse the
initial strand-transfer reaction at the end of retroviral
DNA [25]. Therefore, at least theoretically, Ginger1
DNA can be excised, but the excision process may not
be as efficient as the excision of typical ‘cut and paste’
DNA transposons, since Ginger1 are small families and
the copy numbers of individual elements per host are
relatively low.
Despite the phylogenetic proximity of Ginger2 and
Polinton/Maverick transposons in the phylogenetic tree

Page 8 of 10

(Figure 2), Ginger2 is less likely to be derived from Polinton/Maverick integrases, because Polinton/Maverick integrases lack the signature N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger. It
cannot be resolved whether Polinton/Maverick integrases
arose from Ginger2 or an LTR retrotransposon, because
it is unclear whether the two fungal Gypsy-like lineages,
clustering with Polinton/Maverick groups and retrovirus
groups, respectively (Figure 2), represent some old Gypsy
lineages or are just misplaced in the tree.
The Ulp1 protease C-terminal domain and OTU
domain of Ginger1 transposases are also found in other
transposable elements (Figure 1e, f). For example, Ulp1
domain is encoded in Mutator DNA transposons found
in hydra [26], lancelet [27], Arabidopsis thaliana [28,29],
maize [30], rice and Cucumis melo [31]; OTU domains
are found in the proteins encoded by some Helitron
DNA transposons in animals (Figure 1e) [32]. It has
been suggested that Ulp1 proteases are functionally
involved in the transposition process [29]. Interestingly,
both the OTU and Ulp1 domains belong to the same
C-protease family, and have similar functions in hydrolysis of ubiquitin or the small ubiquitin-like modifier
(SUMO) protein [33,34]. Moreover, ubiquitinyl hydrolases are also found associated with other DNA transposases, such as protein XP_001314237.1 in protist
T. vaginalis [35], which consist of transposase_11
domain (pfam01609) and Peptidase C19 (cd02657)
domain. The latter domain participates in removing ubiquitin molecules from polyubiquinated peptides. These
data imply that the ubiquitin pathway may be extensively involved in transposition. One attractive possibility
is that both Ulp1 and OTU domains play an active role
in the transposition processes. For example, they may
activate the downstream factors in the DNA repair system after or during transposition, thereby minimizing
the damage in the host genome. Indeed, all the major
DNA repair pathways, damage avoidance mechanisms
and checking responses are regulated somehow by ubiquitinylation, SUMOylation, or both [36].

Conclusions
Ginger is a new superfamily of cut and paste DNA
transposons coding for the transposase homologous to
the integrase encoded by Gypsy LTR retrotransposons.
The Ginger superfamily contains two distinct groups,
Ginger1 and Ginger2/Tdd. Of the two groups, the Ginger1 transposases are more similar to Gypsy integrases.
We also describe a number of host genes domesticated
from Ginger1 TPase genes. This work takes a step
towards finding the direct ancestors of an ancient DNA
transposon recruited by a non-LTR retrotransposon
to form the first LTR retrotransposon, and also raises
the possibility of a new evolutionary pathway

Methods

Authors’ contributions
WB and JJ designed the initial research. WB prepared and processed the
data. VVK contributed information on Ginger2 elements and suggested
involvement of the ubiquitinylation and SUMOylation pathways in
transposition. WB and JJ performed research and drafted the manuscript. All
authors edited and approved the manuscript.

Data sources

Genomic sequences and mRNA sequences of various species were mainly taken from NCBI GenBank. X. tropicalis
genome sequences (release 4.1 assembled scaffolds) were
downloaded from Department of Energy (DOE) Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) http://www.jgi.doe.gov/. For the
phylogenetic analyses, integrase sequences were widely
selected from the Gypsy Database (GyDB) http://gydb.uv.
es/index.php/Main_Page[20], Repbase Update database
http://www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html[37] and GenBank. Other transposable elements without specification
of source in this paper are from the Repbase. Additionally,
the sequences of TEs reported in this work have been
deposited in Repbase with the same family names listed in
Table 1 and Table 2.
Sequence analysis

The consensus sequence of each Ginger1 or Ginger2
family, if possible, was rebuilt for analyses. The protein
coding region of individual DNA transposons or host
genes was either deduced from corresponding mRNA
sequences, or manually predicted based on the sequence
similarities between homologous proteins; exons and
introns were determined accordingly. Multiple protein
sequence alignments were carried out using MUSCLE
[38] and were adjusted manually. Sequence alignments
were edited and illustrated with BioEdit [39]. Logo
representation of the TSD sequences was created by the
WebLogo [40]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed
using neighbor-joining (NJ) method and minimum evolution (ME) method (Poisson correction model, pairwise
deletion, 1,000 bootstrap replicates) implemented in the
MEGA4 software [41]. The gamma parameter for the
phylogenetic tree was estimated using PhyMl [42].
