Abstract
Background: The common liver fluke Fasciola hepatica is the agent of a zoonosis with significant economic
consequences in livestock production worldwide, and increasing relevance to human health in developing countries.
Although flukicidal drugs are available, re-infection and emerging resistance are demanding new efficient and
inexpensive control strategies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the host-parasite interaction
provide relevant clues in this search, while enlightening the physiological adaptations to parasitism. Genomics and
transcriptomics are still in their infancy in F. hepatica, with very scarce information available from the invasive newly
excysted juveniles (NEJ). Here we provide an initial glimpse to the transcriptomics of the NEJ, the first stage to interact
with the mammalian host.
Results: We catalogued more than 500 clusters generated from the analysis of F. hepatica juvenile expressed sequence
tags (EST), several of them not detected in the adult stage. A set of putative F. hepatica specific transcripts, and a group
of sequences conserved exclusively in flatworms were identified. These novel sequences along with a set of parasite
transcripts absent in the host genomes are putative new targets for future anti-parasitic drugs or vaccine development.
Comparisons of the F. hepatica sequences with other metazoans genomes or EST databases were consistent with the
basal positioning of flatworms in the bilaterian phylogeny. Notably, GC content, codon usage and amino acid
frequencies are remarkably different in Schistosomes to F. hepatica and other trematodes.
Functional annotation of predicted proteins showed a general representation of diverse biological functions. Besides
proteases and antioxidant enzymes expected to participate in the early interaction with the host, various proteins
involved in gene expression, protein synthesis, cell signaling and mitochondrial enzymes were identified. Differential
expression of secreted protease gene family members between juvenile and adult stages may respond to different
needs during host colonization.

Conclusion: The knowledge of the genes expressed by the invasive stage of Fasciola hepatica is a starting point to
unravel key aspects of this parasite's biology. The integration of the emerging transcriptomics, and proteomics data
and the advent of functional genomics tools in this organism are positioning F. hepatica as an interesting model for
trematode biology.

Background
Fasciola hepatica, the common liver fluke, is recognized
as one of the most important parasitic helminths affecting livestock worldwide. Along with the related species F.
gigantica, F. hepatica is responsible for massive economic

losses estimated globally at 3.2 bn USD mainly due to
reduction in meat, wool and milk output in infected animals, with additional costs derived from liver condemnation and flukicide drugs [1]. During the last decade, its
relevance as a zoonotic agent in parts of Latin America
and Africa has also emerged, with millions at risk of
infection [2,3]. Although effective drugs such as triclabendazole are available, they only provide interim control of the disease, since cattle and sheep are easily
reinfected. Moreover, drug resistance against tric-

labendazole has emerged in Australia and European
countries (Ireland, The Netherlands, U.K. and Spain)
jeopardizing the long term sustainability of this control
strategy [4].
The life cycle of F. hepatica is complex and includes a
snail and a mammal as intermediate and definitive hosts
respectively. Mammals get infected by ingestion of the
quiescent larvae (metacercariae) encysted in the vegetation. An interplay of extrinsic signals from the host
(digestive enzymes, bile salts, redox potential, pH, temperature among others) and intrinsic factors from the
parasite (enzymes and secretions) determine the emergence of a motile larvae [5]. The newly excysted juveniles
(NEJ) actively penetrate and transverse the gut wall into
the peritoneal cavity within two or three hours. By four or
five days post-infection the parasites reach and penetrate
the liver, and continue burrowing through the parenchyma for several weeks. Within the major bile ducts the
parasites mature and start to release eggs, that can be
found in the bile and feces from 8 weeks post-infection
[6].
Unlike mature flukes living in the immunologically safe
environment of the bile ducts, NEJ are susceptible targets
of the immune response. Only 5-10% of the inoculum in
cattle, and 20-25% in sheep reach maturity in experimental infections, indicating that a great part of the emerged
juveniles either fail entering the gut or are killed during
the migrating phase [7,8]. Vaccination studies also show
that effective protection is correlated with reduced liver
damage, a signature of previous destruction of the early
NEJs. Despite the crucial role of this stage in determining
the further success of the infective process, information
regarding NEJs, is very limited, mainly due to the scarce
availability of material to explore diverse aspects of the
parasite biology. Principal roles for stage specific proteases and antioxidant enzymes in the early infection
have been demonstrated by us and others [9-12]. Recent
proteomic studies were able to reveal important differences among F. hepatica stages [13-15]. However, the
identification of the juvenile specific proteins was limited
by the paucity of mRNA sequences to match to peptide
mass fingerprinting data. While more than 200 protein
sequences and 10,000 EST are available from the adult
stage, only 22 mRNA sequences from NEJ (mainly corresponding to cathepsin B and L-like cysteine proteinases)
were deposited at the Genbank by July 2009. Consequently we decided to conduct a transcriptomic analysis
in order to identify the gene repertoire expressed by the
invasive stage of F. hepatica. Transcriptomic approaches
in Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum have provided
a thorough coverage of the genes expressed by diverse
stages [16,17]. Furthermore, they have been invaluable
tools for the assembly and annotation of the recently

released genomes of these important human parasites
[18,19], opening new avenues for discovery [20,21]. EST
have also been applied successfully to a limited set of
other trematodes, namely Echinostoma paraensei [22],
Clonorchis sinensis [23-25], Paragonimus westermani [26]
and Opisthorchis viverrini [27].
Here we report the analysis of a limited set of NEJ
expressed sequence tags, identifying putative stage, species and flatworm specific sequences. This first glimpse
of the physiology of the invasive larvae opens new prospects for the understanding of the host-parasite interaction eventually leading to the development of new
mechanisms to control fasciolosis, and warrants further
analysis using new generation sequencing technologies.

Results and Discussion
Construction of a newly excysted juvenile F. hepatica cDNA
library

In order to identify the genes expressed during the invasion process of the platyhelminth F. hepatica, we constructed a full length enriched cDNA library using a
modified protocol based on selective amplification of
capped polyadenylated RNA species. Since the starting
parasite material was limiting, a modified size fractioning
step of the products was introduced in order to improve
the yield [28] (Additional File 1). More than four thousand reads were produced and analyzed using the Partigene pipeline [29]. Quality and vector trimming
drastically reduced the starting 4319 ESTs to 1684 high
quality sequences, mainly due to the presence of multimers of the adapters used in the generation of the libraries
(see methods). This setback could be expected considering the minimal amount of starting material, and might
be corrected using 5' blocked adapters in lower concentrations.
The resulting high quality sequences were clustered
into 517 different contigs (249 clusters and 268 singletons), 74.6% of them showing significant similarity (E
value < 1e-05) with protein coding genes deposited in public sequence databases, indicating a good representation
of cDNAs in this library (Table 1). The most highly abundant EST in juvenile F. hepatica (13.5% of total reads) corresponds to the large subunit of the mitochondrial
ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA), and was discarded from
further analysis. Polyadenylated LSU rRNA has already
been described in other platyhelminths [28], and in fact,
F. hepatica LSU rRNA has been reported to represent
about 10% of the adult transcripts [30]. Considering that
only 22 sequences from NEJ were available in Genbank by
July 2009 (15 of them encoding cathepsins), the present
report represents a pertinent contribution to the knowledge of the genes expressed by the invasive stage of the
common liver fluke.

Comparison and validation of the FhNEJ ESTs with other
databases

In order to establish if the obtained contig sequences correspond to validated transcripts, we compared them to
different available databases, including ESTs from the
adult F. hepatica stage, predicted coding sequences from
selected organisms with complete genomes, and transcriptomes of other eukaryotes representing the main lineages in the metazoan diversity (Additional File 2). To
compare the data obtained from the juvenile stage to the
adult sequences, we retrieved and analyzed using the Partigene pipeline more than 10,000 EST reads from F.
hepatica adult worms available at the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute, obtaining 4089 contigs (1879 clusters
and 2210 singletons), 58% of them showing significant
blast hits (E value < 1e-05) with publicly available databases (Additional File 3). These results are very similar to
a recently reported analysis of the same dataset performed using a different pipeline [13].
More than half of the juvenile contigs (55.3%) were also
found in adult ESTs (Figure 1). A set of 91 juvenile contigs
(17.6%), also present in adults, showed no homology to
sequences in other databases, suggesting that they might
represent Fasciola specific transcripts expressed in
diverse stages of the parasite life cycle. On the other hand,
there are several juvenile contigs that are absent from the
adult database, although represented in other organisms
suggesting that they might represent stage specific transcripts (Figure 1). A set of 114 juvenile contigs (22,1%)
were common to all other organisms searched indicating
core eukaryotic functions such as ribosomal proteins and
common enzymes. The absence of some of them from
the adult dataset might suggest that the representation of
the adult libraries is still partial. Interestingly, 64 contigs
(12.4%) are shared only within flatworms, corresponding

to diverse taxons (listed in Additional file 2), and the results aggregated
by their conservation in diverse taxonomic groups. Groups correspond
to sequences finding hits in all taxa tested (common), all metazoans, all
bilaterians or exclusively in flatworms or in F. hepatica adult stage ESTs.
Sequences producing positive hits with some taxa but not with others
(i.e. absent in deuterostomes) are also indicated, and sequences producing no hits are depicted in grey. Sequences producing hits with the

to conserved uncharacterized transcripts that might be
relevant to parasitism. Also 56 contigs (10.9%) are shared
only within metazoans and absent in the non metazoan
choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, suggesting that
they represent metazoan innovations.
To further characterize conservation patterns between
different metazoan lineages, we analyzed the distribution
of tblastx hits by three-way comparisons using the Simitri
program [31]. As expected, the F. hepatica predicted
genes are more similar to homologues from other trematodes rather than cestodes and turbellaria, and to all flatworms rather than other protostomes, supporting the
monophylectic origin of flatworms (Figure 2A, C). Consistent with the reports from the schistosomes genomes,
we detected slightly more shared genes (being them also
more similar) with the complete genomes of vertebrates
than with insects and nematodes [18,19]. These results
further support the idea that ancient genomes were gene
rich, and that lineage specific gene gain and loss events
were frequent during metazoan evolution, particularly
within the ecdysozoans [32]. While the relevance of genes
shared between trematodes and their hosts has been
highlighted, since they may be crucial for parasite adapta-

by tblastx with a set of ESTs or cDNA databases indicated in Additional file 2. The resulting tblastx scores were transformed in coordinates and represented in a triangular graph with Simitri. Each sequence is represented by a dot colour coded by its aggregated blast score and placed in the middle
area if found in the three databases, on the corresponding cathetus if found in two databases. Sequences that match in only one of the databases or

Comparisons are shown among (A) trematodes, cestodes, and turbellaria (B) cnidarians, mollusks, and annelids (C) flatworms (excluding F. hepatica), mollusks, and annelids (D) lophotrochozoans (excluding platyhelminths) ecdysozoans, and deuterostomes.

tion to the host [33], the inverse situation (genes present
in the parasite but absent in their hosts), might provide
relevant candidates for anti-parasitic intervention.
Additionally, since we included in the study partial
genomes from other lophotrochozoans (annelids and
mollusks) we were able to compare the Fasciola dataset to
these organisms and other phyla. This is relevant since
flatworm position in modern phylogeny is still debated,
being placed either within or as sister group of the lophotrochozoa [34-36]. The conserved set of liver fluke genes
is almost equally distant from cnidarians, mollusks, and
annelids, but slightly closer to the two lophotrochozoans
than the model ecdysozoans or vertebrates (Figure 2B, D,
and Additional File 4). The trend in this (and all other

comparisons performed) were maintained when including the 4089 F. hepatica adult contigs suggesting that the
effects observed might not be due to sampling bias (data
not shown). The comparisons here presented are consistent with the placement of flatworms basal to the lophotrochozoans.
Compositional characteristics of F. hepatica predicted
proteins

The average G+C content of the F. hepatica ESTs (both
juvenile or adult) was 45%, a value substantially higher
than in S. mansoni and S. japonicum (34%) [37]. Since
variation in GC content can result in skewed codon usage
[38], we analyzed the frequency of codons and amino

Cancela et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:227
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/227

acids of the predicted protein coding sequences in all F.
hepatica available assemble ESTs (NEJ and adult stage),
and compared it to those observed in other trematodes.
As indicated in Figure 3A, there is a detectable difference
in codon frequency, between the schistosomes and the
other trematodes (including F. hepatica). Schistosomes
prefer the most AU rich codon of each synonymous family, and are also strongly biased against C or G in the third
codon position confirming early predictions obtained
with limited gene sets [39]. More striking is the fact that
significant differences were also found at the amino acid
level, where schistosomes uses less Arg, Ala and Gly, and
are enriched in Asn, Ile and Ser (Figure 3B). In a recent
paper the tRNA complement of S. mansoni and S. japonicum is analyzed, but no significant correlation between
tRNA copy number with the overall codon usage were
found in any of the species [40]. The biological and evolutionary significance of the differences here observed is
not clear, and deserves further consideration. In any case,
these results raise the question that schistosomes might
represent a more divergent than expected model for
other trematodes.

Gene Ontology classification and functional annotation

Gene Ontology (GO) provides a useful way of classifying
and annotating sequence information. Our analysis of the
F. hepatica juvenile dataset showed up to 179 NEJ contigs
with GO assignment. The molecular function classification showed a predominance of the binding category
overlapping with almost all other categorizations, followed by enzymes (catalytic activity) and structural components. The discrimination within the binding class
showed three main divisions of similar relevance, two
overlapping with enzymes and ribosomal proteins and a
set identified as protein and DNA binding associated
with regulatory functions (Figure 4A). The more represented biological process categories were linked with
metabolism, regulation and development (Figure 4B),
showing a consistent assignment of GO cellular components (data not shown). Functional annotation of predicted proteins showed a general representation of the
diverse biological functions. Proteases and antioxidant
enzymes should be highlighted since they have long been
under scrutiny for their putative involvement in invasion
and immune evasion processes [9,10,41-49]. Novel proteins included ribosomal proteins (Additional File 5) sev-

membrane spanning protein located at the tegument of S.
mansoni, Sm22.6 tegument antigen [51], and venom
allergen-like (VAL) proteins, a candidate vaccine antigen
against Necator americanus and Ancylostoma caninum
[52-55].
Relevant molecules for parasitism

Despite the small size of our juvenile library the more
represented sequences included proteinases and antioxi-

dant enzymes previously reported as being predominantly expressed in NEJ [12,56-60], together with
predicted proteins of unknown function conserved only
in F. hepatica or in other trematodes but not in other taxa
(Table 2).
Secreted cathepsins were among the more represented
transcripts in juvenile ESTs, and also in the adult dataset
(Table 2, Additional File 6). A more detailed analysis of
these transcripts showed that different isoforms are are
being expressed by the invading and adult stage. While
cathepsins L3, L4 and L6 are detected in the juvenile
ESTs, they are absent from the much larger adult dataset
(with the exception of cathepsins L4). Proteomic analysis

have shown that cathepsins L1 and L2 are clearly predominant in adults, in agreement with the relative abundance of their transcripts in the adult EST database [13]
(Additional File 6), and it has been proposed that the repertoire of cathepsin Ls gradually change from those
expressed in juveniles to a different set characteristic of
the adults worms [13-15]. Interestingly, it has recently
been reported that the juvenile predominant cathepsin
L3 has a strong collagenase activity, that might result
essential for the invasion process [61], while the "adult"
cathepsin L1 is involved in hemoglobin degradation [14].
We found evidence that within the less characterized
cathepsin B gene family a similar phenomenon might be
taking place. The cathepsin B forms that appear as frequent in juveniles are quite distinct to the cathepsin B
transcripts found in the adult stage dataset (Additional
Files 7 and 8), suggesting that they might also be functionally distinct; cathepsin B1 functions as a digestive
enzyme in the juvenile gut [62].
Further evidence that changing repertoires of enzymes
within gene families might be a common theme in the
parasite adaptation to the diverse environments found in
their hosts is provided by the legumains. These enzymes
have been proposed to have a relevant role activating
other enzymes in helminth proteolytic cascades
[12,13,63-67]. A novel legumain detected in the juvenile
ESTs, legumain 3 has an inverted expression pattern with
the previously reported legumain isolated from adult
worms (Additional File 9, panels A, B). Besides the
already described cathepsins and legumains, the degradome of the juvenile liver fluke was enriched by other
proteases, including a novel serine proteinase, calciumdependent cysteine proteinases (calpains), and components of the proteasome and ubiquitin pathway (Table 3).
Proteinase inhibitors like cystatins were also produced by
the juvenile larvae. These might modulate parasite proteases on the host immune response as was described for
nematode cystatins [68-71].
Sequences encoding detoxifying enzymes like thireodoxin peroxidase (TPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD),
thioredoxin 2, glutation S-transferases and a novel glutathione peroxidase not previously reported in F. hepatica
were also found in juveniles, stressing their relevance for
immune evasion [72]. In flatworms thioredoxin and glutathione peroxidases are the main enzymes involved in
detoxifying reactive oxygen species produced by host
immune effector cells [73,74].
Secreted and surface proteins that may modulate host
interactions are considered as relevant targets for vaccine
or anti-parasitic drug design [75]. SignalP analysis identified putative signal peptides in 60 NEJ predicted proteins,
while 52 had an N-terminal signal anchor peptide. Several putative secreted proteins were novel (with no significant hits) or conserved only in trematodes but not
detected in other taxa. Some of these transcripts were

Page 8 of 14

among the more represented ESTs in juveniles (Table 2).
The repeated detection of these transcripts in partial
datasets from diverse trematodes support the notion that
they are truly highly expressed genes in trematodes, and
may be important mediators for parasitism. We selected
Contig FHC00023, a predicted secreted protein of
unknown function that is the most frequent in the juvenile ESTs with no homologies outside F. hepatica for further analysis. By real time PCR we found that this
transcript is predominantly expressed in the invasive
stage confirming the in silico observation (Additional File
9 panel C). The putative ORF is characterized by repeated
Ser and Thr residues predicted to be glycosilated, and in
further analysis showed faint homology with mucins.
Parasite-specific proteins (with no counterparts in vertebrates) like these are ideal targets for development of
therapeutic agents since they would have no cross-reactivity with host molecules. The elucidation of the function of these proteins is an important task. The growing
availability of functional genomics tools like RNA interference in F. hepatica and model trematodes [76-78]
offers some hope this can be accomplished.

Conclusions
The data presented here provides an initial picture of the
transcriptional status of the invasive stage of the zoonotic
trematode F. hepatica, one of the most common parasites
of livestock worldwide, and a relevant agent of human
disease in impoverished areas of South America and Asia.
Besides confirming previously identified genes involved
in the invasion process, we also identified plausible candidates for anti-helminthic intervention. A set of putative F.
hepatica specific transcripts, together with other flatworm specific sequences identified, and a group of transcripts absent in their mammalian hosts, provide an
initial framework to pinpoint novel targets for future
anti-parasitic drugs or vaccine development. The availability of recently developed functional genomic tools in
liver fluke offers a platform to start unraveling the function of these novel conserved genes. Furthermore, we
detected interesting differences between the models
Schistosoma species with other lineages of trematodes,
suggesting that genomic and transcriptomic efforts in
other flukes might be justified. Comparative studies
between diverse trematodes would provide more clues on
evolutionary adaptations to parasitism. The richness of
information obtained from a limited set of data warrants
an in dept analysis of the transcriptome using new multiparallel sequencing technologies.

cellulose until use. Excystment of metacercariae was performed as described previously [15]. Briefly, metacercariae were placed in a 100-μm filter and incubated 5 min
with 1% sodium hypochlorite, washed exhaustively with
PBS and incubated at 39°C for up to 3 hours in a solution
prepared by mixing equal volumes of A (0.4% sodium
taurocholate, 120 mM NaHCO3, 140 mM NaCl, pH 8.0
and B (50 mM HCl, 33 mM L-cysteine). The emerging
NEJs were collected in a 20 μm-filter with RPMI-1640
medium and used for RNA extraction.
RNA extraction, ligation of RNA adaptors and cDNA
synthesis

Total RNA from 1200 NEJs was prepared using the Micro
to Midi RNA Extraction Kit (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Two hundred nanograms of
total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis using the protocol described [28]. Briefly, the non capped RNAs were
dephosphorylated, and the complete mRNAs were
decapped by a pyrophosphatase treatment, and later
ligated to the GeneRacer RNA oligo to introduce a 5'
priming site in complete mRNAs. After this treatment,
first strand synthesis was performed with the reverse
transcriptase Superscript III (Invitrogen) using GeneRacer oligo-dT primer (5'GCTGTCAACGATACGCTAC
GTAACGGCATGACAGTG(T)183').
Preparation of NEJ cDNA libraries

Amplification of full-length cDNAs was performed by
PCR using universal forward (GeneRacer 5'Nested:
5'GGACACTGACATGGACTGAAGGAGTA3')
and
reverse
primers
(GenerRacer
3'Nested:
5'CGCTACGTAACGGCATGACAGTG3') provided by
the GeneRacer kit. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles
(94°C, 45 sec; 68°C 45 sec; 72°C 5 min) using Hot Start
Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas). PCR products were
size fractionated in three subpopulations (300-800 bp,
800-2000 bp and >2000 bp) by excision from 1% TBE agarose gels, purified with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit
(QIAGEN), ligated to pCR4-TA cloning vectors (Invitrogen), electroporated into One Shot TOP 10 Electrocompetent E. coli (Invitrogen), and plated on LB Amp/X-Gal.
Recombinant clones from the libraries were randomly
picked, grown in Circle Growth medium and stocked at 80°C in 96-well plates in 30% glycerol.
DNA sequencing and Bioinformatics analysis

Clones were cultured in 96 well plates with Circle Growth
media and plasmid DNA was purified by alkaline lysis in
96 well plates. DNA was sequenced with M13 reverse
primers using the Dyenamic ET Dye Terminator cycle
sequencing kit for MegaBace DNA Analysis Systems (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

Page 11 of 14

The sequence reads obtained were processed and analyzed using the Partigene pipeline [29]. Briefly,
Trace2dbest [79] processed the chromatograms removing
low quality (Phred <15, <150 bp) and vector sequences,
and the resulting preprocessed ESTs were assembled in a
two-step process carried out by CLOBB [80] and Phrap
programs; the resulting contigs and singletons were compared to a set of databases maintained locally (listed in
Supplementary Table 1) using tBLASTX and BLASTX.
Functional categories were analyzed using annot8r [81].
Signal sequence prediction was performed using
SignalP3.0 program [82]. Prediction of trans-membrane
domains were conducted using TMHMM software [83].
Blast results comparisons were performed with Simitri
[31]. All the available ESTs reads from adult stage of F.
hepatica available at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths were downloaded and processed with the same pipeline. The juvenile sequences here obtained were deposited at the
dbEST with the accessions GT740211 to GT741887.
Codon usage and amino acid frequencies

For F. hepatica adult and juvenile stages, Echinostoma
paraensei, Opistorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis,
open reading frames were predicted from the assembled
EST data using EMBOSS bioinformatics suite [84]. The
longest ORF from each EST was retrieved and the predicted protein sequence was blasted against the NCBI nr
databank. ORFs with significant hits were kept for further
analysis. For S. japonicum and S. mansoni predicted coding regions obtained through the respective genome projects were analyzed. Codon and amino acid usage was
calculated using GCUA: General Codon Usage Analysis
tool [85]
Real time PCR

Real time PCR experiments were carried out in an
Applied Biosystems 7500 Real time PCR System. Ten
microliters of different dilutions of cDNA of NEJ and
adult parasites were amplified using 0.2 μM each specific
primers, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25 uM dNTPs, 0.25 U Platinun
Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 1× SYBR Green, 1×
PCR buffer in a 20 uL volume reaction. Primers
sequences are β-actin (Forward 5'-GTGTTGGATTCTGGTGATGGTGTC-3' and Reverse 5'-CAATTTCTCCTTGAT GTCTCG-3'), FHC00023 (Forward 5'-ATGG
TGCGAACGCTAAG-3' and Reverse 5'-GAAGAACGCAACGCCGAAGA-3'), Legumain 1 (Forward 5'CAAGGATGTTTATGAAGGG-3'and Reverse 5'-TGC
TTTGTTCATGCTGGC-3') Legumain 3 (Forward 5'-AG
CAGACAAAACCCTTATCGT-3'and Reverse 5'-GGA
ATAATAGTAGGCGACGTG-3'). Reactions were performed in triplicate using the following PCR amplification conditions, 1 cycle (94°C, 5 min), 40 cycles (94°C, 15

seg; 60°C, 10 seg; 72°C, 15 seg). All results were analyzed
using the 2-ΔΔCt method and β-actin as internal control
group [86].
Note added in proof

Recently a separate study describing the generation of
more than 500,000 sequences from an adult cDNA
library using 454 sequencing was published [87]. However, at the time of writing these sequences have not been
made publically accessible and hence a comparative analysis of this dataset was not possible.
