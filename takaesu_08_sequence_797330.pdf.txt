Abstract
Background: Iron-storage protein, ferritin plays a central role in iron metabolism. Ferritin has
dual function to store iron and segregate iron for protection of iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen
species. Tissue ferritin is composed of two kinds of subunits (H: heavy chain or heart-type subunit;
L: light chain or liver-type subunit). Ferritin gene expression is controlled at translational level in
iron-dependent manner or at transcriptional level in iron-independent manner. However,
sequencing analysis of marine mammalian ferritin subunits has not yet been performed fully. The
purpose of this study is to reveal cDNA-derived amino acid sequences of cetacean ferritin H and
L subunits, and demonstrate the possibility of expression of these subunits, especially H subunit, by
iron.
Methods: Sequence analyses of cetacean ferritin H and L subunits were performed by direct
sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments from cDNAs generated via reverse
transcription-PCR of leukocyte total RNA prepared from blood samples of six different dolphin
species (Pseudorca crassidens, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens, Grampus griseus, Globicephala
macrorhynchus, Tursiops truncatus, and Delphinapterus leucas). The putative iron-responsive element
sequence in the 5'-untranslated region of the six different dolphin species was revealed by direct
sequencing of PCR fragments obtained using leukocyte genomic DNA.
Results: Dolphin H and L subunits consist of 182 and 174 amino acids, respectively, and amino acid
sequence identities of ferritin subunits among these dolphins are highly conserved (H: 99–100%,
(99→98) ; L: 98–100%). The conserved 28 bp IRE sequence was located -144 bp upstream from
the initiation codon in the six different dolphin species.
Conclusion: These results indicate that six different dolphin species have conserved ferritin
sequences, and suggest that these genes are iron-dependently expressed.

Background
Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron storage protein found in all
living organisms [1-3]. It also functions to segregate iron
in a non-toxic form to prevent iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen species production [3-7]. Mammalian tissue ferritins
consist of two functionally different subunits, termed as H
(heavy chain, heart-type) and L (light chain, liver-type),
and a central cavity accommodating up to 4,500 iron
atoms [1,8]. A novel mitochondrial ferritin has also found
in humans and rodents, and their ferritins only consist of
a novel H-type subunit with 80% identity to their H subunits [9]. The H subunit plays a crucial role in incorporating iron through its ferroxidase activity [10,11]. The L
subunit lacks ferroxidase activity, but is involved in iron
nucleation to allow more iron to be sequestered [8,1113].
The H and L subunits of many mammalian ferritins have
been sequenced; each subunit shows high amino acid
sequence identity with the corresponding subunit of other
species despite there being low identity (50–56%)
between the H and L subunits within species [2,3,7,14].
Amino acids associated with the ferroxidase center are perfectly conserved in all known mammalian H subunits,
and the residues involved in iron nucleation are highly
conserved in all known mammalian L subunits
[2,3,7,8,14].
Translation of both H and L subunits of mammalian ferritins is iron-dependently regulated through the interaction of the iron-responsive element-binding protein (IREBP) with the IRE found in the 5'-untranslated region of
ferritin mRNAs [3,15]. Ferritin H and L subunits are also
transcriptionally activated by oxidative stress through the
antioxidant-reactive element (ARE), a region far upstream
of the 5'-untranslated region of H and L subunit genes
[16,17].
Although amino acid sequences of mammalian ferritin H
and L subunits were high conserved over species, full
sequence analysis of marine mammal ferritin has not yet
been performed. This study reveals ferritin coding
sequences from six different dolphin species (Pseudorca
crassidens, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens, Grampus griseus, Globicephala macrorhynchus, Tursiops truncatus, and Delphinapterus leucas). Sequence analysis of the 5'-untranslated
region of the H subunit gene also provides strong evidence of iron-dependent ferritin expression through an
IRE.

Materials and methods
Preparation of total RNA and genomic DNA from blood
samples
Blood samples were obtained from the tail veins of apparently healthy individuals of six different species of dol-

http://www.actavetscand.com/content/50/1/42

phin (P. crassidens, L. obliquidens, G. griseus, G.
macrorhynchus, T. truncatus, and D. leucas) kept at Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise (Yokohama, Japan). Leukocytes were prepared from heparinized blood samples
by centrifuging at 1,700 × g for 20 min. Preparation of
total RNA and genomic DNA from leukocytes was carried
out using the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen Inc., CA, USA) and
QIAamp DNA Blood midi kit (Qiagen Inc.), respectively.
Reverse Transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) and cloning
First-strand cDNA was synthesized using total RNA (500–
1,000 ng) in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 units
of transcriptor reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), dNTPs (20 nmol each),
and oligo(dT) primer (20 pmol). PCR was performed in
reaction buffer (25 μl) containing 1 μl of the above firststrand cDNA, PrimeSTAR HS (Premix, 1×) (TaKaRa Bio
Inc., Shiga, Japan), and 25 or 2.5 pmol each of sense and
antisense primers. The sense and antisense primers were
as follows: H sense: 5'-CCCGCCGCCGCTCCAGCG
CCGCGCAGCC-3'; H antisense: 5'-GGTAAAGGAAACCCCAACATGCATGCA-3'; L sense: 5'-ATGAGCTCCCAGATTCGTCAGAATTATT-3'; L antisense: 5'-CTAGTCGT
GCTTGAGGGTAAGCCTTTCG-3'. In addition, for direct
sequencing of PCR fragments, sense and antisense primers
were designed to contain the coding sequence, including
the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of the L subunit, from
nucleotide sequences of known mammalian L subunits
[14,18,19]. Sense and antisense primers were 5'CGGGACCAGCCACCATTTTTTAACTCCT-3' and 5'-TTTCCATATGGTCCAAGGCTT-3', respectively. Reaction conditions were 2 min at 98°C followed by 35 cycles of 10 sec
at 98°C, 30 sec at 65°C, and 60 sec at 72°C. The PCR fragment (approximately 600 bp) was excised and purified
from a 3% agarose gel using the MinElute Gel Extraction
Kit (Qiagen) and cloned into Zero-blunt TOPO plasmid
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) for transformation of E. coli cells. The cloned fragment was sequenced
in both directions using appropriate primers by an automated ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan).
Sequencing of IRE of H subunit gene
Sequence analysis of the IRE and its flanking region was
performed using dolphin leukocyte genomic DNA. Sense
and antisense primers were designed based on the human
H subunit gene (AF139813): sense primer: 5'-CGGG
GCGGGCGGCGCTGATTGGCCGGGG-3'; antisense: 5'CATGGACAGGTAGACATAGGAGGCGTAG-3'. PCR conditions were the same as described above except using
genomic DNA (100–200 ng). After electrophoresis, PCR
fragments were purified from the gel and used for direct
sequencing as described above.

Sequence analysis
Amino acid sequences were deduced from nucleotide
sequences determined by cDNA sequencing and direct
sequencing of PCR fragments. Sequence analyses were
performed using the computer software GENETYX-MAC
(Soft Development Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Secondary
structural prediction of the IRE and its flanking sequences
was also performed using GENETYX-MAC.

Results
Sequence analysis of dolphin ferritin H and L subunits
Two or more cDNA (~4 clones) clones were sequenced for
each ferritin subunit with the exception of the L subunits
of L. obliquidens and T. truncatus, for which only one clone
each was sequenced. Mammalian ferritin may undergo
modification by release of the initiating Met and acetylation of the next residue (Ser or Thr) [18-22]. We suggest

that dolphin ferritin may be subjected to the same modifications. Figures 1 and 2 show the nucleotide sequences
and predicted amino acid sequences of P. crassidens.
Nucleotide sequences of the H subunits of the six different
dolphin species contained a 28-bp 5'-untranslated region
followed by a 182-amino acid protein (excluding the Nterminal methionine) and a 55-bp 3'-untranslated region.
Nucleotide sequences of the L subunits contained a 15-bp
5'-untranslated region followed by a 174-amino acid pro-

regions, including the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions were
determined in P. crassidens, G. griseus, G. macrorhynchus,
and T. truncatus of the six different dolphin species. However, the 3'-untranslated region of L. obliquidens, and both
the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of D. leucas could not
be determined because sufficient amounts of PCR product
for sequencing could not be produced for unknown rea-

son. Nucleotide sequences of the H subunit were highly
conserved among the six different dolphin species. Substitutions as compared with P. crassidens in Figure 1 were as
follows: G480A in G. macrorhynchus; T255C and T492C in
G. griseus; a(-6)c, T408G, G504A, and G528T in L. obliquidens; a(-6)c, C18T, C165T, G363A, T408G, and G528T in
T. truncatus; A177G, C182G, C208T, A228G, T255C,
C400A, G449T, T450G, G459A, G480T, G528C, C534T,
and c588t in D. leucas. Amino acid sequences of the H
subunit were identical in five of the six dolphin species,
the exception being D. leucas with three amino acid substitutions (S56C, L129I, and G145V), resulting in 98%
sequence identity as compared to the canonical cetacean
H subunit sequence shown in Figure 3.
Nucleotide sequences of the L subunits among the six different dolphin species were also highly conserved when
compared to the P. crassidens sequence shown in Figure
2. The 5'-untranslated regions of the L subunits sequenced
were identical, and the 3'-untranslated regions that were
sequenced were identical except for one substitution
(t599 g). The L subunit coding region is also markedly
conserved. Substitutions as compared with P. crassidens
were as follows: no substitution in G. macrorhyncus;
T522C in L. obliquidens; G21A and T522C in G. grisseus;
C73T, C100T, G482T, and T522C in T. truncatus; G184A,
G325C, C510T, and T522C in D. leucas. Amino acid
sequences of the L subunits of P. crassidens, L. obliquidens, G. griseus, and G. macrorhynchus were identical. T.
truncates is 99% identical with one substitution (G160V),
and D. leucas is 98% identical with two substitutions
(G61S and E108Q), as compared with the canonical cetacean L subunit (P. crassidens, L. obliquidens, G. griseus,
and G. macrorhynchus) shown in Figure 3. Amino acid
identities between the H and L subunits of P. crassidens,
T. truncatus, and D. leucas were 51, 50, and 51%, respectively.
Amino acid sequences of the H and L subunits of P. crassidens, L. obliquidens, G. griseus, and G. macrorhynchus were
designated as canonical cetacean ferritin sequences and
aligned with other known mammalian ferritin H and L
subunits (Figure 3). Seven amino acids (E23, Y30, E57,
E58, H61, E103, and Q137)[2,17] associated with the ferroxidase center were perfectly conserved in all mammalian H subunits including cetaceans. Residues in the iron
nucleation site (H49, R52, E53, E56, E57, R59, E60, R64,
K67, E136, K139, K142, K172, H173, and D174)[2,8,17]
were highly conserved in mammalian L subunits, with
cetaceans containing only one substitution (R59H). Residues involved in dimer formation and the 3-fold axis
(iron channel) are highly conserved in amino acid character even in the presence of substitutions for cetacean H
and L subunits. In the 4-fold axis, the H and L subunits
may be functionally different as the hydrophobic Leu 169,

http://www.actavetscand.com/content/50/1/42

present in all L subunits except for mouse, is substituted
for the hydrophilic amino acid His in all H subunits. A salt
bridge formed between K58 and E103 in all L subunits
provides physical and chemical stability of the ferritin
molecule despite the loss of ferroxidase activity [2,8,23].
Cetacean L subunits do not have the extra octapeptide
found in rat and mouse L subunits. Amino acid sequence
identities among mammalian H subunits are high (91–
97%), and those among L subunits also high (78–91%),
with cetacean H and L subunits showing especially high
identity with canine and feline H and L subunits (97 and
96% in canine and feline H subunits, respectively, and
91% in canine and feline L subunits) (Table 1).
The IRE sequence of dolphin H subunits
The H subunit 5'-untranslated region nucleotide
sequences of the six different dolphin species were aligned
with the corresponding region of the human H subunit
gene (AF139813)[24](Figure 4). The boxed cetacean IRE
sequences have one substitution, except for P. crassidens
with two substitutions, as compared to the human IRE
sequence. The predicted secondary structure of the cetacean IRE and its flanking sequences is similar to that of the
human IRE based on the previous report (data not
shown). The hairpin loop of these conserved IRE regions
contains a terminal hexaloop sequence with CAGUGU
and conserved UGC/C which distorts the stem loop; these
regions are known to contribute to IRE-BP binding [24].

Discussion
Although a partial ferritin subunit sequence of the seal
Phoca vitulina (AF246195, unpublished data) has been
determined, the entire coding sequences of ferritin subunits in marine mammals were previously unknown. The
present study shows the ferritin coding sequences coding
for the H and L subunits of six different dolphin species
(P. crassidens, L. obliquidens, G. griseus, G. macrorhyncus, T.
truncatus, and D. leucas). The predicted secondary structures using the GENETYX-MAC computer program (Robson method) of dolphin ferritin H and L subunits show A,
B, C, D, and short E-helices and the L loop connecting B
and C helices (data not shown) as in other mammalian
species [1-3,18]. Sequence comparisons between dolphin
ferritin and that of other mammalian species strongly suggest similar functions for the H subunit unique ferroxidase [2,3,18], the L subunit salt bridge [2,8,23] and iron
nucleation site [2,8], subunit dimer formation [8,18], and
the iron channel [8,18]. A putative glycosylation site was
found and is conserved in both H and L subunits of mammalian ferritin, including dolphin ferritin. However, at
present, glycosylated ferritin has only been found in
humans [25]. Amino acid sequences of the H and L subunits among the six different dolphin species were highly
conserved, but D. leucas is more divergent as compared
with the other species, most likely because D. leucas is a

member of the Monodontidae, whereas the others are
members of the Delphinidae.
Interestingly, sequence comparisons among mammalian
ferritins showed that cetacean (dolphin) is closest to carnivore (canine and feline). Cetacea (whales, dolphins,
and porpoises) are believed to have evolved from Mesonychia according to dental characters [26,27]. However,
phylogenic analyses based on molecular and morphologogical data have shown that Hippopotamidae are the
closest extant relatives of Cetacea, and that Hippotamidae
and Cetacea are closely related to the Artidactyla (cows,
camels, and pigs) [26-31]. On the other hand, comparative genomic analyses that take into account genome
organization (rearrangement, exchange, gene order, and
association) have inferred varied rates of genome evolution among mammalian orders [32]. These rates have
been found to be slow in certain species of mammals,
from several different orders, including feline, mink, ferret, dolphin, and human [32]. Putative ancestral chromosomes consist of homologs of human chromosomes
11+15+19q [32]. Interestingly, human ferritin H and L
subunit genes are on chromosomes 11 and 19q3, respectively [33]. This finding suggests that ferritin subunit
sequences are highly conserved in mammals, and may
therefore provide insufficient phylogenetic information
to resolve the relationships of mammalian orders.
Cetaceans get their nutrition mainly from fish and other
animal protein, as do carnivores. The iron concentration
in the liver of striped dolphin (Stenella coerulealba) is relatively high (200 ± 12 μg/g wet weight) [34], and the iron
content of ferritin prepared from the spleen of common
dolphin (Delphinus cetacea) is also relatively high (Fe/pro-

tein ratio = 0.21) when compared to that of tuna spleen
(0.14)[35]. The number of amino acids (182) in cetacean
H subunits is the same as in canine and feline, and the Cterminal region shows high identity to that of canine and
feline. This is significant since the ferritin iron uptake rate
depends on the C-terminal region of the H subunit
[36,37]. The L subunit is responsible for taking up more
iron by adjusting the microenvironment within the ferritin complex [3,8,11]. Although whether or not the
sequence evolution of ferritin may have been affected by
factors such as body iron stores, food, or other environmental factors remains to be clarified, further study is
needed to determine the sequences of ferritin subunits
from Hippotamidae (hippopotamuses) which are phylogentically close to Cetaceca. In addition, the 15 amino
acids involved in iron nucleation in dolphin ferritin are
highly conserved, with only one substitution (R59H).
However, histidine is similar to arginine as basic amino
acid. Further study need to examine whether this substitution may be unique to marine mammals or not.
Ferritin synthesis is regulated at both the transcriptional
and translational levels by oxidative stress and cellular
iron conditions, respectively [3,4,15-17]. In order to
determine if an IRE sequence was present, dolphin leukocyte genomic DNA was used because the stem loop
formed by the IRE hinders the advance of the RT reaction
for first-strand cDNA synthesis from mRNAs [15]. The
presence of the IRE in dolphin mRNA was reveled by
sequence analysis of the 5'-untranslated region of the H
subunit gene, and its predicted secondary structure is similar to that of the human IRE. The dolphin ferritin H subunit IREs had conserved a base pair formed between the G
in the UGC bulge and the C in the other strand unique to

other mammalian ferritin IREs in addition to canonical
CAGUGN loop sequences [38]. Therefore, we surmise
that cetacean H and L subunits are synthesized irondependently at the translational level as in other mammalian species [3,15,24]. Additionally, the ARE is responsible for up-regulating ferritin expression in response to
oxidative stress in order to segregate cellular Fe2+ to prevent iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen species through the
Fenton reaction [4,16,17]. Further study is needed to
locate putative AREs expected to be found far upstream of
the dolphin ferritin subunit genes.

Conclusion
Sequence analyses of cetacean ferritin H and L subunits
were performed by direct sequencing of PCR fragments
from cDNAs generated via RT-PCR of leukocyte total RNA
prepared from blood samples of six different dolphin species (Pseudorca crassidens, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens,
Grampus griseus, Globicephala macrorhynchus, Tursiops truncatus, and Delphinapterus leucas). Dolphin H and L subunits consist of 182 and 174 amino acids, respectively, with
each subunit showing high sequence identity with the corresponding subunit of mammalian ferritin (H: 91–97%;
L: 78–91%). The putative iron-responsive element
sequence in the 5'-untranslated region of the six different
dolphin species was demonstrated by direct sequencing of
PCR fragments obtained using each leukocyte genomic
DNA.
