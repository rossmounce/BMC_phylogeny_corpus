Abstract
Background: Among the eutherian mammals, placental architecture varies to a greater extent
than any other tissue. The diversity of placental types, even within a single mammalian order
suggests that genes expressed in placenta are under strong Darwinian selection. Thus, the ruminant
placenta may be a rich source of genes to explore adaptive evolutionary responses in mammals.
The aim of our study was to identify novel transcripts expressed in ruminant placenta, and to
characterize them with respect to their expression patterns, organization of coding sequences in
the genome, and potential functions.
Results: A combination of bioinformatics, comparative genomics and transcript profiling was used
to identify and characterize 91 novel transcripts (NTs) represented in a cattle placenta cDNA
library. These NTs have no significant similarity to any non-ferungulate DNA or RNA sequence.
Proteins longer than 100 aa were predicted for 29 NTs, and 21 are candidate non-coding RNAs.
Eighty-six NTs were found to be expressed in one or more of 18 different tissues, with 39 (42%)
showing tissue-preference, including six that were expressed exclusively in placentome. The
authenticity of the NTs was confirmed by their alignment to cattle genome sequence, 42 of which
showed evidence of mRNA splicing. Analysis of the genomic context where NT genes reside
revealed 61 to be in intergenic regions, whereas 30 are within introns of known genes. The genes
encoding the NTs were found to be significantly associated with subtelomeric regions.
Conclusion: The 91 lineage-specific transcripts are a useful resource for studying adaptive
evolutionary responses of the ruminant placenta. The presence of so many genes encoding NTs in
cattle but not primates or rodents suggests that gene loss and gain are important mechanisms of
genome evolution in mammals. Furthermore, the clustering of NT genes within subtelomeric
regions suggests that such regions are highly dynamic and may foster the birth of novel genes. The
sequencing of additional vertebrate genomes with defined phylogenetic relationships will permit the
search for lineage-specific genes to take on a more evolutionary context that is required to
understand their origins and functions.

Background
The primary function of the placenta is to regulate the
transport of gases, nutrients and waste products between
mother and fetus [1]. The placenta also serves as an endocrine organ, producing estrogens, progesterone and placental lactogens that are important for the maintenance of
pregnancy [1]. While these functions have been conserved
in all eutherian mammals, the relatively large variation in
placental architecture [2] makes the placenta an attractive
model system for studying adaptive evolutionary changes
[3]. Placentae are classified on the basis of their gross
shape and the distribution of contact points between the
fetal tissues and the maternal endometrium [2]. The synepitheliochorial cotyledonary placenta of ruminants has three
distinct tissue layers and is regarded as the most complex
as compared to other placental types [2]. By contrast, in
the discoid hemochorial placenta of primates and rodents,
the fetal chorionic epithelium is directly bathed in maternal blood because the three maternal tissues layers are
degraded. The molecular basis for these anatomical
changes and their adaptive significance remain largely
unknown.
Recent studies demonstrating that phenotypic changes
with adaptive significance can be caused by the action of
individual genes provide an important rationale for the
identification of genes that may be highly divergent or
unique to a specific lineage or clade [eg, [4]]. Furthermore,
there is a relative abundance of novel or lineage-specific
transcripts (NTs) [5] and lineage-specific regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) [6-8] in the transcriptomes of different eukaryotes. However, little is known about the role
of divergent genes and lineage-specific transcripts in adaptive evolution. In ruminants, there is unequivocal evidence for lineage-specific and highly divergent genes
expressed in the placenta and/or trophoblast e.g., genes
encoding interferon-tau [9], the placental lactogens [10], the
pregnancy associated glycoproteins [11] and the prolactin
related proteins [12]. All of these highly divergent proteins
appear to play adaptive roles in the reproductive biology
of ruminants.
Given the unique adaptations of the reproductive system
of ruminants, our goal is to use comparative genomics to
identify genes and ncRNAs that are responsible for these
evolutionary changes. Toward that end, we recently developed a bioinformatics strategy to mine collections of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for divergent homologs
and novel transcripts [13]. This strategy led to the discovery of the ULBP gene cluster and eight divergent homologs
in cattle [12,14]. Herein, we describe the application and
extension of our approach for identifying and characterizing NTs expressed in mammalian tissues. Using this
approach, 91 NTs were identified in a collection of cattle
placenta ESTs and then verified by in silico extension with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/113

DNA sequences in the public domain databases, gene
expression profiling, and alignment to whole genome
sequence.

Results
Identification and characterization of novel transcripts in
cattle placenta
A collection of 12,614 5' ESTs from a cattle term placenta
cDNA library was reduced to a working set of 373 putative
NTs and divergent homologs using pairwise BLASTN [15]
searches against non-cetartiodactyl EST and genome databases (October 2005 freezes), followed by in silico extension and full-clone sequencing of cDNA inserts (Table 1).
Analysis of the sequence-extended EST-containing clones
using TBLASTX searches against human and mouse UniGene [16], and against ESTs from non-cetartiodactyl species, permitted the distinction of divergent (N = 75) from
unknown (N = 298) transcripts (Table 1). Repetition of in
silico extension of EST sequences followed by removal of
homologs using subsequently updated databases (April
2006 freezes) removed an additional 134 ESTs, thus leaving 164 putative NTs. Using the 6.2× Btau_2.0 cattle
genome assembly [17] as a reference, 73 transcripts were
found likely to represent priming from poly A tracts of
genomic DNA. These artifacts were subsequently
removed, bringing the final working set to 91 NTs that
have an average length of 993 bp (Table 1; Additional file
1). The definition of a transcript as novel thus indicates
that the nucleotide sequence or hypothetical proteins
encoded by it does not have similarity to any non-cetartiodactyl DNA or protein sequence at the time the databases were searched. The operational term is not meant to
imply an evolutionary mechanism, such as gene loss or
rapid divergence.

Alignment to the cattle genome sequence assembly
allowed polyA signals to be identified within 50 bp downstream from the end of the aligned NT. Polyadenylation
signals were found in 86/91 (95%) of the NTs (Additional
file 2). The consensus signal, AATAAA, was present in 54
(59%) of the NTs; 15 (16%) had the less conserved signal
ATTAAA, and 17 (19%) had rare polyadenylation signals
experimentally identified in human mRNA [18]. A polyadenylation signal was not detected in 5 (5%) of the NTs,
likely representing incomplete transcripts.
Analysis of the 91 NTs revealed 64 NTs with one or more
open reading frames (ORFs) >33 codons (Figure 1).
Among these 64 NTs there are 78 predicted ORFs >33
codons, all of which were considered as candidates for
encoding novel proteins (Figure 1; Additional file 3). The
cDNA clone with the longest ORF, BTC1_14RD, contains
235 codons. TBLASTN of the translated ORFs against all
predicted cattle transcripts resulted in 24 unique hits, of
which seven are to hypothetical proteins, 15 are to pre-

dicted proteins (having some supporting molecular evidence), and two have similarity to known cattle proteins
(Additional file 2). While all ORFs >33 codons terminate
in a stop codon, 19 (21%) do not possess an ATG start
codon, suggesting that at least some of the NTs represent
3' regions of genes or have ORFs with alternate start
codons. The ORFs possessing an ATG start codon were
analyzed for the presence of the Kozak consensus
sequence RMC-ATG-G, a signal for eukaryotic translation
initiation [19], where R is a purine and M is [AC]. One
ORF matched this consensus pattern and 24 ORFs
matched the less restricted Kozak pattern R-N-N-ATG-R,
where N is any nucleotide, and R is a purine.
Protein motifs are predicted in the translated ORFs of four
NTs (Additional file 2, Table 2). In addition, a transmembrane helix (TMH) was identified in one ORF
(BTC1_403NG) predicted to contain a single-span TMH.
Signal peptides are predicted in four ORFs with no concomitant TMH prediction (Additional file 2) thus indicating that these transcripts encode soluble/secreted
proteins. Functional elements located in untranslated
regions (UTRs) are predicted in 25 NTs (Additional file 2,
Table 2). The NT BTC1_43PW contains a predicted selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element. These elements are required for translation of the UGA codon as
selenocysteine in mRNAs of selenoproteins, several of
which are species-specific and participate in peroxide degradation and antioxidant reactions [20]. The UTR
sequence region corresponding to the SECIS prediction
was manually verified for the appropriate secondary structure (Additional file 4). Two sequences, BTC1_40PW and
BTC1_14RD, are predicted to contain conserved ncRNA
secondary structural elements within their 3' UTRs thus
implicating them in regulatory functions.

The GC-content average of the NTs, mRNAs and genomic
DNA sequence is 0.50 (range 0.33 to 0.7), 0.51, and 0.45,
respectively (Additional file 2). Ten percent of NTs have
low GC content average (<0.4) as compared to 12% of full
length mRNAs and 31% of genomic scaffold sequence
that contains the NTs. Candidate exonic CpG islands were
identified in 5' ends of four NTs (Table 3, Additional file
2). Criteria for CpG islands were length >200 bp, GC content ≥ 53% and observed/expected CpG ratio ≥ 0.63 [21].
Anchoring the NTs to the 6.2× draft cattle genome
sequence allowed the identification of 26 additional NTs
with CpG islands upstream of their start sites. Other NTs
with regulatory sequence features included 12 with
inverted repeats of at least 11 bp. The longest inverted
repeats are 18 bp and separated by approximately 300 bp.
In addition, 7 NTs contain G-quartets, which are tetrads of

guanine/purine tetramers that are implicated in transcription pausing, mRNA stability, recombination hotspots,
stability of chromosomes and interactions of telomeres
[reviewed in [22]].
Twenty-one NTs qualified as candidate ncRNAs (Table 3,
Additional file 2). These NTs have no ORF >33 codons,
and no predicted exon within 5 kb of flanking cattle
genome sequence. Among these, 20 contain a known
polyadenylation signal, of which seven are spliced, and 14
align to the genome sequence along the transcript's entire
length with >95% identity (Additional file 2).
Genomic context of the NTs
The genomic organization of the NT genes was determined by BLASTN against the 6.2× cattle genome draft
sequence. All 91 NTs have matches in the cattle genome
(Additional file 2), 49 of which have ≥98% identity over
>95% of their length and 48 have polyadenylation signals
(intronless transcripts). The remaining 42 NTs have welldefined intron-exon boundaries indicative of mRNA
splicing (an average of 3 exons), of which 40 possess a
polyadenylation signal (Table 4; Additional file 2). CpG
islands were located upstream of 16 of these 40 transcripts. Of the 91 NTs, 68 were mapped in silico to chromosome locations in the cattle genome on the basis of
existing radiation hybrid (RH) and comparative mapping
information [23] (Additional file 2). The remaining 23
were located on unmapped scaffolds. Among the 68
mapped NTs, 10 were located on BTA19 (P > 0.05). This
analysis also revealed that 61 (67%) of the NTs are located
within "intergenic" regions and 30 (33%) of the NTs are
within introns of known genes (Table 3, Additional file
2). Three of the NTs on BTA19 (BTC1_390NG,
BTC1_28PW, BTC1_8NG) were located within introns of
the developmentally regulated genes HOXB3, JAF1 and
ATP1a2a. In addition, 24 NTs (26%) are located either in

subtelomeric regions or at the boundaries of homologous
synteny blocks as defined by Everts van der Wind et al.
[23] (Table 3; Additional file 2). The distribution of NTs
was positively associated (P < 0.05) with the subtelomeric
regions (< 2 Mbp from telomere) as compared to the distribution of randomly chosen RefSeq genes.
Among the 91 NTs, 71 have no NCBI [24] annotation. The
20 annotated NTs that aligned to the cattle genome were
analyzed in greater detail. Each of them was found to have
a gene model and a cattle RefSeq identification number
(Additional file 2). Most appear to be either alternatively
spliced variants, antisense to the predicted genes, or long
and divergent 3' ends of predicted genes. The 20 annotated NTs were examined further by comparing full-length
mRNA sequence from the cattle RefSeq prediction to the
human genome. Similarity between the full-length cattle
RefSeq predictions and human genes was found only for
12 of the NT-containing RefSeq genes (BLASTN E value <
10-10). Among these 12 cattle RefSeq genes with putative
human orthologs, the NTs contained within them represent novel splice products, whereas three are novel antisense products. In silico comparative mapping confirmed
homologous positions within the cattle and human
genomes, thus providing additional supporting evidence
that these 12 NTs are part of highly divergent genes and/
or genes created de novo (Additional file 2).
It was also possible to predict locations where genes
encoding the NTs should be in the human genome (Additional file 2; Figures 2, 3, 4). This was accomplished by
identifying the cattle genome sequence flanking the NTs
with significant nucleotide similarity in the human
genome (although the NTs themselves did not match the
human genome using a BLASTN and TBLASTX E-value
threshold of 10-10). Anchoring the NTs to the human
genome using conserved flanking sequences revealed that
69% have an assumptive location in intergenic regions or
within an intron of a known human gene. The genomic
context for all 91 NTs is given in Additional file 2. A
detailed description of the genomic context of three NTs
is presented below. The number that can be presented is
limited by available space (all alignments can be found in
Additional file 5).
BTC1_14RD and BTC1_130FL: alternatively spliced mRNAs of a

BTC1_14RD (GenBank:XM_611254) and BTC1_130FL
have 93% and 92% nucleotide identity, respectively, to
artiodactyla-specific transcript 1 (Ast1) identified by Kim
and coworkers [25]. Neither gene has an ortholog in the
human or mouse genome. The three transcripts, Ast1,
BTC1_14RD and BTC1_130FL, were aligned to BAC
AC146804 (Figure 2; Additional file 6). Both BTC1_14RD
and BTC1_130FL mapped at position BTA18:55591560–

55600453, 5.4 kb from Ast1 (Figure 2). Genscan [26] also
predicts a cattle gene in this region, which is supported by
alignment of numerous cattle ESTs and a CpG island
flanking the transcription start site (Figure 2). From the
alignments it is apparent that BTC1_130FL is an alternatively spliced form of BTC1_14RD and that both transcripts represent a gene that is paralogous (>90% similar)
to Ast1 (Additional file 6). The assumptive human
genome context of BTC_14RD and BTC1_130FL was then
investigated by anchoring to the human genome, conserved sequences flanking the NTs in the cattle BAC
AC146804 (on BTA18). Nucleotide similarity was used to
anchor BTC1_14RD, BTC1_130FL and Ast1 mRNAs to
HSA19q, between the human genes ZNF71 and ZIM2
(Figure 2). This region of the human genome is rich in retrotransposed sequences, imprinted genes (PEG3 and
Zim2) and genes encoding zinc-finger proteins thus indicating a high level of evolutionary and biological activity.
BTC1_146JE: a putative non coding RNA
BTC1_146JE is a 2206 bp transcript that contains an
inverse repeat, and is found only in cattle and bottleneck
dolphin (cetartiodactyl-specific). There is no ORF and no
BLAST hit to any non-cetartiodactyl exon within 5 kb of
flanking genomic sequence 5' and 3' of the NT gene on
BTA21 (Figure 3; Table 3). A large number of unannotated, spliced cattle ESTs align to contig54150 in the same
position further supporting its characterization as a novel
spliced transcript.

The genomic DNA sequence flanking BTC1_146JE in
contig54150 permitted comparative anchoring to
HSA14q32.31 in an intergenic, non-conserved region
containing a cluster of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs;
Figure 3). These snoRNAs are encoded in the introns of
the non-coding maternally expressed gene MEG8 [27].
MEG8 is currently not included in the UCSC [28] database
of known genes and thus not shown in Figure 3. To test
the possibility that BTC1_146JE represents the pre-processed RNA for a snoRNA, a BLASTN search was carried out
using the cluster of snoRNAs as query sequences (word
size 7 and E-value threshold of 0.01). The 71 bp snoRNAs

14q(II-8) and 14q(11-9) [27] aligned with BTC1_146JE
with short matches (23/26 and 27/30 identities, respectively). This suggests that BTC1_146JE represents a precursor RNA from which a cetartiodactyl-specific snoRNA (or
miRNA) is processed.
BTC1_113FL: a novel transcript expressed preferentially in the
thalamus
BTC1_113FL (GenBank:XM_611248) is a 659 bp transcript found only in cattle. It encodes a hypothetical protein 69 aa in length and whose gene is located on BTA2
(Table 3). Alignment of BTC1_113FL to cattle
contig74653 reveals a gene with five exons (Figure 4). The
gene is located within 1.5 Kbp of the 3' end of and in
opposite orientation to SECP43. The presence of a gene in
this location is strongly supported by a large number of
spliced ESTs containing at least one GT/AG splice site, a
Genscan prediction of 2 exons, a CpG island that spans
the first exon and the probable transcription start site (Figure 4), and detection of expression in multiple tissues.
DNA sequence flanking the gene corresponding to
BTC1_113FL on contig74653 anchors it to HSA1p35.3,
consistent with the available comparative mapping data
[23]. Visual inspection indicates that BTC1_113FL should
fall in a region of the human genome occupied by
MGC45806 (GenBank:NM_152304), a RAB GTPase
oncogene involved in vesicle-trafficking; however,
BLASTN, TBLASTX and TBLASTN searches of BTC1_113FL
against MGC45806 sequence resulted in no significant
matches, demonstrating a lack of detectable homology
between the exons of the two transcripts. BLAT [28] alignment of this NT against the human genome also reveals
no alignment anywhere within the chromosome cytogenetic band where the NT is anchored by its flanking
sequence. These data provide evidence that BTC1_113FL
is a lineage-specific novel transcript.
Expression and tissue distribution of NTs
Expression levels of the NTs were analyzed in 17 tissues
from a one week-old Jersey calf and a term placentome.
Expression of 86/91 NTs could be analyzed (5 had no representative cDNA element on the microarray). The

expressed NTs were categorized with respect to the presence or absence of ORF(s) as well as with expression levels
classified as high, moderate or low on the basis of an arbitrary scale (Table 5). Among the 60 expressed NTs with
ORFs, 55% were expressed at a low level in all 18 tissues,
and 45% were expressed at moderate or high levels in one
or more tissues (Table 5). A similar distribution of expression levels in tissues was found among the NTs without
ORFs. Tissue-preference in expression patterns of NTs was
analyzed further by determining those NTs that were
expressed greater than two-fold in any one tissue compared to at least 13 out of 17 other tissues (Figure 5; Additional file 2). A total of 39 NTs show tissue preference in
their expression pattern. Of these, 28 were preferentially
expressed in a single tissue. Six NTs were preferentially
expressed in placentome, of which two were predicted to
be ncRNAs. Ten different tissues showed exclusive expression of one or more of the NTs, with placentome and thymus having the largest number.

Discussion
Comparative genomics, bioinformatics and microarray
analysis were used to identify 91 transcripts encoded in
the cattle genome, but not encoded in the genomes of
non-ferungulate mammals (see further discussion below
concerning the dog genome). The yield of NTs from the
original EST collection is 91/12,614 = 0.8%, suggesting
that NTs are relatively rare. Among the 91 NTs, 78 ORFs
were identified, of which 48 are <100 codons and 30 are
>100 codons (Figure 1; Additional file 3). The latter have
a high probability of coding for a protein [29]. Using
InterProScan [30], the lack of Pfam HMM matches for
99% of NT ORFs is strong evidence for absence of homology to known proteins. Anchoring the NTs to the cattle
genome allowed identification of 30 transcripts having
CpG islands upstream of their start sites (Additional file
2), providing additional support for their classification as
protein-coding genes or ncRNAs. Specific protein functional motifs were identified in 10 predicted proteins
encoded by the NTs, and 29 have functional non-coding
motifs (Table 2; Additional file 2). All but five of the NTs
showed evidence of active transcription in one or more
tissues, and six were found to be preferentially expressed
in cattle placentome, which is the source tissue of the EST
collection used to mine for NTs. These results collectively
provide the first conclusive evidence for an abundance of
lineage- and tissue-specific transcripts encoded in the cattle genome.

The 21 NTs identified as high-probability ncRNAs provide
a useful set of probes for exploring gene regulation in placental development and function [5,6]. Five of the putative ncRNAs are preferentially expressed in tissues that
comprise the brain-immune-endocrine axis; placentome,
thymus, thalamus, cerebrum or cerebellum. Seven contain inverted repeats that may be involved in internal
base-pairing and gene regulation [31]. These putative
ncRNAs may thus represent spliced, single-exon, primary
snoRNA or microRNA transcripts [6]. Although microRNAs (miRNAs), snoRNAs and other ncRNAs that are not
polyadenylated, may have been filtered out using our
methods, on the basis of our findings, it is clear that placenta is a rich source of ncRNAs. Further studies are
needed to clarify their functions in placental physiology.
The availability of a draft of the cattle genome sequence
provided an opportunity to study the comparative
genomic organization of the NTs, to confirm their authenticity, and to distill evidence for their origin, evolution
and function. For the examples presented, as well as others in the dataset, the genes encoding the NTs are flanked
by genes that are conserved in the human genome. This
allowed us to identify a presumptive human genome context for the NTs. The recent availability of a 7.6× draft of
the dog genome sequence allowed us to ask ex post facto
whether the NTs are present in the dog genome. It was
interesting to find that only five of the NTs (BTC_55FL,
BTC1_102FL,
BTC1_390NG,
BTC1_21PW,
and
BTC1_40RD) matched sequences in the dog genome, suggesting that the sequences encoding these NTs were
present in a ferungulate ancestor. The most parsimonious
explanation for the presence of NTs in the cattle genome
but not in other non-ferungulate mammalian genomes is
that the NT genes were deleted from a common ancestor
of primates and rodents after its divergence from the ferungulates (assuming that these five NTs will be found in
other ferungulate genomes as well). Thus, in total, 65 NTs
were identified that are (to date) only found in cattle, and
21 were identified in cattle and other cetartiodactyla
(Table 4). Among the ruminants, this could represent the
de novo formation of genes by overprinting [32], more
recent gene deletion, extreme divergence, or the lack of
complete genome sequence information for the other species. Other proposed mechanisms for the appearance of
lineage-specific genes, such as retrotransposition
[reviewed in [33]], are not excluded by our analysis. Further study of the phylogenetic distribution of the NT genes
will provide a better understanding of their origin, and the
timing of gene loss/gain in ancestral species.
The cetartiodactyl NTs BTC1_14RD and BTC1_130FL represent interesting examples of transcripts that are encoded
within a highly dynamic genomic context (Figure 2).
BTC1_14RD/BTC1_130FL and Ast1 (artiodactyl-specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/113

transcript1) are located in a region of the cattle genome
that is surrounded by genes encoding zinc-finger proteins.
Ast1 and its neighboring genes, PEG3 and ZIM2, were previously shown to undergo lineage-specific imprinting,
and PEG3 and ZIM2 are thought to have undergone rearrangements independently in different lineages [25].
Roughly 80 Kbp of the cattle genome between PEG3 and
ZIM2 (BTA18:55,580 Kbp – 55,655 Kbp) spanning
BTC1_14RD and Ast1 is absent in the human genome,
and there are a large number of segmental duplications in
this region. The entire locus maps ~1 Mbp from the telomere of BTA18. It is known that telomeric and subtelomeric regions are highly active in segmental duplications
and the formation of novel genes [34]. Thus, the artiodactyl-specific genes for Ast1 and BTC1_14RD appear to have
been created by a segmental duplication. Analysis of other
ferungulate genomes will shed greater light on the origin
and evolution of these interesting genes. Given their
genomic context and imprinting status these genes may
play an adaptive role in placental function.
The significant number of novel transcripts expressed
preferentially in cattle placenta and in other tissues raises
the question of their role in adaptive evolution. Are the
genes encoding these transcripts lost in other genomes
because they are dispensable or do they have adaptive
evolutionary significance? Is gene gain by insertion, segmental duplication and/or chromosome duplication a
driving mechanism of adaptive evolution? Evolutionary
theory has long held that adaptive phenotypic change is
realized through changes in developmental processes
[35]. The genes that control these developmental processes are known to be highly conserved [36] and it is
believed that adaptive evolutionary change is fueled by
mutations that modify the expression of these conserved
regulatory loci [36,37]. We and others have proposed that
rapidly evolving genes, "novel" or lineage-specific genes,
and ncRNAs play a role in mediating changes in gene
expression that affect regulatory genes controlling fundamental developmental processes [13,38-40]. Lineage-specific genes can appear as a result of non-homologous
recombination of exons between different genes [32,4143], or from fast-evolving duplicated genes that have lost
significant sequence similarity even within relatively short
evolutionary time-spans [44,45]. Keese and Gibbs [32]
provided numerous examples of genes that are created de
novo by translation of previously unused reading frames of
existing coding and non-coding genomic DNA, a mechanism that has been called "overprinting" [46,47]. Each of
the NTs has its own evolutionary history, and understanding their origins will require sequence information from
additional mammalian genomes. Whether they are rapidly evolving and dispensable [48] and/or have adaptive
functions can only be determined by experimentation
[37].

Conclusion
The 91 lineage-specific transcripts discovered in the
present study are a new resource for studies of adaptive
changes in placental architecture and function. The tissue
distribution of the NTs suggests that many of them also
have adaptive roles in other tissues. The presence of so
many lineage-specific genes in cattle and their association
with subtelomeric regions, which are hotspots for chromosome rearrangements and recombination, suggests
that gene loss and gain are important mechanisms of
genome evolution in mammals. The sequencing of additional vertebrate genomes with defined phylogenetic relationships will enable the search for lineage-specific genes
to take on a more evolutionary perspective that is required
to understand their origins and functions.

Methods
Identification and characterization of novel transcripts
expressed in cattle placenta
A collection of 12,614 5' ESTs from a normalized and subtracted cattle placenta cDNA library was selected as an EST
resource for novel transcript discovery [49]. The repeatmasked ESTs were analyzed for similarity to non-cetartiodactyl ESTs and genomic sequences using BLASTN [15] at
a threshold E (expectation value) <10-05, and NCBI dbEST
and non-redundant DNA sequence databases from which
cetartiodactyl sequences were removed. All ESTs that
matched non-cetartiodactyl sequences at E < 10-05 were
removed from the starting set (Table 1). Another BLASTN
search against human draft sequences at E < 10-10 removed
additional ESTs from the set. The entire process of searching, parsing, and subtraction was carried out iteratively
with a set of pipelined Perl scripts (PipeBLASTN).

PipeBLASTN was followed by in silico extension of the
remaining placenta ESTs using public domain cattle ESTs.
The ESTs were extended using a custom clustering algorithm and the CAP3 [50] assembly program. The clusters
were created using stringent parameters (minimum overlap length of 40 bp and 95% minimum sequence identity). CAP3 was run with default parameters, on each EST
cluster. The in silico extended ESTs were run through PipeBLASTN again to remove any non-cetartiodactyl
homologs. The in-house source clones of the remaining 5'
extended ESTs were sequenced in the 3' direction using an
anchored oligodT primer. The 3' ESTs were vector- and
quality-trimmed, repeat-masked, and assembled to their
5' extended counterparts to obtain full-length clone
sequences. Those 5'-3' pairs that did not overlap were subjected to additional rounds of primer-walking until complete sequences were obtained.
To extend the newly assembled sequences further the
process of clustering and assembly with public domain
cattle ESTs followed by PipeBLASTN was carried out again

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/113

to yield a set of putative NTs and divergent orthologs. The
assembled sequences were manually edited and proofed
for spurious assemblies, un-called bases, and reverse-complementarity. The divergent homologs were separated
from the putative NTs by interrogating the sequences for
distant homology in other species using BLASTX against
non-redundant proteins (NCBI, April 2006), and
TBLASTX against human and mouse UniGene (Build 190
and 152, respectively) and ESTs from other species (NCBI,
April 2006). Sequences that aligned to database sequences
below an empirically chosen E-value threshold of 10-10
were designated as putative divergent homologs [12], and
those that scored above this threshold were designated
NTs. The NTs with similarity to cetartiodactyl-specific
genes were identified by BLAST against a database of
cetartiodactyl-specific non-redundant sequences and
ESTs. Sequence data from this article have been deposited

accession numbers are listed in Additional file 2.
The second assembly (March 2005, Btau_2.0; BCMHGSC) of the 6.2× cow genome draft sequence [17] was
used to determine how many NT source clones were
primed from an internal polyA tract during their sequencing from the 3' direction with an anchored oligodT
primer. To do this, each NT contig was manually checked
to ensure the terminal positioning of the 3' EST within the
contig. The NTs were then aligned to the scaffold
sequence. The aligned region of the scaffold and flanking
100 bp was extracted for each of the aligned NTs. If the 3'
EST of a NT was primed by an internal polyA tract, it
would be visible in the scaffold downstream from the 3'
end of the aligned NT. These NTs were removed from the
set. In addition, trimming of low-quality sequences from
3' ESTs may have resulted in complete or partial removal
of the polyadenylation signal. Each of the corresponding
scaffold sequences was scanned for the presence of a polyadenylation signal within 50 bp downstream from the
end of an aligned NT.
Identification and characterization of ORFs
High-probability ORFs were identified in the NTs using
NCBI's ORFfinder [51]. The locations of start and stop signals were determined in all the three reading frames for
NTs with a known polyadenylation signal, and in all six
reading frames for NTs with no identifiable polyadenylation signal. The most probable complete or longest partial
ORFs were selected using a threshold length of 100 bp.
The manual analysis of all the six reading frames involved
choosing the longest ORF that either contained more than
one downstream stop codon, or one or more juxtaposed
downstream start and stop signals within 20 codons of
each other. The selected ORF contained at most two
upstream stop signals, and one upstream ORF < 30
codons in length. The use of a six-frame analysis to select

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:113

ORFs that were clearly demarcated by strong start and stop
signals helped to reduce the probability of picking false
ORFs even though we used 33 codons as a threshold. The
complete ORFs that had a start and a stop codon were analyzed for the presence of the Kozak consensus, the eukaryotic translation start site context [19]. False positives in
ORFs were predicted by randomizing the NT and then
predicting ORFs in these sequences using the same rules
for ORF prediction [52]. Because ORFS between 33 and
100 codons are predicted to have ~50% false positive rate
[52], all ORFs >33 codons were considered as candidates
for encoding small novel proteins. The sequences of the
NTs and their predicted proteins can be found in Additional files 1 and 3.
The ORFs were analyzed for protein motifs and domains
using InterProScan [30]. Only those motifs with a precision rate >93% were reported [53]. Additionally, ORFs
were searched for transmembrane helices using
TMHMMv2.0 [54] and SVMtm [55], and for signal peptides using SignalP with both neural networks and hidden
Markov models [56]. Conflicting predictions of a signal
peptide and a transmembrane region in the same
sequence were resolved as follows: i) if the prediction was
within 15 codons from the 5' end then the prediction was
counted as a signal peptide; ii) if the signal peptide was
predicted anywhere else, Phobius [57] was used to confirm
either prediction.
The ORFs were searched for novel repeated protein
domains using the methodology and software described
by Yeats et al. [58]. Prospero was used to self-search the
ORFs for occurrence of internal duplications. Alignments
with a length of less than 30 residues (threshold length of
a protein domain) were removed. To search for repeated
domains, alignments in which the start points of each
sub-sequence were separated by less than 45 residues were
discarded. The alignments generated by Prospero were
used as an initial alignment to make profile Hidden
Markov models using HMMER [59], and the resulting
alignments were scanned against the Swiss-Prot database.
Characterization of non-coding regions
The NT sequences were scanned for functional UTR elements using UTRScan [60]. To identify UTR elements that
may occur in NTs by chance, the NTs were randomized
using the program shuffle in SQUID software [61], and
searched for motifs using UTRScan. This was repeated 10
times. The observed frequency of a motif was compared to
that found in the randomized NT sequences. The motif
was reported if its observed frequency was at least 4 times
greater in the NTs as in the randomized NT sequences. The
GC-content of each sequence was estimated with the program geecee from the EMBOSS suite [62]. Candidate CpG
islands in 5' exons and non-coding regions were identified

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/113

by aligning NTs to the cattle genome. The aligned scaffold
region and 200 bp upstream from the start of the alignment were extracted. These sequences were searched with
the command-line version of CpG Island Searcher [21]
using a minimum CpG island length of 200 bp, minimum
GC-content of 53%, and observed/expected CpG ratio of
0.63. The choice of parameter values was based on the
averages found by Takai and Jones [21] for exonic CpG
islands. Additionally, each NT sequence was searched
against itself to identify IRs and confirmed independently
using the einverted program [62].
The NTs were analyzed for guanine-rich sequence motifs
capable of forming three-dimensional structures called Gquadruplexes or G-quartets [22]. On the basis of the algorithm by D'Antonio and Bagga [63], a program was written to identify the G-quartet motif in the NTs. The results
were compared with results obtained using shuffled
sequences as a control. QRNA [64] was used to search for
conserved ncRNA structures amongst the NTs. The input
to QRNA was a file containing the search results from a
BLASTN of NTs against the non-redundant DNA sequence
database. Default parameters were used, and the results
were compared with another run of QRNA using shuffled
data as a control.
Microarray expression analysis
The gene expression data for the NTs was extracted from a
larger microarray data set obtained by profiling total RNA
from 17 different tissues collected by vivisection of a one
week-old Jersey calf (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
series entry GSE3029) and term placentome. Expression
patterns were obtained using a microarray containing
approximately 7000 cattle placenta cDNAs spotted in
duplicate on glass slides [65]. The expression profiles for
each tissue were obtained by comparing expression of
each gene to a reference standard comprised of RNAs from
bovine brain and three different cell lines [65]. In order
for a gene to be included in the analysis, its fluorescence
intensity had to be greater than three standard deviations
(SD) above the background in either the sample or reference standard. All but five of the NTs were represented on
this array by a cDNA clone.

The NTs were further categorized based on their fluorescence intensity values. Expression was considered as
"high" if the fluorescence intensity was greater than 5000
+3SD above background in at least one tissue, "moderate"
if fluorescence intensity was between 1000 and 5000 in at
least one tissue, and "low" if the fluorescence intensity
was between 50 and 1000 +3SD above background in all
18 tissues.
To determine the number of transcripts that were preferentially expressed in the eighteen tissues, the ratio of the

Page 12 of 15

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:113

normalized intensity ratio was calculated for every pair of
tissues (ratio-of-ratios) using a Perl script. For a transcript
to be considered as preferentially expressed in a given tissue t, the following relationship had to hold true in at
least 13 out of 17 other tissues:
R (t)/R (any other tissue) > 2,
where R is the normalized intensity ratio (tissue:reference).
Analysis of the cattle and assumptive human genome
context of NTs
The number of NTs with matches in the cattle genome and
those showing evidence of splicing were determined using
a BLASTN search against all cattle genome sequences,
including the draft assembly (March 2005, Btau_2.0,
BCM-HGSC; and NCBI BACs). The NTs having evidence
of "split matches" were analyzed using est2genome [62] in
order to determine exon-intron boundaries. An NT was
classified as spliced if, after alignment to genomic
sequence, the intron-exon boundary had a GT/AG splice
site.

To identify candidate ncRNAs amongst the NTs that
lacked an ORF, the NTs were aligned to the cattle genome
assembly. Whenever possible, the aligned region and 5 kb
of flanking sequences was extracted from each of the
aligned scaffolds. The extracted region was searched for
the presence of exons by doing a BLASTX search against
Swiss-Prot and non-redundant protein databases using an
E-value threshold of 10-03. All NTs that lacked an ORF and
aligned to sequence scaffolds with no BLASTX hits were
characterized as candidate ncRNAs.
The NTs were mapped in silico to the cattle genome using
BLASTN search of the NTs against the cattle genome
assembly and repeat-masked cattle genome scaffolds
(March 2005, Btau_2.0, BCM-HGSC). The scaffolds containing the NTs were searched for similarity to the human
genome, (NCBI Build 35; E < 10-05). The chromosome
number, start and end positions, and orientation were
parsed for the top human BLASTN hit to the cattle assembly sequences (Additional file 5). Custom tracks were generated using these data, and loaded onto the UCSC
Genome Browser [66,28]. Using the cattle-human comparative map [23] also available on the UCSC Human
Genome Browser, the position of the NTs on cattle chromosomes could be accurately placed. The cattle-human
comparative map was also used to identify NTs that were
located within 1 Mbp of evolutionary breakpoints, and
within 2 Mbp of telomeres. The distribution of the 91 NTs
was compared to the distribution of 91 random RefSeq
genes by simulation as performed by Murphy et al. [67].
Chi-square test was performed to determine if NTs are
associated with subtelomeric regions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/113

In order to estimate where the genes encoding the NTs
would be if they were present in the human genome, conserved sequences in cattle contigs flanking each NT were
used to anchor them in the human genome. The orientation and distance of the NT in the cattle assembly was
used to juxtapose the NT in the human genome sequence.
The annotation of each NT in the cattle and human
genomes can be found in Additional file 2.

Note added in proof
The authors recognize that the annotation of the 91 NTs
may change with updated versions of RefSeq and other
genome databases. A table containing updates to the
annotation of these sequences will be available at the Laboratory of Mammalian Genome Biology website [68].
