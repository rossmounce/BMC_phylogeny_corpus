A general scenario of Hox gene inventory
variation among major sarcopterygian lineages
Dan Liang1†, Riga Wu1†, Jie Geng1, Chaolin Wang2, Peng Zhang1*

Abstract
Background: Hox genes are known to play a key role in shaping the body plan of metazoans. Evolutionary
dynamics of these genes is therefore essential in explaining patterns of evolutionary diversity. Among extant
sarcopterygians comprising both lobe-finned fishes and tetrapods, our knowledge of the Hox genes and clusters
has largely been restricted in several model organisms such as frogs, birds and mammals. Some evolutionary gaps
still exist, especially for those groups with derived body morphology or occupying key positions on the tree of life,
hindering our understanding of how Hox gene inventory varied along the sarcopterygian lineage.
Results: We determined the Hox gene inventory for six sarcopterygian groups: lungfishes, caecilians, salamanders,
snakes, turtles and crocodiles by comprehensive PCR survey and genome walking. Variable Hox genes in each of
the six sarcopterygian group representatives, compared to the human Hox gene inventory, were further validated
for their presence/absence by PCR survey in a number of related species representing a broad evolutionary
coverage of the group. Turtles, crocodiles, birds and placental mammals possess the same 39 Hox genes. HoxD12 is
absent in snakes, amphibians and probably lungfishes. HoxB13 is lost in frogs and caecilians. Lobe-finned fishes,
amphibians and squamate reptiles possess HoxC3. HoxC1 is only present in caecilians and lobe-finned fishes. Similar
to coelacanths, lungfishes also possess HoxA14, which is only found in lobe-finned fishes to date. Our Hox gene
variation data favor the lungfish-tetrapod, turtle-archosaur and frog-salamander relationships and imply that the
loss of HoxD12 is not directly related to digit reduction.
Conclusions: Our newly determined Hox inventory data provide a more complete scenario for evolutionary
dynamics of Hox genes along the sarcopterygian lineage. Limbless, worm-like caecilians and snakes possess similar
Hox gene inventories to animals with less derived body morphology, suggesting changes to their body
morphology are likely due to other modifications rather than changes to Hox gene numbers. Furthermore, our
results provide basis for future sequencing of the entire Hox clusters of these animals.

Background
The Hox genes are a large family of homeobox-containing transcription factors that control morphologies on
the body axis of nearly all metazoans. Most of Hox genes
normally consist of two exons with the conserved 180-bp
homeobox located in exon2. In many animal species, Hox
genes are arranged in genomic clusters with up to 15 distinct gene members [1] and, importantly, they are
expressed in a “collinear fashion” – anterior genes are
expressed early in development and towards the front

part of the embryo, posterior genes later in development
and in more distal portions of the embryo [2]. Due to
their important roles involved in patterning the anteriorposterior axis, modifications in Hox clusters might manifest in changes in the corresponding body regions; thus
serve as a source of genetic innovations in shaping the
diversification of metazoan body plans [3].
Because Hox genes are of particular interest in understanding the genetic basis of morphological evolution of
metazoans, they are frequently among the first genes examined in an evolutionary context. Also Hox clusters have
been characterized in a variety of animal species. Among
chordates, the cephalochordate amphioxus possesses a
single intact Hox gene cluster with 15 members [1];

in urochordate tunicates, the single cluster is secondarily
broken and dispersed in the genome [4]. In contrast to
these invertebrate chordates, primitive jawless vertebrates
(lamprey and hagfish) possess three to seven Hox clusters,
most probably through independent cluster duplications in
the agnathan lineage [5-7]. Jawed vertebrates also have
multiple clusters resulting from several rounds of genomeduplication events that occurred early in the evolution of
vertebrates and some specific lineages. There are three or
four clusters in chondrichthyans [8-10], four clusters in
lobe-finned fishes [11-13] and tetrapods [14,15], up to
eight in ray-finned fishes [16-20] and ~14 in tetraploid salmonid species [21]. The variations in vertebrate Hox clusters reflect a history of duplications and subsequent
lineage-specific gene loss and can serve as models for studies of vertebrate genome evolution (reviewed by [14,22]).
For the sarcopterygian lineage (lobe-finned fishes plus
tetrapods), all of its members investigated to date bear
four clusters (HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD) but the
number of gene members varies among different groups.
Mammals possess 39 Hox genes. For birds, a recent
report on genomic annotation of Hox clusters in chicken
[23] deduced that birds may have the same Hox gene
inventory to mammals but two genes (HoxC4 and
HoxC5) are still missing due to the incompleteness of
the chicken genome. In silico survey of frog (Xenopus
tropicalis) [14] and lizard (Anolis carolinensis) [15]
revealed the persistence of HoxC3 (lost in mammals) in
both species, but two genes (HoxB13 and HoxD12) are
thought to have been lost in anuran amphibians. Recent
relevant studies have further reported that the absence
of HoxB13 in frogs also occurs in caecilians, and the
loss of HoxD12 in frogs also happens in salamanders,
caecilians [24] and snakes [25]. Most recently, the complete Hox clusters of the Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis), an early-branching sarcopterygian,
have been sequenced [13]. Compared to the tetrapod
lineage, the coelacanth possesses 42 Hox genes in total,
lacking HoxD13, but retaining the four genes (HoxC1,
HoxC3, HoxB10, and HoxA14) which were secondarily
lost in mammals.
However, our knowledge of the Hox genes and clusters along the sarcopterygian lineage remains incomplete
because data from some major groups are still missing
(illustrated in Figure 1). For example, it is curious to see
whether lungfishes possess Hox14 and lost HoxD13 in
their genomes (available data is rather incomplete, see
[11]) as coelacanths. On the other hand, a “snake-like”
morphology (limblessness and elongated body) repeatedly occurs in different groups of amphibians and reptiles, such as snakes, caecilians and some legless lizards.
There were published reports suggesting the “snakelike” body morphology may be due to altered expression
of Hox genes [25-27]. Comparative analyses on the Hox

and reptile groups is either incomplete or missing.

clusters among these special groups should be able to
provide further hints on how such expression alterations
happen. For sequencing of the Hox clusters, a framework investigation of Hox gene inventory in these
groups (snakes, caecilians, et al.) is needed.
PCR surveys have demonstrated their value for preliminary identification of Hox genes in various animals
[6,11,12,24]. However, PCR surveys of Hox genes often
encounter a bias of the preference of degenerate primers
and therefore, the actual number of existing genes is
underestimated [6,24]. To circumvent this problem, we
designed at least two sets of degenerated primers

Liang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/25

targeting a given Hox gene member, which increased the
probability of successful amplification. Furthermore,
when possible, we selected at least two species that span
a broad evolutionary range for each tested groups, for
which the primer preference may be different, maximizing the probability of finding all genes for a group. By
adopting the two strategies, we carried out a comprehensive PCR survey for Hox genes in caecilians, salamanders, snakes, turtles, crocodiles, and lungfishes-the
only other group of extant lobe-finned fishes beside coelacanths. We aimed to provide a more comprehensive
understanding of Hox cluster evolution within the sarcopterygian lineage and present a general picture of Hox
gene inventory variation among different sarcopterygian
groups.

Results and Discussion
Amplification and Identification of Hox gene fragments

For each of the six sarcopterygian species examined, we
tried different combinations of the degenerate primers,
some targeted to several paralogue groups (PGs), some
to specific groups and others to specific gene members,
to amplify the homeobox-encoding region or exon1 of
Hox genes (Table 1). We did several rounds of PCR first
using “general” degenerate primers, and then using
more specific primers designed for paralogue groups or
gene members that were not found in the initial survey.
A total of 3876 PCR fragments (80 to 165 bp long,
depending on the primers used) were cloned and
sequenced. Detailed information about the library construction and screening efficiency for the six sarcopterygian species and other relevant species is listed in the
Additional file 1: Statistics of the sequenced clones.
Occasionally, two sequences were found differing in
only one to three nucleotides. When the nucleotide variations belong to synonymous substitutions and each of
these sequences was present in more than one clone,
they were considered as allelic variants. Conversely,
non-synonymous substitutions of one or two nucleotides
in only one clone but not the others of the same fragment were regarded as PCR or sequencing errors and
excluded from further analyses.
Initial BLAST searches in GenBank indicated that
82.9-96.5% sequenced clones belonged to Hox fragments, depending on the animal species examined. This
result demonstrated the utility and efficiency of our
newly designed Hox survey primers across most sarcopterygian lineages. Based on the phylogenetic analyses at
the protein level, we can unambiguously assign 70-75%
of the obtained homeobox sequences to exact Hox gene
members. The phylogenetic signals in protein alignments of Hox2, Hox6-8 were especially weak so that the
phylogenetic analyses at the nucleic acid level were performed to putatively distinguish Hox members for these

Page 3 of 13

paralogue groups. Using this strategy, we were able to
determine the orthology of all obtained Hox fragments.
To test the credibility of our assignment of putative Hox
fragments based on the nucleic acid phylogenetic analyses,
we chose two species (Naja atra and Ichthyophis bannanicus) to perform the TAIL-PCR-based genome walking to
get the 3’ flanking sequences of their putative Hox6-8
fragments. The newly obtained sequences were compared
with known sarcopterygian Hox genes, and all the assignments were verified.
Hox gene inventories of different animal groups
Lungfishes

Protopterus annectens, the African lungfish, was found
to have a total of 42 Hox genes orthologous to genes of
the four coelacanth Hox clusters. Generally the Hox
inventory of the African lungfish is quite similar to that
of the coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis) [13], for
example, they both possess HoxC1, HoxC3 and HoxB10;
but interestingly the African lungfish lacks HoxD12
while the coelacanth has no HoxD13. Moreover, because
the coelacanth has a HoxA14 gene and chondrichthyans
have a HoxD14 gene [9,10] but all tetrapod species
examined so far lack Hox-14, we wonder if Hox14 member also exist in lungfishes and/or the basal tetrapod
lineage, i.e. caecilians. To this end, an 84-bp-fragment
conserved only in Hox14 was tested by PCR in the
African lungfish and the Banna caecilian and only the
African lungfish gave the band with expected size, suggesting that Hox14 may have been lost in all tetrapods.
However, no further assignment could be made for the
lungfish Hox14 fragment because of its short size. We
thus performed genome walking towards both ends of
this Hox14 fragment and got full sequence of the exon2
of the lungfish Hox14. Using the lamprey Hox14 alpha
as outgroup, phylogenetic analysis unambiguously
assigned the lungfish’s Hox14 member as a HoxA14
(Figure 2). Among all vertebrates investigated to date,
only the coelacanths and the lungfishes which represent
the only two groups of the extant lobe-finned fish possess HoxA14. Thus, HoxA14 seems to be characteristic
of the lobe-finned fish Hox repertoire.
Caecilians

In the Banna caecilian (Ichthyophis bannanicus) 39
unique Hox gene fragments were found. Besides the
core set of Hox genes (using mammals’ as reference), we
identified a HoxC1 fragment as well as a HoxC3 fragment in the Banna caecilian. The presence of HoxC1 in
caecilians was further validated by screening the Hox1
library (see the Additional file 1: Statistics of the
sequenced clones) in Gymnopis multiplicata, a representative of derived caecilians. Because HoxC3 was also
found in the frog (Xenopus tropicalis; [15]) and the salamander (our survey, see below), it seems that all living

amphibians retain HoxC3. Therefore we did not perform
further survey for HoxC3 in other caecilian species. In
addition, after having tried different combinations of
primers, we could not find fragments of HoxD12 and
HoxB13 in the three tested caecilian species (I. bannanicus, G. multiplicata, and Typhlonectes natans; see the
Additional file 1: Statistics of the sequenced clones)
which is consistent with the loss of HoxD12 and
HoxB13 in caecilians previously reported by Mannaert
et al. [24].
Salamanders

Compared with other animal groups, surveying the Hox
gene inventory for salamanders was more difficult. We
tried several species but in none of them could we find
more than thirty-three Hox genes. In order to give a
more integrated Hox gene inventory of salamanders, we
combined the results from two species (Batrachuperus
tibetanus and Pachytriton brevipes) to represent the
group. Initial PCR survey of homeobox fragments in
Batrachuperus tibetanus, the Tibetan mountain salamander, identified 33 Hox gene fragments after sequencing over 770 clones. Compared with the frog Hox
complement, HoxA1, HoxA3, HoxD3, HoxB6, HoxB7
and HoxA10 were missing. The missing Hox genes were
further surveyed in another salamander Pachytriton brevipes and two more Hox members (HoxA1 and HoxA10)
were detected after sequencing 220 clones. To validate
the potential presence of the remaining Hox members,
we turned to detect their respective exon1s and finally
fragments of HoxA3, HoxD3, HoxB6 and HoxB7 were
found. Consistent with the previous reports of the

presence of HoxB13 in salamandrids [24] and ambystomatids [Genbank: AF298184], we identified HoxB13 in
the more basal hynobiid salamander (B. tibetanus), suggesting the presence of HoxB13 is likely a universal feature of all salamanders. Likewise, we did not detect
HoxD12 in all salamanders investigated (see the Additional file 1: Statistics of the sequenced clones), in accordance with the previous survey result [24]. Altogether,
salamanders have 39 Hox genes with the presence of
HoxC3 and absence of HoxD12 and unlike the other
two amphibian groups, salamanders possess HoxB13.
Frogs

The genomic architecture of Hox clusters of the frog
(Xenopus tropicalis, a diploid frog species) has been previously reported [15] but HoxB7 was not detected in its
genome due to a sequencing gap. However, HoxB7
mRNA was cloned in another frog (Xenopus laevis;
accession: NM_001085641), indicating that frogs possess
HoxB7 gene. In total, frogs have 38 Hox genes, lacking
HoxB13 and HoxD12, but retaining HoxC3.
Lizards and Snakes

Di-Poï et al. [15] analyzed the genome data of the green
anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis) and reported that
lizards have 40 Hox gene with an additional HoxC3 gene
which is absent in mammals. However, HoxB13 and
HoxD9 were only deduced genes in their study, not
directly detected due to some sequencing gaps. We reanalyzed the flanking sequences of these gaps and identified fragments orthologous to HoxB13 (exon2) and
HoxD9 (exon1), improving the completeness of lizards’
Hox gene inventory.

Liang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/25

For snakes, we found 39 unique Hox sequences in the
Chinese cobra (Naja atra). Like lizards, snakes also have
a HoxC3 gene. To see if the presence of HoxC3 is a
characteristic of all squamates, we further surveyed the
Hox-3 genes in two other squamate species: gecko
(Hemidactylus bowringii) and blind skink (Dibamus
bourreti), belonging to two basal squamate groups Gekkonidae and Dibamidae, respectively. As a result, fragments of HoxC3 were unambiguously identified in the
two species (see the Additional file 1: Statistics of the
sequenced clones), suggesting all squamates should possess HoxC3.
Despite HoxD12 having been annotated in the green
anole lizard, we did not detect HoxD12 fragment in the
Chinese cobra after screening the Hox12 libraries constructed with different primer pairs. Absence of HoxD12
has just been reported in the corn snake recently [25].
Since both the Chinese cobra and the corn snake belong
to derived snakes, to further test if HoxD12 is absent in
all snakes, we surveyed Hox12 in two other snakes:
blind snake (Leptotyphlops blanfordii) and ball python
(Python regius) which occupy more basal positions on
the Serpentes tree and might be able to circumvent the
Hox12-specific primer bias if there were any. As a result,
only HoxC12 fragment could be found in these two
snakes as well (see the Additional file 1: Statistics of the
sequenced clones). Therefore, it is likely that snakes
have lost HoxD12.
Turtles

Pelodiscus sinensis, which is also known as the Chinese
soft-shell turtle, was found to have 39 Hox genes, lacking HoxC3 compared with lizards. Since the squamate
reptiles investigated so far have retained HoxC3, we
wondered if the missing of HoxC3 in turtles was due to
primer bias. So we surveyed Hox3 genes in another four
turtles: the yellow-spotted Amazon river turtle (Podocnemis unifilis), the pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys
insculpta), the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) and the
red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), which were
particularly selected to represent a broad evolutionary
coverage for turtles. As a result, no fragments of HoxC3
could be identified (see the Additional file 1: Statistics of
the sequenced clones), which is consistent with the loss
of HoxC3 in turtles.
Crocodiles

For the Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis), most
Hox genes were found as expected using the chicken
Hox gene inventory [23] as reference. However, only
one homeobox fragment was retrieved for Hox2 which
usually contains two members (HoxA2 and HoxB2)
though several primer combinations have been tried.
Because the loss of HoxA2 or HoxB2 has never been
reported in other vertebrates, we used primers targeting
exon1 for HoxA2 and HoxB2 and were able to identify

Page 6 of 13

specific fragments for both genes in the Siamese crocodile. In addition, HoxC3 was not detected in the Siamese
crocodile and its absence in crocodiles was further validated in the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis; see the
Additional file 1: Statistics of the sequenced clones), a
representative of the other major clade of living crocodiles. Thus crocodiles have 39 Hox genes and their Hox
gene inventory is the same as that of mammals.
Birds

Though the genomic annotation of Hox clusters has
been reported for the chicken (Gallus gallus), information for HoxC4 and HoxC5 is still missing due to incomplete genomic assembly [15,23]. And because of the gap
at the 3’ end of the HoxC cluster in the chicken genome,
we do not know whether chicken has HoxC3 or not.
Besides, we found the homeobox of the predicted
chicken HoxC12 [Genbank: XM_426957] differs a lot
from its orthologs in other vertebrates and may have
assembly errors. In our PCR survey we confirmed the
presence of chicken HoxC4 and HoxC5 by finding their
respective homeobox fragments. To test whether birds
retain HoxC3, we surveyed Hox3 genes in two birds: the
domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica) and
the ostrich (Struthio camelus), representing two major
bird lineages (Neognathae and Paleognathae) respectively. As a result, HoxC3 was not detected, suggesting it
was lost in birds (see the Additional file 1: Statistics of
the sequenced clones). The reexamination of Hox12 in
chicken, duck and ostrich confirmed the presence of
HoxD12 in birds and revealed a fragment appearing well
conserved with HoxC12s in other vertebrates, which, we
think, represents the true bird HoxC12 (see the Additional file 1: Statistics of the sequenced clones). Hence,
with the detection of HoxC4, HoxC5, HoxC12 and
HoxD12 in birds, our data provides a more complete
picture of avian Hox gene inventory.
Mammals

Although the Hox gene inventory for placental mammals (e.g., human and mouse) is clear, the relevant
information for the other two major groups of extant
mammals: marsupials, monotremes, has not been
reported yet. We therefore performed an in silico survey
of Hox genes for the grey short-tailed opossum Monodelphis domestica (version Broad/monDom5; URL:
http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?org=Opossum) and the duck-billed platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus (version WUGSC 5.0.1/ornAna1; URL: http://
genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?org=Platypus). In
both species, the Hox A, B, and D clusters are almost
identical to those in human (HoxB6 was not detected in
the platypus due to a sequencing gap). For the HoxC
cluster, the platypus lacks genomic sequences covering
HoxC5, HoxC4 and its 3’ flanking region; the opossum
lacks almost the entire genomic sequences of the HoxC

Liang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/25

cluster, except fragments of HoxC6 and HoxC9. Based
on the observation that the architecture of HoxC13-C4
is conserved among all tetrapods, it is tempting to infer
that marsupials and monotremes possess the same
HoxC members as well. However, because the genomic
sequences of the 3’ flanking region of HoxC4 in both
the opossum and the platypus are still missing, it would
be premature to derive any conclusions about the presence/absence of HoxC3 in marsupials and monotremes.
The general scenario

Combining our data with other published data, we are
now able to provide a more complete scenario of how
Hox gene inventory variation occurs along major sarcopterygian lineages, from lobe-finned fishes to mammals
(Figure 3). On the whole, the four-cluster Hox architecture is well conserved; relatively basal lineages tend to
retain more Hox gene members. The HoxA14, B10, C1,
C3 were consecutively lost during the process of sarcopterygian evolution. HoxD12 and HoxB13 seem to be two
hotspots of gene loss and different animal groups may
have lost these Hox genes independently.
Hox gene variation among sarcopterygian lineages and
its evolutionary implications
The loss of HoxD12 is not directly related to digit reduction

Mannaert et al. [24] have proposed the absence of
HoxD12 in amphibians be related to the absence of the
fifth finger as frogs and salamanders normally have only
four fingers and caecilian is limbless. In such a view,
HoxD12 would be frequently lost in limbless animals
(no digits at all). The hypothesis seems reasonable
because HoxD12 does be lost in the snake (limbless, no
digits) and the African lungfish (only with thread-like
fins) according to our Hox gene survey. However,
besides snakes, there are many other squamates with
snake-like, limbless body forms. It is necessary to test
the hypothesis more strictly in these limbless animals as
well. To this end, we further surveyed Hox12 genes in
other limbless lizards, such as Amphisbaena caeca
(Amphisbaenidae), Blanus strauchi (Blanidae), Ophisaurus harti (Anguidae), Anniella pulchra (Anniellidae),
Typhlosaurus sp. (Scincidae) and Dibamus bourreti
(Dibamidae), representing a broad evolutionary coverage
for squamates. To our surprise, both HoxC12 and D12
could be unambiguously detected in all these limbless
animals (see the Additional file 1: Statistics of the
sequenced clones). This result indicated that the loss of
HoxD12 is not as directly related to the digit-reduction
phenotype as previously proposed.
The significance of HoxD13 retention in lungfishes

While the other group of extant lobe-finned fish, the coelacanths, has lost HoxD13 [13], a HoxD13 fragment was identified from the African lungfish in our PCR survey. Previous
knock-out experiments in mice have demonstrated that

Page 7 of 13

HoxD13 is essential in the autopodium formation for tetrapods [28,29], so it is easy to understand the fact that all tetrapods investigated so far possess the HoxD13 gene.
Therefore, the retention of HoxD13 which is shared by tetrapods and lungfishes but not coelacanths, is consistent
with lungfishes being the closest living sistergroup of tetrapods, a widely accepted relationship among coelacanths,
lungfishes and tetrapods [30].
Strictly, small Hox gene fragments generated by PCR
surveys are not definite evidences for the absence/presence of a gene, for example, the HoxD13 fragment in
the goldfish Carassius auratus auratus is thought to
represent a pseudo gene [31]. Therefore, we wonder
whether the African lungfish HoxD13 is really a functional gene. To address this issue, genome walking was
performed to obtain the 5’ region of the homeobox of
the lungfish HoxD13, including the intron and the complete exon1. No premature stop codons were observed,
indicating the African lungfish HoxD13 is not a pseudo
gene. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis
show that, the tetrapod HoxD13s are more similar to
the African lungfish HoxD13 than to that of bony fishes
(zebrafish) or cartilaginous fishes (shark) (Figure 4).
Although the lungfish has no “digits”, its HoxD13 may
represent the intermediate form towards the functions
in tetrapod HoxD13s during the fin-to-limb transitional
history. In the future it would be interesting to perform
“replacement” experiments in mice to see to what extent
the lungfish HoxD13 could rescue the functions of the
tetrapod HoxD13 especially in terms of autopodium
formation.
The variation of HoxC3 shows clues for turtles’ position on
the amniote tree

The phylogenetic position of turtles is the most controversial issue in the reconstruction of the living amniote
tree of life. After many different kinds of investigations
from both molecular and morphological data, four main
hypotheses concerning the phylogenetic relationships of
turtles to the other groups of living amniotes have been
proposed [30]: (A) Turtles as the only living representatives of anapsid reptiles, and as the sister-group of diapsid reptiles, i.e., the Lepidosauria (the tuatara, snakes,
and lizards) + Archosauria (crocodiles and birds);
(B) Turtles placed within diapsids, and as the sistergroup of the Lepidosauria; (C) Turtles as diapsids, and
as the sister-group of the Archosauria; (D) Turtles as
diapsids, but placed inside the Archosauria, and as the
sister-group of crocodiles. Most morphological studies
favor either Hypothesis A [32-35] or B [36,37] and
Hypothesis A is the traditional view of the placement of
turtles. In contrast to morphological views, recent molecular phylogenetic studies tend to support either
Hypotheses C or D and reject Hypotheses A and B
[38-43]. However, due to a severe slow down of

substitution rate in turtles relative to diapsid reptiles
[43], we can not rule out the possibility that the molecular turtle-archosaur relationship is caused by analytical
artifacts. Therefore, besides traditional morphological
inferences and sequence-based molecular phylogenetic
analyses, a third form of data is needed to explore and
test the alternative phylogenetic hypotheses of the turtle’s placement.
The presence of HoxC3 gene among living amniote
lineages seems a good indicator of their interrelationships.
Since both lobe-finned fishes and amphibians possess
HoxC3, the presence of HoxC3 is most likely the ancestral
state for amniotes. According to our survey, for living
amniotes, only squamates (snakes and lizards) retained
HoxC3 (the tuatara data is missing here, but it will not
alter our inference due to its affinity to squamates) and
other groups (mammals, birds, crocodiles and turtles) all
lost this gene. Following the principle of Dollo parsimony which assumes that losses of genes are much more common and likely than independent evolutionary origins, - we
can evaluate the four hypotheses about the position of turtles mentioned above. Both Hypotheses A and B require 3
steps of independent loss of HoxC3 in mammals, turtles
and archosaurs while Hypotheses C and D need only two
steps. Consequently, our Hox gene inventory data is in line
with most recent molecular studies favoring a turtle-archosaur relationship but unable to discriminate between

Hypotheses C and D. Considering that Archosauria is a
well supported clade, we tentatively accept Hypothesis C
and illustrate turtles’ position as shown in Figure 3.
The retention of HoxC1 in caecilians supports the Batrachia
hypothesis

Because sharks, many teleost fishes, lobe-finned fishes all
possess HoxC1 but all tetrapod species examined before
this study lack this gene, Kuraku and Meyer [22] deduced
that tetrapod ancestors lost their HoxC1 gene when they
diverged from lobe-finned fishes. However, our finding of
HoxC1 in caecilians suggested that tetrapod ancestors
actually retained HoxC1 gene but subsequently lost in
different lineages. The presence of HoxC1 likely represents a “fish-style” Hox gene inventory and only basal tetrapod lineages have the possibility to retain this gene.
Amphibians definitely branch first from the tetrapod tree
and comprise of three distinct living groups: frogs, salamanders and caecilians [44]. The retention of HoxC1 in
caecilians but not in frogs and salamanders implied that
among the three living amphibian groups, caecilians are
more distantly related to frogs and salamanders, supporting the Batrachia hypothesis (a frog+salamander clade)
advocated by most recent molecular studies [45-48].

Conclusions
We performed a comprehensive PCR survey of Hox
genes for six major sarcopterygian groups: lungfishes,

Liang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/25

caecilians, salamanders, snakes, turtles and crocodiles
and clarified some uncertainties of birds’ Hox gene
inventory. Our study provided a more complete scenario
for evolutionary dynamics of Hox genes along major sarcopterygian lineages. On the whole, Hox gene inventories of sarcopterygians are rather conserved with only
little variations occurring in the anterior or posterior
Hox paralogue groups. The Hox gene inventories of
limbless caecilians and snakes largely resemble those of
animals with less derived body morphology, suggesting
changes to their body morphology were likely due to
other modifications rather than changes to Hox gene
numbers. In future, it is interesting to sequence the
entire Hox clusters for these animals and our work can
serve as basis for this purpose.

Methods
Taxon sampling

In order to obtain a broad overview of Hox gene variation in major sarcopterygian lineages, we focused on
those groups whose Hox gene data were incomplete or
missing when our research began. The following six species were selected for comprehensive Hox gene survey:
Protopterus annectens (African lungfish) which represents another major group of extant lobe-finned fishes
besides coelacanths; Ichthyophis bannanicus (Banna caecilian) and Batrachuperus tibetanus (Tibetan mountain
salamander) representing caecilians and salamanders for
the amphibian lineage; Naja atra (Chinese cobra), Pelodiscus sinensis (Chinese soft-shell turtle) and Crocodylus
siamensis (Siamese crocodile) as the representative of
snakes, turtles and crocodiles for the reptilian lineage,
respectively. As we found some Hox gene variations
among these group representatives, we selected additional 22 species, providing a broad evolutionary coverage for different animal groups, to test the observed Hox
variation within certain group. Detailed information for
all species used in this study is listed in Table 2.
PCR, cloning and sequencing of Hox genes

We amplified fragments of Hox genes from genomic DNA
by PCR using several combinations of degenerate primers
flanking the homeobox or exon1 region (Table 1). In the
comprehensive surveys for the group representatives, Hox
genes were first divided into six paralogue group (PG) sets
(PG1-7, PG1-10, PG11, PG12, PG13, PG14) for amplification. For some paralogue groups such as PG12 and PG13
which were difficult to amplify, more than one set of primers was used to increase the probability of successful
amplification. If any members of PG1-10 was not initially
retrieved with the general primers, e.g., HoxC5 of PG5
could not been found, a PG specific forward primer
HoxF5S would be used; if the PG specific primers still
failed to amplify the gene, a more specific primer HoxFC5

Page 10 of 13

would be used to confirm its presence or absence. PG specific primers were also applied in the subsequent confirmation of Hox gene variations in the additional 22 species.
We know that non-detection by PCR survey can not be
interpreted definitively as a missing gene, but by trying
more sets of primers and surveying more numbers of
related species, the completeness of Hox gene PCR survey
for a given animal group is expected to be high.
PCR was performed in 25 μl reaction volumes with
ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Dalian) using the following cycling parameters: an initial denaturation step
at 94°C for 4min, 45 cycles of 94°C for 30s, 42-55°C for
1min, 72°C for 30s, and a final extension step at 72°C
for 10min. PCR products were purified by agarose gel
extraction (Axygen, Suzhou) and cloned into a PMD19T vector (Takara, Dalian). Positive recombinant clones
were identified by colony PCR and the PCR products
were cleaned with ExoSap treatment and sequenced on
an automated ABI3730 DNA sequencer.
Sequence analysis

Firstly, an alignment of homeobox regions of Hox genes
from six well-studied vertebrate species was made. Hox
genes of coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis), frog (Xenopus tropicalis), chicken (Gallus gallus), lizard (Anolis carolinensis), mouse (Mus musculus) and human (Homo
sapiens) were retrieved from GenBank upon availability.
For some Hox genes of frog, lizard and chicken that can
not be directly collected from GenBank, we identified
their draft sequences by alignments with other vertebrates at the UCSC Genome Browser http://genome.
ucsc.edu/. All the obtained sequences were cut down to
180 bp of homeobox and aligned by ClustalX [49].
For each of the examined species, we compared all its
obtained sequences against each other and identified a
set of unique sequences for the species. These unique
sequences were first screened for Hox gene fragments
using BLAST searches in GenBank. Candidate sequences
were then aligned to the aforementioned 6-species
homeobox alignment, both at the protein and the
nucleic acid level. Phylogenetic trees were generated by
the Neighbor-Joining method implemented in the
MEGA 4.0 [50] with either K2P (for nucleic acid) or
JTT (for protein) distances. Supports for the nodes were
evaluated by non-parametric bootstrap analyses of 1,000
replicates. The assignment of the candidate sequences
were made based on their phylogenetic position at the
protein or the nucleic acid level.
Genome walking

Because the homeobox regions we used are relatively
short, some Hox gene fragments cannot be undoubtedly
assigned to certain paralogue. To confirm the credibility
of our assignments, we performed genome walking

* Species that is limbless or only has limb remnants

(GW) to obtain the unknown sequence adjacent to the
homeobox region towards 5’ or 3’ end of exon2. The
homeobox-flanking regions are less conserved and more
informative and thus can facilitate identification of the
paralogue. The genome walking was carried out by
using the Genome Walking Kit (Takara, Dalian) which
is based on a TAIL-PCR technique. GW-specific primers were designed based on the candidate fragment
sequences following the manufacture’s guidance (available upon request).
