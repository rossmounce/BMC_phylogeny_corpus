Abstract
Background: Evolutionary analyses of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) have identified two
distantly related clonal groups: EHEC 1, including serotype O157:H7 and its inferred ancestor O55:H7;
and EHEC 2, comprised of several serogroups (O26, O111, O118, etc.). These two clonal groups differ in
their virulence and global distribution. Although several fully annotated genomic sequences exist for strains
of serotype O157:H7, much less is known about the genomic composition of EHEC 2. In this study, we
analyzed a set of 24 clinical EHEC 2 strains representing serotypes O26:H11, O111:H8/H11, O118:H16,
O153:H11 and O15:H11 from humans and animals by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on an
oligoarray based on the O157:H7 Sakai genome.
Results: Backbone genes, defined as genes shared by Sakai and K-12, were highly conserved in EHEC 2.
The proportion of Sakai phage genes in EHEC 2 was substantially greater than that of Sakai-specific
bacterial (non-phage) genes. This proportion was inverted in O55:H7, reiterating that a subset of Sakai
bacterial genes is specific to EHEC 1. Split decomposition analysis of gene content revealed that O111:H8
was more genetically uniform and distinct from other EHEC 2 strains, with respect to the Sakai O157:H7
gene distribution. Serotype O26:H11 was the most heterogeneous EHEC 2 subpopulation, comprised of
strains with the highest as well as the lowest levels of Sakai gene content conservation. Of the 979
parsimoniously informative genes, 15% were found to be compatible and their distribution in EHEC 2
clustered O111:H8 and O118:H16 strains by serotype. CGH data suggested divergence of the LEE island
from the LEE1 to the LEE4 operon, and also between animal and human isolates irrespective of serotype.
No correlation was found between gene contents and geographic locations of EHEC 2 strains.
Conclusion: The gene content variation of phage-related genes in EHEC 2 strains supports the hypothesis
that extensive modular shuffling of mobile DNA elements has occurred among EHEC strains. These results
suggest that EHEC 2 is a multiform pathogenic clonal complex, characterized by substantial intra-serotype
genetic variation. The heterogeneous distribution of mobile elements has impacted the diversification of
O26:H11 more than other EHEC 2 serotypes.

Background
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), the intersection of Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) and attaching
and effacing E. coli (AEEC), comprise a group of pathogenic E. coli that cause a variety of human and animal illnesses ranging from diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis (HC),
and the multifactorial hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
[1]. Intimate adherence to the intestinal epithelium resulting in characteristic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions,
and the destruction of capillary walls via production of
phage borne Shiga toxins (Stx 1, 2, and variants) are hallmarks of EHEC pathogenesis. A/E lesion formation is
dependent upon a type three secretion system (TTSS),
which is encoded on the laterally acquired locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) [2].
E. coli O157:H7 is the dominant EHEC serotype in the
United States, Argentina, Great Britain, and Japan [3,4].
However, multiple reports have shown that other EHEC,
including serogroups O26, O111, O103, and O118, frequently cause sporadic cases of human illness [5-12], and
have been implicated in numerous outbreaks [13-17]. In
Australia and parts of Europe, infections with serogroups
O26 and O111 are prevailing while the incidence of
O157:H7-associated disease appears to be declining [1821]. In contrast to E. coli O157:H7, EHEC serogroups
O26, O111, O118, O103, and O5 are commonly linked
to outbreaks and sporadic cases of calf diarrhea (scours)
and HC [22-28], which has been validated from experimental infections in calves [29-32]. In Germany and Belgium, for example, EHEC O118 is the most prevalent type
of STEC associated with diarrhea in calves [33], with evidence for zoonotic transmission [8,34].
Phylogenetic analyses of conserved metabolic genes have
revealed some of the basis for the variation among EHEC
strains. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis [35] and partial sequencing of 13 housekeeping genes [36] classified
EHEC into two distantly related clonal groups: EHEC 1
includes serotype O157:H7 and its inferred ancestor
O55:H7, whereas EHEC 2 includes numerous serogroups
(e.g., O26, O111, O118). The key virulence factors shared
between EHEC 1 and EHEC 2 clonal complexes were postulated to have been introduced through multiple and
parallel acquisitions of mobile elements [37]. A comparison of E. coli O157:H7 genomes has also revealed the
extent and significant impact of horizontal transfer on the
evolution of virulence [38,39]. Furthermore, array comparative genomic hybridizations (CGH) have shown that
the divergence in gene content among closely related
O157 strains is ~140 times greater than the divergence at
the nucleotide sequence level [40]. Although recent evidence indicates the emergence of highly virulent lineages
among non-O157 EHEC, notably the O26 serogroup
[19,41], little is known about the gene content, genetic

diversity and evolution of virulence in members of the
EHEC 2 group.
The function of ancillary virulence determinants is somewhat characterized in O157:H7 [2,42], however, the relevance as well as the distribution of these factors in EHEC
2 is not clear. To systematically investigate the gene content variations within the EHEC 2 clonal group. we analyzed a set of 24 clinical EHEC 2 strains representing
serotypes
O26:H11,
O111:H8/H11,
O118:H16,
O153:H11 and O15:H11 from humans and animals
using array-based CGH. Because there are no EHEC 2
genome sequences available, a multi-genome spotted oligoarray containing probes for 5,978 ORFs from O157:H7
Sakai, O157:H7 EDL933, and K-12 MG1655 was used to
examine the distribution of these E. coli genes in our collection of EHEC 2 strains. The findings of this study shed
light on the diversification of horizontally acquired elements in a group of pathogens that represent recent evolutionary branches of EHEC clonal groups.

Results
Sequence types (STs) and stx profiles of EHEC 2 strains
Phylogenetic analyses of multi locus sequence typing
(MLST) data grouped the 24 EHEC 2 strains (Table 1) into
four STs. The most common was ST 106, which was found
in 20 strains, while the remaining three STs each differed
from ST 106 by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
in almost 4,000 bp of the concatenated MLST sequence.
MLST data revealed a lack of nucleotide sequence diversity
in house keeping genes among these EHEC 2 strains. The
neighbor-joining phylogeny based on concatenated MLST
allelic sequences grouped the EHEC 2 strains into a distinct cluster, with 100% bootstrap support, which was
more closely related to the EPEC 2 group (100% bootstrap
support) than to members of EHEC 1 (Figure 1). Most of
these EHEC 2 strains (n = 17) were PCR positive for only
stx1, whereas four strains had both stx1 and stx2, and three
strains were negative for both stx genes (Table 1).
Gene content of EHEC 2 strains
Binary classification of genes as present or divergent/
absent, inferred by GACK analyses of the CGH data, was
used to determine the gene content of all 24 EHEC 2
strains (Table 2) and of each individual strain (Table 3).
Because all CGH experiments were performed with Sakai
as the reference strain, our analyses focused on probes targeting genes present in the Sakai genome. The oligo
probes were classified to represent backbone genes
(shared by Sakai and K-12), and Sakai-specific genes (note
that the term "Sakai-specific" is used here only in comparison to K-12). The Sakai-specific genes were further classified in Sakai phage genes (phage-related genes present in
Sakai but absent in K-12) and Sakai bacterial genes (nonphage-related genes present in Sakai but absent in K-12)

[38]. Of the 3,696 backbone genes, 80.9% were shared by
all EHEC 2 strains, whereas only 5.8% of the Sakai phage
genes (n = 814) and 6.5% of the Sakai bacterial genes (n =
434) were found in every tested EHEC 2 strain. While
84.7% of the Sakai phage genes were found in at least one
of the 24 EHEC 2 strains, a whole 53% of the Sakai bacterial genes were not found in any of the these strains
(Table 2).
In each individual EHEC 2 strain, approximately 95% of
the 3,696 backbone genes were found (Table 3, Figure 2),
with little variation (95.5% Â± 1.2%, range 93% â 97%). In
contrast, about 52% of the Sakai phage genes were found,
but with a much greater variability across EHEC 2 strains
(52.1% Â± 8.2%, range 30% â 65%). This may be an over
estimation of Sakai phage gene distribution in EHEC 2, as
231 of the 814 phage gene probes analyzed had multiple
phage gene targets in the Sakai genome, based on in silico
analysis of probe specificity. Sakai bacterial genes were
found less frequently in EHEC 2 strains (22.7% Â± 2.3%,
range 19% â 30%). Serotype O26:H11 showed the most
interstrain variation, whereas O111:H8 and O118:H16
were more uniform with respect to Sakai gene distribu-

tion. The O55:H7 representative also had a high percentage of backbone genes (96.6%). Furthermore, 33% of the
814 Sakai phage genes and 70% of the 434 Sakai bacterial
genes were conserved in O55:H7, suggesting an inverse
trend relative to that observed in EHEC 2 strains (Table 3).
Identification of potential EHEC-specific genes
From the 1,248 Sakai-specific genes represented on the
microarray, 152 (12.2%) were conserved in 23 of the 24
EHEC 2 strains; 102 of these were phage-related. Sixtyfour genes encode hypothetical proteins of unknown
function, and the remainder consisted mostly of genes
responsible for various prophage and other mobile element functions. Nucleotide sequences of these 152 genes
were compared against five non-EHEC pathogenic E. coli
(536, APEC O1, B171, CFT073, UTI89) and six Shigella
(Sf2a 2457T, Sf2a 301, Sf5 8401, Ss046, Sb227, Sd197)
published genomes, using BLAST. With a minimum of
80% nucleotide sequence identity in a minimum of 80%
query coverage as the cutoff value to identify conserved
genes, 26 of the 152 genes were not found in any of the 11
queried non-EHEC genome sequences. The 26 gene
sequences were then "BLASTed" against the entire GenPage 3 of 16

Phylogenetic relationships of EHEC and EPEC sequence types
Phylogenetic relationships of EHEC and EPEC sequence types. The sequence types (STs) of EHEC 2 belong to a
clonal group (CG 14), which is more closely related to EPEC 2 (CG 17), than EHEC 1 STs (CG 11). The phylogenetic tree was
constructed using the Neighbor-joining algorithm based on the Kimura 2-parameter distance matrix of nucleotide substitution.
Bootstrap confidence values were based on 1000 replicates. Only those higher than 70% are shown.
Bank database with the same cutoff value. Only three of
these 26 genes were not found in any other organisms and
therefore could be considered as specific to EHEC strains:
ECs1561 (Sakai prophage (Sp) 6); ECs1763, and ECs1822
(Sp 9). All three genes encode hypothetical proteins of
unknown function.
Genomic relatedness of EHEC 2 strains
We used the split decomposition method to infer the
strain relatedness based on gene content data. We first
analyzed all the 4,800 genes whose probe intensities were
higher than those for negative controls. As expected, the

analysis showed a network like phylogeny (Figure 3), in
which the parallel edges reflected incompatible signals in
the data that were indicative of parallel gene gain/loss due
to multiple transduction events or past recombination. All
O111:H8 strains were clustered closely and branched
away from the remaining EHEC 2 strains, which formed a
loose cluster without any recognizable concordance to
serotypes, hosts, or locations (Figure 3). The pairwise
homoplasy index (PHI) [43], generated in Splitstree, confirmed that there was significant evidence of recombination (p-value = 0.0).

a â Stan. Dev., standard deviation.

Among the 4,800 genes whose probe intensities were
higher than those for negative controls, 70.8% were found
to be either present or divergent/absent in all 24 strains,
and therefore, phylogenetically uninformative. Compatibility analysis of the 979 parsimoniously informative (PI)
genes identified 147 PI genes to be phylogenetically compatible with each other, but not compatible with the rest
of the PI genes (the distribution of these genes is shown in
Additional file 1). For the second split decomposition
analysis, these 147 genes were combined with 421 singleton genes (genes found present or divergent/absent in
only one of the 24 EHEC 2 strains). Singletons were added
to generate terminal edges of the network and to help distinguish strain-specific changes. The analysis with this set
of genes showed a more tree like phylogeny with a better
separation of EHEC 2 strains (Figure 4). Six O111:H8
strains and six O118:H16 strains formed two tight and
distinct clusters, while the twelve O26:H11, O111:H11,
O153:H11, and O15:H11 strains were dispersed throughout the network. The O111:H8 cluster was visibly distinct

from the rest, reiterating its particular pattern of gene content conservation across all 4,800 genes (Figure 3). The
two O111:H11 strains did not cluster with O111:H8
strains, which is not unusual since the O111 serogroup
has been suggested to include several lineages [44]. In this
analysis, the O118:H16 strains appear to be more closely
related to most of the O26:H11 strains than any other
EHEC 2 serotype. Nonetheless, there was a short edge separating the O118:H16 serotype from O26:H11, followed
by strain-specific splits within O118:H16 that were based
on singleton genes. The eight O26:H11 strains did not
cluster together, suggesting that strains of this serotype are
considerably more diverse than O111:H8 and O118:H16
strains.
Prophages
To visualize gene content of the 814 Sakai phage genes
within the EHEC 2 clonal group, we classified these genes
by Sakai phage groups (Sakai prophages Sp1â18, and
prophage-like elements SpLE1â6) and sorted the genes in

used to identify EHEC 2 strains with similar gene content
(Figure 5 and Additional file 2). Overall, there was no
common pattern of gene distribution for all phage groups
(Figure 5), which was also implied by additional split
decomposition networks (data not shown). Some similarity was detected among O111:H8 strains for Sp5, Sp15
and Sp8 genes, with more Sp5 and Sp15 genes being conserved in the O111:H8 serotype than in other EHEC 2
strains. Conversely, Sp8 was well-conserved in all but the
O111:H8 strains (data not shown), in which Sp8 genes
were virtually absent except for two short gene segments,
ECs1638â43 and ECs1656â63, which encode tail and
hypothetical proteins, respectively.

Distribution of Sakai genes among EHEC 2 clinical strains
Distribution of Sakai genes among EHEC 2 clinical
strains. The three histograms represent distribution trends
of three Sakai gene groups in EHEC 2 strains: Sakai bacterial
genes (left histogram â hatched bars), Sakai phage genes
(middle histogram, open bars), and backbone genes (right histogram â hatched bars). The levels of Sakai gene content
conservation were calculated for each EHEC 2 strain by
dividing the number of Sakai genes, from a particular gene
group, found in a strain by the total number of Sakai genes
from the respective gene group, represented on the oligoarray; these values were expressed as percentages. Each bar
represents the number of EHEC 2 strains that were found to
have the same percentage of Sakai gene content conservation. Each strain is represented on each histogram and the
bars in each histogram add up to 24, the total number of
strains investigated. One exception is the bar representing
Sakai phage gene content conservation in strain DEC9f,
which is hidden by the hatched bar representing the Sakai
bacterial gene content conservation in strain CB7505. As can
be seen in Table 3, strain DEC9f has 30% of Sakai phage
genes and strain CB7505 has 30% of Sakai bacterial genes,
causing the bars to overlap. Numbers above each plot represent the average for each group of genes and the range of the
distribution is given in parentheses.
each group by chromosomal order (based on ECs numbers). This classification does not necessarily infer that
these genes are present in EHEC 2 within the same phage
or order as they are in Sakai, but simply allows an assessment of gene content variation of laterally acquired genes
known to be linked in the Sakai chromosome. Dendrograms based on pairwise comparison of gene content were

Stx converting prophages
The CGH data confirmed the stx1/stx2 profile of the EHEC
2 strains determined by PCR. In Sp15 (stx1-prophage), a
block of genes at the beginning of the phage (ECs2940â
2952) was conserved in most strains (Figure 5). These
genes encode tail proteins and the putative outer membrane protein Lom precursor (ECs2942). Adjacent is a
group of genes (ECs2953â2963) encoding two tail proteins, a putative terminase large subunit and several
unknown proteins, which are fully conserved in O111:H8
strains but almost completely divergent/absent in the rest.
Two regions in the Sp15 phage, ECs2984â2988 and
ECs2998â3006, were well conserved in all strains positive
for the stx1 gene, except in O111:H8 strains. Excisionase
and integrase genes (ECs3012 and ECs3013) were divergent/absent in most of the EHEC 2 strains. Overall, the
gene content of Sp15 in strains negative for the stx1 gene
was different from those in stx1 positive strains (Figure 5).

Strains positive for the stx2 gene, mostly representing serotype O111:H8, had more Sp5 (stx2-phage) genes. Integrase and excisionase genes (ECs1160 and ECs1161), and
the block of genes at the beginning of the phage,
ECs1160â1187, were missing from most strains. The rest
of Sp5 genes, which encode replication proteins O and P,
NinE and NinG, Shiga toxin 2, antirepressor proteins, antitermination protein Q, outer membrane precursor proteins, terminases, tail proteins, and a number of
hypothetical proteins, were present in five of the six
O111:H8 strains as well as in the O26:H11 strain containing both stx1 and stx2 (Figure 5).
Locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) island
Of the 41 genes in the Sakai LEE island that are located on
SpLE4, all except escU were present in the O55:H7 strain.
This includes genes that were categorized as present after
the initial GACK cutoff was relaxed by 20%. Since dyeswap genomic microarrays represent competitive hybridizations between two populations of DNA, there were
instances when a small difference in the nucleotide
sequence of the tested strain resulted in weaker probe sig-

nal intensity. For example, both of the two known SNPs
present between the variable regions of g intimin in
O55:H7 and O157:H7 [45] are located in the middle
region of the 70-mer probe for eae. Hence the signal intensity for this gene was just below the cutoff (gray shading
in Figure 5). Based on the level of divergence of EHEC 2
LEE genes from O157 LEE genes, strains clustered into two
major groups (Figure 5). The top group of the dendrogram is composed of human strains, which have a high

level of similarity to O157 LEE genes, whereas the bottom
cluster represents 11 animal and 3 human strains that
have a lower level of similarity to the O157 LEE genes. The
level of divergence was also found to be heterogeneous
between LEE operons (Table 4). The genes that encode the
type III secretion system (TTSS), escRSTUCJVNDF, were
detected in 14 to 24 strains, with the exception of escR and
escC, which were found in 11 and 5 strains, respectively.
The needle filament gene, espA, was present in 23 strains,

whereas espB and espD were divergent/absent in all. The tir
and g intimin genes were also divergent/absent in EHEC
2; the g intimin was conserved only in the O55:H7 representative, an expected result because the 70-mer probe
was designed to detect the variable (allele-specific) part of
eae.
Other phage gene groups
Most genes from SpLE1, which encodes the tellurite resistance and adherence island (TAI), were divergent/absent
from two EHEC 2 strains and from the O55:H7 representative, but present in the rest of the EHEC 2 strains (Figure
5). The diverse trend in retention or loss of laterally
acquired genes was emphasized by the arrangement of
Sp10 genes. CGH data inferred three patterns of Sp10
gene content conservation in EHEC 2 (Figure 5). In the
first 14 strains (top to bottom), Sp10 genes were found to
be present or divergent/absent in an en bloc fashion. The
middle branch of the dendrogram represents six strains in
which virtually all Sp10 genes were present. In the remaining five strains, Sp10 genes appeared to have a mosaic
structure with individual genes present or divergent/
absent. In contrast, Sp18 was either entirely divergent/
absent or nearly completely present. There was no correlation between the distribution of Sakai phage genes in
EHEC 2 and geographic location of the EHEC 2 isolates.
Non-LEE encoded effectors
The gene content of non-LEE encoded effectors, which are
predicted to be secreted by the LEE-encoded TTSS [42] in
EHEC 2, varied from totally divergent/absent to present in
every strain (Additional file 3). Genes espY1, nleD, espX2,
espY4, espL3', espX3', espL4, and nleB2-1 were divergent/
absent from EHEC 2, whereas a set of 15 genes (espX1,
espX5, espX6, espY3, espK, nleA, nleE, nleG, nleG2-2, nleG61, espM1, espM2, espR1, espL1, and espW) were present in
at least 22 EHEC 2 strains. The nleG7 gene, which was
recently found to be conserved in a group of non-O157
EHEC strains [46], was also divergent/absent in all EHEC
2 examined in this study.

Discussion
Comparative analysis of genomes from 17 commensal
and pathogenic E. coli strains has revealed a diverse species 'pan-genome', while the E. coli 'core conserved'
genome was calculated to be about one-half of the
genome of a given E. coli isolate [47]. Although EHEC utilize similar virulence mechanisms, this pathotype is comprised of phylogenetically distinct lineages that vary in
their ability to cause disease in both humans and animals.
Clearly, the genome of a single strain cannot reflect how
the genomic diversity among EHEC strains influences
pathogenesis of the EHEC population. Because no strains
from the EHEC 2 clonal group have been sequenced, the
genetic variability of 24 EHEC 2 strains were examined in
relation to the distribution of genes from O157:H7 Sakai,
which belongs to the EHEC 1 clonal group. The Sakai
genome was used in this study, as its annotation is suggested to include more strain-specific genes compared to
EDL933 [47]. Genes specific to the EHEC 2 group have yet
to be described. Some genes shared with Sakai might have
been missed in our study, if the gene sequence had
diverged to a point where the 70-mer oligonucleotide
probes and the stringency of competitive hybridization
preclude detection. Although this study allowed screening
of known genes only, the gene content data still offered
new insight on strain relatedness and the distribution and
subsequent diversification of mobile elements within the
EHEC 2 clonal group.
The CGH data presented here indicate that there are two
distinct trends, which reflect the bacterial (vertical) and
phage (lateral) origin of genes, impacting the genomic
divergence of EHEC 2. Virtually the entire set of backbone
genes was present within the EHEC 2 clonal group (Tables
2 and 3). CGH inferences pertaining to the distribution of
backbone genes can vary depending on array type, sample
size, and strain diversity [46]. For example, Anjum et al.
have proposed that the O26 serogroup exhibits greater
genetic homogeneity than was observed in our study [48];
however, the microarray platform used in that study was
limited to the genome of K-12 MG1655. Despite these differences, the degree of conservation among backbone
genes in this CGH investigation was similar in previous
studies [46,49,50]. The distribution of Sakai-specific
genes in EHEC 2 was, not surprisingly, noticeably lower
than that of the backbone, which restates established findings about intraspecies genomic variability [40,51,52].
The conservation of Sakai phage genes was, however,
found to be more than 2-fold higher when compared to
Sakai bacterial genes (Figure 2 and Table 3). In O55:H7,
the inferred ancestor of O157:H7 [53], the proportion of
Sakai phage to bacterial gene conservation was opposite
from the proportion observed in EHEC 2; this suggests
that Sakai bacterial genes have been vertically acquired
from the O55:H7 progenitor and are not disseminated

among the EHEC 2 clone. Cursory assessment of K-12specific genes suggests a homogenous distribution in
EHEC 2, with less than half of the genes present; most K12 phage-related genes were found to be uniformly divergent/absent from the entire EHEC 2 population (Additional file 4). Assessing the conservation of K-12 specific
genes was, however, beyond the scope of this study, as K12 MG1655 is a non-pathogenic laboratory-derived strain
that is distantly related to EHEC (Figure 1).
The increased presence of Sakai phage genes in the EHEC
2 group compared to Sakai bacterial genes reveals independent acquisition and exchange of similar mobile elements. For example, of the 152 Sakai-specific genes
present in EHEC 2, only 26 genes were not found in 11
completed non-EHEC E. coli and Shigella spp. genomes.
About one-half of the 26 "EHEC only" genes were found
in stx1-encoding phages BP-4795 and CP-1639 from STEC
O84:H11 and O111:H-, respectively [54,55]. Sakai genes
identified by BLASTN as present on BP-4795 are disseminated on phages Sp6, 9, 10, and 12, which is in agreement
with the evidence for recombination between phages
[56]. Although the number of phage genes shared by all
tested strains was low, the percentage of those that were
VAP was high (Table 2), which may reflect sequence heterogeneity in prophage genomes with similar modular
structures [54,56,57], and not true absence of genes.
Phylogenetic network analysis implied a serotype-specific
uniformity of O111:H8 strains, unlike other EHEC 2
strains (Figure 3), which can also be inferred from the
arrangement of Sakai phage genes in O111:H8 strains
(Figure 5). Interestingly, these six EHEC 2 representatives
are the only strains with the q intimin allele while the
remaining eighteen EHEC 2 strains had b intimin, as
determined by PCR-based RFLP typing of eae; the method
for eae typing was described previously [58]. By contrast,
members of the EHEC 1 clonal group (i.e., O157:H7 and
O55:H7) typically had the g allele. Although intimin q
has been found in an atypical EPEC O55:H7 and a nonEHEC 2 strain (GenBank Acc. No. AJ833638 and
AF253561), O111:H8 is, to our knowledge, the only
EHEC 2 serotype with this intimin allele, providing further support for the hypothesis that O111:H8 represents a
distinct grouping.
Based on the distinguishing distribution of Sakai genes
(Figures 3 and 4), serotype O26:H11 appears to be considerably more diverse compared to the distinct and more
uniform O111:H8. This suggests that the genetic make-up
of O26:H11 is such that it allows more frequent lateral
exchange of DNA elements, which can result in acquisition of novel fitness and virulence genes by O26:H11
more commonly than by other EHEC 2. For example,
O26:H11 possess the Yersinia spp. high pathogenicity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/296

island (HPI) that encodes the iron-uptake siderophore
yersiniabactin and the pesticin receptor, whereas other
EHEC serotypes, including O157:H7, O111:H-,
O103:H2, and O145:H-, do not have this HPI [59]. The
diversity of O26:H11/H- has also been implied with other
methods [60].
A proportion of the EHEC 2 hybridization data (15% of
the PI genes) were identified as genes that are phylogenetically compatible with each other, i.e., having no homoplasy. Although this represents a small number of genes,
it is remarkable that the distribution pattern grouped
EHEC 2 O111:H8 and O118:H16 strains by serotype (Figure 4). The pathogenic E. coli used in this study represent
tips of phylogenetic branches, where high frequencies of
recombination strongly impact the shaping of genomic
content [61] and eventually lead to erosion of the phylogenetic signal between clonal complexes [62]. Thus, the
set of genes shared with EHEC 1 O157:H7 whose pattern
of presence and absence in EHEC 2 infers compatibility
and is not random, but coincides with serotype, warrants
further investigation.
The heterogeneity of Stx phages has been demonstrated
[57,63], even within the O157:H7 lineage itself [64,65],
so it is not unexpected to find such variation between different EHEC 2 strains. In addition, Ogura et al. propose
that Stx phages have alternative integration sites in EHEC
2 [46]; this may explain our lack of detection of integrase
genes, as integration site specificity is dependent on the
alignment of the phage integrase with the attachment
sequence in the bacterial chromosome [66]. Strains that
were stx negative in our study were, nevertheless, found to
carry genes from the Sp15 and Sp5 phages, which is a
common effect of frequent modular shuffling of
sequences between phages of related enteric hosts
[56,67,68]. The significance of the unique conservation
patterns of Sp10 and Sp18 phage genes is not clear. Sp10
is perhaps more conserved as it harbors non-LEE effector
genes [42], all 3 of which were detected in at least 22 out
of 24 EHEC 2 strains. Absence of the entire Sp18 was also
detected among O157:H7 strains [65], one of which
belongs to a hyper-virulent lineage of the O157:H7 population [69].
Incongruent divergence of LEE operons has been previously suggested. Studies indicate that this island is a
dynamic region [70], and that different selective pressures
act on different parts of the LEE [71]. The sequence diversity of the LEE, both at the nucleotide and amino acid
level, increases along the length of the island from the
LEE1 to the LEE4 operon [71,72]. A comparable trend can
be observed in the CGH data presented here, as there was
greater conservation of the content of genes that encode
the secretion apparatus (LEE1â3). However, differences in

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:296

the content of O157:H7 Sakai LEE genes between human
and animal EHEC 2 strains of the same serotype (Figure 5
and Table 4) suggest that the LEE has diverged between
EHEC 2 strains in a host dependent manner, possibly due
to host species adaptive pressure. This result was not
expected and its implications are not supported by the
current literature. Multiple, parallel acquisitions of the
LEE by different clonal groups have been inferred [37,7375].
Muniesa et al. suggest that the LEE genes associated with
serogroup O26 are present more commonly in STEC than
the LEE genes associated with EHEC O157:H7 or EPEC
O127:H6 [76]. Yet, there is no clear evidence to support
the hypothesis that LEE divergence within a lineage results
from positive adaptive pressure in different host species.
In fact, when several LEE genes from strain RDEC-1 were
compared to those from other AEEC, the variation
appeared to be associated with evolutionary lineage and
not host specificity [77]. Even so, given the heterogeneous
diversification of this island and the recent inference
about host-specific expression of espA and eae in O157:H7
[78], it would be interesting to compare complete LEE
sequences from a larger sample of EHEC 2 strains of
human and animal origin.

Conclusion
Here, we present an assessment of the gene content of a set
of EHEC 2 clinical strains of animal and human origin,
isolated from the USA and Europe. The small subset of
phylogenetically compatible genes represent potential
markers that will aid in the investigation of the relatedness
and cladogenesis of the EHEC 2 clonal group. In this
study, serotype O26:H11, the most frequent EHEC 2 serotype associated with overt disease, represented the most
diverse EHEC 2 population. Compared to the more
homogeneous O111:H8 strains, O26:H11 strains may
have an increased propensity to laterally exchange DNA,
which may ultimately give rise to hyper-virulent lineages
within EHEC 2 O26:H11. Furthermore, the identification
of several EHEC-specific genes could potentially be used
as novel genetic markers to identify strains belonging to
this pathotype.

Methods
Bacterial strains and DNA isolation
Since genome sequences for tested strains are not available, two-color hybridizations between sequenced strains
of E. coli O157:H7 RIMD 0509952 (Sakai) [38] and K-12
MG1655 [79] were used as references. A total of 24 EHEC
2 strains including serotypes O26:H11 (n = 8), O111:H8
(n = 6), O111:H11 (n = 2), O118:H16 (n = 6), O153:H(n = 1), and O15:H11 (n = 1), originally isolated from
human and animal cases of STEC-associated disease, were
used in this study and were selected based on the serotype
and source (Table 1) [6,33,80-90]. The study also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/296

included an EHEC 1 O55:H7 strain, isolated from a
human diarrhea case. Bacterial DNA was prepared from
overnight LB cultures grown at 37Â°C using the Puregene
genomic DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and Shiga toxin (Stx)
genes
The detailed MLST protocol and multiplex PCR conditions for characterizing the Stx genes (stx1/stx2) can be
found at the STEC Reference Center website http://
www.shigatox.net. Briefly, MLST was performed on seven
conserved housekeeping genes (aspC, clpX, fadD, icdA,
lysP, mdh, and uidA), and sequence type (ST) assignments
were made based on phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated sequences.
Oligonucleotide arrays
The Qiagen (Valencia, Calif.) spotted multi-genome
arrays containing probes specific for 5,978 ORFs from E.
coli K-12 MG1655, O157:H7 Sakai and EDL933 were utilized. Of these probes, a total of 5,943 were 70-mer oligonucleotides and 35 ranged from 41â69 bp. The probes
were printed in duplicate on UltraGaps glass slides (Corning Inc., NY) at the Research Technology Support Facility
at Michigan State University. The array also contained 384
spots representing 12 randomized negative control 70mer probes. All probes were assigned ORF designations
(b- = MG1655, ECs- = Sakai, or Z- = EDL933 numbers) or
intergenic region labels based on the RefSeq database
available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website [91].
In silico analysis of microarray probe specificity
To verify the probes with the up-to-date genome annotations, we compared all 5,990 probe sequences against the
three E. coli genomes (MG1655, Sakai, and EDL933) by
BLASTN available on NCBI, and recorded the two highest
hits for every probe (top hit and second hit) for each
genome. A probe was considered to be specific for a target
when the top hit demonstrated Â³ 80% identity to the
probe sequence stretch in the strain. Probes with nonspecific hybridization and multiple target hybridizations
within MG1655 or Sakai DNA were excluded from the
data analysis of MG1655 and Sakai hybridizations. These
included probes that had multiple top hits with 75% overall identity or probes that had multiple top hits between
50% and 75% of overall identity with alignments containing a stretch of nucleotides with 100% identity, in which
the stretch was 20% of the probe length. With respect to
the MG1655 and Sakai genomes, out of 5,978 probes, 12
had no target (EDL933 specific), 731 showed nonspecific
hybridization or had multiple targets, and 5,235 matched
single genome targets. Of these, 3,803 targeted both
genomes, with 1,002 targeting only Sakai and 430 targeting only K-12.

DNA labeling and microarray hybridization
Genomic DNA was sheared into 500 to 5,000 bp fragments in a cup sonicator (Heat Systems Ultrasonics W225, 20 KHz, 200 W) and 250 ng of sheared DNA was
labeled with aminoallyl-dUTP (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.)
using the Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) DNA labeling system, as previously described [40]. Equal amounts of DNA
from Sakai and test strains were suspended and combined
in a final volume of 44 mL of SlydeHyb Buffer #1
(Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Qiagen E. coli spotted oligoarrays were hybridized and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions for hybridization using coverslips.
Test strains were hybridized twice with Sakai as a reference: once with the Cy5 labeled test strain and Cy3
labeled Sakai and once with the Cy3 labeled test strain
and Cy5 labeled Sakai to correct for dye incorporation
bias.
Data collection and analyses
Arrays were scanned with the Genepix 4000B array scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, Calif.) and probe
intensities (median pixel intensities) were retrieved using
Genepix 6.0 (Axon Instruments). Data quality was
assessed by viewing plots of M versus A [M = log2 (test/reference); A = log2 (test Ã reference)] and by checking for
spatial effects with Genepix 6.0 and GeneTraffic (Iobion,
La Jolla, Calif.) as described previously [40]. Because
genome sequences of tested strains were not available,
microarray data were not normalized to avoid biasing the
gene content of tested strains. Instead, microarray images
showing spatial bias were discarded and hybridizations
were repeated until control parameters were appropriate.
Duplicate probes for each gene were averaged prior to
analyses. Probes with median pixel intensities higher than
the median of the randomized negative controls were analyzed as the distribution of the two-color signal ratios
using the "GACK" program [92]. Analysis of the log2 (test
strain/reference strain) distribution (GACK1) as well as of
the reciprocal ratio, log2 (reference strain/test strain)
(GACK2), were performed for Sakai versus MG1655
hybridizations to determine a cutoff. Genes with a GACK1
value of Â³ 0.1 were classified as present, whereas genes
with a GACK1 value of < 0.1 were classified as divergent/
absent. At this cutoff, maximum sensitivity (98.8%) and
specificity (96%) were achieved for the MG1655/Sakai
dye-swap hybridizations, and therefore, this cutoff was
used to interpret the data from Sakai versus EHEC 2
hybridizations. The term 'present' is used to indicate that
a gene was detected by CGH, and does not necessarily
imply that the whole gene is conserved or functional; likewise, the term 'divergent/absent' indicates that a gene was
not detected by CGH.
Phylogenetic analyses
Strains were assigned to clonal groups based on STs and
bootstrap analyses as described previously [36,93]. A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/296

neighbor-joining tree of the concatenated MLST
sequences was constructed using the Kimura 2-parameter
distance method with 1000 bootstrap replications in
MEGA 3.1 [94]. The tree includes other enteropathogenic
E. coli (EPEC) and EHEC STs as well as the lab-derived K12 (ST173) and the uropathogenic E. coli CFT073 (ST27)
for comparison; an E. albertii strain was used as the outgroup. For phylogenetic analyses of the microarray data, a
total of 144 genes (from all array hybridizations) with
probe intensities below those of negative controls were
excluded from the set of 4,944 genes. Neighbor-net phylogenies highlighting the distribution of Sakai genes in
EHEC 2 strains, for which the presence or absence of genes
was coded as 0 (divergent/absent) or 1 (present), were
constructed using the uncorrected p distance in Splitstree
4.3 [95]. The number of Sakai genes whose distribution in
EHEC 2 was parsimoniously informative were determined
in MEGA 3.1 [94], and the set of Sakai genes in EHEC 2
whose distribution was compatible with a single phylogeny was identified using the clique module of PHYLIP
[96].
