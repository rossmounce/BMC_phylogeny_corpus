Abstract
Genome programs changed our view of bacteria as cell factories, by making them amenable to
systematic rational improvement. As a first step, isolated genes (including those of the
metagenome), or small gene clusters are improved and expressed in a variety of hosts. New
techniques derived from functional genomics (transcriptome, proteome and metabolome studies)
now allow users to shift from this single-gene approach to a more integrated view of the cell, where
it is more and more considered as a factory. One can expect in the near future that bacteria will
be entirely reprogrammed, and perhaps even created de novo from bits and pieces, to constitute
man-made cell factories. This will require exploration of the landscape made of neighbourhoods of
all the genes in the cell. Present work is already paving the way for that futuristic view of bacteria
in industry.

Review
Genomes in the thousands
At the date of October 30th, 2004 the GOLD (http://
www.genomesonline.org/) site provided links to 1205
ongoing or completed genome programmes, most of
which from prokaryotic organisms. More than 40,000
pages are indexed in the WWW Browser Engine Google for
the keyword "cell factory". Early in 1999 the European
Union launched a research programme on the cell factory
(http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/rtdinf21/en/key/
03.html), stating that « The concept of the "bio-product"
is as old as the knowledge involved in the making of
bread, beer, wine or cheese. However, recent techniques
and knowledge in molecular biology and genetics mean
that living cells – from bacteria to man – are now becoming real "factories". In vast fermentation vats, engineers
can direct and control natural metabolism in order to produce all sorts of substances with a high added value: pro-

teins, amino acids, alcohols, citric acid, solvents and even
bio-plastics. This industrial mastery of the mechanisms of
life opens up revolutionary perspectives in the development of new kinds of medicines, foodstuffs with specific
nutritional properties, and biodegradable biochemical
products » [1].
Taken together these pieces of information show that
exploration of the potential of microbes as industrial tools
is shifting from its former status of traditional biotechnology assets to new high technology devices, meant to perform highly specific tasks, with the highest possible yields
and security, and genomics as the background support.
We shall not here review the use of microbes in traditional
production (bread, beer, cheese and wine have been
invented since the origin of the Neolithic, and perhaps
even earlier [2]) but, rather, see how the coupling between
knowledge of bacterial genome sequences and new

genomics techniques such as expression profiling and biotechnology processes have interacted recently. The numbers of works in the domain is growing exponentially (it
counts certainly in the thousands), and we shall therefore
restrict our choice to leads that may be used for further
reading. In order to limit the scope of this already extensive study, we shall also restrict this review to cells using
the standard genetic code, not considering the extremely
interesting attempts to reprogramme the code (for a
review see [3]). There is also interesting work developed in
vitro, that allows variations on the nature of the building
blocks of macromolecules, which will lead to fascinating
new aspects of the microbial (artificial) cell factory. We
shall not consider this further here (see for example [46]).
General versus particulars
Individual genes, from genomics to metagenomics
Genomes are most often viewed as bags of genes. While
this is not our personal view – we see genomes as highly
organized set of genes, certainly not randomly distributed
along the chromosomes [7], this is certainly a limited, but
sufficient view for a large area of biotechnology applications. When reading papers emphasizing the biotechnological potential of bacteria, it is not uncommon to
witness sentences like that one: « The completion of the
<name of species>genome sequencing project resulted in
the discovery of a number of new genes with potential
interest for biotechnological applications ».

Indeed, many biotechnological procedures still rest (and
will rest) on the isolation of individual genes, or series of
genes involved in the biosynthesis of a specific compound
(this is illustrated in the complex case of coenzyme B12
biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, for example [8]). Remarkably, it has become a practical fact that it is now much easier (and often significantly less costly) to sequence a
genome in its entirety than to isolate a gene of interest and
then submit it to mutagenesis for improvement. There are
already so many examples of this situation that they cannot be all given here. Many proteases, amylases, lipases
and other enzymes of general biotechnological interest
(in particular in agro-food industry) are side-products of
genes isolated from a variety of genomes [9-11]. As a vivid
and lively illustration of the potential of genome programs in the domain of complex molecules such as antibiotics, genes involved in non-ribosomal protein
synthesis are continuously collected from genomes,
sometimes in an unforeseen way. This was the case, for
example with the genome of the entomopathogen Photorhabus luminescens [12], that possesses a variety of such
highly complex « megasynthases » [13], when it was
assumed that most would be present in Gram positives,
Streptomyces species in particular [13-16], and certainly
not in enterobacteria. With this simple gene family

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/3/1/13

expanding exponentially in parallel with the genome programs trend, we need a focused resource to keep track of
important developments: the NRPS/PKS database provides us with an updated resource that tries to keep trace
of these interesting by-products of genomics certainly
promised to a bright future in the domain of chemistry of
fine chemicals [17].
The genome concept for identifying new genes of biotechnological interest has now been expanded to that of a «
metagenome », formed of communities of organisms
(often non-cultivatable) in a given environment [18,19].
This revived the interest for biotechnology of fine chemicals [20], that was proposed for a long time, but remained
of limited use. Gene prospecting has already been used to
extract interesting variants of genes coding for interesting
enzyme activities [21]. There are voices, however, that go
against that particular trend, emphasising that the variety
provided by artificial means will be much larger than that
conceivably produced during evolution [22]. However,
although chemistry is extremely efficient, some steps, in
particular associated with the chirality of molecules, are
costly in terms of the process and its yield. In contrast, chirality is an in-built property of life. We can therefore safely
speculate that we shall witness in the near future the use
of metagenomics for the revival of biotechnology processes in solving expensive bottlenecks in chemical industrial processes.
However interesting, these « single-gene » approaches
remain conceptually very limited, they only explore the
surface of what could be provided by the knowledge of
genomes. Furthermore, they often aim at the preparation
of a single enzyme, that is meant to be used in a process
that does not make use of the adaptation and maintenance potential of living organisms. In short, the cell is
not used for what it is in reality, a factory. This is however
dramatically changed with the advent of genomics as we
shall now see.
Functional genomics
Progresses in genome sequencing were followed by
attempts to better understand how a cell behaves as a
whole. The knowledge of complete genome sequences
permitted scientists to set up expression profiling techniques that play an ever increasing role in biotechnology
[23]. Indeed the corresponding knowledge can be used,
when the genome of a bacterium used in industry is
known, to improve its behaviour, stability, yield in production or security [24].

Many metabolic engineering strategies now use genomewide methodologies such as DNA sequencing, transcription profiling and global analysis of metabolites. These
techniques allow the identification of genetic differences

Page 2 of 6

Microbial Cell Factories 2004, 3:13

and provide insight into their cellular effects. Inverse metabolic engineering endeavours to map differences
between strains with different degree of a certain desired
phenotype and subsequent identification of factors conferring that phenotype. Briefly reviewed, expression profiling can be divided into three major branches that each
have a particular outcome, and gives a specific knowledge
on the organism.
The transcriptome
With all genes known from a cell it has been possible to
create DNA arrays sampling a subfamily or all genes on a
variety of physical supports. These arrays can subsequently been used to monitor the level of expression of
each gene in a particular condition. While this transcriptome approach is widely used, its interpretation is still a
matter of research [25,26] but is continuously improving
[26,27]. Indeed the very fact that an experiment has,
embedded in the data, a collective behaviour is until now
rarely used as such, while multifactorial analysis techniques would certainly provide new insights [28]. However transcriptome expression profiling has already had
considerable impact in biotechnology. A case in point is
improvement of lysine production, despite the fact that
this amino acid has previously been manufactured using
bacteria for more than 40 years [29].
The proteome
The second level of expression profiling is, of course, that
of the direct access to the gene products, the proteins.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has been developed
for thirty years, with considerable success, but it is still
extremely limited by the lack of reproducibility of 2-D gel
patterns [30]. Other methods try to by-pass the 2-D gel
step by direct coupling of high-performance mass spectrometry instrumentation with highly efficient chromatographic and electrophoretic separations [31]. While it is a
method of choice for qualitative studies, the latter however are usually difficult to use when one wishes to compare the outcome of several experiments. 2D-gel
electrophoresis appears therefore to have still a bright
future in the domain. Proteomic studies are complementary to transcriptome analysis [10,32-35], because translation efficiency is variable [36,37], and because mRNA
stability can also vary [38,39]. They are just beginning to
demonstrate their importance in the study of complexes
that organize the cell factory [40].
The metabolome
Fermentation processes often aim at producing a given
metabolite. The major problem facing industry in this
domain is to improve the production yield, often for
products that do not have a very high added-value (as
opposed to proteins used in medicine, for example), in a
background that has already been improved by genera-

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/3/1/13

tions of mutational improvement. Furthermore, many
metabolites have to be as pure as possible, trying to prevent contamination by side-products that may be toxic
[41]. It is therefore of importance to be able to analyse the
whole metabolite set of cultures growing in a variety of
conditions, and to relate it to gene expression [42,43], so
that educated guesses may be explored for improvement
of the processes of interest [44]. While there is currently
no efficient large-scale way to systematically monitor
metabolites in cells (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, for
example, is limited by its poor sensitivity to those metabolites that are at a high concentration in the cell and Mass
Spectrometry needs preliminary purification steps to sort
out the zoo of molecules generated in a cell) "metabolomics" is one of the most fashionable "omics" at present
[45,46]. It has already been used efficiently in the case of
focused production, such as synthesis of antibiotics [47].
There is little doubt that this domain will expand considerably in the near future [45].
Gene expression and genome organisation
The traditional way for biotechnology to improve its processes was to select mutants having interesting properties
(in terms of stability, resistance to foreign agents such as
viruses, and of course metabolite or biomass production).
This required long and tedious procedures where relevant
features were usually gradually improving [48]. However
these slow changes had a remarkable, although unobtrusive, consequence. Rather than involving isolated mutations, in many cases a coordinate set of mutations was
improving the quality of production. Unfortunately, in
the absence of direct access to the genome sequence, it was
not possible either to identify or to tell those which were
important and those which were dispensable. Furthermore, even when the sequence is known it is far from
being straightforward to tell, from the differences
observed with the parent strains, what are the important
ones. Genomics, with all its "omics" complements, nevertheless completely changed the picture, and it is now possible to optimise production knowingly, using molecular
targets that are directly extracted from knowledge of the
genome. This has been applied for example in the case of
the much studied Corynebacterium glutamicum [49].

Further progress is certainly possible. It is important to try
to understand whether genomes are simply random collection of genes, or whether they show rules, that might be
exploited for using cells as factories. Remarkably, at least
in bacteria, the organisation of the genome reflects some
kind of optimisation of gene expression [50]. Genes do
not work in isolation, and their products, even in bacteria,
are likely to be compartmentalised. The study of the landscape of all neighborhoods of a gene (proximity in the
chromosome, codon usage bias, phylogeny of its products, electric charge, amino acid composition, participa-

Microbial Cell Factories 2004, 3:13

tion in complexes, and even a neighborhood benefiting
from the expertise of other scientists, such as the co-occurrence of gene names in a same article – "in biblio") provides a systemic view that must be used to optimise the
behavior of the cell [51].
While this has not yet, to our knowledge, be taken into
consideration for improvement of production by industrial strains, it is more than likely that this will be performed in the near future (in fact it is likely that
optimisation of the global properties of gene or gene
islands text has already been used for the industrial production of proteins, but because protection by patenting
is difficult, if this has been done the corresponding knowhow is likely to be protected by secrecy). Regulation of
gene expression is also of major interest. It must be understood however that this feature of life is evolving much
more rapidly than catalytic or structural components of
the cell. One should therefore be cautious in extrapolating
knowledge from an organism to another one. Theoretical
studies, associated to validation experiments have now
begun to decipher the rules that govern regulation of gene
expression, and it is certainly already possible to construct
subtle regulation systems [52], that are much more
sophisticated than the ubiquitous on/off systems using
positive or negative control of transcription [53-56].
Among the recent discoveries that will play a considerable
role in genome-mediated control of gene expression is
that of riboswitches [57]. This mode of control seems to
be ubiquitous, but significantly different between Gram
negatives and Gram positives (where it appears to be more
widely spread). It is still early to have an exact idea of the
impact on industrial processes, but the very fact that many
coenzymes (vitamins) biosynthetic pathways are controlled using riboswitches warrants further exploration.
In the same way quorum-sensing has much to say for the
control of gene expression at high cell density [58]. Until
now this general control process – which is still under
investigation – has not been explicitly used to control production in cell factories. It seems likely that, once deciphered in its details, it will be a parameter introduced in
large-scale productions. The recent serendipitous discovery that borate was involved in the construction of the
mediator AI-2 (autoinducer-2) demonstrates however
that unexpected features should always be considered as a
possibility when a process does not go entirely as planned
[59].
Model cell factories
Many bacteria have been used as cell factories. In most
cases this was to produce small molecules (in particular
antibiotics, vitamins and amino acids). These bacteria
were usually the result of continuous improvement using

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/3/1/13

standard mutagenesis/screening techniques of bacteria
isolated in the wild. Streptomyces species, for example,
account for a large number of antibiotics production.
Streptomyces lividans [60], Corynebacterium glutamicum
[61], Bacillus subtilis [24], Escherichia coli [62], Zymomonas
mobilis [63], to give a few names, are used not only as
models but also as large-scale production factories. Perhaps the largest scale production fermenters (often 150
m3) are now growing Xanthomonas campestris, used as a
supplement not only in food, but also in dentrifrice,
housekeeping products and even in painting, to prevent it
from making drops [64]. In the past decades even larger
fermenters were used to produce biomass or ethanol, a
trend that was abandoned with cheap oil prices, but that
will most probably resume its older importance as the
price of oil rises sharply.
Among those, most bacteria were chosen for their industrial purpose, as a prime intention. As a consequence,
until the advent of genome programs, they were only
known for their physiological and physico-chemical
properties in fermenters, with limited knowledge of their
genetic properties. This was such an inconvenience that,
very early on, industry explored the usability of the universal model E. coli as a ubiquitous cell factory. This trend
was particularly emphasized as soon as genetic engineering techniques were developed, as early as in the early
eighties, with the construction of new vectors for expressing foreign proteins at will (e.g. [65]). Mid-eighties many
proteins of medical interest were produced using E. coli as
the factory. This is still so today, with only little shift to the
use of other bacterial species as factories. This was initially
limited to high added-value products, allowing for very
expensive purification steps and compliance to very tight
regulations. In quite a few cases however E. coli and sometimes other model bacteria, in which appropriate genes
were introduced either on plasmids or in the chromosome, was highly efficient in producing low cost metabolites [66]. Escherichia coli is even used in the production of
amino acids, in industrial quantities, a production that
was initially reserved to specific mutants of species that
had been slowly improved over the years.
GRAS organisms, such as AT-rich Gram positives, such as
B. subtilis, are much more difficult to use, except for biomass production, or secreted proteins, because heterologous protein expression is difficult there. This has been
understood after the genome was deciphered, as a consequence of the poorly versatile control of translation initiation (lack of ribosomal S1 protein in particular [67]), as
well as of the large number of proteases harbored by the
organism [68].
Taken together these observations suggest the rational
choice of a new organism that would play the role of a

Page 4 of 6

Microbial Cell Factories 2004, 3:13

ubiquitous cell factory. This organism should have several
properties. It should be non pathogenic, and its envelope
should not trigger inflammation reactions in animals
(Man included). It should be easily transformable and
allow recombination with linear DNA, with as little
matches needed for recombination as possible. It should
grow fast at temperature compatible with the size of fermenters (metabolic activity heats up the medium), and it
should reach high cell density. More specialized views,
adapted to specific productions will also be considered at
some point, but it will be interesting to witness the choice
of new model bacteria in the new era of the cell-factory.

Conclusions
Bacteria have been used as factories for a long time. A first
step to rationalize this approach has been met with the
first genetic engineering of E. coli, producing heterologous
proteins. As we now sequence a new genome every third
day or so, it is clear that we will be able soon to understand the core of bacterial life, and probably be able to
choose new models, better suited to the goals of industry.
However we must always remember that life is full of surprises, even in the best explored domains: who would
have thought that E. coli communicates with its kins using
the boron atom? Discovery cannot be planned, and the
most surprising observations, that have the most considerable consequences in terms of applications of research,
come from studies that are totally academic in nature
(who would have thought that the discovery of RNAi
would have come from the study of variagation in petunia
flowers?). One should not mix up domains: discovery
first, and this needs a considerable degree of freedom of
choice in the topics explored, and then, naturally, one can
think of applications of research. Constructing the best of
bacterial cell factory would be such a goal.
