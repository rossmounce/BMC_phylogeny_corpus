Viruses in reptiles
Ellen Ariel

Abstract
The etiology of reptilian viral diseases can be attributed to a wide range of viruses occurring across different genera
and families. Thirty to forty years ago, studies of viruses in reptiles focused mainly on the zoonotic potential of
arboviruses in reptiles and much effort went into surveys and challenge trials of a range of reptiles with eastern and
western equine encephalitis as well as Japanese encephalitis viruses. In the past decade, outbreaks of infection with
West Nile virus in human populations and in farmed alligators in the USA has seen the research emphasis placed on
the issue of reptiles, particularly crocodiles and alligators, being susceptible to, and reservoirs for, this serious zoonotic
disease. Although there are many recognised reptilian viruses, the evidence for those being primary pathogens is
relatively limited. Transmission studies establishing pathogenicity and cofactors are likewise scarce, possibly due to
the relatively low commercial importance of reptiles, difficulties with the availability of animals and permits for
statistically sound experiments, difficulties with housing of reptiles in an experimental setting or the inability to
propagate some viruses in cell culture to sufficient titres for transmission studies. Viruses as causes of direct loss of
threatened species, such as the chelonid fibropapilloma associated herpesvirus and ranaviruses in farmed and wild
tortoises and turtles, have re-focused attention back to the characterisation of the viruses as well as diagnosis and
pathogenesis in the host itself.

1. Introduction
The etiology of reptilian viral diseases can be attributed to
a wide range of viruses occurring across different genera
and families. Thirty to forty years ago, studies of viruses in
reptiles focused mainly on the zoonotic potential of arboviruses in reptiles and much effort went into surveys and
challenge trials of a range of reptiles with eastern and
western equine encephalitis as well as Japanese encephalitis viruses [1-3]. In the past decade, outbreaks of infection
with West Nile virus in human populations and in farmed
alligators in the USA have seen the research emphasis
placed on the issue of reptiles, particularly crocodiles and
alligators, being susceptible to, and reservoirs for, this
serious zoonotic disease [4-7]. Although there are many

importance of reptiles, difficulties with the availability of
animals and permits for statistically sound experiments,
difficulties with housing of reptiles in an experimental
setting or the inability to propagate some viruses in cell
culture to sufficient titres for transmission studies. Viruses
as causes of direct loss of threatened species, such as the
chelonid fibropapilloma associated herpesvirus and ranaviruses in farmed and wild tortoises and turtles, have refocused attention back on the characterisation of the
viruses [8,9] as well as diagnosis and pathogenesis in the
host itself [10-13].

2. Methods for working with reptilian viruses
Generally, diagnosis of reptilian viruses can be
approached like all other viruses. Histopathology can give
the initial indication of a viral infection and most infections are described alongside the pathological changes
they induce. Some viruses have been isolated, characterized and used in challenge trials or to produce specific
antisera for immunological tests, but like all other fields
of virology, reptilian virus researchers are venturing into
both serological surveys and molecular tools for diagnosing viral infections [8,14-20].
Isolation of viruses in culture has the advantage of
amplifying the agent for easier identification and characterisation, but also for use in transmission studies. Specific reptilian cell lines are available that will support viral
growth and for some viruses display cytopathic effect,
where others do not cause CPE or do not grow at all in
known cell culture systems. For those cell lines that support propagation of a particular virus, the temperature
regime for both cell lines and viral growth will be different from mammalian systems due to the poikilothermic
nature of reptiles. Zoonotic viruses have been isolated
from reptiles since 1939 when Rosenbusch isolated Western Equine Encephalitis from a Bothrops alternate, followed by Japanese encephalitis virus from snakes,
calicivirus from snakes, a flavivirus-like agent from tortoises and West Nile virus from alligators using either
mammalian derived cell lines at 37°C or mosquito cell
lines at 28°C [7,21-25]. Several other reptilian viruses will
grow in cell lines derived from mammals such as Vero
cells or in cell lines derived from fish [26,27]. Clark and
Karzon isolated a herpesvirus from iguana in tissue
explants from an apparently healthy iguana in 1972 [28]
and since then several reptilian cell culture systems have
been established and are now available from the American Type Culture Collection. Paramyxovirus grows readily in cobra eggs, viper heart, gecko embryo and
rattlesnake fibroma cell lines [29,30] and ranavirus will
grow in a variety of cell lines including fish cell lines at a
range of temperatures below 30°C [27].
Where electron microscopy (EM) used to be the ultimate diagnostic tool for viruses, polymerase chain reaction

Page 2 of 12

(PCR) has revolutionized our ability to identify infectious
agents with generic and specific primers used for diagnosis. Subsequent sequencing of the viral genome opens
possibilities for fast characterization, insight into their phylogenetic relationship and epidemiological investigations.
The drastic decrease in the cost of sequencing has turned
the diagnostic attention to molecular methods, which has
the added advantage of accurate diagnosis and the subsequent possibility of reproducing the antigenic part of the
virus, irrespective of our ability to culture the viral pathogen in vitro. However electron microscopy still has a diagnostic role since agents identified under the EM scope
may direct the diagnostician toward selecting the best primers to use.
With the current trend and affordable sequencing
costs, researchers will keep looking for and finding
viruses in reptiles at a great rate and over the next decade
we are likely to see the clades being populated with new
findings, known isolates being placed into taxonomic
relationships and possibly revealing genetic virulence
markers.

3. Reptilian viruses described by virus families
The type of genome and the presence of an envelope are
important in the replication strategy of viruses and subsequently the possibilities of diagnosis, prevention and control of the associated disease. The viral families in this
review are presented with like groups as indicated in
Table 1, and not in order of importance.
3.1. Herpesviridae

Herpesvirus infections appear to manifest as acute signs
which may turn latent and be quiescent for the rest of the
animal’s life, or until the host becomes sufficiently stressed
for the virus to reappear as a disease [31]. Reptilian herpesviruses fall into the family Herpesviridae together with
mammalian and avian herpesviruses. Chelonid herpesvirus
5 and 6 in marine turtles are unassigned species in the
Subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and although other reptilian
herpesviruses are still unassigned by the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), molecular
characterisation of available isolates places them within
the Subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae in the proposed genus
Chelonivirus [32-34]. Originally herpesviruses were classified according to their host, disease signs and morphology
as determined by EM, where the current methods are
based on sequencing of the viruses followed by phylogenetic analysis. Because many of the viruses described prior
to development of these methods have not or cannot be
sequenced, there is some confusion as to their taxonomic
position. This review will use the classification of chelonian herpesviruses based on sequence analysis as proposed
by Bicknese et al. [34] with the ICTV classification in
brackets when known.

Chelonid fibropapilloma-associated herpesvirus
(CFPHV) (Chelonid herpesvirus 5), is associated with the
development of fibropapillomas and fibromas in marine
turtles in all tropical waters, both externally on the epidermis, eyes, carapace and plastron, and in severe cases on
the serosal surface of internal organs [35-40]. Fibropapillomatosis (FP) is a major chronic disease of juvenile green
turtles and was considered the most significant cause of
strandings and mortality in waters around Florida [41] and
Hawaii [42]. An infection by fibropapillomatosis herpesvirus appears to be associated with oncogenesis under certain circumstances and considerable research effort has
focused on the resultant disease: fibropapillomatosis of
marine turtles [8,13,39,41,43-45].
Although many biotic factors such as leeches, mites,
other viruses and algal blooms as well as abiotic environmental factors and adjacent land use are associated with
FP of wild turtles [32,34,46-49], the CFPHV is implicated
as the etiological agent of the disease [20,43,50-52]. It is
suspected to operate under certain environmental conditions and in synergy with immune system modulators
which may influence the persistence and severity of the
lesions [38,40,44,53,54]. Wildlife and environmental
management agencies are particularly concerned due to
the potential population impact this disease could exert
on otherwise threatened species [55].
The lung-eye-trachea disease-associated virus (LETV)
(Chelonid herpesvirus 6), was first described in 1 year old
green turtles raised in mariculture. As the name implies,
the virus affects the eyes and respiratory tract of the turtles and has a clinical course of 2-3 weeks. The virus was
cultured in green turtle kidney cells and initially visualized by EM [56]. The ability of LETV to grow in vitro
has enabled further study of this virus and the

Page 3 of 12

development of serological tools to detect previous exposure to the virus in turtles [57,58].
Grey Patch Disease (GPD)-associated virus (Chelonid
herpesvirus 1) affecting cultured green turtle hatchlings
(Chelonia mydas) was reported to cause mortalities in 520% of the severely afflicted animals [59]. The disease
appeared as circular papular skin lesions coalescing into
diffuse grey skin lesions with superficial epidermal necrosis
and can affect 90-100% of all hatchlings. The lesions were
characterised by hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia with
acanthosis. Epidermal cells displayed basophilic intranuclear inclusions and marginated chromatin. Intranuclear
enveloped particles of 160-180 nm with an electron dense
core of 105-120 nm were visualised by EM. Transmission
is thought to be vertical or water-borne [59]. Sudden
changes in water temperature could bring about the onset
of symptoms in tank reared turtles [60], with low water
temperatures leading to a longer lasting but less severe
disease than high water temperatures [61].
Two herpesviruses from loggerhead turtles (Caretta
caretta) were identified by PCR in lesions of moribund
animals [32]. One virus was termed the “loggerhead genital-respiratory herpesvirus” (LGRV), and the other the
“loggerhead orocutaneous herpesvirus” (LOCV) according to the lesions they were identified from. Both viruses
were thought to be opportunistic in debilitated turtles.
Tortoise Herpesviruses
Herpesviruses are now commonly identified in tortoises of zoological collections due to improved diagnostic methods and several strains have been described and
classified into tortoise herpesviruses 1 to 4 (THV1-4)
[34,62-64]. Pathological changes caused by herpesvirus
infections in tortoises include hepatitis, stomatitis,
respiratory tract infection, conjunctivitis and central nervous system involvement [65-70].
Elapid herpesvirus (Indian cobra herpesvirus) was
associated with degeneration and focal necrosis of
columnar glandular epithelial cells in the venom gland
of Siamese cobras (Naja naja kaouthia) with reduced
venom production [71].
Herpesviruses have also been detected in lizards: Green
lizard herpesvirus was identified in Green lizard papillomas. It was accompanied by two other viruses [72], and
may have been an incidental finding of an otherwise latent
infection. Herpesviruses were also identified in lizards with
stomatitis [73,74] and were named Varanid herpesvirus 1 or gerrhosaurid herpesviruses 1-3. Iguanid herpesvirus 1
was isolated during routine tissue explants from the spleen,
kidney and heart of a normal adult Iguana iguana [28].
3.2. Iridoviridae
3.2.1 Ranavirus

Ranavirus is a genus in the Iridoviridae family represented by the type species Frog Virus 3 (FV3). Previous

Ariel Veterinary Research 2011, 42:100

accounts of iridovirus causing systemic infections were
later classified as ranavirus in many cases. Ranavirus has
received increasing attention due to its involvement in
serious diseases of fish and amphibians to the extent that
epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV) in fish
and ranavirus in general for amphibians meet the criteria
for listing by the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE) [75]. Ranaviruses have been implicated in the
world-wide decline of amphibians and mass mortalities
in both aquaculture and wild fish stock. Some of these
isolates are very similar on a serological and molecular
level [76-80] and have been reported to be able to infect
hosts across classes [10,81,82]. This ability of the virus
has the potential to compromise prevention and control
measures, since amphibians, reptiles and fish may act as
reservoir species for each other.
Until recently, overt diseases in reptiles caused by systemic iridovirus were only rarely reported: namely in a
spur-tailed Mediterranean land tortoise, Testudo hermanni
[83] and a gopher tortoise (Bopherus polyphemus) [84].
However, with increased awareness, several instances of
severe mortality events in reptiles associated with ranavirus infections have been described in the last decade in
both zoological collections [9,85-87], free-ranging [10],
and farmed reptiles [88]. Retrospective studies of archival
material may bring even more cases to light. Challenge
studies were carried out on red eared sliders (Trachemys
scripta elegans) with a ranavirus isolate from Burmese Star
tortoise. The red eared sliders developed clinical signs and
lesions consistent with those observed in the Burmese tortoises. Virions were observed in lesions by EM and ranavirus was re-isolated from challenged animals [89].
Ranavirus infections of reptiles appear to target multiple
organs including the stomach, oesophagus, lungs, spleen,
liver and kidney, although some isolates may have a
propensity for infecting the respiratory tract [10,85,87].
Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be identified in
some cases and in addition to virus isolation in established
cell lines [27], diagnosis is made on the basis of immuno
assays and PCR targeting the major capsid protein or the
polymerase gene [78,87,90]. Benetka et al., [91] reported
co-infection with ranavirus and chelonid herpesvirus in a
severely ill leopard tortoise. The diagnosis was made by
PCR from pharyngeal and oral swabs, but the tortoise was
also compromised by a mixed bacterial infection and
recovered after antibiotic treatment, showing that ranavirus may have been a co-infection or a pre-disposing
factor rather than the primary cause of the disease. Ranaviruses are easily cultured in vitro and their genome has
been studied extensively [78,82,90,92].
3.2.2 Erythrocytic virus

Cytoplasmic inclusions in erythrocytes of amphibians, fish
and reptiles have long been known to be of iridoviral origin due to light and EM [93-96]. The infection could

Page 4 of 12

possibly contribute to anaemia in the host although the
clinical significance is not clear. Recently, Wellehan et al.
characterised an erythrocytic iridovirus by means of molecular techniques and found that it falls in a group all of its
own within the Iridoviridae and may represent a new
genus [97].
3.2.3 Iridovirus

Although viruses in this genus mostly occur in invertebrates, they do occasionally occur in reptiles [98] and may
contribute to disease, but the latter is not clear. Viruses
from this genus are, however, often isolated from the prey
animals of reptiles, for example commercially grown crickets fed to lizards, and could be incidental residents in the
reptile hosts rather than actually infecting and replicating
in them [99]. They do grow in reptilian cell lines such as
Viper Heart (VH-2) and Terrapene Heart (TH-1) which
indicate that they can infect reptiles and isolates from a
chameleon (Chamaeloe hoehnelii) were found to be highly
pathogenic to crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) [99] showing
that reptiles may be reservoirs for an invertebrate virus.
3.3. Poxviridae

Poxviruses have been identified in skin lesions of Caiman
sclerops and Caiman crocodilus fuscus [100-102] Crocodylus niloticus, C. porosus and C. johnstoni [103-107].
The lesions presented as brown raised ulcers on the ventral skin, the head region or in the oral cavity. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions were observed within
hypertrophied epithelial cells. At higher magnification
(EM) the inclusions were seen to be viral arrays consisting of pox-like virions 100-200 nm in diameter, which is
small compared to poxviruses of other vertebrates and
insects. In all cases, morbidity was high, and mortality
low, but due to the disfiguring nature of the disease, it is
still an economically important disease for crocodile
farming. A single case of poxvirus in the deep epidermal
cells of a Hermann tortoise (Testudo hermanni) that succumbed to broncho-pneumonia [108], a co-infection
with Chlamydia in a flap-necked chameleon (Chamaeleo
dilepsis) [109] and a tegu (Tupinambis teguixin) with
poxviral dermatitis that healed spontaneously over four
months have also been reported [110], but generally, poxvirus infections of reptiles do not seem to be widespread.
Molecular analysis by Afonso et al. [111] places crocodile
pox virus from Nile crocodiles in a new proposed genus
within the Chordopoxvirinae.
3.4. Adenoviridae

Adenoviruses cause respiratory infections in many vertebrate species. Infections have been diagnosed in crocodiles, [112,113], snakes [17,114-116], lizards [17,117-119]
and turtles [120,121]. Infections in reptiles can be accompanied by lethargy, neurological disorder, esophagitis,
hepatitis, splenitis or gastroenteritis [114,117,118,121].

Ariel Veterinary Research 2011, 42:100
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/100

Adenovirus was isolated in vitro from a lizard [17] and a
Corn snake, where the subsequent cytopathic effect
(CPE) observed in cell cultures included intranuclear
inclusion bodies and finally cell lysis [122]. Diagnosis of
adenovirus is now largely done by molecular tools such
as PCR directly on swabs or organs followed by sequencing [123] or in situ hybridisation of formalin fixed
tissues [124].
A great amount of work has gone into the phylogenetic
analysis of adenoviruses, which has resulted in the proposal for creation of three new genera recently in addition
to the Mastadenovirus and Aviadenovirus genera which
traditionally covered mammalian and avian adenoviruses
respectively [125]. The latest addition is Ictadenovirus
which hosts a single member from a fish, namely the
White sturgeon adenovirus 1. Atadenovirus was named
according to the very high A+T genome base composition in some of the early viruses in this group, which
encompass viruses from reptilian, avian and mammalian
hosts. Until recently, all reptile adenoviruses belonged to
the Atadenovirus genus indicating strong co-evolution of
the host and virus. Siadenoviruses have a very small genome (30 kb) and a putative sialidase gene at the terminus
of the genome, which gave rise to the name of this genus
[126]. In 2009, Rivera et al. characterised an adenovirus
from Sulawesi tortoises (Indotestudo forsteni) by
sequence analysis as a novel adenovirus of the genus Siadenovirus which currently makes it the only reptile virus
in this genus [127]. The chelonian adenovirus recently
described by Farkas [121] does not fit into any of the
recognized genera of the adenovirus family.
3.5. Papillomaviridae

Two side-necked turtles (Platemys platycephala) exhibited symptoms of circular papular skin lesions on the
head and forelimbs [128]. Histological examination of the
epidermis revealed hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia with
acanthosis, but no inclusions were observed. Intranuclear
crystalline arrays of hexagonal particles of 42 nm
diameter were visualised by electron microscopy. The
particles resembled papilloma virions similar to those
seen in mammalian wart lesions [128]. Drury et al. identified papilloma-like particles in lung-washings of a Horsfield Russian tortoise [62].
Papilloma-associated viruses were also identified via EM
of benign papillomas from Green lizards (Lacerta viridis)
by Raynaud and Adrian [72]. The virions were found only
in the highly keratinised regions of the papillomas and displayed morphologies similar to papillomavirus, herpesvirus
and reovirus. These mixed viral infections were consistent
in the three animals examined. None of the viruses were
cultivated in vitro [72]. Although the etiological agent of
the papillomas could not be determined with confidence,
the papillomavirus was implicated because this group is

Page 5 of 12

often associated with papillomas in mammals [129]. The
other two viruses may have been incidental findings.
Lately, papillomavirus was reported in samples from
sea turtles, green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead
turtle (Caretta caretta) with fibropapillomatosis [32,130].
Herbst et al. [49] characterised the two papillomaviruses
and found that they fall into a distinct chelonian clade.
3.6. Parvoviridae

The only parvovirus recorded in reptiles is the Dependovirus which requires the presence of an adenovirus infection for replication. This virus was found associated with
an adenovirus in intestinal epithelium of several snake
species [114,131-133] and in the intestinal tract and liver
of a bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps [119,134]. The
virus was isolated from a royal python and identified as
serpentine adeno-associated virus by Farkas et al. [133].
3.7. Reoviridae

Reoviruses can cause severe and often fatal disease in
reptiles typically presenting as pneumonia and neurological disorder [135-137]. Reovirus were isolated from the
kidney, liver and spleen of a moribund python (Python
regius) and from the brain of a rattlesnake exhibiting
neurological symptoms [26,136]. The isolates grew in
iguana (IgH2) and Vero cells respectively and displayed a
CPE of syncytical giant cell formation [136] typical of
reptilian reovirus [138]. Lamirande et al. isolated reovirus
from two dead elaphid snakes and were able to induce
pneumonia and tracheitis in a black ratsnake (Elaphe
obsolete), re-isolate the virus and induce similar symptoms in another black ratsnake [137]. A reovirus was also
one of three viruses associated with papillomas in the
Green lizard Lacerta viridis [72]. Reoviruses are fusogenic
and grow readily in cell culture [138]. Identification is by
PCR and subsequent genomic analysis of reptilian isolates has so far placed them all in the Orthoreovirus
genus [135].
3.8. Retroviridae and inclusion body disease of Boid
snakes

Retroviruses often appear as incidental findings with no
disease reported in turtles, crocodiles, tuataras, a Komodo
dragon and snakes [19,139-142]. They have been associated with tumours in snakes though [143,144]. One of
the most commonly reported disease in captive snakes is
the inclusion body disease of Boid snakes and although
the etiology of the disease is unknown [145], a retroviral
infection is often associated [146-149]. The disease is characterised by intracytoplasmic inclusions consisting of a
distinctive protein and affected snakes exhibit neurological
disorders and regurgitation of food in some species, associated with stomatitis, pneumonia and tumours [150]. The
disease may be subclinical, protracted for months or

Ariel Veterinary Research 2011, 42:100
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/100

terminal within a few weeks of first clinical signs. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be present in
epithelial cells of all major organs, and meningo-encephalitis is prominent. Supernatant from primary cell cultures
of the kidney from an infected boa constrictor (Boa constrictor) was inoculated into young Burmese pythons
(Python molurus bivittatus) with a resultant IBD development [151]. This disease is often found in snakes from collections with severe mite infestations [145].
With the advance of molecular techniques, endogenous
retroviruses are identified in many vertebrates, including
reptiles [146]. Huder et al. found highly expressed retroviral activity in all individuals of Python curtus but not in
other boid species, irrespective of them displaying the
symptoms of inclusion body disease which further clouds
the etiological origins of this disease [146].
3.9. Arboviruses

Arboviruses are arthropod borne viruses that multiply in
both the arthropod vector and the vertebrate host [152].
Many are pathogenic to humans, but reptiles and amphibians can represent an alternative host in which the virus
may overwinter in hibernating reptiles and in some cases
produce overt disease [153]. Some flaviviruses, togaviruses,
rhabdoviruses and a bunyavirus found in reptiles have
been classified as arboviruses.
Chaco, Timbo and Marco rhabdoviruses were isolated
from the lizard Ameiva ameiva and classified by EM
[154]. They grew well in mammalian cell lines with an
optimal temperature of 30°C and showed no serological
cross-reactivity with other rhabdoviruses [155]. Despite
their classification as arboviruses, it still remains unclear
if Chaco, Timbo and Marco viruses are able to create sufficient viremia to serve as a source for arthropod infection and the infection was not associated with disease in
the reptilian host [156]. Likewise, a virus identified as
Bunyamwera was isolated from a turtle (Trionyx spinifer
emoryi) during a survey of reptiles in Texas in 1970 and
71 [157]. There is no report on the health of the turtle,
but the case confirms the role of reptiles as reservoirs for
viruses that cause severe disease in humans.
3.9.1. Flaviviridae

Antibodies to St Louis encephalitis virus and Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) have been reported from turtles
and snakes [158-160]. Lee et al. [22] isolated JEV from a
Chinese rat snake (Elaphe rufodorsata) and in 2001,
Drury et al. isolated a flavivirus-like agent from a tortoise
[25]. Much of the early evidence for flavivirus infection in
reptiles is associated with investigations into their role as
reservoirs for this zoonosis, but rarely was the infection
reported with disease. When a new strain of West Nile
Fever crossed the Atlantic in 1999 and continued across
the United States from east to west, much effort went
into finding alternative hosts and reservoirs for the virus,

Page 6 of 12

focussing the attention back to reptiles among other
animals.
Sero-surveys detected antibodies to West Nile Fever
virus (WNV) in farmed Nile crocodiles in Israel, farmed
crocodiles in Mexico, wild alligators in Florida and freerange American alligators in Louisiana [5,6,153,161]. The
virus was found to be associated with disease and mortality in farmed alligators in Georgia, Louisiana and Florida
[153,162,163]. Alligators with symptoms in Florida were
investigated and a very high load of WNV was detected
in the livers with pathological changes in multiple organs
[153]. A subsequent transmission study proved the
pathogenicity of the isolate to inoculated and cohabiting
alligators [7].
3.9.2. Togaviridae

This group of viruses includes members such as Eastern
equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis [152]. Although infection by these viruses appears to
be common according to antibody surveys, which
detected antibodies against the viruses in several snake,
lizard, turtle and one crocodilian species [157,164], there
is little evidence of them causing disease in the reptile
hosts. Rather, reptiles may function as reservoir hosts
due to their low metabolic rate and subsequent reduced
immune response in winter [164].
Experimental infection of snakes and tortoises show
them to be highly susceptible [1] with viraemia lasting
from 3 to 105 days post infection depending on temperature [2]. Hayes et al. found that neutralising antibody persisted for at least 44 days after the viraemia had
subsided [1]. Higher ambient temperatures during the
experimental trials appeared to raise the titre of antibodies against the virus and reduce the duration of an
infection [2].
Isolation of togaviruses from reptiles has been attempted
predominantly from blood samples with variable results
[152,165]. This may be due to the cyclical nature of viremias [166]. Rosenbusch was able to isolate WEEV from
the brain of Bothrops alternata, but not from the blood,
showing that blood may not be the best organ for viral isolation, and that the virus may replicate in other organs
during periods of low or no viremia [21].
One incidence of feeding by an WEEV-infected mosquito (Culex tarsalis) was sufficient to transmit the infection to a garter snake [167]. Viremia lasted 70 days post
hibernation in snakes that were bitten by infected mosquitoes before hibernation [168]. Conversely, 31% of mosquitoes became infected after feeding on snakes with low
level viremia. Vertical transmission between infected
mothers and offspring has also been documented for
WEEV in garter snakes [165]. A three years survey of
blood meals from mosquitoes in an EEEV endemic area in
Alabama [169,147] revealed that 75% were from reptiles.

This is another example of how a human pathogen can be
transmitted to, harboured in, and recovered from reptiles
with the aid of an arthropod vector.
3.10. Caliciviridae

Sixteen isolates of calicivirus were obtained from four species of poikilothermic animals in a zoological collection
[23]. Eight Aruba Island rattlesnakes (Crotalus unicolor)
were asymptomatic and isolation was obtained by rectal
swab. The other eight isolates were obtained at necropsy
of animals found dead in their cages. These included four
Aruba Island rattlesnakes, two Bell horned frogs (Ceratophrys orata), one rock rattlesnake (C. lepidus) and one
eyelash viper (Bothrops schlegeli). Histopathology revealed
a variety of inconsistent lesions in the necropsied animals.
The isolates grew in Vero cells at 37°C and were identified
by physicochemical characteristics as belonging to the
Caliciviridae. The 16 isolates were antigenically indistinguishable and the strain was designated as reptilian calicivirus Crotalus type 1. These isolates were compared to
isolates from feral pinnipeds (San Miguel sea lion calicivirus) and were found to be closely related at the serological and genomic level [170,171], further adding to
speculations into how this virus is transmitted between
terrestrial reptiles and marine mammals [172].
3.11. Picornaviridae

The only record of picornavirus in reptiles is by Helbstad
and Bestetti [114]. A boa constrictor with signs of gastrointestinal disease and central nervous system disorder, displayed groups of necrotic cells with intranuclear inclusion
bodies throughout the intestinal tract, the liver, pancreas
and spleen. Perivascular cuffing was observed in the
meninges together with leukoencephalopathy. Adenovirus
virions were visualised by EM in the duodenum and
spleen, as were picornavirus virions. The latter were small,
22-27 nm diameter, spheroidal and arranged in rows or
lattice formation in the cytoplasm of necrotic cells [114].
An Aesculapian snake showed loss of appetite, abnormal
faeces and regurgitation. Upon EM examination four different types of viruses were identified in its duodenum,
one of which was a picornavirus [114]. In these mixed
infections it is difficult to attribute certain pathological
changes to a specific virus, and the picornavirus may
merely have been an incidental finding of a non-virulent
virus. It should however, be noted that other picornaviruses, the human and porcine enteroviruses, manifest
first in the alimentary canal, then proceed to the brain,
where they can cause encephalitis with subsequent neurological disorders [173].
3.12. Paramyxoviridae

Several epizootics in snake collections have been attributed to a paramyxovirus infection. The first record was

Page 7 of 12

from Switzerland, with a respiratory disease of farmed
Fer-de-lance snakes (Bothrops atrox) causing up to 87%
mortality in individual rooms [174]. Subsequent outbreaks
were reported in rock rattlesnakes (Crotalus lepidus) and
several viper species [30] as well as non-viper species
[175-178]. Paramyxovirus has also been reported from the
respiratory tract of lizards with pneumonia [179,180].
Antibody surveys of captive and wild-caught lizards show
that they often have elevated antibody titres against paramyxovirus [181-185].
Terminally ill snakes can display neural symptoms
[30,186]. However, the target organ seems to be the
respiratory tract. Post mortem examination often reveals
fluid filled lungs and body cavity [175,187]. Lesions are
observed in the lungs and occasionally in the brain. An
immuno-histochemical survey of sections from suspected
ophidian paramyxovirus infection confirmed that the
lungs are the main target organ for the virus and that
there is multifocal cytoplasmic staining of infected cells
[175].
Virus was isolated from the lungs and brain of infected
snakes by propagation in cobra eggs, viper heart, gecko
embryo, rattlesnake fibroma and Vero cell lines
[29,30,188]. The virus grows better at 28°C than at 37°C,
produces syncytia and eventually destroys the cell layer
[189].
Electron microscopy of in vitro propagated virus showed
the virions to be pleomorphic, spheroidal or filamentous
particles budding from plasma membranes or as mature
enveloped particles in the cytoplasm [187,188,190].
Paramyxovirus have also been isolated from a Hermann
tortoise (Testudo hermannii) with pneumonia and identified in faeces of farmed Nile crocodiles [113,191]. However, these virions could potentially have derived from
infected chickens fed to the crocodiles, rather than from
an active gastrointestinal infection of the crocodiles
themselves.
On a genomic level, paramyxoviruses from snakes and
lizards are closely related, while the one isolate from the
tortoise was in the same cluster but more distant to the
other isolates [191]. The same study confirmed that the
paramyxoviruses of reptiles are distinct from those isolated
from other animals and are genetically sufficiently different
from other paramyxoviruses to have their own proposed
genus: Ferlavirus within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae
with Fer-de-Lance virus as the type species [16,192].

4. Summary
A multitude of viruses exists in reptiles, some of which
are described above, and no doubt many more will be
described in the future. Some, but not all cause disease
and most of them are not very well studied in terms of
virulence, pathogenicity, phylogeny and fulfilment of
Koch’s postulate, which requires cultivation and

Ariel Veterinary Research 2011, 42:100
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/100

challenge trials. For viruses like CFPHV that cannot be
cultured in vitro, the association with fibropapillomatosis
is very strong, but apparently other cofactors are needed
before it becomes pathogenic. Transmission may in some
cases be via vectors such as arthropods or leeches,
whereas others by direct contact presumably, but most
transmission routes are unknown. The risk of transfer of
viruses between reptiles and humans is negligible due to
the thermoregulatory differences between reptilian and
mammalian hosts which would limit the suite of pathogens able to grow in both temperature regimes. However,
some zoonotic potential exists when certain reptiles act
as reservoirs for arboviruses that are pathogenic to
humans such as West Nile fever virus.
Compared to fish, poultry and mammalian viruses that
are of high importance in our society for either commercial or humanitarian reasons, very little is known about
reptilian viruses. Crocodile, turtle and snake farms only
exist on a relatively small scale and reptiles still feature as
rare and exotic pets although individual specimens may
be quite valuable. Specialised veterinary clinics and
research scientists take an interest in reptilian viruses
though and future directions for research and diagnostic
tools are likely to venture further into sero-surveys.
Hopefully these will become commercially available,
thereby facilitating testing of reptiles prior to transfer
between zoological collections to protect valuable specimens from known diseases. As for all other veterinary
fields, the future diagnosis of reptilian viruses lies with
molecular tools for identification, taxonomy, phylogeny
and epidemiology.
