Abstract
Background: Prokaryotic microorganisms are able to survive and proliferate in severe
environmental conditions. The increasing number of complete sequences of prokaryotic genomes
has provided the basis for studying the molecular mechanisms of their adaptation at the genomic
level. We apply here a computer-based approach to compare the genomes and proteomes from P.
furiosus, P. horikoshii, and P. abyssi to identify features of their molecular evolution related to
adaptation strategy to diverse environmental conditions.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of rRNA genes from 26 Pyrococcus strains suggested that the
divergence of P. furiosus, P. horikoshii and P. abyssi might have occurred from ancestral deep-sea
organisms. It was demonstrated that the function of genes that have been subject to positive
Darwinian selection is closely related to abiotic and biotic conditions to which archaea managed to
become adapted. Divergence of the P. furiosus archaea might have been due to loss of some genes
involved in cell motility or signal transduction, and/or to evolution under positive selection of the
genes for translation machinery. In the course of P. horikoshii divergence, positive selection was
found to operate mainly on the transcription machinery; divergence of P. abyssi was related with
positive selection for the genes mainly involved in inorganic ion transport. Analysis of radical amino
acid replacement rate in evolving P. furiosus, P. horikoshii and P. abyssi showed that the fixation rate
was higher for radical substitutions relative to the volume of amino acid side-chain.
Conclusions: The current results give due credit to the important role of hydrostatic pressure as
a cause of variability in the P. furiosus, P. horikoshii and P. abyssi genomes evolving in different habitats.
Nevertheless, adaptation to pressure does not appear to be the sole factor ensuring adaptation to
environment. For example, at the stage of the divergence of P. horikoshii and P. abyssi, an essential
evolutionary role may be assigned to changes in the trophic chain, namely, acquisition of a
consumer status at a high (P. horikoshii) or low level (P. abyssi).

Background
It is remarkable how the prokaryotes manage to survive
and proliferate in the habitats exposed to an enormous

spectrum of conditions despite their simplest organization. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the deep
seas are the sources of novel microbial communities and

of their so far unclear adaptive abilities. Microbial diversity is not only an academic issue, "it is a treasure house of
innovation for the biotechnology industries" [1]. In the
postgenomic era, comparative genomics keeps providing
powerful tools for unraveling the molecular mechanisms
of microbial adaptation. Complete genomic sequences of
the prokaryotes give valuable information about the composition of genes, their function, arrangement order in the
genome, operon structure, about single nucleotide substitutions in the coding and noncoding parts of the gene as
well. High throughputs would allow to uncover the yet
unclear molecular mechanisms of the adaptation of
prokaryotes to challenging and/or novel environments at
the level of genomic organization and protein structure
[2].
Here we present the results of comparisons of the genomic
sequences of the archaea Pyrococcus performed to elucidate the possible mechanisms of archaeal adaptation to
life under different abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Complete genome sequences are now available
for three species of the Pyrococcus genus: P. furiosus [3], P.
horikoshii [4], and P. abyssi [5]. The archaea of the genera
Pyrococcus belong to the Thermococcales order [6,7];
those of the Thermococcales order are hyperthermophiles, strictly anaerobes and obligate heterotrophs
[6,7]. Specific features of the P. furiosus, P. horikoshii, and
P. abyssi habitats, certain differences between their
genomes are summarized in Table 1. The optimal conditions of temperature, salinity, and pH are similar for their
growth. However, their requirements for hydrostatic pressure and habitat depth are different despite the fact that
they can proliferate also under pressures close to atmospheric [8]. P. furiosus can exist under pressures not above
20 MPa, it inhabits shallow hydrothermal vents. P. horikoshii inhabits at the depth of about 1400 m (~14 MPa), but
it can tolerate pressures as high as 40 MPa. P. abyssi exists
at the depth of about 2200 m (~22 MPa) but it can tolerate pressures up to 50 MPa [8]. These organisms differ
markedly by the composition of utilized substrates. In
contrast to P. furiosus and P. abyssi, P. horikoshii cannot
grow on substrates with low content of peptides and
amino acids. A probable reason why is the absence of
appropriate operons, which renders P. horikoshii unable to
synthesize many amino acids (Table 1). Lack of the chemotactic genes is characteristic of P. furiosus [5,9]. From a
survey of the features of the habitats of these archaea
(Table 1), it may be inferred that the main factors by
which they differ are hydrostatic pressure (habitat depth)
and specificity of utilized substrate. These archaea may be
classified according to these factors as follows: P. furiosus,
piezotolerant living in pressures near atmospheric; P.
horikoshii, piezotolerant, living in moderate pressures, on
amino acid-enriched substrates; P. abyssi, piezotolerant,
living predominantly in deep seas. In the course of evolu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/639

tion, the three related species of Pyrococcus became
adapted to life in various abiotic and biotic environments.
With this in mind, a more thorough analysis of the molecular mechanisms at the genomic level providing this
adaptation appears worthwhile [10].
In the current study, we analyze genomic variability in
three Pyrococcus species with regard to changes in their
environmental conditions during evolution. Emphasis is
on factors of genome evolution, such as gene loss, radical
to conservative amino acid replacement rate ratio. Analysis of radical (large changes in the physico-chemical properties) and conservative (small changes) amino acid
fixations yields useful information about modes of protein evolution. An excess of radical over conservative substitutions is a significant indicator of evolution of the
proteins under positive natural selection [11,12]. Here, we
analyzed the evolution of the protein-coding genes in the
archaea of the Pyrococcus genus to detect the gene families evolving under positive selection during adaptation of
the Pyrococcus species to different abiotic and biotic conditions. As a result, we demonstrated that the function of
the genes evolving under positive selection strictly
depends on abiotic and biotic conditions to which P. furiosus, P. abyssi, and P. horikoshii became adapted.
As known, protein structure alters under the changes in
pressure [13]. In fact, pairwise comparison of the shallowwater P. furiosus with the deep-water P. abyssi demonstrated that amino acid substitution is asymmetrical:
arginine, serine, glycine, valine, and aspartic acid were
more frequently, while tyrosine and glutamine were less
frequently used in P. abyssi [14]. The inference was that the
more polar amino acids are more piezophilic than the
heavy ones [14]. In this work, we also analyzed the proteome evolution of the three species of the Pyrococcus
genus in terms of tendencies toward fixation of amino
acids with particular physicochemical properties. We disclosed that the changes in protein structure of Pyrococcus
might have been related with optimization of hydrophobic core volume in the vast majority of proteins, but not
with adaptive evolution of proteins with specific function.
Thus, pressure might not have been the sole agent that
brought about adaptation of the P. furiosus, P. horikoshii,
and P. abyssi genomes. For example, at the stage of the
divergence of P. horikoshii and P. abyssi, change in the
trophic level might have been a no less important evolutionary factor. P. horikoshii might have acquired a consumer status at a high level, whereas P. abyssi at a low one.

given in Figure 1. Organisms whose genomes have been
completely sequenced are underlined. To get an idea of
how these microorganisms are distributed according to
depth, habitat depth is given to the right of each species
name. Most archaea of this genus inhabit at the depth of
1300 - 2600 m. They also include inhabitants of shallow
water (P. furiosus [15] and P. woesi [16]), and the obligate
piezophile Pyrococcus CH1 [8]. Pyrococcus CH1 has been
sampled at the depth of 4700 m; experimental data indicate that they die at pressures below 15 MPa, 50-60 MPa
being optimal for their growth.
The data on phylogeny and habitat conditions allowed us
to assume that the common ancestor of the P. furiosus, P.
horikoshii, and P. abyssi might have inhabited at the sea
depth of ~2000 m under high pressure (~20 MPa). Evolving from the common Pyrococcus ancestor, the branch
with the P. furiosus ancestor separated. These organisms
might have coped with life in shallow water and probably
lost some of the functions providing survival under high
pressure. The ancestor of P. horikoshii and P. abyssi might
have remained tolerant to high pressure. However, P.
horikoshii was less tolerant to high pressure and it became
adapted to existence in an amino acid enriched environment (Table 1). P. abyssi remained in deep sea habitat
where P. horikoshii and P. abyssi common ancestor
occurred.
Gene loss events in the Pyrococcus proteomes
We have analyzed a sample of 164 groups of orthologous
genes P. furiosus, P. horikoshii, and P. abyssi, of which one
of the three species underwent gene loss (Additional data
file 1). To define the functional classes of genes most susceptible to changes and the organisms, which as a rule
lose genes with these functions, we compared the deviation of the number of lost genes with the 1:1:1 uniform
distribution in different functional groups for the three
genomes. The χ2 test was used to determine the significance of the deviation. The results are set out in Table 2.
The data for gene loss in 164 groups of orthologous genes
are in agreement with those reported elsewhere for comparisons of the complete Pyrococcus genomes (compare
with Table 1). Table 2 clearly shows that gene loss according to function and organism are nonuniform. P. furiosus
lost the chemotaxis and cell motility genes in the course
of evolution; according to our classification, these are the
genes referred to the functional group "signal transduction mechanisms" and "cell motility", respectively. Gene
loss was dramatic in P. horikoshii. It concerned the genes
for metabolism, those for energy production and conversion, transport and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. Taken together with the experimental data (Table 1),
this allowed us to assign archaea of the P. horikoshii species
to the group inhabiting enriched microbiological communities of hydrothermal vents, habitats saturated with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/639

amino acids, i.e. with a status of a high level consumer. In
contrast, the number of gene losses during evolution is
minimal in P. abyssi. Thanks to it, P. abyssi is able to exist
in deficient aggressive environments [17] it is, probably, a
consumer of a low level in microbiological communities
of hydrothermal vents.
It has been shown that the archaeal genes of the Pyrococcus genus are prone to horizontal transfer [7,18,19]. Six
regions extremely variable because of multiple gene transfers from related species/strains have been distinguished
in P. furiosus [19]. Horizontal gene transfer may affect statistical estimates of gene loss significance. This prompted
us to perform additional studies to estimate the frequency
of these events in the analyzed 164 gene clusters and to
judge how this may possibly affect the statistical relation
between gene functional class and gene loss event (Additional data file 1). To identify the cluster with the horizontally transferred genes, we used the HGT-DB database
[20,21]. This database contains the genes from the
genomes of various prokaryotes, which they might have
been acquired through horizontal transfer. Of the 164
clusters with ongoing gene loss, 9 (~5%) only according
to the HGT-DB data potentially contained the horizontally transferred Pyrococcus genes. Of these 9, 6 were
members of the group with unknown functions, the other
3 we annotated as performing functions of "nucleotide
transport and metabolism", "posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones", and "cell motility".
Of the three functional groups according to the data in
Table 2, the "cell motility" group only shows statistically
significant deviation from 1:1:1, with all the lost genes in
the group belonging to P. furiosus. The gene with the "cell
motility" function, in which horizontal transfer might
have occurred (GenBank GI 14590358), belongs to the P.
horikoshii species. It is of interest that the horizontally
transferred genes in the "nucleotide transport and metabolism" (GenBank GI 14590010) "posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones" (GenBank GI
14590433) groups belong to P. horikoshii, too. Thus, the
events of horizontal gene transfer for the genomes we analyzed could not have significantly affected the identification of functional classes dramatically undergoing gene
loss.
Positive selection of the Pyrococcus protein-coding genes
Search of genes evolving under Darwinian positive selection was performed for 911 orthologous clusters (Additional data file 2). For each cluster, there were 4
homologous sequences of genes encoding proteins of the
three Pyrococcus species (P. furiosus, P. horikoshii, and P.
abyssi) and one T. onnurineus species as outgroup in each
cluster (see Methods). The phylogenetic tree for these four
microorganisms built from concatenated protein alignments from the 911 clusters is shown in Figure 2. Our fur-

ther analysis proceeded from this tree. We were mostly
interested in the evolutionary events associated with
change in environmental conditions for P. abyssi, P.
horikoshii, and P. furiosus species as they diverged from
common ancestors on the internal nodes of the tree. The
tree branches representing the divergence are designated
as a, b, c, respectively (Figure 2). The internal tree branch
representing evolution from the common ancestor of P.
furiosus and T. onnurineus to the recent common ancestor
of P. abyssi and P. horikoshii is designated as d.

To analyze the evolution mode of the genes, we used the
sequences reconstructed for the inner tree nodes (Figure
2). We detected positive selection modes by calculation of
the radical over conservative replacement ratio for genes
and of the pairwise γ-distances for proteins (see Methods
section).
As a result, we identified a number of genes that underwent positive selection at various stages of the evolution
of the Pyrococcus genus. Of these, the genes in 154 clus-

ters underwent positive selection for the branch a (Figure
2); in 208 clusters for the branch b; in 131 clusters for the
branch c; in 168 clusters for the branch d (Additional data
file 3). Positive selection was not identified on one of the
branches leading to the Pyrococcus species in 422 clusters.
A part of the genes underwent positive selection on one of
the branches might have also underwent positive selection on its other branches. However, we also detected
genes, which underwent selection pressure on a single
branch of the tree. We designated such clusters as
"unique". The relative proportion of the total number of
"unique" clusters was 48.7% (75 clusters) for the branch
a, 49.5% (103 clusters) for the branch b, 51.9% (68 clusters) for the branch c, and 57.1% (96 clusters) for the
branch d (Additional data file 3).
Further analysis was aimed at detection of functional
classes whose genes mainly underwent positive selection
on the indicated branches (Additional data file 3). We
determined significance of associations between the evolution under positive selection and the functional class of
genes using the permutation statistical test (see Methods).
The test was applied to all the genes undergoing pressure
of positive selection and to the genes undergoing it on a
certain branch (the "unique" clusters). The results for each
of the examined branches are presented in Table 3.
On the branch a leading to P. abyssi, there was a significant
excess of genes whose positive selection was identified on
that branch only (the "unique" genes) in the functional
group "inorganic ion transport and metabolism" (Table
3), the great majority of these genes belong to the "multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporter" family (Additional data file
4). It is of relevance that the genes for transmembrane

inorganic ion transport in the abyssal microorganisms
Photobacterium profundum and Shewanella benthica are
mainly under positive selection [22]. Positive selection
was not detected in the group of genes for this branch
within the gene group accomplishing the functions of
"signal transduction mechanisms", as for the functions of
"carbohydrate transport and metabolism", the number of
genes undergoing positive selection pressure proved to be
smaller than expected to occur by random (Table 3). The
branch a leads to P. abyssi, best adapted to life in high pressure environment (Table 1). Therefore, the relationship
between positive selection and function of ion transport
might have been caused by the microorganism response
to high pressure environment. It should be noted that P.
abyssi is closest to the possible common ancestor of the
three Pyrococcus species in terms of habitat depth (see
Table 1 and Figure 1). This could mean that this species
did not experience sharp fluctuations in pressure and that
positive selection might have been caused by alteration in
substrate specificity [7,10]. In contrast to P. horikoshii,
archaea of the P. abyssi species can grow on nutrientdepleted substrate (Table 1). Changes in the system of
inorganic ion transport possibly took place during adaptation to nutrient-depleted environment. The inference
that transport functions are of considerable importance to
P. abyssi is also made from the small number of genes lost
by this functional group (Tables 1 and 2).
Our analysis of the branch b leading to P. horikoshii
showed that the genes for transcription machinery were
mainly subject to positive selection events (Table 3). We
annotated most of these P. horikoshii genes as encoding
"transcriptional regulators" and various "subunits of
DNA-directed RNA polymerase" (Additional data file 4).
Changes in the transcription machinery might have been
associated with the specific features of protein synthesis in
this species. According to the data in Tables 1 and 2, P.
horikoshii is characterized by substantial loss of the genes
for metabolism, in particular loss of those for synthesis of
aromatic amino acids. Probably, P. horikoshii was adapted
to acquire a large number of amino acids from the external environment, and, therefore, lost need for autonomous synthesis of a number of amino acids. This
simplification might have been resulted in changes within
transcription machinery and, therefore, in reduction in
energy costs of the biosynthesis of unnecessary proteins
under certain circumstances [10]. We also identified functional groups in which positive selection pressure proved
to be smaller than randomly expected. It is of interest that
these are the functional groups "inorganic ion transport
and metabolism" and "cell cycle control, cell division,
chromosome partitioning" (Table 3). This fact shows that
the evolution of these groups of genes took place in a neutral mode or under negative selection. Adaptation strategy

ment toward a source of nutrients (Table 1) might explain
such a mode of evolution for the P. horikoshii genes for
"inorganic ion transport and metabolism" and "cell cycle
control, cell division, chromosome partitioning".
The branch c represents the divergence of the P. furiosus
species, an inhabitant of shallow water, from its deep-sea
ancestor. Prevalence of positive selection for the genes for
"translation machinery" function is characteristic of this
branch (Table 3). Various tRNA synthetases, for example
Isoleucyl-, Alanyl-, Valyl-, Phenylalanyl-, Aspartyl/asparaginyl-tRNA synthetases, ribosomal proteins, also factors
of translation initiation constitute the majority of the
translation machinery genes under positive selection
(Additional data file 4). It is of interest that changes in
habitats for this particular branch result from a decrease in
hydrostatic pressure caused mostly by a transition to
novel shallow habitat (Table 1). There are lines of evidence indicating that change in hydrostatic pressure exerts
an influence on ribosomal function both in Escherichia
coli [23] and other prokaryotic organisms [24]. In fact, an
increase in pressure leads to ribosome destabilization and
dissociation [24,25]. This is the main reason why an
increase in pressure is hazardous, even deadly to the cells
[25]. It is also a fact that the ribosomal protein genes are
among those highly expressed under these conditions
[26]. It appears reasonable to assume that accelerated
accumulation of radical substitutions in the genes for
ribosomal functions may be associated with rearrangement of the ribosomal complex to stabilize it under normal pressure arisen after divergence from the deep-sea
ancestors. It should be also noted that changes in the
translation system may be due to specificity of biotic environmental conditions [10,27] to which P. furiosus adapts.
This appears plausible because these organisms lack
chemotactic adaptive mechanisms for nutrient concentrations in the environment, yet have genes for utilization of
alternative sources of carbohydrate and energy for sustaining growth (Table 1). On the branch c, there was also a statistically significant deficiency in the number of positively
selected genes of the functional group "replication,
recombination and repair". This may be evidence of the
operation of negative selection in this gene group, conservation of their functions designed to provide genetic
material exchange of vital importance to the P. furiosus
species [18,19].
The d branch corresponds to two internal nodes (Figure
2). It depicts the evolutionary pathway from the ancestors
common to all the three Pyrococcus species to the one of
the P. abyssi and P. horikoshii species. Analysis of positive
selection events of the genes on this branch revealed that
the positive selection is rather characteristic of the gene
groups of "nucleotide transport and metabolism", "intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport"

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/639

(Table 3). Exemplary are the following ancestral genes for
which positive selection was identified on this branch.
They belong to the functional subgroups "nucleotide
metabolism" (thymidine phosphorylase, adenylate
kinase, cytidylate kinase, adenylate cyclase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase; see Additional data file 4) and
"secretion" (these are either preprotein translocase or
multiple antibiotic transporters; see Additional data file
4). Prevalence of the genes accumulating radical substitutions on this branch under the effect of positive selection
in the system of nucleotide metabolism may indicate that
metabolic DNA process might have been altered in the
ancestor of P. abyssi and P. horikoshii species. This agrees
with the experimental data indicating shorter doubling
time of P. abyssi and P. horikoshii and also their smaller
chromosome size compared with P. furiosus (Table 1).
Overrepresentation of the number of the observed positively selected genes for "nucleotide metabolism" and
those for "intracellular trafficking" appear to be consequences of the adaptation of the P. abyssi and P. horikoshii
ancestor to the nutrition-depleted media. This inference is
supported by the P. abyssi operon organization and
requirements for nutrition (Table 1). Another observation
was that the branch d is characterized by low frequency of
genes subject to positive selection and performing the
functions "inorganic ion transport and metabolism"
(Table 3). It is of interest that a decrease in the frequency
of these genes is characteristic also of the branch b representing divergence of P. horikoshii from the ancestor
shared with P. abyssi. However, the evolutionary scenario
is different for P. abyssi: this group of genes rapidly accumulated radical substitutions, as noted above. All this
may be taken as evidence for negative (the branches d, b)
to positive (the branch a) selection mode replacement at
the stage of evolution from the ancestor shared with the
three Pyrococcus species for this group of genes. This may
result from sharp change in ionic composition for the P.
abyssi environment or in the site these bacteria occupy in
the trophic chain (transition to the low consumer level)
[10].
The gene sets subjected to positive selection are different
on every one of the branches. This is apparent from the
conducted analysis (Table 3). However, these variations
in sets do not fit closely the habitat depth-dependent variations in the three Pyrococcus species with respect to
both the number of genes under selection and their functions. The phylogenetic data (Figure 1) indicate that
changes in depth were greater in P. furiosus, P. horikoshii
inhabits intermediate depths; as for P. abyssi, it is closest
to the common ancestor in terms of habitat depth.
Despite this the P. abyssi genome possesses some genes
susceptible to positive selection. The number of the genes
is comparable with that experiencing positive selection at
the stage of P. furiosus divergence. An interesting fact is

Table 3: Functional groups enrichment with clusters under different evolution modes (Continued)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:639

brought into prominence: the greater number of genes
under positive selection in P. horikoshii than in the other
two species (including the "unique"; Table 3, last line).
This inconsistency becomes explicable under the assumption that, besides pressure, there might have been other
factors altering in the Pyrococcus species and promoting
faster substitution fixation in a number of genes. Changes
in the types of consumed substrates appeared to be of no
less importance than pressure in promoting substitution
fixation (Table 1). The influence of other intervening factors, unknown as yet, cannot be ruled out. Having presumably lost its ability to synthesize a number of
important amino acids, P. horikoshii was compelled to
procure them externally. Interestingly, in P. horikoshii the
number of genes under positive selection is larger in those
groups that are involved in production and transport of
metabolites ("transport and metabolism", Table 3, lines
11-16). A significant prevalence of positive selection for
the "inorganic ion transport and metabolism" function
was observed for P. abyssi. In evolving P. abyssi and P.
horikoshii, substrate preference presumably shifted stepwise both on the branch d (significant prevalence of positive selection for the "nucleotide transport and
metabolism") and after divergence (on the branches a and
b, as Figure 2 shows). P. furiosus presumably retained the
substrate preferences of the ancestor the three Pyrococcus
species shared. To summarize, the three Pyrococcus species might have diverged under the impact of two consequential factors: changes in the habitat depth and
substrate specificity. P. abyssi persisted in occupied depths,
although forced to partly alter certain substrate specificities. In P. furiosus, substrate specificity of the common
ancestor remained unaltered, habitat depths changed. In
P. horikoshii, depth of habitat and specificity of consumed
substrate both underwent changes. This may be a plausible reason why gene number under positive selection is
larger in P. horikoshii compared to the other two Pyrococcus species.
Statistical analysis of the association between the negatively and neutrally evolving genes and their function
demonstrated that positive selection is less targeted at
functional groups, such as "cell wall/membrane/envelope
biogenesis" (Table 3). It should be emphasized that comparison of microorganisms of the Shewanella benthica
yielded the reverse: many of the genes for "membrane
function and structure" were found to be subject to positive selection [22]. Indeed, the cell membrane is one of
the structural elements of cells presumably the most
severely affected by high pressure [28]. Nevertheless, Pyrococcus species are thermophilic archaea with membrane
structure different from bacterial. The chemistry of their
lipid membranes is based on poly-isoprene. The isoprene
side chains have methyl groups. The protruding methyl
groups maintain the biologically active state of the mem-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/639

branes even at high pressure [29-31]. Moreover, the ends
of the two poly-isoprene chains can be linked chemically,
forming lipid monolayer. Such a membrane structure
characteristic of archaea is already optimal for cell existence in extremely high temperatures and pressures. As a
result, its response to change in hydrostatic pressures may
not demand essential molecular rearrangements and this
precluded accelerated accumulation of radical substitutions in the evolving species of the Pyrococcus genus.
We also investigated how events of horizontal gene transfer may affect the estimates for the association between
genes function and positive selection mode of their evolution. To this end, we calculated the frequencies of horizontal gene transfer on the branches a, b, and c (Figure 2)
for clusters of homologous genes for which positive selection was identified. The number of clusters with possible
horizontal gene transfer was determined as: 16 (10.4%)
clusters for the branch a; 14 (6.7%) clusters for the branch
b; 12 (9.2%) clusters for the branch c; and 20 (11.9%)
clusters for the branch d. Of 35 clusters (8.3%) with horizontal gene transfer events, positive selection was not
identified on any branches. The data for horizontal transfer events (see Additional data file 5) show that the
number of clusters with identified horizontal transfer
events is comparatively small (97, ~10%). However, from
the data tabulated in Additional data file 5 it follows that
the gene clusters with the horizontal transfer event are
nonuniformly distributed among the functional groups.
Larger frequency of horizontal gene transfer was identified
for the functional group "replication, recombination and
repair" on the branch a leading to P. abyssi and on the
branch d leading to the ancestor of P. abyssi and P. horikoshii (Additional data file 5). The functions of genes of the
group "replication, recombination and repair" subject to
horizontal transfer are predominantly related to the life
cycle of various bacteriophages (Additional data file 2).
Bacteriophages are important gene-transfer vehicles,
owing to their great abundance and the ability to insert
themselves into chromosomes as prophages without causing cell lysis, thereby altering the gene content of their
hosts [32]. Thus, the detected association between horizontal gene transfer and gene function appears reasonable. We also established statistical significance of the
association between clusters of positively selected genes
on the branch b involved in cell motility (Additional data
file 5). One explanation may be that P. horikoshii demands
enrichment of substrates with amino acids and that the
systems of cell motility may be needed for the organism to
relocate to this enriched environment.
The mechanism of P. furiosus adaptation to environmental conditions appears to be closely related with extensive
transfer of genetic material. This is consistent with the
recent data indicating that shuffling of P. furiosus genetic

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:639

material is caused by mobile genetic elements
[18,19,32,33]. It is of interest that, when clusters characterized by horizontal gene transfer were omitted from the
group "translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis"
on the branch c, the statistical significance of excess of
positively selected genes in this group remained in the
range of p < 0.001.
Detection of changes in the physicochemical properties of
proteins on branches of Pyrococcus phylogeny
Analysis of the radical, dR, over conservative, dC, replacement rate ratio, which relies on amino acid classifications,
gives important information about how the physicochemical properties of amino acids might have changed
during evolution. To classify amino acids, we used a
number of physicochemical characteristics and their pairs
(7 classifications in all, see Methods). As a result, we
obtained statistics for significant excess of radical substitutions over conservative with respect to ways of amino
acids grouping. Figure 3 represents histograms for the
number of homologous gene clusters in which dR was in
significant excess over dC. From this figure, it is apparent
that in most cases this excess is due to grouping of amino
acids according to the side-chain van der Waals volume. A
smaller number of genes with significant excess of dR over
dC were identified when grouping was based on amino
acid properties such as hydropathy and asymmetry during
amino acid substitution, depending on hydrostatic pressure (Figure 3). The positive selection that was mainly
related to change in amino acid side-chain volume may be
due to optimization of the protein structure to maintain
archaeal vital activities under various pressures.

The volume of the side-chain is a property that reflects
structural characteristics of amino acids. Of the factors we
considered here, making Pyrococcus species different
from each other (Table 1), change in pressure may affect
strongest protein structure. As known, increase in pressure
can lead to destabilization of protein globule by water
penetration into the inner hydrophobic core of protein
through pores [28]. Substitutions causing volumetric
changes may be targeted at tighter packing of the inner
hydrophobic core, making it less susceptible to access of
water molecules. The question is: What type of radical
substitutions is needed for packing of the hydrophobic
core of a protein to be tight? It would seem that the radical
amino acid substitutions may have a destabilizing effect
on the core protein structure (for example, replacement of
amino acid with small side-chain by amino acid by a large
one). However, small displacements of the elements of
the protein secondary structure do make the hydrophobic
core sufficiently flexible and provide efficient compensations for side-chain size variations [34-37]. As a consequence, even radical amino acid replacements (according
to the side-chain volume classification) because of com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/639

pensation do not produce "cavities" in the core, while the
core becomes more tightly packed.
We have also followed trends for changes of the physicochemical properties on the branches of the phylogenetic
tree on the basis of estimated occurrence frequencies of
amino acids in Pyrococcus proteins and reconstructed
sequences in the internal tree nodes. For this purpose, we
used sample I (see Methods) composed of 855 protein
clusters in which protein ancestral sequences were accurately reconstructed (Additional data file 6).
Figure 4 shows the relative change in the occurrence frequency of amino acids grouped according to their hydropathy, isoelectric point, and side-chain van der Waals
volume. It is remarkable that during evolution of the proteins of the three Pyrococcus species there prevailed loss of
amino acids belonging to the class of small van der Waals
side-chain volume (E, Q, I, L, M, H, K; Figure 4A). The
most prominent changes in the class of amino acids with
small side-chain were characteristic of the branch a leading to P. abyssi. For the amino acids classes with tiny,
medium and large side-chain volume, in contrast, the proportion of clusters in which their frequencies increase is
greater (Figure 4A). This is in good agreement with the
above results: radical replacements classified by amino
acid side-chain volume contribute most to positive gene
selection. They may provide efficient packing of amino
acid side-chains in protein structure.
The very small change in the occurrence frequency of
amino acids with tiny, small, medium, and large sidechain volume on the branch d leading from the ancestor
of three Pyrococcus species to the ancestor of P. abyssi and
P. horikoshii stirs interest (Figure 4A). This is possible evidence that the ancestor of P. abyssi and P. horikoshii might
have evolved in unaltered environmental conditions.
The results shown in Figures 4B and 4C demonstrate that
on the branch c leading to the archaea P. furiosus, a
decrease in the occurrence frequencies of amino acids of
the hydrophilic group (R, K, N, D, Q, E, H; Figure 4B) and
an increase in those neutral (A, N, C, Q, G, I, L, M, F, P, S,
T, W, Y, V; Figure 4C) are characteristic of the majority
proteins. Such replacements might have played a role in
the increase in protein hydrophobic core stability in P.
furiosus [38-42] evolving on the branch c, because change
in hydrostatic pressure is the most consequential factor
affecting protein stability on this branch (Table 1).
According to the data in Figure 4C, the frequencies of
amino acid class with medium value of the isoelectric
point continuously increase on all the Pyrococcus
branches, with the increase rate being proportional to the
width of the spectrum of hydrostatic pressures at which P.

Figures 4 and 5 highlight an interesting feature. The greatest v values on these graphs are characteristic of the branch
c. As noted, greatest change in the parameter of the Pyrococcus species environment such as hydrostatic pressure is
on this branch (Table 1). The v values on the c branch for
some of the classifications proved to be 5 times greater
than on the branches a, b, and d. This parameter is characterized by variability in proteins at the level of single
amino acid replacements. Major causes were the structural
features of proteins from the families we examined
(because the relative size of the functional protein sites is
small and the proportion of replacements affecting protein functional regions proves to be small). Therefore, the
data for the branch c may be evidence that in the course of
evolution in response to change in hydrostatic pressure,
proteins accumulated amino acid substitutions maintaining stability of the protein globule. In contrast, the relative
rates in changes of frequencies in different amino acid
classes on the branch leading to the P. abyssi and P. horikoshii ancestor is minimal, as clearly seen in Figure 5A, B and
5D. This, in turn, may be due to the slight change in biotic
and abiotic conditions in the evolving ancestor of P. abyssi
and P. horikoshii. This fits well in the above proposed
model for changes in the habitats of the three species of
the Pyrococcus genus based on the phylogenetic rRNA
gene sequence data (Figure 1).

Conclusions
abyssi, P. horikoshii and P. furiosus inhabit (Table 1). This
harmonious trend for amino acid substitutions is explicable by an evolutionary pattern common to all branches.
This is another argument in favor of the gradual adaptation of the species of the Pyrococcus genus to conditions
of variable and relaxed hydrostatic pressures (Table 1).
Figure 5 shows the trends for changes in the occurrence
frequencies of amino acids grouped by pairs of physicochemical properties. It is of interest that widest variability
among all properties and all tree branches is characteristic
of amino acids grouped according to hydrophilicity and
the hydrostatic pressure asymmetry index, PAI (Figure 5C,
D). The PAI value for amino acids have been estimated
from comparisons of amino acid sequences from P. furiosus and P. abyssi; they reflect trends for amino acid substitution in shallow (P. furiosus) and deep-water (P. abyssi)
organisms [14,43]. Amino acids with the high PAI value
occur more frequently among deep-sea species. Figure 5C
shows that the widest variations in these characteristics
reside on the branch c, which corresponds to P. furiosus
divergence along the changes in the trends for the two
classes of amino acids, one lost (Q, C, T, N, H, A, P, M, I,
F, L, V), the other acquired (K, E, D, R, S, G) during adaptation to high pressure environment.

Here we report the results of a study of the genomes and
proteomes of the marine archaea of the Pyrococcus genus
performed to identify features of their adaptation to the
environment at the genomic level. Phylogenetic analysis
based on 16S rDNAs suggested that the common ancestor
of P. abyssi, P. horikoshii and P. furiosus might have inhabited at the sea depth of ~2000 m under high pressure (~20
MPa). After divergence from the common ancestor, P. furiosus became adapted to the conditions of shallow water,
whereas P. horikoshii and P. abyssi ancestor presumably
remained in deep seas. P. horikoshii and P. abyssi diverged
later. P. horikoshii evolved features enabling it to adapt to
life at medium and small depths. In contrast, P. abyssi presumably retained its ability to survive in the deep-sea habitats.
Analysis of gene loss and Darwinian positive selection on
the tree branches representing the divergence of the Pyrococcus species from their common ancestor allowed us to
reveal the functional group of genes more susceptible to
gene loss and positive selection. The important role of
hydrostatic pressure to which archaea adapted during
divergence of P. furiosus from the common ancestor of P.
abyssi, P. horikoshii and P. furiosus species is left certain.
However, explanation of our results could not be reduced
to change in hydrostatic pressure during habitat transitions as the sole causative evolutionary factor. With refer-

ence to the divergence of the ancestor of P. horikoshii and
P. abyssi from the common ancestor, and also the divergence of P. horikoshii and P. abyssi from each other, a no
less important evolutionary factor may be their transition
to new roles in bacterial community. For example, P.
horikoshii acquired the ability to live on amino acid
enriched substrates and occupied a higher level consumer
role; P. abyssi could survive on amino acid depleted substrates and presumably occupied a lower level consumer
role.
The increasing number of sequenced prokaryotic
genomes has promoted studies of the molecular mechanisms of microorganism adaptation to the environment at
the genomic level. Approaches relying on gene search
undergoing positive selection [7,11,22] appear promising. However, great difficulties may arise in distinguishing
the relatively small number of factors of environmental
variability that contribute to adaptation [10]. These difficulties are due to the extreme genomic plasticity of
prokaryotes to fluctuations in their environment [7,10].
While indisputable for the P. furiosus species we examined, hydrostatic pressure alone did not contribute to
their adaptation. Breakthroughs in understanding of
adaptation of marine archaea will hopefully come with
further sequencing and comparative analysis of the
genomes of closely related microorganisms whose habitats differ by a single or just a few environmental factors.

the GenBank database (release 171.0) [44]. We used as
outgroups genes and proteins of the archaea Thermococcus
onnurineus, a hyperthermophile that inhabits deep-sea
water [47]. The T. onnurineus genome is closely related to
the genomes of the Pyrococcus genus, it is of 1,847,607 bp

and contains 1,976 CDSs of which about 1,100 are shared
with the P. furiosus and P. abyssi species [47].
Identification of orthologous clusters, multiple protein and DNA
alignment
We grouped the proteins according to their sequence similarity in the clusters using the BLASTCLUST program
from the BLAST 2.2.19 package [48] with threshold similarity greater than 50%. We obtained 911 orthologous
clusters containing only one homologous gene from each
of the four species (Additional data file 2). It should be
cautioned that the proposed approach does not make possible the detection of the complete set of orthologous
genes in the genomes under study. Some orthologous
relationships may be elusive, for instance, the similarity
between fast evolving orthologous sequences may fall
below the 50% threshold. Orthology in the strict sense
can be defined by using a special algorithm, one of the
kind Tatusov et al. [49] developed. The present analysis
was to meet two less strict conditions: (1) the structure of
homologous proteins should be highly similar (this was
ensured by a 50% sequence similarity threshold); (2) at
this similarity level, the protein in the related organism
should not contain duplicated homologs. In fact, duplications can affect gene function and result in accelerated
substitution rate in one of the homologs [50]. Our aim
here was to detect genes under positive selection as a
result of organismal adaptation to novel environment,
not of acquirement of novel function.

Proteome phylogeny reconstruction
Striving to more accurately define phylogenetic relationships in the P. furiosus, P. horikoshii, P. abyssi and T. onnurineus species group, we used the concatenated multiple
alignment from the 911 orthologous clusters. We inferred
the phylogenetic tree using the MRBAYES 3.1.2 program
under a mixed model of amino acid substitutions (aamo
delpr = mixed) [52], rates were varied across protein
sites according to the gamma model that also takes into
account the proportion of invariable sites (rates =
invgamma). The CpREV empirical model of amino acid
substitution for proteins [53] was the most appropriate

Multiple alignments of protein sequences from the
orthologous clusters were obtained using the MAFFT
6.704b program [51]. Codon sequence alignments were
based on the protein sequence alignments.
Additionally, we chose 164 orthologous clusters containing only one homologous gene from each of the three species (from T. onnurineus species or any one of the P.
furiosus, P. horikoshii, and P. abyssi species), and used them
in further analysis of the functional gene groups most
severely affected by gene losses in the evolving Pyrococcus
species (Additional data file 1).

for description of the evolution of the examined protein
sequences (posterior probability of the CpREV model =
1.0).
Functional annotation of protein clusters
Function of every orthologous cluster of proteins was
determined manually using the arCOG [54], KEGG
Orthology (release 50.0) [55], InterPro (release 21.0) [56]
θ PFam (release 23.0) [57] databases. The orthologous
clusters were grouped according to function on the basis
of functional classification in the arCOG [54] database.
Detection of positive selection on tree branches
The idea was to detect the genes subject to Darwinian positive selection as Pyrococcus species adapted to altered
environmental conditions. We kept in mind that different
amino acids in proteins bear different structural and functional loads [58,59]. To exclude putative neutrally evolving protein sites, before starting the detection of positive
selection, we discarded columns of codons containing
gaps and columns coding for the different three amino
acids from the three species of the Pyrococcus genus.

In search of the genes and proteins subject to positive
selection in the evolving Pyrococcus species, corresponding to the different branches of their phylogenetic tree,
ancestral sequences were reconstructed in the inner nodes
of the tree. We were aware that the best accuracy in reconstruction of ancestral protein sequences is achieved at the
identity level of not less than 70% [60]. Accordingly, 911
four-species orthologous clusters were assigned to: sample
I, 855 clusters in which three sequences belonging to the
Pyrococcus species showed >75% identity for the first and
second codon positions; or sample II, 56 clusters in which
the sequences of Pyrococcus species showed ≤ 75% identity for these codon positions. Then, sample I clusters were
analyzed on the basis of codon alignments and sample II
on that of protein alignments. The ANC-GENE [60] program was applied to reconstruct ancestral sequences of
proteins and genes. This software first infers the ancestral
amino acid sequences using the distance-based Bayesian
method under the given empirical model of amino acid
substitution (CpREV model) and then the ancestral codon
sequences under the restriction of the inferred ancestral
amino acids. It was previously shown that the distance
based Bayesian method of the ancestral amino acid
sequences inference is just as accurate in ancestor reconstruction as the method of maximum likelihood, differing
favorably from it in fastness and more modest resource
requirements [60].
Within sample I clusters, the mean fraction of alignment
columns coding for three different amino acids of the
three Pyrococcus species was very small, 3.56%. After discarding of such alignment columns, the ancestral genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/639

and proteins were reconstructed. The significance of
reconstruction of sample I ancestral sequences was high,
the mean posterior reconstruction probability of the
amino acid sequence of the Pyrococcus species ancestor
(the most distant ancestor) was 0.978 ± 0.034 (mean ± 2
standard deviations). After reconstruction of the ancestral
gene sequences, the mean occurrence frequencies of single
nucleotide substitutions within a codon were 19.63% for
the branch a, 35.11% for the branch b, 39.49% for the
branch c, 10.88% for the branch d (Additional data file 8).
The mean occurrence frequencies of double and triple
nucleotide substitutions within a codon were 5-7 times
smaller. The estimates were 3.53% for the branch a,
4.61% for the branch b, 6.78% for the branch c, 2.13% for
the branch d (Additional data file 8). These features of the
sequences allowed us to perform positive selection detection within sample I clusters by the radical, dR, over conservative, dC, nonsynonymous fixation rate ratio.
The

dR

dC

ratio requires carefully reconstructed ancestral

protein sequences [61,62]. The assumption underlying
this ratio is that conservative amino acid substitutions,
which do not significantly affect the physicochemical
properties of amino acid side-chains, are selectively neutral. In our case, the major advantage of the

dR

d C meas-

ure is its insensitivity to synonymous substitution
saturation [12]. There was synonymous substitution saturation effect for sample I clusters in the vast majority of
pairwise gene comparisons. Moreover, synonymous
changes are not silent in E. coli [63], also in a number of
extremophilic prokaryotes [64]. The disadvantage of the

dR

dC

measure is its sensitivity mainly to unacceptably

great GC- or AT-codon frequency bias (1:4) [65]. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the bias affecting the

dR

dC

appears to be insignificant, with a maximum bias of about
15% under the wide range of natural mutation parameters, and for positive selection to be inferred in practice
one would require values of

dR

d C > 1.3 [65]. It is of

importance that our analysis did not identify unacceptably great bias of GC- or AT-codon frequencies (Additional
data files 6 and 8). The

dR

dC

ratio for the two sequences

was estimated by the HON-NEW program [62]; the transition-transversion rate ratio needed for HON-NEW was
estimated by the YN00 program from the PAML package
[66]. Substitution conservation was determined by comPage 16 of 21

was

based on 7 classifications of amino acid physicochemical

of dR and dC, respectively; (2) dC = 0 and dR >> 0 were
found for any one of the amino acid classifications.
Within the sample II clusters, the mean fraction of alignment columns coding for the three different amino acids
in the three Pyrococcus species was great, 12.4%. The
accuracy of the reconstruction of the ancestral protein

sequences after omission of such alignment columns was
significantly poorer than in sample I (the mean posterior
reconstruction probability of the amino acid sequence of
the Pyrococcus species ancestor was 0.93 ± 0.04). After
reconstruction of the ancestral gene sequences, the mean
occurrence frequencies of single nucleotide substitutions
within a codon became comparable for sample I on all the
tree branches (Additional data file 8). As for the mean
occurrence frequencies of double and triple nucleotide
substitutions within a codon, it became twofold greater
than for sample I, making up 8.21% for the branch a,
7.38% for the branch b, 13.74% for the branch c, and
5.24% for the branch d (Additional data file 8). For this
reason, it was decided to identify the positive selection in
sample II clusters only on the basis of calculation of the
pairwise protein-protein γ-distances (Γ) between the
ancestral and extant proteins [68]. Positive selection on
the branch was considered as detected, if Γi - Var(Γi) ≥

0.45 under the condition that Γi - Var(Γi) = Γmax Var(Γmax), where Var(Γi) was the variance of Γi distance at
the branch i, Var(Γmax) was the variance of the Γmax distance that corresponded to the longest tree branch of the
set of tree branches R ∈ [a, b, c, d].

Detection of relation between evolution mode and protein
function
To estimate the relation between evolution mode (for
example, positive selection mode) and protein function,
the permutation statistical test was used. Functional class
was determined for each protein cluster, as described
above. Based on analysis of the evolution mode, it was
determined whether genes (proteins) of each cluster
evolve in the positive selection mode (PS = 1) or not (PS
= 0) on a certain tree branch. As a result, the significance
of the occurrence of the positive selection mode for a cluster of a particular functional class was established (PS =
1). For this purpose, in a sample of 911 clusters, the
number of clusters assigned to a particular functional class
(Class) and evolving in the positive selection mode on a
certain tree branch, n(Class + PS), was calculated. Then,
105 samples were generated by random permutation of
the PS values for this cluster set. For each random sample,
the number of nRand (Class + PSRand) clusters, which
belonged to a given functional class and had PSRand = 1,
was estimated. During the test we calculated the number
of random samples M, in which nRand (Class + PSRand)
>n(Class + PS). The M/105 value expressed the probability
p, at which the occurrence of the Class+PS observed in the
initial cluster sample may arise randomly. The relation
between functional class of clusters and evolution in the
positive selection mode on a tree branch was considered
to be significant, if p < 0.05. This test is an analog of
Fisher's exact test [69]. Using these data, we can also estimate the probability p' = 1-M/105 at which the occurrence
of the Class+PS did not occur in the initial cluster sample.
If this value is significantly small (< 0.05), this may indicate that the genes from the corresponding functional
class did not evolve under positive selection and mostly
evolved neutrally or under stabilizing selection.
Detection of amino acid change direction
The detection of evolutionary change in protein properties on each branch of the phylogenetic tree of the P. furiosus, P. horikoshii, and P. abyssi species was determined for
each homologous protein cluster, n, by calculating the fi,n
values expressing the occurrence frequency of a particular
amino acid group, i (for example, i is the occurrence frequency of the amino acid group "G, A, S", Table 4).

These frequencies were determined in the nodes that corresponded to a particular phylogenetic tree branch (a, b, c,
d, Figure 2). From the known occurrence frequency of the
amino acid group i in the ancestral node (the amino acid

f ,n
mined as D ij,n = 1 − ianc . If the frequency for amino acid
f i,n

group i is greater in offspring sequence, the D ij,n value will
be smaller than zero. And vice versa, if the frequency for
the amino acid group i in the course of evolution from
ancestor to offspring decreases, then D ij,n >0. To numerically estimate prevalence of a direction in amino acid
change on the branch j, the following was calculated: the
number of N ij,neg clusters with an increase in the occurrence frequency of the amino acid group i ( D ij,n < 0), the
number of N ij,pos clusters with a decrease in the occurrence frequency of the amino acid group i ( D ij,n > 0), also

N ij,eq , the number of clusters with an unaltered frequency
of group i ( D ij,n = 0). The ν ij =

relation was

taken as the measure of prevalence of a direction of evolutionary reorganization in the amino acid group i on the j
phylogenetic tree branch. If n ij = 0, then on the branch j
the number of proteins in which the occurrence frequency
of the amino acid group i increased was equal to the
number of proteins in which those of the amino acid
group i decreased; if n ij > 0, the occurrence frequency of
the amino acid group i increased, and the reverse, if n ij <
0, a decrease in the occurrence frequency of the amino
acid group i occurred.
Possible horizontal transfer detection
We used the information stored in the Horizontal Gene
Transfer Database, HGT-DB [20,21], for detection of possible horizontal transfer of genes in the species P. furiosus,
P. horikoshii, and P. abyssi. The relation between possible
horizontal gene transfer operating on the phylogenetic
tree branches and gene/protein functional group was analyzed by the permutation statistical test, as described
above.
