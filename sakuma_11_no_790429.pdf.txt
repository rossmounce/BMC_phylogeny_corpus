Abstract
Background: Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus (XMRV) was initially identified in prostate cancer
(PCa) tissue, particularly in the prostatic stromal fibroblasts, of patients homozygous for the RNASEL R462Q
mutation. A subsequent study reported XMRV antigens in malignant prostatic epithelium and association of XMRV
infection with PCa, especially higher-grade tumors, independently of the RNASEL polymorphism. Further studies
showed high prevalence of XMRV or related MLV sequences in chronic fatigue syndrome patients (CFS), while
others found no, or low, prevalence of XMRV in a variety of diseases including PCa or CFS. Thus, the etiological link
between XMRV and human disease remains elusive. To address the association between XMRV infection and PCa,
we have tested prostate tissues and human sera for the presence of viral DNA, viral antigens and anti-XMRV
antibodies.
Results: Real-time PCR analysis of 110 PCa (Gleason scores >4) and 40 benign and normal prostate tissues
identified six positive samples (5 PCa and 1 non-PCa). No statistical link was observed between the presence of
proviral DNA and PCa, PCa grades, and the RNASEL R462Q mutation. The amplified viral sequences were distantly
related to XMRV, but nearly identical to endogenous MLV sequences in mice. The PCR positive samples were also
positive for mouse mitochondrial DNA by nested PCR, suggesting contamination of the samples with mouse DNA.
Immuno-histochemistry (IHC) with an anti-XMRV antibody, but not an anti-MLV antibody that recognizes XMRV,
sporadically identified antigen-positive cells in prostatic epithelium, irrespectively of the status of viral DNA
detection. No serum (159 PCa and 201 age-matched controls) showed strong neutralization of XMRV infection at
1:10 dilution.
Conclusion: The lack of XMRV sequences or strong anti-XMRV neutralizing antibodies indicates no or very low
prevalence of XMRV in our cohorts. We conclude that real-time PCR- and IHC-positive samples were due to
laboratory contamination and non-specific immune reactions, respectively.

Background
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed
noncutaneous malignancy among men in industrialized
countries [1]. Although early detection using tests for
prostate-specific antigen and improved treatment have
emerged as important interventions for decreasing PCa
mortality, there is potential for improved prognosis
through detection of genetic risk factors. Indeed, a positive family history is among the strongest epidemiological risk factors for PCa, and a number of genetic
mutations have been implicated in PCa. For example, an

R462Q polymorphism in the RNase L protein, which
impairs the catalytic activity of an important effector of
the innate antiviral response, has been implicated in up
to 13% of unselected PCa cases [2].
Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus
(XMRV) was first identified in PCa tissues, particularly
those with the homozygous RNASEL R462Q mutation
[3]. Genetic analysis identified XMRV as a xenotropic
gammaretrovirus, closely related to those found in mice
[4,5]. This suggested that XMRV represented a zoonotic
transmission from mice to humans. When compared
with exogenous and endogenous MLV sequences,
XMRV appeared to have a unique, conserved 24 bp
deletion in the gag leader region [3]. However, this

deletion has recently been found in endogenous MLV
proviruses in a variety of mice [6]. Initially, immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and FISH analyses suggested that
only prostatic stromal fibroblasts were infected with
XMRV [3]. Subsequently, Schlaberg, Singh and colleagues reported the expression of XMRV antigens in 23%
of PCa and an association of XMRV infection with
higher grade tumors [7]. Contrary to the initial study,
Singh’s study found viral antigen-positive cells primarily
in malignant prostatic epithelium, independently of the
RNASEL polymorphism [7]. It is notable that this study
found many immuno-histochemistry-positive samples
which did not have detectable XMRV DNA [7]. Another
study found 11 (27.5%) of 40 PCa patients with XMRV
neutralizing antibodies [8]. Importantly, there were correlations between serum positivity and nested PCR
results, FISH, or the R462Q RNASEL mutation [8]. In
sharp contrast, several recent reports found no or very
low prevalence of XMRV (DNA, RNA or antibodies) in
PCa samples [9-12].
If the role of XMRV in PCa is confirmed, detection
and prevention of XMRV infection could provide a
novel intervention strategy for early diagnosis and treatment of PCa. However, the conflicting epidemiological
data have made it unclear whether XMRV plays a role
in PCa and have questioned whether the virus is truly a
human pathogen. In this study we have sought to
address the association between XMRV infection and
PCa, PCa grades and RNASEL R462Q polymorphism by
testing prostate tissues for the presence of XMRV. In
addition, to determine the correlation between PCa and
seroprevalence of XMRV, serum samples from patients
with PCa were compared with age-matched controls for
detectable anti-XMRV antibodies. Our study found no
XMRV sequences and no XMRV-neutralizing antibodies
in 150 prostate tissues (110 PCa and 40 benign/normal)
and serum samples (159 PCa and 201 age-matched controls), respectively, indicating no or very low prevalence
of XMRV in our cohorts. We did detect MLV sequences
in 6 samples, but these samples were also PCR positive
for mouse mitochondrial DNA suggesting DNA contamination as a source of the MLV. We were therefore
unable to confirm the links between XMRV infection
with PCa, PCa grades or RNASEL mutation.

sequences from mice. Using this sensitive real-time PCR
assay, we screened DNA from 150 prostate tissues (110
PCa and 40 benign/normal controls). One out of 40
high grade PCa (Gleason score 8-10), 4 out of 70 intermediate grade PCa (Gleason score 5-7), and 1 out of 40
benign/normal prostate tissues (Gleason score <4) were
repeatedly positive by this assay (Table 1). The viral
DNA copy numbers ranged from 0.5 to 11 copies per
1.0 μg DNA (average of 4 reactions). As one diploid cell
contains approximately 7.1 pg of DNA, we estimate that
PCR-positive clinical samples had 0.5 to 11 copies of
proviral DNA in 1.4 × 105 cells.
To confirm the real-time PCR results, we screened the
same DNA samples by nested PCR for XMRV/MLV gag
sequences. In order to establish consistency and to
minimize the risk of contamination during the procedure, three individuals independently performed the
nested PCR experiments using independently aliquoted
DNA samples. Four out of 6 real-time PCR positive
samples (#15, 51, 52 and 112) were consistently positive
by the nested PCR analysis, while the other two positive
samples from intermediate grade PCa (#53 and 103)
were shown to be nested PCR-positive twice in the first
three attempts. Further analysis confirmed that these
two samples were nested PCR-positive for viral DNA.
The 144 real-time PCR-negative samples were also
found to be negative by nested PCR.
No statistical link between the presence of viral DNA and
prostate cancer or higher tumor grade

We then sought a correlation between viral DNA detection and the presence of PCa. There was no statistical
difference between the frequency of PCR positivity in
PCa and in benign/normal controls (Table 2). We also
examined a link between PCR positivity and tumor
grade as measured by the Gleason score. Using total of
110 DNA samples from PCa, 4 out of 70 intermediate
grade (Gleason score 5-7) and 1 out of 40 high grade
(Gleason score 8-10) were positive by real time PCR
(Table 3). These data were not statistically significant by

Prevalence of XMRV proviral DNA in PCa

We have previously developed a real-time PCR assay
for detection of XMRV gag sequences [13,14]. Tests
using the XMRV infectious molecular clone plasmid,
pcDNA3.1(-)/VP62, could detect a single copy of the
XMRV genome in 1.0 μg of total cellular DNA (approximately 1.4 × 105 cells). The primers and the probe used
in this assay were designed to detect most MLV-related

No correlation between viral DNA detection and RNASEL
R462Q mutation

In order to consider the association between RNASEL
mutation and viral infection, we amplified part of the
RNASEL gene by PCR and determined the status of the
R462Q RNASEL polymorphism. Of 150 prostate tissues,
20 cases were found to be homozygous for RNASEL
R462Q (Table 4). However, these samples were all negative for viral DNA by real-time PCR. Thus there was no
linkage between viral DNA detection and RNASEL
R462Q in our clinical samples (Table 5).
Phylogenetic analyses of MLV-like sequences in prostate
tissue DNA

XMRV has been PCR amplified from prostate cancer
samples in a number of studies [3,8,12] as well as in
blood samples from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) [15]. Furthermore, a recent study reported
a high frequency of MLV that was distinct from XMRV
by PCR in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome [16].
To examine the viral sequences identified in our PCa
samples, we cloned the PCR-amplified DNA bands from
four viral DNA-positive patient samples (#15 [GenBank
no. JF288880, JF288881], #51 [GenBank no. JF288878,
JF288879], #52 [GenBank no. JF288882, JF288883] and
#112 [GenBank no. JF288884]) and determined their
nucleotide sequences. We were able to identify two
independent sequences from each of patients #15, #51
and #52 and a single sequence from patient #112. To
Table 3 Statistical analysis of XMRV prevalence and
tumor grade

compare these sequences to XMRV and to previously
published MLV sequences from mice and patient samples, we reconstructed Bayesian phylogenies (Figure 1).
None of the gag gene sequences amplified from our
clinical samples belonged to the clade formed by previously reported XMRV sequences; instead, they clustered with known polytropic murine leukemia virus
(PMLV), modified polytropic murine leukemia virus
(MPMLV) or xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MLVX) endogenous sequences of mice (Figure 1). Importantly, one of the patients (#52) appeared to be infected
with two independent MLVs, one from the modified
polytropic MLV clade and one from the xenotropic
MLV clade. A similar result was seen when a maximum
likelihood phylogeny was constructed using the software
RAxML [17] (not shown). In each case, BLAST analysis
of the amplified sequences identified at least one endogenous MLV sequence in the mouse genome with very
high (>99%) similarity (Table 6). Two of the five fragments were identical to known endogenous proviruses
and the other three were greater than 99% similar.
These proviruses exist in multiple locations within the
mouse genome.
Because the sequences we amplified were similar to
the MLV sequences detected in CFS patients [16], we
also analyzed the sequences reported in that study. The
sequences amplified from CFS patients also fell into
both polytropic and modified polytropic clades of endogenous MLVs (Figure 1). They were also very similar
(98-100%) to known endogenous MLV proviruses in
mice (Table 7). In fact, the differences between the
amplified sequences and the endogenous sequences are
consistent with known error rates of Taq polymerase or
could also be explained by polymorphisms between
mice [18-20].

NB: Gaps are treated as mismatches.

The similarity between the patient amplified sequences
and known endogenous MLV provirus sequence in mice
suggests that the MLVs may have been amplified from
samples that had been inadvertently contaminated with
mouse DNA. To examine this possibility further in our
samples we tested each positive PCa sample for the presence of mouse mitochondrial DNA by PCR. Strikingly,
all of the clinical samples that were positive for MLV
were also positive for mouse mitochondrial DNA
(Figure 2). When the amplified DNA fragments were
cloned and sequenced, they were 100% identical to Mus
musculus cytochrome b gene sequence. Thus, the MLV
sequences detected by sensitive PCR methods in patient
samples likely originated from contaminating mouse
DNA encoding endogenous MLV proviruses.
Detection of XMRV antigens in PCa tissues

Previous IHC studies found XMRV antigen-positive cells
in prostatic stromal fibroblasts [3] or in malignant prostatic epithelium [7]. Importantly, Schlaberg, Singh and
colleagues also showed frequent detection of viral antigen-positive cells in PCR-negative tissues [7]. In order
to seek viral antigen-positive cells in our clinical samples, we prepared prostate tissue sections and performed
IHC analysis. We used the rabbit anti-XMRV antibody,
which was used in the previous study by Schlaberg et al.
[7]. We also used a goat anti-MLV p30/gp70 antibody,
which can detect XMRV precursor Gag, CA, and Env
proteins in XMRV transfected cells [13,14]. Both

antisera showed clear and reproducible staining of 293T
cells transfected with the infectious XMRV clone VP62
(Figure 3A) or XMRV-producing 22Rv1 cells (data not
shown). No specific staining was seen when uninfected
control 293T cells were stained with these antisera
(Figure 3A). We prepared tissue sections of four PCRpositive tissues (Gleason scores 6 and 8) as well as two
PCR negative tissues (Gleason scores 6 and 8, real-time/
nested PCR-double negative), and analyzed them with
the two antisera. The anti-XMRV antibody sporadically
detected antigen-positive cells, exclusively in prostatic
epithelium, in the sections of tissues (Figure 3B, upper
middle panel with FITC). Similar results were observed
with a different secondary antibody conjugated with
Texas Red (Figure 3C). In contrast, no signal was
detected with the anti-MLV p30/gp70 in any of the tissue sections (Figure 3B). Importantly, the anti-MLV
serum did not stain the cells, which were shown to be
IHC-positive by the anti-XMRV serum, in the serial sections of the same tissue (Figure 3B, upper panels). It was
also notable that the anti-XMRV serum found antigenpositive cells in PCR-negative tissue sections (Figure 3C),
suggesting that this serum also recognizes a non-viral
protein. Similar results were recently reported by Switzer
et al [21]. Considering the data obtained using the antiMLV serum, we conclude that we cannot detect XMRV
in prostate cancer tissues and that the antibody described
by Schlaberg, Singh and colleagues recognizes non-viral
proteins in addition to XMRV.

Absence of XMRV antibodies in patients with PCa and
age-matched controls

Serological testing was performed with a recently developed XMRV neutralizing assay which measures viral
neutralizing activity using a GFP-encoding XMRV and
flow cytometry [14]. Positive seroreactivity was defined
as 100% block of XMRV-GFP transduction with a
10-fold diluted serum sample. We randomly sampled
159 PCa cases out of 933 patients who are consenting,
age 50-70 and have a clinical Gleason Score of 6 or
7 (most common) in the Mayo Clinic Prostate SPORE
Biospecimen files. 201 sera from age-matched patients
without PCa or any known urological disorders were
included as non-PCa controls. As positive controls, we
used anti-XMRV sera from XMRV-infected wild mice,
Mus pahari [14]. Sera from XMRV-infected mice
diluted 10-fold completely blocked XMRV-GFP infection (Figure 4A). In contrast, none of the clinical samples showed strong anti-XMRV activity at 10-fold
dilution (Figure 4B). Two out of 159 PCa (Figure 4C)
and five out of 201 non-PCa (Figure 4D) sera marginally
reduced the XMRV infectivity (over 80% block of
XMRV infectivity at a 10-fold dilution). However, by
Western blot probing cell lysates from XMRV-infected
and uninfected cells, these patients’ sera failed to detect
XMRV Env, Gag or p30 Capsid (data not shown). To
rule out the possibility that these patients’ sera cannot
detect denatured XMRV proteins by Western blotting,
we also performed the indirect immunofluorescent assay
using HeLa cells (control) and XMRV-infected HeLa
cells as antigens. None of the sera could detect XMRV
antigens in HeLa cells at 50- and 200-fold dilutions
(data not shown). We, therefore, conclude that XMRV
antibodies are absent from our patient population.

Discussion
In this study, we have examined the prevalence of
XMRV in patients with or without PCa at Mayo Clinic.
We were unable to find XMRV sequences or antiXMRV antibodies in our patients, most of whom are
from the mid-west area of the USA, indicating that

there is no or very low prevalence of XMRV in this
region. Moreover, we were unable to confirm the correlation between XMRV infection and PCa, higher tumor
grade or RNASEL R462Q mutation.
A high prevalence of XMRV has been reported in
patients with PCa and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
in the USA [3,7,8], but similar studies in Europe have
failed to detect XMRV [10-12]. It has been suggested
that geographical differences might explain this striking
variation in XMRV prevalence [11] but our results, as
well as recent US studies that also find no evidence for
XMRV [9,21], appear to rule this explanation out. In
this regard, it is notable that previous studies to identify
XMRV in patients with PCa or chronic fatigue syndrome have relied on very sensitive PCR detection
methods. Because of the high similarity between
patient associated XMRV/MLV and endogenous MLV
sequences and the striking discordance between studies,
it has been suggested that PCR-positive results might be
attributed to unintentional detection of contaminating
mouse DNA in human specimens [6,22-24]. It is notable
that Lo et al. [16] detected polytropic and modified
polytropic MLV sequences, but not XMRV, in blood
samples from chronic fatigue patients (Figure 1). These
authors were unable to identify the samples as contaminated using mouse mitochondrial PCR. In our study,
real-time PCR and nested PCR identified 6 of 150 samples as positive for MLV. However, the amplified
sequences were closely related to known endogenous
MLV proviruses, rather than XMRV. In fact one patient
sample (#52) contained two independent MLV sequences. This might be interpreted as evidence for evolution of the virus in the patient but closer analysis
reveals that one of the sequences is identical to a known
endogenous modified polytropic sequence whilst the
other is a single nucleotide different from a known
mouse endogenous xenotropic MLV. This, therefore,
suggests either infection of this patient with two independent MLVs or PCR contamination with mouse DNA
as a source. As all of the MLV PCR-positive samples
contained detectable levels of mouse mitochondrial
DNA, we conclude that the amplified sequences originated from mouse DNA that somehow contaminated
the study samples.
In order to confirm that the viral sequences were
amplified from endogenous MLV in mouse genomic
DNA, but not replicating MLV in human tissue, we
attempted to determine viral integration sites. We first
used the protocol described by Kim et al. [25] but failed
to amplify DNA sequences containing the partial XMRV
LTR. We then designed universal primers to recognize
LTRs from XMRV and endogenous and exogenous
MLVs [26], as well as a series of primers specific for the
viral sequences identified in our clinical samples.

Figure 4 Neutralization activity of patient sera. (A) XMRV
infected 293T cells (XMRV+ control) and XMRV-infected and treated
with anti-XMRV sera at a dilution of 1:10 [14] are shown. (B) Data
from non-XMRV infected 293T cells is shown as a control. Patients
samples which did not show positive neutralization reaction
(Patients with non-prostate cancer (NonPCa)-1, Patients with
prostate cancer (PCa)-1) are shown. (C) Two samples that showed
positive reaction from patients with prostate cancer (PCa-2 and -3)
are shown. (D) Six samples that showed positive neutralization
reaction from patients with non-prostate cancer (NonPCa-2 to -6)
are shown. 1:10 dilution of sera were applied for all the
experiments. Percent GFP positive and percent neutralization are
indicated within the gated areas and below the flow data,
respectively. The percent neutralization was calculated as the
reciprocal of infectivity, with a maximum infectivity being
determined by incubation of the virus with an uninfected mouse
serum. n.a., not applicable.

Unfortunately, we were not successful, likely due to low
viral copy numbers in the clinical samples. Very
recently, Robinson et al. [23] and Oakes et al. [22]
reported similar observations; all XMRV PCR-positive
specimens contained detectable levels of mouse mitochondrial or endogenous retroelements (IAPs). Together
with our data, these findings highlight the difficulty of
avoiding DNA contamination in clinical samples and
the risk of testing contaminated samples as XMRV-positive by sensitive PCR detection assays. As a possible
source of contamination, Sato et al. [24] demonstrated
that a commercially available hot-start PCR enzyme
contained mouse DNA. We used several enzymes and
obtained similar results. Thus, it is unlikely that the
contaminating mouse genome originated from a PCR
kit. Since we could amplify the viral sequences from
multiple aliquoted DNA samples, they appeared to be

contaminated before or during the DNA isolation step,
most likely during tissue sectioning on a microtome.
XMRV antigen-positive cells have been detected in
prostatic stromal fibroblasts [3] or in malignant prostatic
epithelium [7]. Our IHC study using two different antisera showed conflicting results. The goat anti-MLV antibody found no viral antigens in clinical samples, while
the rabbit anti-XMRV antibody used in the study by
Schlaberg, Singh and colleagues [7] detected antigenpositive cells in prostatic epithelium. Strikingly, the goat
anti-MLV serum did not stain the cells, which were
IHC-positive by the anti-XMRV rabbit serum, in serial
sections of the same tissue. The rabbit antiserum also
found antigen-positive cells in PCR-negative sections,
confirming the observations of Schlaberg and colleagues
who reported frequent detection of IHC-positive samples in PCR-negative tissues [7]. Importantly, both the
rabbit and goat antibodies detected XMRV in experimentally infected cells with high sensitivity (Figure 3).
Together, these observations strongly suggest that the
rabbit antiserum is detecting a non-viral antigen sporadically expressed by tumor cells in the tissue section.
We conclude that our PCa samples do not have XMRV
antigen-expressing cells that are detectable by IHC.
We recently reported that Mus pahari mice elicit
potent XMRV-specific humoral immune response upon
XMRV infection [14]. At a serum dilution of 1:640, antisera from infected animals almost completely blocked
XMRV infection [14]. Similarly, an animal study using
XMRV-infected rhesus macaques and sensitive ELISA
detection assays showed that infected animals rapidly
develop antibodies against XMRV proteins, including
gp70 (Env), p15E (transmembrane), and p30 (CA) [27].
These results indicate that XMRV is strongly immunogenic in these animals. In contrast, we were unable to
detect strong XMRV-specific neutralizing antibodies in
our 360 patients, age 50-70, with or without PCa. This
observation further suggests a lack of XMRV in our
cohorts. It is possible, although less likely, that XMRV is
not immunogenic in humans or that XMRV-specific
immune response might have disappeared in these relatively elderly patients.

Conclusion
In our study population of patients with or without PCa
from the USA, we found no evidence of infection with
XMRV using PCR, IHC and serological tests. Our negative results are in accordance with previous studies using
sensitive PCR, ELISA and Western blot assays, which
failed to detect PCR or seropositive samples in a large
number of blood donors, HTLV- and HIV-infected, or
patients with or without CFS [9-12,21,27-31]. Our results
indicate the possible false-positive detection of XMRV/
MLV-related sequences or antigen-positive cells through

Sakuma et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:23

laboratory contamination or non-specific immune reaction respectively, and underscore the need for careful
validation of previous and future studies.

Materials and methods
Prostate tissues and plasma samples from patients

Prostate tissues and plasma samples were obtained from
Mayo Clinic Biospecimen Core with an approval from
the Institutional Review Boards. Frozen sections of prostate cancer tissues (10 μm) were identified as 1 through
150 in duplicates. These samples included 40 normal/
low grade Gleason score, 70 intermediate (Gleason score
5-7), and 40 high grade (Gleason score 8-10) with men
aged between 50-70 years old. For plasma analysis, total
of 360 plasma samples from 50-70 year old male
patients including 159 prostate patients (Gleason score
5-7) and 201 patients with no prostate cancer or urological disorders were used in this study.
TaqMan qPCR

Total cellular DNA was extracted by PureLink Genomic
DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen). All samples were eluted in 50 μl of elution
buffer, and the concentration and quality of the DNA
were determined by a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer.
For the real-time PCR assay, TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix (Roche) was used along with 2 μl of each
sample. Primers were used at a range of 230 nM to
300 nM final concentration. TaqMan probe #51 from
Roche Universal Probe Library was used for XMRV-gag
at 100 nM final concentration. A standard curve was created by using serially diluted XMRV plasmid (pcDNA3.1
(-)/VP62). The assay was analyzed by the ABI 7300 RealTime PCR System using the default thermal cycling
conditions for the two-step RT-PCR method and FAM
reporter [13].
Genotyping

RNASEL genotype was determined by nested PCR amplification using outer primers 5’-CTGGGGTTCTATGAGAAGCAAG-3’ and 5’-TGAGCTTTCAGATCCTC
AAATG-3’, and inner primers 5’-GAGAGAACAGTCACTTGGTGAC-3’ and 5’-CAGCCCACTTGATGCTC
TTATC-3’ with pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). Final PCR
products were purified with QIAquick PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen) before sequence analysis.
Neutralization assay

The neutralization assay was carried out using GFPencoding XMRV as described previously [13,14]. Briefly,
293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(-)/VP62 and
a GFP-encoding retroviral vector using FuGene 6
(Roche). Serum samples were heat inactivated at 56°C
for 30 min. A mixture of plasma samples and 2.5 × 104

Page 9 of 11

infectious units of GFP-carrying XMRV were incubated
at 37°C for 30 min before infecting 293T cells (5 × 104).
Three days post-infection, cells were resuspended, fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACScan). The percentages of GFP-positive
cells were measured using CellQuestPro software [14].
Western blot analysis

For Western blot analysis of XMRV proteins, cell lysates
of prostate cancer (PC-3) cell line (ATCC) and PC-3
infected with XMRV were harvested in 1.0 ml of RIPA
lysis buffer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted with Laemmli
sample buffer containing b-mercaptoethanol. After heatdenaturation at 95°C for 5 min, 10 μl of proteins were
subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 4-15% gradient gel
(Bio-Rad), and transferred to a polyvinylidene diflouride
membrane at 0.7 mA/cm2 for 40 min. Membranes were
blocked in 5% milk/PBS, then stained with patient’s
plasma samples diluted to 1:250, followed by anti-human
IgG (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.).
Immuno-histochemistry

Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue samples
from patients with or without prostate cancer. Sections
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and
treated with 0.3% Triton X100 for 15 min at room temperature. They were then blocked with 5% FBS/PBS for
30 min and immunostained with rabbit-anti XMRV
(kindly provided by Dr. Ila Singh, University of Utah) or
goat-anti p30/gp70 (NCI HD625 CAT No. 04-0109,
LOT No. 81S000262, Quality Biotech, kindly provided
by Dr. Yasuhiro Takeuchi, UCL) at a dilution of 1:500
for 4 h at room temperature. FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Amersham) or DyLight 488-conjugated
anti-goat IgG (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab)
were applied for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were
then counter-stained with 4’-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and analyzed by confocal microscopy
(Zeiss).
Nested PCR and sequence analysis of proviral DNA

Sequence analysis was performed as previously described
[14]. Briefly, DNA was extracted by PureLink Genomic
DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen). Nested-PCR was performed
for XMRV gag (primers for outer gag: 5’-ACGAGTT
CGTATTCCCGGCCGCA-3’ and 5’-CCGCCTCTTCT
TCATTGTTC-3’, primers for inner gag: 5’-GCCCATT
CTGTATCAGTTAA-3’ and 5’-AGAGGGTAAGGGCAGGGTAA-3’) with platinum Taq polymerase (Cat.
no. 10966-034, Invitrogen). The resulting PCR products
from a total of 4 patient samples (#15, #51, #52 and
#112) were cloned into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen).
Sequences from the two patient samples #53 and #103

Sakuma et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:23
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/23

were not analyzed. From patients #15, 51, 52, 112, we
sequenced 2, 2, 4, 1 clones, and got 2, 2, 2, 1 different
sequences, respectively. They were analyzed by DNADynamo (BlueTractorSoftware).
Phylogenetic analyses

Seven unique gag gene sequences (255 to 528 nt), amplified from our clinical samples (GenBank no. JF288878,
JF288879, JF288880, JF288881, JF288882, JF288883,
and JF288884), were manually aligned with previously
described murine leukemia virus gag gene sequences
(n = 79), 22Rv1 cell line derived gag sequences (1605 nt;
n = 15), XMRV gag sequences apparently amplified from
prostate cancer and CFS samples (n = 7) [6], as well as
6 MLV virus gag sequences isolated from chronic fatigue
syndrome samples [16]. Bayesian phylogenies were reconstructed as previously described [6]. The Markov chain
Monte Carlo search was set to 10,000,000 iterations, with
trees sampled every 1000th generation, and with a 20%
burn in. The phylogeny of the aforementioned sequences
was also reconstructed by maximum likelihood (ML)
inference under the general time reversible model of
nucleotide substitution, with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity and proportion of invariable sites, using the
program RAxML (data not shown) [32]. The ML topology was assessed by neighbor joining bootstrapping with
1000 replicates using the program PAUP*.
A semi-nested mouse-specific mtDNA PCR

We used a PCR assay for mouse mitochondrial DNA
reported to be able to detect 2.5 fg of mouse DNA in
the presence of 35 ng human background DNA [16].
Using this assay, we tested whether our samples were
contaminated with mouse DNA. DNA from PCR positive samples were PCR amplified with KOD Hot Start
DNA Polymerase following the manufactures instruction
(Novagen) as described [16]. The resulting PCR fragments were further cloned into the TOPO vector and
the sequences were confirmed to be identical to the
mouse cytochrome b gene by DNA BLAST.
