Abstract
Background: LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins have first been described about 25
years ago as accumulating late in plant seed development. They were later found in vegetative plant
tissues following environmental stress and also in desiccation tolerant bacteria and invertebrates.
Although they are widely assumed to play crucial roles in cellular dehydration tolerance, their
physiological and biochemical functions are largely unknown.
Results: We present a genome-wide analysis of LEA proteins and their encoding genes in
Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified 51 LEA protein encoding genes in the Arabidopsis genome that
could be classified into nine distinct groups. Expression studies were performed on all genes at
different developmental stages, in different plant organs and under different stress and hormone
treatments using quantitative RT-PCR. We found evidence of expression for all 51 genes. There
was only little overlap between genes expressed in vegetative tissues and in seeds and expression
levels were generally higher in seeds. Most genes encoding LEA proteins had abscisic acid response
(ABRE) and/or low temperature response (LTRE) elements in their promoters and many genes
containing the respective promoter elements were induced by abscisic acid, cold or drought. We
also found that 33% of all Arabidopsis LEA protein encoding genes are arranged in tandem repeats
and that 43% are part of homeologous pairs. The majority of LEA proteins were predicted to be
highly hydrophilic and natively unstructured, but some were predicted to be folded.
Conclusion: The analyses indicate a wide range of sequence diversity, intracellular localizations,
and expression patterns. The high fraction of retained duplicate genes and the inferred functional
diversification indicate that they confer an evolutionary advantage for an organism under varying
stressful environmental conditions. This comprehensive analysis will be an important starting point
for future efforts to elucidate the functional role of these enigmatic proteins.

Background
Late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEA proteins)
were first found in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) seeds,
accumulating late in embryogenesis [1]. They were subsequently found in the seeds of many other plants, but also
in vegetative organs, especially under stress conditions

such as cold, drought, or high salinity (see [2,3] for
reviews). According to the appearance of different
sequence motifs/patterns or biased amino acid composition, plant LEA proteins have been separated into different groups [4-7]. However, the grouping of proteins and

the nomenclature of the groups have not been consistent
in the literature (see [8] for a recent review).
LEA proteins are not plant specific. They have also been
found in other organisms, such as the bacteria Deinococcus
radiodurans [9] and Bacillus subtilis [10], the chironomid
Polypedilum vanderplanki [11], the brine shrimp Artemia
[12], different species of nematodes [13-15], rotifers
[16,17] and cyanobacteria [18]. The presence of LEA proteins has been associated with cellular tolerance to dehydration, which may be induced by freezing, saline
conditions, or drying. In extreme cases, organisms can
even survive a complete loss of water (anhydrobiosis; see
[19] for review). Sugars, especially the disaccharides
sucrose and trehalose, are thought to play important roles
in cellular desiccation tolerance [19], but it is clear that
additional substances are necessary for a cell to attain
anhydrobiosis [20,21]. Desiccation-tolerant rotifers can
even survive complete desiccation without accumulating
sugars [22], but they show enhanced expression of genes
encoding LEA proteins during drying [16,17]. Likewise, a
strong induction of LEA gene expression has been found
in the desiccation tolerant resurrection plant Craterostigma
plantagineum during slow drying [23]. These and many
other examples in the literature suggest that LEA proteins
may indeed be important determinants of cellular dehydration tolerance in a variety of organisms from bacteria
to plants and lower animals.
A common feature of LEA proteins is a biased amino acid
composition that leads to high hydrophilicity [24] and
heat stability in solution. This is similar to the recently
developed concept of "hydrophilins" [25] and indeed
many LEA proteins were classified as hydrophilins by
these authors. However, since a distinguishing feature of
hydrophilins is a high glycine content, not all LEA proteins were classified as hydrophilins and instead other
non-LEA proteins were included. The functional significance of membership in either or both of these groups is
unclear. The resolution of this and many other questions
concerning LEA proteins is severely hampered by the fact
that, although these proteins have been known for 25
years, only limited functional information is available.
The overexpression of genes encoding LEA proteins can
improve the stress tolerance of transgenic plants. Expression of the barley gene HVA1 in wheat and rice conferred
increased drought tolerance to plants [26,27] and expression of the wheat genes PMA80 and PMA1959 increased
the dehydration tolerance of transgenic rice [28]. The cold
tolerance of transgenic tobacco was increased by the
expression of a citrus gene encoding a LEA protein
(CuCOR19; [29]). Likewise, the freezing tolerance of Arabidopsis was increased by the ectopic expression of the
wheat gene WCS19 [30], the Arabidopsis gene COR15A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/118

[31], and the co-expression of the genes RAB18 and
COR47, and XERO2 and ERD10 [32]. The freezing tolerance of strawberry leaves was enhanced by expression of
the wheat dehydrin gene WCOR410 [33]. Mutant analysis
showed that the EM6 protein is required for normal seed
development in Arabidopsis [34]. On the other hand, the
expression of two cold-induced LEA proteins from spinach [35] and three desiccation-induced LEA proteins from
C. plantagineum [36] in tobacco did not induce any significant changes in the freezing or drought tolerance of the
respective transgenic plants. This may indicate either that
not all LEA proteins make a significant contribution to
plant stress tolerance, or that they need a particular background to function in, as suggested for transgenic strawberry plants [33].
An alternative approach for in vivo functional studies is the
expression of LEA proteins in yeast or bacteria. Such studies have shown that a wheat LEA protein conferred tolerance against hyperosmotic stress to Saccharomyces
cerevisiae cells [37], while LEA proteins from Chlorella,
tomato and barley protected yeast cells against high salt
concentrations and freezing [38-40]. Likewise, a LEA protein from soybean increased the salt tolerance, but not the
tolerance against hyperosmotic stress, when expressed in
Escherichia coli [41].
Parallel efforts have concentrated on determining biochemical and biophysical activities of these proteins. A
stabilization of lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase during freezing and/or drying has been shown
for LEA proteins from citrus [42,43], Chlorella [44], barley
[45], Arabidopsis, and C. plantagineum [46,47]. Fumarase
and rhodanese could be stabilized during drying by the
addition of a pea seed LEA protein [48], catalase by a citrus LEA protein [42], and citrate synthase by LEA proteins
from wheat, the nematode Aphelenchus avenae [49] and
the rotifer Adineta ricciae [16]. These data indicate that several LEA proteins have the ability to stabilize labile
enzymes under stress conditions. However, since no systematic studies, including negative results, across different
groups of LEA proteins have been reported, it can not be
judged whether this is a general property of LEA proteins
or whether specific structural requirements exist.
Only a few papers have investigated other functional
properties of LEA proteins. The Arabidopsis dehydrin
ERD10 binds more water during drying than non-LEA
control proteins [50,51] and this and other dehydrins
bind calcium, iron and other divalent cations in a phosphorylation-dependent manner [52-54]. Radical scavenging by a citrus LEA protein [29] and the stabilization of
dry sugar glasses by LEA proteins from Typha latifolia [55]
and soybean [56] have also been reported.

The annotation and description in the NCBI database, and the protein family domains according to the Pfam database. The numbers in the first
column are used throughout the paper as a shortcut to unambigously identify the different genes and proteins. GRAVY (grand average of hydropathy)
quantitates the hydrophilicity of the proteins based on amino acid composition. Subcellular localization was predicted from protein sequence analysis
using the targetP algorithm. The expression information is based on the quantitative RT-PCR experiments reported in Figure 4, Table 4 and 5 and
Additional file 3.

These data indicate that LEA proteins have interesting
functional properties related to their presumed role as cellular stabilizers under stress conditions. Unfortunately,
the available data are too fragmented between species,
structural groups, and methodologies to draw any general
conclusions about structure-function relationships and
physiological roles of LEA proteins. Such knowledge is
not only of great basic scientific interest, but would also
help to lead transgenic approaches and the technical use
of LEA proteins as biostabilizers beyond mere trial and
error. To obtain such knowledge, systematic biochemical,
functional and physiological studies are required. Before
such studies can be undertaken, genome-wide approaches
are necessary to describe and classify the entire LEA complement of model organisms. We present such an analysis
of LEA proteins and their respective genes in Arabidopsis
thaliana. We correct previous annotation errors and annotate new genes, resulting in the identification of 51 genes
in Arabidopsis that encode LEA proteins. Gene expression
data, together with in silico analyses of promoter elements,
and of the structure, localization and biochemical properties provide a comprehensive view of this enigmatic group
of proteins.

Results and Discussion
LEA protein encoding genes in the Arabidopsis genome
Existing annotation and BLAST searches of well-characterized LEA genes from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) identified 64 genes in the Arabidopsis genome that encode LEA

proteins. To characterize and classify the genes, Pfam family domains were searched in the protein sequences (Table
1). Previously, LEA proteins have been separated into different groups [4-7], but the classification varies between
different authors. For a better overview and tracking of
proteins, we use the Pfam nomenclature, as this is
uniquely related to sequence motifs. To allow easy reference to LEA proteins described in earlier publications,
Table 2 compares the Pfam nomenclature with the two
most frequently used systems proposed by Dure [5,6] and
Bray [4].
The applied Pfam gathering threshold ensured that reliable results were retrieved from matching Pfam domains to
the queried protein sequences. Thirteen genes were
removed from the set of 64 (Additional file 1) because
they had no significant LEA Pfam domain. It is striking
that three of the removed genes contain a "root cap" Pfam
domain. They were annotated as related to a LEA protein
from Picea glauca, the EMB7 protein, which occurs late in
embryogenesis. This LEA protein carries a root cap family
domain, which, however, is not a signature domain of
LEA proteins. Of the 13 Arabidopsis genes that were erroneously annotated (Additional file 1), 12 show similarities to Picea glauca genes which are expressed late in
embryogenesis and therefore named LEA despite the fact
that they have different structural domains.

We have classified two proteins (COR15A and COR15B)
into LEA_4 that had previously been annotated as LEA
proteins, although they do not contain a characteristic
Pfam domain (Table 1, #23 and #24) above the Pfam
gathering threshold. The two encoding genes form a tandem repeat and while COR15B contains a LEA_4 Pfam
domain with a significant p-value of 0.046, the alignment
for COR15A is not significant. However, we chose to
include both genes in our list and in the following studies
because they are structurally and functionally closely
related and cluster together with other LEA_4 proteins
(Fig. 1). We also included two novel LEA groups in our
studies that do not have Pfam entries yet, the two AtM
genes [57] and three genes homologous to the LEA18
gene from Phaseolus vulgaris [58]. These groups were
included in our studies because of the similarity to known
LEA proteins, namely high hydrophilicity, high expression levels during late embryogenesis and/or under abiotic stress conditions and lack of homology with other
protein families. This led to the final annotation of 51
genes in the Arabidopsis genome that encode LEA proteins and these are listed in Table 1 with a numbering
according to their position in the Arabidopsis genome,
starting at the top of chromosome 1. This simplified numbering is used in the remainder of the paper to identify the
corresponding genes and proteins. In the TIGR5 Arabidopsis thaliana database, nine of these 51 genes were not
annotated as LEA, dehydrin or seed maturation protein,
while seven were annotated as LEA but lacked significant
Pfam domains and had high similarity to non-LEA protein families (Additional file 1).
To see whether such a large number of genes encoding
LEA proteins is specific to Arabidopsis, we also searched
the well-annotated rice genome using the same strategy as
outlined above. In addition, the draft genomic sequences
of grapevine (Vitis vinifera), poplar (Populus trichocarpa)
und Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are also available and we
extended our search to these species as well. We applied
BLAST searches (expect-value cutoff 1e-5) with the LEA
genes from Gossipium hirsutum and Arabidopsis to identify
matching sequences. Since in these cases the BLAST search
only returns positions on the scaffolds without any gene

model information, this data should be considered as preliminary. The analyses revealed the presence of 35 LEA
genes in rice, 36 in grapevine, 33 in poplar and only ten
in Chlamydomonas, where only regions homologous to
LEA_4 genes could be detected (Fig. 2). This may indicate
that all other LEA groups evolved later in higher plants.
This is consistent with the finding that the only LEA genes
that can be detected in lower animals belong to the LEA_4
group [8]. In the rice genome, all genes have been previously annotated as encoding LEA, dehydrin or seed maturation proteins by the TIGR Community and an approach
similar to ours identified 34 LEA genes in the rice genome
[59]. If the number of genes in the different groups is compared between the investigated species (Fig. 2), the main
differences occur in the dehydrin, LEA_4 and LEA_5
groups. The abundance of LEA_4 genes is lowest in rice,
while especially Arabidopsis and grapevine have a large
LEA_4 group. On the other hand, Arabidopsis and rice
have about three times as many dehydrin genes as poplar
and grapevine, but poplar has many more LEA_5 genes
than all other species. There are also minor variations in
the other groups, but except for the AtM there is at least
one member of each group found in the investigated
higher plant genomes. Interestingly, a BLAST search found
the AtM genes to occur only in Brassicaceae species.
Whether these differences between species have any functional significance is currently unknown and awaits functional characterization of the proteins.
Characteristics of the encoded LEA proteins
We performed a ClustalW alignment of all 51 LEA proteins in Arabidopsis and the resulting unrooted dendrogram shows that the identified LEA groups are quite
distinct from each other (Fig. 1). This result is not unexpected since the historical annotation as LEA is due to the
expression pattern and to sequence homology within
groups, but not between groups.

For a better overview of the characteristic features of the
different LEA groups in Arabidopsis, we have compiled
group-specific characteristics in Table 3. In the Arabidopsis genome, LEA_4 group (also known as group 3 or D-7)
is the most dominant containing 18 members. This group
is very heterogeneous and the gene products differ greatly
in size and GRAVY (Grand Average of Hydropathy) index.
They also lack high sequence similarity (data not shown)
and no determinant motif could be found by the PRATT
algorithm. In the majority of the protein sequences, the
classical proposed motif (TAQAAKEKAXE; [6]) could not
be found. Although the LEA proteins in G. hirsutum show
this conserved motif, it seems to be quite variable in
LEA_4 group genes from other species. However, the
LEA_4 group proteins contain the characteristic Pfam
domain which we used as the determinant criterion. We
also found LEA_4 domains in homologues of the D-29

proteins that make up LEA group 5 [4,6]. Because the
LEA_4 domain was present in proteins from both groups,
we combined these groups under their Pfam name (Table
2).
The second biggest group is the dehydrin group (also
called group 2 or D-11) which includes ten genes. This is
similar to the number found in rice (eight (Fig. 2); [59])
and in barley (13; [60]), but much more than in poplar

and grapevine (Fig. 2). The Arabidopsis dehydrins show
high sequence similarity at least in some parts and two
common motifs are available in the Prosite database
[5,61,62]. They have also been subdivided into an acidic
group containing COR47 (#4), ERD10 (#5), ERD14
(#10), #14, #44, and #45, and a basic/neutral group containing #8, XERO2 (#33), XERO1 (#34), and RAB18
(#51) [53]. Figure 3 shows an alignment of all Arabidopsis dehydrin sequences. The characteristic K, Y, S, and Lys-

guishing feature of this group. The S segment, on the other
hand, is present in eight, the Lys-rich segment in five, and
the Y segment only in three of the ten proteins. Interestingly, the Lys-rich segment is only present in those LEA
proteins that were highly expressed exclusively in vegetative tissues. The presence of any of the other segments was
not indicative of one of the three possible expression patterns (seed, non-seed, seed+non-seed; compare Table 1).
Only the functional significance of the S-segment is
known. It is phosphorylated, leading to calcium binding
activity in some, but not all, investigated dehydrins [53].
The role of phosphorylation in those proteins that do not
bind calcium is unclear, as is the physiological significance of the calcium binding activity.

consist only of two to four members. Apart from the original six groups, we included some unusual groups in our
study. The LEA_3 group (D-95 or LEA5; Table 2) is also
characterized by a Pfam entry. Along with this group, the
LEA_2 genes (LEA14 or D-74; Table 2) have been identified in cotton [64]. They encode 'atypical' LEA proteins
because of their more hydrophobic character. The three
PvLEA18 proteins belong to a small family of hydrophilic
proteins that are related to a LEA protein in Phaseolus vulgaris that was reported to be induced upon dehydration

[58]. The two AtM LEA proteins [57] are also hydrophilic
and are expressed late in embryo development.

(#4), ERD10 (or LTI45, #5) COR15A (#24), COR15B
(#23), and XERO2 (#33), several other genes were
induced (#1, #38, #41, #46, #51). Under salinity stress,
the expression differed in some cases from the expression
under cold stress. In addition to the genes #33 (XERO2),
#38 (SAG21), #41 (AtDI21) and #51 (RAB18) that were
upregulated under both conditions, the genes #7, #16 and
#20 (EM6) were salt-induced. COR15A (#24) and
COR15B (#23) were highly upregulated under cold stress
(more than 80-fold), whereas salinity and drought stress
enhanced the expression about 2-fold (COR15A) or even
decreased the expression (COR15B). Cold induction had
been described for these genes before [66]. Drought treatment only enhanced the expression of four genes, #7, #41
(AtDI21), #46 and #51 (RAB18), in our experiments. The
induction of the genes under drought conditions seems to
be high (up to 55-fold), however, the expression levels of
the genes are very low in unstressed leaves and still low in
drought-stressed leaves compared to other stress treatments. Expression of RAB18 (#51) was enhanced more
strongly under drought stress than under cold and high
salinity conditions in accordance with earlier reports [67].
High light treatment had only small effects on LEA gene
expression, with five genes (#7, #23, #24, #41 and #51)
induced over 3-fold. The upregulation of LEA gene expression under high light conditions has been described previously [68,69]. Infection with powdery mildew
enhanced the expression of eight genes, however, mostly
to a smaller extent than abiotic stress, while heat shock
treatment only increased the expression of RAB18 (#51)
more than 3-fold.

Expression analysis of all Arabidopsis genes encoding LEA
proteins
For the 51 LEA genes identified in the Arabidopsis
genome, expression analysis was performed on samples
from different organs and in leaves under various, mainly
abiotic, stress conditions. A detailed compilation of all
LEA gene expression data is provided in Additional file 3.
Figure 4A shows the expression of the genes in various
organs, with the exception of seeds, which are shown in
Figure 4D. In total, 22 of the 51 genes (43%) showed high
expression levels (relative expression >10) in the non-seed
organs in the absence of a stress or hormone treatment.
Due to the high sensitivity of the Real-Time PCR measurements, expression at lower levels was detectable for all
genes at least in some non-seed tissues. Transcript levels
for most of these genes were highest in seedlings. The
expression of LEA genes in green siliques was low compared to the other organ samples, indicating that the onset
of the expression of seed-specific LEA genes had not yet
been reached. It has been shown before that LEA transcripts accumulate immediately before maturation drying
and remain stable in the desiccated seeds [1,65].

Of the 22 genes highly expressed in non-seed tissues, 12
were induced more than 3-fold by different stresses (the
transcripts for #10 and #26 were induced less than 3-fold;
the transcripts for #11, #28, #40, #45 and #47 were undetectable in leaves and the transcripts #12, #17 and #27
were lowly expressed in leaves under control and all stress
conditions; Additional file 3). The expression of LEA
genes was enhanced mainly by cold, drought and salt
treatment (Fig. 4B, Table 4). Under cold conditions,
besides the well-known cold-regulated genes [3]COR47

SAG (senescence-associated gene) 21 (#38) is induced
during natural [70] and ozone-induced senescence [71]
and under drought stress [70]. Here we show its additional induction under cold and salt stress conditions.

This is in agreement with the earlier hypothesis that
SAG21 is not directly involved in senescence, but is rather
a marker for the stresses associated with senescence and
cellular degradation [70]. Among the 14 genes that were
induced more than 3-fold under any stress condition
(Table 4), five belong to the dehydrin group. Also, three
LEA_4 genes, two LEA_3 genes, one LEA_2 gene, one gene
each of the PvLEA18, the LEA_1 and the LEA_5 group
were stress induced, while no members of the SMP and
the AtM groups were induced under any of the tested
stress conditions in leaves.
Treatment of axenic cultures with abscisic acid (ABA)
resulted in high expression of 27 genes, whereas only 12
genes were highly expressed in soil-grown seedlings and
10 genes in the untreated axenic control (Fig. 4C, Table 5).
Treatment with gibberellic acid (GA3) resulted in high
expression of 10 genes, similar to the untreated control
(Additional file 3), indicating that GA3 is not a major regulator of LEA gene expression. Of the 27 genes highly
expressed in the ABA-treated cultures, 21 were induced
more than 3-fold (Table 5). At least one member of each
group, except for SMP and AtM was induced by ABA-treatment. The induction of most genes was high compared to
the very low levels of expression in the untreated plants.
For many of the induced genes, ABA induction has been
previously reported, such as COR47 (#4), ERD10 (#5),
ERD14 (#10), COR15A and COR15B (#24 and #23),
XERO2/LTI30 (#33) and RAB18 (#51) [66,67,72]. We also
found that EM6 (#20), one of the two members of the
LEA_5 group, was expressed in non-seed organs and could
be induced by ABA-treatment, but the homologous gene
EM1 (#35), which was seed-specific, was not induced by
ABA. Comparison of gene expression under stress conditions and ABA treatment showed the expected substantial
overlap (compare Fig. 4A and 4C).
The expression pattern of LEA genes in seeds was drastically different from the pattern in all other tissues (Fig.
4D). Only ten genes were found to be highly expressed in
both seeds and in non-seed tissues under any conditions
(LEA14 (#1), #7, #16, EM6 (#20), #27, #28, XERO2
(#33), SAG21 (#38), AtDI21 (#41), and #45). The overall
level of expression of LEA genes in seeds was much higher
compared to the expression in vegetative tissues. In addition, more LEA genes (33; 65% of all LEA genes) were
highly expressed in seeds than in non-seed organs (22;
43%). We also investigated LEA gene expression in seeds
of five additional Arabidopsis accessions (Landsberg
erecta, C24, Niederzens, Rschew, Columbia-2). The content of LEA transcripts was similar in all accessions (Fig.
4D, Additional file 3), but some striking differences (e.g.
#6, #20) were also detected. It is unclear whether these
differences have any influence on seed desiccation tolerance or longevity. Comparison of the expression of LEA

genes after ABA treatment of vegetative plants and in seeds
showed only a limited overlap (compare Fig. 4C and 4D),
indicating different signal transduction pathways in the
different tissues.
We detected transcripts of every gene in at least one sample (Additional file 3). We compared our expression data
with the AtGenExpress Affymetrix array data [73] and
found a significant correlation (p = 1.456e-44, R =
0.5578) between the data sets. This correlation strongly
confirms the reliability of our measurements, considering
the different growth conditions that were used to generate
the two data sets. In addition, our experiments provide
expression data on three LEA genes (#3, #49, #50) that are
not represented on the Affymetrix ATH1 array.
ABRE and LTRE cis-acting regulatory elements in the
promoters of Arabidopsis genes encoding LEA proteins
Genes encoding LEA proteins are highly expressed during
abiotic stress and in seeds (Fig. 4). The ABRE (ABA responsive element; [74]) plays a key role in ABA signalling during seed development and under abiotic stresses (see
[75,76] for recent reviews), while the second prominent

Page 11 of 22

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:118

cis-element in relation to the expression of stress regulated
genes in general and LEA genes in particular is the DRE/
CRT/LTRE (drought responsive/C-repeat/low temperature
response) element, which binds the CBF/DREB1 transcription factors (see [3,76] for reviews). We queried the
PLACE database [77] for these elements in the -2000 nt
promoter sequences of the genes and compared the occurrence in the LEA gene promoters with the occurrence in all
promoters in the genome using the Fisher exact statistical
test. This analysis showed that the ABRE core motif was
overrepresented in the LEA gene promoters with a p-value
of 2.7E-04 and the LTRE core motif with a p-value of 3.7E05.
Closer analysis showed that 82% of all LEA genes contain
the ABRE core motif in their -2000 nt promotor regions
(compared to 58% of total genes in Arabidopsis), while
69% (compared to 40% of total genes) contain the LTRE
core motif (Additional file 4). The majority of LEA genes
(32 out of 42) containing an ABRE motif were highly
inducible (> 3-fold) by ABA, but only 12 out of the 35
genes that have an LTRE element in their -2000 nt region
were highly inducible by either cold or drought in our
experiments. Conversely, only three genes that were
highly ABA inducible did not contain an ABRE motif,
while only one gene that was highly cold induced contained no LTRE motif. This indicates the importance of
the CBF/DREB1 signal transduction pathway for the cold
and drought regulation of LEA genes in the vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis. However, only three of the cold or
drought induced genes were not induced by ABA, indicating also a possible substantial crosstalk between these signal transduction pathways.
Interestingly, there were only two LEA gene promoters
that contained neither an ABRE nor an LTRE motif
(SAG21 and #39). Of these genes, only SAG21 (#38) was
strongly upregulated by ABA, salt and cold treatment and
by powdery mildew infection (Table 4). SAG21 may
therefore be an interesting candidate as a reporter gene for
the detection of novel stress and ABA-regulated signal
transduction pathways.
Structure and subcellular localization of LEA proteins
The LEA groups show differences in structural features of
their members. The mean values for the molecular mass of
the proteins show that, in general, LEA proteins are relatively small, with most falling in a range from 10 to 30
kDa (Table 3). There are a few very small LEA proteins
(<10 kDa), especially the members of the PvLEA18 group.
In addition, also some larger (~65 kDa) LEA proteins can
be found in the LEA_4 group. The most striking differences can be seen in the GRAVY values (Table 3), with the
LEA_2 group the most hydrophobic and LEA_5 the most
hydrophilic. The larger dehydrin and LEA_4 groups show

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/118

a wide range of GRAVY values but are altogether quite
hydrophilic. Characteristics and sequences of all proteins
are given in Additional file 5.
The secondary structures of 17 plant LEA proteins, one
LEA protein from a nematode and two from a rotifer have
been experimentally determined. Four of these proteins
belong to LEA_5 group [78-81]. They were all shown to be
in random coil conformation in solution. For two of these
proteins, partial structuring in the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE) or during drying has been reported
[79,80].
The dehydrin group is the best investigated group with
eight analyzed proteins. Four of those come from Arabidopsis thaliana (COR47 (#5), LTI29/LTI45 (#6), LTI30/
XERO2 (#35), RAB18 (#53); [82]). The others were from
soybean (Glycine max; [83]), maize (Zea mays; [84]), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata; [85], and a resurrection plant (Craterostigma plantagineum; [86]). All showed random coil
structure in solution.
Secondary structure content of LEA_4 group proteins was
determined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) for the D-7 protein from Typha latifolia [55], the
GmPM16 protein from soybean [56], the LEAM protein
from pea [87], and the Aav-LEA1 protein from the nematode Aphelenchus avenae [88]. FTIR enables measurements
with proteins in solution and in the dry state. Since the
proteins are present in desiccation tolerant tissues (T. latifolia pollen, soybean and pea seeds, and dry, viable nematodes) their response to desiccation is of particular
interest. All three proteins have a random coil structure in
solution, but adopt a largely α-helical structure during
drying. Surprisingly, it was recently shown by circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy that of two highly similar
LEA_4 proteins from a rotifer, one (ArLEA1A) showed
random coil structure in the hydrated state and high αhelix content after drying, while the other (ArLEA1B) was
largely α-helical (84–87%) in both the hydrated and dry
state [16]. We conclude from these data that LEA_4 group
proteins have properties that allow them to adopt an αhelical structure and that this structure may be related to
their cellular function in desiccation tolerance. Interestingly, these structural properties and cellular functions
seem to be conserved between plants and animals.
The only protein from the SMP group to have its secondary structure determined is MtPM25 from M. truncatula
[80]. It showed increased content of α-helices and βsheets during drying. The only LEA protein demonstrated
to have a defined secondary and tertiary structure in solution is the LEA_2 group protein LEA14 (#1) from Arabidopsis [89]. It contains one α-helix and seven antiparallel
β-strands, as shown by x-ray diffraction on the crystallized

protein. Currently, there is no structural information
available for the other groups of LEA proteins.
The structural data indicate that most LEA proteins are
"natively unfolded" or "intrinsically unstructured" in
solution. Such proteins have been recognized in all investigated organisms, both by computational prediction and
by experimental determination of secondary structure
(see [90] for a recent review). In general, a combination of
low hydrophobicity and large net charge are characteristic
features of these proteins [91]. It has been estimated that
as many as 30% of all proteins are either completely or
partially disordered [92].
This indicates that unstructured proteins play important
roles in cells, despite their apparent lack of a defined
three-dimensional structure. Most of these proteins, however, are not completely devoid of structure, but contain
residual, flexible structural elements [93], such as polyproline II (PII) helices [94]. It has been reported that such
structural flexibility enhances the ability of proteins to
bind to interaction partners, such as DNA, RNA, or other
proteins [93,95,96]. Binding is often accompanied by a
folding transition. It has been argued that such a "fly-casting" mechanism [97] has a much higher efficiency in the
search for binding partners than the simple diffusion of a
compact, folded protein. Potential binding partners of
LEA proteins, however, remain to be identified, but could
include other proteins, nucleic acids, or membranes that
might be stabilized under stress conditions through such
interactions.

eral feature of LEA_2 group proteins. Also, the SMP group
proteins are exclusively predicted to be folded, as are the
AtM LEA proteins and a few members of the LEA_4 group.
However, the LEA_4 group and AtM proteins contain
putative targeting sequences which are known to be
hydrophobic. When the targeting sequences were
removed, all proteins shifted to a position indicating a
lack of structure (Fig. 5, inset). This raises the question
whether the folded proteins should really be called LEA
proteins sensu strictu, or whether an unfolded structure in
solution is a defining property of LEA proteins. A final
answer to this question will have to await information
about the functional significance of this property.
Computational prediction of the subcellular distribution
of the LEA proteins using targetP indicates further differences between the LEA groups. Whereas the members of
most groups are localized in the cytosol ("other" in Table
1 indicates that no signal peptide was detected), LEA_4
proteins are predicted to be present in all cellular compartments, the LEA_3 proteins are exclusively targeted to

In general, the available data on the secondary structure of
LEA proteins do not allow conclusions on the structural
characteristics of the different groups, because too few
members have been investigated, and they were not all
investigated under the same set of conditions. Therefore,
more systematic structural and functional characterization will be necessary to define structure-function relationships in LEA proteins.
As a first step towards this goal, we have used a simple
computational prediction of the propensity of Arabidopsis LEA proteins to be natively unfolded. Figure 5 shows a
plot of the mean net charge as a function of mean hydrophobicity of all investigated Arabidopsis proteins. The
line marks the empirical border of natively unstructured
and folded proteins [91]. This plot indicates that most of
the LEA proteins are unstructured, whereas those proteins
we annotated as not being LEAs (Additional file 1)
together with seed storage proteins from Arabidopsis are
mostly predicted to be folded. It is striking that all members of the LEA_2 group are predicted by this analysis to
be folded. This is in agreement with the crystal structure
determined from LEA14 [89], indicating that this is a gen-

chloroplasts and mitochondria and the two AtM proteins
are predicted to enter the secretory pathway. In the SMP
group, one member (#49) is probably targeted to chloroplasts.
Experimental evidence for the subcellular localization of
approximately 15 different LEA proteins has been published so far. Of the Arabidopsis LEA proteins, the cold
induced LEA_4 group protein COR15A (#24) is localized
in the chloroplast stroma [98], as is most likely the highly
homologous COR15B (#23). In addition, the SMP group
protein RAB28 (#31) is localized in the nucleus and it is
likely that AtEPC31 (#32) has the same localization,
because it contains the same targeting sequence [99]. No
other data for Arabidopsis LEA proteins are available. The
general conclusion from both prediction and published
experimental evidence is that LEA proteins can be present
in all subcellular compartments. Whether they have different functions in different compartments and what
these functions are remains to be determined.
Genomic organization of the Arabidopsis genes encoding
LEA proteins
A plot of the LEA genes on the Arabidopsis genome shows
that LEA loci can be found on every chromosome (Fig. 6).
However, the density of these loci is very high on the
lower arm of chromosome 2, which contains 29% of all
LEA genes. The lower arm of chromosome 3 also contains
a region with a number of LEA loci as well as the upper
arm of chromosome 1. Seventeen LEA genes (33%) are
found in tandem repeats resulting from local duplications
of small parts of a chromosome (Table 6). These include
the previously reported cases of COR47 (#4) and ERD10
(#5) [67], COR15B (#23) and COR15A (#24) [66], AtM17
(#21) and AtM10 (#22) [57], RAB28 (#31) and AtEPC31
(#32) [100], and XERO2 (#33) and XERO1 (#34) [101],
in addition to the uncharacterized gene pairs #11 and
#12, #15 and #16, as well as #49 and #50. Gene #7 is part
of a tandem repeat with a gene that has no corresponding
LEA domain.

It is widely accepted that the Arabidopsis genome is the
result of ancient genome duplication events and a following loss of genes from the tetraploid genome that resulted
in the current diploid genome (see [102,103] for recent
reviews). Ten pairs of such homeologous LEA genes could
be identified on different chromosomes using the Arabidopsis Syntenic Pairs/Annotation Viewer [104]. In addition, two pairs were identified that contain one LEA gene
and one gene that was not classified as a LEA gene (Fig. 6,
Table 7). This means that 22 of the 51 LEA genes (43%)
are parts of homeologous pairs. It has been estimated that
approximately 26% of all genes in the Arabidopsis
genome belong to such pairs [105,106], indicating that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/118

the number of duplicated LEA genes retained in the
genome is above average.
After a polyploidy event, redundant duplicated genes will
be lost from the genome due to random mutation and
loss of function. The same can be assumed for genes
duplicated in tandem repeats. It has been suggested that
duplicated genes are mainly saved from removal through
functional diversification, because of positive gene dosage
effects, or because they are indispensible parts of a protein
network, e.g. as subunits in an enzyme or signalling complex [102,106-110]. The latter factor can be largely
excluded for LEA proteins, as no indication of any enzymatic function has ever been reported and they lack any
domains that might link them to enzymatic or signalling
complexes.
In most of the homeologous pairs and tandem repeats evidence for functional diversification could be found from
either gene expression patterns, sequence divergence, or
the predicted subcellular localization (compare Table 1).
For the tandem repeats, COR15B (#23), for instance, was
upregulated under cold and salinity stress, while COR15A
(#24) was also induced by drought, as reported before
[66]. Gene #15 and XERO1 (#34) transcripts were only
detected in seeds, while transcripts from their respective
partner genes #16 and XERO2 (#33) could be detected in
seeds and in vegetative tissues before and after stress
induction. The tandem gene of gene #7 contains no recognizable LEA_4 domain, indicating sequence divergence.
In one case, the protein encoded by one gene in a tandem
pair (#49) was predicted to be targeted to the chloroplasts,
while the other (#50) showed no targeting signal. This
prediction, however, obviously needs to be experimentally tested before any definite conclusions can be drawn.
In the homeologous pairs, the three that contain one LEA
gene and one gene that does not belong to any LEA gene
family (Table 7) are obvious examples of changes in the
protein sequence after duplication. In the dehydrin group,
eight out of ten genes are linked by duplication, either as
tandem repeats or homeologous pairs. These eight genes
fall into three sequence groups, containing COR47/
ERD10/ERD14, XERO1/XERO2/RAB18, and #16/#47 (Fig.
3). A similar grouping has also been obtained from an
unrooted phylogenetic tree ([53]; compare also Fig. 1),
however, without any reference to the underlying gene
duplication events. The three proteins in the first group
show an almost identical segmental structure, with little
indication of functional diversification. The three genes in
the second group and the two in the third show a high
degree of variability in their segmental content (Fig. 3),
indicating possible functional divergence. Unfortunately,
there is no information available about the functional
consequences of these changes in amino acid sequence,

Comparison of predicted subcellular localization (targetP) and expression (gene correlator on Genevestigator website) of tandem repeats of LEA
genes. The coding sequences of the genes were aligned using BLAST 2 SEQUENCES to quantitate the sequence differences between the genes in a
pair (gene 1 and gene 2). To test for diversification in expression patterns, the gene correlator function on the Genevestigator website was used to
compare expression patterns from publicly available expression profiling data.
*this gene pair is not included on the Affymetrix ATH1 array and therefore no correlation value could be calculated.

but the present analysis clearly identifies interesting targets for future study.
A difference in the predicted subcellular localization of
members of homeologous pairs (Table 7) was found in
three cases (#42 and #48; #13 and #43; ERD10 (#5) and
#10). However, none of these have been experimentally
verified. To further test for diversification in expression
patterns on a broader basis [105,107,109,110], we have
used the "gene correlator" function on the Genevestigator
[111] website, which compares expression patterns from
publicly available expression profiling data (Table 6 and
7). This analysis shows that for both tandem repeats and

homeologous pairs the correlation coefficient varies
between r2 = 0.014 and 0.945. Diversification of the
expression pattern is especially striking in the pairs #2 and
# 38 (SAG21), #28 and At5g15960 (KIN1; no LEA), and
#1 (LEA14) and #27, with r2 = 0.014, 0.043, and 0.018,
respectively. Interestingly, while #28 and KIN1 show a
very low level of correlation in expression, the other pair
between a LEA and a non-LEA gene (#9 and At1g22600)
shows a high correlation (r2 = 0.908). Also the tandem
repeat between a LEA and a non-LEA gene (#7 and
At1g52680) shows a high diversification in expression (r2
= 0). This suggests that changes in the coding sequence, as
indicated by the LEA/non-LEA classification, and in the

promoter sequence that determines the expression pattern
may be independent of each other.
In summary, we have identified 12 homeologous pairs
and nine tandem repeats among the 51 LEA genes in Arabidopsis. Ten of the 12 homeologous pairs and six of the
nine tandem repeats showed clear evidence for functional
diversification at the levels of coding sequence, subcellular localization, or expression pattern. For those genes that
did not show diversification in our analysis, a final conclusion has to await the identification of the physiological
and biochemical function of the proteins, as only this
would enable us to judge whether small differences in the
coding sequence may have effects on the functional properties of the proteins. This has recently been demonstrated
for two highly similar LEA proteins from the rotifer Adineta ricciae, where one protein protects enzymes during
drying, while the other shows membrane association in
the dry state [16]. In addition, it remains possible that
duplication of such genes leads to a larger or more rapid
accumulation of functionally redundant proteins and that
this may be a selective advantage for the organism under
some environmental stress conditions.

Conclusion
LEA proteins have been found in phylogenetically distant
organisms and have always been related to abiotic stress
tolerance, especially desiccation tolerance. However, no
unifying concept for their physiological role(s) and
modes of action has been attained so far. This is in part
due to the fact that research has been fragmented between
different species, different groups of LEA proteins and different experimental approaches. In this paper, we have
presented a genome-wide survey of LEA proteins and
genes in Arabidopsis. The experimental and in silico analyses indicate a wide range of sequence diversity, intracellular localizations, and expression patterns. The high
fraction of retained duplicate genes and the inferred functional diversification indicate that they confer an evolutionary advantage for an organism under varying stressful
environmental conditions. The future elucidation of the
physiological roles of these proteins and the relationship
of their structures, and especially their large structural flexibility, with their modes of action should greatly benefit
from the presented comprehensive analysis.

Methods
Plant material and growth conditions
Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Col-0) was grown in soil in
a greenhouse at 16 h day length with light supplementation to reach 200 µE m-2 s-1 and a temperature of 20°C
during the day and 18°C during the night, as described
before [112]. Six-week-old plants were sampled for adult
rosette leaves and roots. Seedling samples were taken 14
days after sowing. Bud, flower and stem samples were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/118

taken from plants with a fully grown inflorescence (nine
weeks after sowing), and green siliques were harvested as
they appeared. Plants for seed production (accessions
Col-0, Col-2, Ler, C24, Nd, Rsch) were grown as described
above. The mature seeds were harvested and stored for
one year (12°C, 30% RH). For stress treatments, five to
six-week-old plants were subjected to mild drought (no
watering under the growth conditions described above,
harvest one day after the first signs of wilting (relative
water content of treated plants approximately 97% of control plants), high light (~400 µE m-2 s-1 for seven days) and
cold (4°C for 14 days at 90 µE m-2 s-1). Leaves infected
with powdery mildew (Erysiphe cichoracearum) were harvested six weeks after sowing [113]. Salt stress was applied
in hydroponic culture on modified Hoagland medium
(1.5 mM CaNO3, 1.26 mM KNO3, 0.75 mM MgSO4, 0.5
mM KH2PO4, 100 µM H3BO3, 100 µM Na2SiO3, 70 µM
Fe-EDTA, 50 µM KCl, 10 µM MnSO4, 2 µM ZnSO4, 1.5 µM
CuSO4, 75 nM Na2MoO4; K. Köhl, unpublished). The
medium was changed every week and after six weeks, 100
mM NaCl was added to the medium. Leaves were harvested after an additional seven days. Control samples
were taken from plants grown under the same conditions,
but without additional NaCl. Heat shock was applied to
detached leaves for 2 h at 37°C as described previously
[114].
Axenic cultures were grown in full-nutrition medium
[115] for 7 d after imbibing sterilized seeds for 3 d at 4°C.
Abscisic acid (ABA) or giberellic acid (GA3) were added to
a final concentration of 10 mM. Cultures were harvested
after 6 h of induction.
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
For the isolation of total RNA, tissue samples from 15
plants or axenic cultures from five different flasks were
pooled and homogenized under liquid nitrogen. Total
RNA was isolated either by the "hot borate" method [116]
or using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Approximately 30
µg total RNA were treated with RNase-free DNase
(Roche). The absence of genomic DNA in the samples was
verified by qPCR using intron-specific primers (Additional file 6), the RNA concentration and quality were
assessed by photometric measurement (Biophotometer,
Eppendorf) and gel electrophoresis (2001 Bioanalyzer,
RNA 6000 Nano Chip Kit, Agilent Technologies). Approximately 3 µg total RNA was utilized to synthesize singlestranded cDNA using reverse transcriptase (SuperscriptIII,
Invitrogen) and oligo-dT18 primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was diluted 20- to 40fold.

QRT-PCR primers were designed using the PrimerExpress
2.0 software (Applied Biosystems), with an amplicon
length range from 61 to 161 bp, yielding primers of 19 to

24 bp with a melting temperature of 58–62°C (see Additional file 6 for all primer sequences). PCR reactions were
performed in optical 384-well plates using the ABI PRISM
7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The SYBR Green fluorescent dye was used to
detect the synthesized dsDNA. A total reaction volume of
10 µl contained 5 µl 2× SYBR Green Master Mix Reagent
(Applied Biosystems), 1 µl of diluted cDNA and 200 nM
of each gene-specific primer. PCR conditions were those
described in detail recently [117] and data were expressed
as the cycle number necessary to reach a threshold fluorescence value (CT). The reported values are the means of two
technical replica from one biological experiment.
Data were normalized to the mean CT of three reference
genes (At4g27960, At5g46630, and At4g34270) that were
found to be stably expressed across various tissues and
conditions [118]. The mean PCR efficiency (E) for every
primer pair was calculated using the linregPCR software
[119]. The average CT values of two technical replica for
each LEA gene and each reference gene was calculated and
set to the power of the respective PCR efficiency (∆CT). If
the difference in the CT values between the two technical
replica was above 1.5, the values were removed from the
dataset. In addition, samples that had multiple peaks in
the dissociation graph were dismissed because this indicates that the PCR reaction was unspecific. Relative gene
expression values (compiled in Additional file 3) were calculated from these data as:
relative gene expression =

In silico analysis of LEA genes
LEA genes in A. thaliana were identified by keyword search
in Genbank, accessed through NCBI [120]. In addition,
tblastn [121] searches were performed on the translated
Arabidopsis genome with the protein sequences of the
well-characterized LEA genes from Gossypium hirsutum.

The Pfam database of protein families and HMMs [122]
was applied to characterize the proteins on the basis of
their sequence homology to the stored Pfam domains
[123]. In the Prosite [124,125] database, two patterns
defining dehydrins are present. For most of the other
groups, we were able to create patterns with the PRATT
[126,127] tool. The PATTINPROT [128,129] tool was
used to verify the stringency of the retrieved patterns by
querying the UniProt [130,131] database. To get more
information about the nature of the gene products, the
GRAVY (grand average of hydropathy), the molecular
weight and the pI were predicted by the PROTPARAM
[132,133] tool. The signal peptide analysis was done by
the TargetP [134,135] algorithm. The gene loci were plotted on the Arabidopsis chromosomes with the Chromosome Map Tool on the TAIR webpage [136]. Duplications

were retrieved by the Arabidopsis Syntenic Pairs/Annotation Viewer [104]. The tandem repeats and homeologous
pairs were aligned with the BLAST 2 SEQUENCES [137]
tool on the NCBI webpage [120]. Multiple sequence
alignments were performed using the ClustalW [138,139]
algorithm and the unrooted dendrogram was drawn
based on ClustaW alignments [140].
ABRE and LTRE cis-acting elements in the -2000 nt promoter region of the LEA genes were found by the plantPAG tool [141] querying the PLACE [77,142] database.
