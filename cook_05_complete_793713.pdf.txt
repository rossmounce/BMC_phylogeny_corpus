Abstract
Background: Animal mitochondrial genomes are physically separate from the much larger nuclear
genomes and have proven useful both for phylogenetic studies and for understanding genome
evolution. Within the phylum Arthropoda the subphylum Crustacea includes over 50,000 named
species with immense variation in body plans and habitats, yet only 23 complete mitochondrial
genomes are available from this subphylum.
Results: I describe here the complete mitochondrial genome of the crustacean Squilla mantis
(Crustacea: Malacostraca: Stomatopoda). This 15994-nucleotide genome, the first described from
a hoplocarid, contains the standard complement of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA
genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a non-coding AT-rich region that is found in most other
metazoans. The gene order is identical to that considered ancestral for hexapods and crustaceans.
The 70% AT base composition is within the range described for other arthropods. A single unusual
feature of the genome is a 230 nucleotide non-coding region between a serine transfer RNA and
the nad1 gene, which has no apparent function.
I also compare gene order, nucleotide composition, and codon usage of the S. mantis genome and
eight other malacostracan crustaceans. A translocation of the histidine transfer RNA gene is shared
by three taxa in the order Decapoda, infraorder Brachyura; Callinectes sapidus, Portunus
trituberculatus and Pseudocarcinus gigas. This translocation may be diagnostic for the Brachyura. For
all nine taxa nucleotide composition is biased towards AT-richness, as expected for arthropods,
and is within the range reported for other arthropods. Codon usage is biased, and much of this bias
is probably due to the skew in nucleotide composition towards AT-richness.
Conclusion: The mitochondrial genome of Squilla mantis contains one unusual feature, a 230 base
pair non-coding region has so far not been described in any other malacostracan. Comparisons
with other Malacostraca show that all nine genomes, like most other mitochondrial genomes, share
a bias toward AT-richness and a related bias in codon usage. The nine malacostracans included in
this analysis are not representative of the diversity of the class Malacostraca, and additional
malacostracan sequences would surely reveal other unusual genomic features that could be useful
in understanding mitochondrial evolution in this taxon.

Mantid shrimps, or stomatopods, are benthic predators
distributed in the shallow waters of tropical and subtropical seas. They are best known for their raptorial appendages – pointed or clubbed – which they use to make
lightning-fast attacks that disable prey animals by spearing or blunt trauma. Large individuals with the club-type
appendages have been known to shatter the sides of
aquaria [9]. Squilla mantis (Linnaeus, 1758) (Crustacea:
Malacostraca: Stomatopoda), with a maximum length of
around 20 cm, is distributed in shallow waters throughout
the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic [10]. S. mantis
is widely consumed by humans throughout its range; UN

At present there are about 650 complete mitochondrial
genomes available in public databases. Of these, about 75
percent are of vertebrates. By contrast only 129 complete
mitochondrial genomes are available from arthropods,
which are the most diverse and speciose phylum of animals. In addition, there is considerable taxonomic bias
among the available arthropod sequences; 86, (67 percent) are hexapods. The subphylum Crustacea includes
over 50,000 named species and is ecologically and morphologically the most diverse of the arthropod groups,
and therefore of all the animals. Crustaceans occupy
marine, terrestrial, and fresh water habitats from the deep
sea to high mountains; range in adult size from less than
one millimeter to more than four meters (leg span); and
exhibit extensive variability in body plans when compared to other arthropod groups [8]. At present there are
23 complete crustacean mitochondrial genomes available. Within the Crustacea members of the class Malacostraca, which include crabs, lobsters, and shrimp, are
perhaps the most well known to non-scientists. Due to
their economic importance this group is often the focus of
scientific enquiry. At present there are nine complete
malacostracan mitochondrial genomes available, including that of the stomatopod shrimp Squilla mantis. In this
paper I describe this genome and compare it to eight other
mitochondrial genomes that are available from other
Malacostraca.

The mitochondria are extranuclear organelles present in
all metazoans. They contain a circular genome, usually
around 16 kilobases in length, with 37 genes (13 proteincoding, two ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA
genes). This gene content is widely conserved, but gene
order and the DNA sequences of the genes themselves are
variable. Because of their small size many more mitochondrial genomes than nuclear genomes have been
sequenced, and comparisons among them may serve as
models for the evolution of the much larger nuclear
genomes [1]. In addition, gene order rearrangements and
mitochondrial gene sequences have been widely used for
phylogenetic inference [2-7].

Food and Agriculture Administration statistics indicate
that total catches in the Mediterranean are currently in
excess of 6500 tonnes per annum so this species is of some
commercial importance [11].

Results and discussion
Mitochondrial genome composition
The mitochondrial genome of Squilla mantis (GenBank
accession number AY639936) is a circular molecule of
15994 nucleotides that contains the same 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNA), and two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNA) found in other metazoans
[12,13]; the majority strand (i.e., the strand encoding the
majority of genes) encodes nine protein-coding genes and
14 tRNAs while the minority strand encodes four proteincoding genes, eight tRNAs and both rRNA genes (Table 1).

The S. mantis genome, like that reported for other
arthropod genomes, is AT-rich and has an overall AT content of 70%. This frequency, as expected, varies for different regions of the genome. First and second codon
positions average 62% and 63% AT, respectively, tRNA
and rRNA genes average 72%, third codon positions average 79%, and putative non-coding regions reach up to
87% AT content (Table 2). There are no significant differ-

ences in AT frequency for genes encoded on the majority
or minority strands. These values are within the range of
60–87% reported for other arthropods and are not unusual [14,15].
Gene structure
The predicted structures of the 22 S. mantis tRNAs are
shown in Figure 1. Twenty one of these genes were identi-

similar to those of other published metazoan tRNA genes.
Two genes, trnS1 and trnQ, have single T-T mismatches in
the acceptor stem, and one gene, trnM, has a single C-A
mismatch in the stem of the TψC loop. The trnS1 gene was
not identified by the tRNAscan software; rather, it was
located by its conserved position in the genome. The variable loop of this gene, with nine nucleotides, is longer
than the average of four or five for mitochondrial tRNA
genes. This feature is characteristic of type 2 transfer RNA

The large and small subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes
(rnl, rns) have an AT content of 67%, within the range
reported for other arthropod ribosomal RNA genes. Alignments of these genes with other arthropod homologues
(not shown) as expected show both conserved and unconserved regions that correspond with the putative stems
and loops within these genes. There are thus no unusual
features to report for the two rRNA genes.

All of the 13 protein-coding genes, except cox1, have putative ATR methionine or ATT isoleucine start codons. The
putative first codon of the cox1 gene is ACG threonine.
The lack of a standard initiation codon in cox1 genes is
common in arthropod mitochondria, so S. mantis is not
unusual [17,18]. Two of the protein-coding genes, cox1
and nad6, lack a full TAA or TAG stop codon. These genes
appear to terminate with a single T from which a stop
codon is created by polyadenylation of the mRNA during
processing. Again, this phenomenon has been observed in
other arthropod mitochondrial genomes and is not unusual [17,19,20].
AT-rich regions
Arthropod mitochondrial genomes typically have a long
region that has an AT content higher than that of mitochondrial coding regions. This AT-rich region, ranging
from 263 to 4601 base pairs in length and usually located
between the rns and trnI genes, is often termed the control
region because it contains a number of regulatory elements including the origin of replication for the heavy
strand of the mitochondrial genome [21,22]. In some
arthropods the AT-rich region is reported to have any or
all of these four different motifs: tandemly repeated
sequences, a long sequence of T's, a subregion of even
higher AT richness, and stem-loop structures [23,24].

In S. mantis there are two AT-rich regions, numbered 1
and 2 on Tables 2 and 3. AT-rich region 2 corresponds to
the conventional arthropod region between rns and trnI; it
is 862 base pairs long, well within the reported range for
other arthropods, with an AT content of 77% compared to
70% for the entire S. mantis mitochondrion. However,
this region has none of the four motif types that have been
reported for arthropods, and I was not able to identify any
putatively functional motifs.
I therefore examined the shorter AT-rich region of 230
nucleotides between the trnS2 and nad1 genes for possible
functional motifs. Most arthropod mitochondrial
genomes have a few short non-coding regions between
some genes, usually from a few bases to 20 bases long, but
longer non-coding regions, such as AT-rich region 1 in S.
mantis, are rare. It therefore seemed possible that this
region might have taken over some of the functions putatively assigned to the longer AT-rich region. However, ATrich region 1, like region 2, contains none of the motifs
listed above. Furthermore, the AT content of this region,
at 87%, is similar to that calculated collectively for other
unassigned nucleotides in the S. mantis genome (Table 2)
and is consistent with the hypothesis that this region has
no function.
Unusual genomic features, such as this non-coding region
or gene order rearrangements, can be useful as characters

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/105

for reconstructing evolutionary relationships [13,25]. A
second AT-rich region is notably absent even in Harpiosquilla harpax, which is also a member of the family Squillidae. A survey of other members of the genus Squilla for
the presence of a similar region would perhaps enhance
our understanding of the history of this unusual genomic
feature.
Comparison with other malacostracan crustaceans
A number of features of mitochondrial genomes can be
used to infer relationships among taxa. These include phylogenetic analysis using DNA and protein sequences, relative rates of sequence evolution, gene order, and the
effective number of codons (Nc). I present a phylogenetic
analysis and a discussion of rates of sequence evolution in
arthropods (including S. mantis) elsewhere [26], and discuss gene order and Nc below.

Rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome are relatively rare events in evolutionary history. Such rare events
can be used to infer relationships among taxa, and mitochondrial gene order rearrangements have proven useful
in understanding some aspects of arthropod evolution
[27-29]. Figure 2 shows the mitochondrial gene order for
the nine Malacostraca for which there are complete
mitochondrial genomes. Five of these genomes share the
gene order considered ancestral for the Pancrustacea
(Crustacea + Hexapoda) [27]. Callinectes sapidus, Portunus
trituberculatus and Pseudocarcinus gigas share a single translocation of trnH compared to the ancestral gene order. The
mitochondrial genome of Cherax destructor is considerably
rearranged and evidences at least seven translocation
events compared to the ancestral pancrustacean arrangement [20]. C. sapidus, P. trituberculatus and P. gigas are all
decapods within the infraorder Brachyura (Table 1). The
trnH translocation shared by these three taxa is therefore
not surprising. It is possible that this character is shared
among all of the Brachyura, and could therefore serve as a
marker for membership in this group and might aid in
rapid identification of unidentified individuals, such as
larvae or processed materials in markets.
The effective number of codons used in a gene, Nc, is a statistic developed by Wright [30] to quantify how far codon
usage in a gene departs from the equal use of all synonymous codons. The value of Nc can range from 20, the theoretical extreme in which only one codon is used for each
amino acid, to 61 when the use of all synonymous codons
is equally likely. This statistic, initially developed to compare codon usage between different genes in the same
genome, can also be used to compare codon usage
between genomes. I calculated Nc for each of the nine
malacostracan mitochondrial genomes using the program
CodonW [31]. Table 4 shows Nc and GC content for
majority strand, minority strand, and all protein genes in

Mitochondrial gene orders for nine malacostracan crustaceans
Mitochondrial gene orders for nine malacostracan crustaceans. The style of the figure is adapted from Figure 1 of Lavrov et al.
[25]. Protein and ribosomal RNA genes (large boxes) are abbreviated as in the text. Transfer RNA genes are abbreviated with
single letter codes (see Figure 1). The striped box represents the AT-rich region. The ancestral pancrustacean gene order is
found for five of the nine taxa, including Squilla mantis. The position of AT-rich region 1 in the S. mantis genome is noted with
an arrow. Genes are transcribed from right to left except when underlined. Shaded boxes indicate genes whose positions differ
from their positions in the ancestral pancrustacean sequence. The number in parentheses next to taxa names represents the
minimum number of rearrangement events that separates that gene arrangement from the ancestral pancrustacean gene order
(see Miller et al. [20] for a fuller discussion of the rearrangements in C. destructor).

the malacostracan mitochondrial genomes. GC rather
than AT content is presented to conform to the convention for these comparisons. The Nc values, which range
from 38 to 53, are all below the value of 61 that indicates
random codon usage, so codon usage in all nine genomes
is non-random. There are no obvious similarities in the
values for related taxa (i.e., the decapods), but extensive

additional sampling among the Malacostraca would be
necessary to confirm this observation.
In Figure 3 Nc and GC values are plotted. The distribution
of the points suggests a linear relationship between Nc and
GC content. A similar association of Nc and GC content
was observed by Negrisolo et al. [32]. Equations represent-

ing a least squares linear regression analysis are shown for
all three data sets in Table 2. Only the regression line for
the all genes data set is shown on Figure 3 to prevent
clutter. These equations are not statistically probative, but
the distribution of points around the line shown in Figure
3 does add to the qualitative impression of a relationship
between Nc and GC content. I also calculated the coefficient of determination (R2) for each data set. The values
for the majority and minority strand columns are near 0.5,
suggesting that around 50% of the variation in one variable is associated with the other. That is, if GC content is
taken as independent then 50% of the codon bias in the
majority and minority strands is due to the influence of
the bias towards low GC values. When both data sets are
combined R2 rises to 0.91, suggesting that codon bias and
GC content are very closely associated. This discordance
between R2 for each strand separately and R2 for all protein-coding genes is puzzling and merits additional study.

However, if one assumes that GC content is driven by
other biochemical factors then it is clear that much, if not
most, of the codon bias observed in these mitochondrial
genomes is a consequence of this nucleotide bias.

Conclusion
This is the first formal description of the mitochondrial
genome of a stomatopod crustacean. This genome maintains the same genes and gene order that are inferred as
ancestral in the Pancrustacea, but does contain one unusual feature: a 230 base pair AT-rich region between the
trnS2 and nad1 genes. This feature has no discernable function, but it may prove useful as a character in understanding the evolutionary history of the genus Squilla. Three
other arthropod mitochondrial genomes have two large
non-coding regions; the ostracod crustacean Vargula
hilgendorfii, a millipede Thyropygus sp., and the tick
Boophilus microplus [15,33,34]. Of these the latter two are

clearly duplications of the orginal control region. Only V.
hilgendorfii has, like S. mantis, two apparently unrelated
non-contiguous AT-rich regions.
A comparison of nine malacostracan genomes, including
that of S. mantis, shows that all nine exhibit the nucleotide
composition bias favoring A and T nucleotides that is
commonly observed for arthropod genomes, and that this
bias is responsible at least in part for the observed codon
usage bias in these genomes. However, there are no
observable patterns of nucleotide composition bias or
codon usage bias that unite particular taxa into common
groups. These nine taxa represent only a small fraction of
the diversity of the Malacostraca, and additional sequencing from across the diversity of this taxon would provide
additional data for understanding the evolution of mitochondrial genomes of the class.

Methods
Samples and DNA extraction
A single freshly caught specimen of S. mantis was purchased from the fish market at Heraklion, Crete, Greece.
Six grams of abdominal muscle were dissected from the
specimen and immediately frozen at -70°C. Approximately one half gram of the frozen tissue was shaved from
the specimen using a sterile razor blade and genomic
DNA extracted using a QIAGEN genomic-tip 20 and the
associated buffer set according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
PCR, sequencing, and annotation
Short fragments (300–1000 nucleotides) of the mitochondrial genome were amplified at low stringency (50–
55 degree annealing temperatures) using primers
designed to work on all arthropods (Table 4). Amplification products were cloned into the T-Easy vector
(Promega) and at least three clones from each PCR product were sequenced with vector-specific primers using ABI
Big-Dye chemistry. Squilla-specific primers were designed

and used to amplify longer fragments of 1000–4000
nucleotides that spanned the gaps between the short fragments. Longer fragments were also ligated into the T-Easy
vector and at least three clones from each ligation were
isolated. Each clone was sequenced using a primer-walking strategy initiated with vector-specific primers.
Sequences were assembled using Sequencher v. 3.1
(GeneCodes Corp.). Protein-coding genes were identified
using BLAST searches [35] and by comparison with other
arthropod mitochondrial genome sequences. Transfer
RNA genes were identified using tRNAscan-SE [36]. Transfer RNA sequences were folded by eye, but made use of the
tRNAscan-SE server output when that was available. The
effective number of codons, Nc was calculated using the
software package CodonW [31].
