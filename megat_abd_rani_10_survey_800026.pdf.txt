Abstract
Background: Dirofilaria spp., Acanthocheilonema spp. and Brugia spp. have all been reported in Indian dogs. In
previous studies, diagnosis was made by morphological identification only. This is the first geographically stratified
cross-sectional study in India to determine the prevalence and geographical distribution of canine filarial species of
veterinary and public health importance, using a combination of conventional and molecular diagnostic
techniques.
Results: A total of 139 from 525 dogs (26.5%; 95% CI 22.7, 30.3) were positive for microfilariae. The most common
species of canine filaria identified in this study was A. reconditum (9.3%) followed by D. repens (6.7%) and D. immitis
(1.5%). Three out of 525 dogs were found to have mixed infections on PCR. The morphological and molecular
evidence on the sequence of the 18S gene and phylogenetic analysis of the ITS-2 region provided strong evidence
that the canine microfilariae discovered in the Himalayan city of Ladakh belong to a novel species of
Acanthocheilonema. Two dogs in Ladakh were also found to have mixed infections of the novel species described
above and a unique microfilaria which morphologically resembled Microfilaria auquieri Foley, 1921.
Conclusions: At least six species of filarial nematode are now known to infect dogs in India, two of which were
reported for the first time in this study. The study also confirms and extends the geographical distribution of
canine heartworm (D. immitis) which overlaps with D. repens, emphasising the importance for veterinary clinicians
and diagnostic laboratories to utilise immunodiagnostic tests that will not cross-react between those two filarial
species. From a public health viewpoint, the distribution and prevalences of these nematodes warrant an
appropriate prophylaxis to be administered to dogs.

Background
Filariasis in dogs is caused by several species of filariids.
Dirofilaria immitis, the most pathogenic canine filarid is
responsible for heartworm disease in dogs. Both D.
repens and Acanthocheilonema spp. develop into adult
worms in the subcutaneous tissue resulting in skin
nodules. Adults of Brugia spp. are usually recovered
from the mandibular, retropharyngeal and axillary lymphatics. Most infections with D. repens, Acanthocheilonema spp. and Brugia spp. are of minimal veterinary
clinical significance, however all canine filariae have the
potential to infect humans and remain important from a
public health perspective [1,2].

Diagnostic methods for filarial infections include isolation of adult worms followed by morphological identification, morphological observation of circulating
microfilariae by stained blood smears, direct wet smears,
modified Knott’s technique and the Wylie’s filtration
technique [2,3]. Histochemical or immuno-histochemical
staining of circulating microfilariae has also been performed [4-6]. Detection of circulating antigen with commercial test kits is currently available and widely used
for D. immitis [7,8]. Molecular diagnostic approaches
are also increasingly utilised for research and surveillance purposes [9,10].
In India, Dirofilaria spp., Acanthocheilonema spp. and
Brugia spp., have all been reported in dogs [6,11-13].
Previous reports on filarial infections in India are summarised in Table 1. Based on these limited number of
studies, it is currently accepted that D. immitis is

geographically restricted to India’s north-east and D.
repens to India’s south, with an overlapping area centrally. There are no reports of D. immitis occurring elsewhere in India, despite anecdotal evidence to suggest its
occurrence in Delhi (Sharma, personal communication,
July 2008, Delhi). This accepted view is questionable as
competent mosquito vectors for D. immitis, belonging
to the genera Culex, Aedes and Anopheles, that also happen to act as vectors for D. repens, are present all over
India [14]. Moreover, a case of human pulmonary dirofilariasis due to D. immitis was reported in Mumbai in
1989 [15], which casts further doubt on its currently
accepted geographical distribution. Recently, 16 out of
75 microfilaraemic dogs were shown to harbour B.
malayi by researchers at the Kerala Agricultural University’s College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences using
morphological and immunodiagnostic criteria [13].
However, since B. ceylonensis is endemic in Sri Lanka
this finding needs to be confirmed using PCR as the
microfilariae cannot be differentiated morphologically
from B. malayi and it is likely the ELISA test crossreacts among Brugia spp. [16].
In previous reported studies, microfilarial identification relied on morphological assessment only. Despite
the availability of published measurements of various
microfilariae, the inadequacy of morphological diagnosis
was demonstrated by Rishniw and colleagues (2006) [9]
when microfilariae initially identified as A. reconditum
were later determined to be D. immitis by molecular
methods. Morphological identification of microfilariae
not only requires experienced personnel but it may be
difficult to detect multiple infections with more than
one species of filarial worms [2].
A geographically stratified cross-sectional study was
undertaken to determine the prevalence and geographical distribution of canine filarial species of veterinary
and public health importance in India using a combination of conventional and molecular diagnostic
techniques.

Methods
Study site

India features a wide range of climatic zones, ranging
from montane (cold, wet alpine regions) and semi-arid
regions to the wet tropics. The ecology of vectors of

medical and veterinary importance (and therefore the
diseases they transmit) is highly dependent on climate
[17]. The study was stratified to include four climatic
zones of India. The locations of the places sampled
represent a unique climatic condition of their own,
based on information produced by The World Meteorological Organization [18]. Ladakh in India’s far north
(3000 m altitude), experiences a temperature that
rarely exceeds 27°C in summer, while in winter temperatures drop to minus 20°C. Mumbai’s climate can
be described as tropical with a high level of humidity.
The mean average temperature for Mumbai ranges
from 16°C during winter to 30°C in summer. The climate of Delhi is a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate with average temperatures range from
7°C during its dry winter to 39°C in summer. Sikkim’s
climate can be described as subtropical highland with
mild temperatures range from 25°C in summer to 4°C
in winter [19].
To facilitate the fieldwork, collaborations were established with Vets Beyond Borders, Jeevaashram, Krishnaashram, Bombay Veterinary College and In Defence
of Animals India. These organisations allowed us access
to stray and refuge dogs through their Animal Birth
Control (ABC) and rabies vaccination programs. In
these programs stray dogs are impounded, vaccinated,
surgically neutered and released back to their original
location [20]. The purpose of this program is to stabilise
the street dog population and to help control the spread
of rabies. Capillary and whole blood samples were collected from 525 dogs from four different cities (Figure
1), namely Gangtok and Jorethang in Sikkim (n = 101),
Ladakh (n = 100) in Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi (n =
162) and Mumbai (n = 162). Blood samples were subjected to normal-thin and buffy-coat smears, air-dried
and fixed in 100% ethanol and later stained with Giemsa
for microscopic screening. Whole blood samples were
also applied onto QIAcard FTA® Four Spots (Qiagen)
for molecular-based screening later.
Microscopic examination of blood films

Stained blood films were examined under ×200 and
×400 objective lens for microfilariae. The microfilariae
were measured using Olympus BH-2 microscope (Japan)
calibrated eye micrometer and photographed using
Olympus DP12 digital microscope camera (Japan).
DNA extraction of adult D. immitis and blood from
QIAcard FTA®

DNA from an adult worm of D. immitis (courtesy of
Murdoch University) was extracted using the tissue
sample protocol of the MasterPure DNA purification kit
(Epicentre) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and utilised as a positive control for this study.

Approximately 500 μl of blood from each animal was
applied on QIAcard FTA® Four Spots (Qiagen) which
were cut into two cm strips (vertically) and allowed to
air dry. A modified DNA purification protocol for tissue
samples using the MasterPure DNA purification kit
(Epicentre) was used to extract DNA from FTA cards.
A 2 cm 2 piece of dried FTA card impregnated with a
blood sample was cut into small pieces using a sterile
scalpel blade on a clean microscope slide and placed in
a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. One μl of Proteinase K,
150 μl tissue lysis buffer and 150 μl phosphate buffer
saline were added to the FTA card sample and incubated overnight at 65°C. The lysed sample was then
cooled on ice for 5 minutes, 175 μl of MPC protein precipitation reagent added and the sample centrifuged at
6, 800 g for 10 minutes. Following centrifugation the
supernatant was transferred into a clean 1.5 ml tube and
500 μl of isopropanol added. The sample was then
inverted 30-40 times to promote DNA precipitation,
centrifuged at 6,800 g for 10 minute and the supernatant removed carefully so as to not dislodge the DNA
pellet. DNA pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol.
The sample was air dried for 5 minute to remove any
remaining ethanol before the DNA pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer.
PCR assays and DNA sequencing

A single-step multiplex PCR targeted at amplifying the
internal transcribed spacer-2 region of ribosomal DNA
developed by Rishniw and colleagues (2006) [9] was utilised for molecular screening of canine filarial species in
blood. Pan-filarial primers, forward: DIDR-F1 5’-AGT
GCG AAT TGC AGA CGC ATT GAG-3’ and reverse:
DIDR-R1 5’-AGC GGG TAA TCA CGA CTG AGT
TGA-3’ were utilized to amplify and differentiate D.
immitis, D. repens, B. malayi, B. pahangi, A. reconditum
and A. dracunculoides. The PCR assay was carried out
in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1 × PCR buffer,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each primer,
1 U of Taq polymerase and 1 μl of DNA template. The
PCR procedure was executed according to Rishniw et al.
(2006). The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel
in 1 × TAE buffer at 100V and visualised using Geldoc

(Biorad). The anticipated product sizes of each species
of microfilaria are listed in Table 2.
PCR products from 30% of all positive samples were
purified using Qiagen spin columns (Qiagen). When a
multiple-band product was obtained, target bands were
excised and purified with Qiaquick Gel Extraction kit
(Qiagen) prior to DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing
was performed using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems) with Big Dye 3.0 chemistry, after
which sequences were edited and assembled using Finch
TV (Geospiza Inc.).
Primer design for 18S gene and amplification

A nested PCR was designed to amplify a partial region
of the 18S rDNA of canine filarial species. Sequences
of the near complete 18S rDNA of B. malayi [GenBank: AF036588], Wuchereria bancrofti [GenBank:
AF227234] D. immitis [GenBank: AF036638] and Dipetalonema sp. [GenBank: DQ531723.1] were aligned
using Clustal W http://align.genome.jp/ and an external and an internal set of primers (Table 3) were
designed to amplify an approximately 800 bp and 700
bp product, respectively.
The PCR assay was carried out in a volume of 25 μl
containing 1 × PCR buffer (Qiagen), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200
μM of each dNTP, 0.5 μM of each of the forward and
reverse primers, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen)
and 1 μl of extracted DNA. Five microlitres of Q-solution
(Qiagen) was also added to optimise the PCR. The PCR
conditions of both primary and secondary PCR are as follows: an initial activation step at 94°C for 2 min was followed by 35 cycles of amplification (94°C for 30 s, 56°C
for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s) followed by a final extension

step of 72°C for 7 min. The template for the secondary
PCR amplification consisted of 1 μl of amplicon from the
primary amplification.
Phylogenetic analyses

Neighbour joining analyses were conducted with
Tamura-Nei parameter distance estimates and trees
constructed using Mega 4.1 software. Bootstrap analyses
were conducted using 1000 replicates.

Results
Out of the 525 dogs examined for circulating microfilaria,
27 (5.1%; 95% CI 3.3, 7.0) were positive using microscopic screening and 139 (26.5%; 95% CI 22.7, 30.3)

confirmed for at least one filarial species by PCR. The
most common species of canine filarial parasite identified
in this study was A. reconditum followed by D. repens
and D. immitis. The prevalence and geographical distribution of canine filarial species using both morphology
and multiplex PCR are summarised in Table 4.
Morphology identification

All microfilariae found in this study except for those
identified from dogs in Ladakh could be identified based
on previously described and published morphological
criteria. In Ladakh, 13 dogs were found to harbour
unsheathed microfilariae (Figure 2) with an average
length of 165 μm (range 130 μm to 180 μm), that did

microfilariae (Table 5). Two dogs in Ladakh were also
found to have mixed infections of the unidentified
microfilaria described above and another microfilaria of
an unusual appearance (Figure 3) which was identified
morphologically and presumed as Microfilaria (Mf.)
auquieri, a species previously described by Foley [21]
and Rioche [22] in Algeria, North Africa. Further analyses with regard to the genetic identity of the unidentified canine microfilariae in Ladakh were conducted
using the 18S and ITS-2 genes.
Single-step multiplex PCR

Out of 525 samples, 139 produced amplicons corresponding to D. immitis, D. repens or A. reconditum.
Three out of 527 dogs were found to have mixed infections based on the amplicon sizes; one from the city of
Mumbai with D. repens and A. reconditum, and two
from the city of Delhi with D. immitis and A. reconditum, and D. immitis with D. repens. Two samples from
Ladakh which found to have mixed infections by microscopic screening with presumably Mf. auquieri, only
produced a single amplicon corresponds to A. reconditum. All PCR products amplified and sequenced at the
ITS-2 region, except those from Ladakh as well as A.
reconditum isolates from Delhi and Mumbai had their
multiplex PCR results confirmed with published
sequences for D. immitis from Mizoram, India [GenBank: EU087699], D. repens from Kerala, India [GenBank: FJ717410] and A. reconditum from Taiwan
[GenBank: AF217801] with 99-100% homology on the
basic local alignment search tool, BLASTn http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi.
Acanthocheilonema reconditum isolates from Delhi
and Mumbai displayed 95% and 90% homology to the
published ITS-2 sequence for A. reconditum from Taiwan [GenBank: AF217801]. Sequences for the ITS-2
region of Acanthocheilonema isolates from each city;

Delhi, Mumbai and Ladakh were submitted to GenBank
under accession numbers GU593976, GU593978 and
GU593978, respectively.
Genetic characterisation of unidentified canine
microfilaria species

Clear and readable sequences spanning a 441 bp region
of the SSU rDNA gene were obtained from a single
Ladakhi isolate of the unidentified species of canine
microfilaria. These were aligned and compared with previously published sequences of closely related filariid
species B. malayi [GenBank: AF036588], Loa loa [GenBank DQ094173], W. bancrofti [GenBank: AY843436],
A. vitae [GenBank: DQ094171], Onchocerca cervicalis
[GenBank: DQ094174], Setaria digitata [GenBank:
DQ094175] and D. immitis [GenBank: AF182647] using
Clustal W (BioEdit v 7.0.5.3). Thelazia lacrymalis [GenBank: DQ503458] was used as an outgroup [23].
Although bootstrap support was low for the differentiation of all genera of filariid, the unidentified microfilariae isolated from dogs in Ladakh were distinctly placed
within the same clade as A. vitae (Figure 4).
ITS-2 sequences of Acanthocheilonema were found to
have identical sequence homology within the same geographical area. Sequences of six of the unidentified
microfilaria isolates from Ladakh, two isolates of A.
reconditum from Mumbai and Delhi and a single isolate
from Sikkim, together with GenBank reference
sequences of canine filarial species A. reconditum [GenBank: AF217801], A. dracunculoides [GenBank:
DQ018785] were compared and aligned with a using
Clustal W (BioEdit v 7.0.5.3).
The topology of the unrooted phenogram recognises
five major groups within the genus Acanthocheilonema,
which encompassed A. reconditum from Taiwan/Sikkim,
A. reconditum from Delhi, A. reconditum from Mumbai,
Acanthocheilonema isolates from Ladakh and A. dracunculoides as separate groups. Isolates from Mumbai

Discussion
This is the first comprehensive study that has utilised a
combination of conventional and molecular techniques
to determine the distribution and occurrence of canine
filarial species in India. Despite anecdotal accounts of
heartworm being present in Delhi, this study is the first
to confirm its presence in that city, together with D.
repens. This study is in agreement with previous reports
[6,11,24] demonstrating a low prevalence of microfilaraemia overall, and that the most common filarial species
found in India are A. reconditum and D. repens. Despite
the relatively limited geographical locations used in this
study, our results also support the aforementioned
hypothesis that canine heartworm is primarily confined
to tropical and sub-tropical areas of northern India, but
seems to be absent towards the south. This hypothesis
is debatable since competent mosquito vectors for D.
immitis are present throughout central and southern
India. For example, Aedes albopictus [25-27], a competent vector for D. immitis is present in Maharastra, Karnataka and Pondicherry [28], and heartworm is yet to be

Megat Abd Rani et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:30
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/30

reported in dogs from these areas where climate would
support larval development within the mosquito vector.
It is noteworthy however that the prevalence of all filarial species determined in the current study may still an
underestimate of its true value due to false negative test
results. The high prevalence of D. immitis by necropsy
that was reported in eastern and central India cannot be
disregarded [29,30]. Authors of these studies also mentioned that more than 30% of dogs positive for D. immitis had occult infections, which is in agreement with
studies from Australia in the 1980s [31]. Several types of
occult filarial infection in dogs have been documented:
pre-patent infection, naturally occurring unisexual infection and immune-mediated clearance of microfilariae, a
similar situation that exists also in human filariasis
[3,32-34]. PCR has been shown to detect occult infections of Loa loa in humans [35,36], however a recent
study by Duscher (2009) has shown that a minimum
parasitaemia level of 6 ± 0.43 microfilariae per 100 μl of
blood on the FTA cards is need for detection of D.
repens microfilariae by PCR detection [37]. The authors
explain that it is hard to distribute large extracellular
metazoan stages such as microfilariae on a filter paper,
and this can therefore lead to false negative results for
low parasitaemia infections. Furthermore, macrocyclic
lactones such as ivermectin are known to possess microfilaricidal effects. Almost half the refuge dogs from
Mumbai and Delhi sampled in this study had a history
of receiving treatment with ivermectin for the control of
gastrointestinal and ectoparasites. A recent study by
Bazzocchi and colleagues [38] confirmed that with prolonged treatment of ivermectin, a significant decreased
in circulating microfilariemia in dogs (less than 100
microfilariae/ml) occurred.
The most common filarial species found in dogs from
this study are A. reconditum and D. repens. Most infections with A. reconditum and D. repens do not contribute
to any clinical illness in dogs, but this is not the case in
humans [1,2]. Dirofilaria repens causing subcutaneous
nodules and sub-conjunctival infections in humans is
now considered as a re-emerging zoonoses and it often
leads to misdiagnosis of malignant tumours in endemic
areas [1,24]. Although D. repens is endemic to a wide
geographical area spanning Europe and Asia, human
cases, often involving nodules in organs such as lungs,
male genitals and female breast are most commonly
reported from Italy and Sri Lanka [39]. With regard to
Acanthocheilonema, only one human case has been
reported in Australia, which involved the eye; the recovered worm morphological features were consistent with
an unfertilised adult female A. reconditum [40]. Dirofilaria immitis infection in humans is rarely reported, but
associated with pulmonary lesions or radiological coin
lesions of the lung. The significance of D. immitis

infection in human is the confusion and invariable radiological misdiagnosis of a primary or metastatic lung
tumour, which usually leads to thoracotomy for open
lung biopsy or wedge resection of the lung to obtain the
correct diagnosis [41,42]. Sporadic reports of the immature heartworm in unusual locations such as the eye,
mesentery, cerebral artery, spermatic cord and liver also
exist [43-47]. To date, twelve cases of human subcutaneous dirofilariasis due to D. repens has been reported in
southern India [24] and a single case of human pulmonary dirofilariasis due to D. immitis in Mumbai [15].
All microfilariae found in this study except for those
identified from dogs in Ladakh could be identified based
on previously described and published morphological
criteria. Morphologic dimensions of the microfilariae
genetically characterised as A. reconditum from Delhi,
Mumbai and Sikkim matched previously documented
measurements for A. reconditum. This was supported by
molecular evidence to show that the isolates clustered
within the A. reconditum group on phylogenetic analysis. Genetic distances of the ITS-2 region between A.
reconditum and isolates from Delhi were within the
range expected for intra-species variation of different
geographical populations. However genetic distances of
the ITS-2 region between A. reconditum and isolates
from Mumbai were within the range expected for separate species of the same genera. Different species of
filarial nematodes are reported to vary in their degree of
intra-species variation based on the ITS-2 gene [48],
making this comparative analysis difficult to confirm.
Future molecular epidemiological studies comparing the
intra-species variation of Acanthocheilonema spp. in different geographical locations at multiple loci is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. This finding is in
contrast to the situation discovered with the microfilariae found to infect nearly half the dogs in Ladakh. Morphologically, the length of these latter microfilariae did
not match any of the documented or known species of
canine filariae. Molecular evidence based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 18S and ITS-2 regions provided
strong evidence to show that the canine microfilariae
found in Ladakh belong to a novel species of Acanthocheilonema. Genetic distances between this novel species
and A. reconditum were within the range expected for
separate species of the same genera. We propose that in
the interim, this new species of microfilaria be designated Acanthocheilonema ladakhii until further and
more detailed morphological, molecular and clinicpathological studies are undertaken to describe and
name this novel species of canine filarial parasite and
ascertain its veterinary significance.
This study also presents the first report of what we presume to be Mf. auquieri in India and this serendipitous
re-encounter with this filarial species after 50 years is of

Megat Abd Rani et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:30

great parasitological interest. Although previously
reported in stray dogs of Algeria, there is still much to be
discovered about this enigmatic parasite. The adult form
of Mf. auquieri is not yet known as attempts to search
for the adult parasite failed despite a systematic postmortem by the early French researchers [22]. It is interesting to note also that almost all dogs in Ladakh, and a
small proportion in Delhi, were found infested with a
species of blood-sucking fly (authors’ personal observation), identified as Hippobosca longipennis syn. capensis
Fabricius, 1805 [49], which is known to be an intermediate host and vector of A. dracunculoides [50]. Our findings in Ladakh have prompted us to speculate whether
this same Hippobosca fly is also the vector/intermediate
host for Mf. auquieri or whether it is just mere co-incidence that this fly also happens to be common in Algeria
where Mf. auquieri was first reported [49].
As a side note the authors would like to add that the
application of blood samples to filter paper-based technology, such as the FTA cards used in this study, allow
for the rapid and safe dispatch of samples to diagnostic
facilities capable of PCR-based diagnosis, with the added
advantage of providing an archival potential. However,
using this technique in humid regions can result in fungal contamination of the blood-impregnated filter paper
as we have experienced during this study. A careful drying process of the papers is therefore recommended to
prevent this problem from occurring.

Conclusion
At least six species of filarial parasite are now known to
infect dogs in India, two of which were reported for the
first time in this study, namely Mf. auquieri and a novel
species of Acanthocheilonema, both of which were discovered in the Himalayan city of Ladakh. The study also
confirms and extends the known geographical distribution of canine heartworm in India. The distribution of
heartworm in India extends from the Pakistani border
in the west [51], Delhi and Sikkim in the north to the
Burmese border in the east and Orissa to the south.
The public health importance of D. repens also suggests
that appropriate prophylaxis be administered to dogs
throughout central and west India from as far south as
Kerala to as far north as Delhi. From a diagnostic viewpoint, it is important to utilise an immunodiagnostic
test that will not cross-react [8] between D. immitis and
D. repens in areas where these two filarial species coexist, for example, Delhi.
