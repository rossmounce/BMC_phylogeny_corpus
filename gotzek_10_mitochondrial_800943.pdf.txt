Mitochondrial genome evolution in fire ants
(Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
Dietrich Gotzek1*, Jessica Clarke2, DeWayne Shoemaker3

Abstract
Background: Complete mitochondrial genome sequences have become important tools for the study of genome
architecture, phylogeny, and molecular evolution. Despite the rapid increase in available mitogenomes, the
taxonomic sampling often poorly reflects phylogenetic diversity and is often also biased to represent deeper
(family-level) evolutionary relationships.
Results: We present the first fully sequenced ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) mitochondrial genomes. We sampled
four mitogenomes from three species of fire ants, genus Solenopsis, which represent various evolutionary depths.
Overall, ant mitogenomes appear to be typical of hymenopteran mitogenomes, displaying a general A+T-bias. The
Solenopsis mitogenomes are slightly more compact than other hymentoperan mitogenomes (~15.5 kb), retaining
all protein coding genes, ribosomal, and transfer RNAs. We also present evidence of recombination between the
mitogenomes of the two conspecific Solenopsis mitogenomes. Finally, we discuss potential ways to improve the
estimation of phylogenies using complete mitochondrial genome sequences.
Conclusions: The ant mitogenome presents an important addition to the continued efforts in studying
hymenopteran mitogenome architecture, evolution, and phylogenetics. We provide further evidence that the
sampling across many taxonomic levels (including conspecifics and congeners) is useful and important to gain
detailed insights into mitogenome evolution. We also discuss ways that may help improve the use of
mitogenomes in phylogenetic analyses by accounting for non-stationary and non-homogeneous evolution among
branches.

Background
There has been a rapid proliferation of whole mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) sequenced in recent years,
no doubt driven in part by the increasing speed and
decreasing cost of sequencing technologies. Whole mitogenomes are increasingly used in phylogenetic studies
[1-6] and in analyses of genome rearrangements [7-11],
which can also be used for phylogenetic inference
[8,12-16].
However, the utility of these datasets for these purposes greatly depends on taxon sampling. Currently, 237
insect mitogenomes have been fully sequenced (GenBank Sept. 21, 2009), yet the taxa utilized for these
sequencing studies often do not reflect the distribution
of species diversity. For example, Hymenoptera is one of

the most species-rich insect orders (~130,000 described
species in 22 superfamilies [17]), yet only 11 mitogenomes have been fully sequenced (compared to 28 for
beetles [300,000 species] and 69 for flies [110,000 species]). Despite a further seven hymenopteran mitogenomes being partially sequenced (Figure 1), taxon
sampling still poorly reflects phylogenetic diversity of
this important order across many taxonomic levels.
Naturally, sampling is highly dependent on the questions a given researcher wishes to address with the data,
yet biased sampling greatly limits the utility of the generated mitogenomic data in a comparative framework.
For example, of the ten families of bees (Apoidea) and of
the nine families of vespids (Vespoidea) only a single
family (Apidae and Vespidae, respectively) of each superfamily has a sequenced mitogenome. But not only are
many taxonomically and ecologically important families
unsampled, there is also a dearth of mitogenomes for closely related species. We follow Gissi et al. [18] in arguing

that to better understand mitochondrial genome evolution we require an improved taxon sampling scheme that
not only captures phylogenetic diversity more broadly
but also takes into account various evolutionary depths,
including variation within or among closely related
species.
Hence, we here present the first complete mitogenomes of ants (Hymentopera: Formicidae; four mitogenomes from three fire ant species) and discuss their
evolution in light of the other hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes. The four mitogenomes presented here
represent important contributions to the ever expanding
dataset of complete hymenopteran mitochondrial genomes in that they represent a previously unsampled,
highly diverse, and ecologically dominant vespoid family
(Formicidae). Our mitogenome data for three fire ant
species belonging to two species groups [19,20] also
provides insights into mitogenome evolution at lower
taxonomic levels. Such data generally are rare [18], with
the notable exceptions in insects of a study employing
comparable sampling for Nasonia [21] and much more
extensive sampling in Drosophila (38 mitogenomes;
GenBank Sept. 21, 2009).

mitogenomes from Solenopsis invicta Buren, 1972
(referred to hereafter as “PMS” and “VMS” mitogenomes), one mitogenome from the closely related species
S. richteri Buren, 1972 (”richteri“ mitogenome) and one
mitogenome from a more distantly related fire ant species S. geminata (Fabricius, 1804) (”geminata“ mitogenome). These first complete mitogenome data for ants
expand taxon selection of one of the largest and most
diverse hymenopteran superfamilies (Vespoidea).
At first look, the mitogenomes of Solenopsis appear to
be unremarkable compared with other hymenopteran
mitogenomes, containing the same complement of
protein-coding loci, tRNAs, rRNAs, and a pronounced A
+T-bias (Table 1). Overall the ant mitogenomes are less
divergent than those of Nasonia (3 - 13% uncorrected
nucleotide distance, π, compared with ~15% among jewel
wasps), however this comparison should be viewed with
caution since it does not consider the potential differences
in age among species within the Nasonia and Solenopsis
species groups, which is not known. Also, we found no
clear evidence of positive, directional selection acting on
the ant mitogenomes (dN/dS ≈ 0.001 - 0.034 for the 13
protein coding genes using the site model [22,23]).

Results and Discussion
For the present study we sequenced four complete mitogenomes from three fire ant species. These included two

protein-coding genes and both rRNAs in the same order
and direction of the hypothesized ancestral pancrustacean mitogenome (Figure 2). As in the three Nasonia
species [21], the four Solenopsis mitogenomes share
identical architectures at the tRNA loci as well. However, the three methods we used to identify tRNAs
greatly differed in sensitivity and accuracy (Table 2).
Both DOGMA (used at COVE cut-off score = 20) and
ARWEN over-predicted tRNAs (usually well over 30 for
DOGMA and up to 26 by ARWEN). As a result, they
usually identified more of the 22 tRNAs than tRNAscan-SE. tRNAscan-SE was more conservative, although
some predictions were not well supported (COVE scores
< 20). It also misidentified tRNAs three times: two
tRNA-F in geminata (COVE = 19.47) and at the same
position in VMS (COVE = 18.65) and tRNA-P (COVE =
23.85) also in VMS. Since all of these tRNAs overlap
with SrRNA (tRNA-F) or nad5 (tRNA-P) and have relatively low COVE scores, we considered them false positives. Only twice were none of the methods able to
detect tRNAs: tRNA-S 1 in geminata and tRNA-N in
VMS. However, we were able to manually fold these
tRNAs.
The location of tRNAs differs from the hypothetical
ancestral hymenopteran mitogenome [24], which is also a
typical feature of hymenopteran mitogenome architecture
[11,25]. However, with only three apparent translocations,
the Solenopsis mitogenome architecture appears to be less
derived than that of the other hymenopteran mitogenomes
[11,25-32]. Most mitogenome rearrangements in

Hymenoptera appear to be selectively neutral and involve
tRNA translocations around the coxII - atp8 junction
[29,30] and the nd3 - nd5 junction [11,25]. The Solenopsis
mitogenomes show no variation in the coxII - atp8 junction and a translocation of tRNA-N from the nd3 - nd5
junction to the SrRNA - nd2 junction. The tRNA-V translocation also moved to the SrRNA - nd2 junction. Various
types of gene order rearrangements are generally recognized, differing by their location (local vs. distant) and
whether they retain their original orientation (inverted vs.
not inverted) and generally can be classified into one of
several categories: local inversions, local translocations
(gene shuffling), translocations, and remote inversions (an
inverted translocation) [25].
Visual inspection of the source locations for these two
translocations led us to test the manner of the rearrangement, since short sequences of the length of typical
tRNAs (approximately 60-80 bp) remained at the source
locations (hereafter termed “degenerate” tRNAs). A
duplication/loss model of translocation seems plausible
for the tRNA-V translocation, whereas this model seems
less likely for the tRNA-N rearrangement, since this
rearrangement also involves an inversion (remote inversion). We consider an intra-mitochondrial recombination event [28] an unlikely mechanism in this particular
case as well, since the translocation spanned half of the
mitogenome and none of the intermediate genes are
inverted or rearranged. Since DOGMA and ARWEN
had placed an additional tRNA-N in the same position
but opposite orientation as the tRNA-D in the VMS

DOGMA and ARWEN generally overpredicted tRNAs (data not shown) and tRNAscan underpredicted tRNA loci. COVE scores >20 are generally considered to
indicate reliable identification of tRNAs. Some tRNAs were readily identified by all methods, whereas some proved harder to identify and had to be manually
folded in some mitogenomes (e.g., tRNA-S1). Loci underlined are located on the N strand.

mitogenome (data not shown), we included all hymenopteran tRNA-N, -V, and -D loci in a phylogenetic
analysis with the relevant Solenopsis tRNAs. The resulting tree placed the tRNA-D, tRNA-V, and degenerate

tRNA-N firmly among their respective tRNA species,
whereas the degenerate tRNA-V and new tRNA-N are
clearly not closely related to any other tRNAs (Figure 3).
This suggests that the identification of the overlapping

loci. Blue identify all tRNA-N loci, including “new” and “degenerated” loci in Solenopsis. Green branches are tRNA-V loci, again with the “new”
and “degenerated” loci labeled. The values above the long major branches are bootstrap support (100 replicates).

Gotzek et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:300

tRNA-N over tRNA-D in VMS was erroneous. Also, the
“new” translocated tRNA-V is clearly homologous to the
other hymenopteran tRNA-V genes, suggesting a real
translocation event. However, the identity of the degenerate locus is less clear. Since it forms a distinct and
highly supported clade, we are inclined to interpret this
as a duplication/loss translocation and the “degenerate”
tRNA-V as a vestigial spacer, which we initially erroneously hypothesized to be a degenerate tRNA due to
its position and length. Finally, the source of the tRNAN is not clear and at present since we are unable to
determine the source tRNA in our dataset (data not
shown), but it is becoming increasingly clear that our
understanding of tRNA evolution is rapidly changing
[33-43]. We will require better sampling of other mitogenomes to shed light on the evolution of this tRNA.
Visual inspection of tRNAs across species reveals that
there is considerable amount of variation due to point
mutations and indels in almost all tRNAs. This variation
results in differences in ability of the three tRNA identification methods to correctly identify tRNAs across species (Table 2), suggesting that congeneric comparative
studies of tRNAs are fruitful endeavors to studying
tRNA evolution and mitgenome architecture [18].
Nucleotide and codon bias

The four Solenopsis mitogenomes are consistently A+Tbiased, but this bias is less pronounced than in any of
the other apocritan Hymenoptera (~1-10% less;
Figure 4A). Wei et al. [44] describe the same pattern for
a distantly related evanid wasp, which suggests that the
A+T-bias is perhaps more variable across the hymentoperan phylogeny than previously realized. There was no
significant difference in nucleotide bias of the four ant
mitogenomes (Table 1). Additionally, a T-bias persisted
across protein coding regions on the coding strand (Figure 5). This was especially pronounced across the second codon positions. No evidence for codon bias was
found after correcting for nucleotide bias (Table 1).
Recombination

Recombination in animal mitogenomes has been well
documented [45-47]. Nonetheless, such recombination
remains difficult to detect reliably, no doubt in part due
to the lack of power of many analytical methods developed for detecting recombination [48]. This pattern is
reflected in our data set as well, as most methods were
unable to detect statistically significant signatures of
recombination. However, three local methods found significant support for a single recombination event within
the PMS mitogenome (Table 3, Figure 6), with an
approximately 500 bp surrounding the nd6 - cytb junction (nucleotide positions 8,971-9,517 of the aligned

Page 5 of 13

Solenopsis mitogenomes) derived from a VMS-like
ancestor.
Consistent with this scenario, six additional methods
of analysis showed statistically non-significant yet congruent signals of recombination in the same location.
One likely reason for the comparatively weak support
for the hypothesized recombination event is that the
translocation could have occurred sufficiently long ago
that the signal of the event has decayed. Our results are
unlikely an experimental artifact, since the recombinant
sequence was recovered from separate PCR (and
sequencing) reactions in which the initial PCR reactions
utilized different conserved primers flanking this region.
Further, the sequence data were high quality, the
sequences differ slightly from the other three sequences,
and the sequence traces do not show any evidence of
conflicting base calls.
Phylogeny

The phylogenetic tree recovered from all four Solenopsis
mitogenomes is identical to a tree generated previously
using sequence data from a much shorter region (coxI/
tRNA-L 2 /coxII) and demonstrates that the S. invicta
mitogenomes are not monophyletic: the PMS invicta
mitogenome is more closely related to richteri than the
VMS invicta mitogenome [49] (Figure 4). This phylogenetic pattern is upheld throughout the complete mitochondrial alignment, except for the short fragment
shown above to have been transferred during the
recombination event (Figure 6).
Our phylogenetic analysis of all hymenopteran mitogenomes encountered similar problems described previously [6,50-52] in that some expected relationships
were not recovered, e.g. the sister taxa relationship
between the Proctotrupomorpha (Nasonia and Vanhornia; sensu Rasnitsyn [53]) and the remainder of the
Apocrita [50,54] or the sister relationship of the Ichneumonoidea (represented by Ichneumonidae in this study)
with the Aculeata (Vespomorpha sensu Rasnitsyn [53])
[6,51,52,54]. Also, our phylogenetic analyses were unable
to support the monophyly of the Vespoidea (ants and
vespids; Figure 4) due to the placement of Solenopsis
outside of the Vespidae + Apoidea clade with high
branch support. While ants generally are considered to
belong to the Vespoidea [55], some doubts have been
raised regarding the monophyly of this superfamily
[54,56] and our results mirror those of Dowton et al.
[52] using only the mitochondrial 16 S rRNA locus.
Our homotachous (site specific rates do not change
along tree) Bayesian analysis recovered a topology fully
concordant with that of Dowton et al. [6] (Figure 4B).
This was not surprising, since we tried to follow the
suggestions made by Dowton et al. [6] regarding the
best analysis parameters for hymentoperan mitogenomic

sampling (Solenopsis, Diadegma, Evania). However, this

Bayesian analysis recovered the Ichneumonidae as a sister group to Schlettererius (Stephanidae), the other analyses placed the Ichneumonidae basal to an Aculeata +

methods placed Primeuchroeus with Solenopsis, whereas
both Bayesian analyses left its position unresolved at the
base of the other Aculeata. However, all of these placements were poorly supported regardless of the branch
support measure. Our analyses suggest that optimality
criteria and models of nucleotide evolution have a stronger influence on the resulting phylogenetic inference in
our dataset than taxon sampling. The importance of
optimality criterion was previously also noted by Dowton et al. [6] and suggests that the extraction of phylogenetic signal from hymenopteran mitogenomic data is
not simple.
While Dowton et al. [6] showed that the accuracy of
mitogenomic phylogenetic analysis is greatly improved
by the implementation of a particular partitioning
scheme in a Bayesian framework, their analyses failed to
account for heterotachous (site specific rate of evolution
changes along the tree) and non-stationarity (base frequencies change along the tree) substitution processes
between branches during phylogenetic analyses [57-60],
of which the latter is an especially well-known feature of
the hymenopteran mitogenomes [[6,44,61,62] this
study]. Hence, we compared the phylogenies derived
under homotachous and stationary models of nucleotide
substitution with those allowing site specific rates of
change and base frequencies to change between
branches. We implemented the covarion model [59] in

MrBayes to accommodate heterotachy and the model of
Galtier and Gouy [57] to account for non-stationarity
(and non-homogeneity) using nhPhyML. Applying Galtier and Gouy’s [57] model under the maximum likelihood criterion significantly improved the fit of the
model to the data (nhPhyML: -lnL = 159,198.79453;
PhyML: -lnL = 160,821.701853; df = 60, LRT =
3245.8125, p < 0.0001 [58]), but it did not result in a
different topology (Figure 4A). Use of the covarion
model (which accommodates heterotachy by allowing
sites to change their substitution rate along branches by
being switched on or off) in the Bayesian framework did
not result in an improvement in log-likelihood (covarion
model: -lnL = 156,475.84; stationary model: -lnL =
156,228.88), but recovered a different topology almost
identical to that recovered under the maximum

likelihood optimality criterion (Figure 4B). This decrease
in log-likelihood of the covarion model was surprising
[but see [60]], but the exact implementation of heterotachy may be important [60,63] so the evaluation of other
heterotachous models (e.g., mixed branch length model
[64] or the RERV model [65]) may be warranted. More
thorough studies are undoubtedly required to tease
apart the contribution and possible interaction between
different models and optimality criteria [4,6,60,63,66].
It is evident that reconstructing the hymenopteran
phylogeny using only mitogenome data is problematic
due to a variety of factors, e.g, differences in GC-content
and rates of evolution among branches [64] or an
ancient rapid diversification event [67,68] which is
known to greatly complicate phylogenetic inference [69].
To account for these confounding factors, one should

Gotzek et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/300

attempt to break up long branches by increased taxon
sampling wherever possible. Including several species
per genus (Nasonia, Bombus, and Solenopsis) as we have
done is not very effective. Hence we suggest adding
more genera and previously unsampled higher level taxa
to more effectively break up long branches. While
increased taxon sampling will likely rapidly occur in the
near future, we agree with earlier suggestions of the
importance of not relying on mitogenomes as the sole
source of data for inferring phylogenetic relationships
[70]. Mitochondria essentially provide one very specific
evolutionary history of a lineage since they are maternally inherited as single markers independently from the
nuclear genome, and their utility can be further compromised if their transmission is influenced by intracellular symbionts such as Wolbachia [70]. Given the
rapidly decreasing costs in high-through-put sequencing
and the various rapidly increasing genomic resources for
several apocritan lineages (Apis and Nasonia genomes
[71-73], Solenopsis, Camponotus, Vespula, and Microctonus genomic libraries [74-78]), we are hopeful that
future phylogenetic work will be based on a broader
genetic basis employing many more molecular characters [72].

Conclusions
To fully clarify the evolution of mitochondrial genomes
in the Hymenoptera will require much greater sampling
at all taxonomic levels (i.e., from the superfamily to the
species and possibly intraspecific level), which should
provide much needed data to fully address the patterns
and rate of evolution and genome organization in this
organelle. While this information will yield an increased
understanding of hymenopteran evolutionary history,
mitogenome studies need to be complemented by phylogenetic studies utilizing other sources of data against
which we can compare and contrast the information
yielded by whole mitochondrial genome analyses. Given
the recent rate of publications with full mitogenomes,
this will no doubt occur in the near future, yet could be
greatly optimized through concerted sampling efforts by
the greater scientific community.
Methods
Generation of sequence data

Complete mitochondrial genomes were generated for
four individuals from three closely related Solenopsis
species. The two S. invicta samples were collected in
Pascagoula, MS (PMS) and Vera, MS (VMS), S. geminata was collected in Tallahassee, FL, and S. richteri
was collected in Rosario, Argentina. Even though the
two S. invicta mitogenomes were sequenced from specimens collected in the invasive range, the ~1 kb coxI/
tRNA-L 2 /coxII section of these mitogenomes are

Page 9 of 13

identical to haplotypes from the native range (PMS is
H22 [GenBank: AY249114]; VMS is H5 [GenBank:
AY249097]) and represent two widely divergent clades
within S. invicta and two geographically and genetically
distinct populations (Argentina and Brazil) [49,79]. We
sequenced the entire mitogenome of each individual
using a primer walking approach by performing 34-40
separate PCRs of genomic portions of the genome of
variable size (~400-1,000 bp). We designed primers such
that substantial overlap occurs between the various
amplicons (allowing independent verification of
sequence data by increasing depth of coverage) and
such that the combination of all PCR amplicons
spanned the entire genome. We initially attempted to
amplify portions of the genome using conserved primers
published in Simon et al. [80] as well as by designing
conserved primers for a subset of coding genes by aligning available mitogenome sequences for Apis mellifera
[GenBank: NC001566] and Drosophila yakuba [GenBank: NC001322]. We subsequently designed additional
primers spanning other regions with no or low coverage
using sequence data generated for fire ants. All primers
developed and used for this study are presented in
Additional file 1.
Several lines of evidence suggest that our sequences
generated specifically represent mitochondrial genomic
DNA rather than nuclear mitochondrial-like sequences
(numts), which appear to be common and are generally
short and highly fragmented in ants and other Hymenoptera [81-83]: The redundant yet independent PCR
amplification of essentially every genomic region, the
absence of ambiguous base calls characteristic of heterozygotes, the PCR amplification of the complete genome,
and the generation of a contig identical in sequence to
PMS using 454 pyrosequencing technology (DDS
unpublished data).
All PCR amplicons were sequenced in both directions
and each strand was assembled into single contigs with
overlapping ends, indicating that our mitogenome
sequences contained no gaps. Leading and lagging
strand for each mitogenome were then aligned and
manually checked for indels or ambiguous base calls.
Mitogenomes were deposited in the NCBI GenBank
database [GenBank: HQ215537, HQ215538, HQ215539,
HQ215540].
Genome annotation

Mitogenomes were annotated using the DOGMA webserver [84], which uses BLASTX against a custom database to identify protein coding genes. We verified all
annotations made with DOGMA: coding regions were
checked against a S. invicta EST database [75] and
tRNAs were validated using ARWEN 1.2 [85] and
tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [86] since DOGMA only uses COVE

Gotzek et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/300

[87] to identify tRNAs. Generally, tRNAscan-SE has very
low false positive rates and thus rarely mispredicts
tRNAs (COVE scores ≥ 20 are usually considered reliable [86]), whereas ARWEN has a low false negative
rate and usually identifies all tRNAs [85]. Generally,
DOGMA identified significantly more tRNAs than either
ARWEN or tRNAscan-SE, sometimes with quite high
COVE scores. Two tRNAs in particular were not recovered, tRNA-S1 and tRNA-N. These, however could be
folded manually.
Sequence analyses

Nucleotide sequences were aligned based on amino acid
alignments using MUSCLE 3.6 [88]. Models of nucleotide evolution were estimated for protein coding genes
using jModeltest [89]. DnaSP 4.50.3 [90] was used to
estimate codon usage bias and nucleotide frequency bias
[91-93]. The CODEML program in the PAML4.2 package [94] was used to test for site-specific evidence of
positive selection while correcting for nucleotide bias
[95]. We employed the following parameters: runmode
= 0, omega and kappa estimated (from three different
starting points), empirical codon frequencies from each
codon position (codonfreq = 2).
Following the recommendations of Posada [48], we
employed a suite of recombination detection programs
offered in the program packages TOPALi 2.5 [96] and
RPD 3b32 [97] and the RecombiTest website [46]http://
www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/CSE/test/index.php to test for
recombination in the Solenopsis mitogenomes (see
Table 3 for specific tests used). When any of the recombination tests only utilized three sequences at a time (e.
g., RDP), analyses were repeated with every possible
sequence triplet combination and p-values were Bonferroni corrected. All settings were left at the software
default for the initial analyses, except for the PDM and
LRT, where we used flexible window sizes. The highest
acceptable p-value was 0.05 (unless Bonferroni corrected). Loosely following Tsaousis et al.’s [45] criteria
for evidence of recombination, we consider as good evidence for recombination when more than one test
detected a recombination event (although without
regard to the test being a global or a local method). The
more tests recovering evidence for recombination the
more confident we are that it represents a true recombination event. Although this classification is admittedly
arbitrary, we agree with White et al. [98] that identifying
instances of recombination is inherently difficult and
requires the heuristic use of several methods to identify
potential recombinants.
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on protein coding genes of the hymentoperan mitogenomes and 9 outgroups (3 flies [GenBank: X03240, AF260826,
AJ242872], 3 beetles [GenBank: AJ312413, DQ768215,

Page 10 of 13

AB267275], and 3 moths [GenBank: AF442957,
AF149768, AY242996]). jModeltest [89] was used to
estimate the most appropriate model of nucleotide evolution for each codon position at each locus separately.
Following the suggestion of Dowton et al. [6] we used
the Bayesian approach using nucleotide sequences and
implemented the GTR+I+Γ model of sequence evolution
across genes and codon positions since jModeltest
usually indentified this model as the best fitting for each
data partition. MrBayes 3.1.2 [99] was then used to
recover phylogenetic hypotheses. All parameters were
unlinked between partitions. Two independent analyses
were run for three million generations, each with three
heated and one cold chain. Parameters were sampled
every 1000th generation. Convergence between runs was
assessed when log-likelihoods had plateaued, PRSF factors were ~1, and split frequencies had dropped < 0.01.
Samples taken prior to convergence were removed
before samples were summarized. The same analysis
was repeated implementing the covariotide model of
sequence evolution to account for heterotachy (changes
in site-specific evolutionary rates across lineages) [59],
which has been shown to effectively accommodate heterotachy [[66], but see [60]]. Since this analysis took
longer to converge, 5 million generations were run.
Maximum likelihood analyses were implemented on
the PhyML 3.0 webserver [100]http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/. We implemented the GTR+I+Γ model
of nucleotide substitution on the unpartitioned dataset,
estimated proportion of invariable sites and gamma
shape parameter using six substitution rate categories,
and optimized equilibrium frequencies, branch lengths,
and tree topology (using the nearest-neighbor interchange [NNI] and sub-tree pruning and regrafting
[SPR]) on five random starting trees. In addition to running one hundred bootstrap replicates to estimate levels
of branch support, we also implemented the SH-like
aLRT, which assesses the likelihood gain of the presence
of that branch [101]. To accommodate non-stationarity
(changes of base frequencies between branches) we
implemented nhPhyML-Discrete [58] using default
options and the topology recovered from the heterotachous Bayesian analysis as the starting tree.
The evolution of tRNA-N was studied using phylogenetic analyses as suggested by Saks et al. [34] and Dowton and Austin [29], which were conducted using 100
bootstrap replicates in PhyML using the same configuration as described above. Other relevant hymenopteran
tRNAs (D, N, and V) were downloaded from GenBank
and aligned using MUSCLE. Unlike other authors
[29,37,38], unpaired loops and anticodons were not
removed following the suggestions of Wong et al. [102].
However, we would like to point out that the phylogenetic analysis should only be interpreted as a heuristic

Gotzek et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:300

tool, since the alignment of many very short, evolutionary very old, and highly AT-biased sequences is not trivial, regardless of alignment method used or prior
editing to remove problematic areas.
