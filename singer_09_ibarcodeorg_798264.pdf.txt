Abstract
Background: DNA sequences have become a primary source of information in biodiversity
analysis. For example, short standardized species-specific genomic regions, DNA barcodes, are
being used as a global standard for species identification and biodiversity studies. Most DNA
barcodes are being generated by laboratories that have an expertise in DNA sequencing but not in
bioinformatics data analysis. Therefore, we have developed a web-based suite of tools to help the
DNA barcode researchers analyze their vast datasets.
Results: Our web-based tools, available at http://www.ibarcode.org, allow the user to manage
their barcode datasets, cull out non-unique sequences, identify haplotypes within a species, and
examine the within- to between-species divergences. In addition, we provide a number of
phylogenetics tools that will allow the user to manipulate phylogenetic trees generated by other
popular programs.
Conclusion: The use of a web-based portal for barcode analysis is convenient, especially since the
WWW is inherently platform-neutral. Indeed, we have even taken care to ensure that our website
is usable from handheld devices such as PDAs and smartphones. Although the current set of tools
available at iBarcode.org were developed to meet our own analytic needs, we hope that feedback
from users will spark the development of future tools. We also welcome user-built modules that
can be incorporated into the iBarcode framework.

Background
Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies in recent
years have resulted in an explosive use of comparative
DNA sequence analysis in biological sciences. DNA
sequence information has been used in a wide range of
applications and for addressing different biological questions from development to evolution and biodiversity. In
the early days of molecular biology a handful of sequence

analysis software applications existed, several of them
have been developed by researchers to address their
needs. In last decade or so, development of more robust
sequencing platforms, mainly as a result of human and
other genome projects, resulted in the introduction of
more powerful data analysis packages. Additionally,
advancements in computer technologies and applications
have been essential for a boom in bioinformatics. With

the widespread use of Internet, it soon became an important vehicle for sequence databases such as GenBank. In
addition, organizations such as the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the European
Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) as well as smaller initiatives
and even individual labs started offering some of their
services (i.e. search, access to data, analysis and visualization) through web-based portals.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S14

Here we introduce iBarcode.org, a web-based application
server that provides various visualization and analysis
tools for DNA barcoding data in a user-friendly environment. These tools have mainly been designed to enable
the analysis of large barcode-style data sets, although the
features can be used for the analysis of other sequence
data. iBarcode.org is free and does not require registration.

Results
The majority of tools and portals that have been developed for sequence data analysis have been directed
towards genome projects data, mainly because of the
overwhelming complexity and large size of genomes as
compared to sequence of a single gene. Genome browsers
and search tools are good examples. This expansion of
sequence information from genes to genomes, have also
influenced and been applied to biosystematics analysis.
For example, the field of phylogenomics [1] argues for the
use of genome sequences (either as a whole or several portions) to study evolutionary relationships.
In contrast to this move from genes to genomes, a relatively new approach, DNA barcoding, aims at developing
a species-specific sequence library for all eukaryotes, using
a small gene region, with the primary mission of enhancing biodiversity analysis [2]. DNA barocding is based on
two key principles of minimalism and standardization.
While an efficient identification library requires analyzing
maximal number of specimens in different taxonomic
groups, species-level identification can be achieved by
limiting the analysis to small fragments of genomes (i.e.
DNA barcodes). A 650 bp fragment of a mitochondrial
gene, cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1, cox1) has been proposed as the DNA barcode for animal species [3]. Several
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this CO1barcode system in groups such as fishes [4], mammals [5],
birds [6] and several arrays of insects [7,8]. While barcoding by using a single gene fragment has proven efficient
for most animals tested, it may be necessary to use 2–3
fragments to achieve species-level resolution in other
kingdoms of life.
Although DNA barcoding data – sequence information
attached to specimens from different species – has similarities to other biosystematics sequence data (i.e. phylogenetic and population genetics data) [9], new analysis tools
are required to facilitate efficient use of barcode information in biodiversity studies. One of the most distinctive
features of barcode datasets involves relatively large
number of barcode sequences (i.e. several thousands)
connected to collateral information (i.e. geographic, ecologic). The analysis and visualization of such large datasets have been challenging.

The current implementation of iBarcode.org (July 2008)
includes a sequence upload and management suite and
nine analysis and visualization tools. The sequence
upload and management suite enables input, selection,
verification, concatenation, and visualization of
sequences. The web server provides tools that are divided
into three categories. Here we introduce key features of
iBarcode.org and provide exemplar cases from barcode
data for each analysis and visualization module.
Sequence analysis
a. Haplotype variation
This tool identifies unique haplotypes for each species
and provides statistical information on haplotype frequency and nucleotide variation in a user-friendly table
format. A simple measure of number of nucleotide difference between sequences is used to calculate haplotype
variation across the sequences. Figure 1 demonstrates the
screen capture from output of the haplotype variation tool
for a set of primate species (partial data set from Hajibabaei et al. [10]). In addition to this table, a reduced dataset
containing unique haplotypes is produced in FASTA format. This dataset is stored for further use in other tools
(see below) or for download by the submitter.
b. Haplotype map (Barcode-HAPMAP)
This data visualization module provides a graphical view
of the nucleotide character variation in a barcode data set.
It allows the user to quickly pinpoint nucleotide positions
within the barcode sequence that account for barcode variation in a set of species. The tool takes a FASTA alignment
of barcode sequences (or the alignment of unique haplotypes created in the Haplotype Analysis tool from a given
barcode dataset) as input and highlights variable positions across the barcode sequence in an easy-to-read format. It also shows the nucleotide position for each
variable site (counting from 5' to 3') as well as the codon
positions they belong to. It is therefore important that the
FASTA file of the barcode sequences is in the correct reading frame. This tool works best for focused characterbased analysis of a limited number of taxa (i.e. in a species
complex or when dealing with cryptic species) as a complement to distance-based methods such as Neighbourjoining analysis [11]. The HTML output format generated
by this tool allows robust data transfer to other software
packages such as MS-Excel. Figure 2 is an exemplar Bar-

c. Tests of selection at different taxonomic levels
This module uses the popular ratio of non-synonymous
to synonymous substitutions (ω) [13] at various taxonomic levels. This ratio has been used for estimating the

degrees of selective pressure in molecular biosystematics.
The module uses the program yn00 from the PAML package [14,15] to calculate the ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions (ω) for all pairs within a set of
aligned sequences. It then calculates the average and
standard deviation of ω for all sequences pairs that belong
to the same species, belong to the same genus, or belong
to different genera. A final bar graph depicting these various values is then displayed (Figure 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S14

d. DNA barcode cloud visualization
This module takes the popular "word cloud" concept and
applies it to number of individuals of each species within
a given barcode dataset, producing a visually-appealing
means of seeing the relative abundance of species within
a dataset. These relative abundances are linearly scaled
between font sizes of 50 and 200 points. This feature also
provides cloud visualization for sequence divergence
within species and haplotype diversity in each species.
Each species represented in the cloud visualization output
can be selected to create a new subset dataset for further
analysis using other tools. Figure 4 provides an example of
a barcode cloud for a set of species of primates.
Genetic distance analysis
a. Between- vs. within-species variation graph
DNA barcoding is based on a simple premise: genetic variation between species exceeds that of within species. This
tool allows the user to visualize this principle in a given
barcode dataset. Specifically, for each species with 3 or
more individuals, this tool plots maximum Within Species Divergence (Max-WSD) against minimum Between
Species Divergence (Min-BSD) [7]. The input for this tool
is a genetic distance matrix (text format) produced either
internally (by calculating number of nucleotide differences between and within species) or by common
sequence analysis programs such as Mega [16]. Several
barcoding studies have used graphs of between- vs.
within-species variation. These graphs are considered as
one of the standard methods of visualizing barcode data
[i.e. [7]], as they allow the user to quickly see outliers that
may represent misannotated specimens or sequencing
errors.
Tree analysis
a. Organic trees
In Hajibabaei et al. [7], we pioneered a new visuallyappealing technique for drawing organic-looking phylogenetic trees. This method maximizes resolution for tips
of the tree (i.e. species), which are most important in barcode analysis. The process of building organic trees takes
several hours and therefore we have been offering the creation of such trees as an e-mail service.

Test of selection at different taxonomic levels

graphs representing the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions (ω) within species, within
genus, and between genera for two exemplar data sets of fish
[4] and bats [20].

b. Tree collapse
This tool uses bootstrap values in a phylogenetic tree as a
benchmark for visualizing statistical support of a given
barcode dataset [10]. This is done by collapsing all the
branches that are unsupported by a bootstrap cut-off
value that is specified by the user. Although short barcode
sequences are not strong phylogenetic markers at deep
levels, they are excellent for species-level divergences. A
high bootstrap cut-off (i.e. 100%) leads to collapsing
most of the branches deeper than species-level, but the
majority of the species-level branches are kept intact.

In the future, we plan to have an application programming interface (API) for our tools, allowing other developers to integrate our analyses into their own tools.

Conclusion
Similarly to several other branches of biology, biodiversity
science has increasingly been relying on DNA sequence
information. DNA barcoding, as a new global initiative
for biodiversity analysis, demands specialized bioinformatics tools and applications. iBarcode.org is a web-based
application server developed for visualization and analysis of DNA barcode data. The suite of simple but highly
customized tools in iBarcode.org allows the analysis and
visualization of barcode data at sequence, genetic distance, and phylogenetic tree levels. Several of these applications have already contributed to barcode publications.
iBarcode.org provides a web2.0 environment for developing and sharing tools for barcode data and sets the stage
for a new wave of community driven bioinformatics
applications.

data set. In each case the font size shows the relative value
for each species.

However, exceptionally closely related species may
require longer sequences to gain a very high bootstrap
support.
c. Tree tip colourization
This visualization tool uses a standard Newick format tree
and colourizes the branches leading to individuals of each
species (within-species distances) in red and the branches
leading to each unique species in blue. It provides a robust
method to visually compare different parts of a tree and
therefore helps pinpointing exceptional divergence levels
or regions of the tree that lack monophyly.

Server details
iBarcode.org is built on the Python-based web.py application framework [17]. Although most analyses are performed using Python itself, visualization and analysis are
accomplished via calls to the statistical language R [18],
the graphing package GraphViz [19], and the phylogenetic analysis package PAML [14]. We have intentionally
kept the interface light and clean so that it loads quickly
over low-bandwidth connections, and so that it is viewable and functional from text-based browsers (such as
Lynx) or from small handheld devices (cell phones or
PDAs).
