Abstract
Background: Secondary metabolites biosynthesized by polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal
peptide synthetase (NRPS) family of enzymes constitute several classes of therapeutically important
natural products like erythromycin, rapamycin, cyclosporine etc. In view of their relevance for natural
product based drug discovery, identification of novel secondary metabolite natural products by genome
mining has been an area of active research. A number of different tailoring enzymes catalyze a variety of
chemical modifications to the polyketide or nonribosomal peptide backbone of these secondary
metabolites to enhance their structural diversity. Therefore, development of powerful bioinformatics
methods for identification of these tailoring enzymes and assignment of their substrate specificity is crucial
for deciphering novel secondary metabolites by genome mining.
Results: In this work, we have carried out a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of methyltransferase
(MT) domains present in multi functional type I PKS and NRPS proteins encoded by PKS/NRPS gene
clusters having known secondary metabolite products. Based on the results of this analysis, we have
developed a novel knowledge based computational approach for detecting MT domains present in PKS and
NRPS megasynthases, delineating their correct boundaries and classifying them as N-MT, C-MT and O-MT
using profile HMMs. Analysis of proteins in nr database of NCBI using these class specific profiles has
revealed several interesting examples, namely, C-MT domains in NRPS modules, N-MT domains with
significant homology to C-MT proteins, and presence of NRPS/PKS MTs in association with other catalytic
domains. Our analysis of the chemical structures of the secondary metabolites and their site of methylation
suggested that a possible evolutionary basis for the presence of a novel class of N-MT domains with
significant homology to C-MT proteins could be the close resemblance of the chemical structures of the
acceptor substrates, as in the case of pyochelin and yersiniabactin. These two classes of MTs recognize
similar acceptor substrates, but transfer methyl groups to N and C positions on these substrates.
Conclusion: We have developed a novel knowledge based computational approach for identifying MT
domains present in type I PKS and NRPS multifunctional enzymes and predicting their site of methylation.
Analysis of nr database using this approach has revealed presence of several novel MT domains. Our
analysis has also given interesting insight into the evolutionary basis of the novel substrate specificities of
these MT proteins.

Background
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), polyketide
synthases (PKSs) and fatty acid synthases (FASs) employ a
common biosynthetic strategy to synthesize their metabolic products by stepwise condensation of simple amino
or carboxylic acid monomers. The core catalytic domains
involved in the biosynthesis of the polyketide/nonribosomal peptide/fatty acid backbone moieties are ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), dehydratase (DH),
enoylreductase (ER), ketoreductase (KR), acyl carrier protein (ACP), condensation (C), adenylation (A) and thiolation (T) [1,2]. Apart from these core catalytic domains, a
number of auxiliary functional domains, often called tailoring domains, introduce a variety of different chemical
modifications to the backbone moieties of these secondary metabolites to further increase their structural diversity. Bioinformatics analysis of various catalytic domains
present in NRPS and PKS proteins has been an area of
active research in recent years [3-8]. These studies [3-8]
have not only led to development of novel computational
methods for in silico identification of secondary metabolites by genome mining [9-16], they have also guided
rational reprogramming of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways to generate designed "natural products"
[12,17-20]. However, all these studies including our earlier work have concentrated on core catalytic domains and
no detailed bioinformatics analyses have been carried out
for important tailoring enzymes like, methyltransferases.
Methyltransferase (MT) domains present in NRPS and
PKS clusters constitute a major class of tailoring domains/
enzymes involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. They catalyze the transfer of methyl group from Sadenosylmethionine (SAM or AdoMet) to the carbon,
nitrogen or oxygen atoms at various positions on the
backbones of polyketides, nonribosomal peptides and
fatty acids and therefore have been classified as C-MT, NMT and O-MT respectively depending upon their site of
methylation. These enzymatic domains in general have a
bidomain structure, where the first subdomain contains
the binding site for methyl group donor, while the second
subdomain harbors the binding site for acceptor substrate
[21,22]. The presence of MT domains in multifunctional
NRPS and PKS proteins is generally inferred from chemical structure of the secondary metabolite products. There
are only few in vitro studies on enzymatic characterization
of NRPS/PKS MT domains [23-27]. A recent study on MT
domains from type II PKS biosynthetic pathways has
revealed interesting correlation between regioselectivity of
methylation and MT sequence [24]. However, no such
analysis has been carried out for MT domains present in
type I PKS or NRPS proteins. In contrast to type II PKS MTs
which are stand alone proteins, MT domains in type I PKS
and NRPS are present along with other catalytic domains
on a single polypeptide chain. Therefore, it has been diffi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/454

cult to decipher the correct length and domain boundaries
for MT domains in type I PKS or NRPS proteins. Various
studies have suggested that the size of N-MT domain is
typically 450 amino acids, while C-MT and O-MT are generally 300 amino acids long. A set of 3 conserved sequence
motifs has been identified in most MTs [28-30]. Mutational studies of N-MTs of peptide synthetases have
shown that these 3 motifs are essential for the catalysis
[31]. The knowledge of these MT sequence motifs and the
expected spacing between them is often used for discerning presence of MT domains in multifunctional NRPS and
PKS proteins. However, because of the high degree of
sequence divergence, delineating the correct boundary of
these proteins is quite often a difficult task. In our earlier
study, we attempted to identify MT domains in various
NRPS/PKS gene clusters based on pairwise alignment with
MT domain from actinomycin cluster [32]. However, this
domain identification protocol failed to detect 23 out of
32 MT domains. The 23 unidentified MT domains
included the three groups of MTs (C-, O- and N-MTs), for
which proper templates were not available. The general
purpose domain identification tools like CDD-search can
identify MT domains in NRPS and PKS proteins, but can
not predict the domain boundaries accurately and they
also fail to classify them as C-MT, N-MT and O-MT. Such
classification is crucial for prediction of chemical structures of secondary metabolites. The knowledge of substrate specificity and domain boundaries of MT domains
is also important for rational design of novel secondary
metabolites by introduction of heterologous MT
domains.
In this manuscript, we have carried out a systematic analysis of the sequence/structural features of MT domains
present in various experimentally characterized NRPS and
type I PKS clusters having known metabolic products.
Since crystal structures are available for many stand alone
small molecule methyltransferases from several microbial
organisms, we have carried out threading analysis for the
experimentally characterized MT domains from NRPS and
PKS biosynthetic pathways. The threading analysis has
helped in elucidating the putative three dimensional
structure adopted by MT domains and based on the alignment of MT containing sequences on the structural fold of
MT domain it has been possible to delineate the correct
boundaries for NRPS/PKS MT domains. Our threading
analysis has also given novel insight into the structural
features of linker sequences flanking the MT domains in
NRPS and PKS proteins. Using the curated sequences of
these MTs, we have carried out detailed phylogenetic analysis to investigate whether these catalytic domains cluster
as per their specificity for site of methylation i.e. C-MT, NMT and O-MT. Based on this analysis, we have identified
suitable template sequences of C-MT, N-MT and O-MT
domains from representative clusters, which can be used

to identify MT domains in uncharacterized NRPS/PKS
proteins. We have also developed Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) profiles which can identify MT domains in a
query sequence and classify them as N-MT, C-MT and OMT. Using these HMM profiles, we have analyzed nonredundant protein sequence database of NCBI to identify
other multifunctional enzymes containing C-MT, N-MT
and O-MT domains.

Results
In this study, we have carried out a number of different
bioinformatics analyses on MT domains present in type I
PKS and NRPS proteins, to correlate the sequence of these
MT domains to their substrate specificity i.e. the site of
methylation. Figure 1 gives a schematic overview of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/454

various different analyses carried out and the type of
results obtained from them, while the results are discussed in detail in the following sections.
The chemical structures of the secondary metabolites produced by various PKS, NRPS and hybrid NRPS/PKS clusters cataloged in NRPS-PKS web resource were analyzed
carefully to identify methyl substitutions on polyketide or
nonribosomal peptide backbones. The presence of methyl
substitutions on nitrogen and oxygen atoms indicated
presence of N-MT or O-MT domains in the proteins
encoded by these gene clusters. However, in absence of
MT domains methyl substitutions on carbons in a ketide
group can also result from selection of methylmalonate
extender groups by the AT domains of PKS proteins.

Therefore, for correctly inferring presence of C-MT
domains in a PKS protein, the substrate specificity of the
corresponding AT domain was also checked. Table 1 lists
various ORFs harboring the MT domains, their GenBank
accession number and the type or substrate specificity of
MT domain as deduced from the chemical structure of the
metabolite. As can be seen, the data set consisted of 20 CMT, 19 O-MT and 22 N-MT domains from 27 different
NRPS/PKS clusters. Figure 2 shows the chemical structures
of 5 representative secondary metabolites highlighting the
methyl groups added by C-MT, N-MT and O-MT domains,
while chemical structures of the remaining 22 secondary
metabolites are shown in Additional file 1. Each of the
ORFs listed in Table 1 were analyzed by NRPS-PKS search
tool as well as CDD server of NCBI. NRPS-PKS search tool,
which used a single MT domain from actinomycin cluster
as template, could identify only 26 MT domains out of a
total of 61. Even though the latest version of CDD server
could identify 55 out of these 61 MT domains, the lengths
of the MT domains detected by both these programs were
notably shorter than the typical length of these domains.
These programs also failed to distinguish between C-MT,
N-MT and O-MT domains. Additional file 2 shows the
length of each MT containing sequence stretch and other
catalytic domains flanking this region. As can be seen, all
N-MT domains are present in NRPS clusters only as C-AMT-T modules and typically a 400 amino acid sequence
stretch containing this domain is inserted in the adenylation domain between the conserved motifs A8 and A9 of
adenylation domains and hence alignment of these N-MT
containing A domains with regular A domains produces a
split alignment (Figure 3). All stand alone O-MT containing sequences were typically 300 to 400 amino acids long,
while the amino acid stretches containing other O-MT
and C-MT domains present in type I PKS proteins were
600 to 700 amino acids long. The O-MT and C-MT
domains in PKS proteins were present in four different
types of modules i.e. KS-AT-MT-ACP, KS-AT-MT-KR-ACP,
KS-AT-DH-MT-KR-ACP and KS-AT-DH-MT-ER-KR-ACP.
Only in case of leinamycin gene cluster, which has transAT domains, the MT domain is present as KS-DH-KRACP-MT-ACP. There were only two examples where MT
domain was adjacent to an aminotransferase (AMT)
domain in a hybrid NRPS/PKS system. In these cases MTAMT stretch was inserted between a PKS and a NRPS module. It appears that MT domains in type I PKS proteins are
present in AT-KR, DH-ER or DH-KR linker regions which
are typically more than 200 amino acids long. Hence,
length of the flanking linker region could be the reason for
the larger length of these MT containing sequence
stretches. Therefore, we decided to carry out various structure based sequences analysis for representative MT containing stretches of each category to delineate the exact
domain boundaries for MT domains.

Threading analysis of MT domains
Since domain boundaries can be identified correctly by
aligning the sequence of multi domain proteins with the
3D structures of the corresponding single domain proteins, we attempted to identify other proteins in PDB
which are structurally similar to these MT domains of
PKS/NRPS enzymes. However, the lack of crystal structures for any MT domains from PKS/NRPS biosynthetic
pathway and high degree of sequence divergence in this
enzyme family prompted us to use threading or fold recognition approach. These tools can potentially reveal
structural similarity in absence of high degree of similarity
in sequences. GenTHREADER and PHYRE fold prediction
servers were used for threading analysis. As discussed in
the methods section, the MT sequence stretch identified
by CDD or NRPS-PKS along with their flanking linkers
was threaded on various structural folds in PDB. In cases
where chemical structure of metabolite indicated presence
of MT domains but no MT domain was detected by these
programs, all linker stretches having unusual length were
analyzed by both these fold recognition servers.

Table 2 shows the results of threading analysis for representative members of these MT containing sequences. The
fold prediction hits with highest level of statistical significance corresponding to p-value lower than 0.0001 were
labeled as CERTAIN by the GenTHREADER server, while
hits having p-value between 0.0001 and 0.001 are labeled
as HIGH. We considered only those matches which are
labeled as CERTAIN or HIGH by GenTHREADER or have
precision of more than 95% in case of fold prediction by
PHYRE. As can be seen, all the 18 sequences matched with
structure of MT proteins in PDB. This suggests that, the MT
domains present in NRPS/PKS proteins would adopt a
fold similar to the small molecule methyltransferase in
other organisms. The N-MT domains present in our data
set aligned not only with N-MT structures, but also with CMT and O-MT structures. Similar was the case for C-MT
and O-MT domains in our data set. Analysis of their alignment scores did not show any preference for structural
matches from the same functional category. Therefore, the
structures which aligned consistently with all the
sequences by both servers and had maximum sequence
identity and alignment length with the query sequences
were chosen as structural templates for MT domains of
NRPS/PKS proteins. The structure of histamine N-MT
(PDB code 1VLM; 207 residues) and a hypothetical protein from M. tuberculosis (PDB code 1VL5; 230 residues)
showed alignment with most C-MT, O-MT and N-MT by
both the fold prediction servers. However, taking into
consideration the alignment length and the length of the
query sequence, for further analysis 1VLM was selected as
template for C-MT and O-MT domains, while 1VL5 was
selected as structural template for N-MT domains. These
results suggest that, MT domains present in type I PKS and

List of ORFs containing methyltransferase domains in various experimentally characterized NRPS/PKS gene clusters. Table also lists the number and
type of MT domains in each of the ORFs and results from PFAM analysis using CDD search.

NRPS proteins are likely to be around 200 amino acids
long.
It may be noted that the small molecule MT structures
present in PDB show significant variation in their length
and in case of some of these sequences alignments were
found with MT structures having significant difference in

length. For example, 3 of the C-MT domains and 1 N-MT
domain in our data set aligned with aclacinomycin-10hydroxylase (PDB code 1QZZ; 340 residues) [33] and histamine N-MT (PDB code 1VLM; 207 residues). The huge
length difference between these two MT structures made
the choice of correct structural template a difficult task.
1QZZ aligns with the beginning of the MT containing

alignments. Figures 5, 6 and 7 show the structure guided
multiple alignment of representative N-MT, C-MT and OMT sequences with the structural template 1VLM. As can
be seen from Figure 5, the N-MT sequences have the conserved motifs I, II/Y, IV and V in N-MTs. Similarly motifs
I, motif I-post, II and III are present in the C-MT and OMT sequences (Figures 6 &7). Thus all the motifs
[28,30,31] identified in earlier analysis of small molecule
methyltransferase sequences were found to be conserved
in the multiple sequence alignments of C-, O- and N-MT
domains identified by our threading analysis. The average
percent identity among the C-, O- and N-MT domains was
found to be 31, 28 and 17% respectively.

sequence stretch, while in the alignment of the same
sequences with 1VLM, the length of the linker preceding
the MT domain ranges from 50 to even 200 residues (Figure 4). However, careful manual analysis of the alignments as well as the corresponding structural templates
indicated that, the crystal structure 1QZZ consists of a predominantly α-helical N-terminal domain which is
involved in dimerization and a C-terminal SAM binding
domain typical of methyltransferases. On the other hand,
the crystal structure 1VLM contains the SAM dependent
MT domain alone. The overlapping region of both the
alignments correspond to the catalytic domain of methyltransferase, while the linker sequences preceding the MT
catalytic domain showed alignment with additional
dimerization domains, if present in the structural template. Earlier studies on structural analysis of small molecule methyltransferases have suggested that, these
enzymes have a conserved SAM-MT fold consisting of
alternating β strands and α helices [22]. Earlier bioinformatics analysis [28,30,31] of MT domains has also
revealed that, despite high divergence in primary
sequence, certain conserved sequence motifs are present
in all SAM dependent methyltransferases. Therefore, we
wanted to examine whether the conserved secondary
structural elements and sequence motifs responsible for
catalytic activity, substrate specificity and cofactor binding
are conserved in the MT domains identified by threading

The threading analysis also showed statistically significant
matches with proteins other than methyltransferases.
Such matches were specifically seen for MT containing
sequences which were longer in length due to the presence
of large flanking linker sequences. As can be seen from
table 2 and figure 4, the N-terminal region of MT containing sequence from bleomycin showed an alignment (Figure 8a) with the last 60 amino acids of the KS-AT didomain structure from erythromycin PKS [34]. This
stretch corresponds to the last helix of the AT domain and
a segment of the AT-DH linker region (Figure 4). The Cterminal 200 amino acid stretch of the MT containing
sequence from bleomycin [35], nodularin and melithiazol also showed highly significant alignments (Figure 8b)
with the structural subdomain (Figure 4) of the recently
elucidated structure of KR from erythromycin PKS. These
results suggest that, in type I PKS proteins, the linker
sequences preceding the MT domain i.e. AT-MT linkers are
homologous to the AT-DH linkers and MT-KR linker
regions are likely to adopt a short chain reductase (SCR)
fold and would constitute the structural half of the KR
domain as demonstrated in erythromycin PKS. Thus MT
catalytic domain is likely to be 200 amino acids only.
Development of a computational protocol for identifying
MT domains and their classification as C-MT, O-MT and
N-MT
The domain boundaries were thus identified with 1VLM
(for C- and O-MT) and 1VL5 (for N-MT) as templates and
the regions which aligned with these templates were
extracted from the 61 MT domain sequences. They represented the curated MT domains with correct boundary. A
set of 42 MT domains out of these 60 sequences were used
as test set to check if MT domains can be correctly classified by pairwise alignment with these 18 template
sequences. Each of the 42 MT domains was queried
against 18 MT templates to find the number of MT
domains identified by these templates. The query MT
domain was classified as C-MT, O-MT or N-MT depending
on the highest scoring match from the template set. The
results obtained by the pairwise comparison of 60 query

Column 1 gives the unique name assigned to each MT containing sequence stretch, while the second column indicates their length. Column 3–13
lists the PDB IDs for the structures which show alignment with these sequences in fold recognition analysis using GenTHREADER and PHYRE
servers. Results from GenTHREADER corresponding to confidence level CERTAIN and HIGH are labeled as C and H respectively. Similarly,
PHYRE results corresponding to precision level 100% and 95% are labeled as 100 and 95 respectively in curly braces. (-) indicates the absence of
that particular fold.

sequences with the 18 template sequences indicated that
C-MT templates were able to identify all other C-MT
sequences. However, there were a few O- and N-MTs,
which were also recognized by these C-MT templates. Specifically, 2 MT sequences in onnamide gene cluster (onnB
and onnI) showed very high similarity to C-MT while they
are functionally annotated as O-MTs by the authors who
reported experimental characterization of this gene cluster
[36]. These 2 O-MTs also have motif I as ExGxG which is
characteristic of C-MTs. An N-MT from pyochelin synthetase (pchF) also exhibited considerable similarity to
several C-MTs and the two onnamide O-MTs. In view of
this apparent anomaly in sequence similarity of these proteins, their functional assignment needs to be examined
carefully. In the ORF apdB of anabaenopeptilide gene
cluster, there are two MT-domains wherein the first one is
entirely different from all the other MT sequences and
does not show similarity with any other MT sequence. A
dendrogram (Figure 9) of all the 60 MT sequences also
illustrates the same pattern of results as obtained by these
pairwise alignments. The two onnamide O-MTs in onnB
and onnI genes and the N-MTs in pyochelin and anabaenopeptilide show clustering with C-methyltransferases. A stand alone O-MT in stigmatellin (stiK) is
sequentially different from other O-methyltransferases,
which was observed from the pairwise alignment results

and is evident from the dendrogram. Thus it can be concluded from the above analysis that these 18 sequences
can be used as templates to identify MT-domains in any
given query sequence by pairwise alignment. These new
MT templates were included in the current version of
NRPS-PKS program for correct identification of various
types of MT domains.
Profile HMMs of C-, O- and N-methyltransferases
An alternative approach to detect MT domains in a new
sequence is to query that sequence against a database of
HMM profiles. Individual profiles were built for C-MT, OMT and N-MTs using the curated sequences. These profiles
were then used to make a HMM profile database for MT
domains. The set of 61 C-MT, O-MT and N-MT sequences
from experimentally characterized NRPS/PKS clusters
were queried against this HMM database and the location
of the MT-domain and their class was predicted in these
sequences. Table 3 lists the score and E-value for alignment of 18 representative MT sequences with the HMM
profiles of N-MT, C-MT and O-MT domains. As can be
seen from Table 3, most C-MT sequences show statistically significant alignment with O-MT profiles and vice
versa. On the other hand, only the N-MT sequences from
pyochelin aligned with the N-MT as well as C-MT profiles
unlike the other N-MT sequences which aligned with N-

MT profile alone. This finding is consistent with results
from pairwise sequence alignment discussed in the previous section.
In order to test the predictive ability of our MT HMM profiles further, the recent version of the nr database of NCBI
was also searched using these profiles to identify putative
NRPS/PKS MT domains in various proteins. The
sequences which matched with these profiles were
grouped as C-MT, O-MT and N-MT containing sequences
based on highest scoring profile match. The complete
domain architecture of these MT containing proteins were
also analyzed in details. The nr database search identified
4197 stand alone MT proteins and 684 multifunctional
proteins containing MT domains. Out of the 4197 stand

alone MT proteins, 3977 were O-MT proteins. In contrast
to the very large number of stand alone O-MT proteins,
there were only 155 stand alone C-MT and 55 stand alone
N-MT proteins. Even though experimentally characterized
NRPS/PKS biosynthetic pathways have a relatively larger
number of stand alone O-MT proteins compared to stand
alone C-MT or N-MT domains, it is not apparent whether
all these stand alone O-MT proteins identified by our profile search would indeed be associated with secondary
metabolite biosynthesis. Analysis of domain architectures
in multifunctional proteins containing MT domains
revealed several interesting results. These MT containing
multifunctional proteins can be divided into four major
groups. They are proteins containing MT domains along
with core PKS domains, core NRPS domains, PKS as well

bosomal peptide products are N-methylated, the presence
of such a large number of C-MT domains as C-A-CMT-T
modules was surprising. Similarly, the hybrid NRPS/PKS

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/454

set also had 121 proteins containing C-MT domains as
compared to only 4 proteins containing N-MT domains
(Figure 10c). In fact 17 of these C-MT domains in hybrid
NRPS/PKS proteins were present next to condensation
domains of NRPS as C-CMT-PCP modules, while one
would a priori expect N-MT domains in such modules
instead of C-MT domains. In view of this finding of anomalously large number of NRPS modules containing C-MT
domains in NRPS and hybrid NRPS/PKS proteins, we
decided to analyze these proteins by pairwise alignment
with 18 representative MT templates from known NRPS/
PKS biosynthetic pathways. Interestingly the N-MT
domain of pyochelin synthase was found to be closest
match for 23 out of the 44 C-MT containing NRPS proteins identified by profile search. Most of these 23 NRPS
proteins showed very high percentage identity with pyochelin synthase N-MT ranging from 27% to 69%. Thus it
is very much likely that, these 23 NRPS proteins indeed
contain pyochelin type N-MT domains which are different
from other N-MT domains. They were annotated by profile approach as C-MTs, because N-MT domain of pyochelin synthase shows homology to C-MTs and has
comparable scores with C-MT as well as N-MT profiles
(Table 3). Similarly, a C-MT domain from yersiniabactin
synthase was found to be the closest homolog of C-MTs
found in NRPS modules of hybrid NRPS/PKS proteins
and the sequence similarity was also very high. This MT
domain in yersiniabactin synthase catalyzes C-methylation (Figure 2), but is present as C-CMT-PCP module similar to the domain organization found in C-MT containing
hybrid NRPS/PKS proteins found by our profile search.
This suggests that our profile search has genuinely identified yersiniabactin type novel C-MT domains embedded
in NRPS modules. In case of 20 other NRPS proteins
which showed matches with C-MT profiles, the C-MT
domains from yersiniabactin, leinamycin and nodularin
were found to be closest match. Table 4 shows the domain
organization predicted for each of them by HMM profiles,
and the percentage identity and similarity with closest
matching MT domain in our 18 representative templates
set. Even though the closest homolog approach also
detects C-MT domains in these proteins in agreement with
results from HMM approach, in view of the relatively low
sequence identity with C-MTs from known NRPS/PKS
biosynthetic pathways, it is not clear if these domains are
likely to be genuine C-MT domains as in yersiniabactin
synthase or a different class of N-MT domains which lack
homology to known N-MT domains in our data set. Thus
our analysis of nr database has revealed presence of many
C-MT domains in NRPS modules as in yersiniabactin. It
has also identified several pyochelin type N-MT domains
which often show higher homology to C-MT profiles.
None of these proteins are currently experimentally characterized. Experimental characterization of some of these
MT domains would help in understanding how MT

differ by the site of methylation. In view of the similarity
in the structure of the acceptor substrate, pyochelin type
N-MT domains show homology to C-MT proteins. It may
be interesting to note that, in a recent study involving MTs
from type II PKS pathways, Hertweck and coworkers [24]
have observed that, these type II MTs cluster according to
the site of methylation not necessarily as C-MTs, O-MTs
and N-MTs. Based on this observation, they have proposed that for polyketide alkylation, regioselectivity is
more dominant than the type of nucleophile (C-, O- or N) that is being alkylated. Thus the C-MT domains found in
NRPS modules by our profile search could indeed be due
to such correlation between sequence of type I MTs and
their regioselectivity. These observations have interesting
implications of prediction of chemical structures of
metabolites by genome mining.

The analysis of MT containing proteins in nr database also
revealed the co-occurrence of NRPS/PKS type MT domains
with several other catalytic domains apart from core PKS
and NRPS domains (Figure 10d). However, in most cases
these proteins had O-MT domains and there were relatively few C-MT and N-MT domains. Table 5 shows
domain organization for representative proteins from
each category and also lists the number of such proteins
identified by our HMM profile search. As can be seen, the
O-MT domains are present along with a variety of catalytic
domains which do not belong to core NRPS or PKS family. Interestingly 19 out of the 61 examples correspond to
co-occurrence with glycosyltransferase domains. Since
glycosyltransferases are a major class of tailoring enzymes
involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, many of
these proteins might indeed be associated with novel PKS/

List of representative protein sequences from nr database which contain C-MT, N-MT or O-MT domains in combination with functional domains
other than core PKS or NRPS domains. Gene identifier number, domain organization and organism names are listed in columns 1, 2 and 4
respectively, while column 3 lists total number of proteins having similar domain organization.

NRPS biosynthetic pathways [39,40]. Apart from glycosyltransferases, the other functional domains which occur
with O-MT are oxidases, hydroxylases, tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR), phosphodiasterases, DNA binding helixturn helix proteins etc. It would be necessary to further
analyze each of these proteins in details to understand
their biochemical function. In contrast to O-MTs, the NMT and C-MT domains are present in multifunctional
enzymes which contain other catalytic domains in addition to PKS and NRPS domains. Some of the interesting
examples are NRPS/PKS proteins containing chalcone
synthase or carnitine acyltransferase domains along with
C-MT domains. Similarly, N-MT domains are present
along with domains associated with streptococcal surface
antigen, bacterial luciferase, phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP)
utilizing enzyme and ketopantoate reductase (ApbA) etc.
Thus these results give valuable clues about organisms
which can potentially make secondary metabolites with a
variety of structural modifications by diverse types of tai-

loring enzymes. Some of these proteins would be interesting targets for detailed experimental investigation.

Discussions
We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the
sequence and structural features of the MT domains
present in multi functional proteins encoded by various
experimentally characterized NRPS, PKS and hybrid
NRPS/PKS gene clusters with known secondary metabolite products. Even though presence of methyltransferase
domains in NRPS and PKS family of megasynthases have
been inferred from methylation pattern of the chemical
structure of the secondary metabolite product, earlier
studies have not defined the correct domain boundaries.
Threading analysis of the MT containing sequence
stretches suggest 1VLM and 1VL5 as possible structural
templates for NRPS/PKS MT domains. Based on the alignment with these structural templates, we identify the correct boundaries and predict that, the general length of MT

domains will be in the range of 200–220 residues. Our
threading analysis also reveals interesting homology
between AT-MT and AT-DH linkers. Similarly, large
sequence stretches C-terminus to the C-MT domains of
PKS proteins are found to have homology with structural
half of KR domains. These results not only explain the
large variation in the length of the MT containing
sequence stretch, they can also provide valuable clues for
design of domain swapping experiments.
The curated sequences of these MT domains were further
analyzed. From the MT sequences of correct length, a representative set of 18 MT domains covering the entire range
of sequence divergence were chosen. A novel protocol for
identification of MT domains by pairwise alignment and
their classification as N-MT, C-MT and O-MT was developed using these 18 MTs as multiple templates. This MT
domain identification protocol has been implemented in
the current version of the program NRPS-PKS. Using this
approach C-MT domains were annotated in the PKS proteins of Dictyostelium discoideum in a recent work [41].
The MT sequences with correct domain boundaries were
also used to build profile HMMs for O-MT, C-MT and NMT domains. Using these HMM profiles searches were
carried out in the nr database of NCBI for identifying various other proteins containing C-MT, O-MT and N-MT
domains. It is interesting to note that, apart from core PKS
and NRPS domains, these secondary metabolite biosynthetic MT domains are also associated with other important catalytic domains like glycosyltransferase, oxidases,
hydroxylases, phosphodiesterases and reductases. These
proteins could be interesting targets for experimental
characterization. Our analysis also surprisingly revealed
the presence of a large number C-MT domains in NRPS
modules adjacent to condensation (C) and adenylation
(A) domains. These predicted C-MT domains can be classified into two groups. One group of C-MT domains
showed high homology to N-MT domain of pyochelin
synthase, which is different from typical N-MT domains
present in NRPS modules. Unlike typical N-MT domains
of NRPS proteins, this shows homology to C-MT domains
but catalyzes transfer of methyl group to nitrogen. This
group could indeed be pyochelin type N-MT domains, but
are mis-classified as C-MT due to their homology with CMT proteins and under representation of pyochelin type
N-MT in our training data set. The closest homolog of the
other group of C-MT domains present in NRPS modules
is the C-MT domain of yersiniabactin synthase, which is
present adjacent to a condensation domain of NRPS, but
is indeed a C-MT. However, in view of the low homology
between the C-MT from yersiniabactin and this second
group of predicted C-MTs, it is difficult to predict whether
they are yersiniabactin or pyochelin type MTs. A close
examination of the chemical structures of the yersiniabac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/454

tin and pyochelin provides an evolutionary basis for the
presence of pyochelin type N-MT domains having homology with C-MT proteins. As can be seen from Figure 2, an
identical five membered ring is the acceptor moiety for
these two classes of MTs, while pyochelin N-MT methylates at the N position of the ring, the yersiniabactin C-MT
methylates the adjacent C position. It may be interesting
to note that such correlation between regioselectivity of
the site of methylation and MT sequence have also been
reported earlier by Hertweck and coworkers [24] for MTs
in type II PKS biosynthetic pathways. Experimental characterization of proteins identified by our analysis would
help in building more specific profiles for these novel MT
domains.

Conclusion
We have carried out a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of methyltransferase (MT) domains present in PKS/
NRPS clusters having known secondary metabolite products. Based on the site of methylation of these known secondary metabolites, the MT domains have been grouped
as N-MT, C-MT and O-MT proteins and sequence/structural features have been analyzed in detail for each group.
Based on the results of this analysis, we have developed a
novel knowledge based computational approach for
detecting MT domains present in PKS and NRPS megasynthases, delineating their correct boundaries and classifying them as N-MT, C-MT and O-MT using profile HMMs.
Analysis of proteins in nr database of NCBI using these
class specific profiles has revealed several interesting
examples of MT domains with novel substrate specificities. Our analysis has also given interesting insight into
the evolutionary basis of the novel substrate specificities
of these MT proteins. These results have interesting implications for identification of novel secondary metabolites
by genome mining and also rational design of novel natural products by biosynthetic engineering.

Methods
For various PKS/NRPS clusters catalogued in NRPSDB [5],
PKSDB [4] and ITERDB [5], the multi functional proteins
containing MT domains were identified based on comparison of chemical structure of the metabolic products with
the domain organization in the proteins of the corresponding biosynthetic clusters. The PKS/NRPS clusters in
which the MT domains were found included actinomycin
[32], metithiazol A [42], pyochelin [37], yersiniabactin
[38], stigmatellin [43], anabaenopeptilide [44], enniatin
[31], leinamycin [45], microcystin [46], jamaicamide A
[47], complestatin [48], bleomycin [35], epothilone [49],
myxothiazol [50], nodularin [51], pristinamycin [52],
thaxtomin [53], tubulysin [54], onnamide [36], pederin
[36], barbamide [55], cyclosporine [56], lovastatin [57],
compactin [58], fumonisin [59], erythromycin [60] and
equisetin [61]. The various MT containing multi func-

tional proteins found in these PKS/NRPS clusters were
analyzed by NRPS-PKS web server [5] as well as CDD [62]
search. Both NRPS-PKS and CDD often failed to detect
full length MT domains due to lack of homology over the
complete length. The sequence stretch identified by these
programs along with their flanking linkers was threaded
on various structural folds in PDB using GenTHREADER
[63] and PHYRE fold recognition servers [64]. In cases
where chemical structure of metabolites indicated presence of MT domains but no MT domain was detected by
these programs, all linker stretches having unusual length
were analyzed by GenTHREADER. It is known that, in
many NRPS clusters, N-MT domain is inserted between A8 and A-9 conserved signature motifs of the adenylation
domain. Therefore, if an adenylation domain produced
two discrete regions of local alignments with a regular A
domain, the unaligned stretch was analyzed by threading
method for possible presence of MT domains. Apart from
integrated MT domains present in multidomain proteins,
8 stand alone O-MT present in NRPS or PKS clusters were
also analyzed by GenTHREADER.
In order to choose a minimal set of templates representing
the entire range of sequence diversity, every sequence was
compared with every other sequence using BLAST program [65]. Based on these alignments, sequences with
similarity above 50% and alignment length greater than
90% were grouped together. A representative sequence
was selected from each group and finally 18 sequences
were selected as templates for identification of MT
domains by pairwise alignment. These 18 templates
included five C-MT, five N-MT and eight O-MT sequences.
The sequence to structure alignments obtained from GenTHREADER were sorted according to their threading score
and the top-ranking hits were selected as possible structural templates. The boundaries of the predicted domains
were obtained from the aligned region between the query
and the crystal structure. The sequences were then classified into three groups as N-MT, C-MT and O-MTs by correlating with the structure of the metabolic product. The
curated sequences of the three classes were taken and MSA
was performed using ClustalW2 [66] and ESPript [67]
software. MSA was used to study the similarity of the three
classes of MT sequences and also find the pattern of conservation of the motifs among these sequences. A phylogenetic tree was obtained from multiple sequence
alignment using iTOL [68]. Bootstrapping was performed
1000 times to obtain support values for each node. All significant bootstrapping values (more than 500) are shown
in figure 7. A local version of HMMER 2.3.2 package was
used to derive profile HMMs for each class of MT
domains. These profiles were used to search the nr database (non-redundant database) of NCBI for identifying
NRPS/PKS family of C-MT, N-MT and O-MT domains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/454

present in various proteins. The proteins showing matches
with these HMM profiles were searched locally using
Pfam – A database release 22.0 [69] at E-value cut off of
10-6 for identifying other catalytic domains associated
with C-MT, N-MT and O-MT.
