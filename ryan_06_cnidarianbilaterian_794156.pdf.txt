<p>The first of the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor
Homeoboxes near-complete set of homeodomains from a non-bilaterian animal is described.</p>

Results: Phylogenetic analyses were performed on 130 homeodomains from the sequenced
genome of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis along with 228 homeodomains from human and
97 homeodomains from Drosophila. The Nematostella homeodomains appear to be distributed
among established homeodomain classes in the following fashion: 72 ANTP class; one HNF class;
four LIM class; five POU class; 33 PRD class; five SINE class; and six TALE class. For four of the
Nematostella homeodomains, there is disagreement between neighbor-joining and Bayesian trees
regarding their class membership. A putative Nematostella CUT class gene is also identified.

Conclusion: The homeodomain superclass underwent extensive radiations prior to the
evolutionary split between Cnidaria and Bilateria. Fifty-six homeodomain families found in human
and/or fruit fly are also found in Nematostella, though seventeen families shared by human and fly
appear absent in Nematostella. Homeodomain loss is also apparent in the bilaterian taxa: eight
homeodomain families shared by Drosophila and Nematostella appear absent from human
(CG13424, EMXLX, HOMEOBRAIN, MSXLX, NK7, REPO, ROUGH, and UNC4), and six
homeodomain families shared by human and Nematostella appear absent from fruit fly (ALX,
DMBX, DUX, HNF, POU1, and VAX).

Background: Homeodomain transcription factors are key components in the developmental
toolkits of animals. While this gene superclass predates the evolutionary split between animals,
plants, and fungi, many homeobox genes appear unique to animals. The origin of particular
homeobox genes may, therefore, be associated with the evolution of particular animal traits. Here
we report the first near-complete set of homeodomains from a basal (diploblastic) animal.

Phylogenetic relationships among major metazoan lineages
Phylogenetic relationships among major metazoan lineages. The topology of the tree is consistent with several recent molecular phylogenetic analyses
[100-106]. Estimated divergence times for Cnidaria versus Bilateria, protostomes versus deuterostomes, and lophotrochozoans versus ecdysozoans are
indicated in the white boxes [18]. The origin of the homeobox gene superclass must have predated the split between animals, plants, and fungi.

Background

Homeobox genes constitute an ancient superclass of regulatory genes with diverse developmental functions [1]. The
homeobox, which encodes a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding
motif known as the homeodomain, originated prior to the
evolutionary split between plants, fungi, and metazoans [2].
The homeodomain is commonly 60 amino acids in length,
though recognizable homeodomains may be as long as 97 or
as short as 54 amino acids (reviewed in [3]).
Based on phylogenetic analyses and chromosomal mapping
studies, animal homeodomains can be divided among ten distinct classes: ANTP, CUT, HNF, LIM, POU, PRD, PROS,
SINE, TALE, and ZF [3-16]. The ANTP and PRD classes are
substantially larger than the other classes, and these two
classes are thought to be sister clades [5,7]. Within the ANTP
class, there is evidence for a monophyletic subclass comprising Hox-related genes [4,7]. The PRD class can be divided

into subclasses based on the amino acid present at position 50
of the homeodomain (Q50, K50, or S50), but these subclasses
do no not appear to represent monophyletic groups [5,7]. The
remaining eight homeodomain classes are significantly
smaller than the ANTP and PRD classes, and they are thought
to have emerged as a series of lineages basal to an ANTP-PRD
clade [6]. To this point, the HNF class has only been reported
from vertebrates [6]. Structural and functional properties of
the homeodomain appear largely conserved within these
homeodomain classes [4]. The homeodomain sequences
encoded by orthologous homeobox genes are often so highly
conserved that orthology between protostomes and deuterostomes, and even between bilaterians and non-bilaterians, is
readily apparent [17].
The ANTP, PRD, CUT, LIM, POU, PROS, SINE, TALE, and
ZF classes are known from both protostome and deuterostome metazoans [3]. Therefore, we can trace their origins to

Hypothetical scenariospage) evolution and diversification of homeodomain classes relative to the cnidarian-bilaterian divergence

Hypothetical scenarios for the evolution and diversification of homeodomain classes relative to the cnidarian-bilaterian divergence. The timing of the
cnidarian-bilaterian divergence is indicated by an arrow and a dashed vertical line. Cnidarian homeobox genes are indicated by red lines. Protostome (for
example, Drosophila) homeobox genes are indicated by green lines. Deuterostome (for example, human) homeobox genes are indicated by blue lines. (a)
Cnidaria diverges from Bilateria prior to origin of the major homeodomain classes (ANTP, PRD, LIM, POU, SINE, TALE). (b) Cnidaria diverges from
Bilateria after the origin of homeodomain classes but before their diversification. (c) Cnidaria diverges from Bilateria after the diversification of homeobox

the protostome-deuterostome ancestor, which a recent estimate places at some 579 to 700 million years ago (Figure 1)
[18]. Identification of these homeobox classes in outgroup
taxa would indicate even greater antiquity. For example,
molecular clock estimates based on maximum likelihood and
minimum evolution suggest that the cnidarian-bilaterian
divergence predated the protostome-deuterostome divergence by 25 to 48 million years [18].
Establishing the antiquity of homeobox genes is critical to
understanding the role of these genes in metazoan evolution.
The functional diversification of homeobox genes, by gene
duplication and divergence, or by cis-regulatory evolution,
has been touted as an important mechanism in the evolution
of diverse body plans and organs in bilaterian metazoans
[6,19-25]. The Cnidaria is the likely sister group of the Bilateria [26,27], and since their divergence from a common ancestor, these two lineages have undergone very different
evolutionary trajectories (Figure 1). The bilaterian ancestor
has spawned over 30 distinct phyla comprising more than
one million extant species; the cnidarian ancestor has
spawned some 10,000 extant species, all comfortably housed
in a single phylum [28]. The maximum complexity and morphological diversity of cnidarian body plans (for example, sea
anemones, sea pens, corals, hydras, and jellyfishes) is modest
when compared to the maximum complexity and morphological diversity of bilaterian body plans (for example, vertebrates, sea squirts, sea urchins, insects, nematodes, octopi,
and phoronids [25,29]). Taking into account the presumed
importance of homeobox genes in the morphological diversification of bilaterians, the close evolutionary relationship
between the Bilateria and the Cnidaria, and the contrasting
evolutionary trajectories of these two lineages, a comparison
of cnidarians and bilaterians becomes critical for understanding the significance of homeobox genes in the morphological
diversification of animal body plans.
Here, we seek to identify homeobox genes that were present
in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor using phylogenetic analysis of homeodomains from bilaterians and cnidarians. Our
analysis takes advantage of the curated genomic datasets of
the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [30-34] and Homo
sapiens [35,36] as well as the recently completed rough draft
of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a representative
cnidarian (Joint Genome Institute; D Rokhsar, principal
investigator).

The phylogenetic analyses presented here reveal the extent to
which the homeobox gene superclass had radiated prior to
the evolutionary split between Cnidaria and Bilateria. For
example, at one extreme, the Cnidaria could have diverged
from the Bilateria prior to the origin of the aforementioned
homeobox classes (ANTP, PRD, LIM, POU, and so on). If so,
then the cnidarian homeobox genes and the bilaterian homeobox genes would constitute independent radiations on the
phylogeny (Figure 2a). This possibility is ruled out by published studies that have identified distinct ANTP, POU, PRD,
and SINE homeodomains in the Cnidaria [5,17,37-45]. Alternatively, the Cnidaria could have diverged from the Bilateria
after the origin of the class founder genes (for example, the
ancestral ANTP class gene, the ancestral PRD class gene, and
so on), but prior to the subsequent radiations of these classes.
In this case, the cnidarian and bilaterian class radiations
would constitute mutually exclusive monophyletic groups
(Figure 2b). However, if the homeobox classes had undergone
extensive radiations prior to the cnidarian-bilaterian divergence, then the same homeobox families would be represented in cnidarian and bilaterian genomes (Figure 2c).
Finally, it might also be the case that some homeobox classes
had radiated prior to the cnidarian-bilaterian radiation, while
other classes had not (Figure 2d).
The phylogenetic analyses presented here reveal that the
ANTP, PRD, LIM, SINE, and POU classes had radiated extensively prior to the divergence of the Cnidaria and the Bilateria.
The HNF class, formerly known only from vertebrates, is also
represented in the Nematostella genome. In addition, we
identify a putative CUT class gene in Nematostella by searching the predicted gene database at StellaBase [46,47]. Our
analyses fail to identify ZF or PROS homeodomains in Nematostella. The phylogenetic analyses reveal 56 distinct homeodomain families that appear to be shared by Nematostella
and one or both of the bilaterian taxa.

Results
Metazoan homeodomains
We retrieved 455 distinct homeodomains from the three
metazoan taxa under study, including 130 from the genome of
Nematostella, a representative non-bilaterian, 228 from
Homo, a representative deuterostome bilaterian, and 97 from
Drosophila, a representative protostome bilaterian. An alignment of all homeodomains (with accession numbers) is pre-

Phylogenetic relationships among homedomains from Nematostella (red lines), human (blue lines), and fruitfly (green lines) determined by neighbor-joining
[95]. Gene names are not provided in this condensed version of the tree, which is intended to convey an overview of the homeodomain radiation in
metazoans. A fully labeled version of this tree is provided in Additional data file 2. All homeodomain classes that are known to be shared among cnidarians
and bilaterians are indicated by colored bars (ANTP, HNF, LIM, POU, PRD, SINE, and TALE). Histograms to the right of the tree indicate the number of
sequences from each species that fall within a given class (Hs, Homo sapiens; Dm, Drosophila melanogaster; Nv, Nematostella vectensis). The gray bars on the
histograms provide a conservative estimate for the size of each homeodomain class in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor (CBA). The homeodomain tallies
shown here are based solely on the phylogenetic analyses performed in this study. Additional data sources, cited in the text, would lead us to adjust the
tallies for Nematostella and the CBA slightly upward.

sented in Additional data file 1. The number of
homeodomains we identified in the human and fruit fly
genomes is comparable to a recent analysis of bilaterian
homeodomains that identified 102 in Drosophila and 257 in
humans [48]. The present analysis includes fewer homeodomains from human and fruit fly because we eliminated hypothetical or computationally predicted homeodomains that
introduced new gaps or extended existing gaps in the alignment. Like the aforementioned analysis, we treated individual homeodomains from multi-homeodomain genes as
separate taxa in our phylogenetic analysis - lower case letters
appended to the gene name distinguish different homeodomains
that

protein.

The neighbor-joining analysis supports the monophyly of the
ANTP class overall, and the monophyly of a Hox-related subclass within the ANTP class. The Bayesian analysis also supports the monophyly of the Hox-related subclass. However,
on the Bayesian tree, there is an unresolved polytomy at the
base of the ANTP class that includes a number of non-ANTP
class homeodomains. This polytomy could be resolved in a
manner that is compatible or incompatible with the monophyly of the ANTP class. The HNF, POU, PRD, and SINE
classes appear monophyletic on both neighbor-joining and
Bayesian trees. The CUT, LIM, and ZF classes do not appear
monophyletic on either the neighbor-joining or Bayesian
trees (Additional data files 2 and 3).

Because the human and Drosophila genomes are still in the
process of being annotated, and because our criteria for
homeodomain inclusion were stringent, this dataset cannot
be considered exhaustive. However, most sequences excluded
from this study represent rapidly evolving and highly divergent sequences that would not have a significant bearing on
the conclusions. The Nematostella dataset consists of firstpass predictions from a draft-quality genomic sequence. It is
possible that a number of Nematostella homeodomains may
have been missed, and it is also possible that homeodomains
from one or more pseudogenes have been included. Nevertheless, these data are more than sufficient for the purpose of
the analyses performed here: to obtain a qualitatively accurate assessment of the homeobox-gene complement present
in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor.

The Bayesian and neighbor-joining trees agree on the classlevel relationships of 126 out of 130 of the Nematostella
homeodomains (96.2%). According to both trees, 72 Nematostella homeodomains belong to the ANTP class, one to the
HNF class, four to the LIM class, five to the POU class, 33 to
the PRD class, five to the SINE class, and six to the TALE class
(Table 1). This represents the first report of cnidarian HNF,
LIM and TALE homeodomains. Four of the Nematostella
homeodomains group with different classes on the Bayesian
and neighbor-joining trees. None of Nematostella sequences
groups with bilaterian homeodomains of the CUT class, the
PROS class, or the ZF class. However, in a subsequent search
of predicted Nematostella genes, we were able to identify a
single protein that exhibits significant similarity to bilaterian
CUT genes. The extensive intermingling of homeodomains
from Nematostella, human, and fly on the phylogeny (Figure
3) reveals that the ANTP, CUT, LIM, POU, PRD, SINE, and
TALE classes had undergone substantial radiations prior to
the split between Cnidaria and Bilateria.

Overall tree topologies and classification of animal
homeodomains
The homeodomain phylogeny produced by Bayesian analysis
agrees substantially with the phylogeny produced by neighbor-joining (fully labeled neighbor-joining and Bayesian phylogenies are contained in Additional data files 2 and 3,
respectively; Figure 3 depicts the neighbor-joining topology
without individual gene names). Both trees recover nearly all
of the accepted bilaterian homeodomain families with high
statistical support. Throughout this paper, we emphasize
phylogenetic inferences that are supported by both methods,
especially those homeodomain families that receive robust
statistical support from both methods, as judged by bootstrap
proportions in the neighbor-joining analysis (BP) and loglikelihood values in the Bayesian analyses (LnL).

ANTP class
Hox-related subclass
Genes from the Hox-related subclass have played a prominent role in the evolution and diversification of the primary
body axis in animals [22,39,49,50]. The phylogenetic analyses indicate 52 Hox-related homeodomains in human, 19 in
fruit fly, and 18 in Nematostella. All 89 of these genes constitute a monophyletic group on both Bayesian and neighborjoining trees (Additional data files 2 and 3). Within this large
clade of Hox related genes, we can identify 15 distinct monophyletic families (Additional data file 1; Table 1). On both the

Bayesian and neighbor-joining trees, eight of these families
appear to have Nematostella representatives: CDX, EVX,
EXEX, GBX, GSX, HOX1, MOX, and ROUGH. Previous studies have reported CDX, EVX, GBX, GSX, HOX1, and MOX
genes in cnidarians [17,37-40,51], but EXEX and ROUGH
homeodomains have not previously been identified in this
phylum. According to the neighbor-joining tree, the HOX2
family may also be represented in Nematostella, which would
be consistent with previously published homeodomain phylogenies that have identified putative anterior Hox genes
(HOX1 and HOX2 families) in the Cnidaria [17,38,39,51]. No
Nematostella sequences group with the HOX3, HOX4,
HOX5, HOX6-8, or HOX9-13 families. The apparent absence
of 'central' Hox genes (HOX4-HOX8) in cnidarians, has been
a consistent finding of recent phylogenetic analyses, but these
same studies have supported the existence of 'posterior' Hox
genes in cnidarians (HOX9-HOX13) [17,38,39,51]. For example, in published neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood
analyses, the Nematostella homeodomains anthox1 and
anthox1a have grouped with posterior Hox genes in bilaterians [17,22,38]. In the present analysis, these same homeodomain sequences (known as NVHD099 and NVHD106) either
fall basal to a clade containing both posterior and central
genes (Bayes), or they fall basal to a clade comprising all the
central Hox genes (neighbor-joining).

odomains group with each of the following families: DLX,
HHEX, HMX, LBX, MSX, NK-1 (slouch), NK-3, NK-6, NK-7,
and TLX. The statistical support for these groupings is very
robust, with neighbor-joining bootstrap proportions and
Bayesian log-likelihood values in excess of 0.88 in all cases.
Multiple Nematostella homeodomains group with each of the
following families: EMX (two sequences), EMXLX (two
sequences), HLX (seven sequences), MSLX (two sequences),
NK-2 (five sequences), and VAX (two sequences). Two Nematostella homeodomains also group with the predicted Drosophila homeodomain CG13424 in what appears to be a very
ancient, but not formally recognized family of ANTP-class
homeodomains. While CG13424 appears missing in the
human genome, two CG13424-related proteins have been
described in another deuterostome, the appendicularian urochordate Oikopleura dioica [53]. None of the Nematostella
homeodomains groups with the following four families on
either of the trees: BARH, BARX, BSH, and EN. Twenty-two
of the Nematostella sequences could not be assigned to a specific family. The results presented here, bolstered by previous
studies that have reported BARX, DLX, EMX, HHEX, MSX,
NK-2, and TLX genes from other cnidarians [39,44,54-56],
make it clear that the ANTP class had radiated extensively
prior to the cnidarian-bilaterian split.

CUT class
While previous studies have reported multiple Hox-related
ANTP genes from individual cnidarian species, including
EVX, MOX, GSX, and Hox genes [17,37-40,51], the present
study is unique in terms of its scope and the thoroughness
with which the Hox-related homeodomains have been sampled from a single cnidarian genome. No previous study has
reported as many as 18 Hox-related genes from a member of
this phylum. The inclusion of numerous additional sequences
has resulted in the identification of previously unreported
families (EXEX and ROUGH), and it has caused us to question the previously hypothesized relationships of NVHD099
and NVHD106. The current analysis does not support the
designation of these genes as posterior Hox genes. The Bayes
tree suggests an interesting alternative hypothesis - that these
two Nematostella homeodomains could be direct descendants of the common ancestor of central and posterior Hox
genes. This could explain the apparent absence of central Hox
genes without the need to invoke gene loss [12,52]. More
detailed phylogenetic and gene linkage studies of Nematostella and other basal metazoan lineages may help to elucidate the early evolution of Hox-related genes.

Other ANTP class families
We identified 122 ANTP class homeodomains that fall outside
the Hox-related clade: 44 from human, 24 from fruit fly, and
54 from sea anemone. Of these 122 homeodomains, 98 can be
classified into one of 21 different gene families (Additional
data file 1; Table 1). According to both trees, Nematostella
appears to possess representatives from 17 of these 21 families (Additional data files 2 to 3). Single Nematostella home-

The genes of the Cut class [3], also known as the Cut superclass [6,57], typically encode two different types of DNAbinding domains: homeodomains as well as cut domains [5860]. Cut domains are roughly 80 amino acids long, and they
are typically located upstream of the homeodomain [6]. Cut
proteins may possess only a single cut domain (as in Onecut),
two cut domains (as in the SATB genes), or three cut domains,
(as in the Drosophila gene Cut [58]). Genes of the Compass
family lack a Cut domain altogether, but they are placed
within this class on the basis of their shared possession with
the SATB genes of a conserved COMPASS domain at the
amino terminus [6]. The Cut class is believed to be monophyletic on the basis of the shared possession of the cut
domain (in all but the Compass family) and on the basis of
phylogenetic analyses of homeodomain and cut domain
sequences [59].
On both the neighbor-joining and Bayesian phylogenies produced here, each of the four previously recognized subgroups
of Cut genes appears monophyletic (COMPASS, CUTL, ONECUT, and SATB [6]). However, the class as a whole does not
appear monophyletic on either tree. On the Bayesian tree, the
ONECUT family appears closely related to the CUTL family,
but the COMPASS and SATB families emerge as independent
lineages. On the neighbor-joining tree, all four Cut families
emerge as distantly related independent lineages. Clearly,
when a broad representation of homeodomain proteins is
considered, phylogenetic analysis of the homeodomain does
not support the monophyly of the Cut class. On the Bayesian
tree, none of the Nematostella homeodomains groups with

the monophyly of the LIM class. On both neighbor-joining
and Bayesian trees, the ISLET, LIM1/5, and LHX6/8 clades
each contain a single Nematostella gene. The Nematostella
homeodomain NVHD055 appears as the sister to a clade
comprising the LHX1/5 and LHX3/4 families on both the
neighbor-joining tree and the Bayes tree.

POU class
POU genes are characterized by an approximately 75 amino
acid DNA binding domain upstream of the homeodomain.
During development, their expression is known to be spatially
and temporally restricted, and they have been implicated in
cell-fate determination, early embryonic development and
neuronal determination [65]. The POU class comprises six
different families [65]. POU I genes have been reported from
non-Bilateria such as sponges [66] and cnidarians (D Jacobs,
personal communication). POU IV and VI genes have also
been described in a cnidarian [67].

reviews

However, an independent analysis suggests that the primordial CUT gene did originate prior to the split between Cnidaria and Bilateria, and that this gene most resembled the
ONECUT family, as previously predicted [6]. We have identified a single putative CUT gene in the Nematostella genome
by searching the database of predicted genes at StellaBase
[46,47] for CUT domains (query conditions: Protein Family
Name: CUT; E-value threshold: 1e-6). The single gene
returned by this search (StellaBase ID: 14839) encodes both a
Cut domain and a homeodomain. The top 50 hits in a BLASTp
search of the non-redundant protein database using this protein as the query are all CUT class proteins, specifically members of the ONECUT family.

Cut class homeodomains. On the neighbor-joining tree, two
Nematostella homeodomains do group with the SATB genes
in a weakly supported clade (BP = 0.14). The phylogenetic
analyses clearly imply that the CUT class had not diversified
prior to the cnidarian-bilaterian split.

information

Both the neighbor-joining and Bayes trees support the monophyly of a PRD clade comprising 53 human homeodomains,
24 fruit fly homeodomains, and 33 Nematostella homeodomains (Additional data files 1 to 3). A previous phylogenetic
analysis of PRD homeodomains delineated the following distinct evolutionary lineages: Al, Anf (HESX1), Arix, Cart1
(ALX3/4), Ceh10, Gsc, Mix, Og12 (SHOX), Otp, Otx, Pax3/7,
Pax4/6, Prx, Ptx, Rx, Siamois (DUX), and Unc4 [5]. All but
two of these lineages appear monophyletic on both Bayesian
and neighbor-joining trees - the Bayesian tree does not support the monophyly of the ALX3/4 and AL families. Three
additional homeodomain families reside within the PRD
radiation on the Bayesian and neighbor-joining trees, bringing the total number of PRD families to 20 - the DMBX, HB
(Homeobrain), and REPO families are each represented in
both Nematostella and the Bilateria, and they cannot be subsumed within the 17 PRD lineages that were defined previously [5,68].

interactions

The phylogenetic analysis presented here identifies 11 LIM
homeodomains in human, 7 in fruit fly, and 4 in Nematostella
(Table 1; Additional data files 1 to 3). The LIM class is divided
into six distinct groups: APTEROUS, ISLET, LIN-11, LHX3/
4, LHX6/8, and LMX [62]. In our trees, all six of these groups
represent discrete clades. Here, we refer to the LIN-11 class as
the LHX1/5 group based on the names of the human and fruit
fly genes that belong to it. If we limit the membership of the
LIM class to these six groups, then the LIM class appears paraphyletic on the neighbor-joining and Bayesian trees (Additional data files 2 and 3). In both the Bayesian and neighborjoining trees, a number of zinc-finger homeodomains disrupt

refereed research

The LIM homeobox genes are characterized by two proteinbinding zinc fingers called LIM domains, which are located
upstream of the homeodomain [62]. LIM homeodomain proteins are widely implicated in neural patterning throughout
the animal kingdom [62,63]. Recently, a LIM-domain containing gene was reported in Nematostella [64], but this gene
does not encode a homeodomain. No LIM-class homeodomains have yet been described for the phylum Cnidaria.

LIM class

reports

The HNF class is a small class of homeodomain proteins that
was erected to accommodate HNF1, a liver-specific transcription factor (hepatic nuclear factor) with a highly atypical
homeodomain [61]. The homeodomains of the HNF class are
unusual in that they possess a large number of extra residues
between helix 2 and helix 3 [6]. So far, this homeodomain
class has not been reported outside of vertebrates. On both
the neighbor-joining and Bayesian trees, there is robust support for a clade uniting two human HNF homeodomains
(HNF1a, HNF1b) with the Nematostella sequence NVHD070
(Additional data files 1 to 3). No Drosophila sequence groups
with this HNF clade.

Nematostella has five putative POU genes, including single
representatives from the POU I, IV, and VI families, and
potentially two representatives from the POU III family
(Additional data files 1 to 4). Class II and class V genes appear
lacking in Nematostella. Drosophila, like Nematostella, is
missing a class V gene, which suggests that this class may be
a vertebrate invention. On the other hand, Drosophila is
missing a class I gene. Its absence in the fruit fly and presence
in sea anemone and human suggests a possible gene loss in
the line leading to Drosophila. We can surmise that at least
four POU homeodomains were present in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor, including single representatives of classes I,
III, IV, and VI. Class II may be a bilaterian invention.

ALX, CEH-10, DMBX, DUX, GSX, HB, OTP, OTX, PAX3/7,
PAX4/6, PTX, REPO, RX and UNC4 (Additional data files 1 to
3; Table 1). Nematostella appears to lack a representative
from the ARIX and PRX families, which are found in fruit fly
and human, and from the ANF and MIX families, which are
found only in human. The fruit fly appears to lack representatives of the ALX, DMBX, and DUX families, all of which are
represented in the human and sea anemone. Likewise, three
of the groups found in fruit fly and sea anemone appear to
lack a human representative: HB, REPO, and UNC4.
The phylogenetic analyses suggest that the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor may have possessed representatives of 15 PRD
homeodomain families. The ANF, ARIX and PRX families
may have originated within the Bilateria. Three PRD families
may have been lost in the line leading to Drosophila (ALX,
DMBX, DUX), while three different PRD families may have
been lost in the line leading to human (HB, REPO, and
UNC4).
The DUX family is home to several human genes with double
and triple homeodomains. Interestingly, three closely linked
Nematostella homeodomains group with the human DUX
homeodomains. These Nematostella homeodomains may be
part of the same locus. If all three homeodomains are
expressed as part of a single protein, it would be the first
reported triple-homeodomain gene in a cnidarian. However,
the statistical support for the branches uniting human DUX
homeodomains with these potential Nematostella DUX
homeodomains is low (BP = 0.21; LnL = 0.35), and the existence of a single transcript comprising all three homeodomains has not been demonstrated experimentally in
Nematostella, so this homology assignment must be regarded
as tentative pending additional evidence. Also, the two most
closely linked of these putative DUX homeoboxes (DuxA and
DuxC) are extremely similar at the nucleotide level, both
within the homeobox itself and in an intron that interrupts
the homeobox. This is a region of the assembly rife with
repeated sequence, a condition that would be consistent with
either a very recent tandem duplication or a false duplication
caused by an error in the assembly. A molecular analysis of
this region will be required to verify the assembly.

SINE class
SINE class genes (for example, Drosophila sine oculis and
vertebrate six genes) possess a highly distinctive homeodomain in addition to a conserved Six/so domain, 120 amino
acids in length, that is located upstream of the homeodomain.
Three families are recognized (SIX1/2, SIX3/6, and SIX4/5)
[6]. All three families have been reported from the Cnidaria
previously [45,69]. A single SIX1/2 class gene has also been
recovered from sponges [45].
We identified six SINE homeodomains in human, three in fly,
and five in Nematostella. Both the neighbor-joining and
Bayesian trees support the monophyly of the SINE class and

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R64

the monophyly of each of its constituent families. On both
trees, Nematostella homeodomain NVHD073 groups with
the SIX1/2 family, NVHD128 groups with the SIX3/6 family,
and NVHD030 groups with the SIX4/5 family. Two other
Nematostella homeodomains (NVHD061 and NVHD093)
fall within the SINE class, but their exact phylogenetic positions differ between trees. All five of these predicted homeodomain sequences are located in close proximity to predicted
Six/so domains (data not shown). The findings of this study
and previous studies make it very clear that the SINE family
had expanded to encompass three distinct members prior to
the cnidarian-bilaterian split [45,69].

TALE class
Homeodomains of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) class are characterized by the possession of three extra
amino acids in the loop between helix 1 and helix 2 of the
homeodomain [6]. TALE homeodomains have been recovered from bilaterian animals, plants, and fungi [6,70]. We
identified 16 TALE class homeodomains from human, 7 from
Drosophila, and 6 from Nematostella. This appears to be the
first report of TALE class homeodomains in a non-bilaterian
metazoan. On both the neighbor-joining and Bayesian trees,
the four recognized families of TALE homeodomains appear
monophyletic: IRX, MEIS, PBX, and TGIF [6]. All four families are represented in the Nematostella genome. On both
trees, Nematostella homeodomain NVHD108 groups with
the IRX class, NVHD107 groups with the MEIS class,
NVHD040 groups with the PBX class, and NVHD149 groups
with the TGIF class. Two Nematostella homeodomain
sequences (NVHD036 and NVHD143) fall within the TALE
radiation, but their precise position differs between the
neighbor-joining and Bayesian trees. Five of the six of the
Nematostella TALE homeodomains contain three extra
amino acids in the same position as in human and fly. The
sixth, NVHD036 actually contains four extra amino acids in
this location. In five of six Nematostella TALE homeodomains, the first extra residue is a histidine, just as in bilaterians.

ZF class
Proteins of the ZF class are known to encode as many as 4
homeodomains and 17 zinc fingers [6]. The homeodomain
sequences are highly divergent. It has been suggested that the
large number of DNA-binding domains present per protein
might reduce the evolutionary constraints operating on the
evolution of each individual DNA-binding domain [6]. Presumably, the shared possession of zinc fingers reflects a
shared common ancestry of ZF class homeodomains. However, neither of the homeodomain phylogenies supports the
monophyly of this class. A few well supported ZF homeodomain families can be recognized on both trees, but none of
these families includes a Nematostella representative (Additional data files 1 to 3). At this time, it appears possible that
this homeodomain class is specific to bilaterians.

Homeodomain families in the cnidarian-bilaterian
ancestor

information

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R64

interactions

How many homeodomains were present in the cnidarianbilaterian ancestor? If we infer that every homeodomain family shared by Nematostella and the Bilateria was represented
by a single ancestral sequence in their common ancestor, an
inference consistent with the phylogenetic analyses, then this
ancestor possessed at least 56 homeodomains (Table 1; Figure 3). The phylogenetic affinities of some Nematostella
homeodomains are less well supported than others, and it is
likely that a few homeodomains are misidentified here. However, our phylogenetic reconstruction seeks to strike a balance between two types of error: misidentifying particular
Nematostella homeodomains as orthologs of particular bilaterian homeodomains; and failing to recognize true orthology
between particular homeodomains in Nematostella and bilaterians. The latter error forces us to assume evolutionary
events (gene duplications) that never actually occurred. The

refereed research

It is clear that a major radiation of homeobox genes occurred
prior to the split between the Cnidaria and Bilateria. As
expected, human homeodomains substantially outnumber
fruit fly or anemone homeodomains. Typically, each homeodomain family contains two to three times as many human
representatives as fruit fly representatives. This partly reflects
the large scale genomic duplications that are known to have
occurred in the history of the deuterostomes [71,72]. However, it is surprising that the sea anemone, a morphologically
simple animal and an outgroup to the Bilateria, would possess substantially more homeodomains than the fruit fly (130
versus 97). This result may be attributed to three factors. The
sea anemone inherited a large complement of homeodomains
from the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor, the fruit fly has experienced some apparent homeodomain loss, and the anemone
has experienced numerous homeodomain duplications after
its divergence from the Bilateria.

deposited research

Three homeodomains from the TALE class and the lone representative of the HNF class are also interrupted by introns in
Nematostella. The TALE class homeodomain of NVHD040
(PBX) is interrupted by a single intron at nucleotide position
133 of its 189-nucleotide homeobox. The homeoboxes of two
other TALE class members, NVHD107 (MEIS) and
NVHD036 are each interrupted by two introns. Likewise, the
homeodomain of NVHD070 (HNF class) is interrupted by
two introns. Two homeodomains whose class membership is
ambiguous (NVHD045 and NVHD007) are interrupted by a
single intron at nucleotide position 133 of their 189-nucleotide homeoboxes, just as in the TALE class homeodomain
NVHD040.

Discussion

reports

The possession of an intron at the identical location in nearly
all Nematostella PRD homeodomains reinforces the conclusion that the PRD class is monophyletic. One Nematostella
homeodomain of uncertain class affinities (NVHD088) also
exhibits an intron in the same location as 31 of the PRD
sequences. This sequence is nested within the PRD radiation
in the Bayesian tree, but it falls outside of the PRD radiation
in the neighbor-joining tree. This sequence may in fact be a
member of the PRD class.

The intron situation in Nematostella contrasts markedly with
that in Drosophila and humans. These bilaterian organisms
possess many more PRD-class homeodomains that lack
introns, many more non-PRD-class homeodomains that contain introns, and the position of introns within the homeodomain is highly variable (Additional data file 1). These data
suggest that an intron was introduced at position 139 of the
homeobox in the ancestral Paired homeodomain. Subsequently, after the divergence of Cnidaria and Bilateria, there
has been a greater constraint on loss or gain of homeodomain
introns within the Cnidaria. Additional analyses are needed
to determine whether this constraint on intron gain or loss is
specific to the homeodomain superfamily or whether it might
be a general feature of cnidarian genomes. If intron location
proves to be a particularly stable trait in many cnidarian
genes, then the Cnidaria may prove extremely valuable for
elucidating the early evolution of metazoan gene families.

reviews

In contrast to the Bilateria, in Nematostella, the presence and
location of homeodomain-interrupting introns appears much
more evolutionarily stable (Additional data file 1). In Nematostella, only the HNF, PRD, and TALE class exhibit introns
within the homeodomain. Furthermore, the location of
introns within the homeodomain is highly consistent. Of the
130 Nematostella homeodomains included in this study, 38
are interrupted by introns (Additional data file 1). Three
Nematostella homeodomains are interrupted by two introns
each (NVHD170 of the HNF class plus NVHD107 and
NVHD036, both of the TALE class). The overwhelming
majority of these introns (33/41) are located at nucleotide
position 139 of the canonical 180-nucleotide homeobox.
Nearly all members of the PRD class in Nematostella (31/33)
contain an intron at this location. The only PRD class homeodomains to lack an intron at this location are sequences that
cannot be assigned to a particular family (NVHD031 and
NVHD052).

Ryan et al. R64.13

comment

The presence or absence of introns and their location relative
to the homeodomain may provide evidence regarding homeodomain phylogeny. However, in the Bilateria, this trait
appears evolutionarily labile, and so the phylogenetic utility
of homeodomain introns may be compromised by rampant
homoplasy [3]. In the Bilateria, homeobox genes from all 10
classes may possess introns that interrupt the homeodomain,
and these introns have been found to occur at over 20 different positions within the homeodomain (Additional data file 1)
[3].

estimate given here for the homeodomain complement of the
cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor almost certainly represents an
underestimate because more cnidarian homeodomains will
be found in the future, and because many sequences that were
included in this analysis could not be placed unambiguously
into specific families.
Some of these difficult-to-classify sequences may derive
directly from ancestral genes that were present in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. For example, on the Bayesian tree,
NVHD099 and NVHD106 appear as the sister group to a large
clade containing central and posterior Hox families. These
cnidarian genes could be directly descended from a single
central/posterior ancestral sequence in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. Taking this into account, our estimate for the
number of homeoboxes in the genome of the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor could plausibly be increased from 56 to 57.
Two other factors could cause us to underestimate the
number of homeodomains present in the cnidarian-bilaterian
ancestor. In some instances, homeodomains derived from a
common ancestor may have diverged so substantially in the
three lineages represented in this study that they can no
longer be recognized as members of the same family. In other
instances, gene loss in either Nematostella or the two bilaterian systems could hide the fact that a particular homeodomain was present in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor.

Homeodomain families unique to Bilateria
In our dataset, 17 different gene families shared by human
and fruit fly appear to be lacking in Nematostella. Five of
these are Hox-related homeodomains: HOX3, HOX4, HOX5,
HOX6-8, and HOX9-13. Other ANTP class genes that are
shared by the bilaterians but missing from Nematostella are
BARX, BSH, and EN. Nematostella also appears to lack two
CUT families that are shared between human and fruit fly
(CUTL and ONECUT), three LIM families (AP, LHX3/4, and
LMX), one POU family (POU2), two PRD families (ARIX and
PRX), and one ZF family (ZFH2). Additional gene surveys
may identify some of these 'missing' genes in the genome of
Nematostella or other Cnidaria (for example, the identification of a likely CUT gene in Nematostella that was discussed
above). However, if the absence of particular homeodomain
families in Cnidaria can be confirmed, then we may one day
attribute the evolution of certain bilaterian traits to the origin
and diversification of these key developmental regulators.
Homeodomain proteins found in Bilateria but apparently
lacking in Cnidaria (such as central Hox genes, EN, and BSH)
are implicated in the development of important bilaterian
body plan features, including segmentation, paired appendages, and brains.

Homeodomain loss in human and fruit fly?
Recent expressed sequence tag (EST) studies on cnidarians
have demonstrated that gene loss has been rampant in some
bilaterian model systems, particularly the model protostomes

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R64

Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans [73,74]. In this
study, we observed several homeodomain families that are
present in Nematostella but appear to be missing in either
human or fruit fly. Six homeodomain families are present in
the human and the anemone but appear to be missing from
the fly (ALX, DMBX, DUX, HNF1, POU1, and VAX), while
eight homeodomain families are present in the fly and the
anemone but appear to be missing from the human
(CG13424, EMXLX, HB, MSXLX, NK7, REPO, ROUGH and
UNC4).
The conclusion that these genes have been lost is not significantly affected by the exclusion of computationally predicted
homeodomains that introduced new gaps or extended existing gaps in the alignment - several such sequences were
included in the Nam and Nei study [48] but left out of the
present study. We performed a neighbor-joining analysis on
the 257 human and 102 fly sequences from the Nam and Nei
study (not shown). Except for a single human sequence, a
partial-homeodomain that grouped with the genes of the
Unc4 family, none of the other families identified in this study
as missing in the human or fruit fly was present in the larger
dataset [4,48]. The partial Unc4 homeodomain was removed
from our analysis because it introduced gaps into the alignment. It is possible that this Unc4-like sequence is a pseudogene.
If homeodomain families are being lost (or modified beyond
recognition) over the course of animal evolution, then some
families that appear unique to human or fruit fly in our dataset may in fact be shared among protostomes and deuterostomes. By utilizing BLAST searches and consulting previously
published studies, we were able to demonstrate that HOX3,
COMPASS, IPF, SHOX, and PROS are distributed across both
protostomes and deuterostomes, despite the fact that, in our
dataset, they are missing from either the human or the fly. For
example, while none of the Drosophila homeodomains group
with the vertebrate HOX3 homeodomains on the phylogenies, a BLAST of the human HoxA3 homeodomain against
protostome sequences identifies a clear HOX3 homeodomain
in the spider Cupiennius (Figure 4). Furthermore, while not
supported by our analyses, there is evidence from other phylogenetic studies, gene expression, and gene linkage that Drosophila zen1, zen2, and bcd are actually derived members of
the HOX3 family [75-77]. The IPF/XLOX family also appears
to be missing from Drosophila, but XLOX genes have been
reported from a number of protostome animals, including
sipunculans and annelids [78-80]. Among protostomes, the
best match to the human IPF homeodomain is the XLOX
homeodomain from the sipunculan worm Phascolion strombus (Figure 4) [78]. The COMPASS family appears to be missing from human, but BLASTp of the Drosophila dveA
homeodomain against all deuterostome sequences detected a
clear homolog in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus (Figure
4). Our bioinformatic survey of Drosophila homeodomains

Why does Nematostella outnumber Drosophila?
The results presented here suggest that the fruit fly has lost
some homeodomain sequences that were present in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor, including HNF1, VAX, POU1,
ALX3/4, DMBX, and DUX (Tables 1 and 2). This is not
entirely unexpected given that widespread gene loss in Drosophila has been revealed previously by comparison of cnidarian and bilaterian ESTs [73,74]. However, the number of
homeodomains that appear missing from the human genome
slightly exceeds the number missing in Drosophila (Table 2;

PROS class. However, a BLASTp search with human SHOX
homeodomain against protostome sequences identified a
predicted protein in Drosophila with near perfect resemblance over the first 47 amino acids (45/47 identities). The
predicted protein appears to be missing residues 48 to 60 of
the homeodomain. This may be an error in the annotation,
which would explain why we failed to include this putative
homeodomain sequence in our dataset. A BLASTp search
with human Prox1 against protostome sequences identified
the Drosophila prospero homeodomain (Figure 4).

Reciprocal protostome versus deuterostome BLAST searches. Reciprocal BLAST searches were used to identify protostome representatives of missing fly
homeodomains and deuterostome representatives of missing human homeodomains. Human homeodomains representing the ANF, BARX, HOX3, IPF/
XLOX, MIX, PROX, SATB, and SHOX families were used as queries for BLASTp searches of protostome entries in the non-redundant (NR) protein
database. The top hit was then BLASTed back against our dataset. Similarly, the fruit fly dveA homeodomain (COMPASS family) was used as a query to
search deuterstome proteins. The top hit was then blasted back against our dataset. The initial query sequence and the top hits in each BLASTp search are
aligned to the Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain. The BLASTp scores and E-values are shown, as are the percentage of amino acid 'identities' (% id)

*In the HOX class, IPF/XLOX is counted as a shared class because, even though it is not found in Drosophila, its presence in other protostome
animals makes clear that its absence in the fruit fly is due to a secondary loss. †Secondary loss of IPF/XLOX is known to have occurred in Drosophila.
This gene is found in other protostome animals and so, while it is scored as missing from Drosophila, it is also regarded as a shared family among
bilaterians that is missing in Nematostella. Hs, Homo sapiens; Dm, Drosophila melanogaster; Nv, Nematostella vectensis.

eight versus six, respectively), so any loss of homeodomain
sequences from Drosophila does not appear extreme.
The invention of novel homeodomains in the lineage leading
to Nematostella contributes more to the sea anemone's
excess over the fruit fly than does the number of missing
homeodomains in Drosophila. After all, the loss of 6 homeodomains in Drosophila is more than offset by the presence of
18 homeodomains that are present in fruit fly and human but
absent in the anemone (Table 2). The phylogenetic analyses,
in concert with gene linkage data [81] (unpublished results),
indicate that the lineage leading to Nematostella has experienced tandem duplication of many homeobox families,
including MOX, HOX1, HOX2, and OTX. Particularly within
the ANTP class and the PRD class, there are extensive homeodomain radiations that appear unique to the sea anemone
(Figure 3; Additional data files 2 and 3). Kusserow and coworkers [82] revealed similar Nematostella-specific radiations within the Wnt gene superfamily.
It is important to note that the combination of recent tandem
duplication and polymorphism creates an analytical challenge for the assembly. Polymorphism may cause the assembly to overestimate the number of distinct homeoboxes in the
Nematostella genome by mistaking different alleles for distinct loci. This possibility can be ruled out when the regions
flanking the sequences in question are highly distinctive.
However, recent tandem duplications can juxtapose closely
related homeoboxes surrounded by highly similar flanking
sequences. After careful examination of the regions flanking
three pairs of related homeoboxes, we cannot absolutely rule
out the possibility that these may be false gene duplications
due to assembly errors: NVHD003/064, NVHD007/045, and
NVHD102/043. Furthermore, the three candidate DUX

homeodomains NVHD005, NVHD011, and NVHD038 reside
in a particularly complex region featuring lots of repetitive
sequence. Experimental evidence will be required to validate
the assembly in these regions.

Conclusion

If the evolution of homeobox genes has been critical to the
evolution of morphological diversity in animals [6,19-24],
then it is important to establish when particular homeobox
genes first appeared in metazoan evolution. The results presented here provide the first glance at a nearly complete
homeodomain complement in a non-bilaterian metazoan.
These data allow us to infer the condition found in the common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria. All of the major
homeobox classes (ANTP, LIM, POU, PRD, SINE, and TALE)
must have undergone a significant radiation prior to the evolutionary split between Cnidaria and Bilateria. Conservatively, we estimate that 56 distinct homeodomain families
were represented in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. Seventeen specific homeodomain families present in fly and human
were found to be absent in Nematostella, and these may represent bilaterian inventions. Surprisingly, the sea anemone
Nematostella, a simple non-bilaterian animal, possesses far
more homeodomains than the fruit fly (131 versus 97). The
sea anemone's numerical advantage over Drosophila can be
attributed mostly to the origin of new homeoboxes in the cnidarian lineage.
The results presented here emphasize that there is no simple
relationship between the complexity of gene families and the
complexity of organisms. Cnidarians have fewer distinct body
regions and about five-fold fewer distinctive cell types than
arthropods [29], yet Nematostella has substantially more

Bayesian analysis was performed using MrBayes version
3.1.2-MPI [93]. Fixed rate models were estimated by MrBayes
(aamodelpr = mix). The Markov chain Monte Carlo search
was run for 10,000,000 generations with trees being sampled
every 100 and printed every 1,000 generations. By default,
MrBayes performs two simultaneous, completely independent analyses starting from different random trees (Nruns =
2). These 2 runs generated 10,000 trees each. These 2 treefiles were meshed and the first 4,000 trees were discarded as
'burnin'. The Consense program from PHYLIP [94] was used
to build a 'Majority rule (extended)' tree from the remaining
16,000 trees. A neighbor-joining [95] analysis was performed
using PHYLIP (version 3.6.1) [94]. The Dayhoff PAM matrix
was used to generate the distance matrix. Support for clades
on the neighbor-joining tree was assessed by 1,000-replicates
of bootstrap [96]. The phylogenetic dataset is available as a

We assembled the publicly available Nematostella shotgun
traces generated by the Joint Genome Institute using the
Phusion assembler [84]. The traces may be obtained through
the Trace Archive v3.0 at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA [85]. The Phusion program generated
the following statistics regarding the assembly (contig-bases:
360061553 bases; contig-N50: 10888 bases; contig-count:
81401; coverage: 7.6X; genome-size: 400 to 450 Mb, estimated from word count distribution; scaffold-size:
381073596 bases; scaffold-N50: 49588 base; scaffold-count:
50021; heterozygosity: approximately 1 single nucleotide polymorphism in 250 bases.) This assembly is searchable at the
StellaBase website [46,47].

The complete set of proteins of H. sapiens and D. melanogaster were downloaded from NCBI's RefSeq database in
FASTA format (2004-10-14) [88,89]. These sequences were
screened using the homeodomain profile from PFAM (200408-20) [90] and the hmmsearch program from the HMMer
software suite [91]. A custom Perl script was used to extract
the homeodomain sequences from the FASTA files according
to the hits reported by hmmsearch (Additional data file 4).
Each homeodomain from multi-homeodomain genes was
treated as a separate taxon. The human, Drosophila, and
Nematostella sequences were aligned by eye to the alignment
of human homeodomains published by Banerjee-Basu and
Baxevanis [4] using the GeneDoc software [92]. To avoid
long-branch artifacts associated with derived sequences and
spurious predictions, homeodomains from RefSeq sequences
that introduced new gaps into the alignment and had not
been experimentally verified were discarded.

Homeodomain motifs were then extracted from predicted
proteins. In cases where no gene was predicted, the genomic
segments were translated in six frames and the homeodomains corresponding to the BLAST hit were extracted. The
homeodomains and the genomic sequences from which the
homeodomains were derived have been submitted to GenBank.

reviews

We must caution that all of the results described here are
based on phylogenetic analysis of an undoubtedly incomplete
dataset of homeodomain sequences. The ongoing annotation
of the human, fruit fly, and Nematostella genomes will allow
us to build on this dataset, thereby improving our understanding. In addition, the sequencing of additional bilaterian
and basal metazoan genomes will allow us to consult more
taxonomic sources so that our inferences about higher taxa
are based on more data points. Complementary data types
may also prove useful, including other protein domains where
appropriate (for example, cut domains, six/so domains, LIM
domains, paired domains, and so on), and data on genomic
linkage. Finally, as our datasets steadily increase in size, the
development of more rapid and more sophisticated computational methods for the analysis and representation of gene
family evolution may yield insights that are not currently
attainable.

comment

homeobox genes than Drosophila. Measures of morphological complexity, such as the number of cell types, may not be
tightly correlated with gene number [83]. More complex
organisms may possess fewer genes than simpler organisms,
but each gene of the more complex organism may be deployed
in a greater number of distinct spatiotemporal contexts [83].
Global comparisons of gene number, and even comparisons
within particular gene families, may, therefore, prove insufficient to illuminate the genomic causes of organismal complexity. Future functional studies should be directed at
understanding the consequences of particular gene radiations for particular organismal lineages. Genome-wide phylogenetic analyses such as this will be required to identify such
gene radiations.

BLAST searches to identify missing bilaterian genes

2.

BLAST searches were used to identify possible protostome
representatives of homeodomain families that were represented in our data only by human sequences (HOX3, IPF/
XLOX, BARX, SATB, ANF, MIX, and SHOX). The human
homeodomain sequences were used to query the non-redundant (NR) protein database using BLASTp. The BLAST
searches were performed through the NCBI web site using the
Entrez query terms "protostomia[ORGN]". The top hit was
then BLASTed back against human protein sequences for
missing Drosophila sequences, and "deuterostomia[ORGN]"
for missing human sequences. The top hit and those hits that
shared an E-value within the same order of magnitude as the
top hit were BLASTed back against our three-species homeodomain dataset. If the top hit (or a hit that shared an E-value
within the same order of magnitude as the top hit) was a
member of the missing family, that sequence was considered
to be orthologous.
