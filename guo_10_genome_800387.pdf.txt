Abstract
Background: Variations in genome size within and between species have been observed since the 1950 s in diverse
taxonomic groups. Serving as model organisms, smooth pufferfish possess the smallest vertebrate genomes.
Interestingly, spiny pufferfish from its sister family have genome twice as large as smooth pufferfish. Therefore,
comparative genomic analysis between smooth pufferfish and spiny pufferfish is useful for our understanding of
genome size evolution in pufferfish.
Results: Ten BAC clones of a spiny pufferfish Diodon holocanthus were randomly selected and shotgun sequenced. In
total, 776 kb of non-redundant sequences without gap representing 0.1% of the D. holocanthus genome were
identified, and 77 distinct genes were predicted. In the sequenced D. holocanthus genome, 364 kb is homologous with
265 kb of the Takifugu rubripes genome, and 223 kb is homologous with 148 kb of the Tetraodon nigroviridis genome.
The repetitive DNA accounts for 8% of the sequenced D. holocanthus genome, which is higher than that in the T.
rubripes genome (6.89%) and that in the Te. nigroviridis genome (4.66%). In the repetitive DNA, 76% is retroelements
which account for 6% of the sequenced D. holocanthus genome and belong to known families of transposable
elements. More than half of retroelements were distributed within genes. In the non-homologous regions, repeat
element proportion in D. holocanthus genome increased to 10.6% compared with T. rubripes and increased to 9.19%
compared with Te. nigroviridis. A comparison of 10 well-defined orthologous genes showed that the average intron size
(566 bp) in D. holocanthus genome is significantly longer than that in the smooth pufferfish genome (435 bp).
Conclusion: Compared with the smooth pufferfish, D. holocanthus has a low gene density and repeat elements rich
genome. Genome size variation between D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish exhibits as length variation
between homologous region and different accumulation of non-homologous sequences. The length difference of
intron is consistent with the genome size variation between D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish. Different
transposable element accumulation is responsible for genome size variation between D. holocanthus and the smooth
pufferfish.
Background
Genome size, defined as the total amount of DNA contained within the haploid chromosome set of an organism, is not only one of the most fundamental genetic
properties of living organisms, but also is one of the most
mysterious biological traits. A well-known phenomenon
is the "C-value paradox" [1] or "G-value/N-value paradox"

[2,3], which is the long-recognized lack of correlation
between genome size and organism complexity [4]. A
case in point is that some amoebas possess 200 times
more DNA than humans [1]. Another striking characteristic of the genome size is that it can vary greatly among
different taxonomic categories and even among closely
related species. Genome size varies 250-fold in arthropods, 350-fold in fish, 1,000-fold in angiosperms, 5,000fold in algae, and 5,800-fold in protozoans, and more than
200,000-fold in eukaryotes as reviewed by Gregory [5].
Genome size variation among closely related species is
also prevalent and significant. For example, the fly genus

Drosophila displays a twofold variation in genome size
[6], whereas variation of genome size can achieve ninefold in a plant genus Crepsis [7].
Genome size variation appears to have resulted from a
number of different processes over evolution time. In the
short run, genome doubling or large-scale sequence
duplication might be one of the most straightforward
mechanisms underlying genome size variation [1,8]. The
gain and loss of non-coding DNA are considered to be
the main force behind the gradual accumulation of
genome size variation over evolution time. For example,
the correlation between genome size and transposable
element amplification [9,10], and intron size variation
[11-14], and gene duplication and pseudogenization [15]
have been widely studied and verified across a broad phylogenetic range. Study has revealed that a massive loss of
ancestral protein-coding genes has contributed to the
reduction in the size of the chicken genome [16]. Overall,
genome size variation is now recognized as reflecting the
net effects of a collection of mechanisms that sometimes
work antagonistically to expand and contract the
genome, and is the result of that many forces affect collectively and operate heterogeneously among genomic
regions [17,18].
The comparative genomic analysis within closely
related taxonomic groups is a powerful tool to uncover
mechanisms of genome size variation, as studies in cotton
[17-21] and Drosophila [6,22]. In this context, the pufferfish may be suitable organisms with which to study the
genome size variation of vertebrates for the following reasons. The variation of genome size between tetraodontid
and diodontid pufferfish presumably has resulted from a
reduction of genome size in the smooth tetraodontid
pufferfish relative to their spiny diodontid relatives since
their divergence during the 50-70 million years ago (Figure 1) [23]. In the family Tetraodontidae, the smooth
pufferfish have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to
date, which are one-eighth the length of the human
genome, with a haploid genome size 365 million bp in T.
rubripes [13] and 340 million bp in Te. nigroviridis [24].
The spiny pufferfish in Diodontidae, the sister family of
Tetraodontidae, have genomes that are roughly twice as
large, about 800 Mb [23,25,26]. Mola mola (Molidae), a
member of the closest outgroup to Tetraodontidae and
Diodontidae, has a genome size around 800 Mb [23,26].
Therefore, the variation of genome size in pufferfish,
especially the highly reduced genome size in the smooth
pufferfish, makes pufferfish a good model system to study
genome size shrinking in vertebrates. Furthermore,
because of possessing small genomes, the smooth pufferfish (T. rubripes and Te. nigroviridis) have been used as
model organisms and their genomes have been
sequenced [13,24]. It is feasible to investigate the dynam-

ics of genome size variation in large-scale genomic region
rather than in particular genome region [17,18].
By combining the results of the DNA renaturation
kinetics analysis and rates of small (< 400 bp) insertions
and deletions, Neafsey and Palumbi [27] proposed that
the unequal rates of large insertions have contributed to
the genome size variation between tetraodontid and diodontid pufferfish since their divergence, and genome
compacting in the tetraodontid lineage is attributable to a
reduction in the rate of large insertions rather than to an
increase in large deletions. Aparicio et al [13] demonstrated that the genome of T. rubripes is compact partly
because its introns are shorter than those of the human
genome. To better understand the variation of genome
size among pufferfish, it may be informative to compare
closely related species within a phylogenetic framework
using a comparative genomic approach by fully utilizing
the whole genome sequence resources of T. rubripes and
Te. nigroviridis.
Therefore, in this study, we have examined the genome
of the spiny pufferfish D. holocanthus by sequencing bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) and conducted comparative genomic analyses with the genomes of the
smooth pufferfish T. rubripes and Te. nigroviridis. The
possible forces related to genome size variation were analyzed. Synteny analysis showed that less 50% of the
sequenced D. holocanthus genomic sequences could be
aligned with the genomes of tetraodontid pufferfish T.
rubripes and Te. nigroviridis, which is consistent with
their different genome size level. The repeat element
component of the sequenced D. holocanthus genome was
7.94%, which is higher than the total repeat element component of whole genomes of T. rubripes (6.89%) and Te.
nigroviridis (4.66%). The differences of repeat element
components in both the homologous regions and the
non-homologous regions between D. holocanthus and

tetraodontid pufferfish are large and significant, especially the proportion of retroelements. The differences of
intron size between D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish are also significant. Our results showed that intron
size variation was consistent with genome size variation
between D. holocanthus and smooth pufferfish. We verified that different amount and content of transposable
elements were responsible for the genome size variation
between D. holocanthus and smooth pufferfish.

Results
Sequence assembly and annotation

A BAC library of the spiny pufferfish D. holocanthus was
constructed and used for BAC clone selection in this
study. Ten clones, containing sequences of around 100 kb,
were randomly selected and subsequently sequenced at
the Beijing Genomics Institute. A total of 9,286 highquality reads produced a 2.84 Mb data set. By combining
with the estimated length of each BAC clone, we determined that the average coverage for draft sequences of
these BAC clones is approximately 3.14-fold. Further
assembly generated 49 scaffolds, ranging from 2.2 kb to
66.6 kb and representing a total of 776 kb of non-redundant sequences without gaps and 822 kb of non-redundant sequences with gaps of the D. holocanthus genome.
The detailed sequencing information is given in Table 1.
The GC content of the sequenced D. holocanthus
genome was 41.65%. Gene annotation of these sequences
predicted 87 putative genes, including alternatively splicing transcript forms. In the predicted gene set, 62 genes
had complete open reading frames, ranging from 204 bp
to 13.8 kb with an average length of 1517 bp and 8 coding
exons per gene on average. In the predicted gene set,
totally 619 complete exons existed and had an average

length of 194 bp and 532 introns had an average length of
845 bp. The coding regions accounted for approximately
120 kb, or 15.5% of the sequenced D. holocanthus genome
in total. In the predicted gene set, 27 of the predicted
genes that were predicted by both FgenesH 2.6 [28] and
GENSCAN 1.0 [29] had no significant hits when
searched against the non-redundant GenBank protein
database with BLASTP [30]. This subset of genes was
named as novel predicted proteins. Names of remaining
gene-encoded proteins were assigned according to the
BLASTP searches. Possible alternatively spliced forms of
10 genes were annotated in the predicted gene set.
Finally, a total of 77 distinct genes with either complete or
incomplete coding sequences (CDS) were found in the
sequenced BAC clones dataset. Detailed information
regarding the predicted gene set of the spiny pufferfish is
given in Table 2.
Comparative mapping and synteny identification

To identify homologous regions and sequence similarity
patterns between the sequenced genome of D. holocanthus and the genomes of other species, we performed
BLASTN searches against genomes of T. rubripes, Te.
nigroviridis, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and Oryzias latipes.
The genomic synteny regions between the sequenced
genome of D. holocanthus and the genomes of other
model fish were listed in Table 3. The T. rubripes genome
had the highest sequence similarity to the sequenced D.
holocanthus genome, and 46.9% of the sequenced BAC
sequences could be aligned with the genome of T.
rubripes, 28.8% with the Te. nigroviridis genome, 22.1%
with the G. aculeatus genome, and 20.9% with the O. latipes genome. Based on the results of the BLASTN
searches (see Materials and Methods), 30 scaffolds of the

sequenced BAC clones had syntenic regions and were
localized on 12 scaffolds in T. rubripes, and the total
length of the homologous regions was 364 kb in D. holocanthus and was 265 kb in T. rubripes; 25 BACsequenced scaffolds were localized on chromosome 2, 12,
13, and 17, and Un_random region in Te. nigroviridis, and
the total length of the homologous regions was 223 kb in
D. holocanthus and was 148 kb in Te. nigroviridis; 26
BAC-sequenced scaffolds were localized on 10 groups
and 2 scaffolds in G. aculeatus, and the total length of the
homologous regions was 171 kb in D. holocanthus and
was 168 kb in G. aculeatus; 24 BAC-sequenced scaffolds
were localized on chromosome 1, 5, 6, 12, 15, and 17, and
scaffold 1954 and 4255 in O. latipes, and the total length
of the homologous regions was 162 kb in D. holocanthus
and was 159 kb in O. latipes. Figure 2 shows the synteny
relationships of scaffolds of clone ctfh in the spiny pufferfish with T. rubripes and Te. nigroviridis. Fifteen BACsequenced scaffolds of the sequenced D. holocanthus
genome were sequence-conserved and could be localized
on all genomes of the other four model fish species.
Eleven BAC-sequenced scaffolds, representing 100 kb or
12.1% of the sequenced D. holocanthus genome, had no
homologous regions in the other four fish genomes. Fourteen BAC-sequenced scaffolds, representing a total
length of 100 kb sequences or 12.2% of the sequenced D.
holocanthus genome, could not be localized on the
genomes of T. rubripes and Te. nigroviridis, but two of
these sequences had homologous regions in G. aculeatus
or O. latipes. Ten BAC-sequenced scaffolds displayed
homologous relationships to the specific regions of the T.
rubripes genome but had no synteny regions in the

genome of Te. nigroviridis, whereas five BAC-sequenced
scaffolds can be localized on the genome of Te. nigroviridis but had no synteny regions in the genome of T.
rubripes.
Intron size variation

To investigate size intron variation between D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish, pairwise comparisons
were performed. The predicted gene dataset of the
sequenced D. holocanthus genome contained a total of
692 complete exons with an average length 208 bp and
621 introns with an average length 868 bp. To accurately
estimate size variations of intron of these species, the
structures of the predicted genes with complete open
reading frames were re-determined using GeneWise [31],
a widely used tool that exquisitely predicted gene structure based on similarity searches against proteins. Finally,
10 genes (see Table 2) with high reliability (GeneWise
score > 100) were selected from the predicated gene dataset for intron size comparisons. After the introns with
sequence gaps were excluded, a total of 125 gap-free
introns were used for comparison with their orthologues
in the other model fish species. Orthologous genes were
retrieved directly from the Ensembl ortholog prediction
dataset (release 52) in T. rubripes, Te. nigroviridis, and G.
aculeatus.
The length distribution patterns of intron size are
shown in Figure 3. The numbers and mean lengths of the
intron size are listed in Table 4. The modal values of
intron size appear in the range of 1-100 bp in all of these
four species, with 83% of introns in T. rubripes and 76% of
introns in Te. nigroviridis < 500 bp, whereas only 62% of

introns in D. holocanthus and 66% of introns in G. aculeatus are shorter than 500 bp. The proportion of intron longer than 1000 bp was 7.1% in T. rubripes, 8.9% in Te.
nigroviridis, 13.6% in D. holocanthus, and 18.9% in G.
aculeatus. The mean length of intron in the T. rubripes
genome was 435.2 bp and was almost equal to that (434.9
bp) in the Te. nigroviridis genome. The mean intron
length in D. holocanthus is 566 bp which is obviously
greater than that in the smooth pufferfish. The mean
intron length in three-spined stickleback is clearly greater
than that in the pufferfish. Because of the non-normal
distribution of intron size (Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, p = 4.82e-007), the Wilcoxon signed rank test, a
non-parametric test, was adopted and detected a significant differences in the intron lengths between D. holocanthus and T. rubripes (p = 2.96e-022), between D.
holocanthus and Te. nigroviridis (P = 5.30e-003), between
D. holocanthus and G. aculeatus (P = 2.52e-013), between
G. aculeatus and T. rubripes (P = 1.31e-019), and between
G. aculeatus and Te. nigroviridis (P = 1.56e-006).
Repetitive elements in pufferfish genome

The different accumulation of repeat elements is recognized as a prominent force in genome size variation.
Therefore, we examined the sequenced BAC clones and
the smooth pufferfish genomes for evidence of repeat elements (Table 5). In total, 431 tracts of repeat element

were detected in the sequenced spiny pufferfish genome.
The total length of repeat elements was approximately 62
kb and accounted for 7.94% of the sequenced BAC clones.
No small RNA or satellite repeats were detected. Simple
repeats and low complexity repeats accounted for 0.75%
and 0.46% of the sequenced spiny pufferfish genome,
respectively. Our analysis result showed 6.73% of the
sequenced BAC clones to match interspersed repeats. A
large fraction of the interspersed repeats was contributed
by retroelements (6.00% of the BAC clone sequences),
whereas 0.66% comprised DNA transposons and 0.07%
unclassified interspersed repeats. We catalogued the
transposable elements in the sequenced BAC clones in
detail, and identified 21 subfamilies of transposable elements belonging to 12 known families (Table 6). The long
interspersed repetitive elements (LINEs) constituted
more than half the transposable elements and 3.44% of
the BAC sequences. Four LINE families, LINE1, LINE2,
Rex1/Babar, and RTE, were detected, with 29 copies
Expander representing the RTE family and 13 copies
Maui belonging to the L2 family. Two short interspersed
repetitive element (SINE) families V-SINE (81 copies) and
Mermaid (25 copies), were found in the BAC clone
sequences. One long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons family, Gypsy/TY3 (4 copies), were identified. Four

mariner, and Tc2, were detected and accounted for 0.66%
of the BAC clone sequences. Our analysis showed that
most of the repeat elements were distributed within
genes (e.g., 67 of 106 copies of SINEs fall into introns, as
do 77 of 135 copies of simple repeats) in the sequenced
region of the D. holocanthus genome.
To accurately estimate the contribution of repeat elements to pufferfish genome size variation, we compared
the proportion of repeat elements in the homologous
regions between the spiny pufferfish D. holocanthus and
the smooth pufferfish based on the synteny analysis
(Table 5). In the homologous regions between D. holocanthus and T. rubripes, repeat elements accounted for
approximately 19 kb and 5.16% of the sequences in D.
holocanthus, whereas the total length of the repeat elements was 6,457 bp, accounting for 2.43% of the homologous regions in T. rubripes. In the homologous regions
between D. holocanthus and Te. nigroviridis, repeat elements accounted for approximately 11 kb and 4.87% of
the sequences in D. holocanthus, whereas accounted
4,304 bp or 2.93% of homologous sequences in Te. nigroviridis. No small RNA or satellite repeats were detected
in their homologous regions. Although their sequence

lengths were almost equal, the proportion of low complexity repeats in D. holocanthus was lower than those in
the smooth pufferfish. The proportions of simple repeats
in the smooth pufferfish were much higher than that in D.
holocanthus. Unlike D. holocanthus, simple repeat elements contributed the major fraction (almost 80%) of the
repeat elements in homologous region of Te. nigroviridis.
The proportion of simple repeats was 2.34% in the Te.
nigroviridis, and was more than three times larger than it
(0.75%) in D. holocanthus. The total length of simple
repeats was 3,435 bp in Te. nigroviridis and was 1,666 bp
in D. holocanthus.
In the homologous regions between D. holocanthus and
T. rubripes, the total length of interspersed repeats was
approximately 15 kb and accounted for 4.05% of the
homologous sequences in D. holocanthus, whereas in T.
rubripes the length was 2,748 bp and accounted for 1.03%
of the homologous regions. SINEs were absent from T.
rubripes, but 39 copies of SINEs, including 30 copies of
V-SINE and 9 copies of SINE/Mermaid, were identified in
D. holocanthus. The total length of SINEs in D. holocanthus was 5,944 bp, accounting for 1.63% of the homologous regions. The proportion of the LINEs in D.

holocanthusis 2.13%, which is almost 10 times higher
than it (0.22%) in T. rubripes. In D. holocanthus 21 partial
copies of LINEs were detected, whereas there were only 3
partial copies in T. rubripes. No LTR retrotransposon was
detected in D. holocanthus, whereas 2 copies were identified in T. rubripes. Unlike retroelements, the proportion
of DNA transposons in T. rubripes was more than twice
as high as that in D. holocanthus. The proportions of the
interspersed repeats varied significantly in the homologous regions between D. holocanthus and Te. nigroviridis.
In D. holocanthus, the proportion was 3.84% (8573 bp),
with 1.15% of SINEs, 2.12% of LINEs, and 0.48% DNA
transposons. In Te. nigroviridis, the proportion is only
0.18%, with 0.08% of LINEs and 0.10% of unclassified
interspersed repeat, whereas SINEs are absent. Similar to
the distribution pattern in the sequenced D. holocanthus
genome, most of the repeat elements in D. holocanthus
fell within genes in the homologous regions shared with
the smooth pufferfish, e.g., 27 out of 37 SINE copies were
integrated within introns in its homologous regions
shared with T. rubripes and 8 out of 17 copies occurred in
the homologous region it shares with Te. nigroviridis.

Discussion
Character of the D. holocanthus genome

In recent years, the use of comparative genomic approach
to study genome size variation within a phylogenetic
framework has shed much light on the genome size varia-

tion in closely related species, such as studies in cotton
[17,18,20,21,32], in rice [10], and in Drosophila [6,22].
Here, to study the genome size variation in pufferfish,
especially the genome shrinking of the smooth pufferfish,
a total length of 776 kb of non-redundant sequences or
0.1% of the spiny pufferfish D. holocanthus genome (780
Mb) was sequenced and compared with the smooth pufferfish genomes. The GC level of the sequenced D. holocanthus genome (41.65%) is within the vertebrate range,
between 40% for Bos taurus and 48% for Sus scrofa [33],
but it is lower than it in the genome of T. rubripes
(45.46%) and Te. nigroviridis (46.43%), whereas it is close
to it in O. latipes genome (40.46%). Because GC content
represents gene density to some extent, the spiny pufferfish should have a lower gene density genome compared
with the smooth pufferfish with compact genomes. This
pattern is also supported by the proportion of coding
region in the sequenced D. holocanthus genome. The
coding region accounted for 15.5% of the assembled spiny
pufferfish genome, whereas in Te. nigroviridis it
accounted for 40% of the genome [24]. Our gene annotation results showed that the mean number of coding
exons per gene with complete CDS on average (8 when
untranslated regions are excluded) in the D. holocanthus
genome is close to that in human genome (8.7) and
mouse genome (8.4) [34], but is larger than that in the Te.
nigroviridis (6.9) genome [24]. Assuming that fish and
mammal genes have similar structures, this suggests that

our gene prediction results are trustworthy and that some
annotated genes of Te. nigroviridis are partial or fragmental as suggested by Jaillon et al. (2004) [24]. Our repeat
element analysis showed that the sequenced D. holocanthus genome contains more repeat elements, especially
the interspersed elements, than do the smooth pufferfish
genomes, which is consistent with the DNA renaturation
analysis in previous study [27]. Thus, D. holocanthus has
a lower gene density and repeat elements rich genome
compared with smooth pufferfish. It is noteworthy that
no inconsistency for the arrangement of scaffolds was
detected during comparison with the smooth pufferfish
genomes, which suggests that the order of assembled
scaffolds is reliable and implies that negligible genomic
rearrangement has occurred in the sequenced region of
the D. holocanthus genome at the scale of the BAC clones
(~100 kb).

Genome size evolution in pufferfish

Variations in genome size within and between species
have been observed since the 1950 s in diverse taxonomic
groups. Interestingly, the smooth pufferfish have the
smallest vertebrate genomes known to date, and evolved
toward a high level of compact organization. Within the
pufferfish, the genome of D. holocanthus is almost twofold larger than that of the smooth pufferfish. However,
the difference of genome size between this spiny puffer
and the smooth puffer does not appear to reflect a difference in ploidy [23], although the karyotype of D. holocanthus is unknown. The chromosome number (2n) ranges
from 34 to 44 in the smooth pufferfish, and one spiny
pufferfish D. bleekeri karyotyped to date has 46 chromosomes [35]. Parsimony analysis of the phylogenetic patterns of genome size in pufferfish suggests that the
smooth pufferfish and the spiny pufferfish should have a
plesiomorphic genome size of 800-900 Mb and that the

Guo et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:396
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/396

tiny genome of the smooth pufferfish is a derived character and unique to the smooth pufferfish [23]. Our synteny
analysis supports this conclusion to some extent, insofar
as doubled regions homologous of the smooth pufferfish
genome were not detected in the sequenced D. holocanthus genome and less than half the BAC clone sequences
can be aligned with the smooth pufferfish genomes.
Thus, the almost twofold size difference between D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish genomes must be the
result of other processes, which have contributed to this
genome size variation over the long evolution timescales.
Previous studies have revealed that intron size variation
is positively correlated with genome size variation
[11,12,22]. Compared with human, the compact genome
of T. rubripes is suggested to correlate positively with
intron size shrinking [13,36]. In our analysis, we observed
a correlation between the size of genome and intron
length in pufferfish, with the smooth pufferfish having
both smaller genomes and shorter introns compared with
D. holocanthus having relative larger genome size and
long introns. Statistical analysis showed that the difference of the average intron length between D. holocanthus
(mean of 566 bp) and the smooth pufferfish (mean of 435
bp) was statistically significant. Although only a tiny fraction of the introns was sampled in our analysis, the nearly
identical length distribution patterns (Figure 3) compared
with that in the T. rubripes genome [13] suggested that
our sampled data were not biased and the result was
robust. Additionally, G. aculeatus was used as outgroup
for intron size comparisons. Our results showed that the
intron size in the G. aculeatus genome was significantly
larger than that in pufferfish genomes, which suggested
that different the intron size variation between the
smooth pufferfish and the spiny pufferfish contributed to
their genome size variation since their divergence with G.
aculeatus. According to our analysis result, the intron
length variation involved 31 Mb sequence and accounts
for approximately 7.21% of the genome size variation
between D. holocanthus and smooth pufferfish, if 30,000
genes exist in pufferfish genome as suggested by Jaillon et
al [24]. The correlation between the genome size and
intron size in pufferfish is consistent with that observed
in Drosophila [22], bird [11], and Muntiacus muntjak
vaginalis [14], but differs from that in plants (e.g., Gossypium [21]). It seems that the correlation between intron
and genome sizes depends on both the phylogenetic distance of the organisms studied and the time of their
divergence. In fact, one explanation of to this phenomenon is that the rate of accumulation of insertions and
deletions (indels) in intron sequence has varied in different organisms over evolution time [37,38]. For example,
as one of the main insertion forces, transposable elements
affect plant and mammalian genomes in different ways.
Most transposable element insertions occur in the inter-

Page 11 of 15

genic regions of plant genomes [39,40], but within
intragenic regions (introns) of mammalian genomes [41].
As in the mammalian genomes, we found that most of the
repeat elements in the sequenced D. holocanthus genome
are mainly distributed in introns and have partially contributed to the difference of intron size between D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish. Another potential
mechanisms responsible for the intron size variation
between D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish may
be the accumulation of small indels over their evolution
time, as has occurred in the in cotton genus [32]. However, small indels cannot be detected in intron sequence
between D. holocanthus and smooth pufferfish because
of their relatively long divergence time (Figure 1). Thus,
our comparison of the intron sizes of orthologous genes
between D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish
strongly supports the proposition that intron size variation resulting from different repeat element insertions
and different accumulation of indels have contributed to
genome size difference between D. holocanthus and the
smooth pufferfish, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn in previous studies [11-14,22,36]. Overall, our
results demonstrated that genes in the D. holocanthus
genome are characterized by significant expansion in
their intron size compared with the smooth pufferfish
and accounted for genome size variation in the pufferfish.
Genome size variation takes place also within genes in
pufferfish.
In addition to intron size variation, the most potential
force responsible to genome size variation is the differential accumulation and deletion of transposable elements,
which have been observed and verified across a broad
phylogenetic range of organisms including plants [20]
and mammals [42,43]. A previous DNA renaturation
analysis showed that middle-repetitive DNA was underrepresented in the smooth pufferfish genomes compared
with a spiny pufferfish (D. hystrix) genome, and that a significantly greater abundance of a transposon-like repetitive DNA class existed in the spiny pufferfish genome
relative to the smooth pufferfish genomes [27]. In our
analysis, the proportion of repeat elements in the
sequenced D. holocanthus genome (7.94%) is higher than
that in the smooth pufferfish genomes, with 6.89% in the
T. rubripes genome and 4.66% in the Te. nigroviridis
genome. Among the repeat elements, the fraction of
interspersed repeats in the D. holocanthus genome was
much higher than that in the smooth pufferfish genomes,
but the proportion of simple repeats is lower. Our result
is consistent with the result of DNA renaturation analysis
[27]. We estimated here that the number of the interspersed repeats in the D. holocanthus genome (193,000,
calculated from 193 copies in the 0.1% sequenced
genome region) far exceeds that in the T. rubripes
genome (46,000 copies) and that in the Te. nigroviridis

Guo et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:396
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/396

genome (19,000 copies). To ensure that this pattern did
not result from sample bias because only part of the D.
holocanthus genome was available for analysis, we identified the repeat elements in the homologous regions
between D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish
genomes. This pattern recurred with an increasing discrepancy in the interspersed repeat fraction. In the
homologous regions, the proportion of interspersed
repeats in the D. holocanthus genome was nearly four
times higher than that in the T. rubripes genome and
more than 20 times higher than that in the Te. nigroviridis
genome (Table 5). We estimated that the different profiles
of repeat element sequences accounted for 12.5% of the
homologous region variation between D. holocanthus
and T. rubripes and for 8.59% between D. holocanthus
and Te. nigroviridis. In the non-homologous regions,
repeat element proportion in D. holocanthus genome
increased to 10.6% compared with T. rubripes and
increased to 9.19% compared with Te. nigroviridis. These
are obviously higher than the proportion in the
sequenced D. holocanthus genome (7.94%), and are
nearly twice as high as these in the homologous regions
(5.16% compared with T. rubripes and 4.87% compared
with Te. nigroviridis). The increasing proportion of repeat
elements in the non-homologous region indicates that
the rates of repeat element accumulation were inconsistent across different D. holocanthus genomic regions.
Distribution analysis result showed that transposable elements (e.g., SINEs) have accumulated both in the intergenic regions and introns, which have contributed to
genome size variation between D. holocanthus and the
smooth pufferfish. Previous studies have showed that the
profiles of interspersed repeats differed in the smooth
pufferfish genomes [13,24]. For example, the most common repeat in the T. rubripes genome was LINE-like element Maui, whereas in the Te. nigroviridis genome was
DNA transposon-Buffy. Unlike in the smooth pufferfish
genomes, the most common repeat in the sequenced D.
holocanthus genome was V-SINE, a kind of non-autonomous retrotransposon. Imai et al. [44] also found that
various repetitive elements accounted for genome size
variation between T. rubripes and O. latipes by analyzing
chromosome LG22 of O. latipes and its corresponding
region in T. rubripes, which is consistent with our result.
However, both the extent and types of repetitive elements
which accounted for genome size variation between T.
rubripes and O. latipes are different from our results.
More than a half (54%) of genome size variation between
T. rubripes and O. latipes was contributed by various
repetitive elements, which is much higher than that
between pufferfish in our analysis. Instead of interspersed
repeats differently accumulating, genome size variation
mainly resulted from different accumulation of unclassified low copy repeats between T. rubripes and O. latipes.

Page 12 of 15

In fact, the inconsistence between our results and Imai et
al. [44] might be due to the following reasons. Firstly, different genomic regions were selected for studying. Our
synteny analyses showed that selected genomic regions
were not overlapped between our study and Imai et al.
[44] (see Table 3). Secondly, the most conceivable reason
is that results of genome size variation study rely on phylogenetic relationship and divergent time between
selected species for comparison. T. rubripes diverged
from O. latipes before 184 million years ago in Imai et al.
[44], which is much earlier than the divergence time
between D. holocanthus and T. rubripes (50-70 Mya) in
our study (Figure 1). Although inconsistency exists, both
our study and Imai et al. [44] supported that different
content of repetitive elements accounted for genome size
shrinking of smooth pufferfish. Thus, our analysis confirmed the previous DNA renaturation analysis [27] and
demonstrated that different content of transposable elements have contributed to the genome size variation in
the pufferfish.
Our synteny alignments of the sequenced BAC clones
and the genomes of other fish species provided an overview of the genome size variation in the pufferfish.
According to the synteny identification, the sequences of
the D. holocanthus genome could be classified into the
following two regions compared with smooth pufferfish
genomes: the homologous region, which could be located
onto smooth pufferfish genomes; and the non-homologous region, which had no homology with the smooth
pufferfish genomes. We inferred that the length of the
homologous region in D. holocanthus genome was at
least 1.37 times longer than that in the T. rubripes
genome (364 kb vs 265 kb, respectively), and was 1.52
times longer than that in the Te. nigroviridis genome (223
kb vs 148 kb, respectively). Therefore, we deduced that
the length of the homologous region between D. holocanthus and T. rubripes was 364 Mb in the D. holocanthus
genome and was 266 Mb in the T. rubripes genome, and
that between D. holocanthus and Te. nigroviridis was 224
Mb in D. holocanthus and was 147 Mb in Te. nigroviridis.
This analysis implied that genome size variation between
D. holocanthus and smooth pufferfish was partially
exhibited as length variations between the homologous
regions. Also the lengths of their non-homologous
sequences are different; in particular the length of the
non-homologous sequence in D. holocanthus is longer
than that in smooth pufferfish. This is partially explained
by the finding that repeat element proportion in D. holocanthus genome increased to 10.6% compared with T.
rubripes and increased to 9.19% compared with Te. nigroviridis in the non-homologous regions. Interestingly, T.
rubripes and Te. nigroviridis have such different amounts
of sequence both in homologous and non- homologous
region compared with D. holocanthus. With 2 smooth

pufferfish sharing most of the biological traits and equal
divergence time with D. holocanthus, one explanation for
this result is different generation time between T.
rubripes and Te. nigroviridis. The generation time of Te.
nigroviridis is much shorter (about 1 year) compared with
T. rubripes (3-4 years), which make they have different
evolutionary rate and result in their different genome
similarity compared with D. holocanthus. A fraction of D.
holocanthus genomic sequences was not homologous
with other fish genomes (e.g., G. aculeatus and O. latipes)
and might be the D. holocanthus genome-specific
sequence. This part of the D. holocanthus genome-specific sequence accounted for 12.1% or approximately 94
Mb of the D. holocanthus genome and contributed
approximately 21.86% of genome size variation between
D. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish. Using G. aculeatus and O. latipes as reference species, we found that a
fraction of the homologous region of the D. holocanthus
genome (0.1%) might have been lost in the two smooth
pufferfish genomes. These results suggested that genome
size variation between D. holocanthus and the smooth
pufferfish was exhibited as the length variation in the
homologous region and different levels of the nonhomologous sequence accumulation.
The interest in the genome size variation among the
pufferfish mainly arises from that the smooth pufferfish
have the smallest vertebrate genomes yet measured. If D.
holocanthus and smooth pufferfish genomes are presently at equilibrium with regard to their size and the tiny
genome is a derived character and unique to the smooth
pufferfish [23], the difference in genome size between the
pufferfish implies that an ancestral equilibrium was disturbed in the smooth tetraodontid lineage following its
divergence from the spiny diodontids. The mechanisms
of genome size evolution in the pufferfish have been
debated in previous studies [13,27]. Aparicio et al. [13]
suggested that the rapid deletion of nonfunctional
sequences may be the predominant mechanism accounting for the compact genome of T. rubripes. Neafsey and
Palumbi [27] proposed that a reduction in the rate of
large insertions in the smooth puffer, rather than an
increase in large deletions, can explain their genomic
contraction and difference in size between the smooth
and spiny puffer genomes. They also proposed that different transposable element activity might be the main
driving force that is responsible for genome size variation
between the smooth and spiny puffer genomes. In this
study, although the difference amount of repeat elements
itself was insufficient to explain the two-fold difference in
genome size between D. holocanthus and smooth pufferfish, this might be due to that mutations have made many
ancient transposable elements unrecognizable. However,
we verified that amount and content of transposable ele-

Page 13 of 15

ments is different between D. holocanthus and the
smooth pufferfish. Especially, LINEs with self transposable ability are more prevalent in D. holocanthus than
that in smooth pufferfish, which means that transposable
element activity is different between D. holocanthus and
the smooth pufferfish. Therefore, our results indicated
that the difference of transposable element activity contributed to and genome size variation between D. holocanthus and smooth pufferfish and that a reduction in the
rate of large insertions caused by transposable elements is
responsible to smooth pufferfish genomic contraction as
proposed by Neafsey and Palumbi [27].

Conclusions
To study the genome size variation in the pufferfish, 10
BAC clones of the spiny pufferfish D. holocanthus were
shotgun sequenced. In total, 776 kb of non-redundant
sequences without gaps, constituting 0.1% of the D. holocanthus genome, were identified. Sequence analysis
showed that D. holocanthus has a low gene density and
repeat elements rich genome compared with the smooth
pufferfish. Further analysis showed that D. holocanthus
genome is characterized by longer introns and more
interspersed repeats compared with the smooth pufferfish genomes. Our analysis also showed that the genome
size variation between D. holocanthus and smooth pufferfish exhibits as the length variation in the homologous
region and the different accumulation of the non-homologous sequence. Our results showed intron size variation
was consistent with genome size variation between D.
holocanthus and smooth pufferfish. We verified that different amount and content of repeat elements, especially
the different accumulation of transposable elements, are
responsible for the genome size variation between D.
holocanthus and smooth pufferfish.
Methods
BAC clone selection, shotgun sequencing, and assembly

Ten BAC clones of around 100 kb were stochastically
selected from a BAC library of the spiny pufferfish D.
holocanthus and were sequenced using a standard shotgun strategy. Purified Escherichia coli genomic DNA-free
plasmid DNA was sheared using a HydroShear (Genomic
SolutionsÂ®). The resulting fragments were selected for a
size range of 1.5-3.0 kb and extracted by agarose gel electrophoresis (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit). The selected
fragments were randomly inserted into the pUC118 vector (TaKaRa) with T4 ligase (Promega). Sequence reads of
randomly selected sub-clones were generated from a single end using with the universal vector M13 primers.
After a sequence redundancy of more than threefold
had been generated, a total of 9,286 high-quality reads
were edited and assembled using the Phred/Phrap/

Consed program package [45-47]. The resultant contigs
were then joined into scaffolds based on read-pair associations and order information from the shotgun clones.
Then interspersed repeats were then masked in the
scaffolds of each BAC by RepeatMasker (version open3.1.5) using a repeat library (RepBase14.01) [48]. Masked
scaffolds were compared with genomic sequences of T.
rubripes and Te. nigroviridis using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm with the default
parameters[30]. The BLAST results were first clustered
on the basis of colinearity for further screening. Manual
inspection readily identified spurious hits which are
mainly resulted from repetitive sequences and are not
identified by RepeatMasker, and poor hits (identical base
pairs < 100) arising from lineage divergence. After removing these spurious hits, we ordered and oriented as many
super-scaffolds as possible within the same BAC clone by
comparison with the genomes of T. rubripes and Te.
nigroviridis, and the gaps were represented with 100 Ns.

the hit regions; more than two hits occurred between the
query and the subject sequence, or if only one hit
occurred, the hit length is longer than 300 bp. Homologous sequences were extracted using Perl scripts. The
results were manually inspected and the synteny maps
were visualized using the Artemis Comparison Tool
(ACT) [50].
Repetitive element identification in D. holocanthus
genome sequences was accomplished through RepeatMasker (version open-3.1.5), CENSOR [51], and BLAST
similarity searches against known elements in REPBASE
(version 14.01) [48] and GenBank. Repetitive elements
were also identified using RepeatMasker (version open3.1.5) in the T. rubripes and Te. nigroviridis genome with
their genome sequences from the Ensembl DNA dataset
(release 52). The repeat elements in the homologous
regions between the spiny pufferfish D. holocanthus and
the smooth pufferfish were identified, according to the
genomic synteny analyses.

Sequence annotation and data analyses

Additional material

An integrative gene annotation process was performed
mainly based on the Ensembl pipeline of gene annotation
with some modifications [49]. Two ab initio gene prediction programs, FgenesH 2.6 [28] and GENSCAN 1.0 [29]
were firstly adopted to make de novo gene prediction.
TBLASTN [30] combined with GeneWise [31] analyses
were then used for further gene predication. TBLASTN
allows similarity searches against peptides database, and
it was used with an E value of 1 Ã 10-6 as the cutoff for
identifying potential orthologous genes in the T. rubripes
genome and the Te. nigroviridis genome in the Ensembl
protein dataset (release 52). In total, 144 candidate peptides were identified in the T. rubripes genome and 67 in
the Te. nigroviridis genome, and those showing more
than 50% of identity and 70% of peptide length were
maintained. This part of peptides was subsequently subjected to GeneWise analysis against the D. holocanthus
genome sequence, taking into account splice sites and
frameshifts. The best predictions were considered as
overlapping results with above annotation steps and were
integrated together to yield a summary of the annotated
genes. This set of predictions was then manually filtered
for redundancy resulted from alternative splicing or paralogous genes. The final predicted outputs were used as
the input for the BLASTP [30] searches against the nonredundant GenBank protein database to assign their possible identity.
Genomic synteny were identified using BLASTN [30]
searches between the sequenced D. holocanthus genome
and the genomes of T. rubripes, Te. nigroviridis, G. aculeatus, and O. latipes. The criteria used to filter the
BLASTN results were as follows: more than 50% identity
and 70% of the query sequence length were maintained in
