Abstract
Background: Motivated by the precarious state of the world’s coral reefs, there is currently a keen interest in coral
transcriptomics. By identifying changes in coral gene expression that are triggered by particular environmental
stressors, we can begin to characterize coral stress responses at the molecular level, which should lead to the
development of more powerful diagnostic tools for evaluating the health of corals in the field. Furthermore, the
identification of genetic variants that are more or less resilient in the face of particular stressors will help us to
develop more reliable prognoses for particular coral populations. Toward this end, we performed deep mRNA
sequencing of the cauliflower coral, Pocillopora damicornis, a geographically widespread Indo-Pacific species that
exhibits a great diversity of colony forms and is able to thrive in habitats subject to a wide range of human
impacts. Importantly, P. damicornis is particularly amenable to laboratory culture. We collected specimens from
three geographically isolated Hawaiian populations subjected to qualitatively different levels of human impact. We
isolated RNA from colony fragments ("nubbins”) exposed to four environmental stressors (heat, desiccation,
peroxide, and hypo-saline conditions) or control conditions. The RNA was pooled and sequenced using the 454
platform.
Description: Both the raw reads (n = 1, 116, 551) and the assembled contigs (n = 70, 786; mean length = 836
nucleotides) were deposited in a new publicly available relational database called PocilloporaBase http://www.
PocilloporaBase.org. Using BLASTX, 47.2% of the contigs were found to match a sequence in the NCBI database at
an E-value threshold of ≤.001; 93.6% of those contigs with matches in the NCBI database appear to be of
metazoan origin and 2.3% bacterial origin, while most of the remaining 4.1% match to other eukaryotes, including
algae and amoebae.
Conclusions: P. damicornis now joins the handful of coral species for which extensive transcriptomic data are
publicly available. Through PocilloporaBase http://www.PocilloporaBase.org, one can obtain assembled contigs and
raw reads and query the data according to a wide assortment of attributes including taxonomic origin, PFAM
motif, KEGG pathway, and GO annotation.

Background
Over the long-term, populations can respond to stressful
environmental conditions via adaptive evolution. However, over the short-term, organisms under stress must
alter their physiology or behavior, and doing so commonly involves changes in gene expression. Therefore, if

we are to understand how organisms respond to stress,
we must understand how stress alters gene expression.
In recent years, a number of microarray studies have
been undertaken to reconstruct the gene expression
profiles of corals under stress [1-6]. However, the chipbased approaches used to date have not been able to
evaluate the full scope of the stress response because
only a fraction of potential transcripts have been represented on the chips. In the absence of a tiling array,
whose production must await the sequencing and

complete assembly of a coral genome, next-generation
sequencing technologies are the only available approach
for characterizing the full scope of the transcriptional
response to stress. Currently, there is no complete coral
genome available, and the most closely related genome
that is publicly available is that of the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis [7].
In the environment, corals are exposed to a variety of
natural and anthropogenic stressors. Once the stressors
reach a tipping point, dramatic physiological changes
can occur very abruptly, including bleaching, which
involves the expulsion of all symbiotic zooxanthellae
[8-15]. While the loss of symbionts may be adaptive in
the short-term, once bleaching occurs, if a coral colony
continues to experience stressful conditions, it will
rapidly succumb–scleractinian corals cannot persist
indefinitely as heterotrophs. Therefore, a critical component of coral resilience is their ability to stave off
bleaching through molecular stress-response
mechanisms.
To date, the identification of “stress response genes”
in corals and other cnidarians has been based largely on
homology to functionally characterized genes in other
animals (e.g., [16]). This approach has validity, as there
is accumulating evidence that many cnidarian stress
responses are likely to be largely homologous to those
of triploblastic animals. However, given the long history
of the Cnidaria as an independent evolutionary lineage
and the many unique aspects of their biology, the cnidarian stress response repertoire is also certain to differ
in key respects from that of other animals.
Fortunately, the development of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches has facilitated the de
novo identification of cnidarian stress response genes.
Over the last few years, a number of scleractinian transcriptomic datasets have been made available (Table 1),
including EST collections produced by Sanger sequencing (e.g., Montastrea faveolata, Acropora palmata,
Acropora millepora; [4,17-19]) or “next generation” pyrosequencing (e.g., Acropora millepora, Acropora hyacinthus, Porites compressa, and Porites asteroides; [20]).
Many of these projects have focused on the effects of

heat stress on the physiology of the corals and their
symbiotic algae, Symbiodinium [2,17,19-21].
As part of this global effort to characterize the coral
stress response at the level of gene expression, we have
produced a reference transcriptome for the cauliflower
coral, Pocillopora damicornis (Linnaeus, 1758) using
adult colonies collected in Hawaii. We chose P. damicornis because of its wide distribution across the IndoPacific, its recognized ability to tolerate environmental
stressors that prove insurmountable to many other species, and the relative ease of maintaining it in the
laboratory setting. In addition, with respect to transcriptomic data, P. damicornis represents a relatively undersampled branch of the “robust corals” clade (Figure 1)
[22], so data from this species is phylogenetically complementary to existing data from Acropora and Porites
(two genera of complex corals) and Montastrea (a distantly related robust coral). RNA was isolated from colony nubbins that had been exposed to one of four
different biologically relevant stressors (heat, desiccation,
peroxide, and hypo-saline conditions) in addition to
unstressed, control nubbins. We sampled colonies from
three geographically isolated sites that are subjected to
qualitatively different degrees of anthropogenic disturbance. The raw data, as well as assembled contigs, have
been placed in a publicly accessible, BLAST-searchable
relational database called PocilloporaBase.

Construction and content
PocilloporaBase Database Construction

PocilloporaBase is a relational database constructed in
PostgreSQL (version 8.4.4). It houses the P. damicornis
contigs generated in this study in addition to the results
from a number of bioinformatics analyses performed on
these contigs. The database structure and entity relationships are depicted in Additional File 1.
The database comprises thirteen tables, eight entity
tables and five relations tables. The “Contigs” table
houses output from the assembly including the nucleotide sequence of each contig and other key features of
the contig, including its length in nucleotides, possible
start sites, the total number of reads used to build the

contig, and the average sequencing coverage of each
nucleotide position within the contig. Through the
“Hmm” table, each contig ID (CID) is linked to 0, 1 or
more protein family IDs (PFID) based on a search of
Pfam (an HMM search implemented in Perl was used to
compare each of the P. damicornis contigs to the conserved protein domains housed at Pfam; ftp://ftp.sanger.
ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/Tools/OldPfamScan/pfam_scan.pl). The “Pfam” table links each PFID to the name
and description of the relevant protein domain.
BLASTX output is summarized in the “Blast” table.
Here, each CID is associated with up to five protein
sequences in NCBI that produced significant BLASTX
hits to the relevant P. damicornis contig. Various
metrics from the BLAST hits are linked to each protein
identifier (PID) including the BLAST alignment length,
the bit score, the expect score, and the number of identical amino acids. Through an “Annotation” table, the

PIDs are cross-referenced with gene ontology IDs
(GOID). The “Ontology” table links each GOID to the
name and description of the relevant gene ontology
term. The “Species” table relates each PID to the species
from which the corresponding protein sequence was
derived and indicates whether that species is a known
symbiont of P. damicornis. The “Accession” table crossreferences each PID with the corresponding mRNA ID
(MID) if this information is available in NCBI. The
“mRNA” table links these MIDs to the corresponding
mRNA name and nucleotide sequence. Through the
“Tapp” table, each PID may be cross-referenced to 0, 1,
or more biochemical pathways housed in the KEGG
database. The “Kegg” table associates each Kegg ID
(KID) with the name and definition of the corresponding biochemical pathway.
The database can be accessed via an HTML interface
at http://www.PocilloporaBase.org. Users can query the

database via any one of ten different search terms
(described in detail in the Utility and Discussion section). Database queries are generated using the Python
programming language, version 2.6.5, and the PyGreSQL
DB-API module. Web pages summarizing the search
results are produced as needed via Python scripts that
generate HTML output. The database is hosted on a
computer running Ubuntu Linux 10.04.2 using the
Apache HTTP Server (version 2.2.14).
Adult coral RNA extraction, and sequencing

Adult P. damicornis colonies were collected from three
geographically isolated populations in Oahu, Hawaii
(Figure 2). Coconut Island, on the northeastern corner
of Oahu, is considered to be “recovering” from significant human impacts [23]. Sand Island, off the southern
coast of Oahu, just west of Honolulu, abuts a heavily

industrialized area that houses the chief sewage treatment plant for all of metropolitan Honolulu [24]. Relative to these two sites, Waimanalo, on the eastern side
of Oahu is relatively un-impacted by human activity.
Three to four individual colonies were collected from
each site.
Upon collection, each colony was fragmented into
nubbins, and the nubbins were kept in an outdoor seawater table for two weeks before being subjected to a
range of biologically relevant stressors administered in
a controlled laboratory setting. The stressors included
desiccation (four hours out of water), hypo-saline
shock (two hours in fresh water), heat shock (50°C for
1 hour), and peroxide exposure (2 hours in sea water
supplemented with 10% peroxide). Total RNA from
stressed and control nubbins was extracted using Trizol [25]. To produce the reference transcriptome

Hawaii: Coconut Island, a site found on the north eastern corner of Oahu; Sand Island, a site found on the southern part of Oahu, just west of
Honolulu; and Waimanalo a site found on the eastern side of Oahu.

described here, aliquots of all the individual RNA samples were pooled prior to sequencing. The pooled
RNA sample was then shipped to Beckman Coulter for
preparation of a non-normalized library and sequencing using the 454 sequencing technology [26,27] (Figure 3). The remainder of each individual RNA sample
is being sequenced separately on the Illumina platform
so that we might identify transcriptional changes associated with particular stressors (unpublished data).
Three RNA samples (one from each location) were
submitted to the Ocean Genome Legacy’s Ocean Genome Resource database (accession numbers: S06518,
S06519, and S06520).
Assembly, Identification of contigs, and Pfam domain
searches

After sequencing, short reads (< 40 nucleotides) and low
quality reads that did not overlap with other sequencing

Page 5 of 11

reads were discarded, and the remaining 955, 910
sequencing reads were assembled at Beckman Coulter
using MIRA3 [28]. High quality singletons were
included with the contigs in all subsequent analyses.
Contig sequences were blasted against the adaptor
sequences used for both the library preparation and the
sequencing to insure that none of the contig sequences
were contaminated with adaptors. Adaptor sequences
were trimmed, and the assembled contigs were used to
sequentially query the NCBI non-redundant protein
database using BLASTX with an E-value cut-off of
0.001. The top five gene hits were assigned to each contig. All five of the top hits usually agreed on gene ontology and taxonomy, but where they disagreed, we
associated multiple GO terms and multiple possible
taxonomic affinities with a given contig. In order to
identify conserved protein domains, all six open reading
frames were blasted against the protein domain database

Hawaii and exposed to five environmentally relevant stressors (heat, desiccation, peroxide, and hypo-saline conditions) or control conditions.
RNA was extracted from healthy populations and stressed populations and pooled together. (RNA isolated from four colony/treatments was not
of sufficient quality (black x’s) to be used in library preparation, so it was not subjected to further processing.) Library construction, sequencing,
and assembly were performed by Agencourt Genomic Services (now Beckman Coulter Genomics); sequencing was performed on the 454
sequencing platform.

at Pfam [29]. Hits were retained only if they had an evalue cut off lower than 0.001.
GO term and KEGG analysis

Using the top five hits from the BLASTX search
described above, each contig was assigned a list of associated protein GI numbers. GI numbers were converted
to Entrez Gene IDs using the gene2accession conversion
file from NCBI. Gene2go was then used to obtain relevant GO annotation for the five top BLASTX hits to
each P. damicornis contig, and the GO term(s) were
then associated with their respective contig. Protein GI
numbers were cross-referenced to species-specific
KEGG pathways [30]. Using KEGG’s lists of annotated
plants and animals, these pathways were organized into
corresponding lists, and generalized KEGG pathway Ids
were obtained. KEGG pathway analysis was then performed, and individual contigs were then mapped to different biochemical pathways using IPath [22]. The top 5
hits were chosen to increase the probability of finding a
hit that would allow pairing each contig with its corresponding GO category and with the existent KEGG
data. Using photosynthesis as an example, the top hits
matched to Symbiodinium sequences, not plants.
Because Symbiodinium is not represented within the
KEGG database, the contigs did not appear to represent
enzymes involved in photosynthesis, when, in fact, they
did.

Utility and Discussion
Sequencing yield

Sequencing yielded 1, 116, 551 raw reads with an average length of 379 nucleotides (range: 29-2, 025 nt; SD =
152 nt). Reads less than 40 nucleotides in length and
low quality reads that did not overlap with other reads
were discarded. The remaining 955, 105 reads were
assembled into 70, 786 contigs with an average length of
836 nt (range: 40-10, 512 nt; SD = 464 nt; Additional
File 2; 3). These data are compared with other published
scleractinian transcriptomic data sets in Table 1.
Taxonomic affinity of the sequences

We used the top hit in a BLASTX [PMID: 2231712]
search to characterize each of the assembled contigs
according to its apparent taxonomic affinity. Overall,
47.2% (or 33, 423) of the contigs matched sequences
housed at NCBI with an E-value cutoff of 0.001. The
other 37, 363 contigs did not match sequences at NCBI
with an E-value of ≤.001 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. Of the 33, 423 hits, 31, 271 appeared
metazoan, 139 fungal, 36 viral, 764 eubacterial, and 26
archaeal (Figure 4). We classified 1187 hits as “other
eukaryote;” when these other eukaryotic hits were
parsed further, 142 matched a sequence from

Page 6 of 11

Symbiodinium, the genus of unicellular algae that are
intracellular endosymbionts of hermatypic corals (Table
2). For a complete breakdown of BLAST matches to
other eukaryotes including dinoflagellates, see Additional Files 4, 5.
The taxonomy of Pocillopora is currently regarded as
tenuous, e.g., some 16 species have been defined on the
basis of morphological features, but cladistic groupings
defined by molecular sequence data are not always congruent with these morphologically defined taxa (e.g.,
[31]). We used reciprocal blast searches to investigate
whether the sequences we generated in this study most
closely resemble P. damicornis sequences in NCBI,
rather than sequences from other closely related corals,
including other Pocillopora species. We obtained 400 “P.
damicornis“ ESTs obtained from NCBI, and we used
these to query the contigs housed at PocilloporaBase
(blastn with an E-value cut-off of 0.001). Because a substantial fraction of the P. damicornis sequences currently
housed at NCBI represent multiple copies of the same
gene (generated in population genetics studies,) many of
them matched to the same contig in PocilloporaBase.
Overall, the 400 sequences from NCBI matched to 21
unique contigs at PocilloporaBase. We blasted these 21
contigs back against all nucleotide sequences at NCBI
classified as scleractinian (Search “Scleractinia[Organism]”). The results are provided in Additional File 6. In
6 of 21 instances, the only match in the database was to
a P. damicornis sequence. In 12 instances, there were
matches to other corals in addition to P. damicornis,
but the highest degree of sequence identity was to a
sequence from P. damicornis. In one instance, a contig
from PocilloporaBase exhibited equal percent identity to
sequences from P. damicornis and P. meandrina. Finally,
there were two contigs that exhibited a slightly higher
resemblance to a sequence from a coral other than P.
damicornis. On balance, these results clearly suggest
that the “P. damicornis“ populations sampled in this
study exhibit greater sequence similarity to the P. damicornis sequences housed at NCBI than to any other
coral species represented in that database. However, the
taxonomic uncertainty of greatest concern pertains specifically to the genus Pocillopora. Here, the results are
less decisive. Only seven of the twenty-one contig
sequences we blasted against the NCBI database produced hits to sequences from P. damicornis and another
Pocillopora species. In five of these seven instances, the
top hit was to a P. damicornis sequence, but one contig
matches better to P. molokensis and another matches
equally well to P. damicornis and P. meandrina.

and content); 7, 084 contigs had a unique GO annotation. All of the GO terms that were attributed to at
least 100 contigs are summarized in Figure 5 (for a
complete listing, see Additional File 7).
KEGG Pathway Analysis

The contigs were subjected to the KEGG Pathway analysis, for human and plant separately [30]. Based on this
analysis, the P. damicornis sequences were mapped to
metabolic pathways on the interactive tree of life [32].
Components of most metabolic pathways were identified, including photosynthesis (KEGG id: map00195 and
00196) and lipid metabolism. However, some pathways
were largely or completely absent from the P.

damicornis contigs, including aminosugars metabolism
(00530), lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (00540), peptidoglycan biosynthesis (00550), glycosphingolipid biosynthesis (00602), methane metabolism (00680),
androgen and estrogen metabolism (00150), and biodegradation of most xenobiotics (Additional Files 8, 9).
PocilloporaBase: capabilities and functions

cnidarians. All of the raw sequencing reads generated in
this study as well as the assembled contigs can be downloaded there. At present, unlike StellaBase, PocilloporaBase houses only transcriptome data and no genomic
sequence data. This repository will grow as future mRNA
and genomic sequencing projects generate additional data
for Pocillopora damicornis.
The assembled contigs housed at PocilloporaBase can
be searched using several different modalities (Figure 6).
The Contig Search allows you to query sequences using
NCBI Protein Accession Number (e.g.: 74000907),
Nucleotide Accession Number (e.g.: 33340018), Gene/
Protein Name (e.g., ‘hemoglobin’), or Species Name/
Taxon ID (e.g.: ‘otolemur’ or 45351). The option of
searching the data by organism is critical, since corals
can be considered a holobiont consisting of coral host,
symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium), bacteria and fungi.
The Gene Ontology Search allows you to query
sequences using either GO id or GO description terms

[36]. Each successful query returns a table that contains
the Protein ID and Protein Name, as well as GO id, GO
description, and GO type. The Protein ID links to the
protein’s entry at NCBI. The Protein Name links to a
Protein Lookup on PocilloporaBase, which returns a list
of P. damicornis contigs that generated significant
BLAST hits to the protein in question. The GO id links
to the corresponding gene ontology page at the amiGO
database. Clicking on the GO description link performs
a more specific GO lookup if any gene ontology terms
are children of the parent term used to conduct the original search. If too many results are returned, searches
can be restricted to one of the three principal gene
ontology types: biological process, cellular component,
or molecular function. If the user is more interested in
the number rather than the identity of the genes in the
database that map to a particular gene ontology term,
the “Counts only” box can be checked.
The KEGG Pathway Search allows you to query
sequences using a KEGG ID number (e.g., hsa00010) or
KEGG Pathway Description (e.g., Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis). Each successful query returns a table with individual contigs identified by their Contig ID, the E-value
of their match to a protein in the KEGG database, the
KEGG Organism ID, homologous protein name and
protein accession ID.
The presence of conserved protein motifs in one or
more transcripts can be investigated by searching the
data for matches to the conserved protein motifs housed
at Pfam. The Pfam Protein Family Classification search
allows you to query sequences by Pfam Accession number (e.g., PF00006), Motif Name (e.g.: PAX, actin,
DNA_methylase) or Protein Description key words. If
there is a match to a conserved protein motif at Pfam,
the search returns a table of Pocillopora damicornis contigs encoding that motif sorted by E-value.
It is also possible to search for matches to a query
sequence using the complete set of BLAST options.
BLAST searches return contig id, the sequence for that
contig, as well as the NCBI gene ID, gene name, and
the gene sequence for any gene sequence found to
match the original blast query. A gene search page
allows for quick retrieval of gene and species information in the database.

Conclusions
We used the 454 sequencing platform to generate a
reference transcriptome for the cauliflower coral, P.
damicornis. A taxonomic analysis of the sequence data
indicates that we have captured some of the diversity of
the coral holobiont, as many of the sequences appear to
be derived from non-metazoan taxa including bacteria,
fungi, viruses, and unicellular algae of the genus Symbiodinium. The data have been organized into a publicly

Figure 6 Functionality of PocilloporaBase. PocilloporaBase houses the raw sequencing reads generated in this study as well as the assembled
contigs that were generated from the sequencing reads and the output from a number of bioinformatic analyses performed on the contigs. The
contigs were used to search the non-redundant database at NCBI using BLASTX. The contigs were also used to conduct an HMM search of the
Pfam database to identify conserved protein motifs. The proteins producing significant matches to P. damicornis contigs in the BLAST search
were cross-referenced with biochemical pathways at KEGG and with gene ontology terms at amiGO. Users can search the Pocillopora contigs
based on features of the protein they matched in the BLAST search or conserved Pfam protein domains they appear to encode. Users can also
search either the contigs or the raw reads using BLAST, and all of the sequencing reads and contigs can be downloaded from the site. Steps
taken to populate the database are represented by blue arrows. Actions available to the user are represented by red arrows.
