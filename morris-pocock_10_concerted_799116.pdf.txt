Concerted evolution of duplicated mitochondrial
control regions in three related seabird species
James A Morris-Pocock*, Scott A Taylor, Tim P Birt, Vicki L Friesen

Abstract
Background: Many population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) assume that
mitochondrial genomes do not undergo recombination. Recently, concerted evolution of duplicated mitochondrial
control regions has been documented in a range of taxa. Although the molecular mechanism that facilitates
concerted evolution is unknown, all proposed mechanisms involve mtDNA recombination.
Results: Here, we document a duplication of a large region (cytochrome b, tRNAThr, tRNAPro, ND6, tRNAGlu and the
control region) in the mitochondrial genome of three related seabird species. To investigate the evolution of
duplicate control regions, we sequenced both control region copies (CR1 and CR2) from 21 brown (Sula
leucogaster), 21 red-footed (S. sula) and 21 blue-footed boobies (S. nebouxii). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that
the duplicated control regions are predominantly evolving in concert; however, approximately 51 base pairs at the
5’ end of CR1 and CR2 exhibited a discordant phylogenetic signal and appeared to be evolving independently.
Conclusions: Both the structure of the duplicated region and the conflicting phylogenetic signals are remarkably
similar to a pattern found in Thalassarche albatrosses, which are united with boobies in a large clade that includes
all procellariiform and most pelecaniform seabirds. Therefore we suggest that concerted evolution of duplicated
control regions either is taxonomically widespread within seabirds, or that it has evolved many times.

Background
Concerted evolution of nuclear gene families is well
documented and recognized as a fundamental force that
influences genetic variation at many nuclear loci [1].
However, concerted evolution of mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) has received much less attention. The gene
content of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes is highly
conserved and consists of 37 genes (13 protein coding
genes, two rRNA genes and 22 tRNA genes) and a noncoding control region involved in the initiation of transcription and replication [2]. While this same suite of
genes is present in all vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, gene order is highly variable. For example, at least
four common gene orders exist for birds alone [3].
Additionally, many avian mitochondrial genomes possess two copies of some genes due to gene duplication
(e.g., [4,5]). Traditional theory suggests that mtDNA
gene duplication followed by deletion or degeneracy of
one of the duplicated copies may lead to mtDNA gene

rearrangements [2]. Degenerate copies of mitochondrial
genes and non-coding regions have been found in many
taxa, including at least four orders of birds [6]. However,
duplicated mtDNA genes and non-coding regions have
also been found where both copies appear functional
(see [4,5] for examples in birds). Remarkably, in some
vertebrate mtDNA genomes where the non-coding control region has been duplicated, both copies appear
functional and extreme sequence similarity between the
copies suggests that the two control regions are evolving
in concert (e.g., [7]).
Although concerted evolution of vertebrate duplicated
mtDNA regions is becoming increasingly documented, a
number of important questions remain. First, the taxonomic extent of concerted evolution of duplicated
regions is not well understood within birds. Concerted
evolution of duplicated control regions has been documented in both Amazona parrots and Thalassarche
albatrosses [4,5], even though parrots and albatrosses
are phylogenetically very divergent [8]. It remains to be
seen whether other avian species closely related to either
albatrosses or parrots also have duplicate control regions

that evolve in concert. Second, the implications of
mtDNA concerted evolution for phylogeographic and
phylogenetic research are still unclear. If mtDNA
regions typically used for phylogeographic research are
often duplicated and evolve in concert, then particular
care may be needed to amplify homologous regions in
all individuals in a study. On the other hand, Tatarenkov and Avise [7] documented that the rate of gene
conversion responsible for concerted evolution of duplicated mitochondrial control regions of mangrove killifish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) was extremely fast
compared to the nucleotide substitution rate within the
control regions. Therefore, duplicated copies within
individuals were more closely related to each other than
either was to copies from other individuals. In cases like
this, amplification of non-homologous regions should
not seriously affect phylogeographic inference. Third,
although many studies have investigated concerted evolution of mitochondrial control regions, few have investigated evolution of duplicated regions adjacent to the
control region. Knowledge of concerted evolution in
these regions may be of particular importance because
many genes adjacent to the control region (e.g., cytochrome b, ND6, 12S rRNA) are used in population
genetic and phylogenetic research. Moreover, the pattern of sequence evolution around duplicated control
regions may provide insight into the molecular mechanism responsible for concerted evolution of duplicated
mtDNA.
The Sulidae is a small family of seabirds that consists
of seven booby species and three gannet species [9,10].
The most recent avian molecular phylogeny, estimated
from 19 nuclear loci, unites the Sulidae in a large clade
that contains all other water birds and importantly, the
albatrosses (Aves: Diomedeidae; [8]). Here we present
evidence of a large duplication of the mitochondrial
genome in the evolutionary history of the Sulidae. We
investigate the evolution of the duplicated regions in
three species: brown (Sula leucogaster), red-footed (S.
sula) and blue-footed boobies (S. nebouxii). Finally, we
discuss the implications of animal mtDNA concerted
evolution in the context of traditional phylogeographic
studies.

Methods
Sample collection

We obtained tissue samples from 21 brown, 21 redfooted and 21 blue-footed boobies from throughout
their breeding ranges (Table 1). Brown booby samples
from Johnston Atoll and red-footed booby samples from
Johnston Atoll, North Keeling Island and Aldabra Atoll
consisted of growing feathers collected from chicks
caught at nests. All other samples consisted of blood
taken from adults or chicks caught at nests. We

extracted DNA using either a standard phenol/chloroform technique [11] or the DNeasy® tissue kit, following
the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Mississauaga).
Laboratory methods

Initial attempts to amplify and sequence the mitochondrial control region in all three species using conserved
avian primers failed to produce unambiguous sequence.
Specifically, while PCR products yielded clear sequence
at the 3’ end of the control region, superimposed peaks
of two nucleotides at single sites were consistently present in chromatograms at the 5’ end, rendering accurate
base calling impossible. Among other possibilities (see
Results), the presence of a duplicated control region was
suspected. Therefore we used long-template PCR (LTPCR; Expand Long Template PCR System®, Roche
Applied Science, Manheim, Germany) to verify the presence and investigate the structure of potentially duplicated control regions. All long template PCR reactions
were performed in 50 μL reactions containing 1 unit of
1× Expand Long Template PCR Buffer 1, 350 μM each
of the four dNTPs, 800 nM each of the heavy and light
strand primers, 3.75 units of Expand Long Template
Enzyme Mix and approximately 150 nanograms of DNA
template. LT-PCR was performed with two minutes
initial denaturation at 94°C, followed by 25 cycles of 94°
C for 10 seconds, 50-60°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for
greater than four minutes (extension for the first 10
cycles was 4 minutes then an additional 20 seconds
were added to the extension time every cycle), followed
by a final extension for 7 minutes at 72°C.
In one individual of each species, we amplified the
region between the two presumed control regions using
an unconventional primer pairing (SdMCR-H750 and
SlMCR-L740, source of all primers listed in Table 2).
These primers were oriented such that they would only
amplify a product if duplicate control regions existed (i.
e., if only a single control region existed, no product
would be amplified under standard PCR conditions; Figure 1). This amplification yielded products of approximately 4000, 3000 and 2800 base pairs in brown, redfooted and blue-footed boobies, respectively. We
sequenced both strands of these amplification products
using the original amplification primers and a suite of
internal primers (Figure 1, Table 2). Although some portions could not be sequenced reliably due to complex
repeat regions (Figure 1, grey areas; see Results), all other
parts were sequenced with at least two different primers
on each strand. Sequencing was performed using either
(1) a 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) at Genome Quebec (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec), or (2) a CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at Queen’s
Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour Core Genotyping
Facility (Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario).

Figure 1 Location of PCR primers within the duplication region of the sulid mitochondrial genome. Schematic representation of the
duplicated portion of the sulid mitochondrial genome, and approximate locations of PCR primers. L-strand primers are listed underneath the
schematic, while H-strand primers are listed above. Gene abbreviations are as follows: cyt b = cytochrome b, ND6 = NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 6, 12S = 12SrRNA, CR1 and CR2 = control region 1 and control region 2, Thr = tRNA-Threonine, Pro = tRNA-Proline, Glu = tRNA-Glutamic
acid, Phe = tRNA-Phenylalanine. Grey areas correspond to long repetitive regions in Domain III of the control regions that could not be
sequenced completely. All primer sequences are given in Table 2.

Using this sequence as a guide, we next amplified the
region located between the genes encoding for cytochrome b and 12SrRNA (i.e., the entire region spanning
the duplicated area) in three overlapping fragments
using the primer pairs b3/SlMCR-H171B, SlMCRL160B/SlMCR-H194A and SlMCR-L160A/12SH1301 in
one brown and one blue-footed booby (Figure 1). We
amplified equivalent fragments in one red-footed booby
using primer pairs b3/SsMCR-H170B, SsMCR-L143B/
SsMCR-H169A and SsMCR-L143A/12SH1301 (Figure
1). We sequenced both strands of the PCR product
using the original amplification primers and multiple
internal primers (Figure 1, Table 2). As before, most
regions were sequenced with at least two primers on
each strand. This sequencing effort revealed a duplicated
portion of the mtDNA genome that not only contained
a second control region, but also involved copies of the
genes for tRNAGlu, ND6, tRNAPro, tRNAThr and a partial copy of cytochrome b (see Results for more details).
To further investigate the evolution of the duplicated
regions, we focused our effort on domains I and II of
the control region. Taking advantage of sequence differences in the 5’ end of the duplicate control regions
(which we termed CR1 and CR2), we used control
region specific L-strand primers (i.e., primers that will
only bind to one copy or the other) to amplify approximately 540 base pairs of CR1 and CR2 separately in 21
individuals of each species. Specifically, we used primers
SlMCR-L160B and SlMCR-L160A paired with SdMCRH750 to amplify CR1 and CR2, respectively, in brown
and blue-footed boobies. In red-footed boobies we
amplified CR1 with primers SsMCR-L143B and
SdMCR-H750. We originally designed primer SsMCRL143A as an L-strand primer to amplify CR2 in redfooted boobies (paired with SdMCR-H750), but due to a

presumed mutation in the priming site in some individuals, we also designed another primer, SsMCRL143A2, to amplify CR2 in some red-footed boobies. To
verify that PCRs using SsMCR-L143A and SsMCRL143A2 amplified homologous regions we compared the
resultant sequence to sequence generated from long
template PCR amplifications using a suite of different
primers (not shown).
All PCR reactions were performed in 15 μL reactions
under standard conditions (10 mM Tris pH 8.5, 50 mM
KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.6 μM bovine serum albumin, 2%
gelatin, 0.2 mM each of the four dNTP’s, 0.4 mM each
of the heavy and light strand primers and 0.5 units of
Thermus aquaticus [Taq] DNA polymerase [Quiagen,
Mississauga]) with annealing temperature between 60 63°C. Both strands of the PCR product were sequenced
with the amplification primers at Genome Quebec, as
above.
Control region sequences were aligned using ClustalW
[12]as implemented in BioEdit Version 7.0.5.3 [13].
Some control region sequences (both CR1 and CR2
sequences) had “ambiguous” sites where two nucleotides
were present in the chromatogram (see Results). This
ambiguity was also found in a large number (>100) of
brown and red-footed booby CR2 sequences in a
broader phylogeographic survey [14]. To eliminate the
possibility that ambiguous sites were caused by sequencing errors, Morris-Pocock et al. [14] re-extracted and
re-sequenced 20% of brown and red-footed booby individuals that had ambiguous sites: all sequences (including ambiguous sites) were identical. Additionally, a
subset of individuals with sequence ambiguities in the
current study were re-extracted and re-sequenced at the
Queen’s Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour Core Genotyping Facility, as above.

Phylogenetic methods

We used both Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches (as implemented in MrBayes
Version 3.1.2 [15] and GARLI Version 0.95 [16] respectively) to estimate unrooted phylogenetic trees for CR1
and CR2 sequences from all 21 individuals from all
three species. We used the default settings in GARLI
and the nucleotide substitution model that best fit the
data as determined by MrModeltest Version 2.2 [17],
and evaluated reliability of the trees using 100 bootstrap
replicates. In MrBayes we used one cold chain and three
incrementally heated chains to explore parameter space,
and ran each analysis for 10000000 generations, sampling every 100 generations. To verify that the Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC)
process was converging we ran two simultaneous runs
and ensured that the MCMCMC process was continued
until the standard deviation of split frequencies between
the chains was lower than 0.01. To further ensure convergence, we re-ran all GARLI and MrBayes analyses
three times. All results were consistent across runs and
only one run is presented here.

Results
Confirmation of mitochondrial origin of sequences

A number of lines of evidence suggest that all regions
sequenced are of mitochondrial origin, rather than
nuclear pseudogenes [18]: (1) all putative tRNA
sequences folded into the expected clover-leaf secondary
structure [19]; (2) with the exception of a degenerate
copy of the cytochrome b gene found in all species (see
below), all protein coding genes appeared functional and
contained no premature stop codons; (3) substitutions
in protein coding genes between the three species were
predominantly at the third codon position (see additional file 1); (4) regions with high similarity to avian
conserved blocks were found in the expected locations
in domain II (F, D and C Boxes, see additional file 2;
[20]) and domain III (CSB-1; [20]) in both CR1 and
CR2; (5) base pair composition of the L-strand was
biased against Gs (26% C, 32% T, 27% A, 15% G); (6)
variable sites were distributed as expected [20], with 185
in domain I and 37 in domain II (considering both CR1
and CR2); and (7) all regions were sequenced from long
template PCR products, which seems to reduce the
amplification of nuclear copies [21].
Structure of the sulid mitochondrial genome

We obtained 5433, 5599 and 5457 base pairs of
sequence from brown, red-footed and blue-footed boobies respectively. Results confirmed that the mitochondrial genomes of all three species contain a large
fragment that has been duplicated (Figure 1). The
observed gene order surrounding the duplicated area
was identical to the albatross gene order [5] except that

Page 5 of 10

only a partial cytochrome b copy was found in boobies,
whereas a partial copy and a separate, but degenerate
cytochrome b copy was found in albatrosses. Remarkably, within species the duplicated regions have 100%
sequence similarity, with the following three exceptions:
(1) in all three species, one cytochrome b gene appeared
functional, while the second copy was identical in
sequence, but did not have the complete coding region
and was presumably non-functional; (2) approximately
50 base pairs at the 5’ end of the control regions differed significantly between CR1 and CR2; and (3) the 3’
end of domain III in CR2 contained short repetitive
sequence (CAAA) that was not detected in CR1. The
size of the partial cytochrome b gene varied only slightly
among the three species. Specifically, the degenerate
gene was 546, 548, or 545 base pairs long in brown,
red-footed and blue-footed boobies, respectively (see
additional file 1). Both CR1 and CR2 consisted of a
hypervariable domain I (containing a poly-cytosine
repeat), a conserved domain II and a variable domain III
containing complex repetitive sequence. The number of
repeats in domain III in both brown and red-footed
boobies appeared heteroplasmic within individuals and
the repetitive sequences precluded complete sequencing
of domain III in both CR1 and CR2 (Figure 1, grey
areas). Because we were unable to cleanly sequence
through these repetitive regions, we were unable to
determine whether the number of repeats in CR1 and
CR2 differed within species. Based on the size of electrophoresed PCR products on ethidium bromide stained
gels, the length of CR1 (including the repetitive region)
was approximately 2700, 1700, and 1500 bp in brown,
red-footed, and blue-footed boobies, respectively. The
length of CR2 was approximately 2100 bp in brown
boobies and 1600 bp in both red-footed and blue-footed
boobies.
Mitochondrial single site heteroplasmy

Of the 126 control regions sequenced (2 copies in each
of 63 individuals), 28 contained one or two “ambiguous
sites": sites in the chromatogram with two overlapping
peaks of which the second base was at least 25% of the
height of the called base. Ambiguous sites were found in
both CR1 and CR2, and in all three species. Importantly,
these ambiguous sites differed from ambiguous sites
resulting from co-amplification of CR1 and CR2. Specifically, we could rule out the co-amplification of CR1 and
CR2 because this would result in multiple ambiguous
sites (>10), all located at the 5’ end of the sequence (see
below). In addition, LT-PCR amplification and sequencing with multiple internal primers verified an ambiguous site in CR1 of red-footed booby individual
rf_CocD7, and re-sequencing of a subset of individuals
with ambiguities verified our original results. We can
also reasonably eliminate the possibility that these

Morris-Pocock et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/14

ambiguities are the result of co-amplification of nuclear
pseudogenes for the reasons outlined in the section
above. We therefore inferred that they represent true
mitochondrial heteroplasmy.
Evolution of the sulid control region

We found 116 unique haplotypes in the 126 control
regions that we sequenced (sequences are deposited in
Genbank, accession numbers GU290353 - GU290478).
No haplotypes were shared either between species or
between CR1 and CR2 within a species. Inspection of
sequence alignments revealed a striking pattern of variation when considering CR1 and CR2 within individuals.
With the exception of approximately the first 50 base
pairs of sequence, CR1 and CR2 sequences were identical or differed by only one or two mutations within all
individuals. In contrast, the first approximately 50 base
pairs at the 5’ end of domain I were extremely divergent
within individuals. Preliminary analyses also revealed
that phylogenetic signals from the first 50 base pairs
alone and the remaining base pairs alone were conflicting (see below for more details). A common test used to
detect discordant phylogenetic signal within DNA
sequence data is the 4-gamete test [22]; however, this
test assumes an infinite sites model that is probably not
appropriate for hyper-variable control region data.
Therefore, we inspected the sequence alignment and
visually split all control region sequences into a 5’ “variable” section (the first 39 - 49 bp) and a 3’ “conserved”
section (the remaining 493 base pairs). We were confident in our assignment of the break-point between the
5’ and 3’ sections because CR1 and CR2 sequences were
either identical or differed by a maximum of two mutations downstream of the breakpoint. We performed all
subsequent analyses independently on the 5’ and 3’ data
sets.
For the 3’ data set, the most likely model of nucleotide
substitution as suggested both by hierarchical likelihood
tests and by AIC values in MrModeltest was the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model [23] with a proportion of
invariant sites and gamma distributed rate variation
(HKY+I+G). Trees estimated using maximum likelihood
and Bayesian phylogenetic inference were similar and all
major clades were recovered by both methods. Bayesian
inference resolved many more recent clades (albeit with
low posterior probability) while ML collapsed many of
these clades into polytomies. We have presented the
maximum likelihood tree for the 3’ data set and indicated support for clades with both bootstrap values
(from the ML analysis) and posterior probabilities (from
the Bayesian analysis) on the maximum likelihood tree
(Figure 2, Figure 3). CR1 and CR2 haplotypes from a
given species grouped into a well supported monophyletic clade for each of the three species (Figure 2). Investigating the topology of each major clade in more detail

revealed that often CR1 and CR2 haplotypes from single
individuals form clades exclusive of all other haplotypes
(Figure 3). In other words, paralogous control regions
are often more closely related than orthologous control
regions, often with very high bootstrap support and
Bayesian posterior probability. Moreover, the average
sequence divergence between paralogous control regions
within individuals was 0.2%, while the average sequence
divergence between orthologous control regions within
a population (e.g., between CR1 sequences found in
individuals from the same species at the same colony)
was 1.1%.
For the 5’ data set, we were unable to reliably align all
CR1 and CR2 haplotypes due to the high variability and
short sequence length (see additional file 2). However, a
number of characteristics of the sequence data suggest
that the phylogenetic signal from the 5’ data set differed
fundamentally from the 3’ data set signal. First,
sequences from CR1 alone and CR2 alone were easily
aligned within species, but could not be aligned to each
other (e.g., all brown booby CR1 sequences could be
aligned to each other with no gaps, but could not be
aligned to any brown booby CR2 sequence). Second,
brown booby CR1 sequences were easily aligned to
blue-footed booby CR1 sequences. Similarly, brown and
blue-footed booby CR2 sequences were easily aligned.
Overall, for the approximately 50 base pairs at the 5’
end of the control region, orthologous sequences
appeared to be more closely related than paralogous
sequences.

Discussion
The most interesting result from the present study is
that duplicated regions of the mitochondrial genomes of
three seabird species are evolving in concert. We found
a large duplication in part of the mtDNA genome that
was present and structurally identical in all three species. Molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that
brown, red-footed and blue-footed boobies diverged
approximately three million years ago (MYA; [24]).
Therefore, the duplication event likely occurred sometime before 3 MYA, although denser sampling of other
closely related species is needed to pinpoint the exact
timing of the duplication. Alternatively, gene duplication
could have arisen multiple times within the booby lineage. Although the relative frequency of gene duplication
within avian mtDNA has been debated in recent years
[3,6,25], the similarity of the duplicated regions in the
three booby species seems to preclude repeated convergent duplications within the Sulidae. Perhaps the most
convincing argument for a single origin of the duplicated region in the Sulidae is that the partial cytochrome b copy differs in length by only three base pairs
in the three species, and we find it unlikely that this

pattern could emerge by parallel duplication and degeneracy. Importantly, the duplicated mtDNA region documented in our study includes the mitochondrial control
region in all three species.
Further investigation of the evolution of duplicate
control regions indicated that paralogous control regions
were often more closely related than orthologous control regions. The pattern of concerted evolution documented in the current study is, perhaps, most similar to

the pattern found in mangrove killifish [7] and Thalassarche albatrosses [5]. Specifically, Tatarenkov and Avise
[7] found that duplicate control regions within a single
individual were either identical (77 individuals) or differed by only a single substitution (11 individuals).
While we documented similar concerted evolution in
the majority of the control region, we detected a discordant phylogenetic signal at the 5’ end of the control
region, which appeared to be evolving independently.

the 3’ end of CR1 and CR2 for (a) brown, (b) blue-footed, and (c) red-footed boobies (shown as cladograms to make support values easier to

Abbott et al. [5] found similarly conflicting phylogenetic
patterns in 5’ and 3’ segments of duplicated control
regions in Thalassarche albatrosses, however their study
did not have the dense population-level sampling
equivalent to Tatarenkov and Avise [7], and thus they
were unable to comment on the rate of concerted evolution (i.e., how often the 3’ segments of the two control
regions were homogenized). To our knowledge, our
study is the first to document both the discordant phylogenetic signal mentioned above, and the rapid pace of
concerted evolution of the 3’ segment using a large sample of conspecific individuals.
Our study also found evidence that regions adjacent to
the control region are evolving in concert. Although we
sequenced the entire mtDNA duplication in only one
individual of each species (3 individuals total), this
sequence suggests that tRNAThr, tRNAPro, ND6, tRNAGlu
, and part of cytochrome b may also be evolving in
concert. Specifically, the duplicated tRNAThr, tRNAPro,
ND6, tRNAGlu sequences, the portion of cytochrome b
that was duplicated, and all duplicated intergenic
nucleotides were identical within each species, while the
sequences differed by up to 12% between species (see
additional file 1). If these regions had been evolving
independently we would expect, for example, that
sequence from orthologous ND6 sequences would be
more closely related across species than paralogous ND6
sequences within individuals. To further verify that

concerted evolution is also occurring in these segments,
the entire duplicated region (cytochrome b - 12S rRNA)
should be amplified in a large number of individuals as
was done for the control region in this study. Abbott et
al. [5] also suggest that ND6 may be evolving in concert
in Thalassarche albatrosses, but similarly acknowledge
that this conclusion is tentative pending further individual sampling. In both albatrosses and boobies, the
emerging pattern is that a large segment of mtDNA
stretching from tRNAThr to the control region is evolving in concert, while a smaller region nested within
this fragment either is evolving entirely independently,
or in concert, albeit with a slower rate of
homogenization.
The exact molecular mechanism that facilitates concerted evolution of animal mtDNA is unknown, but has
most often been attributed to frequent tandem gene
duplication and elimination due to slipped-strand mispairing during DNA replication, gene conversion via
crossing over of nicked strands or parallel selection on
duplicated regions [4,26]. Parallel selection acting on
duplicated regions can potentially explain concerted
evolution of functional mtDNA regions (e.g., ND6, avian
conserved boxes in domain II of the control region), but
it cannot account for the observed concerted evolution
of presumably non-functional parts of the control
region. Eberhard et al. [4] suggest that intra-molecular
recombination may occur between parental and nascent

Morris-Pocock et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/14

strands of duplicated control regions during DNA replication when DNA is three-stranded, resulting in concerted evolution via gene conversion. Specifically, the
nascent H-strand of one control region may recombine
with the homologous parental strand of the other control region, leading to the homogenization of both
sequences. This mechanism can adequately explain the
concerted evolution of the control region, but does not
obviously account for the concerted evolution of regions
upstream of the control region (tRNAs, ND6). Our data
are consistent with the gene conversion model outlined
by Kumazawa et al. [26]; however, similar to Thalassarche albatrosses, multiple recombination points are
needed to explain the non-concerted evolution of the 5’
section of the control region [5]. Ultimately, the exact
molecular mechanism underlying concerted evolution of
mtDNA may be difficult to identify using a phylogenetic
approach.

Conclusions
The use of mtDNA in phylogeographic studies has
recently been criticized for a number of reasons (e.g.,
[27]). Despite these shortcomings, mitochondrial DNA
still has a foothold in phylogeography and is potentially
very informative if used appropriately [28]. Proponents
of mtDNA cite a number of advantages over other
molecular markers including a fast evolutionary rate, a
small effective population size (approximately 1/4 that
of nuclear DNA), rare heteroplasmy and an apparent
lack of recombination [28,29]. Recently, however, some
of these fundamental tenets have been challenged. Perhaps most interestingly, mtDNA recombination has
been documented in a range of taxa including sea
cucumbers, snakes, ticks, birds, marine ostracods and
fish [5,7,26,30-32].
We demonstrated that concerted evolution of duplicated control regions occurs in at least three species
within the Sulidae. Perhaps more interesting is that a
very similar mtDNA duplication and concerted evolution pattern is found in Thalassarche albatrosses. The
Sulidae and albatrosses are part of a large clade that
also contains all procellariiform and most pelecaniform
seabirds [8]. Therefore, concerted evolution must either
be extremely widespread and undocumented within this
lineage or have arisen many times.
The extent that concerted evolution can affect phylogeographic studies depends on the pace of gene conversion relative to the nucleotide substitution rate. If gene
conversion occurs less often than mutation, specific care
must be taken to amplify homologous control regions in
a population genetic study. Fortunately, because paralogous control regions within individuals are often identical, the pace of gene conversion in boobies appears to

Page 9 of 10

be so rapid that amplification of homologous regions
should be less of a problem. However, because concerted evolution of duplicated control regions may be
widespread, we recommend that caution should be exercised when using the control region as a molecular marker in population genetic or phylogenetic analyses.
Moreover, because separate parts of a single control
region may be evolving differently, we strongly urge
researchers to test for conflicting phylogenetic signals in
the control region before using mtDNA sequence variation for further analyses. We also suggest that future
work should expand the taxonomic scope of the present
study. Preliminary evidence indicated that concerted
evolution also occurs in at least four other sulid species
(northern gannet Morus bassanus, Birt T, unpublished
data; masked booby S. dactylatra and Nazca booby S.
granti, Steeves TE, personal communication, and Peruvian booby S. variegata, Taylor S, unpublished data),
however the pattern should also be investigated in other
genera in the seabird clade (e.g., pelicans, frigatebirds,
penguins; [8]) to further test whether concerted evolution of duplicate control regions evolved once, or multiple times in parallel, among seabirds.
