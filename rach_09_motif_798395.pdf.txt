Abstract
Background: Transcription initiation is a key component in the regulation of gene expression.
mRNA 5' full-length sequencing techniques have enhanced our understanding of mammalian
transcription start sites (TSSs), revealing different initiation patterns on a genomic scale.
Results: To identify TSSs in Drosophila melanogaster, we applied a hierarchical clustering strategy
on available 5' expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and identified a high quality set of 5,665 TSSs for
approximately 4,000 genes. We distinguished two initiation patterns: 'peaked' TSSs, and 'broad' TSS
cluster groups. Peaked promoters were found to contain location-specific sequence elements;
conversely, broad promoters were associated with non-location-specific elements. In alignments
across other Drosophila genomes, conservation levels of sequence elements exceeded 90% within
the melanogaster subgroup, but dropped considerably for distal species. Elements in broad
promoters had lower levels of conservation than those in peaked promoters. When characterizing
the distributions of ESTs, 64% of TSSs showed distinct associations to one out of eight different
spatiotemporal conditions. Available whole-genome tiling array time series data revealed different
temporal patterns of embryonic activity across the majority of genes with distinct alternative
promoters. Many genes with maternally inherited transcripts were found to have alternative
promoters utilized later in development. Core promoters of maternally inherited transcripts
showed differences in motif composition compared to zygotically active promoters.
Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive map of Drosophila TSSs and the conditions
under which they are utilized. Distinct differences in motif associations with initiation pattern and
spatiotemporal utilization illustrate the complex regulatory code of transcription initiation.

Background

Transcription is a crucial part of gene expression that involves
complex interactions of cis-regulatory sequence elements and
trans-factors. It is mediated in large part through the binding
of transcription factors (TFs) to DNA sequence motifs. The
majority of eukaryotic genes (protein-coding genes and many
regulatory RNAs) are transcribed by RNA polymerase II
(RNA pol II), an enzyme that contains various subunits and
can exist in a holoenzyme complex with several basal TFs,
including TFIIB and TFIIF [1]. As RNA pol II does not have a
direct affinity for the DNA, general TFs that bind to sequence
motifs in the 100-bp region immediately surrounding the
transcription start site (TSS), called the core promoter, guide
it to the site of transcription initiation [2-4]. The set of general
TFs includes TFIID, which consists of the TATA-box binding
protein (TBP) and 10 to 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs),
along with TFIIH, and others.
Recent high throughput sequencing efforts based on 5' capping protocols have now generated capped transcripts for
human and mouse on a high throughput scale under numerous conditions [5-7]. These '5'-capped' or 'cap-trapped' transcripts have helped to identify genomic TSS locations for
thousands of genes, in particular for human, mouse and yeast
[8-10]. This approach revealed that transcription is often initiated across widespread genomic locations, making it nontrivial to define initiation sites [5,7-11]. Two general initiation
patterns have been characterized in mammalian core promoters. The first contains those with tags mapping to a 'single
dominant peak,' whose promoters have strong over-representations of canonical motifs, such as the TATA box, GC box,
CCAAT motif, and comparatively low frequencies of CpG
islands. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses have shown that single
dominant peaks are associated with developmental regulation and specialized differentiation processes [12]. The second type of initiation pattern comprises 'broad regions' whose
promoters have TATA-poor profiles and are enriched in CpG
islands. Broad regions are associated with more ubiquitously
expressed transcripts with housekeeping functions, such as
RNA processing and the ubiquitin cycle [12]. The large scale
of available data allows for detailed analyses; for instance,
one study explored the importance of precise spacing
between the TATA box and the TSS [13].
Until recently, data comparable in scope to the capped analysis of gene expression (CAGE) sets for mouse and human
have not been available for Drosophila genomes [14,15], but a
large number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated
from different conditions have been sequenced in D. melanogaster using 5' capping technology [16]. Using these, several computational efforts have focused on the locations and
frequencies of sequence motifs found in core promoters. The
TATA box (TATA), initiator (INR), downstream core promoter element (DPE), and motif ten element (MTE) have
been identified with distinct spacing requirements relative to
the TSS [17]. Each of these motifs has been found at a compar-

atively low frequency, but several analyses have identified
common additional motifs enriched in core promoters
[18,19]. GO and microarray analyses have proved valuable in
associating individual sequence elements with various functional terms, such as germline expression, and the embryo
and adult stages of the fruit fly life cycle [19]. A different analysis showed that specific motif combinations, or modules, frequently occur in core promoters [20]. These modules are
hallmarks of distinct core promoter types, and have been
shown in a study of genes associated with highly conserved
non-coding elements to characterize three main functional
classes of genes in D. melanogaster: developmental regulation, housekeeping, and tissue-specific differentiation [21].
Such functional classes have also been associated with different modes of RNA pol II occupancy [22].
The core promoter elements and modules also offer deeper
insight into the higher level organization of core promoter
architecture. Genomic analyses are increasingly complemented by the elucidation of epigenetic patterns, such as the
positioning of nucleosomes and the presence of certain histone marks [23,24]. Previous analyses used polytene chromosome staining and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)on-chip to show the existence of two distinct transcriptional
programs in D. melanogaster: TBP-related factor 2 (TRF2)
regulation of TATA-less transcription, including the genes
encoding linker histone H1; and TBP-regulated transcription,
including transcription of promoters of the core histones
H2A/B, and H3/H4 [25]. However, the degree to which the
core promoter motifs/modules and epigenetic features are
correlated with the patterns of transcription initiation and
their usage during the stages of embryogenesis has not yet
been explored in D. melanogaster.
In addition to the variability of initiation observed at a small
scale at many individual start sites, a wide range of animal
genes also possess clearly separated alternative promoters
that are associated with specific functional consequences
[26]. The extent to which such condition-specific variability is
reflected in mammalian and Drosophila core promoters is so
far mostly unclear. Several well-known D. melanogaster
genes are known to use well-separated alternative promoters
under different conditions. For instance, the transcriptional
activator Hunchback (Hb) has two isoforms with different
maternal (distal promoter) and zygotic (proximal promoter)
patterns of initiation [27,28]. Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh)
utilizes two promoters, one during embryonic development
and the second in adulthood [29]. As the presence and levels
of TFs vary across tissues and time periods, arrangements of
binding sites with which the TFs associate in the promoter
region should reflect, to a certain degree, the conditions
under which a specific core promoter is utilized [30,31]. However, genome-wide expression studies are typically based on
gene-wide probes located in the coding or 3' untranslated
regions. As a result, expression patterns made on a whole
gene basis, such as those in FlyAtlas [32], in various condi-

tions [33], neglect differences in distinct transcript variants.
Low-throughput studies using primer extension or 5'RACE
(rapid amplification of 5' complementary DNA ends) to evaluate the utilization of promoters at a higher resolution have
also been typically done under one condition. This has
restricted possible conclusions about the condition-specific
usage of alternative promoters. Recent studies on tissue-specific TAFs showed that the core machinery is remodeled in
specific conditions [34,35]. It is expected that the specificity
of TAFs is encoded in additional core promoter sequence elements, although the sequence elements governing this regulation have been elusive.
In this work, we use available large-scale data to provide an
extensive, high-quality mapping of alternative TSSs across
the fruit fly genome. We show that core promoter elements
and their corresponding modules are associated with peaked
and broad patterns of transcription initiation. We also confirm that motif matches are highly conserved in the peaked
promoters of TSSs, but show considerable variation in the
broad promoters of TSS cluster groups. Next, we identify distinct associations of TSSs with spatiotemporal conditions
based on the Shannon entropy of EST frequencies from different libraries. We investigate the specificity of alternative
promoters at higher temporal resolution using available
expression data from tiling arrays during embryonic development. Lastly, we identify intriguing trends of core promoter
elements and their corresponding modules in maternally and
zygotically utilized sites. Our analysis demonstrates that
sequence elements in core promoters are directly associated
with initiation patterns and the spatiotemporal conditions
under which they are utilized.

Results
Identification and assessment of alternative start sites
EST clustering identifies a high-quality set of alternative transcription
start sites
Previous studies on Drosophila promoters have often been
based on the analysis of upstream sequences extracted from a
genomic resource such as Flybase [36], using the most 5' location of a gene as the site of transcription initiation. However,
using a resource in this way invariably leads to inconsistent
assignment of TSS locations; for instance, many Flybase transcript annotations begin with a start codon, indicating that no
transcript evidence is available and making the annotation
incomplete on the 5' end. Filtering out such simple cases does
not mean that the remaining transcripts are automatically 5'
complete. While the accuracy of TSS annotations have considerably improved with increasing available data [37], the
use of high throughput 5' capping methodologies to identify
TSSs has also revealed dispersed patterns of transcription initiation in mammalian genomes [5,7]. These patterns have
challenged the validity of choosing the most 5' observed location as being the consistently utilized site.

Volume 10, Issue 7, Article R73

Rach et al. R73.3

Thus, we are not confident in the reliability and quality of TSS
data extracted from general-purpose genomic annotations
because we cannot be sure which of the annotated 5' ends
reflects a complete transcript, and which ones accurately capture a true and consistently used TSS. Other previous analyses in D. melanogaster were based on high quality TSSs, but
were smaller in size and depth. For instance, our previous
core promoter study covered 1,941 TSSs, but did not include
alternative start sites [18]. The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) incorporates highly confident TSSs identified
from the curation of ESTs and is of a similar magnitude to our
previous study [38]. Here, we continue the tradition of using
ESTs for TSS identification, but with the goal of identifying all
of the consistently utilized and precisely defined TSSs, rather
than the most 5' ones.
To minimize experimental error and clearly distinguish true
TSSs from background noise, it is essential to filter available
5' transcript data. To accomplish this, we started from the
large dataset of D. melanogaster ESTs in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Collection (BDGC; Additional data file 1)
[16,39]. A significant fraction of ESTs were obtained with a
protocol designed at the RIKEN institute to capture capped
full-length transcripts [9], similar to the more recent and
larger mammalian efforts. This subset is therefore expected
to map to the exact starting locations of known transcripts.
While the amount of available ESTs is not large enough to
completely saturate the transcriptome, it had until recently
been the largest amount of transcript data for Drosophila. We
mapped the BDGC ESTs derived from 15 different libraries to
8 distinct conditions: embryo, larva/pupa, head, ovary, testes, Schneider cells, mbn2 hemocytic cells, and fat body. A
broad adult stage can be accounted for by combining the promoter associations of the head, ovary, testes, mbn2 hemocytic
cell, and fat body. Additional libraries from more than one
body part or time period, an unknown source, or additional
conditions to those examined here were assigned to one
default condition called 'diverse'. By using independently
generated cDNA libraries, we expect to reduce potential
experimental biases from any one library due to incomplete
reverse transcription (Additional data file 1). This list of ESTlibrary derived conditions is certainly limited, but it enables
an initial analysis of promoter utilization in different life
stages and differentiated tissues.
We started from a set of 631,239 EST alignments for 318,483
ESTs, which were part of release 4.3 of the D. melanogaster
genome. We filtered this initial set to a reduced set of 157,093
unique EST alignments with high confidence of mapping to
the 5' ends of transcripts (see Materials and methods). These
unique EST alignments map across the Drosophila chromosomes and were derived from libraries of different sizes and
conditions (Figure 1). The libraries providing the most ESTs
were the RIKEN Embryo, with 35,102 ESTs, and RIKEN
Head, with 21,697 ESTs. The remaining 100,294 ESTs were
collected from non-cap trapping libraries. On account of the

and those from the testes were next in size, followed by the
Schneider cells, larva/pupa, and ovary. The mbn2 hemocytic
cells and fat body conditions had the smallest numbers of
ESTs.

Alternative transcription start sites are a widespread phenomenon in
the fly genome
To obtain a set of the most consistently utilized and precisely
defined TSSs, rather than the most 5', we implemented a hierarchical clustering strategy to define individual TSSs, as summarized in Figure 2 (see Materials and methods; Additional
data file 1). We first associated each of the 157,093 filtered
ESTs to corresponding genes, and then analyzed the distribution of ESTs for disjoint subsets, denoted '(sub-)clusters'. We
selected one or more TSSs from these (sub-)clusters for each
gene using additional criteria (see Materials and methods).
All (sub-)clusters with less than three ESTs were removed
from the analysis, and the individual TSS locations were
required to be supported by at least two ESTs.
We identified 5,665 TSSs for 3,990 genes (Additional data file
2), nearly three times the number of TSSs and twice as many
genes as in our earlier study [18]. More than half of the filtered ESTs were removed in hierarchical clustering and TSS
selection. The largest decrease in the number of ESTs during
TSS selection was observed for the diverse category. This
indicates that data from more variable sources show less consistent TSS locations compared to RIKEN cap-trapped data.
TSS locations with overlapping core promoter sequences that is, less than 100 bp from each other - were grouped into
non-overlapping TSS cluster groups spanning longer promoter regions. Below, the TSSs in TSS cluster groups are analyzed on two levels: as sites of individual initiation locations,
and together when evaluating broad promoters.

Volume 10, Issue 7, Article R73

Rach et al. R73.4

When TSS locations were considered individually, there were
2,765 genes (69%) with one TSS, and 1,225 genes (31%) with
alternative TSS locations. The 1,225 genes with alternative
TSS locations were evaluated according to the initiation patterns of their promoters, and for 685 genes (56%) the alternative TSS locations were in one broad promoter, while for 540
genes (44%) the alternative TSS locations were in alternative
promoters of the peaked or broad type, or any combination
thereof. Genes with alternative promoters were distributed
across chromosomes 2L, 2R, 3L, 3R, and X (Figure S1 in
Additional data file 1). There may be additional alternative
initiation sites upstream or downstream of those listed here
that were not considered due to a lack of EST support.
The mean genomic distance from TSSs to the most upstream
start codon annotated in release 4.3 was 1,353 bp, with a
median of 264 bp. This is 91 bp smaller than our previous estimate of 1,444 bp between TSS and start codon using chromosome 2R [18]. This difference is likely due to the earlier
strategy of Ohler et al. using the most 5' ESTs to define sites
of transcription initiation, rather than our use of the most
highly utilized locations as TSSs. For genes with a consistent
downstream start codon annotation, 141 TSSs were more
than 10,000 bp upstream of the closest start codon. This
observation of large distances between TSSs and their corresponding start codons agrees with high frequencies of large
distances between TSSs and start codons found in D. melanogaster using tiling arrays [40]. Due to the clustering criteria, the minimal distance between two alternative TSSs was
20 bp, with the most common distance ranging from 25 to 35
bp. This is different from the more high-resolution definition
of alternative TSSs that was employed in studies using highthroughput 5' cap trapping data [13]. As a result, canonical
core promoter sequence elements that occur at precise distances from the TSS, such as the INR, TATA box or DPE, can
be clearly assigned to individual promoters.
The maximum number of individual TSSs identified per gene
was seven for the genes CG33113 (Rtnl1), CG14039 (quick-tocourt), and CG11525 (CycG). Flybase listed three fewer alternative TSSs for quick-to-court, and four fewer for CycG in
release 5.11 [36]. Seven transcript isoforms for Rtnl1 and
quick-to-court, and three transcript isoforms for CycG are
annotated for these genes. Whereas some of the TSSs of CycG
and quick-to-court are close to each other and combined in
cluster groups, all of the TSSs of Rtnl1 are well-separated
peaked TSSs. Due to the stringent selection criteria we
employed in the clustering strategy, genes with more than
seven promoters may exist, but we found the most common
range of alternative TSSs to be much lower.
Due to the definition of the TSS cluster groups, the minimal
distance between TSSs in alternative TSS cluster groups is 101
bp, and the most common intra-cluster distance ranges from
101 to 199 bp. There were 55 TSS cluster groups separated by
more than 10 kb. It is estimated that noncoding 5' and 3' DNA

each comprise approximately 2 kb of intergenic sequence,
and that intergenic distances increase with regulatory complexity [41]. Genes performing house-keeping functions, such
as ribosomal constituents and general TFs, are commonly
spaced in 4 to 5 kb segments of DNA. Genes with more complex roles, such as in embryonic development and/or pattern
specification, take up 17 to 25 kb of DNA on average. This suggests that some of the alternative TSSs/cluster groups separated by large distances may experience more complex
transcriptional regulation.
We evaluated the quality of our set of alternative TSSs by
comparing initiation locations and promoter composition of
it to sites in the EPD and Flybase (Figure S2 in Additional
data file 1). While EPD and Flybase provide high quality support for the identified sites across the Drosophila genome, for
a single gene the TSS location information is often incomplete
using either database, and inconsistent using both. The TSSs
identified by hierarchical clustering thus supplement current
annotations by providing precise and consistent TSS locations. We illustrate this for the gene tramtrack (ttk; CG1856),
a transcriptional repressor located on chromosome 3R (Figure 3).

Presence and conservation of core promoter motifs
Sequence elements are associated with different initiation patterns
For more than 20 years, it has been known that some promoters are highly position-specific, while others are spread over
larger regions [42]. The analysis of large-scale CAGE data in
mammals has confirmed the presence of peaked and broad
promoters as a general phenomenon, and led to a more precise definition of four different promoter shapes reflecting
different initiation patterns [12]: 1, single-peaked or focused;
2, broad or dispersed; 3, multimodal; and 4, broad with
peak(s). In the clustering analysis above, we identified two
types of promoters: 'peaked ' for single TSSs, and 'broad' for
TSS cluster groups. The scale of the available fly data does not
allow for a more precise sub-classification, but the two groups
resemble the categories found in mammals to some extent,
with the broad promoters being a potential combination of
categories 2 to 4.
Compared to mammals, analyses of the Drosophila genome
have identified a larger set of sequence motifs enriched in
core promoters. Ohler et al. [18] predicted a set of ten motifs
in the [-60,+40] bp region surrounding the TSS; Fitzgerald et
al. [19] later identified 13 motifs with enrichment in the same
region, including nine of the ten motifs from Ohler et al. This
knowledge allowed us to investigate whether the peaked and
broad promoters were associated with specific core promoter
elements, similar to the TATA box and CpG island biases
found in mammals [12]. We focused on eight of the ten motifs
in Ohler et al. that have either been biologically validated or
previously reported as building blocks for core promoter
sequence modules. The eight motifs included four locationspecific canonical motifs (TATA, INR, DPE, and MTE) [43],

Volume 10, Issue 7, Article R73

Rach et al. R73.6

and four motifs that have weaker positional biases, but were
found to frequently co-occur in a specific order and orientation (Ohler 1, DNA replication element (DRE), Ohler 6, and
Ohler 7) [19,20]. Of the latter, only the role of the DRE in the
recruitment of the polymerase has been unraveled [44]. We
evaluated the occurrence of these eight motifs and their most
frequently occurring modules in 3,788 peaked and 876 broad
promoters (see Materials and methods). Because there were
far more peaked promoters than broad promoters, their core
promoters covered a three times larger genomic region. To
provide an equal measure across both sets, and across motifs
with differences in location preferences, motif matches were
counted anywhere in the promoters, and the numbers of
motifs found were then normalized to the number of occurrences per 100 kb. For an estimation of the numbers of motif
frequencies expected by chance, the analysis was repeated on
three sets of 100-bp regions surrounding randomly selected
intergenic sites.
Figure 4a shows a clear separation in core element usage
between peaked and broad promoters. While the TATA, INR,
DPE, and MTE were more prevalent in peaked promoters,
broad promoters had larger numbers of the Ohler 1, DRE,
Ohler 6 and Ohler 7. As the TATA, INR, DPE, and MTE occur
more frequently at specific locations from the site of initiation, and the Ohler 1, DRE, Ohler 6 and Ohler 7 have a weaker
positional bias, peaked and broad initiation patterns directly
correspond to the strength of location biases of the promoter
elements that define them. With the exception of the INR,
there were fewer occurrences of the location-specific canonical elements in peaked promoters than there were of the
motifs without location bias in the broad promoters. As this
relationship appears after normalization, this suggests that
the density of motifs is not linearly proportional to the
genomic span of the core promoters, but rather that broad
promoters, which include multiple closely spaced initiation
sites, also contain higher densities of their most frequent elements.
The greatest difference in element frequency between peaked
and broad promoters was observed for the INR and DRE.
This suggests that the DRE may be of equal importance to
transcription for broad promoters as the INR is for the
peaked promoters. All motif observations were higher than
the mean number of occurrences found across the three random intergenic sets, and random occurrence rates corresponded well to the expectation based on motif score cutoffs.
When motifs in peaked promoters were constrained to their
functional locations (see Materials and methods), the same
trends of occurrences were observed (Figure S3a in Additional data file 1). We did not analyze restricted motif locations for the broad promoters, as multiple TSS reference
points in the TSS cluster groups prevented distinct assignments within the overlapping core promoters.

both locations were classified as single initiation sites by EPD on account of their high frequency and small dispersion. In the hierarchically clustered set, we
observed TSSs at locations 27539771 (TSS#1), 27550733 (TSS#2), and 27551504 (TSS#3). The two most downstream TSSs correspond to the TSSs in
EPD, and the most upstream TSS is close to the first TSS annotated in Flybase, but missing in EPD. This agreement with EPD resulted from our use of a
similar dataset and identification strategy. All three Flybase TSSs for tramtrack are upstream of TSSs in the EPD and our sets, highlighting the bias in the
usage of the most 5' evidence as TSSs, rather than the most highly utilized locations. Looking at the presence of sequence motifs within tramtrack peaked
promoters, an INR was present at both TSS#1 and TSS#3 as defined in our set, strengthening our assignments for these TSSs, in spite of their considerably
different locations in Flybase.

Core promoter elements are associated with initiation pattern
Core promoter elements are associated with initiation pattern. PATSER was used to evaluate the presence of the eight core promoter elements at any
location in the 100-bp sequences surrounding 3,788 TSSs, 876 TSS cluster groups, and three sets of 1,299 random intergenic sites. All counts were
rounded to the nearest whole number after normalization. (a) Individual motif occurrences. The number of motif matches were counted and normalized
to the number of occurrences per 100 kb. For the random intergenic sites, the mean numbers of motif occurrences across all three sets are shown. (b)
Module occurrences. The number of pairs of motif matches present in the designated order, with respect to the orientation of transcription, were
counted and normalized to the number of occurrences per 100 kb.

Next, we evaluated the presence of combinations, or modules,
of known elements in the core promoters of the peaked TSSs
and broad TSS cluster groups. A previous study had identified
five different core promoter modules, which we evaluated
here: TATA/INR, INR/MTE, INR/DPE, Ohler 6/1, and Ohler
7/DRE [20] (see Materials and methods; Additional data file
1). Figure 4b shows that the TATA/INR, INR/MTE, and INR/
DPE modules occurred more frequently in the peaked promoters, and the Ohler 6/1 and Ohler 7/DRE modules were
more prevalent in the broad promoters. This corresponds
with our results of the occurrences of the individual elements.
It also shows that even though the Ohler 6 and Ohler 7 elements have a lower positional bias, they occur in a specific
order within binding modules. All module occurrences in

peaked and broad promoters were far above the mean
number found in the three random intergenic sets, although
higher numbers of the most frequent modules appeared in
the broad promoters than in those of peaked promoters. This
reaffirms that the broad core promoters of TSS cluster groups
have a higher density of the most frequent modules of motifs
than those of individual TSSs. Extending the analysis to three
elements is limited by the rareness of such events, but analyses indicated that INR/MTE/DPE and TATA/INR/DPE
occurred more often than triplets of elements with less positional bias (data not shown).
Finally, peaked core promoters were found to have higher frequencies of G (0.229) and C (0.234) than broad core promot-

ers (G, 0.211; C, 0.224) and the 100-bp sequences
surrounding the random intergenic sites (G, 0.203; C, 0.205).
These results confirm previous work showing that core promoters with the DPE, INR, and TATA/INR have a moderate
GC content, and core promoters with the DRE, and Ohler 1/6
elements have a GC-poor profile [20]. With this analysis, we
show that the GC content is not only characteristic of core
promoter elements, but also of initiation patterns of transcription.

Conservation of sequence elements differs across initiation patterns
Given the different associations of motifs with initiation patterns, we sought to examine whether there were differences in
the conservation of core promoter motifs across the 12 fully
sequenced Drosophila genomes. We selected the promoters
of individual TSSs and TSSs in TSS cluster groups that had
aligned sequences in all 12 species (see Materials and methods). This led to a reduced set of 4,243 promoters for 3,175
genes: 2,886 peaked TSSs, and 1,357 TSSs in broad promoters. We compared the conservation of the eight core promoter
motifs in D. melanogaster to the other eleven genomes in a
pairwise fashion (see Materials and methods). In other
words, we assessed whether a presumably functional motif,
defined by the occurrence of a motif match in the preferred
window relative to the location of a mapped TSS in D. melanogaster, was still detected in a second species in the corresponding position in the alignment. Figure 5a shows that
conservation levels of the INR motif ranged from approximately 90 to 95% for promoters in the melanogaster subgroup to approximately 50% for promoters in distantly
related species. These levels directly correlate with the phylogenetic distances of the 12 genomes [14]. Similar patterns are
found for the other position-specific motifs, with the TATA
box showing the highest level of conservation, and the MTE
the lowest in more distant species. For the other four motifs,
the conservation levels were consistently lower.
While this analysis showed clear trends, it did not indicate
whether such observations could arise from chance. We
therefore determined the fraction of pairwise conserved motif
matches by dividing the number of conserved motif instances
in the preferred window over the total number of occurrences
anywhere in the D. melanogaster promoters. After repeating
this analysis on a set of similar sized random intergenic
sequences, we took the ratio between promoters and random
sequences as the motif enrichment score; for D. melanogaster alone, this score simply indicated the enrichment of
hits in the preferred window (Figure 5b). In general, ratios
were higher for the position-specific motifs INR, TATA, MTE,
and DPE, with the INR exceeding enrichments of 30-fold.
While there was a lower but consistent score for Ohler 1 and
DRE, the motifs Ohler 6 and Ohler 7 did not clearly exceed a
ratio of 1 in D. melanogaster, indicating that the preferred
windows taken from [19] were not actually enriched above
background. The total number of conserved instances was
quite low for these motifs, and the higher scores seen for more

distantly related species may be regarded with caution, as
they could simply be a side effect of the small sample size.
Nonetheless, we saw that the motifs that were less restricted
in their relative location to the TSS showed a lower level of
conservation in the aligned locations.
Given that these two motif sets were shown to be associated
with different initiation patterns, we assessed whether motifs
in peaked promoters exhibited different conservation patterns than those in broad promoters. Figure 5c shows that
there are indeed strong differences in the conservation levels
of motifs across initiation patterns. Conservation levels of
localized motifs (TATA, INR, DPE, MTE) were consistently
higher when they occurred at peaked TSSs versus TSSs in
broad promoters. This trend was mirrored in a somewhat
weaker fashion by the set of motifs with lower positional preference (Ohler 1, DRE, Ohler 6, Ohler 7), which were more
conserved in peaked than broad promoters. Observations on
promoter conservation and TSS turnover have been reported
for human-mouse comparisons supported by 5' capped tag
data [45]. In particular, findings indicated that some alternative promoters experience a lower negative selective pressure,
and this may reflect an intermediary stage of a TSS turnover
event. Our findings here indicate that selective pressure on
the motifs in promoters also depends on the initiation patterns, with evidence that broad promoters may experience
more frequent functional motif turnover due to the lowered
restrictions on relative spacing of enriched motifs, and/or the
presence of other functional promoters in the close vicinity.
Looking at the conservation of motifs for the ttk case study
(Figure 3), we recall that two INR motifs were present in the
preferred location of the peaked promoters of TSS#1 and
TSS#3. The initiator motif in the TSS#1 promoter was conserved across all 12 species, and the initiator in the TSS#3
promoter was conserved within the 5 species of the melanogaster subgroup. This illustrates the existence of differences in motif occurrence and conservation levels at
alternative start sites.

Condition-specific utilization of promoters
Transcription start sites have distinct associations with conditions
derived from EST libraries
Sites of transcription initiation are determined by the conditions under which transcription factors mediate the recruitment of RNA pol II to the core promoter. Associations of TSSs
with conditions can give insight into the utilization and
organization of TF binding sites in core promoters. For this
reason, we characterized the condition associations of the set
of 5,665 TSSs identified from (sub-)clusters in the hierarchical clustering of 5' ESTs in D. melanogaster, regardless of initiation pattern, into three groups (condition-specific,
condition-supported, mixed) using Shannon entropy (see
Materials and methods; Additional data file 1). As mentioned
above, the cDNA library information for each of the ESTs was
mapped to one of eight distinct conditions (embryo, larva/

locations in the 12 Drosophila genomes. (a) Conservation of sequence elements across the 12 fruit fly genomes. The set of D. melanogaster promoters

groups: genes whose TSSs had different condition associations, if at least one TSS had at least one different association
from the gene's remaining TSSs; and genes with the same
condition associations for all of the alternative initiation sites.
In our dataset, 392 (32%) genes with alternative TSSs had the
same condition association, and over two times that number
of genes with alternative TSSs (833; 68%), had different condition associations. The number of genes with different conditions was significantly lower than expected when evaluated
using random permutations of the condition association
labels (P << 0.001; Additional data file 1). However, with
additional conditions and ESTs, we expect to observe a larger
percentage of alternative TSSs with different associations.

There were 1,997 (35%) TSSs with specific associations (Figure 6a), and 1,612 (29%) TSSs with supported associations in
one of the eight conditions (Additional data file 4). Together,
almost two-thirds of the TSSs had associations with only one
condition. Specific and supported assignments existed for
TSSs across all conditions, with the embryo and the head having the largest numbers of specific or supported sites. The testes had the third largest number of specific TSSs (247), and
the ovary had the smallest number of specific TSSs (9). The
numbers of testes and ovary TSSs were comparatively higher
than their fraction within the set of filtered ESTs. There were
14% of TSSs that were supported in two conditions. The two
largest pairs of condition associations were embryo:head and
embryo:Schneider cells. The embryo:head pair can be
accounted for by the large sizes of the ESTs in their libraries,
and the embryo:Schneider cell pair can be explained by the
fact that Schneider cells are derived from embryos at 20 to 24
hours of development. There were 1,275 (22%) TSSs classified
as having mixed associations. By default, we labeled TSSs that
were specific or supported for the diverse condition as having
mixed associations because their supporting ESTs were
derived from broad or unknown conditions. The existence of
library bias that can affect the determination of the condition
specificity of the TSSs was taken into account (Additional
data file 1). We evaluated the significance of the results and
found that the number of 1,997 condition-specific TSSs was
significantly higher than expected by random permutations
(P << 0.001; Figure 6b; Additional data file 1).

Differences in the temporal utilization of alternative promoters
during embryogenesis

When considering condition associations on a gene level, the
numbers of specific, supported, and mixed TSSs did not significantly differ for genes with alternative TSSs compared to
those having single TSSs, indicating that the presence of condition associations for more than one core promoter is a common phenomenon across all conditions. Because we assigned
conditions to individual TSSs, it was possible for the 1,225
genes with alternative TSSs to have more than one association. We thus divided genes with alternative TSSs into two

While we observed a significant enrichment of alternative
TSS associations with the same conditions, EST libraries are
too broad to distinguish differences in the precise timing of a
promoter's temporal utilization. To examine initiation events
at higher resolution, we used available Affymetrix wholegenome tiling arrays of D. melanogaster embryonic expression. The data were a natural fit to our analysis because
expression of genes was monitored at 12 time points during
the first 24 hours of the developing D. melanogaster embryo,
each covering a 2-hour period [40]. Embryogenesis has been

For the previously mentioned example gene ttk, all three TSSs
had embryo associations. The two most upstream TSSs were
embryo-supported, and the third downstream TSS was
embryo-specific. The associations corresponded to the known
expression of the gene during embryogenesis for various
functions, including the regulation of proper development of
tissues [46] and the determination of cell-fate [47]. This association of ttk's TSSs exemplifies typical patterns seen for the
set of 392 genes with alternative TSSs having the same condition associations. Additional examples of the EST condition
associations confirming known expression patterns and
developmental regulation of genes are provided in Additional
data file 1. While these assignments do not determine function, they help to define the scope of alternative promoter utilization and contribute novel information about expression
patterns.

well studied in Drosophila, and the morphological changes
that occur have been examined in depth. The control of transcription initiation during early embryogenesis involves wellknown TFs, such as Kruppel and Eve [2]. Their utilization has
become an important model system for studying the complexity of gene regulation.

Each of the oligos used in the array was 25 bp in length,
spaced at approximately 35-bp intervals genome-wide.
Unlike ESTs, which allowed us to assign TSS associations at
the level of individual nucleotides, the limited tiling resolution restricted our ability to distinguish differences in transcriptional activity of promoters at individual TSSs.
Therefore, we analyzed the temporal embryonic utilization of
peaked promoters separated by more than 100 bp and broad

results agreed with previous analyses of the tiling data that
focused on whole transcripts [40]. At this early stage in development, most promoters are expected to correspond to
maternal utilization. There was a decrease in the number of
promoters utilized at time point 3, followed by a second maximum of approximately 1,300 promoters utilized at time
points 5 and 6. This corresponded to the decrease in maternally inherited transcripts and the initiation of zygotic tran-

scription. After time point 6, the number of promoters
utilized continued to decrease, with a third weaker maximum
at period 11. The presence of these three cycles suggests periods during which the binding of TFs and/or RNA pol II differs
for large numbers of genes during embryogenesis. Further
statistical analysis is needed to rigorously evaluate the significance of this trend. Overall, 1,682 peaked and 288 broad promoters showed no utilization during any of the 12
developmental time points.
Temporal biases of transcriptional activity were seen in the
tiling array when the total number of promoters was divided
into peaked and broad. After normalization by the total
number of promoters in each set, a statistically significant
higher fraction of broad promoters was utilized than peaked
promoters in the tiling array (P << 0.01; Figure 7b; see Materials and methods). The difference was greatest in the first
and second 2-hour periods, and reached an additional maximum at time points 5 and 11. While it continued to decrease
after time point 5, the difference remained through time point
12. Overall, 56.6% of peaked promoters were transcribed in at
least one of the 2-hour periods, and 67.8%, or 11.2% more,
broad promoters were transcribed in at least one period. The
pattern that broad promoters were more transcriptionally
active during embryogenesis than peaked promoters was separately mirrored using the EST associations alone, without
the tiling array data (P << 0.01; see Materials and methods).
Here, initiation sites were deemed to have an embryo EST
association if an individual TSS, or at least one of the TSSs in
a TSS cluster group, had the association, resulting in 50.3% of
TSSs and 74.3% of the TSS cluster groups having embryo-specific or embryo-supported associations. When comparing the
condition associations of both promoter types across EST and
tiling array experiments, we saw consistency in embryonic
utilization of promoters (Figure 7a; Additional data file 1).
Finally, the time course tiling data allowed us to consider
temporal patterns of promoter activity and individual TSSs in
greater detail. The most frequent patterns for all promoters
(peaked and broad) were 'all off' - that is, no utilization during
any period (41%) - and 'all on' - that is, expression for the
entire 24-hour duration of embryogenesis (5.8%; 272 TSSs).
Patterns observed for more than five promoters are listed in
Additional data file 6. In particular, we explored the profiles
of genes with alternative promoters in greater depth (Additional data file 1). In this analysis, we excluded broad promoters from the set of 540 genes with alternative TSSs separated
by at least 100 bp, on account of their lack of precise individual TSS resolution, and divided the remaining 407 genes into
four categories. The first category consisted of 143 genes
(35%) with no expression from any peaked promoters at any
time point. The second category comprised 170 genes (42%)
with exactly one alternative promoter active during embryogenesis. In this group, 75 genes showed expression at time
point 1 and their promoters were thus maternally utilized.
The third category included 20 genes (5%) with more than

one but not all alternative peaked promoters utilized during
embryogenesis. The remaining 74 genes (18%) in the fourth
category had all alternative peaked promoters utilized at
some time during embryogenesis.
For the 74 genes in the fourth group, we examined the onset
of utilization, as defined by the first time point in which utilization lasted at least 4 hours, or 2 periods. This removed isolated and thus potentially erroneous calls. There were 30
genes with the same onset time across alternative peaked promoters, albeit with different durations of utilization. The temporal utilization of the 44 genes with different onset across
alternative peaked promoters was typically a combination of
both maternal and zygotic utilization. For two candidate
genes in particular, CG10120 (men), and CG32473, different
peaked promoters corresponded to completely non-overlapping periods of activity. Available RNA in situ images [48]
beautifully illustrated that the activity of distinct alternative
promoters is associated with different spatiotemporal expression patterns (Figure 8). This switch in maternal versus
zygotic promoter utilization mirrors the transcription of the
well-studied gene hunchback, for which our dataset unfortunately did not contain enough ESTs to call TSSs. This analysis
shows that dynamic properties of alternative promoter activity, such as onset and duration, are needed to properly characterize the regulation of transcription initiation during
embryogenesis.
All three peaked promoters of the ttk gene were separated by
at least 100 bp and each had an EST association with the
embryo. Typical of the set of genes with the same EST conditions, temporal analysis of the alternative promoters revealed
different patterns of utilization. Figure 8 shows the tiling
array utilization and in situ staining of the complex patterns
of gene expression observed for ttk during each stage of
embryogenesis. While further experimental verification is
needed to decipher the association between the spatiotemporal patterns and the utilization of each of ttk's alternative promoters, RNA in situ images show the existence of distinct
expression patterns at different stages that are consistent
with the usage of alternative promoters [48].

Core promoters of maternally inherited and zygotically active
transcription start sites have characteristic profiles of sequence
elements
The presence of the two types of core promoters defined by
different initiation patterns in Drosophila and vertebrates
suggests that each may have a functional importance. To
determine potential associations with specific conditions, we
first compared the motif composition of 370 peaked promoters with head-specific TSS EST associations, and 765 peaked
promoters with embryo-specific TSS EST associations (see
Materials and methods). While we saw small differences
between motif frequencies in the embryo and head-specific
promoters, no clear trends for condition-enriched motifs
were observed (Additional data file 1). This most likely

Differences in the temporal activity of alternative TSSs correspond to distinct patterns of gene expression
Differences in the temporal activity of alternative TSSs correspond to distinct patterns of gene expression. (a) In situ expression patterns of genes with
alternative TSSs. In situ images showing the spatiotemporal expression of the CG32473, CG10120 (men), and CG1856 (tramtrack) genes during
development [48]. (b) Correspondence between time period and developmental stage. As reference, the timing of developmental stages of the Drosophila
embryo is matched to a timeline of 1-hour intervals and the Affymetrix 2-hour increment time course. (c) Utilization patterns as measured by the tiling
array. The TSSs identified from the most frequent 5' EST ends are listed for each gene. The patterns of peaked promoter utilization detected on the tiling
array are noted according to the 12 time points measured during embryonic development. Tiling array data showed that the peaked promoter of TSS#1
was utilized at time points 3, 5, 6 and 11 (hours 4 to 6, 8 to 12, and 20 to 22), TSS#2 at 1 to 9 (hours 0 to 18), and TSS#3 was used at time points 3 to 6
(hours 4 to 12). While the pattern of utilization of the promoter of TSS#1 flipped at time points 4 and 11, the patterns for both TSS#2 and TSS#3 were
contiguous. TSS#2 is maternally inherited and the utilization of its promoter extends through early zygotic stages, while the utilization of the others starts
after 4 hours and is active for a shorter time. Notably, the peaked promoter of TSS#2 was the only one without a (conserved) INR motif.

resulted from the low resolution of these conditions, as both
'head' and 'embryo' encompass numerous tissues across various developmental stages.
We therefore examined the presence of sequence elements in
the more precisely defined conditions that the tiling expression time course data allowed for, and analyzed 319 maternally inherited, 766 zygotically utilized, and 1,021 mixed
maternally and zygotically active peaked promoters (see
Materials and methods). We performed a concurrent analysis
on 97 maternally inherited, 99 zygotically utilized, and 392
mixed broad promoters, to ensure that any identified associations of promoter elements with embryonic time points were
consistent for different initiation patterns. The set of zygotically utilized peaked promoters showed a clear enrichment in
the elements with strong positional bias - the TATA, INR,

DPE, and MTE - and the maternally utilized sites had higher
frequencies of the less location-biased elements (Ohler 1,
DRE, Ohler 6, and Ohler 7; Figure 9a). While smaller differences in the frequencies of the elements were observed in the
broad promoters overall, the same pattern of motif matches
in the maternal versus zygotic conditions was found (data not
shown). The association of the DRE, Ohler 6, and Ohler 7
motifs with maternal utilization was supported by a previous
motif analysis that evaluated the significance of ImaGO terms
in the Drosophila in situ hybridization database [49]. As this
division in motif usage for maternal versus zygotic transcription was observed for both initiation patterns, it indicates that
the repertoire of elements in the core promoters is determined by the different conditions. In χ2 tests, the null hypothesis that initiation patterns and temporal conditions are
independent of each other was rejected at (α = 0.05), indicat-

Elements in peaked promoters are associated with embryonic utilization
Elements in peaked promoters are associated with embryonic utilization. (a) Maternal and zygotic activity of peaked promoters corresponds to
differences in element occurrences. The presence of eight sequence elements was evaluated in peaked core promoters of TSSs using PATSER. Core
promoters were segregated into three groups based on their pattern of utilization (maternal, zygotic, both). Those showing no expression during the time
course were excluded from this analysis. The normalized means of motif matches in three random intergenic sets are shown. (b) Regulatory modules also
segregate by condition for peaked promoters. The numbers of occurrences of motif modules were evaluated in each of the three groups of peaked core
promoters (maternal, zygotic, both) by counting the numbers of pairs of matches positioned in the designated order, with respect to the orientation of
transcription.

ing that maternal versus zygotic activity of core promoters
and their initiation patterns are related to each other. For
peaked and broad promoters with both zygotic and maternal
activity, the frequencies of known elements agreed with those
of the maternally utilized promoters (Additional data file 1).
This relationship can be expected, as promoters with both
patterns of utilization could in fact have resulted from the use
of maternal promoters whose transcripts were not yet
degraded within the cell. When compared to the numbers of
occurrences in the random intergenic sets, the frequencies of
the most common motifs were much higher overall in the promoters, although some of the less common motifs were in the

range of frequencies observed for the random sites. This
shows that when not in proper context, occurrences of the
sequence elements are not as meaningful.
Akin to individual motif analysis, the occurrences of the
TATA/INR, INR/MTE, INR/DPE, Ohler 6/1, and Ohler 7/
DRE modules were evaluated separately for maternal and
zygotic utilization (see Materials and methods). The results
showed that the TATA/INR, INR/MTE, and INR/DPE modules had higher frequencies in the zygotically transcribed
peaked promoters, and the Ohler 6/1 and Ohler 7/DRE modules had higher frequencies in the maternally utilized peaked

promoters. Similarly, the numbers for promoters with both
maternal and zygotic transcription initiation agreed with the
maternally utilized module frequencies once again (Figure
9b). The same trends were observed for broad promoters
(data not shown). In summary, these findings therefore complement the associations of initiation patterns with motifs,
and propose that specific core promoter elements are more
frequently utilized during different stages of development.

moters includes RNA in situ hybridization during different
stages of fly embryogenesis [48,51]. In situ images are able to
capture spatial gene expression patterns at a much higher resolution than ESTs and microarrays. Our study provides
promising candidates for the design of isoform-specific
probes, which would link differences in the spatial and temporal expression of transcripts of the same gene to different
promoters.

The identification of 5,665 TSSs from hierarchical 5' EST
clustering provides a comprehensive map of reliable TSSs in
D. melanogaster that should serve as a useful resource for
information regarding condition-specific transcription initiation, and for computational modeling of promoter regions.
Nevertheless, the saturation of the D. melanogaster transcriptome by available ESTs is certainly incomplete, and
additional TSSs will certainly exist beyond the high quality set
identified in this work. While promoters of alternative TSSs
that are active under different spatiotemporal conditions
have been reported for several individual fly genes [27,29],
our analysis here establishes distinct spatiotemporal utilization of alternative promoters as a common feature in D. melanogaster. Some individual designations may result from
biases due to the comparatively low coverage of ESTs or, in
the case of the tiling arrays, from transcript expression levels
falling below the sensitivity of the microarrays; however, the
overall results strongly indicate that usage of many alternative promoters is condition-dependent. In humans, previous
work has shown that the aberrant use of alternative promoters is associated with various diseases, such as cancer [26].
Genomic similarities that can be observed in the usage of promoters of alternative TSSs under different conditions in both
humans and Drosophila may provide insight into downstream effects on transcripts and the mechanisms governing
disease (Additional data file 1).

Drosophila core promoters distinguish themselves from
other eukaryotic species investigated so far by being defined
by a repertoire of well-known sequence motifs. Recent work
has shown that core transcriptional complexes are remodeled
in specific cell types in both mammals and flies [34,52]. Here,
we examined differences in motif frequencies and patterns of
spatiotemporal utilization of peaked and broad promoters,
which complements a concurrent recent study that explored
how promoter motifs relate to one another across alternative
promoters and adjacent genes [53]. We showed that peaked
promoters have higher frequencies of the location-specific
motifs (TATA, INR, DPE, MTE) and their corresponding
modules, and higher levels of zygotic utilization. The importance of the location of elements in peaked promoters with
respect to the TSS may reflect the binding architecture of
zygotic-specific TAFs in RNA pol II. As broad core promoters
surrounding maternally inherited sites have a higher number
of occurrences of motifs with weaker positional bias (Ohler 1,
DRE, Ohler 6, Ohler 7) and their modules, this suggests the
hypothesis that larger regions of the DNA may be accessible
at these locations. The localization of nucleosomes or specific
chromatin marks may affect the accessibility of the DNA
under specific conditions and locations, and explain the presence of specific initiation patterns [23,24]. In addition, a previous study suggested that the promoters recognized by TBPrelated factor 2 up-regulate genes required for specific developmental pathways and may be involved in chromatin organization in mammalian gonads [25].

The promoters of alternative TSSs may also be utilized under
the same broad EST-derived conditions. In fact, there was a
higher than expected number of genes with alternative TSSs
having the same condition associations. Alternative TSSs
with the same condition associations may result from a series
of point mutations, or be created anew through promoter
sequence duplication [45]. In cases where there is no selective
pressure to maintain all alternative sites, the promoters
should exhibit a lower level of sequence conservation. This
was in fact what we observed for the motifs of broad promoters in our set. On the other hand, there are cases in which the
functional maintenance of several peaked promoters is linked
to the same condition, and the promoters of these genes
should exhibit a higher level of conservation. As an example,
the enhancer for the yellow gene has been shown to interact
with a promoter in cis and a promoter in trans based on core
promoter composition [50]. A possible experimental validation of specific expression patterns linked to alternative pro-

Our findings suggest that the core promoters of peaked TSSs
in Drosophila are functionally equivalent to those of the single dominant peaked TSSs in vertebrates. The peaked promoters in both D. melanogaster and vertebrates have single,
well-defined sites of initiation, contain location-specific
motifs, and are associated with similar functional subsets of
genes. Here, we showed that peaked D. melanogaster promoters are utilized zygotically, confirming previous findings
that the promoters of genes with the INR and DPE are associated with developmental regulation and that the TATA is
overrepresented in terminally differentiated tissues, such as
the cuticle, and endocrine glands [19,21]. In vertebrates,
peaked promoters are known to have an association to more
tightly regulated transcripts [12]. In Drosophila, developmentally regulated genes were later shown to be associated
with stalling of the RNA pol II machinery [22], and a circuit
involving the TBP, Mot1, and NC2 that controls the regulation
of DPE-dependent versus TATA-dependent transcription was

shown to exist [54]. This suggests that a larger network regulates the transcriptional balance between functional classes of
core promoters. As this analysis characterized individual sites
of transcription initiation, and previous studies evaluated
associations using whole genes in Drosophila, the functional
associations of peaked promoters with developmental regulation and terminally differentiated tissues should be explored
in greater depth. Our current set of peaked TSSs may change
with additional data, as more detailed information on initiation events may lead to reassignments of patterns to promoters.

indicate that the shape of promoters may be independent of
the functional properties of CpG islands. The core promoter
motifs may have been decoupled from CpG islands, or the
properties of CpG methylation, selectively in the evolutionary
history of D. melanogaster, as many other insect taxa have
CpG methylation and orthologous proteins that catalyze it in
vertebrates [58,59]. Furthermore, the core promoter motifs
may be more dependent on the epigenetic features of the
genome, such as the organization of histones and histone
methylation, rather than on the properties of the DNA
sequence itself.

Similarly, we propose that the promoters of broad TSS cluster
groups in Drosophila are functionally equivalent to broad
regions of initiation in vertebrates [12]. Both of them are composed of multiple initiation sites, with no fixed spacing
between them, contain motifs without a location enrichment,
are void of the location-specific motifs, such as the TATA, and
are present in similar functional subsets of genes. By showing
that broad promoters are maternally utilized in Drosophila,
this work supports previous studies showing that core promoter motifs without a location enrichment are utilized in the
embryo, and are associated with housekeeping functions,
such as DNA repair and translation, and the proteins necessary to perform them, such as the components of RNA pol II,
and mitochondrial proteins [19,21]. Housekeeping genes with
ubiquitous expression are associated with actively transcribing RNA pol II in D. melanogaster [22], and with broad patterns of initiation in vertebrates [12]. Furthermore, in our
analysis, broad promoters were found to contain higher densities of the most frequent motifs and modules. As they define
larger domains, broad promoters may be susceptible to
higher probabilities of gaining motifs and modules. It will be
interesting to explore whether, similar to other genomic
properties, including gene family sizes [55] and protein folds
[56], the relationship between motif density and genomic
span of initiation is scale free.

Our study provided a high-quality data set to assess the conservation of core promoter elements across the recently published 12 Drosophila genomes. As we have experimental data
for one species, we can only evaluate the loss of a D. melanogaster site in the corresponding location in another species. The fraction of candidates with non-conserved promoter
elements in the melanogaster subgroup (approximately 10%
depending on the motif and species) agrees with the turnover
frequency measured by the ChIP-validated Zeste binding site
[60]. The observed conservation levels drop drastically outside the melanogaster subgroup. A larger evolutionary effect
in more distal species is certainly expected, but the recently
observed low performance of multiple alignment algorithms
on distal non-coding regions is likely to be a strong contributor to this observation [61,62]. Promoters of alternative TSSs,
in particular those of broad TSS cluster groups, show a distinctly lower level of conservation of motifs across the 12 Drosophila genomes. This provides initial evidence of an average
lower negative selective pressure on alternative and broad
promoters, linked to the presence of functional motifs. A possible explanation for this effect was given in a recent TSS
study on human and mouse, by using high-throughput CAGE
sequence tags [63]. This study showed that alternative TSSs
may arise in an intermediate stage of the process of TSS turnover. In support of this, an analysis of primate core promoters
gave evidence for accelerated substitution rates [64].

It is important to recognize, however, that we are comparing
the functional usage of each 'type' of core promoter across
Drosophila and vertebrates, and not the actual sequence features that comprise them, as Drosophila and vertebrates have
core promoter sequence features that are uniquely adapted to
the transcription initiation machinery of each species. For
instance, out of the eight motifs used in this study, only three
motifs (TATA, INR, and DPE) have been shown to be functionally relevant for transcription initiation in vertebrates
[19]. In turn, other sequence elements that play an important
role in vertebrates, such as the downstream core element
DCE, are absent in D. melanogaster [57]. The most salient
difference between fruit fly and vertebrate promoters regards
the presence of CpG islands. In vertebrates, CpG islands are
characteristic of broad initiation regions, and are less frequent in peaked promoters, while in D. melanogaster, CpG
islands do not exist, and peaked promoters have higher frequencies of G and C than those of broad promoters. This may

The presence of canonical core promoter elements has shown
that TSSs may be more dynamic than previously thought [65].
In addition to the effects discussed above, the promoters of
alternative TSSs are involved in enhancer functionality
[66,67], transcriptional interference [68], conditionrestricted TAF utilization [69], and the maintenance of internal ribosome entry sites [70,71]. As the amount of data
increases from capturing 4,000 genes in this study to the
13,767 genes present in the D. melanogaster genome, we
expect the number of genes with alternative TSSs to scale
accordingly. The first sets of 5' capped high-throughput transcript data have become available concurrently with our
study, and such data will provide the necessary scale to follow
up on our observations [72].

Conclusions

Our study provides a genome-wide mapping of Drosophila
TSSs and the distinct spatiotemporal conditions under which
their promoters are utilized. Long underestimated in importance, differences in the motif composition of peaked and
broad alternative core promoters have now been shown to be
part of the complex spatiotemporal regulatory code of the
eukaryotic transcriptome.

Materials and methods
EST filtering and clustering
We used EST alignments from Drosophila release 4.3 to identify TSSs, which enabled us to directly map our results to
other available data sources (cross-species alignments and
expression data). We filtered the ESTs in a four-step process
by first eliminating ESTs that did not cover an intron splice
junction. This reassured us that the remaining ESTs were
produced from mature transcripts. Second, we removed ESTs
having aligned fragments longer than 1,500 nucleotides, or a
distance greater than 100 kb between any two fragments. This
was done to exclude dubious ESTs that may incorrectly map
to the genome. The parameter range of 50 to 100 kb corresponded to an upper bound of the genomic span of fly genes
and was previously used as a natural cutoff for the determination of promoter co-regulation [40]. Third, we took out ESTs
that aligned to multiple regions to ensure our set contained
unambiguous locations. Fourth, we deleted ESTs with the
most 5' location mapping to within 2 bp of the start of a downstream exon or transposon, as annotated in release 4.3. This
served to eliminate incomplete ESTs, and those utilized by
transposons. The 157,093 ESTs that remained were deemed
highly confident in mapping to the most 5' ends of coding
transcripts.
We implemented a hierarchical clustering strategy to define
individual TSSs (Figure 2). We first parsed the ESTs by associating each of the 157,093 filtered ESTs with corresponding
genes and dividing all of the ESTs for each gene into broad
windows. Adjacent ESTs that were less than 100 bp apart
were assigned to the same window, while adjacent ESTs
greater than 100 bp apart were assigned to different windows.
The window size of 100 nucleotides is a rule-of-thumb standard that has also been employed by EPD to specify broad
regions of transcription initiation [8]. Moreover, the known
sequence features directly involved in transcription initiation
are all located within ± 50 nucleotides from the TSS, and the
core promoter region of each TSS is generally defined to be
approximately 100 bp in size. The genomic position of the 5'
end of each EST alignment is referred to as the EST location.
We next computed the standard deviation of EST locations,
and iteratively divided windows into smaller clusters until
each had a standard deviation of less than 10. We refer to all
of the clusters and sub-clusters having a standard deviation
less than 10 by the term (sub-)cluster. This was done to dis-

Volume 10, Issue 7, Article R73

criminate regions of high localized EST frequency from broad
regions with low EST frequency. It also served to separate singleton EST outliers into separate (sub-)clusters. The choice of
10 as standard deviation parameter corresponds to a variance
of 100 bp and, thus, the size of a core promoter, as defined
above.

Transcription start site identification from EST
clusters
We identified TSSs from the (sub-)clusters using four criteria.
First, we found the location with the highest frequency of
ESTs in each (sub-)cluster, and removed (sub-)clusters with a
maximum frequency at a single site of less than 2. This criterion selected only those (sub-)clusters with consistently and
reproducibly utilized TSSs. If two or more sites were tied for
having the highest frequency of ESTs, the upstream site was
chosen.
Second, to ensure that predicted locations coincided with the
beginning of full-length transcripts, we selected sites that had
to be supported by either at least three ESTs from a 5' capped
library sequenced by RIKEN [5], or two RIKEN ESTs and a
third EST within 5 bp from any non-RIKEN, non-capped
library. For EST clusters without RIKEN ESTs, sites had to be
supported by either three ESTs within five nucleotides of the
5' end of the cluster, or have at least half of the ESTs within a
(sub-)cluster falling within five nucleotides of each other.
Third, if a cluster contained several TSSs identified for more
than one (sub-)cluster, we placed a new window starting at
one TSS and ending at the second TSS. If the standard deviation of this new window was less than the cutoff of 10, we kept
the site with the higher frequency of ESTs as the TSS and
removed the second location from the dataset. If the standard
deviation of the new window was greater than 10, we kept
both locations as TSS candidates. This eliminated closely
spaced TSSs from adjacent (sub-)clusters.
Fourth, we required sites to be upstream of a start codon
annotated for the gene in release 4.3. Because ESTs do not
span the entire length of a transcript, we generally do not
know what downstream isoforms correspond to the TSSs. For
this reason, we conservatively required TSSs to be upstream
of the most downstream start codon. If any of these criteria
were not satisfied, we declared the (sub-)cluster to not have
any conclusive TSSs and removed it from further analysis.

Motif presence and conservation analysis
We applied the program PATSER [73] to the plus strand of
the core promoter region [-60,+40] bp immediately surrounding the identified TSSs and the most 5' sites in Flybase,
to look for hits to previously published position weight matrices above a threshold. For broad TSS cluster groups, promoter sequence [-60] bp of the most upstream TSS to [+40]
bp of the most downstream TSS in the cluster group was
extracted. To assess the strength of enrichment and conserva-

tion of motifs, we extracted 100-bp sets of sequences surrounding three randomly selected intergenic sets of sites, and
repeated motif searches on these sets.
We used relative frequency matrices for eight core promoter
motifs reported by Ohler et al. [18] and that were confirmed
by analyses of other groups, for example, Fitzgerald [19]. We
estimated set-specific mononucleotide backgrounds to
account for varying AT content in the promoter sequences we
analyzed (our TSS set; Flybase TSSs; and the random intergenic set). Score thresholds were individually chosen for each
position weight matrix, always corresponding to a P-value of
10-3 for the expected false positive hit per nucleotide. As seen
in Figure 5b, motif matches in random intergenic regions
agreed very well with the expected false positive rate. Motif
matrices were taken from Ohler et al. [18], with one modification. The DPE as reported in that study is a composite of the
closely spaced MTE and DPE elements (this can clearly be
seen when comparing motif 9 (DPE) and motif 10 (MTE) with
previous DPE consensus motifs), which is likely a side effect
of the MEME motif-finding strategy employed in that study.
To avoid confounding results by overlapping matches, we
shortened both DPE and MTE to eight-nucleotide non-overlapping motifs. All frequency matrices and background models are provided in Additional data file 3.
Preferred motif positions were defined differently for location-specific and non-location-specific core motifs. For
TATA, INR, DPE and MTE, we used the ten-nucleotide window with the highest number of motif matches in our D. melanogaster TSS set (-38 to -29 for the TATA box starting
position, -4 to +6 for the INR motif, +14 to +23 for the MTE,
and +21 to +30 for the DPE). These windows overlapped the
most enriched motif locations as identified in the Flybasedefined promoter analysis of Fitzgerald et al. [19]. For the
other four motifs, we used the 20-nucleotide windows as
defined in that study (Ohler 1, -20 to -1; DRE, -60 to -41;
Ohler 6, -60 to -41; and Ohler 7, +1 to +20). Note that we
restricted motif matches to the preferred windows in some
but not all analyses; in particular, preferred windows are
somewhat less meaningful when dealing with broad cluster
groups that do not exhibit a single initiation site.
For the conservation analysis, we first obtained orthologous
regions across the other 11 species [14] using alignments computed by Multi-LAGAN [74]. Then, we selected promoters of
TSSs having alignments in all 12 species, which led to a
reduced set of 4,243 TSSs, with 2,075 genes with one TSS and
1,100 genes with more than one. As described above, we
scanned orthologous regions in each species for motif hits
above the threshold. For the location-specific motifs (TATA,
INR, DPE, MTE), we identified matches in the D. melanogaster sequences within the 10-nucleotide preferred windows as defined above; for the other four motifs, we used the
most-enriched 20-nucleotide windows [19]. Then, we
assessed whether motif matches in D. melanogaster were

Rach et al. R73.20

located at corresponding positions in any of the other 11
genomes. Following the example of [60], we allowed for ± 5
nucleotides to account for possible small errors in the local
alignments at the site of a motif match. In this way, we
assessed whether a presumably functional motif, defined by
the experimentally deduced location of the TSS and the
occurrence of a motif match in the preferred position, was still
detected in a second species, or potentially lost.

Shannon entropy to measure condition enrichment
We assessed the condition association of TSSs by computing
the Shannon entropy of the ESTs of each (sub-)cluster from
which they were identified, using a protocol following previous methods [75]. First, we defined:

w(tss, i ) = N (tss, i ) /( x i + 5, 665)
for (sub-)cluster tss, condition i, where N(tss,i) = the number
of ESTs in each (sub-)cluster tss and condition i, xi = the
number of ESTs for one condition across all (sub-)clusters,
and 5,665 = the total number of (sub-)clusters in the analysis.
In other words, w(tss,i) represents the normalized expression
counts of the ESTs by condition and the overall size of the
dataset. Next, we obtained the probability of observing an
EST for each condition in a (sub-)cluster:

P (i | tss ) = w(tss, i ) / N tss
for Ntss = the total number of ESTs in the (sub-)cluster across
all conditions. To avoid arbitrarily low entropy values, we
smoothed the data for conditions with no ESTs by setting P (i
| tss) = 0.001. We calculated the entropy:

H tss = −

∑ P(i | tss)log P(i | tss)
2

by summing across all conditions i for each tss. Then, we
penalized entropy values to account for the disparity in sampling depth across conditions:

Q i ,tss = H tss − log2 P (i | tss )
Lastly, we characterized the condition utilization of each
(sub-)cluster by using an EST frequency threshold and the
penalized entropy values, Qi,tss. Only (sub-)clusters having at
least three ESTs from a condition were evaluated further to
prevent potential false assignments due to a low frequency of
ESTs. The entropy values for Htss ranged from 0 to log2(c), for
c = the number of conditions. In our analysis, c = 9 (eight distinct conditions and one diverse condition), and values for
Qi,tss ranged from 0 to log2(9) - log2(0.0001), or 16.458.
Q values naturally segregated into three clearly distinct
groups (Figure S4 in Additional data file 1). Entropy values
close to zero signified (sub-)clusters with ESTs mainly from
one condition. Larger entropy values characterized (sub)clusters with ESTs that were more broadly distributed across

Genome Biology 2009,

libraries, but still mainly concentrated in one or two conditions. The greatest entropies denoted (sub-)clusters with
ESTs spread across many of the eight conditions. On account
of these groups, we classified the TSS associations into three
categories (condition-specific, condition-supported, and
mixed) based on chosen cutoffs of Qi,tss. TSSs were declared
condition-specific if 0 ≤ Qi,tss ≤ 1, and there were less than two
ESTs from other conditions, and condition-supported if 0 ≤
Qi,tss ≤ 1, and more than two ESTs were generated from other
conditions. We also classified TSSs as condition-supported if
1 ≤ Qi,tss < 10. TSSs with Qi,tss ≥ 10, and those that were classified as specific or supported by more than two of the eight distinct conditions, were deemed to have mixed association.
Finally, TSSs that were specific or supported by the diverse
condition were assigned mixed association by default.

Evaluating temporal usage of promoters by Affymetrix
tiling arrays
Our analysis is based on a published embryonic time course,
and we evaluated promoter activity by using reported normalized intensity values of 25-bp long probes [40]. The spatiotemporal utilization of the most upstream TSS in a broad
TSS cluster group was chosen to characterize the whole
group, as the low resolution of the Affymetrix tiles did not
permit an evaluation of individual closely spaced TSSs. This
resulted in 4,664 well-separated promoters. For each promoter, the median of fluorescence intensity of three downstream tiles of the TSS was subtracted from the median of
fluorescence intensity of three upstream tiles from the TSS,
with respect to the orientation of transcription. Tiles containing the TSS location were excluded from the analysis because
we did not expect such probes to show consistent expression.
Due to the differing levels of total transcription across the 12
2-hour periods, cutoffs were determined independently for
each time point. A mixture model of two Gaussians was fit to
the differences of each time point using expectation maximization. The point of intersection of the two Gaussians was
rounded up to the nearest.5 and declared the threshold (Additional data file 1). All promoters having differences greater
than the threshold were deemed transcribed (T) for that time
point. Promoters having differences in median fluorescence
intensity less than the time point-specific threshold were
declared non-transcribed (N). To determine the expected
fraction of false predictions at these cutoffs, we randomly
selected 4,664 random intergenic sites as a control dataset.
For each of these sites, we evaluated the difference in fluorescence intensity by using the same methodology and threshold
values, and assuming the sites had positive orientation.
The fraction of promoters transcribed at each time point was
determined by dividing the number of transcribed promoters
at each 2-hour period by the total number of promoters. A
paired t-test was applied to the fractions of transcribed
peaked versus broad promoters to evaluate statistical significance. The same strategy was used to compare the fraction of

peaked versus broad promoters with embryo EST associations over all 12 time points, and to compare the total number
of initiation sites with embryo EST associations to those without. For the evaluation of the association of both types of promoters with embryo and non-embryo ESTs associations,
without the tiling array data, a χ2 test with Yates' continuity
correction was applied. A Bonferroni correction was used in
all tests, reducing the effective significance level to 0.01.
In the core promoter analysis, maternally inherited sites were
defined as having utilization during time points 1 and/or 2 in
the tiling array. Sites with zygotic transcription were required
to have utilization during at least one 2-hour period from time
points 4 through 12, and sites with both maternal and zygotic
utilization needed to satisfy both requirements. The promoter
element matches previously identified were summed up separately for these three sets. As the initiation pattern does not
play a role with regard to random intergenic sites, the mean
numbers of elements identified in the 1,299 random sites
served as a baseline. To test the relationship between initiation pattern and condition, we summed the normalized frequencies of the location-specific motifs (TATA, INR, DPE,
and MTE) and non-location bias motifs (Ohler 1, DRE, Ohler
6, Ohler 7) in peaked promoters with maternal (respectively
zygotic) utilization, and in broad promoters with maternal
(respectively zygotic) utilization, and performed a χ2 test on
both 2 × 2 contingency tables.

Authors' contributions

UO, PT and EAR conceived, designed, and coordinated the
study. EAR clustered the ESTs, identified the TSSs, assigned
EST condition associations, evaluated promoter utilization
from the tiling arrays, and compared the presence of motifs in
promoters with different patterns of initiation and spatiotemporal utilization. UO and HY evaluated the conservation of
motifs across species. WHM performed the GO analysis. EAR
and UO wrote the manuscript.
