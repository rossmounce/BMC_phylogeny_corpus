Abstract
The functions of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 11–13 in central nervous system (CNS) infections are
currently unknown. Using a murine model of neurocysticercosis, we investigated the expression
and distribution of TLRs 11–13 by using both gene specific real-time PCR analysis and in situ
immunofluoresence microscopy in both control and neurocysticercosis brains. In the mock
infected brain, mRNAs of TLRs 11–13 were constitutively expressed. Parasite infection caused an
increase of both mRNAs and protein levels of all three TLRs by several fold. All three TLR proteins
were present in both CNS and immune cell types. Among them TLR13 was expressed the most in
terms of number of positive cells and brain areas expressing it, followed by TLR11 and TLR12
respectively. Among the nervous tissue cells, TLRs 11–13 protein levels appeared highest in
neurons. However, TLR13 expression was also present in ependymal cells, endothelial cells of pial
blood vessels, and astrocytes. In contrast, infiltrating CD11b and CD11c positive myeloid cells
predominantly produced TLR11 protein, particularly early during infection at 1 wk post infection
(~50% cells). TLRs 12 and 13 proteins were present on approximately 5% of infiltrating immune
cells. The infiltrating cells positive for TLRs 11–13 were mostly of myeloid origin, CD11b+ cells.
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the expression of TLRs 11–13 in normal and
parasite infected mouse brains and suggests a role for them in CNS infections.

Background
Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most common parasitic
disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the
larvae of Taenia solium [1]. This disease is a public health
problem in many third world and developing countries
[1-3]. The symptomatic phase of the disease includes clinical signs such as epilepsy [2], increased intracranial (i.c.)
pressure, obstructive hydroencephalus, stroke, and
encephalitis [1,4]. Autopsy specimens of symptomatic
patients reveal evidence of inflammation consisting of a
chronic granulomatous reaction [4]. The observed inflam-

mation probably is detrimental. Considering the CNS is
devoid of a classically defined lymphatic system, the
innate immune response might play a major role in this
process.
Toll-like receptors are key host molecules in innate
immune responses during infections [5]. To date, thirteen
mammalian TLR paralogues have been identified (10 in
humans and 12 in mice) [6]. These receptors are highly
conserved proteins that recognize distinct mutation resistant molecular patterns common to pathogens, termed

pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [7,8].
Ligand recognition by TLRs culminates invariably in the
manifestation of inflammatory responses and induction
of adaptive immune responses [9,10]. Growing evidence
suggests that TLRs 2, 3, 4, and 9 participate in host
immune responses in a variety of CNS diseases [11-23].
Furthermore, recent studies have shown that several nervous tissue cells upregulate particular TLRs as a result of
infection, trauma, or autoimmune disease [24-29]. However, little information is available for TLR functions in
NCC; indeed, the expression profile of TLRs 11–13 is
unknown in any CNS disease.
In an experimental murine model for NCC, mice receive
intracranial (i.c.) inoculations of Mesocestoides corti (M.
corti) metacestodes. The brain immune response in this
model is associated with a predominant TH1 pathway of
cytokine responses [30,31]. Analysis of the expressions
and distributions of TLRs 1–9 suggested that M. corti parasite infection increased both gene expression and protein
levels of each TLRs1–9 several fold except TLR5 where
only the mRNA was upregulated [12]. In addition, these
TLRs were differentially distributed among various CNS
cell types and infiltrating leukocytes. In this study, we preformed gene specific Real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) analysis to detect TLRs 11–13 at the mRNA level
for both infected and mock-infected mice. In situ immunofluoresence (IF) microscopy, using antibodies specific
for each of the TLRs in combination with antibodies for
distinct cell surface markers, determined the expression of
TLRs by particular cell types in infected and uninfected
brains. The data obtained from these two approaches
implicate TLRs 11–13 in host immune surveillance in the
CNS, particularly in NCC.

Methods
Mice
Female Balb/c mice used in this study were purchased
from the National Cancer Institute Animal Program
(Bethesda, MD). Experiments were conducted under the
guidelines of the IACUC, UTSA, University of Texas System, the US Department of Agriculture, and the National
Institutes of Health.
Murine model of neurocysticercosis
In this study we used a well characterized mouse model of
NCC developed in our laboratory [30,32]. Briefly, we
maintained larvae of M. corti parasites by serial, intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculations of 6–8 wk old female Balb/c
mice. We harvested the larvae aseptically and induced
murine NCC by intracranial injections of 50 μl of Hank's
Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) containing approximately
40 parasites into 3–5 week old mice under short term
anesthesia. Mock infected control mice were injected by

http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/5/1/53

the intracranial route with 50 μl sterile HBSS using the
same protocol.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis
To determine the CNS gene expression of TLRs 11–13 in
murine NCC, brains were removed from infected and
mock infected control mice at 1, 3, 6, and 10 wk post
infection (p.i.) (n = 3 in each group). Animals were perfused prior to sacrifice to avoid RNA contamination from
blood cells. Briefly, mice were anaesthetized with 100 μl
of mouse cocktail containing 100 mg/ml of ketamine and
20 mg/ml of rompum (Laboratory animal resource, UTHSCSA, TX) and perfused with 10 ml of PBS, pH 7.4
through the left ventricle. Brains were immediately
removed after perfusion and total RNA was extracted
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers' instructions. Real-time PCR analysis of these samples, using SYBR green as the detection dye, measured the
expression levels of TLR-specific mRNAs. One microgram
of total RNA from either infected or mock infected mice
was reverse transcribed into cDNA by using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit according to the manufacturers' instructions (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).
Transcript levels of the housekeeping ribosomal 18S and
TLRs 11–13 were PCR amplified in each sample by using
specific primers (Advanced Nucleic Acids Core Facility,
UTHSCSA, TX). Sequences of the specific primers used for
18S and TLRs 11–13 are as follows: 18S (sense) 5'-CATGTGGTGTTGAGGAAAGCA-3' and (anti sense) 5'-GTCGTGGGTTCTGCATGATG-3'; TLR11 (sense) 5'-TCCTTCCT
CTGATTAGCTGTCCTAA-3' and (antisense) 5'-TCCACATAATTTCCACCAACAAGT-3'; TLR12 (sense) 5'-GCCGCCA
TTCCAAGCTA TC-3' and (antisense) 5'-CTCCACAGTCCGAGGTACAACTT-3'; and TLR13 (sense) 5'-ATGGCA
CAAAACGGAGAAGAA-3' and (antisense) 5'-CTTTGTATACCCATGCCTCATCAG-3'. The target expression levels were normalized to levels of the house keeping 18S in
the same sample. The normalized values give the relative
abundance of mRNA for each TLR gene.
Antibodies
Anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from the following companies: TLR11 from Serotec (Raleigh, NC), TLRs
12–13 from Imgenex (San Diego, CA.), biotinylated or RPhycoerythrin (PE) conjugated CD11b [myeloid cells]
from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA.), and Biotinylated
Neuronal nuclear protein [Neun] from US Biological
(Swampscott, MA.). Anti-mouse glial fibrillary protein
[GFAP] (Pharmingen) was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488
(Molecular Probes) according to manufacturers' instructions. For indirect immunofluoresence, rabbit anti-TLRs
11, 12, and 13 followed by Alexa 488 conjugated (green)
chicken anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) or Rhodamine
red-conjugated (red) goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson laboratory) were used. Biotinylated primary

antibodies were detected using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled
streptavidin (Molecular Probes).
Immunofluorescence
We used in situ immunofluorescence (IF) to detect tissue
expression and distribution of TLRs in the CNS. Parasite
infected brains were analyzed at various times post infection (1 wk, 3 wk, and 6 wk) and compared to mockinfected brains from control animals. Brains were immediately removed after perfusion (as described above),
embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT)
medium, and snap frozen as previously described [12,33].
Serial horizontal cryosections, 10 μm in thickness, were
placed on silane prep slides (Sigma Biosciences, St. Louis,
Mo). One in every five slides was fixed in formalin for 12
min at room temperature and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. The remaining slides were air dried overnight
and fixed in fresh acetone for 20s at room temperature.
Acetone-fixed sections were wrapped in aluminum foil
and stored at -80°C or processed immediately for IF.

IF analysis determined the location of individual TLRs in
brain sections. All steps were carried out at room temperature. Sections were incubated with TLR-specific primary
antibodies in PBS buffer with 3% host serum to prevent
non-specific binding. After 1 hr, sections were washed
seven times for 3 min each in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6
with 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 30 min. Sections were then washed
seven times 3 min each in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 with
0.1% Tween-20. The above mentioned procedures were
sequentially repeated for double IF staining. The sections
were mounted using FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem, La
Jolla, CA) containing 0.3 μM 4', 6'-diamidino-2-phenylidole (DAPI)-diacetate (Molecular Probes). Additional
control staining was performed to rule out any nonspecific staining. In each case, sections were blocked with saturating concentrations of appropriate host serum
antibodies to eliminate false positive staining due to FcRmediated nonspecific binding. Staining in the absence of
primary antibodies provided additional negative controls.
Quantification of TLRs 11–13 protein expression
Sections of brains from mock-infected and NCC mice
were stained with specific anti-TLR antibodies followed by
labeled secondary antibodies to quantify the differences
in TLR 11–13 protein levels. Images at 20× magnification
of a number of brain areas from the entire brain of each
mock infected and NCC animal were taken using identical
camera settings so that the number and intensity of pixels
would reflect the differences in their protein expression.
The atlas of the mouse brain and spinal cord book by Sidman RL [34] provided neuroanatomy guidance to select
identical brain areas for analysis. Protein level of a particular TLR was determined by measuring the area (number

http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/5/1/53

of pixels) and fluorescent intensity (average intensity of
pixels) of the staining from twenty four images captured
randomly in the CNS parenchyma from each mock and
parasite infected brain exhibiting TLR protein staining on
nervous tissue cells. The unit area of each image was 0.172
sq. mm. Analysis was performed by using the IP Lab 4.0
imaging software (BD Biosciences Bioimaging, Rockville
MD). The relative TLR protein expression was calculated
by multiplying the number of pixels (area) by the average
intensity of pixels.
Statistical analysis
We used the Student's t-test for comparison of means of
different groups [SIGMA PLOT 8.0 (Systat Software, San
Jose, CA)]. A P value less than 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

arbitrary units. The normalized values corresponding to the

higher level of TLR13 gene expression. (Fig. 1). Upon
infection, gene expression was significantly upregulated at
1 wk p.i. (P < 0.001). At 3 wk p.i., mRNAs of TLR11 and
TLR12 almost returned to normal baseline levels and
remained so at 6 wk p.i. (Fig. 1) and 10 wk p.i. (data not
shown). In contrast, gene expression of TLR13 was significantly upregulated at all the post infection times tested.
This upregulation was greatest at 1 wk p.i. with a relatively
lower level at later stages (3 wk, 6 wk) (Fig. 1) and 10 wk
(data not shown). Among TLRs 11–13, expression of
TLR13 was the highest in both normal and parasitic
infected brains and remained at an elevated level throughout infection (Fig. 1). These results indicate that TLR 11–
13 mRNAs are expressed in normal, uninfected mouse
brains and their levels of expression increase during parasite infection.
Expression and distribution of TLR 11–13 proteins among
nervous tissue and infiltrating immune cell types
In situ IF microscopy analyses revealed the distribution of
TLR 11–13 proteins in brain tissues from mock infected
control mice and NCC mice. Brain tissue cells were determined by their characteristic morphology together with
cell markers: microglia (CD11b), astrocytes (GFAP), and
neurons (NeuN). Surface markers helped identify infiltrating cells: macrophages/microglia cells (CD11b), dendritic cells (CD11c), B-cells (CD19), and αβ T cells (TCR
β chain). Brain tissues were analyzed at 1 wk, 3 wk, and 6
wk p.i. At least three mice were analyzed per time point
with reproducible results. TLRs 11–13 staining was found
to be upregulated in the CNS as a result of infection (Fig.
2, 3, 4).
TLR11
TLR11 IF staining was evident in brain tissue cells of both
uninfected (Fig. 2A and 2E) and infected mice (Fig. 2B, C,
D and 2F), and in infiltrating immune cells during parasite infection (Fig 2H). In the uninfected animals, TLR11
expression was detected at a low basal level mostly in neurons as shown in red color in the insert of a portion of the
frame in Fig. 2E (colliculus posterior). The positive staining was present in the frontal cortex, anterior-posterior
and external colliculi. In addition, TLR11 expression in
neurons was visible in the stratum pyramidale hippocampi (CA1 and CA2), but not in CA3 neurons. At 1 wk
p.i., TLR11 protein levels increased in the above mentioned brain areas (Fig. 2B, colliculus posterior), and further increased by 3 wk p.i (Fig. 2C). However, at 6 wk p.i.,
TLR11 protein levels decreased (Fig. 2D) to levels similar
to 1 wk p.i. (Fig. 2B). Morphological, anatomical correlation, and colocalization of TLR11 and Neun staining
strongly suggested that the upregulated TLR11 expression
was mainly in neurons (Fig. 2F). We quantified protein
expression by measuring the mean pixel intensity. Figure
2l shows upregulated TLR11 protein expression in para-

site infected brain at 3 wk p.i. Staining, however, was
undetected in the nervous tissue cells present in the cerebellum and periventricular and leptomeningeal (LM)
areas in either uninfected or in parasite infected NCC
mice.
The highest number of infiltrating cells expressed TLR11
in infected brain tissue. Immunofluorescent staining
detected no TLR11 infiltrating cells in mock infected
mouse brain (Fig. 2G). At 1 wk p.i. about half of the
immune cells present in meninges and ventricles were
positive for TLR11 protein (Fig. 2H, third ventricle). However, as the length of time p.i. increased, the number of
TLR11 positive leukocytes progressively declined. At 3 wk
p.i. only a small number of infiltrating cells (~5%)
expressed TLR11 protein. At 6 wk p.i., TLR11 positive
infiltrating cells were barely present. This is in contrast to
the maximal staining observed for TLR11 in nervous tissue cells at 3 wk in NCC mice. Double IF analysis with
anti-TLR11 and antibodies to cell surface markers specific
for various immune cells indicated that the majority of
TLR11 positive cells were CD11b positive myeloid cells
(~90%). A few CD11c positive dendritic cells (approximately 5%) were also present (data not shown). However,
as microglia also express both CD11b and CD11c, it is
possible that some of these TLR11 positive cells detected
in the extraparencymal areas of CNS can be migrating
microglia as well.
TLR12
TLR12 expression was evident in brain tissue cells of both
uninfected (Fig. 3A and 3E) and infected mice (Fig. 3B, C,
D and 3F). The expression in nervous tissue was generally
similar to TLR11 expression with respect to cell types and
their location. However, TLR12 protein levels in brain
areas as well as the number of positive cells in a particular
area appeared to be less than TLR11. TLR12 positive cells
in normal or mock-infected animals were fewer in
number and displayed only low levels of protein (Fig. 3A
&3E). The number of TLR12 positive nervous tissue cells
increased at 1 wk p.i. (Fig. 3B). These induced effects were
even more pronounced and appeared to reach a maximal
expression level at 3 wk p.i. (Fig. 3C and Fig. 3F, yellow/
orange). At 6 wk p.i. TLR12 protein levels, measured by
both intensity of staining and number of positive cells,
substantially decreased (Fig. 3D). Measurement of mean
pixel intensity of TLR12 staining confirmed that parasite
infection increased expression of TLR12 protein at 3 wk
p.i. in the whole brain (Fig. 3G) as compared to the controls.

Similar to TLR11, among nervous tissue cells, TLR12
staining was abundant in neurons (Fig. 3E, red in the
insert e' &3F), but not in astrocytes and ependymal cells
(data not shown). In addition, TLR12 staining was present

in brain areas such as the anterior-posterior and external
colliculi and pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus
(CA1 and CA2). However, their pattern of expression was
different in infiltrating immune cells where only a few
immune cells (approximately 5%) were positive for
TLR12. The TLR12 positive infiltrating cells were mostly
CD11b positive myeloid cells (data not shown). Taken
together, the constitutive expression of TLR12 in normal
brain and its increased expression during NCC suggest a
possible role in CNS function.

TLR13
TLR13 expression was evident in brain tissue cells of both
uninfected (Fig. 4A and 4E) and infected mice (Fig. 4B, C,
D, 4F and 4G). TLR13 staining was predominantly in neuronal cells of both uninfected and infected mice (Fig. 4A–
G). In mock infected/normal mouse brain, TLR13 was
present in some astrocytes in periventricular areas and in
proximity to the meninges (data not shown). However, a
much greater number of neurons expressed TLR13 in
these brains (Fig. 4A and 4E, red in the insert e'). In nor-

mal uninfected animals, a few blood vessels, microglia
and ependymal cells were positive for TLR13 (data not
shown). The positively stained neurons were in the cerebral cortex adjoining fissura longitudinales, frontal cortex,
and anterior-posterior and external colliculi. Astrocytes
for TLR13 were solely in the periventricular, and pial and
subpial areas. In comparison to TLR11 and 12, TLR13
expression was present in additional areas including
periventricular areas, fissure longitudinalis cerebri and
CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus that were
negative for TLR11 and TLR12 staining.
Parasite infection produced higher levels of TLR13 protein
by several fold (Fig. 4B, C, D, 4F, G and 4H). After reaching maximal expression at 3 wk p.i. (Fig. 3C), levels of
TLR13 progressively decreased at 6 wk p.i. (Fig. 4D), but
always exhibited elevated levels irrespective of the length
of time post infection, even at 10 wk p.i (data not shown).
The increased expression of TLR13 at 3 wk p.i. was compared with mock infected mice and expressed as mean
pixel intensity (Fig. 4H). TLR13 staining was most evident
in nervous tissue cells of infected mice, predominantly in
neuronal cells (Fig. 4F). A few infiltrating CD11b myeloid
cells were also detected positive for TLR13 (data not
shown). In addition to neurons, increased TLR13 expression was present in other CNS cells including astrocytes
(Fig 4G), Purkinje cells, ependymal cells and endothelial
cells of pial blood vessels (Fig 4G, arrow points to positive
pial vessel). A striking increase in TLR13 expression was
apparent in terms of both intensity and numbers of astrocytes expressing them. The increased staining in astrocytes
was most obvious in periventricular and leptomeningeal
white matter areas and in the cerebellar white matter of
the brain. In contrast, astrocytes present in parenchymal
gray matter areas were not positive for TLR13 staining. The
maximum numbers of neurons and astrocytes expressing
TLR13 was observed at 3 wk p.i. (Fig. 4G, yellow). Nevertheless, similar to TLR12, TLR13 expression was predominantly in neurons (Fig. 4E and 4F, yellow/orange color in
merged image).

Discussion
Historically, the CNS has been regarded as an immuneprivileged organ [35]. However, we now recognize that
the CNS possesses active immune processes and control
mechanisms [36]. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
that constitute the recognition system may be involved in
altered brain homeostasis and several CNS diseases with
diverse causes such as experimental brain injury caused by
stereotactic transection of axons in the entorhinal cortex
[37], ischemia [38-42], and autoimmune diseases [43].
Signaling through PRRs appears to elicit innate immune
responses that eventually culminate in specific adaptive
immune responses [44] and could conceivably generate
neuroprotective benefits [27]. In this report we studied

http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/5/1/53

the expression and distribution of TLRs 11–13 in the
brain under normal physiological conditions and during
murine NCC. Previously only one study reported mRNA
expression of TLR 13 in the CNS after Semliki Forest Virus
(SFV) infection [45]. This is the first report demonstrating
the expression of TLRs 11–13 in the CNS following infection.
This study and our previous findings [12] indicate that
TLRs 1–13 exhibit differential expression and regulation
in normal and NCC mouse brains. TLR2 and TLR13 were
expressed at high levels in almost all CNS cell types both
in the uninfected and parasite infected brain. However,
TLR13 seems to be highly expressed in neurons while
TLR2 is more abundant in astrocytes. Nevertheless, high
upregulation following infection of both TLR2 and TLR13
in astrocytes and their foot processes that terminate at
blood vessels may provide necessary signals for initiation
of infiltration of immune cells to the CNS and the subsequent adaptive immune response [46]. This observation
could be important in understanding the role of particular
TLRs in pathological processes unique to brain tissue, specifically during NCC.
Vertebrate TLRs can be divided into six subfamilies based
on the similarity of amino acid composition, extracellular
leucine rich repeat (LLR) length and phylogenetic analysis. The TLR2 subfamily includes TLR1, 2, and 6; TLR9
subfamily: TLR7, 8, and 9; TLR11 subfamily: TLR11, 12,
and 13 [47]. TLR3, TLR4 and TLR5 subfamilies each consists of a single member [7,47]. Among all the TLRs, very
little data detail the functions and mechanisms of action
of TLRs 11–13. One major hindrance is the absence of
knowledge about their ligands. TLR11 apparently recognizes uropathogenic bacteria [48]. Usually TLRs belonging to a particular family recognize a particular class of
ligands, PAMPs, presumably due to selective pressure for
specific PAMP recognition. For example, the TLR2 subfamily is specific for lipopeptide, the TLR3 family for
dsRNA, the TLR4 family for LPS, the TLR5 family for flagellin, and the TLR7–9 subfamilies for nucleic acid and
heme motifs [8,49-52]. A recent report indicated a profilin-like molecule from the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma
gondii interacts with TLR11 generating a potent interleukin-12 (IL-12) response in murine dendritic cells that
is dependent on myeloid differentiation factor 88 [53].
Ligands for the other TLRs suggest that PAMPs for TLRs
11–13 are likely to be protein components. Other studies
from our laboratory indicate that M. corti metacestodes
release carbohydrate containing molecules directly upon
invasion whereas other glycoconjugates are secreted
throughout the infection process [54-56]. These molecules may potentially act as specific PAMPs that have not
yet been described for TLRs. It may be also possible that
infections induce cytokines indirectly to stimulate the

production of particular TLR proteins [55-57]. In this
light, it is of interest to observe that TLRs 11–13 were
detected at a lower level at 6 wk p.i. as compared to 1 wk
and 3 wk p.i. In the NCC model, acute infection with M.
corti is associated with a TH1 response early during infection (1–5 wk). However, after 5 wk p.i., a mixed TH1/2
immune responses along with expression of IL-10 are
detected [30]. Such anti-inflammatory responses may
contribute to the decreased expression of TLRs 11–13 later
in infection helping to diminish inflammation induced
tissue damage.
TLRs have a major role in host inflammatory responses.
Increasing evidence also indicates that TLRs have a major
role in several inflammatory CNS pathologies [58-62].
The critical question is whether TLRs have other roles
besides inflammation that may be important in diseases
and other CNS functions. In this light, constitutive expression and infection-induced upregulation of particular TLR
11–13 proteins in distinct nervous tissue cell types, especially in neurons is of interest. One possibility is that neurons are able to recognize some forms of infection.
Previous studies indicated that neurons express TLR2
[12,63] and TLR3 [45,64]. However, in the latter study,
unlike glial cells, neuroblastoma cells could not synthesize IFN-α or pro-inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation. Alternatively, or in addition, perhaps activation of
neurons, astrocytes and even endothelial cells of blood
vessels [27,64-66], via TLRs 11–13 could augment the
neuroprotective functions. Indeed, activation of TLR3 is
correlated with the production of neuroprotective, angiogenic and migratory factors by astrocytes [24]. TLR signaling is even involved in adult neurogenesis [67,68].
Although the vertebrate TLRs are not fast-evolving genes,
TLRs 11–13 are most divergent compared to other TLRs
[47] suggesting possible alternate functions other than
recognition of PAMPs. Emerging evidence suggests that
TLRs recognize several host molecules during pathological conditions. It is reasonable to expect that TLR recognition and interaction with host molecules might
participate in normal homeostatic processes as well.
Understanding TLR 11–13 functions in specific CNS cell
types and the ligands they recognize should provide
insight into their roles in the CNS under normal physiological condition as well as during infection.

Conclusion
In the present study, we showed that TLRs 11–13 are
expressed in the CNS and their expression was significantly upregulated during murine NCC. TLR 11–13 proteins were abundantly expressed in neurons of both
normal and parasite infected mouse brains. An enhanced
understanding of TLR 11–13 functions in specific CNS
cell types, particularly in neurons, should provide insight

http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/5/1/53

into their role in initiation of immune reactions and deleterious sequelae or perhaps possible neuroprotective
roles in chronic infections, particularly in CNS parasitic
infection.
