Abstract
Background: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are characterized by high levels of polymorphism and linkage
disequilibrium (LD), important characteristics to study the genetic background of human populations and their
genetic structure. Here, we analyse the allele distribution and LD extent of HLA class I and II in São Miguel Island
population (Azores archipelago, Portugal).
Findings: The sample set was composed of 106 healthy blood donors living in São Miguel Island obtained from the
anonymized Azorean DNA bank. HLA class I (-A, -B and -Cw) and class II (-DRB1, -DQB1, -DPA1 and -DPB1) genotyping
was performed by PCR-SSP Olerup SSP™ (GenoVision Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Genetic diversity values, based on the 7 loci, ranged from 0.821 both for HLA-DPA1 and -DQB1 to 0.934 for HLA-B, with
a mean value of 0.846. Analysis of 5 HLA-A-Cw-B-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes revealed that A*01-Cw*07-B*08-DRB1*03DQB1*02 is the most frequent in São Miguel (7.9%) followed by A*24-B*08-Cw*07-DRB1*03-DQB1*02 (3.8%). In
addition, even though the reports of high LD for HLA markers in worldwide populations, São Miguel islanders do not
have extensive LD (average D' = 0.285).
Conclusions: In summary, the results demonstrate high variability of HLA in São Miguel Island population as well as
absence of genetic structure and extensive LD. The data here presented suggest that in São Miguel islanders
autoimmune diseases studies will necessarily encompass a more focused analysis of HLA extended haplotypes as well
as the evaluation of other non-HLA candidate genes.

Background
The Azores is a Portuguese archipelago composed of nine
islands distributed by three geographical groups: the
Eastern (São Miguel and Santa Maria), the Central (Terceira, Pico, Faial, São Jorge and Graciosa) and the Western (Flores and Corvo). The Portuguese explorers, who
discovered the archipelago in 1427, only started the settlement in 1439 through a long and difficult process. Historical data report a contribution from people with
genetic backgrounds other than Portuguese, including
Flemish, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Scottish, Jewish, and also from Moorish prisoners and black slaves
from Guinea, Cape Verde and São Tomé [1]. São Miguel

is the largest island of the Azores and is composed of
131,609 inhabitants (2001 Census, Portugal National
Institute of Statistics). Several studies have been performed to characterize the genetic pool of the Azoreans
[2-10]. These studies report a high genetic variability and
heterogeneity of the Azorean population, explained by
the settling history of the islands, where a major contribution of mainland Portugal individuals is evident. Moreover, the data revealed absence of population structure,
even though the archipelago's geographical discontinuity
and demographic disproportionality. Currently, this
knowledge is being fundamental for the design and development of pharmacogenetic research and genetic studies
in common diseases, such as cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.

(MHC) on 6p21.3, encode polymorphic class I, II and III
molecules that play a major role in the immune response
[11]. In addition, HLA loci are characterized by high levels of polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium (LD),
important characteristics to study the genetic background of human populations, as well as their presentday genetic structure. Here, we analyse the allele frequency and LD extent of HLA class I and II, in order to
identify its diversity and haplotype distribution and to
gain further insight in the potential use of this genomic
region for the study of autoimmune diseases in the São
Miguel Island population.

Materials and methods
Population samples, genotyping and statistical analysis

The sample set was composed of 106 healthy blood
donors living in São Miguel Island obtained from the
anonymized Azorean DNA bank located at the Hospital
of Divino Espírito Santo of Ponta Delgada, EPE, the main
hospital in Azores [12]. HLA class I (-A, -Cw and -B) and
class II (-DRB1, -DQB1, -DPA1 and -DPB1) genotyping
was performed by PCR-SSP Olerup SSP™ (GenoVision
Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After
electrophoresis on a 4% agarose gel stained with SYBR®
Green, PCR products were visualized, followed by HLA
allele identification using the Helmberg-SCORE™ software version 3.320T (Olerup SSP AB, Saltsjöbaden, Sweden).
Average gene diversity and estimation of the HLA haplotypes was carried out using Arlequin v3.0 [13]. Evaluation of standardized multiallelic disequilibrium
coefficient, D', was performed by the Haploxt application
from the GOLD software. Average D' values were calculated by a simple mathematical mean of all values
obtained for each marker pair. Nei's FST genetic distance
matrix was computed between pairs of populations by
DISPAN [14] and used to construct a Neighbor-Joining
(NJ) tree by PHYLIP 3.63 [15]. We employed TreeView
1.6.6 [16] to display tree phylogenies obtained from NJ. In
order to obtain the best results concerning population
comparisons a compromise between the number of populations and HLA loci was performed. Consequently,
HLA-DPA1 and -DPB1 were excluded from analysis. FST
values were based on allele frequencies obtained in an
online database (HLA-Allele Project; http://www.allelefrequencies.net/), in 19 populations for 5 HLA loci: São
Miguel, Terceira, Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, Turkey, Morocco, Japan, Mongolia Oold, Mongolia Tsaatan,
Mongolia Khalkha, Basque, Ibiza, Majorca, Majorca Jewish, Chuetas, Minorca and Jordania. Along with FST values, 5 loci haplotypes were searched in the same database
to further investigate the possible origins of the early settlers.

Results
The analysis of the HLA alleles in the São Miguel Island
population (Table 1) revealed for the HLA-A locus a total
of 16 different alleles, 13 HLA-Cw and 24 HLA-B alleles.
Regarding HLA class II loci, we found 22 HLA-DPB1, 13
HLA-DRB1, 5 HLA-DQB1 and 6 HLA-DPA1 different
alleles. HLA-B and HLA-DPB1 are the two loci with the
highest numbers of alleles, suggesting higher diversity for
these markers. The highest frequency observed, 0.462,
was in HLA-DPA1 gene, which shows a low number of
alleles. In contrast, the lowest frequency identified (0.5%)
was present in HLA-A, -B and -DPB1 (Table 1). Genetic
diversity values ranged from 0.821 both for HLA-DPA1
and -DQB1 to 0.934 for HLA-B, with a mean value of
0.846 (Table 2). Overall, HLA allele frequencies in São
Miguel, mainland Portugal and other European populations demonstrated absence of statistically significant differences (GST = 0.03; data not shown). According to
Wright [17] values of GST smaller than 0.05 indicate little
genetic differentiation.
Considering the 7 HLA loci, haplotype determination
demonstrates a total of 176 different haplotypes corresponding to an 83.0% discriminatory power. Analysis of 5
HLA-A-Cw-B -DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes was also performed (see Additional file 1 for details). The results indicate that A*01-Cw*07-B*08-DRB1*03-DQB1*02 is the
most frequent in São Miguel (7.9%), followed by A*24Cw*07-B*08-DRB1*03-DQB1*02 (3.8%). Both A*02Cw*05-B*44-DRB1*04-DQB1*03 and A*29-Cw*16-B*44DRB1*07-DQB1*02 are present at a frequency of 1.9%. A
total of 157 haplotypes were matched against worldwide
populations (HLA-Allele Project; http://www.allelefrequencies.net/). The results showed that the second most
frequent haplotype, above described, appears only on
Tunisia. Moreover, just 9 haplotypes (Haplotype number
- HN - 1, 29, 37, 42, 84, 85, 101, 104 and 112; see Additional file 1 for details) were identified in this database.
Linkage disequilibrium was based on the calculation of
standardized multiallelic disequilibrium coefficient, D'.
The range values are 0.163 for HLA markers DPA1DQB1 and 0.712 for DQB1-DRB1 (Table 2). This wide
variation averages 0.285 for the 7 loci. Curiously, the
genetically closest markers (DPA1-DPB1, 0.011 Mb; D' =
0.398) do not present the highest value of D' (DQB1DRB1, 0.081 Mb; D' = 0.712). A poor correlation between
distance (Mb) and D' is observed, although there is a
decrease of LD values over physical distance increase, as
expected.
In order to obtain a graphical view of the genetic similarity between São Miguel (106 individuals, 5 HLA loci)
and other populations, we computed Nei's genetic distances and depicted them in Figure 1. Interestingly, São
Miguel is closer to Morocco population than to Terceira,

Discussion
Extensive studies have been performed in several geographical areas to characterize the diversity of HLA
genetic markers. These evaluations allow a better knowledge of the population structure considering non-neutral
markers, as well as an understanding of the influence of
evolutionary processes in the overall signature of a population. These genetic data are crucial for the comprehen-

sion of the molecular ethiology and epidemiology of
common diseases. In general, the data here presented
corroborate previous works [3,6-10], where Azoreans
including São Miguel islanders show high values of
genetic diversity when compared to mainland Portugal
and other European populations. This may be a direct
consequence of the Azorean settlement, with a major
contribution of mainland Portuguese (~60%) and, to a
lesser extent, Flemish, Spanish, French, Italians, Germans, Scottish, Jews, Moors and blacks from Guinea,
Cabo Verde and São Tomé. Previous studies of HLA

markers in mainland Portugal (3 loci, -A, -B and -DRB1,
[18]) and in Azores (6 loci, -A, -Cw, -B, -DRB1, -DQA1
and -DQB1, [5]) demonstrate values of average diversity
of 0.92 in both populations. The results obtained in the
present study, based in 7 loci, showed a smaller value
(0.84). This may be explained by the fact that Spinola et
al. [5] used a high-resolution methodology to genotype
HLA. Because alleles A*0101 and A*0102 are not considered the same allele (A*01), this methodology allows the
identification of a higher number of different alleles.
Nonetheless, the data show no significant differences
between allele frequencies in São Miguel and Terceira
islands. Considering HLA alleles distribution, the presence of -A*30 and -A*80, commonly found in sub-Saharan populations [19-21], in São Miguel validates historic
records of slave settlers. In addition, the presence of
alleles -B*35, -B*57 and -B*15 suggest a direct contribu-

tion of Moorish prisoners in Azores [22-24]. Nevertheless, the influence of early Portuguese settlers can not be
ruled out since allele frequencies are similar. In general,
these results are corroborated by the NJ tree (Figure 1),
where São Miguel shows influence of both African and
European populations.
Linkage disequilibrium is considered a good measure of
population structure. According to Sanchez-Mazas [25]
HLA-DPB1, located on the centromeric side of the HLA
chromosomal region, does not show high values of LD
with the other HLA loci. Interestingly, in the present
study, the lowest values of D' observed are related with
this marker. This result is explained by the high recombination region involving one or several hotspots, which
separates HLA-DPB1 from the rest of the other HLA loci.
Abecasis et al. [26] discuss that a value of D' = 0.33, which
corresponds to a 10-fold increase in the required sample
size, is commonly taken as the minimum usable amount
of LD. Considering the 21 possible HLA loci combinations, 17 demonstrated values inferior to 0.33, and only 2
(Cw-B and DQB1-DRB1) showed values significantly
higher (0.571 and 0.712, respectively). The HLA data
reported by Meyer et al. [27] indicate a significant LD
between all HLA loci in around 40 worldwide studied
populations. The present research did not indicate large
D' values and corroborates the results obtained by Service
et al. [28] and Branco et al. [9,10], where the Azoreans
have the lowest values of LD when compared with isolated and outbred populations.
HLA diversity in human populations is an important
aspect of disease epidemiology, especially autoimmune
disorders, such as type I diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis
and celiac disease. According to Bakker et al. [29], the
association of HLA alleles and/or haplotypes with disease
susceptibility may be confounded by the presence of population stratification in neighboring HLA and non-HLA
genomic regions. The high variability of HLA, and the
absence of genetic structure and extensive LD, here demonstrated, suggest that autoimmune diseases studies in
São Miguel islanders will necessarily encompass a more
focused analysis of HLA extended haplotypes, as well as
the evaluation of other non-HLA candidate genes.
