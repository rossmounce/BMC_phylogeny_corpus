Abstract
Background: Understanding the normal temporal variation in the human microbiome is critical to developing
treatments for putative microbiome-related afflictions such as obesity, Crohn’s disease, inflammatory bowel disease
and malnutrition. Sequencing and computational technologies, however, have been a limiting factor in performing
dense time series analysis of the human microbiome. Here, we present the largest human microbiota time series
analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints.
Results: We find that despite stable differences between body sites and individuals, there is pronounced variability
in an individual’s microbiota across months, weeks and even days. Additionally, only a small fraction of the total
taxa found within a single body site appear to be present across all time points, suggesting that no core temporal
microbiome exists at high abundance (although some microbes may be present but drop below the detection
threshold). Many more taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members.
Conclusions: DNA sequencing and computational advances described here provide the ability to go beyond
infrequent snapshots of our human-associated microbial ecology to high-resolution assessments of temporal
variations over protracted periods, within and between body habitats and individuals. This capacity will allow us to
define normal variation and pathologic states, and assess responses to therapeutic interventions.

Background
As more attention is paid to viewing ourselves as a
supraorganism, comprising interacting microbial and
human cellular and genetic components, it is apparent
that much more precise understanding is needed of
what constitutes normal temporal variations in our
microbial community structures and functions. Variation
in the human microbiome within and between our various body habitats, lifecycle stages, and cultural settings
is largely unexplored. High-resolution time series studies
provide a foundation for discriminating between ‘normal’ perturbations and pathologic states, and between
organisms that are simply passing through a body habitat or are entrenched residents of an ecosystem. Similarly, these types of studies are needed to understand
the immigration and emigration patterns of microbes
between our body sites, between cohabitating individuals, and between ourselves and the myriad of environments we contact on a daily basis [1-3].

The densest human microbiome time series reported
to date studied the response of distal gut microbial communities to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin across three
individuals, with sampling intervals varied from daily to
weekly. Eighteen timepoints were collected per individual in an initial study [4], and between 52 and 56 timepoints were collected per subject in a follow-up study
[5]. In both studies, rapid decreases in alpha diversity
and a characteristic shift in community composition
were observed in association with antibiotic therapy, followed by a rapid post-antibiotic increase in diversity as
the gut community returned to a state similar (but not
identical) to the pre-treatment state. Another dense
human microbiome time series studied 60 fecal samples
over the first 2.5 years of life for a single infant, and illustrated the successional pattern in the human gut
microbiota as a rapidly changing community that develops over time into a community characteristic of that
found in the adult human gut [2].
The availability of radically cheaper sequencing and
analysis, described here, eases constraints on the number of timepoints and body sites that can be compared
in a single study, and paves the way to a finer-grained

understanding of how the human microbiota changes in
different body habitats (including much better estimates
of the relative variability of different body sites within a
subject). Understanding this intrinsic variability will be
crucial for performing power calculations to test
whether antibiotics, probiotics, or other drugs actually
affect the microbiome.
In this study, two healthy subjects, one male (M3) and
one female (F4), one of whom (M3) participated in an
earlier survey [6], were sampled daily at three body sites
(gut (feces), mouth, and skin (left and right palms)), for
15 months (M3) and for 6 months (F4) using an institutional review board-approved protocol. Variable region
4 (V4) of 16S rRNA genes present in each community
sample were amplified by PCR and subjected to multiplex sequencing on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx
(GA-IIx; average read length after quality trimming, 123
± 17 (standard deviation (SD)) nucleotides; 32,266 ±
19,723 (SD) reads per sample; n = 1,422 (M3 samples);
n = 531 (F4 samples); average interval between sampling, 1.12 days). To control for differences across
sequencing platforms and primer pairs, 331 of these
samples had variable region 2 (V2) sequenced on 454
(average read length after quality filtering, 228 ± 11
(SD) nucleotides; 1,072 ± 375 (SD) reads per sample;
n = 171 (M3 samples); n = 160 (F4 samples)). This
study thus provides a key counterpoint to recent studies
of one or a few subjects at tens of timepoints [2-5,7], or
studies that examine hundreds of individuals but only at
one or a few timepoints [6,8-12].

Results and discussion
Stable differences in microbial communities between
body sites over time

When the samples from Costello et al. [6] and the current study are compared directly, the samples cluster by
body habitat, showing excellent concordance between
the studies (Figure 1a in [6]; Figure 1b in the current
study) despite differences in sequencing technology (454
and Illumina GA-IIx, respectively), mean read length
(229 ± 16 (SD) nucleotides and 123 ± 17 (SD) nucleotides, respectively), and region of the 16S sequenced (V2
and V4, respectively). The UniFrac distances between
the 331 time series samples that were sequenced on
both Illumina and 454 were significantly correlated, as
determined by Procrustes analysis of unweighted UniFrac principal coordinate matrices (M2 = 0.161; Monte
Carlo P < 0.001; Additional file 1) and Pearson correlation of UniFrac distances for pairs of samples (r = 0.91;
P < 0.001). As observed by Costello et al. [6], gut, oral,
and skin bacterial communities were found to be compositionally distinct based on principal coordinates analysis of unweighted UniFrac distances between
communities (UniFrac measures community similarity

based on the degree to which they share branch length
on a phylogenetic tree). The long-term time series
shows for the first time that this body-site differentiation
is highly stable over greater than one year (Figure 1c),
but dynamic within sites over time (Additional files 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Minimal evidence for a temporal core microbiome
between or within body sites

While overall compositional differences between body
sites and individuals were relatively stable, our data also
suggest a surprisingly small temporal ‘core human
microbiota’ within an individual’s body sites (Figure 2)
when we define the ‘core’ as those species-level phylotypes in a given body habitat that were observed across
all sampling events. These data suggest a minimal core
microbiome across time, where the size of the core
decreases as: mouth > gut > right palm ≈ left palm >
across body sites within an individual > across body
sites and individuals.
At this depth of sequencing, many more OTUs are
either persistent community members, which appear in
a given body habitat and remain for an extended period
of time but are not present consistently enough to be
considered core members, or transient community

members, which appear in a body habitat and disappear
soon after (Figure 3). The taxa composing these persistent and transient categories are significantly different
(for example, M3 gut: Gindep, 84.78; P = 1.80 × 10-14). In
M3 gut, both the persistent and transient communities
are dominated by Clostridia, Bacteroidia, and to a lesser
extent Erysipelotrichi. The persistent community is,
however, also composed of Betaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, while the transient community is composed of Actinobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria,
Epsilonproteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiae. Taxonomic summaries of the persistent and transient groups
for all body sites from both individuals are presented in
Additional file 16.
We applied several techniques to control for the possibility of persistent groups being mistaken for transient
groups if they occasionally fell below the detection
threshold. First, in computing the maximum number of

consecutive observations for an OTU, we counted a single zero-count for an OTU as not interrupting a run of
consecutive observations, provided that both adjacent
timepoints achieved non-zero counts for that OTU. Second, we re-sequenced 331 of the time series samples on
the 454 platform, and recomputed the persistent and
transient taxa summaries. We found that, for both individuals, the composition of the persistent gut and oral
communities were not significantly different between
454 and Illumina despite a nearly 40-fold difference in
sequencing depth. However, the persistent palm communities were significantly different in both cases. A
possible confounding factor in this comparison is primer
bias, as the V2 region was sequenced on 454. We therefore performed 1,000 jackknife iterations of this analysis
by subsampling the Illumina data to 5,000 sequences
per sample and recomputing the composition of the
persistent group for each individual and body habitat. In
this analysis, seven of the eight individual/body site
pairs were never significantly different from the persistent community composition on the full Illumina data
set. The one exception was the F4 gut community,
which was significantly different in approximately half of
the iterations. When re-sampled at a depth of 10,000
sequences per sample, the persistent F4 gut community
never achieved significant difference from that determined on the full Illumina data set. The full results of
these analyses are presented in Additional file 17. The
designation of groups as ‘persistent’ was thus highly
reproducible across sequencing platforms and amplicons, although it is still possible that sequencing error
or very low abundance taxa occasionally falling below
the detection threshold could result in underestimated
size of the persistent group.
Temporally dynamic microbial communities and
correlations between body sites

Differences in UniFrac distances in the left and right
palms in adjacent timepoints of both individuals were
significantly correlated (Pearson correlation for M3, r =
0.69, P = 2.07 × 10-46; for F4, r = 0.64, P = 3.77 × 1016
), possibly due to equilibration of microbial communities across palms by physical contact. We did not see
correlations between other body sites. While the magnitude and direction of change in phylogenetic dissimilarity between adjacent timepoints were correlated between
the palm sites, the species-level microbial taxa present
on each hand were not significantly correlated, confirming previous observations that, at a single timepoint, the
left and right hand of a single individual may share relatively few OTUs [13].
For single body sites, within-subject distances were
lower than between-subject distances, suggesting a
stable pattern, consistent across body sites, in between-

Page 4 of 8

subject dissimilarities across time. For example, the
between-subject fecal sample distances were significantly
higher than the within M3 fecal sample distances (t =
15.52; P < 0.001; one-tailed, two sample t-test) and the
within F4 fecal sample distances (t = 33.45; P ≤ 0.001;
one-tailed, two sample t-test).
The microbial community dynamics are especially
apparent in principal coordinates analysis animations
(Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) where the sample types
(subject, body site combinations) are represented as
moving traces against a background of the Costello et
al. data. The traces give an immediate picture of the
variability within each body site, the relative distinctiveness of the sites and the subjects, and the relative speed
of change in each site. Blooms of certain taxa contribute
to the within site dissimilarities over time, as with the
waning and waxing of the relative Proteobacteria abundance in the gut of both M3 and F4 (Additional files 8
and 9, Phylum panel (teal)). Similar patterns are apparent across all taxonomic levels and body sites (Additional files 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). Such
visualizations of microbial community dynamics will add
another dimension to long-term studies of variable clinical states, such as inflammatory bowel disease or drug
treatments, and changes in diet or lifestyle.

Conclusions
Dense, deeply sequenced microbiome time series studies
have been limited by the cost of sequencing, and the
computational power necessary to analyze such studies
has been expensive. Several technical advances made
this study possible. First, using the Illumina sequencer
and the protocol described in [14] reduced sequencing
cost per sample ($11 USD) to below the cost associated
with DNA extraction and PCR ($13). Second, cloud
computing using Amazon Web Services (AWS) allowed
us to perform the bioinformatics analysis for $200 using
open-source and freely available software running on
commodity services. This included the creation of a virtual cluster on AWS composed of 20 eight-core systems
with 68 GB of RAM each (that is, 20 Amazon
m2.4xlarge instances) to cluster approximately 69 million sequences into OTUs. This step alone would have
required 20 days of computation on a desktop machine
with 8 GB of RAM, but was performed on this virtual
cluster in 3 hours for $120.
Figure 2 illustrates the sensitivity of conclusions about
the core microbiome to the definition of the core microbiome: if an OTU is considered here to be a core member only if it is present in all 130 samples, as compared
to 120 of the samples, the size of the core drops to
approximately 5% of OTUs from about 10% of OTUs.
This rapid change in slope beyond 120 samples on the
x-axis does not occur when considering all M3 gut or

Caporaso et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R50
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/5/R50

oral samples rather than only 130 (data not shown), suggesting that this result likely stems from a few nonrepresentative samples, rather than representing an
interesting biological result. The definition of the core
microbiome is thus a crucial consideration, because
depth of sampling, PCR error, sequencing error, analysis
techniques (such as OTU picking method and similarity
threshold), among other factors, will affect whether an
OTU will be observed in a given sample. OTU picking
similarity threshold, in particular, will have a large affect
on the size of the observed core microbiome. As this
threshold is decreased, OTUs represent larger taxonomic groups, and the observed core will increase in
size correspondingly. For example, there is clearly a
temporal core at the phylum level in the fecal samples
studied here composed of Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes
(Additional files 8 and 9). For this reason our results do
not necessarily contradict previous Denaturing Gradient
Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE)-based work in this area
[4,15-17], which is suggestive of a core gut microbiome
but at a coarser phylogenetic resolution and more limited dynamic range. Sampling depth will also considerably affect the definition of the core, and although the
dynamic range of this study is large compared to other
studies of human body habitats, it is possible that
microbes we define as ‘non-core’ still persist at very low
abundance, perhaps in a manner analogous to a seed
bank. Determining the role, if any, of these low-abundance microbes in responding to changes in diet, physiological status, and so on will be a fascinating
challenge for future studies.
Taken together, our observations paint a picture of a
human microbiome that is highly variable over time
(Figures 2 and 3; Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), but from which stable patterns
of similarities and differences among body habitats and
individuals emerge (Figure 1). This temporal variation
may arise from extrinsic factors, such as exposure to
different types of foods, medications, or physical environments (for example, due to travel), or from intrinsic
factors, such as the adaptive immune system. Understanding the influence of these factors on an individual’s microbiota is an additional challenge for future
work.
Although some evidence was found for a high-abundance core microbiome at the 97% OTU level within
body sites over time, particularly in the mouth and gut,
this core appears to represent less than 10% of the total
OTUs when defining the minimum number of samples
to be considered part of the core as 90% of the samples.
This observation does not, however, extend across body
sites, suggesting that a body-wide core temporal microbiome that bridges the habitat types surveyed here does
not exist.

The innovations in sequencing, cloud computing, and
visualization applied here, together with advances in
robust and inexpensive microfluidic sample preparation
techniques, support the development and democratization of inexpensive, informative, and personalized
microbiome-based phenotyping. Specifically, the ability
to collect, process and analyze thousands of sequences
using increasingly available sequencing technologies and
using commercial computing infrastructure will make
the ability to trace changes in the microbiome within
each individual associated with drug administration, disease states, and environmental exposures routine.
Because of the immense subject-to-subject variability in
the microbiome, studies examining temporal variability,
which give a view of dynamics beyond the static pictures
previously available, have the potential to transform our
understanding of what is ‘normal’ in the human body,
and, perhaps, to develop predictive models for the
effects of clinical interventions.

Materials and methods
Sample preparation and sequencing

Sample collection and DNA isolation were performed as
described in Costello et al. [6]; and PCR, sequencing,
and quality filtering of reads were performed as
described in Caporaso et al. [14]. Samples were not collected on days 422 through 437.
To facilitate massively parallel sequencing (1,967 samples), barcodes were reused across six lanes in a single
Illumina GAIIx, with 374, 372, 364, 271, 265, and 323
samples in lanes 1 through 6, respectively (differing
from Caporaso et al. [14], where samples were pooled
and run over seven lanes). Sixteen samples were ultimately excluded from the analysis as fourteen samples
were identified as potentially mislabeled (discussed
below), and the barcodes for two samples were not
found in the sequencing output, likely indicating a problem with amplification for those two samples.
Data analysis

To directly compare these M3/F4 time series samples
with the samples presented in Costello et al. [6], which
sequenced a different variable region (V2) using a different technology (454 FLX), a reference-based OTU picking protocol [18] was applied. After demultiplexing and
quality filtering sequences, 97% OTUs were picked
against the Greengenes database [19] (pre-filtered at
97% identity) using uclust [20]. Reads were assigned to
OTUs based on their best match to a Greengenes
sequence, and reads that did not match a Greengenes
sequence at 97% or greater sequence identity were discarded. The Greengenes taxonomy associated with the
best match in Greengenes was assigned to each OTU,
and the Greengenes tree was used for phylogenetic

Caporaso et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R50
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/5/R50

diversity calculations. These steps and subsequent data
analysis were performed using Quantitative Insights Into
Microbial Ecology (QIIME) on AWS.
Identifying mislabeled samples

To identify potentially mislabeled samples, we used the
random forests classifier [21]. A 2,000-tree forest was
trained on the OTU × Sample Abundance matrix after
evenly sampling to 500 sequences per sample and
removing OTUs present in less than 1% of samples. The
posterior probability that a given sample came from
each of the body habitats (gut, oral cavity, skin) was estimated using only those trees in the forest that did not
contain that sample in their training sets, to avoid overfitting. The classifier considers samples to be mislabeled
when their alleged environment labels have a low posterior probability (<60%). Fourteen such samples were
identified, and these samples were removed from all
analyses.
Core microbiome calculation

The temporal core microbiome across body sites and
individuals (Figure 2) was computed by varying the
minimum number of samples in which an OTU must
be observed to be considered part of the core microbiome, and then determining the number and fraction
of total OTUs observed in each site (or combination of
sites) that are part of the core. To facilitate direct comparison across sample types that contained different
numbers of observations (for example, M3 (all) versus
M3 gut), we randomly subsampled to exactly 130 observations per sample type, corresponding to the sample
type for which we had the fewest observations.
Community membership calculations

The number of consecutive timepoints containing an
OTU (Figure 3) was calculated as the maximum number
of consecutive timepoints where an OTU was observed,
allowing a zero count at a single timepoint to be considered part of a continuous stretch of non-zero counts if
both adjacent timepoints had a non-zero count. This
controls for sampling error as, for example, a long contiguous stretch of non-zero counts for an OTU interrupted by a single zero count for that OTU would likely
indicate a bad sample, rather than a biologically relevant
fact about that OTU in relation to the community. Persistent taxa were defined as those observed in 20% or
more of the timepoints, but with at least 90% of those
observations being consecutive (that is, they appear and
remain present). Transient taxa were defined as those
observed in at least 60% of the samples, but with at
most 75% of those observations being consecutive (that
is, they appear and disappear from the community
frequently).
