Abstract

information

Conclusion: Our work provides evidence for long-term virus-host co-speciation of feline PVs,
indicating that viral diversity in slowly evolving viruses can be used to investigate host species
evolution. These findings, however, should not be extrapolated to other viral lineages without prior
confirmation of virus-host co-divergence.

interactions

Results: The feline PVs all belong to the Lambdapapillomavirus genus, and contain an unusual
second noncoding region between the early and late protein region, which is only present in
members of this genus. Our maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses demonstrate
that the evolutionary relationships between feline PVs perfectly mirror those of their feline hosts,
despite a complex and dynamic phylogeographic history. By applying host species divergence times,
we provide the first precise estimates for the rate of evolution for each PV gene, with an overall
evolutionary rate of 1.95 × 10-8 (95% confidence interval 1.32 × 10-8 to 2.47 × 10-8) nucleotide
substitutions per site per year for the viral coding genome.

refereed research

Background: Estimating evolutionary rates for slowly evolving viruses such as papillomaviruses
(PVs) is not possible using fossil calibrations directly or sequences sampled over a time-scale of
decades. An ability to correlate their divergence with a host species, however, can provide a means
to estimate evolutionary rates for these viruses accurately. To determine whether such an
approach is feasible, we sequenced complete feline PV genomes, previously available only for the
domestic cat (Felis domesticus, FdPV1), from four additional, globally distributed feline species: Lynx
rufus PV type 1, Puma concolor PV type 1, Panthera leo persica PV type 1, and Uncia uncia PV type 1.

Background

clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) [5,6]. To date, the Felis
domesticus PV type 1 (FdPV1) is the only feline PV that was
isolated and completely genomically characterized. This
FdPV1 was found to be closely related to the domestic dog
(canine) oral PV (COPV), and both viruses possess a unique
noncoding intervening sequence between the end of the early
and the beginning of the late protein coding region of their
genome [7,8]. FdPV1 and COPV are classified in two different
species of the genus Lambdapapillomavirus (λ-PV) [9]. Based
on the close relationship between FdPV1 and COPV, and
between their Canidae and Felidae hosts, we suggested that
the most recent common ancestor of these viruses was
present in a common ancestor of cats and dogs, and was
passed on to the Canidae and Felidae descendent lineages,
which subsequently started to diverge [8].

In fast evolving pathogens, genetic sequences usually accumulate sufficient substitutions over relatively limited periods
of time, which allows their evolutionary rates to be estimated
reliably. For such 'measurably evolving populations', the
molecular clock can hence be calibrated using temporal information in serially samples sequences [3]. However, this is not
the case for slowly evolving viruses such as papillomaviruses
(PVs), for which viral sequences sampled decades apart are
almost identical and should be considered as contemporaneous, given the time frame of PV evolution. This was demonstrated by the finding that two isolates of bovine BPV1,
collected from remote cattle populations (from Sweden and
the USA) and approximately 30 years apart, had nearly identical sequences; only five differences were found when comparing 4,807 nucleotides that covered the entire late region
and part of the early region of the genomes [4]. Furthermore,
the lack of fossil calibration has made it practically impossible
to determine longer term rates of evolution for these slowly
evolving viruses. If viruses co-evolve with hosts, however, it
may be possible to use host fossil calibration points to calibrate the viral phylogeny, providing a mechanism to address
interactions between populations or species over longer evolutionary time-frames. The slowly evolving and species-specific PVs provide excellent candidates in which to test the
feasibility of this approach.

This report describes the complete sequencing and evolutionary analysis of four novel felid PVs: Lynx rufus PV type 1
(LrPV1), Puma concolor PV type 1 (PcPV1), Panthera leo persica PV type 1 (PlpPV1), and Uncia uncia PV type 1 (UuPV1).
Our analyses demonstrate that the evolutionary history of the
feline PVs is closely linked to that of their feline hosts, indicating that the host phylogeny can be used to calibrate the viral
evolutionary clock, or conversely that viral diversity in slowly
evolving viruses can provide a means for unraveling ancient
host evolutionary processes.

The Papillomaviridae are a large family of small non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. They can cause benign
and malignant proliferations of the stratified squamous epithelium of the skin and mucosa in a wide variety of vertebrate
species. PVs are highly species specific, or at least they are
restricted to infection of closely related animal species, and it
is likely that most mammal and bird species carry their own
set of PV types.

All characterized PVs have their open reading frames (ORFs)
on one strand of their circular double-stranded DNA genome,
and the ORFs on this coding strand are classified as either
early (E) or late (L), based on the location in the genome. The
LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1, and UuPV1 sequences contain the
seven classical PV major ORFs, encoding five early proteins
(E1, E2, E4, E6, and E7) and two late capsid proteins (L1 and
L2). The exact locations of the ORFs and the size of the predicted proteins, with a comparison with the corresponding
ORF data from FdPV1, are summarized in Additional data file
1. The position of the first nucleotide of the genomes was fixed
corresponding to the start of the first major ORF in the early
region (E6).

Understanding demographic processes in populations has
been a fundamental challenge in evolutionary biology and
population genetics. Inference is often limited by the slow
nature of the accumulation of genetic diversity, particularly in
vertebrate populations, often resulting in a lack of statistical
power [1]. One way to circumvent this problem is to use
changes accumulating in rapidly evolving genetic markers,
such as associated pathogens, to infer the evolutionary history of the host. This approach was recently used to investigate demographic and phylogeographic patterns in cougar
populations (Puma concolor), for which host microsatellite
data revealed only low genetic differentiation [2]. In the same
way, it may be possible to use more slowly evolving viruses to
reconstruct evolutionary relationships between host species.

PV-containing lesions were described in six feline species: the
domestic cat (Felis domesticus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), Florida
panther (Puma concolor coryi, previously named Felis concolor coryi), Asian lion (Panthera leo persica), snow leopard
(Uncia uncia, previously named Panthera uncia), and the

The PV sequences reported in this paper were isolated from
an oral papillomatous lesion on the tongue of a bobcat, a
lesion under the tongue of a Florida panther, a papillomatous
lesion on the ventral surface of the tongue of an Asian lion,
and a lesion on the lower lip of a snow leopard. From these
lesions, the complete genomes of four novel PVs were cloned
and sequenced: LrPV1 (8,233 base pairs [bp]; GenBank:
AY904722), PcPV1 (8,321 bp; GenBank: AY904723), PlpPV1
(8,103 bp; GenBank: AY904724), and UuPV1 (8,078 bp; GenBank: DQ180494).

Apart from the classical URR (NCR1) between the end of L1
and the start of E6, an additional NCR2 between the early and
late protein region is present in the genomes of LrPV1 (position 3,641-4,843, 1,203 nucleotides), PcPV1 (3,614-4,898,
1,285 nucleotides), PlpPV1 (3,710-4,769, 1,060 nucleotides),
and UuPV1 (3,623-4,661, 1,039 nucleotides). This NCR2 is
absent in all other characterized PVs, with the exception of
COPV, FdPV1, and PlPV1 [7,8,11]. Therefore, the presence of
an NCR2 is a unique feature of the members of the genus λPV. No recognizable E1BS, E2BS, or other regulatory and promoter element could be identified in the NCR2.

According to the current PV taxonomic criteria, PV types that
share between 71% and 89% nucleotide identity within the
complete L1 ORF belong to the same species, and different
species within a PV genus share 60% to 70% nucleotide identity in L1 [9]. Based on these criteria, LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1,
and UuPV1 can be classified in the same species as FdPV1
(species 2 of the genus λ-PV), with 73% to 85% nucleotide
identity in L1 among each other and with FdPV1. All feline
PVs belong to the same genus as COPV (species 1 of the genus
λ-PV), which is confirmed by the percentage nucleotide identity in L1 (67% to 69%).

refereed research

The mutual sequence similarities of LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1,
and UuPV1, and their similarities to FdPV1, COPV, the prototype benign cutaneous HPV type 1, the epidermodysplasia
verruciformis associated HPV5, the mucosal high-risk
HPV16, and the bovine fibropapillomavirus BPV1 were investigated by pair-wise nucleotide and amino acid sequence
alignments of the different ORFs and their proteins (percentages similarity are summarized in Additional data file 2). For
all ORFs, LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1, and UuPV1 exhibited the
greatest similarity to each other and to the previously characterized FdPV1. The mutual similarity was comparable among
all feline PVs and was markedly greater than the similarity to
COPV, which was still greater than the similarity to the
human cutaneous and mucosal HPV1, HPV5, and HPV16, and
to the bovine BPV1.

deposited research

The classic upstream regulatory region (URR) or noncoding
region (NCR1) between the stop codon of L1 and the start
codon of E6 contains only 391 nucleotides in LrPV1 (nucleotides 7,885-42), PcPV1 (nucleotides 7,961-30), and PlpPV1
(nucleotides 7,827-114), and 392 nucleotides in UuPV1
(nucleotides 7,717-30). This is similar to FdPV1, in which the
URR counts 384 nucleotides [8]. To activate the PV origin of
replication, an E1/E2 complex must bind to the URR, which

usually contains an E1-recognition site flanked by two E2binding sites (E2BSs). A nucleotide alignment of the URR of
LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1, and UuPV1 with the URR of FdPV1,
COPV, and PlPV1 allowed us to locate an E1 binding site
(E1BS), and several conserved E2BSs with the consensus
sequence ACC-N6-GGT. We also found a number of modified
E2BSs that, because of their close similarity to homologous
conserved E2BSs in the other sequences and their location
relative to the E1BS, could be of functional importance. The
positions of the conserved and putative E2BSs, the E1BS, and
the TATA box of the E6 promotor are indicated in Figure 1.

reviews

The E1 ORF encodes the largest PV protein (606 amino acids
in PcPV1, PlpPV1, and UuPV1, and 608 amino acids in
LrPV1), and contains the conserved ATP-binding site of the
ATP-dependent helicase (GPPNTGKS) in the carboxyl-terminal part. Papillomaviral E1 proteins have DNA-dependent
ATPase and DNA helicase activities, and are essential for both
the initiation and elongation of viral DNA synthesis. The E2
gene product is a DNA binding protein that functions as an
important regulator of viral transcription and replication,
and a conserved leucine zipper domain (L-X6-L-X6-L-X6-L) is
present in the carboxyl-terminal part of E2. The E4 ORF is
completely contained within the E2 gene. As is the case in
most PVs, the E4 does not possess a start codon. In the
human PVs (HPVs) that have been studied, E4 is primarily
expressed from a viral transcript formed by splicing a few
codons from the beginning of E1 to E4. Although the function
of the E4 protein has not been completely clarified, current
data suggest that it may assist in viral release from the
infected cells through association with the cytoskeleton [10].
In the late region, the major (L1) and minor (L2) capsid protein genes are present. Both L1 and L2 contain a series of
highly basic amino acid residues (Arg and Lys) at their carboxyl-terminus, probably functioning as a nuclear localization signal.

comment

In the early region of the feline PV genomes, canonical E6 and
E7 ORFs are present, which encode the major papillomaviral
transforming proteins. The predicted E6 proteins of LrPV1,
PcPV1, PlpPV1, and UuPV1 contain two conserved zinc-binding domains, separated by 35 amino acids. The first domain
exhibits the classical C-X-X-C-X29-C-X-X-C motif, whereas
the second motif is modified, containing only 28 amino acids
(X28) between the two instances of C-X-X-C. An amino acid
alignment of the E6 of LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1, UuPV1, and 43
PV type species that contain an E6 revealed that only the
canine COPV, the feline FdPV1, and the raccoon (Procyon
lotor) PlPV1 (all members of the λ-PV genus) have an identical X28 modified motif. The only other nonclassical motifs
were identified in the cottontail rabbit CRPV (X33), the rabbit
oral ROPV (X34), and the equine (Equus caballus) EcPV1
(X30). The E7 contains one zinc-binding domain, also with the
modified X28 motif in LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1, COPV, PlPV1,
and FdPV1. The UuPV1 contains a different X26 modified
zinc-binding motif. The E7 of LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1, and
UuPV1 also contains the conserved retinoblastoma tumor
suppressor binding domain with the consensus sequence
DLRCYEQMP(D/G)EEE.

Discussion

interactions

The fact that host and virus evolutionary tree branch lengths
exhibit a strong linear correlation justifies applying host fossil
calibrations to estimate viral evolutionary rates. We used a
Bayesian statistical inference procedure that uses a relaxed
molecular clock model to estimate evolutionary rates [15,16].
We incorporated dates and confidence intervals for each node
in the host phylogeny, estimated using 16 independent fossil
calibration points and 18 kilobases (kb) of sequence data [12],
to constrain divergence dates within the viral phylogeny. This
Bayesian MCMC inference resulted in a relatively precise estimate of the evolutionary rate of the feline PVs: 1.95 × 10-8
(95% confidence interval 1.32 × 10-8 to 2.47 × 10-8) nucleotide
substitutions per site per year for the viral coding genome.
Evolutionary rates for the individual PV coding genes and for
the URR are indicated in Figure 3.

refereed research

Similarities between virus and host phylogenies could, however, also arise through preferential host switching, in which
viruses are transmitted more successfully between closely
related hosts in geographic proximity, as is - for instance - the
case for simian immunodeficiency virus [13]. The felid host
species used in our study, however, are distributed over five
distinct zoogeographic regions: Palearctic, Ethiopian (African), Nearctic, and Neotropical (including Southern Florida)
[14]. This is demonstrated by the color code of the scientific
names and branches in our host species phylogenetic tree
(Figure 2a), which depicts recent and historic zoogeographic
regions as shown on the map, inferred from their current distribution, fossil records, and phylogenetic analyses conducted
by Johnson and coworkers [12]. In the feline PV evolutionary
tree, the color of the virus name indicates the geographic
region (shown on the map) where the virus was sampled. For
all viruses, the geographic region where the virus was isolated
coincides with the current distribution region of the corresponding feline species in the host tree, which is depicted by
colored bars connecting virus and host. The only exception is
PlpPV1, which was retrieved from a sample of an Asian lion

(Panthera leo persica subspecies of Panthera leo) from the
Gir Forest Sanctuary in India in the Oriental region, whereas
the corresponding host sequence was obtained from a Panthera leo of the Ethiopian region (subspecies not defined
[12]). Nevertheless, our findings indicate that the speciesspecific virus-host associations have remained stable
throughout the intercontinental migration history of the felid
lineage, making it unlikely that observed similarities between
the felid and feline PV phylogenies are the result of preferential host switching. When the branch lengths of the Felidae
and PV trees were compared, we found a strong linear relationship (P = 0.012; Figure 2b). This indicates that the accumulation of genetic diversity has occurred over similar
amounts of time in both virus and host, and provides the necessary additional temporal support for virus-host co-evolution.

[12], revealed identical tree topologies when ML and Bayesian
methods were used for phylogenetic reconstruction. The
closely related banded linsang (Prionodon linsang) and fossa
(Cryptoprocta ferox), both of which are members of the Feliformia suborder of carnivores, but not members of the Felidae family, were used as outgroups for the Felidae
phylogenetic tree. The feline PV phylogenetic tree (Figure 2a,
right side), based on amino acid translation of the concatenated PV genes, also exhibited identical topologies when
reconstructed with ML and Bayesian methods. Outgroups
used in this analysis were the closely related PlPV1 of the raccoon and COPV of the dog, both belonging to the genus λ-PV
and isolated from hosts belonging to the Caniformia suborder
of carnivores. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the
evolutionary history of feline PVs is identical to that established for the Felidae, suggesting that these PVs are indeed
co-evolving with their hosts.

species 3). Apart from their high nucleotide similarity, additional support for a common ancestral origin of the PV types
of this genus is provided by the presence of an unusual second
noncoding region (NCR2). A multiple nucleotide sequence
alignment of the NCR2 of the feline PVs demonstrated that
these exhibit a high degree of similarity, with stretches of
highly conserved nucleotides interrupted by variable regions
(alignment is provided in Additional data file 3). The remarkable conservation of some stretches of nucleotides within the
NCR2 of the feline PVs suggests that these might be of structural or functional importance. However, we were unable to

detect any regulatory or structurally functional domains in
these conserved regions. When we aligned the NCR2 regions
of all λ-PVs using the T-coffee software [17], a moderate
degree of similarity was still visible above the background of
numerous insertions and deletions.
We therefore speculate that the NCR2 regions of all members
of the λ-PV genus share a common evolutionary origin, having arisen in their common ancestor either through an early
integration event with a DNA sequence of unknown function
and origin or through duplication of a part of the PV genome,

refereed research

Because of their rapid evolutionary rate relative to the available range of sequence sampling times, genetic diversity in
rapidly evolving RNA viruses can be used as a genetic tag of
their hosts, as was recently demonstrated for the feline immunodeficiency virus and its Puma concolor host [2]. With an
evolutionary rate in the range of 10-3 to 10-5 nucleotide substitutions per site per year, these fast evolving pathogens are
well suited for observing spatial and temporal evolutionary
patterns on a 'real time' scale, and they can reflect short-term
patterns of host movements (covering a few hundred years)
[18,19]. In contrast, investigation of host evolution and demographic processes over time frames of hundreds of thousands
to millions of years could be addressed by genetic variation in
more slowly evolving viruses, which mainly (but not exclusively) include viruses with a stable DNA genome. Viruses for
which the route of transmission is well established and
requires very close direct contact, such as skin-skin and
muco-mucosal transmission, provide excellent candidates for
this approach. In order to infer information on host evolution

The observed co-evolutionary pattern of feline PVs and their
hosts provides evidence that slowly evolving viruses such as
PVs can be used to investigate evolutionary processes in
divergent host lineages. In combination with other data, they
could help to unravel long-term evolutionary processes such
as speciation and population subdivision. However, these
findings can not be expanded to other slowly evolving viruses
without prior confirmation of host co-divergence of the virus
in question. This necessity is illustrated by phylogenetic studies of the human polyomavirus JC (JCV). This virus has
widely been used as a genetic marker for human evolution
and migration, based on presumed co-evolution with its
human host. The hypothesis of virus-host co-divergence was
based on the simple observation that subtypes of JCV are
associated with different human populations, and that the
virus is transmitted from parent to child in a quasi-vertical
manner. However, a recent reconciliation analysis of human
and JCV phylogenetic trees was unable to provide evidence
for co-divergence between virus and host, indicating that this
virus is unsuited as a marker to unravel the history of human
populations [19].

Co-evolutionary relationships of feline
papillomaviruses and their host species

The high similarities between the feline PV genomes
described in this paper (Additional data file 1) strongly indicate that these feline PVs belong to the same ancestral PV lineage. The topology of the feline PV phylogenetic tree is
identical to that of the host species tree, despite the complex
and dynamic phylogeographic history of the Felidae. In addition, the strong linear relationship between the branch
lengths for the Felidae and feline PV trees indicates that virus
and host have accumulated genetic diversity over similar
amounts of time, thereby fulfilling the temporal requirement
for putative co-divergence. Although alternative hypotheses
such as host switching and rapid adaptation to a new host
possibly could also generate species-specific lineages and
result in the percentage nucleotide identity among feline PVs
that we found here, we argue that this was not the case for
these feline PVs. First, the viral sequences were sampled from
host species that are geographically isolated from each other,
making interspecies jumping of these pathogens highly
unlikely. Second, host switching followed by rapid adaptation
would not result in an identical internal branching pattern for
the viral and host evolutionary trees, such as we observed for
the feline PVs and their hosts. Furthermore, the low overall
nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios (ω =
dN/dS) observed in PVs, with comparison of complete
genomes of HPV16 variants showing a ω below 1 for all ORFs
(ranging from 0.1330 to 0.7966, depending on the ORF),
indicates that PVs are under strong purifying selection pressure [20]. It would therefore be very speculative to hypothesize that PVs are capable of rapid adaptation to a new host.

with subsequent loss of its superfluous function. (However,
the latter possibility is not corroborated by detectable similarity of the NCR2 to any other region of the PV genome.) The
NCR2 regions subsequently diverged in the descendent papillomaviral lineages through relatively rapid (compared with
the coding genome) accumulation of insertions, deletions,
and point mutations. The relatively high degree of conservation of the NCR2 sequence within the feline PVs, in contrast
to the low similarity of the feline PV NCR2s to those of COPV
and PlPV1, is a strong indication that the points of divergence
between the various feline PVs occurred much more recently
than that between the feline PVs and the PVs of the Caniformia. This is in agreement with a mode of evolution in
which virus and host are co-diverging.

from virus data with confidence, however, it is a prerequisite
that the virus conforms to a vicariance model of evolution,
with co-divergence of virus and host; which requires confirmation by rigorous testing.

Feline papillomavirus evolutionary rate
The observed co-evolutionary pattern between feline PVs and
their hosts justifies applying host species divergence times to
estimate viral evolutionary rates. Our results show that substitutions accumulate most rapidly in the noncoding
upstream regulatory region (with 2.69 × 10-8 nucleotide substitutions per site per year; Figure 3). For the viral coding
genes, we found the highest evolutionary rate in the E6 ORF
and the lowest in E7. We wish to emphasize that, taking into
account the confidence intervals, the evolutionary rates for
the separate coding genes largely overlap. In a previously
report by Bravo and Alonso [21] on divergence rates in
mucosal HPVs, the protein divergence rate was reported to
increase in the order L1 < L2 < E6 ≈ E7. However, because of
a lack of calibration points, no time scale was attributed to the
HPV phylogeny in that study, and so calculations were limited
to relative measurements based on divergence distances.
The overall evolutionary rate of 1.95 × 10-8 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the coding genome of the feline
PVs that we estimated here is in broad agreement with previous point estimates for rates of PV evolution based on simple
genetic distances, few calibration points, and a limited
number of genes [8]. Furthermore, our estimate is within the
same range as the HPV evolutionary rate, which was approximated by Ong and colleagues [22] based on comparison of
HPV18 variants from isolated human populations. They
established that the fixation of a single point mutation in a
185 bp fragment of the noncoding region (URR) takes at least
12,000 years, resulting in a rough estimate of evolutionary
rate of maximally 4.5 × 10-7 nucleotide substitutions per site
per year for the most variable region of the HPV18 genome. It
is important to note that this estimate is based on the
assumption of co-evolution of HPV18 with human populations, which was not validated by rigorous testing in that
study. This rate approximation is only about five times faster
than our precise estimates of the URR evolutionary rate (2.69
× 10-8 nucleotide substitutions per site per year, with a 95%
confidence interval of 1.75 × 10-8 to 3.69 × 10-8).
Our calculations indicate that mutations are fixed in the PV
genome at a very low rate. This is primarily the result of a low
rate of occurrence of mutations, because PVs use the host cell
DNA replication machinery, characterized by high fidelity,
proofreading capacity, and post-replication repair mechanisms. Furthermore, a negative selective pressure acting on
the PV genome, indicated by a nonsynonymous/synonymous
substitution rate ratio below 1 for all ORFs [20], will prevent
the fixation of deleterious mutations in the PV population,
thereby contributing to the low rate of evolution. Although
the papillomaviral DNA is replicated by the host cell machinery, our rate estimates indicate that PV genes evolve approximately one order of magnitude faster than mammalian host
cellular genes, which have a mutation rate of less then 1 × 109 nucleotide substitutions per site per year [23]. A greater
number of replication cycles per unit time, and thus faster

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/4/R57

generation times, provides a possible explanation for these
higher viral rates.
Well supported evolutionary rates of the feline PVs could possibly be applied to other PV lineages and associated evolutionary questions. For example, diversity within the sexually
transmitted HPV types 16 and 18, which worldwide are the
major causes of cervical cancer, has been suggested to mirror
past human migrations [22,24,25]. However, until now, rate
estimates for PV evolution had not been sufficiently precise to
estimate a reliable time scale for this migration history [1]. By
applying the evolutionary rate that we have now calculated,
the time to most recent common ancestor of the extant variants of HPV16 and HPV18, and the demographic history of
the viral population over time could be estimated and compared with the host data. Given the very low degree of diversity among these HPV variants, the current dataset,
encompassing only a very limited number of complete
genomic sequences of HPV16 and HPV18 variants, will probably be insufficient to obtain precise estimates. As more
sequence data become available in the future, however, these
studies could result in an accurate time scale for HPV evolution, and possibly provide pivotal information about global
patterns of population dispersal and interaction in human
evolutionary history, where traditional genetic studies have
fallen short.

Papillomavirus infection in endangered species
Nearly all Felidae, except for the domestic cat, are presently
listed as endangered species by the World Wildlife Fund and
are monitored for conservation concerns. An increased prevalence of PV infection and more severe PV-related disease has
been reported in populations that experienced a genetic bottleneck in the past. For instance, oral focal epithelial hyperplasia (FEH), caused by HPV13 and HPV32, is highly
prevalent in American Indians in the USA and Brazil, and in
Inuits in Greenland and Alaska, but it is only rarely encountered in non-inbred populations [26]. In the endangered primate species Pan paniscus (pygmy chimpanzee or bonobo),
the pygmy chimpanzee PV causes very similar oral lesions,
also referred to as FEH [27]. Interestingly, oral lesions with
the clinical and histopathologic features of FEH have also
been described in the bobcat, Florida panther, Asian lion, and
snow leopard, in which they could be caused by LrPV1, PcPV1,
PlpPV1, and UuPV1, respectively [6]. A major concern is that
PV infections in endangered exotic felids could pose important health problems and even jeopardize the survival of these
species. Transformation of papillomatous lesions to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, with an effective mortality rate
of 100%, has been reported in captive snow leopards, and
could compromise the zoo population of these animals [28].
The construction of PV type-specific prophylactic (or even
therapeutic) vaccines could therefore be considered, as has
been done previously for cattle, dogs, rabbits, and horses [2931]. The sequence information of the LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1,

reviews

Recently, molecular data from the rapidly evolving feline
immunodeficiency virus contributed to resolving the population history of its Puma concolor host [2]. Although this
clearly shows that fast evolving viruses are ideal for reconstructing the demographic history of a single host species, we
have now tested the hypothesis that more slowly evolving
viruses may be useful for addressing relationships on a
broader evolutionary scale. To this effect, we have sequenced
the complete genomes of several globally distributed feline
PVs. A confident reconstruction of the feline host phylogeny
recently became available [12], enabling rigorous comparison
of viral and host phylogenies. We demonstrate that the evolutionary relationships among feline PVs perfectly mirror those
of their hosts, despite a complex and dynamic phylogeographic history. By applying host species divergence times
and using Bayesian statistical methods and a relaxed
molecular clock, we have calculated the first precise estimates
for the rate of evolution for each of the PV genes. Our results
provide evidence for long-term virus-host co-speciation of
these feline PVs, indicating that viral diversity in slowly evolving viruses can be used to investigate host species evolution.
Our evolutionary rate estimates provide the cornerstones for
further studies on the ancient pandemic spread of these
viruses in a plethora of different species.

ethidium bromide staining. The UuPV-F1R1 and UuPV-F2R2
fragments were gel purified and cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO
vector, followed by transformation into One Shot TOP 10
chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). The bacteria were
selectively grown on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. For each PCR fragment, 10 colonies were checked by
EcoRI digest of miniprep DNA, and one clone containing
UuPV-F1R1 and one containing UuPV-F2R2 were selected.

DNA sequencing
The complete nucleotide sequences of the cloned bobcat
LrPV1, the Florida panther PcPV1, and the Asian lion PlpPV1
were determined by using the EZ::TN < KAN-2 > Insertion
Kit, whereas for the snow leopard UuPV1 the EZ::TN < TET1 > Insertion Kit was used (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA).
These methods allow rapid sequencing of long stretches of
cloned DNA by random insertion of a transposon containing
specific forward and reverse sequencing primer binding sites.
Transposon insertion reactions were performed on miniprep
DNA of the LrPV1, PcPV1, PlpPV1, UuPV-F1R1, and UuPVF2R2 selected clones, after which the reaction products were
used to transform One Shot MAX Efficiency DH5α-T1R competent cells (Invitrogen). Sequencing with forward and
reverse primers (the KAN-2 FP-1 and KAN-2 RP-1, and the
TET-1 FP-1 and TET-1 RP1, respectively; Epicentre) was performed on 24 clones obtained from each of the transposon
insertion reactions, and the remaining sequence gaps were
covered by primer-walking on the original clones. Sequencing
was performed on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at the
Rega Institute core sequencing facility. Chromatogram
sequencing files were inspected with Chromas 2.2 (Technelysium, Helensvale, Australia), and contigs were prepared
using SeqMan II (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA).

Sequence analysis
ORF analysis was performed using the ORF Finder tool on the
NCBI server. Similarity searches were performed using the
NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN 2.2.10)
server on GenBank DNA database release 145.0 [34]. The predicted molecular weight of the putative proteins was calculated using the ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System)
Compute pI/Mw tool [35]. Pair-wise sequence alignments
were calculated using the GAP-program [36] (percentage
similarity is provided in Additional data file 2). For aligning
sequences, different programs were applied to the data in
order to check the robustness of the alignment with respect to
the different algorithms that were applied. The program giving the best alignment was then selected, and this alignment
was taken as the starting point for manual correction. The
URR alignment of the λ-PVs (Figure 1), and the NCR2 alignment of the feline PVs (Additional data file 3) were obtained
using ClustalX version 1.83 [37] and T-Coffee [17], and corrected manually in the GeneDoc Multiple Sequence Alignment Editor and Shading Utility software package version

sites that could not be unambiguously aligned according to
the original authors. The alignment for the cat, puma, bobcat,
lion, snow leopard, linsang, and fossa sequences was 22,635
bp long in total and contains autosomal, X-linked, Y-linked,
and mitochondrial genes (18,702 bp of nuclear DNA and
3,933 bp mitochondrial DNA). A detailed list of these genes,
their felid chromosomal location, and the number of base
pairs for each gene segment (excluding ambiguous sites) is
provided in Table S1 of the supporting online information
provided by Johnson and coworkers [40]. The mean pairwise divergence for these sequences is estimated to be
0.0896802 (95% confidence interval 0.0861073 to
0.0933866) nucleotide substitutions per site.
Phylogenetic analyses of both virus and host alignments were
performed using model-based statistical inference techniques, including maximum likelihood methods implemented in Tree-puzzle 5.1 [41] and Bayesian methods as
implemented in MrBayes 3.1 [42]. Analyses were performed
on the translated amino acid sequence data for PVs using the
JTT (Jones, Taylor and Thornton) substitution model [43]
and gamma-distributed rate variation in Tree-puzzle [44],
and using gamma-distributed rate variation but estimating
the fixed-rate model of substitution in MrBayes [42]. According to the Akaiki information criterion and the Bayesian estimation procedure, the JTT model was the best fitting amino
acid substitution model. The Felidae total DNA (totDNA)
alignment, including both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA,
was analyzed using the Tamura-Nei model of substitution
and gamma-distributed rate variation in Tree-puzzle [44] and
the general-time-reversible model with gamma-distributed
rate variation in MrBayes [42]. Bayesian MCMC analyses in
MrBayes [42] were run incorporating flat priors, random
starting trees, and no phylogenetic constraints. Four simultaneous Markov chains were run for 5,000,000 generations,
with 500,000 generations of burn-in followed by sampling
every 5,000 generations. Each Bayesian run was independently replicated to ensure convergence. Branch lengths for

The novel PVs described in this study were named and abbreviated according to the nomenclature guidelines for nonhuman PVs (abbreviation 'PV', preceded by a capital and a lower
case letter that abbreviate the host's scientific name) [9]:
LrPV1, PcPV1, and UuPV1. An exception was made for the
Panthera leo persica PV type 1, which was abbreviated
PlpPV1 instead of PlPV1, since the latter name is already in
use for the Procyon lotor PV type 1, isolated from a raccoon
[11].

We have run MCMC chains in BEAST for 5,000,000 generations, with burn-in and sampling as described above [15]. The
URR evolutionary rate was estimated separately on an alignment of the URR sequences of the feline PVs without outgroup sequences, constructed in Muscle (the URR alignment
is available in Additional data file 5).

reviews

Evolutionary rates were estimated using an uncorrelated
relaxed clock in BEAST 1.3 [15]. Bayesian MCMC analyses in
BEAST were performed using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano
model of evolution with gene-specific gamma-distributed
rate heterogeneity among sites and gene-specific evolutionary rates; rates on each branch were drawn identically and
independently from an underlying log-normal distribution.
Monophyletic constraints were imposed for the nodes that
were used to calibrate the evolutionary rates. Normal priors
were used for the times to the most recent common ancestor
(TMRCA) of PcPV1, LrPV1, FdPV1, PlpPV1, and UuPV1 (mean
10.78 million years ago (Mya); standard deviation 1.87), for
the TMRCA of PcPV1, LrPV1 and FdPV1 (mean: 7.15 Mya,
stdev:1.36) and for the TMRCA of PlpPV1 and UuPV1 (mean:
3.72 Mya, stdev:1.05), all based on the posterior distributions
obtained for the host [12]. The divergence dates reported by
Johnson and coworkers were estimated using a Bayesian
relaxed clock approach that models the molecular rate among
lineages as varying in an autocorrelated manner. The phylogeny used to estimate divergence times by those authors was a
maximum likelihood tree inferred from the amino acid
sequences for the nuclear genes (Figure S1 in their supporting
online information [40]). The 16 calibration dates that were
used to infer the time scale for the host phylogeny are
described in detail under the paragraph 'Divergence time estimations' in that supporting online information.
