Abstract
Background: Insect ears contain very different numbers of sensory cells, from only one sensory
cell in some moths to thousands of sensory cells, e.g. in cicadas. These differences still await
functional explanation and especially the large numbers in cicadas remain puzzling. Insects of the
different orders have distinct developmental sequences for the generation of auditory organs.
These sensory cells might have different functions depending on the developmental stages. Here
we propose that constraints arising during development are also important for the design of insect
ears and might influence cell numbers of the adults.
Presentation of the hypothesis: We propose that the functional requirements of the subadult
stages determine the adult complement of sensory units in the auditory system of cicadas. The
hypothetical larval sensory organ should function as a vibration receiver, representing a functional
caenogenesis.
Testing the hypothesis: Experiments at different levels have to be designed to test the
hypothesis. Firstly, the neuroanatomy of the larval sense organ should be analyzed to detail.
Secondly, the function should be unraveled neurophysiologically and behaviorally. Thirdly, the
persistence of the sensory cells and the rebuilding of the sensory organ to the adult should be
investigated.
Implications of the hypothesis: Usually, the evolution of insect ears is viewed with respect to
physiological and neuronal mechanisms of sound perception. This view should be extended to the
development of sense organs. Functional requirements during postembryonic development may act
as constraints for the evolution of adult organs, as exemplified with the auditory system of cicadas.

Background
Insect audition represents a fascinating example of multiple evolution in several lineages. Tympanal hearing in
insects evolved more than 10 times independently from
each other [1-3]. These tympanal organs are located at different sites on the insect body and have distinct designs,
but with common features, like a scolopidial sense organ.
These sense organs belong to a family of internal mech-

anoreceptors found in arthropods. Phylogenetic comparison revealed that scolopidial sense organs are in the same
place in hearing and non-hearing species, while hearing
species having external structures elaborated for perception of airborne sound [4,5]. Thus, the scolopidial organs
of non-hearing species represent the ancestral situation. A
second line of evidence is that auditory sense organs are

specializations of serially organized scolopidial organs [68].
The multiple evolution caused different morphologies of
the insect ear. Interestingly, the number of sensory cells
used in audition varies to an astounding degree between
taxa: from only one sensory cell in some moths to more
than 1000, e.g. in cicadas [9]. These differences still await
functional explanation. A hypothetical cause could be frequency discrimination. In bush crickets, the sensory cells
are linearly arranged with a corresponding order in frequency tuning, resembling in this respect the alignment of
hair cells in the vertebrate inner ear [10,11]. However,
within the central nervous system much of the information converges onto a few known interneurons (although
more might still await discovery), discarding much of the
frequency fractionation [12,13]. This reduction might be
explained by the main functions of insect hearing which
are intraspecific communication (mate finding) and predator avoidance (especially echo-locating bats). For these
purposes insects can categorize stimuli for either positive
or negative phonotaxis [14]. For the cicadas it has been
proposed that they possess exceptional fine-frequency resolution for frequency modulated communication signals
[15]. The results are based on interneuronal recordings,
not directly correlated to the sensory cells. Other causes
for a large complements of sensory structures might
involve ecological constraints (e.g. frequency dependent
attenuation), improvement of the signal to noise ratio by
sampling over many independent channels [16] or sharpening of interneuron tuning with lateral inhibition. However, the causal factors of the biodiversity of ear design are
unresolved [3].
The structures and functions of nervous systems in general
and sensory system in particular are subject to more than
one evolutionary factor which shapes them [17]. Specific
sensory structures can result from (1) a (species-) specific
adaptation, (2) from evolutionary history by reflecting an
ancestral condition, (3) from developmental constraints
or (4) from biophysical limitations of the material. Furthermore, metabolic costs are high in neuronal structures
and might act as constraint that limits evolutionary
change [18]. Any of these reasons can come into consideration for organismic structure and function. For the insect
ear, biophysical and biochemical limitations seems to be
comparable for all ears, since they are constructed from
the same elements (e.g. scolopidia, cuticular tympanal
membrane). Certainly species-specific adaptation and
evolutionary history influences the ear design. For example moths detect echo-locating bats with only one or two
sensory cells. All adaptations considered for insect ears
focus on functions in the adults. Generally, developmental constraints have not yet been considered to influence
the design of insect ears, because sensitive hearing is

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/20

restricted to the adults. Here we propose that functional
constraints during development may act as constraints for
the design of insect ears.
Insects of the different orders have also diverse ontogenetic histories. Consequently the development of the
auditory organs varies largely (depictured for six orders in
Figure 1). In respect to the sensitive tympanal hearing in
adults, it is not surprising that in the holometabolous
Diptera, the sensory cells of the ear develop during metamorphosis (Figure 1; unpublished results). The adult sensory cells have no larval precursors. The situation might be
the same in Coleoptera, but it has not been studied yet. By
contrast, in at least some taxa of Lepidoptera the adult
organ has a predecessor organ in larval stages. This means
that the scoloparia are maintained and remodelled during
metamorphosis [19,20]. They develop during embryogenesis [21] and the proprioceptive larval organ measures
segmental positions [20]. Thus, the tympanal organ is
present only in the adult stage and the larval sensory
organ serves a different function. The mechanoreceptive
scolopidia can be used for different sensory modalities.
The development of the tympanal organs of the hemimetabolous Orthoptera is comparatively well investigated.
All sensory cells differentiate during embryogenesis and
the tympanal organs maturate gradually during postembryogenesis, [6,22-24] (Figure 1). Functionally, the sensitivity to airborne sound increases during postembryonic
development [25]. This is correlated to the formation of
the tympanal trachea and the thinning of the cuticle
resulting in the adult tympanum [22,25]. A similar development occurs in the Mantodea [26]. In both groups of
hemimetabolous insects the larvae are rather similar to
the adult. However, this is different in a third group of
hemimetabolous insects to be considered here, the cicadas. Larval cicadas have separated life style from the
adults, resembling holometabolous insects in this respect.
The different environment shaped the morphology of the
animals and their sensory systems.

Presentation the hypothesis
Here, we propose that the adult auditory system of cicadas
is largely shaped by adaptations used in early developmental stages. The functional requirements of the subadult stages determine the adult complement of sensory
units.
The auditory system of adult cicadas is located in the second abdominal segment and sensitive hearing is used in
intraspecific communication and predator detection [27].
As mentioned above, it remains puzzling why adult cicadas have up to thousands of sensory cells. The fine-frequency resolution in the central auditory system [15]
might not require such a large set of sensory neurons.

Figure of
Outline 1 the developmental schemes for audition in six orders of insects
Outline of the developmental schemes for audition in six orders of insects. In the two taxa Coleoptera and Diptera of holometabolous insects the scolopidial sense organ for hearing develops during the pupal stage (generation of cells: yellow; differentiation: dotted line). Shortly after emergence the adult hearing capability is aquired (red). In at least some Lepidoptera the
scolopidia develop during embryogenesis and are remodeled during the pupal stage (broken line) for the innervation of the
adult tympanal organ. The larval function is probably proprioception (blue). In the Hemimetabola the scolopidia are formed
during embryogenesis. In the Saltatoria and the Mantodea, the hearing capabilities develop gradually with the postembryonic
larval stages (blue-red line). In the Auchenorrhyncha the cells probably develop during embryogensis and two separate functions are proposed for the larva and the adult (see text).

We propose adaptive purposes for the auditory system in
preadult stages of the life cycle. Such a developmental
influence on the adult system might be called functional
caenogenesis. Per definition, a caenogenetic character is a
transitory adaptive character during development [28].
The scolopidial sensory units of cicadas are probably not
transitory, but their function might change and therefore
the process can be called transitory.
This transitory function might explain the number of sensory cells in the sense organ. The cicada larvae have a life
style of their own and occur within the soil where they
suck on the tree roots. After the last moult, the morphologically different adult animals emerge from the ground.
The adults live above ground on green plants performing
acoustic communication for reproduction.
We propose that the scolopidial sense organ is already
present during larval stages and suggest that it functions as

vibration receiver. Vibration receptors and proprioceptors
often have a large number of sensory units, like the femoral chordotonal organ with up to several hundred sensory
cells [29]. It has been speculated that for the purpose of
vibration detection cell numbers increase during evolution [30,31]. Ancestral vibration function was discussed
for the numerous cells in the auditory organ in the
orthopteran Bullacris (phylogenetic constraint) [31].
Vibration receptors and proprioceptors respond to different parameters of the mechanosensory stimuli, like acceleration, velocity, frequency and position [32] thereby
requiring a large set of sensory units. Since apoptosis in
scolopidial organs is unknown, the number of sensory
neurons can not be downregulated from the cicada larva
to the adult. The large number of neurons therefore persists after metamorphosis when the tympanal structures
are differentiated, although they might not be necessary
for auditory function.

Testing the hypothesis
Experiments at different levels have to be designed to test
the hypothesis, because the development of the cicada ear
has yet not been investigated. Firstly, the neuroanatomy
of the larval sense organ should be analyzed to detail.
How many sensory cells occur in the sense organ and how
is it attached to the epidermis? Another character to be
analyzed is the central projection of the larval sense organ.
It should be shown whether the neuronal arborizations
can be found in the same areas of the central nervous systems, as the auditory receptor fibers in the adult. In other
insect taxa, it was shown that the information from the
serially homolog mechanoceptive organs converge in the
same neuropile in the CNS and synapse onto serially
homologous interneurons [7,33].
Secondly, based on the hypothetical presence of an elaborate scolopidial organ, the function of the larval sense
organ should be approached neurophysiologically and
behaviorally. Different vibratory and proprioceptive stimuli can be applied to the sense organ and physiological
parameters, like frequency tuning, can be evaluated electrophysiologically. Behavioral experiments might elucidate the biological function. High vibration sensitivity
might be important in the underground life style to avoid
predation and competition. The larvae suck on tree roots
and it is feasible that they compete intraspecifically for
suitable sites. Aggressive or accidental interactions of the
larvae might lead to fatal injuries. Thus, evasive behavior
to vibratory stimuli or generation of vibratory signals
should be tested.
Thirdly, the generation of the sensory cells and the
rebuilding of the external structures to the adult auditory
system should be investigated. This includes the questions
whether new sensory cells are generated during larval
stages (testable with cell cycle markers) and whether
apoptosis occurs in the sense organ. Neither has been
reported so far for insect auditory systems. These data
might indicate a persistence of sensory neurons from the
embryo to the adult.

Implications of the hypothesis
The hypothesis presented here postulates the functional
need of a vibration receptor with a high number of sensory units in larval stages of cicadas, which are retained
into the adult and become transformed into an auditory
system sensitive to airborne sound. Apart from the proposed hypothesis for one taxon, it has implications for the
understanding of insect auditory system formation.
Usually, insect ears are studied with respect to the underlying physiological and neuronal mechanisms for sound
perception. The linear gain of function during postembryogenesis may not be appropriate for the cicada. Thus, we

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/20

direct the perspective away from the adult system and
look at ontogenetic factors which can influence the design
of an insect ear. This is a refocus of research questions,
although the life cycles of many insects are not as complex
as the cicada's and caenogenesis in auditory structures
might not be the rule. Nevertheless, this conceptual
approach re-evaluates the different life cycle stages and
their importance for the adult system, replacing the
adulto-centric view of animal structure with a more integral one [34].
Generally, vibrational communication is common in
Hemiptera, in both larvae and adults [35,36]. Vibrational
communication might represent the ancestral situation.
We widen this view by the addition that larval vibration
perception might shape the sensory structures of the
adults. The vibratory system of treehoppers and cicadas is
largely unknown [37] and the hypothesis might trigger
future studies in these groups. The treehoppers and true
bugs will also serve as outgroups for the studies on the
functional caenogenesis proposed for cicadas. Comparative studies are also important for the understanding of
the low number of sensory neurons in the subgenual
organ of various insect species [38]. Certainly, vibratory
behaviors can be accomplished with a few sensory cells
(and perhaps an even larger complement of interneurons)
[39]. The adaptive value of a low number of cells, e.g. in
terms of energy costs [18] or the evolutionary constraints
have to be clarified in the future.
Additionally, questions to the development of sensory
systems remain open. Why can the cell numbers in many
systems, like visual system or the tactile hairs, be regulated
with growth of the larvae, whereas the internal sense
organs can not? How can it be adaptive that large cell
numbers are generated in the embryo, when the function
of the sensory organ is needed only much later (years in
the case of cicadas)? Neuronal cells have high metabolic
costs [40,41] and therefore the maintenance of unnecessary sensory cells should be selected against. Thus, it
might be feasible that sensory cells develop when they are
needed – in the case of cicadas, this means they are needed
already in the larvae. On the other hand, the embryonic
development could be necessary when restrictions in the
genetic mechanisms require that sensory mother cells
occur only in the embryo, but not during postembryonic
stages.
In general, this perspective forces one to carefully discriminate between primary and secondary adaptations in a
studied system. It draws attention to the peculiar features
of animals life styles and requires the comparative evaluation of evolutionary forces and ecological adaptations
[42]. Functional requirements during development may

act as constraints for the evolution of adult organs, as
exemplified with the auditory system of cicadas.
