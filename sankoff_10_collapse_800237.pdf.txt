The collapse of gene complement following whole
genome duplication
Research article

David Sankoff*1, Chunfang Zheng2 and Qian Zhu3

Abstract
Background: Genome amplification through duplication or proliferation of transposable elements has its counterpart
in genome reduction, by elimination of DNA or by gene inactivation. Whether loss is primarily due to excision of
random length DNA fragments or the inactivation of one gene at a time is controversial. Reduction after whole
genome duplication (WGD) represents an inexorable collapse in gene complement.
Results: We compare fifteen genomes descending from six eukaryotic WGD events 20-450 Mya. We characterize the
collapse over time through the distribution of runs of reduced paralog pairs in duplicated segments. Descendant
genomes of the same WGD event behave as replicates. Choice of paralog pairs to be reduced is random except for
some resistant regions of contiguous pairs. For those paralog pairs that are reduced, conserved copies tend to
concentrate on one chromosome.
Conclusions: Both the contiguous regions of reduction-resistant pairs and the concentration of runs of single copy
genes on a single chromosome are evidence of transcriptional co-regulation, dosage sensitivity or other functional
interaction constraining the reduction process. These constraints and their evolution over time show a consistent
pattern across evolutionary domains and a highly reproducible pattern, as replicates, for the several descendants of a
single WGD.
Background
Following an episode of whole genome doubling (WGD),
gene duplicates are lost at an initially high rate through
processes such as epigenetic silencing, pseudogenization,
and deletion of chromosomal segments containing one or
more genes, while intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangement mechanisms redistribute chromosomal segments both large and small across the genome. The
genome of a present-day descendant can be largely
decomposed into a set of duplicated DNA segments dispersed among the chromosomes, with all the duplicate
pairs of genes exhibiting a similar degree of sequence
divergence, and with segments containing only singlecopy genes interspersed among them. The present paper
proposes a resolution of the controversy as to what extent
paralog reduction is a gene-by-gene process [1], targeting
redundant copies at random points throughout the
genome, whose loss restores, or at least does not perturb,

functional balance; and to what extent it is a consequence
of largely random elimination of excess DNA [2]. These
two processes may often coincide, since 1.) the actual
excision of critical exons of a single gene is one of the
ways a gene can be lost, along with various other suppression and silencing mechanisms leading to pseudogenization, and 2.) even if two or more adjacent genes are lost at
the same time, this may be the result of of their regulatory
interaction, dosage compensation [3], epigenetically
marked homeolog preference [4] or functional buffering
[5], rather than the deletion of a DNA fragment.
The key evidence in studying the pattern of gene losses
across the genome has been the distribution of the length
of runs of single-copy genes [6,7]. The chief methodological difficulty has been the increasing rate of disruption of
these runs over time by chromosomal rearrangement.
The evidence in this paper comes from six distinct
WGD events across the eukaryotic spectrum, including
three in which we examine multiple independent descendants. The time scale ranges from 20 My to 450 My. We
argue that the pattern of gene loss across the genome
must be studied at two levels. At the higher level, where

we test whether gene loss events are scattered randomly
throughout the genome, we ask how duplicate pairs of
paralogs on homeologous chromosomes are chosen to be
reduced to single-copy. Because loss of both copies is
likely to result in diminished viability in at least some natural contexts, it makes more sense to narrow the null
hypothesis so that an independent loss process affects
entire paralog pairs, rather than all genes including single-copy ones. At the lower level, where we test whether
more than one gene tends to be lost at a time, we ask
whether the "survivors" of paralog pair reduction, rather
than being divided (fractionated or interleaved) randomly
between the two homeologous chromosomes, are located
disproportionately on one of them, as has been demonstrated for the particular case of Arabidopsis [4]. We seek
answers to both questions by identifying all pairs of single-copy regions where strict criteria allow us to be fairly
sure that the two regions were originally paralogous and
that neither has been been disrupted by rearrangements
swapping out some genes or introducing external genes.
These are our analytical units (AU), similar to the consolidated regions in [8]. We develop ways of visualizing the
level of statistical significance of fractionation in all AU
containing a given number s of single-copy genes, both
for all s simultaneously, and separately for each s as a way
of fitting a geometric distribution of deletion lengths.
The present-day genomes we analyze (and WGD events
in their ancestry) are: Paramecium tetraurelia (most
recent of four or more WGD events in its ancestry [9]);
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus, Candida glabrata, Naumovia castelli and Vanderwaltozyma
polyspora (yeast doubling event discovered by Wolfe and
colleagues [10]); Populus trichocarpa (WGD event in the
Salicaceae) [11]; Arabidopsis thaliana (most recent WGD
[12]); Tetraodon nigroviridis, Takifugu rubripes, Oryzias
latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus (teleost WGD [13,14])
and chicken, opossum and human (most recent vertebrate WGD [15]). The phylogenetic diversity of this sample is illustrated in Figure 1A. Although there are likely
multiple WGD in each of these lineages, except yeast, we
focus on the most recent WGD in each case, using
curated paralogies where available (yeast, Arabidopsis,
Paramecium) and protein alignment scores elsewhere to
identify pertinent paralogies.
From our data, the paralog pair reduction events are
consistent with both hypotheses, the random choice of
pairs across the genome, and the random deletion of
DNA fragments, as long as these fragment lengths are
distributed as a negative exponential or geometric distribution. There is a major exception, in that some groups of
adjacent paralog pairs seem resistant to reduction.
The closer study of the partition of single-copy genes to
the two chromosomes within the AU reveals a distinct
tendency for adjacent genes to be located on the same

Page 2 of 11

chromosome. This results in longer runs of single-copy
genes on one of the chromosomes than would be
expected in a random partition model.
Over time this pattern of fractionation breaks down,
particularly for shorter AU while some longer runs of single-copy genes survive, presumably under selective pressure at some level.
In establishing these trends, we also discover great statistical regularity in the process of gene loss across the
eukaryotes and especially among the independent
descendants of a single WGD.

Results and Discussion
Dynamics of genome collapse

Figures 1B-1E summarize the gross statistical analysis of
the fifteen genomes, descendants of the six WGD events.
Figure 1B shows how the loss of paralogs roughly reflects
the age of the WGD, at least over the first 150 My. After
this period, a residual 5-10% of unreduced paralogies can
be attributed partly to functional divergence of the two
genes [14], although WGD paralogs have been shown to
differentiate functionally less than do duplicate gene pairs
originating through other mechanisms [16]. Figure 1C
measures the monotonic increase in rearrangement distance between the present-day genome and the closest
possible tetraploid ancestor, calculated by a "genome
halving" algorithm [17]. Of particular interest in these
two graphs is the relatively tight clustering of points representing genomes descending from the same WGD.
(The disproportionately rearranged yeast genome is that
of C. glabrata.)
Analytical units

To mitigate the effects of genome rearrangement in truncating runs of single-copy genes or artifactually creating
such runs, we focus on "analytical units" (AU), each consisting of a set of single-copy genes bounded at both ends
by a pair of duplicate genes, in parallel orientation, on the
same two chromosomes, as depicted in Figure 2. The
requirements on the duplicate genes assures us that, with
a few coincidental exceptions, the intervening single-copy
genes, on one or the other of the two chromosomes, arose
through the loss of one copy from a corresponding position on the other chromosome and that no rearrangement has interchanged material from outside the AU
with material inside it.
Thus, in contrast to much previous work, but in line
with recent Arabidopsis research [4,12], we consider AUs
containing single copies on two chromosomes instead of
just one because the fundamental constraint on deleting a
gene is whether its paralog has already been deleted.
Thus the choice of gene to delete is really two simultaneous choices, the first which pair of paralogs to reduce,
and the second within a pair to be reduced, which of the

two copies to eliminate. Are duplicate pairs to be reduced
chosen at random across the genome? Are the single gene
copies within an AU conserved indifferently on both
chromosomes, or do they tend to fall on only one of the
chromosomes?
Preliminary overview of the analysis of AUs

For the first question, under a model of random choice of
paralog pair to reduce, the number s of single copy genes
within an AU should be approximately geometrically distributed as N(s) = N(0)(1 - p)sp. The parameter p should
be a decreasing function of the number of gene losses,
and an increasing function of the number of rearrangements, as in Figure 1E. Indeed, as evolution proceeds, the
number of AU and their average lengths s should increase
over time, until there are relatively few paralogy pairs left
to reduce while the number of genomic rearrangements
continues to increase, disrupting AUs. These conflicting
processes affecting the number of AUs result in the pattern in Figure 1D. Again, in both of these figures, there is
a striking tendency for genomes descending from the
same WGD event to cluster together, indicating a common genomic dynamic determined by the size and structure of the initial doubled genome and the common
inherited evolutionary tendencies arising from DNA
repair mechanisms, generation time, and other factors.
Under a model of DNA excision, we can postulate a distribution of DNA fragment lengths in base pair units at
each deletion, the simplest being an negative exponential.
At the gene level this translates roughly into a geometric
distribution. As deletions accumulate, some of the AUs
become longer by the accumulation of fragments, while
at the same time new, relatively short, AUs are created.
Distribution of lengths of runs of reduced pairs

For each of the fifteen genomes studied, Figure 3 compares N(s), the observed frequency of occurrence of AUs
of length s with a geometric distribution fitted by mini-

Aside from the case s = 0, this is consistent with paralogy
reduction where duplicate pairs are chosen randomly. But
it does not exclude random DNA fragment elimination,
which can also produce a geometric distribution, as we
will explain in the next two sections.
One unexpected observation is the under-prediction of
N(0) by the geometric distribution model. In the presentday genomes descending from all the WGD events,
except that for yeast, we find a larger number of duplicate
pairs immediately adjacent to each other on both chromosomes, i.e., s = 0, than expected. As can be seen in Figure 1B, yeast has progressed the furthest in the loss of
duplicate genes, and this may account for why it no longer retains this pattern.
Concentration of single-copy genes

For the second question, which paralog to conserve when
a paralog pair is reduced, if the genes are affected independently, we can calculate the probability that exactly q
out of the s single-copy genes in an AU occur on the same
chromosome and s - q on the other is b(s, q) + b(s, s - q),
for q = 0, … , ⎢ s ⎥ , where b is the binomial distribution.
⎣2⎦
The cumulative probability that q or fewer single-copy
genes, out of s, will appear on the same chromosome [18]
is

s
∑i =0 b(s, i) + b(s, s − i), for q = 0,… , ⎢ 2 ⎥ . (The sum⎣ ⎦

statistic measuring the degree of concentration of the single copy genes within the AU on one chromosome or the
other,

where F (s, q) is the proportion of AUs of size s containing

and the number of paralog reductions was m. Note that
even if the simulations are biased in the total number of
AUs or the number of AUs of a given size, there is no bias
to be expected for the concentration of genes on one
chromosome or the other since we will be comparing
only AUs of the same size.
It can be seen that in the overwhelming majority of
cases, the real genomes exhibit greater concentration of

genes on one or the other chromosome ("biased fractionation" [8]) than in the simulated genomes. This is
reflected in the bulk of the cloud of data points, as well as
the mean cumulative over all simulations for a given s,
falling above the diagonal line in the graph. The number
of points above, on and below the diagonal are given

dom pattern, but this does not detract from the clear tendency for concentration of single copy genes in the four
other yeast genomes. The particularly striking case of
Arabidopsis has previously been characterized in some
detail [4].
Control on the simulation experiment

Figure 5 shows typical results of using random genomes
instead of the real genomes in Figure 4. It can be seen that
there is no evidence here of the "concentration" or "biased
fractionation" effect apparent in almost all the genomes
in Figure 4.
To analyze these tendencies in more detail, in particular
whether the plots in Figure 4 can help us distinguish
between the random DNA fragment excision and onegene-at-a-time explanations, we decomposed the boxed
triples of the number of dots above, on and below the
diagonal according to the length s of the AU. As a summary statistic we calculated the proportion of dots above
the diagonal for each s. These are plotted in Figure 6, both
the proportion of all dots, above, below and on the diagonal (Figure 6A) and the proportion of off-diagonal dots,
i.e., above or below the diagonal only (Figure 6B). For
those WGD with more than one descendant in our sample, we averaged the scores over all the descendants.
The random DNA fragment excision hypothesis is
most simply modeled by a one-parameter exponential (or
geometric) decline in deleted fragment length, Thus we
carried out a series of simulations with n = 12,000, s =
10,000 and d = 500. For each random deletion event, we
picked a random number ≥ 1 of adjacent deletions
according to a geometric distribution with mean μ. (Note
that these geometric distributions are defined over the
positive integers s, since it is meaningless to consider runs
of s deleted genes where s = 0, whereas the geometric distributions in Figure 3 are defined over the non-negative
integers, since s = 0 corresponds to the important case of
conservation of adjacent paralogy pairs.) The results of
three of these experiments (200 runs each), with μ = 1.0,
μ = 1.15 and μ = 2 are also depicted in Figure 6.
Two main patterns emerge in both Figure 6A and Figure 6B. First, genomes descended from the "young" WGD
events affecting Paramecium and, especially, Arabidopsis
closely follow the geometric simulation with mean μ = 2.
The other genomes are not well modeled by any geometric distribution. The example shown, with μ = 1.15, overpredicts the proportion of small AUs with a high degree
of fractionation and underpredicts the proportion of
large AUs with this property. The experiment with μ = 1
confirms that smaller μ worsen the fit with the long AU
data while the μ = 2 results confirm that larger μ worsen
the overprediction.
If we hypothesize that the "young" pattern of Paramecium and Arabidopsis resolves itself over hundreds of

Page 8 of 11

millions of years into the pattern displayed by yeast, vertebrates and teleosts, how can this change be interpreted?
First, as paralog reduction proceeds, AUs are enlarged by
the loss of internal "pillars" at their borders and the
merger of of smaller AUs. Moreover, the largest number
of AUs have length s = 1, and are hence not pertinent to
the concentrated-balanced distribution of single-copy
genes and so do not play a role in Figures 4 and 6. Many
of these, however, will grow into larger AUs. All these
processes are combinatorially more likely to attenuate
fractionation than to increase it. However, changes in
fractionation by the addition of one or a few new singlecopy genes will not change the position of the dot corresponding to a long AU in Figure 4 as much as it will a
short AU. Thus the greater proportional loss of dots
above the diagonal for smaller AU in the case of the more
ancient WGD.
The problem of runs of single-copy genes can then be
properly situated in the context of analytical units consisting of originally duplicated segments on two chromosomes instead of one, uninterrupted by rearrangements
since the WGD, and rephrased in terms of the concentration of single copies on either one of these chromosomes.
Here we can reject the random model in favor of a universal tendency towards a substantial degree of concentration. This may well be due to universal biophysical or
in vitro properties governing DNA fragmentation. This
explanation, however, would be difficult to reconcile with
the wide range of gene sizes and intergenic spacing in the
lineages we have studied. Alternative plausible explanations for the tendency to produce long runs of singlecopy genes on individual chromosomes within the AU are
a widespread neighborhood selection effect, possibly at
the transcriptional level, perhaps involving co-regulation
or common regulatory elements [20], dosage sensitivity
[3], or differential epigenetic marking [4,21].
Table 1 contains a comparison of the 15 genomes with
respect to WGD date, numbers of genes entering the
analysis, halving distance, AUs, geometric parameter, and
simulation results in Figure 4.

Conclusions
We decomposed the question of how WGD paralogs are
deleted into two problems, one of the random scattering
of reduced pairs across the genome, and the other of the
concentration of neighboring conserved paralogs on one
chromosome or another. For the first question, we cannot
reject random gene-by gene loss.
Nor can we rule out the elimination of geometricallydistributed, random length, DNA fragments. In the latter
model, if the segments eliminated are generally smaller
than one gene, this mechanism becomes indistinguishable from other processes of single gene inactivation, in
any case. We observed a high rate of retention of two or

more adjacent paralogs pairs (AUs with s = 0) in all
genomes except yeast, an effect which may be concentrated in certain functional classes of genes [21]. This
observation may be explicable in the same terms as the
concentration of the single-copy genes in an AU on one of
the two chromosomes, in terms of the co-regulation of
dosage sensitive genes [3]. Our results confirm those previously reported for Arabidopsis, although the effect is
particular salient in this genome.
If the pattern of paralogy reduction inferable from Figure 3 is consistent with independent gene-by-gene reduction, how can we reconcile this with the geometrically
distributed s-gene loss events in Figure 6? For the older
WGD, there is little contradiction, since the parameter of
the geometric distribution involved is so close to 1.0 that
it would be difficult to distinguish between the two models on the basis of the the AU data. In any case our results
in Figure 6 strongly suggest that ongoing selective processes other than paralogy reduction by either DNA elimination or gene-by-gene inactivation are responsible for
the current fractionation bias in the descendants of the
old events.

For the Paramecium and Arabidopsis data, which are
consistent with the geometric distribution of excised
fragment lengths with μ = 2, we must remember that half
of the fragments under this model will be of length 1.
Since an AU with s = 1 can only be fractionated one way,
this major segment of the data is not considered in Figure
4, 5 or 6, but it is a prominent feature of Figure 3. Moreover, s for Paramecium and Arabidopsis takes on small
values compared to the descendants of old WGDs. This
means that most AU are constructed from one or two
excision events, so that the tendency apparent in Figure 6
is not apparent in any distortion of the geometric distribution in Figure 3.
In general terms then, after the duplication, paralog
reduction events occur at a regular rate, affecting random
locations across the genome. Certain regions, containing
two or more pairs of paralogs adjacent on two chromosomes, resist this reduction over long periods of time. A
large proportion of the reduction events affect single
genes, so that a paralog pair loses one of its members,
with either copy being equally likely to disappear, through
pseudogenization preceded possibly by suppression of

Sankoff et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:313
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/313

transcription or other silencing mechanism, or through
actual deletion of all or most the exonic DNA from the
gene. The latter process may extend to the deletion of
two, three or more adjacent genes in a single reduction
event, though this is visible only in young WGDs, leaving
a run of singe-copy genes on only one of the two chromosomes containing the original paralog pairs. This contrasts with the former process, pseudogenization one
gene at a time, which is more likely to distribute the surviving members of duplicate pairs to the two chromosomes at random.
After hundreds of millions of years, neighboring singlecopy regions merge to become longer, as the resistant
paralog pairs are either reduced or diverge functionally,
and single-copy regions are disrupted by genome rearrangements, so that it becomes difficult to discern the
pattern of paralog reduction using single-copy region statistics, such as those calculated from our AU data.
Our results (Figure 1B) add credibility to observations
[21] that gene loss proceeds more rapidly initially and
then levels off, but also suggest a universal pattern of
genome collapse summarized by the patterns in Figures 1,
3 and 4 rather than a diversity of responses to WGD in
different evolutionary lineages. In particular, different
lineages deriving from the same WGD act remarkably
similarly as replicates of the same evolutionary "experiment" over hundreds of millions of years.

Methods
Constructing the analytical units (AU)

An AU is composed of two segments of the form p1, s,..., s,
q1 on one chromosome and p2, t,..., t, q2 on another chromosome (or elsewhere on the same chromosome), where
p1 and p2 are paralogs dating from the WGD, and so are q1
and q2, and the s and t are single-copy genes in the
genome. In addition p1 and p2 must have the same reading
direction, and q1 and q2 must have the same reading
direction. Alternatively, the AU can be of form p1, s,..., s,
q1 on one chromosome and q2, t,..., t, p2 where p1 and p2
have opposite reading directions, as do q1 and q2.
Data

Because our method is based on gene order, and this data
is available for few genomes, not all available in a single
database, we accessed a number of resources.

reference [9]. For Arabidopsis, all the data on gene order
and paralogy, specifically that paralogy due to the most
recent WGD event, is found in the supplemental materials to reference [12].
Poplar

Annotations for the Populus genome were obtained from
the database maintained by the U.S. Department of
Energy's Joint Genome Institute [11]. An all-by-all
BLASTP search was run on all Populus protein coding
genes, and orthoMCL [23] was used to construct gene
families. This work was carried out by P. Kerr Wall in
connection with the research described in reference [18].
Higher vertebrates

Chicken (Gallus gallus), opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and human (Homo sapiens) protein sequence data
were retrieved from ENSEMBL ver. 54. We first carried
out all-against-all BLASTP between all proteins from a
genome (using E-value 1E-5), and between proteins from
this genome and outgroups (Ciona intestinalis, Ciona
savignyi, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Danio rerio).
The paralogous hits give us the initial candidate gene
families. We retain those paralogous hits that satisfy two
requirements: 1) the paralog alignment is stronger than
the alignment of a paralog with the best orthologous
Ciona protein (intestinalis or savignyi), and 2) the paralog
alignment is weaker than any alignment with the best
orthologous fish protein (nigroviridis or rerio). This step
eliminates duplicate genes that arose after the most
recent common vertebrate WGD [15,24].
We filter away hits with alignment score < 140 bits in an
effort to retain only duplicates produced by the later of
the two vertebrate WGDs.
Singleton genes used for our analysis were also verified
with an outgroup by checking that the gene has a correspondence in both a fish genome and a Ciona genome.
Teleosts

We performed all-against-all BLASTP between all proteins in the fish genomes (medaka, stickleback, fugu,
nigroviridis). The complication here is that the ray-finned
fish have undergone both the two common WGD events
and the teleost WGD. We know, however, that the distribution of protein identity scores from the teleost WGD is
shifted to distinctly higher values compared to the earlier
vertebrate WGDs [13]. We thus use best-reciprocal hit
(BRH) to separate out the closest paralog-pairs in each
gene family to attribute to the teleost WGD.

Yeast, Paramecium, Arabidopsis

For the five yeast genomes, all the data on gene order and
paralogy, specifically that paralogy due to the WGD
event, is explicitly detailed on the Yeast Genome Browser
[10,22].
For Paramecium, all the data on gene order and paralogy, specifically that paralogy due to the most recent
WGD event, is found in the supplemental materials to

Preprocessing

Aside from the filtering of duplicates discussed above,
two additional difficulties were encountered as we prepared the data for the simulations necessary to assess
concentrations of single copies in AUs. One derived from
incomplete assembly of many of the genomes, resulting in
many short contigs. To avoid reproducing simulated

Sankoff et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:313
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/313

genomes having this defect, without distorting at the
same time the numbers of duplicates and single-copy
genes in the genome, we simply discarded contigs unless
they contained either at least two duplicated genes or ten
single-copy genes.
In the poplar genome, because of the numerous gene
families, we estimated the tetraploid ancestor and then
created the simulated genomes by initially removing all
members of multigene families. We restored these genes
on a random basis before constructing the AUs in the
simulated genomes.
WGD dates

We used dates suggested in the primary references cited
for each genome [10-13,15]. The Paramecium date is
speculative, based on protein identity scores [9] compared to human-mouse divergence scores, with allowance made for generation-time differences. The dates
enter our analysis only in Figure 1, and all that is really
necessary to illustrate the trends depicted is a rank ordering of the dates.
