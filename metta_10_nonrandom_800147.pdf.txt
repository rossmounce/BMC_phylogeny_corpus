Non-random genomic integration - an intrinsic
property of retrogenes in Drosophila?
Muralidhar Metta1,2, Christian Schlötterer1*

Abstract
Background: The Drosophila X-chromosome shows a significant underrepresentation of genes with male-biased
gene expression (demasculinization). This trend is matched by retrogenes, which typically have a male biased gene
expression pattern and show a significant movement bias from X-chromosomes to autosomes. It is currently
assumed that these patterns are best explained by selection, either mediated by male meiotic sex chromosome
inactivation (MSCI) or sexually antagonistic forces. We scrutinized the evolutionary dynamics of retroposition by
focusing on retrogenes for which the parental copy has degenerated.
Results: Consistent with a functional substitution of the degenerated gene by the retrogene, patterns of sequence
evolution and gene expression were similar between retroposed and parental genes. Like previous studies, our set
of retrogenes showed a significant movement off the X-chromosome. In contrast to data sets where retroposition
caused gene duplication, the genes in our study showed primarily female-biased or unbiased gene expression.
Conclusions: Based on our results, the biased transposition pattern cannot be explained by MSCI and probably
not by sexual antagonism. Rather, we propose that the movement away from the X-chromosome represents a
general property of retroposition in Drosophila.

Background
The integration of reverse transcribed messenger RNA
into the genome is called retroposition. This process has
important evolutionary consequences as it typically
results in an additional gene copy, lacking introns and
regulatory sequences. In Drosophila retrogenes show
interesting dynamics. Rather than moving randomly in
the genome, retroposed gene copies preferentially originate from X-linked genes and move to autosomes [1].
In combination with the preferential male biased gene
expression of retroposed genes, their non-random integration pattern has been used to explain the “demasculinization of the X-chromosomes” [2,3]. In comparison to
autosomes, X-chromosomes contain fewer genes that
are more strongly expressed in males than in females
[4]. This underrepresentation of male biased genes on
the X-chromosome is not yet fully understood. It has
been suggested that male meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) or sexual antagonism may be the evolutionary force driving the movement of retroposed genes,

which ultimately leads to contrasting patterns in gene
expression between X-chromosome and autosomes
[5-7].
Central to this interpretation is the assumption that
the parental gene had a functionally important gene
expression during male meiosis (i.e.: either a male biased
gene or housekeeping gene) [8]. A retroposed copy
could substitute the function during male meiosis and
thus avoid the deleterious effect of MSCI in testis
[9-11]. Given the experimental challenge to disentangle
the division of function among the retroposed and parental copy as well as distinguishing between subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization, we used an
alternative approach to test the contribution of retroposition to the demasculinization of the Drosophila
X-chromosome.

Results
Aiming for functional similarity of the retrogene and its
parental copy, we analyzed only those cases where the
parental copy, giving rise to the retroposed gene, had
been lost. We used the well-curated data set of positionally relocated genes for 12 Drosophila species [12] to

show that not all genes are annotated in 12 Drosophila
species. Nevertheless, for all genes except CG16771 and
CG14286, the gene could be identified at least in a close
relative, suggesting that the missing annotations in FlyBase reflect imperfections of the available genomic
sequences rather than a loss of genes. Moreover, BLAST
search of D. melanogaster protein against other
sequenced Dipteran insect genomes Culex pipens, Aedes
aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, covering approximately
about 250 million years of divergence, suggests their
conservation in other Dipteran species (see table in
additional file 2).
Retroposition has frequently been shown to result in an
accelerated rate of evolution, probably reflecting the
acquisition of novel functional properties [15]. We
tested for evidence of accelerated evolution after the retroposition event using the branch model of PAML [16].
Out of 20 genes tested, we found four genes with a
p-value smaller than 0.05 (CG2059, CG2227, CG12375,
CG14286), but after Bonferroni correction for multiple
testing none of them remained significant (see table in
additional file 3). Hence, we did not find evidence for a
functional shift of the retrogenes as evidenced by accelerated sequence evolution after the transposition event.

identify bona fide retroposed genes. In case of retrotransposition, the copy without introns is the retroposed
copy while the copy with introns is the ancestral copy.
Hence we used the following criteria: 1) absence of
introns in at least one species, and 2) presence of at
least one intron in at least one species. This resulted in
46 genes that were relocated by retroposition and for
which the parental copy was degenerated/lost. We
further scrutinized this data set by keeping only those
genes for which at least one flanking gene confirmed
the chromosomal relocation. We also eliminated genes
from genomes with low sequence coverage that exhibited very poor sequence quality. After these quality control steps, we obtained 20 genes that unambiguously
relocated by retroposition and for which the parental
copy was degraded. This data set was expanded to
include the gene RplP2 (CG4918) for which we had
independent evidence from SAGE data [13,14] (see additional file 1). Hence, in total our data set consisted of 21
genes with an unambiguous relocation of the retroposed
copy while the parental copy was degraded.
All 21 genes were preserved over 40 million years (i.e.,
present in D. melanogaster and D. grimshawi), suggesting the functional importance of these genes. Table 1

As a final test for functional equivalence of retroposed
and parental copies we compared sex-biased gene
expression (Table 2). About 40% of the genes
(CG12375, CG1354, CG14779, CG16771, CG2059,
CG33250, CGCG4918, CG8239, CG9126) showed the
same sex-bias among all species, irrespective of whether
a retroposed gene or the parental gene was present in
the corresponding species. Hence, all these genes had an
expression pattern that was similar between retroposed
and parental gene copies. Several genes showed, however, a striking heterogeneity in gene expression among
species. Interestingly, this heterogeneity in gene expression could be detected among species carrying the retroposed copy as well as among species carrying the
parental copy. Hence, the sex-biased gene expression
pattern of these genes is highly unstable, but no apparent effect of the retroposition could be noted. Taken
together, the results of gene conservation, analysis of
molecular evolution and gene expression suggest that
transposition did not result in a functional alteration.
Retroposed and parental copies are therefore probably
functionally equivalent.
Out of 21 functionally equivalent retroposition events,
15 genes moved from the X-chromosome to an

autosome (Figure 1). In contrast, only three moved from
an autosome to the X chromosome and three moved
among autosomes. This is a highly significant excess of
retroposition events off the X-chromosome (c 2 =
27.884; df = 2; p = 8.8 × 10-7). This pattern of retroposition has been previously described and explained by
selection (mediated either by MSCI or sexual antagonism) favouring an autosomal location of genes with
male-biased gene expression [1]. Interestingly, not a single gene in our data set has male biased gene expression
in all or the majority of the species analyzed. Apart
from CG5029, for which 50% of the species showed
male-biased gene expression, significant male-biased
gene expression was observed for only three individual
gene/species combinations (Table 2). This contrasts
with 29 species/gene combinations showing significant
female-biased gene expression.
Since male biased expression is only a rough measure
of testis expression, we further looked at the retroposed
copies that are located on the autosomes in D. melanogaster for their testis specificity in expression. According
to the criteria of [17], only one out of 5 genes was
expressed in testis, and even this one had a lower testis
expression than in ovaries or most of the other tissues
(Figure 2b, additional file 4). Hence, the preferential
movement out of the X-chromosome in our data set
cannot be explained by selection operating on genes
with male-biased or testis expression.

Discussion
Retroposition creates one additional gene copy, which
lacks introns and most of the regulatory sequences. In
most cases, the retroposed copy either acquires a novel
function (neofunctionalization) [18] or some of the functions of the parental gene are divided among the retrogene and the parental copy (subfunctionalization) [19].
Here we have studied a special case, in which the retrogene has functionally replaced the parental copy that was
either degenerated or lost. If the parental gene copy has a
very simple expression pattern, it is conceivable that a
freshly retroposed gene could by chance capture regulatory sequences that mimic the parental expression pattern. We found considerable gene expression differences
among tissues for those genes of our data set, which
carry introns in D. melanogaster (Figure 2a, additional
file 4). Hence, it appears unlikely that a freshly retroposed gene could already fully substitute the parental
copy, as it is assumed that retrogenes start with a simple
expression pattern and acquire more complex regulation
later [20]. Indeed, we found that those genes for which
only the retrogene is present in D. melanogaster also
showed heterogeneity in gene expression among tissues
(Figure 2b, additional file 4). Thus, some explanation is
required to justify how retrogenes could be maintained

given that Drosophila has a pronounced mutation bias
towards deletions [21], which is expected to degenerate
the retrogene. It is conceivable that the retrogene first
acquires a function, either by subfunctionalization [22]
or neofunctionalization [23]. If a subsequent mutation in
the parental copy causes a slightly impaired function, it is
possible that selection could favour the spread of regulatory mutations that restore gradually the function of the
parental copy. Once the retrogene is able to substitute
the vital functions of the parental copy, the original copy
could accumulate further mutations and will be eventually lost. Some support for this model could be gleaned
from the genes CG9742 and CG1639, for which we still
detected traces of the parental gene in D. pseudoobscura
and D. persimilis, but which had already accumulated
several stop codons. Another interesting case is the gene
CG1639. In D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, the retrogene has replaced the parental copy. In D. virilis,
D. mojavensis and D. grimshawi, we detected a second
origin of a retroposed copy, but in this case the parental
copy is still preserved. Based on the divergence
time of these species, the retrocopy originated about
30-40 million years ago. In addition, it has been shown
that in Drosophila e(y)2, a retrocopy of e(y)2b gene functionally displaced the parental copy during evolution
[24]. Similarly, TAF1, a human ubiquitously expressed
general transcription factor was shown to be functionally
replaced by its retroposed homologue TAF1L [25]. It
appears that it is not uncommon that the retrogene and
parental gene can have similar function.
The preferential male-biased gene expression of retrogenes in combination with the under-representation
of male-biased genes on the X-chromosome has been
widely viewed as strong support for selection driving the
pronounced movement bias of retrogenes from the
X-chromosome to the autosomes. Further insights into
the evolutionary fate of male-biased genes could be
obtained from the analysis of the Muller’s element D,
which is ancestrally autosomal, but has been translocated and forms part of a neo-X chromosome in
D. pseudoobscura. If selection is a major evolutionary
force for the movement of retrogenes, one may
expect an increased rate of retroposition events off the
X-chromosome. Indeed, Sturgill et al. [2] described eight
male biased genes that moved from the X to the autosomes. Nevertheless, a re-analysis of the chromosomal
movements did not provide support for retroposition
driving this relocation. Rather, we found unambiguous
support for a genomic translocation for six genes.
Hence, despite a presumably strong selective force driving male biased genes off the X-chromosome, we found
no evidence that retroposition mediates this effect.
Two recent studies found a general trend for the
movement of genes from the X-chromosome to the

Page 5 of 7

autosomes and the relocated genes showed an expression in testis [26,27]. While this observation is consistent with X-linked genes escaping inactivation during
spermatogenesis, there are some open questions. First,
as both copies of the gene continue to be present
it remains speculative to what extent the duplicate
gene has acquired a function during spermatogenesis
from the paternal copy. Second, also genes moving
among autosomes show male biased gene expression
[27]. Third, one study relied entirely on data from
D. melanogaster to identify expression in testis [26].
Given the high turnover of sex-biased gene expression it
is not clear how robust this approach is [28]. Fourth, it
is not yet understood how strong the selection against
male biased/testis expressed genes on the X chromosome is. While there is little doubt about the existence
of the X chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis, it is also clear that many genes with an expression
in testis persist on the X-chromosome.
Our analysis of retrogenes lacking a functional copy
relies on a conceptually different approach to understand
the movement of genes away from the X-chromosome.
These genes showed the same insertion bias as other retrogenes, but in contrast to previously analyzed retro genes
[1] no male-biased gene expression was found. This observation provides no support for a simple selection scenario
favouring an autosomal location of male-biased genes.
Rather it suggests a neutral mutation bias that prefers the
origin of retrogenes on the X-chromosome and their
insertion into autosomes. We note, however, that in
mammals there is strong evidence that the out of the
X-movement is not the product of a simple transposition
bias, as pseudogenes do not show this effect [29]. Hence, it
may well be that the evolutionary forces responsible for
the out of the X-movement differ between Drosophila and
mammals. One obvious difference between Drosophila
and mammals that could be involved in this difference is
the dosage compensation mechanism.

Conclusions
Consistent with previous results, our data suggests an
excess of retrotransposition events out of X-chromosome in Drosophila, but do not show a male-biased or
testis specific expression. These results indicate that the
biased transposition pattern cannot be due to MSCI or
sexual antagonism, rather the pattern is a general property of retrotransposition in Drosophila.
Methods
Identification of retrogenes with degenerated parental
copies

Drosophila positionally relocated genes [12] were
screened for genes that are putatively relocated due to
retroposition. 46 genes were identified which are likely

Metta and Schlötterer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:114
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/114

to be retrogenes that lost the parental copy in some species. These genes were reannotated using Genescan [30]
and GeneWise [31] programs to confirm the gene models in all 11 newly sequenced Drosophila species [32].
For identifying the chromosomal location, we used
information from the flanking genes, as sequences from
all the species were not assigned to particular chromosomes. Using the assemblies of 11 Drosophila species
http://flybase.org, we checked for the orthologs of the
neighbouring genes in D. melanogaster on a scaffold in
which the gene is located and used this information for
assigning the Muller’s element location of the gene in a
species. Genes that lack support from flanking genes
about their chromosomal assignment and genes that
were misclassified due to sequencing artefacts were
removed from further analysis (Additional file 5). Out of
46 genes, 26 were ambiguous and were excluded from
the analysis. The remaining genes are retrogenes that
lack a parental copy in some species (Table 1). For
some genes the parental copy in D. melanogaster has
more than one isoform. We used all isoforms to predict
the gene models and all of them show the loss of
introns confirming retrotransposition event. To this data
we added the gene RplP2 which contained introns in
the UTR regions (Additional file 1).
Cross species conservation

To identify the evolutionary conservation of these genes
across different Dipteran species that diverged about
250 million years ago, we performed BLASTP search
against Culex pipens, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae genomic sequences.
Identification of selection

Multiple sequence alignments were obtained using
‘Dialign’ program [33] and inspected manually for alignment artefacts. A phylogenetic tree for each gene was
constructed using the Tree Puzzle program [34]. The
lineage separating species with parental and retrogene is
considered to be a foreground branch. If the retrocopy
evolves at a different rate than the parental copy, this
lineage should evolve at an accelerated rate. Branch models as implemented in the PAML program were used for
identification of an accelerated rate of evolution. The null
hypothesis in the branch model is that all the branches
have a single ω (dN/dS) ratio and was tested against the
alternative two-ratio model that allows a different ω ratio
for the foreground branch [35]. A significant likelihood
ratio test indicates that the foreground branch is evolving
at an accelerated rate of evolution.
Gene expression analysis

The expression in different tissues of larval and adult
stages in D. melanogaster was obtained from the

Page 6 of 7

FlyAtlas database [36]. The sex-biased expression in
D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis and D. mojavensis was obtained from
[28]. A significant sex-bias in gene expression was
taken from [28], which was determined based on a
Mann-Whitney U test corrected for false discovery
rate.
Expected number of retroposition events between
chromosomes

The expected number of retroposition events was
obtained using the expectation formula developed by
Betran et al [1] in D. melanogaster, which accounts for
the number of genes per chromosome, size of the chromosome and dosage compensation. A chi-square test
was performed to detect heterogeneity among the retroposition events between chromosomes.
