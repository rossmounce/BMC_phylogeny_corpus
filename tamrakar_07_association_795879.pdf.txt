Abstract
Background: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), the etiology of which is still uncertain, increases the risk of
preterm birth. Recent PCR-based studies suggested that BV is associated with complex vaginal
bacterial communities, including many newly recognized bacterial species in non-pregnant women.
Methods: To examine whether these bacteria are also involved in BV in pregnant Japanese
women, vaginal fluid samples were taken from 132 women, classified as normal (n = 98),
intermediate (n = 21), or BV (n = 13) using the Nugent gram stain criteria, and studied. DNA
extracted from these samples was analyzed for bacterial sequences of any Lactobacillus, four
Lactobacillus species, and four BV-related bacteria by PCR with primers for 16S ribosomal DNA
including a universal Lactobacillus primer, Lactobacillus species-specific primers for L. crispatus, L.
jensenii, L. gasseri, and L. iners, and BV-related bacterium-specific primers for BVAB2, Megasphaera,
Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium.
Results: The prevalences of L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri were significantly higher, while
those of BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium were significantly lower
in the normal group than in the BV group. Unlike other Lactobacillus species, the prevalence of L.
iners did not differ between the three groups and women with L. iners were significantly more likely
to have BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium. Linear regression analysis
revealed associations of BVAB2 and Megasphaera with Nugent score, and multivariate regression
analyses suggested a close relationship between Eggerthella-like bacterium and BV.
Conclusion: The BV-related bacteria, including BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthellalike bacterium, are common in the vagina of pregnant Japanese women with BV. The presence of
L. iners may be correlated with vaginal colonization by these BV-related bacteria.

Background
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the disturbed vaginal flora, in
which normal lactobacilli are replaced by an overgrowth
of various anaerobic bacteria [1]. This condition is common in women of reproductive age [1,2] and may cause
malodorous vaginal discharge, although in many women
it is asymptomatic [3]. In pregnant women, bacterial vaginosis has been suggested to be a risk factor of perinatal
complications, including preterm birth [1,4-12] and chorioamnionitis [4,13]. These complications are closely
associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Bacteria detected in BV flora include Gardnerella vaginalis,
Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus species (sp.), and other
anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Peptostreptococcus sp., Prevotella sp.,
and Bacteroides sp. [1,14-16]. Recently, bacteria such as
Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera sp., Leptotrichia sp., and
Eggerthella-like bacterium have been reported as microorganisms related to this condition by molecular analyses
[17-19]. Fredricks et al. identified three phylogenetically
distinct bacterial DNA sequences in human vaginal samples highly specific for this condition and designated
them BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) 1~3 [19]. They
showed that BVABs, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium are more specific for BV than Gardnerella and Atopobium [19]. Among BVABs, BVAB2 was
shown to be more sensitive for BV than BVAB1 and
BVAB3, while the specificities of three BVABs were similar
[19]. We use the term "BV-related bacteria" for bacteria
including BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium in this manuscript. However, it is
important to note that these organisms have not been
proven to be causative agents of BV.
The healthy human vaginal flora in reproductive age is
usually predominated by Lactobacillus species. Their metabolic products, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lactic
acid, and bacteriocin are believed to play an important
role in maintenance of the normal vaginal flora by inhibiting colonization by other pathogens [20-23]. The predominant Lactobacillus species in the normal
lactobacillary flora were shown by molecular biological
analyses to be L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and L. jensenii [23-28].
In recent studies, L. iners described as L. 1086V by Antonio
et al. [24] was identified as one of the common Lactobacillus species colonizing the human vagina [18,28-31]. Only
9% of the strains of this species produce H2O2, whereas
almost all strains of L. crispatus and L. jensenii produce
H2O2 [24].
To date, there have been few studies regarding the frequencies of the BV-related bacteria described above and
Lactobacillus species in healthy and abnormal vaginal flora
in pregnant women. The present study was performed to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/128

evaluate the prevalence of the BV-related bacteria and the
common Lactobacillus species in normal and BV flora in
pregnant Japanese women. We used a specific PCR
method targeting the bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA
(rDNA) region for this purpose.

Methods
Patients
A total of 163 pregnant Japanese women were enrolled in
this study during routine prenatal visits at Hokkaido University Hospital from May 2005 to February 2006.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants in
verbal form. Vaginal fluid samples were collected at a
mean of 23 weeks of gestation. Estimated date of delivery
was determined from the last menstrual period and early
gestational fetal ultrasonographic measurements.
Sample collection, Nugent's scoring, and bacterial culture
A sterile speculum was inserted into the vagina and a specimen of vaginal fluid was obtained by brushing the posterior vaginal fornix with a swab. A vaginal smear was
prepared by rolling a swab onto a glass slide, which was
then air-dried, heat-fixed, and Gram-stained. The smears
were then assessed according to Nugent criteria [32]. The
other swab was spread onto Columbia blood agar plates,
and incubated at 35°C under aerobic conditions in 5%
CO2 and anaerobic conditions for 48 h. Lactobacilli were
identified to the genus level by Gram staining of colonies
and from colony morphology on blood agar plates.
DNA extraction and PCR
Another swab was placed in 1 ml of PBS with subsequent
vigorous vortexing to dislodge cells. The cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was digested
with proteinase K at 56°C for 30–60 min and the DNA
was extracted and purified with a QIAmp DNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Germantown, MD) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, resulting in 200 µl of DNA solution. PCR mixtures consisted of PCR buffer with 1.5 mM
of MgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, 2.0 µM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, 0.1 µl of Taq DNA
polymerase, and 1.5 µl of template DNA solution in a
final volume of 15 µl.

Sequences and annealing temperatures for the various
primer sets are listed in Table 1[19,33]. All primers were
located in the 16S rDNA region. PCR was carried out for
40 cycles. For the Lactobacillus genus and its four species,
the denaturation was performed at 95°C for 15 s followed
by a 1-min annealing and extension step. For four BVrelated bacteria, the denaturation step was set at 94°C for
30 s, followed by the annealing step for 30 s for BVAB2,
Megasphaera, and Leptotrichia and for 40 s for Eggerthellalike bacterium, with extension at 72°C for 1 min for all
reactions. A final extension step at 72°C for 7 min was

lyzed PCR products from several vaginal samples amplified by the specific primers for L. iners and confirmed that
the sequences of PCR products were completely consistent with L. iners (GenBank AY526083).

The specificity of the Lactobacillus species-specific PCR for
14 common intestinal Lactobacillus species was evaluated
and confirmed using 106 copies of one Lactobacillus species to each reaction as template DNA (Table 2). The universal Lactobacillus primer amplified all of these
Lactobacillus species. The specific primers for L. crispatus, L.
jensenii, and L. gasseri only amplified the corresponding
species and did not amplify 13 other species (Table 2).
They also did not amplify a cloned fragment of 16S rDNA
region of L. iners. The specific primers for L. iners did not
amplify any of 14 Lactobacillus species (Table 2). We ana-

The sensitivities of the species-specific PCR for L. crispatus,
L. jensenii, and L. gasseri were measured using serial dilutions of DNA solution of the reference strain. Similarly,
for L. iners, serial dilutions of a cloned fragment of 16S
rDNA region of L. iners were used instead. The sensitivity
of the species-specific PCR for L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and
L. gasseri and that of L. iners PCR were 102 to 103 copies
and 102 copies per reaction, respectively.

Statistical analysis
Fisher's exact probability test was used for statistical analysis. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis using SPSS™
for Windows was performed to evaluate the independent
risk factors, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Clinical characteristics of women in three groups divided
by Nugent score
A total of 163 samples from 163 pregnant women were
obtained during the study period and 31 samples were
excluded because of lack of information regarding the gestational week at delivery (n = 21) or Gram staining (n =
10). The remaining 132 samples from 132 women were
analyzed and classified according to the Nugent criteria.
Ninety-eight women (74.2%) were classified as having
normal vaginal flora, 21 (15.9%) were intermediate, and
13 (9.8%) were BV. Samples from these women were
divided into normal, intermediate, and BV groups, respectively.

The clinical characteristics of the pregnant women are
summarized in Table 3. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean maternal age, number of nulliparous women, gestational week at sampling,
gestational week at delivery, or birth weight of the
neonate among the three groups. Of the total of 132
women, 35 (26.5%) delivered at <37 weeks, 9 (6.8%) at
<33 weeks, and 4 (3.0%) at <30 weeks of gestation.
Detection rate of lactobacilli and BV-related bacteria in
three groups by PCR
Genus Lactobacillus (any Lactobacillus) was detected in
almost all women irrespective of Nugent score (Table 4).
The detection rates of L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri
were significantly higher in the normal group than in the
BV group, while that of L. iners did not differ between the

three groups. In contrast, the detection rates of BVAB2,
Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium
were significantly lower in the normal group than in the
BV group.
Independent risk factors for abnormal Nugent score
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to
evaluate the independent contributions of the various
bacteria to the abnormal vaginal flora (Tables 5 and 6).
Seven bacteria, i.e., L. crispatus,L jensenii,L. gasseri, BVAB2,
Megasphaera,Leptotrichia and, Eggerthella-like bacterium,
were entered as variates to be analyzed (P < 0.1, Fisher's
exact probability test). The absence of L. crispatus and the
presence of Megasphaera were selected as two independent
risk factors of Nugent score ≥ 4, giving Odds ratios of 0.2
and 13.3, respectively (Table 5). Likewise, the presence of
Eggerthella-like bacterium was selected as an independent
risk factor of Nugent score ≥ 7, giving an Odds ratio of 6.2
(Table 6). Linear regression analyses revealed that BVAB2
and Megasphaera were associated with Nugent score.
Coexistence of BV-related bacteria with L. iners
L. iners was detected by PCR in 55 of 132 (41.7%) women,
and its prevalence did not differ between the groups classified according to Nugent score (Table 4). However, the
presence of L. iners appeared to be positively associated
with colonization by BV-related bacteria (Table 7). The
detection rates of all BV-related bacteria were significantly
higher in samples harboring L. iners. No such association
was seen between the presence or absence of L. iners and
the detection rate of any other Lactobacillus species.
Difference in the detection of Lactobacillus species
between PCR and culture methods
Lactobacillus was cultured from 91 (92.9%) of 98 samples,
11 (52.4%) of 21 samples, and 2 (15.4%) of 13 samples
of the normal, intermediate, and BV groups, respectively
(data not shown). These observations conflicted markedly

with the results obtained by the PCR method, especially in
women with abnormal vaginal flora with respect to detection of Lactobacillus. Of the eleven women with BV from
whom Lactobacillus was uncultured but detected by PCR,
L. iners was detected in 5 women and L. crispatus was
detected in only one woman by PCR, suggesting that L.
iners is less likely to be cultured than L. crispatus. To determine which species of Lactobacillus is difficult to culture,
the detection rates by PCR of various species of Lactobacillus were compared with those by the conventional culture
method (Table 8). Among 130 samples determined to
contain any Lactobacillus by the PCR method, 104
(80.0%) were positive for Lactobacillus by the culture
method (Table 8). More than 90% of samples determined
to contain L. crispatus, L. jensenii, or L. gasseri by the PCR
method were determined to have Lactobacillus by the conventional culture method. Among 24 samples in which L.
crispatus was the only Lactobacillus species identified by the
PCR method, Lactobacillus was cultured from 22 samples
(91.7%), while Lactobacillus was cultured only from
47.6% and 27.3% of samples in which L. iners and
unspecified Lactobacillus species, respectively, were the
only Lactobacillus species identified by the PCR method.
Thus, L. iners, and unspecified Lactobacillus species other
than L. crispatus, L. jensenii, or L. gasseri appeared to have
stringent cultivation requirements.

In the present study, we confirmed that L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and L. jensenii were common species in pregnant Japanese women with normal vaginal flora by speciesspecific PCR of the 16S rDNA region. These three species
were less prevalent in women with BV. In contrast, four
BV-related bacteria, i.e., BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia,
and Eggerthella-like bacterium, were detected at higher
prevalence in women with BV. As all these results were in
accordance with those of Fredricks et al. [19] who analyzed the vaginal fluid of non-pregnant women with and
without BV using the broad-range 16S rDNA PCR and
cloning methods, BV is suggested to have remarkably similar microbiological profiles among women with different
demographic characteristics, including race and pregnancy, as suggested by the conventional cultivation
method.
L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and L. jensenii are common Lactobacillus species found in the vagina [24-28,31,34]. L. iners,
described recently as a new Lactobacillus species [29], is
one of the common Lactobacillus species of the vaginal
microbiota [18,19,23,28,30,31], which was also confirmed in the present study. The results showed that L.
iners was present in 40% to 50% of women irrespective of
Nugent score, as observed in an earlier study [19]. We
examined twelve samples positive for L. iners (6 from normal flora and 6 from BV flora) to determine whether the
abundance of L. iners was different in the two groups. The

species-specific PCR for L. iners using serial dilutions of
each sample revealed that both normal and BV flora contained 103 to 105 copies/µl of L. iners and the median concentration was 104 copies/µl for both.
As the presence of H2O2-producing lactobacilli in the vaginal fluid is associated with a reduced risk of BV [15,24]
and because the concentration of H2O2 in the vaginal
fluid is low in women with BV as compared with those
with normal vaginal flora [21], the H2O2-producing ability of lactobacilli is thought to play a significant role in
protecting the vaginal ecosystem from BV infection,
although direct evidence to support this notion is lacking.
Nearly all strains of L. crispatus and L. jensenii have been
reported to produce H2O2, whereas only 9% of the strains
of L. iners produce H2O2 [24]. The prevalences of L. crispatus and L. jensenii were significantly higher in the normal
group than in the BV group and the detection rates of all
BV-related bacteria were significantly higher in women
with than in those without L. iners in this study. Although
this observation is consistent with the notion that H2O2producing ability of lactobacilli is important in protecting
the vaginal ecosystem from BV infection, it remains to be

The newly proposed "BV-related bacteria," including
BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium, were all shown to be associated with BV in the
present study, confirming the results of a recent study by
Fredricks et al. [19]. However, the detection rates of these
bacteria in women with BV were lower, while those in
women with normal flora were similar to their results
[19]. BVAB2 is cultivation-resistant, one of three bacteria
(provisionally named BV-associated bacteria: BVAB1,
BVAB2, and BVAB3) newly found to be highly specific for
BV in the vagina of non-pregnant women [19], and not
closely related to other bacteria as shown by comparison
of 16S rDNA. In the present study, BVAB2 was present in
38.5% (5/13) and 3.1% (3/98) of women with BV and
with normal vaginal flora, respectively, while Fredricks et
al. reported these rates to be 88.9% (24/27) and 4.3% (2/
46), respectively [19]. Similarly, detection rates of Megasphaera (69.2%),Eggerthella-like bacterium (53.8%), and
Leptotrichia (53.8%) in women with BV in the present
study were lower than those of 96.3%, 92.6%, and 85.2%
reported by Fredricks et al. [19], while detection rates of
Megasphaera (11.2%),Eggerthella-like bacterium (7.1%),
and Leptotrichia (14.3%) in women with normal vaginal
flora were comparable to their values of 8.7%, 8.7%, and
4.3%, respectively [19].
The results of the present study raised the possibility that
the four BV-related bacteria were less prevalent in pregnant Japanese women with BV as compared with nonpregnant American women. However, the number of subjects with BV in the present study was too low to draw
definitive conclusions about the prevalence of bacteria in
different populations. Further studies using different
demographic populations are needed to determine the
roles of these BV-related bacteria in the pathogenesis of
BV.

Twelve (92%) of 13 women with BV were positive for
genus Lactobacillus by 16S rDNA PCR using the universal
Lactobacillus primer, including 5 women with L. iners, one
with both L. iners and L. crispatus, one with L. crispatus,
and 5 with unspecified Lactobacillus. Of these 13 women,
only one with L. iners was positive for Lactobacillus by general cultivation methods and positive for Gram-positive
rods on Gram staining. These results suggested that many
women with BV harbor genus Lactobacillus in the vagina
and that the number of these lactobacilli colonizing the
vagina is small. Further, as L. iners has been reported to
require specialized blood agar media for isolation [29],
the conventional culture method used in this study may
have failed to reveal its colonization in the vagina.

Conclusion
Our results suggested that BV-related bacteria, including
BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium, were associated with BV in pregnant Japanese
women. The presence of L. iners, one of the common
Lactobacillus species in the vagina, may be correlated with
vaginal colonization by these BV-related bacteria. It
remains to be determined whether BV-related bacteria
cause BV or are common and abundant as a consequence
of BV.
