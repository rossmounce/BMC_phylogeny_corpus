Background: Pseudomonas fluorescens are common soil bacteria that can improve plant health
through nutrient cycling, pathogen antagonism and induction of plant defenses. The genome

into genes used by P. fluorescens in its natural environment and an improved understanding of the
ecological significance of diversity within this species.
Results: Comparisons of three P. fluorescens genomes (SBW25, Pf0-1, Pf-5) revealed considerable
divergence: 61% of genes are shared, the majority located near the replication origin. Phylogenetic
and average amino acid identity analyses showed a low overall relationship. A functional screen of
SBW25 defined 125 plant-induced genes including a range of functions specific to the plant
environment. Orthologues of 83 of these exist in Pf0-1 and Pf-5, with 73 shared by both strains.
The P. fluorescens genomes carry numerous complex repetitive DNA sequences, some resembling
Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs). In SBW25, repeat density and
distribution revealed 'repeat deserts' lacking repeats, covering approximately 40% of the genome.
Conclusions: P. fluorescens genomes are highly diverse. Strain-specific regions around the
replication terminus suggest genome compartmentalization. The genomic heterogeneity among the
three strains is reminiscent of a species complex rather than a single species. That 42% of plantinducible genes were not shared by all strains reinforces this conclusion and shows that ecological
success requires specialized and core functions. The diversity also indicates the significant size of
genetic information within the Pseudomonas pan genome.

Background

Pseudomonas fluorescens is a physiologically diverse species
of opportunistic bacteria (gamma-proteobacteria) found
throughout terrestrial habitats. The species contributes
greatly to the turnover of organic matter and, while present in
soil, is abundant on the surfaces of plant roots and leaves. Of
the plant-colonizing strains, some, such as isolates SBW25
and Pf-5, positively affect plant health and nutrition [1-3].
The mechanistic bases of these effects remain unclear, but are
known to include the production of plant growth hormones,
the suppression of pathogens (especially fungi and oomycetes) detrimental to plant health via competitive and/or allelopathic effects, and the direct elicitation of plant defense
responses [4].
It has been argued that exploitation of these plant growth promoting bacteria in agriculture requires an improved understanding of the determinants of ecological performance,
particularly persistence [5]. To this end, in vivo expression
technology (IVET) promoter trapping strategies were devised
and implemented to identify plant-induced and soil-induced
genes [5-9]. In these early studies a number of coding
sequences (CDSs) of ecological relevance were found to be
up-regulated, including a type III secretion system [10,11], a
cellulose biosynthetic locus [6] and a number of CDSs
involved in metabolism and protective responses [12-17].
However, the ability to comprehensively identify ecologically
important sequences was limited in these previous studies by
the use of incomplete genome libraries and the lack of whole
genome sequences.
The genome sequence of a single isolate of P. fluorescens, Pf5, has been reported [18]. Although a large number of genes
involved in nutrient uptake/degradation and biocontrol were
identified in Pf-5, the true diversity within this species was

not revealed. To address this issue and to enhance our understanding of the functional ecology of P. fluorescens, we have
determined the complete nucleotide sequences of two strains
from different environmental origins.
SBW25 was isolated in 1989 from the leaf surface of a sugar
beet plant grown at the University Farm, Wytham, Oxford,
UK [19]. In addition to its use in the study of microbe-plantsoil interactions, SBW25 has become an important model
organism for studies on evolutionary processes (for example,
[20,21]). Pf0-1 was isolated in 1987 from loam soil in Sherborn, Massachusetts, USA [22].
Here we report the genome sequences of SBW25 and Pf0-1
and the results of a comparative analysis of P. fluorescens that
includes isolate Pf-5. Our data reveal hitherto unrecognized
diversity [23], with the three strains sharing only 61.4% of
genes. We also identify highly abundant families of repetitive
DNA sequences and describe more than 100 genes that show
elevated levels of expression in the plant environment. These
plant-induced genes provide a snapshot of how P. fluorescens
perceives and responds to the plant environment and reveals
conservation of strategies among strains for the enhancement
of ecological performance.

Results and discussion
P. fluorescens SBW25 and Pf0-1 genome architecture
The general features of the genomes of P. fluorescens SBW25
(6,722,539 bp) and Pf0-1 (6,438,405 bp) are summarized in
Table 1. SBW25 is predicted to encode 6,009 CDSs, with a
coding density of 88.3%. The genome of Pf0-1 has 5,741 CDSs
with a coding density of 90%. These findings compare to
6,144 CDSs predicted for Pf-5 (7,074,893 bp and 88.7% coding density) [18].

Alignments of the whole genome sequences of P. fluorescens
strains SBW25, Pf0-1, and Pf-5 revealed that the only longrange synteny among these genomes is confined to the origin
of replication, with a gradual deterioration in both synteny
and sequence conservation towards the replication terminus
(Figure 1). There is also evidence of extensive reciprocal
recombination around the terminus of replication, as commonly seen in other bacterial genomes [24] (Figure 1). Neither bacterium contains an accessory element (note that
plasmid pQBR103 for which the complete sequence was
recently reported [25] was acquired by SBW25 during a field
release experiment [26], but this plasmid is not present in the
originally isolated strain).

Intra- and inter-species variation among Pseudomonas
genomes
Reciprocal FASTA analysis was used to identify orthologous
gene sets shared among the three genomes. The distribution
of genes and orthologues among the three P. fluorescens
strains is non-random, with strain-unique genes being more
common towards the replication terminus (Figure 1). This
organization is similar to the accessory loci near the end of the
arms (termini) of the linear chromosome in Streptomyces
coelicolor A3(2), which are highly variable in both length and
composition [27]. Of the total coding capacity, genes conserved among all three P. fluorescens isolates comprise 3,642
CDSs, representing 59.3%, 60.6% and 63.4% of the coding
capacity in Pf-5, SBW25 and Pf0-1, respectively (Figure 2). A
large proportion of the P. fluorescens genes (from 1,111 to
1,490 CDSs (22% to 27% of total coding capacity)) are found
in just one genome (Figure 2). This finding contrasts with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where the five sequenced isolates
share a conserved core of 5,021 genes with only 1.4% (strain
C3719) to 8.2% (strain PA2192) of genes unique to any one
isolate [23]. It is possible that the overall low level of variation
among the sequenced P. aeruginosa isolates reflects a bias
created by restricting sampling solely to clinical isolates. If
true, then it may be that the highly variable genomes of P. fluorescens are more representative of the true diversity of the
Pseudomonas genus.

When the reciprocal FASTA analysis was extended to include
11 other sequenced Pseudomonas species the conserved gene
complement of these 14 Pseudomonas genomes was just
1,705 CDSs. This pseudomonad core gene-set falls below that
previously estimated for the gamma-proteobacteria as a
whole (2,049 CDSs [28]), underscoring the highly variable
nature of this genus. This is also highlighted in Figure 3,
which shows a majority rule consensus tree from the results
of individual maximum likelihood analyses of the 1,705 core
CDS amino acid datasets. The data strongly support the classification of P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. syringae isolates
into species groups, with at least 95% of the single gene trees
supporting the species distinction. In contrast, support for
the classification of the three P. fluorescens isolates as a single
species was relatively weak, supported by only 57% of single
gene trees. Support for the intra-group relationships are not
strong for any of the species examined and most likely reflects
recombination among strains of each species [29]. Indeed,
evidence of recombination in a number of different Pseudomonas species, including P. aeruginosa [30], and P. fluorescens [31] has been reported.
Average amino acid identities (AAIs) [32] were calculated
using the pair-wise orthologous sets of CDSs from the three P.
fluorescens strains as well as three P. aeruginosa strains and
three P. syringae pathovars (Figure 4; Table 2). It is evident
that the AAIs of the P. fluorescens strains are considerably
lower than those found in P. aeruginosa and P. syringae and
fall between the limits of genera and species as defined by
Konstantinidis and Tiedje [32]. In addition, while unique
sequences in each genome were excluded from AAI analyses,
the relatively low number of orthologous sequences within
the P. fluorescens genomes further calls the species grouping
of these strains into question. However, we note that the AAI
of orthologues located close to the replication origin ranges
from 84.6% to 85.6%, whereas the AAI range for orthologues
nearer the replication terminus is 75% to 77.5%: the genome
wide AAI ranges from 82.2% to 83.4%. These regional differences require consideration before using AAI to infer relatedness.

Based on the genomic criteria provided by Goris et al. [33] for
defining species, the three P. fluorescens strains could indeed
be different species. In fact, our analysis is in agreement with
previous studies that have shown - based on gyrB and rpoD
nucleotide sequences - P. fluorescens to be a complex composed of two major lineages [34], with Pf-5 and Pf0-1 belonging in the P. chlororaphis and SBW25 in the P. fluorescens
lineage. Similar conclusions have come from DNA-DNA
hybridization and average nucleotide identity scores [33] and
the genome signature (genome-specific relative frequencies
of dinucleotides) [35]. Given the small sample of genomes, it

seems premature to redefine the species 'P. fluorescens' at
this time. It should also be noted that our analysis shows the
three P. fluorescens strains to group more closely to each
other than to any other member of the Pseudomonas genus
(Figure 3; Table 2).

Functional analysis of the SBW25 gene complement
Analysis of the conserved genes present in the three P. fluorescens strains provides results that are typical of other soil
dwelling bacteria [36,37]. For example, SBW25 and Pf0-1
carry an abundance of regulatory genes (>300 each), and

genes encoding motility and chemotaxis-related functions
(>100 each) as well as genes specifying membrane and transport functions (>1,000 each).
Also typical for pseudomonads, the genomes of SBW25, Pf01 and Pf-5 lack 6-phosphofructokinase, required for conversion of β-D-fructose 6-phosphate to β-D-fructose 1,6bisphosphate (although the gene for 1-phosphofructokinase
is present) and these strains are therefore unlikely to carry
out glycolysis. Nonetheless, each genome possesses genes
predicted to specify the enzymes phosphogluconate dehydratase and 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate 6-phophate aldolase,
which are necessary for utilization of glucose via the phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway.
The extreme diversity evident in these three P. fluorescens
isolates - both in gene content and sequence conservation made a full metabolic reconstruction impractical in the context of P. fluorescens as a species. Such a reconstruction
requires a greater number of complete genome sequences and
an improved understanding of the nature of the P. fluorescens species. Instead, we focused on the direct identification
of genes associated with colonization and survival in the plant
environment using an IVET promoter-trapping strategy. This
approach is the first step in a functional test of the prediction
that the gene classes commonly associated with soil bacteria
(outlined above) are determinants of their ecological performance. Previous attempts have exploited the IVET promoter-trapping strategy to identify genes up-regulated in the
plant rhizosphere and soil environments [5-7]. While providing insight into a set of functionally significant genes, these
studies have been based on the screening of partial genomic
libraries and, therefore, the full spectrum of plant-soil-

induced genes has not been identified. In order to obtain a
comprehensive set of genes specifically active in the plant-soil
environment, a full genome survey of plant- and rhizosphereinduced genes (collectively referred to as environment inducible loci (EIL)) in SBW25 was undertaken using the IVET
strategy developed by Gal et al. [6]. This strategy selects EIL
on the basis of their ability to drive the expression of a promoterless copy of the reporter gene dapB ('dapB) - a gene
required for the biosynthesis of diaminopimelate (DAP),
which is an essential component of the peptidoglycan layer of
the bacterial cell wall. Active EIL fusions to 'dapB allow
growth by complementing a dapB deletion in the SBW25 host
strain used for these experiments. The distribution of EIL in
SBW25 is shown in Figure 5a, and putative Pf0-1 orthologues
are shown in Figure 5b. EIL classified by function, and putative orthologues in Pf0-1 and Pf-5, are given in Supplementary Table 1 in Additional data file 1.
EIL were identified by screening a library consisting of
33,000 clones (62 independent ligation reactions) and analyzed in pools of 250 on Beta vulgaris (sugar beet) seedlings.
Given a genome of 6.7 Mbp, a random library of 3 to 5 kb fragments, and assuming 3,000 promoters in the SBW25
genome, then the chance of a promoter not being included in
this study is less than 0.01 (based on the Poisson distribution).
The plant-inducibility of the EIL-'dapB fusion strains recovered by IVET selection was verified for each of the 125 IVET
fusion strains by their inability to grow on M9 (glucose) minimal medium in the absence of DAP (thus demonstrating that
the fusions are transcriptionally silent in vitro). The ability of
each fusion strain to colonize both the rhizosphere and the
phyllosphere of non-sterile sugar beet seedlings was then rechecked (strains colonizing these environments contain
fusions to genes that are transcriptionally activated in the
plant environment) [6,11]. SBW25ΔdapB and an IVET negative-control strain, PBR393 [38], were used as controls and
no colony forming units of either strain were recovered from
either the rhizosphere or phyllosphere. Every putative
SBW25ΔdapB strain carrying an EIL-'dapB fusion grew in
the rhizosphere (the size of the initial inoculum more than tripled in the rhizosphere over the course of 3 weeks); 90 of
these IVET fusion strains were also able to grow in the phyllosphere (cells recovered from the phyllosphere underwent at
least 3 doublings in 3 weeks). Growth of all EIL-fusion strains
was significantly impaired in M9 (glucose) minimal medium.
These tests verify that the EIL fusions are expressed by
SBW25 on plant surfaces, and that the EIL promoters are
dependent on the plant environment for expression. Further
studies to determine the precise function of individual EIL in
the plant environment are on going.
The 125 genes shown to be specifically up-regulated in planta
represent all major classes of genes found in SBW25: Pf0-1
and Pf-5 each have orthologues of 83 of the 125 IVET-identi-

fied genes. Of these, 73 genes are common to all three P. fluorescens strains (Supplementary Table 1 in Additional data file
1). These data confirm the importance of previously recognized activities [6], and those predicted from genome
sequence analysis, including nutrient acquisition and scavenging, cell envelope function, metabolism, stress response,
and detoxification. Interestingly, when compared with the
results of a previously conducted (small scale) study using the
DAP-based IVET strategy [6], only 4 of the 25 EIL recovered
in that study were identified here. These included the cellulose biosynthetic locus wss (recovered on six independent
occasions in this study), fliF, glcA and fadE (Supplementary
Table 1 in Additional data file 1). The reasons for the relatively
low overlap between the two studies is unclear, but perhaps
reflects subtle differences in conditions for plant propagation,
although the differences are more likely to reflect the particularly stringent criteria applied in this study in order for a
putative plant-induced locus to qualify as an EIL. Nonethe-

less, of importance is the fact that genes of the same functional classes were obtained in both screens.
No validated 'dapB IVET fusions were obtained for genes
within the Rsp type III secretion system, which was previously identified by a different (pantothenate-based) IVET
selection strategy [5]. Its low level of expression in the rhizosphere [11] is likely to be insufficient to restore competitive
growth in the DAP-based promoter trapping strategy used in
this study.
Regulators form a large class of EIL: the 17 predicted regulatory components include a sigma factor, LysR-type regulators, two component sensing systems, a di-guanylate cyclase,
and a phosphodiesterase. Also included in this collection is an
operon defined by EIL037 (PFLU1114-1111) whose four CDSs
show remarkable complexity: a compound GGDEF/EAL/
CheY protein (PFLU1114), followed by a predicted cytochrome C551 peroxidase precursor (PFLU1113), followed by

That this and other regulatory loci are actively transcribed
outside of the laboratory environment supports the generally
held assumption that the abundance of regulatory genes in
Pseudomonas is important for life in complex environments
[39].
Another notable 'dapB IVET fusion is EIL082, which falls
within a previously unrecognized non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) biosynthetic gene cluster (PFLU3215 to
PFLU3228) present in the non-core region of SBW25. The
non-ribosomal peptide produced by this enzyme complex is
specific to SBW25, because no orthologues of these NRPS
genes exist in Pf0-1 or Pf-5. Interestingly, Pf0-1 also possesses
a novel NRPS gene cluster (Pfl01_2265-2267) not present in

SBW25 or Pf-5. There are three NRPS biosynthetic clusters in
SBW25, four in Pf0-1 and three in Pf-5, including the pyoverdine biosynthesis cluster. The similarity shared amongst
these clusters is limited to conservation of the functional
domains, with no full length identities. There is little conservation of the order of the functional domains. The production
of pyoverdine is one of the defining characteristics for P. fluorescens and yet the genome has shown great diversity both
in the pyoverdine clusters and in the other non-ribosomal
peptides that are made by P. fluorescens.
Genes with no significant matches to DNA or protein
sequences in public databases comprise approximately 10%
of the IVET fusions. On the basis of in silico analyses, the
majority of these genes are predicted to encode membrane-

conserved, while individual strains appear to possess accessory traits that are likely to confer niche-specificity.

A large class of EIL are fusions of non-predicted genes, oriented in the opposite direction to transcription of predicted
CDSs (40 in total; see class XI, Supplementary Table 1 in
Additional data file 1). 'Antisense' fusions of this type have
been described previously [5,40]. It is possible that some of
these fusions highlight in silico gene prediction errors; however, careful examination of these fusions renders this
unlikely. Moreover, in a previous study both the sense CDS
and antisense IVET fusion were found to encode proteins;
furthermore, the IVET-identified 'antisense' gene was shown
to be important for efficient colonization of soil [41]. We
refrain from further speculation as to the significance of these
'antisense' fusions, but such a substantial number suggests
there is much yet to learn about the potential role of these
genes in the function of bacteria in their natural environments.

Repeat families

Despite evidence for a highly variable accessory region
towards the terminus of replication, the distribution of EIL in
SBW25 appears to have little or no bias toward any particular
genomic location (Figure 5a, b). The 31 genes defined by
EIL055 to EIL096 are within the variable region (see below)
of the SBW25 genome while the remainder are within the core
region. This even distribution indicates that many of the
mechanisms favoring success in natural environments are

Whole genome alignments of SBW25, Pf0-1, and Pf-5 showed
evidence for extensive within-genome recombination. In
many bacteria this is driven by recombination between repeat
sequences. However, in none of the P. fluorescens genome
rearrangements were the recombined sequences flanked by
rRNAs, tRNAs or known insertion sequence elements. To
identify repetitive DNA sequences that may explain this
intragenomic recombination, an exhaustive search for such
sequences in SBW25, Pf0-1, and Pf-5 was performed.
Analysis of SBW25 revealed the presence of 4,357 repeat
sequences representing 11.91% of the genome. These repetitive sequences ranged in size from 24 to 357 bps and comprised 1,199 intergenic repeats, 922 inverted repeats (IR1_g),
and 2,236 intragenic repeats. This type of repeat expansion
has been seen in other systems, where it is associated with a
relaxation of selection on the genome. This can be associated
with a recent change in niche, and the resulting evolutionary
bottleneck [42,43], or with reduced selection because of small
effective population size and absence of recombination [44].
However, as discussed below, this is not thought to apply
here. The intragenic repeat families represent coding
sequences for conserved protein domains within over-represented protein families; 1,293 represented just 4 protein
domain families (as defined by Pfam; see Materials and meth-

ods) - ABC transporter, AMP-binding enzyme, response regulator receiver domain and the GGDEF domain.
The P. fluorescens intergenic repeat elements comprised 12
families on the basis of sequence conservation (Supplementary Figure 1 in Additional data file 2). An analysis of their distribution and frequency (Table 3) within and between
genomes shows examples of both strain-specific and speciesspecific families. The repeat families R0 and R2 are represented more than 500 times in SBW25, but are either absent
or rarely present in Pf0-1 or Pf-5. Conversely, repeat family R1
is abundant in Pf-5, but rarely present in Pf0-1 and absent
from SBW25; repeat family R6 is present in Pf0-1 and absent
from the genomes of the other two strains.

Structural organization of the P. fluorescens intergenic
repeats
Detailed analysis of the repeat sequences revealed that five
families possess a complex structure consisting of two identical inverted repeats (IRs) that flank a variable size core region
(Table 3). The IRs generally show a higher average G+C content than the genome as a whole (64.7%; the genome average
is 60.5%), while the G+C% content of the variable core region
sequences is closer to the genome average. Structural predictions made with these repeat sequences show that they readily form hairpin secondary structures, with the IRs forming
the stem and the variable core region forming the loop.
Three repeat families, R0, R2 and IR1_g, are of particular
interest given their disproportionately high numbers in
SBW25 relative to Pf0-1 and Pf-5 (Table 3). The IRs of R0 and
R2 are identical to those found flanking two different insertion sequence elements unique to strain SBW25 at locations
50373465038275 (PFLU4572A) and 63871926388340
(PFLU5832), respectively. It is possible that the IRs of repeat
families R0 and R2 are recognized by the two insertion
sequence element-encoded transposases in trans, which
might explain why the elements have become over-represented in the SBW25 genome. If this is true, then these
repeats are likely to represent miniature inverted-repeat
transposable elements (MITEs), only very few of which have
been reported in bacteria [45].
In addition to the ability to form stem-loop structures, the
IR1_g repeats also possess the consensus sequence for the
repetitive extragenic palindromic repeats (REP) family,
which were originally thought to be specific to P. putida
KT2440. The functional significance of the Pseudomonas
REPs awaits elucidation, but they may play a role in transcription termination or provide binding sites for the DNA
gyrase [46].
Since many of these repeat families can form stem-loop structures, they have the potential to act as transcriptional terminators. We therefore examined the transcription orientation
of the genes flanking repeat elements to look for bias. In

Volume 10, Issue 5, Article R51

Silby et al. R51.11

describing this analysis we use 'Head' to refer to the 5' end of
a CDS and 'Tail' to refer to the 3' end. Using this nomenclature
there are four transcriptional orientation states (including
CDSs on both the forward and reverse DNA strands) for the
CDSs that lie on either side of a repeat element: Tail-repeatHead (forward strand) (→ →), Tail-repeat-Tail (→ ←), Tailrepeat-Head (reverse strand) (← ←) and Head-repeat-Head
(← →). We compared the frequency of each of the four states
with all CDS pairs that lacked an intervening repeat element.
The frequency of the four orientation states among CDS pairs
that flank repeat elements was significantly different from
that of CDS pairs that do not (SBW25, P < 0.0005; Pf0-1, P =
0.016; Pf-5, P < 0.0005). For those CDS pairs that do not
flank repeat elements the Tail-Head (forward and reverse
strand) orientation is predominant; for CDS pairs flanking
repeats the most frequent orientation is the Tail-repeat-Tail
(Supplementary Figure 2 in Additional data file 2). The Tailrepeat-Tail bias is prevalent for the largest three of the six
intergenic repeat families present in SBW25 and for five of
the nine repeat families in Pf0-1 (Supplementary Figure 3 in
Additional data file 2). The selective pressure for the non-random distribution of repeats may derive from the predicted
stem-loop (transcription terminator-like) structure; insertion
of a repeat with a stem-loop structure between Tail-Head oriented CDSs within an operon would cause termination, thus
disrupting these transcriptional units. The Tail-repeat-Tail
biased distribution of these repeats probably reflects a 'least
worst' location as insertion is less likely to cause aberrant
transcription termination since termination of convergent
transcription is likely to occur anyway. In addition, the Headrepeat-Head state, which could potentially disrupt promoters
for one or both genes, occurs at a low frequency, particularly
in SBW25 and Pf-5. These data would also suggest that the
expansion of the intergenic repeats has been subject to selection. Consequently, it is unlikely that the repeat expansion
seen in P. fluorescens results from the organism having been
through an evolutionary bottleneck (this scenario is generally
associated with random distribution of repetitive sequences)
[43] and more likely that it is linked to a lack of selection
against increased genome size.

P. fluorescens repeat deserts
Evident from the genome analysis are large regions of the
SBW25 genome that lack any complex repeat families (Rfamily repeats; Table 3). We refer to these as repeat deserts
(ReDs; Figure 5a). The SBW25 genome harbors 60 ReDs,
which range in size from an arbitrary lower limit of 15.8 kb up
to 176 kb and encode a total of 2,475 CDSs (40% of the coding
capacity), of which 93.7% are unique to SBW25 compared to
Pf0-1 and Pf-5 (Supplementary Table 2 in Additional data file
3). Because of the density of repeats in SBW25, the identification of ReDs was straightforward. In contrast, the lower
number of repeats in Pf0-1 and Pf-5 makes definition of similar regions more difficult.

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R51

Genome Biology 2009,

Two, not mutually exclusive, explanations for the lack of
repeats in these regions exist: first, the ReDs comprise mostly
essential genes that normally experience high purifying selection [47,48]; and second, the ReDs might have been recently
acquired from a donor lacking repeat sequences. Indeed,
examples of the former include the rRNA clusters, the ribosomal proteins cluster, the wss cluster (PFLU0300 to
PFLU0309), which directs production of an acetylated cellulose-like polymer involved in formation of a microbial mat
[49,50], and cell division proteins (PFLU0940 to PFLU0953,
amongst others).
Recently acquired ReDs that have different dinucleotide frequencies to the above group contain CDS clusters that might
confer niche specificity. One such example is the anthranilate
synthase cluster (PFLU1381 to PFLU1386), which is unique
to SBW25. Other examples found within ReDs include 'atypical' regions of the SBW25 genome, which show limited phylogenetic distribution, aberrant G+C% content or dinucleotide
frequency compared with the genome average for Pseudomonas species (Supplementary Table 3 in Additional data
file 3). These may reflect sequences acquired through recent
gene transfer events [51]. While ReDs are not evident in Pf01, several such atypical regions have been identified (Supplementary Table 4 in Additional data file 3), and these are also
free of repeats, as are all but one of the mobile genetic elements recently described in Pf-5 [52]. For example, SBW25
and Pf0-1 each carry multiple prophage-like elements, and
both genomes have one probable integrative conjugative element (ICE)-like genomic island, SBW_GI-1 and the related
island Pf0-1_GI-1, which have similarity to the genomic
island PFGI-2 in Pf-5 [52]. SBW_GI-1 is located between partially duplicated tRNAval and is over 101 kb in length.
Strengthening the possibility that this region is a hotspot for
insertions, comparison of approximately 5 kb of unpublished
sequences flanking the mupirocin biosynthetic cluster of P.
fluorescens NCIMB10586 [53], which based on DNA
sequence identity (generally 93% to 96%) and synteny is more
closely related to SBW25 than Pf0-1 or Pf-5, indicates that the
mup cluster is inserted adjacent to the same tRNAval tRNAasp
tandem cluster as SBW_GI-1. Pf0-1_GI-1 defines a slightly
smaller locus than SBW_GI-1 and lacks flanking insertion
site duplications. These islands are related in structure to a
family of ICEs, which include those found in other pseudomonads [54,55] as well as wider members of the gammaproteobacteria such as Yersinia (YAPI [56,57]) and Salmonella (SPI-7 [58]). These elements are defined as having a
conserved core carrying a type IV pilus operon and plasmidrelated functions as well as a highly variable region, which
carries genes involved in resistance and host adaptation. The
reduction of the type IV pilus genes, and breakdown of the
flanking regions in Pf0-1_GI-1, suggest these ICEs may be
undergoing fixation in the genome, perhaps attributable to an
important function of the cargo genes. The variable cargo
regions of SBW_GI-1 and Pf0-1_GI-1 are summarized in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 in Additional data file 3.

Conclusions

P. fluorescens is an opportunistic species long recognized for
its genetic, physiological and functional diversity [59]. The
previously sequenced genome of isolate Pf-5 offered a
glimpse of genome content and organization, but in the
absence of comparative data sheds little insight into the
extent of genomic diversity. The genome sequences of the two
additional strains (SBW25 and Pf0-1) have provided the
opportunity for comparative studies and show an unexpectedly high degree of among-genotype diversity. Typically, different isolates of the same species would be expected to show
substantial overlap among core genes of the genome. For
example, five sequenced genomes of P. aeruginosa share
80% to 90% of their gene content [23], whereas the three P.
fluorescens genomes share just 61% of their genes, and have
low average nucleotide identity [33] and AAI (this study),
leading Goris et al. to suggest that these three isolates cannot
be members of the same species. With further genome
sequences, it will become possible to strengthen the species
criteria using whole genome characteristics. The fact that
these three strains group more closely to each other than to
other members of the genus makes it tempting to describe P.
fluorescens strains as members of a complex until more DNA
sequence analyses provide a deeper understanding of the
genetic structure of these populations.
The ecological significance of the genes specific to each strain
also awaits further study, but the IVET-based analysis shows
that at least some of the SBW25 genes are likely to be important in the plant environment. The fact that EIL fusions identify both core and accessory genes as ecologically relevant
comes as little surprise given both the diverse range of core
metabolic functions and the diversity of niches within which
P. fluorescens exists. That a subset of the IVET-identified
genes corresponds to orthologues in Pf0-1 and Pf-5 indicates
conserved strategies for ecological success, and also the diversity of mechanisms employed.
The lack of synteny among the three strains marks a further
defining feature of the species P. fluorescens. Previous studies of this species using restriction fragment length polymorphism showed a bewildering range of patterns - even amongst
strains that were phenotypically indistinguishable [60]. The
presence of numerous repeat sequences, particularly the
intergenic MITE-like elements, provides a probable explanation. While the evolutionary origin of these elements is
unclear, one likely consequence of the presence of numerous
repeated sequences (between genes) is elevated levels of
intragenic recombination. Although recombination between
repeat sequences is to be expected, it seems that P. fluorescens can tolerate significant rearrangements without sacrificing performance. One striking example in SBW25 comes from
the arrangement of genes involved in pyoverdine biosynthesis. In SBW25 these genes are distributed across seven different regions of the genome [17]; in Pf-5 and Pf0-1 (with fewer
MITE-like elements) these genes are distributed across three

were necessary to close gaps and to raise the quality of the finished sequence. All general aspects of library construction,
sequencing and gene prediction performed at the Joint
Genome Institute were as previously described [64].

Whole genome sequencing - particularly when combined
with functional studies such as IVET - provides unprecedented insight into the functional activity of microbes.
Despite their environmental significance, common saprophytic bacteria, such as P. fluorescens, have been the subject
of relatively few genome-based projects. The addition of
SBW25 and Pf0-1 to the list of genome-sequenced saprophytes is an important advance. It reveals the gene content of
soil/plant saprophytes and shows that our prior appreciation
of the diversity of the Pseudomonas pan genome was
restricted. Since many isolates pathogenic to humans, animals, and plants are thought to have their origins in nonpathogenic environmental isolates, understanding the
genomes of these saprophytes has implications for our ability
to predict, monitor and understand the evolution of these
pathogenic strains.

The sequences of SBW25 and Pf0-1 can be accessed using the
[Genaccession
numbers
[EMBL:AM181176] and
Bank:CP000094], respectively.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and sequencing
P. fluorescens strain SBW25 is an environmental isolate
taken from the leaf surfaces of a sugar beet plant. A single colony of SBW25 was grown on LB agar and then grown overnight in LB broth with shaking at 28°C. Cells were collected
and total DNA was extracted with a Gentra Puregene extraction kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA was fragmented by sonication,
and several libraries were generated in plasmid vectors using
size fractions ranging from 2 to 9 kb. The whole genome was
sequenced to a depth of 9× coverage from 2 to 3 kb, 3 to 4 kb
and 6 to 9 kb in pOTW12 and pMAQ1Sac_BstXI libraries
using dye terminator chemistry on ABI3730 automated
sequencers. End sequences from larger insert bacterial artificial chromosome (pBACehr 5 to 15 kb insert size) libraries
were used as a scaffold. The sequence was assembled, finished and annotated as described previously [62], using the
program Artemis [63] to collate data and facilitate annotation.
P. fluorescens strain Pf0-1 was isolated from bulk loam soil. It
was grown overnight in LB broth with shaking at 30°C. Total
DNA was extracted using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The genome of Pf0-1
was sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute using a combination of 3.7, 9.4, and 37 kb DNA libraries. Draft assemblies
were based on 114,960 total sequence reads. All three libraries provided 5× coverage of the genome. A total of 470 additional reactions, 3 shatter libraries from PCR products, and
20 transposon bombs (in vitro transposon mutagenesis
(EZ::TN<kan2>Insertion Kit; Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA)
of plasmids to generate new primer sites for DNA sequencing)

Bioinformatic analyses
The genome sequences of P. fluorescens strains SBW25, Pf01 and Pf-5 were compared pairwise using TBLASTX analyses
loaded on the Artemis Comparison Tool [65].
Orthologous CDSs in the three genomes were defined after
comparing all-against-all running a reciprocal FASTA search
of translated DNA with a 30% identity over 80% of the length
of the CDSs as minimum similarity score. The results were
used to calculate the average amino acid identities.
Pseudogenes were defined as CDSs that had one or more
mutations that would ablate expression and/or lack start
and/or stop codon; each of these possible inactivating mutations was subsequently checked against the original sequencing data.
Circular diagrams were plotted using DNAplotter [66].

Identification and analysis of orthologues in Pseudomonas genomes
Fourteen Pseudomonas species (P. fluorescens SBW25, Pf01, and Pf-5;P. aeruginosa PAO1, PA14 and PA7; P. syringae
pv. syringae B728a, pv. phaseolicola 1448A and pv. tomato
DC3000; P. putida strains KT2440, W619, F1, and GB1; and
P. stutzeri A1501) were compared all-against-all using a
reciprocal FASTA approach (30% identity over 80% of the
length as minimum similarity), yielding a set of 1,705 core
genes shared between all these genomes. In a second step, the
amino acid sequences of these core gene products were
aligned (gene-wise) using MUSCLE version 3.52 [67] and
poorly aligned regions were removed with Gblocks [68]. Maximum likelihood analysis of each alignment was carried out in
RAxML version 7.0.0 [69] using the JTT+gamma model. A
majority rule consensus of the 1,705 individual trees was built
using the consense module of Phylip to assess the agreement
between the individual trees.

Identification and analysis of repetitive sequences in P.
fluorescens
In order to analyze the repeat elements and their distribution
in the genome of SBW25, we firstly concatenated three P. fluorescens genomic sequences (SBW25, Pf0-1 and Pf-5). Running the Repeatscout [70] algorithm on the concatenated
sequence yielded 122 repeat families, of which 103 include
intragenic repeats, mostly Pfam domains, and 19 intergenic
repeat families. For each of the 122 families we built a multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTAL [71] and manually

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R51

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/5/R51

Genome Biology 2009,

curated the alignments using JalView [72]. Using each of the
multiple alignments obtained, we built a profile hidden
Markov model (HMM) using the HMMER package version
1.8.4. The 122 HMMs were searched against the concatenated
sequence (leading and lagging strand). HMMs can be trained
on a dataset of sequences and can predict, in a probabilistic
framework, more distant members of this sequence family.
The results obtained were manually curated to infer the
number of distinct repeat families. The consensus of the
intergenic repeat families and their HMM logos are provided
in Supplementary Figure 1 in Additional data file 2. The HMM
logos where produced using the LogoMat-M application [73].
Intergenic repeat families were initially predicted using the
default parameters of RepeatScout: minimum number of
copies per repeat family, 20; minimum repeat length, 50 bp;
low complexity repeats were filtered out prior to the repeat
prediction. In a second step, the predicted repeats were manually curated and very similar repeat families were merged
under the same family, where possible. A multiple sequence
alignment for each repeat family was used to train HMMs
specific for each family. Each query genome was searched
against those HMMs, using the HMMER package. Once the
repeat families were built, using the HMM-based approach,
the structure of each family was determined with visual
inspection of the multiple sequence alignment; in case of
complex repeat structure, with IRs being part of a repeat family, new HMMs were built to model the IRs of each family (if
applicable) and used to search the three query genomes.

Atypical regions
A computer-based search through the SBW25 and Pf0-1
genomes using the Alien Hunter program [74] resulted in
identification of several regions within these genomes that
were termed 'atypical' due to differences in nucleotide features such as G+C% and dinucleotide frequency. A manual
curation of the results is shown in Figure 5, and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 in Additional data file 3.

In vivo expression technology
Identification of EIL from SBW25 was based on the IVET
strategy as described previously [5,6]. Libraries were constructed in pIVETD by cloning partial Sau3AI digested
genomic DNA. Libraries were maintained in Escherichia coli
and moved into P. fluorescens SBW25ΔdapB by conjugation.
Library screening took place on non-sterile sugar beet seedlings maintained in non-sterile vermiculite pots [5]. Fusions
were recovered after 3 weeks of selection (rather than the 2
weeks used previously [6]) by plating homogenized plant
material on selective plates. Integrated genomic fusions from
strains recovered from the plant environment were mobilized
into E. coli by conjugative cloning [75]. The identity of recovered fusions was determined by sequencing inserts from
recovered plasmids (see [5,6] for details).
