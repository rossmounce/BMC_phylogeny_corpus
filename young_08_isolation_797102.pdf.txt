Abstract
Background: African trypanosomes (including Trypanosoma brucei) are unicellular parasites which
multiply in the mammalian bloodstream. T. brucei has about twenty telomeric bloodstream form Variant
Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) expression sites (BESs), of which one is expressed at a time in a mutually
exclusive fashion. BESs are polycistronic transcription units, containing a variety of families of expression
site associated genes (ESAGs) in addition to the telomeric VSG. These polymorphic ESAG families are
thought to play a role in parasite-host adaptation, and it has been proposed that ESAG diversity might be
related to host range. Analysis of the genetic diversity of these telomeric gene families has been
confounded by the underrepresentation of telomeric sequences in standard libraries. We have previously
developed a method to selectively isolate sets of trypanosome BES containing telomeres using
Transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning in yeast.
Results: Here we describe the isolation of repertoires of BES containing telomeres from three
trypanosome subspecies: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense DAL 972 (causative agent of West-African
trypanosomiasis), T. b. brucei EATRO 2340 (a nonhuman infective strain) and T. equiperdum STIB 818
(which causes a sexually transmitted disease in equines). We have sequenced and analysed the genetic
diversity at four BES loci (BES promoter region, ESAG6, ESAG5 and ESAG2) from these three trypanosome
BES repertoires.
Conclusion: With the exception of ESAG2, the BES sequence repertoires derived from T. b. gambiense
are both less diverse than and nearly reciprocally monophyletic relative to those from T. b. brucei and T.
equiperdum. Furthermore, although we find evidence for adaptive evolution in all three ESAG repertoires
in T. b. brucei and T. equiperdum, only ESAG2 appears to be under diversifying selection in T. b. gambiense.
This low level of variation in the T. b. gambiense BES sequence repertoires is consistent both with the
relatively narrow host range of this subspecies and its apparent long-term clonality. However, our data
does not show a clear correlation between size of trypanosome host range and either number of BESs or
extent of ESAG genetic diversity.

Background
Telomeres are preferred genomic locations for gene families involved in virulence and pathogenicity in a wide
range of microbial pathogens including many unicellular
eukaryotic parasites [1,2]. High rates of recombination at
telomeres presumably facilitate the generation of genetic
diversity [3], as has been postulated for the malaria parasite Plasmodium, where antigenically variable VAR genes
are located predominantly at chromosome ends [4,5]. The
prokaryote Borrelia hermsii, causative agent of relapsing
fever, also has large numbers of variable antigen genes
located on linear plasmids which can undergo gene conversion events allowing antigenic variation [6]. Lastly,
African trypanosomes have segregated large gene families
involved in antigenic variation or host adaptation to the
telomeres of a broad range of chromosomes [1,7].
The African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei causes African Sleeping Sickness in humans, which is transmitted by
tsetse flies and is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa [8]. West
African trypanosomiasis, comprising more than 90% of
human cases, is the chronic form of the disease and is
caused by T. b. gambiense [9]. In contrast, East African
trypanosomiasis is an acute infection in humans caused
by T. b. rhodesiense, with death occurring typically within
6–8 months in the absence of treatment [8]. T. b. rhodesiense is considered to be a zoonotic pathogen with a very
extensive animal reservoir including a wide range of large
game animals [10], while T. b. gambiense infects a more
restricted range of reservoir hosts [11]. African trypanosomes also cause debilitating disease in livestock. T. b. brucei infects a variety of livestock and wildlife species, but is
not human infective. Genetically, T. b. brucei is extremely
similar to T. b. rhodesiense, but lacks the serum resistance
associated gene SRA conferring human serum resistance
[12,13]. Another non-human trypanosomiasis is dourine
in equines, which is caused by T. equiperdum. This
trypanosome, is also closely related to T. brucei [14], but
has lost the ability to cycle through tsetse flies and instead
is sexually transmitted [15]. T. equiperdum therefore has a
much more restricted host range than other vector born
Trypanosoma species.
Many subspecies of trypanosomes can multiply extracellularly in the mammalian bloodstream, where they are
exposed to continuous attack both by antibodies and
complement. Key to survival is a dense protective coat of
Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) [16], which is essential for the bloodstream form trypanosome even in vitro
[17]. As trypanosomes can switch between expression of
different VSGs, new trypanosome antigenic types can
escape host antibodies raised against the old VSG, and can
avoid eradication by antibody-mediated lysis allowing a
chronic infection to be maintained [18-20]. Although a
single trypanosome has up to 1500 VSG genes and pseu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/385

dogenes [21,22], only one VSG is expressed at a time from
one of about twenty bloodstream form VSG expression
sites (BESs) [23,24].
BESs are polycistronic transcription units located at telomeres, which contain a variety of Expression Site Associated Gene (ESAG) families in addition to the telomeric
VSG [25,26]. It has been hypothesised that some ESAGs
encode surface proteins or receptors which play a role in
adaptation of the trypanosome to life in different species
of mammalian host [27,28]. For example, ESAG6 and
ESAG7 encode polymorphic subunits of a trypanosome
encoded receptor for host transferrin, the variable nature
of which could affect the ability of the trypanosome to
take up transferrin molecules from different species of
mammalian host [27,29]. In addition, it has been shown
that the SRA gene located within some BESs confers resistance to human serum [30]. As the trypanosome switches
between different BESs, it expresses different permutations and combinations of polymorphic ESAGs
[27,28,31]. The telomeric location of VSG expression sites
could play a role in their control [1,7]. Additionally, high
rates of recombination at telomere ends could play a role
in generating genetic diversity, as has been proposed for
variant antigen genes located at the telomeres of the
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum [2,4].
Although a number of BESs from T. b. brucei and T. b.
rhodesiense have been sequenced [25,26,30,32], relatively
little is known about BESs in T. brucei gambiense, although
they are clearly very similar to those from T. b. brucei [33].
We are interested in the genetic diversity of telomeric
BESs, particularly with regards to whether BES repertoires
derived from trypanosomes with a large host range show
evidence for greater genetic diversity compared with BES
repertoires isolated from trypanosomes which infect a
more restricted number of mammalian species. As telomeric regions are notoriously difficult to isolate and characterise, and are typically very underrepresented in standard
libraries, we previously developed a method to isolate
entire repertoires of BES containing telomeres in yeast
[34]. Here, we present the isolation and analysis of the
genetic diversity found within repertoires of BES containing telomeres from three different species or subspecies of
trypanosomes.

Results and Discussion
Isolation of BES containing telomere libraries from three
trypanosomatids
We cloned repertoires of BES containing telomeres from
three trypanosome subspecies: T. b. gambiense DAL 972
(genome strain currently being sequenced by the Sanger
Research Institute), T. b. brucei EATRO 2340 and T.
equiperdum STIB 818. T. b. brucei EATRO 2340 was originally thought to be a T. b. rhodesiense subspecies [35].

However, as we did not find evidence for the presence of
SRA which is considered diagnostic for T. b. rhodesiense
[12,13], this strain was tentatively redesignated to be a T.
b. brucei (see Additional file 1 and Materials). The BES
containing telomeres were isolated in yeast using a
method relying on Transformation Associated Recombination (TAR) cloning [34,36]. Linearised yeast TAR vector
pEB4, containing a BES promoter fragment and a yeast telomere, was cotransformed into yeast spheroplasts
together with total trypanosome genomic DNA (Fig. 1).
Recombination between the BES promoter within the vector and similar sequences within the trypanosome
genomic DNA provides the yeast vector with a second
(trypanosome derived) telomere, thereby stabilising the
episome as a YAC (yeast artificial chromosome).
As BES sequences are polymorphic, we typed the different
BES TAR clones into different BES sets based on the promoter and ESAG6 sequence types as previously described
for T. b. brucei 427 [34]. For the BES promoter sequence
typing, an approximately 635 bp region immediately
downstream of the BES promoter (not overlapping with
the target fragment used for the TAR cloning) was amplified from each TAR clone and sequenced (See Additional

file 2 for BES promoter sequence alignment). For the
ESAG6 sequence typing an approximately 760 bp region
spanning the ESAG6 hypervariable region was amplified
and sequenced from each TAR clone (see Additional file 3
for ESAG6 sequence alignments). The presence of
sequence polymorphisms within these different BES
regions allowed the typing of the different TAR clones into
different BES sets.
A total of 204 T. b. gambiense TAR clones were sorted into
13 putative BES sets (Table 1), 208 T. b. brucei clones were
sorted into 23 BES sets (Table 2) and 91 T. equiperdum
clones were sorted into 16 BES sets (Table 3). Two TAR
clones were chosen for each BES type and the full length
ESAG6, ESAG5 and ESAG2 open reading frames were isolated and sequenced from both of these TAR clones (one
representative clone is listed in each Table). These ESAGs
were chosen for further analysis as they are similar enough
between different BESs to allow PCR amplification and
sequencing directly from the yeast TAR clones.
We have previously isolated a repertoire of 17 BES types
from T. b. brucei 427 from a total of 182 TAR clones [34].
This resulted in us cloning all ten BESs known to be func-

Overview of T. b. gambiense DAL 972 TAR clone library. A total of 204 T. b. gambiense TAR clones were isolated in yeast and typed into 13 different
BES sets after sequencing over the promoter and ESAG6 regions. The different BES promoter and ESAG6 sequence types (either at the DNA or
protein level) are indicated with numbers. Two TAR clones were chosen from each BES type (the name of one representative clone is indicated in
the chart), and the full length ESAG6, ESAG5 and ESAG2 ORFs were isolated and sequenced from both of these two clones. The sequence types of
the ESAG5 and ESAG2 are indicated.

tionally active in vitro in T. b. brucei 427 in our laboratory
[37]. Given the number of TAR clones analysed here (204
for T. b. gambiense and 208 for T. b. brucei EATRO 2340)
it is likely that we have isolated complete or nearly complete BES sets from these two trypanosome subspecies.
BES repertoire size and diversity
The overall nucleotide diversity of each repertoire, summarized in Table 4, shows both the percentage of nucleotides in different loci that are polymorphic (% S) as well
as the mean pairwise diversity (π). Similar measures of
amino acid diversity are summarized in Table 5. Two patterns are apparent: First, in general the nucleotide and
amino acid diversity of each BES locus repertoire is greatest in T. b. brucei, intermediate in T. equiperdum, and least
in T. b. gambiense. Since this is true of both measures of
diversity, these observations cannot be explained by the
presence of a few exceptionally divergent sequences or a
few exceptionally polymorphic sites in the T. b. brucei repertoires. Rather, there are broad-based, sequence-wide differences in the diversity of these repertoires. Second,
despite having a smaller number of sequence types identified, the ESAG2 repertoire in each subspecies is more
polymorphic than the repertoires of either the BES promoter region, ESAG6 or ESAG5.

Sequence repertoires of loci from T. b. gambiense were consistently the least genetically diverse. In T. b. brucei the

transferrin receptor subunit ESAG6 has been shown to be
particularly polymorphic over a hypervariable domain, as
well as over a domain implicated in binding polymorphic
host transferrins [38-40]. It has been proposed that
ESAG6 sequence polymorphisms allow the trypanosome
to express receptors with differing affinities for the polymorphic transferrin molecules from different species of
mammalian host [27,28]. Sequence alignment of these
polymorphic regions of ESAG6 shows that ESAG6
sequences from T. b. brucei EATRO 2340 have comparable
levels of amino acid diversity to that found in other T. brucei species [40] (Fig. 2). However, as shown previously,
ESAG6 sequences from T. equiperdum, while diverse in the
ESAG6 hypervariable region, have little amino acid diversity within the transferrin binding region (Fig. 2)[40,41].
Here, we show that there is very little amino acid diversity
in ESAG6 in T. b. gambiense DAL 972, even over these normally quite polymorphic stretches of the protein (Fig. 2).
Surprisingly, six out of the seven T. b. gambiense ESAG6
protein types identified were identical over this polymorphic stretch.
Phylogenetic analyses of BES sequence families
Phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) show that the
relationships between the BES repertoires in the different
trypanosome subspecies differ between loci. Within the
BES promoter region, as well as at ESAG6 and ESAG5,
most of the sequences obtained from T. b. gambiense

Overview of T. b. brucei EATRO 2340 TAR clone library. A total of 208 TAR clones were isolated and typed into 23 different BES sets. The
sequence typing proceeded further as described for Table 1. As before, two TAR clones were chosen for each BES type (the name of one clone is
indicated in the chart), and the full length ESAG6, ESAG5 and ESAG2 ORFs were isolated and sequenced from both of these two clones.

fTwo ESAG6 in one BES, both assembled.

belong to nearly monophyletic groups (gambiense-like)
with little nucleotide or amino acid diversity. Nonetheless, at each locus, reciprocal monophyly between the T.
b. gambiense repertoire and homologous sequences in the
other two subspecies is violated, both by the existence of
T. b. gambiense sequences which fall outside the main gambiense-like groups (e.g. Tbg_P1 for the promoter region;
Tbg_E6-8 for ESAG6) and by the existence of T. b. brucei
and T. equiperdum sequences which lie within these
groups (e.g. Tbb_P17 for the promoter region and
Teq_E5-8 for ESAG5).
In contrast, the T. b. brucei and T. equiperdum sequences
are both collectively more diverse and are mutually paraphyletic. Not only are there several groups containing
sequences from both subspecies, but there are several T. b.
brucei and T. equiperdum homologs which are nearly identical (e.g. promoter region: Tbb_P-5 and Teq_P-10,
ESAG6: Tbb_E6-5 and Teq_E6-11, and ESAG5: Tbb_E5-10
and Teq_E5-3) (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). Furthermore, to the

extent that there is local, strain-based structure outside of
the gambiense-like groups, this mainly consists of groups
of T. b. brucei sequences which have no closely related
sequences in the T. equiperdum genome (e.g., the group of
ESAG6 sequences including Tbb_E6-11, Tbb_E6-10 and
10 other T. b. brucei sequences).
The ESAG2 phylogenetic tree reveals a rather different set
of relationships between the sequences from the different
subspecies (Fig. 4). Apart from Tbg_E2-1 and Teq_E2-3,
all of the T. b. gambiense and T. equiperdum ESAG2
sequences belong to a single group which is itself only
partially strain-structured. Indeed, one pair of T. b. gambiense and T. equiperdum ESAG2 homologs is nearly identical (Tbg_E2-6 and Teq_E2-1). Furthermore, most ESAG2
sequences can be divided into two relatively divergent
subfamilies, one consisting almost exclusively of T. b. brucei sequences apart from Teq_E2-3 (ESAG2 type A
sequences), and the other containing almost all of the T.
b. gambiense and T. equiperdum sequences as well as six T.

Overview of T. equiperdum STIB 818 TAR clone library. A total of 91 TAR clones were isolated and typed into 16 different BES sets. The sequence
typing was performed as described for Table 1. As done previously, two TAR clones were chosen for each BES type (the name of one clone is
indicated in the chart), and the full length ESAG6, ESAG5 and ESAG2 ORFs were isolated and sequenced from both of these two clones.
aDouble sequence in the centre indicating two sequence types.
bPseudogene.
cPresence not detected by PCR. See Materials and Methods for diagnostic primers that were used for each ESAG.
dPartial sequence.
eDouble sequence indicating two sequence types within the same BES.

b. brucei sequences (ESAG2 type B sequences). Inspection
of the ESAG2 amino acid sequence alignments (see Additional file 4) reveals that the ESAG2 consensus type A and

type B sequences differ at 123 of 474 residues (25.9%).
This alignment also suggests that the most basally-branching ESAG2 sequences may be recombinants between type

Amino acid diversity and selection in ESAG sequences from three trypanosomatid protozoa. The BES loci studied are indicated on the left. The

A and type B sequences. For example, although the
Tbb_E2-12 ESAG2 sequence has a type A N-terminal
domain (residues 1–54), the remaining residues predominantly agree with the type B consensus sequence. Likewise, the Tbg_E2-1 ESAG2 sequence is most similar to the
type A consensus, but contains a tract of type B amino
acids between residues 302–359.

the T. b. brucei and T. equiperdum alignments, fewer are
present in the corresponding T. b. gambiense alignments
(Table 4).

The ESAG5 amino acid sequences can also be partitioned
into two subfamilies; although the differentiation is less
pronounced, with consensus sequences which differ at 72
of 480 residues (15%) (see Additional file 5). The group
of six relatively homogeneous T. equiperdum and T. b. brucei sequences in the ESAG5 phylogenetic tree constitute
the ESAG5 type A subfamily, while the remaining
sequences constitute the type B subfamily. As with ESAG2,
the most basally-branching ESAG5 sequence appears to be
a type A-type B recombinant. Although this Teq_E5-11
ESAG5 sequence is more closely related to the ESAG5 type
A subfamily, it includes several tracts of type B consensus
residues (e.g., residues 59–106).

Although these analyses suggest that allelic recombination rates within the trypanosome BES repertoire might
vary between loci and between subspecies, it is important
to point out that both trends, that of increasing recombination towards the telomeres, and of reduced recombination within T. b. gambiense, are confounded by subspecies
and locus-specific differences in genetic variation. Indeed,
the mean number of sites between adjacent breakpoints
inferred by GARD is significantly negatively correlated
with both measures of nucleotide diversity reported in
Table 4 (tract length ~%S: r2 = 0.466, P = 0.001; tract
length ~π: r2 = 0.462, P = 0.001). This correlation reflects
the fact that the power of GARD to infer recombination
breakpoints is limited by the amount of polymorphism in
the data. In particular, it is possible that the homogeneity
of the T. b. gambiense ESAG5 repertoire is due to extensive
gene conversion.

Evidence of recombination within BES loci
Having observed putatively recombinant sequences in
both the ESAG2 and ESAG5 families, we used a phylogenetic method to rigorously test each of the sequences from
the four BES loci in the three trypanosome subspecies for
evidence of recombination. The number of recombination breakpoints was inferred using GARD analysis (Table
4). With the exception of the T. b. gambiense ESAG5 alignment, the GARD analysis detected at least one breakpoint
in each alignment, with the density of breakpoints
increasing towards the telomere. For example, in the T. b.
brucei sequence alignments, adjacent breakpoints are separated on average by 207 bp in the promoter region, 200
bp in ESAG6, 179 bp in ESAG5, and 129 bp in ESAG2.
While comparable numbers of breakpoints are detected in

Adaptive evolution and amino acid diversity in ESAG
repertoires
In order to characterize the role of selection in the molecular evolution of the ESAG repertoires of T. b. brucei, T. b.
gambiense, and T. equiperdum, we estimated the distribution of the relative ratio of non-synonymous-to-synonymous substitutions (dN/dS ratio or ω) in ESAG6, ESAG5
and ESAG2 from the three trypanosome subspecies. Maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters of the
nearly neutral model M1a and the selection model M2a,
as well as the p-values of the likelihood ratio tests comparing the selection model with the nearly neutral model are
shown in the table in Additional file 6. These analyses
provide evidence for adaptive evolution within the
ESAG6, ESAG5, and ESAG2 repertoires of T. b. brucei and

T. equiperdum, and within the ESAG2 repertoire of T. b.
gambiense. In contrast, there is no statistically significant
evidence for diversifying selection within the ESAG6 and
ESAG5 repertoires of T. b. gambiense.
Because inference of subspecies-specific selection is complicated by the lack of reciprocal monophyly between the
homologous ESAG repertoires of the different strains, the
contrasting patterns seen in the ESAG6 and ESAG5 repertoires between T. b. gambiense and the other two subspecies are particularly striking (Fig. 3 and 4). On the one
hand, the paraphyly of the T. b. gambiense and T. equiperdum ESAG2 repertoires could explain why this locus does
not follow the same pattern (e.g. the amino acid replacements in ESAG2 could predate the origin of T. b. gambiense). Alternatively, diversifying selection on the ESAG2

sequences in the T. b. gambiense genome may have prevented the extensive homogenisation that has occurred
within the ESAG5 and ESAG6 families. The methods
employed here cannot distinguish between these possibilities.
In order to look in more detail at the patterns of molecular
evolution within individual ESAGs, relative nonsynonymous substitution rates at individual codons were estimated using the prior distributions determined by the ML
estimates of the model M2a parameters. The estimated
rates are listed in the table in Additional file 7 and plotted
against residue number in Additional file 8 (details in the
table in Additional file 7). Consistent with earlier surveys
of ESAG6 diversity [40,41], several residues in the hypervariable region of ESAG6 appear to be under diversifying

selection in all three trypanosome subspecies. Adaptive
evolution within the two transferrin-binding regions (box
1 and box 2) is evident in the T. b. brucei repertoire but not
in T. b. gambiense or in T. equiperdum. The T. equiperdum
data is consistent with data published in [40,41]. These
functional elements of ESAG6 are annotated in the table
in Additional file 7.
One unexpected finding is that several residues within the
signal peptide of each ESAG appear to be under diversifying selection, despite the fact that these regions are cleaved
from the nascent protein [42]. There are three such residues in ESAG6, five in ESAG5, and four in ESAG2. However, there are many other residues under diversifying
selection in these ESAGs which have no known structural

or functional association. Several of these residues are
inferred to be evolving adaptively in all three subspecies,
including residues 186 in ESAG6 and 81 and 434 in
ESAG2.
Table 5 shows the numbers of amino acid residues within
each alignment at which the non-synonymous substitution rate is more than twice as large as the synonymous
substitution rate (ω > 2). Also shown are the average estimates of ω at such residues, which is a measure of the
strength of diversifying selection. As can be seen in Additional file 8, there are notable differences in the patterns
of adaptive evolution in the three ESAG families. While
the absolute number and density of diversifying residues
in the T. b. brucei and T. equiperdum repertoires is greatest

in ESAG5 and least in ESAG2, the apparent strength of
diversifying selection at adaptively evolving residues is
greatest in ESAG2.
Curiously, almost the opposite pattern is evident in the T.
b. gambiense ESAG repertoires, with comparable numbers
of diversifying codons in ESAG6 and ESAG2, but almost
no amino acid variation in the ESAG5 sequences. It is also
surprising that the smaller and less diverse T. equiperdum
ESAG repertoires contain at least as many apparently
adaptively-evolving sites as the corresponding T. b. brucei
repertoires. This difference is most pronounced in ESAG6,
where there are about 50% more diversifying residues in
T. equiperdum than in T. b. brucei, despite the apparently
stronger selection at such residues in the latter subspecies
due to the larger size of its host range. Of course, as
remarked above, all inter-strain comparisons are con-

founded by the paraphyletic relationships between these
repertoires.
BES sequence diversity and trypanosome biology
The three trypanosome subspecies analysed here are
highly similar at the DNA sequence level, yet cause diseases with very different pathologies. Whereas T. b. gambiense infection produces a chronic form of human disease,
T. b. brucei is not human infective. Similarly, these
trypanosome subspecies have different susceptibilities to
drugs, whereby T. b. gambiense is very susceptible to the
drug DFMO unlike T. b. brucei [43]. T. equiperdum,
although closely related to T. b. brucei [14], infects different environments within the mammalian host. Rather
than multiplying extracellularly in the mammalian bloodstream like T. b. brucei and T. b. gambiense, T. equiperdum
is a tissue parasite primarily localised in the mucous mem-

Page 10 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:385

branes of the urogenital tract, and is rarely observed in the
bloodstream [15]. The challenge will come in trying to
understand how the limited genetic differences between
these subspecies translate into their very different pathologies.
If ESAGs mediate host-parasite interactions, one could
expect the diversity of individual BES repertoires to be
positively correlated with host range size. This is because
trypanosomes infecting multiple host species may be
under selection to evolve and then maintain distinct
ESAG alleles that are adapted to the different environments encountered in different species of mammalian
host. In fact, our data are not completely consistent with
this prediction. Of the three trypanosomes analysed here,
host range is greatest in T. b. brucei [10], intermediate in T.
b. gambiense [11], and smallest in T. equiperdum [15].
However, although ESAG diversity is consistently higher
in T. b. brucei than in the other two subspecies, the T. b.
gambiense BES repertoires are actually less diverse than
those of T. equiperdum. Likewise, although we find evidence for adaptive evolution in all three of the ESAG repertoires sequenced in T. b. brucei and T. equiperdum, only
the ESAG2 repertoire of T. b. gambiense appears to be
under diversifying selection. In addition, we find no correlation between the number of BESs found in a particular
trypanosome subspecies and the host range size. Lastly,
we find evidence for adaptive evolution of the ESAG6 repertoire of T. equiperdum, where it would be expected to be
minimal or absent due to the restricted size of the host
range of this trypanosome.
There are several reasons why ESAG diversity and host
range size might not be positively correlated. The hypothesis that diverse ESAG repertoires could facilitate trypanosome infection of diverse mammalian hosts was first
proposed for ESAG6 [27], where different sequence polymorphisms affect binding affinity of the transferrin receptor to variable transferrin molecules [39]. This proposal
has subsequently proved controversial. It has more
recently been argued that in vivo concentrations of transferrin are high enough that expression of even low-affinity
transferrin receptors is more than adequate to provide a
trypanosome with sufficient transferrin in a range of different mammalian hosts [44,45]. These results would
imply that ESAG6 sequence diversity within a given
trypanosome subspecies need not be correlated with size
of host range.
Alternatively, even if host range is an important determinant of the selection pressures on ESAG repertoires,
observed levels of ESAG diversity within individual
genomes are probably influenced by a variety of processes
that can create or remove variation. Sequence variation
can be both generated and removed through DNA recombination. One possibility is that T. b. gambiense has unu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/385

sually high rates of telomeric DNA rearrangements,
resulting in sequence homogenisation of ESAG repertoires through allelic gene conversion or gene duplication
and deletion. Another confounding factor is that genetic
exchange between ESAGs and their genome-internal paralogs could influence the polymorphism observed within
the BES repertoires. However, we can not easily reconcile
why high rates of gene conversion in T. b. gambiense would
lead to the relative homogenisation of the ESAG5 gene
family, but not of the ESAG2 repertoire. We will only be
able to understand the selection pressures maintaining
ESAG sequence diversity within a given trypanosome subspecies once we know more about the function of these
various ESAG gene families.
Another factor that might influence the generation and
maintenance of ESAG sequence diversity is the degree of
genetic exchange that any given trypanosome subspecies
undergoes. Different T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense
strains have been shown to undergo sex in the laboratory
after passage through tsetse flies [46-48], although the frequency with which this occurs in the field is unclear [49].
This genetic exchange could allow the continuous flow of
new ESAG sequences into a strain, facilitating the accumulation of genetic diversity. However in the Type I group of
T. b. gambiense trypanosomes including T. b. gambiense
DAL972 analysed here, there is no evidence for significant
genetic exchange occurring [50]. Population structure
analyses indicate that T. b. gambiense Type I populations
form a highly homogeneous group of trypanosomes
which appear to have expanded clonally [51,52], and
could have lost the ability to undergo meiosis [48]. Lack
of or extremely infrequent genetic exchange together with
significant rates of telomeric gene conversion would be
expected to facilitate the homogenisation of repetitive
gene families in the absence of a strong selection pressure
maintaining diversity
Why then are the ESAG sequences from T. b. gambiense
more homogeneous than those from T. equiperdum, which
could have lost the opportunity to undergo meiosis altogether when it ceased to be transmitted via tsetse flies? The
diversity within these ESAG repertoires is presumably not
at equilibrium. T. equiperdum is likely to have arisen from
T. b. brucei relatively recently (as proposed in [14]), and
thus may not have had time to completely lose ancestral
ESAG sequence variation that is not actively being selected
for in the equine host. In contrast, T. b. gambiense (Type I)
is thought to be much more distantly related to T. b. brucei
[52]. This is consistent with the genealogical relationships
of the ESAG6, ESAG5 and BES promoter repertoires in
these three subspecies, i.e., the T. b. brucei and T. equiperdum repertoires are paraphyletic, while the T. b. gambiense
repertoires are nearly reciprocally monophyletic, but does
not explain the very different relationships seen at ESAG2.

A point to remember is that BESs are dynamic groups of
genes. Each of the BES repertoires cloned presents a snapshot of what is going on within a population of trypanosomes, and each repertoire will contain a subset of ESAG
'alleles' present within the given trypanosome population. Further population structure analysis will allow us to
determine if what we see in these analysed subspecies is a
consequence of sampling rather than due to selection or
consequences of loss of parts of the life-cycle. While these
preliminary analyses are not the end of the story, these
BES libraries will be a useful resource for further analyses
of the processes influencing genetic variation in the telomeres of African trypanosomes.

Yeast colonies were screened for the presence of T. brucei
BES TAR clones with primers specific for ESAG6/ESAG7
corresponding to sequences located within particularly
conserved regions of these genes. ESAG6 and ESAG7 are
conserved elements within trypanosome BESs [26], and
their presence was considered diagnostic for the presence
of a T. brucei BES. For initial T. b. gambiense TAR clone
screening ESAG6/7 screening primers ESAG7a (sense and
anti-sense) were used (sequences in [34]). For screening
the rest of the T. b. gambiense TAR clones and all of the T.
b. brucei and T. equiperdum TAR clones, screening primers
ESAG6/7-311s and ESAG6-809as were used. See the table
in Additional file 9 for all primer sequences used.

Methods

TAR clone analysis and sequencing
In most cases, positive yeast transformants were streaked
out for single colonies, these were expanded on quarter
petri dishes, and yeast genomic DNA was isolated [34].
PCR products were generated by amplification for 35
cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, 50°C for 30 seconds, 72°C
for 1 minute for products smaller than 1 kb, and 1 minute
30 seconds for products longer than 1 kb. Fragments were
precipitated and sequenced using BigDye terminator
(Applied Biosystems). Sequence analysis was performed
with modifications of the procedure described in [34].
Sequences of all primers used in this study are presented
in the table in Additional file 9.

Trypanosome strains and DNA isolation and analysis
The genomic DNA used in the T. b. gambiense TAR BES telomere library produced in this study was isolated from the
insect form Trypanosoma brucei gambiense DAL972 genome
strain (received from Bill Wickstead, Keith Gull and
Wendy Gibson) according to [53]. DNA from bloodstream form T. b. brucei EATRO 2340 was a gift of Keith
Matthews (University of Edinburgh) and was isolated
according to [54]. Note that in the literature this strain is
referred to as T. b. rhodesiense EATRO 2340 [35]. However,
as we did not find evidence for the presence of SRA which
is considered diagnostic for T. b. rhodesiense using SRA
specific primers (Additional file 1) [13,55,56], this strain
was provisionally redesignated T. brucei brucei EATRO
2340. T. equiperdum STIB 818 (gift of Wendy Gibson, University of Bristol) [40,57,58] was amplified in mice, and
after purification of trypanosomes from whole blood
using DEAE columns, genomic DNA was isolated according to [54]. All animal experiments were subject to ethical
review by the University of Oxford, and were conducted
according to the conditions of a Home Office project
licence.
TAR cloning of Trypanosoma sp. BES telomeres
Transformation Associated Recombination (TAR) cloning
was performed essentially according to [34] using the S.
cerevisiae strain TYC1 as recipient (MATα, ura3-52, leu2Δ1,
cyh2r). The T. brucei BES-specific TAR vector pEB4 contains
the yeast positive selectable marker URA3, the negative
selectable marker CYH2, as well as a yeast centromere, origin of replication, and one yeast telomere. The T. brucei
specific TAR target within the pEB4 vector is a 560 bp fragment with a region of the T. brucei BES core promoter that
is particularly conserved over a range of different T. brucei
strains [34]. Recombination in yeast between the pEB4
TAR vector linearised with ClaI and the cotransfected T.
brucei genomic DNA, results in the production of stable
"half-YAC" containing a T. brucei BES as well as one yeast
telomere and one trypanosome telomere.

TAR clones were typed into BES sets by sequencing the
promoter region and an approximately 700 bp central
stretch of ESAG6. Promoter sequence was trimmed to
delete sequence corresponding to the region of the BES
promoter present in the pEB4 TAR vector target fragment.
Identification of sequence polymorphisms within both
the BES promoter and ESAG6 allowed the categorisation
of the different TAR clones into different sets corresponding to different BESs.
For typing of the different TAR clones using ES promoter
sequence, primers ESP S1/S2 (sense and anti-sense)
(sequence in [34]) were used for both the PCR and the
sequencing step. The sequence was trimmed to delete the
5' region corresponding to the TAR vector target fragment.
For ESAG6 sequence typing primers ESAG6-287s and
ESAG6-1045as were used for both the PCR and the
sequencing step.
After initial typing of the TAR clones into different BES
sets, the full length ESAG6, ESAG5 and ESAG2 genes were
amplified and sequenced from two different TAR clones
from each BES set. The strategy followed was:
ESAG6
The 5' end was amplified and sequenced using ESAG6UPSs and ESAG6-652as. The 3' end was amplified and
sequenced using ESAG6-796s and ESAG6-DNas.

ESAG5
Initial PCR to amplify the coding region was performed
with ESAG5-UPSs and ESAG5-DNas. If these failed, two
separate reactions using ESAG5-240s and ESAG5-DNas
and ESAG5-UPSs and ESAG5-578as were tried. The above
products were sequenced with ESAG5-UPSs, ESAG5DNas, ESAG5-240s, ESAG5-827s, ESAG5-578as and
ESAG5-1007as.
ESAG2
Initial PCR was performed with ESAG2-UPSs and ESAG2DN1as. If this failed, primers ESAG2-UPS2s and ESAG2DN3as were used. The PCR product was cleaned and
sequenced with ESAG2-UPS1s or ESAG2-UPS2s, ESAG2DN1as or ESAG2-DN3as, ESAG2-371s, ESAG2-871s,
ESAG2-505as, ESAG2-900as, ESAG2-970as or ESAG21088as.

Particular ESAGs were deemed absent from a given TAR
clone if the amplification strategy detailed above was
unsuccessful and if all additional primer pairs failed to
give rise to an amplified product. For ESAG5 the additional primer pairs were ESAG5-1 (sense and anti-sense),
ESAG5-2 (sense and anti-sense) and ESAG5-3 (sense and
anti-sense) (sequences in [34]). For ESAG2 the additional
primer pairs were ESAG2-1 (sense and anti-sense),
ESAG2-2 (sense and anti-sense) and ESAG2-3 (sense and
anti-sense) (sequences in [34]) and ESAG2-457s and
ESAG2-900as (sequences in Additional file 9). The
sequences of all primers used for PCR or sequencing are
indicated in the table in Additional file 9.

Sequence analysis
For the phylogenetic analyses sequence alignments were
generated using ClustalX [59], and then manually edited

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/385

and gap-stripped. Ambiguously-aligned regions were
removed. Phylogenetic analysis of each alignment was
then performed with PhyML [60], assuming a general
time reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model with
gamma-distributed rate variation among sites and a class
of invariant sites. Rate parameters and initial trees were
estimated from the data. Bootstrap values were estimated
from 100 bootstrap samples. To summarize the overall
diversity of these repertoires, we calculated the proportion
of segregating sites (%S) and the mean pairwise diversity
(π) of each of the 12 nucleotide alignments and 9 amino
acid alignments.
Each alignment was tested for evidence of recombination
using the likelihood-based method implemented in the
program (GARD [61]; http://www.datamonkey.org/
GARD). At each locus, the nucleotide substitution model
used in the subsequent GARD analysis was chosen using
the model selection tool provided with the HyPhy software package [62]; http://www.hyphy.org, and rate variation was modelled with a discrete distribution with up to
three distinct rate classes. Analyses were run until incorporation of additional breakpoints did not lead to a decrease
in the corrected Akaike information criterion (c-AIC).
When the initial GARD analysis failed to converge in the
time allocated, the alignment was divided into two subregions at the breakpoint with the highest c-AIC-support in
the initial analysis, and each subregion was then separately analysed with GARD.
In order to determine the adaptive evolution of ESAG
sequences, we used the method described in [63] to characterize the relative rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions within the ESAG6, ESAG5 and
ESAG2 gene families from each of the three trypanosome
subspecies. This method extends existing likelihoodbased approaches for detecting adaptive evolution of protein-coding sequences to recombinant sequences by
allowing the genealogy to vary across the alignment while
sharing the parameters of the codon substitution model
between tracts [64,65]. Each ESAG family was codonaligned (with pseudogenes excluded and ambiguouslyaligned regions stripped), and the breakpoints identified
by GARD analysis were adjusted by up to two bases to
coincide with codon boundaries. The neighbour joining
trees inferred during GARD analysis were used as estimates of the genealogies of the putative recombination
tracts.
To assess the evidence for adaptive evolution, HyPhy was
used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the
branch lengths, the transition-to-transversion rate ratio
(κ), and the parameters of two models of the distribution
of the non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio (ω).
Under the nearly neutral model (M1a), ω is drawn from a

Page 13 of 16

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:385

discrete distribution with two classes, ω0 < 1 and ω1 = 1,
with relative weights p0 and p1. The selection model
(M2a) allows for a third category, ω2 > 1, of adaptivelyevolving sites with relative weight p2. Because the neutral
model is nested within the selection model (setting p2 =
0 in M2a recovers M1a), a likelihood ratio test for positive
selection can be performed by comparing twice the loglikelihood difference between M1a and M2a with a χ2-distribution on two degrees of freedom [66]. The relative
nonsynonymous substitution rates at individual codons
were estimated using the empirical Bayes method
described in [66]: model M2a, with the maximum likelihood estimated parameters, was taken as a prior distribution for ω, and Bayes' formula was used to calculate the
posterior distribution of ω at each codon, given the
sequence data. All calculations were carried out using a
HyPhy batch language script written by Konrad Scheffler
and included in the current distribution of the HyPhy
software package.
