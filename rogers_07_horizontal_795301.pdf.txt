Abstract
Background: Horizontal or lateral transfer of genetic material between distantly related
prokaryotes has been shown to play a major role in the evolution of bacterial and archaeal
genomes, but exchange of genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is not as well understood.
In particular, gene flow from eukaryotes to prokaryotes is rarely documented with strong support,
which is unusual since prokaryotic genomes appear to readily accept foreign genes.
Results: Here, we show that abundant marine cyanobacteria in the related genera Synechococcus
and Prochlorococcus acquired a key Calvin cycle/glycolytic enzyme from a eukaryote. Two nonhomologous forms of fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) are characteristic of eukaryotes and
prokaryotes respectively. However, a eukaryotic gene has been inserted immediately upstream of
the ancestral prokaryotic gene in several strains (ecotypes) of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. In
one lineage this new gene has replaced the ancestral gene altogether. The eukaryotic gene is most
closely related to the plastid-targeted FBA from red algae. This eukaryotic-type FBA once replaced
the plastid/cyanobacterial type in photosynthetic eukaryotes, hinting at a possible functional
advantage in Calvin cycle reactions. The strains that now possess this eukaryotic FBA are scattered
across the tree of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, perhaps because the gene has been transferred
multiple times among cyanobacteria, or more likely because it has been selectively retained only in
certain lineages.
Conclusion: A gene for plastid-targeted FBA has been transferred from red algae to
cyanobacteria, where it has inserted itself beside its non-homologous, functional analogue. Its
current distribution in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus is punctate, suggesting a complex history
since its introduction to this group.

Background
Comparative genomics has generated a large pool of
molecular data, and one of the major debates to emerge
from this data is the importance of horizontal gene transfer in genomic evolution [1]. Cases of prokaryote to

prokaryote and prokaryote to eukaryote transfers are manifold, and their importance has dominated this debate [24]. However, relatively few cases of eukaryote to prokaryote transfers have been reported, and many are not supported by broad representation or strong phylogenetic

results [4]. The apparent paucity of such events in relation
to transfers between prokaryotes could reflect biological
limitations on gene transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes. Such limitations might include the presence of spliceosomal introns, or differences in promoter structures
and ribosomal binding sites. Another important consideration, however, is that prokaryotes are far more abundant
than eukaryotes in most microbial ecosystems, so there
might be limited opportunities for such transfers to occur.
Nevertheless, a small number of well-supported examples
of eukaryote to prokaryote gene transfer are known. One
of the most intriguing of these is the transfer of eukaryotic
alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits to the bacterium Prosthecobacter [5,6]. Other examples are described in the
recent analysis of eukaryotic shikimate pathway enzymes
[7]. This study has revealed a possible eukaryote to
prokaryote transfer in the gene encoding a class II 3deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate
7-phosphate
(DAHP)synthase. Another proposed eukaryote to
prokaryote transfer might have occurred in the spirochaete Treponema pallidum, which contains a eukaryotic-type
GAPDH that is phylogenetically related to euglenozoan
homologues [8]. Here, we report another example of
eukaryote to prokaryote gene transfer with a number of
unique functional and evolutionary implications.
Fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBA, or aldolase) is a
core carbon metabolic enzyme responsible for the aldol
cleavage of fructose-bisphosphate into glyceraldehyde-3phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate
(DHAP) sugars in glycolytic reactions, and the reverse
aldol condensation of these triose sugars to fructosebisphosphate in Calvin cycle and gluconeogenic reactions. FBA exists in two non-homologous but functionally
equivalent forms, referred to as class I and class II [9].
Eukaryotes typically use class I FBA, although there are a
few noteworthy exceptions [10-13]. In contrast, prokaryotes typically use the class II form of the enzyme, although
once again a handful of species also encode a class I form
of unknown function. One other interesting exception is
found in the plastid (chloroplast) of plants and many
algae. A large number of cyanobacterial genomes have
been shown to encode a canonical, bacterial class II FBA,
indicating that this FBA is ancestral to the group, as one
would expect for prokaryotes. As the descendants of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria, plastids would also be expected
to contain this cyanobacterial class II FBA, but this
enzyme has been replaced by a duplicate of the host cytoplasmic class I enzyme in the ancestors of plants, red and
green algae, resulting in two class I enzymes in these
groups [14]. Hence, glaucophyte plastids are unique in
having retained their ancestral protein [12].
Here we show that this eukaryotic plastid-targeted class I
FBA has itself been transferred to a specific group of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/26

marine cyanobacteria. The complete genomes of several
strains of both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus encode a
class I FBA gene. We show that these are evolutionarily
related to the gene for the plastid-targeted protein of red
algae. In some strains, the ancestral class II gene has also
been lost, suggesting that the eukaryotic gene has completely taken over its function. The position of the transferred gene is also of interest, as it is immediately
upstream of the class II FBA in genomes where both are
present. In genomes where the class II FBA has been lost,
the new class I gene therefore occupies the position previously occupied by class II FBA.

Results and Discussion
Class I and class II FBA in Prochlorococcus and
Synechococcus
Cyanobacterial genomes typically encode a class II FBA for
use in both glycolysis and the Calvin cycle. However, in
two closely related genera, Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, we have found the situation is more complex. The
order of genes surrounding the FBA locus is highly conserved among completely sequenced representative
genomes from both genera. While many strains encode
only the ancestral cyanobacterial class II FBA, in three Synechococcus strains (BL107, CC9902, and 9311) and three
Prochlorococcus strains (SS120, AS9601, and MIT9515), a
eukaryote-derived class I FBA is found immediately
upstream of the ancestral cyanobacterial gene (Figure 1).
Moreover, in two Prochlorococcus strains (NATL1A and
NATL2A) the cyanobacterial class II FBA has been lost,
effectively leaving the eukaryotic class I FBA in its place
(Figure 1). Prochlorococcus MIT9303 also has a homologue
of this gene elsewhere in the genome, but both it and the
canonical class II FBA contain several stop codons, indicating either they are pseudogenes or sequencing errors.

To compare the distribution of FBA genes to the phylogeny of the organisms, a phylogeny of Prochlorococcus and
Synechococcus strains was constructed using a locus independent of FBA, the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer
(ITS). This phylogeny (Figure 1) largely agrees with previously published analyses [15], with a distinction between
the two genera and a further subdivision between highlight and low-light adapted strains of Prochlorococcus [15].
However, the phylogeny is incompatible with any simple
explanation for the distribution of FBA genes. Most
importantly, the organisms that possess the eukaryotic
class I FBA do not form a unique clade in the ITS phylogeny, but are instead scattered across the tree. This is exemplified by two pairs of Prochlorococcus strains (MIT9301/
AS9601 and MED4/MIT9515) that share virtually identical ITS sequences, and are thus inferred to be closely
related, but in both cases the former strain encodes only
the ancestral class II FBA whereas the latter encodes both
classes. The two Prochlorococcus strains that encode only

the eukaryotic class I gene (NATL1A and NATL2A) are
closely related in ITS phylogeny, suggesting the class II
FBA was lost once in their common ancestor.
Origin of class I FBA in Synechococcus and
Prochlorococcus
The relatively restricted distribution of this eukaryotic
gene in a few strains of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus
suggests either a very recent origin in these genera, or horizontal gene transfer between strains. To determine if the
genes originated once in cyanobacteria and from what
kind of eukaryote they might be derived, phylogenetic
analyses were performed to determine the position of the
cyanobacterial genes relative to eukaryotic class I FBAs.
Class I FBA phylogeny has been shown previously to lack
sufficient resolution between many major subgroups
[14,16], and the present analysis was no exception to this
(Figure 2). However, the cyanobacterial genes formed a
unique clade with 100% support, indicating a single origin of the gene in Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. Most
importantly, the cyanobacterial genes formed a specific
and strongly-supported group with the nuclear-encoded,
plastid-targeted FBAs from red algae (100% support).
These genes are very distantly related to the discrete clade
of class I FBAs already known from some prokaryotes,
which is also present in three cyanobacteria Trichodesmium
erythraeum, Crocosphaera watsonii, and Synechococystis
PCC6803. These genera are not closely related to Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus genes show elevated rates of evolution, but with
the exception of the possible pseudogene in Prochlorococcus MIT9303, none show any signs of being non-functional or otherwise unusual.

cifically involving the gene for its plastid-targeted FBA.
However, such an event would lead to a simple distribution of class I FBA in cyanobacteria where all taxa possessing the new gene were closely related to one another. This
contrasts with the observed distribution shown in Figure
1, and is best exemplified by Prochlorococcus strains
AS9601/MIT9301 and MIT9515/MED4, where apparently
close relatives differ in the presence or absence of class I
FBA. The complexity of this distribution suggests the evolution of class I FBA within Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus has been characterised either by further gene transfer
events, or selective loss and retention of this eukaryotic
gene across different strains. These two alternatives are
described in greater detail below.

An affinity between genes for plastid-targeted proteins
and cyanobacterial homologues is generally not surprising. However, this result is unusual in that the red and
green algal plastid FBAs are not derived from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont. Instead, these genes have been
inferred to result from a duplication of and replacement
by the non-homologous, cytosolic class I FBA [14]. Altogether, this eukaryotic class I FBA has invaded a prokaryotic, photosynthetic environment twice: originally
invading the endosymbiotic plastid in the ancestor of red
and green algae (glaucophytes being the only primary
algae that retain the ancestral class II FBA in their plastid
[11,12]), and subsequently invading the cyanobacterial
lineage itself in the genera Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus.

On the one hand, it is possible that the class I FBA was
transferred relatively recently from a red alga to one member of the Prochlorococcus/Synechococcus clade, and subsequently moved to other strains to achieve its present
distribution. While multiple transfer events appears complex, there are well-known precedents for gene transfer
between Prochlorococcus strains, facilitated by cross-infecting phage [17-19]. This leads to the possibility that the
phylogeny of class I FBA might not match that of the
strains in which it is found. However, the topology of the
Prochlorococcus/Synechococcus clade in the class I FBA tree
(Figure 2) does not differ in any strongly-supported node
from the phylogeny inferred from ITS (Figure 1). Moreover, the fact that class I FBA is always found in the same
genomic context suggests that such inter-strain transfer
would most likely have involved insertion by homologous recombination. This would lead to the additional
expectation that the flanking genes might share a greater
degree of similarity to homologues in other strains with
class I FBA than they do to homologues from strains that
lack it. To test this, we inferred phylogenies of the ancestral class II FBA (Figure 3) and genes upstream and downstream of both FBA genes (mviM upstream and purQ
downstream: see Additional file 1). In all three cases the
phylogenies mirror the ITS phylogeny for strongly-supported nodes relative to the distribution of FBA genes, and
in no case do they reveal a clade consisting of the class I
FBA-containing strains. These gene sequences were also
manually examined for evidence of small-scale recombination at the ends proximal to FBA, and none was
observed. There is therefore no evidence that the evolutionary history of either class I or class II FBA has recently
deviated from that of the organisms in which they are
found (inferred from ITS phylogeny).

FBA distribution within Synechococcus and
Prochlorococcus
The phylogeny of class I FBA shows the Prochlorococcus/
Synechococcus genes originated once, and strongly suggests
this was by horizontal gene transfer from a red alga, spe-

As there is no direct evidence for recombination in this
region between strains containing class I FBA, and no
indication that the evolutionary history of Prochlorococcus
and Synechococcus class I FBA genes differs from the organisms in which they are found, there is no reason to believe

the gene has moved between strains. A more likely explanation is that class I FBA was acquired in the ancestor of
Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus and its current distribu-

tion is due to differential gene loss and retention events.
As with the horizontal transfer explanation, there is also a
precedent for aldolase loss events in these genera, as the

ancestral class II FBA has clearly been lost in Prochlorococcus NATL1A and NATL2A. This explanation is consistent
with all phylogenetic data, but without more sampling
from additional strains, it would be premature to definitively distinguish between these two alternatives, or some
combination of both.
Implications for FBA evolution and function
The existence and the punctate distribution of the eukaryotic class I FBA in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus both
have interesting implications for the evolution and function of this enzyme in cyanobacteria.

A single early origin of the eukaryotic class I FBA in
Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus implies that both genes
were present in their common ancestor and that redundancy was common throughout their evolution. The
eukaryotic enzyme would not be retained without having
acquired some function, which is most clearly demonstrated in the NATL1A and NATL2A strains where the
ancestral class II gene has been lost. The maintenance of
both types of FBA in several strains today, particularly in
the minimal genome of Prochlorococcus SS120 [20], further supports the conclusion that the class I FBA has some
function. It is possible that the two classes of FBA are functionally differentiated, perhaps between glycolysis and the
Calvin cycle, or perhaps one recognised a new substrate

(as might also be the case with the other discrete clade of
bacterial class I FBA genes in Figure 2). Any such differentiation must be reversible, however, as both classes have
been lost at least once. If we consider only nodes with
greater than 90% support from at least one method in Figure 1, then the eukaryotic class I FBA would have to have
been lost at least once in Synechococcus and at least three
times in Prochlorococcus. In reality these figures are likely
larger, because many nodes in the phylogeny that are not
taken into account are also consistently recovered and
well supported in the other phylogenies. The ancestral
class II gene would also have to have been lost at least
once in the ancestor of Prochlorococcus NATL1A and
NATL2A, which has remarkable implications for the function of this enzyme in the Calvin cycle. Indeed, if any of
the gene losses implied by the distribution of FBA genes
led to its function being assumed or re-assumed by its
analogue, then a closer examination of the biochemical
activities of class I and class II FBA in strains of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus where both types of FBA are
present will be interesting. Further examination might
reveal conditions under which each class of FBA is
favoured, addressing the question of why the eukaryotic
protein was retained at all.
These considerations also need to take into account the
unusual position of the eukaryotic gene in the genome. Its
situation immediately upstream of its analogue might be
chance, but this would be extremely fortuitous. We suggested above that this position might have favoured the
retention of the new gene because the regulation of this
position might have been favourable for a new FBA gene
due to the presence of the existing one. However, if these
two genes are part of an operon, functional differentiation
might have taken place without expression-level differentiation. For example, temporal differentiation (such as
light/dark cycles) could easily lead to the two enzymes
adapting to different roles, but if they are co-expressed
such differentiation becomes more difficult. This once
again points to the importance of re-evaluating the functional differences between these two classes of FBA to see
if there is some mechanistic property that might convey a
selective advantage of class I FBA over class II, perhaps
only manifested in one direction.

Conclusion
Recent and well-defined cases of horizontal gene transfer
from eukaryotes to prokaryotes remain rare, despite the
abundance of data from prokaryotic genomes. This example stands out not only as one of the more strongly-supported cases, but also has a number of other interesting
implications. The location of the gene immediately
upstream of its non-homologous, functional analogue
suggests the genomic context of this insertion was decidedly non-random and points to the importance of context

in the adaptation of a newly transferred gene. The punctate distribution of the eukaryotic class I FBA among
strains of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus also suggests
the history of this enzyme was subject to further complications that might shed light on the fate of newly acquired
genes in prokaryotic genomes.
One of the major outstanding questions of this study is
whether the eukaryotic class I FBA confers any advantage
over its analogue, as opposed to simply replacing the analogue to no great consequence. In either case, the functional differences between class I and class II FBA proteins
should be re-investigated in greater detail, as the possibility that class I FBAs might be more effective in Calvin cycle
reactions has broad implications for the evolution of photosynthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and for the origin and evolution of plastid organelles.

Methods
Identification of FBA genes and genomic context
All complete cyanobacterial genomes (and all prokaryotic
genomes in general) were searched for both class I and
class II FBA gene sequences using Blastp and Blastx. The
red alga-derived class I FBA was found in several strains of
Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus but in no other cyanobacterium and no other prokaryotic genome. The annotated identity of the flanking genes was compared and
confirmed by database comparisons. Genomic data from
unpublished genomes of Prochlorococcus AS9601,
MIT9211, MIT9301, MIT9303, MIT9312, MIT9315,
NATL1A were kindly provided by ML Coleman and SW
Chisholm (Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 15
Vassar Street Bldg., Cambridge, MA).
Phylogenetic methods
Protein phylogeny of class I FBA was generated from an
alignment of 75 taxa and 312 characters using PhyML
2.4.4 [21] with the WAG substitution matrix, four gamma
categories and one category of invariable sites. All substitutions matrices were determined using Modelgenerator
0.83 [22]. The gamma shape parameter alpha and the proportion of invariable sites i were estimated by PhyML to
be 1.14 and 0.07, respectively. One hundred bootstrap
replicates were preformed in the same way, using alpha
and i parameters estimated from the original data. Distances were calculated using TREE-PUZZLE v. 5.2 with the
WAG substitution matrix, four gamma categories and one
category of invariable sites using the same alpha and i estimates. Trees were constructed using WEIGHBOR 1.0.1a
and 500 bootstraps carried out using puzzleboot [23].
Nucleotide based phylogenies of ITS, FBA II, purQ and
mviM from Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were carried
out using the same methods and the same numbers of
bootstraps. For ITS (58 taxa and 212 positions), the HKY

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/26

model of substitution with four gamma categories and
one category of invariable sites was used, with the alpha
parameter, proportion of invariable sites, and ts:tv ratio
estimated from the data (0.40, 0.12, and 3.05, respectively). For class II FBA (18 taxa and 1021 positions), purQ
(20 taxa and 639 positions) and mviM (20 taxa and 1003
positions) the GTR model of substitution with four
gamma categories and one category of invariable sites was
used. The alpha parameters were estimated to be 2.96,
1.57, and 1.55, and the proportions of invariable sites
were estimated to be 0.51, 0.31 and 0.20, for class II FBA,
purQ and mviM, respectively.
