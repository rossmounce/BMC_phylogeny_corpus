Abstract
Background: The zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI) and the isthmus organizer (IsO) are two major secondary
organizers of vertebrate brain development. These organizers are located at the interface of the expression
domains of key patterning genes (Fezf-Irx and Otx-Gbx, respectively). To gain insights into the evolutionary origin of
the ZLI, we studied Fezf in bilaterians.
Results: In this paper, we identified a conserved sequence motif (Fezf box) in all bilaterians. We report the
expression pattern of Fezf in amphioxus and Drosophila and compare it with those of Gbx, Otx and Irx. We found
that the relative expression patterns of these genes in vertebrates are fully conserved in amphioxus and flies,
indicating that the genetic subdivisions defining the location of both secondary organizers in early vertebrate brain
development were probably present in the last common ancestor of extant bilaterians. However, in contrast to
vertebrates, we found that Irx-defective flies do not show an affected Fezf expression pattern.
Conclusions: The absence of expression of the corresponding morphogens from cells at these conserved genetic
boundaries in invertebrates suggests that the organizing properties might have evolved specifically in the
vertebrate lineage by the recruitment of key morphogens to these conserved genetic locations.

Background
Secondary morphogenetic organizers are located at the
boundaries of major vertebrate brain compartments, and
play essential roles in the development of the highly
complex vertebrate brain. The two main brain internal
organizers are the isthmus organizer (IsO) and the zona
limitans intrathalamica (ZLI). The IsO is located in the
midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), at the abutting
expression domains of Otx and Gbx, and the ZLI develops within the diencephalon, between the prethalamus
and thalamus, at the boundary of Fezf and Irx gene
expression domains (Figure 1A). As is typical for organizers, cells from these structures are the source of

diffusible signaling factors that determine the further
development of the adjacent cellular compartments. ZLI
cells characteristically secrete Shh [1,2], whereas the IsO
typically releases Fgf8 and Wnt1 [3].
Bona fide IsO and ZLI organizers are present in all
vertebrates, including basal living agnathans [4,5]; however, the absence of the key morphogens at analogous
topological positions [6-9] suggests that comparable signaling centers are not present in invertebrates with a
central nervous system (CNS), including amphioxus, a
basal chordate considered to be the best living proxy to
the vertebrate-invertebrate ancestor [5]. Like vertebrates,
amphioxus has a dorsal hollow neural tube that forms
from a neural plate. However, the amphioxus brain is
relatively simple, consisting only of a putative non-subdivided diencephalon, a Hox-patterned hindbrain and
perhaps a small midbrain [10].
Despite the lack of internal brain organizers in invertebrates, previous observations suggested that the interface between the abutting expression domains of the

between the prethalamus and thalamus at the vertebrate
diencephalon, and the position at which the ZLI will
develop (Figure 1A). However, no studies have yet investigated the origin of the ZLI in organisms other than
vertebrates. To gain insights into these questions, we
characterized the Fezf gene in the basal chordate
amphioxus and in the protostome Drosophila melanogaster. We analyzed their developmental expression patterns and compared them with those of the Irx, Otx and
Gbx genes. Strikingly, we found that the relative expression of Fezf, Irx, Otx and Gbx genes in the CNS is fully
conserved between these species, suggesting a widespread involvement of these genes in early molecular
patterning of the bilaterian CNS.

Results and Discussion
Fezf is highly conserved across phyla and is ancestral to
bilaterians

members of the Otx (green) and Gbx (orange) gene families. (B)

Otx/otd and Gbx/unpg genes, which determines the
positioning of the MHB (Figure 1), is ancestral to all
bilaterians [11,12]. By contrast, much less is known
about the evolutionary origin of the other major anterior-posterior brain subdivision and the ZLI, and how
the two organizers physically related to each other originally. Recently, the zinc-finger Fezf gene family was
reported to have a primary role in establishing the ZLI
in vertebrates [13-15]. Fezf is expressed exclusively in
the most anterior part of the brain, and its caudal
expression abuts that of Irx genes. The interface of the
Fezf and Irx expression domains delineates the border

Fezf is a transcription factor of the C2H2 zinc finger
family, containing six zinc fingers. Using in silico analysis, we identified putative Fezf orthologs in all studied
metazoans (see Methods), including non-bilaterians.
The orthology of the different putative Fezf genes
is robustly supported by phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 2A). The coding sequences of the zinc finger
domain are highly conserved between different groups,
showing typically > 75% identity at the amino acid
level. In addition to the zinc finger domain, non-bilaterians Fezf proteins have a co-repressor SNAG
domain, typical of other related zinc finger gene
families, such as Snail and Gfi [16]. This domain was
probably present at the origin of Fezf gene family, but
has been lost in all studied bilaterians, with the exception of amphioxus, for which we could identify a putative SNAG domain in silico, although reverse
transcription PCR experiments showed that this
domain is not included in the Fezf transcripts during
development of either Branchiostoma floridae or Branchiostoma lanceolatum. Multiple convergent secondary
losses of the SNAG domain have also been reported in
the Snail/Scratch superfamily [16,17] and it has been
proposed that these losses are associated with the
acquisition of different conserved domains that carry
out a co-repressor function, such as the CtBP-binding
site or the NT box [16]. Consistent with this hypothesis, we identified a highly conserved sequence motif
near the N-terminus of all studied bilaterian Fezf proteins, which we have termed ‘Fezf box’ (Figure 2B) and
which seems to be exclusive to the Fezf gene family.
The clear inverse relation between the presence of the
Fezf box (in bilaterians) and the SNAG domain (in
non-bilaterians and related genes) suggests that this
previously unidentified conserved motif might also
function as a co-repressor domain.

In addition to the canonical Fezf genes, we also found
‘Fezf-like’ genes in cnidarians and sea urchin (NveFezf3,
NveFezf12 and NveFezf30 and SpuFezli [18]); these
genes branch at basal positions of the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 2A) and contain a SNAG domain but not a Fezf
box.
Finally, we also studied the exon-intron structure
within the zinc finger domain, where the sequence can
be confidently aligned. Surprisingly, whereas in nearly
all species no introns are found within the zinc finger
domain, all vertebrate genes have three introns (one
conserved with the tunicate Ciona) that seem to be lineage-specific gains (Figure 2C). This is unexpected, considering the high conservation of intron positions from
cnidarians to vertebrates in the deuterostome line
[19-23] and the generally low rate of intron gains along
these lineages.
Expression of Fezf, Irx and Gbx in amphioxus

To gain insights into the evolutionary origin of the vertebrate ZLI, we analyzed the developmental expression
of the single Fezf gene of the basal chordate amphioxus
(B. lanceolatum). As in vertebrates, Fezf expression
starts at the beginning of neurulation, and its expression
is highly restricted to the most anterior part of the
neural plate (the six to seven anterior-most rows of
cells) (Figure 3A, B). This restricted anterior neural
domain continues to the larval stages (Figure 3C, D), at
which point the expression is found only in the cerebral
vesicle, the most anterior part of the amphioxus larval
neural tube. We next compared Fezf expression to Irx
and Gbx genes at neurula stage, which in vertebrates
mark the posterior boundaries of the presumptive ZLI
and MHB, respectively. Strikingly, we found that the
relative expression of Fezf, Irx and Gbx genes in the
neural plate is fully conserved between amphioxus and
vertebrates (Figure 4A, B), indicating that these genetic
interfaces, which contribute to delineate these major
brain subdivisions, were present before the origin of vertebrates. In both Xenopus and amphioxus, the expression of Fezf abuts that of Irx, and there is a conserved
gap between the expression domains of Fezf and Gbx
that shows Irx expression (Figure 4A, B), consistent with
an ancestrally conserved anterior-posterior topology of
the MHB positioning relative to the ZLI. Moreover, the
abutting expression of the Fezf and Irx genes constitutes
a conserved genetic subdivision within the amphioxus
presumptive diencephalon, raising the intriguing possibility of potential equivalents of proto-prethalamic and a
proto-thalamic regions in the primitive chordate brain,
consistent with other observations [24,25]. Further
investigation will be required to assess to what extent
these structures are homologous and functionally

Page 4 of 10

equivalent to their vertebrate counterparts or whether
they correspond to distinct amphioxus novelties.
Expression of Fezf in flies

To further investigate the evolutionary origin of these
early genetic brain subdivisions, we examined the
expression patterns of Fezf and Irx homologous in the
Drosophila developing CNS. dFezf/Earmuff/CG31670
has been recently shown to maintain the restricted
developmental potential of intermediate neural progenitors in Drosophila [26], and its embryonic expression
pattern has been documented previously [27]. As in
chordates, dFezf expression is restricted to the most
anterior part of the fly CNS throughout early CNS
development (Figure 3E-J). Fezf expression starts in blastoderm embryos as a dorsal and lateral stripe in the
anterior (neurogenic procephalic) region of the blastoderm (Figure 3E,F). Characteristically, the lateral ends of
this stripe widen, making the pattern resemble earmuffs
(Figure 3G). In early germband extension-stage embryos,
the stripe is split at the dorsal midline (Figure 3G), generating bilaterally symmetrical domains (Figure 3G-J).
During later embryogenesis, dFezf-expressing cells delaminate and cluster to form part of the brain hemispheres (Figure 3H-J). Importantly, the expression
domain of mirror (mirr), the earliest fly Irx expressed
gene, also abuts that of dFezf (Figure 4C). Our results,
along with the fact that in Drosophila the orthologs of
Otx and Gbx also show complementary expression
domains (Figure 4C, [12]), and the presence of the conserved gap between the expression domains of fly Fezf
and Gbx orthologs, suggest that this simple initial genoarchitectural plan, which broadly subdivides the vertebrate nervous system, was present in the last common
ancestor of extant bilateral animals.
Significantly, Fezf and Irx in vertebrates regulate each
other in a mutually exclusive manner. In knockout or
knockdown mutants for these genes in different vertebrate species, there is a shift in the expression limit of
the counterpart gene, either anteriorly (in the case of Irx
[13,14]) or posteriorly (in the case of Fezf [15]). To
assess whether this situation was at least partially conserved in flies, we also analyzed the expression of dFezf
in iro DFM3 mutant embryos, which lack the Irx genes
[28]. In stark contrast to vertebrates, we did not find
any noticeable caudal shift in the posterior limit of dFezf
expression (data not shown).
Early complex brains

The strongly restricted expression of Fezf to the anterior
forebrain in vertebrates is an indication of its crucial
role in the patterning of the vertebrate brain. The presence of deeply conserved Fezf orthologs in all studied

metazoans, from placozoans to vertebrates, thus raises
the question of whether Fezf might play a similar conserved role throughout animal phylogeny, or whether it
has been recruited for different developmental functions
in the different phyla. We show that in two distantly
related invertebrate groups with a centralized CNS Fezf
orthologs are also expressed in a strongly restricted
manner in the developing anterior CNS, suggesting that
the ancestral function of Fezf in bilaterians might well

be related to the patterning of the CNS. Furthermore,
the conserved relative expression with other key patterning genes (Irx, Gbx and Otx) at early neurulation stages
suggest that all these genes may help to define broad
conserved regions within the neural ectoderm as a
whole in different bilaterian organisms [11,12,29,30].
Based on several similarities in patterning gene expression and function, Reichert and collaborators suggested
that the last common ancestor of extant bilaterians,

Urbilateria, had a tripartite brain, and that Drosophila
and vertebrate brains had a comparable anterior-posterior patterning [12,31,32]. These authors proposed a
model with three domains consisting (from anterior to
posterior) of: (1) forebrain/midbrain, (2) an intervening
MHB region and (3) a hindbrain. These three structures
are characterized by the specific expression of the Otx,
Pax2/5/8 and Hox genes, respectively [12,31]. Our
results complement and expand this model, adding an
extra conserved genetic subdivision to the forebrain/protocerebrum of the studied species.
Origin of the ZLI secondary organizer

In addition to Fezf-Irx, other sets of genes with mutually
exclusive expression patterns have been proposed to be

involved in the development of the ZLI in vertebrates.
Based on misexpression analysis, it was first suggested
that the mutual repression between Irx genes and Six3
(expressed at early stages in the whole anterior forebrain
anlage, limited caudally by the anterior boundary of Irx
genes) (Figure 1B[33]) contributed to the establishment
of the ZLI and other diencephalic subdivisions [34]. In
amphioxus early neurula, BfSix3/6 is expressed in the
anterior-most part of the neural plate, with a posterior
boundary seemingly consistent with that of Fezf-Irx [24].
However, the role of Six3 in establishing the ZLI has
recently been challenged, because, in contrast to Fezf,
Six3 expression is very dynamic and regresses rostrally,
both in vertebrates and amphioxus [24,33,34], leaving a
region free of Irx and Six3. Six3 function might thus be

Irimia et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:7
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/7

related to cell proliferation rather than to neural patterning at these stages [24].
Another important pair of genes with mutually exclusive expression patterns thought to be involved in ZLI
formation in vertebrates are Lfng and Wnt8b [1]. Lfng is
expressed widely in the chick prosencephalon, with the
exception of a wedge-shaped area (presumptive ZLI),
where Wnt8b is expressed (Figure 1B, [1]). This Wnt8bpositive/Lfng-negative region is where the ZLI will
develop. In amphioxus, however, the single BfFng gene
is expressed throughout the anterior-most part of the
neural plate in early neurula, apparently with no discontinuity [35], whereas BfWnt8 is not expressed in the
CNS at early developmental stages [36](Figure 1B).
Taken together, these results suggest that, although
the genetic boundary determining the location of the
ZLI in vertebrates was present in proximal chordate
ancestors, some of the components of the putative ZLI
gene network [1] were not yet assembled. Accordingly,
molecules secreted as secondary organizers in vertebrates have not been found in the amphioxus developing
brain [7,9]. Thus, it is likely that in vertebrate ancestors,
the ZLI secondary organizers evolved through the
recruitment of the expression of key morphogens to the
cells located in the interface of these conserved major
genetic domains, defined by the abutting expressions of
Fezf-Irx. Presumably, this would have led to the development of new subdivisions and brain structures, possibly
allowing the increase in proliferation and complexity of
present-day vertebrate brains. However, it is also possible that internal brain organizers evolved before the vertebrates originated, and were then lost in the studied
invertebrate chordates by reductive evolution. Equivalent
signaling centers have not been reported in any invertebrate to date; however, it is still possible that a more
thorough study of other invertebrates, such as hemichordates, which show a wide conservation of relative
gene expression patterns with vertebrates [37], or basal
slow-evolving protostomes, for which there are no molecular data yet available, will help to clarify the origins of
the vertebrate brain complexity.

Methods
In silico Identification and comparison of Fezf genes
across metazoans

Using the previously described vertebrate Fezf genes as
queries, we performed tBLASTN and/or BLASTP
searches against the genomes of Branchiostoma floridae
JGI v1.0, Trichoplax adhaerens Grell-BS-1999 v1.0,
Nematostella vectensis JGI v1.0, Ciona intestinalis JGI

and Capitella teleta JGI v1.0, using the JGI website
(http://genome.jgi-psf.org/euk_home.html) and of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus Build 2.1, Tribolium castaneum

Build 2.1, Nasonia vitripennis Build 1.1, Drosophila melanogaster Build Fb5.3, Homo sapiens Build GRCh37,
Mus musculus Build 37.1, Danio rerio Build Zv8, using
the NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/
Blast.cgi). For Saccoglossus kowalevskii we performed a
tBLASTN search against the traces at NCBI and then
manually assembled the genomic locus.
We then downloaded each corresponding genomic
region and build different gene models using GenomeScan [38] and GeneWise2 [39] software as necessary. We
compared these predictions with expressed sequence
tags and existent gene models when available. Annotation and comparison of intron positions and phases
across zinc finger domains was performed as previously
described [40,41].
The amino acid sequences for the zinc finger domains
were aligned using ClustalW [42] and the resulting
alignment was manually curated. Phylogenetic trees
were then generated by the Bayesian method, using the
software MrBayes 3.1.2 [43,44], with the model Dayhoff
+Gamma, recommended by ProtTest 1.4 [45-47], under
the Akaike information and the Bayesian information
criterions. Two independent runs were performed, each
with four chains. For convention, convergence was
reached when the value for the standard deviation of
split frequencies stayed below 0.01. Burn-in was determined by plotting parameters across all runs for a given
analysis: all trees before stationarity and convergence
were discarded, and consensus trees were calculated for
the remaining trees (from at least 1,000,000
generations).
Fezf box consensus was decided by the program
Sequence Logo online (http://genome.tugraz.at/Logo/)
using a multiple alignment for all studied species containing a Fezf box.
Cloning of European amphioxus Fezf, Irx and Gbx genes

Primer pairs were designed to span the whole length
coding sequences of the B. floridae Fezf [18] and Gbx
[11] genes, if possible. A liquid cDNA library from different developmental stages of the European amphioxus
(Branchiostoma lanceolatum) was screened by PCR
using the B. floridae Fezf primers. B. lanceolatum Fezf
and Gbx were cloned, sequenced and submitted to
NCBI (accession numbers HM245959, HM245960; primer sequences: Fezf_L: ATGGCAATGTTCGGA
ACCCTTG, Fezf_R: TTACTCTGCGGCTGGAAGTG,
Gbx_L: TGAAAATGCAGCGGCACAGC, Gbx_R:
ATGCTGACTCCTCATGGCGAA). For BlIrxB, we used
the previously reported full-length sequence [48]. Neural
plate expression patterns for Irx and Gbx in B. lanceolatum were consistent with those reported in B. floridae
[11,29]. To assess whether the putative SNAG domain
was included in the transcripts we used the following

Irimia et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:7

primers: GCGACGGTTCCATAATTCGT (reverse,
within the CDS) with M13F standard primer (for cDNA
library amplifications) or ATGCCAAAGTCATTTC
TGGTG (in the predicted SNAG domain) and. All
bands were cloned and sequenced. A liquid cDNA
library of B. floridae provided by G. Langeland and our
own cDNA library of B. lanceolatum were used as
templates.
In situ hybridization in the different species, antibody
staining and Drosophila strains

Antisense RNA probes were prepared from cDNAs
using digoxigenin or fluorescein (Boehringer Mannheim
GmBH, Mannheim, Germany) as labels. The Drosophila
Fezf cDNA (GH 14092) corresponding to the CG31670
was obtained from the Drosophila Genome Resources.
Xenopus specimens were prepared, hybridized and
stained as previously described [49,50]. For in situ hybridization of European amphioxus, we used a modified
version of the protocol previously described [51] (see
Additional file 1). Importantly, the hybridization temperature was 65°C, and antibodies were incubated for 3
to 4 hours, followed by overnight washes in MABT buffer (100 mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween20, pH 8) to reduce background. Detection was done
with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin
(DIG) or anti-fluorescein antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase reaction products were visualized with nitroblue
tetrazolium chloride (NBT)-5-bromo-4-chloro-3’-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt (BCIP) (purple color), 2-(4iodophenyl)-5-(4-nitro-phenyl)-3-phenyltetrazolium
chloride (INT)-BCIP (red) or BCIP only (cyan). Drosophila embryos were collected on yeasted apple juiceagar plates [52]. Pretreatment of embryos and hybridization in situ were performed as previously described [53],
with some modifications: proteinase K treatment was
avoided and incubations with anti-DIG (1:1000) were
performed for 1 hour at room temperature. For double
in situ hybridization and inmunostaining, the rabbit
anti-b-galactosidase (Cappel) antibody was incubated
with the anti-DIG. First, b-galactosidase detection was
carried out as described previously [54], then the in situ
hybridization signal was developed as described above.
The Drosophila strain used were mirr880-lacZ and the Irx
deficiency iroDFM3 [55,56]. The deficiency iroDFM3 was
balanced over the ‘blue’ balancer TM6B, P{35UZ}DB1,
Tb1 (Flybase: http://flybase.org/). Embryos were simultaneously hybridized with probes against dFezf and anti bgalactosidase transcripts, and homozygous iro DFM3
embryos were those not transcribing b-galactosidase.
Embryos were dehydrated and mounted as previously
described [57].
