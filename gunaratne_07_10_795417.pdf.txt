Abstract
Background: Mutations in the human polycystic kidney disease-1 (hPKD1) gene result in ~85% of
cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the most frequent human monogenic
disease. PKD1 proteins are large multidomain proteins involved in a variety of signal transduction
mechanisms. Obtaining more information about members of the PKD1 family will help to clarify
their functions. Humans have five hPKD1 proteins, whereas sea urchins have 10. The PKD1
proteins of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, are referred to as the Receptor for Egg
Jelly, or SpREJ proteins. The SpREJ proteins form a subfamily within the PKD1 family. They
frequently contain C-type lectin domains, PKD repeats, a REJ domain, a GPS domain, a PLAT/LH2
domain, 1–11 transmembrane segments and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain.
Results: The 10 full-length SpREJ cDNA sequences were determined. The secondary structures
of their deduced proteins were predicted and compared to the five human hPKD1 proteins. The
genomic structures of the 10 SpREJs show low similarity to each other. All 10 SpREJs are
transcribed in either embryos or adult tissues. SpREJs show distinct patterns of expression during
embryogenesis. Adult tissues show tissue-specific patterns of SpREJ expression.
Conclusion: Possession of a REJ domain of about 600 residues defines this family. Except for
SpREJ1 and 3, that are thought to be associated with the sperm acrosome reaction, the functions
of the other SpREJ proteins remain unknown. The sea urchin genome is one-fourth the size of the
human genome, but sea urchins have 10 SpREJ proteins, whereas humans have five. Determination
of the tissue specific function of each of these proteins will be of interest to those studying
echinoderm development. Sea urchins are basal deuterostomes, the line of evolution leading to the
vertebrates. The study of individual PKD1 proteins will increase our knowledge of the importance
of this gene family.

Background
The sea urchin is a model animal for cell and developmental biology and genomics. As a basal deuterostome, it
provides an out-group for the chordates, and thus insights
into vertebrate genome evolution. The genome of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sp), is onequarter the size of the human genome and encodes
~23,300 genes [1], the majority having vertebrate
orthologs. Sea urchin genes are closer to human and
mouse than to other invertebrate models such as Drosophila and C. elegans. For example, the number of reciprocal pairs of genes between sea urchin and mouse is
about 50% greater than between sea urchin and Drosophila
[1]. The sea urchin lacks four of the human kinase subfamilies, while Drosophila lacks 20 and nematodes 30
[1,2]. Regarding gene conservation, 11 of the 13 known
animal Wnt genes are present in the sea urchin [3]. The sea
urchin has ~100 demonstrated human disease gene
orthologs (Table S9, on line supplement to ref.1). The
functions of sea urchin disease gene orthologs are thus
important to human medicine.
In our study of sea urchin sperm receptor proteins that
bind egg jelly to trigger the exocytotic acrosome reaction
[4], we have described four sperm plasma membrane proteins, named Sp Receptor for Egg Jelly 1–4 (SpREJ1-4) [58]. The first of these proteins, SpREJ1, is a heavily glycosylated, 210 kDa receptor that binds the fucose sulfate
polymer of egg jelly to trigger the sperm acrosome reaction [5,9]. Monoclonal antibodies to SpREJ1 induce the
acrosome reaction and compete with the fucose sulfate
polymer [5]. SpREJ1 localizes to the plasma membrane
covering the acrosomal vesicle and to the flagellar membrane [10]. The paralog, SpREJ2, localizes to the entire
sperm plasma membrane, but is concentrated over the
mitochondrion. It is thought to be intracellular because it
does not label when intact cells are radioiodinated and it
is not glycosylated [7]. In sperm, SpREJ3 (suREJ3) is only
found in the plasma membrane over the sperm acrosomal
vesicle [6]. SpREJ4 is structurally similar to SpREJ3, but is
only found in the sperm flagellar membrane [8]. Homology searches with the four SpREJ proteins showed that
they all contain a large domain, named the "Receptor for
Egg Jelly" domain (REJ domain) that occurs in only one
gene family, the polycystic kidney disease-1 (PKD1) family, found in both protostomes [11] and vertebrates
[12,13]. The Pfam database (PF02010) defines the REJ
domain as ~600 amino acids having six conserved Cys residues. Although SpREJ proteins are PKD1 family members, we prefer to use the SpREJ designation to be
consistent with past publications [5-9].
In humans, the hPKD1 gene is expressed in many tissues
in addition to kidneys and encodes a glycoprotein of
4,303 amino acids, also called hPKD1, or polycystin-1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/235

(hPC1), much of which is extracellular and has the characteristics of a lectin-like, signal transduction molecule
[12,13]. Mutations in hPKD1 cause ~85% of the cases of
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD),
probably the most common human monogenic disease
with an incidence of > 1:1000, which is characterized by
progressive development and enlargement of cysts, resulting in end-stage renal failure [12,13]. The other ~15% of
ADPKD cases arise from mutations in hPKD2, or polycystin-2 (hPC2), a member of the TRP family that forms a
cation channel when exogenously expressed [14,15].
hPKD1 and hPKD2 proteins are associated through
coiled-coil domains in their carboxyl termini, and it is
thought that hPKD1 regulates the activity of the hPKD2
cation channel [12,13] and also chloride transporters
[16]. Recent evidence indicates that mammalian PKD1 is
a mechanoreceptor, associated with the primary cilium of
kidney tubule epithelial cells. The primary cilium senses
fluid flow in the tubule and that in turn is thought to regulate the activity of the hPKD2 channel [11,12,17,18].
In addition to hPKD1, there are four other human
orthologs: hPKDREJ, hPKD1L1, hPKD1L2 and hPKD1L3.
hPKD1 protein is found in most human tissues. The
intronless hPKDREJ is only expressed in mammalian testis
[19] and associates with several TRP channel proteins and
modulates G-protein signaling [20]. Mammalian PKDREJ,
like sea urchin SpREJ3, is found only in the plasma membrane covering the sperm acrosomal vesicle [21]. Like
hPKDREJ, SpREJ3 also associates with a sea urchin sperm
TRP channel, SpPKD2 [22]. hPKD1-like-1 (hPKD1L1) has
high expression levels in testis Leydig cells and heart [23].
hPKD1L2 is found in a long and short form, the short
form beginning in exon 12 of the long form. The short
form is expressed in heart and kidney and the long form
in brain and testis [24]. hPKD1L3 associates with the TRP
protein hPKD2L1, to form a cation channel in taste buds
for the sensation of sour [25]. hPKD1L3 does not contain
a REJ domain, but it is included in the PKD1 family
because of other PKD1 homologous domains. hPKDREJ,
and the three hPKD1L proteins all contain a cation channel domain made up by TM segments 6–11.
Searching the sea urchin genome [1] for homologs containing a REJ domain, yielded six novel SpREJ genes in
addition to the four already known SpREJ cDNA
sequences. The sequences of the six novel SpREJ cDNAs
were determined and their secondary structures predicted.
Here we compare all 10 SpREJ predicted proteins to the
five human hPKD1 family proteins. Data are also presented on the levels of expression of the 10 SpREJ genes
during embryogenesis and also in six adult sea urchin tissues.

Results
Cloning SpREJ cDNAs
Searching the sea urchin genome database with the four
known SpREJ sequences identified the six unknown
orthologs with REJ domains. All start and stop codons and
all full-length cDNA sequences were obtained experimentally. All 10 genes were completely annotated and their
major features determined (Table 1). Genome analysis
shows that all 10 SpREJ genes are single copy.
SpREJ protein features compared to human PKD1
orthologs
Protein architectures based on secondary structure predictions of the 10 SpREJ proteins and the five human PKD1
proteins are shown in Figure 1. SpREJ10 is the only one in
which a transmembrane segment (TM) is not predicted.
SpREJs 1, 8 and 9 are predicted to have one TM, SpREJ2
two TM, SpREJ7 six TM, and SpREJ3-6, and all five human
PKD1 proteins, 11 TM segments. The last six TM of
SpREJ3-6, like the hPKD1L proteins, share homology with
cation channels [12,13].

The REJ domain is found in four of the human PKD1 proteins. The fifth human PKD1 ortholog (PKD1L3) does not
possess a REJ domain, however it is classified as a PKD1
protein because of having 11 putative TM, a GPS domain
and a PLAT domain [26,27]. SpREJ8 and 9, and human
hPKD1L2, all have partial REJ domains. SpREJ7 has a split
REJ domain of 247 and 284 residues, with 428 non-REJ
residues between the two REJ sections. All the other SpREJ
proteins and hPKD1, hPKDREJ, hPKD1L1 have complete
REJ domains with all six conserved Cys residues.

Figure hPKD1 protein architectures
and PKD1
The five 1 family of proteins as exemplified by the 10 SpREJs
The PKD1 family of proteins as exemplified by the 10 SpREJs
and five hPKD1 protein architectures. The predicted secondary structures are shown. Domain boundaries were taken
from the Pfam database. The REJ domain is split into two sections in SpREJ7 and partial REJ domains occur in SpREJ8 and
9, and hPKD1L2. hPKD1L3 does not contain a REJ domain.
Most of these predicted structures show a GPS domain
upstream of transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) and a PLAT/LH2
domain immediately after the first TM.
With the exception of SpREJ10, all these predicted sea
urchin and human PKD1 family proteins contain a G-protein-coupled receptor cleavage site (GPS) upstream of the
first TM. The GPS is where the protein chain is known to
be cleaved in SpREJ3 [6] and human hPKD1 [28], yet both
halves of the protein remain associated on the cell surface.
It is assumed that all PKD1 family members are most
likely cleaved at the GPS domain. The five human proteins and five of the predicted sea urchin proteins have a
PLAT/LH2 domain (polycystin-1, lipoxygenase, alphatoxin domain, also called a lipoxygenase homology 2
domain) immediately following the first TM [26,27]. The
PLAT domain is always found intracellularly and supports
the topology shown in Figure 1.

SpREJ2 is the only sea urchin protein that experimental
data suggests is mainly intracellular because it is not
labeled by vectoral radioiodination of the sperm surface
and it does not appear to be glycosylated [7]. SpREJ1
becomes heavily labeled by vectoral iodination and it is
50% carbohydrate [5,10,29]. SpREJ2 and 7 are the only
SpREJ proteins predicted to have both N- and C-termini
on the same side of a membrane. Although only SpREJ4,
6 and 7 are predicted to have C-terminal coiled coils, all
five human proteins show this motif that is involved in
protein-protein interaction.
Carbohydrate recognition domains of ~120 amino acids
(C-type lectin domains) are found in SpREJ1, 2, 3 and
hPKD1 and hPKD1L2. There is one EGF domain in
SpREJ1 [5], and one sea urchin egg lectin domain (SUEL)
in SpREJ3 [6] and hPKD1L2. "PKD" repeats (50–70 residues) are found in SpREJ2-7 and 10 and hPKD1,
hPKD1L1 and hPKD1L2. SpREJ6, 7 and 10 and human
hPKD1 contain a WSC domain, which was originally
identified in yeast cell wall integrity and stress response
proteins [30]. In SpREJ9, there is a serine-rich region close
to the N-terminus from Ser173 to Ser284 and Ser528 to Ser694
composed of 76% Ser residues. Hydropathy analysis
shows that a signal sequence is present in all five human
proteins and all SpREJs except SpREJ5. Multiple attempts
to experimentally obtain a signal sequence for SpREJ5
failed. Furthermore, one could not be found in the predicted gene model.
Construction of phylogenetic trees using full-length
sequences of the 10 sea urchin and five human proteins
yielded branch nodes with low statistical support. The
same negative results were obtained when only the REJ
domains were used to construct trees. The only consistent
trend was that SpREJ 3 and 4 branched close to hPKDREJ.
Gene structure
The intron and exon numbers and scaffold positions of
the 10 SpREJ genes were determined (Table 1). SpREJ1 is
in three segments in two scaffolds, while SpREJ2 is in five
scaffolds, thus with the current assembly it is difficult to
compare these two genes. The REJ domains of these two
proteins are 82% identical. Similarity in the downstream
portions of SpREJ3 and 4 is clearly evident, as it is in the
upstream portions of SpREJ5 compared to 6, and SpREJ8
compared to 9. Table 1 gives the number of exons per
gene, total residues and predicted molecular masses of
these proteins. The genomic sequence of SpREJ7 has 52
exons, which makes it the largest of the SpREJs. The low
similarity of intron/exon numbers and lengths suggests
that the duplication and subsequence differentiation of
these genes is ancient.

Expression of SpREJ genes in developing embryos
The expression of the 10 SpREJs at different embryonic
stages was investigated using real-time quantitative PCR
(Figure 2). Previous work on S. purpuratus showed that the
ubiquitin transcript (SpUbi) levels are constant during
early development, so that other transcripts can be normalized to ubiquitin (31). Under our experimental conditions, the expression of SpREJ1 and 6 were not detectable
in early embryos. SpREJ2 is most abundant in eggs and
decreases ~6-fold by 41 hours and then remains constant
to 65 hours. SpREJ3 is also highest in eggs, but decreases
about 60% to constant levels by 22 hours. SpREJ4 expression remains fairly constant from 0 to 65 hours. SpREJ5,
7, 9 and 10 show substantial increases in transcript
number during development. SpREJ8 is the only one that
increases sharply from 0 to 22 hours and then decreases
sharply from 22 to 65 hours. Of all ten SpREJ transcripts,
the greatest abundances are seen for SpREJ8 at 22 hours
and SpREJ9 at 65 hours.
Expression of SpREJ genes in adult sea urchin tissues
RT-Q-PCR was used to determine the expression of SpREJ
genes in six adult tissues (Figure 3). Testis, ovary, muscle/
test (calcareous skeleton), gut, lantern (jaw muscles and
ligaments) and coelomocytes (immunocytes in the body
cavity fluid) were the six tissues that can be visibly separated from each other for RNA extraction. The range of
ubiquitin transcript number is not known for adult tissues. Our data show that ubiquitin transcripts range from
approximately 1.7 million per 100 ng total RNA in ovary,
to 3.2 million per 100 ng RNA in coelomocytes. This
might be expected because coelomocytes are highly
phagocytic cells. Ubiquitin transcript levels are fairly similar in testis, gut, lantern and ovary. With the caveat
regarding ubiquitin transcript levels stated, we did normalize the SpREJ transcript levels to ubiquitin. Relative to
the other SpREJ transcripts, SpREJ1 is highly expressed
only in testis [5] and the same is true for SpREJ6 expression in muscle/test. SpREJ1, 4, 6 and 10 have relatively
low expression in adult ovary. SpREJ2, 3,6, 7 and 9 show
low expression in coelomocytes. SpREJ6 is the only SpREJ
that is weakly expressed in testis. To generalize, with the
exception of SpREJ1 in testis and SpREJ6 in muscle/test,
most SpREJ genes are expressed in easily measurable levels
in these adult tissues. Each adult tissue shows a tissue-specific pattern of expression of the 10 SpREJ transcripts.

Discussion
Whole genome sequences of model organisms permit the
discovery of gene families involved in human disease. The
sea urchin genome contains ~100 human disease gene
orthologs (1). The functions of many of these orthologs
remain unknown. Genome analysis of lower deuterostomes identifies disease gene orthologs for future functional studies. In this report we describe the sea urchin

Expression of SpREJ transcripts during embryogenesis
Expression of SpREJ transcripts during embryogenesis. Transcripts of SpREJ1 and 6 could not be detected in embryos. Transcript copy numbers per 100 ng of starting total RNA at each developmental stage for 8 SpREJs were first calculated. Transcript copy numbers were calculated from a standard curve generated in the same run and were normalized to the level of
ubiquitin (SpUbi) transcripts at each developmental time. Final numbers are the averages of three replicas. There are about
50,000 transcripts per 100 ng total RNA of SpREJ8 at 22 hours of development. The standard error of each data point is shown
(n = 3). Horizontal axes are hours of development at 16°C.

SpREJ gene family that are members of the larger PKD1
gene family, whose mutations in humans are associated
with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
SpREJ proteins are a subset of the PKD1 family because of
possession of REJ, GPS and PLAT/LH2 domains. Our
interest in the SpREJ proteins came from the observation
that monoclonal antibodies to SpREJ1 increased intracellular calcium and induced the sea urchin sperm acrosome
reaction [5]. When the protein sequence of SpREJ1 was
deduced, the REJ domain appeared to match only one
other protein, which was hPKD1. SpREJ2-4 were discovered next, 3 and 4 having 11TM and being similar to

hPKD1 and hPKDREJ, whereas, SpREJ1 and 2 lacked this
large TM domain and had either one or two TM. SpREJ13 are the only SpREJ proteins with CRDs. Sequencing the
CRDs from six species shows that these lectin domains are
subjected to positive Darwinian selection [32], indicating
that they are probably important in gamete recognition
[33]. hPKD1L2 and 1L3 each contain one CRD, but carbohydrate ligands binding these proteins remain unknown.
The other sugar binding domain found in these proteins
is the single sea urchin egg lectin domain (SUEL) in
SpREJ3 and hPKD1L2. The SUEL lectin in the sea urchin
egg has specificity for galactose [34].

hPKD1 is involved in mechanotransduction, regulation of
cell growth, cell spreading and differentiation [12,13].
Four hPKD1 proteins and four SpREJ proteins contain cation channel domains. There are no experimental data for
possible functions of the SpREJ5-10 proteins. To generalize, PKD1 family proteins are large transmembrane glycoproteins, which bind to smaller proteins to regulate signal
transduction pathways and ion channel activities. SpREJ14 are definitely sperm plasma membrane proteins that are
concentrated in different parts of the sea urchin sperm [58,10]. However, the membrane compartments of SpREJ510 in gametes, embryos and adult tissues remain
unknown. With the exception of SpREJ10, all SpREJ and
hPKD1 proteins have putative TM helices.
"PKD repeats", which are 50–70 residues and have similarity to the immunoglobulin fold, are present in some of
the sea urchin and human proteins. hPKD1 has 16 PKD
repeats, 15 of them in tandem. With the exception of
hPKD1L3, all human and sea urchin proteins have either
complete or partial REJ domains. The SpREJ and PKD1

family proteins are the only proteins known to contain
both PKD repeats and REJ domains. Experimental work
suggests that PKD repeats and REJ domains might have
the same function in allowing the force mediated, reversible unfolding of these domains, permitting extension
and retraction of the external portions of these enormous
proteins as they link to the surfaces of other cells [35]. This
research used single molecule atomic force spectroscopy
to show that application of a stretching force to one
hPKD1 molecule resulted in the unfolding, one at a time,
of the PKD repeats. Releasing the stretching force allowed
the repeats to refold. The same phenomenon was found
for the REJ domain of hPKD1, the data indicating that the
unfolding of the REJ domain occurred in approximately
10 steps. Homology modeling suggests that there are 10
folded fibronectin-III domains within the REJ domain of
hPKD1 [35]. In addition to a putative function in making
SpREJ and PKD1 proteins capable of great elasticity, the
REJ domain is also known to be required for cleavage of
hPKD1 in the GPS domain, a process necessary to make a
functional hPKD1 [28].

This study is the first to show the developmental expression of SpREJ in sea urchin embryos. SpREJ1 and 6 transcripts could not be found in embryos at our level of
detection, indicating that these two proteins are probably
not important for early development. SpREJ2 may be
important during oogenesis, but remains at lower than
unfertilized egg levels during development (Figure 2).
SpREJ3 and 4 transcripts are also higher in eggs than in
embryos. SpREJ5, 7, 9 and 10 transcripts show dramatic
increases after 22 hours of development, suggesting that
they are important for development of the gastrula, prism
and pluteus stages. SpREJ8 transcripts are low in unfertilized eggs, increase to 22 hours and then decrease thereafter, suggesting that this protein is important for blastula
formation. Future work on SpREJ proteins will involve in
situ hybridization and antibodies to localize these transcripts and their proteins at different developmental
stages.
RT-Q-PCR analysis of adult tissue expression of SpREJ
transcripts indicates that, relative to the other SpREJs,
SpREJ1 and 6 have dramatically high tissue-specific
expression patterns (Figure 3). SpREJ6 is the only SpREJ
with relatively low expression levels in testis. It was previously shown that SpREJ1 is localized in the plasma membrane covering the acrosome vesicle and flagella of sea
urchin spermatozoa, but its expression in nongametic
cells of the testis has not been studied. To generalize,
except for SpREJ1 in testis, and SpREJ6 in muscle/test,
most adult tissues contain easily detectable levels of SpREJ
transcripts. Study of muscle/test preparations may reveal
important functions of SpREJ proteins.
The sea urchin genome is 814 megabases (1), whereas the
human is 3200 megabases. That the sea urchin has 10
SpREJ genes, while the human has five, shows either that
humans lost ancestral PKD1 orthologs, or conversely, sea
urchins gained new SpREJ genes. All five hPKD1 proteins
have 11 TM, whereas only four of the SpREJ proteins have
11 TM. The unusual secondary structure predictions of
SpREJ7-10 make them interesting candidate proteins for
further study. SpREJ7 is odd in having six putative TM and
a split REJ domain. SpREJ8 and 9 with only one putative
TM, have no homology to any known domain upstream
from their partial REJ domains. SpREJ9 also has the
extremely Ser rich region close to the N-terminus.
SpREJ10 is the oddest one in having a REJ domain, but no
TM segments. Interestingly, all the genes encoding these
proteins are transcribed in embryos or adult tissues. Continued studies of these novel SpREJ genes and their proteins may aid in discovering generalities about their
functions.

Conclusion
The sea urchin contains 10 SpREJ genes that are within the
PKD1 gene family. All 10 are transcribed in either
embryos or adult tissues. From amino- to carboxyl-termini, these SpREJ proteins usually contain: PKD repeats,
a REJ domain, a GPS domain, a PLAT/LH2 domain and
from 1–11 transmembrane segments. The predicted secondary structures of SpREJ7-10 are very different from
other SpREJ/PKD1 proteins. Their future study may help
define the multiply functions of the PKD1 family proteins.

Methods
Cloning and sequence analysis
The four known SpREJ cDNAs were used to search the sea
urchin genome to find the six novel SpREJ gene models
with REJ domains. Primers specific for each SpREJ were
made using the six gene models and PCR reactions performed using Strongylocentrotus purpuratus testis, egg and
embryo cDNAs as templates. The cDNA sequences were
extended by 5' and 3' RACE (First Choice RLM kit,
Ambion) and by gene walking with specific primers. PCR
products were cloned into pCR 4-TOPO (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California) and sequenced with gene specific
primers. All cDNAs were prepared from total RNA by
standard methods. The full-length sequences and start
and stop codons of all 10 SpREJ cDNAs were experimentally determined. The copy number, length and number of
exons/introns of each gene were determined using the S.
purpuratus BAC plus WGS assembly version 2.0, of June
15, 2006 [36]. CLUSTALW (MacVector) was used to make
nucleotide alignments. Domains were predicted from
protein BLAST searches using the combination of NCBI
[37] and EMBL-EBI [38] websites.

All sequences described in this paper have the following
GenBank accession numbers: SpREJ1, NM214608;
SpREJ2, NM214637; SpREJ3, NM214636; SpREJ4,
AY620398; SpREJ5, DQ988048; SpREJ6, DQ988049;
SpREJ7, DQ988050; SpREJ8, EF216328 ; SpREJ9,
EF203419; and SpREJ10; EF203420. Human hPKD1 family GenBank accession numbers are: hPKD1, U24497;
hPKDREJ, AF116458; hPKD1L1, NM138295; hPKD1L2,
NM052892; and hPKD1L3, AY164485. Detailed annotation of SpREJ genes can be obtained from the sea urchin
genome project website [39] (to access the SpREJ annotation page, select "common gene name", type "REJ" in the

Preparation of cDNAs from embryos and adult tissues
Adult tissues were separated by dissecting sea urchins and
samples were dissolved in RLT buffer (RNAeasy Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, California). Gametes were spawned by
injecting adults with 0.5 M KCl. Embryos were cultured at
0.25% v/v suspension, with constant 60 rpm stirring at

16°C in Millipore filtered seawater. Embryos were collected by hand centrifugation and 100 µl of packed
embryo pellet dissolved in RLT buffer and total RNA
extracted. RNA was quantified by absorption at 260 nm.
Synthesis of cDNA was performed with 2 µg of total RNA
using the SuperScript II polymerase and oligo (dT)12 -18
primers by standard procedures (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 µl.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Forward (f) and reverse (r) primers were designed to
amplify all 10 SpREJs cDNAs as follows (5' to 3'): SpREJ1f,
CGATCTGGAAACAGAAGGAG and SpREJ1r, GATGGTTTGTGATGGACCAC (463 bp product); SpREJ2f, GGTCCATCACAAACCATCTATCAGG
and
SpREJ2r,
GATTGGCTATGAAGCAGGAGTCC (306 bp product);
SpREJ3f, TGGAGTTTGCTGCTGCTATGC and SpREJ3r,
CGAACACTGTGCTTGACCATTG (272 bp product);
SpREJ4f, TGACCGTCCTGGAGAGCATTAC and SpREJ4r,
CCTGGGATTGAAAGGCAAGTC (224 bp product);
SpREJ5f, TGTTCTACAGCAAGACCCGTCG and SpREJ5r,
CCACGATGAGATTAGCAGGGAAC (279 bp product);
SpREJ6f, ACCACTCATTGTCGTCATTAGCG and SpREJ6r,
TGGCATCAAGTCTTAGGGCTCC (290 bp product);
SpREJ7f,
CAATCACACCTTTACGGAAGTTGG
and
SpREJ7r, GCTGATGGGCTCCTGCACTAACAG (382 bp
product), SpREJ8f, CCCGACAGTGAAAATGAAGAGATG
and SpREJ8r, CCAGACTTGGAAAGGATGGTGAC (251 bp
product); SpREJ9f, TGCGAACAGACGGATGACAAC and
SpREJ9r, CCTGAAGTGGTATCAACAGTGGC (350 bp
product); SpREJ10f, TGAAGCAGTTGTTGTCTCCAGATG
and SpREJ10r, CAGCATAGAGCAGAGGTAAGCAGTC
(324 bp product); Ubi-f, CGAGTATTTGCCAGATGTGAACCC and Ubi-r, ATTGGATTTTTTGCCCCTGC (233
bp product) for Sp-ubiquitin (GenBank accession number
M61772). These primer pairs were used to PCR amplify
cDNA prepared from adult tissues and embryos. To construct standard curves, gel purified (Qiagen) template
cDNA quantities were prepared by serial dilution. RT-QPCR was performed on a LightCycler II (Roche) instrument with LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR
Green I reagents (Roche). Triplicate dilutions (5, 25 and
50-fold) (for embryonic expression experiments) and
duplicate dilutions (1 and 10-fold) (tissue expression
experiment) of template cDNA from each unknown were
added at 5 µl/reaction (total volume 20 µl). The quantities
of the unknowns, obtained in either triplicate or duplicate, were analyzed individually and then determined
from the standard curve. Variations among developmental stages were corrected by normalization to ubiquitin.
Adult tissue data were also normalized to ubiquitin with
the caveat that the constancy of ubiquitin transcripts in
adult tissues is unknown. The specificity of each RTQ-PCR
product was assayed by a melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis.
