Abstract
Background: Alternative splicing (AS) is a primary mechanism of functional regulation in the
human genome, with 60% to 80% of human genes being alternatively spliced. As part of the bovine
genome annotation team, we have analysed 4567 bovine AS genes, compared to 16715 human and
16491 mouse AS genes, along with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. We also analysed the two most
important events, cassette exons and intron retention in 94 human disease genes and mapped them
to the bovine orthologous genes. Of the 94 human inherited disease genes, a protein domain
analysis was carried out for the transcript sequences of 12 human genes that have orthologous
genes and have been characterised in cow.
Results: Of the 21,755 bovine genes, 4,567 genes (21%) are alternatively spliced, compared to
16,715 (68%) in human and 16,491 (57%) in mouse. Gene-level analysis of the orthologous set
suggested that bovine genes show fewer AS events compared to human and mouse genes. A detailed
examination of cassette exons across human and cow for 94 human disease genes, suggested that a
majority of cassette exons in human were present and constitutive in bovine as opposed to intron
retention which exhibited 50% of the exons as present and 50% as absent in cow. We observed that
AS plays a major role in disease implications in human through manipulations of essential/functional
protein domains. It was also evident that majority of these 12 genes had conservation of all essential
domains in their bovine orthologous counterpart, for these human diseases.
Conclusion: While alternative splicing has the potential to create many mRNA isoforms from a
single gene, in cow the majority of genes generate two to three isoforms, compared to six in human
and four in mouse. Our analyses demonstrated that a smaller number of bovine genes show greater
transcript diversity. GO definitions for bovine AS genes provided 38% more functional information
than currently available in the sequence database. Our protein domain analysis helped us verify the
suitability of using bovine as a model for human diseases and also recognize the contribution of AS
towards the disease phenotypes.

Background
Protein diversity in eukaryotic genomes is mainly
credited to alternative splicing (AS). It is a fundamental
mechanism by which a single pre-mRNA can produce
more than one transcript. It is also considered by many
to be an important mechanism for controlling gene
expression [1]. The introns in the pre-mRNA are spliced
out and the exons are united in different combinations
leading to a change in the primary transcript structure.
This change in transcript structure can affect the encoded
protein thereby disrupting its structure and also its
function. The disruption in the protein structure and
function brought about by AS are frequently associated
with diseases [2]. Results from previous studies indicate
that more than 60% of human genes are alternatively
spliced [3-9].
Association of AS with many diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders sheds light
on the fact that it is crucial to conduct an in-depth study
on AS [10]. Analyses have also shown that 15% of point
mutations that cause genetic disease affect pre-mRNA
splicing [10], providing a link between AS events and
inherited genetic diseases.
Large scale sequencing of eukaryotic genomes and the
knowledge of AS being an important player in controlling gene regulation has seen the emergence of several
efforts [3-9] to create bioinformatics resources on
alternative transcripts and protein isoforms [11]. Conflicting results from previous analyses aiming to compare
the rate of alternative splicing between different organisms contradict AS databases who discuss genome-wide
computational analysis. All vertebrates and invertebrates
showed a similar rate of alternative splicing with respect
to both the number of genes affected and the number of
variants per gene in a large-scale expressed sequence tag
(EST) analysis across distinct eukaryotes by Brett and
coworkers [12]. On the contrary considerable variation
in the rates of alternative splicing across organisms was
reported by Lee and co-workers [5]. Understanding the
phenomenon of AS is difficult as these databases do not
provide sufficient information for multi-gene comparison across various species. ASAP II [5] concentrates
mainly on comparative and evolutionary studies.
ECGene [9] provides functional annotation for AS
genes in various genomes. Alternative Splicing Transcript
Database (ASTD) [3,4] does an exhaustive analysis of AS
events in three species, namely human, mouse and rat.
Representing the transcripts and their relation to each
other has become extremely complicated due to the
increasing number of transcripts for each gene. This has
seen the dawn graph theory and its application to
represent a gene transcript. Graph theory is a prominent
concept that has been used to express transcripts and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S11

capture their relation, among many other solutions. The
language of graph theory offers a mathematical abstraction for the description of biological relationships [13].
Modrek and Lee used directed acyclic graphs for EST
analysis, with the genomic DNA sequence as reference
[14]. Pevzner and coworkers [15] were the first to use de
Bruijn graphs to depict the transcripts alone, without
referring to the genomic DNA sequence, where the
maximum common sub-sequences between transcripts
were condensed into nodes and the variable regions
connected by edges. Alternative Splicing Gallery (ASG)
resource uses such an approach [7].
Our group has used directed acyclic splicing graphs,
without a genomic DNA sequence as reference, with
exons as nodes, interconnected by introns as edges,
where the paths through the splicing graph represents
the transcripts. This scheme was applied to the genomewide analysis of Drosophila melanogaster [6], leading to
the DEDB data resource. Here, the first transcript served
as a reference sequence to generate splicing graphs, with
automatic rule-based classification of splicing events. To
reduce the uncertainty in selecting the primary transcript,
this methodology was further enhanced. The most
conserved exons in all transcripts of a given gene were
chosen to be distinct reference exons and all others were
considered to be variant exons. In order to generate a
splicing graph from a set of transcripts for a given gene,
we thereby developed the Alternative Splicing Graph
Server (ASGS) [8].
As a part of the bovine genome annotation team, we
have used comparative genomics in order to associate
alternative splicing patterns in human and mouse to cow
[16]. Comparative genomics studies the correlation
between genome structures and functions across different biological species. It aims at understanding many
aspects of the evolution of modern species.
The intermediate evolutionary distance between human
and bovine is 70-100 Myr [17]. The bovine model has
been found to be relevant to human health research
priorities such as obesity, female health and communicable diseases. Cow provides a valuable biological model
in these significant areas because of the vast amount of
research that has been conducted with respect to genetic
and environmental interactions associated with complex, multi-genic physiological traits [18]. The Cetartiodactyl order of mammals, to which cattle and all other
ruminants belong, is phylogenetically distant from the
primates, and thus contains invaluable information for
understanding human genome evolution [19].
In this study, we have analysed transcripts for each gene
in the bovine genome. Since the bovine genome is not

yet completely annotated we minimized any gene
structure bias in the input data by carrying out
comparative genome analysis on the orthologous subset
of AS genes for the three species. We present here the
comprehensive analysis of all bovine, human and mouse
transcripts based on splicing graphs. AS events in these
three genomes and their functional significance in terms
of gene ontology (GO) [20] classifications were also
identified. The two main AS events (cassette exons and
intron retention) in the human disease genes (94) from
NCBI Genes and Disease database [21] were mapped
onto their respective bovine orthologous genes. A
protein domain analysis on 12 human disease genes
that are known to be occurring in cow was vital in
providing significant insights into the protein structure/
function affects of AS.

Materials and methods
Data
For AS analysis, the GTF files for Bos taurus, Homo sapiens
and Mus musculus were extracted from Ensembl ver. 54
[22]. Each line in the Gene Transfer Format (GTF) [23]
file corresponds to the structure of the exons making up
the transcripts, coding sequence, start codon and stop
codon information. For our analysis, we extracted only
the protein coding genes and eliminated the pseudo
genes and mitochondrial genes. The unspliced transcript
sequences were also obtained from Ensembl for cow to
analyse the splice site motifs.
Splicing graphs
The procedure used in ASGS [8] has been adopted for
compiling the graphs. The transcript information,
including start and stop of each exon are compiled
from the GTF file for each of the three genomes to
generate the splicing graph. All transcripts are converted
to the leading strand for consistency. Exons are divided
into two main groups; distinct and variant. The exon that
occurs in the majority of transcripts is retained as the
distinct exon, with the rest classified as variant. When
exons overlap, the exons with well-determined borders,
occurring in most of the transcripts is considered to be
distinct. If an exon is completely contained in another
larger exon, these are not merged but retained as
individual exons, considered variant and then entered
into a list maintaining the mapping of variant exons to
distinct exons [24]. Splicing graphs are then generated
using these distinct and variant exons. The first line of
the resultant splicing graph is composed entirely of
distinct exons, followed by subsequent lines showing the
locations of variable exons. The exons are connected by
edges, representing introns in the set of transcripts
provided. Splicing graphs were compiled for every
alternatively spliced gene for the three genomes. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S11

splicing graphs were then further analysed to identify the
splicing events and patterns for orthologous genes.
Detection and classification of alternative splicing events
and patterns
We have analysed nine alternative splicing events
namely, cassette exons, intron retention, alternative
donor sites, alternative acceptor sites, alternative transcriptional start and termination sites, alternative initiation and termination exons and mutually exclusive
exons. Figure 1 defines the rules to locate each of the
nine events and these rules were applied to generate the
splicing graphs. This classification schema has been
previously described in DEDB [6] and incorporated into
ASGS [8] for the identification of the splicing events.
5âand 3âends of the transcripts are usually difficult to
determine experimentally due to sequencing errors
which could cause anomalies in the analysis of
alternative transcriptional start and termination sites
[6]. The other internal AS events, however, are not
affected by these sequencing errors. Two types of
analyses namely gene level and event level were carried
out. The percentage of total events present in each
AS event

genome for the orthologous genes is portrayed by the
event level analysis. The gene level analysis calculates the
percentage of all AS genes and orthologous AS genes
showing each of the events for the three genomes.
Splicing graphs have been made more informative to
help identify distinct and associated variant exons by
visual representation of distinct (D) exons in black and
variant (V) exons as blue. AS events can therefore be
depicted using a minimum of four sub-graph components called splicing patterns. Figure 2 depicts the four
unique sub-graphs Class I (D-D), Class II (D-V), Class III
(V-D) and Class IV (V-V). The fundamental definition of
transcript diversity is given by a detailed analysis of the
relationship of each exon to its successor, designated as a
splicing pattern.
Qualitative and quantitative analysis of exons and introns
Basic statistical measures like the mean, median and
standard deviation were calculated for all three genomes
in order to analyse the exon and intron size conservation
across the three genomes for the complete and orthologous AS gene sets. The number of exons per transcript for
the three genomes was also calculated.
Splice site motif analysis
Splice site mutations are believed to cause several genetic
diseases. It is therefore very important to identify
variations in the splice site. The frequencies of GT-AG,

defined, depending on connections between distinct exons

Classes II and III depict connections between a distinct exon
and a variant exon and vice-versa.

GC-AG, AT-AC splice site motifs were computed for
bovine and analysed and compared to the splice site
information for human and mouse obtained from ASTD.
GO annotation
Analysis of the GO annotations was conducted for two
sets of data. In the first set, the transcript sequences of
orthologous bovine AS genes obtained from Ensembl
were processed using ESTScan, as it can detect and extract
coding regions from low quality sequences with high
selectivity and sensitivity and is also able to accurately
correct frame shift errors [25]. To obtain even datasets,
the human and mouse transcript sequences were also
processed using ESTScan. The output was then processed
using another bioinformatics tool, Blast2GO [26], which
we have successfully used in the annotation of expressed
sequence tag sequences [27]. The BLAST results from this
program were then mapped to GO terms to obtain the
GO annotation. The annotation output file was then
processed using a plotting tool, WEGO [28] in tool to
compile the GO annotation results into category-based
lists.

The second dataset was a text file comprising GO
annotations for bovine AS genes orthologous to
human and mouse AS genes, obtained from Ensembl
using the BioMart [29] tool. The second dataset was
reformatted and put through the WEGO tool to compile
the GO annotation results for plotting.
Mapping of human disease genes to
bovine orthologous genes
A well-annotated set of all available (94) human disease
genes was extracted from NCBI Genes and Disease
database [21], with the view towards analysing which
of these genes were alternatively spliced in human and
bovine genomes. Of these 94 genes, AS analysis was
conducted on the 66 spliced genes (with more than one
transcript). The two most important events, cassette exon
and intron retention, were examined in detail in these 66
genes. These exons were then mapped onto the
orthologous exons in bovine using CLUSTALX [30]
multiple sequence alignment tool to identify the conservation of these exons and the splicing event, across the
two species. Irrespective of the position of the exons in
different transcripts, if two pairs of exons have a good
percentage of alignment they are still considered as
conserved exons, thereby implying that in the event of
exon shuffling, the exon pairs are still considered
conserved.
Protein domain analysis of the orthologous disease gene set
We identified eight human disease genes that have
bovine orthologues. The protein sequences encoded by

BMC Genomics 2009, 10(Suppl 3):S11

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S11

the transcripts for these human and bovine genes were
analyzed using Pfam [31] domain search tool to identify
the effects of alternative splicing on the functional
protein domains.

Results and discussion
It was observed that only 21% of bovine genes were
alternatively spliced as opposed to 68% of genes in
human and 57% of genes in mouse upon comparison of
4567 bovine AS genes with 16715 human AS genes and
16491 mouse AS genes. The statistics provided by ASAP
II database (26%, 53%, 53% for cow, mouse and human
respectively) [5] compare well to these estimates of the
number of AS genes in cow, mouse and human,
although they appear almost twice as much as those
reported by Nagasaki and group [32] (32.1% and 23%
for human and mouse genomes, respectively). All AS
genes in cow which have alternatively spliced orthologues in both human and mouse were extracted to
minimize any gene structure bias and to get the bestannotated genes in cow for analysis. Such an approach
has been adopted by the studies of Chen et al [33]. In
order to compile the orthologous genes subset, one-toone, many-to-many, one-to-many and apparent mappings have been used. We found that 3504 genes in cow
have alternatively spliced orthologues in human and
mouse amounting to 3835 and 3774 genes respectively.
This dataset amounted to 16% of bovine alternatively
spliced genes, compared to 16% in human and 13% in
mouse. Our values are consistent with those (10%)
observed by Brett et al. [12] for AS between human and
other species, including mouse and cow reinstating the
credibility of our approach of using orthologous AS gene
subsets for multi-species comparisons and to estimate
the extent of AS in cow.
Qualitative and quantitative analysis of exons and introns
Compared to 8.0 and 6.5 transcripts per gene in human
and mouse respectively, our results indicate that bovine
AS genes are represented by 2.3 transcripts per gene on

average. Overall, bovine AS genes show less transcript
diversity compared to human and mouse AS genes as
indicated by these numbers which are quite similar to
those in the orthologous gene set as well. General
statistical characteristics of the intron-exon structure of
eukaryotic genomes are invaluable for understanding the
structure and evolution of genes and genomes. Deutsch
and Long [34] estimated that each gene comprises 5.0
exons of mean length 51 nt separated by introns of mean
length 3413 nt; and 4.4 exons of mean length 52 nt
separated by introns of mean length 1321 nt for human
and mouse genes, respectively, using available gene
structure information on ten model organisms. We
found that each bovine transcript comprises close to 13
exons of mean length 181 nt, separated by introns of
mean length 5215 nt, while human and mouse
transcripts comprise close to 8 and 7 exons, respectively,
of mean length 178 and 160 nt, respectively; separated
by introns averaging 5314 and 4311 nt, respectively
(Table 1). While all three transcriptomes are composed
of exons and introns of similar size, bovine AS genes are
more fragmented than human and mouse AS genes since
these numbers are again similar to those obtained for the
orthologous AS gene set.
Splicing graphs
We generated a total of 4567 bovine, 16715 human and
16491 mouse splicing graphs. The transcript structure of
each multi-transcript gene for all three genomes was
compiled using the splicing graph approach [8]. The
splicing graphs were further decomposed into component splicing patterns (as described in Materials and
methods). It was noted that 2485 bovine genes are single
exonic genes. It is possible to verify all the splicing events
from the splicing graphs thereby suggesting that it could
be utilised as an excellent visual analysis tool. One such
splicing graph of Myc responsible for causing the disease
Burkitt Lymphoma is shown in Figure 3. It can be easily
seen from Figure 3 that the gene has two different
transcripts.

that majority of the genes in cow (59%-64%) have
cassette exons, with 19%-20% of the genes having intron
retention. Very few genes exhibited mutually exclusive
exons (3%-4%). Figure 4 clearly shows that fewer bovine
genes exhibit AS events than that of those in human and
mouse. The values for both the datasets of all three
genomes is tabulated in Table 2.

Alternative splicing events and patterns
The nine AS events discussed above have been identified
in the orthologous set for bovine genome and are
compared to those in human and mouse. Equation 1
was used to calculate the % of genes showing each AS
event in each of the three genomes for the gene level
analysis.

The first four AS event categories in Figure. 4, refer to
splicing events at the ends of a gene, while the remaining
five represent internal events. The results of our gene
level analysis highlight that most of the genes showed
external events. As suggested earlier the high percentage
for transcriptional start and termination sites events
could be the result of sequencing errors. We observed

Considerable conservation was observed in each of the
nine AS events for the three species. Our analysis proves
that exon skipping or cassette exon is the most prevalent
internal AS event in the orthologous genes of all three
species, comprising 28%, 26% and 16% of all AS events
in bovine, human and mouse, respectively. On the other
hand, intron retention and mutually exclusive exons
were the least favoured AS events. Intron retention
accounted for only 3% of bovine AS events, compared to
3% in human and 2% in mouse. Haussler and coworkers [35] estimated 38% exon skipping and 3%
intron retention in human, which are very similar to our
values. ASD [3,4] reports 52% cassette exons and 17%
intron retention, which differ considerably from our
calculations. This could however be due to the fact that
ASD has used the entire human genome for their
calculations whereas we have only utilized orthologous
AS genes for our analysis.
Overall, from the two sets of analyses, fewer bovine genes
show equivalent % of AS events compared to human and
mouse, which implies that these orthologous AS genes in
cow show high variation between the transcripts structure, despite low number of actually different transcripts
as opposed to human and mouse genes.

It should be noted that each AS gene contains several
events. The distribution of each event compared to the
total number of AS events observed in the orthologous
set of the three genomes represent the event level
analysis as shown in Equation 2. (Table 3, Figure 5).

Figure 4
Distribution of AS events - gene level analysis for
bovine, human and mouse orthologous AS genes.
Nine events, described in Figure 1, were used to classify the
observed AS phenomena based on the number of genes
displaying these events, as shown in Table 2.

The splicing pattern analysis was done for the orthologous AS genes by calculating the percentage of the four
classes in the splicing pattern to determine the exact
nature of the transcript diversity. Among all the patterns
described above we observe that Class I (DistinctDistinct) patterns have the highest occurrence (70%)
(Table 4 and Figure 6). Class IV (Variable-Variable) is
over-represented (13%) in bovine genes compared to
human (5%) and mouse (6%). The diversity in bovine
AS genes is thus predominantly composed of edges
linking two variable exons, as opposed to human and

GO analysis of orthologous gene sets
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was carried out for all
three organisms on the orthologous AS gene set where
the GO categories were selected based on the work done
by Chen et al [33]. The transcript sequences for the
orthologous AS genes of human, mouse and bovine
were analyzed. It was observed that the overall GO
categories for all the three species were very similar
(Table 6 and Figure 7). In the area of molecular
function, the highest functionality was observed for
âbindingâ in all three species. In terms of biological

process, âcellular processesâ was the preferred category,
while for cellular component, âcell partâ was most
popular. This high similarity in functionality could
reflect the common lineage of bovine, human and
mouse, as mammalian.

Splicing pattern distribution in the orthologous
bovine, human and mouse alternatively spliced
genes. Statistics on four component splicing patterns have
been complied, with the transcript diversity index defined as
the fraction of all patterns involving variant exons.

However, a similar plot was also created for the bovine
genome, using a different set of annotations, where the
entire GO details were obtained from Ensembl using the
BioMart tool [28]. This analysis showed considerably
low percentage for bovine as opposed to the previous
plot. This, we believe can be a result of low level of
annotation available for bovine genes. In this plot, a
considerable drop in functionality was noticed across all
the areas for bovine genome (Table 6 and Figure 7).
Therefore, we were able to identify 38% more functional
information in terms of GO annotations than currently
available in Ensembl for bovine genes.

Mapping of human disease genes to bovine orthologous
genes
The use of farm animals like cattle, pigs, sheep, goats,
horses and chickens as research models has won many
Nobel Prizes for researchers worldwide [36]. Various
new opportunities in areas of biomedical research have
been created by the application of the tools for genetic
manipulation and genomic sequencing in farm animals
[16]. This provides valuable insights into gene function
and genetic and environmental influences on animal
production and human diseases [36]. Because of the size
and relatively long intervals between generations,
domestic species are widely used to unravel the
mechanisms involved in programming the development
of an embryo and fetus, resulting in adult onset of
diseases [37,38]. Rogers et al. [39] have identified that
the CFTR gene knockout model of pig better mimics
human pathology than mouse models as they fail to
develop the hallmark pancreatic, lung and intestinal
obstructions that occur in humans. Reynolds et al. [40]
note that surgery, blood sampling, tissue recovery, serial
biopsies, instrumentations, whole organ manipulations
and many other biomedical applications are more easily
achieved in animals larger than a mouse, suggesting that
size does matter when it comes to animal models. Hence
mapping human disease genes to bovine orthologous
genes is an excellent mode for carrying out analytical
work and verifying the suitability of cow as a model
organism.

Out of the 94 human disease genes that were collected,
we observed splicing in 66 cases, (70.21%). Mapping
these 66 spliced human genes onto orthologous bovine
genes suggested that only 17 of the orthologous bovine
genes were spliced (18.09%). Cassette exons occur in 38
of human disease genes (120 cassette exons, Table 7)

bovine orthologous genes

and 14 orthologous bovine genes. At the exon level, we
observed that 97 of 120 human exons (Table 7) were
conserved in bovine, indicating a high level of conservation in this dataset across both the species. Previously,
for a larger dataset [16], it was reported that majority of
genes with cassette exons in human were present and
regulated in cattle. However, at the gene level, for the
current dataset, we have observed that only 3 genes with
cassette exons in human (Table 8) were present and
regulated in bovine.
We also carried out a detailed survey of the 94 human
disease genes to identify intron retention events. We
noted intron retention in nine human genes out of
which, in five genes IR was present and constitutive in
bovine (> 50%; Table 9). It has been indicated before
that the expression of intron-containing sequences occur
in a variety of diseases [41].
Protein domain analysis of the orthologous disease gene set
For the eight human disease genes that have orthologous
genes in the bovine genome, (three genes with CE and
five genes with IR), protein domain analysis revealed
that AS affects the structure and function of the proteins
encoded by the various transcripts from these genes. It
was evident that due to AS, the majority of the transcripts
either lacked the complete functional domain or lacked
an essential component/segment of the functional
domain. This suggests that AS is a major machanism
that could render these proteins non-functional, besides
perturbing the structure or fold of the protein.

For the set of the bovine orthologous genes, only two of
eight genes appear to be spliced, resulting in probable
structure and function disruption. These genes are
responsible for spinal muscular atrophy and colon
cancer, with the former noted as a disease caused by
AS [1]. Further investigation revealed that four of these
eight genes had all the domains from their human
counterparts conserved. This implies that 4/8 orthologous bovine genes (including the two AS genes) had
essential segments or complete functional domains
missing, due to AS.

Wilsonâs disease is another disease that has been
characterised in cow (OMIA). We observe that the
human gene known to be responsible for this disease
has a retained intron in one of its transcripts, which is
orthologous to the only transcript available in the
corresponding bovine gene. Thus, the cow would be
most suitable as a model organism for this human
disease.

Conclusion
This is the first comprehensive study of the bovine
transcriptome, with 21% of bovine genes exhibiting
alternative splicing, compared to 68% and 57% in
human and mouse, respectively. Our analyses show
that bovine AS genes are composed of fewer transcripts
but many more exons than human and mouse AS genes,
although comprising exons and introns of comparable
extents. Nine different splicing events were compared
among cow, human and mouse genomes. Compared to
their human and mouse counterparts many more bovine
AS genes show intron retention. The most common AS
event was found to be exon skipping and the least
common events were intron retention and mutually
exclusive exons. With predominantly introns linking two
variable exons, as opposed to human and mouse genes
fewer AS bovine genes show high transcript variability.
38% more functional information than currently available in Ensembl was identified with our approach which
helped us collate the GO annotations for bovine AS
genes. The orthologous bovine AS genes are functionally
very similar to human and mouse genes as suggested by
GO annotations.
From the results of our protein domain analysis it is
evident that AS plays a major role in disease implications
in both human and cow, and is suitable as a model for
investigating spinal muscular atrophy, colon cancer,
tangier disease, glaucoma, spinocerebellar ataxia, polycystic kidney disease, autoimmune poly grandular
syndrome and wilsonâs disease. Our results provide a
window of opportunity for more in-depth analysis over a
larger dataset, where the cow can serve as a model
organism for many more human diseases.
