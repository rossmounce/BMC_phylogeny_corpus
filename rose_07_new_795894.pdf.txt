Abstract
Background: The last third of the 20th Century featured an accumulation of research findings that
severely challenged the assumptions of the "Modern Synthesis" which provided the foundations for
most biological research during that century. The foundations of that "Modernist" biology had thus
largely crumbled by the start of the 21st Century. This in turn raises the question of foundations
for biology in the 21st Century.
Conclusion: Like the physical sciences in the first half of the 20th Century, biology at the start of
the 21st Century is achieving a substantive maturity of theory, experimental tools, and fundamental
findings thanks to relatively secure foundations in genomics. Genomics has also forced biologists to
connect evolutionary and molecular biology, because these formerly Balkanized disciplines have
been brought together as actors on the genomic stage. Biologists are now addressing the evolution
of genetic systems using more than the concepts of population biology alone, and the problems of
cell biology using more than the tools of biochemistry and molecular biology alone. It is becoming
increasingly clear that solutions to such basic problems as aging, sex, development, and genome size
potentially involve elements of biological science at every level of organization, from molecule to
population. The new biology knits together genomics, bioinformatics, evolutionary genetics, and
other such general-purpose tools to supply novel explanations for the paradoxes that undermined
Modernist biology.

Background
The first two biological syntheses
Biology has been re-integrated twice already, first by
Darwin in 1859 and then during the "Modern Synthesis"
of the 1920s and 1930s. In both cases, the success of these
syntheses rested in part on ignorance. Charles Darwin
could reasonably integrate biology in the 19th Century on
a relatively elegant evolutionary foundation partly
because a great deal was not yet known about cellular and

biochemical machinery. This is not to say that Darwin
could not have integrated the findings of 20th Century cell
biologists and geneticists into his theory; he simply didn't
have the opportunity to do so because the data were not
yet available. He did the best that he could with the scientific material of biology that was widely available in his
day, and he almost single-handedly effected the first integration of the biological sciences.

Nevertheless, Darwin's synthesis was seriously and legitimately questioned in the first years of the 20th Century [1]
particularly due to the impact of new findings in genetics
and cell biology. There was too much detail that was
unknown during Darwin's time, most notably a workable
theory for the inheritance of quantitative traits, for Darwin's synthesis to last without considerable reformulation.
But the disintegration of the first attempt at scientific biology would naturally enough pave the way for the next, as
Fisher, Haldane, Wright, Dobzhansky, Mayr, Simpson, and
Stebbins, among many others, integrated genetics, paleontology, systematics, and cytology within a new, expanded,
structure for biological thought that is often referred to as
"The Modern Synthesis". After its genesis, this Modern Synthesis provided useful foundations for biological thought
for the middle part of the 20th Century.
Like Darwin's synthesis, the form of the Modern Synthesis
was shaped in part by ignorance of important features of
life that were at the time unknown to science. Specifically,
the molecular biology of the cell remained largely
unknown. During the construction of The Modern Synthesis, molecular biology was in its infancy. The biochemistry and molecular biology of the gene had not yet been
worked out, leaving evolutionary geneticists free to imagine that genomes were orderly libraries of stable hereditary information strongly shaped by natural selection.
And so they did, in most cases. This made it possible for
them to use simple models to supply excellent solutions
to such important and previously unsolved problems as
the inheritance of quantitative variation, the action of natural selection on Mendelian variation, the role of chromosome rearrangements in speciation, and so on. We are
great fans of the achievements of the Modern Synthesis,
particularly its clarity, its mathematically explicit foundations, and its capacity to make sense of a broad range of
biological phenomena. In this respect, the Modern Synthesis shares many features with Newtonian physics.
Nonetheless, the view of life that most biologists had
from 1935 to 1965 was highly simplified. Naturally, evolutionists, ecologists, and organismal biologists built
directly on the foundations supplied by the Modern Synthesis during this period. But just as the comparative biologists of the late 19th Century could study anatomy and
physiology based on a simple Darwinian foundation, so
did many mid-20th Century developmental and cell biologists implicitly build their research on assumptions
underwritten by the Modern Synthesis: hard inheritance,
no orthogenetic "direction" to evolution, adaptation by
natural selection, and so on. There were prominent Western scientists who dissented from this reliance on the
Modern Synthesis, like C.H. Waddington. The scientific
establishment of the Soviet Union, under the direction
Lysenko, also offered substantial dissent from The

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

Modern Synthesis. But for most Western biologists, the
Modern Synthesis provided a useful foundation for their
research.
However, some of the assumptions at the foundation of
The Modern Synthesis started to crumble in the 1970s
with the discovery of super-abundant genetic variation
that arguably often didn't evolve under the strict aegis of
natural selection. Then cells were found to incorporate
genes, mobile genetic elements, and organelles of diverse
historical origins. Furthermore, it became apparent in the
last decades of the 20th Century that DNA sequences
often evolved in ways that reduced the fitness of the organisms that bore them. It is now abundantly clear that living
things often attain a degree of genomic complexity far
beyond simple models like the "gene library" genome of
the Modern Synthesis.
Dead parts of the Modern Synthesis
It is important to be clear about common, though not necessarily universal, assumptions of mid-20th Century biology that have been discarded. A partial listing would
include at least the following:

• The genome is always a well-organized library of genes.
• Genes usually have single functions that have been specifically honed by powerful natural selection.
• Species are finely adjusted to their ecological circumstances due to efficient adaptive adjustment of biochemical functions.
• The durable units of evolution are species, and within
them the organisms, organs, cells, and molecules, which
are characteristic of the species.
• Given the adaptive nature of each organism and cell,
their machinery can be modeled using principles of efficient design.
Note that some of these ideas made it easy for biologists
to be specialized in their research and teaching, if not
actually isolated from the concerns of other biological disciplines. Thus, before 1980, the careers of cell biologists
and evolutionary biologists could proceed in relatively
blithe ignorance of the concerns or findings of their distal
biological disciplines. They could each insist on the purity
and autonomy of their intellectual interests, cell biologists
invoking their field's secure foundations in biochemistry,
evolutionary biologists relying on their field's deep theoretical and mathematical heritage of population genetics,
quantitative genetics, and phylogenetics.

Here we offer a general description of the emerging "new
biology", and illustrate it with examples drawn from
research on molecular evolution, aging, sex, and development. Naturally enough, these examples are chosen
because of our own research interests. They are not
intended to reflect the full sweep of the new biology, only
to illustrate it. Furthermore, we do not suppose that a single review article could conceivably do justice to all the
relevant complexities of research on these topics. Instead,
we discuss aspects of research on these questions that
serve to illustrate our general view that a new biology has
developed and, in conjunction, many important assumptions of 20th Century biology have been abandoned.
It might be thought that we suppose that the transition
which biology is now undergoing requires the defeat or
replacement of one set of biologists by another. But that is
not our opinion. The senior author of this article found
his way between these two kinds of biology, starting with
one view of living things in 1971 and ending up with a
very different one by 2001, and this was nothing unusual
or creditable. We should be equally clear that, in arguing
for the necessity of this intellectual transformation, we do
not think that those who based their research on the Modern Synthesis were "bad scientists" and those who now
abandon it are "good scientists." We are simply offering
an overview of how a large number of us have changed
our thinking, our biological Weltanschauung.

The crucible of the new biology: molecular
evolution
The previous view of gene evolution and molecular
function
In the Modern Synthesis, genes were adaptive characteristics of species, not a level of evolution with a deep history
or with branching processes potentially different from
those of species. This view was linked to the assumption
that species history was dominated by the fine evolutionary adjustment of sub-organismal traits to specific functional ends. Strong selection capable of quickly molding
traits for current utility was also expected to erase the history of sub-organismal traits. This strong commitment to
the power of selection may be why Mayr wrote the following in 1963:

"Much that has been learned about gene physiology
makes it evident that the search for homologous genes
is quite futile except in very close relatives". – Mayr [2]
p. 609
If the genes of each species are assumed to be perfectly
tuned to current function, mechanistic convergence
should often result, leading not only to erasure of evolutionary history, but also to extensive homoplasy in the
molecular and cellular machinery of diverse species. Thus

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

mid-20th Century biology usually assumed that species
were the durable units of evolution while organs, genes,
and cells evolved to match the functional demands placed
on those species (Fig. 1A). When new species formed, it
was expected that their genes would then diverge, and
with them the cells and organs that they specified, in parallel with the opportunity for divergence that speciation
supplied.
This assumption of parallelism across levels has now been
widely dropped. By the start of the 21st Century, molecular evolution had taught us that genes duplicate within
species, and protein-coding genes are often recognizably
conserved for tens or hundreds of millions of years, longer
than the duration of many species (Fig. 1B).
Some of the first glimpses into the complexity of molecular evolution came in the 1960s, when the sequences of
proteins from different organisms began to accumulate.
Knowledge of the sequences of proteins added a new hierarchical level to be studied. No longer did proteins have
to be viewed simply as characters of species. Rather amino
acids themselves could now be treated as constituent characters of evolving proteins. One goal of research on
molecular evolution was to use these amino acid
sequences to trace species history, yet it quickly became
clear that the proteins themselves had their own evolutionary histories – sometimes duplicating separately
within a species with both copies persisting indefinitely.
Hemoglobin was a key molecule for the discovery of the
deep history and complexity of protein evolution. Along
with cytochrome C [3], hemoglobin was one of the first
proteins with amino acid sequence information from
multiple species [4]. Both these proteins showed deep
homology across taxa separated by tens of millions of
years of evolution, indicating that phylogenetic history at
the gene level could now be studied on its own. In 1961,
VM Ingram published a paper in Nature entitled "Gene
evolution and the haemoglobins" [4]. Ingram presented a
gene tree of hemoglobins, suggesting that the different
hemoglobin chains evolved by duplication, and that
myoglobin is a paralog of hemoglobins (Ingram fully
articulated the concept of paralogy or "duplicationdependent homology" [5], though the word itself was not
invented until 1970 [6]). Ingram recognized the importance of this idea, and considered it novel, with major
implications for understanding gene evolution. Proteins
have evolutionary histories of their own and deep histories at that (Fig. 1b).
Complications for "The Tree of Life"
Nineteenth and 20th Century biologists generally conceived of a "Tree of Life" – a mostly bifurcating graph connecting species in an order that reflects their common

Figure new views of the evolution of genes
Old and1
Old and new views of the evolution of genes. (A) Many 20th Century biologists viewed genes as traits of species, exquisitely
tuned to current utility. This resulted in the assumption that each species should, for the most part, possess different genes.
Gene duplication was recognized, but was implicitly assumed to have occurred recently. (B) Many biologists now assume that
most genes have their origins in gene duplication events, which happen throughout evolutionary history. As a result, many
genes form families that have persisted for hundreds of millions of years.

ancestry. At least three processes complicate such a view of
a tree of life, horizontal transfer, symbiogenesis, and differential lineage sorting of genes. Each of these processes
are at odds with fundamental assumptions of the Modern
Synthesis [7,8] and a Tree of Life for the new biology is
necessarily more complex than a graph joining species.

life forms, like eukaryotes. Broad theories of endosymbiotic origins for species had been suggested in the late 19th
and early 20th Centuries [7], but were ignored save for a
few well-established cases like lichens. By the 1980s, the
evidence for symbiogenesis in major cell biological events
was voluminous [13,14].

In the middle part of the 20th Century, it was often supposed that organisms and their cells are sleekly functional
(Fig. 2A). Given such assumptions, passing genes from
one species to another would not be favorable if those
genes were finely tuned for the necessary functions of the
species from which they originate. Even the movement of
genes within a single genome was not accepted by the biological mainstream at that time, despite McClintock's
early discovery of accessory elements in maize [9]. Nevertheless, molecular characterization of transposable elements in the late 1970s finally undermined the view of
the genome as a static, well-organized library of genetic
information [reviewed in [10]]. With the advent of
genome sequence data, researchers studying the molecular phylogenetics of bacteria realized how common
prokaryotic horizontal transfer is [11,12].

Even systematics has had to abandon many strictures that
were part of the Modern Synthesis. If species are the durable unit of biology, and if natural selection quickly molds
genes to current utility, then most genes should diverge at
the time of speciation events, given views like Mayr's. Here
again, analyses of newly abundant sequence data in the
late 20th Century showed that rather than a highly congruent coalescence of genes at the times of speciation
events, the coalescence times of alleles among species are
highly variable. As such, species trees and gene trees often
cannot be equated [15,16].

Similarly, modernist preconceptions led some to discount
the importance of endosymbioses in the origins of new

These phenomena complicate the tree of life. Rather than
a graph connecting species, the tree of life itself is hierarchical: A universal tree of species is largely a humanimposed ideal because the components of any particular
species have evolutionary histories that are not congruent
with each other. This incongruence has a clear and well
documented mechanistic basis in horizontal transfer,

Figure new views of the evolution of prokaryote genomes
Old and2
Old and new views of the evolution of prokaryote genomes. (A) 20th Century biologists sometimes assumed a close congruence between gene history and species history. Horizontal gene transfer was assumed to be uncommon, as the process of
genes entering a new genome is counter to the idea of a sleek and well adapted genome. (B) After analyzing the genomes of
many prokaryotes, biologists recognized that horizontal gene transfer may be a common event. Furthermore, prokaryote species trees may be viewed as a patchwork of gene trees with varying levels of congruence. A similarly hierarchical view of
eukaryote evolution has been articulated by Maddison [15], except that differential coalescent times – usually not horizontal
transfer – is the primary mechanism used to explain incongruence of gene and species trees.

symbiogenesis and differential lineage sorting (not to
mention gene duplication explained above). These processes together undermine the existence of a tree of life
defined only at the level of species, pointing instead to
branching histories that often differ among levels of
organization and scales of analysis.

Genomic elements of the new biology
The periodic table and complete genome sequences
Of course it is a platitude to say that biology is an inherently hierarchical discipline. Natural science as a whole is
inherently hierarchical. This is not to dismiss the existence
of meaningful emergent phenomena, as the existence of
life itself illustrates. But no statement in chemistry can be
a false statement in physics, and no feature of life can contravene the findings of chemistry. When there is such
incoherence, it has to be rectified, by correcting one or
both of the conflicting disciplines.

Before the 20th Century, physics and chemistry existed in
partial isolation from one another. The foundations of
physics were of little interest to organic chemists, just as
organic chemistry was of little interest to physicists. Each
could happily pursue its interests in a parochial manner.
With the coming of nuclear physics and then quantum

mechanics, chemistry and physics became integrated to
such an extent that there is now no clear boundary
between them.
Perhaps the critical bridge that links physics and chemistry is the Periodic Table. Though aspects of the Periodic
Table were intuited by chemists before the 20th Century,
in the first half of the 20th Century the Periodic Table was
the obvious bridge between physics and chemistry,
between the theories of quantum mechanics and the
properties of chemical bonds.
In the same way, the complete sequences of genomes that
were first made available circa 2000 make the interdependence of the biological disciplines patently clear. It is
also evident that genomes rarely if ever are tidy libraries of
biochemical instructions for making cells, nor are they the
abstract assemblages of numerous alleles of small effect.
Genomes clearly show the imprint of accidents in evolutionary history, selection, and biochemical constraints.
Genomes are laden with mechanistic and historical detail;
if not always baroque, genomes are clearly not universally
elegant in their construction. And their elaborate detail
implicates biochemical, cellular, organismal, ecological,
and evolutionary machinery simultaneously.

Genomics is fundamental for the new biology
The new genomic foundations of biology are not nearly as
convenient as those of the Modern Synthesis:

• Genomes can have abundant DNA sequences that are of
no apparent functional benefit to the organism.
• Much genomic DNA arises from the proliferation of
DNA sequences that have evolved to proliferate within
genomes, not benefit organisms.
• Protein-coding DNA sequences are often phylogenetically ancient, of far greater age than the species that bear
them.
• Genomes can change rapidly due to selection mechanisms operating on multiple levels simultaneously, as
well as processes of transposition, mutation, and recombination.
• Because the genome is a complex and shifting patchwork subject to many evolutionary and biochemical constraints and pressures, simple models of cellular or
organismal function will often fail.
Common mid-20th Century assumptions about how cells,
organisms, and species work have thus been undermined.
This might seem like warrant for despair about the future of
biology, but there are two mitigations to consider. First, this
complexity was always there. Darwin and many later biologists realized that their simple models were erected like
piers over swampy ground. They just didn't know how deep
the muck was. Second, we now have powerful genomic
tools for addressing complex phenomena throughout biology. It is the use of these genomic tools in the unfolding of
the new biology that we are particularly concerned with in
this section of our article.
Genomic tools of the new biology
Biologists discovered the lacunae of the Modern Synthesis
through the use of some of the same tools that are already
being employed to build 21st Century biology. However,
not all of the genomic tools that biology now uses were
important in the transition to the new biology, and they
might have escaped the notice of some. We start with the
obvious genomic tools and proceed to those that have
received less attention.

• Rapid DNA sequencing is the key technology that undermined the Modern Synthesis by revealing the complexity
and variety of genomes.
• Massive parallel assays of gene expression, from mRNA
production to protein level, have revealed the interconnected gene networks on which cellular and organismal

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

functions are based. These data have undermined the 20th
Century notion of simple pathways of gene-enzyme determination for most biological processes, favoring instead
the "network" concept of biological machinery.
• Phylogenetic bioinformatics allows us to infer the
sequence changes of nucleic acids and proteins with
proper statistical validity, disclosing both the unity of the
biochemical machinery of life and the speed at which that
machinery can evolve.
• Quantitative-genetic and genomic mapping are combining to build a genetics that can move from organism to
organism with greater speed and power than the old
"model organism" and "single mutant" genetics of the
20th Century.
• Molecular ecology is putting DNA sequence variation
and ecological processes together to increase the power of
ecological research, and in so doing has revealed the high
levels of complexity and species diversity, especially
microbial, underlying ecological phenomena.
• Large-scale mutagenesis, RNAi and other gene expression modifications, and experimental evolution complement genomic mapping in the unraveling of gene
networks, particularly by probing biological systems for
their causal controls.
But there is much more going on in the transformation of
biology than the mere addition of genomic technology to
standard experimental strategies. The new technologies
are bringing together the old disciplines of biology, from
biochemistry and molecular genetics to ecology and evolutionary biology.
We will illustrate the flavor of the new biology with
research on three fundamental topics: aging, sex, and
development. In each of these instances, well-established
20th Century views of the causal mechanisms that define
each of these phenomena have been undermined, as we
will now show.

Aging: from single bullet to many-headed
monster
Cell and molecular biologists took over the study of aging
inappropriately
In the latter part of the 19th Century, and well into the
20th Century, biologists sought to explain the phenomena of organismal aging in terms of basic organismal
physiology. Around 1900, Metchnikoff [e.g. [17]] tried to
explain aging in terms of autotoxification effects of the
interaction between intestinal bacteria and the immune
system. This theory was refuted by the persistence of aging
in bacteria-free rodents. Bidder [18] tried to explain aging

Page 6 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:30

in terms of determinate adult body size, as opposed to the
absence of aging that he assumed in fish with indeterminate, indefinite, adult body growth. Comfort [19,20]
refuted this theory by showing that fish which continue
growing as adults nonetheless show the increasing mortality rates characteristic of aging. And so it went with
numerous other theories of aging couched in terms of
organismal physiology.
With the success of molecular and cell biology in the
1950s and 1960s, molecular and cell biologists tried to
explain aging in terms of general molecular mechanisms.
By then it was well-established that aging was ubiquitous
among species, and among organs and tissues within individual animals, particularly the better-studied mammalian organisms, like humans, rodents, and dogs. Thus
Szilard [21], among others, proposed that aging resulted
from an accumulation of mutations in somatic cells.
Orgel [22] in turn hypothesized that aging arises from the
positive feedback of errors in the translation machinery,
whereby errors in the synthesis of the components of that
machinery, such as amino acyl tRNA synthetases, lead to
still further errors in the synthesis of those same components. These ingenious cell-level theories were complemented by Hayflick's [23,24] finding of finite cell
replication among vertebrate cells allowed to divide without limit in vitro. For the rest of the 20th Century, cell and
molecular biologists largely pursued a model of aging
based on the theory that limited cell proliferation leads to
pervasive and cumulative failure of organismal
physiology.
By the year 2000, if not earlier, it became apparent that
some fundamental assumptions of this research program
did not hold. Some metazoan cells, like those of fissile sea
anemones and some Hydra, show no universal tendency
to age [19,25]. Furthermore, it was realized that the
molecular mechanisms which limit in vitro cell proliferation in humans, among other mammals, often enhance
organismal survival and function by impeding the establishment and spread of malignant tumors [26-28].
In addition, despite considerable effort devoted to finding
corroborative evidence for both somatic mutation and
error catastrophe mechanisms of cell aging, it was generally found that cellular translation machinery tends to
maintain its accuracy quite well [29] and somatic mutations were relatively limited in their damaging effects [e.g.
[30]], the most significant debilitating effects of somatic
mutation ironically being mutations which lead to proliferating malignancies in vertebrates [31].
After a half-century devoted to research based largely on
the assumption that the cause of aging is driven by molec-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

ular mechanisms of cell breakdown, there is now abundant evidence against this characteristic assumption.
Evolutionary biology supplied a better explanation of
aging
Though most evolutionary biologists showed little interest in aging before 1980, there was nonetheless a quiet tradition of evolutionary theory devoted to the explanation
of aging in terms of a progressive weakening of the force
of natural selection. This line of thinking started with tangential, if not elliptical, remarks published by R.A. Fisher
in 1930 [32] and J.B.S. Haldane in 1941 [33], but it was
Peter Medawar who took up this theme at length, particularly in his famous 1952 essay, "An Unsolved Problem of
Biology" [34]. W.D. Hamilton [35] then supplied the first
mathematically cogent analysis of the age-dependent
weakening of the Forces of Natural Selection. This work
was placed on solid formal foundations by Brian Charlesworth, whose 1980 book [36] marked a definitive summation of this minor, primarily British, theoretical
tradition.

It turned out that many of the major features of aging that
were puzzling and counter-intuitive for cell biologists
could be explained in terms of evolutionary theory. For
example, the absence of aging in fissile organisms could
be explained readily in terms of the absence of decreases
in the forces of natural selection that arise when reproduction proceeds by symmetrical fission. Likewise, much of
the comparative biology of aging fits readily within the
framework supplied by the evolutionary theory of Hamilton and Charlesworth [31].
It was left to evolutionary experimentalists to show that
aging would readily evolve as predicted by evolutionary
theory [37-39]. Furthermore, it was a straightforward
project to use evolutionary and quantitative genetic
approaches to uncover specific physiological mechanisms
that underlie aging in particular species, such as Drosophila
[40]. Notably, the causally demonstrable mechanisms of
aging in Drosophila have proven to be different from the
molecular mechanisms assumed by cell biologists from
the 1950s to the 1990s, revolving instead around resistance to stress, investment in reproduction, and metabolic
reserves. Most importantly, the initial application of
genomic tools has revealed that aging is a "many-headed
monster" at the level of molecular machinery [41], a
genomically baroque phenomenon quite unlike the welldefined, universal, aging mechanism sought by 20th Century cell biologists.
Aging is not unstoppable molecular, cellular, or organismal
breakdown
But the story is further complicated as a result of additional experiments on the demography of aging. In 1992,

Page 7 of 17

Biology Direct 2007, 2:30

massive experiments with dipteran cohorts showed that
mortality rates did not indefinitely accelerate upward with
adult age; instead, they can stabilize for what appear to be
indefinite periods [42,43]. It turns out that this phenomenon is implicit in the original theory of Hamilton and
Charlesworth [44,45]. Furthermore, experiments with
Drosophila have shown that aging ceases with respect to
both survival and fecundity, with a sustained late-life plateau of stable health that can be readily manipulated
using experimental evolution [e.g. [46,47]]. Thus, many
of the assumptions of 20th Century research on aging no
longer stand. Like many areas of biology, at the start of the
21st Century, the foundations of research on aging are
quite different from those assumed by the dominant paradigm of the previous century.

Sex: from sib competition to genomic disease
Evolutionary biologists assumed sex was a solution to
ecological problems
But the preceding capsule history of the disintegration of
20th Century fashions of research on aging should not be
taken as a mere condemnation of the arrogance of cell
biologists. We will now review a parallel set of scientific
errors on the part of 20th Century evolutionary biologists
in which they assumed that they could explain the protean phenomenon of sex in terms of the kind of the universal, simple, causal mechanisms favored by the Modern
Synthesis.

Just as cell biologists felt that it was incumbent on them
to explain aging during the second half of the 20th Century, Modernist evolutionary biologists had a similar
notion about the explanation of sex, recombination, and
kindred phenomena. And just as cell biologists naturally
sought to explain what they supposed was a sustained
physiological breakdown at the level of the cell in terms of
the same kind of molecular mechanisms as those that they
invoked to explain normal functions, evolutionary biologists naturally sought to explain sex in terms of the ecological selection pressures that had been the typical tools of
evolutionary analysis ever since Charles Darwin.
Before 1970, it had been common for evolutionary geneticists to invoke simple evolutionary explanations of sex like
that of H.J. Muller [48,49], who had pointed out that sexual
recombination will reduce the time to fixation of beneficial
mutations that arise at different loci. But by 1971, Maynard
Smith, among others, realized that asexual reproduction
had a two-fold advantage over sex, in that it would double
the rate of production of asexual females over that of sexual
females, all other things being equal [50]. Such a two-fold
advantage, it was thought, would readily lead to the
swamping of populations with steadily more prevalent
asexual females, and the progressive elimination of sex.
Furthermore, by the 1970s it was known that asexual repro-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

duction was much more widely distributed among protists,
plants, and animals than had been thought earlier in the
20th Century [51,52]. By the 1980s, sex had been crowned
"the Queen" of problems in evolutionary theory [53], and
solutions based on 20th Century evolutionary biology were
certainly wanting [52,53].
A wave of evolutionary biologists set out to explain the
origin and maintenance of sex in terms of the types of ecological selection pressures that were emphasized in the
evolutionary biology of the 20th Century. Changing environments, competition between sibs, parasite load, evolutionary arms races, and genetic load were among the range
of evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that were
invoked [51-54]. Some of these theories were repeated so
often that, despite a general lack of critical experimental
tests which corroborated them, they found their way into
numerous biology texts. But none of these selection
mechanisms had the reliable quality that seemed to be
required for phenomena as ubiquitous as sex and recombination. Indeed, extreme and implausible ecological
change seemed to be required to yield a selective advantage to sex in models based on such processes as ecological change and ecological competition. Matters were not
helped by the fact that simple forms of sex and recombination were to be found even among bacteria. Sex seemed
to be ubiquitous, but it was without a successful explanation based on the kinds of ecological selection mechanisms that evolutionary biologists were most comfortable
with prior to 1980.
A further thorn in the side of conventional evolutionary
theories of sex was that they had no credible scenario for
the origin of eukaryotic sex [vid. [52]]. Under extraordinary circumstances, it was possible for evolutionary biologists to suppose that rapid ecological change or complex
environments might favor the generation of abundant
genetic diversity by evolutionarily long-established
machinery for eukaryotic sex, but they didn't even have a
cogent story to tell for the origin of sex. Yet, since eukaryotic sex is a complex and cumbersome apparatus, selection for its evolution must have been particularly intense
during its origin.
Recombination is a by-product of normal DNA repair
mechanisms
The suspicion that evolutionary biologists were "barking
up the wrong tree" started to grow among biologists in the
1980s. One of the important points brought to the debate
was the intimate relationship between the molecular
machinery of recombination and that of DNA repair.
DNA repair is one of the most fundamental needs of all
organisms. It became apparent that a side-effect of double-strand break repair in cells with homologous chromosomes might be recombination [54-56]. Given this fact,

Biology Direct 2007, 2:30

why did there have to be some type of ecological selection
for recombination? Selection for the maintenance of the
chromosome would suffice. As of the first years of the 21st
Century, evidence that chromosomal recombination is a
by-product of DNA repair has continued to grow [57,58].
This is not to say that we are arguing the evolution of sex
is only determined by selection for DNA repair. Rather, we
are making the point that biologists are now considering
a much greater diversity of evolutionary mechanisms for
sex, including mechanisms at multiple levels of the biological hierarchy.
Sex may have originated and be maintained as a form of
genomic parasitism
Growing information about transposable elements made
it clear by 1980 that some DNA molecules could copy and
spread among genomes as a result of selection on such
DNAs to spread within and among genomes, not as a
result of selection between organisms [59,60]. Furthermore, the spread of such parasitic elements depends critically on the occurrence of sexual recombination and
horizontal gene transfer. So long as cells and organisms
did not recombine DNA with each other, transposable
elements would be selected to control their proliferation
within genomes [61].

This paved the way for the proposal that sex originated as
a device for parasitic DNAs to spread from cell to cell [6163]. Experiments with autonomous conjugative elements
with deleterious effects [64-66] showed that such parasitic
elements could spread de novo in bacteria, making it plausible that ancestral unicellular eukaryotes may have
evolved sex by analogous means.
The problem of the maintenance of sex also was attacked
from the vantage point that sex didn't have to be beneficial to be maintained. It was shown mathematically that,
when potentially asexual females suffer from continued
fertilization by males, anisogamous sex could be maintained even if it was not evolutionarily beneficial in itself
[67]. Recently, the natural history of sex has been interpreted in terms of the ability of new parthenogens to
avoid sex with males [68]. It is a notably inelegant feature
of this research that it brings in genomic detail as well as
historical effects in the analysis of the evolution of sex.
Sex has been subject to natural selection at multiple levels
As the 20th Century waned, it was becoming apparent that
many aspects of the evolution of sex and recombination
were more suited to explanations couched in terms of
transposable elements, chromosomes, and organelle
genomes undergoing selection within organisms, rather
than the radical and implausible processes of ecological
change assumed by the evolutionary explanations of sex
based on standard models derived from the assumptions

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

of the Modern Synthesis. This did not show that the evolution of sex was never shaped by ecological factors.
Indeed, a miscellany of experimental data accumulated
suggesting the occasional role of ecological factors in the
evolution of sex. What was rendered otiose was the sole
reliance on ecological selection as the explanation for the
maintenance of sex and recombination.
The study of the evolution of genetic systems now characteristically involves the invocation of multiple levels of
selection, between and within genomes, and diverse
molecular processes, from transposition to unequal chromosome segregation during gametogenesis, and so on
[69-72]. Evolutionary ecology models for the evolution of
sex have been put in their proper perspective, as some
among many of the mechanisms that contribute to the
scientific complexity of sex. With respect to its eclecticism,
the study of the evolution of genetic systems has become
a promising portent for the future of biology as a whole in
this century.

Homology and evo-devo: ancient genetic
toolkits for development
Ancient Gene Histories are Widespread
In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists began discovering
deep homologies in body patterning genes like Hox genes
[73,74]. The view that many derived from the Modern
Synthesis had been that organismal structures like segmented bodies, eyes, limbs, and hearts, evolved essentially de novo, multiple times, independently in various
lineages, in close conformity with the requirements of
function. Like the concept of genes in the days preceding
the advent of modern genomics, the common assumption
was that organismal structures were simply traits of species. Species might have a particular morphological trait
for a particular function, or they might not have that trait
if that function was not selectively favored. Few paid
attention to the intermediate possibility – that morphological traits themselves are a complex patchwork of
shared and derived elements, and thus are more analogous to baroque ornamentation [72]. For example, 20th
Century biologists often assumed that distinct developmental processes often arose separately in different lineages – especially when comparing different phyla, which
were regarded as having different "body plans". But the
discovery of conserved developmental genetic processes
for patterning the bodies of taxonomically and morphologically disparate organisms forced biologists to
consider common descent at deeper levels of biological
organization.
Eye evolution uses common ancestral genetic components
Eye evolution provides a canonical example. A comprehensive, and oft-cited, 1977 publication [75] concluded
that photoreceptors must have evolved essentially de novo

Page 9 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:30

40–65 times independently. This is an excellent example
of the then-common emphasis on selection over evolutionary history, just before this view was to collapse.
Research in the 1990s showed that many of the genes
involved in eye development are homologous between
phyla. Although it had been known for some time that the
opsin visual-pigment genes are conserved across phyla, a
watershed discovery in eye evolution was that similar
mutant eye phenotypes in fruit flies, mice, and humans
are caused by mutations in homologous genes [76]. These
genes are named Pax-6 in vertebrates and eyeless in fruit
flies. Multiple other phyla are now known to utilize
homologous Pax-6 proteins during eye development [77].
Furthermore, multiple genes besides Pax-6 and opsin were
subsequently shown to have a conserved role in eye development across phyla. Nonetheless, other components of
animal eyes, like lens proteins, have in many cases only
relatively recently been co-opted for use in eyes [78]. As
such, disentangling questions like "Are all eyes homologous?" is complex. The answer invariably is "some parts of
eyes are homologous and some parts are not" and the
answer also depends on the time scale being examined.
Evo-Devo has been discovering common underlying
genetic toolkits
Similar stories to that of eyes can be told for limbs, hearts,
and body segments. Naturally, many biologists now question the assumption that organs and especially developmental processes normally evolve multiple times from
scratch, each specifically fashioned by powerful mechanisms of natural selection. Present-day biology emphasizes the importance of deep homology among
developmental processes and the genes that code for
them, and also the recombination of these elements to
form novelties. As such, developmental processes are far
from elegantly constructed, being instead the result of bricolage or tinkering [79,80] as well as duplication and
divergence at multiple biological levels, thus making evolutionary history of central importance for understanding
organismal traits [81].

• We cannot assume in advance the existence, level, or
focus of natural selection on a particular biological
attribute. The attribute could arise from (i) accidental
evolutionary events, (ii) selection on a DNA sequence that
evolves independently of the replication of its host, or (iii)
unanticipated pleiotropic effects of selection on other
characters.
• We cannot assume fixed relationships between structures and functions. Most evolutionary histories are complex, with structures adopting different roles in the course
of their evolution, and functions being underlain by different structures during the course of their evolution. That
is, the causal hierarchies of biology are not necessarily
fixed, even in overall structure.
• We cannot assume the stability or distinctness of rate
among biological processes. Genetic evolution may occur
on a comparable time-scale to that of ecological change,
for example.
• Unlike stereotyped scientific practice, 21st Century
genomic technologies and techniques of data analysis give
us the opportunity to be "led" by the data in an hypothesis-free manner. When appropriate, we may "listen" to the
data, rather than forcing a particular hypothesis on it.
• In the same spirit, experimental evolution and experimental ecology let organisms show us how they respond
to particular biological regimes, which is complementary
to performing critical experimental tests of a priori
hypotheses.
• Numerical exploration of theoretical models for complex biological mechanisms will be more informative
than assuming away most of the biology in order to
achieve a mathematically-refined global analysis. Again,
like genomics and experimental evolution, such numerical work can be exploratory and open-ended, rather than
seeking a pre-determined outcome. The low cost of computation makes such open-minded numerical work vastly
more feasible.

New rules for biology
While the nature of the transition from 20th Century biology to 21st Century biology seems clear to us in both overview and for some particular applications, the most
important changes defining this transition might be usefully listed:

• Modern statistical and bioinformatic techniques are
likewise considerably more powerful, which allows us to
collect and analyze information on a vast scale. These data
allow a more thorough exploration of the complexities of
biology.

• We should no longer assume that a biological research
problem can be satisfactorily solved using the intellectual
tools from only one biological discipline. This might be
the case, but it is likely that most valid one-discipline solutions are the 'low-hanging fruit' already picked by 20th
Century biology.

Some may feel that the view of life supplied by nascent
21st Century biology is painfully complicated, if not perverse. For our part, we think that the historical complexity
and versatility that we now know to characterize life are
inspiring and challenging. In many ways, we are
reminded of the transition from the complacent physics

Page 10 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:30

of the 19th Century to the turbulent modern physics after
Einstein's 1905 scientific revolution. The old Newtonian
certainties were destroyed, but in their place physicists
found both a better foundation for their field and a
spectrum of exciting research problems. We feel that biology has found its way to the same level of maturity.

Nothing new?
Some readers may feel that much that we have said is simply stating the obvious. But we are not proposing the creation of a new biology. It already exists, and it is the only
biology that many present-day graduate students have
known. Yet it is always useful to know the country that
you reside in, particularly for those of us who are older
and who started our scientific careers at another point in
the historical development of biology.
Others might assert that we are describing nothing more
than systems biology. But there are major historical problems with this view, namely, the field of systems biology
itself has undergone the same sort of transformation as
other biological disciplines mentioned previously. Systems biology was invented at the same time as the Modern
Synthesis, explicitly by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and in
many respects also implicitly by Sewall Wright, in the
1930s. To give just one example, von Bertalanffy published his much-read book General System Theory in 1968
[82]. Both of these titanic figures were interested in complex networks of biological regulation and organisms as
dynamical systems, yet these ideas were hardly incompatible with the then-prevailing Modern Synthesis in content. Examination of the contemporary literature of
systems biology show that it involves core ideas that have
been common among devotees of the thinking of Bertalanffy and Wright, and also Odum, Rapoport and other
practitioners of systems thinking in biology from the
1930s to the 1970s, covering biological sub-disciplines
from organismal biology to ecosystem modeling. But
modern systems biology, just like the broader field of
biology, also includes further articulation and elaboration
of ideas, many of which are incompatible with assumptions of the Modern Synthesis.
But a more constructive answer to a criticism that today's
biology is not fundamentally different is to give a concrete
example. Take "the C-value paradox," the fact that total
eukaryotic genome size, in number of nucleotides, is
sometimes vastly greater than the size required to code for
the complete set of genes and regulatory sequences of any
known eukaryote species. The reason this observation is
named a paradox at all relies on the assumption that
genomic complexity should be correlated with organismal complexity. Why should the genomes of some ciliates, salamanders, and ferns be vastly larger than those of
humans? From the perspective of the Modern Synthesis,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

one might suppose that these ciliates, salamanders, and
ferns have much greater need for numerous, diverse, structural genes or regulatory sequences.
Present-day biologists are instead dealing with the C-value
paradox in terms of the evolution of non-coding DNA, the
proliferation of transposable elements, and kindred phenomena. This does not imply that evolutionary theory
simply no longer applies. Instead, new evolutionary theories have been developed, such as Lynch and Conery's theory of reduced effective population size leading to less
efficient selection against the proliferation of non-essential, even deleterious, DNA sequences, and thus greatly
expanded genome sizes in endemic species with small
population sizes [83,84]. It is not our concern to argue for
or against this particular theory, only to point out that this
scientific debate was not a live issue for biologists in 1970.
And it certainly wasn't an obvious corollary of the systems
biology perspective then extant, either.
The fundamental landscape of biology is undergoing a
major upheaval, much as it did in the first decades of the
20th Century [1]. This upheaval will take time to fully
reveal its implications. The sequencing of several important eukaryotic genomes around the year 2000 was no
more an instant transformation of biology than the re-discovery of Mendel was in 1900. Decades are required to
change the foundations of a scientific field as complex as
biology. Furthermore, the new biology is not without its
anticipatory prophets, and we do indeed consider Barbara
McClintock, Sewall Wright, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, C.H.
Waddington, Emile Zuckerkandl and others to be such
figures. But biological research is undergoing a period of
rapid, and profoundly beneficial, transformation reminiscent of the events surrounding the Modern Synthesis. We
further hope that biology curricula and textbooks will
eventually come to reflect this disciplinary transformation, much as the teaching of biology was reformed to
reflect the Modern Synthesis during the middle part of the
20th Century.

Reviewers' comments
W. Ford Doolittle, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova
Scotia, CANADA:
Providing comments on the submission by Rose and Oakley is a pleasure, a challenge and (on another level) a
source of some irritation. Comments, not really a review,
because this essay, like many published in Biology Direct
is an historically-grounded speculative opinion-piece. It
cannot really be judged as valid or invalid in the same
objective way that we like to believe that experiments and
the interpretation of experimental results can be. For fairminded reviewers, rejection is not a serious option. A
pleasure because the grand science history story Rose and
Oakley tell is congruent enough with my own version of
collective experience that I can endorse it, and it is very
well articulated. A challenge because I don't think there is
in fact any way at all that such metanarratives can be
judged to be valid or not, no matter who tells them. Each
of us comes to believe what he/she does about the status
of his/her discipline through an idiosyncratic mix of personal experience, interactions with colleagues, the primary literature and whiggish "histories" written by others
in that discipline. Of course there has also long been,
especially in evolutionary biology, a grander tradition of
synthetic theory, several of whose champions Rose and
Oakley cite, and in which tradition their own ms will no
doubt find a solid place. To the extent that such theorybuilding self-consciously situates itself within comprehensive historical accounts constructed to make the theory look good (a practice of which anyone who operates
at this level is guilty), it is suspect. But not useless: we need
shared stories no less than any other community. And a
cause for irritation because I want to do a proper job on
something like this, especially since my words will be
published. But a proper job can use up as much creative
energy as writing my own historically-grounded speculative opinion-piece, and the effort will not even be picked
up by PubMed: you'll have to look on Google. I suggest
that Eugene send reviewers of Biology Direct articles who
contribute more than, say, 1,000 words, T-shirts emblazoned "I reviewed a manuscript for Biology Direct and all
I got was this lousy T-shirt". People could wear them at
meetings.
This churlishness aside, let me disagree with Rose and
Oakley about the numbering and naming of "biological
syntheses" or re-integration events. Darwin's and the
Modern Synthesis were indeed the first and second but
pre-genomic molecular biology was as complete a re-integration (let's call it the Molecular Synthesis). My evidence
for that are the legions of successfully practicing molecular biologists who never read a book by George Gaylord
Simpson or Ernst Mayr, although to be sure molecular
biologists until recently would have enthusiastically

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

endorsed the five "dead parts" of the Modern Synthesis
that Rose and Oakley bullet. I especially agree with them
that at the outset molecular biologists were hard-core
adaptationists, and see for the first time thanks to them
how this connects to our early expectation that although
what was true for E. coli might be true for the elephant, we
would not find homology at the level of genes, detectable
in sequences. My fourth re-integration would be the
Genomics Synthesis, which now, as "systems biology",
promises top-down answers to questions of cellular function. Claims that we need and can have a truly holistic
biology have been around for a long time. Maybe now
they will be fulfilled, although I do worry about the loss
of historical perspective that viewing cells and organisms
as integrated systems seems to entail: we are at risk of forgetting that evolution is a tinkerer. And my fifth would be
the Metagenomics Revolution, which for microbiologists
should be enormously constructive in a deconstructive
way – enabling us to get rid of the belief that organisms
must be clustered in species, or that we can speak meaningfully about the ancient history of modern "lineages".
So maybe actually I see Rose and Oakley's New Biology as
a three-step revolution culminating in what we might call
the Postmodern Synthesis, in which we at last rid ourselves of (at least) two deeply-embedded and probably
theism-based pre-Darwinian notions: that species and
higher taxa are real (what Mayr called typological thinking), and that organisms are as perfectly ("sleekly" in Rose
and Oakley's apt phrase) functional as watches, although
natural selection and not God is the perfect watchmaker.
We're not there yet, as debates over the Tree of Life and a
rash of new papers on the functions of junk DNA reveal.
In this sense I think Rose and Oakley, perhaps because
they are evolutionists, are too generous to the many
molecular systematists who believe that they can put
Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology on a solid
footing with rRNA phylogenies and to the many molecular biologists who still mostly concern themselves with
how organisms work rather than why, and assume an
optimality which much of the data speak loudly against.
Each of the topics Rose and Oakley discuss in detail drives
home the same point: we start out thinking that what
seems to be a common biological pattern should have a
common causal process-level explanation, and wind up
discovering a variety of processes, undermining the reality
of pattern. Sometimes evolutionary theory shows us why
a certain outcome (aging, multilevel selection) might be
inevitable, but seldom does it tell us how or how often
this end has been achieved. What we get instead is an
explanatory toolkit to apply to specific cases, making the
present comprehensible in terms of the past. Such explanatory pluralism defines the Postmodern Synthesis. I see
this as the final maturation of biology, a discipline more

Page 12 of 17

Biology Direct 2007, 2:30

akin to history than to physics, properly viewed. I don't
think our end-state is "systems biology", if in using this
term we hope for some grand unifying theory of biology.
I don't think there can be such a theory any more than
there can be one for human history. Perhaps Rose and
Oakley can commit themselves on this.
That's my thousand words: where's my T-shirt?
Authors' Response: We are very grateful to have this entertaining and interesting review from Ford Doolittle, who has done
so much to bring the biological research community into the
brave new world of post-Modernist biology.
We will comment (agreeing with him that such opinions cannot be judged) on two of the major points raised by Dr. Doolittle. First, he outlines five synthesis or re-integration events. One
of these is his "Molecular Synthesis". We are well aware of the
degree to which some molecular biologists disdained contact
with the intellectual life of modern evolutionary biology, beyond
a few patronizing and often scientifically inaccurate allusions
to Charles Darwin. For this reason, we do not see this period as
a time of synthesis. Although an undeniably important time in
the history of biology, the attitudes cited, coupled with the new
found reductionist power of molecular biology, tended to splinter, not integrate biology. Second, Dr. Doolittle raises the possibility that biology has no overarching unifying theory, and
that a mature explanatory toolkit is the apex of biology. Without
a crystal ball, and given the complexity and hierarchical nature
of biology, it is difficult to argue against this idea.
Eugene V. Koonin, National Center for Biotechnology
Information, National Library of Medicine, National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD:
This is an ambitious, even super-ambitious paper. The
subject is, no more, no less, the change of the very character of modern biology that, according to Rose and Oakley,
has taken place (or, perhaps, is still taking place) at the
end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries. I
think the authors are, generally, correct in their claim that
such a crucial transformation of biology, indeed, has
occurred. Many biologists, of course, intuit this change
but few seem to rationalize it. Therefore, this is, potentially, a paper of unusual importance, perhaps, an eye
opener of sorts to many.
So what are the key differences between the "new biology"
and the traditional one that reigned in the 20th century
and, to a significant extent, is epitomized by the Modern
Synthesis of Evolutionary Biology? In one word, the name
of the new game is plurality. To use, perhaps, a somewhat
tacky phrase, the unity of the modern synthesis has been
replaced by a postmodern disarray (postmodernism is not
mentioned in the current version of the article but I feel

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

the notion just begs to be let in, with all necessary
qualifications).
Author's Response: Dr. Koonin's point is well taken that the
"New Biology" which we have described fits many definitions
of postmodernism, though certainly not all. In fact, a previous
version of this manuscript was entitled "Post-modern Biology",
with references to postmodernism throughout. Although we
agree with Dr. Koonin about these parallels, we decided that
explicitly including postmodernism raises too many issues of
semantics, if not indeed hermeneutics. To do justice to the concept of postmodernism, especially for an audience of biologists
who may or may not be familiar with the intricacies of the concept of postmodernism, would require extensive discussion of a
non-biological topic. Without such an extensive discussion,
using the term postmodern easily could be taken as simply a
pun, describing the state of biology after the Modern Synthesis.
Already, we could not cover all biological topics in sufficient
detail in a relatively brief article (see below).
This is the emphasis of the article but herein, as I see it,
also lie some limitations of Rose's and Oakley's text. I
fully realize that the subject is vast and complex, and cannot be humanly covered in its entirety in a relatively brief
article, so selections must be made, illustrative examples
have to be used etc. This being said, I believe that there are
several areas of substantial, structural incompleteness, so
I try to briefly discuss these below.
1. The most important shortcoming, to me, is that this
manifest of the postmodern, pluralistic biology, actually,
is very modern or even classical in a crucial respect, its
eukaryote-centrism; the exception is the brief discussion
of the crucial role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of prokaryotes (I come back to this issue below). All
the illustrations and most of the discussion revolve
around biological issues that are specific to eukaryotes
such as sex, development, and aging. Of course, it is not
unreasonable for the authors to address problems that are
closest to their own areas of expertise but the importance
of abandoning the eukaryote-centrism and, with it, any
persisting notion of progress in the evolution of life must
be made crystal clear. Indeed, one of the essential dimensions of the newly realized pluralism in biology is the fundamental plurality of life forms and the corresponding,
astonishing diversity of genome organizations, replication-expression strategies, cellular organizations, and lifestyles. Prokaryotes were not at all considered within the
framework of the Modern Synthesis, and viruses were not
even viewed as a major class of biological entities. The discoveries of the last third of the 20th century, in particular,
those of molecular phylogenetics, have changed these perceptions forever. We now realize that the lowly "monera"
actually comprise two of the three domains of cellular life
(bacteria and archaea), harbor most of life's metabolic

Page 13 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:30

diversity, and comprise most of the cellular biomass on
earth. Add to this that viruses are, in all likelihood, the
most common biological agents on earth (the number of
viral particles in many habitats exceeds the number of
cells by about an order of magnitude [85,86] and that,
unlike cellular life forms that follow the Central Dogma,
viruses display, essentially, all imaginable strategies of
replication and expression [87,88]. The realization that
archaea, bacteria, and viruses are parts of life that are every
bit as fundamental as eukaryotes – quite possibly, more
fundamental inasmuch as eukaryotes very well might be
hybrids of archaea and bacteria [89,90] – has profound
consequences for the reappraisal of the Modern Synthesis
and the tenets of New Biology discussed in this article. Let
us take a look at the "dead" parts of Modern Synthesis,
according to Rose and Oakley and reassess the status of
each postulate in view of the true diversity of life forms:
(i) "The genome is a well-organized library of genes"
-It is debatable just how well organized prokaryotic
genomes are but, unless optimality is seriously claimed,
they do appear to be reasonably good libraries.
(ii) "Genes usually have single functions that have been
specifically honed by powerful natural selection"
-Indeed, this does not seem to be the case in any life
forms.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

-Not really abundant when it comes to prokaryotes and,
especially, viruses.
(ii) "Much genomic DNA arises from the proliferation of
DNA sequences that have evolved to proliferate within
genomes, not benefit organisms."
-Not that much in prokaryotes, and virtually, none in
viruses (and many of the viruses do not even have any
DNA at all); those elements are under tight control in
most if not all prokaryotes, and in most unicellular
eukaryotes as well.
(iii) "Protein-coding DNA sequences are often phylogenetically ancient, of far greater age than the species that
bear them..."
-This is, indeed, universally true. Many proteins (and
structural RNAs as well) are conserved throughout the
entire history of life as we know it (not just older than species that cannot even be meaningfully defined in prokaryotes and viruses).
(iv) "Genomes can change rapidly due to selection mechanisms operating on multiple levels simultaneously, as
well as processes of transposition, mutation, and recombination."
-These rapid changes are even much more dramatic in
prokaryotes and viruses than they are in eukaryotes.

(iii) "Species are finely adjusted ..."
-Not just dead but, simply, makes no sense as generalizations because species cannot be objectively defined in
prokaryotes and viruses, and however they might be
defined arbitrarily, cannot possibly be the fundamental
units of anything.
(iv) "The durable units of evolution are species..."
-Makes no real sense – see above.
(v) "Given the adaptive nature of each organism and cell,
their machinery can be modeled using principles of efficient design"
-Prokaryotes are much more streamlined machines than
eukaryotes; while not every aspect of their functioning can
be modeled using design principles, such modeling is
generally not considered hopeless.
Now to the "genomic foundations for the new biology":
(i) "Genomes can have abundant DNA sequences that are
of no apparent functional benefit to the organism"

(v) "Because the genome is a complex and shifting patchwork subject to many evolutionary and biochemical constraints and pressures, simple models of cellular or
organismal function will often fail."
-Yes, simple models will fail often, but the extent of the
failure depends on the complexity of the modeled system,
i.e., for a simple prokaryotic cell, or a virus propagating
within a cell, the chances of some level of success are
much greater than for a complex eukaryotic cell.
Thus, the consideration of the full spectrum of life forms
sends a message that, I think, is even more powerful than,
simply, deconstruction of the Modern Synthesis. The inevitable conclusion from comparative-genomic analyses is
that the prevailing forces affecting genome evolution in
prokaryotes (and viruses) and in eukaryotes, and the
resulting genomic layouts are dramatically different. They
also substantially differ among different bacteria, even
more so, between unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, and even within the latter, say, between different animals. Plurality of pattern and process rules supreme, and
the challenge is to uncover the underlying logic of evolution – if any such exists.

Authors response – We thank Dr. Koonin for expressing his
prokaryote-centered views quite forcefully. We agree that his
viewpoint underscores even further the idea that a pluralistic
new biology is upon us. Despite the good fit of this view point,
we decided in the main article to keep our original intention of
focusing primarily on our own specialties when discussing
examples of the new biology. Dr. Koonin's review provides an
outstanding supplement to our article, focused on one of his
own specialties.
2. Rose and Oakley bring up the newly apparent prevalence of horizontal gene transfer as one of the major
blows to the 20th century perspective in biology. This is,
certainly, true, but I think the discussion in the paper
stops short of really driving the nail down. The real issue
is that, when fully conceptualized, extensive HGT undermines the very notion of the Tree of Life (the TOL paradigm) which, certainly, is a big part of the Modern
Synthesis (as well as the classical, Darwinian foundation
of biology). Simply put, although trees are crucial in
depicting certain phases and aspects of life's history, there
is no TOL as such, i.e, evolution of life cannot be presented as a tree, so Darwin's famous simile fails as an overarching generalization. The demise of the TOL paradigm
is covered in several recent papers [91,92]. Again, this is
related to the problem of "eukaryotic chauvinism": the
tree pattern might hold for the evolution of the major
divisions of eukaryotes (although not necessarily for all
eukaryotes taken together) but, certainly, not for prokaryotes, let alone the entire history of life.
Authors response – Here we disagree with Dr. Koonin. HGT does
not necessarily undermine Darwin's "Tree of Life" completely, even
though in post-Modernist biology this Tree of Life is much more
complex. Today's Tree of Life, as Dr. Koonin points out, is different
from what Darwin envisaged, in that it is multi-dimensional –
branching histories characterize in a complex way multiple levels of
organization, not just the species level. Further, as discussed in the
article, HGT is not the only blow to a two-dimensional tree; paralogy, endosymbiosis and lineage sorting also contribute to a new,
highly multi-dimensional view of evolutionary history.
This emerging understanding of the trees of life is pluralistic,
encompassing the branching history of biological units at all different levels of organization [81]. The evolutionary histories of
units at different levels (gene domains, genes, species, etc) are
not always congruent with each other, yet there are still branching histories that characterize each of these levels. Branching history is a pattern that results from well known mechanisms
including exon shuffling, gene duplication, genome duplication
(polyploidy), co-option, speciation, and vicariance of multiple
species. HGT is one example of a mechanism that causes branching histories at different levels of organization to be incongruent.
It clearly points out the failed assumption that the history of components is congruent with the history of the higher level unit to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/30

which it belongs. Nevertheless, this assumption can be used as a
valuable null model to understand macroevolutionary patterns
and processes [93]. As we discussed in this article, the species was
usually seen as the durable unit driving branching at all levels,
but the existence of multiple evolutionary levels and mechanisms
violates this assumption.
Processes to split biological units pervade all levels of the biological hierarchy. Protein domains duplicate within genomes and
may be "horizontally transferred" from one gene to another.
Genes may form units of synteny or operons, but individual
genes may also be copied from one part of the genome to
another or from one genome to another, independently of the
rest of a synteny unit or operon. Whole chromosomes and whole
genomes may also duplicate by various mechanisms. All these
processes create the new tree of life. But that tree is a postmodern tree, rich in complexity. Components coalesce to form units
with a congruent path for a time, only to be broken up. There is
no reason to provide anti-intellectual, anti-evolutionists with
quotes like "The Darwinian paradigm is dead", because this
complexity only enhances Darwin's most profound insight – the
universal common ancestry of life.
3. It appears that, to a very large extent, Rose and Oakley
identify the transition from modernism to post-modernism in biology with the fall of the pan-adaptationist paradigm of the Modern Synthesis. I believe this is, indeed, a
sensible view, but if so, the conceptual/intellectual history
of this change is not quite adequately presented in the
paper. To me, the (near) neutral theory of molecular evolution (Kimura, Jukes-King, Ohta, and more recent developments) is a major and indispensable part of the story.
The intellectual importance and impact of Jacob's tinkering paper and, especially, Gould and Lewontin's spandrel
paper cannot be underestimated either. These landmark
papers are cited in the present article but, I believe, not
entirely in the right context. The name of Richard
Dawkins does not come up at all although the conceptual
significance of The Selfish Gene for our current understanding of different level of selection and the prominence of
selfish elements is, in my opinion, impossible to deny. In
the same vein, it is hard to envisage the evolution of the
postmodern view of genomic evolution without the historic papers of Sapienza-Doolittle [59] and Crick and
Orgel [60] on selfish DNA. In my opinion, another
important part that, in a sense, wraps up the debunking of
the Panglossian view of life's evolution [see [94]], comes
in the recent papers of Lynch on the neutralist concept of
the origin of genomic complexity [83,84] – again, cited
here but, I am afraid, not entirely in focus.
Author's response – We have added these important references.
4. Finally, a few words about possible glimpses of a forthcoming new synthesis. The comparison to quantum/

relativistic revolution in physics is, I think, fully appropriate. The problem is, however, that we do not have a clear
image of the new synthesis in biology. "Postmodern synthesis" is an oxymoron of sorts as post-modernism eschews
(more or less) all generalization. However, this flies in the
face of the way we do science. We need a meta-narrative in
order to move on, even as we realize, clearer than ever, that
it should not be construed as anything even approaching
the "true" representation of biology, only as a worldview
that is not as obviously and hopelessly flawed as the previously prevailing vision. I believe that some aspects of the
new worldview have already been developed, with relatively little fanfare. The work of Lynch quoted above establishes a neutralist null hypothesis for the evolution of
genomic complexity, rooted in the specifics of the population structures and dynamics of different organisms, and in
that capacity it can be regarded as the logical completion of
the post-modernist transformation of biology. I am far
from suggesting that this concept provides the single underlying principle of biological evolution (Rose and Oakley
convincingly argue that no such thing is attainable) but it is
one of the crucial parts of the new framework. In addition,
it is hard for me to pass "evolutionary systems biology" [e.g.
[95,96]]. I believe that the efforts to understand and integrate the multiple inputs that affect a gene's evolution (e.g.,
expression level and position in various types of networks)
fit well into the pluralistic foundation of new biology, and
might be pointing to some of the important facets of the
new biological mainstream.

A very final, conceptually minor but not altogether unimportant comment. I think mentioning Lysenko and his
henchmen as scientific opponents to the Modern Synthesis (and in the same breath with C. H. Waddington, a genuinely outstanding biologist) is, to put in mildly,
disingenuous. Lysenko et al. were criminals driven by
political motivation of the worst kind, not scientists.
