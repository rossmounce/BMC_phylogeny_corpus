Results: A computer program that searches a genome database on the basis of the hydropathy
plots of the corresponding proteins was used to identify more than 100 transport proteins encoded
by P. falciparum. These include all the transporters previously annotated as such, as well as a similar
number of candidate transport proteins that had escaped detection. Detailed sequence analysis
enabled the assignment of putative substrate specificities and/or transport mechanisms to all those
putative transport proteins previously without. The newly-identified transport proteins include
candidate transporters for a range of organic and inorganic nutrients (including sugars, amino acids,
nucleosides and vitamins), and several putative ion channels. The stage-dependent expression of
RNAs for 34 candidate transport proteins of particular interest are compared.

Background: The uptake of nutrients, expulsion of metabolic wastes and maintenance of ion
homeostasis by the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite is mediated by membrane transport proteins.
Proteins of this type are also implicated in the phenomenon of antimalarial drug resistance.
However, the initial annotation of the genome of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
identified only a limited number of transporters, and no channels. In this study we have used a
combination of bioinformatic approaches to identify and attribute putative functions to
transporters and channels encoded by the malaria parasite, as well as comparing expression
patterns for a subset of these.

The malaria parasite (genus Plasmodium) is a unicellular
eukaryote which, in the course of its complex life cycle,

invades the erythrocytes of its vertebrate host. It is this
intraerythrocytic phase of the parasite life cycle that gives rise
to all the symptoms of malaria, a disease that is estimated to

give rise to almost 5 billion episodes of clinical disease and up
to 3 million deaths annually [1]. Plasmodium falciparum, the
most virulent of the malaria parasites that infect humans, has
developed resistance to most of the antimalarial drugs currently available. There is an urgent need for the development
of new antimalarial drug strategies, and for an improved
understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the parasite's ability to develop resistance to antimalarials.
Membrane transport proteins are integral membrane proteins that mediate the translocation of molecules and ions
across biological membranes. They serve a diverse range of
important physiological roles, including the uptake of nutrients into cells, the removal of unwanted metabolic waste
products and xenobiotics (including drugs), and the generation and maintenance of transmembrane electrochemical
gradients. These proteins play a key role in the growth and
replication of the parasite, as well as in the phenomenon of
antimalarial drug resistance. But despite this, and despite the
fact that membrane transport proteins have proven to be
extremely effective drug targets in other systems [2], all but a
few of the membrane transport proteins of the malaria parasite remain very poorly understood, and their potential as
antimalarial drug targets remains largely unexplored [2].
The 'permeome' is a term used here to describe the total complement of proteins involved in membrane permeability in a
given organism. It encompasses the full range of channels and
transporters encoded in the genome. The original annotation
of the P. falciparum genome, published at the end of 2002,
identified "a very limited repertoire of membrane transporters, particularly for uptake of organic nutrients" and "no clear
homologs of eukaryotic sodium, potassium or chloride ion
channels" [3]. It is questionable, however, whether this
reflects a genuine paucity of such proteins in this organism, or
simply shortcomings in the annotation.
Despite ongoing improvements in automated gene annotation, it is widely accepted that the routines involved provide a
first phase of annotation and that the attainment of a highquality annotation requires the intervention of manual curation (reviewed in [4]). Errors that are difficult to avoid in
automated systems for genome annotation include the incorrect prediction of intron/exon boundaries and the position of
the start/stop codons, which can result in incomplete or truncated proteins, or the merging of neighboring proteins [5,6].
The assignment of functional annotations to proteins is hampered by several factors [7], including the non-critical use of
annotations from existing database entries, ignoring multidomain organization of the query proteins and/or the database
hits, and, in the case of P. falciparum, the considerable divergence that generally exists between the parasite and those
organisms for which sequence data is currently available in
the databases [3]. Manual curation affords a greater flexibility
in handling these problems.

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/3/R26

For many of the predicted proteins encoded by P. falciparum
the similarity to their closest non-Plasmodium homologs is
insufficient to permit annotation on the basis of BLAST
searches alone. As highlighted in a recent review of the current status of the malaria parasite genome project [8], the
annotation of these proteins requires an in-depth assessment
by a manual curator using a range of bioinformatic
approaches [7] including position-specific iterated BLAST
(PSI-BLAST), detection of conserved domains, construction
of multiple sequence alignments and comparisons of predicted secondary structure. This process is laborious and
time-consuming, but by combining the information gained
from these analyses, it is possible to arrive at reliable annotations and to gain significant insight into the function of the
proteins of interest.
In this paper we report the results of a detailed analysis of the
permeome of P. falciparum. The study makes use of a computer program that searches a genome database on the basis of
the hydropathy plots of the corresponding proteins [9]. The
approach is based on the observation that the polypeptides
comprising transporter proteins typically possess multiple
hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) and connecting hydrophilic, extra-membrane loops that are detected as
peaks and troughs, respectively, in a plot of the hydrophobicity index of the polypeptide. Many transporters characterized
to date have between eight and 14 TMDs [10]. In searching for
additional candidate transporters, the P. falciparum genome
was therefore scanned for proteins with seven or more TMDs.
Proteins retrieved by this search were subjected to a detailed
analysis, involving the application of several different bioinformatic methods.
The analysis presented here has doubled the number of candidate membrane transport proteins identified in the
genome, as well as attributing putative substrate specificities
and/or transport mechanisms to all of those "transporter,
putative" proteins previously lacking this information. The
newly designated proteins include candidate transporters for
nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, nucleosides and vitamins. There are also transport proteins predicted to be
involved in maintaining the ionic composition of the cell and
in the extrusion of metabolic wastes such as lactate. For 34 of
the candidate transport proteins of particular interest we
have investigated the time-course of expression of mRNA
throughout the asexual blood stage of the parasite.
The enrichment in the repertoire of P. falciparum-encoded
transport proteins reported here indicates that the parasite's
permeome is not as impoverished as was originally thought.

Most of the P. falciparum putative transport proteins
retrieved by the hydropathy plot analysis used here belong to
known transport families and are described in Additional
data file 1. They include new additions to the major facilitator
superfamily, the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily,
and the P-type ATPase superfamily, as well as many others.
Several families not previously identified in the genome, such
as the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily, the peptideacetyl-coenzyme A transporter family, the zinc-iron permease
family and the multi antimicrobial extrusion family, were also
found to have P. falciparum-encoded members.

Transport proteins possessing six or fewer TMDs were not
retrieved by our search criteria and for the most part have
been omitted from the table in Additional data file 1. A limited
number of such candidate transport proteins were identified
in the original genome annotation and are as follows: nine
members of the mitochondrial carrier family; a cation diffusion facilitator; five members of the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) superfamily; a V-type ATPase; an aquaglyceroporin
(PfAQP [11]); and an arsenite-antimonite (ArsAB) effluxer.
Two subunits are required to form a functional ArsAB efflux
pump - an ATP-hydrolyzing component (ArsA) and a channel-forming integral membrane protein (ArsB). To date, only
the ArsA protein has been identified in the P. falciparum
genome and the absence of a parasite ArsB homolog may
indicate that either the ArsA protein does not function as part
of an ArsAB efflux pump or, alternatively, the ArsB protein is
present but remains to be discovered. Likewise, the parasite
has genes encoding the α, β, δ, ε and γ subunits of the catalytic

The expanding inventory of P. falciparum transport
proteins

A number of proteins to which we have assigned a putative
transport function bear no significant sequence similarity to
any functionally characterized proteins (transporters or otherwise) in the current databases. However, they do have
hydropathy plots that resemble those of known transport proteins, consistent with the hypothesis that they too are transporters. These proteins fall into two categories: proteins that
are related to 'hypothetical proteins' from other organisms
(Additional data file 2); and novel, Plasmodium-specific proteins (Additional data file 3).

TMDs retrieved 167 candidate proteins. These proteins were
categorized into three broad classes according to their putative functions (transport, non-transport or no putative function) as predicted by bioinformatic analyses. Known or
putative transport functions were assigned to 89 (53%) of the
retrieved proteins. A further 50 (30%) proteins were categorized as having functions that are non-transport related;
these included various transferases, receptors, and proteins
involved in trafficking and secretion (such as protein translocases), many of which have escaped annotation. The remaining 28 (17%) proteins had no non-Plasmodium sequence
homologs or similarities to conserved domains, and did not
resemble transporters in structure (see Figure 1); they therefore could not be ascribed a putative function.

that of a protein designated as having no putative function (PF14_0435). The PF14_0541 protein is a putative V-type H+-pumping pyrophosphatase (H+PPase) and its hydropathy plot shows around 15 peaks in the hydrophobicity index, corresponding to 15 predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) - as is
characteristic of H+-PPases. The PFI0955w protein is a putative sugar transporter of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and its hydropathy plot
indicates the presence of 12 TMDs. The PF13_0172 protein bears no sequence similarities with any known or putative transport proteins but its
hydropathy plot shows around 11 peaks in the hydrophobicity index and resembles that of a typical transporter (for example, PF14_0541 or PFI0955w).
The PF14_0435 protein has no non-Plasmodium sequence homologs or similarities to conserved domains, and although it is predicted to possess eight or
nine putative TMDs, the hydropathy plot of the PF14_0435 protein does not resemble that of a typical transporter. The predicted TMDs are irregularly
spaced (those in typical transporters tend to show more regularity of spacing, as in the first three hydropathy plots shown) and there are several very large
extramembrane domains interspersed among the TMDs (many transporters have a single large extramembrane domain in the middle of the protein, but it
is unusual for there to be multiple, irregularly spaced extramembrane domains of the type evident in PF14_0435). The possibility that the PF14_0435
protein (and others like it) is a transporter can certainly not be excluded; however there is simply not sufficient evidence to warrant its classification as
such in the present study. The hydropathy plots were generated using the TMpred server [114].

Classification of the above proteins can be found at Ian

proteins possessing six or fewer TMDs has recently been
extended by the description of a P. falciparum homolog of an
unusual bifunctional protein that contains an amino-terminal
K+ channel and a carboxy-terminal adenylate cyclase [13].
Only 54 transport proteins were identified in the original
genome annotation and many of these are designated with
generic descriptions such as 'transporter, putative', from
which no information can be gained about the probable
mechanism of transport or substrate specificity. Our analysis
has retrieved a further 55 putative transport proteins, as well
as attributing putative substrate specificities and/or transport mechanisms to all of those previously without (see Additional data file 1). This brings the total number of putative/
proven P. falciparum-encoded transport proteins to 109. Of

Predicting the cellular localization of P. falciparum
transport proteins
Many transport proteins are located at the surface of the parasite, where they mediate the flux of solutes across the plasma
membrane. Other transport proteins are found in the membranes of intracellular compartments such as those of the apicoplast, mitochondrion, digestive vacuole and organelles of
the secretory pathway. The likely destination(s) within the
cell of a given transporter can often be inferred by signals
present in its polypeptide sequence and/or by its close homology to a transport protein of a known cellular localization. For
example, the signal peptide required for the targeting of
nuclear-encoded proteins to the parasite's apicoplast has
been elucidated [14] and several P. falciparum transport proteins contain this type of signal (see Additional data files 1, 2
and 3). These putative apicoplast transporters include the
parasite homolog of the plant chloroplast phosphoenolpyruvate:Pi antiporters (PFE1510c [3]) as well as a putative aminoacid transporter (PFL1515c), several ABC transporters
(PFC0125w, PF11_0466 and PF13_0271), P-ATPases
(PFE0805w and PF07_0115) and other putative transport
proteins of unknown function (PFL2410w, PF13_0172 and
PFE1525w). Likewise, the nine parasite mitochondrial carriers contain putative signals for targeting these transporters to
the mitochondrion. One of these, the putative phosphate carrier protein (MPC, PFL0110c), has been cloned and shown
experimentally to possess mitochondrial targeting signals
[15].
Two putative transporters involved in chloroquine resistance
- the P-glycoprotein homolog 1 (Pgh1 [16]) and the 'chloroquine resistance transporter' (PfCRT [17]) - are localized to
the parasite's digestive vacuole. PfCRT has recently been
shown to be a member of the drug/metabolite transporter
superfamily [18-20] and possesses several putative endosomal-lysosomal targeting signals (R.E.M. and K.K., unpublished work). The parasite V-type H+-ATPase is also found at
the digestive vacuole membrane [21] and plays the major role
in the acidification of the lumen [22]. There is experimental
evidence for the presence of another proton pump at the vacuolar membrane, a K+-dependent, H+-translocating pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) [22], although it is unclear which of
the two parasite-encoded H+-PPases [23] is responsible for
this activity. From its strong homology to Niemann-Pick typeC proteins (implicated in the efflux of lipids and cholesterol
from lysosomes [24,25]) the PFA0375c protein is predicted to

Gardner et al. [3] inappropriately assigned a putative transport function to several P. falciparum proteins. The protein
encoded by locus PFL0620c is designated as a putative
choline transporter, yet it shares strong sequence similarities
with known and putative glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases from a range of organisms, including the SCT1 protein
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Indeed, the PFL0620c protein
has recently been shown experimentally to be a glycerol-3phosphate acyltransferase [32]. The annotation of PFL0620c
as a transporter mostly probably arose from a misinterpretation of the function of SCT1 (Suppressor of a Choline Transport Mutant). As the name implies, the SCT1 protein was first
identified in yeast for its ability to complement a growth
defect caused by a deficiency in choline transport [33]. SCT1
was subsequently found to catalyze the acylation of glycerol 3phosphate in the first step of phospholipid biosynthesis;
hence, SCT1 restored growth in the mutant by stimulating the
synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, not by increasing choline
uptake [34].

reviews

Several transport proteins are dedicated to performing specialized tasks in the secretory pathway and specific 'retention'
motifs participate in the sorting of these proteins between the
membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the various Golgi compartments [27,28]. The nucleoside-sugar transporters are found exclusively at the membranes of the ER and
Golgi apparatus of eukaryotes, where they mediate the uptake
of nucleotide derivates (for example, UDP-galactose, UDPglucose and GDP-fucose) from the cytosol in exchange for the
corresponding nucleoside monophosphate (reviewed in
[29,30]). The nucleotide sugars are then used by specific glycosyl-transferases to add sugar moieties to (glycosylate) proteins and lipids that are transported through the secretory
pathway. The parasite's UDP-galactose:UMP antiporter
homolog (which contains a retention motif) and other putative nucleotide-sugar transporters (such as PFB0535w and
PFE0260w) are predicted to be residents of the secretory
pathway organelles.

homology to the endosomal Fe2+ 'NRAMP2' transporters
(involved in the transferrin cycle [26]), and most probably
catalyzes the H+-driven efflux of Fe2+ into the cytoplasm.

to form a cytosolic complex for the assembly of Fe-S clustercontaining proteins, or with (unknown) membrane proteins
to form an Fe-S ABC exporter [38]. PF14_0321 encodes for a
short polypeptide (171 residues) which displays a weak
homology to other soluble ATPases of unknown function
from a wide range of organisms. Finally, the PF08_0098 protein is a member of the ABC1 family, which is distinct from,
and unrelated to, the ATP-binding proteins of the ABC superfamily. ABC1 proteins are novel chaperonins essential for
electron transfer in the bc1 segment of the respiratory chain

(Escherichia coli AarF [40]).
Gardner et al. [3] reported the presence of 16 P-type ATPases

are listed at TransportDB [41]. Four of these - PFI1205c,
PF10_0096, PF13_0137 and MAL13P1.352 - have no
sequence similarities to known or putative P-ATPases, or to
conserved domains of the P-ATPase superfamily. Furthermore, PF10_0096, PF13_0137 and MAL13P1.352 do not possess any putative TMDs. The PF13_0137 and MAL13P1.352
proteins display weak sequence similarities to conserved
domains of the asparagine synthase (AsnB) and the nuclear
cap-binding protein families, respectively, whereas the
PF10_0096 protein is unrelated to any proteins or conserved
domains in the current databases. PFI1205c encodes a large
protein (1,249 residues) possessing 12-13 putative TMDs, and
while this protein also lacks any similarities to conserved
domains, it does appear to be a member of a putative transporter family specific to apicomplexans (see Additional data

The expression of 34 putative transport genes was analyzed
throughout the asexual blood stage of the parasite. In previous studies, comparisons between the levels of transcripts
present at different developmental stages of the parasite have
been made from samples standardized to total RNA (see, for
example [42-44]). In this study we quantified the amount of
total RNA produced by the parasite as it progressed through
the intraerythrocytic life cycle. As shown in Figure 3, the
quantity of RNA in the infected erythrocyte increased significantly as the parasite grew from ring to trophozoite stage.
There was 136 ± 19 (n = 2; ± range/2) times more total RNA
in late trophozoites/schizonts (around 40 hours old) than in
ring-stage parasites (around 8 hours old) and 161 ± 21 (n = 2;
± range/2) times more than in young rings (around 4 hours
old). We therefore measured and compared transcript levels
at different growth stages of the parasite from samples standardized to cell number rather than to total RNA (see below for
further discussion).
In the following sections we consider in turn a number of different families of transport proteins, members of which have
been identified and their stage-dependent mRNA expression
characterized in this study.

Members of the major facilitator superfamily
The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is one of the largest
classes of transporters; its members are prevalent in organisms from all kingdoms of life and are diverse in both
sequence and function [45]. MFS transporters of the same
subfamily tend to transport related substrates, and solutes
transported by MFS proteins include sugars, metabolites,
amino acids, peptides, nucleosides, polyols, drugs and

Five of the P. falciparum-encoded MFS transporters (the
PFB0275w, PFE0825w, PF11_0059, PF14_0260 and
PF14_0387 proteins) display a weak relationship with members of the 'drug-H+ antiporter-1' family. PFB0275w and
PF14_0260 share extensive amino-acid sequence homology
with one another and are related to putative transporters
from plants (see Additional data file 1 and 4). The expression
profiles of these two genes were strikingly different: the
PF14_0260 transcript was present at a low level very early in
parasite development and reached a maximum over the 3642-hour period, whereas transcription of PFB0275w occurred
quite late in the cycle (Figure 5). The PF11_0059 protein is
weakly related to putative multidrug resistance transporters
but also bears some similarity to transporters of another subfamily of the MFS, the anion:cation symporter family (Additional data file 4). It is therefore possible that the PF11_0059
protein mediates the transport of organic anions, such as glucarate, biotin, phthalate or pantothenate (substrates of the
anion:cation symporter family), rather than the efflux of
drugs or metabolites such as polyamines, lactose or arabinose
(substrates of the drug-H+ antiporter-1 family). The level of
PF11_0059 transcript increased rapidly between 16 and 24
hours and reached a maximum between 32 and 36 hours,
after which it decreased dramatically (Figure 5). The closest
BLASTP homolog of PFE0825w is a mouse protein designated as a 'putative organic cation transporter'. However, the
mouse protein is not a member of the organic cation transporter family of the MFS, but does show good homology to a
tumour suppressing STF-like protein from C. elegans and a
weaker similarity to a putative tetracycline resistance protein

deposited research

The P. falciparum members of the sugar porter family
include the hexose transporter (PfHT1/PFB0210c [46]), and
the putative transporters PFI0785c and PFI0955w. Of these
proteins, PfHT1 (which functions primarily to transport glucose) shows the greatest similarity to glucose transporters
from other organisms, including mammals (Additional data
file 4). In our expression analysis PfHT1 transcript was found
to be present relatively early in the intraerythrocytic life cycle
(around 8 hours post-invasion, Figure 4) and to increase rapidly in abundance between 16 and 24 hours, after which the
level of transcript stabilized temporarily before increasing
again to reach a maximum at approximately 36 hours. There
is significant sequence homology between PFI0955w and
PfHT1 (Additional data file 4); nevertheless, PFI0955w has
diverged somewhat from the glucose transporters and may
therefore catalyze the transport of other sugars or sugarrelated substances. The transcription of PFI0955w was found
not to begin until the parasite had spent some 24 hours inside
the host cell (Figure 4); the level of transcript then very rapidly reached a maximum at around 32 hours and steadily
decreased thereafter. PFI0785c bears some similarity to both

PfHT1 and PFI0955w, but shows a closer resemblance to two
putative MFS transporters from Cryptosporidium parvum
and a putative plastid hexose transporter from Olea europaea
(Additional data file 4). The PFI0785c transcript was almost
undetectable until very late in the cycle, with the greatest
increase in transcript level occurring between 32 and 40
hours.

organic and inorganic anions. The mechanism of transport
also varies within the superfamily (and sometimes even
within a subfamily) with examples of uniport, solute:solute
exchange, solute:H+ antiport, as well as Na+ or H+:solute symport. Our analysis has doubled the parasite's complement of
MFS transporters from six to 12, and while this still compares
very poorly with other eukaryotes such as S. cerevisiae (85
MFS proteins) and Caenorhabditis elegans (137 MFS proteins), it surpasses that found to date in the parasitic eukaryote Encephalitozoon cuniculi (two MFS proteins) [41]. The P.
falciparum proteins fall within either the sugar porter,
drug:H+ antiporter-1, monocarboxylate porter or peptideacetyl-coenzyme A transporter families, although one protein
displays only a weak relationship to the MFS and could not be
placed reliably within a family (PFL0170w, see Additional
data file 4).

from Gloeobacter violaceus (see Additional data file 4;
sequences of several organic cation transporters are provided
for comparison). The PF14_0387 protein also displays a weak
similarity to the G. violaceus protein as well as to an
Escherichia coli putative arabinose effluxer, and in the
sequence alignment shown in Additional data file 4, the
PFE0825w and PF14_0387 proteins are placed within the
same cluster. The transcription of PF14_0387 increases rapidly between 16 and 24 hours, after which the level of transcript plateaued and then began to decrease after 36 hours
(Figure 5). Expression of the PFE0825w gene was not
studied.
The PFB0465c and PFI1295c proteins share significant
sequence similarities and are related to members of the
monocarboxylate porter and oxalate:formate antiporter families. From the alignment shown in Additional data file 4, it
appears that the PFB0465c protein resembles oxalate:formate antiporters, such as the OxlT-2 from Archaeoglobus
fulgidus, whereas the PFI1295c protein is perhaps more similar to members of the monocarboxylate porter family such as
the rat T-type amino-acid transporter and the human MCT-8
protein. The PFB0465c and PFI1295c genes had similar
expression profiles (Figure 6); in both, the maximum level of
transcript occurred at approximately 36 hours post-invasion.
However, the transcription of PFI1295c began earlier in the
development of the intraerythrocytic parasite.
The locus PF10_0360 appears to contain open reading
frames (ORFs) for three different proteins. One of these
(amino-acid residues 1,644-2,222) displays strong homology
to the acetyl-CoA:CoA antiporters of the ER (Additional data
file 4). Expression of the PF10_0360 gene was not studied.

MFS-related families
The malaria parasite encodes members of the glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide:cation symporter (GPH), organo anion

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/3/R26

transporter (OAT) and folate-biopterin transporter (FBT)
families, which are all relatives of the major facilitator superfamily [45]. The PFE1455w protein is a putative Na+- or H+driven sugar symporter of the GPH family and the mRNA
transcript of this gene was found to be most abundant
between 32 and 40 hours post-invasion (Figure 7). The
MAL6P1.283 protein belongs to a family of putative transporters from bacteria, plants and animals, members of which
exhibit weak similarities to proteins and conserved domains
of both the MFS and the OAT family (Additional data file 1
and 5). Members of the OAT family catalyze the transport of
organic anion and cations and are found only within the animal kingdom. While the MAL6P1.383 protein and its
relatives are only weakly similar to OAT proteins, in the
absence of a more appropriate classification we have tentatively placed these proteins within the OAT family. Expression of the MAL6P1.383 gene was not studied.
The genes MAL8P1.13, PF11_0172 and PF10_0215 encode
members of the FBT family. Proteins of this family are found
only in cyanobacteria, protozoa and plants, and are thought to
function as H+ symporters. Thus far, only protozoan transporters have been characterized and these are known to
mediate the uptake of the vitamins folate and/or biopterin
(for example, FT1 [47] and BT1 [48] from Leishmania and
FT1 from Trypanosoma brucei [49]). The MAL8P1.13 and
PF11_0172 proteins share significant sequence similarities
and as they are closely related to known or putative FBT proteins (see Additional data file 1 and 5), it is likely that they too
catalyze the uptake of folate and/or biopterin. Both compounds contain the pteridine group, and members of this
family may also transport pteridine (not itself a vitamin),
though this has not been demonstrated directly. There is significant sequence divergence between the PF10_0215 protein
and members of the FBT family and it is quite feasible that
this protein transports other metabolites and/or vitamins.
The expression profiles of the MAL8P1.13, PF11_0172 and
PF10_0215 genes are compared in Figure 7.

A family of novel putative transporters
We have assigned a putative transport function to 19 P. falciparum proteins that bear no significant sequence similarities
to known or putative transport proteins, but which have
hydropathy plots that are similar to those of known
transporters. Within this group is a set of five proteins
(PFA0240w, PFA0245w, PFC0530w, PFI0720w and
PF11_0310) that share both sequence and structural homology, but which lack sequence similarity to any other proteins
in the current databases. Several lines of evidence suggest
that these proteins may share a common ancestry with transporters of the MFS, and for this reason they have been
included in the table in Additional data file 1, where they are
designated as P. falciparum novel putative transporters
(PfNPTs). The PfNPTs share a common topology, consisting
of 12 TMDs separated by a hydrophilic loop into two sets of six
closely spaced TMDs (Additional data file 6). Such a topology

Amino-acid transporters

information

We have designated six P. falciparum-encoded proteins as
putative amino-acid transporters. Three (MAL6P1.133,
PFL0420w and PFL1515c) are members of the amino acid/
auxin permease (AAAP) family. The other three (PFB0435c,
PFE0775c and PF11_0334) are members of the neurotransmitter:Na+ symporter (NSS) family. Proteins of the AAAP
family are known to mediate the transport of a specific amino
acid (for example, the proline permease of Arabidopsis thaliana [50]), or of a group of similar amino acids (for example,
the neutral amino-acid permease of Neurospora crassa [51]),
while several members exhibit very broad specificities,
transporting all naturally occurring amino acids (for example,
the general amino-acid transporter of A. thaliana [52]).
AAAP proteins are found in yeast, protozoans, plants and
animals, and transport is usually either H+- and/or Na+-

closely resembles that found among transporters of the MFS
and, consistent with this observation, one of the PfNPTs
(PFA0245w) has a putative match to a conserved domain of
the MFS. Furthermore, two or more iterations of a PSIBLAST search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database using a PfNPT as the query sequence
retrieves, with good significance, several putative MFS proteins. A characteristic of most members of the MFS family is
the presence of a conserved amino-acid sequence between
TMDs 2 and 3 and a related but less conserved motif in the
corresponding loop in the second half of the protein (between
TMDs 8 and 9). As shown in Additional data file 6, each
PfNPT protein contains a putative MFS-specific motif
between TMDs 2 and 3 and between TMDs 8 and 9, consistent with the hypothesis that these proteins are distantly
related to the MFS. The PFC0530w and PFI0720w genes
were found to share a similar pattern of expression over the
asexual blood stage of the parasite, whereas the remaining

diverged considerably from the other family members (Additional data file 1 and 8), making it difficult to ascertain a putative substrate(s) for each transporter. Nevertheless, it does
appear that the parasite proteins may bear more similarities
to the NSS members which transport amino acids, than they
do to those which transport other neurotransmitters or
osmolytes.

Figure 9 shows the stage-dependent gene expression for each
of the six Plasmodium putative amino-acid transporters. Significant levels of PFB0435c, PF11_0334 or PFL0420w transcript were present only in the second 24-hour period of
parasite development and expression of the PFL1515c and
PFE0775c genes began in earnest only slightly earlier (at
around 20 hours). By contrast, there was a relatively high
level of MAL6P1.133 transcript early in parasite development
and the expression of this gene continued throughout the
intraerythrocytic stage.

dependent [53-55]. The MAL6P1.133 protein appears to share
the greatest level of sequence similarity with amino-acid
transporters from other protozoans, yeast and mammals
(Additional data file 7). The PFL0420w and PFL1515c proteins are closely related (Additional data file 1) and appear to
be most similar in sequence to amino-acid transporters from
plants and insects (Additional data file 7). The PFL1515c
protein contains a putative signal for targeting to the apicoplast membrane.
Substrates of NSS transporters include amino acids, neurotransmitters and other related nitrogenous compounds such
as taurine (a sulfonic amino acid) and creatine. NSS proteins
are found only in archaea, bacteria and animals, and most of
the transporters characterized so far operate via a solute:Na+
symport mechanism (for example, the tryptophan:Na+ symporter of Symbiobacterium thermophilum [56] and the
mammalian neutral amino acid:Na+ symporter [57]). Most
are also Cl--dependent, for example the neutral and cationic
amino acid: Na+:Cl- symporter of humans [58]. Two exceptions are the absorptive amino-acid transporters - CAATCH1
[59] and KAAT1 [60] - from the gut epithelium of the insect
Manduca sexta. These transporters catalyze the Na+-dependent (Km (Na+) ≈ 6 mM) or K+- dependent (Km (K+) ≈ 32 mM)
transport of amino acids when expressed in Xenopus oocytes,
but the low Na+ (less than 5 mM) and high K+ (aproximately
200 mM) concentrations prevalent in the insect gut lumen
ensure that these transporters operate predominately via K+
symport in vivo [60]. The Plasmodium NSS proteins, while

Members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT)
family mediate the uptake of nucleosides and/or nucleobases
and are present in yeast, protozoa and animals. Transport via
ENT proteins is not usually coupled to the movement of a
driving ion (hence the name 'equilibrative'); the exceptions
are three electrogenic nucleoside:H+ symporters from Leishmania donovani [61]. A P. falciparum-encoded ENT, the
PF13_0252 protein, has been characterized in Xenopus
oocytes and shown to transport purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleobases (PfENT1 [62,63]) and a second protein (MAL8P1.32) is annotated in the genome as a putative
nucleoside transporter. We have identified two further P. falciparum putative nucleoside/nucleobase transporters,
PFA0160c and PF14_0662. Each parasite ENT protein displays a predicted secondary structure that is characteristic of
members of the ENT family - 11 TMDs with a large intracellular loop between domains 6 and 7. However, despite this conservation in structure, the four malaria proteins share limited
sequence similarities with each other and are only very
weakly related to ENT proteins from other organisms (Additional data file 1). The expression profiles of the PFA0160c,
MAL8P1.32 and PF13_0252 genes were similar; in each there
was a significant level of transcript present early in parasite
development and a rapid increase in transcript abundance
occurred between 16 and 24 hours, after which the level of
transcript reached a maximum (at around 32 hours) and then
declined slowly (Figure 10). By contrast, the PF14_0662 transcript increased in abundance rapidly between 8-20 hours
and peaked at approximately 36 h.

Inorganic anion transporters
MAL13P1.206 and PF14_0679 are candidate inorganic anion
transporters. The PF14_0679 protein bears strong sequence
similarity to the bacterial members of the large and
ubiquitous sulfate permease (SulP) family (Additional data

Members of the voltage-gated ion channel (VIC) superfamily
are found in all domains of life. The channels characterized
thus far are specific for K+, Na+ or Ca2+ under physiological
conditions. Potassium channels of this superfamily are usually homotetrameric structures, assembled from a polypeptide subunit possessing six TMDs, and contain a central ion
conduction pore (reviewed in [64,65]). Each subunit contains
a highly conserved 'selectivity sequence' in the loop between
TMDs 5 and 6, and in the tetrameric structure these loops are
positioned together to form a 'selectivity filter' which
determines the cation specificity of the channel. There is also
a 'voltage sensor' in TMD 4, which consists of three to nine
regularly spaced, positively charged amino-acid residues.

Yet in a BLASTP search of the NCBI database PfPiT retrieves
the Na+-coupled Pi transporters from animals and yeast with
far greater significance than the H+-coupled Pi transporters of
bacteria and plant chloroplasts. This observation has been
supported by a detailed phylogenetic analysis in which the
Plasmodium PiT protein was found to cluster within the
branch of Na+-dependent PiT proteins (R.E.M., K. Saliba, A.
Bröer, C. McCarthy, M. Downie, R.I.H., R. Allen, S. Bröer and
K.K., unpublished work). Subsequent flux experiments performed with trophozoite-stage parasites revealed the presence of a Na+-dependent Pi transporter at the parasite plasma
membrane, and the expression of the PfPiT protein in Xenopus oocytes has verified its function as Pi:Na+ symporter
(R.E.M., K. Saliba, A. Bröer, C. McCarthy, M. Downie, R.I.H.,

one of which has recently been cloned (PFL1315w [66]).
Unlike most members of the family, the P. falciparum
polypeptides are predicted to possess more than six TMDs;
hence they were retrieved by our search criteria (which specified proteins with seven or more TMDs). The PFL1315w and
PF14_0622 proteins display limited sequence similarities to
known or putative K+ channels from other organisms and are
also only very weakly related to each other (see Additional
data file 1 and 9), but both possess the signature selectivity
sequence of the K+ channel family (Figure 12 and Additional
data file 9). A more extensive bioinformatic study of the
PFL1315w and PF14_0622 proteins will be presented elsewhere (R. Allen and K.K., unpublished work).

Figure 13 depicts the expression profiles of the PFL1315w,
PF14_0342 and PF14_0622 genes. The PFL1315w and
PF14_0342 transcripts were present in the early stages of
parasite development and increased significantly in abundance between 16-24 hours, after which the level of transcript
reached a maximum (at around 36 hours) and then declined.
The PF14_0622 gene had a pattern of expression that was
strikingly distinct from any other presented in this study; as
the intraerythrocytic parasite matured the level of transcript
appeared to rise and fall in successive waves of increasing
amplitude.

Discussion
Enrichment of the P. falciparum permeome

The PF14_0342 protein is closely related to the PFL1315w
protein and a sequence alignment of these two polypeptides
reveals that this similarity extends over most of the lengths of
the proteins (Additional data file 1 and 9). However, the
PF14_0342 polypeptide has undergone some remarkable
changes in the region of the ion-selectivity sequence. The
most noteworthy of these are as follows: the insertion of two
alanines, the presence of threonine in a position that, in
almost every other member of the family, is occupied by
aspartic acid, and the replacement of a neutral amino acid by
a lysine two residues to the left of this position (Figure 12).

In the original annotation of the P. falciparum genome, the
parasite was described as possessing a very limited complement of transport proteins [3]. The detailed bioinformatic
analysis presented here reveals that the parasite permeome is
at least twice as large as first reported, and predicts the presence of a range of transport capabilities that were assumed
previously to be lacking in the parasite. The newly designated
proteins include candidate plasma membrane transporters
for nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, nucleosides and
vitamins. There are also transport proteins predicted to be
involved in maintaining the ionic composition of the cell and

A primary role of plasma membrane Cl- channels in nonexcitable cells is in the volume-regulatory response to cell
volume perturbation [72,73]. It is likely that within the relatively sheltered environment of the host cytoplasm, the
parasite is not exposed to significant permutations in
osmolarity and that it therefore does not require Cl- channels
for this purpose. Furthermore, Cl- channels in the parasite
plasma membrane would facilitate the distribution of Cl- ions
in accordance with the membrane potential. The membrane

refereed research

In their landmark paper Gardner et al. [3] reported "no clear
homologs of eukaryotic sodium, potassium or chloride ion
channels could be identified". However, two putative K+
channels have since been cloned [13,66], and we have
identified an additional putative K+ channel (PF14_0622) as
well as a novel protein of the K+ channel family (PF14_0342).
Our analysis of the P. falciparum genome did not reveal any
putative Cl- channels, and in this respect, our findings agree
with the original annotation. Most organisms, including
many other lower eukaryotes (for example, Dictyostelium
discoideum, Entamoeba histolytica and various species of
fungi), are known to encode at least one member of the ClC
chloride channel family. ClC proteins possess 18 alpha helices
[69], 10-12 of which are typically detected as putative TMDs
by a TMD prediction program, yet our search criteria, which
specified seven or more TMDs, did not retrieve a P. falciparum-encoded ClC protein. To verify this result, we carried
out four iterations of a PSI-BLAST search of the NCBI database using the E. coli ClC protein (gi:26106498) as the query
sequence. The search retrieved 695 ClC proteins from 226 different organisms, including many prokaryotes, unicellular
eukaryotes, plants, and a broad range of animals, but a Plasmodium ClC homolog was not amongst the retrieved proteins. Also absent from the list of retrieved organisms were
two other lower eukaryotes, the apicomplexan protozoan C.
parvum and the microsporidian E. cuniculi, both of which
have been reported as lacking a ClC protein [70,71]. P. falciparum, C. parvum and E. cuniculi are all obligate, intracellular parasites that reside in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and
to date they are the only eukaryotes that appear to lack a ClC
protein. It is tempting, therefore, to speculate that the loss of
ClC proteins in these organisms is related to their parasitic,
intracellular life style.

deposited research

This enrichment in the repertoire of P. falciparum-encoded
transport proteins indicates that the parasite permeome is
not as impoverished as originally thought (although the parasite still cannot be considered to have a transporter-replete
genome, see below). For instance, in the original study of the
genome data it was suggested, on the basis of the apparent
absence of an obvious amino-acid transporter, that the
intraerythrocytic parasite must rely almost completely on the
ingestion and digestion of host hemoglobin for its supply of
amino acids [3]. However, the identification here of several
putative amino-acid transporters, along with previous observations that the parasite is capable of both the import [67]
and export [68] of amino acids, indicates that this is not the
case. The six putative amino-acid transporters we identified
display dissimilar mRNA expression patterns, suggesting that
they fulfill different roles in the rapid development of the
intraerythrocytic parasite. For example, the MAL6P1.133
protein is most closely related to amino-acid transporters

from other protozoans, yeast and mammals, and the expression of this gene throughout the intraerythrocytic stage (Figure 9) suggests that the transporter has an important role in
parasite growth, perhaps as a broad-specificity plasma
membrane permease for amino acids. On the other hand, the
PFL1515c protein is more similar to plant amino-acid transporters, the gene is expressed slightly later in parasite development (Figure 9), and the presence of a putative apicoplast
targeting signal indicates that the protein probably mediates
the transport of amino acids into and/or out of this organelle.

in the extrusion of metabolic wastes such as lactate. Several of
the new transporters are most probably located on intracellular membranes. Some of these are predicted to catalyze the
flux of solutes either into or out of an intracellular compartment (for example, the putative iron effluxer of the digestive
vacuole, PFE1185w), whereas others are predicted to mediate
the exchange of metabolic intermediates between the cytosol
and an organelle lumen (for example, the putative GDPfucose:GMP antiporter of the Golgi, PFB0535w). A number of
the P. falciparum proteins we retrieved with seven or more
TMDs bear no significant sequence similarity to any other
proteins (transporters or otherwise) characterized previously. Yet they have hydropathy plots that are similar to those
of known transport proteins, consistent with the hypothesis
that they too are transporters. Within this group is a subset of
related proteins that form a novel family of putative transporters, which may be very distantly related to the MFS.
These novel putative transporters appear to be specific to
plasmodia and are therefore of potential interest as new antimalarial drug targets.

stage parasite has been estimated as -95 mV [74]. The [Cl-] in
the erythrocyte cytosol is of the order of 95 mM [75] and if Clwere allowed to distribute between the erythrocyte and parasite cytosols on the basis of the membrane potential the [Cl-]
in the parasite cytoplasm would be of the order of 3 mM (calculated via the Nernst equation). On the basis of X-ray microanalysis data [76] it is likely that the [Cl-] in the parasite
cytoplasm is an order of magnitude higher than this, consistent with Cl- being actively accumulated by the parasite, rather
than being allowed to equilibrate via Cl- channels. The accumulation of Cl- by the parasite might be mediated by either a
Cl-:H+ symporter (as is found in plants and fungi [77,78]) or
perhaps a Cl-:anion exchanger (such as the protein we have
annotated as a putative inorganic anion exchanger,
PF14_0679).
The one role in which Cl- channels have been implicated in the
physiology of the intraerythrocytic parasite is in the formation of the 'new permeability pathways' (NPP) that mediate
the increased traffic across the host erythrocyte membrane of
a wide range of low molecular weight solutes, including polyols, amino acids, sugars, vitamins, and both organic and inorganic (monovalent) anions and cations [79]. The NPP show a
marked preference for anions over cations, and for K+ over
Na+ [80]. Their transport properties are those expected of
anion-selective channels [81], and electrophysiological studies have confirmed the presence of such channels in the
infected erythrocyte membrane [82-84]. It has been proposed that these channels are endogenous proteins, activated
by stresses or stimuli associated with the parasite's invasion
of the host cell [83,84]. However, the recent report of strainspecific variations in the properties of a novel inwardly rectifying anion-selective channel induced by the parasite in the
host cell membrane is consistent with the hypothesis that this
channel (termed PESAC for Plasmodium erythrocyte surface
anion channel [85]) is, instead, parasite-encoded [86]. If this
is the case, the lack of an obvious Cl- channel in the P. falciparum genome indicates that it is likely to be a novel type of
channel.
One protein that warrants further consideration in this context is PF14_0342, a very unusual member of the K+ channel
family; it is distinguished from all other K+-channel family
proteins by the presence of several significant mutations in
the region of the ion-selectivity sequence. These include the
substitution of a highly conserved aspartic acid by threonine,
the mutation of a neutral amino acid to a lysine two residues
to the amino terminus of this position, and the insertion of
two alanines (Figure 12). In K+ channels, the conserved aspartic residue is located at the extracellular edge of the pore [64],
where it may create an electrostatic field that 'funnels' K+ ions
into the channel opening. The replacement of this acidic residue by a neutral amino acid, combined with the appearance
of a positively charged lysine residue nearby, raises the possibility that the ion selectivity of the PF14_0342 channel is no
longer strictly cationic, and may even be anionic. The signifi-

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/3/R26

cance of the inserted alanines is difficult to predict, but they
may serve to enlarge the diameter of the selectivity filter and
thereby permit the transport of larger solutes. The putative
ion channel PF14_0342 might therefore be considered as a
candidate for the parasite-induced NPP, and the localization
of the protein within the infected cell, and its physiological
characteristics, are presently under investigation. If the
PF14_0342 protein is indeed a component of the NPP, it may
be anticipated that strain-specific differences in the electrophysiological characteristics of the parasitized erythrocyte
[86] will correlate with a difference(s) in the amino-acid
sequence of PF14_0342.

Na+-dependent transporters and the physiological role
of the NPP
Shortly after invasion by the malaria parasite, the concentration of Na+ in the host erythrocyte cytosol is similar to that in
uninfected erythrocytes, and to that in the cytosol of the parasite itself [76]. There is, therefore, little if any Na+ concentration gradient across the parasite plasma membrane. With the
induction of the NPP at around 12-15 hours, however, there is
a progressive leakage of Na+ into, and K+ out of, the infected
erythrocyte [80], resulting in a marked increase in the [Na+]
in the erythrocyte cytosol and, therefore, a substantial inward
Na+ concentration gradient across the parasite's plasma
membrane [76]. Our identification of several putative Na+coupled transporters in the malaria parasite genome suggests
that a significant component of the parasite's metabolism
might depend on Na+-driven transport processes; the influx
of Na+ via the NPP, and the consequent increase in [Na+] in
the infected erythrocyte cytosol may be important for this reason. The Na+-dependent Pi transporter (PfPiT; R.E.M., K. Saliba, A. Bröer, C. McCarthy, M. Downie, R.IH., R. Allen, S.
Bröer and K.K., unpublished work) provides one example of
how this Na+ gradient can be used to drive the accumulation
of an essential nutrient. Other likely candidates for transporters able to utilize the Na+ gradient across the parasite plasma
membrane to energize solute transport include the three
putative amino acid:Na+ symporters of the NSS family, the
putative Na+- or H+-driven sugar symporter of the GPH
family, the putative MATE antiporter, and one or more of the
P. falciparum MFS transporters.

Standardization of gene-expression levels and stagespecific changes in the total RNA content of
intraerythrocytic P. falciparum
The level of a target mRNA in a sample is usually standardized to an internal reference, such as the expression of a
'housekeeping gene', rRNA or total RNA, in order to compare
the relative abundance of the transcript between different cell
samples. Housekeeping genes, such as that for
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), were
originally thought to be expressed at constant levels, regardless of cell type, developmental stage or experimental manipulation. However, it has become increasingly evident that the
transcripts of housekeeping genes are not always maintained

refereed research

Nevertheless, it should be noted that the extent of similarity
between the mRNA expression profiles obtained when standardizing to cell number (as in this study) and those obtained

Standardization of transcript levels to cell number may also
provide more insight into the likely biological role of the
encoded protein, than standardization to RNA. This is best
illustrated with a specific example. The parasite hexose transporter, PfHT1, provides the major route for the influx of glucose [46,100,101], an essential nutrient required by the
intraerythrocytic malaria parasite for the production of ATP
(via glycolysis). The rate of glycolysis is highly stage specific;
in ring-stage parasites the level of glucose metabolism does
not differ greatly from that measured in uninfected erythrocytes, but as the young parasite matures into a trophozoite
there is a dramatic increase in the rate of glycolysis and the
maximum level of glucose consumption occurs in the schizont
stage [94,102,103]. Given the central role of PfHT1 in glucose

deposited research

Two recent large-scale studies have analyzed the transcriptome of the malaria parasite as it progresses through the
intraerythrocytic cycle [42,43]. The Le Roch et al. [43] study
examined the mRNA levels of approximately 95% of the predicted P. falciparum genes at six points in the intraerythrocytic cycle, whereas Bozdech and colleagues [42] measured
gene expression at 1-hour intervals over the complete 48hour cycle, thereby providing an impressive and
comprehensive investigation of the transcriptome of asexual
blood-stage P. falciparum. Both of these studies standardized
mRNA levels to total RNA, which hinders gene-wise comparisons with the present work.

Standardization of mRNA levels to cell number, as in the
present study, allows the level of a given transcript to be
measured independently of the expression of other genes,
rRNA or total RNA, all of which are parameters that are likely,
or known, to change drastically during the intraerythrocytic
cycle. The expression profiles we present reflect the number
of copies of the transcript inside the cell and illustrate how
this quantity changes as the parasite progresses from early
ring stage through to schizont stages. From this it is
immediately apparent how the expression of the gene is being
regulated - independent of any other variable.

reports

The substantial change in the RNA content of the parasite did
not occur as a constant, linear increase from invasion through
to maturity. Rather, the level of RNA remained very low early
in the parasite's occupation of the erythrocyte (increasing
only slightly in the first 16 hours), then increased rapidly
between 20 to 40 hours and declined at 42 hours (Figure 3).
This pattern correlates well with the onset at 20-30 hours of
a broad range of metabolic activities in the parasite [92,9496] and of the eventual downregulation of many of these
activities in the late stages (schizont/segmenter) of parasite
maturation [97-99].

when standardizing to total RNA (as in the previous studies)
depends to a large extent on the amount of transcript present
in the ring-stage (the first 16-20 hours of the intraerythrocytic
phase). For example, for those genes for which there is a
substantial amount of transcript present in the ring stage, and
which undergo a further increase during the second half of
the intraerythrocytic cycle (for example, PFC0530w,
PF11_0310 and MAL6P1.133), normalization of transcript
level relative to total RNA will tend to show the mRNA level
to be initially elevated relative to that seen in mature parasites
and to then undergo a decrease as the parasite matures,
whereas normalization to cell number will show a progressive
increase in transcript level as the parasite matures (for example, Figures 8 and 9); that is, the two different types of profiles
will look quite different. By contrast, for those genes for which
transcript is rare or absent in ring-stage parasites but
increases as the parasite matures (for example, PFB0435c,
PFL0170w and PFA0245w), then the profiles obtained using
the two different normalization methods are likely to share
some resemblances, particularly in the second half of the
intraerythrocytic cycle, where both modes of normalization
will show increases in transcript levels. In summary, the relationship between the two datasets is highly complex, and the
apparent differences or similarities observed between the
profiles produced using these different methods will depend
on such factors as the stage at which the transcription of a
given gene begins, the rate at which the level of transcript
increases, and the point at which the level of transcript
reaches a maximum.

reviews

Standardization to total RNA may be an appropriate strategy
when the (average) amount of total RNA per cell is similar in
each of the samples. It is less appropriate for quantifying levels of gene expression between cells of grossly differing transcriptional activities [88,90,91]. In cells that are very
transcriptionally active (and hence contain a high total RNA
content) a target transcript will appear to be at a disproportionately low level in comparison with that quantified in transcriptionally quiescent cells (containing less total RNA) in
which the actual copy number of the target transcript is the
same. In this study we measured the total RNA content of
malaria parasites as they progressed through the intraerythrocytic lifecycle and found there to be around 160 times more
RNA in late trophozoites/schizonts (around 40 hours old)
than in young ring-stage parasites (around 4 hours old) (Figure 3). This is in agreement with previous findings of a considerably elevated rate of transcription in trophozoites
compared with ring-stage parasites [92,93].

at constant levels in the cell [44,87,88]; nor is it likely that
there are mRNA species which are. Likewise, the level of
rRNA in the cell is also known to vary in relation to factors
such as cell type and age [88,89]. Hence, the use of either a
housekeeping gene mRNA or rRNA as an internal standard
has lost merit [88], and standardization to total RNA has
emerged as the method of choice for comparing mRNA levels
between different cell samples [90,91].

uptake [46,100,101], it might be expected that the profile of
PfHT1 expression will reflect the significant increase in the
demand for glucose uptake by the maturing parasite. Indeed,
when gene expression is standardized to cell number, the
greatest increase in the level of PfHT1 mRNA occurs at the
transition between the ring and trophozoite stages of the parasite (16-24 hours) and the maximum level is reached early in
the schizont stage (Figure 4). Yet when standardized to total
RNA (see [104]), the level of PfHT1 transcript appears to be
most abundant in the ring-stage parasite (when relatively little glycolysis is occurring) and decreases rapidly as the parasite develops into a trophozoite, remaining at a low level
throughout the parasite's most intense period of growth.

Trends in the expression profiles of P. falciparum
transport genes
All the genes for which mRNA expression was analyzed were
transcriptionally active during the asexual intraerythrocytic
stage of P. falciparum, albeit for varying durations. For 13 of
the 34 genes investigated there was a readily detectable
amount of transcript present from 8 hours through to 42
hours; these included genes encoding proteins known to
transport inorganic phosphate (PfPiT), glucose (PfHT1) and
nucleosides (PfENT1) and for putative transporters of nucleosides/nucleobases (PFA0160c and MAL8P1.32), amino
acids (MAL6P1.133), monocarboxylates (PFI1295c) as well as
a putative K+ channel (PFL1315w) and novel ion channel
(PF14_0342). Three of the 13 genes encode for members of
the novel putative transporter family (PFC0530w, PFI0720w
and PF11_0310) and while the likely substrate(s) of each of
these transporters are unknown, the expression of the genes
from early ring-stage parasites through to late schizonts suggests that these proteins each play an important role in the
biochemistry of the intraerythrocytic parasite, presumably by
mediating the transport of an important solute(s). By 16
hours post-invasion, the number of genes for which transcript
could be detected had increased from 13 to 25, although in
many cases the level of mRNA was still quite low (for example, the putative anion exchanger (PF14_0679) and three
amino-acid transporters (PFE0775c, PF11_0334 and
PFL1515c) amongst others). The transcripts of a few genes
(PF14_0387, PF14_0342, PF14_0662 and PFL1315w)
underwent a rapid increase in abundance between 16 and 20
hours, but for the majority of transport genes the rate of
increase in transcript level was highest either between 20 to
24 hours (17 genes) or 24 to 32 hours (seven genes).
There is a small subset of transport genes which have expression profiles that depart from this trend. Transcripts of three
transport genes (PFB0275w, PFB0435c and PFI0785c) were
not detected until very late in the intraerythrocytic cycle (at
32 hours) and reached maximum abundance at 40-42 hours.
These genes encode for putative transporters of drugs and
metabolites, amino acids and sugars, respectively, and their
selective expression in the late trophozoite and schizont
stages suggests that the proteins are required for the develop-

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/3/R26

ment of late schizonts and/or merozoite morphogenesis.
Perhaps the most intriguing pattern of gene expression presented in this study is that of the putative K+ channel
PF14_0622. Most transport genes in this study display a
monophasic expression profile, with a single maximum and a
single minimum, indicating that the gene is activated for transcription only once during the intraerythrocytic stage. This
has been reported to be the case for the majority of P. falciparum genes expressed in the asexual blood cycle [42].
However, the expression of the PF14_0622 gene is strikingly
distinct, in that the level of transcript rose and fell in successive waves of increasing amplitude as the parasite developed.
The physiological significance of this expression pattern is
unclear. Previous work has revealed that the timing of gene
expression can determine the cellular localization of the
resulting protein; when the apical membrane antigen-1 gene
(AMA-1) is expressed in the late schizont/segmenter stage,
the AMA-1 protein is targeted to the rhoptries (its normal destination), but the expression of AMA-1 in maturing trophozoites and during early schizogony (when rhoptries are
absent) results in AMA-1 being targeted to the parasite
plasma membrane as well as to a cytoplasmic location [105].
Therefore, one possibility could be that the PF14_0622 channel is being targeted to different membranes within the parasitized cell, depending upon the timing of expression.

Comparison of the P. falciparum permeome with that
of other organisms
The 54 transport proteins that were originally identified in
the malaria genome account only for approximately 1% of the
genes encoded by P. falciparum, and although our analysis
has increased this to around 2.1% (109 proteins), this is still
low, even when compared to other seemingly transporterdeficient microorganisms. For example, the archeon Methanococcus jannaschii is currently the prokaryote with the
lowest percentage of transport proteins in its genome [106],
but at 2.4% this is still higher than that found to date in P. falciparum. The intracellular parasite E. cuniculi has a remarkably reduced genome (around 2.9 Mb [71]) and encodes only
43 transport proteins [12]. However, these account for 2.2%
of its genes; this unicellular eukaryote is therefore also
slightly more transporter-rich than the malaria parasite.
Other eukaryotic genomes have higher proportions of transport proteins; for example, S. cerevisiae (4.2%), A. thaliana
(3.2%), Drosophila melanogaster (4.6%) and Homo sapiens
(around 3.4%). At the high end of the spectrum is the E. coli
genome, with an impressive repertoire of transporters
accounting for 7.1% of the total number of genes [12].
The relative abundance of transport proteins can also be
measured in terms of the number of transport genes per Mb
of DNA. For the P. falciparum genome this is 4.7 (up from 2.3
estimated from the original annotation) transport genes per
megabase, compared with E. cuniculi (17.2 per Mb), S. cerevisiae (22 per Mb) and an average of 36 transport genes per
Mb across 18 species of prokaryotes [107]. The Plasmodium

investigate whether the observed sequence homologies corresponded to a similarity in the predicted structures of the proteins. Such an analysis is of particular assistance when the

Identifying putative membrane transport proteins

interactions

Materials and methods

A combination of bioinformatics tools was used to assign
putative functions to the (probable) membrane proteins
retrieved from the hydropathy plot analysis. Each sequence
was queried against the NCBI nonredundant protein database (using BLASTP [110]) and the Entrez Conserved Domain
Database (using reverse position-specific BLAST [111]) in
order to determine its relationship to other proteins. The values presented in Additional data file 1 are from analyses carried out in the second half of 2003. In some instances, there
was only a weak similarity between the P. falciparum protein
and a Conserved Domain Database entry and/or the closest
(non-Plasmodium yoelii) BLASTP homolog. For such cases,
the possibility of a common ancestry between the Plasmodium protein and proteins from other organisms was
explored further by performing several iterations of a PSIBLAST [112] search of the NCBI database. Comparisons of
both protein sequence and predicted secondary structure (see
below) were used to evaluate alternate models for each gene;
in several cases it was found that a gene prediction other than
the 'official' model provided a more likely candidate protein.
Where applicable, P. falciparum proteins were placed into
known transport protein families according to the official
transporter classification system [10].

refereed research

The identification of genes and the prediction of intron-exon
structures in the P. falciparum genome are still being refined.
For a number of the previously unannotated transport proteins there were inappropriate predictions for the 5'/3' ends
and/or intron-exon boundaries (for example, PF14_0387,
PFI1295c, PF10_0360, PF10_0215) and it is most likely this
that led to their being overlooked in the original annotation
process. Subsequent revisions of the genome data, using the
latest gene-finding tools, comparative genomics and the integration of full-length cDNA sequences and proteomics data,
will greatly improve the existing annotation of the genome
and this, in turn, is likely to lead to further additions to the P.
falciparum permeome.

Annotation of proteins

deposited research

Although the analysis reported here has increased significantly the number of transport proteins predicted to be
present in P. falciparum it is highly likely that more parasiteencoded transport proteins remain to be uncovered. Our
search criteria were targeted towards identifying transporters
with seven or more TMDs; however, many of the polypeptides
which form channels possess fewer than six TMDs and several types of transporters also contain fewer than six TMDs.
The fact that the parasite has three putative channels
(PFL1315w, PF14_0342 and PF14_0622) indicates that these
types of transport proteins are indeed present in the P. falciparum genome. Applying the methodology used here to proteins which possess six or fewer TMDs is likely to identify
additional transport proteins.

The TMD-based search tool at PlasmoDB was used to search
for further putative membrane proteins. In these analyses,
either the TMHMM2 or TMpred algorithms were used to scan
for proteins possessing 7-25 TMDs. The list of proteins
retrieved by the TMHMM2 and TMpred programs was compared with that already retrieved using the original program,
and while there were a few proteins that the original program
had retrieved and PlasmoDB had not, and vice versa, the
results were mostly in agreement. The additional proteins
identified at PlasmoDB were included in the subsequent
annotation studies.

reports

Future work

tides with seven or more TMDs were retrieved from this
dataset using a computer program described previously [9].
Briefly, in an automated process, each polypeptide sequence
was converted to a hydropathy plot and the number of peaks,
corresponding to putative TMDs, detected. Proteins which
satisfied the search criteria (those having between 250 and
5,000 residues in length and with seven or more TMDs; see
Additional data file 10 for full details) were retrieved, and
duplicate sequences were removed.

reviews

The conclusion that the malaria parasite is 'minimalistic' with
regard to transporters implies that there may well be relatively little redundancy (that is, the parasite tends not to have
multiple transporters for particular roles). Compounds that
inhibit a single transporter may therefore be highly effective
as antimalarials, as the parasite is unlikely to have alternative
transporters that it is able to use for the same purpose.

Martin et al. R26.17

comment

catalog of transport proteins is even more conspicuously
meager when compared to the transporter-rich genomes of E.
coli, Bacillus subtilis and Hemophilus influenzae, which have
66, 63 and 52 transport genes per Mb, respectively [12]. However, although the genomes of higher eukaryotes typically
encode hundreds of transport proteins, they too have low
numbers of transport genes relative to genome size (for example, A. thaliana, 6.7 per megabase and D. melanogaster, 5.3
per Mb). The human genome, which has the largest number
of transport proteins (around 1,200), has the lowest relative
abundance of transport genes to date (0.37 per Mb [12]).

sequence similarity shared by two proteins is weak; a good
agreement between their respective secondary structures
adds support to the hypothesis that these proteins share a
similar function. It also serves to identify those P. falciparum
putative transporters that are truncated or fused to proteins
from adjacent genes as a result of errors in the prediction of
gene structures. The number and spatial arrangement of
putative membrane-spanning domains in a polypeptide was
predicted using TMpred [114] and TMMHM v2.0 [115].

Construction of alignments
The ClustalW program [116] in MacVector 7.1 was used to
generate and edit all alignments. Alignments were converted
to PDF form and compiled in Adobe Photoshop 6.0.1. Fulllength versions of the alignments presented or mentioned in

ing uninfected red blood cells) to 9 × 107 (6 × 108), and even
up to 2.7 × 108 (1.8 × 109), still gave proportionate increases
in the RNA yield, indicating that the binding capacity of the
column was not exceeded within this range. For mature
trophozoites, however, the relationship between the cell sample size and the amount of RNA extracted became nonlinear
when more than 6 × 107 (4 × 108) cells were applied to the column. The quantities of parasites from which RNA was
extracted (per column) are as follows: ring-stage, 1.3 × 108
parasites (8.7 × 108 cells in total including uninfected red
blood cells); late ring stage/early trophozoite, 8.8 × 107 parasites (5.86 × 108 cells in total); and mature trophozoite/schizont, 4.4 × 107 parasites (2.93 × 108 cells in total). The
amount of RNA extracted from the first time point (~4 h postinvasion) was exceedingly low (< 0.3 µg/108 parasites) and
insufficient to warrant this sample's inclusion in the subsequent gene-expression analyses.

Preparation of P. falciparum-infected red blood cells
Human red blood cells (type O+) infected with P. falciparum
(strain FAF6) were cultured as described previously [74]
using a method adopted from Trager and Jensen [117]. The
hematocrit was maintained at 4% and the parasitemia at 1316%. Tightly synchronized cultures were achieved by repeated
applications of sorbitol lysis [118] over a 9-day period immediately before the RNA extractions commenced. Cell counts
were made using an improved Neubauer counting chamber
and both the culture parasitemia and the parasite growth
stage were assessed by methanol-fixed, Giemsa-stained blood
smears. Photographs of the blood smears were taken with a
SPOT RT colour camera connected to a Leica DML microscope and images of parasite-infected red blood cells were
compiled in Adobe Photoshop 6.0.1.

Isolation of total RNA
Culture samples were collected at nine stages over a single
intraerythrocytic growth cycle of the parasite and total RNA
was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (MachereyNagel) in accordance with the 'high yield protocol' supplied
by the manufacturer. This procedure is reported to recover
90-100% of the RNA bound to the column and in control
experiments in which as little as 200 ng of RNA was loaded
onto a column we confirmed this to be the case (data not
shown). A NucleoSpin column can bind a maximum of 100 µg
of nucleic acid and the manufacturers recommend that no
more than 109 cells should be loaded per column; exceeding
this quantity may cause clogging of the column, leading to
poor RNA yields. However, approximately 85% of the cells in
a parasite culture are mature human red blood cells, which
lack a nucleus or other organelles and do not produce nucleic
acids. We therefore investigated what quantities of parasiteinfected red blood cell culture could be loaded onto a column
without compromising the RNA yield. Initial experiments
revealed that trophozoite-stage parasites contain considerably greater quantities of RNA and DNA than the less mature
ring-stage parasites. We determined that for ring-stage parasites, increases in the cell sample from 9 × 106 (6 × 107 includ-

Reverse transcription
cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of total RNA (DNA-free)
using SuperScript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). First-strand synthesis was primed with Oligo-dT
(Invitrogen) and the relative dNTP concentrations were
adjusted to reflect the AT-bias of P. falciparum DNA (40%
dATP, 40% dTTP, 10% dCTP, 10% dGTP). The disaccharide
trehalose was added to the reaction (0.6 M) to improve the
efficiency of reverse transcription. The action of trehalose is
twofold: it stabilizes, and even activates, the reverse transcriptase protein at unusually high temperatures, and regions
of secondary structure in the transcript (that otherwise cause
the premature dissociation of the enzyme) are reduced or
eliminated by both trehalose and the increased temperature
of the reaction [119]. Reaction conditions were as follows:
42°C for 30 min, 60°C for 1.5 h, then 70°C for 15 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase.

PCR
Changes in mRNA levels throughout the asexual blood stage
of the parasite of 34 proven/putative transport genes were
semi-quantified by two-step RT-PCR using the principles
developed by Halford and colleagues [120,121] and Fuster et
al. [122]. As described above, the amount of total RNA in the
cell increases significantly as the parasite matures (see Figure
3 for quantitative analysis). For this reason, for each time
point the quantity of cDNA added to the PCR was standardized to cell number rather than to total RNA (see Discussion).
PCR was performed using the Platinum Taq PCRx DNA
polymerase Kit (Invitrogen). Each reaction had a final volume
of 50 µl and consisted of: 1x PCRx amplification buffer, 1x
PCR enhancer solution, 1.5 mM MgSO4, dNTPs (320 µM
dATP, 320 µM dTTP, 80 µM dCTP and 80 µM dGTP), 1.25 U
Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase, 2 µM of each primer and 5 µl
of template cDNA (at an appropriate dilution). Samples were
amplified in a MJ Research PTC-200 Peltier thermal cycler
and 20 µl of each reaction was loaded onto a 1% (w/v) agarose

reports

The absence of contaminating DNA in the RNA samples was
verified by the lack of PCR products formed in reactions (30
cycles) carried out for each primer set using RNA as the template (that is, 'minus RT' controls).

product yields for a given gene are presented as a ratio of the
signal measured for the specified time point, divided by that
of the time point which gave the greatest yield of product.
Ratios from replicate gels from the same PCR were averaged
and the data from time course 1 and 2 (each consisting of at
least n = 2 polymerase chain reactions) were combined to give
the mean ± standard error. Each 50 µl PCR contained an
amount of cDNA equivalent to around 3.8 × 104 parasites and
product yields were measured from 2 × 20 µl aliquots of the
reaction. Thus in this study, the relative level of transcript at
each growth stage was estimated from around 1.5 × 104 parasitized cells.

reviews

Halford et al. [120] have shown that in a PCR where the concentration of template is limiting and the amplification of
primer-dimers is occurring, the yield of product is dependent
upon the logarithm of template cDNA input, even after 35
cycles of amplification. Furthermore, this relationship holds
from the lowest concentration of template that gives a detectable yield, to amounts that are at least 100-fold (and up to
1,000-fold) greater than this concentration. A preliminary
PCR revealed that the amount of product synthesized from
trophozoite-stage cDNA varied between the 34 genes - a
reflection, perhaps, of differences in transcript levels between
these genes, differences in primer efficiency, or differences in
the efficiency at which a given transcript species was reverse
transcribed into cDNA. A subset of six genes, representative
of this range in PCR product yield, was selected for inclusion
in an experiment aimed at establishing a set of conditions
under which, for each gene and cDNA sample, the final yield
of PCR product was proportional to the amount of starting
cDNA template. In brief, cDNA from ring (~20 h old), trophozoite (~32 h old) and schizont-stage (~42 h old) parasites was
serially diluted and PCR product yields were measured after
15, 20, 25 or 30 cycles of amplification. It was found that
using a moderately high dilution of cDNA (equivalent to
around 3.8 × 104 parasites per 50 µl PCR), and amplification
for 25 cycles, resulted in a proportional relationship between
the concentration of input cDNA and the yield of PCR product
for most genes and cDNA samples (data not shown). However, for a small subset of genes (PFA0245w, PFC0530w,
PFE0775c, PFE1455w, PFI0720w, PF11_0334, PFL0420w,
PF14_0622), these conditions did not result in quantities of
product that could be measured reliably by densitometry and
these genes required an additional five rounds of amplification before the yields could be measured reliably and the
results were reproducible. Polymerase chain reactions were
thermal cycled as follows: 94°C for 2 min, then 25 or 30 of
94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 68°C for 45 sec.
