Abstract
Background: Genotyping of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become an essential tool for prognosis and prediction of
treatment duration. The aim of this study was to compare two HCV genotyping methods: reverse hybridization line
probe assay (LiPA v.1) and partial sequencing of the NS5B region.
Methods: Plasma of 171 patients with chronic hepatitis C were screened using both a commercial method (LiPA
HCV Versant, Siemens, Tarrytown, NY, USA) and different primers targeting the NS5B region for PCR amplification
and sequencing analysis.
Results: Comparison of the HCV genotyping methods showed no difference in the classification at the genotype
level. However, a total of 82/171 samples (47.9%) including misclassification, non-subtypable, discrepant and
inconclusive results were not classified by LiPA at the subtype level but could be discriminated by NS5B
sequencing. Of these samples, 34 samples of genotype 1a and 6 samples of genotype 1b were classified at the
subtype level using sequencing of NS5B.
Conclusions: Sequence analysis of NS5B for genotyping HCV provides precise genotype and subtype identification
and an accurate epidemiological representation of circulating viral strains.
Keywords: HCV, genotyping, NS5B region, 5’UTR

Background
The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome sequence is highly
variable. Six major types and approximately 80 subtypes
have been recognized since it was first identified [1]. The
nucleotide level differs by 31% to 33% among genotypes
and by 20% to 25% among subtypes [2]. Genetic variation
throughout the genome is not uniform. The region
encoding envelope glycoproteins was the most variable
when compared to the highly conserved 5’ untranslated
region (5’UTR) [3]. Most of the commercially available
genotyping methods are based on the detection of the
conserved bases within the 5’UTR region. However, the

ability of the 5’UTR nucleotide sequence to discriminate
virus isolates at the subtype level is controversial, and
alternative regions have been proposed for genotyping
[4]. The widely accepted reference method for HCV genotyping is the NS5B region sequencing [5]. Therefore,
the aim of the present study was to compare a genotyping method based on partial sequencing of the NS5B
region to a commercial method based on the 5’ UTR
region (LiPA) using plasma samples obtained from Brazilian patients.

(LiPA) v.1 using the Versant™ HCV Genotype Assay
(Siemens, Tarrytown, NY, USA) after amplification of
244 bp of the 5’UTR fragment, which had been generated
using the Amplicor® Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Test, version 2.0 (Roche, Branchburg, NJ, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo (CAAE 2546.0.015.000-05).
RNA extraction

RNA extraction was performed using the NucliSENS
Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux, Boxtel, the
Netherlands). A total of 200 ml of plasma was added to
the lysis buffer and incubated for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Magnetic silica particles were used for
nucleic acid binding for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Silica particles were washed with different buffers, and
the NucliSENS miniMAG apparatus was used to collect
and wash the particles. The nucleic acids were released
from the silica particles using 60 ml of elution buffer and
by heating the samples to 60°C for five minutes.
RT-PCR

The synthesis of cDNA was performed essentially as previously described [6]. For reverse transcription, 40 ml of
RNA was added to the reaction mixture [3 ml of random
primers (7.5 ng/ml) and 36 ml of DEPC-H2O] and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes. Then, 24 ml of Reverse
Transcription mix [5X buffer, 0.1 M DTT, 10 mM dNTPs,
30 U/ml RNase Out, and 200 U/ml M-MLV RT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)] were added. Reverse transcription was performed using the GeneAmp PCR Systems
9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) using the following conditions: 25°C for 15 min, 37°C for 62 min, 95°C
for 15 min, and a final hold at 10°C.
Amplification of the HCV cDNA

All primers described in this study were designed based
on the NS5B region consensus sequences, which were
obtained upon alignment of the data provided by the Los
Alamos National Laboratory http://hcv.lanl.gov/content/
sequence/HCV/ToolsOutline.html.
Table 1 includes details for the primers (Invitrogen) that
were used in the PCR amplification of the NS5B region.
Each PCR reaction contained 10X buffer [200 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.4), 500 mM KCl], 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM
dNTPs, 1 μM of each primer, 2.5 UI of Platinum Taq
DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) and 5 μl of
the cDNA to be tested in a final volume of 50 μl that was
obtained using DEPC-treated H2O. PCR was performed in
the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems)
using the following amplification conditions: 5 min at
94°C; 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 60.5°C for 1 min for

Page 2 of 5

primer NS5B2F/NS5B2R, 56°C for 45 s for primer F56_13/R56_1-3, or 58°C for 45 s for primer GEN2FSN/
GEN2RSN, and 72°C for 1 min; 72°C for 10 min; and a
final hold at 10°C.
Nucleotide sequencing of NS5B region

PCR products were purified using the PureLink™ PCR
Purification Kit (Invitrogen), quantified using the Kodak
Digital Science Analysis System 120 (Rochester, NY,
USA) and diluted to 20 ng/μl. Sequencing reactions
were performed in both directions using the Big Dye
terminator version 3.2 (Applied Biosystems), and the
products were detected using the ABI 3130 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence analysis

Nucleotide sequences from HCV strains were edited
using Codon Code (Codon Code Corporation, Dedham,
MA, USA) and imported to BioEdit [7], which was used
to align the sequences to a reference panel of reported
sequences provided by the Los Alamos National Laboratoryhttp://hcv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HCV/ToolsOutline.html.
A total of 171 HCV NS5B sequences of different genotypes that were identified in this study were submitted to
GenBank and can be retrieved under the accession numbers EF136859 to EF136882 and FJ159697 to FJ159845.
Phylogenetic analysis

An internal fragment of 216 nucleotides within the PCR
products that were generated for sequencing (positions
1223-1438 in the NS5B region according to the reference
sequence H77, GenBank accession number NC004102)
was used for phylogenetic analysis with 138 of the 171
(80.7%) samples. Nucleotide distances were computed
with MEGA version 4.0 [8] using the r-distance algorithm.
Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the neighbor joining method. Robustness of the tree branches was tested
using bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates).

Results
HCV genome amplification

The primer pair NS5B2F/NS5B2R was efficient in amplifying most of genotypes 1 to 5. However, these primers
failed to amplify six samples of genotype 2. To amplify
these samples, we designed a specific primer pair
(GEN2FSN/GEN2RSN). Among these amplified samples,
five were classified as genotype 2 c and one as 2b.
Performance comparison of HCV genotyping using 5’UTR
(LiPA) and NS5B sequence analysis

Comparison of HCV genotyping was based on NS5B
sequence analysis and LiPA (5’UTR) and showed no difference in the classification of all 171 samples (Table 2).

However, discrepancies at the subtype level were found
for 47.9% (82/171) of the subtyping results between
LiPA and NS5B sequencing (Table 3). LiPA did not
assign subtypes for 40 samples of genotype 1, which
were classified as genotype 1a (34 samples) and genotype 1b (6 samples) by partial NS5B sequencing. Four
samples that were classified by LiPA as genotype 1b
were grouped as genotype 1a by NS5B sequencing.
Among 26 genotype 2 samples, LiPA classified five samples as genotype 2b. Forty-two genotype 3 samples were
correctly typed as 3a by LiPA, which was confirmed by
NS5B sequencing.
Inconclusive genotypes

LiPA classified 11 samples as genotype 1a/1b, which were
further subtyped as genotypes 1a (7/11) and 1b (4/11) by
NS5B sequencing. Two samples yielded LiPA patterns
that were categorized as genotype 2a/2c. However, NS5B
sequencing subtyped these samples as genotype 2 c
(Table 3).
Phylogenetic analysis

Discrepancies were not found when the results of partial
NS5B sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 138 samples were compared.

Discussion
Hepatitis C virus genotyping assays are usually based on
the sequence analysis of an amplified segment of the
genome, which is commonly the 5’ untranslated region.
Currently, 5’UTR based assays are reasonably accurate
with more than 95% concordance with genotypes that
have been identified by nucleotide sequencing of the
NS5B region or other coding regions of the HCV genome [9]. In our study, LiPA and NS5B sequencing
showed 100% agreement at the type level. These results
are similar to those reported by another study using the
5’UTR with a type agreement of 99.5% [10]. Another
study with 357 samples from French blood donors has
demonstrated 100% agreement between 5’UTR and
NS5B sequence analysis regarding type classification
[11]. However, depending on the geographical region,
genotype identification based on 5’UTR may be unreliable because some genotype 6 variants that have been
found in Southeast Asia have identical 5’UTR sequences
to those of genotypes 1a or 1b [12]. In Brazil, the most
prevalent HCV genotypes are 1, 2 and 3, whereas genotypes 4 and 5 are rarely identified and genotype 6 has
not been previously described [13].
When we compared the subtyping results of LiPA and
partial NS5B sequencing, we found 47.9% (82/171) of
misclassification among samples, including non-subtypable discrepant and inconclusive results. LiPA could not
discriminate 39.6% (40/101) of the genotype 1 samples at
the subtype level. LiPA misclassified three samples of
genotype 1b as genotype 1a and four samples of genotype
1a as genotype 1b. LiPA did not accurately discriminate
between genotypes 1a and 1b, which may be attributed to
the lack of discriminating power of LiPA probes 5 and 6.
The difference between these probes covers a single
nucleotide change in the HCV genome, which is an A to
G transition at position -99 within the 5’UTR. There is
evidence that this transition represents a sequence polymorphism that cannot be used to differentiate between
subtypes 1a and 1b [14]. Accordingly, we found that
LiPA yielded inconclusive results for 11 genotype 1 samples, which were classified as genotype 1a/1b.
Concerning genotype 2, 26 samples were investigated
in our study. The small sample size is due to the low

prevalence of this genotype in Southern Brazil (less than
4%). In our study, only five of the 26 genotype 2 samples were simultaneously subtyped as 2b by LiPA and
NS5B sequence analysis. The 21 remaining genotype 2
samples were not accurately subtyped by LiPA. After
performing the sequence analysis of the NS5B region,
11 of these 21 samples were classified as genotype 2b,
nine samples as genotype 2 c and one sample as genotype 2a. This poor resolution was expected because
LiPA targets 5’UTR, which may result in incorrect identification of subtypes 2a and 2 c due to the lack of
nucleotide polymorphisms [15]. Similarly, a previous
study has reported that 61% of the subtypes of genotype
2 were misclassified by 5’UTR-based genotyping in
France [11]. Another study has compared genotyping
using real-time PCR targeting the NS5B region and
LiPA v.1.0 and has shown that LiPA did not subtype 68
of the 295 samples (23%) [16].
The low reported prevalence of mixed HCV genotype
infection suggests that this type of infection is a rare
event and is influenced by the population that is studied
and the genotyping method that is employed [17]. A
study with 600 patients has shown that 2.2% of patients
displayed evidence of mixed infections. These sera have
been screened using sequencing and serological assays in
parallel [18]. Accordingly, only two laboratories have correctly identified one of the three samples containing
mixed HCV genotypes in a national evaluation study that
was conducted in France [19]. Cases of mixed HCV genotypes have not been confirmed in our study. Although
all of the samples were characterized as infected based on
a single genotype, direct sequencing is not the gold standard method to detect mixed infection. The best
approach to reliably detect mixed-genotype infections is
PCR amplification followed by cloning of the PCR products or the use of next-generation sequencing methods.

Unfortunately, this approach is unfeasible in a routine
clinical setting [20]. The results that are reported herein
are similar to those found in another study that has been
conducted in Brazil using sequencing to genotype 1,688
samples from chronic HCV patients, who did not show
evidence of mixed infection [21].
In our study, the 5’UTR-based genotyping method
(LiPA) showed higher efficiency than the NS5B region
to generate PCR amplification products. Primers targeting the 5’UTR, which is a highly conserved region, produce fewer false negative results in PCR reactions for
HCV detection. The major factor to be considered when
evaluating the generation of false negative PCR results is
the existence of different strains or subtypes of HCV
[22]. Because the polymorphic positions are not homogenously distributed within the NS5B region, difficulty
to generate amplicons may be due to inadequate primer
design, choice of highly polymorphic annealing
sequences or low viral load [19].
Currently, there is a new available commercial version of
LiPA (v.2), which contains probes targeting both the
5’UTR and the core regions of the HCV genome, which
improves the accuracy of subtyping, particularly regarding
the discrimination between subtypes 1a and 1b. By the
time this study was conducted, this version was not available for use in Brazil.
In the future, a protective vaccine and the availability of
HCV-specific antiviral drugs that are based on proteases or
polymerase inhibitors will probably require genotyping at
the subtype level. This genotyping approach will improve
our understanding of the genetic diversity of HCV. Genotyping methods that are based on the 5’UTR are important
tools for routine clinical purposes because they are sufficiently precise at the genotype level. Our results show that
HCV genotyping using partial NS5B sequence analysis is
an efficient method that allows accurate discrimination of

subtypes and might be an effective tool to study the molecular epidemiology of HCV.
