Abstract
Background: The genus Cuscuta L. (Convolvulaceae), commonly known as dodders, are epiphytic
vines that invade the stems of their host with haustorial feeding structures at the points of contact.
Although they lack expanded leaves, some species are noticeably chlorophyllous, especially as
seedlings and in maturing fruits. Some species are reported as crop pests of worldwide distribution,
whereas others are extremely rare and have local distributions and apparent niche specificity. A
strong phylogenetic framework for this large genus is essential to understand the interesting
ecological, morphological and molecular phenomena that occur within these parasites in an
evolutionary context.
Results: Here we present a well-supported phylogeny of Cuscuta using sequences of the nuclear
ribosomal internal transcribed spacer and plastid rps2, rbcL and matK from representatives across
most of the taxonomic diversity of the genus. We use the phylogeny to interpret morphological
and plastid genome evolution within the genus. At least three currently recognized taxonomic
sections are not monophyletic and subgenus Cuscuta is unequivocally paraphyletic. Plastid genes are
extremely variable with regards to evolutionary constraint, with rbcL exhibiting even higher levels
of purifying selection in Cuscuta than photosynthetic relatives. Nuclear genome size is highly
variable within Cuscuta, particularly within subgenus Grammica, and in some cases may indicate the
existence of cryptic species in this large clade of morphologically similar species.
Conclusion: Some morphological characters traditionally used to define major taxonomic splits
within Cuscuta are homoplastic and are of limited use in defining true evolutionary groups.
Chloroplast genome evolution seems to have evolved in a punctuated fashion, with episodes of loss
involving suites of genes or tRNAs followed by stabilization of gene content in major clades. Nearly
all species of Cuscuta retain some photosynthetic ability, most likely for nutrient apportionment to
their seeds, while complete loss of photosynthesis and possible loss of the entire chloroplast
genome is limited to a single small clade of outcrossing species found primarily in western South
America.

Background
Between 150 and 200 species of Cuscuta have been
described, and they are distributed widely on every continent except Antarctica [1]. These parasites have no roots at
maturity and their leaves are reduced to minute scales. As
such, few morphological characters exist to distinguish
and classify species outside of the flower and fruit. Style
and stigma morphology, capsule dehiscence and corolla
and calyx shape and size form the basis of existing monographical studies [1-3]. Engelmann [2] separated Cuscuta
into three subgenera on the basis of style fusion and
stigma shape. Members of subgenus Monogyna have the
two styles fused for most or all of their length, and consist
of thick-stemmed species that commonly parasitize trees
and shrubs; subgenera Cuscuta and Grammica have free
styles, with stigmas being globose in subgenus Grammica
and elongate in subgenus Cuscuta (Figure 1). The last full
monograph of the genus completed by Yuncker [1] recognized nine species in Monogyna, distributed primarily in
Eurasia and Africa with one species, Cuscuta exaltata Engelmann, having a disjunctive distribution in the southern
United States in the scrub habitat of Florida and Texas.
The 28 species in subgenus Cuscuta recognized by Yuncker
have native ranges restricted to, but widely distributed in,
the Old World. Subgenus Grammica, with 121 species recognized by Yuncker, is almost completely limited to the
New World, with a handful of exceptions in Asia, Africa
and the Pacific islands, including Tasmania and Australia.
Engelmann [2] further divided each of the subgenera into
sections based on stigma morphology and capsule dehiscence. Monogyna consists of two sections; the first, Callianche, contains only Cuscuta reflexa Roxburgh, defined by
its elongated stigmas atop the fused styles. All other members of subgenus Monogyna are relegated to section Monogynella, which have shorter, stouter stigmas. All members
of subgenus Monogyna possess a circumscissile capsule as
the fruit. Subgenus Cuscuta is subdivided into four sections. Section Cleistococca has only one species, Cuscuta
capitata Roxburgh, which is distinguished from all other
members of subgenus Cuscuta by having an indehiscent
capsule as its fruit. Fruits of sections Pachystigma and
Epistigma are only irregularly circumscissile, and fruits of
section Eucuscuta are always cleanly dehiscent. Section
Pachystigma is distinguished from section Epistigma by
the presence of long, slender styles topped by wider stigmas, whereas members of section Epistigma possess only
short to undetectable styles topped by the elongated stigmas. The six species of Pachystigma are restricted to
Southern Africa, while the four species of Epistigma and
Cuscuta capitata are restricted to central Asia. Section
Eucuscuta has a wider distribution, with the largest
number of species found close to the Mediterranean Sea.
Subgenus Grammica is divided into two sections based on
capsule dehiscence, with section Eugrammica possessing

complete to partially dehiscent capsules and section Cleistogrammica producing indehiscent capsules. Species of
subgenus Grammica are relatively evenly divided between
the two subgenera, with 53 species in section Cleistogrammica and 68 species in Eugrammica [1].
Cuscuta is a readily recognizable genus, with the only species in the completely unrelated but strikingly similar parasitic vine genus Cassytha L. (Lauraceae) ever likely to
cause any confusion [4] ; however, small flowers and a
paucity of usable morphological characteristics often
make the identification of Cuscuta to the species level a
challenge. Although no comprehensive taxonomic study

of the entire genus has been completed since Yuncker's
monograph, Cuscuta remains one of the most widely studied parasitic plant lineages, with numerous publications
on its anatomy [5-7], nutritional physiology [8] , plastid
evolution [9-21] and even foraging behavior [22-25]. Phylogenies of Convolvulaceae with a small sampling of Cuscuta species showed it is confidently nested within that
family [26]. Although its exact placement could not be
strongly inferred with more in-depth analysis [27] , the
most confident placement was sister to a the 'Convolvuloideae' clade [28]. Taxa from subgenus Monogyna
appeared basal to subgenus Cuscuta and subgenus Grammica in those studies. Another study showed multiple
members of subgenus Cuscuta to be nested within multiple clades of subgenus Grammica [21] , although those
data are likely a result of misidentification of taxa and are
discussed more extensively in our results.
Conflicting evidence exists as to the photosynthetic ability
across the genus. Machado and Zetsche [9] demonstrated
low levels of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in the
noticeably chlorophyllous stems of Cuscuta reflexa (subgenus Monogyna) despite apparent loss of all ndh genes [12]
, but found no detectable levels of RuBisCo expression in
C. europaea, despite the presence of the gene encoding its
large subunit (rbcL) in the plastid genome. Studies further
showed that C. reflexa only produces chlorophyll in a specific layer of cells isolated from atmospheric gas exchange,
suggesting it only photosynthesizes by recycling carbon
dioxide released from respiratory byproducts of carbohydrates from its host source [5]. C. pentagona Engelmann of
subgenus Grammica was shown to possess a normal photosynthetic ratio of chlorophyll a to b, contain properly
localized photosynthetic proteins and display low levels
of carbon assimilation [29]. However, other members of
subgenus Grammica seem to possess highly altered plastid
genomes; C. gronovii Willdenow and C. subinclusa Durand
et Hilgard seemingly lack plastid-encoded polymerase
(rpo) genes [18] , although low levels of transcription of
rbcL still take place from nuclear-encoded polymerase
promoter sites [19] , and these species, along with C.
campestris Yuncker and C. reflexa still possess normal chlorophyll a and b ratios [16]. In contrast, C. odorata Ruiz et
Pavon and C. grandiflora Humbolt, Bonpland et Kunth are
achlorophyllous, lack thylakoids and do not produce
detectable levels of rbcL transcript or protein [16]. The
additional loss of some non-coding data from the plastid
genome along with a few minor changes to intact reading
frames within Cuscuta and Convolvulaceae have been
reported and roughly mapped on a phylogeny of Cuscuta
based on a minimal sampling of taxa [20].
In this study, we examine the phylogeny of the genus Cuscuta by sampling 35 species from all sections of the genus
defined by Englemann [2] with the exceptions of section

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/55

Epistigma and the monospecific section Cleistococca. Our
sampling also includes species from 19 of 29 subsectional
groups recognized by Yuncker [1]. We obtain DNA
sequences for phylogenetic analysis from two plastid loci
(rbcL and rps2) and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer
(ITS) region between the 18S and 5.8S ribosomal RNA
loci from largely overlapping subsets of taxa to investigate
phylogenetic relationships within the genus and test the
monophyly of the previously defined subgeneric and subsectional delimitations. We determine genome sizes for
species available as fresh tissue in order to address questions of species delimitation and to test whether genome
size correlates with published chromosome numbers,
which are highly variable [30]. In addition to the plastid
loci mentioned above, which correspond to the RuBisCo
large subunit and a small ribosomal protein subunit
respectively, we sample two more plastid loci representing
two other functionally distinct genes (atpE, ATP synthase
subunit; rpoA, plastid-encoded polymerase subunit) from
smaller subsets of taxa in order to test whether all classes
of plastid genes are evolving equally in Cuscuta relative to
photosynthetic taxa. Using further polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, we test the distribution of major
changes to the plastid genome within the genus and combine them with previously published evidence to gain a
comprehensive view of photosynthetic evolution within
Cuscuta. Finally, we use evidence from the biology and
natural history of these parasites to suggest potential
hypotheses as to why photosynthesis is retained in most
members of the genus despite what superficially appears
to be minimal opportunity for gain of photosynthetic carbohydrate.

Results
Phylogeny
Figure 2 shows individual parsimony bootstrap consensus
cladograms for ITS, rps2 and rbcL and the four-gene combined dataset including matK data. Maximum parsimony
bootstrap values (MP) are shown above the nodes and
Bayesian posterior probability estimates (PP) are shown
below the nodes. The individual gene trees are almost
identical in topology, with no well-supported incongruences. Many of the support values are high for individual
genes and almost every node is very well supported in the
combined analysis. Furthermore, maximum-likelihood
analyses were performed on the individual gene datasets;
these analyses also gave nearly congruent topologies that
agreed at well-supported in-group nodes (Figure 3). Cuscuta was found to be sister to the 'Convolvuloideae' clade
[28] for two of the genes (matK and ITS), and this placement was very well supported in the combined analysis
(MP 92, PP 1.0). Within Cuscuta, subgenus Monogyna was
monophyletic and sister to all other Cuscuta species (MP
100, PP 1.0), with C. exaltata sister to all other sampled
Monogyna species. Section Monogynella was paraphyletic,

strongly supported as paraphyletic (MP 98, PP 1.0), with
Cuscuta nitida Meyer representing section Pachystigma
falling sister to subgenus Grammica, a result also sup-

ported by loss of two transfer RNA genes and loss of
introns from ycf3 and atpF (see Figure 4). The two sampled
species in section Eucuscuta were monophyletic (MP 100,

reject the monophyly of sections Eugrammica and Cleistogrammica. The basal lineage of subgenus Grammica was
not clearly resolved, with the consensus showing a clade
including subsection Odoratae (C. chilensis Ker-Gawler)
with subsection Acutilobae (C. foetida Humboldt, Bonpland et Kunth) and a clade with subsections Indecorae,
Umbellatae and Leptanthae in a polytomy together with a
clade containing the remainder of the sampled subsections of subgenus Grammica. Subsection Californicae and
subsection Tinctoriae were not monophyletic in the combined four-gene tree, but the monophyly of all other subsections cannot be disputed by these data. Our data are
congruent at well-supported nodes with a study that sampled many additional species of subgenus Grammica utilizing two short loci (including ITS) [31].

our results. Low numbers of plastid clones relative to
nuclear clones in a genomic fosmid library used to generate the full plastid genome sequence of Cuscuta exaltata
help confirm these data [32]. Within subgenus Cuscuta
section Eucuscuta, genome sizes of Cuscuta europaea L. and
C. epilinum Weihe actually did appear to correlate with
karyotypes and known ploidy levels [30] , with the apparent recent triploid C. epilinum having a genome size consistent with these data relative to C. europaea. Estimated
nuclear genome sizes within subgenus Grammica are the
most variable, with an estimate for Cuscuta pentagona
(1.16 picograms/2C) being the smallest of all sampled
species and C. indecora Choisy (65.54 pg/2C) being the
largest. There does not appear to be a standard genome
size within this subgenus, although closely related species
in subsection Oxycarpae, subsection Cephalanthae and
subsection Lepidanche all possess proportional nuclear
genome size, with three size classes perhaps reflecting different ploidy levels. Interestingly, accessions of C. gronovii
from different geographic localities showed quite striking
differences in genome size, even within two collections
made within the state of Pennsylvania. Smaller, secondary
peaks were detected in many species, suggesting that these

Nuclear genome size results
Genome size estimates were highly variable within Cuscuta and did not appear to be related to previously published chromosome numbers overall (Table 1). Species in
subgenus Monogyna, which generally show intermediate
chromosome numbers between the other two subgenera

Standard deviations for all genome size estimates are based on four measurements.

stem tips were growing so rapidly as to have many cells at
different stages of mitosis with different overall DNA content depending on phase. Alternatively, the parasites
could be undergoing endoreduplication, a process frequent in metabolically active cells of eukaryotes by which
the genome of those cells is doubled within the nucleus
[33].
Plastid genome variation assays
Major changes to the plastid genome reported in this and
previous studies are mapped on the cladogram in Figure
4. PCR and sequencing of the region between petD and
rps11 showed that taxa across subgenus Grammica contained only residual rpoA pseudogene sequence, although
the length of the remaining intergenic region was surprisingly constant across those taxa (data not shown). This
confirmed previous hybridization data that failed to
detect rpo (plastid-encoded RNA polymerase) genes
[18,20] and showed loss of transcription from known
plastid-encoded polymerase promoter sites [18]. PCR
data also detected an inversion in the large single-copy
region of C. reflexa [11] and C. japonica [20] that is a
synapomorphy in all sampled species of subgenus Monogyna, as is a constriction of the large single-copy boundary
of the inverted repeat region into ycf2. A two-kilobase
inversion in the large single-copy region of the plastid
genome was found in both sampled members of subgenus Cuscuta subsection Eucuscuta. Long PCR covering
many intergenic regions demonstrated that the substantial reduction of non-coding DNA is shared across subgenus Grammica, with all species in the subgenus seemingly
converging on a minimal length (Figure 5). Sequences
from Cuscuta lupuliformis, in subgenus Monogyna, show
much less reduction in intergenic regions. Members of
subgenus Cuscuta, which still possess a full set of seemingly functional rpo genes, show intermediate levels of
intergenic sequence loss; this indicates that intergenic
constriction does not completely result from a loss of plastid-encoded polymerase promoter regions.

Finally, we attempted to study plastid genes in C. chilensis.
C. chilensis is an achlorophyllous relative of C. odorata, a
species which appears to lack rbcL [16]. Unlike the results
from C. odorata, we were unable to amplify rrn16 from C.
chilensis using many combinations of primers. Furthermore, hybridization of various ribosomal protein gene
and rrn16 PCR products from other species within Cuscuta
subgenus Grammica to a filter containing over 1,500 Cuscuta chilensis clones from a genomic fosmid library
returned no positive hits. Positive control amplifications
of Cuscuta chilensis mitochondrial genes and hybridization of mitochondrial probes to the Cuscuta chilensis
library showed that organellar DNA was present in our
DNA extraction and library.

Tests of selective constraint
With such variability in gene content across Cuscuta, it was
important to determine whether remaining genes are still
under selective constraint and how these patterns of constraint vary across genes, across the taxonomic range of
Cuscuta and between Cuscuta and its photosynthetic relatives. Unconstrained maximum-likelihood trees are
shown in Figure 6. Trees with all branches constrained to
the same non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio were
significantly worse than fully unconstrained trees for atpE,
rbcL and rps2 (Table 2), indicating lineage-specific heterogeneity in selective constraint for these genes. No significant difference was observed between the likelihoods of
rpoA trees when trees with all branches constrained to an
identical non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio were
compared with unconstrained trees. Of the four hypotheses tested for atpE (significant constraint differences
between outgroups and all Convolvulaceae including Cuscuta, differences between Cuscuta and non-parasites, differences between subgenera Cuscuta+Grammica and all
other taxa, and differences between subgenus Grammica
and all other taxa), constraining an independent non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio for all Cuscuta from
the rest of the tree most improved the likelihood scores,

with the resulting likelihood no longer being significantly
different from the fully unconstrained tree. For rbcL, all of
the clades tested in the same manner remained significantly worse than the unconstrained tree, with the greatest
improvement coming when subgenera Cuscuta and Grammica together were given a separate non-synonymous to
synonymous rate ratio. In this case, as is apparent in the
unconstrained tree, the non-synonymous to synonymous
rate ratio actually decreases within Cuscuta, with all species under higher levels of purifying selection than the
autotrophic outgroups. For rps2, yet a third pattern was
observed. Of the hypotheses tested, a change in non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio across Convolvulaceae improves the likelihood the most, again to the
extent that it is no longer significantly different to the
unconstrained tree, suggesting that a relaxation of constraint may have occurred in this gene before the evolution of parasitism. A similar result was found in the
independently derived parasitic plant family Orobanchaceae, where significant rate increases in rps2 are seen
even in very photosynthetic lineages before evolution of
holoparasitism [34]. For rpoA, there was no significant difference between the fully constrained and fully unconstrained trees, and no appreciable changes occurred under
any of the proposed hypothetical shifts in non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio.

Discussion
Morphological, biogeographical and taxonomic
interpretation of phylogeny
Although subgenus Grammica is clearly monophyletic in
our study, it has been suggested that it is paraphyletic,
with members of subgenus Cuscuta nested in multiple
clades within Grammica [21]. That study also included
data from plastid rbcL and nuclear ITS, allowing us to
compare sequences for taxa shared with our study. As their
phylogenies show strong conflict with ours and make no
sense from a morphological standpoint, and because data
reportedly gathered from the same species as vouchered
specimens from our study clearly represent unrelated taxa,
we conclude that multiple taxa were misidentified in [21].
This likely also affected their conclusion that loss of photosynthetic genes is distributed randomly on the phylogeny, when a clear stepwise and more parsimonious loss of
photosynthetic genes is evident from our results. Cuscuta
species can be difficult to identify when in flower (see Figure 7) and nearly impossible to identify from vegetative
material, which was the source of tissue used for DNA isolations [12].

Yuncker believed that the morphological features of subgenus Grammica were the ancestral states owing to the species-richness of that subgenus; subgenus Grammica is
clearly in a highly derived position within the genus and
cannot be considered a potentially ancestral group. How-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/55

ever, once the tree is re-rooted to the proper node (Figure
8), subsectional relationships within sections largely agree
with interpretation of phylogenetic relationships proposed by Yuncker. Artificial relationships found to be
non-monophyletic mostly result from interpretation of
two morphological characters: stigma morphology and
capsule dehiscence. Elongated stigmas appear to be a
derived state in C. reflexa, which is nested within a clade
of species with much stouter stigmas. In contrast, the globose stigmas seen in subgenus Grammica are apparently
derived from elongate stigmas, such as those seen in subgenus Cuscuta. Stigma morphology appears to be quite
plastic within the genus and a full range of intermediates
between subgenus Cuscuta and subgenus Grammica exist.
Thus, it is not surprising that section Pachystigma (represented by C. nitida in our dataset), with intermediate
stigma morphology, is actually sister to subgenus Grammica and should be included in that subgenus. In fact, a
species within section Pachystigma, Cuscuta cucullata
Yuncker, is so similar to the only member of subgenus
Grammica found in South Africa, C. appendiculata Engelmann, that Yuncker points out that they may be confused
with each other. Although we were unable to sample
those two species for our phylogeny, their distribution in
South Africa has biogeographical implications for the colonization of the New World by subgenus Grammica from
a South African/South American dispersal event. Putatively basal clades of subgenus Grammica are either distributed almost completely in South America (subsection
Acutilobae and subsection Odoratae) or contain lineages
distributed widely from South to North America (subsection Indecorae and subsection Umbellatae). Interestingly,
C. cucullata and C. appendiculata are unique among South
African Cuscuta species in having indehiscent capsules,
which facilitate floating and water-mediated dispersal of
the seeds in many members of subgenus Grammica section Cleistogrammica. Subgenus Grammica has successfully spread across both North and South America since
colonizing the New World and now contains many more
species than the other two subgenera combined. Whether
the ancestor of C. exaltata (subgenus Monogyna) may have
taken a similar route to colonize the New World is
unknown, although it too shares a morphologically similar relative in South Africa (C. cassytoides Nees von Esenbeck).
While capsule dehiscence was one of the main characters
used for monographical work in Cuscuta [1,2] , our phylogenetic analyses agree with another study [31] that it is a
transient character in the genus with very little systematic
value and that the sectional entities of Eugrammica and
Cleistogrammica should no longer be recognized. Many
species of Cuscuta subgenus Grammica possess irregularly
dehiscent capsules that are not easily classified as either
indehiscent or circumscissile. Two interesting cases of

indehiscent-capsuled species being allied to clades with
circumscissile capsules are C. tasmanica Engelmann and C.
sandwichiana Choisy. These derived members of subgenus
Grammica have independently colonized islands far from
the home of their Mexican sister taxa and both are found
in coastal habitats. Indehiscent capsules may have also
aided their aquatic dispersal events. Other taxa from subgenus Grammica found in the Pacific Rim (e.g. C. australis
R. Brown) likely took a similar dispersal route via indehiscent capsules [31] , although we do not have data for
those taxa in our phylogeny. Two other Old World species
from subgenus Grammica, Cuscuta chinensis in Asia and
Cuscuta kilamanjari in Africa, have dehiscent capsules, and
may or may not have dispersed to their present ranges via
ancestral indehiscent capsules.
Genome sizes and speciation
Estimates of species number within Cuscuta vary greatly,
largely because so few characters exist to distinguish them.
The existence of forms with supernumary chromosomes
[35] and such widely scattered estimates of chromosome
numbers in the genus [30] suggest polyploid and aneuploid evolution may occur rather rapidly in this lineage.
Species that appear very similar morphologically may
occupy very dissimilar ecological niches and exhibit different host preferences. One such example involves C.
pentagona, C. campestris, C. polygonorum Engelmann and

other relatives in subsection Arveses and subsection Platycarpae. C. campestris is often merged taxonomically with
C. pentagona, as the two are distinguished primarily by
slight differences in overall flower size and angularity of
the calyx. However, our estimates of genome size between
accessions identified as either form differed in size by
almost a factor of 10 (Table 1). Estimates for C. polygonorum and C. pentagona differ by almost 50%, although
those species have also been merged in at least one taxonomic treatment [36]. C. polygonorum can be identified by
flowers that are often four-merous and that have a slightly
different gynoecium shape than those in C. pentagona.
However, the species can usually be distinguished simply
by noticeable habitat and host preferences. In such cases,
where forms seem to be ecologically distinct as well as
morphologically distinguishable, we suggest species-level
distinction is likely warranted given the disparate genome
sizes. Seemingly different ploidy levels exist within Cuscuta gronovii. Morphological variation in corolla size and
shape exist in this species as well (Figure 7), indicating
that cryptic species with different chromosome numbers
that are incapable of interbreeding may exist. Accelerated
rates of nucleotide substitution in the nuclear genome
may also promote rapid speciation in subgenus Grammica
if acceleration in ribosomal loci such as ITS (Figure 3) and
18S [37] are correlated with protein-coding rates. As
almost all species of Cuscuta readily produce selfed seed

they belong.

even in the absence of pollinators, and pollen is often
deposited on the stigma before the corolla opens, drastic
changes in the nuclear genome that prevent outcrossing
may promote speciation.
Plastid genome evolution in Cuscuta
In contrast to previous descriptions of chloroplast
genome evolution in Cuscuta as a 'slippery slope' [20] or
as occurring in a random, uncoordinated manner across
the phylogeny [21] , we find that plastid genome evolution in Cuscuta has occurred in a stepwise fashion, with
punctuated modification at various evolutionary timepoints followed by long periods of stasis within various
clades. Major changes occurred in the ancestor of the
genus, the ancestor of subgenus Grammica and within one
fully non-photosynthetic clade of subgenus Grammica.
Across most species of subgenus Grammica and, as such,
the majority of all Cuscuta species, plastid genome content
appears to have stabilized on a smaller, but constrained
size (see, e.g., Figure 5). Different types of genes appear to
be evolving under different levels of constraint. Most surprisingly, rbcL appears to be under much greater purifying
selection in Cuscuta than in autotrophic relatives. This
effect may largely be a result of much higher overall rates
of substitution in Cuscuta for the plastid genome (see
branch lengths in Figures 3 and 6), but a need for amino
acid stasis in rbcL. This intense conservation of most photosynthetic genes is quite unexpected for a genus that lacks
leaves and extensive chlorophyllous surface area. Hibberd
et al. [5] suggest that recycling of internally respired carbon dioxide may be the answer. However, loss of ndh
genes could possibly make these parasites extremely susceptible to photorespiration unless extremely high respiratory rates existed near these photosynthetic cells or
some other mechanism similar to C4 photosynthesis
existed [38]. Furthermore, these plants have seemingly little need to produce carbohydrates, which are readily
obtained from the host.

A second pathway involving rbcL in lipid biosynthesis in
green seeds of Brassica [39] suggests a tantalizing explanation for retention of photosynthetic genes in Cuscuta.
Chlorophyll is concentrated in the developing ovules of
Cuscuta (Figure 1), almost exclusively so in healthy members of subgenera Grammica and Cuscuta. Seeds often have
high lipid content as energy reserves for the seedling and
to aid in desiccation tolerance and seed longevity, and
Cuscuta has been shown to accumulate lipid bodies that
fill the majority of the non-nuclear cytoplasm [7]. Most
Cuscuta species are annuals and must be prolific producers
of highly energetic seeds to ensure at least some offspring
will be able to germinate and survive long enough to
search out and attach to a host. The seeds are impermeable to water until the epidermal layer is scarified and they
can live unimbibed for decades and remain viable. As lip-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/55

ids are less available from vascular extracts from the host
and because of the intense demand for lipid production
during fruiting, this efficient lipid synthesis pathway is a
more plausible explanation for conservation of a photosynthetic apparatus in Cuscuta than residual carbohydrate
production. Photosynthetic genes may have additional
functions in subgenus Monogyna, where chlorophyllous
cells are also concentrated in a thin layer of internal stem
tissue [5].
Loss of photosynthesis in Cuscuta
If photosynthesis is important for seed lipid production in
most Cuscuta, then questions remain as to why a few species can survive without chlorophyll and rbcL [16] (C.
chilensis; Figure 1). Reproductive biology of the lineages of
Cuscuta that contain these species, subsections Odoratae
and Grandiflorae (and possibly Acutilobae), may provide
an important clue. Large corolla size (see Cuscuta chilensis;
Figure 7) and strong fragrance characterize members of
these subsections. In our experience with cultivating C.
chilensis, it is incapable of producing selfed seed (from
over 100 hand-pollinations), whereas most Cuscuta species readily produce massive quantities of selfed seed
without assistance. Observations of various natural populations in Chile showed that pollinator visitation was frequent, with species of Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and
Diptera all moving between flowers with varying amounts
of Cuscuta pollen on their bodies. However, seed set in
these natural populations was extremely low, with only a
small proportion of old flowers containing viable seed.
Likewise, seeds are usually sparse or absent on herbarium
specimens of species in sections Odoratae and Grandiflorae. An ability to survive on hosts year-round may explain
why these species have less demand for a massive seed set
and, thus, are able to survive the cost of low fecundity to
reap the benefits of self-incompatibility. A decreased
demand for massive lipid production during fruiting may
have rendered the remaining photosynthetic genes in the
ancestor of these Cuscuta species obsolete. Our results and
observations suggest in-depth molecular and reproductive
physiological study of the large-flowered South American
clades of Cuscuta subgenus Grammica will provide further
insight into the evolutionary loss of photosynthesis in this
parasitic lineage.

Conclusion
By generating a well-supported phylogeny of the economically important parasitic plant genus Cuscuta, we have
provided a framework through which to test whether traditional taxonomic divisions of the genus represent
monophyletic evolutionary clades, to evaluate which
morphological characters are systematically misleading,
to formulate biogeographical hypotheses that best explain
current distributions of major clades and to interpret
molecular phenomenon such as nuclear genome size evo-

lution and plastid genome evolution. Subgenus Cuscuta is
paraphyletic with subgenus Grammica nested within it.
Subgenus Grammica likely colonized the new world
through a dispersal event from South Africa to South
America and then radiated throughout both North and
South America; subsequent long-distance dispersal
events, many possibly aided by transition to floating indehiscent capsules, best explain the few scattered members
of subgenus Grammica in Hawaii, Australia, Asia and
Africa. Nuclear genome size is highly variable in the genus
and may be useful in recognizing new cryptic species. A
reduction in plastid genome size appears to have occurred
in punctuated steps followed by periods of relative stasis.
Although plastid nucleotide substitution rates are quite
rapid, photosynthetic genes are very strongly conserved in
the majority of Cuscuta species even after the loss of all
plastid ndh and RNA polymerase genes. The plastid
genome is likely retained primarily for lipid biosynthesis
during seed production and is possibly lost completely in
a single clade of outcrossing species whose life histories
seem to accommodate a reduction in overall seed production.

Methods
Plant material
The quality of available tissue for different Cuscuta species
was variable, but a common method using a typical plant
CTAB DNA isolation [40] with 1% polyethylene glycol
(molecular weight 8,000) added to the buffer proved
effective for live plants grown in the Pennsylvania State
University Biology greenhouse, freshly collected wild
plants, frozen tissue, silica-gel dried tissue and small samples from herbarium specimens. For some dried material
received in silica gel, vouchers were unavailable and we
instead identified the species by dissection of rehydrated
flowers from the sample. Photographs taken through a
dissecting scope of characters necessary for identification
are available as vouchers for such species. For two species
for which we received no voucher material or flowering
and fruiting material for dissection, we verified proper
identification of the sample with sequence comparison of
vouchered data at loci always variable above the species
level. Vouchered specimens were deposited in the Pennsylvania State University Herbarium (PAC). Vouchers,
taxon information and GenBank accession numbers for
all sequences are presented in Table 3.
PCR and sequencing
Previously designed primers ITS4 and ITS5 were used for
amplification and sequencing of the nuclear ITS locus
according to a published protocol [41]. A few taxa exhibited sequence polymorphisms, particularly in a highly variable loop region [42] , which was not confidently
alignable across all taxa and was excluded for analyses.
This also often resulted in length polymorphisms that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/55

required Topo cloning (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for capillary sequencing. For all taxa with polymorphic ITS loci,
we found no evidence of lineage sorting, as all alleles from
a given species always formed a clear clade. We used consensus sequences from multiple clone reads to sort true
nucleotide polymorphisms from Taq polymerase error in
incorporated PCR fragments. True nucleotide polymorphisms were rare and were entered into the data matrix as
the predominant locus in our sample. Only one sequence
from each species with identified length polymorphisms
was used. Plastid rps2 was amplified with primers rps2661R and either rps2-18F or rps2-47F [34] or, for recalcitrant taxa, new primers designed from the more readily
generated Cuscuta sequences and the available plastid
genome sequences of C. exaltata and C. obtusiflora (data
analysis in prep). A partial rbcL product was also amplified using published primer sequences [43] or new primers designed specifically for Cuscuta. For some taxa
sampled from herbarium material, internal primer combinations were used to amplify and sequence the gene in
parts when necessary. Amplification across atpE was performed using primers atpB-1277F [44] and trnF-F [45]; for
members of section Eucuscuta, trnT(2)-R [46] was substituted for trnF-F on the basis of an inversion of those taxa
verified by this PCR and a PCR from trnF-F to rps4-32F
[47]. rpoA or rpoA pseudogenes were amplified and
sequenced with a combination of the newly designed
primers petD-endF and rps11-C398F. PCR protocol for
rps2, rbcL, atpE, and rpoA all followed the rps2 protocol
described by dePamphilis et al. [34]. Long PCR assays of
intergenic sequences were conducted using the following
primer combinations: psbD-40F [48] to trnfM-R [46];
trnC-F [46] to psbD-45R [48]; and rps4-32F to atpBs1277F. PCR from psbA-984F to ndhB-13F [48] was used
to confirm contraction of the inverted repeat in members
of subgenus Monogyna. These longer PCR assays were performed using 1 Ã Taq Extender Buffer, 0.2 mM of each
dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 3.0 Î¼M of each primer, 0.5 units of
Taq DNA Polymerase (Promega, Pittsburgh, PA), 0.5 units
of Taq Extender (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and approximately 500 ng of template DNA in 50 Î¼l total volume.
Amplification was accomplished using a thermal-cycling
scheme of an initial 94Â°C denaturation for 2 min, followed by 10 cycles of 94Â°C for 10 s, 55Â°C for 30 s and
68Â°C for 6 min. Sixteen additional cycles were performed
under the parameters of 94Â°C for 20 s, 55Â°C for 30 s and
68Â°C for 6 min with an additional 20 s added to this
extension time each cycle. A final, additional extension at
68Â°C for 7 min was also performed. In cases where multiple bands were produced, this process was repeated with
the extra MgCl2 removed. All newly designed PCR primers
are given in Table 4. All PCR products that were sequenced
were cleaned using a Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or a combination of five units of Exonuclease I and five units of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase

(USB, Cleveland, OH) in 10 Î¼l volume incubated at 37Â°C
for 1 h followed by 15 min at 80Â°C to inactivate the
enzymes. Sequencing was performed on a Beckman-Coulter CEQ-8000XL machine following the manufacturer's
protocol.
Phylogenetic analyses
ITS sequences were initially aligned using Clustal X [49]
followed by manual adjustment. Protein-coding plastid
sequences were easily aligned by eye, with attention paid
to codon alignment in the few areas where gaps existed. A
consensus of 500 bootstrap trees was created for each gene
individually using maximum parsimony in PAUP*4.0b10
[50]. Aligned datasets contained 684 base pairs (bp) for
ITS, 1,399 bp for rbcL, and 660 bp for rps2. A combined
bootstrap consensus was created using data from these
three genes combined with matK data (1,650 aligned bp,
4,393 combined bp) [51] , although not all taxa are available for every locus owing to gene loss and/or failed
amplification. Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated for each node using Mr. Bayes v3.0b4 [52]. Four cold
chains and one chain heated at the default value were run
with swapping according to default settings and a generaltime reversible (GTR) likelihood model with a gamma
and invariant parameter estimated from the data. One
million generations were run with sampling every hundredth generation for a total of 10,000 trees. Likelihood
estimates were graphed to determine appropriate burn-in
values for each gene (200 trees discarded for rps2 and rbcL,
400 trees discarded for ITS, 250 discarded for combined
data). In addition, maximum-likelihood phylograms and
non-parametric bootstrap values (100 replicates) were
generated with the program Garli (Version 0.951) using
default search options under the GTR + gamma + I model
for each of the three newly reported gene alignments with
parameters estimated from the data.

Genome size estimates
Nuclear genome size estimates and standard errors were
measured by flow cytometry [53] using either rice, soybean, tobacco, barley or wheat cultivars of known nuclear
genome size as standards. Four replicates were performed
for each plant, with the mean estimates and standard deviations (SD) reported in Table 1. Fresh plant material for
these measurements was grown in the Pennsylvania State
University Biology greenhouse. Cuscuta seeds were germinated after scarification in concentrated H2SO4 and grown
with Impatiens walleriana, Solenostemon scutellarioides or
Linum usitatissimum (for C. epilinum) as hosts. Fresh stem
tip tissue was used for all size estimates reported.
Rates analyses
Aligned datasets for atpE, rbcL and rps2 with identical sampling of 12 taxa were imported into HYPHY.99beta (see
[54]). A different set of taxa was used for rpoA, which is
missing in all sampled members of subgenus Grammica. A
user tree, based on highly supported nodes of the bootstrap consensus tree in Figure 2 that was congruent with
all single-gene analyses, was used for all genes (singlegene trees for atpE and rpoA not shown). Synonymous and
non-synonymous branch lengths were first calculated
with no constraints under the MG96, HKY 3, 4 codon
model. Next, a tree with all branches constrained to the
same non-synonymous to synonymous ratio was optimized, and a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed to
determine whether the unconstrained tree had a significantly better likelihood. Likelihood parameters were then
reoptimized for trees with the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio constrained differently for various clades
(i.e. two non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratios on
the tree; one for the subclade being tested, one for the
remainder of the tree). Clades examined in this manner
for atpE, rbcL and rps2 were the Convolvulaceae clade (Ipomoea + Cuscuta), all Cuscuta, all Cuscuta except subgenus
Monogyna and the clade comprising the three sampled
species of subgenus Grammica. For rpoA, clades examined
were Convolvulaceae, Cuscuta, subgenus Cuscuta and Cuscuta nitida. LRTs were confined to testing only hypotheses
of change at these nodes of interest rather than performing numerous additional tests and thereby increasing the
chance of Type I error.

Authors' contributions
JRM collected PCR data, performed analyses and wrote
the manuscript. KA performed flow cytometry nuclear
genome size estimation. JVK and JLB helped produce
complete plastid genome sequences for two Cuscuta species and a photosynthetic outgroup from which some loci
were extracted for this study and which were used extensively for primer design. CWD participated in design and
coordination of the research and extensively edited the
