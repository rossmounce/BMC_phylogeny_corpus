The structure, organization and radiation of
Sadhu non-long terminal repeat retroelements
in Arabidopsis species
Sanjida H Rangwala1,2, Eric J Richards1,3*

Abstract
Background: Sadhu elements are non-autonomous retroposons first recognized in Arabidopsis thaliana. There is a
wide degree of divergence among different elements, suggesting that these sequences are ancient in origin. Here
we report the results of several lines of investigation into the genomic organization and evolutionary history of this
element family.
Results: We present a classification scheme for Sadhu elements in A. thaliana, describing derivative elements
related to the full-length elements we reported previously. We characterized Sadhu5 elements in a set of A.
thaliana strains in order to trace the history of radiation in this subfamily. Sequences surrounding the target sites of
different Sadhu insertions are consistent with mobilization by LINE retroelements. Finally, we identified Sadhu
elements grouping into distinct subfamilies in two related species, Arabidopsis arenosa and Arabidopsis lyrata.
Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that the Sadhu retroelement family has undergone target primed reverse
transcription-driven retrotransposition during the divergence of different A. thaliana strains. In addition, Sadhu
elements can be found at moderate copy number in three distinct Arabidopsis species, indicating that the
evolutionary history of these sequences can be traced back at least several millions of years.

Background
We previously reported a novel family of Arabidopsis
retroposons, Sadhu [1]. The typical Sadhu element contains a poly(A) tract and is flanked by a direct 7 to 16
base pair (bp) target site duplication (TSD). Similar to
small interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), Sadhu elements are non-protein coding and do not contain long
terminal repeats (LTRs); they are therefore expected to
be non-autonomous. Although plant SINEs are thought
to be mobilized by autonomous long interspersed
nuclear elements (LINEs), the source of the transposase
for Sadhu is not clear.
Structurally, Sadhu elements resemble SINEs (noncoding, poly(A) tract), but unlike known SINEs, they do
not contain sequence similarity to known non-coding
RNAs (for example, 5SrRNA, tRNA) [2]. Nor do Sadhu
elements carry conserved sequences similar to RNA
polymerase II TATA boxes or RNA polymerase III

promoter motifs (for example, A and B boxes). However, Sadhu elements share a motif near the 5’ end
(consensus 5’ CAATCGTTSC 3’) and an approximately
20 bp polypyrimidine region that we hypothesize might
attract GAGA-repeat binding transcription factors [3-5].
Sadhu elements in different Arabidopsis thaliana accessions are expressed, often at high levels. Sense transcription begins at or near the start of the element [6],
consistent with the hypothesis that these elements carry
their own internal promoter sequences. Expression can
also occur in the antisense direction, presumably from
promoters in the flanking DNA sequence. Whether
sense or antisense, transcription of Sadhu elements is
epigenetically regulated; silenced elements are associated
with cytosine methylation and packaged in chromatin
containing the dimethylated isoform of lysine 9 of histone H3 [1,6]. There is variation in the modes of silencing of various Sadhu family members highlighted by
differential susceptibility to epigenetic modifier mutations and distinct cytosine methylation profiles. These
findings suggest that Sadhu elements are silenced

independently and individually, not coordinately [6]. For
these diverse reasons, Sadhu represents a unique family
of non-LTR retroelements.
Related families of the same transposable element
class can often be detected by sequence similarity in
widely divergent species (see for example, [7,8]). Sadhu
elements within A. thaliana are highly divergent in
terms of nucleotide sequence, with an average pairwise
identity of less than 75%, suggestive of an ancient origin.
However, these sequences cannot be identified in any of
the current public genome databases outside of the
Brassicaceae. There are only 39 Sadhu-related sequences
in the A. thaliana genome, showing a dispersed distribution pattern across all five chromosomes. This moderate copy number is typical of Arabidopsis non-LTR
retroelements: there are approximately 130 SINE elements in the A. thaliana reference genome and less
than 1,500 LINEs [9]. The relatively low copy number of
non-LTR retroelements in A. thaliana suggests that the
transposition rate of these elements is low and/or that
new insertions have been effectively removed during the
evolutionary history of the species.
Here, we describe a classification scheme for this retroelement family. In addition, we investigate the organization and radiation of Sadhu sequences both in
different A. thaliana accessions and related Arabidopsis
species.

We designed a classification scheme for Sadhu elements
reflecting the phylogenetic grouping of these elements
into 10 distinct subfamilies in the A. thaliana genome
(Table 1, Figure 1, Additional file 1) [1]. Table 1 lists
the new nomenclature side by side with locus ID numbers (for full-length elements) or locus position (for partial elements). Sadhu elements that extend from the 5’
conserved motif 5’ CAATCGTTSC 3’ to a 3’ poly(A)
tract approximately 900 bp downstream have been
designated ‘full length’. Full-length elements on the
same branch of the phylogeny share a family name
(Sadhu#), but have different element names (SadhuX-#).
Elements that closely align (>75% identity) to a unique
full-length element are designated ‘d’ indicating derived;
for example, Sadhu5-1d1 is likely to be derived from
Sadhu5-1. Sadhu-related sequences that are not similar
to a unique full-length element are assigned to the nearest full-length element on a pairwise BLAST search with
the designation ‘L’ for ‘like’ (for example, Sadhu3L). See
Additional file 1 for divergence matrices among elements within different subfamilies and among
subfamilies.

Partial Sadhu elements

The Sadhu2, Sadhu3, Sadhu4, Sadhu5, and Sadhu6 subfamilies feature derivative sequences that are greater
than 80% identical to a particular full-length element
(Figure 2, Table 1, Additional file 1). Many of the partial
elements sequences are 5’ truncated: that is, the region

would expect to see DNA sequence similarity extending
beyond the Sadhu-related sequence. However, none of
the Sadhu elements in the Columbia (Col) reference
genome shares significant sequence similarity in flanking
genomic regions with their derivative elements. Therefore, it is more likely that the partial elements are remnants of ancestral retrotransposition followed by
template switching, deletion and/or divergence.

of similarity shared with the most closely related fulllength element does not extend to the 5’ end, but contains remnants of 3’ poly(A) tracts (recognizably A-rich
regions) and, in some cases, flanking direct repeats that
represent TSDs. This pattern is consistent with abortive
retrotransposition. Other partial sequences align to
internal sections of full-length elements. In the case of
Sadhu2-1d, a 3’ poly(A) tract is detectable, but is preceded by a stretch of DNA sequence (19 bp) that does
not align to the prospective progenitor Sadhu element
(Figure 2c; Sadhu7L1 and Sadhu10L3 also have this
structure). This type of chimeric retrotransposon structure can result from template switching during retrotransposition [10,11]. In contrast, the Sadhu8L3
derivative terminates in a poly(A) tract at a position earlier than its closest full-length element (Figure 2e). This
structure might arise from abortive transcription and
early polyadenylation of the precursor sequence or
through subsequent internal deletion of the element. If
partial elements arose by segmental duplication, we

A comparison of the genome sequences of two Arabidopsis strains, Col and Ler, revealed over 150 indels
caused by differential activity of transposable elements
between the strains [12]. We previously reported that
several Sadhu elements from different subfamilies are
also polymorphic in terms of presence/absence among
different Arabidopsis strains [1,6]. Below, we examine
closely related elements from a single subfamily in a set
of 24 A. thaliana strains in order to trace the retrotranspositional history of these elements. The Sadhu5 subfamily contains four elements that are all greater than
80% identical to one another in the Col reference genome and close to full-length or full-length (>600 bp)
(Figure 2a). Sadhu5-1 and Sadhu5-2 are 83% identical
to one another, while the two derivative elements,
Sadhu5-1d1 and Sadhu5-1d2, are greater than 95%
identical to Sadhu5-1. This family therefore represents a
closely related group of sequences that might have
expanded during the recent evolutionary history of the
species.
We began by examining the Sadhu5-2 element.
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product corresponding to an internal region of this element was present in
every strain examined (Table 2). We investigated
whether Sadhu5-2 elements in different strains were
present in the same genomic location: using an outward
facing forward primer in the element and reverse primers designed based on the Col reference genome 5’
and 3’ adjacent sequence, we attempted to amplify PCR
products spanning the flanks of the elements. In every
case, we were successful in amplifying products of the
expected size (Table 2). Therefore, it is likely that
Sadhu5-2 represents a single insertion event in the
ancestor of the A. thaliana lineage.
In contrast to our finding for Sadhu5-2, we were
unable to amplify PCR products from several strains
using primers specific to the Sadhu5-1, Sadhu5-1d1 or
Sadhu5-1d2 insertion sites in the Col strain (Table 2).
To investigate the structure of putative deletions or
‘empty’ sites for these elements, we amplified PCR products from these strains using primers located 5’ and 3’
of the element in the Col reference genome. We identified 2 strains for Sadhu5-1 and 17 strains for Sadhu51d1 that amplified a specific, shorter PCR product than

would be predicted from the reference genome. We
obtained DNA sequence for these PCR products: in
every case, there was a clean retrotransposition ‘empty
site’, with a single, identical copy of the target site duplication of the element in strain Col (Figure 3). The structure of the ‘empty’ versus the ‘filled’ sites are typical of
retroelements that undergo target primed reverse transcription (TPRT) [13]. The Col strain carries the most
common haplotype for the region surrounding the
Sadhu5-1d1 insertion (Figure 3). Therefore, the most
parsimonious explanation is that the element inserted
relatively recently in the history of these strains, after
the divergence of different haplotypes in this region.
The identification of clean presence/absence polymorphisms among Arabidopsis strains also lends
support to the model that Sadhu5-1 and Sadhu5-1d1
are relatively recent retrotransposition events. In contrast, we could not find polymorphic insertion sites for
Sadhu5-1d2 and Sadhu5-2, suggesting that these
elements represent older, ancestral insertion events.
Sadhu5-2 appears to be a truncated retrotransposition
product relative to Sadhu5-1, as it is missing sequence

that would align with the 5’ portion of Sadhu5-1
(Figure 2a). Therefore, while the Sadhu5-2 sequence
itself appears more prevalent than Sadhu5-1, the latter
element could not be derived by retrotransposition or
gene duplication from the former without invoking a
subsequent deletion of the 5’ region of the element,
which is unlikely given that the same structure appears
to exist in all strains based on PCR of the flanking
regions (Table 2). An alternate hypothesis is that the
full-length ancestor to this subfamily has been deleted
or lost from the A. thaliana Col reference strain.
Target site consensus

TSDs are typical of most transposable elements. NonLTR retroelements mobilized by the LINE enzymatic
machinery feature TSDs of 7 to 20 bp in length. These
TSDs result from the target primed reverse transcription
mechanism, where two staggered cuts are made on the
target strand [13]. In mammals, the consensus for the
LINE 5’ endonuclease cleavage site contains two thymines, whereas the duplicated target site often starts
with a string of four adenines [14-16]. This string of

Sequences corresponding to Sadhu element insertions have been removed. Genbank accession numbers for Sadhu5-1 sequences are EF535531

adenines (thymines on the opposite strand) within the
target site are hypothesized to act in priming reverse
transcription from the poly(A) tail of the LINE transcript. SINEs, which are mobilized by hijacking of the
LINE machinery [17], have a similar target site preference as LINEs. While plant LINEs are predicted to
move in a similar manner to mammalian LINEs, the
consensus site has not yet been studied in a comprehensive manner. However, a study of Arabidopsis
SINEs indicated a similar consensus sequence as mammalian LINEs; a string of adenines within the target
site duplication, as well as a thymine at the 3’ nicking
site [18].
A total of 14 Sadhu sequences containing target site
duplications of between 7 and 16 bp were identified in
the A. thaliana genome (Table 3). We examined the
region around these target sites to determine whether 5’
and 3’ nicking site consensus patterns could be identified and, if so, whether they resembled patterns previously reported for LINEs and SINEs. As shown in
Figure 4, the 5’ nicking site does appear to favor a thymine (preceded by adenines), while the target site duplication also began with a stretch of adenines. There is no
strong consensus at the 3’ nicking site. These data are
consistent with a model in which Sadhu elements, similar to SINEs, are mobilized by the LINE-encoded target
primed reverse transcription machinery.

An examination of the A. thaliana Col reference genome [9] reveals less than 1,500 LINE superfamily-related
elements spanning 12 different lineages, including both
LINE1, LINE2, TA11 and TA12 families [19-21]. However, less than 50 LINEs in the A. thaliana reference genome are greater than 5,000 bp in length, and almost none
contain intact open reading frames. Therefore, while it is
evident that Sadhu elements have been mobile during

Sadhu elements can be identified in taxa outside
of A. thaliana

In order to explore the evolutionary distribution of the
Sadhu sequence family, we sought to identify Sadhu
homologs in two related species of the Brassicaceae
family, A. arenosa and A. lyrata. These species are estimated to have diverged from A. thaliana approximately
5 million years ago. The genomes of the three species
have changed significantly in that interval: Arabidopsis
arenosa and Arabidopsis lyrata maintain the ancestral
complement of eight chromosomes, while A. thaliana
has condensed its chromosome number to five [22,23].
Molecular evolutionary studies have determined that the
average sequence divergence at silent sites between A.
thaliana and A. arenosa or A. lyrata is 12% to 15% [22].
We attempted to isolate Sadhu elements from A. arenosa. DNA sequence was obtained from specific PCR
products that were generated using A. arenosa genomic
templates and primers corresponding to the A. thaliana
elements Sadhu5-1, Sadhu1-3, Sadhu3-1, and Sadhu8-1
(Table 4; Additional file 2). In a phylogenetic analysis,

the A. arenosa Sadhu sequences that we obtained cluster within the previously defined subfamilies (Figure 5a).
We conducted TAIL PCR using A. arenosa genomic
templates to identify more complete sequences for the
Sadhu elements identified by PCR. Three 5’ and four 3’
flanking sequences homologous to Sadhu1 were amplified and cloned from A. arenosa genomic DNA template
(Table 4, Additional file 3). Several of the 3’ Sadhu1
portions were >95% identical to one another, indicative
of recent retrotransposition in this subfamily. Two 5’
flanking clones (AaSadhu1FP3 and AlSadhu1FP1)
shared a stretch of 150 bp of sequence that does not
correspond to known Sadhu1 sequence in A. thaliana.
This extra sequence may have been transduced by the
Sadhu element resulting in a chimeric retroposon.
Both 3’ and 5’ flanking sequences were obtained by
TAIL PCR corresponding to A. arenosa Sadhu3 (Table
4 and Additional file 3). Because these sequences could
not be joined by PCR, there are likely to be at least two
members of this subfamily in A. arenosa. Sadhu5 TAIL
PCR sequences isolated from A. arenosa were 85% to
88% identical to A. thaliana Sadhu5 subfamily members
(5’ and 3’ portions) (Table 4 and Additional file 3). 5’
and 3’ sequences were also obtained corresponding to
Sadhu8 subfamily members from A. arenosa (Table 4

and Additional file 3). These sequences were greater
than 90% identical to one another and 75% to 79% identical to A. thaliana Sadhu8-1, indicating that retrotransposition occurred more recently than the divergence of
the two species. In summary, A. arenosa contains several
members of at least four Sadhu subfamilies. Examination of sequences flanking the Sadhu elements suggests
that these elements are located in non-orthologous positions in A. arenosa relative to A. thaliana (Additional
file 3).
A. lyrata Sadhu elements were identified from iterative BLAST searches of the recent A. lyrata genome
sequence assembly (JGI V. 1.0; Joint Genome Institute,
Walnut Creek, CA, USA). We used A. thaliana fulllength Sadhu sequences as queries in a primary search
to identify a set of A. lyrata sequences, which were
subsequently used as queries in secondary searches.
This method is expected to identify all full-length or
near full-length sequences, although shorter Sadhurelated partial elements might have been overlooked.
In total, we found 21 full-length and 4 partial Sadhu
elements greater than 350 bp in length (Table 5, Additional file 4). The number of full-length elements (21)
is similar to that in A. thaliana (16), indicating that
the element family is relatively small in both species.
Full-length A. lyrata elements are structurally similar
to Sadhu elements in A. thaliana: they begin with a
conserved motif (5’ CAATCGTTSC 3’ followed by a
polypyrimidine patch) and terminate approximately
900 bp downstream in a poly(A) tract. Of the 21 fulllength elements, 15 feature direct target site duplications of between 8 and 18 bp in length, suggesting that

they originated via retrotransposition. There are no
discernable conserved open reading frames. None of
the elements appear in orthologous locations to A.
thaliana elements, indicating that Sadhu elements
have mobilized considerably since the divergence of
the two species, and that related elements are similar
through retrotransposition and not through direct
inheritance of the genomic region.
A. lyrata elements are between 71% and 86% identical
to the most similar A. thaliana element (Table 5).
Figure 5b shows a phylogenetic tree showing the relationships among the 25 A. lyrata and 16 full-length
A. thaliana elements. All A. lyrata elements clustered
within previously defined subfamilies, indicating that the
divergence of the different subfamilies predated the split
of these two species. Most of the Sadhu subfamilies previously identified in A. thaliana have representatives in
A. lyrata; however, there is a dramatic expansion of
elements within certain subfamilies relative to others
(Figure 5b, Table 5). For instance, the Sadhu1 subfamily
contains three members in A. thaliana but has
expanded to seven full-length members in A. lyrata.
The Sadhu8 and Sadhu6 subfamilies are represented by
only a single member in A. thaliana, but feature six and
three full-length elements, respectively, in A. lyrata.
These genome comparisons suggest that, while multiple
distinct Sadhu subfamilies have been active since the
divergence of these two taxa, different subfamilies have
proliferated more in certain species than in others.
Alternatively, certain subfamilies may have been pared
down by deletion and elimination in one species relative
to the other.

Perspective

We have identified Sadhu sequences corresponding to
multiple subfamilies in the related species A. lyrata and
A. arenosa. The presence of target site duplications and
poly(A) tracts, along with the absence of orthologous
sites, strongly suggests that Sadhu elements in these
other taxa arose via retrotransposition. In a few cases,
elements within a given species are greater than 95%
identical to one another, indicating that these sequences
have mobilized more recently than the divergence of the
different species. The partial sequence available for the
Brassica genome [24] does not contain Sadhu-related
sequences. While these sequences may have been lost
from some taxa, the high degree of divergence amongst
elements in the Arabidopsis genus strongly suggests an
ancient origin for these elements. Therefore, we predict
that some sequences related to Sadhu elements might
be present in other plants, perhaps even those quite distantly related to Arabidopsis. These presumably more
divergent Sadhu relatives might share little overall primary nucleotide sequence with the A. thaliana

elements, but might have maintained other recognizable
diagnostic features, such as length, conserved 5’ motif(s),
a 3’ poly (A) tract, and target site duplications.
Low copy number and high divergence among element subfamilies is not a phenomenon unique to Sadhu
elements. Indeed, because only 10% of the Arabidopsis
genome is composed of transposable elements [25],
lower than other sequenced plant genomes, there may
be a general tendency for genome size reduction in this
species through progressive loss of repetitive DNA.
A comparison of the A. thaliana genome with the five
times larger Brassica oleracea genome revealed that
while most element families were present in both species, some (for example, CACTA elements) had contributed more than others to the relative expansion of the
Brassica genome [21]. As with the different Sadhu subfamilies, different SINE non-LTR subfamilies appear to
be more active in each of the two species [26]. The lack
of orthologous Sadhu insertion sites among different
Arabidopsis species is also reminiscent of the case with
SINEs, which similarly featured no shared sites in

Rangwala and Richards Mobile DNA 2010, 1:10
http://www.mobilednajournal.com/content/1/1/10

B. oleracea [26]. Both types of non-LTR elements are
therefore subject to frequent loss over evolutionary
time. This susceptibility may be a consequence of the
dispersed pattern of localization of Sadhus and SINEs:
elements that target heterochromatic regions, such as
Athila LTR elements, appear to be relatively protected
from this winnowing process [27].
Although retroelement superfamilies can typically be
found in widely differing plant taxa [8], certain families
show longer phylogenetic branch lengths and low copy
numbers more similar to the case with Sadhu. In particular, copia/Ty1 families in Arabidopsis are highly divergent from one another [19,28-30]. Non-LTR TA
elements are also present in few copies per genome
from distinct, evolutionarily ancient lineages [20]. This
high divergence among element subfamilies and lack of
orthologous sites in related species stands in stark contrast to primate non-LTR elements: L1s and Alus crowd
mammalian genomes, with both currently active lineages
as well as many defunct ancestral sites shared among
humans and their most recent relatives (for example,
[31-33]). Therefore, while the evolutionary trajectory of
Sadhu elements is not dramatically different from that
exhibited by some plant retroelements, it is unlike many
more well-studied elements.

Conclusions
Sadhu elements represent a previously little characterized retrotransposon family. We have generated a comprehensive classification scheme for these sequences
based on phylogenetic analysis. Partial elements often
contain 3’ poly(A) tracts and target site duplications,
consistent with an origin by target primed reverse transcription-driven retrotransposition. An examination of
the Sadhu5 subfamily among different A. thaliana
strains indicates that subfamily members arose through
retrotransposition; the presence of polymorphic insertion sites provides evidence for retrotransposition in the
recent history of the species. In addition, sequences at
the target site are similar to the Arabidopsis SINE consensus, consistent with the hypothesis that the LINE
machinery is responsible for the mobilization of both of
these types of elements. Sadhu-related sequences identified in A. lyrata and A. arenosa cluster within specific
A. thaliana subfamilies, indicating that the radiation of
this element family preceded the divergence of the Arabidopsis genus. These A. lyrata and A. arenosa elements
often contain poly(A) tracts and target site duplications,
consistent with the model that these sequences also
arose via retrotransposition. Taken together, these studies indicate that Sadhu elements have been active since
the divergence of different Arabidopsis species, and
through the differentiation of different A. thaliana
strains. Further research is warranted to resolve the

molecular origin and potential impact of this unique
class of DNA sequence on genome structure and
organization.

Methods
Plant materials

A. thaliana strains were obtained from the Arabidopsis
Biological Resource Center (ABRC, Columbus, OH, USA).
Stock numbers are listed in Table 2. A. arenosa seeds were
obtained from Craig Pikaard (Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA). Plants were grown
on soil or on 1 × MS media with 1% sucrose. DNA was
isolated using previously described methods [34].
Molecular biology

PCR was performed using standard conditions with Taq
DNA polymerase (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) or
KT1 polymerase (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).
Two rounds of TAIL PCR were performed on A. arenosa template using protocols and degenerate AD primers described previously [35]. Products from the
second round of TAIL PCR were isolated from agarose
gel and TA cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) before sequencing. All other PCR products were directly sequenced without an additional
cloning step following purification through Performa
DTR gel filtration cartridges (Edge BioSystems,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA). DNA sequencing was performed using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA,, USA) protocols/reagents;
sequences were processed at the Washington University
Department of Biology sequencing facility. PCR primers
used to generate the data in Tables 2 and 4 are
described in Additional file 2. ‘Internal’ PCR primers
were used to amplify sequence from different A. thaliana strains and to amplify homologs from A. arenosa.
All sequences in this study have been deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
database. Genbank accession numbers are listed in
Table 3 (for A. arenosa sequences) and in the legend to
Figure 3 (for A. thaliana strain specific sequences).
Computational analysis

Full-length and partial Sadhu elements were identified
based on sequence similarity to At2 g01410 as previously described [1]. The maximum parsimony and
neighbor joining trees in Figures 1 and 5 were generated
using the software PAUP* V. 4.0 (Sinauer Associates,
Sunderland, MA, USA) based on a ClustalX alignment
[36]. Divergence matrices in Additional file 1 were generated based on a ClustalX alignment using the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite
(EMBOSS) program ‘distmat’ [37] run without corrections. Consensus sequences of different subfamilies were

Rangwala and Richards Mobile DNA 2010, 1:10
http://www.mobilednajournal.com/content/1/1/10

generated from full-length and derivative sequences
using the EMBOSS program ‘cons’ [37]. Alignments in
Figure 3 were visualized by ClustalX [36]. WebLogo [38]
was used to create the logo images in Figure 4 that
describe the retrotransposition target consensus sites.
Annotations of features within TAIL PCR products in
Additional file 3 were aided by the repeat masker feature on the Censor server [39] and the TAIR WUBLAST server [40]. A. lyrata sequence information was
obtained using the database, browser, and BLAST tools
at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [41]. A. lyrata
Sadhu elements were identified by iterative BLAST
searches of the JGI assembly using, initially, A. thaliana
and then A. lyrata Sadhu sequences as queries until a
self-referencing set of sequences was identified. The
classification scheme in Table 1 and locus ID and
nucleotide positions for full-length elements have been
submitted to both The Arabidopsis Information
Resource (TAIR) [9] as well as the repeat database at
the Genetic Information Research Institute (GIRI) [42].

The scale is indicated. Internal polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
sequences used specific primers based on the Arabidopsis thaliana
sequence, while 5’ and 3’ sequences were obtained by thermal

sequences are in blue, 3’ Sadhu sequences are orange. Gray dotted
arrows indicate the extent of Sadhu sequence homology. Features in
flanking sequences are marked as green boxes. The inverted arrow in the
annotation of the Aa5FP1 clone indicates the direction of transcription of
the flanking gene-related sequence. Sadhu5 and Sadhu8 3’ sequences
feature poly(A) tracts at the Sadhu boundary, consistent with
retrotransposition.
