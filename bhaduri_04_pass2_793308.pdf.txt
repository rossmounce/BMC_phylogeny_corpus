Abstract
Background: The functional selection and three-dimensional structural constraints of proteins in
nature often relates to the retention of significant sequence similarity between proteins of similar
fold and function despite poor sequence identity. Organization of structure-based sequence
alignments for distantly related proteins, provides a map of the conserved and critical regions of
the protein universe that is useful for the analysis of folding principles, for the evolutionary
unification of protein families and for maximizing the information return from experimental
structure determination. The Protein Alignment organised as Structural Superfamily (PASS2)
database represents continuously updated, structural alignments for evolutionary related,
sequentially distant proteins.
Description: An automated and updated version of PASS2 is, in direct correspondence with
SCOP 1.63, consisting of sequences having identity below 40% among themselves. Protein domains
have been grouped into 628 multi-member superfamilies and 566 single member superfamilies.
Structure-based sequence alignments for the superfamilies have been obtained using COMPARER,
while initial equivalencies have been derived from a preliminary superposition using LSQMAN or
STAMP 4.0. The final sequence alignments have been annotated for structural features using
JOY4.0. The database is supplemented with sequence relatives belonging to different genomes,
conserved spatially interacting and structural motifs, probabilistic hidden markov models of
superfamilies based on the alignments and useful links to other databases. Probabilistic models and
sensitive position specific profiles obtained from reliable superfamily alignments aid annotation of
remote homologues and are useful tools in structural and functional genomics. PASS2 presents the
phylogeny of its members both based on sequence and structural dissimilarities. Clustering of
members allows us to understand diversification of the family members. The search engine has
been improved for simpler browsing of the database.
Conclusions: The database resolves alignments among the structural domains consisting of
evolutionarily diverged set of sequences. Availability of reliable sequence alignments of distantly
related proteins despite poor sequence identity and single-member superfamilies permit better
sampling of structures in libraries for fold recognition of new sequences and for the understanding
of protein structure-function relationships of individual superfamilies. PASS2 is accessible at http://

Background
Classification of proteins into families is performed on
the basis of the similarity of sequences to the family members [1,2]. Importantly, however, detectable global
sequence similarity in a protein family is not required for
retention of the three-dimensional fold and only a very
small number of conserved functional residues are
required for biochemical activity amongst proteins
belonging to a superfamily [3]. Establishing evolutionary
relationships between superfamily members having similar structure and function but sequentially diverged is
challenging. Over 49,000 domains deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [4] are organized in different databases by hierarchical classification schemes or in terms of
structural neighbourhood distances [5-7]. SCOP (1.63
release) records 49,497 protein domains, grouped into
merely 765 folds, suggesting a strong structural convergence of proteins. Homologous families can be easily
grouped by simple sequence searches whereas superfamily members, adopting the same fold and performing
similar biological roles [8-13] can often be identified by
sensitive fold prediction algorithms followed by a careful
alignment of sequences.
Availability of reliable sequence alignments for distantly
related proteins despite poor sequence identity permits
better sampling of structures in libraries for fold recognition of new sequences and for the understanding of protein structure-function relationships of individual
superfamilies. In addition, the construction of threedimensional models using homology modelling techniques are usually reliable where the sequence identity
between query and the structural homologues (templates)
are 30% or above. Analyses of structural and sequence differences amongst known superfamily members can hopefully provide useful guidelines for modelling distantly
related proteins. PASS2 database [14,15] presents alignments of sequentially distant proteins related at the superfamily level. We report an automated, updated version of
the superfamily alignment database that is in direct correspondence with SCOP (1.63) database.

Construction and content
The present version of PASS2 consider domains as
assigned in SCOP 1.63 [6]. Domains within a superfamily, no more than 40% identical with each other, have
been considered for curating the database. The choice of
40% cut-off in percentage sequence identity, as compared
to the previous version of PASS2 that works at 25% identity level, was to reduce the number of single-member
superfamilies. The 4,001 protein domains were assigned
1,194 superfamilies spanning the seven classes of proteins
and were thus chosen for structure based sequence
alignments.

Curation of alignments
Structural domains, obtained consulting SCOP [6] definitions, have been grouped at the superfamily level and
superposed by rigid-body superposition (Figure 1). An
initial superposition for all the structural domains belonging to each non-redundant superfamily was performed
using LSQMAN [16] or STAMP 4.0 [17]. LSQMAN [16]
was used for superposing two member superfamilies
while STAMP 4.0 [17] was utilised in multi-member
superfamilies. From the coarse alignment, equivalent
regions were identified using JOY [18]. COMPARER [19]
was employed to derive a refined alignment and superposition for the structures. Superposition was achieved by
the choice of 'initial equivalencies' that served as seeds for
pairwise rigid-body superposition using PMNFC, a modified form of MNYFIT [20] (Figure 2). The final alignment
was presented using the three-dimensional structural features of JOY [18] (Figure 3).

Utility and discussion
Assigning new structural entries to pre-existing
superfamilies
Improved methods of protein engineering, crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have led to a surge of new
three-dimensional protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. PASS2 allows classification of threedimensional domains into respective superfamilies based
on sequential and structural properties. Sequence of the
uploaded structure is compared to the hidden markov
models of PASS2 and assigned to superfamilies on the
basis of liberal expectation values (E = 1.0). Representative structures of the putative superfamilies have been
superposed with the query using LSQMAN [16], thus
associating the query to a particular superfamily. Alternatively, the user can superpose an uploaded structure to
specific superfamilies.
Predicting superfamilies and alignment for sequences
Links have been provided to popular sequence search
methods like PSI-BLAST [21] and PHI-BLAST [22], which
may be employed to associate unannotated sequences to
PASS2 superfamilies. A sequence to probabilistic profile
match method Hmmpfam [23] can also be used for similar assignment. Sequence alignments for a query sequence
can be obtained with superfamily members using
MALIGN [24]. 3-dimensional features can also be attributed to the sequence alignment using JOY [18].
Hidden markov models for PASS2
During search for sequence homologues and sequence
assignment, profile-based methods perform better compared to those that use pairwise comparisons [25]. Family
profiles based on hidden markov models are popular
probabilistic models applied for sequence annotations
and searches [26,27]. Structure-based sequence alignment

of respective superfamilies in PASS2 provides a reliable
basis for building hidden markov models. We provide
HMMs, built using HMM suite [23], for superfamily alignments corresponding to the latest version of PASS2. The
performances of these HMMs have been compared with
models built using their structural homologues present in
the PDB [28]. Search for homologues have been performed on the non-redundant sequence database using
both sets of models. Higher coverage has been obtained
(Table 1) for superfamilies using PASS2 HMMs suggesting
their value in sensitive sequence searches. Hidden markov
models for both the structure-based sequence alignments
and the sequence enriched superfamily alignments can be
downloaded from the World Wide Web.

Superfamily members in the genome database
PASS2 has several new features to associate the structurebased sequences to their homologues in various genome
databases. Sequence homologues of the superfamilies
have been searched in the non-redundant sequence database using PSI-BLAST [21] and Hmmsearch [23]. For the
PSI-BLAST searches, individual member for each superfamily was queried against the non-redundant sequence
database. The expectation value was set to 0.001 with 20
iterations. Hidden Markov Models for every superfamily
was built using structural alignments (as explained
above). These models were searched against the nonredundant database to enrich the sequence members
using the Hmmsearch program belonging to the HMM
suite applying an E-value threshold of 0.1. A third
approach has been to employ interacting motifs,

family (based on the RMSD value) is also provided.
Motifs represent invariant regions of the superfamily and
are helpful in protein design, engineering and folding
studies. Spatially conserved interacting motifs are identified as described elsewhere [29] for each superfamily and
are listed in the current version of the database along with
psuedoenergies for their spatial interactions (Bhaduri et
al., in press). Corresponding links to the structural motifs
of superfamily (SMoS) database [31] can also be accessed.
Phylogenetic analysis aids in the understanding of the
diversity among the members. Diversification of structural members may be studied in terms of the dissimilarity of structure or divergence of the sequences. The
database has been linked to other useful protein databases
as in the previous version of PASS2 [15].

PASS2 and its applications
PASS2 is a compendium of structure-based sequence
alignments of distantly related proteins grouped at the
superfamily level in direct correspondence with SCOP
definitions. Furthermore, PASS2 acts as a 'junction' point
to obtain links of representative superfamily members to
genome, sequence and structural databases. Phylogenies
of superfamily members provide a crude but quantitative
estimate of evolutionary relationships among the members. Motifs explain the invariant regions of proteins acting as descriptors for the superfamily. HMM models can
be useful in identifying more members. Availability of
such alignment databases over the World Wide Web facilitates the study and design of experiments on specific
superfamilies. They also enable systematic survey and
analysis of various structural properties for performing
fold predictions. The database may be accessed and downloaded across the World Wide Web.

Conclusions
Associating different proteins with structurally similar and
evolutionarily related proteins enhance our functional
understanding of protein superfamily. The multiple alignments of distantly related representatives are particularly
informative and often reveal a signature of invariantly
conserved residues. Access to sequence alignments of distantly related proteins over the World Wide Web offers the
possibility to study and design experiments on specific
superfamilies. They also permit systematic survey and
analysis of various structural properties and to perform
fold predictions.
