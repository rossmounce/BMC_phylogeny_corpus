Abstract
Background: Competitive displacement of a weakly virulent pathogen strain by a more virulent
strain is one route to disease emergence. However the mechanisms by which pathogens compete
for access to hosts are poorly understood. Among vector-borne pathogens, variation in the ability
to infect vectors may effect displacement. The current study focused on competitive displacement
in dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3), a mosquito-borne pathogen of humans. In Sri Lanka in the
1980's, a native DENV3 strain associated with relatively mild dengue disease was displaced by an
invasive DENV3 strain associated with the most severe disease manifestations, dengue
hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), resulting in an outbreak of DHF/DSS. Here
we tested the hypothesis that differences between the invasive and native strain in their infectivity
for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of DENV, contributed to the competitive success
of the invasive strain
Results: To be transmitted by a mosquito, DENV must infect and replicate in the midgut,
disseminate into the hemocoel, infect the salivary glands, and be released into the saliva. The ability
of the native and invasive DENV3 strains to complete the first three steps of this process in Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes was measured in vivo. The invasive strain infected a similar proportion of
mosquitoes as the native strain but replicated to significantly higher titers in the midgut and
disseminated with significantly greater efficiency than the native strain. In contrast, the native and
invasive strain showed no significant difference in replication in cultured mosquito, monkey or
human cells.
Conclusion: The invasive DENV3 strain infects and disseminates in Ae. aegypti more efficiently
than the displaced native DENV3 strain, suggesting that the invasive strain is transmitted more
efficiently. Replication in cultured cells did not adequately characterize the known phenotypic
differences between native and invasive DENV3 strains. Infection dynamics within the vector may
have a significant impact on the spread and replacement of dengue virus lineages.

Background
The mechanisms that drive competitive displacement of
one species by another have received considerable attention from ecologists in the context of species invasions by
free-living organisms [1-7]. Competitive displacement
may play an equally important role in the dynamics of
emerging infectious diseases. One of several mechanisms
of disease emergence [8] is the displacement of a pathogen strain of low virulence (defined here as the impact of
the pathogen on host fitness [9]), by a new, more virulent
strain. The mechanisms that facilitate competitive displacement of pathogens are broadly similar to those that
act in free-living organisms [7]: (i) exploitation competition, in which the pathogen with the highest rate of transmission pre-empts access to hosts either by killing them
[10] or by generating cross-immunity that prevents infection by competitors [11], (ii) direct competition, in which
a pathogen suppresses the replication of a co-infecting
competitor through mechanisms such as "theft" of proteins by viral genomes [12] or destruction of red blood
cells by Plasmodium [13], and (iii) apparent competition,
in which a pathogen triggers an immune response that is
more damaging to co-infecting competitors than to itself
[14]. Multiple mechanisms may contribute to displacement concurrently, particularly in vector-borne pathogens
where different mechanisms may be enacted in the host
and the vector [15].
In the current study we have investigated competitive displacement among strains of mosquito-borne dengue virus
(DENV, genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae), the etiological agent of classical dengue fever (DF) and its more severe
manifestations, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue
shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [16]. DF is an acute febrile
illness causing high levels of morbidity but low levels of
mortality; DHF/DSS is a capillary leakage syndrome
[17,18] with a case fatality rate of up to 14%, although
with proper medical care this rate is typically < 1% [19].
DENV is transmitted by mosquitoes in the genus Aedes,
primarily Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus [18,20]. Mosquito
eradication efforts in the mid-1900's reduced the geographic range of DENV to a small number of countries in
Southeast Asia, West Africa and the Caribbean. However,
subsequent reduction of these efforts, along with changes
in global travel patterns and lifestyles, have permitted a
resurgence of this virus over the past several decades, and
currently 100 million dengue virus infections per year
occur in over 100 countries [21-23]. This period has also
seen an increase in the severity of dengue disease, and
today DENV poses the greatest threat to human health of
all arthropod-borne viruses [21-23].
Diversity within DENV lineages falls into three generallyaccepted categories [21,24]. At the broadest scale, DENV is
comprised of four antigenically-distinct serotypes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/1

(DENV1-4). Within the human host, infection with a particular serotype confers lifelong homologous immunity to
that serotype and transient heterologous protection
against the other three serotypes. However following this
period of heterologous protection, sequential infections
with different serotypes are associated with enhanced disease [25,26], as documented in Thailand [27,28] and
Cuba [29]. The most likely mechanism for this association
is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), the process
by which antibodies against one serotype enhance binding of the other serotypes to FcλR-bearing cells, thereby
increasing virus replication and disease severity [25,26].
Within serotypes are embedded genotypes; studies to date
indicate that immunity to any genotype within a serotype
confers cross-immunity to all other genotypes within that
serotype. However genotypes can vary in their tendency to
be enhanced by heterologous antibody [30,31] or neutralized by heterologous antibody [26,30]. Additional groupings have been identified within genotypes which have
been variously termed subtypes, clades, variants, groups,
or strains and which for the sake of clarity are herein
termed strains.
Lineage turnover, among serotypes [32-34], genotypes
[24,35,36], and strains [37-41] is an increasingly common
feature of dengue virus epidemiology. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that some of these turnovers result from
evolution of existing lineages [39,42] or from extinction
and re-colonization [33,36], while others result from
active competitive displacement [24,32,37,38]. Mathematical models of competitive displacement among
DENV strains have typically focused on replication in the
human host as the driving force for competitive displacement [32,43,44] and have identified the effect of sequential infections by multiple serotypes as a critical
determinant of observed patterns of dengue epidemiology. Most have focused on the impact of ADE, reasoning
that ADE increases overall virus titer (concentration) in
the blood, which in turn increases the likelihood of mosquito infection and subsequent transmission [45], therefore strains with a higher tendency for enhancement are
likely to displace those with a lower tendency [44,46,47].
In addition, transient, antibody-mediated cross-immunity between serotypes may also trigger lineage replacement [43].
Mathematical and qualitative models of DENV dynamics
that fail to incorporate replication in the mosquito vector
will not adequately reflect the complete virus life cycle
[15] and may fail to identify critical components of competitive success. In the current study, we have tested the
hypothesis that variation in the intrinsic ability of DENV
strains to infect their mosquito vector, even when virus
titer in the bloodmeal is held constant, may contribute to
competitive displacement. We have focused on the spread

of a novel DENV3 strain (subtype III, group B) through Sri
Lanka in the 1980's and the subsequent displacement of
the circulating DENV3 strain (subtype III, group A), a
transition that permanently altered the pattern of dengue
disease in that country [38,48]. While Sri Lanka had experienced high levels of transmission of all four serotypes of
DENV prior to 1989, DHF/DSS was uncommon. This
changed dramatically in 1989, when the country experienced a surge in DHF cases that persists to present day
[48]. Messer et al. used surveillance data [48] coupled
with phylogenetic methods [38] to demonstrate that this
emergence of DHF resulted from the displacement of the
group A DENV3 strain by the group B DENV3 strain, hereafter termed the native and invasive strains, respectively.
Lanciotti et al. [42] first used phylogenetic analysis to
investigate the origins of the invasive DENV3 strain in Sri
Lanka and concluded that this lineage evolved from the
native lineage in situ via genetic drift. Messer et al. [38]
proposed two alternative hypotheses for the source of the
invasive strain, speculating that it may have been introduced from India or East Africa or that it may have been
present as a minor population that increased in abundance due to some unidentifed change in the selective
environment [38]. Irrespective of the origins of the invasive strain, the rapidity of this lineage turnover during a
period of relatively high levels of DENV transmission
strongly suggest that the replacement of the native strain
resulted from competitive displacement by the invasive
strain rather than extinction and re-colonization. Moreover the association of the displacing strain with DHF is
consistent with mathematical models that predict that a
greater propensity for replication enhancement will confer a competitive advantage. Nonetheless it is important
to ask whether the enhanced replication by the invasive
strain during DHF is augmented by greater infectivity for
mosquitoes, or whether, as has been predicted [49], a
trade-off between replication in the primary host and the
vector may counteract the advantage of achieving a higher
titer in humans.
In this study we measured the ability of the invasive and
native DENV3 strains to infect Ae. aegypti, the principal
mosquito vector of DENV. To be transmitted by a mosquito, DENV must infect and replicated in the midgut disseminate into the hemocoel, infect the salivary glands,
and be released into the saliva [50,51]; the first three steps
of this process were monitored here. Additionally, to test
whether phenotypes in cultured cells might adequately
reflect in vivo phenotypes, the replication of both the
native and invasive DENV3 strains was also tested in several mammalian and mosquito cells in culture. The patterns of infectivity detected in vivo give insight into the role
of exploitation competition in competitive displacement
among DENV strains.

Results
Viral fitness in cultured cells
The rate of focal spread of a virus through a monolayer of
cultured cells, for brevity termed plaque size, can reflect
viral fitness [52]. The mean of the 36 plaques measured
for each isolate was used as a single value to compare the
three isolates of the native strain and three isolates of the
invasive strain. Mean plaque size (in mm) of the two
strains did not differ in mosquito epithelial (Mean ± 1 se
for native = 0.38 ± 0.02, for invasive = 0.39 ± 0.02; student's t-test, df = 4; P > 0.5), human hepatoma (Mean ± 1
se for native = 2.03 ± 0.33, for invasive = 2.61 ± 0.83; student's t-test, df = 4; P > 0.5), or African green monkey kidney cells (Mean ± 1 se for native = 1.36 ± 0.14, for invasive
= 0.71 ± 0.36; student's t-test, df = 4; P = 0.07). This analysis was extended to a second measure of viral fitness,
multi-cycle replication kinetics, in both mosquito cells
and monkey cells. Replication kinetics of the three isolates
from each strain were remarkably similar in each cell type
(Figure 1). In mosquito cells, neither the mean maximum
titer (Mean ± 1 SE: 8.1 ± 0.09 log10pfu/ml in the invasive
strain, 8.1 ± 0.06 log10pfu/ml in the native strain; student's t-test, df = 4, P = 0.77) nor the mean number of
days needed to reach that titer (Mean ± 1 SE: 4.5 ± 0.2 days
for the invasive strain and 4.8 ± 0.1 days for the native
strain; student's t-test, df = 4, P = 0.26) differed between
the two strains. Similarly, in monkey cells neither the
mean maximum titer (Mean ± 1 SE: 7.0 ± 0.07 log10pfu/
ml for the invasive strain and 6.8 ± 0.2 for the native strain
log10pfu/ml; student's t-test, P = 0.57) nor the mean
number of days needed to reach that titer (Mean ± 1 SE:
5.2 ± 0.2 days for the invasive strain and 5.5 ± 0.4 days for
the native strain; student's t-test, P = 0.64) differed
between the two strains. Overall, DENV3 replicated to
higher maximum titers at a more rapid rate in mosquito
cells than in to monkey cells.
Virus infectivity for live mosquitoes
Ae. aegypti were fed on artificial bloodmeals containing
comparable, high titers of each of the six DENV3 isolates,
and the presence and concentration of virus in the mosquito body were used to measure infection and replication, respectively, while the presence of virus in the head
was used to measure dissemination. Native and invasive
DENV3 strains did not differ in the percentage of infections generated (Figure 2; median percent infected: native
DENV3 = 84, invasive DENV3 = 78; Mann-Whitney U test,
N = 6, P = 0.82), however mean virus titer in infected mosquitoes did differ significantly between the two groups
(Figure 3, Mean ± 1 se: native DENV3 = 2.2 ± 0.01
log10pfu/body, invasive DENV3 = 2.5 ± 0.01 log10pfu/
body; student's t-test, df = 4, P = 0.02). Moreover, this difference in titer was associated with significant difference
in the likelihood of dissemination; invasive DENV3 isolates generated a significantly higher percentage of dis-

In Sri Lanka in the 1980's, a DENV3 strain (subtype III,
group B) that caused a high incidence of severe disease
displaced a native DENV3 strain (subtype III, group A)
that had been associated with milder disease [38], resulting in an outbreak of severe dengue disease that persists to
the present day. While previous studies of the molecular
epidemiology of these lineages have documented the pat-

tern of displacement [38,48], they did not investigate the
mechanism. The current study tested the hypothesis that
exploitation competition, mediated by variation in the
ability of the two strains to infect and be transmitted by
their mosquito vector, may have contributed to the success of the invasive strain. During exploitation competition, pathogens may monopolize hosts either by killing
them or by generating an immune response that prevents
infection by competitors. The case fatality rate for dengue
disease, even DHF/DSS, is relatively low [19], thus dengue-induced mortality is unlikely to contribute greatly to
the dynamics of competition. However, within a serotype,
neutralizing antibody generated against one DENV strain
will neutralize all others. Thus if two homotypic DENV
strains co-circulate in a single host population, each host
infected by one of the strains becomes unavailable to the

other. Under these conditions the strain with the higher
rate of transmission should displace its competitor, in an
analogous fashion to the dynamics that result from variation among strains in their tendency to cause ADE
[44,46,47].
As a proxy for measuring rate of transmission, we tested
the ability of the native and invasive strain to infect, replicate, and disseminate in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, the major
vector of epidemic dengue [21]. It has long been recognized that DENV strains may vary in their infectivity for
Aedes vectors [53,54]. In this study the invasive DENV3
strain infected the same proportion of mosquitoes as the
native strain and the difference in replication between the
two, although significant, was slight, with the native strain
achieving a titer only about twice that of the native strain.

Surprisingly, this small difference in replication in the
body translated into significantly and substantially greater
efficiency of dissemination to the mosquito head than the
native DENV3, suggesting that the invasive strain would
be transmitted more efficiently than the native strain even
if both strains replicated to similar titers in the human
host. Studies of two other cases of competitive displacement among flaviviruses have identified variation in vector infectivity as a potential mechanism. First, extensive
work by Rico-Hesse and collaborators has shown that the
Southeast Asian DENV2, introduced into Cuba in 1981,
has subsequently displaced the American DENV2 genotype across most of the Americas. Because the Southeast
Asian genotype of DENV2 is associated with DHF/DSS
and American DENV2, as a general rule, is not (but note
exceptions in Puerto Rico [55] and Niue [56]), this displacement has resulted in large outbreaks of DHF [24].
The SE Asian strain of DENV2 is significantly more infectious for Ae. aegypti than the American strain that it has
displaced [57-60]. Additionally, the West Nile virus
(WNV) 02 strain appears to have displaced the NY99
strain in North America [61]. WNV02 has a shorter incubation period in Culex mosquitoes, and consequently
more rapid progress to transmission, than WNV NY99
[62,63]. Thus high infectivity for vectors may be a common feature of superior competitors in the flaviviruses
and possibly other arboviruses as well.
The differences between the two DENV3 strains in disease
association and mosquito infectivity were not reflected by
differences in replication in mosquito or mammalian cells
in culture, suggesting that phenotypes in culture may not
be a reliable indicator of dengue virus phenotypes in vivo.
Similarly, variation in the ability of WNV NY99 and
WNV02 to infect mosquitoes was not evident in the replication of these strains in C6/36 or Vero cells [62].
Three caveats to the findings reported here must be noted.
First, populations and species of Aedes can vary in their
susceptibility to DENV [53,54,64-71], so the susceptibility
of Ae. aegypti from the NIH colony may differ from that of
Sri Lankan populations of this species. Our comparison of
the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti from the NIH and Galveston colonies for three different DENV serotypes revealed
no differences between the two. Nonetheless, it would be
worthwhile in the future to test the infectivity of these
DENV3 strains in other strains of Ae. aegypti and other
Aedes species. Second, virus may be less infectious when
ingested in an artificial rather than a natural bloodmeal
[72], though there is no evidence that relative infectivity is
affected by the type of bloodmeal used. No tractable animal model that supports high levels of replication of wild
type DENV is currently available (although such models
are being developed, see [73]), so artificial bloodmeals
remain the closest approximation to natural transmission

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/1

possible for this type of study. Finally, the interpretation
that higher levels of infection will result in higher rates of
transmission depends upon the assumption that the
native and invasive strains have a similar impact on mosquito fitness. Theory suggests that vector-borne pathogens
should impose relatively small fitness costs on their vectors, though pathogens of vertebrates may be an exception
to this rule [15]. At present, the few studies that have
assessed the nature and magnitude of these costs for
DENV have all utilized mosquitoes infected via intrathoracic inoculation, a highly efficient but unnatural route of
infection. Two of these studies have tested the impact of
DENV infection on feeding behavior: Platt et al. [74]
reported that DENV infection resulted in a decrease in
feeding efficiency, whereas Putnam and Scott [75]
reported that it did not. Joshi et al. [76] detected a
decrease in survival of Ae. aegypti inoculated with DENV
relative to controls. In our experience, mosquitoes orally
infected with DENV show similar rates of survival compared to mosquitoes fed upon an uninfected bloodmeal
(Hanley, unpublished data), but this pattern was not
explicitly tested in the current study. Thus, the impact
DENV infection on mosquito fitness, and variation
among DENV strains in their fitness costs, remain to be
investigated.
While the results of this study support the importance of
exploitation competition, mediated by variation in vector
infectivity, in the displacement of the native DENV3
strain, other mechanisms of competition may also have
played a role. For DENV, co-infection of human hosts and
mosquito vectors by multiple serotypes and genotypes has
been documented [77-80] and in some outbreaks coinfection of mosquitoes is relatively common [81]. Thus
direct and apparent competition, both of which require
concurrent infection, are possible. Moreover, variation in
infection rates and replication within the host remains an
important determinant of competitive success. The invasive DENV3 strain, like invasive SE Asian DENV2 [24],
was strongly associated with enhanced disease while the
native strain was not. At present it is not known whether
either strain is associated with severe dengue because it is
more prone to enhancement, less prone to cross-neutralization, or intrinsically more virulent than the native strain
[30,38,60]. Nevertheless, the idea of DENV strains with a
high likelihood of causing severe disease displacing
strains that have not caused severe disease in the same setting supports the hypothesis that high levels of replication
increase both disease severity and rates of transmission
[44,47,82,83]. Elucidating the conditions under which
various mechanisms may impact the dynamics of vectorborne pathogens, and determining whether such conditions are met by dengue virus, should provide a fertile area
of research. Such studies will be crucial to predicting and
controlling the progress of the global dengue pandemic.

Conclusion
The resurgence of the dengue virus (DENV) pandemic in
recent decades has been characterized by increases in both
incidence and disease severity. Both may be due in part to
the displacement of low virulence DENV strains by higher
virulence strains. However the mechanisms that drive
strain replacement are not well understood, the impact of
intrinsic virulence versus interactions with pre-existing
antibody are difficult to disentangle, and the importance
of virus-vector interactions has been largely neglected. The
current study focuses on the competitive displacement of
a native strain of DENV3 in Sri Lanka that was associated
with relatively mild disease by a new DENV3 strain associated with severe disease in the 1980's, resulting in an
outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever that persists to
present day. Specifically, we demonstrated that the invasive strain replicates to higher titer and disseminates more
efficiently in Ae. aegypti, the principal vector of DENV.
Thus, in this system, greater replication in the host is coupled to greater replication in the vector, and the synergy of
these two phenotypes may explain the competitive success of the invasive strain. These results suggest that the
evolution of greater virulence in DENV may not carry the
cost of poor infectivity for the vector, and thus the severity
of dengue disease may continue to escalate. Since there is
currently neither a vaccine nor antiviral therapy available
to control the spread of dengue [84], a better understanding of the potential for transmission of highly virulent
strains is needed in order to guide surveillance and target
control efforts in order to best prevent outbreaks of severe
dengue disease.

Methods
Viruses and cells
Native DENV3 isolates 3002, 3009 and 3011 correspond
to 83SriLan2 [CDC:SK0087], 89SriLan2 [CDC:SK0396]
and 85SriLan [CDC:073], respectively in Messer et al.
[38]; invasive DENV3 isolates 3001, 3006 and 3010 correspond to 89SriLan1 [CDC:SK0389], 97SriLan1 and 93
SriLan1 [CDC:SK0693], respectively [38]. All six viruses
are derived from clinical isolates that were passaged a total
of three times in C6/36 cells prior to use in this study.
Recombinant viruses rDEN1, rDEN3 and rDEN4 have
been utilized as a foundation for dengue virus vaccine
development (see Blaney et al. [85] for a review of the origin and passage history of these viruses). Vero cells (African green monkey kidney) [86] were maintained at 35°C
in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in MEM (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 2 mM Lglutamine (Invitrogen) and 0.05 mg/
ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). HuH-7 cells [87] were maintained at 35°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in D-MEM/
F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FB, 2 mM Lglutamine, and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin. C6/36 cells (Ae.
albopictus epithelial cells) [88] were maintained at 32°C in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/1

an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in MEM containing 10% FBS,
2 mM L-glutamine, 2 mM nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin.
Virus phenotypes in cultured cells
Each of the six DENV3 isolates were inoculated at dilutions designed to produce approximately 50 plaques per
well onto 80% confluent monolayers of C6/36, Vero, and
HuH-7 cells in 6-well plates. Plates were incubated at the
appropriate temperature with occasional rocking for 2 hrs
and overlaid with 1% methylcellulose supplemented with
2% FBS, 2 mM glutamine and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin.
Plates were incubated for 5 days and plaques were visualized by immunostaining using anti-DENV3 hybridoma
cell supernatant as previously described [89]. For each
virus-cell type combination, 36 randomly-chosen plaques
were measured as previously described [90]. To assess
multicycle replication kinetics, each of the six DENV3 isolates were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1
onto triplicate confluent monolayers of either Vero or C6/
36 cells in 25 mm flasks. Virus was incubated at the appropriate temperature for the cell line for 20 minutes, after
which the inoculum was removed and cells washed twice
in 3 ml of appropriate media. Each monolayer was then
covered in a total volume of 6 ml media. After 5 min, 1 ml
of cell supernatant, designated as the Day 0 sample, was
removed from each flask, aliquoted into two vials, flash
frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C. Each flask was then
replenished with 1 ml appropriate media. Samples were
then taken in the same manner at 24-hour intervals for the
next six days. Virus titers were determined on monolayers
of same cell type as the original substrate for replication
by inoculating 24-well plates with serial 10-fold dilutions
of cell supernatant. Plates were overlaid with methylcellulose medium, incubated for 5 days, and immunostained
as described above.
Virus infectivity for live mosquitoes
To experimentally measure the infectivity of DENV3 isolates for a natural vector, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) colony, see description below, at 5–10 days old were fed on individual artificial bloodmeals containing high titers (7.1–8.1 log10
plaque forming units (pfu)/ml) of each of the six DENV3
isolates using previously described methods [90]. There
was no significant difference between the mean titer of
native (7.7 ± 0.12 log10pfu/ml) and invasive (7.6 ± 0.12
log10pfu/ml) isolates in the bloodmeals (Student's t-test,
df = 4, P = 0.66). Fully engorged females were removed
into new containers, fed on cotton pledgets soaked in
10% sucrose and incubated at 27°C, 80% RH for 21 days.
Under optimal conditions, dengue virus generally transits
from the bloodmeal to the saliva in a period of about 9
days, and recent reports suggest that this time course may
be even shorter in certain strains of Ae. aegypti [51]. The

21-day incubation period used in this study, which
exceeds the median lifespan of Ae. aegypti in nature [91]
but not in the laboratory [92,93], was chosen to maximize
the opportunity for viruses that may replicate relatively
slowly to disseminate into the hemocoel, thereby focusing
on the ability of each of the six isolates to complete the
designated steps in transmission rather than the rate at
which they did so. At the end of this period mosquitoes
were frozen at -80 C and later dissected. Three samples
were taken from each mosquito: (i) To create an archive,
legs were removed into a new tube and stored at -80°C,
(ii) To assess the efficiency of viral dissemination, the
head of each mosquito was removed, squashed on a glass
slide and fixed in 100% acetone. Virus antigen was
detected in these preparations using an indirect immunofluorescence assay with anti-DENV3 hybridoma cell
supernatant as the primary antibody as previously
described [45], (iii) To assess overall infection, the
remainder of the body was ground using a mortar and
pestle in 250 μl Hanks balanced salt solution (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 250 μg/ml amphotericin,
1% ciprofloxacin, and 150 mg/ml clindamycin. Virus titer
in each sample was determined by serial titration in C6/
36 cell monolayers as described above.
The NIH colony Ae. aegypti were derived in 2004 from
progeny of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
(WRAIR) colony. A long period of colony maintenance
can affect the susceptibility of mosquitoes to arboviruses
[24,94]. To assess the susceptibility of the NIH colony,
progeny of another widely used strain of Ae. aegypti from
the University of Texas, Medical Branch at Galveston were
obtained. The Galveston colony was initiated from eggs
collected in the Galveston area in 2000–2001 and has
been maintained continuously since that time. Groups of
mosquitoes derived from each colony were reared under
the conditions described above and fed as described
above on bloodmeals with titers of approximately 7.0
log10pfu/ml of one of three viruses encompassing three
different DENV serotypes: rDEN1, rDEN3 or rDEN4. Mosquitoes were dissected as described above, and head and
body samples were titered in C6/36 monolayers as
described above.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/8/1

mosquito bodies and heads infected were compared with
a Mann-Whitney U test. To test the effect of mean virus
titer in the body on dissemination to the head, values for
percent dissemination were first transformed using the
arcsine-square root transformation and then a linear
regression of these transformed values against the body
titer was conducted. Sample sizes were too small to confirm that this transformation rendered the data normal,
however a Kendall Rank correlation (not shown) provided qualitatively similar results. In comparisons of the
susceptibility of mosquitoes from the NIH and Galveston
colonies, for each serotype percent of midguts and heads
infected were compared separately using a Fisher's exact
test and mean titers were compared using a Student's ttest.

Statistical analysis
To avoid pseudoreplication, all comparisons of the native
and invasive DENV3 used mean plaque size or titer or
total numbers infected/uninfected per isolate, e.g. N = 6,
for all comparisons. Plaque size, virus titer, maximum
titer, and day of maximum titer were compared using a
Student's t-test; since each value in the test was a mean of
multiple measurements (e.g. 36 plaques/isolates, 3 replicates/growth curve/isolate), parametric statistics were
deemed appropriate. All individual titer values for all
analyses were log transformed prior to analysis. Percent
