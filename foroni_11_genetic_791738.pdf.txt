Abstract
Background: Cell surface pili in Gram positive bacteria have been reported to orchestrate the colonization of host
tissues, evasion of immunity and the development of biofilms. So far, little if any information is available on the
presence of pilus-like structures in human gut commensals like bifidobacteria.
Results and discussion: In this report, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) of various bifidobacterial strains belonging
to Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium dentium, Bifidobacterium
adolescentis and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis revealed the existence of appendages resembling pilus-like
structures. Interestingly, these microorganisms harbour two to six predicted pilus gene clusters in their genome,
with each organized in an operon encompassing the major pilin subunit-encoding gene (designated fimA or fimP)
together with one or two minor pilin subunit-encoding genes (designated as fimB and/or fimQ), and a gene
encoding a sortase enzyme (strA). Quantitative Real Time (qRT)-PCR analysis and RT-PCR experiments revealed a
polycistronic mRNA, encompassing the fimA/P and fimB/Q genes, which are differentially expressed upon
cultivation of bifidobacteria on various glycans.

Introduction
Pili or fimbriae are hair-like appendages commonly
found in various Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria (for a review see [1]). Unlike Gram negative pili,
whose subunits associate via non-covalent interactions,
most pili detected in Gram positive bacteria are formed
by covalent polymerization of pilin subunits, orchestrated by transpeptidase enzymes called sortases [2,3].
The general principles of pilus assembly/structure in
Gram positive bacteria were first established for the
pathogens Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Actinomyces naeslundii[2-5]. In these microorganisms, the

genes for pilus formation and assembly are arranged in
pathogenic islets that each encode one major pilin
(represented by either SpaA, SpaD, or SpaH in C.
diphtheriae, or FimA or FimP in A. naeslundii; Spa
stands for sortase-mediated pilus assembly and Fim for
fimbria-associated adhesion, respectively), one or two
minor pilins (represented by the SpaB and SpaC, SpaE
and SpaF, or SpaG and SpaI subunit couples in C.
diphtheriae, or the FimB or FimQ subunits in A. naeslundii), and a pilus-specific sortase) ([1,2,4,6,7]. In Actinomyces the fimQP and the fimAB-loci encode fimbrial
structures composed of a shaft protein, being either
FimA or FimP, and a tip protein, represented by either
FimB or FimQ, respectively [3,8]. Pilus gene clusters
that encode a sortase have been found in many important Gram positive pathogens including Clostridium perfringens, enterococci and various streptococcal species,

as well as in the Actinomyces taxon [1,2,7,9]. Recently,
two pilus gene clusters have been identified in the genome of a human gut commensal Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG [10,11].
It has been shown that pili are involved in the attachment/colonization of members of the human microbiota
to host tissues, as pilus-mediated adherence is a critical
step in the establishment of infection by several Gram
negative pathogens [12][13] as well as in Gram positive
bacteria like corynebacteria [14] and Actinomyces[8]. In
Enterococcus faecalis, pili are needed for biofilm production and non-piliated mutants are dramatically attenuated in an endocarditis model [9]. Furthermore, the
presence of pili in streptococci was demonstrated to stimulate the host inflammatory response [13]. Recently,
the mucosal adhesion features of the human intestinal
bacterium, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG were demonstrated to be due to the SpaCBA and SpaFED pilin subunits encoded by this organism [11].
Bifidobacteria are the most numerous bacterial members of the gut microbiota of infants [15,16]. They have
been claimed to elicit several health-promoting or probiotic effects, such as strengthening of the intestinal barrier, modulation of the immune response and exclusion
of pathogens [17,18]. Although there is some evidence
to support each of these functional claims for particular
bifidobacterial strains, the molecular mechanisms by
which these activities are achieved remain largely
unknown. Genome sequencing efforts have started to
highlight the genetic strategies followed by bifidobacteria
in order to colonize the human gut [19-23]. In a recent
study, we discovered that the genome of Bifidobacterium
bifidum PRL2010 harbors a large gene set involved in
the utilization of host-derived glycans, such as those
found in the outermost layer of the intestinal mucosa
[24]. These findings therefore represent a clear example
of host-microbe co-evolution, and presented B. bifidum
PRL2010 as a bifidobacterial prototype for the analysis
of the interaction between microbes and the intestinal
mucosa.
The current study provides the first morphological
evidence of pili-like structures decorating the cell surface of various bifidobacterial species. It further investigates the genetic organization and transcriptional
profiling of the presumed bifidobacterial pilus encodinggene clusters in response to different growth substrates.

Material and methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions

Bifidobacterial cultures were incubated in an anaerobic
atmosphere (2.99 % H2, 17.01 % CO2 and 80 % N2) in a
chamber (Concept 400, Ruskin) in the Man-RogosaSharp (MRS) (Scharlau Chemie, Barcelona, Spain) supplemented with 0.05 % (w/v) L-cysteine hydrochloride

Page 2 of 13

and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. Bifidobacterial cells
were also cultivated on MRS where glucose was replaced
with 2% (w/v) of an alternative carbon source (lactose,
Fructo Oligosaccharides [FOS], mucin or N-acetyl
glucosamine).
Sample preparation and AFM imaging

Bacteria from four ml of a bacterial culture were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm and resuspended
in 200 µl of PBS (or 20 mM Hepes 7.5, 1 mM EDTA).
200 µl of 5% glutaraldehyde was added, followed by gentle mixing and incubation for 1 minute at room temperature. Thereafter, bacteria were washed four times
with PBS by repeated resuspension and collection by
centrifugation (4000 rpm). The washed pellet was then
resuspended in 200 µl of PBS and kept on ice until
AFM imaging.
To facilitate adhesion of bacteria to the mica support
used for AFM imaging, mica was coated with polylysine
(PL) as follows: 10 µl of a polylysine solution (10 ng/ml)
was deposited onto freshly-cleaved mica for one minute.
Mica was then rinsed with milliQ water (Millipore) and
dried with nitrogen. After this, 20 µl of bacterial suspension was deposited onto PL-coated mica for 2-5 minutes
depending on the particular strain or specific cultivation
conditions. The mica disk was then rinsed with milliQ
water and dried under a weak gas flow of nitrogen.
Quality of the sample and density of surface-bound bacteria were verified with an optical microscope.
AFM imaging was performed on dried samples with a
Nanoscope III microscope (Digital Instruments)
equipped with scanner J and operating in tapping mode.
Commercial diving board silicon cantilevers (MikroMasch) were used. Best image quality was obtained with
high driving amplitude (1-3V) and low scan rate (0.5
Hz). Filamentous structures at the periphery of bacteria
were visible in images of 512 x 512 pixels, representing
a scansize of 10 µm or less. While imaging both height
and amplitude signals were collected. Height images
were flattened using Gwyddion software.
Phylogenetic analyses

Genomic survey of the pili-encoding genes were performed by BLAST analysis against the NCBI database of
the bifidobacterial FimA/P (cutoff: E-value 1 x 10-4 and
30% identity over at least 80% of both protein
sequences).
Phylogeny calculations, including distance calculations
and the generation of phylogenetic trees, were performed using PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package)
[25] version 3.5c. Trees were calculated using the neighbour-joining method under Kimura’s two-parameter
substitution model [26]. Bootstrap values were computed by performing 1000 re-samplings. Dendograms

from gene sequences were drawn using the ClustalW
program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.
html) and were visualized with the TreeView program
(http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html).
3D structure prediction of pilin major subunit

The 3D structures of pilin major subunits encoded by
the so-called pil loci of B. bifidum PRL2010
(BBPR_1707, BBPR_1801 and BBPR_0283) were predicted using the fold recognition method. Taking the
structure prediction of BBPR_1707 as an example, the
structure prediction procedures are briefly described as
follows. To obtain the structure template, we first submitted the sequence of BBPR_1707 to the protein structure prediction metaserver (http://meta.bioinfo.pl/
submit_wizard.pl), which integrated a series of wellestablished fold recognition methods. Using the top hit
ranked by the metaserver, the Corynebacterium
diphtheriae major pilin subunit (SpaA; PDB code: 3HR6;
X-ray resolution: 1.6 Å) was chosen as the structure
template, which was based on the fold recognition result
of the FFAS algorithm [27]. Then, the corresponding
sequence alignment between BBPR_1707 and 3HR6 was
also obtained from the FFAS algorithm. Finally, the 3D
model of BBPR_1707 was generated and refined by the
SCWRL program [28]. Similarly, the structures of
BBPR_1801 and BBPR_0283 were predicted based on
the same template used for BBPR_1707.
RNA isolation

Total RNA was isolated using the methods described
previously [29]. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in
1 ml of QUIAZOL (Quiagen, UK) and placed in a tube
containing 0.8 g of glass beads (diameter, 106 μm;
Sigma). The cells were lysed by shaking the mix on a
BioSpec homogenizer at 4°C for 2 min (maximum setting). The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm
for 15 min, and the upper phase containing the RNAcontaining sample was recovered. The RNA sample was
further purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation according to an established method [30].
Reverse transcription -PCR analysis

Five micrograms of mRNA was treated with DNase
(Roche, United Kingdom) and used as template in a 100
μl reaction mixture containing 20 ng of random primers, each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of 0.125 mM, and Superscript enzyme
(Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom) used according
the manufacturer’s instructions to produce cDNA. The
cDNA generated was then used as a template for reverse
transcription (RT)-PCRs to determine the arrangement
of the transcript encompassing the pil loci of B. bifidum
PRL2010 using the primers listed in Additional file 1.

Page 3 of 13

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)

qRT-PCR primers (Additional file 2) were used to
amplify the genes encompassing the pil loci as indicated
in Figure 1, and the reference genes atpD, tufA, rpoB
and ldh. Criteria for primer design were based on a
desired melting temperature ™ values between 58 and
60°C and amplicon size of approximately 100 base pairs.
qRT-PCR was performed using the CFX96 system
(BioRad, CA, USA), fold change was evaluated through
the estimation of the CT values with the aid of the
CFX96 software (BioRad, CA, USA). PCR products were
detected with SYBR Green fluorescent dye and amplified
according to the following protocol: one cycle of 95°C
for 3 minutes, followed by 39 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and
60°C for 20 s. Melting curve: 65°C to 95°C with increments of 0.5°C/s.
Each PCR reaction mix contained the following: 12.5 μl
2x SYBR SuperMix Green (BioRad, CA, USA), 1 μl of
cDNA dilution, each of the forward and reverse primers
at 0.5 µM and nuclease-free water was added to obtain
a final volume of 20 μl. In each run, negative controls
(no cDNA) for each primer set were included.
Fold change was calculated using the CFX96 software
(BioRad

Results and discussion
Cell morphology and pili structures

The cell surface of bifidobacterial cells belonging to different species spanning a variety of ecological origins
(Table 1) was analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM). Bacterial cells were cultivated on various carbon
sources, including simple carbohydrates, i.e. glucose and
lactose, as well as more complex sugars such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), representing those that are
expected to be present in the human gut [31]. Such analyses revealed the presence of pilus-like structures on
the cell surfaces of various bifidobacteria (Fig. 1). Interestingly, in a couple of cases, such as B. bifidum
PRL2010 the cell surface was shown to be densely
piliated with the majority of pili located at cell-polar
position. In contrast, under the conditions examined
pilus-like structures were shown to be rare if at all present in B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC15696 (Fig. 1).
When we investigated the production of pilus-like structures in several bifidobacteria propagated under various
culture conditions, i.e., growth on different carbon
sources, by AFM, we observed differential behavior
among the strain/species tested (Fig. 1). Notably, in the
case of B. bifidum PRL2010 cultivation in MRS medium
supplemented with FOS caused a high production of
pilus-like structures (Fig. 1), which were often seen as
polar tufts. In contrast, a different response, i.e., a less
abundant production of pili, to FOS cultivation was
noticed on the cell surface of B. dentium Bd1. The

observed differential phenotypes of B. bifidum PRL2010
versus B. dentium Bd1 may be linked to the different
ecological niches occupied by these micro organisms,
represented by the human intestine and oral cavity,
respectively.
The observed sizes of these identified pilus-like structures appeared to be highly variable among the different
bifidobacterial species analysed, as well as within the
same cell. In particular the length of the filaments was
ranging from 100 nm to several micrometers, the width
from 10 to 30 nm and the height from 0.5 to 2 nm
(Additional file 3). Although the width and the height of
these biological structures are affected by the AFM tip
size and compression, these measurements indicate the
existence of a variable number of pilus-types within the
genus Bifidobacterium.
Sequence analysis of bifidobacterial pili-loci

As previously described [1,32,33] pilus-encoding gene
clusters in genomes of Gram positive bacteria consist of
one to three genes specifying pilus subunits and an associated sortase-encoding gene and can thus be identified
based on sequence similarities. Recently, the genome
sequences of B. dentium Bd1, B. longum subsp. infantis
ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum
NCC2705,Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum
DJO10A,
Bifidobacterium
bifidum
PRL2010,

Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC15703, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSM10140 genomes
[19-24] have become available for such purposes.
Screening for pilin subunit- and sortase-encoding genes
in these genomes revealed the presence of putative pilus
gene clusters in all of these genomes with the exception
of B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 (Fig. 2). These
putative pilus genetic loci occupy various genomic positions (name designations and genome positions are indicated in Figure 2). Notably, the largest number of pilus
gene clusters was identified in the genome of B. dentium
Bd1, which suggests that this microorganism possesses
expanded capabilities to adapt to different ecological
environments (e.g., oral cavity as well as intestine and
fecal material).
The typical predicted pilus gene cluster identified in
these bifidobacterial genomes encompasses genes encoding a major pilin subunit (similar to FimA or FimP) and
one or two ancillary minor pilin subunits (similar to
FimB and FimQ), which were identified on the basis of
amino acid identity with pilin sununits identified in
other Gram positive bacteria such as Actinomyces spp.
and streptoccocae. Furthermore, the sequences of the
predicted fimAB, fimPQ gene products contained the
anticipated consensus motifs and domains characteristic
of a pilin primary structure, including a Sec-dependent
secretion signal, the sortase recognition site (CWSS

motif), the pilin-like motif (TVXXK) and the E box
(Table 2) [1,3]. Interestingly, all the identified bifidobacterial pilus gene clusters are flanked by transposon elements, indicative of their acquisition by horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) (Fig. 2 and see below).
Notably, in the genome of PRL2010 the ORF1822,
encoding a putative FimB, appears to be a pseudogene
due to a frame-shift within a stretch of nine guanine
residues. However, it is possible that transcriptional slippage along the guanine residues allows expression of
this fimbrial subunit under certain environmental conditions [34].
Structural investigation of pili-like proteins encoded by
bifidobacteria

In order to corroborate these findings a structural investigation of B. bifidum PRL2010 major subunits encoded
by the three pil loci present in its genome, was performed. The 3D structures of major pilin subunits
(BBPR_1707, BBPR_1821 and BBPR_0283) were predicted based on the Corynebacterium diphtheriae major
pilin subunit (SpaA, PDB code: 3HR6; X-ray resolution:
1.6 Å) through the FFAS03 program [27]. Similar to the
3D structure of 3HR6 [35], the predicted 3D model also
comprises three tandem Ig-like domains. The 3D models of BBPR_1707, BBPR_1821 and BBPR_0283 cover
residues of their original sequences from 36-487, 89-470
and 143-467, respectively (Fig. 3). Although the overall
protein sequence identity between the three major pili
subunits and 3HR6 is only in a range of 22–25 %, the
results from fold recognition revealed that the predicted
structures of the three major pilin subunits are similar
to the 3D structure of 3HR6, which contains three tandem Ig-like domains [35].
In addition, in order to model the general structure of
the three major bifidobacterial pilin subunits, the predicted 3D models allow the spatial location of some
important functional motifs. As reported previously, the
threonine-glycine bond within the LPXTG motif (CWSS
motif), which is located at the C-terminal of pilin subunit, is recognized and cleaved by a dedicated sortase.
Following this cleavage, the inter-molecular covalent
linkage between the threonine of the cleaved LPXTG
motif in one pilin subunit and a conserved lysine present within the pilin motif of its neighboring pilin subunit leads to fiber assembly by covalent linkages [36].
Additionally, the glutamic acid within the E-box of the
major subunit has been reported to be involved in the
incorporation of the minor subunit into the pilus fiber.
Based on the predicted 3D models, the corresponding
pilin motifs as well as the conserved lysines in the three
major pilin subunits can be annotated (Fig. 3). Moreover, the E-box motifs in these three major pilin subunits were also identified (Fig. 3).

Figure 3 Structural representation of the major pilin subunits of B.
bifidum PRL2010. BBPR_1707, BBPR_1821 and BBPR_0283 are
colored in cyan, green and yellow, respectively. The pilin motifs
(residues 188-197 in BBPR_1707, 184-191 in BBPR_1821 and 224-231
in BBPR_0283) are highlighted in red. The side chains of the
conserved lysines in these three pilin motifs (K197 in BBPR_1707,
K191 in BBPR_1821 and K231 in BBPR_0283) are shown as sticks and
balls. The E-box motif in each model is colored in black (residues
445-456 in BBPR_1707, 428-439 in BBPR_1821 and 438-449 in
BBPR_0283).

Polymerization of the pilin subunits is catalysed by an
enzyme with homology to sortases [37]. Notably, all the
detected pili genetic loci encompass a sortase encoding
gene (strA) belonging to the class C family (Fig. 2).
Furthermore, genome analyses revealed the presence of
a variable number of additional sortases belonging to
the housekeeping sortases, also referred as the class A
(data not shown). The class A sortases are usually
encoded by genes whose chromosomal locations are
unlinked to the genes that encode their specific surface
protein substrates [38]. These housekeeping sortases
might exert an accessory role in the assembly of pili in
bifidobacteria, similar to their role in C. diphtheriae,
where housekeeping sortases are required for the correct
covalent attachment of the major pilin subunits to the
cell wall [38].
Phylogenetic analyses of bifidobacterial pilus-associated
genes

It has been previously shown that pilus-encoding genes
in other microorganisms such as corynebacteria have
been acquired through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)
events [7,39]. We therefore investigated if this may also
have been the case for the pilus-encoding genes of bifidobacteria.. In order to assess the distribution of fimA/P

homologs across bacteria we surveyed currently available
genomic data, representing members of Actinobacteria,
Firmicutes and various Gram negative bacteria (Additional file 4) for the presence of genes specifying predicted major pilus subunits. This analysis revealed that
predicted FimA/P-encoding genes are not uniformly
present in all bacteria studied to date (data not shown).
The distribution of fimA/P homologs might be a consequence of the organism’s development following a vertical- or horizontal- evolution mechanism. Alignment of
the presumed FimA/P-encoding genes was performed
using ClustalW and resulted in a rooted neighbour joining phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4). Notably, bifidobacterial
FimA/P does form a monophyletic group with other
high G+C Gram positive bacteria such as Actinomyces
spp., as well as with the FimA/P sequences of Firmicutes
(Fig. 4). Furthermore, bifidobacterial FimA/P sequences
cluster together with homologs sequences from Gram
negative bacteria such as Bacteroidetes spp. (Fig. 4).
These phylogenetic inconsistencies based on FimA/P
sequences, can be explained by assuming that the bifidobacterial FimA/P-encoding genes, similar to fimA/P
genes from other high G+C Gram positive, were
acquired through HGT events. Other findings that support this hypothesis are the deviating G+C% content of
the bifidobacterial fimA/P genes compared to the average G+C% content of their genome [e.g. between 5 %
lower (in case of B. longum subsp. longum DJO10A) to
9 % higher (in the case of B. bifidum PRL2010 pil1)
than the G+C average value], as well as by the different
codon usage bias for the predicted FimA/P proteins
(results not shown).
Transcriptional analysis of bifidobacterial pili loci

In order to determine if the genes encompassing the pili
loci detected in bifidobacteria are differentially transcribed upon exposure to different growth substrates
simulating those which may be encountered by bifidobacteria in their natural ecological niche, the amount of
predicted pilin gene-specific mRNAs was determined by
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Such
experiments were performed using mRNA samples
extracted from exponentially grown cultures of B.
longum subsp. longum DJ010A, B. bifidum PRL2010, B.
animalis subsp. lactis DSM10140, B. adolescentis
ATCC15703 and B. dentium Bd1, which had been
resuspended in pre-warmed MRS medium containing
one of a varied set of growth substrates [lactose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), bovine milk, N-acetyl glucosamine and mucin]. The observed induction level of putative pilus subunit/pilin- or sortase-encoding genes in
response to these growth substrates was shown to be
variable between the different bifidobacterial species and
highly variable between different pilus gene clusters

harboured by the same organism (Fig. 5). In B. adolescentis ATCC15703 growth on any of these carbohydrate
substrates produced an increase of pilin/sortase gene
transcription relative to glucose, with the highest level
of transcription observed when this strain was cultivated
on bovine milk, FOS, or N-acetyl glucosamine (Fig. 5).
In contrast, in another intestinal bifidobacterial strain, B.
bifidum PRL2010, transcription of the putative pilin/sortase-encoding genes was significantly increased relative
to glucose-based growth upon cultivation in bovine milk
or FOS (Fig. 5). Conversely, the level of pilin-encompassing mRNA of B. dentium Bd1, as well as B. animalis
subsp. lactis DSM10140 did not change significantly
when this strain was cultivated on any of these substrates (Fig. 5). However, the expression level of pilusencoding genes in B. dentium Bd1 and B. animalis
subsp. lactis DSM10140 changes significantly when such
microorganisms were cultivated in the presence of
lactose.
The observed differential transcription patterns of the
predicted pilus-encoding genes in these bifidobacterial
species, i.e., B. bifidum, B. animalis subsp. lactis, B. adolescentis and B. dentium, may be linked to the specific
ecological niche that each of these bacteria occupy
(intestine vs. oral cavity as in the case of B. adolescentis,
B. bifidum vs. B. dentium, or different niches within the
colon, i.e. human intestine vs. animal intestine, such as
in the case of B. bifidum, B. adolescentis vs. B. animalis
subsp. lactis) [15] and thus may be pivotal for their specific colonization strategy. The different pilus gene clusters carried by the genome of a single microorganism (e.
g., the pil1, pil2 and pil3 of B. bifidum PRL2010) appear
to undergo varying levels of transcriptional induction in
response to a particular carbohydrate (Fig. 5), which
may be explained by the existence of alternative genetic
strategies for bacterial colonization and/or microbemicrobe interactions evolved by a specific bifidobacterial
strain, similar to what was previously described for Actinomyces[8,40]. Furthermore, such findings suggest that
these pili promote adhesion to different molecules (e.g.,
mucin, epithelial cells, enamel).
Operon organization of the pilus-gene clusters in
bifidobacteria

The genetic organization of the pili gene clusters identified in the individual genomes of investigated bifidobacterial species suggests that the pilus subunit-encoding
genes and the adjacent sortase-specifying gene in each
cluster are co-transcribed. To examine this further, we
selected the pilus-encoding gene clusters identified in
the genome of B. bifidum PRL2010 for transcriptional
analysis using RT-PCR experiments. cDNA templates
were obtained by RT of total B. bifidum PRL2010
mRNAs, isolated from stationary growth stage cells that

had been cultivated on bovine milk and/or FOS. Each
cDNA sample was used as template in various PCR
reactions that targeted various parts of the pilus-encoding gene cluster and flanking genes through the use of

different combinations of primer pairs (Fig. 6). Notably,
amplicons of the expected size were achieved using the
internal PCR primer pairs spanning the pilin subunits
genes (fimA/P and fimB/Q). In contrast, no PCR

animalis subsp. lactis DSM10140 upon cultivation in MRS supplemented with various carbon sources (lactose, FOS, N-acetylglucosamine, mucin),
or bovine milk, versus growth in MRS supplemented with glucose as unique carbon source as analysed by quantitative real-time PCR assays. The
histograms indicate the relative amounts of the pilin/sortase mRNAs for the specific samples. In each panel, the ORF numbering indicates the
gene code according to Figure 1. The values on the y-axes as well as the value (between brackets) represent the fold fold change relative to
reference genes as indicated in the materials and method section. For B. dentium Bd1 qRT-PCR experiments were performed only on those piliencoding loci, i.e., pil2, pil5 and pil6, which display a typical gene constellation of the pilus locus (see Figure 2).

products were obtained, when PCR primers were used
that targeted the amplification of the intergenic region
between the strA and the pilin-encoding genes (Fig. 6).
When the same strategy was employed to investigate
the co-transcription of the pilus gene locus with the
other flanking genes, no RT-PCR products were
obtained. Therefore, these data indicate that the genes
encompassing the fimA/P, fimB/Q loci produce a single
polycistronic mRNA transcript and are thus organized
in an operon, a characteristic of known pilus gene clusters [9,41]. Such findings are also corroborated by the
evaluation of the change of mRNA levels of the different
genes encompassing the pili-loci obtained by qRT-PCR
analysis (Fig.5). Notably, the sortase-encoding gene displayed a different level of induction compared to its
neighbouring fimA/B/P/Q gene, while in the case where

no induction was noticed for these latter genes, the sortase gene sometimes displayed the opposite behaviour
(e.g., in the case of the pilus-operon of B. animalis
subsp. lactis DSM10140).
Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the pili loci
revealed that the gene clusters were flanked at their 3’
end by an inverted repeat (ΔG values ranging from
-22.4 to 34.1 Kcal) that is expected to function as a rhoindependent transcriptional terminator structure (Fig.
6), whereas no such sequences were found between the
genes of the presumed pilus subunit-encoding genes.

Conclusions
Although pili are described in both Gram negative and
Gram positive bacteria, very little is so far known about
the presence of these extracellular structures in

25-27, 38-40). The positions of the primer pairs used in RT-PCR experiments are shown in panels a-c. Products of the PCR were derived under
the following conditions: cDNA prepared from B. bifidum PRL2010 RNA cultivated on MRS supplemented with bovine milk and/or FOS (lanes 1,
4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 29, 32, 35, 38). A positive control control B. bifidum PRL2010 DNA (lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 30, 33, 36, 39). A
negative control in which B. bifidum PRL2010 RNA was used but reverse transcriptase was omitted (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 31, 34, 37,
40). Lanes MK contained DNA molecular marker 1kb

bifidobacteria [15,42]. In this study we provide for the
first time visual evidence of the existence of pilus-like
structures on the surface of bifidobacterial cells belonging to different species (B. bifidum, B. dentium, B.
longum subsp. longum, B. adolescentis and B. animalis
subsp. lactis). However, the function of pili in bifidobacteria remains still to be elucidated. In close related
organisms, such as C. diphtheriae and Actinomyces spp.
pilus fibres are important for bacterial adherence to specific host cells, including epithelial cells, erythrocytes
and polymorphonuclear leukocytes [5,14] or for the
binding of Actinomyces to oral streptococci [43,44]; a

scenario which is also found for human gut commensals
such as lactobacilli [10,11], therefore suggesting that the
adhesive function played by pili in bacteria represents a
conserved functional role of these structures.
The past few years have seen dramatic advances in
our knowledge on the genetics of probiotic bacteria
such as bifidobacteria through genome sequencing of a
large number of strains [19-24]. However, the mechanisms based on which such commensals recognize and
interact with the human host are still unclear. The
identification of possible receptors recognized by pili
and the function of these receptors in signaling and

Foroni et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S16
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S16

host defense mechanisms might provide new insights
into the molecular mechanisms of microbe-host interactions. In this study we have shown how the expression of the genes encompassing the putative pilusencoding loci is largely affected by the different composition of the substrate of cultivation, in particular
with respect the presence of host-derived products (e.
g., mucin or milk). It has been demonstrated that the
corynebacterial minor pilin subunits (SpaC and SpaF)
plays a pivotal role as receptor in adhesion of the pili
to epithelial cells [14]. Considering that many known
adhesive receptors in human cells are represented by
carbohydrates [45], it is possible that the presence of
specific glycans might trigger the expression of pilinencoding genes. Bifidobacterial strains that were
derived from a different ecological origin (e.g., oral vs.
intestinal or human vs. animal) display very different
transcription induction patterns of the presumptive
pilus-gene clusters upon exposure to glycans, which
might be a consequence of the fact that these bifidobacteria are adapted to different ecological niches,
where the glycan composition is diverse. Furthermore,
the identification of pilus-resembling structures decorating the cell surfaces of bifidobacteria whose genomes do not appear to specify sortase-dependent pili,
such as B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697, might
suggest the existence of additional types of pilus-like
structures in bifidobacteria.
At this point we cannot conclusively state that the
observed pilus-like surface appendages are encoded by
the clusters of genes described in this study. However,
recent investigations about the extracellular proteome of
B. animalis subsp. lactis lead to identification of pilin
subunits, which correspond to the B. animalis subsp.
lactis pilus-encoding gene cluster (BLAC_1486BLAC_1484) described in this study [46].
Most bifidobacteria are poorly, if at all, genetically
accessible, and therefore it is currently not feasible to
perform those experiments needed to confirm the link
between the observed pilus structures and their suspected genetic determinants. Future functional genomics
investigations directed to the silencing or mutagenesis
of the pilus-encoding genes as well as immuno-EM
experiments involving antibodies targeting the different
pilin subunit will allow an in depth characterization of
the genetics of the pilus-like surface appendages displayed by bifidobacteria.
In addition, further studies will be necessary to evaluate the binding activities of these identified pili and to
explore how the various pilus-encoding gene clusters
from a single microorganism might be expressed in
response to colonization of diverse ecological niches
and/or exposure to a different microbiota.
