Abstract
Background: Human Rhinoviruses (HRVs) are well recognized viral pathogens associated with acute respiratory
tract illnesses (RTIs) abundant worldwide. Although recent studies have phylogenetically identified the new HRV
species (HRV-C), data on molecular epidemiology, genetic diversity, and clinical manifestation have been limited.
Result: To gain new insight into HRV genetic diversity, we determined the complete coding sequences of putative
new members of HRV species C (HRV-CU072 with 1% prevalence) and HRV-B (HRV-CU211) identified from clinical
specimens collected from pediatric patients diagnosed with a symptom of acute lower RTI. Complete coding
sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the HRV-CU072 strain shared a recent common ancestor with
most closely related Chinese strain (N4). Comparative analysis at the protein level showed that HRV-CU072 might
accumulate substitutional mutations in structural proteins, as well as nonstructural proteins 3C and 3 D.
Comparative analysis of all available HRVs and HEVs indicated that HRV-C contains a relatively high G+C content
and is more closely related to HEV-D. This might be correlated to their replication and capability to adapt to the
high temperature environment of the human lower respiratory tract. We herein report an infrequently occurring
intra-species recombination event in HRV-B species (HRV-CU211) with a crossing over having taken place at the
boundary of VP2 and VP3 genes. Moreover, we observed phylogenetic compatibility in all HRV species and suggest
that dynamic mechanisms for HRV evolution seem to be related to recombination events. These findings indicated
that the elementary units shaping the genetic diversity of HRV-C could be found in the nonstructural 2A and 3D
genes.
Conclusion: This study provides information for understanding HRV genetic diversity and insight into the role of
selection pressure and recombination mechanisms influencing HRV evolution.

Introduction
Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are one of the most highly
prevalent ethological agents of acute respiratory tract illness (RTI) and, among other factors, contribute to children’s hospitalization and morbidity. The clinical
manifestations associated with HRV infection are predominantly asymptomatic or self-limited upper RTIs with
a short incubation period of 1 to 3 days, similar to a
common cold or influenza-like illnesses. Several studies
have recently reported that HRV infection in children

can also be associated with numerous clinical illnesses,
contributing to acute exacerbations and inflammatory
respiratory diseases. Among these are acute communityacquired sinusitis [1,2], community-acquired pneumonia
[3,4], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [5-7], bronchiolitis [8,9], wheezing [10-12], and
asthma exacerbation [13-15]. However, the association
of HRV infection with exacerbation and the pathogenic
mechanisms by which HRVs directly influence more
severe RTIs are not well established.
HRVs are small, non-enveloped viruses of 30 nm diameter classified in the genus Enterovirus of the diverse
family Picornaviridae. The highly structured icosahedral
capsid contains a single-stranded RNA genome of

positive polarity approximately 7,200 base pairs (bp) in
length. Similar to their close relative, human enterovirus
(HEV), the coding sequences comprise 4 structural
genes, VP1-VP4, and 7 non-structural genes. These
non-structural genes are translated in the cytoplasm of
the infected cell to produce a single polyprotein precursor of approximately 2,200 amino acid residues, and are
immediately cleaved upon synthesis of virus encoded
protease. HRVs can replicate in airway epithelial cells of
both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Acid intolerance prevents HRV replication in the gastrointestinal
tract and thus differentiates them from other
enteroviruses.
HRVs display genetic and antigenic variability. Hence,
based on immunology they have been historically classified into 99 reference serotypes correlated with serological neutralization activity. HRVs can also be categorized
by several parameters, including receptor specificity
(ICAM-1 and LDL-R) and antiviral drug susceptibility.
Recent molecular techniques have applied bioinformatics methods to analyze their evolutionary relationships based on sequence compatibility of 5’UTR or
partial capsid genes. Capsid genes commonly focused on
include the VP1 region, which has been reported to be
an essential part of the viral neutralization antigenic
determinant to evade the host’s immune response and is
utilized as a binding site of synthetic antiviral compounds [16-19], or the VP4 or VP4/2 genes. Based on
these techniques, all reference serotypes have been
divided into 3 species, comprising 2 previously defined
species, HRV-A (n = 74), and HRV-B (n = 25) [18], and
the new species HRV-C (33 types proposed based on
VP1 gene) [20-23].
Recently, several epidemiological studies based on
PCR amplification have reported that HRV-C was more
predominantly found in pediatric patients hospitalized
with acute lower RTI [21,24,25] as compared to other
HRVs. HRV-C has thus been proposed as an etiological
agent associated with recurrent wheezing [11,26] and
asthma exacerbation [13-15,26] which might not be susceptible to appropriate antibiotic treatment. However,
the inability to grow HRV-C in tissue culture has limited the understanding of their pathogenicity and the
mechanisms of host immune response to HRV-C
infection.
As part of the retrospective epidemiological exploration of common respiratory viruses in Thailand during
February 2006-2007, a total of 87 nasopharyngeal (NP)
suction specimens from 289 samples were found
infected with HRV. Phylogenetic classification established the high diversity of HRV and predominance of
species C in Thailand [24]. To further explore the
genetic characteristics, clinical impact, and evolutionary
divergence of HRV species, we have extended our

previous research by characterizing the full-length coding sequence of the 6 representative HRV strains circulating in Thailand and report the discovery of putative
new HRV-C and HRV-B strains. Moreover, we have
comparatively analyzed all HRV prototypes in order to
elucidate the occurrence of recombination in each of
the HRV species.

Methods
HRV positive specimens and viral nucleic acid preparation

The NP suction specimens were collected from pediatric
patients hospitalized at King Chulalongkorn Memorial
Hospital, Thailand between February 2006 and 2007.
Admission criteria of the study population were based
on clinical presentations combined with other laboratory
results as described in previous reports. RNA was
extracted from stored samples and then cDNA was
synthesized as described elsewhere [24].
PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing

Primer sets for HRV entire coding sequence amplifications were designed based on each species’ specific
nucleotide sequence available at the GenBank database
(primer sequences upon request). The sequences of the
genome termini were arrived at by a specific PCR technique developed from a modified 3’RACE method [27].
All purified PCR products were bidirectionally
sequenced with the 2 primers used in the second round
of semi-nested PCR provided by First BASE Laboratories Sdn Bhd (Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia).
Complete coding sequence analyses

Sequences were prepared and aligned using Clustal W
implemented in the BioEdit program version 7.0.4.1
http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html. A Pairwise Sequence similarity plot was calculated and
depicted using SimPlot software [28] with Jukes-Cantor
parameter, window size of 400 bp and a step size of
20 bp. To examine the picornaviral protease cleavage
sites (2Apro, 3Cpro, autocatalytic sites), sequences were
sought using the Net-PicoRNA 1.0 server [29]. Consensus cis-acting replication element (cre) sequences of the
selected alignment regions were evaluated using the
RNAalifold [30] and MFold server [31].
Phylogenetic analyses

To determine the phylogenetic relationship between
HRV complete coding sequences and their polyprotein,
the phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the
neighbor-joining method with Kimura’s two-parameter
substitution model. Data was bootstrap re-sampled
1,000 times for nodal confidence value determination
implemented in the MEGA version 4.0 program package
[32].

Phylogenetic compatibility matrix

Results

Phylogenetic compatibility matrix (PCM) analysis is a
computational method used to investigate the phylogenetic relationship of the sequences to be analyzed. The
PCM plot of nucleotide sequence alignment in intraand inter-HRV species was constructed by using the
program TreeOrderScan in the Simmonic 2007 version
1.6 [33]. All published HRV reference nucleotide
sequences of each species including 75 HRV-A, 25
HRV-B, 9 HRV-C, and our 6 identified strains were
aligned and computed separately between and within
species using the programs SEQBOOT, DNADIST,
NEIGHBOR-JOINING and PHYLIP with the following
program setting: 250 bp fragment length, 100-bp increments, 100 fold resampling with 70% bootstrap threshold value that subsequently generated 65 aligned
fragments of HRV-A and HRV-B while HRV-C was generated from 64 overlapping fragments.

Complete coding sequence analysis

Recombination analysis

Potential recombination events within the coding
regions were assessed using phylogenetic analysis based
on the various viral genome parts with high recombination rate. To confirm an accurate recombination event,
the complete coding sequences were analyzed in comparison with all known reference sequences by using the
Recombination Detection Program 3Beta41 [34]. Manual
Bootscanning was performed by using Jukes-Cantor
algorithm and neighbor-joining method [27,35,36] with
a parameter setting of 200 bp window size, 10 bp step
size and 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
G+C content analysis

To analyze the G+C content of the full-length coding
sequences of each HRV species, a total of 20 HRV-A, 25
HRV-B, and all HRV-C coding sequences available at
the GenBank database were selected. Three representatives of each HEV species as well as 3 distinct Polioviruses were chosen from the database under the
following accession numbers: HEV-A (DQ452074,
AY421760, and AY421769), HEV-B (AF241359,
AF081485, and AF029859), HEV-C (NC_001428,
AF499640, and AF499635), HEV-D (NC_001430,
EF107098, and DQ201177), and Polioviruses (V01150,
X00595, and X00925). The GC percent composition was
directly compared within the viral reading frame and
plotted with standard deviation using online software
including CpG ratio/GC content http://mwsross.bms.ed.
ac.uk/public/cgi-bin/cpg.pl and GC content/GC skew
diagrams http://nbc11.biologie.unikl.de/framed/left/
menu/auto/right/GC/ with a parameter setting of 500
bp sliding window and 10 bp increment size between
successive windows.

The entire coding sequences of the 6 additional HRV
strains elucidated in this study have been submitted to
the GenBank database and assigned accession numbers
HQ123440-HQ123445. Nucleotide and deduced amino
acid sequence analysis revealed considerably different
phylogenetic clustering features of the strains HRVCU072 (HQ123440) and HRV-CU211 (HQ123444) as
showed in Figure 1. The strain HRV-CU072 displayed
relatively low pairwise sequence identity compared with
other HRV-Cs (66%) (Figure 2). Furthermore, scanning
bootstrap analysis supported our finding that the strain
HRV-CU211 is a putative new HRV strain derived from
intra-species recombination of HRV-B (Figure 3).
The HRV-CU072 coding sequence spanned 6,450 nt
region rich in A and U bases and encoded a 2,149 aa
polyprotein. Similar to other HRV-C members, HRVCU072 had a relatively small polyprotein gene due to a
deletion in the major part of the antigen neutralization
site covering the BC, DE, and HI loops of the VP1 protein and shared 50% and 45% amino acid sequence identity with HRV-A and HRV-B, respectively. Direct
investigation of the VP1 gene revealed that HRV-CU072
shared only 64% sequence identity with the other HRV-Cs.
HRV-CU072 coding sequence analysis

To investigate the molecular characteristics of the putative new HRV-C strain, we performed comparative analysis of the HRV-CU072 complete coding sequence with
all available HRV references and the representative
members of different HEV species. An alignment of
deduced amino acid sequences was generated allowing
for the 10 hypothetical cleavage sites of the HRVCU072 polyprotein (Table 1). In addition, half of all
cleavage sites of the HRV-CU072 strain’s conserved
amino acid residues were commonly found in HRV
members while some cleavage site features, such as an
identical M/S pair in the autocatalytic cleavage site
between the structural proteins VP4 and VP2, were also
found in HRV-CU072 and other HRV-Cs. The unique
amino acid sequences of HRV-CU072’s protease cleavage site were observed at the VP3/VP1 site as N/D
residues while other HRV-C members utilized an alternative cleavage Q/N pair similar to HRV-As. However,
amino acid polarity remained unchanged.
Comparison of HRV-CU072’s individual protein products
with other HRV-C members showed that the VP4 protein
was a highly conserved protein among other HRV and
HEV species. Similar with other HRV-C members, HRVCU072 displayed a cis-acting replication element (cre:
R1NNNAAR2NNNNNNR3) as GCUUAAACAAAUUA
located in the VP2 protein different from HRV-As and

region, respectively. The G(P/A)Y(S/T)GxP motif within
the 3B protein (VPg) crucial for phosphodiester linkage formation between the VPg protein and 5’end of viral RNA
was identified in the HRV-CU072 sequence. Furthermore,
at position 4 of this motif, almost all HRV-C members

displayed the unique Thr residue while only strains HRVCU072, C025 (EF582386), N4 (GQ223227), and N10
(GQ223228) shared the conserved Ser residue in common
with HRV-A and HRV-B.

closest relative (China’s strain N4: GQ223227) indicated
that the VP4 and 3A proteins showed the highest overall
sequence identity score (87%) whereas the VP2 protein
represented the least conserved protein among them.
The VP2 region was found to have the largest numbers
of both amino acid sequence variation (31%) and NS
variation (58%) while the 3A region exhibited the lowest
amino acid sequence variation (12%). Even though the
2A protein had less NS variation than the VP2 (41%),
this protein displayed the highest percent NC-NS variation (48%). While the lowest NS score was found in the
2C region (19%), this region had undergone profound
NC-NS evolutionary change (44%) compared to other
regions. Overall, the structural proteins of the HRVCU072 strain, especially in the proteins VP1-3, showed
a high average of NS variability compared to the N4
strain.

LDL-R protein interaction [37] was not found in HRVCU072. An 8-10 amino acid insertion found in HRVCU072’s VP1 sequence represented some characteristics
unique from other HRV members, such as a hydrophilic
amino acid insertion in the GH loop. Furthermore, the
HRV-CU072 strain might be resistant to pleconaril due
to amino acid substitutions in the 2 positions (152 and
191) crucial for identifying naturally resistant serotypes
[38] located in the drug binding pocket identified as
Y52F and V191T.
Comparative analysis of the HRV-CU072 strain with most
closely related strains

To elucidate the genetic relationship between the HRVCU072 strain and other HRV-Cs, an estimated amount
of synonymous (S) and nonsynonymous (NS) variation
at the protein level was investigated (Table 2). In this
analysis, nonsynonymous changes were defined as 2
types of variation: nonconservative (NC-NS) and conservative nonsynonymous (C-NS) variation and were based
on the presence or absence of changes in amino acid
polarity, respectively. Sequence comparison of each individual protein precursor between HRV-CU072 and its

Phylogenetic relationship

To observe changes in phylogenetic relationships, the
PCM plot of nucleotide sequence alignment was performed using the program TreeOrderScan. The PCM
results of each HRV species are summarized in Figure 4.
HRV-As showed the lowest degree of phylogenetic
incompatibility throughout the coding region, which
correlated to a high level of sequence identity. The frequency of recombination in HRV-B and HRV-C was
shown to be higher than HRV-A. HRV-C’s phylogenetic
relationship among species members had altered in the
2A and at the 3’ terminal of 3D coding regions while
the remaining genome regions remained conserved.
Recombination detection in HRVs

In order to determine HRV diversity and evolutionary
characteristics, potential recombination events in the
polyprotein gene were evaluated by comparison with
all available HRV reference sequences. The results
derived from a recombination detection program
combined with similarity plot, bootscanning method
(Figure 3), and phylogenetic relationship (Figure 5)
suggested that the strain HRV-CU211 had arisen subsequent to multiple recombination processes within

the HRV-B lineages. Most of HRV-CU211’s coding
sequence was similar to HRV serotype 35 (major parent: FJ445187) with 84% of pair-wise nucleotide
sequence identity, while part of the capsid coding
VP2 and VP3 regions (positions 766-1590 nt) were
genetically related to serotype 69 (minor parent:
FJ445151).
G+C content

Compared with the closest relative, all HRV species
exhibited a lower percentage of average G+C composition than other enterovirus members (Figure 6). HRV-A
and HRV-B showed a relatively low average G+C content (38% and 39%, respectively) whereas HRV-Cs displayed the highest average value at 43%. HRV-C’s 2A
cysteine-type protease encoding region showed a unique
G+C content more similar to enterovirus composition
than other HRV species. In comparison the other enterovirus species, HEV-A and HEV-B, showed similar GC
content (48%), polioviruses displayed 46%, HEV-C 45%,

and HEV-D exhibited the lowest G+C content at 42%,
closely related to HRV-C.

Discussion
In this study, we have determined the complete coding
sequences and summarized the molecular characteristics of a putative newly identified HRV-C strain.
Furthermore, we have reported a new HRV-B member
derived from intra-species recombination. In the
absence of serological neutralization data of HRV-C,
the HRV-C variants can be classified into 33 genetically-defined types based on divergence thresholds calculated from the distribution of pair-wise sequence
distance. Results obtained from the HRV-CU072 strain
showed it exhibited a low sequence similarity score
(36% sequence divergence) and a distinct evolutionary
phylogenetic relationship to the HRV-C criteria proposed by Simmonds et al. [23]. Several typical enterovirus and rhinovirus sequence characteristics are still
conserved in HRV-CU072, such as potential utilization

of the ICAM-1 protein as its specific receptor and possible resistance to synthetic pleconaril. However, this
strain displayed some unique properties as for example,
it uses a VP3/VP1 (N/D) cleavage site predicted by distinct alignment.
Several studies on rhinovirus, enterovirus and other
picornavirus genera have examined variation across
their genomes [39-41]. In HRV species, the structural
proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 and the nonstructural 3C
and 3D proteins have been identified as diversifying
selective regions that are thought to influence the evolution of HRVs. Although the capsid region is prone to
high NS variability, the HRV-CU072 strain has conserved the essential motifs such as receptor interacting
site and drug binding pocket along with other HRV-C
members.
Our study compared nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution at the protein level of the HRVCU072 strain with its phylogenetically closest relative
(N4 strain) to elucidate the evolution of this newly identified strain. Analysis results suggested that the degree
of sequence variation between them might not

necessarily be ascribed to their genome size. Although
the HRV-CU072 capsid region displayed high NS variation, the essential motifs such as receptor interacting
site and drug binding pocket were conserved as in other
HRV-C members. The VP4 capsid protein showed the
highest sequence identity score compared with others.
Due to its function as an internal surface protein VP4 is
not involved in rhinovirus antigenicity. This might
explain why the VP4 protein is highly conserved and
shares familiar characteristics among the HRVs and
HEVs. The analysis results revealed that the HRVCU072 and N4 strains are descendants of a recent common ancestor via the purifying selection mechanism on
the structural genes. In addition, this could suggest that
the HRV-CU072 strain is not an N4 variant and might
be a putative new HRV-C strain.
Based on our previous epidemiological study of seminested PCR covering the 5’UTR/VP2 region and VP4
phylogenetic classification [24], HRV-CU072 infection
was detected in 3 of 289 NP suction specimens,

viruses. All of these patients had been diagnosed with
acute lower RTI symptoms including pneumonia, acute
bronchiolitis combined with wheezing and asthma
exacerbation. Although the prevalence of the HRVCU072 strain in the Thai population appears to be quite
low, all patients presented with clinical symptoms associated with the development of a hyper-reactive airway
disease. This may raise concern about the potential
impact of this putative novel strain.
Ubiquitous recombination in enteroviruses and other
picornavirus genera such as Aphthovirus and Teschovirus has been well established as an evolutionary driving force [42-46]. Despite its overall genetic similarity to
HRVs, HEV recombination frequently takes place in
either the nonstructural (mostly P2) region, or between
the 5’UTR and adjacent capsid coding region. This
results in a limited set of capsid genes responsible for
HEV serotypes [44,46-48]. Many previous comparative
studies have concluded that recombination in HRVs can
occur throughout their genomes. The sites most favored
for recombination have been frequently reported to
occur in the noncoding and nonstructural regions
[27,39,45,49,50].
In concurrence with the earlier reports, the results
form PCM analysis described in this study also showed
the overall recombination breakpoint of HRV species
can randomly occur throughout the coding sequence.
The PCM results of each HRV species illustrated that
the different HRV species showed different degrees of
phylogenic variation, representing a unique species-specific property. Interestingly, HRV species A exhibited a
high degree of phylogenetic compatibility with each
other within the capsid genes, 2C and nonstructural P3
regions. This indicates that the intra-species recombination processes of HRV-A were probably limited to these
parts of the genome. In addition, all HRV-A members
shared genomic characteristics conserved within the
species and inter-species recombination was probably
limited.
Huang et al., 2009 [36] and McIntype et al., 2010 [51]
have reported that HRV-C showed evidence for interspecies recombination with HRV-A exhibiting 2 precise
recombination hotspots in the 5’UTR and 2A gene. For
the new species, HRV-C, PCM analysis results showed
that sequence variations within HRV-C have been prone
to accumulate in some genomic regions, particularly in
the nonstructural 2A gene, as has been recently reported
[49,51] and probably in the 3D coding gene which might
influence the dynamic process resulting in intra-species
C diversity. From our findings it could be concluded that
the 3D gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is the site favored by HRV-C for recombination.
Only a few reports have indicated recombination in
circulating strains. Recombination has recently been

Page 10 of 12

demonstrated between circulating heterogeneous HRVA and some HRV-C strains. Palmenberg et al. [27]
reported an intra-species recombination in HRV-A
which resulted in the origin of a novel cladeD virus.
Tapparel et al. [52] observed phylogenetic incompatibility in the 5’UTR, VP1 and 3CD regions of 2 HRV-A
strains. Huang et al. [36] have also described HRV-A
intra-species recombination events among 3 field strains
with phylogenetic incongruency in the 5’UTR and VP4/
VP2 regions and 2 HRV-C field strains have arisen from
inter-species recombination with HRV-A. Our study
suggests an infrequent recombination event among
HRV-B lineages (HRV-CU211) identified from an acute
lower RTI patient diagnosed with viral pneumonia with
recombination breakpoints at the boundary of the capsid
encoding VP2 and VP3 genes.
Although recombination events occurring in some
parts of the different RNA genomes have not been
recognized as a major mechanism for HRV evolution or
as crucial for the large diversity of HRV circulating in
humans, this process is still utilized for diversifying genome sequences. Furthermore, the detection of the
recombinant strain in lower RTI patients may raise concern about the correlation between recombination and
change in disease severity.
Studies on base composition in viral genomes can provide molecular information and thus contribute to
understanding the efficient regulation of viral gene
expression, codon usage bias, viral genome stability, and
replication capability. Such information would also be
relevant to elucidate their molecular evolution. Mutation
pressure and composition constraint, particularly in G
+C content, of the viral RNA genome are often considered important evolutionary genomic factors accounting
for variations in codon usage among genes in different
organisms [52-54]. In parallel with the molecular characteristics of HRV and HEV species, the average G+C
content of their genomes has previously been described
as a genomic factor to explain differences in RNA stability, optimal growth temperature, tissue tropism and
also disease pattern.
In enteroviruses, a high G+C content of the viral genome is thought to be an essential factor for HEV’s adaptive capability to replicate in various parts of the human
body including respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract,
and central nervous system [52]. In contrast, the most
closely related HRV species exhibited a lower G+C content than other enterovirus members which might
reflect their adaptation to the lower temperature environment and sensitivity to the gastrointestinal tract’s
acidic pH. In this study, we found similar G+C content
values of HRV-C and HEV-D coding sequences, contrary to the relatively low values in HRV-A and HRV-B
species.

Linsuwanon et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:5
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/5

This may reflect HRV-C’s capability to adapt to the
higher temperature environment of the lower part of
the human respiratory tract and thus differentiate it on
some phenotypic level from other HRV species. This
finding might also support several epidemiological studies on HRV in that HRV-C was more predominantly
found in acute lower RTI cases than HRV-A and HRVB and may significantly contribute to severe respiratory
tract disease development, especially the exacerbation of
asthma and wheezing. However, sequence analyses of
other picornaviruses such as human hepatitis A viruses,
hepatotropic members of the genus Hepatovirus, which
replicate primarily in the gastrointestinal tract and
spread to the liver causing liver failure and jaundice
have shown a much lower G+C content [55]. To further
understand this finding and investigate the mechanisms
of virus-induced asthma exacerbations, HRV-C’s mode
of infection should be further investigated.
Little is known about the association between adaptive
mechanisms and HRV evolution. Our results have provided information on the role of selection pressure and
recombination mechanisms influencing the evolution of
HRV. Further studies should be performed to better
understand the clinical impact of each species on
respiratory disease, epidemiology, their genomic characteristics, and the mechanisms controlling variation and
evolution of this virus.
