The ancient history of the structure of
ribonuclease P and the early origins of Archaea
Feng-Jie Sun1,2,3, Gustavo Caetano-Anollés1*

Abstract
Background: Ribonuclease P is an ancient endonuclease that cleaves precursor tRNA and generally consists of a
catalytic RNA subunit (RPR) and one or more proteins (RPPs). It represents an important macromolecular complex
and model system that is universally distributed in life. Its putative origins have inspired fundamental hypotheses,
including the proposal of an ancient RNA world.
Results: To study the evolution of this complex, we constructed rooted phylogenetic trees of RPR molecules and
substructures and estimated RPP age using a cladistic method that embeds structure directly into phylogenetic
analysis. The general approach was used previously to study the evolution of tRNA, SINE RNA and 5S rRNA, the
origins of metabolism, and the evolution and complexity of the protein world, and revealed here remarkable
evolutionary patterns. Trees of molecules uncovered the tripartite nature of life and the early origin of archaeal
RPRs. Trees of substructures showed molecules originated in stem P12 and were accessorized with a catalytic P1-P4
core structure before the first substructure was lost in Archaea. This core currently interacts with RPPs and ancient
segments of the tRNA molecule. Finally, a census of protein domain structure in hundreds of genomes established
RPPs appeared after the rise of metabolic enzymes at the onset of the protein world.
Conclusions: The study provides a detailed account of the history and early diversification of a fundamental
ribonucleoprotein and offers further evidence in support of the existence of a tripartite organismal world that
originated by the segregation of archaeal lineages from an ancient community of primordial organisms.

Background
With few exceptions [1], ribonuclease P (RNase P) is
one of two universal ribozymes (the other is the ribosome) that are present in all living organisms. This ribonucleoprotein is generally composed of an RNA subunit,
the RNase P RNA (RPR), and one or more protein subunits, the RNase P proteins (RPPs) [2]. RNase P functions as a phosphodiesterase carrying out the 5’
endonucleolytic cleavage of transfer RNA (tRNA) precursor transcripts (pre-tRNA) to form mature functional
tRNAs [3-5]. Regions of the RPR that contribute to the
recognition of the substrate cleavage sites [the tRNA
pseudouridine (TΨC) loop and CCA tail] are well studied. Remarkably, the catalytic function can be conducted by the RNA subunit independently of protein
subunits, indicating that the biological activity resides in
the RPR [6-8].

The ubiquitous distribution of RPR molecules in life
suggests that a primordial RPR form was already present
before the diversification of the three superkingdoms of
life, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya [9]. Furthermore,
the RPR is also the catalytic subunit in all three superkingdoms [10]. Bacterial RPRs have been divided into
two independently folding domains, the catalytic (C)
domain involved in substrate cleavage and the specificity
(S) domain involved in substrate binding [11,12]. The S
domain is composed of stem P7 and stems distal to P7
while the rest of the molecule delimits the C domain.
The C domain contains the entire active site and binds
the acceptor stem/5’-leader and the ACCA sequence at
the 3’ end (by a Watson-Crick base-pairing mechanism)
of pre-tRNA, cleaving the leader sequence in the presence of bacterial RPP cofactors [13,14]. The S domain
binds the TΨC stem-loop region of pre-tRNA and confers substrate specificity. RPR can be divided into five
universally distinct conserved regions (CR I to V) that
are distal to each other in the primary sequence and

define the universally conserved core structure [15]. The
S domain comprises CR II and III and the C domain
comprises CR I, IV, and V [16]. While components of
the tertiary fold are overwhelmingly helical it is interesting that both domains have many nonhelical parts: CR
II and III form two interleaving T-loop motifs whereas
CR I, IV, and V are part of loops and turns.
Altman and Kirsebom [17] proposed that an earlier
RPR form that lacked the S domain might have existed
in the RNA world, because this domain was not needed
for the binding of the substrate. The C domain was
therefore more ancient than the S domain. Remarkably,
modification of the S domain of Bacillus subtilis indicates substrate specificity can be altered without changing the basic cleavage reaction [18]. In fact, a
“minimal” RPR, the smallest molecule needed to carry
out the hydrolysis reaction, has been defined [19]. This
minimal RPR contains molecular components from both
the S and C domains. Interestingly, consensus RNase P
structures show that the C domain is more conserved
than the more variable S domain in all three superkingdoms [19-22]. However, the C domain by itself is either
non-functional in the absence of cognate RPPs or has
greatly decreased catalytic activity compared to the wild
type [23-25]. Furthermore, the S domain appears to
facilitate substrate recognition and binding in the ribozyme reaction and the S domain alone can bind pretRNA directly [26]. All these observations suggest the C
domain is indeed ancestral and that the S domain plays
an accessory but important role during the cleavage of
precursor tRNA. Despite the relevance of these results,
the evolutionary history of the molecular components of
the two structural folding domains remains elusive.
Here we study the evolution of the RNase P complex
with a well-established phylogenetic method that reconstructs evolutionary history directly from structure [27].
This cladistic approach produces intrinsically rooted
trees that “embed structure and function directly into
phylogenetic analysis” [28]. The method has been
applied widely to study the evolution of structure in
rRNA [27,29], tRNA [30-32], SINE RNA [33], and other
molecules [34], and has also been extended to the evolutionary study of protein domains at fold and fold superfamily (FSF) levels of structural complexity [35-38]. Two
kinds of trees are generated in studies of RNA evolution,
‘trees of molecules’ that describe the evolution of molecular lineages, and ‘trees of molecular substructures’
that describe the evolution of structural components of
the molecules. Using this methodology, we here study
the history of the structure of the RNA subunit, establishing how the shape of the RPR molecule and its
structural domains changed in evolution (Figure 1). This
information was then coupled with an evolutionary analysis of RPP domain structures at FSF level using

previously developed methods of phylogenomic reconstruction [38]. Finally, the evolutionary tracing of phylogenetic information in crystallographic models (heat
maps) help clarify how the history of the ribonucleoprotein relates to the discovery of function and the establishment of RNA-protein interactions.

Results and Discussion
A cladistic strategy to study the evolution of molecular
structure

We illustrate our cladistic approach with a flow diagram
that describes how we study RNA and proteins (Figure
1). When analyzing RNA molecules, we first deconstruct
RNA secondary structure into substructures, very much
as nucleic acid sequences are deconstructed into nucleotide sites for the purpose of phylogenetic analysis. RPR
crystal structures show that a substantial portion of the
molecule is helical or approximately helical, a feature
that RPR shares with rRNA and other functional RNA.
For example, the ribosomal ensemble can be effectively
considered an arrangement of ~200 helical segments in
three-dimensional (3D) space [39]. In these molecules,
the accretion of disparate helical segments contributes
to the aggrandizement of ribosomal structure, which is
ultimately responsible of making up crucial functional
centers [40]. Similarly, the RPR molecule can be considered an arrangement of ~26 helical substructures (P1,
P2, etc.), some of which are missing in particular molecular lineages (see below). Since crystallographic models
and comparative sequence analysis support the existence
and homology of these substructures, attributes describing structural features of these substructures (e.g., their
length) can be used as phylogenetic characters to build
either trees of molecules or trees of substructures (Figure 1). The attributes of these substructures are therefore analogous to the presence of a nucleotide at a
particular site in a nucleic acid sequence in traditional
phylogenetic reconstructions, with the caveat that it
would be indeed challenging to build trees of sites
(instead of trees of sequences) directly from sequence.
We illustrate the analysis in more detail with a concrete example of how we build trees of molecules and
trees of substructures (Figure 2). We first generate primary RPR sequence alignments that take into consideration the secondary structure of the molecules. We then
score the lengths of segments that form base pairs or
remain unpaired, traversing from the 5’ to the 3’ end of
the molecules that are examined. In this process we
assign substructures to stems, bulges, hairpins, and
other unpaired segments as we encounter these in the
secondary structure. This defines a data matrix with for
example columns describing substructures and rows
describing the RPR molecules. These matrices can
be partitioned into matrices of substructures types

Figure 1 General methodological approach. The flow diagram in the left describes the phylogenetic reconstruction of trees of molecules and
substructures. The structure of RPR molecules can be deconstructed into substructures, such as coaxial stem tracts and unpaired regions, that
can be studied using features (characters) that describe their geometry and shape (e.g., length of stems or unpaired regions). These structural
characters are coded and assigned “character states” according to an evolutionary model that polarizes character transformation towards an
increase in molecular order (character argumentation). Coded characters (s) are arranged in data matrices, which can be transposed and
subjected to cladistic analyses to generate intrinsically rooted phylogenetic trees of either molecules or substructures. The trees are then used to
generate evolutionary heat maps of secondary structure that color secondary structures or 3D structural models with molecular ancestries. The
flow diagram in the right shows the reconstruction of trees of proteomes and trees of protein architectures. A census of domain structures in
proteomes of hundreds of completely sequenced organisms is used to compose a data matrix and its transposed matrix, which are then used
to build phylogenomic trees describing the evolution of individual architectures and entire molecular repertoires, respectively. Elements of the
matrix (g) represent genomic abundances of architectures (at FSF level of hierarchical classification of structure) in proteomes. Ancestries derived
from the tree of architectures can be “painted” onto 3D models of the RNase P molecular complex. Evolutionary information from RNA and
protein structures is finally combined to generate a model of structural evolution.

(e.g. stem substructures) and encoded in the NEXUS format (as is or transposed), which are then used as input
text file for equally weighted unconstrained maximum
parsimony (MP) analysis. In the file, the first column
represents a phylogenetic character and individual
numerical values character states. Rows are phylogenetic
taxa. The input files generate rooted trees of molecules
or trees of substructures depending on what is considered taxa (see Figure 1). The NEXUS file also defines the
character states of a hypothetical ancestor (under the
‘ANCSTATES’ command) and this determines the preferred direction (polarity) of character state change. This
hypothetical ancestor in our example has the maximal
character state for each character and is included in the
search for optimal rooted trees with the sole purpose of

polarizing character state transformation. No external
hypotheses in the form of outgroups (e.g. ancestral
molecules or ancestral substructures) are needed to root
the trees. The external hypotheses are replaced by the
more axiomatic polarization assumption of our evolutionary model. For more detailed descriptions of the
method and model, see Materials and Methods and for
example [29-33,41].
With proteins, we use hidden Markov models
(HMMs) of structural recognition to survey protein
sequences in genomes, decomposing proteins into protein domains at FSF level (Figure 1). The survey establishes the number of copies of a domain that exist in
the proteome of an organism that has been fully
sequenced, and these numbers are used as character

states when constructing data matrices, with columns
and rows representing proteomes or domain architectures. As with RNA, matrices can be transposed to construct trees of proteomes or trees of architectures. Trees
of architectures define the age of each individual domain
(reviewed in [38]), and this information can be used to
establish the relative and absolute age of the RPPs that
are present in the RNase P complex.

Phylogenetic utility of RPR structure and the early origin
of Archaea

Recent studies have indicated that RPR molecules are
suitable for phylogenetic analysis of closely related bacterial taxa and have potential as a tool for species discrimination [42]. One distinctive feature is that there is
only one copy of the encoding gene in a genome making
it more refractory to inter-specific lateral gene transfer.

Moreover, RPRs from Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya
are easily distinguished from each other, serving as good
and reliable molecular markers for systematic phylogeny.
Sequence diversity expresses even if the structure and
associated catalytic function of the molecules remain
unchanged [43]. This feature becomes extremely useful
when exploring deep evolutionary relationships, especially in cases where sequences are too variable or when
molecules that are compared are distantly related (e.g.,
RPR and a variant that participates in rRNA processing,
RNase MRP RNA) [44]. In this regard, Collins et al. [45]
demonstrated that phylogenetically informative characters are indeed embedded in the secondary structure of
RPR molecules and that these can be used to uncover
the tripartite nature of life heralded by the Woese
school. In the present study, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees describing the evolution of 133 RPRs using
information in sequence and structure (Table 1). These
phylogenies were generally well resolved and clustered
molecules belonging to the three superkingdoms, with
Archaea and Eukarya generally appearing unified in single (monophyletic) groups (Table 2). Since structural
phylogenetic characters provide a direction to evolutionary change without the need of outgroups or external
hypotheses of relationship [27,44], their inclusion established patterns of origin and was therefore particularly
advantageous. Figure 3 describes a rooted tree generated
using the total evidence approach from both structure
and sequence data. With the exception of a single bacterial molecule that appeared at the base of the tree and
harbored a unique structural type (see discussion
below), archaeal RPRs were ancient while eukaryal RPRs
were derived. This rooting of the tree of molecules suggests an early diversification of Archaea. The result is
particularly remarkable, especially because it is congruently supported by phylogenetic analyses of tRNA paralogues [46-49], the structure of tRNA [31] and 5S rRNA
[41], and phylogenomic studies of domain structure [37]
and domain organization in proteins [35,36].
Detailed phylogenetic patterns were maintained when
data were partitioned according to superkingdoms or
according to sequence, structure, or structural domain

(Table 2). As previously reported for other RNA molecules [27,29,30,34,45,50,51], trees derived from structure
were largely congruent with those derived from
sequence, both from combined data or matrices partitioned according to superkingdoms, with the incongruent nodes being weakly supported by bootstrap values
(<50%) and generally basal in the trees. Congruence was
also observed when comparing trees generated by neighbor-joining (NJ) and MP analyses. In terms of superkingdoms, only trees reconstructed from the S domain
or from stabilizing structural characters failed to reveal
the monophyly of both Archaea and Eukarya. Trees generated from the C domain (using both stabilizing and
de-stabilizing structural characters) were better resolved
than those derived from the S domain (Additional file 1:
Figures S1 and S2). Similarly, trees derived from de-stabilizing characters were better resolved than those
obtained from stabilizing characters. Interestingly, trees
derived from helical structure conserved in all three
superkingdoms were largely unresolved (Additional file
1: Figures S3 and S4). Overall results strongly support
the generally accepted concept that ancient substructures that are more stable and are universal have less
power to resolve phylogenetic relationships of lineages
than derived substructures that are less stable, are lineage specific, or are believed part of derived structural
domains.
In Archaea, the monophyly of Crenarchaeota was
recovered by the combined analysis of structure and
sequence data (Figure 3) but not by separate analyses of
either structure or sequence data alone. The monophyly
of Euryarchaeota was not revealed in any analysis. This
result agrees with whole-genome studies that have questioned the monophyly of these two groups [52,53].
Furthermore, the monophyly of Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota is based on 16S rRNA, the most popular
gene for evolutionary studies. However, it is now
becoming apparent that there is only partial agreement
between the 16S rRNA universal tree and phylogenies
derived from proteins or genomic complements [54]. In
Bacteria, major bacterial groups were clearly identified
but branching patterns were mostly unresolved. This is

an expected result, especially because bacterial phylogeny has not been convincingly reconstructed and the
issue of the branching order of major bacterial lineages
remains contentious. For example, phylogenetic analyses
of a large dataset of all available bacterial RPR sequences
resulted in unstable tree topologies [55]. Observations
are therefore consistent with RPRs being of limited phylogenetic use in Bacteria: relationships among phyla
were largely unresolved while relationships within phyla
were well-resolved and comparable to relationships
within superkingdoms Archaea and Eukarya.
Evolution of RPR types

An accurate model for RPR structure is a prerequisite
for understanding the mechanism of substrate recognition (S domain), catalytic activity (C domain), and evolution of the ribozyme, and is supported by a significant
body of evidence from biochemical, photochemical,
molecular, crystallographic, and phylogenetic comparative studies. For example, refined secondary structure
models have been inferred by identifying concerted
changes (covariation) in the nucleotide sequence of
RPRs that share common ancestry and function and
have been generally confirmed by biochemical and

crystallographic evidence [56-59]. In these analyses, the
eukaryal secondary structure is not sufficiently resolved
[60], and although there are no high-resolution structures available for archaeal and eukaryal RPRs, the identification of more than 50 sequences from each
superkingdom allowed considerable refinement of secondary structure models [22,61,62]. Five general types of
RPR structures are recognized in molecules belonging to
the three superkingdoms (Table 3). Covariation analyses
of a comprehensive set of bacterial RPR sequences
established a well-defined secondary structure, identified
tertiary interactions, and classified RPRs into two major
classes with distinct secondary structures [3]. The common ancestral-type or type A structure, represented by
Escherichia coli, is found in most bacterial and archaeal
organisms. The Bacillus-type or type B, represented by
Bacillus subtilis, is found only in low-GC Gram-positive
bacteria [63]. Through a process of convergent molecular evolution, most of the unusual structural elements of
type B RPRs evolved independently in Thermomicrobium, a member of the green non-sulfur bacteria, to
form type C RPRs (lacking stems P13 and P14 but containing P10.1; Table 3) [63,64]. In Archaea, the Methanococcus and Archaeoglobus fulgidus RPRs form

a unique derived structure class, type M, with an apparently less complex structure (lacking P8) in comparison
to the ancestral type A structure [61,64]. Finally,
eukaryal RPRs generally lack a convincing secondary
structure model and are distinct from those of Bacteria
and Archaea. They are defined as type E.
Trees of molecules dissected the evolutionary history
of the different types of RPR structures and their evolutionary origin (Figure 3). Mapping of the various types
of RPRs on the trees revealed patterns of origin and
evolution of structural design (Figure 3). Type A molecules in Archaea and Bacteria were clearly ancestral
compared to type B molecules, while type M structures
of methanogenic archaeal species appeared quite early
in the monophyletic archaeal group. Eukaryal type E
molecules were the most derived in the tree. It is generally acknowledged that type A is the most ancient folding structure in RPRs [65] and that the ancestral type A
form underwent substantial innovative change in the
common specific ancestry of the eukaryal and archaeal
lineages. This change can be visualized in the make-up
of the RNase P complex. For example, enzymes in both

Archaea and Eukarya contain more proteins than those
in Bacteria, suggesting that archaeal and eukaryal RPRs
have coevolved to display a greater dependence on their
cognate proteins. The eukaryal RPRs are weaker catalysts than their bacterial counterparts, supporting the
notion that RPPs play important functional roles, assisting for example in RNA folding, substrate binding, and/
or catalysis. Although archaeal RPRs are composed of
an RNA subunit similar to bacterial RPRs [61,66], the
multiple protein subunits are similar to those in the
eukaryotic nucleus [65]. More importantly, a few bacterial RPR structural elements that are essential for substrate binding, catalysis, and global stability were either
never acquired or lost during evolution of the archaeal
and eukaryal RPRs, accounting for their lower stability/
activity in the absence of cognate RPPs [3,67,68].
Furthermore, the archaeal and eukaryal RPRs are clearly
missing sequence/structure elements present in bacterial
RPRs that are either important for tertiary contacts or
for direct interactions with the substrate (Table 3). For
example, the L15 loop (of the P15 substructure)
that establishes base-pairing interactions with the

Sun and Caetano-Anollés BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:153
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/153

CCA sequence at the 3’ end of pre-tRNAs is also absent
in all eukaryal and some archaeal RPRs. These observations suggest that archaeal and eukaryal RPRs underwent reductive evolutionary tendencies similar to those
seen in the very ancient components of proteomic
repertoires [37].
Interestingly, the type C RPR structure from Thermomicrobium roseum was placed at the base of trees of
molecules (Figure 3). Type C and type B RPRs are not
phylogenetically related at sequence level and present
major structural differences, including the presence of
P6, P16, and P17 in type C and their replacement with
P5.1 in type B (Table 3). However, they also share structural features (e.g., loss of P13 and P14 and acquisition
of P10.1) resulting from convergent molecular evolution
events [63].
Evolution of RPR structure

Phylogenetic trees of RPR substructures (and associated
evolutionary heat maps) provide a chronology that
establishes which parts of the molecule are ancestral
and which parts are derived. We generated trees
describing the evolution of helical stems, hairpins,
bulges, and unpaired regions (Figure 4; see Table 4 for
tree statistics). Since RNA structures are defined by a
frustrated conformational interplay of stems and loops,
the tree of stem substructures (revisited in Figure 5)
constitutes the fundamental scaffold of structural evolution of the entire molecule. Trees of stems derived from
the complete dataset and from datasets partitioned
according to the C and S structural domains revealed
concordant topologies (Additional file 1: Figure S5). The
analysis of other substructures was less informative but
complemented the original evolutionary patterns derived
from the stem scaffold (Figure 4). For example, the tree
of unpaired regions showed the 5’-terminal free end of
the molecule (U5end) was more ancient than the 3’ end
(U3end), a pattern that was recovered independently in
the analysis of both tRNA and 5S rRNA molecules
[30,41].
The most ancient substructure in the tree was P12, a
terminal stem of the S domain (Figure 5A). This substructure was immediately followed by four helical segments of the C domain, P1, P3, P4 and P2, in that
order, one of which (P4) represents the universal pseudoknot structure of the complex. Substructures P1 to P4
define an important molecular feature that is revealed
on the tree as a paraphyletic basal group. This helix
structure contains the RNase P active site [58,59,69-71],
the catalytic center that cleaves the pre-tRNA sequence.
Furthermore, substructures P1 to P4 are part of the conserved minimal core defined by Siegel et al. [19], which
is shared by organisms in all three superkingdoms. The
other shared substructure in this core is helix P10-11,

Page 9 of 21

another substructural component of the S domain,
which appears in the tree immediately after the P1-P4
core structure. However, this substructure sustains
considerable sequence variation, particularly among
eukaryotic RPRs. Interestingly, the most conserved
nucleotides in the RPR sequence are concentrated in the
core structure (centered in P4) and in the large loop
between P11 and P12 [72].
The taxonomic distribution of evolving stem substructures revealed that, with an exception in the P8 stem
that was lost in type M archaeal molecules, the first 10
most ancient structures were universally present in all
RPR molecules (Table 3). Note however that P12 is
absent in Mycoplasma fermentans and Thermoproteaceae, species with highly reduced genomes [19,72]. The
next structure to evolve was a pseudoknot (P6) that is
typical of type A molecules in Archaea and Bacteria, but
not present in Eukarya. This stem was followed by a
number of structures generally shared by RPRs in one
or more superkingdoms, with structures specific to bacterial type A RPRs evolving first, followed by structures
specific to archaeal type A molecules, and then structures specific to bacterial type B RPRs (see summary of
patterns in Figure 4A). These patterns define the possible emergence of superkingdoms and match the rooted
topology of the tree of molecules derived from combined sequence and structure datasets, which suggests
the early diversification of Archaea (Figure 3).
With the exception of stem P12, the C domain was in
general more ancient than the S domain on all of the
trees of stem substructures analyzed. The ancestral nature of the C domain was also revealed in trees of other
substructures (Additional file 1: Figure S6). Overall, the
highly conserved P1-P4 core structure was primordial in
the C domain when compared to many other helical
structures that were added later in evolution to both
structural domains. Consequently, our phylogenetic constructs provide an additional and strong line of evidence
in support of the ancestral nature of the C domain [17].
Note that exclusion of stem P12 and other basal substructures from the analysis did not alter the topology
of the trees, supporting the robustness of our phylogenetic hypotheses (data not shown).
The catalytic core represents the set of four ancestral
elements (P1 to P4) in the RPR molecule (Figure 5) and
the only four conserved stems of the C domain in the
universal consensus minimum structure of RPR [3]. It is
therefore particularly noteworthy that these ancestral
and conserved substructures interact with the ancient
top domain of the pre-tRNA as it cleaves its 5’ end
sequence (Figure 4B). This top half of the pre-tRNA
molecule is composed of the TΨC and acceptor arms.
Previous phylogenetic studies indicate that the top
domain of tRNA predates evolutionarily the bottom

domain composed of the dihydrouridine (DHU) and
anticodon arms [30] supporting the ancestrality of this
part of the molecule [73]. Consequently, the relative age
of molecular contacts suggests the co-evolution of the
top domain of tRNA (the substrate) and the C domain
of the RPR (the catalyst). Given the supporting (instead
of catalytic) function carried out by the S domain, the
ancestrality of the very ancient P12 substructure is
clearly of evolutionary significance (see discussion
below).
Early origins of RNA-protein interactions in the catalytic
complex

It is critical that we examine RNA-protein interactions
in the RNase P complex, given that proteins and catalytic RNA are both required for enzyme activity in vivo.
In addition to pre-tRNAs, there are a few other substrates for RNase P in vivo, such as pre-4.5S RNA, pretmRNA, a few mRNAs, and riboswitches [74-78]. To
date, it is generally realized that RPR-RPP interactions
serve to stabilize the structure of the complex, enhancing substrate recognition and affinity for substrates and
metal ions [69,79-82].
Bacterial RNase P studies show that type B and ancestral type A molecules can interchangeably activate RNA
catalytic functions [69,71,82,83] at both protein and
RNA levels, indicating that the RPP recognizes a region
of structure that is conserved between the two classes of
bacterial RNase P enzymes [83]. The crystal structures
of type A (Thermotoga maritima) and type B (Bacullus
stearothermophilus) RPRs [16,58,59] revealed similar features in the catalytic cores of both RNAs, including the

coaxial stacks P1/P4/P5, P2/P3, and P8/P9. Specifically,
the metal binding loop and N-terminus of the RPP are
near the P3 stem-loop of the RPR. Additionally, the conserved RNR motif is close to helix P4, which is necessary for positioning divalent metal ions required for
catalysis, and is the putative active site of the holoenzyme [13,84,85]. These studies support the notion that
the RPP binds a conserved area of the RPR, stabilizing
the local RNA structure, as well as stabilizing the RPR
contacts with the pre-tRNA substrates [69,82,86].
As discussed previously, our results support the
hypothesis that the C domain is the ancestral structural
and functional domain [17]. However, they also show
that the catalytic RNA-protein complex is ancient (Figure 5). The RPP contacts the catalytic domain of the
RPR molecule, with specific contacts involving the P1P4 core structure in a region that has been proposed to
contain the active site and the phylogenetically conserved RNA core [43,59,71,82]. Evolutionary heat maps
support the ancestrality of these contacts, which are
basal on the trees of substructures (Figure 5B and 4C).
The implication of a direct interaction of the RPP with
the ancient P1-P4 core structure is therefore fundamental, suggesting the early involvement of proteins in
catalysis.
It is noteworthy that both archaeal and eukaryal RPPs
show extensive protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, and that some of these may also involve the S
domain. Furthermore, only a subset of the protein subunits may be necessary for catalytic activity while other
proteins function in assembly and/or localization. In
fungi, only two (Pop1p and Pop4p) out of nine nuclear
RPPs interact with RPR [87]. Tsai et al. [88] suggested
that the Rpp21/Rpp29 and Pop5/Rpp30 pairs in Pyrococcus furiosus interact with the S and C domains, respectively, enabling the inter-domain cooperation required
for optimal pre-tRNA recognition and catalysis. Enzymatic footprinting also demonstrated that the RPP21/
RPP29 protein complex in Pyrococcus furiosus interacts
only with the S domain of the RPR [89]. Moreover,
many studies show that helix P3 of the RPR catalytic
core, which is ancient in our study, is the binding site
for RPPs and RNase MRP proteins. Crystal structure of
the P3 in RNase MRP of Saccharomyces cerevisiae also
suggests some likely functions of P3 in stabilizing the
enzyme’s structure and in interactions with pre-tRNA
[90]. In human nuclear RNase P, Rpp21 binds to H1
RNA and also to the P3 domain [91]. In S. cerevisiae
RNase MRP and RNase P, Pop6 and Pop7 form a heterodimer that binds directly to P3, protecting a segment
of the lower strand of the internal loop of P3 and part
of the adjacent helical stem [92]. Similar results were
obtained for human RNase MRP [93]. Furthermore,
RNA-protein interactions involving P3 are not limited

pseudoknot, and how the top half of tRNA makes crucial contacts with the base of the most ancient substructure, the P12 stem. The RPR and
RPP structure is from Bacillus [58,70].

to the Pop6/Pop7 heterodimer; other proteins probably
interact with this extended helix [94]. For example, helix
P3 also appears to interact specifically with Pop1 in
both S. cerevisiae RNase P and RNase MRP [95].
The age and evolution of RPPs

The number of proteins associated with catalytic RNA
varies greatly between Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria.
In general, there are 4-5 and 9-10 protein units in
archaeal [96] and eukaryal molecules [4,97-99], respectively. In contrast, bacterial RNase P enzymes are the
simplest versions of the complex. They consist of only
one protein and a single RPR molecule, providing a conserved and straightforward molecular ensemble for crystallographic study [60].
In order to study the evolution of RPPs and determine
the putative age of protein-RNA contacts, we timed the
appearance of the 3D structure of RPP-associated
domains in a tree of architectures derived from phylogenomic analysis of domain structure at FSF level of structural classification (Figure 6). The global phylogeny of
protein architectures was reconstructed from a HMMbased genomic census in 584 completely sequenced
organisms (Figure 6). This tree describes the history of
1,453 FSFs and was used to determine the relative age
of RPP domains of known structure. We also used
HMMs to assign protein structure to 1,136 RPP-associated sequences in the UniProtKB database, revealing
that 1,029 of these entries were linked to 6 FSFs, 5 of
which were RPR-associated holoenzymes. Interestingly,
5 sequence entries were linked to the NAD(P)-binding
Rossmann fold domain (c.2.1), the second most ancient
FSF (nd = 0.005), and corresponded to the recently
identified RPPs that do not associate with RNA cofactors [100]. The age of RPR-linked domains ranged from
nd = 0.06 in the ribosomal protein S5 domain-like
domain (d.14.1) typically found in bacterial complexes
to nd = 0.803 in the AlbA-like domain (d.68.6).
We previously identified three epochs in the evolution
of proteins [37] and RNA [30], an ancient ‘architectural
diversification epoch’ in which ancient molecules
(including tRNA and 5S rRNA) [31,41] emerged and
diversified, a ‘superkingdom specification’ epoch in
which molecules sorted in emerging archaeal and
eukaryal-like organismal lineages, and a late ‘organismal
diversification’ epoch in which molecular lineages diversified in an increasingly diversified tripartite world. Four
of all RPP domains (c.2.1, d.14.1, c.6.3, and d.79.3) originated in the architectural diversification epoch, while
two appeared quite late during the organismal diversification epoch (c.6.3 and d.68.6) (Figure 6). Interestingly,
the most ancient RPR-associated protein domain (nd =
0.06), the ribosomal protein S5 domain-like FSF (d.14.1)
depicted in the complex of Figure 5B and 5C, appeared

Page 13 of 21

very early in the protein world, at the start of the architectural diversification epoch. Other RPR domains associated with known crystal structures directly through
PDB entries or when using HMMs of structural recognition, were more derived (Figure 6), some even appearing
during the organismal diversification epoch. This suggests RPPs interacted with the ancient P1-P4 core structure to form a primordial RNase P complex very early
in evolution, at a time when the world of organisms was
not diversified. Since the most ancient domain architectures in this tree had an origin in nucleotide metabolism
[38,101], it is clear that this primordial RNase P complex was derived compared to ancient protein enzymes
in primitive metabolic networks.
One interesting observation is the age of the domain
linked to RNase P enzymes in organelles of Eukarya that
do not require RPR cofactors (e.g., human mitochondrial
RNase P) [100]. The domain of these protein-only
RNAse P molecules, the NAD(P)-binding Rossmann
fold domain (c.2.1) is widely distributed in nature (e.g.
present throughout metabolism) and is very old (nd =
0.005). This suggests that the addition of the RPR moiety to the catalytic protein-based RNase P enzymes is
either a derived feature or alternatively that the domain
was co-opted late in evolution in eukaryotic organelles
to perform the ribonucleoprotein task. However, the
fact that the make-up of RPP domains is varied and evolutionarily diverse in RNase P suggests recruitment plays
an important role in evolution of catalysis in this complex and the argument can be used to disfavor the idea
that organellar protein enzymes are ancient fossils.
Without additional evidence capable of dissecting
recruitment, however, the age of the c.2.1 domain cannot be used to support or refute the ancestrality of RPPs
relative to RPRs.
The ancient origin and centrality of stem P12

Studies have shown that the S domain contributes to
pre-tRNA recognition and helps position the substrate
for optimal cleavage [10,102,103]. However, while RPPs
appear to bind solely to the C domain [71], footprinting
[104] and crosslinking analyses [105] suggest that the
P12 substructure is also part of the protein-binding site.
However, the possible role of P12 has been questioned;
further studies have shown that the protein footprinting
is restricted to the C domain [69,106,107]. It is noteworthy that the sequence at the base of helix P12 is
relatively conserved and is physically adjacent to the
core of the enzyme in close proximity to the connection
between the top and bottom halves of the pre-tRNA
molecules (see heat maps in Figure 5). However, the
overall sequence of P12 does not contain any of the universally conserved nucleotides of the molecule [3,15]
and its role as functional determinant is variable, being

genomic census of protein domain structure at FSF level of structural classification and RPPs of known structure were traced in the tree. The

sometimes dispensable (e.g. in cyanobacteria [108]).
Regardless of it playing an accessory or vital role in the
current function of the molecule, the observation that
P12 is indeed the most ancestral substructure of the
complex (Figures 4 and 5), despite it being considered
part of the structural S domain, lends support to its
early role in a putative catalytic activity that is now partially displaced to the more derived P1-P4 core structure
and also involves crucial protein-RNA interactions. This
ancient catalytic activity could have been different to
that of the extant catalytic RPR core and could have
been neofunctionalized later on in evolution as the

structure was co-opted to perform new roles. It is interesting to note that P12 has been lost in a few lineages,
most probably as a secondary evolutionary event. This
may suggest that its functional role is limited and sometimes dispensable and that in some cases the substructure does not contribute significantly to organismal
fitness. Alternatively, the loss of the substructure may
have been advantageous, as it could have defined different substrate specificities.
Results also underscore the significance of a primordial stem-loop that originally harbored a multitude of
primordial functions, most of which were lost or

Sun and Caetano-Anollés BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:153
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/153

displaced as molecules evolved and gained specific roles.
The concept of a hairpin being the starting component
of tRNA [109] has been emphasized by the genomic tag
hypothesis [73] and has been recently supported by phylogenetic studies of the structure of SINE RNA [33] and
tRNA molecules [30]. Recent analyses of 5S rRNA [41]
and major rRNA subunits (Harish and Caetano-Anollés,
unpublished) are in line with this evidence. The proposal that the P12 substructure of the RNA subunit may
be a modern derivative of the primitive multifunctional
hairpin structure and that this substructure probably
lost most primordial functions as the RNase P complex
evolved is therefore of great significance and merits
careful examination.

Conclusions
Our study reveals several important evolutionary patterns linked to the structure and function of RNA and
protein components of RNase P: (i) the early origin of
archaeal RPR molecules, which suggests the lineage
leading to superkingdom Archaea is ancestral; (ii) the
origin of the RPR molecule in the P12 substructure, closely followed by the catalytic P1-P4 core structure; (iii)
the ancient origin of the C domain; (iv) the early
appearance of RPP substructures that interact with proteins in this primordial RNase P complex; (v) and the
ancestral nature of RPR-associated proteins, which originated at the onset of the protein world. Based on these
observations we propose a model for the early evolution
of the ribonuclease catalytic complex in a lineage leading to the last universal common ancestor of life (Figure
7). In this model, the interaction of primordial protein
and RNA molecules result in a complex that is stabilized
later in evolution by the establishment of a pseudoknotted structure (substructure P4). This catalytic structure is ultimately responsible for the modern make-up
of the molecule, as accessory substructures organize
around it and enhance the catalytic activities and specificity of the evolving ribonucleoprotein particles.
Methods
Data

The secondary structures of 130 RPR sequences were
retrieved from the RNase P Database (http://jwbrown.
mbio.ncsu.edu/RNaseP/home.html; Release No. 12, 2005
edition, [110]). Partial sequences were excluded in this
study. Selected RNA sequences folded into secondary
structures that are compatible with RPR phylogeny and
known 3-dimensional models of RPR structure [58].
Another three RPRs from Entamoeba histolytica [111],
Zea mays [45], and Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis
[112] were also included to increase sampling diversity.
Phylogenetic trees showed that one mitochondrial
(Reclinomonas americana), two chloroplast (Porphyra

Page 15 of 21

purpurea and Zea mays), and one cyanelle (Cyanophora
paradoxa) sequences were closely related to bacterial
sequences, a result that is consistent with the evolutionary origins of these organelles. These four taxa were
subsequently included in Bacteria. Table 1 shows the
taxonomic distributions of the sampled RPRs. Note that
RPR sequences sampled in this study are the only available that are associated to structure [42] and that their
number is limited when compared to sequences available from metagenomic projects [113]. However, the set
of RPR molecules selected encompasses all major RPR
substructures and all major thematic variations that
exist in molecules (Table 3). Consequently, our 133 RPR
dataset does not exclude major structural designs and
results should be impervious to sampling. The set also
encompasses a relatively balanced selection of organisms
representing the three superkingdoms. Because our
study does not represent a systematic analysis to discriminate species, representative sampling is an appropriate
strategy. We believe the species discrimination will likely
improve by inclusion of more species, while the conclusions drawn will not change significantly. In fact, a
~50% reduction in the number of RPRs (from 133 to 69,
with a RPR set that includes 39 bacterial, 15 archaeal
and 15 eukaryal molecules) did not affect the conclusions of the analysis that we here present suggesting
molecular sampling is appropriate.
Phylogenetic characters

Overall, we scored a total of 129 structural characters in
the 133 RPR molecules analyzed by comparative
sequence analysis, comparison with crystallographic
models, and other criteria (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Character homology was determined by the relative
position of substructures in the secondary structures
(see below) and coded character states were based on
the length (number of bases or base pairs) and number
of these substructures. These characters (also referred to
as ‘geometrical’ characters) describe the geometry of the
molecules by measuring, for example, the length in
nucleotides of each spatial component of secondary
structure. These components include double helical
stems, hairpin loops, bulges and interior loops, and
unpaired segments such as 5’ or 3’ free ends, connecting
joints, and multi-loop sequences separating stems. Character states were defined in alphanumerical format with
numbers from 0 to 9, letters from A to Z and a to z,
and other symbols (Table 2). Missing substructures were
given the minimum state (0). The data matrix of RPR
structure is given in Additional file 1: Table S2. Partitioned data matrices were built based on folding
domains (S and C domains), types of characters (stabilizing characters such as stems, or de-stabilizing characters such as bulges, hairpins, and other single-stranded

course of evolution.

regions), or superkingdoms (Archaea, Bacteria, and
Eukarya). Sequences were aligned based on the secondary structure models [42]. Eukarya and combined datasets were aligned using Clustal X [114] and adjusted
manually. Statistics related to the sequences that were
analyzed are described in Table 1.
Character homology

The criterion of primary homology is based on the feature
of structure being studied and its associated evolutionary
model, and how this feature relates to the substructural
taxa analyzed. Features can be descriptions of the geometry (e.g., shape characters) or the branching, stability, and
plasticity (e.g., statistical characters) of homologous substructural components. In this study we focus on the former. Homologous substructures represent those that are
of the same kind (e.g., domains, stems, base pairs) and
respond to the same evolutionary model defining the character transformation sequences. For example, we reconstruct trees of coaxial stems corresponding to the helical
regions in RPR, separate from trees of hairpin loops. This
is because character change leading to coaxial stem taxa
depends on models of character state that are quite different from those governing unpaired segments.
Character argumentation

Structural features were treated as linearly ordered multistate characters that were polarized by invoking an
evolutionary tendency towards molecular order. Establishing a preferred directionality of character state
change resulted in intrinsically rooted trees, which were
then used to define lineages that are either ancient or
derived. Operationally, polarization was determined by
fixing the direction of character state change using a

transformation sequence that distinguishes ancestral
states as those thermodynamically more stable. Maximum character states were defined as the ancestral
states for stems and G:U base pairs (i.e. structures stabilizing the RPRs). Minimum states (0) were treated as
the ancestral states for bulges, hairpin loops, and other
unpaired regions (i.e. structures de-stabilizing the RPRs).
The validity of character argumentation has been discussed in detail elsewhere [27,29-32,34,41,115], but is
supported by a considerable body of theoretical and
experimental evidence:
(i) Evidence from molecular mechanics

Many studies that focus on molecular mechanics
strongly support a tendency towards molecular order.
Comparative studies of extant and randomized
sequences show that evolution enhances conformational
order and diminishes conflicting molecular interactions
[34,116-122]. Indeed, randomizations of mono- and
di-nucleotides have been used to dissect the effects of
composition and order of nucleotides in the stability of
folded nucleic acid molecules and uncover evolutionary
processes acting at RNA and DNA levels [123]. In
recent bench experiments, extant evolved RNA molecules encoding complex and functional structural folds
were compared to oligonucleotides corresponding to
randomized counterparts [124]. Results show that arbitrary sequences, unlike evolved molecules, were prone
to having multiple competing conformations. In contrast
to arbitrary proteins, which rarely fold into well-ordered
structures [125], these arbitrary RNA sequences were
however quite soluble and compact and appeared delimited by physicochemical constraints such as nucleotide
composition that were inferred in previous computational studies [120].

(ii) Evidence from thermodynamics

A molecular tendency towards order can be linked to fundamental concepts in thermodynamics [126]. The “building order from disorder” concept championed by
Schrödinger [127] and others use energy dissipative processes linked to entropy to explain how energy that is able
to do work (free energy) transforms into energy that is
unavailable for that purpose. These processes fulfill the
maximum entropy production principle (MEPP) advanced
by Ziegler in non-equilibrium systems [128]. In this context, biological structure and organization acts as an
engine that extracts, concentrates and stores free energy
while maximizing the dissipation of energy gradients
[129]. This optimization results in more efficient degradation of incoming (solar) energy through autocatalytic, selfassembly, reproduction, evolution and adaptation
processes acting on molecular structures, all of which
enhance the order of the system and are in line with second law of thermodynamics [130,131]. The optimization
has also important consequences for evolution of molecular structure and the mapping of sequence to structure
spaces, representing different levels of biological organization. For example, RNA molecules have low informational
entropy in sequence space, but in structure space highly
evolvable phenotypes are also more entropic [132]. These
results suggest that increases in the order at one level of
organization are counteracted by decreases in the order of
the next. This relationship ultimately encourages escape
(evolvability) from constraints of order (stasis through
structural canalization). Note that a large body of theoretical evidence supports these sequence-to-structure mappings and their consequences on the energetic and kinetic
landscape of the evolving molecules [133,134]. Furthermore, some important predictions have already been confirmed experimentally in in vitro evolution of ribozymes
[135].
(iii) Evidence from cosmology

A tendency towards order is also supported by dissipation
tendencies in energy and matter that exist in an open cosmological model of the Friedmann type [126]. This model
describes that the universe expands faster than its contents
can equilibrate, turning the nearly homogeneous hot gas at
the beginning of the big bang into clumps of energy-dissipating matter that acquire more and more elaborate and
finer-grained properties [136,137]. This emerging structure ultimately materializes in ordered structures and life.
Note that three observational pillars support the big bang
model: (1) the motion of galaxies away from each other,
(2) the cosmic microwave background radiation, and (3)
the relative quantities of light chemical elements (e.g. He,
H) in cosmic gas.
(iv) Phylogenetic evidence

Finally and more importantly, tendencies towards structural order are experimentally supported by phylogenetic

Page 17 of 21

congruence of phylogenies reconstructed using geometrical and statistical structural characters [30,33,34] and
of phylogenies derived from sequence, structure, and
genomic rearrangements at different taxonomical levels
[27,29,33,34,45,50,51]. These phylogenetic reconstructions are in line with traditional organismal classification. Remarkably, tests in which characters were
polarized in the opposite direction generated phylogenetic trees that were less parsimonious and had topologies incompatible with accepted taxonomical knowledge
[27,34]. Other more indirect results derived from using
our focus on structure also proved to be congruent,
such as hypotheses of organismal origin that used global
trees of tRNA structures and constraint analysis [31]
and phylogenies of proteomes derived from an analysis
of protein structure in entire genomic complements
[37]. Many new instances of congruence from ongoing
phylogenetic studies (unpublished data) consistently
support our hypothesis of polarization. Note that order
is seldom achieved in frustrated molecular systems that
are driven by the energetics of conformation and stability, and that while the proposed generalized trend in
structure appears valid by the evidence outlined above,
we do not know the nature and stability of selective preferences or constraints acting on primordial RNA during
the early stages of evolution of these molecules.
Phylogenetic analysis

Data matrices were analyzed using equally weighted MP
as the optimality criterion in PAUP* [138]. Note that a
more realistic weighting scheme should consider for
example the evolutionary rates of change in structural
features. However, this requires the measurement of
evolutionary parameters along individual branches of
the tree and the development of an appropriate quantitative model. In the absence of this information, it is
most parsimonious and preferable to give equal weight
to the relative contribution of each character. The use
of MP (the preference of solutions that require the least
amount of change) is particularly appropriate and can
outperform maximum likelihood (ML) approaches in
certain circumstances [139]. MP is precisely ML when
character changes occur with equal probability but rates
vary freely between characters in each branch. This
model is useful when there is limited knowledge about
underlying mechanisms linking characters to each other
[139]. Furthermore, the use of large multi-step character
state spaces decreases the likelihood of revisiting a same
character state on the underlying tree, making MP statistically consistent. Phylogenetic analyses of stem characters common to all three superkingdoms (either P1 to
P4, P10, and P11, or P1 to P4, P7, and P9-P11) were
conducted to investigate the phylogenetic utility of the
conserved helical components of RPR. These stem

Sun and Caetano-Anollés BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:153
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/153

structures are a major subset of the core structures
defined by Siegel et al. [19]. Depending on the number
of taxa in each matrix, tree reconstructions were sought
using either exhaustive, branch-and-bound, or heuristic
search strategies. When the heuristic search strategy was
used, 1,000 heuristic searches were initiated using random addition starting taxa, with tree bisection reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and the MULTREES option
selected. One shortest tree was saved from each search.
Hypothetical ancestors were included in the searches for
the MP trees using the ANCSTATES command. A
“total evidence” approach [140,141], also called “simultaneous analysis” [142], was applied in phylogenetic analyses to combine both sequence and structure data of
the complete and partitioned matrices. The goal of this
analysis was to provide stronger support for the phylogenetic groupings recovered from analyses of structural
data. For comparison, a distance-based phylogenetic
method (i.e., neighboring-joining) was also performed
on all matrices. Bootstrap support (BS) values [143]
were calculated from 105 replicate analyses using “fast”
stepwise addition of taxa in PAUP*. The g1 statistic of
skewed tree length distribution calculated from 104 random parsimony trees was used to assess the amount of
nonrandom structure in the data [144].
Evolutionary relationships derived from trees of substructures were traced in generic 2-dimensional models
of RPR secondary structure that we here call evolutionary heat maps of ancestry. Because reconstructed trees
were intrinsically rooted, we established the relative age
(ancestry) of each substructure by measuring a distance
in nodes from the hypothetical ancestor on a relative
0-1 scale. To do this, we counted the number of nodes
in every lineage from the root to the terminals of the
tree and divided this number by the maximum number
of nodes in a lineage [28]. Ancestry values were divided
in classes, giving them individual hues in a color scale
that was then used to color substructures in the proposed RPR secondary structure model.
Phylogenomic analysis of protein architecture

A census of the genomic sequence of 584 organisms,
including 46 Archaea, 397 Bacteria and 141 Eukarya,
assigned protein structural domains corresponding to
1,453 fold superfamilies (FSFs) to protein sequences
using advanced linear hidden Markov models (HMMs)
of structural recognition in SUPERFAMILY and a probability cutoff E of 10 -4 . FSFs were defined by the
SCOPhttp://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/ version 1.69
[145]. The census was used to build data matrices of
genomic abundance of FSFs, which were coded as linearly ordered multistate phylogenetic characters. Data
matrices were used to build universal trees of protein
architectures with established methodology [146]. The

Page 18 of 21

reconstruction of these large trees is computationally
hard and their visualization challenging. We used a
combined parsimony ratchet (PR) and iterative search
approach to facilitate tree reconstruction [36]. A recent
review summarizes the general approach and the progression of census data and tree reconstruction in recent
years [98]. In order to discover architectures associated
with RPPs, we queried the UniProtKB (Protein Knowledgebase) database http://www.uniprot.org/ and downloaded 1,136 protein sequences in Fasta format. HMMs
were then used to predict the SCOP identifiers (IDs)
describing individual FSFs linked to the sequences. We
finally used the “SCOP parseable files” link in SCOP to
identify the corresponding IDs in the “dir.des.scop.txt
1.69” file. PROTEIN DATA BANK (PDB) files associated with RPPs were queried and downloaded from
the PDB database http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/.
