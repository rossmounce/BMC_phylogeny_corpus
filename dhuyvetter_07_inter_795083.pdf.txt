Abstract
Background: Pogonus littoralis and Pogonus chalceus are very close related species with quite
different ecological preferences within salt marshes. We study the evolutionary processes in and
between these presumably young species. Therefore, we compare the variation in ecologically
relevant characters and the genetic variation within one of the species (intraspecific differentiation)
with the variation of the two types of characters between the two species (interspecific variation).
Data are compared between two independent sets of populations, one set at a small geographical
scale (the ecologically diverse Guérande area in France) and the other set at a AtlanticMediterranean scale.
Results: Body and relative wing size and IDH1 allozyme data show that the intraspecific variation
in P. chalceus is high and in the same range as the interspecific variation (P. chalceus versus P. littoralis).
Based on neutral markers (other allozymes and mitochondrial DNA) on the other hand, the
intraspecific variation in P. chalceus is much lower in comparison to the interspecific variation.
Conclusion: The different ecotypes in the highly polytypic species P. chalceus are as highly
differentiated in ecological characters as true species, but are not recognised as such by screening
neutral DNA polymorphisms. This can be interpreted as a case of ongoing speciation driven by
natural selection adapting each ecotype to its respective ecological niche. The same ecological
process can be recognised in the differentiation between the two sister species, where en plus
reproductive isolation between the two gene pools occurred, allowing independent drift and
mutation accumulation in neutral genetic characters.

Background
Pogonus chalceus is a wing polymorphic beetle with
extremely variable wing size from short to completely
developed wings, with all possible intermediates [1]. A
recent study presented population genetic results on P.
chalceus (Marsham, 1802) beetles from the Guérande saltfields on the French Atlantic coast, based on allozymes

and microsatellites, as well as results on wing and body
size [2]. In the unique man made Guérande salt-fields,
two contrasting habitat types are found mixed on a microscale in hundreds of replicates (sea canal versus salt extraction ponds). Body, relative wing size and IDH1 allozyme
alleles are strongly divergent between these two contrasting microhabitats; divergent selection led to two clearly

distinguishable ecotypes, respectively adapted to canal
and pond habitat. Comparisons between the Guérande
region (microscale) and populations along the Atlantic
coast (macroscale) confirmed the generality of the
hypothesis regarding ecological processes responsible for
this differentiation: habitat stability [2]. The Guérande
ecotypes are also slightly differentiated based on neutral
molecular markers (microsatellites and allozymes), suggesting that partial barriers to gene flow between the two
ecotypes are present. Previous work on a wide range of
taxa has demonstrated that strong natural selection can
lead to divergence in spite of gene flow [3-7]. Our
Guérande results can therefore be interpreted as a case of
ongoing speciation driven by natural selection adapting
each ecotype to its respective ecological niche, i.e. species
in status nascenti (see also [8,9]).
In the same Guérande region and along the European
Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, another Pogonus species, P. littoralis (Duftschmid, 1812) lives in a third kind of
microhabitat: unvegetated, temporary dry salt marsh
ponds or creeks, where it lives between cracks in humid
sea clay. This species is, in contrast to P. chalceus, constantly macropterous, always with maximally developed
wings and functional flight musculature [10]. The beetle is
highly mobile because it regularly has to move between
temporarily dry salt marsh ponds and creeks during its life
cycle. Both species can be hardly distinguished by external
morphology (for example large individuals of P. chalceus
versus small P. littoralis) but have clearly distinguishable
genitalia.
The data in this article are to some extent compiled from
previous works [2,11,12]. Nevertheless, the novelty of this
study lies in the fact for the first time the two carabid sister
species are analyzed jointly allowing for valuable comparisons to be made. In this study, we will first compare the
two ecotypes of Pogonus chalceus with the closely related
species, Pogonus littoralis at a microscale (Guérande
region). Therefore, we will use population data on wing
and body size, IDH1 allozyme polymorphism as well as
apparently neutral markers (other allozymes and
mtDNA). We will also test if the microscale results are
valid at a larger scale across Europe by means of an independent data set of different populations of both Pogonus
species. In all of these cases, we will evaluate the contribution of intra population, inter population, inter ecotype
and interspecific variation to the total variance.

Results
Body size
Fig. 1 shows male body size for both P. chalceus ecotypes
and for the P. littoralis populations in the Guérande region
[see also additional file 1]. Mean body size for the pond
populations is small (3.56; range: 2.9–4.2), intermediate

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/3/1/4

for the canal populations (4.08; 3.4–4.6) and high for the
P. littoralis populations (4.69; range: 3.9–5.1). Body size
values for the females show a similar pattern but are
always larger than male body sizes. Mean female body
size is 3.91 for the canal populations (range: 3.4–4.3),
4.52 for the pond populations (range: 3.4–5.0) and 4.89
for the P. littoralis populations (range: 4.3–5.3).
Fig. 1 also shows male and female body sizes for the P.
chalceus ecological groups and for the P. littoralis populations on a European scale [see also additional file 2].
Mean male body size is small for the stable (3.68; range:
3.2–4.3) and intermediate P. chalceus populations (3.68;
range 3–4.3), somewhat higher for the temporary populations (mean: 3.92; range: 3.4–4.6) and high for the P. littoralis (mean: 4.32; range: 3.6–4.8) ones. Body size values
of females show again a similar pattern and are always
larger than male body sizes. Mean female body size is 4.04
for the stable P. chalceus populations (range: 3.2 to 4.6)
compared to 4.11 for the intermediate populations
(range: 3.1 to 4.7) and 4.3 for the temporary P. chalceus
populations (range: 3.4 to 4.8) and 4.6 for the P. littoralis
populations (4.1–5.2).
In the Guérande region and considering the two species
(nested design ANOVA; six P. chalceus populations (canals
and ponds pooled) versus three P. littoralis populations,
the major part of variance (based on body size) is found
among species (Table 1; 74.24% for males and 51.96% for
females). If we consider three groups (three canal populations (P. chalceus), three pond populations (P. chalceus)
and three P. littoralis populations, the major part of variance is even more pronouncedly found among groups
(84.96% for males and 72.08% for females). Variance
among populations within groups considering three
groups instead of two drops from 17.5 to 2.35% for males
and from 29.57 to 4.28% for females. This indicates that
this variance was almost completely due to the differences
in body size between populations of P. chalceus from different microhabitats. All variance components are statistically significant.
On a European scale and considering the two species (25
P. chalceus populations versus six P. littoralis), the major
part of variance (based on body size) is found among species (Table 1; 68.37% for males and 48.37% for females).
If we consider four ecological groups (14 temporary (P.
chalceus), five intermediate (P. chalceus), six stable (P. chalceus) and five P. littoralis), the variance among groups
drops (49.39% for males and 33.87% for females) and the
variance within populations augments (45.62% for males
and 58.53% for females). Variance among populations
within groups considering four groups instead of two
drops a little from 10.13 to 5% for males and from 12.29

Relative wing size
Fig. 2 shows male and female relative wing sizes for both
P. chalceus microhabitats and for the P. littoralis populations in the Guérande region [see also additional file 1].
Mean male relative wing size for the canal populations is
small (28.19; range: 20–35%), intermediate for the ponds
(mean: 64.24; range: 25–82.5%) and high for the P. littoralis populations (mean: 103.59; range: 92.5–112.5%).
Relative wing size values of females show a similar pattern
and are not larger than male relative wing sizes. Mean
female relative wing size for the canals is 26.93 (range:
17.5–32.5%), 62.31 for the ponds (range: 25–80%) and
103.04 for the P. littoralis populations (range: 92.5–
110%).

Fig. 2 also shows male and female relative wing size in
ecological groups of P. chalceus and of P. littoralis populations on a European scale [see also additional file 2].
Mean male relative wing size is small for the populations
of the old, highly stable salt marsh areas (35.28; range:
22.5–62.5%), some higher for the populations of the salt
marshes of intermediate stability (mean: 51.07; range:
25–85%), higher for the populations of the small, unstable areas (mean: 82.23, range: 27.5–105%) and very high
for the P. littoralis populations (mean: 106.16; range: 90–
112.5%). Relative wing size values of females show a similar pattern and are not larger or smaller than male relative
wing sizes. Mean female relative wing size for the stable
populations is 33.43 (range: 20–82.5%) compared to
49.91 for the populations of intermediate stability situations (range: 25–85%), 80.41 for the temporary populations of the highly unstable salt marshes (range: 40–

97.5%) and 107 for the P. littoralis populations (range:
92.5–115%).
In the Guérande region and considering the two species
(nested design ANOVA; six P. chalceus populations (canals
and ponds pooled) and three P. littoralis populations), the
major part of variance (based on relative wing size) is
found among species (Table 2; 78.84% for males and
80.37% for females). If we consider three groups (three
canal populations (P. chalceus), three pond populations
(P. chalceus) and three P. littoralis populations), the major
part of variance is even more clearly found among groups
(95.48% for males and 93.92% for females). Variance
among populations within groups considering three
groups instead of two drops from 18.64 to 0.64% for
males and from 16.21 to 0.8% for females. This indicates
that this variance is almost completely due to the differences in relative wing size between populations of P. chalceus from different microhabitats. All variance
components are statistically significant.
On a European scale and considering the two species (25
P. chalceus populations versus six P. littoralis populations),
the major part of variance (based on relative wing size) is
found among species (Table 2; 57.61% for males and
60.16% for females). If we consider four ecological groups
(14 temporary (P. chalceus), five intermediate (P. chalceus), six stable (P. chalceus) and six P. littoralis populations), the major part of variance is again even more
pronounced among groups (82.22% for males and
82.58% for females). Variance among populations within
groups considering four groups instead of two drops from
36.11 to 6.34% for males and from 32.8 to 6.89% for
females. This indicates that this variance is again almost
completely due to the differences in relative wing size
between populations of P. chalceus from different ecological or salt marsh area stability groups. All variance components are statistically significant.

IDH1 allozyme marker
In Guérande, both Idh1-2 and Idh1-4 alleles are frequent
in ponds, whereas canals are nearly fixed at Idh1-4 (Fig.
3A) [see also additional file 1]. P. littoralis populations are
fixed at the Idh1-6 allele. Allele Idh1-1, Idh1-3, and Idh1-5
are very rare in P. chalceus and therefore not shown in Figure 4. Considering the two species (AMOVA; six P. chalceus populations (canals and ponds pooled) and three P.
littoralis), the major part of variance (based on IDH1) is
found among groups (Table 3; 61.93%). If we consider
three groups (three canal populations (P. chalceus), three
pond populations (P. chalceus) and three P. littoralis populations, the major part of variance is still found among
groups (64.25%). Variance among populations within
groups considering three groups instead of two drops
from 11.49 to 0.1%. This indicates that this variance is
almost completely due to differences in IDH1 between
populations of P. chalceus from different microhabitats.
All variance components are statistically significant.

At a European scale, both Idh1-2 and Idh1-4 alleles are
frequent in the intermediate stability populations,
whereas the temporary populations are nearly fixed at the
Idh1-2 allele and the stable populations at the Idh1-4
allele (Fig. 3B) [see also additional file 2]. P. littoralis populations are fixed at the Idh1-6 allele. Considering two
groups (25 P. chalceus populations versus six P. littoralis
populations, the major part of variance (based on IDH1)
is found among groups (Table 3; 62.29%). If we consider
four ecological groups (14 temporary (P. chalceus), five
intermediately stable (P. chalceus), six highly stable (P.
chalceus) and six P. littoralis populations, the major part
of variance is somewhat lower but is still found among
groups (53.26%). Variance among populations within
groups, considering four groups instead of two, drops
from 12.26 to 2.07%. This indicates that this variance is
almost completely due to differences in IDH1 between
populations of P. chalceus from different ecological

Mitochondrial DNA
The 459-bp COI mitochondrial sequences revealed two
haplotypes in the Guérande region. Haplotype one was
shared by individuals of both canal and pond ecotype.
Haplotype two was exclusive to the canal ecotype (Table
4). The 497-bp 16S sequences revealed only one haplotype in the Guérande region (Table 5).

The 459-bp COI sequences included 32 variable sites on a
European scale (29 parsimony informative) and revealed
nine unique haplotypes (four for P. chalceus and five for P.
littoralis, with no haplotype shared by the two species).
Most haplotypes were exclusive to a particular sampling
site, with the exception of haplotype one and three which
appeared in eight different localities, and haplotype five,
which was found in three localities (Table 4). Selective

neutrality was confirmed for this gene (P > 0.1 for all test
statistics with D* and F*).
The neighbour joining tree in Figure 5 shows that both
species form clearly separated entities (high bootstrap values). Differences are found in 28 positions between haplotypes 5,6,8,9 (P. littoralis) and haplotypes 1 and 2 (P.
chalceus; Table 4). 27 base differences are found between
haplotypes 5,6,8,9 and haplotypes 3 and 4 (P. chalceus).
27 base differences are found between haplotype 7 (P. littoralis) and haplotypes 1,2 (P. chalceus) and 26 base differences with haplotypes 3,4 (P. chalceus). Intrapopulation
differences in both P. chalceus and P. littoralis are very
small (only a limited number of individuals studied) and
between each haplotype there are only one to at most two
bases different.
The 497-bp 16S sequences included 11 variable sites (9
parsimony informative) and revealed three unique haplotypes (Table 5; two for P. chalceus and one for P. littoralis,

with no haplotype shared by the two species). Only one
haplotype was exclusive to a particular sampling site (haplotype two). Haplotype one appeared in all 11 P. chalceus
localities, and haplotype three appeared in all three P. littoralis sites. Selective neutrality was confirmed for this
gene (P > 0.1 for all test statistics with D* and F*). Both
species form, as in the case for COI, clearly separated entities (Table 5). 10 base differences are found between haplotype 3 (P. littoralis) and haplotypes 1 and 2 (P. chalceus).
Interpopulation differences in both P. chalceus are very
small (between the two haplotypes there is only one base

different). There were no interpopulation differences
found in P. littoralis.

Discussion
Pogonus littoralis and Pogonus chalceus are closely related
species, sometimes relatively hard to identify without dissection of the genitalia. We are interested to study the evolutionary processes in and between these presumably
young species. We therefore compare the degree of
intraspecific variation (in ecological groups of P. chalceus)
and the degree of interspecific variation (P. chalceus versus

P. littoralis) between a variety of morphological characteristics and molecular markers. In all of these cases, we did
this with an ANOVA splitting up the total variance among
groups, among populations within groups and within
populations (Table 6).
At both geographical scales and considering two groups
(P. chalceus populations versus P. littoralis populations), a
very large part of the total variance (based on body size,
relative wing size, IDH1 and four neutral allozymes) is
found between species (summary in Table 6). The study of
the two mitochondrial genes also shows that both species
form clearly separated entities. It is clear that relative wing
size differences as well as genetic differences between the
sister species P. chalceus and P. littoralis (interspecific) in
this study are very marked and allow an easy species recognition.
Body size, relative wing size and IDH1 allozyme data in
the beetle P. chalceus are also strongly divergent between
contrasting microhabitats (intraspecific: two ecotypes in
Guérande) as well as between three ecological groups at
macroscale (highly stable versus intermediately stable and
temporary populations; [2] and this study). If we consider
four groups on a macroscale (3 groups in P. chalceus + 1
group of P. littoralis) or three groups on a microscale (2
ecotypes in P. chalceus + 1 group of P. littoralis), the variance among populations within groups drops drastically
as compared to the analysis of two groups (all P. chalceus
populations versus P. littoralis; based again on body size,
relative wing size and IDH1; summary in Table 6). This
study clearly shows that the intraspecific variation based
on those three characteristics in P. chalceus is very high and
in the same order of magnitude as the degree of interspecific variation (P. chalceus versus P. littoralis). We have suggested earlier that this huge phenotypic and IDH1

divergence in P. chalceus has been driven by divergent natural selection [2]. As relative wing size is to a large extent
genetically determined [1], this indeed suggests divergent
selection between populations. And the observation that
the IDH1 locus screened within our samples shows alelic
differences between habitats strongly suggests a locus
undergoing evolution through natural selection. Moreover, the canal and pond microhabitats differ from each
other with respect to temperature, salinity and water level
fluctuations [2]. Numerous studies based on allozymes
have revealed patterns of allelic distribution associated
with environmental factors, such as temperature and
salinity [13,14]. Regarding the function of IDH1, the
enzyme catalyses the rate-limiting step of the tricarboxylate cycle. Possible links with growth, however, are not
direct and could be associated with the energy that is produced from the reaction. Divergent selection can lead to
reproductive isolation and assortative mating and ultimately to speciation [8,15].
On the other hand, in a previously study was shown that
P. chalceus ecotypes in the Guérande region were only
slightly differentiated (based on allozyme and microsatellite markers) compared to the results based on adaptive
characteristics [2]. The smaller degree of intraspecific
divergence is also reflected in the mitochondrial data from
this study. Moreover, allozyme and mtDNA data from this
study show that the populations of P. chalceus are much
more related to each other than to their sister species P. littoralis both on a micro- and macroscale. Often, little or no
genetic divergence is found in neutral markers between
ecologically and morphologically differentiated populations [3-5,7,16-18]. Our results can be interpreted as a
case of ongoing speciation in P. chalceus where divergence
reflects a balance between selection and gene flow (see
also [2]). Several studies suggest that tital marshes may be
an appropriate ecotone in which to search for instances of
ecological speciation. The studied species show, as is the
case in our study, distinct morphological differences
despite little divergence in molecular markers [7,19-21].
In view of the above shown analogy between intra- and
interspecific variation, it seems reasonable to assume that
the same ecological adaptive bifurcation was also the first
step in the speciation process of P. chalceus and P. littoralis.
The speciation process was here fully accomplished by the
reproductive isolation between the two groups, allowing
independent drift and mutation accumulation in neutral
genetic characters.

Methods
Sampling
P. chalceus populations from three different sites in the
Guérande region are analysed (microscale; Fig. 5; see also
[2]). Each site consists of two drastically differing micro-

Geographical distribution of the studied populations of Pogonus chalceus and Pogonus littoralis
Geographical distribution of the studied populations of Pogonus chalceus and Pogonus littoralis. The following population codes were used: 1:FRI; 2:BRA; 3:WAT; 4:MOK; 5:ZWC; 6:HEI; 7:LIS; 8:OOS; 9:NIE; 10:MOE; 11:SEA; 12:CAN;

populations were sampled from all indicated numbers (1–25). P. littoralis were sampled in the populations with number 5, 13,
15, 19, 20 and 21. The detailed map is the Guérande region containing three studied P. chalceus pond populations (POND1,
POND2, POND3), three P. chalceus canal populations (CANAL1, CANAL2, CANAL3) and three P. littoralis populations
(GUE1, GUE2, GUE3).

habitats, situated only 10–20 metres from each other and
separated by one or two dikes. We compare P. chalceus
populations from three canals (CANAL1; CANAL2;
CANAL3: Fig. 5) to three adjacent pond populations
(POND1; POND2, POND3; see also [2]). Furthermore,
we analyse Guérande P. littoralis populations from three
different sites (GUE1, GUE2, GUE3; Fig. 5; see also [12])
nearby the aforementioned P. chalceus population couples.
The two related species are also studied on a macroscale
with completely independent population samples
(Guérande populations not included). Data on P. chalceus

populations from the Netherlands (FRI), Belgium (BRA,
WAT, MOK, ZWC, HEI, LIS, OOS, NIE, MOE), England
(SEA), France (CAN, AUT, SOM, MSM, VEY, GAC, GIR,
TOU, CAM, ROU), and Spain (IBI, ALB, MUR, ALM; Fig.
5; see also [11,22]. For P. littoralis, six populations are analysed here, five of them from France (AUT, MSM, TOU,
CAM, ROU; [12]). From these sites in France, we also sampled P. chalceus populations (see above). In Belgium, P.
littoralis is critically endangered and the previous record
went back to 1956 and was from Ostend [23]. Recently, a
supposed new P. littoralis population has been discovered
in Belgium and is also included here (Fig. 5; ZWC). Populations of P. chalceus on a European scale were assigned

to belong to one of three different salt marsh area stability
types: temporary (BRA, WAT, MOK, HEI, LIS, OOS, MOE,
TOU, CAM, ROU, IBI, ALB, MUR, ALM), intermediate
(ZWC, NIE, MSM, FRI, AUT) and stable (SEA, CAN, SOM,
VEY, GAC, GIR; see also [2,11]. Temporary populations of
P. chalceus are situated in the Mediterranean part of
Europe or occur in small (<4 ha) and young (<400 years)
Atlantic salt marshes. Stable and intermediate populations live in larger marshes situated along the Atlantic
coast. The only difference between both salt marsh areas
is their estimated age (Stable: >1000 years; Intermediate:
between 400–1000 years). The age of salt marshes was
estimated using historical information [24-27].
Morphological analysis
Body size (elytral length) and wing size were measured by
means of a calibrated ocular under a binocular microscope. Generally, carabid wing size follows an allometric
relationship with body size. [28] developed an index that
corrects for this allometry, i.e. percentage of maximal realisable relative wing size. Relative wing size is wing length
× width divided by elytral length × width. Relative wing
size is then expressed as a percentage of the maximal wing
size for a beetle of a given size. This index was shown to
be an unbiased estimator for comparing different individuals, populations and species of carabid beetles [28]. In
ground beetles, females are generally larger than males.
Therefore, we analyse male and female body sizes separately. To be complete, we analyse female and male relative wing size also separately. Body size and relative wing
size are compared between species and populations with
ANOVA's. Total variance is partitioned among groups
(species or species and ecotypes), among populations
within groups, and within populations by carrying out a
nested design ANOVA using STATISTICA (version 7.1;
StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, UK) on both a micro- and macroscale.

Genetic divergence
Data are used from five polymorphic enzymes: aldehyde
oxidase (AO, E.C. 1.2.3.1), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI, E.C. 5.3.1.9), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2
(IDH1, IDH2, E.C. 1.1.1.42), phosphoglucomutase
(PGM, E.C. 2.7.5.1.). Protocols of electrophoresis are provided by [29]. Earlier work showed that one locus (IDH1)
was non-neutral and we will always analyse it separately
[11].

Departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectation were tested with an exact test using the GENEPOP
software (Version 3.2; [30]). Significance levels were
adjusted by using sequential Bonferroni correction. Similarly as in the analyses for body and wing size, total
genetic variance is partitioned among groups (species,
ecotypes), among populations within groups, and within
populations by carrying out a hierarchical analysis of
molecular variance (AMOVA) using ARLEQUIN (version
3.000; [31]) on both a micro- and macroscale.
PCRs for nucleotide sequencing of COI utilized primers
C1-J-1718 and C1-N-2191 and for 16S we utilized primers LR-J-1307 and LR-N-13398 [32]. DNA amplification
reactions were performed in a 25 µL final volume. Each
reaction mix contained 5 µL of extract, 1× buffer (Sigma),
1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM of each dNTP, 0.4 µM of each
primer and 0.6 U RedTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma). Initial denaturation was for 2 min at 95°C, followed by 35
cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min 30 s at 48°C (and 46°C for
16S), and 2 min at 72°C; 9 min at 72°C completed the
program. The reaction was purified with columns following manufacturer's recommendations. Sequencing was
done by BigDye Terminator version 3.1 kits on an ABI
3130 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were
aligned using BioEdit version 5.0.6 [33]. We tested for
