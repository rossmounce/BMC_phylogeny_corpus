Abstract
Background: Linear motifs (LMs) are abundant short regulatory sites used for modulating the
functions of many eukaryotic proteins. They play important roles in post-translational modification,
cell compartment targeting, docking sites for regulatory complex assembly and protein processing
and cleavage. Methods for LM detection are now being developed that are strongly dependent on
scores for motif conservation in homologous proteins. However, most LMs are found in natively
disordered polypeptide segments that evolve rapidly, unhindered by structural constraints on the
sequence. These regions of modular proteins are difficult to align using classical multiple sequence
alignment programs that are specifically optimised to align the globular domains. As a consequence,
poor motif alignment quality is hindering efforts to detect new LMs.
Results: We have developed a new benchmark, as part of the BAliBASE suite, designed to assess
the ability of standard multiple alignment methods to detect and align LMs. The reference
alignments are organised into different test sets representing real alignment problems and contain
examples of experimentally verified functional motifs, extracted from the Eukaryotic Linear Motif
(ELM) database. The benchmark has been used to evaluate and compare a number of multiple
alignment programs. With distantly related proteins, the worst alignment program correctly aligns
48% of LMs compared to 73% for the best program. However, the performance of all the programs
is adversely affected by the introduction of other sequences containing false positive motifs. The
ranking of the alignment programs based on LM alignment quality is similar to that observed when
considering full-length protein alignments, however little correlation was observed between LM
and overall alignment quality for individual alignment test cases.
Conclusion: We have shown that none of the programs currently available is capable of reliably
aligning LMs in distantly related sequences and we have highlighted a number of specific problems.
The results of the tests suggest possible ways to improve program accuracy for difficult, divergent
sequences.

Background
Many eukaryotic proteins have highly modular architectures. Multidomain proteins are usual for transmembrane
receptors, signalling proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, chromatin proteins, transcription factors and so forth. As a
consequence, many programs have been developed for
the detection and alignment of protein domains. Online
resources can now provide a good overview of the globular domain architecture of a polypeptide sequence and the
functions these domains are likely to perform, e.g. Pfam
[1], SMART [2], Interpro [3]. However, less research has
been directed towards the analysis of the large segments of
multidomain proteins that are non-globular, intrinsically
lacking the capability to fold into a defined tertiary structure [4,5]. Sometimes such regions may simply act as linkers connecting globular domains and in this case, the
sequence of amino acids is not critical to function. Very
often, however, these unstructured regions contain
important functional sites such as protein interaction
sites, cell compartment targeting signals, post-translational modification sites or cleavage sites. Large parts of
many proteins, such as the insulin receptor substrates, or
sometimes even the entire protein, such as the Alzheimer's protein Tau [6], are natively unstructured. The functional sites within these unstructured regions can often be
defined as short, linear motifs (LMs) – linear in the sense
that only the local peptide sequence is relevant to function. In order to avoid confusion, in this paper we will use
the term 'sequence' to refer to the full-length protein,
while a specific region of a protein sequence will be
referred to as a 'segment' or a 'motif'. The Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource (ELM) has entries describing ~130 varieties of linear motif [7], but it is not fully comprehensive
with respect to current literature and it has been estimated
that hundreds more have yet to be discovered [8]. When
eubacterial, archaebacterial and viral motifs are also considered, the true number of unknown functionally important LMs is likely to be huge. Given the fundamental roles
these motifs play in cell regulation and signalling, identifying these motifs will be of crucial importance in many
biological disciplines.
Until recently, and in stark contrast to protein domain discovery, the bioinformatics field has had a negligible
impact on LM discovery: motif discovery is generally performed by low throughput experimental delineation of
protein interaction segments. The central problem confounding computational methods has been the lack of
significance of motif matches when searching sequence
databases, making it impossible to confidently identify all
the motifs present in a given protein sequence by simple
sequence analysis tools. The majority of LMs are between
3 and 10 amino acids in length and most have one or
more ambiguous (variable) or wildcard (totally variable)
residues. Their short and degenerate nature makes real

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/213

LMs difficult to distinguish from the background distribution of randomly occurring false positive motifs. Nevertheless, efforts are now underway to develop
bioinformatics tools that will contribute to the linear
motif discovery problem. As a first step, it is necessary to
catalogue linear motifs and particular instances that are
known to be functional. Such data collections include the
eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) resource [7] and ScanSite
[9]. A number of tools have been developed, e.g. ELM [7],
QuasiMotiFinder [10], MiniMotif [11] and the ACS
method [12], that employ various methods, such as
domain masking and evolutionary filtering respectively,
to discover new occurrences of previously known motifs.
Other methods, such as the LMD method [8] (implemented in the web server DILIMOT [13]), SLiMDisc [14],
SLiMFinder [15] and Miner [16], explicitly attempt novel
LM discovery using large scale interaction datasets and/or
motif conservation.
One of the major limitations in predicting short linear
motifs is the evaluation of the many potential motifs
found in each protein, to distinguish between true functional sites and incorrect occurrences of a given pattern. In
the worst case, there are motifs which have such low support and low information content as to be almost indistinguishable from random noise in most datasets, e.g. the
PCSK cleavage site K/RR [17] which plays a role in proteolytic processing of neuropeptide and peptide hormone
precursors, or the peroxisomal targeting motif WxxxY/F
(where x represents any arbitrary amino acid) [18]. It is
vitally important, therefore, to develop novel scoring
methods or to consider other information, such as contextual information, e.g. loop region, N/C-terminus, cellular
localisation, if such data is available, or evolutionary
information, since motifs conserved during evolution are
more likely to be functional. Conservation has been
shown to be an essential factor in the prediction of functional motifs. For example, many motif discovery systems,
such as LMD, QuasiMotiFinder Miner, MiniMotif and the
ACS method use a combination of traditional motif scores
and evolutionary conservation to rank potential motifs. It
is worth pointing out though, that while LMD explicitly
utilises conservation, the method used is alignment-free
and, as such, would not be affected by the developments
described in this article. SLiMFinder and SLiMDisc make
use of automated multiple alignments and conservation
scores to help visualise and interpret results. We have also
recently developed a rapid automated conservation scoring pipeline suitable for real time operation in the ELM
resource [19].
It follows therefore that, in order to exploit evolutionary
information optimally, we need to construct multiple
sequence alignments of the highest quality. LMs that
occur in several different phyla should appear as short

patches of conservation in this alignment. However, a
large majority of LMs are found in the natively disordered
regions [20] that are difficult to align using classical multiple sequence alignment programs, which are better
adapted to protein domain alignments. The biological relevance of the alignments produced by these programs is
usually assessed by systematic comparison with established benchmark sets, e.g. BAliBASE [21], Prefab [22] or
Sabmark [23], based on 3D structure superpositions of
globular domains. The introduction of these objective
benchmarks has had a considerable effect on the evolution of alignment algorithms and has led to a significant
improvement in overall multiple alignment quality [24].
However, there is also a risk that alignment software optimised on structure superpositions has been overfitted to
globular domains and may not adequately account for
awkward features of full length protein sequences, such as
N- and C-terminal extensions and motif-rich non-globular sequence segments. Therefore, to evaluate the ability of
multiple alignment methods to identify and align LMs,
new test sets are now needed. Benchmarks have already
been developed for motif discovery in genomic DNA
sequences, such as transcription factor binding sites, e.g.
[25], but these benchmarks are not generally organised
into evolutionarily related sets that might be used to evaluate multiple sequence alignment programs. Another reference database, IRMBASE [26], consists of simulated
conserved motifs implanted into non-related artificial
protein sequences. However, this benchmark does not
reflect the problems associated with identifying and aligning the short linear motifs that are essential for the function of real multimodular proteins.
The main objective of the work presented here is to provide a standard way to assess the ability of a multiple
alignment program to correctly align the linear motifs
occurring in a set of related sequences. However, if the
multiple alignment is to be used in a subsequent motif
discovery system, it is important that (i) the sequences
containing the motif should be accurately aligned and (ii)
the sequences that do not contain the motif should not be
aligned in the corresponding region. To address these
issues, we have developed a new Reference Set that has
been incorporated in the BAliBASE benchmark suite [21].
The benchmark includes example multiple alignments for
most of the motifs annotated in the ELM resource [7]. For
each LM, a representative set of homologous sequences
has been selected and a multiple alignment of the complete sequences (MACS) has been constructed and manually refined. A number of different test subsets are
provided, representing typical scenarios and problems
that occur when trying to align the motifs in the context of
a global multiple alignment.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/213

Using the new BAliBASE Reference Set, we then evaluated
the accuracy of the motif alignments obtained from a
number of widely used or recently developed multiple
alignment programs. The performance of the different
programs was assessed by comparing the alignments constructed by each program with the reference alignments.
We show that none of the programs currently available is
capable of reliably aligning LMs in distantly related
sequences and we highlight a number of specific problems. This will hopefully generate interest in developing
new algorithms and should provide program developers
with guidelines for future enhancements that will
improve the quality of motif alignments.

Methods
The new Reference Set in the BAliBASE benchmark contains multiple alignments of sequences with functional
linear motifs (LMs). To avoid confusion, the term
'sequence' will be used to refer to the full-length protein,
while a specific region of a protein sequence will be
referred to as a 'segment' or a 'motif'. The alignments are
constructed from a set of reference sequences with experimentally verified motifs, known as ELM motif instances,
extracted from the ELM database [7]. Putative functional
sites in ELM are identified by patterns (regular expressions) that are similar to PROSITE patterns [27]. Although
the ELM regular expressions are highly discriminative and
provide a useful resource for the identification of functional LMs, these regular expressions are not 100% accurate and may either (i) exclude true motifs or (ii) may find
false, but apparently plausible, motif matches [7]. For this
study, the 406 motif instances in the ELM database associated with experimental evidence were extracted. They
correspond to the 123 different linear motifs (different
regular expressions) present in the ELM version I-2007.
For each reference sequence containing an ELM motif
instance, a semi-automatic protocol has been developed
to detect related sequences in the UniProt [28] protein
database, and to construct a 'primary' multiple alignment
that is then used to select suitable sequences for each subset in the Reference Set. A general overview of the protocol
is shown in the flowchart in figure 1.
Primary multiple alignments
For each reference sequence containing an ELM motif
instance, the first step involves the detection of similar
sequences in the Uniprot database [28] and the construction of a multiple alignment of the complete sequences,
using the following protocol:

(i) The Uniprot database is searched using the BlastP program [29] with the full-length reference sequence as query
and all sequences detected with E < 10-3 are initially
selected.

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:213

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/213

(iv) Finally, the automatic multiple alignment is manually verified and refined to assure the accurate alignment
of the potential motifs with the current motif instance. A
number of factors were taken into account during the
manual validation, including the MACSIMS functional
annotations, the presence of known globular domains or
functional sites or the presence of conserved sequence segments close to the instance LM. The globular domains
were generally well aligned by the PipeAlign toolkit and
the manual refinement was limited to the potential LMs,
identified by the ELM regular expressions. Low complexity
regions were not realigned, as these could not be validated
in most cases. During the manual refinement, any
sequences containing motifs that could not be validated
unambiguously were removed from the multiple alignment. These included motifs occurring in unrelated proteins (i.e. sharing no globular domains with the query
sequence) and sequences with multiple occurrences of a
motif, where the correspondence with the ELM motif
instance was uncertain.
Selection of reference primary alignments
Each Primary multiple alignment contains the complete
set of sequences detected by BlastP, that share some similarity with the query sequence. In order to construct
benchmark test sets, sequences are selected that correspond to a certain number of criteria. The following protocol is used to identify suitable alignments and
sequences:

Figure 1

Flow-chart showing the 3 major steps of the protocol used
to construct the BAliBASE Reference Set 9.

(ii) The selected full-length sequences are aligned using
the PipeAlign [30] protein family analysis toolkit to construct a Multiple Alignment of Complete Sequences
(MACS). At this stage, sequences that do not contain any
regions considered to be homologous to the reference
sequence are removed from the MACS, using the LEON
program [31].
(iii) The sequences in the MACS are then annotated using
the MACSIMS information management system [32].
MACSIMS mines information from the public databases,
including known structural domains, functional sites and
other motifs. At the same time, a number of prediction
algorithms are run to detect sequence features, including
transmembrane regions, low-complexity segments and
disordered regions. At this stage, all motifs that match the
ELM regular expressions are also identified and annotated
using a Perl script.

(i) In order to reduce the size of the test sets, redundant
sequences sharing >80% residue identity that are easy to
align, are removed in a clustering step, based on the multiple sequence alignment.
(ii) True positive, false positive and false negative motifs
are defined (see figure 2). A true positive motif corresponds to a motif that matches the ELM regular expression, and that occurs in a region that can be aligned on the
motif instance. A false positive motif is a motif that
matches the ELM regular expression, but that is detected
in a region that does not align on the motif instance. In
contrast, a false negative motif is defined as a sequence
segment that can be aligned unambiguously in the region
of the motif instance, but that does not match the ELM
regular expression. In the example shown in figure 2, the
motif in P49866 is defined as a 'false negative', since it can
be aligned unambiguously with other sequences
(Q4H3D5 and Q3UP48) that do match the ELM regular
expression. Sequences that do not contain any matches to
the ELM regular expression and that cannot be aligned
manually in the region of the motif instance are also
included in the primary alignments. It should be noted
that this classification of true positive, false positive and
false negative motifs refers to the current motif instance

Page 4 of 15

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:213

only, based on the presence of a match to the ELM regular
expression and the quality of the alignment in this region.
The classification is useful for the purposes of this study,
but it does not imply anything about the alignment of the
motifs at other positions, nor does it imply anything
about the functionality of the motifs, which cannot be
assessed exclusively by sequence analysis tools. The false
positive motifs provide a control to avoid over-optimisation of multiple alignment algorithms when using the
Reference Set as a benchmark, since aligning the false positive matches on the ELM motif instance will lead to a misalignment of the globular regions in the sequences (see
examples in figure 2). The false negative motifs are important because, given their amino acid sequence they should
be aligned on the motif instance, even if they do not
match the ELM regular expression.
(iii) Primary alignments containing less than 5 sequences
with true positive motifs were excluded from the benchmark.
(iv) Finally, primary alignments with at least one
sequence in common were merged together to form a single reference alignment. This step is necessary because the
original set of query sequences contains a certain number
of homologous sequences, resulting in an overlap
between the corresponding sets of BlastP detected
sequences.
Construction of reference subsets
The reference primary alignments are then divided into 4
Subsets, designed to evaluate the accuracy of multiple
alignment algorithms under different conditions. Subsets

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/213

1–4 are constructed by automatically selecting the
sequences from the Primary multiple alignment that correspond to a number of specific criteria.
(i) For Subset 1, only sequences with validated LMs (true
positive or false negative motifs) are selected. Additional
"false positive" motifs that match the ELM regular expression may be present at other positions in the alignment,
as long as the LM corresponding to the motif instance can
be identified unambiguously. The subset is further organised into three different groups, according to sequence
variability: <20% identity, 20–40% identity and 40–80%
identity.
(ii) Subsets 2–4 include the sequences in Subset 1,
together with additional sequences that cannot be aligned
in the region of the motif instance. These additional
sequences may cause problems for automatic multiple
alignment programs:é Subset 2 includes additional sequences that share some
homology with the reference sequence, but that have possible 'errors' (badly predicted sequences, fragments, splicing variants) in the region of the motif instance. Although
these 'error' sequences do not contain a validated LM, they
may or may not contain false positive matches to the ELM
regular expression elsewhere in the sequence.
é Subset 3 includes additional sequences with false positive matches to the ELM regular expression, that are found
at other positions in the alignment and do not correspond
to the motif instance.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/213

é Subset 4 includes additional sequences that do not have
any examples of the LM, either in the region of the motif
instance or elsewhere in the alignment.
(iii) For each alignment in the benchmark, the validated
LMs aligned on the motif instance are characterised
according to three different features:
• Structural context (globular versus disordered regions).
Globular segments were predicted using the IUPred program [33]. IUPred estimates the capacity of polypeptides
to form stabilizing contacts. The underlying assumption is
that globular proteins make a large number of interresidue interactions, providing the stabilizing energy to overcome the entropy loss during folding. In contrast,
disordered regions are assumed to have special sequences
that do not have the capacity to form sufficient interresidue interactions.
• Motif conservation. Motifs are defined as 'conserved' if
all the true positive sequences in the multiple alignment
share at least one conserved residue. Motifs in which no
residues are conserved are defined as 'variable' motifs. The
conservation is calculated based only on the validated
motifs present in the multiple alignment, and does not
necessarily correspond to non-wildcard positions in the
motif regular expression.
• Motif length (number of residues in the motif instance,
including wildcard positions).
Definition of a quality score for alignment of motifs
To assess the accuracy of the programs evaluated in this
study, we calculate a sum-of-pairs score (SPS) which estimates the accuracy of the alignment of the motifs. The SPS
corresponds to the percentage of correctly aligned pairs of
residues in the alignment produced by the program. Only
the sequences with true positive or false negative motifs,
which can be aligned unambiguously in the region of the
reference motif, are taken into account. The alignment of
the other sequences has no effect on the SPS quality score.

Suppose we have a test alignment and that N sequences in
the alignment contain true positive or false negative
motifs. Suppose also that the reference motif corresponds
to M columns in the alignment. We can designate the ith
column in the alignment of the motif by Ai1, Ai2,...... AiN.
For each pair of residues Aij and Aik, we then define pijk
such that pijk = 1 if residues Aij and Aik are aligned with
each other in the reference alignment, otherwise pijk = 0.
The score Si for the ith column is defined as:
N

Si =

N

∑ ∑p

j =1, j ≠ k k =1

ijk

The SPS for the alignment is then:

M
∑ Si
SPS = i =1
Mr
∑ S ri
i =1
where Mr is the number of columns corresponding to the
reference motif and Sri is the score Si for the ith column in
the reference alignment. The score thus includes all columns in the alignment that correspond to residues in the
motif instance, including variable and wildcard positions.
For variable length motifs, positions containing gaps in
the reference alignment are ignored.
Multiple alignment programs tested
Eight different alignment programs were tested, representing the mostly widely used approaches for the construction of multiple alignments:

1. ClustalW [34] (version 1.83) performs a progressive
multiple alignment using a series of pairwise alignments
that follow the branching order in a phylogenetic tree. A
global dynamic programming algorithm is used to construct an alignment of the full length of the sequences.
2. Dialign [35] (version 2.2.1) uses an alternative 'segment-to-segment' alignment method. Segments consisting of locally conserved residue patterns or motifs, rather
than individual residues, are detected and then combined
to construct a local multiple alignment of the most conserved regions of the sequences.
3. T-Coffee [36] (version 5.05) uses information from a
pre-compiled library of different pairwise alignments
including both local and global alignments, which are
then incorporated in a global multiple alignment.
4. Mafft [37] (version 6.24) is an efficient method that
includes fast pairwise alignments, and a progressive multiple alignment strategy that uses local anchors to reduce
the area of the dynamic programming matrix that must be
computed. Here, we have tested two alternative strategies:
Mafft_fftns2 (using a fast Fourier transform at the pairwise
alignment stage and no iterative refinement) and
Mafft_linsi (using a local dynamic programming algorithm to construct more accurate pairwise alignments and
an iterative refinement method using weighted sum-ofpairs and consistency scores).
5. Muscle [24] (version 3.6) uses a similar strategy to that
developed in Mafft and includes a variety of options that
offer different trade-offs between speed and accuracy.
Muscle_fast uses k-mer counting to estimate the pairwise

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/213

sequence distances and identifies diagonals that are used
as local anchors for the progressive alignment, while the
default Muscle program uses more accurate progressive
alignment options and includes an iterative refinement
strategy.

functional motifs, known as ELM motif instances, were
used to search the protein databases for other similar
sequences and reference multiple alignments of the fulllength sequences were then constructed automatically
using the PipeAlign protein family analysis toolkit [30].
The final output from the PipeAlign system is a high-quality, validated Multiple Alignment of Complete Sequences
(MACS), in which the globular domains are accurately
aligned. However, manual validation and refinement of
the disordered regions is necessary, paying particular
attention to the conserved LMs. An example alignment is
shown in figure 2, corresponding to ELM entry
MOD_PKB_1 and representing the motif recognized by
protein kinase B (PKB/Akt/Rac-protein kinase) for serine/
threonine phosphorylation.

6. Probcons [38] (version 1.12) uses HMM-derived posterior probabilities and three-way alignment consistency in
a global, progressive alignment, together with an iterative
refinement step.
7. Kalign [39] (version 2) again follows a strategy analogous to the standard progressive method, but uses the WuManber approximate string-matching algorithm in the
sequence distance calculation.
8. Mummals [40] (version 1.01) incorporates more complex pairwise alignments based on Hidden Markov Models, and a probabilistic consistency-based progressive
multiple sequence alignment.

In order to obtain information that might be used to
improve the quality of multiple alignment programs, it is
essential to provide sets of homologous sequences with
different characteristics, representing specific problems
for the alignment algorithm. One obvious issue is the similarity of the sequences to be aligned. It has been shown
previously that multiple alignment methods can accurately align sequences that share similarity above the twilight zone of evolutionary relatedness, between 20–30%
residue identity [41]. However, other characteristics may
affect motif alignment quality, such as (i) sequence fragments, (ii) the presence of sequences containing false positive LMs that cannot be aligned on the motif instance or
(iii) the presence of related sequences that do not contain
the specific LM. In addition, alignment quality may
depend on the nature of the LM itself: in terms of motif
length, conservation and structural localisation. For these
reasons, we have designed a number of different test sets
that address these particular problems (see Methods for
details). The number of alignments in each test set in
shown in Table 1.

All the programs were installed on a Sun Enterprise V40z
server running RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 and each program was tested using default parameters and, for the purposes of this study, no optimisation of parameters such as
residue weight matrix or gap penalties was performed.
Availability
All the reference alignments are available for viewing on
the WWW at http://www-bio3d-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/bali
base and are also provided in MSF format. The annotated
alignments are also provided in XML format. A C program
is provided to estimate the accuracy of the multiple alignments constructed by different alignment programs compared to the BAliBASE references. The complete database
and the evaluation program are available for downloading by ftp from ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/
BAliBASE3/.

The different Reference subsets were then used to analyse
and compare eight different multiple alignment programs. In these tests, we concentrated on the accuracy of
alignment of the LMs, rather than the quality of the overall alignment since this has been previously assessed in a
number of different, independent studies [41,42].

Results
The ELM database [7] provides a unique source of eukaryotic sequences with experimentally verified instances of
functional motifs. These functional sites are identified by

Accuracy of motif alignment at different levels of overall
sequence similarity
The alignments in subset 1 consist of sequences that all
contain the reference LM, and are divided into 3 different
categories according to the residue similarity shared by the
sequences (V11 contains sequences with <20% identity,
V12 contains sequences with 20–40% identity and V13
contains sequences with 40–80% identity).

The first test is designed to study the effect of sequence
similarity on motif alignment accuracy and is used as the
basis for the subsequent tests. Figure 3a shows the SPS
(sum-of-pairs scores) obtained by the different programs
in the three similarity categories. A decrease in accuracy of
alignment with decreasing overall sequence similarity is
clearly observed for all the programs tested, with the greatest loss occurring in category V11 below 20% identity.
Nevertheless, some alignment is still possible below this
threshold, with most programs aligning more than 50%
of the LMs successfully. The program Probcons achieves
the highest scores in V11 with a mean of 73%, while
Mafft_linsi (67%), Mummals (66%) and Muscle (65%)
ranked next highest, although the differences are not statistically significant according to a Friedman rank sum test
(additional file 1, table 1). The worst score at this level of
identity was obtained by ClustalW, with a mean of 43%.
The results of the Friedman test, together with a more
detailed investigation of the scores obtained in category
V11 (additional file 2, figure 1) show that none of the programs tested here scores systematically higher for all alignment test cases.
Although Probcons has improved the alignment of motifs
in highly divergent sequences, it takes longer to run than
MAFFT or MUSCLE. As shown in Figure 3b, the CPU time
required to construct the complete set of alignments in
Subset 1 is 900 sec for Mafft_linsi and 1297s for Muscle,
compared to 4950 for Probcons. In a typical molecular
biology study involving the analysis of a small number of
sequences, the speed of the algorithm is generally not critical. However this may become an important deciding factor in high throughput experiments.
Further investigation of factors affecting alignment quality
The similarity of the sequences is not the only factor
affecting the accuracy of alignment of the LMs. As shown
in figure 3a, the scores obtained by all the programs are
highly variable (Inter Quartile Range from 0.44 for Probcons to 0.74 for Kalign), even when the sequences are in
the same similarity range.

In order to further investigate possible causes for this variability, the LMs in subset 1, category V11, were annotated
and classified according to three different criteria that
might have a potential effect on motif alignment accuracy.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/213

Pearson correlation coefficients (shown in Table 2) were
then calculated for the SPS quality scores obtained with
the eight different alignment programs and (i) structural
context (globular domain versus disordered region), (ii)
motif conservation (at least 1 motif position fully conserved in alignment versus all variable positions) and (iii)
motif length.
The largest correlation, for all the programs tested, is
observed with the structural context of the LM (figure 4a).
In this context, globular domains were predicted using the
IUPred [30] program. In fact, the highest SPS scores are
obtained for LMs that occur within globular domains (19
alignments) compared to the LMs found in disordered
regions (11 alignments). Somewhat surprisingly, less correlation was observed with motif conservation (figure
4b). This is probably due to the very short, degenerate
nature of most LMs, even those defined as 'conserved' (see
Methods). Although conserved motifs are generally
aligned better than variable ones, the differences are not
significant (p = 0.05).
Accuracy of motif alignment when other sequences are
included in the alignment
Here we test the degree to which the alignment of the validated LMs is disrupted by the introduction of other
sequences. Figure 5 shows the SPS scores obtained by the
different alignment programs, in the presence of a)
sequences with errors, b) sequences with false positive
motifs (sequences that have at least one domain in common with the query sequence and have a match to the
ELM regular expression, but do not align in the region of
the motif instance), c) sequences that have at least one
domain in common with the query sequence, do not contain any matches the ELM regular expression and do not
align in the region of the motif instance. The two slowest
alignment methods, namely Mummals and Tcoffee were
excluded from these tests, due to their excessive time and
memory requirements.

In the case of sequences with 'errors', i.e. predicted
sequences with missing exons, sequence fragments or
splicing variants, the alignment of the validated motifs is
not significantly affected for any of the programs tested.
As might be expected, sequences with false positive motifs
have a greater effect on alignment quality, and ClustalW,
Kalign and Muscle show a significant reduction in alignment accuracy. More surprisingly, the introduction of
related sequences that do not contain the LM also has an
effect on alignment quality, although the difference is
generally not significant.
Quality of overall alignment
The SPS scores obtained in the tests described above represent the accuracy of the alignment of the validated LMs.

They do not in any way indicate the overall quality of the
complete alignment, and notably, they do not take into
account the alignment of the homologous globular
domains. Unfortunately, we do not have high quality reference alignments for the full length proteins in these
tests. Therefore, in order to estimate the overall alignment
quality, we calculated the NorMD scores [44] for the fulllength sequences in the reference alignments in subset 1
(figure 6). NorMD is based on the Mean Distance (MD)
scores introduced in ClustalX [33] and combines the
advantages of a column-scoring technique with the sensitivity of methods incorporating residue similarity scores.

The normalised scores allow us to define a cutoff above
which the alignment is probably of high quality.
For sequences sharing >20% residue identity, all the programs tested achieved high quality alignments with mean
NorMD scores above 0.8 confirming previous studies
[30,31]. For the more divergent sequences in the twilight
zone of sequence similarity (<20% identity), alignment
quality is more variable (additional file 1, table 4), with
the more recent methods, Mafft, Probcons, Muscle and
Kalign, achieving the highest scores. A comparison of the
NorMD scores (representing overall alignment quality)

Pearson correlation coefficients for SPS scores versus structural, motif conservation and motif length, for the eight different alignment programs
evaluated. Values in bold indicate a significant correlation (critical value = 0.306 for 95% confidence interval)

versus the SPS scores (representing LM alignment quality)
(see additional file 2, figure 2) shows that LM alignment
accuracy is not correlated with the overall quality of the
complete alignment, which consists predominately of
globular domains (Pearson correlation coefficient =

Discussion
The BAliBASE benchmarking suite
The systematic application of benchmarking approaches
has been shown to be effective in many areas of bioinformatics, both for objective validation of existing tools and
for identification of promising directions for future
research. For example, the original version of the BAliBASE benchmark has been widely used to evaluate multiple sequence alignment methods and has lead to
significant improvements in alignment quality [42,43].
The alignments in BAliBASE (version 1) were organised
into Reference Sets that were specifically designed to represent the problems encountered by multiple alignment
methods when aligning globular proteins, from a small
number of divergent sequences, to sequences with large
N/C-terminal extensions or internal insertions. In version
2 of the benchmark, three new Reference Sets were
included, devoted to the particular problems posed by
sequences with transmembrane regions, repeats and
inverted domains.

The main objective of this study was to establish a benchmarking system that could be used to compare, evaluate
and improve the alignment of short motifs in protein
sequences. These linear motifs (LMs), including protein
interaction sites, cell compartment targeting signals, posttranslational modification sites and cleavage sites, play an
essential role in the correct functioning of many multidomain proteins. The multiple alignments, developed here
and included in the new BAliBASE Reference Set 9, represent real test cases and contain examples of experimentally verified functional motifs, extracted from the ELM
database. In this version of the benchmark, we only
included LMs that could be accurately aligned using a
manual validation process. Motifs that could not be
aligned unambiguously were removed from the reference
alignments. This led to a bias in the benchmark test sets

towards the known linear motifs that occur in globular
domains, which is clearly not representative of all possible
linear motifs, many of which are found in disordered
regions that are difficult (or impossible) to align based
solely on sequence information. In this case, the incorporation of multiple sequence alignment methods will not
improve the motif prediction accuracy and other information will be needed, such as 3D structure, taxonomic
range or cellular context. Nevertheless, it should be possible in future versions of the benchmark to include examples of these more difficult motifs, whenever experimental
or other evidence allows an objective assessment of the
alignment.
The number of sequences in each reference alignment was
then augmented by identifying related proteins in the
public databases containing putative functional sites. The
alignment of these potential motifs was validated and
refined manually to ensure the correct alignment of the
conserved residues.
An important feature of the benchmark is the organisation of the reference alignments into different subsets that
represent typical scenarios and problems that occur when
trying to align short linear motifs in the context of a global
multiple alignment. Thus, Subset 1 provides sequence sets
at different levels of residue similarity, ranging from conserved sequences sharing 40–80% residue identity to
more divergent sequences with <20% residue identity. In
these alignments, all the sequences contain validated LMs.
Subsets 2–4 provide alignments that represent a control to
avoid over-optimisation of multiple alignment algorithms when using the Reference Set as a benchmark. For
example, in Subset 3, aligning the false positive matches
on the ELM motif instance would lead to a misalignment
of the globular regions in the protein sequences. Subsets 2
and 4 consist of alignments that include sequences that do
not contain the ELM motif instance and alignment of
these sequences on the ELM motif instance would lead to
over-prediction in subsequent motif discovery systems.
Accuracy of motif alignment
The assessment of alignment quality was based only on
the sequences containing verified motifs and only took

into account the alignment of the LMs, ignoring the globular domain regions and the less well conserved, disordered regions. Nevertheless, we have shown that the
accuracy of the LM alignment depends critically on the
overall similarity of the sequence set, with a significant
loss of accuracy for the most divergent sequences sharing
less than 20% residue identity. This is true for all the programs tested in this study, regardless of whether a global
or local alignment algorithm is used. For sequences sharing more than 20% identity, all the programs tested are
capable of correctly aligning on average 80% of the
motifs. Below this level of identity, in the "twilight zone"
of protein sequences [41], the alignments produced by the
programs are often unreliable with a larger dispersion of
the scores. However, more recent programs, such as Mafft,
Muscle, Mummals and Probcons, achieve significantly
better scores here than the more traditional methods. Further investigation showed that the motif alignment quality for the most divergent sequences was significantly
affected by the structural context of the motif. In fact,
motifs that occurred within globular domains were
aligned more successfully, compared to the motifs found

in disordered regions. This result is not surprising since
most multiple alignment programs are optimised for the
alignment of globular domains. Introducing noise in the
form of other related sequences, with or without false positive motifs, also affected the ability of some of the programs to correctly align the manually validated motifs.
Currently, Probcons provides the best alignment of LMs
(assuming the user does not attempt to modify the default
parameters) and should therefore be used where quality is
paramount and slow execution is not a hindrance. In the
conservation score pipeline recently developed for the
ELM resource [19], Probcons would be too slow, and
therefore Mafft has been adopted, since it provides the
best current combination of performance and motif alignment quality.

Conclusion
Most of the modern multiple sequence alignment programs have not been optimised to align the full length,
highly modular protein sequences which abound in the
human and other eukaryotic proteomes. Instead, they
have primarily been designed to align individual globular

domains by reference to their 3D structure superpositions:
i.e. relatively short and collinear sequence regions. We
consider that there may be a number of different ways to
improve alignment of motifs, by taking them into account
either when developing new alignment algorithms and
optimising parameters, or when performing the alignment. Hopefully, an in-depth investigation of the factors
affecting LM alignment quality and a subsequent optimisation of the diverse parameters should improve the performance of the different alignment programs. In this
case, the risk of overfitting to the motifs may be acceptable
when motif detection is the prime consideration.
We have shown that none of the algorithms tested here is
capable of reliably aligning all the LMs in distantly related
sequences. It should be possible in the future to improve
the reliability of LM alignment, either by combining a
number of different algorithmic approaches and selecting
a consensus alignment, or by including other contextual
information, such as 3D structure, taxonomy or cellular
context. If the resulting co-operative, knowledge based
systems are capable of identifying the globular domain
organisation of the proteins, then it should be possible to
apply dedicated algorithms within the disordered, interdomain regions, that can be used for the detection and
alignment of over-represented or conserved sequence
motifs. The success of such an approach will clearly hinge
on the pertinence of the scoring function used to distinguish real motifs from random noise.
The use of more accurate multiple sequence alignments
should in turn increase the precision of the new motif discovery systems now being developed, with subsequent
consequences in a number of important applications. For
example, since LMs represent sites of protein interaction
and act as nodes in regulatory networks, cell signalling
cannot be understood until we can accurately identify
such functional motifs. Furthermore, linear motif targets
are now considered to play a role in drug discovery [45],
as exemplified by the nutlins, lead compounds that block
the P53:MDM2 interaction with dramatic effects on cultured tumour cells [46,47].
