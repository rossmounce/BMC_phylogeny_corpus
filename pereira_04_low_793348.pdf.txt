Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial DNA has been detected in the nuclear genome of eukaryotes as
pseudogenes, or Numts. Human and plant genomes harbor a large number of Numts, some of which
have high similarity to mitochondrial fragments and thus may have been inadvertently included in
population genetic and phylogenetic studies using mitochondrial DNA. Birds have smaller genomes
relative to mammals, and the genome-wide frequency and distribution of Numts is still unknown.
The release of a preliminary version of the chicken (Gallus gallus) genome by the Genome
Sequencing Center at Washington University, St. Louis provided an opportunity to search this first
avian genome for the frequency and characteristics of Numts relative to those in human and plants.
Results: We detected at least 13 Numts in the chicken nuclear genome. Identities between Numts
and mitochondrial sequences varied from 58.6 to 88.8%. Fragments ranged from 131 to 1,733
nucleotides, collectively representing only 0.00078% of the nuclear genome. Because fewer Numts
were detected in the chicken nuclear genome, they do not represent all regions of the
mitochondrial genome and are not widespread in all chromosomes. Nuclear integrations in chicken
seem to occur by a DNA intermediate and in regions of low gene density, especially in
macrochromosomes.
Conclusion: The number of Numts in chicken is low compared to those in human and plant
genomes, and is within the range found for most sequenced eukaryotic genomes. For chicken, PCR
amplifications of fragments of about 1.5 kilobases are highly likely to represent true mitochondrial
amplification. Sequencing of these fragments should expose the presence of unusual features typical
of pseudogenes, unless the nuclear integration is very recent and has not yet been mutated.
Metabolic selection for compact genomes with reduced repetitive DNA and gene-poor regions
where Numts occur may explain their low incidence in birds.

Background
The establishment of the mitochondrion as a cellular
organelle by endosymbiosis [1] changed the fate of the
ancestral genome that free-living eubacterial ancestors

possessed. Mitochondria have reduced genome size as a
result of the interaction between them and their host cells.
Genes once needed to support life as a free-living organism were lost or transferred to the nuclear genome of the

host eukaryote. One of the reasons why mitochondrial
genes would benefit from being located in the nuclear
genome is reduction in the accumulation of deleterious
mutations. Asexually propagated genomes tend to build
up their genetic load quicker than sexually propagated
genomes, a principle known in population genetics as
Muller's ratchet. Additionally, the formation of reactive
oxygen species within mitochondria as a result of the
process of respiratory electron transport increases the frequency of mutations, exacerbating the effects of the
Muller's ratchet [2].
Mode of gene regulation, special properties of gene products, mechanisms of import of proteins into the mitochondrion, and other as yet unknown features may be
acting against the complete transfer of all mitochondrial
genes to the nucleus [reviewed in [3]]. Although essential
genes are still located in the mitochondrial genome,
amplification of nuclear copies of mitochondrial genes
has been detected occasionally in several taxonomic
groups [reviewed in [4]]. Non-functional nuclear copies
or pseudogenes have been termed Numts (pronounced
'new-mights', for NUclear MiTochondrial DNA segments)
by Lopez and collaborators [5], who found tandem-duplicated mitochondrial copies of a 7.9 kilobases (kb) fragment in the nuclear genome of cats. Subsequently,
caution has been recommended when attempting to
amplify authentic mitochondrial fragments by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, as the nuclear copies
might be amplified in preference to mitochondrial ones,
especially using conserved primers designed on gene
sequences of organisms of different taxonomic levels
[4,6,7].
With the completion of the sequencing of the human
genome [8], extensive genomic analyses have found hundreds of Numts in the human nuclear genome [9-11].
These analyses indicate that nuclear copies are widespread

in all human chromosomes and involve all mitochondrial
genes and the control region. Some of these integrations
encompass about 80% of the complete mitochondrial
genome. Similarity between human Numts and their
mitochondrial counterparts is as high as 99%, raising concerns for the fields of molecular population genetics and
phylogenetics because PCR amplification and sequencing
of mitochondrial DNA segments are major tools used to
address many biological questions in ecology and evolution. High similarity of Numts with mitochondrial genes
not only increases the chance of accidentally amplifying
the nuclear copy but also lessens any suspicion that the
fragment isolated is not of mitochondrial origin, and thus
has the potential to invalidate the conclusions of many
studies.
Although birds are well studied with over 815,000
sequences deposited in GenBank as of June 4, 2004,
Numts have been reported for only four different avian
orders (Table 1). In most cases, the nuclear integration
involved the control region and cytochrome b gene (cyt
b). Sequence divergence between these Numts and the corresponding mitochondrial segment varied from 2 to 31%.
However, the extent and details of the Numt fraction in
avian genomes will only be adduced when more nuclear
genome sequences become available. The recent sequencing of the chicken (Gallus gallus) nuclear genome by the
Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University, St.
Louis and its availability for public access at the Ensembl
[12] website provides an opportunity to check whether
the high incidence and occasionally large size of Numts in
the human genome also occur in this avian genome. Contrasting with humans, avian chromosomes are classified
in macrochromosomes and microchromosomes, according to whether or not they are cytogenetically identifiable
by conventional banding techniques. Consequently,
chicken has a diploid number of 78 chromosomes classified in eight pairs of macrochromosomes, 30 pairs of

ZW. We searched for mitochondrial pseudogenes in the
chicken genome, and provide a descriptive characterization of Numts found. We also compare our results to other
similar studies on sequenced eukaryotic genomes and
show that the frequency and amplification of Numts varies
from species to species, and that the numerous Numts
found in the human and plant genomes may be the exception to the general rule in eukaryotes.

Results
Results of the BLAST search for sequences in the chicken
nuclear genome that have homology with chicken mitochondrial DNA revealed 22 alignments that seemed to be
biologically significant as defined by our threshold of 104 (Table 2). Moreover, size of alignments and similarity
between legitimate mitochondrial sequences and their
homologues in the nuclear genome indicate that the
nuclear homologues could represent ancient degenerate
mitochondrial sequences. Careful inspection of returned
alignments led us to infer the presence of at least 13 mitochondrial fragments into the nuclear genome. They are
numbered 1–7, 8a, 8b, 9–13. Identities between Numts
and corresponding mitochondrial sequences varied from
58.6 to 88.8%.
Regarding size of mitochondrial pseudogenes, we found
six Numts ranging from 782 – 1,733 bp that were recov-

ered by two or more alignments, and seven Numts of 131
– 412 bp recovered by a single alignment. Considered
together, Numts contributed 8,869 bp or 0.00078% of the
nuclear genome of the chicken.
Ten protein-coding genes (except for ND2, ND3, ND4L,
ND6, CO1 and CO3), ribosomal genes, the control region
(CR), and 10 of 22 tRNAs were found in Numts. The mitochondrial control region, ND5 and ND4 were each found
in three different Numts, followed by cyt b, which was
detected in two Numts. All other genes included in a Numt
were present only once (Table 2; Fig. 1).
Most genes found in chicken Numts correspond to partial
mitochondrial sequences. Complete sequences for the
control region, tRNAPhe, tRNAHis, tRNALeu, tRNALys, and
ATPase 8 were found in Numts 2, 4, 7, and 13. Regardless
of the completeness of the mitochondrial pseudogene in
the nuclear genome, all protein-coding genes had internal
stop codons and/or frame-shift mutations. No tRNA
Numt could be perfectly folded in its predicted secondary
structure, with the exception of the tRNAHis that had only
one substitution compared to the mitochondrial counterpart, and that did not interfere with its secondary structure
(Fig. 2). However, this tRNA is part of a bigger nuclear
fragment (containing partial sequences for tRNASer and
ND4) that has high similarity with the chicken mitochondrial fragment, indicating that it may be a recent Numt.

they are not represented here. Range for BLAST scores is

The site of Numt integration was further analyzed using
the graphic interface available at the Ensembl website
[12], using the mitochondrial region and chromosomal
positions given in Table 2. We found that integrations
occurred in regions where no known or predicted genes
were located. These regions were also rich in repeat
elements like LINES, microsatellites and low complexity
repeats, but with no apparent association between them
and Numts. Ten Numts were localized in three macrochromosomes, and the remaining four in different microchromosomes (Fig. 1). No Numts were identified in the sex
chromosomes W and Z, or in contigs not yet assigned to
chromosomes. Chromosome 4 (GGA4) had three of the
five largest Numts detected in the nuclear genome.

Two Numts deserve more consideration. Numt 7 in GGA4
was located at the very 3' end of the contig, and it may be
longer than 1,182 bp. However, it is necessary to close the
gap between the contig where it was found and the adjacent contig to check the extension of this integration.
Numt 8a and 8b, also found in GGA4, would be considered to represent two independent integrations according
to our criteria (e.g. they are inserted in opposite directions
and they do not overlap). However, because the region
between them spans 816 bp in the nuclear genome and
this is similar to the missing fragment of 936 bp in the
mitochondrial genome, they may have been part of one
transfer event that was later involved in a chromosomal
rearrangement, leading to change of orientation of one of
the fragments. Moreover, the presence of an intercalated
microsatellite at the 3' end of Numt 8a and 5' end of Numt
8b indicates that the rearrangement is more plausible
than two independent transfers.
The mechanism of mitochondrial integration in the
nuclear genome may be via RNA [13] or DNA [5], and can
be identified by checking the 5' and 3' ends of the genes
involved. Integration via a DNA intermediate is the most
common mechanism in the human genome [10]. In
chicken, Numts 2, 9, and 11 contain the CR and the integration is clearly by a DNA intermediate, as the CR is not
transcribed. Polycistronic mitochondrial RNA transcripts

are quickly processed as they are transcribed, and mRNAs
do not have polyadenylation signals at the 5' end [14].
Therefore Numts 3, 4, 6, 7, 8a, 8b and 13 were also
integrated via DNA as these signals of processing were not
present. Mode of integration cannot be inferred for Numts
1, 5, 10 and 12 as they represent integrations of partial
fragments of protein-coding genes with no associated
neighboring gene in the same integration, and no end is
present in the Numt to check for these processing signatures. We also discarded the possibility that any of these
Numts found in the chicken nuclear genome originated
from a duplication of another Numt. Furthermore, we
found no evidence of tandem repeats around the site of
integration.

Discussion
Numts in the chicken and other eukaryotic genomes
Our search of the chicken nuclear genome indicates the
presence of 13 apparently independent integrations of
mitochondrial DNA genes. Two of these Numts may actually represent a single integration that underwent rearrangement resulting in loss of an intermediate region and
change of the orientation of one of the remaining fragment. Such rearrangements of Numts have been detected
previously in birds and humans [9,15]. No correlation
seems to exist between the size of a nuclear genome and
number of Numts, although bigger genomes and larger
chromosomes can bear more integrations [11]. Although
no clear site for integration of Numts has been recognized
so far, regions with low gene content are more prone to
integrations [10], which probably avoid disruption of
well-organized gene complexes in gene-rich regions, and
therefore survival of the integration in the nuclear
genome. In chicken, most insertions were detected in
macrochromosomes that are low in gene content compared to microchromosomes [16,17]. Two mitochondrial
DNA regions were identified as hotspots for insertions
into the nuclear genome, one at the control region and the
other encompassing the intervening sequence between
ND4 and cyt b. Although most Numts detected in PCR
products in birds are examples of the integration of the CR
or cyt b genes (Table 1), this is a consequence of these
genes being the most targeted for amplification in ecological and evolutionary studies compared to other regions of
the mitochondrial genome. As our analysis was performed in a pre-assembled version of the chicken
genome, other Numts may be found when the complete
assembly is released. However, the conclusions of our
study should still hold as the genomic assembly we
searched included contigs not yet assigned to
chromosomes.

The number of Numts found in chicken is within the range
found in most sequenced eukaryotic genomes (Fig. 3).
That is, mitochondrial pseudogenes do not seem to repre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/17

sent a large portion of eukaryotic genomes, and with the
exception of human, mouse and plants, they number less
than 100. Our results are consistent with the observation
that avian genomes harbor less repetitive elements and
other non-coding sequences [18,19]. Only 17% of the
chicken genome is assumed to be composed of repetitive
elements including LINEs, SINEs, microsatellites, minisatellites and simple repeats [20] compared to 40 – 50% of
the genome of humans and rodents [8,21,22]. Flight has
been claimed to impose constraints on the size of bird
genomes, and there is a positive association between
genome size and flying abilities: stronger fliers posses
smaller genomes than weak fliers [23]. As flight demands
a high metabolic rate and, and high metabolic rate in turn
restricts cell size, genome content is expected to be
reduced to fit a small cell. These same reasons appear to
explain why bats have small genomes [23-25] and provide
independent evidence for the association between flight
and compact genomes in homoeothermic vertebrates.
Because the number of genes in chicken is similar to those
in human, small genome size in chicken has been
achieved in part by loss of repetitive DNA and gene-poor
chromosomal regions where most Numts occur. Metabolic selection for compact genomes could therefore
explain the low incidence of Numts that have been
observed in birds. Although sequenced plant genomes of
Arabidopsis and rice are smaller than those of humans and
chicken, they have a high number of Numts. The reasons
for this discrepancy are not well understood, but plant
genomes seem to be able to harbor a large number of
repetitive elements and to transfer DNA bidirectionally
between chloroplasts and mitochondria [28-30].
Implications for inference of population history and
phylogenetics
As mitochondrial DNA is one of the main sources of information for population genetics and phylogenetics at several taxonomic depths, the inadvertent amplification of
Numts via PCR technologies may seriously impact studies
and lead to erroneous conclusions about phylogeography
and taxon relationships. For example, in a recent study of
great apes [7], Numts seem to have been preferentially
amplified in gorillas, and similarity of these inserts with
mitochondrial copies was high enough to avoid suspicion
Numts were amplified. Also, the demonstration that the
human genome has hundreds of Numts representing all
mitochondrial regions including large portions of the
mtDNA molecule, some of which have high similarity
with their mitochondrial counterparts, has raised concerns that Numts may have gone undetected in many studies published in the last decade. This problem would be
especially acute if Numts are a common feature of
genomes. Fortunately, it seems that Numts are not as frequent in most sequenced eukaryotic genomes as they are
in humans or plants (Fig. 3).

Numbers of Numts are indicated on gray cylinders. Data is from [11], except for chicken, dog, zebrafish and bee. See material
and methods for more details.

In birds, for example, mitochondrial pseudogenes have
been occasionally detected (Table 1), but numbers
reported may actually be underestimates as not all findings of Numts are formally published. Unfortunately,
these studies do not provide information on the real
extent of Numts because the experimental design was not
aimed at a search for such elements. Our search indicates
that the size of Numts detected in the chicken genome is
often smaller than the usual size of the fragments isolated
by PCR technology (>600 bp) in most published studies.
Also, similarities between chicken Numts and their mitochondrial counterparts were below 89%, and the presence
of indels, stop codons or frame-shift mutations would
clearly indicate the amplification of a pseudogene instead
of a fragment of the mitochondrial genome. In humans,
some large Numts representing about 80% of the total
mitochondrial genome have been found. However, most
human mitochondrial pseudogenes are smaller than 500
bp [26]. Collectively these observations imply that the
amplification of a Numt will be rare if mitochondrial fragments targeted for amplification are above the size range
of most described Numts.

If the Numts in chicken are typical of those in other birds,
amplifications of fragments of about 1.5 kb are highly
likely to represent true mitochondrial amplification, and
are economically more viable than performing amplification of very large segments (e.g. > 5 kb) of the mitochondrial genome, or by cloning PCR products. Moreover,
sequencing of fragments of about 1.5 kb should easily
detect the presence of unusual features of pseudogenes
unless the nuclear integration is very recent. However, if
PCR amplification results in more than one band, or
sequence ambiguities or background signal are present,
direct PCR amplification may not produce authentic
mtDNA sequences. In this case other methodologies such
as isolation of mitochondria from cells previous to DNA
isolation, or isolation of DNA from mitochondriaenriched tissues may provide a solution. Use of conserved
primers increases the chance that they might preferentially
anneal to a Numt, as they are effectively molecular fossils
because they have a slower rate of DNA substitution than
does mitochondrial DNA [27,31].

Conclusions
We have shown that the numbers of Numts in the nuclear
genome of the chicken is low compared to what was
found in the genome of humans and plants. Although
caution must still be exercised in PCR-based studies, the
small size and sequence divergence of these chicken pesudogenes from mitochondrial copies indicates that they
may be less of a concern in mtDNA-based studies of birds
relative to primates and plants. However, we will only
know to what extent these findings apply generally to
avian genomes when sequences of more diverse bird taxa
are completed.

Methods
Sequence analysis
The full-length mitochondrial genome for chicken [32]
was retrieved from The National Center for Biotechnology
Information database [33] under accession number
NC_001323 and used to perform similarity searches
against a database of the draft sequence of the chicken
nuclear genome released by the Genome Sequencing
Center at Washington University, St Louis (Build
WASHUC1) and publicly available at the Ensembl
Genome Browser [12,34] as of March 2004. BLAST [35]
searches were used, with the whole mitochondrial
genome sequence or mitochondrial genes individually as
query. Results from both strategies were the same. We set
the maximum expectation value in BLASTN searches to be
e = 10-4 to recover hits that are biologically significant. No
filters were used during searches. Assuming e values in the
range of 10-4 to 10 resulted in extra hits that have lower
similarity with the query sequence, and shorter alignments, therefore indicating the randomness of these hits.
Further analyses indicated that some recovered alignments represented short T-rich regions in the nuclear
genome that aligned with a short T-stretch present at the
beginning of the chicken mitochondrial control region.
Identification of mitochondrial integrations in the nuclear
genome
Results from searches were analyzed via BLASTView, a
graphic interface that displays the results after a BLAST
search in the Ensembl website. For all recovered alignments that had similarity between mitochondrial and
nuclear genomes above 50% and a significant e value, we
downloaded the contigs where these BLAST hits were
observed to investigate the characteristics of the mitochondrial pseudogene in the nuclear genome, also known
as Numt [5]. For most Numts, contig and chromosomal
position was obtained from BLASTView, and information
on the region of integration was gathered by examining
the maps and annotation provided in ContigView and
ExportView links, respectively. When two alignments were
returned for the same contig, they were merged and considered to be the same integration event if they were in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/17

same orientation and had overlapping bases. When gaps
between alignments in the same contig were observed
they were considered to be the same if the gap was similar
in size to the mitochondrial fragment expected to fill this
gap. Also, for the later case, we checked the intervening
sequence for the possible presence of insertion or deletion
of nucleotides.
Secondary structure for tRNAs involved in Numts
Prediction of secondary structure for legitimate tRNAs and
their Numts which had the complete tRNA sequence were
obtained using the DNA mfold web server [36]. Folding
temperature used was the default set to 37°C. For some
tRNAs, some bases were forced to pair to obtain the
expected mitochondrial tRNA structure as previously
described [32].
Search for Numts in other available genomes
A recent study has summarized the distribution of Numts
in a variety of organisms [11]. However, they did not
include information on Numts for dog, zebrafish and bee
genomes that have only recently became available in GenBank. Therefore, we performed an initial analysis for
Numts
in
these
genomes
(GenBank
Builds
cra_dog_assembly, zebrafish_HTGS 1.1, Amel 1.1, respectively), using the corresponding full-length mitochondrial
sequence. The database for these organisms is pre-draft
assembly available in GenBank in late March, 2004. In
these searches, we only recorded the number of alignments found by a BLASTN searches, and no further analysis was performed to evaluate the overlap between
alignments. This same procedure was adopted in [11].
Therefore, caution is necessary in the interpretation of the
number of Numts reported in those organisms and in
chicken. Our goal was to have a rough estimate of number
of Numts in these genomes for comparative purposes
only.
