Abstract
Background: Orthologous genes are frequently presumed to perform similar functions.
However, outside of model organisms, this is rarely tested. One means of inferring changes in
function is if there are changes in the level of gene conservation and selective constraint. Here we
compare levels of gene conservation across three bacterial groups to test for changes in gene
functionality.
Findings: The level of gene conservation for different orthologous genes is highly correlated
across clades, even for highly divergent groups of bacteria. These correlations do not arise from
broad differences in gene functionality (e.g. informational genes vs. metabolic genes), but instead
seem to result from very specific differences in gene function. Furthermore, these functional
differences appear to be maintained over very long periods of time.
Conclusion: These results suggest that even over broad time scales, most bacterial genes are
under a nearly constant level of purifying selection, and that bacterial evolution is thus dominated
by selective and functional stasis.

Background
We are interested in whether the functional importance of
orthologous genes changes across bacterial taxa. We pose
a simple question: if a gene plays an important role for the
functioning of a bacterium, is the orthologue of that gene
in a distantly related bacterium also particularly important? To measure functional importance, we look at how
strongly genes are conserved over time. If a group of
orthologous genes are well conserved across different taxa,
this implies that strong purifying selection is acting to
maintain these genes. Similarly, if a group of orthologous
genes are lost quickly across different taxa, this implies
that purifying selection is acting only weakly to maintain
these genes. If the strength of purifying selection for individual genes does not change across bacterial groups (i.e.

if there is a correlation in the level of orthologue conservation), this implies that the functional importance of
most orthologous genes does not change quickly. On the
other hand, if there is little correlation in the level of gene
conservation across bacterial groups, this implies that the
functional importance of many orthologues changes
often, perhaps because of differences in the genetic backgrounds of organisms (e.g. compensating mechanisms at
other loci).
Here we show that between three bacterial clades, the levels of conservation for specific orthologues are highly correlated. This correlation remains even when examining
subgroups of functionally similar genes, such as genes
involved in ribosome function. This suggests that despite

large differences in genetic background, the strength of
selection acting to maintain any specific orthologue
remains approximately constant, and that most genes
maintain their specific functionality over long periods of
time.
We used stochastic character mapping [1] to calculate a
measure of gene conservation that accounts for phylogenetic relatedness between taxa. Briefly, for each protein
coding gene in E. coli K12 W3110, we determined whether
an orthologous gene was present or absent for all other
bacteria with fully sequenced genomes (447 other
genomes in total). Together with information on the phylogenetic history, these data were used to calculate a
parameter for each orthologue that reflects the rate (probability per unit time) that the orthologue the orthologue
will be lost or gained along a branch (see Additional file
1). Because this parameter value is mostly determined by
how quickly an orthologue is lost over time, we term this
parameter the rate of orthologue loss (ROL). Low ROL
values imply that along a branch, there is a low probability of that orthologue being lost. High ROL values imply
that along a branch, there is a high probability that the
orthologue will be lost. For each orthologue, one ROL was
calculated for all branches in a clade.

Methods
All genomes were downloaded from the NCBI database in
May of 2007 (Additional file 2), and a phylogeny was constructed using a concatenated set of 73 conserved orthologues (Additional files 3 and 4). The program SIMMAP
[2] was used to calculate all ROL values (Additional file
5), and gene functional classes were divided using MultiFun [3]. For detailed materials and methods, see Additional file 1.

Results
Constancy of ROL across different bacterial clades
We tested whether the ROL values for specific orthologues
change between different clades of bacteria. We calculated
the ROL values for orthologous genes in three bacterial
groups: the γ – and β-proteobacteria; the α-proteobacteria,
which are the sister clade of the γ-β-proteobacteria and
diverged approximately 2.5 billion years ago [4]; and the
Bacilli-Molllicutes clade, which diverged from the γ-β-proteobacteria just over three billion years ago [4]. For all of
these clades, we found that the ROL values for orthologous genes were highly correlated (Fig. 1; r2 = 0.673, Pearson's ρ = 0.756 for γ-β-proteobacteria versus αproteobacteria; r2 = 0.488, Pearson's ρ = 0.628 for γ-β-proteobacteria versus Bacilli-Molllicutes; all data are listed in
Additional file 5).

A simple explanation for the high correlation between
ROL values is that it is driven by differences in gene essen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/2

tiality: essential genes will be strongly conserved, while
nonessential genes will be weakly conserved. To test this,
we divided the genes into essential and nonessential
groups, based on the experimental results from two recent
studies that used either E. coli K12 MG1655 [5] or E. coli
K12 BW25113 [6]. We disregarded any discrepancies in
essentiality annotation between the two studies and
focused only on those genes for which they agree on the
classification of essentiality. We found that even when
excluding orthologues that are classified as essential in E.
coli, the correlations remained very high (Fig. 1; r2 = 0.539
and r2 = 0.332, respectively).
A second explanation for the high correlation between
ROL values is that it is driven by differences between functional classes of genes. For example, informational orthologues may be highly conserved, whereas genes involved
in metabolic functions may be less conserved. To test this
hypothesis, we calculated the correlation coefficients for
ROL values of orthologues within single functional classes
of genes as delineated by MultiFun [3] (see Additional file
1). We found that within MultiFun classes, ROL values
between bacterial groups were again highly correlated,
even when considering only nonessential genes. The r2
values between γ-β-proteobacteria and α-proteobacteria
varied from 0.740 (for information transfer genes related
to DNA, MultiFun class 2.1) to 0.260 (for carbon utilization genes, class 1.1) (Fig. 2). The r2 values between γ-βproteobacteria and Bacilli-Mollicutes varied from 0.600
(for structural genes in the ribosome, MultiFun class 6.6)
to 0.020 (for structural genes responsible for surface antigens, class 6.3) (Fig. 2). Together, these data suggest that
ROL values remain constant over long stretches of time,
on the order of billions of years, and that this constancy is
driven neither by broad differences in gene functionality,
nor differences in gene essentiality, but by specific differences in gene function.
The relationship between ROL and gene essentiality
We have assumed above that the level of gene conservation
reflects the strength of purifying selection acting on a gene:
well-conserved genes are under strong purifying selection,
while less conserved genes experience only weak purifying
selection. Here we test this assumption by asking how well
our measure of gene conservation, ROL, corresponds to
growth phenotypes, which we know to be under selection.
Specifically, if the deletion of a gene causes lethality even
under benign laboratory conditions, then the loss of this
gene is almost certainly lethal in the natural environment
and is thus under strong purifying selection. We first ask,
then, how well ROL values correlate with annotations of
gene essentiality. The ROL values for essential and nonessential genes are shown in Fig. 3A. On average, genes that
have been classified as essential in E. coli K12 have a dramatically lower ROL than non-essential genes.

point indicates the estimated ROL for that gene (orthologue set) in γ-β-proteobacteria as opposed to α-proteobacteria. Essential genes are shown as inverted triangles; nonessential genes as grey circles. There is a highly significant relationship between
individual ROL in the two clades (r = 0.820, p < 0.0001). This remains true even when essential genes are removed from consideration (r = 0.734, p < 0.0001). The lines indicate the cut-off ROL values used in Table 1. B) γ-β-proteobacteria versus Bacilli
and Molllicutes. Each point indicates the estimated ROL for that set of orthologues in γ-β-proteobacteria as opposed to Bacilli
and Molllicutes. Essential genes in E. coli are shown as inverted triangles; nonessential genes as grey circles. There is a highly significant relationship between ROLs for individual orthologues in the two clades (r = 0.700, p < 0.0001). This remains true even
when orthologues that are essential in E. coli are removed from consideration (r = 0.576, p < 0.0001). The lines indicate the
cut-off ROL values used in Table 1.

To quantify the relationship between ROL and essentiality, we used a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve.
This curve describes the relationship between the fraction
of false positives and the fraction of true positives when
using ROL to discriminate between essential and nonessential genes. One means of quantifying this relationship
is by calculating the area under the ROC curve (the AUC),
which is equivalent to the probability that a randomly
chosen essential gene will have a lower ROL than a randomly chosen nonessential gene [7]. If ROL were perfectly
predictive of gene essentiality, the AUC would be 1.0; the
AUC for this analysis was 0.947 (Fig. 3B), and strongly
suggests that ROL values do reflect the strength of purifying selection acting on a gene.
We also asked whether ROL values and the quantitative
effects of gene deletions are correlated. Using data on
growth yield in rich media of deletion mutants [6], we
found a small but highly significant relationship between
a gene's ROL value and the growth yield of that deletion
strain (Fig. S2; r2 = 0.0628, p < 0.0001; Spearman's ρ =
0.127, p < 0.0001). Again, this suggests that ROL values
reflect the strength of purifying selection acting on a gene.

Conclusion
We have shown that ROL values for specific orthologues
are correlated over long broad evolutionary distances, and
that these correlations remain strong even within specific
functional classes of genes and for genes that are not
essential for cellular viability. In other words, the constancy of the level gene conservation across bacterial
orders seems to result from specific differences in gene
function. The strength of the correlations we find here are
of similar magnitude to one found in a previous study of
correlations between protein evolutionary rates within the
Chlamydiaceae [8]. Notably, the Chlamydiaceae are far
more closely related than the clades considered here, so a
high correlation should not be surprising. However, we
have also considered selection on a more general scale
(gene presence versus gene absence), which likely
increases the strength of the correlations. Interestingly, for
some orthologues, ROL values have changed considerably
across taxonomic groups (we show three examples in Figs.
4 and 5). We propose that these genes have changed in
functional importance, resulting in either increased or
decreased purifying selection.

the parametric and nonparametric correlation coefficient between the ROL for nonessential orthologous genes in the γ-β-proteobacteria, α-proteobacteria, and Bacilli-Mollicutes was calculated. Only MultiFun classes for which ROL values existed for at

Some essential E. coli genes have orthologues that are consistently lost at high rates among other γ-β-proteobacteria,
α-proteobacteria, and Bacilli-Mollicutes, contrary to the
high level of conservations expected for essential genes.

This is not due to these genes only being essential in E. coli
and nonessential in other taxa. In Table 1 we show a list
of genes that are essential in E coli K12 and which have
high ROL values (greater than 2.4 in all three bacterial

Rates of orthologue loss (ROL) for E. coli genes annotated as essential are lower than for those annotated as

groups studied (Fig. 1)), together with data from an
empirical study of gene essentiality in the γ-proteobacterium Acinetobacter baylyi [9]. Of nine genes with an orthologue in Acinetobacter, eight are also essential in
Acinetobacter. This suggests, surprisingly, that some genes,
despite being essential, are lost frequently, and is consistent with the view that compensation at other sites in the
genome may occur even for "essential" functions.
Many of the essential genes that are lost at high rates are
recent innovations. Considering those genes that are
essential in E. coli K12 but are lost at high rates from other
γ-β-proteobacteria, 44% (18 out of 41) have a distribution
restricted to the γ-β-proteobacteria and are thus likely to
be relatively recent additions to the genomic repertoire. In
contrast, of the essential genes with low ROL values (less
than 2.4), only 0.9% (2 out of 222) are restricted to the γβ-proteobacteria. Previous work has shown that recently
acquired genes tend to be incorporated at the edge of the
cellular network [10]. Such peripheral genes may thus be
more easily removed from the genome, with fewer interactions to compensate.

These results confirm and extend previous studies that
have investigated the relationship between essentiality
and gene conservation [11-13]. However, here we have
used a phylogenetically corrected measure of gene conservation (ROL). Additionally, we have found that the ability
of orthologue conservation to predict gene essentiality is
far higher than has previously been realized [11], most
likely due to the lower accuracy of earlier datasets. Finally,
we have shown for the first time a correlation between
gene conservation and quantitative measures of deletion
phenotypes (growth yield, Fig. S2).
Our metric of gene conservation, which takes into account
phylogenetic history, provides a considerable improvement over simpler measures such as the fraction of taxa
that retain a specific orthologue (retention). Using retention to predict essentiality yields an AUC of 0.937, meaning that essential genes are incorrectly ranked higher than
nonessential genes 6.3% of the time. Using ROL, the misclassified fraction is reduced to 5.3%, a reduction of 16%
in the error rate. ROL has the additional advantage of
being based on a specific evolutionary model, which itself
may provide biological insights, for example into the relPage 5 of 9

ative rates of gene loss versus horizontal transfer (i.e. the
ratio of gene loss versus gene gain in lineages).
Finally, we note that high-throughput experimental
assessments of gene essentiality are prone to both false
positive and false negative results (i.e. annotating a nonessential gene as essential and vice versa). The level of
agreement on essentiality between the two most recent

studies of gene essentiality [5,6] is similar to the level of
agreement between both studies and ROL (all are between
94% and 95%), and far greater than between the first
experimental study of gene essentiality [14] and the latter
two experimental studies. This suggests that ROL may be
a valid and useful means of cross-validating experimental
studies in order to find genes likely to be false positives or
false negatives, which could then be reexamined.

Figure 5
Phylogenetic pattern of conservation for zur, sspA, and rbfA
Phylogenetic pattern of conservation for zur, sspA, and rbfA. Unlike most RNA related genes (Fig. 5), these three genes
have different patterns of conservation, and thus different ROL values, when compared between γ-β-proteobacteria and αproteobacteria. The figure shows the phylogeny of the α-γ-β-proteobacteria together with Magnetococcus MC1, with the
names of each taxa listed; this is a subset of the taxa presented in Figure S1. The columns show the conservation patterns for
orthologues of the E. coli RNA related genes involved in information transfer (zur, sspA, and rbfA, respectively). Black boxes
indicate orthologue presence, while white indicate absence. Orthologues of zur, a transcriptional regulator for zinc uptake, are
almost completely conserved in α-proteobacteria, and were likely lost only a single time in the intracellular Rickettsia lineage.
This can be contrasted with the pattern of conservation in the γ-β-proteobacteria, from which zur orthologues have been lost
multiple times, and on relatively quick timescales: an orthologue appears in Shewanella sp. MR-7, but is absent from Shewanella
sp. MR-4. Orthologues of sspA, associated with the RNA ROLymerase, are conserved almost completely in the γ-β-proteobacteria, having been lost only from the intracellular Candidatus-Buchnera lineage. However, in the α-proteobacteria sspA orthologues have been lost multiple times, and over short periods of time in some cases: an orthologue appears to be present in
Mesorhizobium loti, but absent in Mesorhizobium BNC1. Finally, orthologues of rbfA, associated with the ribosome, are perfectly
conserved in the γ-β-proteobacteria, but have been lost multiple times from the α-proteobacteria. The first case (zur) is consistent with an increased level of constraint within the α-proteobacteria, as this gene also has a high ROL value in the BacilliMollicutes; in the case of rbfA, a relaxation in selective constraint within the α-proteobacteria seems likely, as orthologues of
this gene are also highly conserved in the Bacilli-Mollicutes clade (sspA has no orthologues in the Bacilli-Mollicutes).
