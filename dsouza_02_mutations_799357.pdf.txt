Abstract
Background: Group II introns are mobile genetic elements that form conserved secondary and
tertiary structures. In order to determine which of the conserved structural elements are required
for mobility, a series of domain and sub-domain deletions were made in the Lactococcus lactis group
II intron (Ll.LtrB) and tested for mobility in a genetic assay. Point mutations in domains V and VI
were also tested.
Results: The largest deletion that could be made without severely compromising mobility was 158
nucleotides in DIVb(1–2). This mutant had a mobility frequency comparable to the wild-type Ll.LtrB
intron (∆ORF construct). Hence, all subsequent mutations were done in this mutant background.
Deletion of DIIb reduced mobility to approximately 18% of wild-type, while another deletion in
domain II (nts 404–459) was mobile to a minor extent. Only two deletions in DI and none in DIII
were tolerated. Some mobility was also observed for a DIVa deletion mutant. Of the three point
mutants at position G3 in DV, only G3A retained mobility. In DVI, deletion of the branch-point
nucleotide abolished mobility, but the presence of any nucleotide at the branch-point position
restored mobility to some extent.
Conclusions: The smallest intron capable of efficient retrohoming was 725 nucleotides,
comprising the DIVb(1–2) and DII(ii)a,b deletions. The tertiary elements found to be nonessential
for mobility were alpha, kappa and eta. In DV, only the G3A mutant was mobile. A branch-point
residue is required for intron mobility.

Background
Group II introns are catalytic RNAs that are also mobile
genetic elements. Although their primary sequences vary
considerably, the intron RNAs fold into well-conserved
structures (Figure 1). The generalized group II intron secondary structure consists of six helical domains emerging
from a central wheel [1,2]. Some group II introns are capable of self-splicing; however for efficient splicing in vivo,

the intron-encoded ORF or host-encoded splicing factors
are required [3]. Mobile group II introns encode a reverse
transcriptase/maturase, with the coding region generally
located in domain IV.
Group II introns were first identified in fungal mitochondria and grouped on the basis of their secondary structures
[2,4,5]. They have been found in organelle genomes of

fungi and plants and also in a number of bacteria [6].
None have been found in animals, although it has been
suggested that group II introns may be progenitors of nuclear spliceosomal introns based on similarities between
nuclear pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotes and the splicing
mechanism used by group II introns [7,8].
In the first step of splicing, there is a nucleophilic attack by
the branch-point residue on the nucleotide at position 1
of the intron, resulting in a lariat structure with the intron
remaining attached to the 3' exon. The second transesterification results in exon ligation with the release of lariat
RNA complexed with the intron-encoded protein. This ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is an endonuclease,
which can initiate reverse splicing into an intron-less target site in a process known as retrohoming [3]. After the
intron RNA reverse splices into one strand of the doublestranded DNA, the intron-encoded protein cleaves the
other strand at position +9 or +10 downstream of the intron insertion site, and the generated 3' end of the second
strand is used as a primer for reverse transcription of the
inserted intron RNA. Integration of the resultant cDNA
occurs via the host's recombination or repair mechanisms.
At this point, however, it is not clear what the exact structural requirements for retrohoming are, or which tertiary
interactions are dispensable for the reaction. This mutational study is an effort to understand what structural features of the intron RNA are important for mobility and to
utilize that information to construct a minimal intron capable of retrohoming. The development of a core functional intron would be interesting not only from an
evolutionary perspective, but would also facilitate manipulation in the laboratory.

Results and Discussion
Domain I
Domain I possesses numerous intra- and inter-domain interactions by which it serves as a scaffold for intron folding. It associates with domain V to form the catalytic core.
It is also important for recognition of the 5' exon in cis
splicing reactions and for targeting DNA or RNA in reverse
splicing [9]. Not surprisingly, deletions in sub-domain
structures, particularly Ic, greatly diminish mobility. In
this report, the ratio of ampRtetR to ampR colonies of each
mutant, normalized to the wild-type ratio, was used as a
measure of mobility frequency. It is important to note that
for mutants with a very low mobility (≤ 0.001%), this ratio may not reflect mobility frequency due to background
tetR colonies and it was necessary to verify intron insertion
by PCR analysis.

Only two deletions in domain I retained some mobility;
domain Ib, 0.06%, and the κ helix (nts 190–204), 0.37%.
The Ib deletion mutant had a mobility frequency of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/3/17

0.06%, which may indicate that the α tertiary element is
not absolutely essential for mobility. This result is interesting in that only the α deletion mutant is mobile, while
both the α' deletion and the α-α' double deletion are not.
This is in contrast to the results of splicing assays with the
group IIB introns aI5γ and Pl.LSU/2, where it has been
shown that the α-α' interaction is essential for splicing
[10–12]. This discrepancy could reflect the fact that the
mobility assay is more sensitive and can detect greatly diminished levels of splicing and mobility. It is also possible
that other structural features of Ll.LtrB or its interaction
with LtrA protein help it properly orient important regions flanking the α element.
Based on an earlier secondary structure of the Id(i-iii) region, the κ helix included positions 190–204 (Figure 2a).
A deletion of this sub-domain resulted in a frequency of
0.37%. However, when the structure was redrawn based
on comparative analysis (Figure 2b) [13], and the new helix containing the κ interacting element was deleted (nts
185–201), the frequency dropped over 1000-fold. These
results imply that the κ-κ' interaction itself may not be essential for the activity of the intron, but the overall structure of this region is critical. This is further indicated by
the deletion of the helix just above it (nts 205–210,339–
346), for which no mobility was detected. The finding
that κ-κ' is not essential is similar to a finding by Costa et
al., 2000 for the Pl.LSU/2 intron in which a deletion of the
entire ID(ii)a stem loop containing the κ element was still
capable of splicing [12]. Additionally, this element is absent from the introns S.p.cox2I1, P.a.cox1I4, A.m.cox1I3
and P.a.cox1I1, along with Id(ii)1 [13]. The loss of the interaction might also be compensated for by the intron-encoded protein. This is supported by a strong protein
enhanced crosslink between U191 (near κ in domain I)
and C2421 (near κ' in domain V) (Noah and Lambowitz,
unpublished data).
None of the other 11 sub-domain deletions in domain I
were mobile. Even the double deletion mutants α-α' and
β-β', which presumably affect local folding and hence
could be less deleterious overall, did not restore mobility.
The observed homing frequencies in the range of 10-3 –
10-4%, are close to the background level of appearance of
tetR colonies (~10-3 %).
Surprisingly, neither the single nor the double deletions
involved in the β-β' interaction are mobile. This interaction is not well conserved and is missing from some introns classified into the following structural categories:
bacterial classes B (B2-like intron structure), C (novel hybrid) and D (unusual B-like) [13]. However, this region
may be involved in protein interactions, based on strong
protein protections observed in this region [14]. Strong

Figure 2
Different local structures surrounding the κ element in domain I. Figure 2a indicates the deletion of nts 190–204 that
had a mobility frequency of 0.37% while figure 2b (deletion of nts 185–201) had a mobility frequency of <10-4.

protein protections are also observed in the Id4 terminal
purine-rich loop. In fact it is these two sites in DI, which
exhibit the strongest LtrA protections [14].
Domain II
From the mobility analysis it is clear that deletions in subdomains IIa and IIb are mobile to some extent, while a
complete deletion of domain II is not functional. 100% of
the colonies picked from both deletions were true homing
events (10/10). This is consistent with previous reports
where Bachl and Schmelzer (1990) [15] showed that a
partial truncation of DII leaving a short hairpin in the intron bI1, had no pronounced effect on splicing efficiency,
whereas a complete deletion eliminated the reaction. This
was also demonstrated in aI5γ [16]. The II(ii)a,b deletion
of nucleotides 404–459 was mobile to a small extent, (frequency 0.23%). This region includes the η interacting element, indicating that it may not be essential for mobility.

The η-η' interaction has been primarily observed to mediate a conformational change between the two steps of
splicing [17]. It is also missing from some mitochondrial
class A1 and bacterial classes B, C and D intron structural

groups, which may indicate that it is not absolutely essential for splicing.
Domain III
Many reports indicate that domain III is absolutely required for splicing in vivo and in vitro. Although its exact
function is unknown, it has been speculated to be involved in the formation of the catalytic core [9]. Besides
this, it was shown for the group IIB intron aI5γ that the
phylogenetically conserved basal stem loop contains one
of the most internalized regions of the molecule [11].
Here it was found that neither deletion in domain III
could be tolerated. Frequencies were at the background
level in both cases (<10-3 to 10-4 %) and no bona fide
homing events were found.
Domain IV
Domain IV is the most variable domain and has not been
shown to have a large effect on either splicing or mobility.
In fact the mobility frequency of the DIVb(1–2) deletion
is almost 70% of the wild-type intron, which is the highest
mobility observed for any deletion in this report. In this
case, 10/10 colonies tested were true homing events.

Surprisingly the deletion of DIVa (which is the primary
binding site for LtrA) exhibited a low level of mobility (6
× 10-4%), although the number of true homing events was
only 60 – 80%. This is likely due to residual binding
whereby LtrA recognizes other features of the intron to
promote splicing and mobility [[14,18], Cui and Lambowitz, in preparation].
Domain V
It had previously been reported that the invariant G at position 2 of the catalytic AGC triad in domain V was critical
for self splicing in vitro and in vivo. Here, point mutants of
this residue were made. Although the mobility frequency
(3 × 10-3 – 0.25%) was greatly diminished, G3A was the
least affected presumably reflecting a requirement for a
purine and/or base pair at that position, whereas G3C and
G3U had frequencies almost 100-fold lower. Interestingly, it was observed upon sequencing the isolated homing
products, that G3C and G3U were revertants back to G,
the wild-type nucleotide. By contrast, the G3A colonies
were verified to involve integraton of the G3A intron. For
the G3C and G3U revertants, the donor plasmids from
these tetR colonies were also isolated and sequenced to
verify that they had the original mutations.

In a mutational analysis of the same triad in the aI5γ intron, it was found that mutations at G3 were some of the
more deleterious ones in DV [19]. Revertants that restored
base pairing were also identified. Further, the G3U mutant
could not be rescued but the G3A mutant could, suggesting that a purine is required at this position, as seen in
Ll.LtrB.
Domain VI
A deletion mutant of the branch-point A (∆A54), along
with the other three substitution mutants A54G, A54C
and A54U were tested. Interestingly, the ∆A54 mutant
gave a frequency of 0.003%, but upon sequencing the
homing products, no true ∆A54 mutation was found. Instead, a variety of sequence changes surrounding the
branch-point A were observed in the homing products, although the original deletion mutation remained the same
in the donor plasmids (Figure 3). It appears that this mutation can be rescued by many kinds of secondary mutations as indicated. It was reported that group II introns
could go through a hydrolytic splicing pathway to generate a linear intron even without a bulged nucleotide [20].
Our findings suggest that if a linear intron is generated by
hydrolytic splicing of ∆A54, it is unable to carry out mobility. Hence, the branch-point nucleotide is absolutely
required for mobility.

Recently, the crystal structure of a 70 nucleotide RNA containing domains V and VI of the aI5γ intron was determined [21]. Surprisingly, it revealed 2 bulged nucleotide

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/3/17

residues in DVI instead of one. In aI5γ it is the branchpoint A and the following 3' nucleotide which is a U, that
are both bulged out. This appears inconsistent with the
revertant sequences here, which show selection for a
Watson-Crick base pair at the position 3' but not 5' to the
branch-point nucleotide.
Support for the observations in this report comes from
work by Chu et al., 2001 [22] on the aI5γ intron, in which
they propose that a 4 bp stem 3' of the branch-point is one
of the determinants for branch-point activation. Additionally, they state that a G:U wobble pair above the
branch-point is also a determinant, which fits in with the
observation that a non-canonical pair (A:A or A:C) is
found at this position in some of the revertants. More recent support for this upstream weak or non pairing with
simultaneous downstream pairing, was observed in all
lariat forming group II introns in barley chloroplasts [23].
Here 13/16 introns lacked Watson-Crick pairing above
the branch-point A and G:C was the downstream base pair
whenever there was an upstream A:C, A:G or G:G. Additionally, no barley intron was found, in which the upstream Watson-Crick pair coincided with a downstream
G:U or other weak pair.
All three branch-point substitution mutants tested were
mobile to differing extents with relatively high frequencies (0.67 – 2.02%), indicating that any base at the
branch-point position can function in mobility. 100% of
these products were true homing events.
Although it is specifically the N6 amino group of the
branch-point A that is recognized, many lines of evidence
suggest that the actual base at the branch site is not required to be an A. Naturally occurring introns have U (11
times), followed by G (5 occurrences) and C (1 occurrence) (Comparative RNA Web Site database: http://
www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/). In aI5γ, G and U at the
branch-point were found to allow for some branching to
occur [22]. Also, it was observed that even if the branchpoint residue was paired, it did not have a large effect on
splicing efficiency and no effect on the choice of the
branch site [20].
C was also found in the branch-point position in 8/25
∆A54 homing products. From previous reports it was noted that if the branch-point nucleotide was changed to a C,
branching was reduced [20,22]. In this case it is likely that
the sensitivity of our assay permits the detection of homing products. Surprisingly A54G, which demonstrated the
highest mobility among these three substitution mutants,
was not found in the ∆A54 homing products. It remains
elusive how the sequences were changed at positions surrounding the branch-point and why only C, along with
wild-type A, were selected at the branch-point, despite the

fact that A54G was slightly better than A54C in mobility
(Table 1).
Two additional combinations of mutants were made. One
containing deletions DIVb(1–2), DII(ii)a,b and the κ helix (190–204) that resulted in an intron that was 710 nts
in size, and a second one containing an additional deletion of domain Ib, which resulted in a reduction to 694
nts. However, both constructs exhibited no mobility.

the Ll.LtrB intron that retained mobility was 725 nts, resulting from the DIVb(1–2) and DII(ii)a,b deletions
(0.23%). The tertiary elements whose deletion does not
completely abolish mobility are alpha, kappa and eta.
Only the G3A substitution mutant in the catalytic triad of
DV was mobile, while the other two mutants were revertants back to G. In DVI, a branch-point nucleotide was
found to be essential for mobility. It was also observed
that any nucleotide at this position supported mobility to
some extent.

Conclusions
The largest deletions that preserved Ll.LtrB intron mobility were the 158 nt deletion in domain DIVb(1–2) and the
18 nt deletion in domain IIb. The smallest derivative of

Methods
Bacterial strains
E. coli HMS174 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used
for the genetic mobility assay. The cloning strain was E.
coli DH5α.
Construction of mutants
Intron deletions were made by overlapping PCR and
cloned into the donor plasmid pACD2 (see [24] for de-

tails). This plasmid carries a ∆ORF+ORF version of the intron that contains the T7 promoter in DIV (from which
the tetracycline resistance – tetR gene is expressed after
homing takes place). LtrA is also expressed from the
donor plasmid, but at a downstream location, outside the
intron. In this study, the donor plasmid has been further
modified to contain a 158 nucleotide deletion in DIVb(1–
2). It must be noted here that part of the DIVb helix

substructure is maintained by the insertion of the T7
promoter.
Domain I deletions that were upstream of the BsrGI site
(intron position 308), were cloned using the HindIII and
BsrGI sites on the donor plasmid. Deletions downstream
of the BsrGI site and the point mutants were cloned using
the BsrGI and PstI sites. All mutants were verified by
sequencing.
Mobility assay
The genetic mobility assay was performed essentially as
described in Guo et al., 2000 (Figure 4) [25]. In brief, the
donor plasmids (carrying the mutant or wild-type introns) were each co-transformed with a recipient plasmid
pBRR3, carrying a promoterless tetR gene downstream of
the target site (which are the ligated exons; positions -30/

+15). After IPTG induction (100 µM, 1 hour, 37°C) and
plating on ampicillin (100 µg/ml) ± tetracycline (25 µg/
ml) plates, mobility events were identified as ampRtetR
colonies. It is important to note that both the intron RNA
and LtrA protein are overproduced in this assay, which
might mask more subtle effects of these mutations.
At least 10 colonies were picked from each of the selection
plates and tested by PCR to confirm true homing events.
The PCR primers used were Rsense (recipient plasmid
primer)
5'-ACAAATAGGGGTTCCGCGCACA-3'
and
LtrBAs2 (intron primer) 5'-TTCTCCTACAGATTGTACAAATGTGG-3'. In the case of deletions Id3(i)1 and Id4,
the intron primer used was LtrBAs3 5'-GATTCTCGGCATCGCTTTCG-3'.

All positive homing products were isolated and sequenced
to verify the deletion. In the case of DV and DVI revertants, donor plasmids from the PCR positive homing
events were also isolated and sequenced to verify the mutation. True homing events were identified based on all of
these three tests – selection on plates containing ampicillin and tetracycline, followed by PCR verification and
sequencing.

version that was published as a Provisional PDF on 20 December 2002. A second author (JZ) was added and a considerable number of changes were made to the text,
although none of these altered the data or major conclusions of the study. Editorial approval was granted for these
changes, which were sanctioned by Alan Lambowitz, in
whose laboratory the work was carried out.
