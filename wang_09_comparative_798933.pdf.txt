Abstract
Background: Gene and genome duplication is the principle creative force in evolution. Recently,
protein subcellular relocalization, or neolocalization was proposed as one of the mechanisms
responsible for the retention of duplicated genes. This hypothesis received support from the
analysis of yeast genomes, but has not been tested thoroughly on animal genomes. In order to
evaluate the importance of subcellular relocalizations for retention of duplicated genes in animal
genomes, we systematically analyzed nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins in the human genome
by reconstructing phylogenies of mitochondrial multigene families.
Results: The 456 human mitochondrial proteins selected for this study were clustered into 305
gene families including 92 multigene families. Among the multigene families, 59 (64%) consisted of
both mitochondrial and cytosolic (non-mitochondrial) proteins (mt-cy families) while the remaining
33 (36%) were composed of mitochondrial proteins (mt-mt families). Phylogenetic analyses of mtcy families revealed three different scenarios of their neolocalization following gene duplication: 1)
relocalization from mitochondria to cytosol, 2) from cytosol to mitochondria and 3) multiple
subcellular relocalizations. The neolocalizations were most commonly enabled by the gain or loss
of N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signals. The majority of detected subcellular relocalization
events occurred early in animal evolution, preceding the evolution of tetrapods. Mt-mt protein
families showed a somewhat different pattern, where gene duplication occurred more evenly in
time. However, for both types of protein families, most duplication events appear to roughly
coincide with two rounds of genome duplications early in vertebrate evolution. Finally, we
evaluated the effects of inaccurate and incomplete annotation of mitochondrial proteins and found
that our conclusion of the importance of subcellular relocalization after gene duplication on the
genomic scale was robust to potential gene misannotation.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that protein subcellular relocalization is an important mechanism
for the retention and gain of function of duplicated genes in animal genome evolution.

Background
Gene duplication is an important evolutionary process
that plays a key role in generating new genomic information in all the three domains of life: Eubacteria, Archaea
and Eukarya [1-5]. Various processes can cause gene
duplication on the molecular level, including unequal
crossovers, retroposition, or whole chromosome/genome
duplication [6-8]. New functional genes resulting from
gene duplication are retained in the genome through the
processes of subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization [9,10]. Subfunctionalization refers to a situation
when each of the daughter genes adopts only a partial
function of the parental gene, while neofunctionalization
refers to the gain of new functions by the duplicate, usually related to their ancestor's function [4].
From the evolutionary perspective, neofunctionalization
presents more interest than subfunctionalization because
it results in the increase of the total genetic information
[11]. Several mechanisms have been invoked to explain
the gain of novel gene function for duplicated genes such
as dosage compensation, epigenetic complementation,
moonlighting, and catalytic promiscuity [12-17]. Interestingly, functional divergence can in some cases precede
(and facilitate) gene duplication through allelic divergence [18]. Recently, protein subcellular relocalization or
neolocalization has been proposed as a key event for generating new functional genes after duplication [19,20].
Such neolocalization can be achieved by the gain or loss
of N-terminal targeting peptide sequences that can direct
the products of duplicated genes from the cytosol to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplast or vice
versa.
The idea of subcellular relocalization underlying the gain
of function for duplicated genes has been tested in two
yeast genomes by Marques et al. (2008). The authors demonstrated that about one-third of the duplicated genes
retained in the yeast genomes had undergone protein subcellular relocalization following whole genome duplication [20]. A few anecdotal observations suggest that
neolocalization after duplication also occurs in animal
genomes [21,22], however the magnitude of this process
has not been explored. In this study, we performed a systematic survey of subcellular relocalization following
gene duplication in the human genome by analyzing
nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein families.
Mitochondria, cell organelles present in nearly all eukaryotes, are instrumental for the production of ATP through
oxidative phosphorylation process, and are also involved
in heme biosynthesis, cell metabolism, apoptosis, and Fe/
S cluster biosynthesis. The complex functions of mitochondria demand a proteome composed of over a thousand of proteins, more than 98% of which are nuclear

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/275

encoded, which suggests these organelles should play a
major role in the process of neolocalization [23]. Hence,
the exploration of nuclear encoded mitochondrial gene
families is an ideal system to test subcellular relocalization of duplicated genes in the evolution of animal
genomes.

Results and Discussion
Subcellular relocalization as a mechanism underlying
protein functional divergence
For this study we retrieved 456 human mitochondrial proteins from MitoP2 database http://www.mitop.de:8080/
mitop2/ that were also annotated as mitochondrial proteins in Swissprot database. Reciprocal blasting and single
linkage clustering were carried out to group the proteins
into 305 families, among which 195 were single gene
families (not considered here) and 110 were multigene
families. After removing 18 families with members that
appeared to be alternative splicing products or annotation
artifacts, we obtained the final dataset of 92 multigene
families for further analysis (Table 1). These 92 families
can be classified into two categories based on their designated subcellular localizations: 1) mitochondrialcytosolic (mt-cy) families that consist of at least one protein member localized in mitochondria and at least one in
another (non-mitochondrial) cellular compartment, and
2) mitochondrial only (mt-mt) families that are composed of protein members localized exclusively in mitochondria. The mt-cy category contained 59 families with
144 mitochondrial proteins and 196 non-mitochondrial
proteins in humans, while the mt-mt category had 33
families with 79 human mitochondrial proteins. This
result suggests that around two thirds of the mitochondrial multigene families have undergone subcellular relocalization after duplication.

For each human protein in the 92 gene families, we
retrieved orthologs in mouse (Mus musculus), chicken
(Gallus gallus), fish (Danio rerio), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) and nematode
(Caenorhabditis elegans) from the Homologene database at
NCBI. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted for each
family and the time of occurrence of gene duplications in
relationship to major divergences in animal evolution was
evaluated. Because this study is based on the human mitochondrial proteome, only branches of the phylogenetic
tree leading to humans were investigated. For mitochondrial-cytosolic (mt-cy) families that underwent several
rounds of duplications, we only considered the duplications that were followed by subcellular relocalizations.
Among the 59 mt-cy families, twenty-seven (45.8%) were
inferred to undergo gene duplication prior to the protostome/deuterostome divergence, twenty-nine (49.2%)
after the protostome/deuterostome divergence but before

that of fish/tetrapods and only three families (5%) within
the tetrapod lineage (Table 1). Among the 33 mt-mt families, eight (24%) underwent gene duplication prior to the
protostome/deuterostome split, nineteen (57.6%) prior
to the fish/tetrapod split and six (18.4%) within the tetrapod lineage. The observation that the majority of investigated families experienced gene duplication between the
protostome/deuterostome and fish/tetrapod divergences
correlates well with the two rounds of genome duplication at the early stage of vertebrate evolution [24,25].
However, the scarcity of more recent subcellular relocalization events is surprising, especially considering very
high rates of gene birth and death in animal genomes
[26].
Bidirectional relocalization of proteins encoded by
duplicated genes in mitochondrial-cytosolic (mt-cy) twogene families
In order to get insight into the direction of protein subcellular relocalization, we explored mt-cy gene families in
which human genes are represented by two copies, one
functioning in the cytosol and the other in mitochondria.
Among the 24 such families, one third appeared to have
its original function in mitochondria with the products of
duplicated genes being relocalized to other cellular compartments, another third showed the opposite direction of
protein relocalization and for the rest the direction of relo-

calization could not be determined due to the lack of outgroup information.
The arginase family, encoding enzymes that catalyze the
hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea, is an example
of neolocalization to the cytosol. Phylogenetic analysis of
this family shows that the product of the ancestral gene
had an original localization in mitochondria. Following a
gene duplication in the lineage leading to vertebrates, type
I arginase (ARG1) has relocalized to the cytoplasm while
type II arginase (ARG2) retained its ancestral mitochondrial location (Figure 1). The evolutionary rates remain
similar after the divergence of ARG1 and ARG2 genes.
Sequence comparisons indicated that N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signals were not found in ARG1 in
either human or mouse, but are present in all ARG2
sequences. The loss of N-terminal mitochondrial signals
suggests that ARG1 could not be transported into mitochondria and is retained in the cytoplasm.
The type IB subfamily of DNA topoisomerases that
includes DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and mitochondrial DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1MT) presents an example of neolocalization to mitochondria. DNA
topoisomerases control DNA topological states by catalyzing the transient breaking and rejoining of single
strand DNA, allowing DNA strands or double helices to
pass through each other [27]. These enzymes are essential

in maintaining DNA topology during replication, transcription, recombination and DNA repair. Our phylogenetic analysis of the type IB subfamily revealed a gene
duplication that occurred early in vertebrate evolution.
Following this duplication, the product of one copy of the
gene, TOP1MT, relocalized to mitochondria while the
product of another - TOP1, retained its ancestral cytoplasmic and nuclear locations (Figure 2).
Both TOP1 and TOP1MT consist of four domains: a N-terminal localization domain, a core domain, a linker
domain and a C-terminal domain [28]. Sequence comparisons show that the N-terminal domain of TOP1MT consists of a mitochondrial targeting signal, while the Nterminus of TOP1 contains a nuclear localization signal.
This implies that the change in the N-terminal targeting
sequence of TOP1MT helped the protein direct itself to
mitochondria and eventually to acquire a new mitochondrial function. It should be noted that the lack of TOP1MT
in invertebrates does not mean that type I topoisomerases
are not needed for mitochondrial replication and tran-

scription in this group. Recent studies have shown that
DNA topoisomerase IIIÎ± from the type IA subfamily has
mitochondrial localization in Drosophila melanogaster
[29,30].
Does subcellular relocalization following duplication
influence protein evolutionary rates? To answer this question we analyzed the relative evolutionary rates of duplicated genes in the mt-cy two gene families with wellresolved phylogenies and outgroup data. Three hypotheses were investigated: 1) Mitochondrial proteins generally
have higher evolutionary rates comparing to their
cytosolic counterparts; 2) The proteins involved in neolocalization have higher evolutionary rates; 3) Proteins
undergo faster evolution following duplication/neolocalization due to functional relaxation or positive selection,
with the evolutionary rates decreasing over time. To test
the first two hypotheses, we compared the average branch
lengths leading to mitochondrial and nuclear paralogs
following a gene duplication [(a+a')/(b+b') in Figure 3A].
For the third hypothesis, we compared branch length ratio

of mitochondrial vs. cytosolic proteins before and after
the divergence between tetrapods and fish (a/b and a'/b'
in Figure 3A). None of the proposed hypotheses was supported by our data (Figure 3B). Although some families
had clearly uneven rates of evolution in mitochondrial vs.
cytosolic proteins (e.g., Figure 2), most of the families displayed overall branch length ratios close to 1 regardless
the direction of relocalization (Figure 3B). Similarly in
some families mitochondrial proteins had higher evolutionary rates earlier in evolution (a/b>1) but lower rates at
later stages (a'/b'<1) while in others an opposite pattern
was observed (Figure 3B).
Multiple subcellular relocalizations after gene duplications
In addition to the two-gene families discussed above,
there are 35 mt-cy families with three or more (8 on average) members. Based on the current cellular component
annotation in Swissprot database, we inferred that at least
one third of these families had undergone multiple subcellular relocalizations. Class I sirtuin family presents a

relatively simple example. In humans this family consists
of SIRT1, SIRT2 and SIRT3 that regulate transcriptional
repression [31]. SIRT1, located in the nucleus, is a deacetylase that regulates the tumor suppressor p53, NF-ÎºB signaling, and FOXO transcription factors. SIRT2 is a
cytoplasmic protein that deacetylates Lys40 of Î±-tubulin.
Finally, SIRT3 is localized to the mitochondrial matrix
[32,33]. The phylogeny of class I sirtuins suggests that the
first round of duplication generated two copies with one
copy (SIRT1) localized to the nucleus, while the other
copy duplicated again resulting in one cytoplasmic copy
(SIRT2) and one mitochondrial copy (SIRT3) (Figure 4).
The N-terminal sequence analysis indicated the mitochondrial targeting signal was present in SIRT3 in all vertebrates on the tree except Mus musculus and Rattus
norvegicus. The loss of the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal of SIRT3 in rodents suggests the loss of relocalization to mitochondria, an inference supported by an
experimental demonstration that mouse SIRT3 actually
locates to cytoplasm [34].

Evolutionary rates in mitochondrial vs. non-mitochondrial proteins
Evolutionary rates in mitochondrial vs. non-mitochondrial proteins. (A) A schematic phylogeny of a mt-cy two gene
family with gene duplication occurred in the vertebrate lineage. Branch lengths before the divergence between fish and tetrapods are marked as a and b for mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins, respectively. The corresponding average branch lengths
after this divergence are marked as a' and b'. (B) The ratios of branch lengths for mitochondrial vs. nuclear paralogs (a/b, a'/b',
and (a+a')/(b+b')) were calculated on the maximum likelihood topologies as illustrated in (A) with the exception of the TST
family, for which the divergence between birds (chicken) and mammals was used. TOP1MT, TST, SHMT2 and CDS2 families
had undergone relocalization from cytosol to mitochondria, while the remaining 6 families had the opposite direction of relocalizations.

Expansion of mitochondrial proteome by gene
duplications
The presence of 33 mt-mt families among the 92 multigene families supports the notion that gene duplication
also contributes to mitochondrial proteome expansion
[35], although the average family size of mt-mt families is
smaller than that of mt-cy families (2.4 vs 5.7). Our phyl-

ogenetic analyses of these mt-mt families showed that
such duplications occurred at different stages in animal
evolution, predating the divergence of the protostome/
deuterostome lineages, within the vertebrate lineage, and
within the mammalian lineage. In general, these families
consist of proteins with similar functions that have been
retained by subfunctionalization as different subunits or

isoforms. Furthermore, the expression of these genes
often shows tissue specificity such that one copy in the
gene family is expressed ubiquitously, while the other(s)
is/are expressed in specific tissues. For example, human
SCO2 homolog (SCO cytochrome oxidase deficient
homolog 2 (yeast)) is expressed ubiquitously while the
SCO1 homolog is predominantly expressed in muscle,
heart, and brain, the tissues featured by high rates of oxidative phosphorylation [36].
Evolutionary modifications of relocalized proteins at
sequence level
Proteins synthesized in the cytosol can be directed to
organelles such as mitochondria via mitochondrial targeting sequences [37]. While targeting signals in protein
sequences can be located at the C-terminus and in internal
regions, they are most commonly found at the N-terminus [38]. Hence, we expected that a large fraction of mitochondrial proteins in the analyzed mt-cy multigene
families would have a mitochondrial N-terminal targeting
sequence comparing to their cytosolic counterparts. We
used targetP prediction [38] to analyze the presence of N-

terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences in human
proteins within the mt-cy families (Figure 5A). While over
80% of non-mitochondrial proteins lack a recognizable
mitochondrial N-targeting signal, over 50% of mitochondrial proteins have the signal (chi-square p-value is 3.06e15). This result meets our expectation that the gain or loss
of mitochondrial N-terminal sequences plays an important role in directing protein subcellular relocalization
after duplication. At the same time, the existence of mitochondrial targeting signals in approximately 20% of nonmitochondrial proteins and our inability to find such a
signal in 50% mitochondrial proteins indicates that the
N-terminal sequence is not the only modification. Similar
sequence modifications might have taken place at C-terminal or internal protein regions that are difficult to identify.
We further investigated the differences in protein functional domains between mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins based on a suggestion that protein
function and/or protein functional efficiency can be modified upon the change in its subcellular location [39]. Here

we compared the distribution of mitochondrial Pfam
domains that were previously found only in eukaryotic
(excluding human) mitochondrial proteins [40] among
members of mt-cy protein families. We found a significant
difference in this distribution (figure 5B): 53% of mitochondrial proteins have mitochondrial domains, but only
16% of non-mitochondrial proteins have such domains
(chi-square p-value is 3.5e-9). This result indicates that
subcellular relocalizations were characterized by the formation of mitochondrial protein domains or their loss in
nuclear copies during evolution.
Effects of inaccurate or incomplete cellular component
annotation
Knowing accurate protein subcellular localization is
important for this study. Although we combined information from several databases to infer protein functional
locations, uncertainty still exists in our assignments. To
check how these uncertainties would affect our results and
conclusions, we reanalyzed all human proteins in this
study by applying maestro scores, a scoring system for predicting nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins in
human and mouse that incorporates eight genomic-scale
data sets including targeting sequence prediction, protein
domain enrichment, presence of cis-regulatory motifs,
yeast homology, ancestry, tandem-mass spectrometry,
coexpression and transcriptional induction during mitochondrial biogenesis [40]. The maestro score distributions
of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins in our
dataset are separated with some overlaps (Figure 6). By
applying the suggested score cutoff (5.65) to assign subcellular locations to the analyzed proteins [40], we
observed 11 out of 59 mt-cy families were grouped into
mt-mt category; yet 5 out of 33 mt-mt families were clas-

sified to mt-cy families. Even if we do not count the 11
potentially ambiguous families into mt-cy category, still
more than 50% of all mitochondrial multigene families
have undergone subcellular relocalization after gene
duplication.
Limited knowledge of protein subcellular location also
prevents us from discovering cases of a different form of
subcellular relocalization, called sublocalization, in
which duplicated genes become targeted to a subset of
their ancestral cellular compartments [21]. For example,
the glutamate dehydrogenase family was grouped into
mt-mt families since both GLUD1 and GLUD2 are located
to mitochondria based on the Genbank and Swissprot
annotations. However Rosso et al. recently reported that
GLUD1 located to both cytoplasm and mitochondria
while GLUD2 became specifically localized to mitochondria owing to a single positively selected amino acid substitution at the N-terminal targeting sequence [21]. In
addition, if the ancestral protein had dual localizations
but only one of them was annotated, then neolocalization
would be inferred instead of sublocalization. The latter
problem should be especially pronounced if non-model

species are used as outgroups since the localizations of
proteins in these species are not thoroughly studied. To
investigate the potential effect of this bias, we searched
protein localizations in Drosophila melanogaster for the
families duplicated in the vertebrate lineage. None of
these Drosophila proteins are annotated to have dual
localizations. Thus available data suggests that neolocalization rather than sublocalization is the prevalent mode
of evolution of duplicated genes studied here.

Conclusion
Protein subcellular relocalization was proposed as an evolutionary mechanism for generating new functional genes
after gene duplication [19]. This mechanism was studied
in yeast genomes but only received support from individual cases/families in animal genomes [20-22]. Here we
systematically investigated human mitochondrial protein
families and found that around two thirds of multigene
families have protein members that underwent subcellular relocalization after gene duplication. These subcellular
relocalizations can occur between mitochondria and
another subcellular compartment as well as among several compartments. Comparative sequence analyses
showed that the subcellular relocalization processes were
primarily enabled via the gain or loss of N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences.
After evaluating possible effects of incomplete or incorrect
annotations, we conclude that our observation of the subcellular relocalization after gene duplication on the
genomic scale was robust to misannotations. Surprisingly
our results indicate a scarcity of recent subcellular relocalization events and suggest that protein subcellular relocalization was more important in obtaining new functional
genes at the early stages of animal genome evolution. The
observation that subcellular relocalization rarely follows
recent gene duplications needs to be further investigated
because our dataset might be biased in terms of annotation availability. This investigation, together with the previously published finding in yeast [20], indicates that
subcellular relocalization is an important mechanism in
the retention and gain of function of duplicated genes
over the course of eukaryotic genome evolution.

Methods
Retrieving human mitochondrial proteins and identifying
the paralogs
We
used
the
MitoP2
database
http://
www.mitop.de:8080/mitop2/ to retrieve human mitochondrial proteins [41]. MitoP2 is a manually annotated
database of mitochondrial proteins that integrates computational predictions, proteome mapping, mutant
screening, expression profiling, protein-protein interactions and cellular localization. Among 920 inferred
human mitochondrial proteins in MitoP2 at the time of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/275

our study, we selected 456 that were also annotated as
mitochondrial proteins in the Swissprot database. These
456 protein sequences were used to query the Swissprot
database using blastp program. The hit sequences with evalue smaller than 0.001 and bit scores equal to or greater
than 100 were kept for further analyses. Single linkage
clustering was then carried out to cluster the sequences
into 305 families [42].
Ortholog collection and phylogeny construction
Gene families were removed from analysis if all human
proteins in the family were products of alternative splicing
of the same gene or the records of the proteins no longer
existed in Genbank. For each human protein in the
remaining 92 multigene families, we retrieved orthologs
in mouse (Mus musculus), chicken (Gallus gallus), fish
(Danio rerio), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), mosquito
(Anopheles gambiae) and nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) from the Homologene database at NCBI. The subcellular localizations of proteins in each family were
inferred from Swissprot and Genbank databases. The protein sequences in each family were aligned with T-coffee
using the default settings [43]. The aligned sequences were
manually inspected and then imported into the Mega
package to construct neighbor joining and parsimony
trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates [44]. For each family,
we further performed a maximum likehood search with
100 bootstrap replicates as implemented in the PHYML
(v.2.4.4) program using the WAG model with estimated
amino acid frequencies and 4 gamma categories. The
inferred topologies were congruent among different treemaking methods except for some minor differences (not
shown). We selected maximum likelihood trees for illustrations.
Comparative analyses of protein sequences
For human proteins in each family, we retrieved information of N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (TARGETP), Pfam domains (MITODOMAIN) and maestro
scores developed by Calvo and coauthors for predicting
mitochondrial proteins [40]. The distributions of these
data were plotted in R package http://www.r-project.org/
for mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial protein members in the analyzed multigene families. The Pearson chisquare tests were applied to test whether the distributional
proportions of these genomic criteria were the same for
mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins.
