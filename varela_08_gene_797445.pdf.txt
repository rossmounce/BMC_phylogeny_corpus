Abstract
Background: The most recent Alu insertions reveal different degrees of polymorphism in human
populations, and a series of characteristics that make them particularly suitable genetic markers for Human
Biology studies. This has led these polymorphisms to be used to analyse the origin and phylogenetic
relationships between contemporary human groups. This study analyses twelve Alu sequences in a sample
of 216 individuals from the autochthonous population of Galicia (NW Spain), with the aim of studying their
genetic structure and phylogenetic position with respect to the populations of Western and Central
Europe and North Africa, research that is of special interest in revealing European population dynamics,
given the peculiarities of the Galician population due to its geographical situation in western Europe, and
its historical vicissitudes.
Results: The insertion frequencies of eleven of the Alu elements analysed were within the variability range
of European populations, while Yb8NBC125 proved to be the lowest so far recorded to date in Europe.
Taking the twelve polymorphisms into account, the GD value for the Galician population was 0.268. The
comparative analyses carried out using the MDS, NJ and AMOVA methods reveal the existence of spatial
heterogeneity, and identify three population groups that correspond to the geographic areas of WesternCentral Europe, Eastern Mediterranean Europe and North Africa. Galicia is shown to be included in the
Western-Central European cluster, together with other Spanish populations. When only considering
populations from Mediterranean Europe, the Galician population revealed a degree of genetic flow similar
to that of the majority of the populations from this geographic area.
Conclusion: The results of this study reveal that the Galician population, despite its geographic situation
in the western edge of the European continent, occupies an intermediate position in relation to other
European populations in general, and Iberian populations in particular. This confirms the important role
that migratory movements have had in the European gene pool, at least since Neolithic times. In turn, the
MDS and NJ analyses place Galicia within the group comprised of Western-Central European populations,
which is justified by the influence of Germanic peoples on the Galician population during the Middle Ages.
However, it should also be noted that some of the markers analysed have a certain degree of
differentiation, possibly due to the region's position as a 'cul-de-sac' in terms of Iberian population
dynamics.

Background
Alu sequences are a type of transposon from the SINEs
group that are found in the genome of primates, into
which they have inserted and expanded over the last 65
million years [1,2]. Some authors [1,3] maintain that only
one subgroup of Alu elements (Alu master) are active in
the generation of new copies, expanding in the human
genome at a rate that has been estimated at one insertion
for approximately every 20 births, a figure that supports
the importance of Alu sequences in the structuring of the
genome and their potential as mutagenic factors [4]. At
present some 1,500,000 copies of these elements exist in
the human species, representing approximately 11% of
the total nuclear genome [2,5].
As a result of the evolution of the sequences inserted in
the genome, at present various subfamilies of Alu elements are established that appear to have different genetic
ages [6-8]. The most recent Alu insertions have a different

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/79

degree of polymorphism in human populations [2,9],
which makes them suitable genetic markers to be used in
Human Biology studies. Furthermore, they are a type of
polymorphism whose ancestral state is known, the alleles
are identical by descent, as they are originated by a unique
event, and they remain stable in phylogenetic terms, as
well as being selectively neutral in the long term [10].
These characteristics have served to promote the use of the
polymorphisms of Alu insertions as a means of analysing
the origin and phylogenetic relations of modern human
groups [11,12]. Interest in their use has increased in recent
years due to their application in the identification of individual geographic origins [13-15].
Galicia is a historical region situated in the north-west Iberian Peninsula, and is the most westerly point of Europe
(the Roman Finis Terrae) (Figure 1). Its particular geographic situation in a corner of the Iberian Peninsula, to
some extent isolated from neighbouring territories, has

been one of the factors that has conditioned the idiosyncrasy of the Galician population.
The first data available on the population of Galicia comes
from stone tools, whose typology may be associated with
a stage prior to modern forms of Homo sapiens, some
200,000–300,000 years BP, coinciding with the presence
of similar tools in the north and centre of the Iberian
Peninsula. Archaeological evidence corresponding to the
Mesolithic and Neolithic periods is basically supported by
megalithic dolmens found throughout the whole of the
region [16], a megalithic culture that weakened at the end
of the third millennium BC, coinciding with the creation
of more permanent settlements and the beginning of
trade with Brittany, the British Isles and the peoples of the
Mediterranean. Iron metallurgy appears to have entered
Galicia with the arrival of peoples from Central Europe,
generically referred to as the Celts.
Roman domination of the north-western Iberian Peninsula, which began at the end of the first century BC, led to
the territory becoming more structured, with a gradual
disappearance of the hill fort settlements and a new political organisation in the most westerly Roman province of
Hispania, the newly named Gallaecia. After the fall of the
Western Roman Empire, in the early fifth century a series
of Germanic peoples settled in the Iberian Peninsula, one
of which, the Suebi, created a kingdom in Gallaecia which
by the end of the sixth century was fully incorporated in
Visigothic Spain, and would become configured as a feudal society based on agriculture and fishing.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/79

factors leading to high levels of inbreeding, influencing
the structure of consanguinity by increasing the number
of marriages between closely related family members
[17,18].
These historical vicissitudes and the region's geographic
characteristics have led to the Galician population having
a high degree of ethnicity, with its own language derived
from Latin – Gallego – making it complex, unique, and of
interest for anthropological research. The genetic structure
of the Galician population has been analysed with respect
to classic genetic and molecular polymorphisms [[19-25],
amongst others] and nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
[[26-29], amongst others], which have revealed the peculiarities of Galicia with respect to other Spanish populations.
The main objective of this study is to contribute towards a
more thorough understanding of the genetic variability of
the Galician population, characterising it through the
study of twelve Alu polymorphisms, and thereby establishing its phylogenetic position with respect to other
European and North African populations, offering new
genetic data that contributes towards clarifying how the
Iberian Peninsula was populated within the framework of
population movements in the European areas in general,
and the Mediterranean area in particular. The bibliography includes a work that has been published with the
results of typing the Alu polymorphisms APOA1, HS2.43,
HS4.65, Sb19.3 and Sb19.12 in the Galician population
[30], carried out using a smaller sample than that used in
this present study, and for which there is no evidence that
the sample was taken using a criterion of population proportionality in all of the territory of Galicia; also, there are
significant differences between the frequencies published
and those given in this study, which in two cases (Sb19.3
and Sb19.12) are highly significant (P < 0.01). Another
previously published work [31], which included the Alu
polymorphisms APOA1, ACE and D1, was carried out
with a different objective to that proposed in this present
study, as it analysed Galicia's four administrative provinces independently, using small samples from each province, and did not make a characterisation of the Galician
population as a whole.

At the beginning of the eighth century the peninsula was
invaded by the Muslims, whose biological impact in Galicia and the rest of the Cantabrian cornice is presumed to
be less than in other parts of the peninsula, as these northern regions were the refuge of the ruling Visigothic classes,
who created the Kingdom of Asturias from where the 'reconquest' would begin. From the eighth to tenth century
Galicia was repopulated, which served as a refuge for
immigrants fleeing from the areas occupied by the Muslims. During this period the tomb of the Apostle St. James
the Elder was discovered in Compostela, which led to the
creation of an important pilgrimage route that connected
Galicia with other European populations through the
Way of St. James.

Results

An important aspect in the dynamics of the Galician population in modern times was emigration, with large numbers of its inhabitants emigrating to Latin America from
the middle of the nineteenth century, and to other European countries during the second half of the twentieth
century. This migratory phenomenon affected the demographic structure of the region, and was one of the decisive

The insertion frequencies for the twelve Alu elements
studied in the Galician population are shown in Additional file 1, which also includes the genetic diversity values (GD) for each of these markers. In the HardyWeinberg equilibrium test, no significant deviations were
found for any of the loci analysed. The Alu element whose
frequency is closest to the fixation is Ya5NBC221 (0.961),
with HS4.65 having the lowest frequency (0.014).

BMC Genetics 2008, 9:79

As would be expected, the lowest GD values in the genetic
variability test correspond to the Alu insertions whose frequencies are closest to 0 and 1, as is the case with HS4.65
(GD = 0.028) and Ya5NBC221 (GD = 0.076), respectively. On the contrary, the highest values correspond to
insertions whose frequencies are closest to 0.5, as is the
case with Yb8NBC120 (Freq = 0.417; GD = 0.489) and
ACE (Freq = 0.382; GD = 0.474). On quantifying the
genetic diversity, taking the twelve Alu elements studied
into account simultaneously, a GD value of 0.268 was
obtained.
With the aim of representing the relative positions of the
populations included in the analysis with respect to the
genetic distances between them, calculated from the
matrix of insertion frequencies, a non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) was carried out. The representation
in the two-dimensional space configured by the first two
vectors is shown in Figure 2. Axis I clearly separates the
North African populations (North Morocco, West
Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Southeast Morocco and the
Sahara) and Eastern Mediterranean populations (the
Aromuns of Albania, Albanians and Turks, Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots and Greeks), which are situated in
the negative area, while the remaining European populations (Switzerland, Catalonia, France, Germany and Hungary, Galicia, Rumania, Andalusia, Macedonia, Basque
Country and Brittany) are situated in the positive area. In
turn, axis II separates the first two groups, situating North

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/79

African populations in the negative area, and all of those
from the Eastern Mediterranean in the positive area.
In order to verify if the relative positions of the populations in the space defined by the first two axes on the
scalogram correspond to real groupings, a cluster analysis
was carried out with Reynold's genetic distances matrix
between pairs of populations, and a consensus tree was
created (Figure 3), based on 10,000 trees generated by resampling, and based on the neighbour-joining method.
The tree structure makes it possible to identify three nodes
that cluster a further three population groups together,
which in turn correspond to the three geographic areas
differentiated in the MDS analysis.
Taking into account the fact that the previous results indicate that the populations included in the analyses may be
differentiated into three groups, an analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA) was carried out, in order to evaluate
the genetic structure of the populations with more precision, and the degree of subdivision or geographic distribution of the genetic diversity. The reliability of the three
groups is revealed by the results of the AMOVA analyses,
both in the case of the genetic between-group variation
when the nine markers are considered simultaneously
(χ218 = 74.82; P < 0.01), and when each is considered separately (Additional file 2). In the latter case, the genetic
variation among populations within groups (FSC) is not
significant for any of the nine Alu insertions, while there
are significant among-group differences (FCT) for six of

B65 (1.88%, P < 0.01), D1 (1.32%, P < 0.01), HS3.23
(0.94%, P < 0.01), HS4.65 (4.67%, P < 0.01). The intrapopulation variance (FST) was significant in six of the
markers: A25 (98.98%, P < 0.05), ACE (98.61%, P <
0.05), APOA1 (97.44%, P < 0.01), B65 (97.80 P < 0.1)
HS2.43 (99.12%, P < 0.05), and HS4.65 (95.79%, P <
0.01).
The results obtained after applying the method of
Harpending and Ward (1982) [32], shown in Figure 4,
make it possible to deduce that the majority of the populations from the European Mediterranean area do not
deviate to any major extent from the theoretical regression
line, with Galicia at a very short distance from the centroid, while the Basque and Breton populations are the
most distant from the theoretical prediction.

Discussion
In general, reconstructions of the recent history of human
populations based on genetic data, whether classic markers [33], nuclear DNA polymorphisms [34-37], or mitochondrial DNA [38], reveal a certain homogeneity in
European populations, perhaps greater than in other continents. This conclusion is given further weight by lower
differentiation index values amongst European populations, as is the case with the values of FST, and the fact that
on applying clustering methods to populations throughout the whole world, European populations are included
in a more compact cluster that those from other continents, reflecting the small genetic distances between
them.
With the aim of adding information to the proposed existence of a certain degree of uniformity amongst European

populations, the Galician population was analysed,
which occupies an extreme geographical position in Western Europe, and has been compared with other European
and North African populations, as explained in the objectives of the study. Alu insertion polymorphisms were
selected as they represent an important source of information about genetic diversity, both from the point of view
of current diversity, and variability throughout the process
of human evolution.
The frequency of the Alu insertions ACE, APOA1, D1,
HS2.43, HS3.23 and HS4.65 in Galicia have intermediate
values within the variability range of other populations in
the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe. As regards
the Alu elements Sb19.3, Sb19.10, Sb19.12, Ya5NBC221,
Yb8NBC120 and Yb8NBC125, less population information exists within their geographical surroundings,
although what is known makes it possible to deduce that
for the first five, the Galician population has values that
are slightly above the average. The exception is
Yb8NBC125, for which the lowest values known to date
in Europe were recorded in Galicia. These results may be
interpreted as evidence that Galicia shares the genetic
homogeneity of Iberian and European populations, and it
is most likely that when the number of populations typed
for the Alu insertion Yb8NBC125 increases, the Galician
population will be included within the European variability range, as is the case with the other Alu elements. Nevertheless, it is important to note that as a result of its

geographic position, the Galician population represents a
'cul-de-sac' in terms of the historical dynamics of populations in the peninsula, which justifies a certain degree of
difference with respect to other genetic markers [[24-27],
amongst others].
In the first level of comparison, using the MDS and NJ
analyses, the presence of three clusters was observed,
which are coherent with the genetic diversity that would
be expected as a result of historical dynamics and the
exchange of populations. According to the hypothesis of
demic expansion which followed the development of
agriculture, originating in the Middle East and which then
affected Central and Mediterranean Europe from the
beginning of the Neolithic Period, the genetic diversity of
populations from the Late Palaeolithic, probably resulting
from drift, underwent a slow but continuous process of
homogenisation as a result of the massive arrival of immigrants [39]. The exchanges of population that occurred
during the Roman Empire and later periods also had similar effects, although these had a greater impact on the
gene pool in Western Europe, affecting Eastern Europe to
a lesser degree. Despite the fact that Neolithic expansion
had the same effect in Northern Africa as in Europe, the
Straits of Gibraltar acted as a barrier between the two continents, limiting gene flow between North-western Africa
and Western Europe through the Iberian Peninsula [4042]. This justifies the fact that North African populations
appear in the MDS and NJ analyses as a separate group

Page 6 of 11

BMC Genetics 2008, 9:79

from European populations, although their position with
respect to dimension I of the scalogram indicates a greater
difference with respect to Western-Central Europe.
With regard to the Galician population, the MDS and NJ
analyses confirm its position as clustered with other Spanish populations and those of Western-Central Europe.
This result may be explained by common historical
dynamics, mainly based on two events that occurred during the Middle Ages, with the invasion of Germanic peoples, especially the Suebi and Visigoths, and the beginning
of pilgrimages along the Way of St. James, an important
route for cultural exchange, and even the appearance of
permanent settlements of Frankish peoples [43]. As
would be expected, these types of relationships would
have been accompanied by biological exchanges that
would have brought the gene pool of the receptor population closer to that of the immigrant population.
The results of the AMOVA analysis support the reliability
of the three clusters defined by the MDS and NJ, given the
statistical significance of the between-group variation
(FCT) for six of the nine markers, while the between-group
differences (FSC) are not significant for any of them.
The method of Harpending and Ward (1982) [32], which
uses the theoretic regression of population heterozygosity
and distance to the centroid as a valid indicator to analyse
the geographic model of genetic structure in populations,
has been applied to the populations of Mediterranean
Europe in order to evaluate the relationship of Galicia
with other populations in this area. In this case, the Galician population is very close to the theoretical prediction
line, as is the case with most of the populations in its geographical area included in the analysis, even Greece and
Turkey, two of the populations situated to the eastern
extreme of the area. The samples from Albania and Albanian Aromun are low outliers, which is interpreted as
being indicative of both populations being receivers of a
limited gene flow from the area; the samples from
Basques and Bretons are high outliers, a position that does
not necessarily imply that they recently received a greater
external contribution, but which is indicative of a series of
genetic differences with respect to the populations
included in the analysis that may be due to the effect of
the genetic contributions inherent to their origin.

Conclusion
Based on the study of the twelve Alu polymorphisms
included in this work, it may be deduced that the Galician
population occupies an intermediate position in relation
to Iberian and European populations, although considering its peculiar situation in the extreme west of Europe
and its condition as a 'cul-de-sac' within the Iberian
Peninsula, it has extreme values for some markers. The
predominance in Galicia of intermediate values in the fre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/79

quencies of Alu insertions contrasts with its geographic situation in the extreme west of the Iberian Peninsula, a fact
which, in the light of current knowledge, should be interpreted as a consequence of the interaction of autochthonous and migratory phenomena. This fact supports
the important role that migratory movements have played
in European populations, at least since the Neolithic
period. The MDS and NJ analyses situate Galicia within
the group formed by western European populations,
revealing the influence that invasions by Germanic peoples may have had on the Galician population in the Early
Middle Ages, and to a lesser extent, European pilgrimages
to Santiago de Compostela during the Late Middle Ages.

Methods
Population sample
Galicia borders to the south with Portugal, to the east with
the regions of Asturias and León, while the north and west
face onto the Atlantic Ocean. Today the region is divided
into four administrative provinces: A Coruña, Lugo,
Ourense and Pontevedra. It covers a total of 29,575 Km2
and its population, according to the last census in January
2008, is 2,783,100, equivalent to a density of 94.10
Inhabitants/km2. Two of the peculiarities of Galicia's
demographics are the eminently rural nature of its population and the highly scattered nature of its settlements; a
particularly significant feature is that in the last third of
the twentieth century, it had more than 31,000 centres of
population, with two thirds of the population living in
settlements of less than 1000 inhabitants [44,45], meaning that statistically there is more than one centre of population per Km2.

In an effort to guarantee that the sample analysed represented the variability of the Galician population, the territory was divided according to a geographic criterion into
eight coastal districts, and seven interior districts (Figure
5) [46]. The total number of donors in the fifteen districts
was 216 (n = 432 chromosomes) distributed in such a way
that the number of donors in each, with respect to the
total number included in the sample, had the same proportionality ratio as the number of inhabitants in the district with respect to the total population of Galicia
(Additional file 3).
Also, the conditions of anonymity and confidentiality
established by the Ethics Committee of the University of
Santiago de Compostela were strictly adhered to during
the process of obtaining the samples.
DNA typing
The genetic characterisation of the Galician population
was carried out by analysing the polymorphism of twelve
autosomal Alu insertions (ACE, APOA1, D1, HS3.23,
HS2.43, HS4.65, Sb19.3, Sb19.10, Sb19.12, Ya5NBC221,

with a level of Galician autochthony up to the third preceding generation.

The twelve Alu insertions were typed by PCR amplification, using the protocols and primers previously established by other authors, then carrying out electrophoresis
in 2% agar gel and staining using ethidium bromide (0.5
μl/ml); visualisation and documentation of the gels was
carried out using the Gel Doc 2000 system (BioRad) for
gel analysis and documentation.
Analysis of genetic data
The allele frequencies of the twelve Alu loci typed were calculated by direct counting. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test was carried out using the exact test to calculate
the P values from the Markov chains in the Monte Carlo
method [47] using version 3.11 (2006) of the Arlequin
programme from Excoffier et al. (2005) [48]. Intrapopulation variability was estimated using the unbiased index
of genetic diversity (GD), carrying out the calculation
using the method described by Weir (1996) [49].

In order to analyse the phylogenetic relationships of the
Galician population with other populations in its geographic surroundings, a comparative analysis at two levels
was carried out, using data on Alu insertion frequencies in
populations from the selected areas that had been previously published in the scientific literature.
The first level was carried out including populations from
Central and Southern Europe, as well as Northern Africa,
together with the Galician population in order to make
the comparison (Figure 1). It should be noted that no
populations were found in which the twelve Alu insertions analysed in this study were typed, meaning that in
the comparative analysis we omitted the Alu polymorphisms Sb19.3, Sb19.10, Sb19.12, Ya5NBC221,
Yb8NBC120 and Yb8NBC125, and in order to use a
number of markers that provides more reliable results, the
three Alu polymorphisms were included (TPA25, A25 y
B65) that had been previously studied in Galicia by this
team [50]. This meant it was possible to carry out the analyses using the frequencies of nine markers (TPA25, A25,
B65, ACE, APOA1, D1, HS3.23, HS2.43, HS4.65) in 22
populations [11,41,51-53] from the geographic area mentioned.
In the second level, using the same markers, a comparison
was made exclusively between the Galician population
and European Mediterranean populations, with the aim
of analysing the model of the genetic structure in the populations in this geographic area.
The relationships of affinity between the Galician population and other European and North African populations
were analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling
(MDS) (Kruskal 1964) [54] based on the inter-population
Euclidean distances calculated from the matrix of allele

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/79

frequencies. In this case the ALSCAL programme included
in the SPSS v 16.0 package was used.
Reynold's genetic distance matrix between pairs of populations [55] formed the initial basis for population clustering using the neighbour-joining method (NJ) of Saitou
and Nei (1987) [56], whose clustering reliability was
established using a bootstrapping with 10,000 iterations;
Reynold's distance calculation method, the NJ clustering
algorithm and the bootstrap are all included in the Phylip
3.6 phylogenetic analysis package [57]. The cluster analysis makes it possible to verify if the relative positions of
the populations shown on the scalogram correspond to
specific population clusters.
In order to determine if the genetic variation is structured
spatially, in the first comparison the MDS and NJ analyses
were complemented with an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) from Excoffier et al. (1992) [58]. The
AMOVAs for each Alu element were carried out using the
Arlequin 3.11 programme [48]. With the aim of evaluating the global significance of the three components of the
variance (FCT, FSC and FST), a simultaneous contrast was
carried out, taking into account the nine genetic markers
included in the analysis, whereby for each component the
critical global level (Pn) was calculated based on the critical levels (pi) obtained for each of the nine Alu elements
(n). The statistic used is defined by the formula:

degrees of freedom.
In order to study the geographic model of the genetic
structure of the populations from the European Mediterranean area, in the second level of analysis the model of
Harpending and Ward (1982) [32] was used, which
graphically represents the expected frequency of heterozygotes, according to the Hardy-Weinberg law, for each population with respect to the distance to the centroid, ri,
which is given by the formula
ri = (pi - P)2/[P(1-P)]
where pi and P, respectively, are the frequency of the Alu
insertion in the population i, and in all of the populations
included in the analysis as a whole.
In turn, Harpending and Ward propose an island model
of population structure in which there is a lineal relationship between heterozygosity and the distance to the centroid:

hi = H(1-ri)

where hi and H correspond to the heterozygosity value in
the population i and in all of the populations as a whole.
