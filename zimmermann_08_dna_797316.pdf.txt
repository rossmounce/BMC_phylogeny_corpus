Abstract
The extraction of genetic information from preserved tissue samples or museum specimens is a
fundamental component of many fields of research, including the Barcode of Life initiative, forensic
investigations, biological studies using scat sample analysis, and cancer research utilizing
formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Efforts to obtain genetic information from these
sources are often hampered by an inability to amplify the desired DNA as a consequence of DNA
damage.
Previous studies have described techniques for improved DNA extraction from such samples or
focused on the effect of damaging agents – such as light, oxygen or formaldehyde – on free
nucleotides.
We present ongoing work to characterize lesions in DNA samples extracted from preserved
specimens. The extracted DNA is digested to single nucleosides with a combination of DNase I,
Snake Venom Phosphodiesterase, and Antarctic Phosphatase and then analyzed by HPLC-ESI-TOFMS.
We present data for moth specimens that were preserved dried and pinned with no additional
preservative and for frog tissue samples that were preserved in either ethanol, or formaldehyde,
or fixed in formaldehyde and then preserved in ethanol. These preservation methods represent the
most common methods of preserving animal specimens in museum collections. We observe
changes in the nucleoside content of these samples over time, especially a loss of deoxyguanosine.
We characterize the fragmentation state of the DNA and aim to identify abundant nucleoside
lesions. Finally, simple models are introduced to describe the DNA fragmentation based on nicks
and double-strand breaks.

Introduction
Preserved tissue samples and museum specimens are a
vast repository of genetic information of interest to biological and medical researchers. These samples are important to cancer biopsy tissue research, forensic
investigations and phylogenetic studies based on
museum specimens, including extinct species. A recent
review outlines important considerations and guidelines
when working with specimens from museums and other
natural history collections [1].
DNA is repaired with great efficiency in living cells [2], but
this repair ceases upon death of the organism or preservation of a sample. Depending on the conditions of storage,
the DNA in such samples degrades more or less strongly
over time and often becomes inaccessible to genetic studies [3-6] (but see also [7,8]).
Formaldehyde is a commonly used preservative for field
collected specimens and cancer biopsy tissue [9,10]. Tissue biopsies are typically stored as so-called formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. FFPE's are
prepared by "dipping" the sample in a 3.7% formaldehyde solution for up to 24 h. In recent years, it has become
common practice to use a formaldehyde solution buffered
to pH 7.0 [11]. The unbuffered solution has a pH of ~4.5.
Such a drop in pH would lead to an increased rate of DNA
depurination. Samples will then be embedded in paraffin
for storage.
The reaction of formaldehyde with nucleic acids has been
studied in great detail. One of the earliest reports was published by Feldman in 1973 [12]. A number of reaction
products were reported but the main adduct observed is
the addition of a hydroxymethyl-substituent to primary
and secondary amine groups of the respective base. These
investigations were continued in a series of papers by von
Hippel and coworkers who describe the reactions of formaldehyde with free bases and a number of aromatic
amines, both for exocyclic amino and for endocyclic
imino groups [13-16]. Again, the hydroxymethyl-adduct
was reported to be the main reaction product. The reaction mechanism was investigated ab initio by Chang et al.
and found to be most likely base-catalyzed [17]. The consequences of tissue preservation with formaldehyde on
the integrity of the extracted DNA have been described in
a number of studies, see for example Lit. [18-21]
Many museum specimens, particularly insects, are stored
pinned and are not subjected to any further preservation
treatment [22]. While the exoskeleton of the insects is stable over many years, the soft tissue soon dries out and
decomposes. In a recent study, the effect of different
methods of killing and specimen storage on mitochondrial DNA content and PCR success from Drosophila simu-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/18

lans specimens was described [23]. The study showed a
significant impact of storage time on PCR success,
whereas the method of killing and the investigated storage
conditions had no marked effect. Main factors affecting
DNA during storage are expected to be partial dehydration
and exposure to air and light, all potentially leading to
diverse types of damage. The deamination of cytidine residues has been identified as a common miscoding lesion
in studies of ancient DNA [24].
In this study, our goal was to characterize on the molecular level the damage present in DNA samples from tissues
of preserved animal specimens. We use PCR-based assays
to some extent as a measure of usability of samples, but
mainly focus on the molecular characterization of the
DNA composition and the characterization of individual
lesions from genuine DNA samples.
Furthermore, we have developed two models to describe
DNA fragmentation by nicks and double-strand breaks
and compare our data to these models.

Materials and methods
Specimens
All moth specimens belong to the species Euxoa messoria.
They were collected over a 45-year period (Table 1) and
were preserved pinned with no additional preservative.
Specimens of three different frog species (Table 2) were
collected as part of ongoing research unrelated to this
study and preserved using standard methods (e.g., Lit.
[25]). Frogs were killed using an aqueous solution of chloretone and, for adult frogs, a sample of liver tissue was preserved in 95% ethanol. Adult specimens were then fixed
in 3.7% neutral-buffered formaldehyde overnight and
then transferred to 70% ethanol for long-term storage. In
large specimens (e.g., Astylosternus), a small volume (~1
milliliter) was injected into the body cavity during fixation. For tadpoles, a small piece of tail (mostly muscle)
was excised and stored in 95% ethanol; following common practice, the remaining specimen was fixed and
stored in 3.7% formaldehyde. Animal care procedures are
approved by the Harvard University/Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Standing Committee on the use of Animals in
Research and Teaching. An Animal Welfare Assurance
statement is on file with the university's Office for Laboratory Welfare (OLAW).

After returning from the field, tissue samples in 95% ethanol were stored at -80°C. For this study, another piece of
the same tissue (i.e., liver or tail) was excised from the
whole preserved specimens; these tissue samples were
transferred to 95% ethanol. To qualitatively evaluate the
effect of storage time and reduce the effect of species or
developmental stage on our results, we analyzed tissues
from adults collected over two different years, as well as

DNA extraction
Small aliquots of frog tissue (1–3 mg) were obtained from
the preserved specimens in March 2007. The tissue was
lysed and DNA was purified using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Extracted
DNA was stored in TE buffer at 4°C.
Table 2: Collection date of moth specimens

A leg from each moth specimen was used for DNA extraction, using the NucleoSpin96 kit (Macherey-Nagel). Elution was performed with 40 μl water. The eluate was
stored at -20°C.
Fragment analysis by capillary electrophoresis
An aliquot of 1–5 μl of extracted DNA was labeled with
Fluorescein-12-ddATP (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) using
Terminal Transferase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) according to the
accompanying protocol, resulting in a 10 μL reaction volume. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 1 h, then
applied to a Centri-Sep column (Princeton Separations)
[26].

For the removal of terminal phosphates on the DNA fragments, aliquots of 3 μl DNA were treated with 5U Antarctic Phosphatase (NEB) in a total reaction volume of 10 μl.
The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by
inactivation of the phosphatase at 65°C for 5 min. This
was followed by labeling with TdT as described above.
An aliquot of 1–2 μl of the eluate was mixed with 9 μl HiDi (Applied Biosystems) and 0.5 ml GENESCAN LIZ1200
size standard (Applied Biosystems). Samples were analyzed on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems),
using a 36 cm array, POP7 polymer, an injection time of
10 s and a total run time of 6200 s. An example of the raw

data used for fragment size determination is shown in Figure 1c for moth sample 3.
Raw data were imported into Origin7.5 (Microcal) for
detailed analysis. For the determination of the most abundant fragment size of a sample, the data curve for the FAM
fluorescence was subjected to smoothing, using the adjacent average method over 500 points. The smoothed
curve was fitted to a peak function, equation 1, to determine the position of the maximum (in scan numbers).

The fitting result for the size standard together with the
peak of the FAM fluorescence were used to determine the
most abundant size of DNA fragments in a given sample.
For the distribution of fragment sizes, the peak width (full
width at half height) was used, as determined from the fit
of equation 1.
For quantitation of total DNA content, a baseline was fitted to the total FAM signal, the signal was then integrated
using this baseline. As a test for the linearity of detection
in our CE, we used the Φ X174 DNA ladder (NEB) in a
serial dilution. We found a linear correlation between
data integral and sample concentration in the range of 2–
20 ng/μl (R = 0.997, data not shown).
DNA digestion
Extracted DNA was digested using a published method
[27] with modifications. Aliquots of 1–10 μl of extracted
DNA were incubated with 1 μl DNase I (2U/μl, NEB), 10
μl Snake Venom Phosphodiesterase (0.26 mU/μl, SigmaAldrich) and 2 μl Antarctic Phosphatase (5U/μl, NEB) at
37°C overnight. Using this procedure, unmodified DNA
was completely digested to the mononucleoside level as
judged by HPLC (data not shown).
HPLC separation
Digested DNA samples were analyzed on an Agilent 1100
HPLC system equipped with a Develosil RP-Aqueous C30
column (Nomura Chemical Co.). Solvent A was MilliQ
water containing 1% (v/v) formic acid and solvent B was
gradient grade methanol containing 0.25% (v/v) formic
acid. An elution profile was used of 2–20% B over 30 min
increasing to 98% over another 20 min then 98% B for 10
min and finally returning to 2% B over 20 min. The flow
rate was set to 20 μl/min and the eluate monitored at 254
nm. Typically, 4 μl of each sample were injected using the
well-plate sampler.
Mass spectrometric analysis
For mass spectrometric analysis the HPLC system
described above was connected directly to the sample
inlet of an Agilent ESI-TOF mass spectrometer. Mass spectral data were recorded in positive ion mode over the
entire duration of the HPLC run. Data were analyzed
using Analyst QS (Agilent).

Pulsed field agarose gel electrophoresis
For the detection of large DNA fragments, aliquots of the
frog DNA were loaded on a 1% agarose gel and separated
over 15 h with a switch time from 1–12 s and a voltage of
6 V/cm. The marker was PFG marker N0350 (NEB).
PCR
A 500 bp piece of the Euxoa messoa barcode sequence was
amplified using primers pJZ-moth1-se TTAGGTAATCCAGGATCTTTAATTG
and
pJZ-moth1-as
ATGATAATAATAATAAAAATGCAGT.
Amplification
was
performed with Taq DNA polymerase (NEB), with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min., then 30 cycles of
95°C for 15 s, 55°C for 10 s, 72°C for 30 s, and a final
extension at 72°C for 5 min.

Primer sequences for the PCR of frog mitochondrial 16S
ribosomal RNA correspond to those of Darst and Cannatella [28]. The primers for the first exon of the nuclear
gene for rhodopsin are ACGGAACAGAAGGTCCCAAC (5'
primer) and AGCGAAGAAGCCTTCAAAGT (3' primer).
PCR reactions were carried out with Phusion DNA
polymerase (NEB), with initial denaturation at 98°C for
30 s, then 30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 10 s, 72°C
for 45 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
Modeling of DNA nicking
An algorithm was written in C to simulate fragmentation
of double-stranded DNA by repeated nicking events. The
simulation required four input parameters: simulated
time period length (t) in years, DNA size (L) in megabases, nick rate (n) in nicks per megabase per day, and
proximity of opposite strand nicks (p) that result in a double-stranded break given in bases. The program initiates
the C library random number generator function so that
repeated calls to the generator will return uniformly distributed random integers between 1 and 2*L*106. Random number r will represent a nick on the rth position of
the forward strand if r <L*l06, otherwise the program
assigns the nick at position rc = r - L*l06 on the reverse
strand. The imaginary sequence is "nicked" n*L*365*y
times at positions indicated by the random numbers
returned from consecutive calls to the random number
generator. Next the program identifies where oppositestrand nicks occur within p bases, and records doublestranded breaks. Distances between consecutive breaks,
measured on the forward strand of DNA, give fragment
lengths. These are tabulated and reported in a size-sorted
list. The simulation is run with different combinations of
input parameters.

Results and discussion
I. Moth specimens
The analyzed moth specimens all belonged to the species
Euxoa messoria, a native of North America. The specimens

were preserved pinned and not exposed to other preservatives prior to DNA extraction.
The fragmentation state of the extracted DNA was evaluated by Capillary Electrophoresis. There is a general correlation between the age of the sample and the fragment
size, which gets smaller with increasing age of the sample
(Figure 1).
The samples from 2000 show a most abundant fragment
size of ~70 bp. The raw data show a considerable spread
of sizes, ranging from approximately 20 to 170 bp. All
samples from 1990 and older have a most abundant fragment size of approximately 50 bp. The distribution of
fragment sizes becomes narrower with sample age (see
Figure 1b) and is in the range of 20–100 bp for the oldest
samples from 1960. Within the storage period investigated here, this appears to be a semi-stable fragment size.
Notably, there is a small increase in fragment size for the
samples between 30 and 40 years of age (collected around
1970). The reason for this slight deviation from the general trend is not clear.
We were not able to determine the size distribution for the
youngest samples from 2005. We assume that DNA in
these samples is too big to enter the capillary or elute
within the observed time. On the other hand, the DNA
concentration was too low to be visualized by Pulsed Field
Agarose gel electrophoresis. The successful PCR amplification from these young samples (see below) corroborates
our assumption of the presence of large fragments. Fragments too small to be detected by capillary electrophoresis or a general lack of DNA would not lead to a PCR
product.
Analysis by fluorescent labeling followed by Capillary
Electrophoresis will only show the more abundant fragments. While the most abundant fragment size lies within
the range described above, there may be larger fragments
present in amounts sufficient for PCR amplification, but
too low for detection with this methodology. This seems
to be the case for the samples from 2000, for which a fragment distribution of 20–170 bp is observed, yet a 500-bp
product can be amplified from these samples. Alternatively, the 500-bp amplicon may be assembled during
PCR from smaller template fragments. This seems more
unlikely in light of the unsuccessful amplification from
older samples, which contain fragments of comparable
size to the year 2000 samples.
The CE setup used in this study is limited to fragment sizes
from 20 to ~1500 bp. Larger fragments would escape
detection. While the presence of large fragments cannot
be excluded based on our experiments, the accumulation
of two fragment populations that are very distinct in size

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/18

appears unlikely and to our knowledge has not been
reported before. Hence we conclude that the fragment
sizes observed via CE give an appropriate representation
of the DNA recovered from the moth tissue.
The fragment analysis is based on DNA labeling with
FAM-ddATP and Terminal Transferase. This reaction
requires the presence of a free 3'-hydroxyl group on the
fragments. If fragmentation occurred after formation of an
abasic site, two main mechanisms were described for the
ensuing chain break, either a β-elimination or the formation of a 3'-4'-cyclic phosphate [29,30], neither resulting
in a free 3'-hydroxyl. However, more complex mechanisms have been suggested [31], and the successful labeling is proof of the existence of such groups. It is possible
that only a small portion of the fragments present in the
DNA extract have a free 3'-hydroxyl group, but we assume
the underlying mechanisms of fragmentation to be
sequence independent, but see for example Ref. [32], and
hence yield a statistical representation of fragment sizes
resulting from different mechanisms. We found that treatment of the DNA samples with Antarctic Phosphatase
prior to labeling improved the amount of labeled DNA by
a factor of 2–10. (Figure 1C)
PCR amplification of a 500-bp segment of the cytochrome
oxidase I (coxI) gene was successful for the youngest samples, dating from 2005 and 2000 (Figure 2). However, no
amplicon was obtained for the older samples. We found a
seven-fold decrease in the amount of extractable DNA as
the samples increase in age (data not shown). Furthermore, as discussed above there is a decrease in average
extracted DNA size. A third possible issue is the presence
of base lesions that interfere with PCR.
We attempted to address whether base lesions could be a
problem in DNA amplification from these museum samples by using the LC-MS analytical technique. The moth
DNA was digested to nucleosides and applied to an LC-

An amplicon was only obtained for the samples collected in
2005 and weakly for samples from 2000. All other reactions
show only primer dimers.

The absolute area of the individual peaks depends on the
sample concentration, which differs between the different
extracts of moth DNA. A determination of the concentration by measuring the A260 values was not attempted due
to the small available sample amounts. This makes it
impossible to compare dG contents of different samples
by a direct comparison of peak areas. We therefore consider the ratios of peak areas within each sample, namely
the area ratios of dA/dT and of dG/dC. While the numerical value of these ratios has no physical meaning, it is
expected to remain constant if the base composition of
the different samples remains the same. This is expected
for DNA samples from the same species, assuming no
DNA degradation.

They are not present in the youngest specimens.

MS. Figure 3 shows the UV chromatogram for the digest of
a sample collected in 1974, sample 30. In the chromatogram the four deoxynucleosides can be readily identified
based on their elution times and masses. There is also
some indication of the presence of deoxyuracil. This may
be due to the presence of a cytosine deaminase in the
DNase I preparation and hence would be an artifact of
sample preparation [Zimmermann J: unpublished
results]. Four other significant peaks have been labeled 1,
2, 3 and 4 with exact masses of 245.07(5), 380.03(4),
367.17(6) and 355.18(7) Da, respectively. Based on their
mass alone it has so far not been possible to identify these
compounds with confidence. Work to identify them using
MS/MS techniques is in progress.
Interestingly, when comparing the UV chromatograms for
all the moth samples, it became apparent that the peak for
dG became smaller for the older samples, while peaks for
the other nucleosides remained largely similar in intensity. The dG peak can only be detected in the UV chromatograms of the youngest samples. The dG ion can be
extracted from the Total Ion Current of the mass spectrometry run for each sample as an Extracted Ion Chromatogram (XIC), to give a more accurate picture. In this way,
dG can be detected in all but the samples older than 1970.
No peak for dG is detectable in the mass spectra of the
oldest samples from 1965 and 1960.

We do observe a reasonably constant value for the dA/dT
ratio (Figure 4a). There is some variation between years,
and a relatively large bandwidth of values within samples
from a given year, nonetheless the ratio stays mainly
around a value of ~0.10. In contrast, the dG/dC ratio
declines rapidly from a value of ~6 to ~1 during the first
15 years of sample preservation and remains low for the
older samples (Figure 4b). As seen above for DNA fragmentation (Figure 1a), there is a small increase in the ratio
for the samples from around 1970.
Taken together, the observation of the diminishing peak
for dG in the mass spectrometric analysis, the persistence

analysis, ions of the four deoxynucleosides were extracted
from the total ion currents and resulting peaks were integrated. The plot shows the ratios of integrals for dA/dT and
dG/dC, respectively. While the dA/dT ratio stays fairly constant over time, the dG/dC ratio drops very much. Indeed,
dG cannot be detected in the oldest moth samples.

of peaks for the three other nucleosides, and the decreasing ratio of the dG/dC peak areas show a striking effect of
storage time on the dG content of DNA in these samples.
The fate of the dG residues is currently under investigation. At this point we do not know whether the loss of dG
is due to depurination and the creation of an abasic site,
or to a specific base modification. A combination of the
two processes seems possible, in which certain chemical
modifications of the base lead to an increased rate of
depurination of the modified residue versus normal dG.
The resulting abasic site is prone to hydrolysis and would
thus facilitate fragmentation of the DNA. A commonly
observed oxidative lesion is 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine. We
analyzed selected samples for this compound by creating
an XIC from the ESI-TOF data, searching for ions with a
mass of 284 – 285 m/z (exact mass of 8-oxo-dG: 283.09
Da). We did not find the compound with this strategy and
conclude that, if present, the amounts of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine in the extracted and digested DNA samples must
be too low to be detected in this way. Using the same
approach, we also searched for 7-Hydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (Fapy-desoxyguanosine, exact mass: 285.11 Da), a
compound sometimes found in samples containing 8oxo-dG and a possible reaction product of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine. Again, we did not find this compound.
II. Frog specimens
At the turn of the last century, formaldehyde came into
wide usage for preservation of biological material. Exposing or simply maintaining a specimen in formaldehyde
had the benefit of preserving sample morphology much
more effectively than ethanol alone. Unfortunately, formaldehyde inhibits modern genetic analytical techniques
such as PCR and DNA sequencing. This may be due to formaldehyde-induced crosslinks or adducts or to the fact
that formaldehyde solutions need to be periodically buffered with phosphate buffer to prevent a precipitous drop
in pH due to formic acid formation. Although these formaldehyde effects are all problematic, work is on-going to
determine the specific problem. We therefore chose to
analyze actual museum specimens that had been exposed
to formaldehyde during preservation. Because of an unrelated research project, it was possible to obtain tissue samples from individual specimens that had been preserved
using different combinations of formaldehyde treatment
and ethanol (Table 2). For two species, samples were
available that were collected during different field seasons
thus enabling us to evaluate at the short term effect of storage in ethanol or formaldehyde. For tissues from a given
specimen, all samples were of the same tissue (liver or tail
musculature), approximately equal size, and prepared by
the same person (DCB). The result of the tissue lysis and
concentrations of extracted DNA (as determined from the
A260) are given in table 3. As was later found by LC analysis (see below), the samples contain significant amounts

of RNA. The concentrations given in the table hence are
the sum of DNA and RNA in each extract. Samples were
first characterized by Pulsed Field Gel electrophoresis
(Figure 5). The average fragment size from specimens preserved only in ethanol is approximately 18 Kbp, with a
range from approximately 11 to 23 Kbp. DNA extracts
from formaldehyde-exposed specimens show no detectable DNA on this gel, with the exception of sample 7b,
which shows a weak smear.

The samples were used as templates for the PCR amplification of one mitochondrial and one nuclear gene fragment. Amplification of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal
RNA gene was successful for all samples preserved only in
ethanol (Figure 6, panel A). The same experiment showed
mixed results for the formaldehyde-exposed samples.
Samples 1b-4b yielded a very low amount of product,
barely visible on the gel. Samples 5b and 7b yielded a
much higher amount of product and were collected more
recently. Samples 6b and 8b show no detectable product
on the gel; both specimens are tadpoles that were stored
in 3.7% formaldehyde for approximately a year before tissues were excised and transferred to 95% ethanol for these
analyses.
The formaldehyde-exposed samples giving small to good
product amounts were only fixed in formaldehyde and
then transferred to ethanol. Of these, the youngest two
samples 5b and 7b (i.e., those preserved for the shortest
time) yield the largest amount of product. Samples 6b and
8b were preserved only in formaldehyde since their collection and no product can be obtained from them. As was
described previously [33], there is a clear negative correlation between exposure time to formaldehyde and success
of PCR.
Amplifications of the nuclear rhodopsin gene were more
difficult to achieve from these samples. This is clearly due
to the abundance of the mitochondrial gene at several
hundred or thousand copies per cell, as opposed to only
two copies for each nuclear gene.

4a and 7a. As there is no obvious correlation between the
ability to amplify this nuclear gene and the preservation,
sample age, or developmental stage, the variation in these
results is most likely stochastic in nature. They may reflect
small differences in the actual process of sample preservation, tissue morphology (i.e., ease or difficulty of tissue
lysis and DNA extraction from different tissues) and variations in DNA yields during the extraction process.
In our hands it was not possible to amplify the rhodopsin
target sequence from the formaldehyde-exposed tissues.
Aliquots of the frog DNA were digested to the nucleoside
level, separated by HPLC, and components identified by
ESI-TOF-MS. A representative UV chromatogram is shown
in Figure 7 for sample 1a. The four standard deoxynucleosides can readily be identified based on their retention
time and mass. This chromatogram also shows significant
amounts of ribonucleosides, showing that RNA was not
digested completely before DNA purification and inadvertently copurified in the DNA extraction process. Figure
8 shows comparisons of UV chromatograms for the ethanol-preserved samples as well as for the formaldehydeexposed samples. There is some variation in the overall
amount of extracted DNA in each of the two groups. In
comparison, the amount of DNA extracted from the formaldehyde-exposed specimens is strikingly lower than
that from ethanol-preserved specimens. New peaks, hinting at the formation of adducts in either group, are not
apparent. It is currently unclear whether the DNA is
crosslinked within the tissue and cannot be extracted, or is
degraded heavily by the formaldehyde treatment, in par-

The rhodopsin sequence can be amplified for samples 1a,
2a, 5a, 6a and 8a, but not for the remaining samples 3a,

shows the same amplification from formaldehyde-exposed
samples (sample 1b-8b). Panel C shows the amplification of a
500-bp segment of the nuclear rhodopsin gene (sample 1a8a) from ethanol preserved samples. No product was
observed for the rhodopsin gene with samples 1b-8b, which
were exposed to formaldehyde during preservation.

which was preserved in formaldehyde for different lengths
of time, mechanically homogenized and then lysed by
treatment with a standard lysis buffer and Proteinase K at
55°C. This treatment leads to complete solubilization of
fresh tissue within one hour for a piece of tissue of ~100
mg. In contrast, tissue fixed with formaldehyde for as
short as a few minutes will not dissolve completely even
after several days of incubation at 55°C, repeated spiking
with Proteinase K or use of increased concentrations of
chaotropic agents, such as 8 M guanidinium. We suggest
that most of the DNA in samples preserved in formaldehyde is crosslinked intricately to the surrounding tissue
components and cannot be extracted by standard DNA
extraction methods.
Numerous lesions in DNA exposed to formaldehyde have
been described in studies using nucleotides or isolated
DNA [34,35]. Presumably, similar lesions occur in whole
tissue. This was recently demonstrated for the first time for
DNA from rats [36]. The animals were treated with Nnitrosodimethylamine or 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3pyridyl)-1-butanone. Both compounds release formaldehyde in vivo after they have been modified by enzymes of
the P450 family. While this shows the formation of formaldehyde-induced crosslinks in vivo for the first time,
concentrations of free formaldehyde in the study were
very much lower than those encountered in formaldehyde
preservation of tissues, therefore apparently crosslinking
some DNA bases while not preventing DNA extraction.
The effective formaldehyde concentration during standard tissue fixation is considered to be much higher, and
hence lead to much more extensive crosslinking.

those samples preserved only in ethanol. The overall concentration of extracted DNA varies somewhat, but no extra

lesions or formaldehyde adducts, are not apparent.

ticular the concomitant drop in pH, which leads to an
increased rate of depurination/depyrimidination.
As expected, differences between the different frog species
or between different developmental stages were not
observed in these experiments.
The main obstacle in obtaining DNA from formaldehydepreserved samples appears to be the early stage of DNA
extraction, rather than specific lesions that inhibit PCR
amplification. We performed tests with mouse liver tissue,

The very nature of the crosslinks formed in the process of
formaldehyde fixation seems to prevent the DNA from
being extracted from the tissue. While we assume such
crosslinks to be present, we have not yet been able to
extract DNA with such modifications from the tissue and
make it available for further analysis.
III. Modeling DNA fragmentation
In order to better understand the observed fragmentation
pattern of the moth DNA samples, we considered two
main sources of fragmentation, simultaneous doublestrand breaks and nicking, and applied simple mathematical models for the two processes. We make no assumptions as to the cause of nicks and strand breaks in this
model, and do not account for changes in the rate of DNA
degradation over the storage time.

These models were first motivated by our findings from
the moth DNA samples. The change in average fragment
size from 70 bp in seven-year-old samples to 45 bp in 40year-old samples seemed surprisingly small, and the fragmentation in the youngest samples very high. We first

Figure 9
Modeling of DNA fragmentation
Modeling of DNA fragmentation. Two models of DNA
fragmentation were analyzed. Model 1 is based on doublestrand breaks. Panel A.1 shows the resulting average fragment sizes that occur over time for an initial fragment length
of 1 Mbp, assuming different rates of strand breaks per day.
Panel A.2 shows fragment sizes resulting from different initial
lengths of DNA, for a rate of two strand breaks per day.
Model 2 is based on nicking of single strands in doublestranded DNA. Panel B shows the distribution of fragments
resulting from a starting size of 1 Mbp, at a rate of 18 nicks
per day.

used a simple approach to model fragmentation patterns
resulting from double-strand breaks. Such a model can
give some insight into the observed fragment sizes of the
moth DNA, to be complemented by a model based on
nicking, see below. We assumed a correlation for the size
distribution of a DNA strand affected by a certain number
of strand breaks per time as shown in equation 3:

l
lt = 0
B×t
l0: initial length of DNA
B: number of strand breaks per day
t: time in days
lt: average fragment size after time t
The resulting development of the average fragment size
over a period of forty years is shown in Figure 9A. For a
starting length of 1 Mbp, a fast drop in the first five years
is followed by a much more gradual change. After reaching an average size of 200 bp after 7 years, it would take
another 63 years for the average fragment size to go down
to 20 bp, always assuming a constant rate of introduction
of strand breaks. Accordingly, starting from 10 Mbp, it
would take 700 years to get to 20 bp pieces. This model is
an approximate reproduction of the observed change in
fragment size as described above, in that we observe the
same gradual change over an extended age range of samples, after an (assumed) initial fast drop.

Figure 9

Trying to fit this model to our data was not successful, primarily due to the lack of experimental data for very early
stages of fragmentation. Also, double-strand breaks will
not be the only source of DNA fragmentation, so that it
may not be feasible to describe the experimental data
based on this process alone.

Therefore, we modeled the accumulation of nicks, e.g.,
single-strand breaks, over time. Assuming that two nicks
on opposing strands of DNA will lead to a double-strand
break if they are separated by ten or fewer base pairs, we
calculated the resulting distribution of fragment sizes and
the change of this distribution over time. This can lead to
a prediction of longer fragments of DNA in samples that
are overall dominated by shorter fragments. This in turn
may determine the feasibility of amplifications of larger
sequence stretches from older samples.
The results are shown in Figure 9B. We assumed a rate of
nicking of 18 nicks per day, based on previously reported
estimates [37]. Starting from an initial size of 1 Mbp, the
predicted fragment size drops rapidly and is below 2 Kbp
after only five years even for the remaining larger fragments. After 15 years, most fragments are predicted to be
smaller than 300 bp.
In combination, the two models of double-strand breaks
and nicking highlight the scope and limitations associated
with the amplification of DNA from stored and aged samples. The trends observed in the models correspond well
with our findings from moth DNA samples. Fresh DNA
samples pose practically no limit to the length of amplifiable DNA stretches, yet the amplifiable fragment length in
preserved tissues declines very rapidly, and fragmentation
appears to be the main reason for failure of amplification
of longer sequences, more deleterious than the accumulation of specific base lesions.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/18

DNA barcodes, a longer barcode sequence can only be
concatenated from shorter subsequences of 100 bp or less.
Our investigation of DNA extraction and characterization
of frog tissue preserved in ethanol or formaldehyde corroborates many findings reported previously by other
researchers. Tissue lysis is the main obstacle in obtaining
DNA from formaldehyde-exposed tissues. The DNA yield
is low, but extractable DNA does not exhibit major base
lesions, suggesting that crosslinked DNA was not extractable.
This study should guide future projects in a) the choice of
preservation: Combined with a wealth of research in the
past, our study reinforces that samples must not be
exposed to formaldehyde if the contained DNA is to be
utilized in any kind of downstream process; and b) the
design of sequencing projects on stored insect and tissue
samples, with regard to amplicon length and expected
fragmentation.

Authors' contributions
Both models are based on the accumulation of a certain
number of lesions after a given time and make no assumptions on the rate of introduction of such lesions. This rate
may well be variable in real samples over time, depending
on sample composition and storage/preservation conditions.

Conclusion
We investigated the molecular properties of DNA samples
extracted from museum specimens. DNA extracted from
individual moth specimens stored between 5 and 40 years
was subjected to fragment analysis and HPLC-MS analysis. We showed the degree and progress of fragmentation
in these samples and corroborated the observed fragment
sizes by two models of fragmentation. These findings may
aid in the design of studies utilizing such samples, and
help researchers to make educated guesses about the
amplicon size that may reasonably be expected from a
sample of a given age stored under comparable conditions. In particular, we found that a 500 bp amplicon can
readily be obtained from samples up to ten years in age,
whereas shorter sequences need to be targeted in older
samples. With respect to using such samples to obtain
