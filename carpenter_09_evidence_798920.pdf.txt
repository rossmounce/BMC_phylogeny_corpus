Abstract
Background: ADARs are RNA editing enzymes that target double stranded RNA and convert
adenosine to inosine, which is read by translation machinery as if it were guanosine. Aside from
their role in generating protein diversity in the central nervous system, ADARs have been
implicated in the hypermutation of some RNA viruses, although why this hypermutation occurs is
not well understood.
Results: Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the
sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster. The clustering of these
mutations and the context in which they occur indicates that they have been caused by ADARs.
However, ADAR-editing of viral RNA is either rare or edited viral RNA are rapidly degraded, as
we only detected evidence for editing in two of the 104 viral isolates we studied.
Conclusion: This is the first evidence for ADARs targeting viruses outside of mammals, and it
raises the possibility that ADARs could play a role in the antiviral defences of insects.

Background
Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) are RNAediting enzymes that target regions of double stranded
RNA (dsRNA), converting adenosine (A) to inosine (I)
[1]. Because I base-pairs with cytidine (C), during reverse
transcription these Cs are then base-paired with guanosine (G) when the second strand is made, and so editing
events show up as changes from an A to a G when
sequenced. Similarly, the conversion of A to I is read by
the translation machinery as if it were guanosine, and so
editing events alter the protein sequence encoded by
edited mRNA (see [2] for review).

Previous studies have shown that ADARs act on dsRNA of
~100 bp or longer, modifying anywhere from a single
base to up to 50% of the adenosines [3] and have a strong
5' neighbour preference (A = U >C >G), rarely targeting
adenosines less than three nucleotides from the 5' terminus, or eight nucleotides from the 3' terminus [4,5].
In mammals [6], Drosophila [7] and squid [8] most of the
ADAR-edited transcripts are expressed in the central nervous system and are thought to allow more than one protein to be produced from a single gene. Among these
edited transcripts are genes involved in ion channels,

including the glutamate-gated ion channel receptors (GluR) [6] and serotonin (5-HT2c) receptor in humans [9],
and the glutamate-gated chloride-channels [10], calciumchannels [7] and sodium-channels [11] in Drosophila.
ADAR-editing in these ion-channel transcripts generates
huge protein diversity within the nervous system, for
example, cacophony--a voltage-gated calcium channel in
Drosophila--is edited at 10 different sites, potentially generating more than 1000 different isoforms [11].
Aside from editing mRNAs in the central nervous system,
ADARs also target transposable elements [12,13] and
RNA viruses: A to G mutations thought to be caused by
ADARs have been found in vesicular stomatitis virus
(Rhabdoviridae) [14], in three retroviruses; human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), rous-associated
virus (RAV-1) and avian leucosis virus (ALV) [15-17]; two
paramyxoviruses; human respiratory syncyial virus (RSV)
and measles virus [18,19]; the polyoma virus (PV: Polyomaviridae) [20] and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) [21].
In the case of HDV, the mutations occur at specific sites in
the viral RNAs, but in most other viruses the A to G mutations can occur throughout the viral genomes, and typically involve the hypermutation of ~50% of As to Gs
within a defined region. Although it is unclear whether
this hypermutation is harmful to viruses, there is evidence
that hyper-editing of viral transcripts prevents them from
being transported into the cytoplasm [20]. Further to this,
Scadden [22] describes a nuclease that cleaves edited
dsRNA in Drosophila, providing the first tentative evidence
for ADARs being involved in tagging viral RNAs for degradation.
In this study, we describe evidence for ADAR caused
hyper-editing in the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA
virus that is a pathogen of D. melanogaster. We found
hypermutation of A to G in two viral lines, with the mutations being biased towards sites that are predicted to be
preferred by ADAR. This is the first evidence to suggest
that ADAR targets viruses in insects.

Results and Discussion
Results
Evidence of hypermutation in viruses
We initially sequenced ~5,700 bp of the viral genome
from two sigma virus lines (A3 and A3-E55), which
shared a common ancestor about 15 years ago and found
25 nucleotide differences between them. Using an outgroup, we assigned these mutations to either the lineage
leading to A3 or A3-E55 and found a significant difference
in the number of mutations on the two lineages (χ2 =
11.58, d.f. = 1, P < 0.001), with 21 of the 25 mutations
occurring on the A3-E55 lineage. All 21 of these changes
were from A to G in the positive sense replication intermediate, and all but one were clustered within a 565 bp

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/75

region of the gene encoding the PP3 protein (Figure 1;
permutation test of clustering: P < 0.0001). Thirteen of
these 21 changes were nonsynonymous (i.e. they change
the amino acid sequence encoded by the gene). The four
mutations on the other A3 lineage were not clustered, nor
were they changes from A to G (A3 mutations: two G to A,
one C to U and one C to A).
Because ADARs are known to edit As to Gs in other RNA
viruses, we examined the mutations we found in our viral
line to see if they were characteristic of ADAR-type editing.
ADARs prefer to edit adenosines that don't have a 5' guanosine [4,5]. To test whether preferred sites were more
likely to have mutated in our viral sequence, we reconstructed the sequence of the common ancestor of our two
strains using an outgroup and compared the frequency of
changes at preferred sites with those at un-preferred sites.
We found that within the 571 bp hypermutated region,
none of the 32 As that were preceded by a G had been
mutated. However, 20 of the 109 As at preferred sites had
been mutated to a G. This paucity of guanosines preceding
mutated sites is significant when compared to unchanged
sites (Fisher's Exact Test P = 0.007, see Table 1), suggesting
ADARs are indeed responsible for the mutations.
We went on to look for evidence of similar hypermutation
events in 102 wild sigma isolates by sequencing ~5,100 bp
region of the genome. We were interested in recent mutations that could have been caused by ADAR, so we examined only mutations that were found in just one of the
viral sequences (singletons) and that were either A to G or
T to C changes. In all 102 isolates, we found only two isolates that had groups of A to G or T to C mutations that
were significantly clustered: DM113 and Derby (permutation test of clustering: P < 0.0001 in both cases).
In the DM113 isolate, which has the greatest number of
singletons of all 102 isolates, all 20 mutations (11 of the
20 mutations were non-synonymous) were from A to G in
the positive sense replication intermediate, and all were
clustered within a 146 bp region of the gene encoding the
PP3 protein (Figure 1). Other than these changes, DM113
is identical in sequence to other closely related isolates. As
before, we tested whether sites preferred by ADAR were
more likely to have mutated, by reconstructing the ancestral sequence using an outgroup, and compared the frequency of changes at preferred sites with those at unpreferred sites. We found that there was a highly significant excess of mutations occurring at preferred sites
(Fisher's Exact Test P = 0.001, see Table 1).
In the Derby isolate, all 5 mutations (4 of the 5 mutations
were non-synonymous, with one introducing a stopcodon) were from A to G in the positive sense replicate
intermediate, and all were clustered within a 65 bp region

sequences are shown in positive sense (the mRNA sequence rather than the genome sequence). (a) Isolates A3 and A3 E55

polymorphic for five A to G changes in the PP3 protein (these ambiguous bases are indicated by the wobble code R). In all the

of the gene encoding the PP3 protein (Figure 1). However,
this is a special case, as these five changes are polymorphic
at these sites (both As and Gs are present in the RNA
extracted from a single infected fly line), suggesting that
only a proportion of the viral genomes have been edited.
Again, we tested whether sites preferred by ADAR were
more likely to have mutated, but found they were not
(Table 1). Other than these two examples, there was a

third case of suspected hypermutation. In the U125 isolate, which had the third highest number of singletons in
our dataset, five of the 13 mutations were from A to G,
and these five mutations were clustered within a 24 bp
region of the gene encoding the PP3 protein (Figure 1).
However, overall the 13 mutations were not significantly
clustered (permutation test: P = 0.28), nor were the five A

to G changes significantly more likely to occur at preferred
sites (Table 1).
This approach of direct sequencing viral genes will only
detect mutated viral RNA when the majority of viral copies in the fly have been mutated. However, it is unlikely,
especially if these mutation are deleterious to the virus,
that all viral copies will be simultaneously mutated. We
therefore looked for mutated viral RNA present at a lower
frequency. To do this we amplified the PP3 gene by PCR
and cloned the PCR product from a subset of our wild
viral isolates. However, we found no further evidence of
hypermutation: across 86 clones (~600 bp in length and
derived from 10 different viral strains) we found 14 mutations, all of which occurred only once. Of these, 6 of the
14 changes were in the direction of ADAR-editing (A to G
and U to C), and 3 of these 6 changes were at sites preferred by ADAR (i.e. A not preceded by G, and Ts not followed by C).
Editing rates in sigma infected flies
In the final experiment, we examine whether the sigma
virus is capable of suppressing ADAR-activity as a defence
against the potentially harmful hypermutations. The
rationale for this experiment is based on the observation
that the sigma virus has the unusual property of paralyzing or killing flies when exposed to high concentrations of
carbon dioxide. Intriguingly, flies that lack a functioning
copy of the ADAR gene display a similar symptom, where
they are paralysed following anoxia. If ADAR editing has
an antiviral function i.e. introducing mutations that are
deleterious to the virus, then we might expect the sigma
virus to suppress ADAR activity. The suppression of ADAR
activity might explain why sigma-infected flies become
paralysed when exposed to carbon dioxide. To test this,
we examined whether the rate at which fly mRNAs are
edited by ADAR is altered by sigma virus infection. ADAR
edits the nAChR transcript at 10 sites and the Rdl transcript
at 6 sites [23]. However, there was no difference in the
editing rates of either of these two genes in sigma-infected
and -uninfected flies (Figure 2; nAChR: F1,116 = 0.386, P =
0.535; Rdl: F1,55 = 0.001, P = 0.969).

Discussion
We have provided the first evidence from outside mammals to suggest that viruses can be hypermutated by host
ADARs. The clustering of A to G changes observed in the
laboratory viral lines are typical of mutations that occur as
a result of RNA editing by ADARs, in that they are changes
from A to G and occur at sites that don't have a 5' G [4,5].
Definitive evidence that ADAR is causing this hypermutation will require experimental verification, for example by
showing that hypermutation does not occur in flies lacking ADAR.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/75

The frequency of edited viral RNA is low, and we only
found evidence for editing in two of 104 viral isolates.
While this may reflect a low rate of editing, it is also possible that the edited RNA is rapidly degraded or hypermutations are deleterious and do not persist within the viral
population. This is supported by the observation that the
hypermutation events we observed caused numerous
changes to the encoded protein sequence. If this is the
case, RNA editing may be common but difficult to
observe. This may explain why both of the editing events
that we observed are in the PP3 protein that has no known
function, while, no editing-events were found in the other
genes--where hypermutations would likely be removed
due to their harmful effects. Alternatively, this region of
the genome may be edited more often because it is prone
to form dsRNA. We may also lack statistical power to
detect some editing events, as two other sequences
showed patterns consistent with editing but were not significant.
Evidence of RNA-editing by mammalian ADARs has been
found in a number of different viruses, including the
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; Rhabdoviridae), which is
a close relative of the sigma virus [14]--both are negativesense RNA virus. An intriguing question is how ADARs are
able to edit the genome of a negative-sense RNA virus?
Our data suggests that in both of the hypermutation
events that we found, it is the replication intermediate
that was edited rather than the negative sense viral
genome (the A to G changes all occur on the positive
strand). This suggests that dsRNA is either formed
between the viral genome and the complimentary replication intermediate, or is the result of secondary structure in
the replication intermediate. However, it was recently
shown that RNA viruses with negative sense genomes produce little or no dsRNA in vivo [24], so it is unclear how
ADAR is able to edit VSV and the sigma virus. Editing not
only requires the formation of dsRNA, but also requires
ADAR and the virus to be present in the same cellular
compartment. It is not known whether Drosophila ADAR
is active in the cytoplasm, but our results suggest that it
probably is, or the sigma virus enters the nucleus. One
additional factor that may expose the sigma virus to editing by ADAR is that, like other Rhabdoviruses, it is known
to infect the nervous system, where ADARs are known to
be active [25].
Intriguingly, ADAR mutants have very similar phenotypes
to sigma-infected flies, experiencing nervous-tremors similar to the tremors and paralysis experienced by sigmainfected flies after exposure to CO2. However, we found
no evidence that viral infection alters the rate at which
host mRNAs are edited, so it is unclear whether these two
phenotypes are linked.

So why are viruses edited? In hepatitis delta virus, RNA
editing is an essential process in the life-cycle of the virus;
HDV hijacks ADARs, which edit a single site in the virus,
switching production of a protein involved in virus replication to a protein involved in virion assembly [26]. However, this does not explain the function of the ADARinduced hyper-editing found in other viruses, which show
evidence of RNA-editing, but do not require editing to
switch from one stage of their life-cycle to another. For
these viruses, one possibility is that they get caught up
with ADARs inadvertently, and the editing of viral
genomes has no biological role.
Alternatively, editing events caused by ADARs might be
part of an antiviral defence. Under this scenario, one possibility is that mutations introduced into viral genomes by
ADARs could impact the efficiency of the viral multiplication process by altering either the stability of dsRNA
formed during viral replication, or the sequence of viral
mRNAs, so they no longer encode functional viral proteins [27]. There is also evidence in the polyoma virus that
editing prevents viruses moving freely between host cells
[20].
The second possibility is that the inosines introduced into
viral RNA may act as a tag, marking the virus for subsequent degradation [22,28], although there is evidence that
this is not always the case [29]. In support of this idea, an
RNAse called Tudor-SN--a component of the RNAi silencing complex (RISC)--specifically degrades ADAR-edited
RNA in Drosophila [22,28,30]. This raises the possibility of
a link between RNAi, an important antiviral defence in
flies, and ADAR editing. As evidence for this, a previous
study has shown that many small-interfering (si)RNAs
produced by the RNAi pathway have evidence of ADARediting [12]. However, another study has shown that
edited RNA may sometimes be stable and retained in the
nucleus [31], and so whether viruses are hyperedited by
ADARs and fed into the RNAi pathway remains a contentious issue [32]. But evidence that ADAR can induce
hypermutations in the sigma virus, as reported in this
paper, demonstrates the importance of investigating the
involvement of ADARs in anti-viral defences in both
insect and mammalian models.

A3E55; AM691026). These viral lines are a single wild collected isolate which was split between two separate fly
lines and maintained at 20 degree Celsius for between 10
and 20 years. We then sequenced 5108 bp of the genome
from 102 wild viral isolates collected from 8 populations
in Europe and 2 populations in North America (L. Wilfert,
unpublished). For details of sequencing methods see [33].
We examined sequences with greater than 5 singletons by
eye for evidence of ADAR editing. Three sequences with
suggestive evidence of hypermutation were found (Genbank accession numbers: DM113; GQ451694, U125;
GQ451695 and Derby; GQ451693. We went on to test
this statistically using a permutation test to investigate
whether A to G, or T to C, mutations are clustered together
in a sequence. First, we calculated the mean distance
(number of nucleotides) between all the mutations in the
sequence. We then permuted the order of the nucleotides
and recalculated this statistic 10,000 times to generate a
null distribution. The proportion of the permuted statistics that are less than the observed statistic was used as a
P-value.
To detect mutated viral RNA present at low frequency in
the sample, we amplified a region of the PP3 gene using
the high fidelity polymerase (AccuPrime Pfx DNA
Polymerase, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), cloned the PCR
product using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Paisley,
UK) and sequenced individual clones. Next, we tested
whether viral infection alters the rate at which Drosophila
mRNAs are edited. We extracted RNA from 10 day old flies
that were either infected with the sigma virus (viral isolate
AP30 [33]) or uninfected (but were otherwise genetically
identical) [33]. cDNA was synthesised with MMLV
Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). Editing
rates for nAChR and Rdl were measured examining the
chromatograms following Sanger sequencing using ABI
BigDye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA 94404).
