Abstract
Background: The genetic diversity of Anaplasma platys (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) strains is
currently poorly defined. The present study was designed to characterize A. patys strains in dogs
from Palermo, Sicily, Italy, using a combination of PCR and sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA, heat
shock operon groESL and citrate synthase (gltA) genes.
Results: Blood was collected from 344 dogs (111 pet dogs, 122 pound dogs and 111 hunting dogs)
during 2003–2005 in the Province of Palermo, Sicily, Italy. The prevalence of A. platys in dogs in
Sicily, as demonstrated by PCR and sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA, groESL and gltA genes, was
4%. None of the samples were positive for A. marginale, A. centrale, A. ovis and A. phagocytophilum
DNA. Three different gltA genotypes of A. platys were identified in dogs from Sicily. Two of the gltA
sequences of Sicilian A. platys strains were different from sequences reported previously. However,
one of the gltA, 16S rDNA and groESL sequences were identical to the sequence of A. platys strains
from other regions of the world characterized previously.
Conclusion: At least three different strains of A. platys were identified in dogs from Sicily by PCR
and sequence analyses of the 16S rDNA, groESL and gltA genes. The results reported herein
suggested that genetic diversity of A. platys strains may be similar to A. ovis, but lower than the
diversity reported for A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum. This lower genetic diversity may have
resulted from restricted movement of infected hosts compared to A. marginale-infected cattle and/
or the limited host range of A. ovis and A. platys as compared with A. phagocytophilum. These results
expand our knowledge about A. platys and encourage further research for analysis of the genetic
variation of A. platys strains worldwide.

Background
The genus Anaplasma (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae)
contains obligate intracellular organisms found exclu-

sively within membrane-bound inclusions or vacuoles in
the cytoplasm of both vertebrate and invertebrate host
cells [1,2]. This genus includes pathogens of ruminants, A.

marginale, A. centrale, A. bovis (formerly Ehrlichia bovis),
and A. ovis. Also included in this genus is A. phagocytophilum (previously recognized as E. equi, E. phagocytophila and the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE)
agent), which infects a wide range of hosts including
humans and wild and domesticated animals, and A. platys
(formerly E. platys) which is infective for dogs.
In dogs, A. platys develops within platelets and is the etiologic agent of canine infectious cyclic thrombocytopenia,
but infected dogs are usually asymptomatic [3]. Canine
infections of A. platys have been reported throughout the
world, including the United Sates [3-5], Spain [6,7],
France [8], Greece [9], Italy [10], Taiwan [11], China [12],
Thailand [13], Japan [14-16], Venezuela [13,17,18], and
Australia [19,20]. However, A. platys infection is difficult
to detect in vivo because the bacteremias are usually low
[21-23]. Furthermore, serologic tests may be inaccurate
because they are cross-reactive with other Anaplasma
[8,21,24]. Recently, a PCR assay was optimized to allow
for accurate identification of A. platys infection in dogs
[20]. The PCR test, confirmed by sequence analysis of
amplicons, is considered to be the most reliable diagnostic test for A. platys to date.
Despite the worldwide distribution of A. platys, limited
information is available on the genetic diversity of A.
platys strains [13,18,25]. Herein, we characterized strains
of A. platys from dogs in Palermo, Sicily, Italy, using a
combination of PCR and sequence analysis of 16S rDNA,
heat shock operon groESL and the citrate synthase (gltA)
genes.

Methods
Blood samples
Blood was collected from 344 dogs (111 pet dogs, 122
pound dogs and 111 hunting dogs) during 2003–2005 in
the Province of Palermo, Sicily, Italy, for these studies.
Blood was collected into sterile tubes with anticoagulant
(EDTA), held at 4°C until arrival at the laboratory and
then stored at -20°C for DNA extraction.
DNA extraction, PCR and sequence analysis
DNA was extracted from blood and tick samples using the
GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The A. marginale/A. centrale/
A. ovis and A. phagocytophilum msp4 genes were amplified
by PCR as reported previously [26,27]. The Anaplasma
spp. 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 16SANA-F (5'-CAG AGT TTG ATC CTG GCT
CAG AAC G-3') and 16SANA-R (5'-GAG TTT GCC GGG
ACT TCT TCT GTA-3') as described previously [28,29].
The A. platys-specific 16S rDNA, groESL and gltA PCRs
were done as reported by Martin et al. [20] and Inokuma
et al. [25], respectively. PCR reactions contained 2 μl (0.1–

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/2/24

10 ng) DNA and 10 pmol of each primer in a 50-μl volume (1.5 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM dNTP, 1X AMV/Tfl 5X reaction buffer, 5u Tfl DNA polymerase) employing the Access
RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Reactions
were performed in an automated DNA thermal cycler
(Eppendorf Mastercycler® personal, Westbury, NY, USA or
Techne model TC-512, Cambridge, England, UK) for 35
cycles. Control reactions were done using the same procedures and reagents described above but without DNA
added to the PCR reaction to rule out PCR contaminations. Carrying-over was ruled out due to the low number
of PCR positive samples and the differences in the amplicon sequences. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1%
agarose gels to check the size of amplified fragments by
comparison to a DNA molecular weight marker (1 Kb Plus
DNA Ladder, Promega).
Amplified 16S rDNA, groESL and gltA fragments were
resin purified (Wizard, Promega) and cloned into pGEMT vector (Promega) for sequencing both strands by double-stranded dye-termination cycle sequencing (Core
Sequencing Facility, Department of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology, Noble Research Center, Oklahoma
State University). At least two independent clones were
sequenced. Multiple sequence alignment was performed
using the program AlignX (Vector NTI Suite V 5.5, InforMax, North Bethesda, MD, USA) with an engine based on
the Clustal W algorithm [30]. BLAST [31] was used to
search the NCBI databases to identify previously reported
sequences with identity to those obtained in the study
described herein.
Sequence accession numbers
The GenBank accession numbers for gltA sequences of A.
platys strains are [GenBank: DQ525686–DQ525688].

Results and discussion
Prevalence of A. platys in dogs from Sicily
The observed prevalence of Anaplasma spp. was analyzed
by PCR and sequence analysis of 16S rDNA amplicons. Of
the 344 dogs analyzed, 14 (4%) were positive for Anaplasma spp. DNA (Table 1). Sequence analysis of 16S
rDNA amplicons resulted in 100% identity to previously
reported A. platys sequences. None of the samples were
positive for A. marginale, A. centrale, A. ovis and A. phagocytophilum DNA.

Previous 16S rDNA PCR-based A. platys studies in dogs
reported observed prevalences of 33% (9/27, North Carolina, USA [5]), 32% (64/200, Okinawa, Japan [15]), 45%
(10/22, Central Australia [20]) and 16% (7/43, Lara, Venezuela [18]). The analysis reported herein included a
greater number of samples but the observed prevalence of
A. platys in dogs was lower than in previous studies. These
results suggested that A. platys infection in dogs in Sicily

may be very low. However, differences in the sensitivity of
the PCR due to the size of the amplicon and primer
sequences may affect the results of prevalence studies
reported by different groups.

although 16S rDNA, groESL and gltA sequences may be
useful for phylogenetic studies of Anaplasma spp. [25],
they were not informative for phylogenetic studies of A.
platys strains.

Molecular characterization of A. platys strains from Sicily
The 14 positive dog samples were characterized with A.
platys-specific 16S rDNA, groESL and gltA PCR and
sequence analysis. All dogs had 16S rDNA and groESL
sequences identical to [GenBank: AY530806] and [GenBank: AY848753] A. platys Spanish and Italian strain
sequences reported previously, respectively. These results
agree with previous reports in which little genetic diversity
was observed between 16S rDNA and groESL sequences of
A. platys strains [16,18,20].

The genetic diversity of A. marginale, A. phagocytophilum
and A. ovis strains have been documented using different
genetic markers [27,29,32,33]. The results reported herein
suggested that the genetic variation in A. platys may be
similar to A. ovis but less than that observed in A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum. This low genetic variation may
have resulted from restricted movement of infected hosts
compared to A. marginale-infected cattle and/or the limited host range of A. ovis and A. platys as compared with A.
phagocytophilum [33].

The sequence of A. platys gltA resulted in 3 different genotypes (Table 2). The sequences of A. platys from samples
Miky, Dog 4 and Dog 9 were present in 9/14, 3/14 and 2/
14 of the positive dog samples, respectively. A single
nucleotide change in Dog 9 sequence resulted in an
amino acid change (Table 2). Although the information
about A. platys sequences is limited, these results suggest
that gltA sequences may be more diverse than 16S rDNA
and groESL sequences.

The tick vectors for the transmission of A. platys have not
been extensively characterized. Rhipicephalus sanguineus
[10,34], Dermacentor auratus [35] and Hyalomma truncatum [18] have been suggested as possible vectors of A.
platys. However, experimental transmission of A. platys
with these tick species has not been demonstrated [36].
Nevertheless, ticks of the genera Rhipicephalus, Dermacentor and Hyalomma are present in Sicily and could act as
vectors of A. platys in this region [37].

The result of gltA sequence analysis suggested that at least
three different genotypes of A. platys infect dogs in Sicily.
Two of the gltA sequences of Sicilian A. platys strains (Dog
4 and Dog 9) were different from sequences reported previously (Table 2). However, the gltA sequence of Miky
strain was identical to the sequence of the Sommieres
French strain. Huang et al. [18] suggested that A. platys
strains are not geographically segregated. Although limited by the number of sequences available, the results of
our study suggested that gltA may provide some phylogeographic information about A. platys strains. Nevertheless,

Conclusion
Low observed prevalence (4%) of A. platys was detected in
dogs from Sicily by PCR and sequence analysis of 16S
rDNA, groESL and gltA genes. Three different gltA genotypes of A. platys were identified in these dogs. The results
reported herein suggested that genetic diversity of A. platys
strains may be similar to A. ovis but lower than that for A.
marginale and A. phagocytophilum. The lower genetic diversity of A. platys may have resulted from restricted movement of infected hosts as compared to A. marginaleinfected cattle and/or the limited host range of A. ovis and
