Abstract
Background: micF RNA, a small regulatory RNA found in bacteria, post-transcriptionally regulates
expression of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) by interaction with the ompF mRNA 5'UTR.
Phylogenetic data can be useful for RNA/RNA duplex structure analyses and aid in elucidation of
mechanism of regulation. However micF and associated genes, ompF and ompC are difficult to
annotate because of either similarities or divergences in nucleotide sequence. We report by using
sequences that represent "gene signatures" as probes, e.g., mRNA 5'UTR sequences, closely
related genes can be accurately located in genomic sequences.
Results: Alignment and search methods using NCBI BLAST programs have been used to identify
micF, ompF and ompC in Yersinia pestis and Yersinia enterocolitica. By alignment with DNA sequences
from other bacterial species, 5' start sites of genes and upstream transcriptional regulatory sites in
promoter regions were predicted. Annotated genes from Yersinia species provide phylogenetic
information on the micF regulatory system. High sequence conservation in binding sites of
transcriptional regulatory factors are found in the promoter region upstream of micF and
conservation in blocks of sequences as well as marked sequence variation is seen in segments of
the micF RNA gene. Unexpected large differences in rates of evolution were found between the
interacting RNA transcripts, micF RNA and the 5' UTR of the ompF mRNA. micF RNA/ompF mRNA
5' UTR duplex structures were modeled by the mfold program. Functional domains such as RNA/
RNA interacting sites appear to display a minimum of evolutionary drift in sequence with the
exception of a significant change in Y. enterocolitica micF RNA.
Conclusions: Newly annotated Yersinia micF and ompF genes and the resultant RNA/RNA duplex
structures add strong phylogenetic support for a generalized duplex model. The alignment and
search approach using 5' UTR signatures may be a model to help define other genes and their start
sites when annotated genes are available in well-defined reference organisms.

Background
The rapid determination of microbial genomic sequences
poses a challenge in gene annotation and assignment of

transcriptional start sites. Without experimental data,
incorrect annotations can be made as well as erroneous
determination of gene start sites. This is especially true for

genes that are evolutionarily and structurally related such
as the bacterial porin genes, ompF and ompC. For example,
a BLAST search using the Salmonella typhimurium ompF
gene sequence identifies Enterobacter cloacae ompC as well
as Salmonella minnesota ompC (unpublished). However,
when gene promoter sites, transcript 5'UTR sequences, or
signatures within genes from reference organisms are
used, an accurate assignment of a gene as well as a prediction of its start site can be made by a comparative
approach. These regions serve specific functions in molecular processes, e.g., several 5' UTRs of mRNA transcripts
are mRNA stability determinants [1,2]. Thus they can display sequence and/or secondary structure signatures and
these defined segments can be more useful than using
entire gene sequences for annotations. The use of
domains for annotation of genomic sequences originated
with analyses of protein coding regions [3–5]. In this
paper, alignment and comparative methods have been
used to annotate the small regulatory RNA gene micF and
its associated genes, ompF and ompC in Yersinia species.
Transcriptional start sites have also been assigned based
on alignment data.
The micF transcript is a small non-protein coding RNA
found in E. coli and related bacteria [6,7]. micF regulates
outer membrane protein F (OmpF) synthesis in response
to stress and other environmental signals [8] and these
signals induce the transcription of micF RNA. micF RNA
functions by interacting with the target ompF mRNA 5'
UTR to form an RNA/RNA duplex. The micF transcript
inhibits ompF expression post-transcriptionally by blocking translation and inducing degradation of the ompF
message [9].
With the use of newly determined Yersinia genomic
sequences
[10]
(see

Accession
no.
gnl|SANGER_34054|, Yersinia enterocolitica 8081), micF
RNA/ompF mRNA 5' UTR duplex models have been
deduced. These structures show a strong evolutionary conservation of the RNA/RNA duplex structure, but also
reveal additional interacting sites. The new Yersinia
sequences further support a phylogenetic conservation of
the micF regulatory system in γ-proteobacteria.

Results and Discussion
Gene Annotation
BLAST searches were performed to find micF and its target
ompF, as well as ompC in genomic sequences available on
the GenBank site of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Due to similarities in sequence
in protein coding regions of ompF and ompC, a BLAST
search using known gene sequences can provide erroneous results. However the mRNA 5' UTR transcript
sequences of ompF and ompC differ significantly and the
ompF 5' UTR sequence provides a basis for detection in a
BLAST search since several ompF 5' UTR sequence signatures are conserved and are ompF specific. Additional
markers used were genomic positions relative to highly
conserved genes such as asnS, the asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, which is preceded by ompF in the E. coli and S.
typhimurium chromosomes by about 600 bp. The ompC
and micF genes are upstream of each other in Gram-negative genomic sequences and in E. coli, they are separated
by a 253 bp regulatory promoter region [8]. Since these
genes share a transcriptional regulatory region, rearrangements, where these genes may be repositioned and separated on the chromosome, are probably unlikely.

Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica ompF mRNA 5' UTR sequences
were found by a BLAST search on GenBank using the Serratia marcescens ompF 5' UTR sequence as a probe. Position
1600321 of the Y. pestis genomic sequence and position
1759190 of the Y. enterocolitica sequence were pinpointed
as the 5' starts.
The S. marcescens ompC 5' UTR/regulatory promoter region/
micF segment provided a suitable sequence for determination of genomic positions of Yersinia ompC and micF, however these have been partially annotated in Y. pestis
(Accession # NC_003143.1). Assignment of 5' start sites
of Yersinia species micF, ompF and ompC was based on
sequence alignment using 5' start sites of other organisms
(see below). Annotation of ompF, ompC and micF genes in
Yersinia species is shown in Table 1.

Alignment of ompF mRNA 5' UTRs from 6 bacterial species
Figure 1
Alignment of ompF mRNA 5' UTRs from 6 bacterial species. Putative 5' end nucleotides (position one) of Yersinia species ompF
transcripts were determined by sequence alignment. Sequences were aligned by the ClustalV method using the DNASTAR Inc
MegAlign program. OpnP is the ompF homolog in X. nematophilus. Color bar indicates degree of similarity at each position with
red signifying 100% identity, orange signifying that 5 out of 6 nucleotides are the same, green shows partial similarity whereas
purples depict poor identity. The consensus sequence is shown under the color bar.

Sequence Alignments and comparisons
ompF and ompC 5' UTR
Figure 1 shows the alignment of DNA sequences representing six ompF 5' UTRs. opnP is the ompF homolog in
Xenorhabdus nematophilus, an organism which resides
in a specific ecological nitch but is phylogenetically
related to the γ-proteobacteria [11–13]. Assignment of 5'
start sites of Yersinia species mRNA transcripts was based
on alignment and similarity with the other ompF 5' UTR
sequences.

Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica ompF 5' UTRs differ only by a
T to A base substitution at position 39 (Figure 1). In addition, the nucleotide sequence identity between Yersinia
species and other γ-proteobacteria is high (Figure 2). Consistent with bacterial evolutionary relatedness, the percent
identity of Yersinia species ompF 5' UTRs appear to be closest to Serratia marcescens (Figure 2).
High sequence conservation implies a functional role for
conserved elements. The 5' UTRs of bacterial mRNAs are
important determinants of mRNA stability and/or translational regulation [1,2,14–16]. In keeping with a functional role, the segment of ompF 5' UTR that forms the

major RNA/RNA duplex pairing with micF (i.e., positions
96–125), is highly conserved amongst the species analyzed, including Yersinia species (Figure 1). In addition,
this region contains the ribosome binding site [Shine-Dalgarno (S-D) sequence] and initiation codon ATG start site
and these also contribute to evolutionary sequence stability. An additional signature shared by the Yersinia species
is an A-rich region that precedes the S-D domain. The 5'
end region of ompF mRNA 5' UTR contains a long stemloop and evolutionary changes in this segment consist primarily of compensatory base-pair changes that maintain a
stem-loop structure [17]. However the 5'-end region of
the ompF UTR also has a high sequence conservation, with
the exception of a 12 nt deletion that the Yersinia species
share with S. marcescens (Figure 1).
Putative 5' start sites of Yersinia species ompC transcripts
were also determined by sequence alignment (Figure 3).
High similarity in the promoter regions also support start
site predictions of both micF and ompC transcripts (see
below).ompC mRNA 5' UTR sequences show more
sequence divergence than ompF 5' UTR sequences, e.g., the
percent identity between Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica
sequences is 81% and divergence between the two Yersinia

ompC 5' UTR segments is greater than that of the closely
related organisms, E. coli and S. typhimurium (Figure 4). As
with ompF mRNA 5' UTR, the S-D sequence GAGG and AT
rich region between the S-D site and ATG start codon are
highly conserved (Figure 3). With exception of the ribosome binding site, a functional role for the ompC mRNA 5'
UTR is not known.

base pairing occurs with sequences in the highly variable
middle section of micF RNA (positions 33–70, Figure 5).
For example, nucleotide sequences within this region
allow for formation of intra- and inter- molecular basepairings in RNA/RNA interactions in Yersinia species.
These base pairings are not seen in other species (see
below).

micF sequence comparisons
5' ends of Yersinia micF genes were deduced by alignment
with micF sequences from related species (Figure 5). The
ρ-independent termination motif of the micF transcript
delineates the 3' end. A comparison of micF sequences
from 6 bacterial species reveals that the initial 13 nt from
the 5' end are invariant; in addition, the first 32 nt are
highly conserved (Figure 5). This 32 nt region represents
the segment of the micF transcript that forms the major
duplex interaction with the target ompF mRNA in E. coli
[2]. Similar to target sequences in ompF mRNA 5' UTR
(positions 96–125, see Figure 1), this binding role may
account for the high evolutionary sequence conservation
of the 32 nt segment at the 5' end of micF.

Yersinia micF sequences have diverged more than the S.
marcescens micF sequence, e.g., the percent identity
between S. marcescens micF and E. coli micF is 65.5%; it is
52.9% between Y. pestis and E. coli micF genes (Figure 6).
Evolutionary instability in sequence is consistent with the
high genetic flux found in the Y. pestis genome [10]. Interestingly, the Y. enterocolitica micF sequence has diverged
somewhat more (Figure 6). But of interest also is the large
difference in sequence between the two Yersinia micF RNA
genes, i.e., 15 base substitutions and a 6 base insertion at
positions 18–23 in Y. enterocolitica (Figure 5). These
sequence differences actually reinforce the Yersinia RNA/
RNA duplex model (see below). The reason for the
evolutionary drift in Y. enterocolitica micF sequence is not
known.

The variability of micF nucleotide sequence in the last two
thirds of the gene may be due to several factors. For example, the ρ-independent termination stem-loop transcript
structure may function on secondary and not primary
structural features, and can tolerate compensatory basepair changes in the stem as well as changes in loop
sequences. In addition, variation in the type of RNA/RNA

The micF sequence identities differ markedly from those
of ompF 5' UTR (compare Figure 2 and Figure 6). These
differences are also evident in the phylogenetic trees (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Noteworthy are the differences
between Yersinia species sequence s, i.e., there are 21 base
changes between the two Yersinia species micF sequences

between Yersinia ompF 5' UTR sequences (Figure 1). Thus
this reveals a very unequal rate of nucleotide sequence
change between Yersinia micF and ompF 5' UTR sequences.
On the other hand there appears to be a uniform rate of

nucleotide change between S. marcescens and E. coli
sequences in ompF mRNA 5' UTR (67.2 % identity) and
micF (65.5 % identity) (compare Figures 2 and 6).

Upstream regulatory region
In E. coli, the 253 nt upstream sequence between micF and
ompC contains promoters as well as binding sites for several transcription factors [8]. micF is part of a global regulatory network that responds to environmental stress
conditions in E. coli [18,9,19]. It is thus not surprising that
this region has a complex set of transcriptional regulatory
sites. These sites comprise approximately one third of the
upstream sequence between micF and ompC in E. coli.

A comparison of nucleotide sequences from related bacteria shows that these binding sites are highly conserved
evolutionarily and that Yersinia species sequences have
not appreciably diverged, either between themselves or in
comparison to those in other bacterial sequences (Figure
9). OmpR, the transcription factor that activates transcription of both micF and ompC in response to osmolarity
increase binds at three sites in E. coli, C1, C2, and C3
[18,20]. These sites are highly conserved between all bacterial species where 5–6 positions out of 10 are totally
conserved (Figure 9). A high degree of sequence conservation is also found for integration host factor (IHF), a protein that participates in bending of DNA [21].
SoxS, MarA, and Rob are part of the family of AraC/XylS
transcription regulators and share the same DNA binding
sites in E. coli [22]. These factors regulate E. coli micF tran-

scription in response to different environmental factors.
The SoxS/MarA/Rob binding site upstream of micF,
termed the SoxS/MarA/Rob box, is not well conserved
phylogenetically, however the major polymerase interaction site, the A box, is almost totally conserved in bacterial
sequences analyzed, including those of Yersinia (Figure 9).
MarA and Rob transcription regulators in E. coli have two
helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs that interact with A and B
box sequences [23,24], and one HTH element of Rob has
been shown to insert itself in the micF promoter DNA at
the major groove of the A box region [24].
An alignment of six different gene promoters in E. coli that
contain a SoxS/MarA/Rob box shows that they conform to
a conserved 18–19 bp distance between the SoxS/MarA/
Rob binding sequences and the -10 promoter [25,26].
This also holds true for micF promoters in related bacteria,
including promoters of the Yersinia species, but the exception is the S. marcescens sequence, which has a 12 bp insertion between the -10 and -35 micF promoter sites and
adjacent to the B box of (Figure 9). Thus this partially
conserved 18–19 bp distance may not be as relevant as
previously thought. Although sites of interaction of RNA
polymerase (RNAP) with these transcription regulators
have not been determined [27,28], the 12 bp pair
insertion does pose the question of how putative S.

marcescens SoxS/MarA/Rob factors interact with RNAP to
activate transcription in S. marcescens.
The leucine response protein (Lrp), a global regulator of
transcription [29] represses micF [30]. In E. coli the primary Lrp binding site [30] overlaps much of the SoxS/
MarA/Rob site upstream of micF (Figure 9). The highest
sequence conservation is primarily in the SoxS/MarA/
Rob-related A box sequence GCAC. Since the Lrp site overlaps the SoxS/marA/Rob site, a high overall sequence conservation may be expected, but the degree of conservation
is much less than that for example, of the OmpR sites. The
putative Lrp binding site sequences between Yersinia species are nearly identical but differ almost uniformly from
those of the other bacteria.
Some regions not pinpointed as sites for factor binding
have diverged appreciably, e.g., the region between integration host factor (IHF) and Lrp binding sites (positions
195 to 228), but the region between C1 and IHF binding
sites (100 to 182) has some partially conserved sequences
(Figure 9). These may serve as sites for other transcription
factors where binding sequences have not been defined.
For example in E. coli, H-NS binds in an as yet unspecified
site in the ompC/micF regulatory region [31]. In addition,
nfxB encodes a transcriptional repressor and may act on
micF as an nfxB mutant was found to reduce OmpF levels
post-transcriptionally in E. coli [32]. nfxB has also been
found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [33]; thus a putative micF
regulatory site for nfxB may also be evolutionarily conserved. Evolutionary conservation of transcription factor
binding sites as seen in Figure 9 implies that these transcriptional regulators function in bacterial species being
analyzed here. Some factors, such as OmpR have been
found in related organisms [34].
Although transcription factor binding sites display a high
uniformity in sequence, a sequence comparison of the
entire upstream regulatory region shows that the Yersinia
species have diverged significantly between each other
and more than the E. coli/S. typhimurium/K. pneumoniae
grouping has diverged within itself (data not shown). It
remains to be seen if entire genome comparisons of Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica will show this evolutionary trend,
which has also been seen in micF, or if this divergence pattern is an anomaly.
OmpF mRNA 5'UTR/micF RNA duplex structures
Secondary structure probing by enzymatic and chemical
techniques helped defined a micF RNA/ompF mRNA 5'
UTR interaction [2,8]. In E. coli, micF RNA binds the ompF
mRNA 5' UTR to form an RNA/RNA duplex that contains
imperfect base-pairing [2,35]. In the present work, Yersinia ompF mRNA 5' UTR/ micF RNA duplex structure modeling was performed with the mfold program [36,37]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/3/13

(Figure 10 and Figure 11). Sequences between Yersinia
micF RNA species differ in 21 out of 91 positions (shown
in blue in Figure 11). Interestingly, these changes result in
only minor variations in Yersinia RNA/RNA duplex structural models. For example, base substitutions at positions
39–42, and 77 in Y. enterocolitica are in looped regions
(compare Figures 10 and 11). The 6 base insertion at positions 18–23 in Y. enterocolitica micF RNA, as well as the
base substitution at position 61 expand duplex pairings in
stems 1 and 3. Base changes at positions 38, 44, 46, 53,
and 69 constitute compensatory changes that maintain
base pairs in stems. Thus the large divergence in micF RNA
sequence between Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica does not
significantly alter the RNA/RNA duplex structure. This
strengthens the rationale for the duplex model.
Figure 12 shows a diagrammatic representation of the
Yersinia RNA/RNA duplex models along with models of E.
coli and S. marcescens duplexes. Both Yersinia structures
conform to a generalized ompF mRNA 5'UTR /micF RNA
structural model, but the Yersinia species form additional
intra- and inter- molecular base pairings, i.e., stem loop a
and stem 2 (Figure 12). Compensatory base pair changes
in stem loop a add strong phylogenetic support for the
presence of this structure in Yersinia species. The question
is, does this stem loop have a function in regulation of
ompF expression in Yersinia? Mfold modeling does not
predict formation of thermodynamically stable stem loop
a or stem 2 structures in E. coli or S. marcescens RNA/RNA
duplexes. However structure probe data of the E. coli micF
RNA/ompF mRNA 5' UTR duplex do not necessarily
support or preclude Watson-Crick pairings that can form
stem 2 in E. coli [2].
In E. coli, stem 1 of the RNA/RNA duplex is formed from
regions that are largely single-stranded in free (uncomplexed) RNAs [2,39], but a minor stem loop in ompF 5'
UTR and a thermodynamically weak stem loop in micF
RNA unfold to form the RNA/RNA interaction [8]. In the
E. coli RNA/RNA duplex, structure probe data show that
intra-molecular stem loop c in ompF 5' UTR and stem loop
b in micF RNA (the ρ-independent terminator), which are
present in uncomplexed RNAs, are unaltered in the RNA/
RNA duplex [2]. Mfold analyses of Yersinia species
duplexes also predict that these stem loops are maintained in RNA/RNA duplex structures. Perhaps evolutionary pressure to maintain the stability of these intramolecular stem loops is greater than a progression to
unfolding that may create more sites for RNA/RNA interactions. However we cannot rule out a functional role for
stem loops b and c in ompF mRNA inactivation, e.g., protein factor binding during micF RNA-induced ompF mRNA
destabilization.

Conclusions and Future Prospects
With rapid sequencing of bacterial genomes, it is a challenge to annotate the thousands of genes and especially
determine gene start sites (5' ends of RNA transcripts). In
this work, BLAST searches using segments of genes, such
as the ompF 5' UTR sequence resulted in the annotation of
Yersinia genes. This was achieved in part because the ompF
mRNA 5' UTR sequence has functional domains which
are involved in translational regulation. Use of signatures
to annotate genomic sequences has been widely reported
before. This includes PRINTS/BLOCKS/Pfam data bases
[3–5,40] and CDART [41]. In these examples, protein coding regions are employed to search for sequences that display similar domains.
In this work, sequence alignment programs have provided
putative start sites as well as definition of transcription
factor binding sites in the upstream regulatory region of
micF. Additionally, with these sequences, new Yersinia
ompF mRNA 5' UTR/micF RNA duplex structures have
been proposed. These add strong phylogenetic support for
previously determined duplex structures.
The approach used here to locate genes may also be useful
in additional annotations. For example, a sequence has
been located in Desufovibrio desulfuricans that displays
74% similarity to a putative mRNA 5' UTR sequence from
K. pneumoniae (unpublished data). This is of particular of
interest since Desufovibrio desulfuricans is phylogenetically
in the δ-subdivision of the proteobacteria [42]; E. coli, K.
pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and Yersinia species, are part of
the γ-proteobacteria. micF genes in distantly related bacteria have not yet been found due to evolutionary divergence of micF, ompC mRNA 5' UTR, and the upstream
sequences, in spite of the presence of conserved elements
such as the invariant 13 nt at the 5' end of micF and
conserved putative transcription factor binding sites in
currently analyzed organisms. However a combination of
sequence and secondary structure motifs [43,44] will be
utilized in future studies for additional searches for micF.

Methods
BLAST searches were performed to find micF and target
ompF genes as well as ompC in genomic sequences available on GenBank sites of the National Center for
Biotechnology
Information
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Genomic data were scanned by
alignment methods in GenBank. To search for particular
genes, a highly conserved gene was first located and then
alignment methods were used to locate the desire gene in
adjacent sequences. mRNA signatures such as AUG start,
the Shine-Dalgarno (S-D) ribosome binding site and
other signatures were also used as a guide. Where there
were questions of sequence errors in genes analyzed, these
sequences were not used. BLAST searches for sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/3/13

homologous to micF and ompF also included sequences in
Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pasteurella
multocida, Desulfovibrio desulfricans, and Schwanella oneidensis as well as those from Yersinia species.
BLAST sequence similarity search programs also provided
in GenBank were used [45]. Microbial genome searches
with BLASTN 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 using expect values of 10–
1000 with the Advanced BLAST program was used to find
micF and associated genes sequences in Yersinia species:
ref #|NC_003143.1| Yersinia pestis strain CO92, complete
genome, and gnl|SANGER_34054| Yersinia enterocolitica
8081. Yersinia species ompF and ompC genes were located
by BLAST searches with ompF or ompC mRNA 5' UTR
sequences.
The 5' start sites of micF and, ompF and ompC 5'UTRs, were
predicted by nucleotide sequence alignment and similarity. MegAlign alignment programs were from DNASTAR,
Inc. http://www.dnastar.com/. Parameters used were
either that of J. Hein with gap penalty 11, gap length, 3;
ClustalV, with gap penalty 10, gap length 10; or ClustalW
with gap penalty 15, gap length, 6.66. Percent identities,
consensus (majority) sequences, and phylogenetic trees
were also based on programs from DNASTAR, Inc. Alignment methods chosen were for the most part based on
results with well established identities in previously
determined sequences. When an alignment showed obvious discrepancies, such a lack of alignment of stretches of
near perfect identity, it was discarded.
Standard default parameters, with the exception of assignment of the number of alternate structures to 10 were use
to fold RNAs into duplex structures with the Zuker/Turner
mfold program, version 3.1. The program is available at
internet address: http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/
