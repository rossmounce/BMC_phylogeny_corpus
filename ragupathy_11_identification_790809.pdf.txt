Abstract
Background: The HIV epidemic in Cameroon is characterized by a high degree of viral genetic diversity with
circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) being predominant. The goal of our study was to determine recent trends in
virus evolution and emergence of drug resistance in blood donors and HIV positive patients.
Methodology: Blood specimens of 73 individuals were collected from three cities and a few villages in Cameroon
and viruses were isolated by co-cultivation with PBMCs. Nested PCR was performed for gag p17 (670 bp) pol (840
bp) and Env gp41 (461 bp) genes. Sequences were phylogenetically analyzed using a reference set of sequences
from the Los Alamos database.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences revealed that 65% (n = 48) of strains were CRF02_AG,
4% (n = 3) subtype F2, 1% each belonged to CRF06 (n = 1), CRF11 (n = 1), subtype G (n = 1), subtype D (n = 1),
CRF22_01A1 (n = 1), and 26% (n = 18) were Unique Recombinant Forms (URFs). Most URFs contained CRF02_AG
in one or two HIV gene fragments analyzed. Furthermore, pol sequences of 61 viruses revealed drug resistance in
55.5% of patients on therapy and 44% of drug naïve individuals in the RT and protease regions. Overall URFs that
had a primary HIV subtype designation in the pol region showed higher HIV-1 p24 levels than other recombinant
forms in cell culture based replication kinetics studies.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that although CRF02_AG continues to be the predominant strain in Cameroon,
phylogenetically the HIV epidemic is continuing to evolve as multiple recombinants of CRF02_AG and URFs were
identified in the individuals studied. CRF02_AG recombinants that contained the pol region of a primary subtype
showed higher replicative advantage than other variants. Identification of drug resistant strains in drug-naïve
patients suggests that these viruses are being transmitted in the population studied. Our findings support the
need for continued molecular surveillance in this region of West Central Africa and investigating impact of variants
on diagnostics, viral load and drug resistance assays on an ongoing basis.

Introduction
HIV/AIDS was first identified in Cameroon during 1985
[1] and the epidemic has continued to increase with the
identification of multiple, divergent HIV subtypes and
circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) [2]. According to a
recent epidemiological surveillance report, 10,625 new
infections were diagnosed in Cameroon during 2007 in

comparison with 8,596 new infections during 2006 [3].
Furthermore, about 5.1% (ages 15-49) of adults are living
with HIV/AIDS; among them, 60% (ages 15-49) were
women. The majority of HIV infections in Cameroon are
due to heterosexual transmission and high rates (40-50%)
of infection have been observed among risk groups such
as commercial sex workers and long distance truck drivers (UNAIDS/WHO) [4]. Antiretroviral therapy (ART)
was initiated in Cameroon during 2001 and later decentralized to district level hospitals by the WHO 3by5
initiative (treating 3 million by 2005). In a study from

Yaounde, Cameroon it was reported that 2.6% protease
drug resistance and 9.3% major reverse transcriptase
drug resistance were detected among patients who never
received therapy, a finding that has implications for the
efficacy of first line therapies [5]. Further in a study conducted at Doula, Cameroon [6] out of 819 patients who
received first line ART, 36% had virological failure after 6
months or more. About 80% of drug resistance was
detected for Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
(NRTI) class, followed by the non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTI) (76%) and Protease
Inhibitor (PI) class (19%) drugs.
HIV infection in Cameroon is characterized by highly
diversified strains including Circulatory Recombinant
Forms (CRFs), Group O and N [7] which pose a challenge
for diagnosis, vaccines and treatment [8]. Recently a new
HIV strain, group P of gorilla origin, was identified in a
Cameroonian woman [9] and shown to be distinct from
other HIV groups O and N identified earlier in Cameroon
[10,11]. Although new strains have been shown to emerge
in Cameroon, studies that analyzed three immunodominant regions gag/pol/env have documented that 60-70% of
infections continue to be CRF02_AG [12,13]. The current
HIV molecular epidemic in Cameroon is predominantly
based on CRF02_AG (65-75%), pure subtypes A1, A2, C,
F2, G and H(1-5%), 6 different CRFs (-01, -11, -13, -18,
-25, -37), divergent forms group O (2.2-3.8%) and HIV-2
(0.4-1.2%) [13-15]. Several previous reports on molecular
epidemiology in Cameroon were from urban area using
phylogenetic analysis of only gag and env gene sequences.
In the first study it was reported that CRF02_AG
accounted for 60%, followed by URFs(26%), 12 pure subtypes and CRFs [16] and in another study CRF02_AG
accounted for 58.2% of infections followed by 14.8% of
URFs, 0.2 - 6.1% of subtypes, A, B, C, D, F2, G and CRFs
01, 06, 09, 11, 13, 22, and 37 [12]. Both studies confirmed
CRF02_AG is a dominant strain in urban Cameroon. However rural Cameroon comprises the majority of the country’s population and in certain rural areas HIV prevalence
has been found to be double the national rate (8-10%) [17].
In recent studies from rural Cameroon, CRF02_AG was
shown to be a dominant strain 66.5% whether analyzed
from a single pol fragment [14] or individual fragments of
gag (65%), pol (75%) and env (55%) [13] followed by a second dominant strain CRF22_01_A1 in 5-10% of infections
[14,18]. CRF22_01_A1 had been detected earlier [19] as a
URF and later by full genome sequencing in two studies
[14,18] and was found to be 2nd dominant circulating strain
in Cameroon. It is interesting to note that along with these
subtypes and CRFs about 10-20% of strains were unique
recombinant forms (URFs) that were likely generated by
recombination of existing strains [12,19].
CRF02_AG recombinant viruses have become well
established in the Cameroonian population possibly due to

Page 2 of 11

a founder effect from parent strains subtype A [20.21] and
G [22] and/or a higher replicative advantage of
CRF02_AG over other co-circulating recombinants
[23,24]. A prospective study confirmed that CRF02_AG is
the predominant strain in blood donors in Yaoundé,
Cameroon [12]; however, other CRFs and Unique Recombinant Forms (URFs) have also been detected [25-27]. The
ongoing evolution of HIV and emergence of new recombinant forms are a major concern for the global AIDS pandemic. Several factors may contribute to the emergence of
recombinant viruses or URFs but most importantly,
recombination provides a mechanism to increase viral
sequence diversity rapidly, unlike the slow accumulation
of mutations that occurs through replication errors [28].
For recombination to occur between distinct HIV-1
strains, a cell needs to be dually infected with different
viruses the progeny virions that result possess RNA genomes from each virus, permitting strand-switching to
occur during the next round of reverse transcription.
Therefore, recombination requires co-infection of viral
strains in an individual. This dual infection may occur during the primary infection period, before the immune
response is fully developed, or it may occur as a superinfection with a new viral strain after the initial strain has
established a chronic infection. Super infection with a different strain is thought to be the most predominant contributor to viral recombination [29]. The possibility for
superinfection among high risk individuals has been
reported in Cameroon [30]. Both superinfection and
recombination have the potential to complicate efforts to
develop vaccines, and reinfection with a drug-resistant
virus could jeopardize available treatment options. To date
49 CRFs have been identified [31] and recombination
between the URFs and existing CRFs results in Second
Generation Recombinants (SGRs) [27] which would
further complicate the phylogenetic nature of the epidemic. In the present study we have analyzed recent
trends in the genetic evolution of the HIV epidemic in different regions of Cameroon and demonstrated the
ongoing emergence of new recombinants and prevalence
of multi-drug resistant viruses in the population.

Materials and methods
Study Population

Blood samples were received from blood banks and
clinics in 3 cities in Cameroon (Figure 1), samples from
blood banks were from Bamenda (ARC) (n = 28) in the
North West and other clinical sites at Buea (BDHS)
(n = 21), Limbe (LPH) (n = 16) in the South West and
a few villages in Cameroon (NYU) (n = 8). Demographic
information was collected in the performa. The specimens used for this study had all been previously
obtained for another purpose and were de-identified for
the analysis.

Virus culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
sequencing

Seventy three viruses were cultured in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of buffy coat received from
HIV seronegative blood donors from the NIH Blood
bank. Viruses were propagated as per our standard protocol of the laboratory published earlier [32]. Cell free
viruses were harvested and stored frozen at -80°C. Viral
RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN viral RNA kit (Cat:
52906) and complementary DNA was synthesized in a 20
ul reaction using Invitrogen Superscript III RT kit (Cat:
18080-051) and custom primers BOA (HXB2 coordinate
5242-5267) and DOAR (HXB2 coordinate 9513-9538).
Briefly, reaction conditions were 65°C for 5 min with
template and 10 mM dNTP mix, followed by 50°C for 50
min with RT reagents and two fragments of cDNA was
synthesized from the template RNA. Nested PCR reaction was performed for Gp41 (461 bp), p17 (670 bp) of
all 73 isolates and 61 viruses for pol (840 bp) region. The
reaction mixture consisted of PCR pre mix buffer from
Invitrogen (Cat No: M7505), 25 pmole of each primer
(Table 1) for both the rounds of PCR and reaction conditions were one cycle at 94°C for 3 min, 30 cycles at 94°C
for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1.2 min and final extension 72°C for 7 minutes. Amplified products were
detected by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. All PCR

A phylogenetic analysis was performed using partial
genome segments and analyzed by the MEGA 4.1 software package. Pair wise evolutionary distances were generated using Kimura’s two-parameter method; major
gaps in the alignment were masked out prior to analysis
and phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighborjoining [33,34]. Nucleotide sequences were aligned by
the Clustal W program [34] using partial curated alignments of 42 CRFs and inter-subtypes as reference
sequences. All reference subtypes and CRFs were
obtained from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database
and initially used to construct the trees [31]. Some references have been omitted during the analysis for clarity
and all positions with alignment gaps were removed.
Confidence values for individual branches have been
determined using bootstrap analysis.
The 840 bp (Hxb2 position 2390-3229) genomic region
studied for reverse transcriptase (codon 1-227) and protease drug (codon 46-99) resistance may not represent
the entire profile of drug associated mutations. However
this paper analyzed 80% of the protease and the entire
RT region of the pol gene. HIV drug resistance was analyzed using the Stanford University HIValg Program
[compares three programs HIVdb, Rega Institute and
Agence Nationale de Recherches surle SIDA (ANRS)].
The 61 pol sequences were analyzed for mutations associated with NRTI, NNRTI and PI drug resistance using
the HIValg program available on the Stanford University
HIV Drug Resistance Database website [35]. Mutations
in the sequences were defined as differences from the
consensus B reference sequence and were further characterized as NRTI-resistance mutations, NNRTI-resistance
mutations, PI-resistance mutations or other mutations
which consists primarily of accessory mutations (those
which alone or have little or no effect on drug susceptibility) and polymorphisms. For each sequence analyzed,
the drug resistance interpretation was compared for consistency and only consistent mutations in 2 or more algorithms predicted are presented in the Table. Since data
generated from 61 viruses was too large for inclusion in
the manuscript it has been summarized in the form of a
Table (data sheets may be provided for individual
requests).

Results
The demographics in terms of gender, age and route of
HIV acquisition are outlined below. Seventy three samples obtained from 59 females and 14 males were analyzed in this study. The ages of men and women were
35-55 and 16-59 years respectively. Heterosexual contact
accounted for 94% of infections and 6% reported having
no extramarital relations but had received blood transfusions. Out of 61 patients, 18 (29%, 11 female and 7
male) reported having received therapy (3by5 initiated
by WHO); the other 43 (71%, 5 men and 38 women)
were drug naïve.
Out of 73 samples, PCR was successful for 72 samples
in the p17 (gag), 70 samples in the gp41 (env) regions
and 61 samples in the pol region. Genotyping analysis of
the p17 region revealed that 75% were CRF0_2AG, 7%
were CRF11 and F2, 3% were subtype CRF22_01A1, D, B
and 1% was CRF06, and subtype G (Table 2). The pol
region analysis revealed that 74% were CRF02_AG, 5%
were subtype F2 and CRF22_01A1, 3% were CRF01_AE
and subtype D, 2% were comprised of CRF06, CRF 11,
CRF09, B and G (Table 2). Gp41 genotyping revealed
that 79% were CRF02_AG, 6% were subtype F2, 7% were
CRF22_01A1, 3% were CRF11 and G, 1% was subtype D
and CRF06 (Table 2). Based on sequence analysis of 2 or
3 distinct genes, HIV genotypes circulating in Cameroon
were found to be CRF02_AG (65%), URFs (26%) subtype
F2 (4%) and 1% each of CRF06, CRF11, CRF22_01A1,
subtype G and D (Figure 2). Phylogenetic analyses are
assessed from enclosed additional file 1.
The replication kinetics of CRF02_AGs and URF
strains were classified as fast, slow and no growth viruses.
For the analysis, viruses that produced concentrations of
HIV p24 >10-100 ng/ml at Day 7 were classified as fast
growing viruses and those <10 or 0 ng/ml as slow or non
replicating viruses. In the present study, p24 antigen
levels in CRF02_AG cultures were 50.5 ng/ml at day 7
(Figure 3A) while levels in CRF02_AG containing URFs

were 16.1 ng/ml (Figure 3B). Slow viruses had 3.6 to 0.1
ng/ml of p24 levels in the culture supernatants at day 7.
Further more, slow growing viruses showed an increase
of 1-2 ng of p24 at day 14 and 21, however some viruses
showed no p24 increases during the culture period and
hence were classified as non replicating viruses.
Of 61 viruses sequenced for HIV-1 drug resistance
mutations, 18 had received antiretroviral therapy and 43
were drug naïve. Among the group that received antiretroviral therapy (ART), 8 viruses (44%) showed no drugspecific mutations, while 10 (55.5%) had drug-specific
mutations in the RT and protease regions. Two ART
patients harbored viruses with multi drug resistance for
NNRTI/NRTI and 3 had low to high level mutations for
NRTI/NNRTI. Interestingly 44% (19/43) of drug naïve
patients were found to have one or more drug specific
mutations in the RT and protease regions. However,
only 42% (8/19) of mutations were those that confer
drug resistance (Table 3), and 26% (11/43) of mutations
were polymorphisms in the RT region. The impact of
these polymorphisms for effective therapy of these
patients is unknown.
Among persons who showed primary drug resistance
mutations, one patient (06CMLPH20SL) had multi drug
resistance mutations for NNRTI/NRTI; two other
patients (BDSH 35 and BDSH 52) had protease drug
point mutations of I54L, which confers low level resistance for several protease drugs except tipranavir, and
I50S, which is a polymorphism (Table 3). Furthermore,
these individuals had NNRTI associated mutations in
H221K/V106L/D67H and V75L, however these mutations were classified as polymorphisms. Three other
patient viruses had point mutations for EFV/DLV/3TC/
NVP or Etravirine and two patients had the K219R/Q
Zidovudine (AZT) point mutation (Table 3).
Since significant percentages (26%) of viral strains were
found to be URFs, we analyzed the three genomic regions
of HIV independently to determine phylogenetic

sequences phylogenetically clustered with high bootstrap
97-99% values (Table 4). One pair of sequences
(06CMLPH19CM; 06CMLPH11TT) clustered 99% in the
p17/pol/gp41. However, a second pair (06CMBDHS024;
06CMBDHS019) clustered only in the p17 and gp41
region. The pol gene of 06CMBDHS024 clustered
with the pol gene of 06CMLPH17HT. Since both patients
had distinct genotypes, the resulting genotype of
06CMBDHS024 was a URF (Table 4). Such associations
were not observed with partial sequences from other
patients analyzed.

Discussion
The present study reveals the ongoing genetic diversity
of HIV-1 in three cities Bamenda in the Northwest and
Buea and Limbe in the Southern provinces of Cameroon
based on genotyping of samples collected from 20062008. Even though these samples may not reflect the
entire Cameroon population this study highlights the
importance and dynamic nature of HIV evolution in
this region. Viral diversity and drug resistance was
observed in samples from both blood banks and other
clinical sites. Subtype determination based on nucleotide
sequence analysis of three distinct regions of the HIV-1

genome provides more detailed information of the phylogenetics of the HIV-1 epidemic in a specific region. In
this study 66% of patients and blood donors studied harbored the CRF02_AG strain. Similar studies conducted
on samples collected during the early part of the past
decade showed that CRF02_AG was dominant in blood
donors in Cameroon along with other HIV subtypes and
CRFs [36]. It has been reported that CRF02_AG
appeared to be stable in blood donors in Yaounde over
the period of 1996-2004 [12] and this strain may have a
higher fitness than other strains circulating in the country with high viral load and higher infectivity over other
forms of HIV [37]. It is interesting to note that 26% of
strains were URFs of CRF02_AG with existing subtypes

F, B, D, G and CRF 11, CRF 06. Circulation of such
HIV variants may be a factor in the evolution of the
phylogenetic nature of the epidemic in this geographic
region. Further longitudinal studies are needed in these
areas to monitor HIV evolution, virus genetic, diversity
and its immunologic impact. Host genetic factors that
may contribute to the genetic diversity in this region
may also be worthy of investigation and could provide
new insights into HIV evolution. As noted earlier, the
expanding genetic diversity raises public health concerns
including the ability of diagnostic assays to detect these
unique HIV mosaic variants.
In an earlier study [38] it was observed that a small
number of CRFs yielded discordant results with licensed

assays, an observation consistent even with the plasma
samples collected during 2007-2009 (unpublished data)
highlighting the need for continued monitoring of variants and their impact on diagnostic assay sensitivity.
Growth Kinetics

The replication characteristics of the viruses were examined by performing co-cultivation studies with primary
PBMCs. Viruses were classified as fast, slow and non
replicating viruses. The majority of the viruses yielded
high levels of HIV p24 antigen in cell culture, however
some viruses yielded low levels or did not replicate.
Most importantly, in our study we observed high levels
of p24 antigen production with recombinants of
CRF02_AG that contained URFs of the pol region of
CRF01_AE, CRF_ 22 or subtype D when compared with
recombinants that had a primary subtype F2 with
CRF02_AG in the pol region. These findings suggest
that the generation of new recombinants may be accompanied by variations in replication characteristics of the
new strains which in turn may have an impact on virus
transmission in this population.
Drug Resistance

Our next effort was to determine whether the available
therapeutic options could be affected by emerging
recombinant HIV strains. Among the 29% of patients
that received ART, 55.5% had drug specific mutations.
Most patients received NRTI/NNRTI standard combinations for the duration of 1-2 years at the time of sampling and very few received single dose Nevirapine or
AZT to reduce parent-to-child transmission. Four
patients (06CMBDSH05, 06CMARC007, ARC88 and
ARC140) had resistance for all classes of RT antiretroviral therapy (Table 3) and the partial genotype of these
isolates was CRF02_AG that contained URFs. Another
two individuals (06CMLPH20SL and 06CMBDSH019)
were on standard ART regimens available in Cameroon.
Drug resistance profiles of the Cameroonian population
from earlier studies had shown the presence of drug
resistance associated with lamivudine efavirenz, and
nevirapine [39,40]. These drugs are widely used in
Cameroon in either individual formulations or fixeddose combinations. The fixed-dose combination of lamivudine/stavudine/nevirapine is now the most frequently
prescribed drug in Cameroon and other African countries [41]. Since these resistance mutations were
detected among patients with diverse strains we
hypothesize that drug-related selection pressures may
also be a contributing factor for viral evolution.
Other NNRTI single mutations detected among
patients on therapy include G190A, V118I, V179E,
K219Q and H221K and these unusual mutations may
be polymorphisms for the CRF02_AG or CRF02_AG

Page 9 of 11

containing URFs. Follow up studies are needed to provide
more information on the implications of these mutations
for pathogenesis and treatment. However, it has been
reported that G190A mutation alone would decrease the
susceptibility to nevirapine [42] and its presence as polymorphisms would impact prevention measures for
mother-to-child transmission based on the drug.
Interestingly 19/43 (44%) of drug naïve patients had
drug resistance or polymorphisms at drug resistance
sites. These findings suggest that resistant viruses were
being transmitted within the study group. Detailed analysis of resistant codons (Table 3) 8/19 (42%) showed
RTI associated mutations. Among drug naïve patients,
one patient (06CMLPH20SL) had multidrug resistance
for all classes of RTIs and another 6 patients had mutations that confer resistance to RT and protease drugs
(Table 3). Such individuals pose a major concern for
antiretroviral therapies provided by public health prevention programs in the country. These studies also
highlight the importance of drug resistance testing prior
to initiation of therapy.
In the present study two individuals (Table 3) had
point mutations for protease drug who had never
received these drugs. A mutation at I54L reduces the
susceptibility for fosamprenavir (FPV), lopinavir (LPV)
and darunavir (DRV) but not Tipranavir (TPV). These
mutations mostly occur in patients receiving these drugs
but their presence as polymorphisms in patients with
CRF02_AG genotype limits future use of these drugs. In
Cameroon these mutations appear to be prevalent
among drug naïve individuals [43,44]. These observations suggest that they would have been transmitted
with mutations for protease drug or that CRF02_AG
also had natural polymorphism at these positions.
All results were from random sampling at one single
time point. In the future, linked studies will be required
to determine the importance of emerging drug resistance in the regions studied.
Genetic variation and phylogenetic relatedness

The identification of divergent recombinant strains in
three cities in Cameroon is consistent with findings
reported by earlier investigators, we wished to examine
whether specific segments of the HIV genome are phylogenetically associated with high bootstrap values within
the population. Analysis of sequence similarity within the
population in the p17/pol/gp41 region of two pairs of
sequences showed that in each of them p17/pol/gp41
were associated in only 2 of the 3 genomic regions. The
bootstrap values for these associations were 97-100%
similar to values observed in direct transmission cases
such as intravenous drug users [45] or mother to child
transmission [46] In our study we observed high bootstrap values for some viruses suggesting that perhaps

Ragupathy et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:185
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/185

such associations may exist in specific cases. In particular
one isolate (06CMBDHS024) that was primarily subtype
F2 contained a pol segment of CRF02_AG, and when
further analyzed this virus was closely associated in the
pol region with the second isolate (06CMLPH17HT).
These findings suggest epidemiological associations
between them and it should also be noted that these two
isolates were from two different cities. Extensive molecular epidemiological analysis linked with behavioral studies
may provide a new approach for determining the public
health significance of the emergence of new URFs in
regions where multiple strains circulate.
In conclusion, our study suggests that the genetic
diversity of the HIV epidemic in Cameroon is evolving
and periodic monitoring of HIV variants is necessary to
determine the extent of virus evolution in this region.
These studies are important as strains identified first in
Cameroon and West Central Africa including
CRF02_AG and CRF01_AE have eventually been transported and become prevalent in other parts of the world
through globalization. It is also necessary to study
genetic variation and understand its impact on licensed
diagnostic and nucleic acid monitoring tests. Finally, the
identification of drug resistance in drug naïve patients
highlights the need to monitor viral genotype before
treatment and after ART failure. A comprehensive
genetic analysis of, and surveillance for, emerging HIV
variants in major cities and rural areas on a periodic
basis is clearly warranted in these regions of world. The
insights gained from these studies will help us identify
diagnostic, therapy and vaccine strategies associated
with the discoveries of new strains that could successfully bolster the fight ongoing against HIV/AIDS.
