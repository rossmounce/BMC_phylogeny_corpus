Abstract
Background: Small GTPases of the Rho family function as tightly regulated molecular switches that
govern important cellular functions in eukaryotes. Several families of regulatory proteins control their
activation cycle and subcellular localization. Members of the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor
(GDI) family sequester Rho GTPases from the plasma membrane and keep them in an inactive form.
Results: We report on the characterization the RhoGDI homolog of Tuber borchii Vittad., an
ascomycetous ectomycorrhizal fungus. The Tbgdi gene is present in two copies in the T. borchii genome.
The predicted amino acid sequence shows high similarity to other known RhoGDIs. Real time PCR
analyses revealed an increased expression of Tbgdi during the phase preparative to the symbiosis
instauration, in particular after stimulation with root exudates extracts, that correlates with expression of
Tbcdc42. In a translocation assay TbRhoGDI was able to solubilize TbCdc42 from membranes.
Surprisingly, TbRhoGDI appeared not to interact with S. cerevisiae Cdc42, precluding the use of yeast as a
surrogate model for functional studies. To study the role of TbRhoGDI we performed complementation
experiments using a RhoGDI null strain of Dictyostelium discoideum, a model organism where the roles of
Rho signaling pathways are well established. For comparison, complementation with mammalian RhoGDI1
and LyGDI was also studied in the null strain. Although interacting with Rac1 isoforms, TbRhoGDI was
not able to revert the defects of the D. discoideum RhoGDI null strain, but displayed an additional negative
effect on the cAMP-stimulated actin polymerization response.
Conclusion: T. borchii expresses a functional RhoGDI homolog that appears as an important modulator
of cytoskeleton reorganization during polarized apical growth that antecedes symbiosis instauration. The
specificity of TbRhoGDI actions was underscored by its inability to elicit a growth defect in S. cerevisiae or
to compensate the loss of a D. discoideum RhoGDI. Knowledge of the cell signaling at the basis of
cytoskeleton reorganization of ectomycorrhizal fungi is essential for improvements in the production of
mycorrhized plant seedlings used in timberland extension programs and fruit body production.

Background
During the different phases of the life cycle of mycorrhizal
fungi several morphological, genetic and metabolic modifications are induced in both symbiotic partners [1-4]. It
is well known that morphological modifications of some
fungal species are determined by deep cytoskeleton network modifications. The cytoskeleton is involved in cytoplasm distribution and reorganization, contributes to the
cell shape definition and plays a key role in cell motility
and mitosis in several organisms. In filamentous fungi
cytoskeleton reorganization controls the continuous deposition of glycoprotein and lipid material assigned to the
membrane and cell wall synthesis, making polarized apical growth possible [5,6]. Changes in cytoskeleton reorganization have been observed in symbioses between
different fungal species and specific host plant species
(e.g. Suillus bovinus vs. Pinus sylvestris, Ceratobasidium cornigerum vs. Spiranthes sinensis) [7,8].
Little is known regarding these molecular processes in
fungi belonging to the genus Tuber. Investigations carried
out in the last decade have led to the identification of several genes and proteins mainly involved in the hyphal
membrane and cell wall development, such as chitin synthase, protein kinase C, cell cycle regulator p21 and phospholipase A2 [9-12]. Further studies performed on the
interacting in vitro model Tuber borchii-Tilia americana,
where the two partners exchange molecular signals without physical contact, have allowed us to identify genes
involved in polarized apical growth and host tissue infection [1]. However, very limited information is available
on the signaling pathways that regulate cytoskeleton reorganization during the truffle life cycle. In a previous work
we showed that T. borchii Cdc42 is involved in the polarized growth and that it has a fundamental role in the
organization of the actin cytoskeleton [13]. Cdc42,
together with Rac and Rho, belongs to the Rho family of
small GTP binding proteins. Rho GTPases are involved
primarily in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton,
hence in all cell processes linked to morphological modifications, such as cytokinesis, cell motility, vacuole trafficking, secretion and apoptosis in all eukaryotes, and
more recently it has been shown that they are also
upstream of complex signaling pathways that modulate
gene expression and cell growth [14,15].
Rho GTPases function as tightly regulated molecular
switches. The cycling between the GTP-bound (active)
and the GDP bound (inactive) state is regulated by three
classes of proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(GEFs) stimulate the GTP-GDP exchange reaction,
whereas GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate the
intrinsic GTPase activity. GDP-dissociation inhibitors
(GDIs) constitute an additional regulatory element.
RhoGDIs were initially named after their ability to inhibit

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/57

the spontaneous dissociation of bound guanine nucleotide (usually GDP) from their partner GTPases. They
have been regarded mostly as housekeeping regulators
that distribute Rho proteins equally to any membrane.
Recent in vitro studies have revealed how their modularity
allows them to function both in the cytoplasm and at the
membrane interfaces. By interacting with RhoGDI binding proteins, by phosphorylation or upon alterations in
the lipid composition of membranes they can actively
contribute to the delivery of Rho proteins to specific subcellular membranes and signaling pathways [16-18]. Several proteins, named displacement factors, have been
shown to interact with RhoGDIs and modulate their activity in that they have the ability, upon over-expression, to
decrease the amount of soluble Rho-RhoGDI complexes
and to increase the amount of GTP-bound Rho proteins
[16]. Candidate displacement factors are proteins of the
ezrin/radixin/moesin family, the tyrosine kinase Etk and
the p75 neurotropin receptor that have been described to
induce the release of RhoA from RhoGDI [17].
RhoGDI proteins are widespread among eukaryotes. Significant deepening in the functional knowledge of
RhoGDIs has been achieved in mammals and in Dictyostelium discoideum, in many cases through generation of
knockout strains. In mammals the RhoGDI family comprises three members: the ubiquitously expressed archetypal RhoGDIα (or simply RhoGDI) [19]; RhoGDIβ (or
LyGDI), which has hematopoietic tissue-specific expression [20], and RhoGDIγ (or RhoGDI3), which is membrane-anchored through an amphipatic helix [21].
Disruption of GDI1, one of the two RhoGDI homologs of
D. discoideum, has allowed detailed functional analyses at
the cellular level, uncovering a central role in the regulation of Rho signaling and consequently actin reorganization [22,23]. While the role of Rho GTPases in polar
growth in fungi is well established, little is known about
the roles of RhoGDI proteins in this kingdom. In S. cerevisiae the ability of Rdi1, the only RhoGDI homolog, to
remove Cdc42 from the plasma membrane is not essential
for cell growth, but overexpression results in increased
sequestering of Cdc42 in the cytoplasm and growth arrest
[24,25]. Rdi1 is essentially a cytoplasmic protein that
localizes to the plasma membrane at the tips of smallsized buds and the mother-bud neck region [26]. Recent
studies showed that the interaction of Rdi1 with Cdc42
was enhanced at sites of polarized cell growth during the
cell cycle, like incipient bud sites, tips and sides of smalland medium-sized buds, and the mother-bud neck region
[27].
In order to improve the knowledge on the complex
molecular mechanisms responsible for the morphological
changes during Tuber life cycle, we have undertaken the
characterization of the gene encoding a RhoGDI homolog

in Tuber borchii Vittad. The Tbgdi gene is expressed at
higher levels in the presence of the symbiotic host or root
exudates. In yeast two-hybrid and translocation assays
TbRhoGDI was found to interact with TbCdc42. Because
S. cerevisiae was not suitable as a surrogate model for functional studies, the cellular role of TbRhoGDI was
addressed in heterologous complementation experiments
in the model organism D. discoideum where the roles of
Rho signaling pathways are well established [28,29].

Results
Cloning and sequence analysis of Tuber borchii RhoGDI
A previously identified cDNA fragment encoding a
RhoGDI homolog of T. borchii [1] was used as a probe to
screen a cDNA library of T. borchii vegetative mycelium
and 5 positive clones were isolated. The longest clone,
1365 bp in length, was entirely sequenced and shown to
contain an ORF of 609 bp encoding a protein of 202
amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 22,330
Da (Fig. 1). The gene, named Tbgdi, showed the highest
homology with rhogdi of Neosartorya fischeri. A 315 bp
long 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR), and a 3'-UTR of 441
bp were present. In Southern analyses the Tbgdi DNA
probe detected two bands in each EcoRI and ScaI digest,
suggesting that Tbgdi is a two-copy gene (Fig. 2). Digestion with BamHI yielded only one band, but the more
intense signal leads us to conclude that the restriction
fragment contains both the two copies of the Tbgdi gene
and that the two copies lie rather close each other. Alternatively one can assume that BamHI generates two comigrating fragments, each containing a copy of the Tbgdi
gene, but since BamHI cuts rather infrequently in the T.
borchii genome, the first explanation appears more convincing.

The whole Tbgdi genomic sequence was subsequently
obtained using two pairs of primers designed at the 3' and
5' ends of Tbgdi cDNA and genomic DNA from mycelium
as a target. The comparison between the genomic and
cDNA sequences allowed us to identify five introns in the
coding region, of 145, 109, 65, 69 and 57 base pairs,
respectively. In addition a 78 bp long intron was detected
in the 5'-UTR region. All the introns showed 5' and 3' consensus splicing sites typical of filamentous fungi [30] (Fig.
1). Upstream from the ATG start codon we identified an
adenine in -3 position (3 nucleotides before the ATG
codon) in agreement with the consensus Kozak sequence
[31].
The amino acid sequence comparison with diverse
RhoGDI proteins (Fig. 3A) recognized the two functional
domains characteristic of this protein family as revealed
by biochemical and structural studies: a short N-terminal
regulatory domain (residues 5–55) linked by residues
56–64 to a C-terminal domain with β-barrel structure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/57

(residues 65–202) [32-34]. The C-terminal domain has an
immunoglobulin-like fold that contains a hydrophobic
pocket for insertion of the isoprenyl moiety of the Rho
GTPase. The non-polar residues that form this pocket are
conserved in TbRhoGDI (Fig. 3A, open and blue circles),
particularly the "hydrophobic triad" constituted by L77,
F102 and W194 of bovine RhoGDI, corresponding to L72,
F98 and W193 of TbRhoGDI (Fig. 3A, blue circles). This
triad is critical for the formation of the binding site for the
distal isoprene unit. Most residues involved in the formation of an acidic patch at the hydrophobic pocket are also
present in TbRhoGDI (Fig. 3A, cyan circles). These residues interact with the polybasic region at the C-terminus
of the Rho GTPases. The deduced amino acid sequence of
TbRhoGDI also shows that most residues involved in
interactions with Rho-GTPases (Fig. 3A, green boxes) are
also conserved in TbRhoGDI.
A phylogenetic tree shows the position of TbRhoGDI in
the context of a broad sample of RhoGDI proteins from
other fungal species and representative members of animal, plant and amoebozoan RhoGDI proteins (Fig. 3B).
From the tree it becomes evident that RhoGDIs from different phyla group in distinct clusters. TbRhoGDI clearly
groups with all other fungal RhoGDIs, and is found in a
cluster with sequences from ascomycetes, clearly separated from the basidiomycetes C. neoformans and U. maydis. Consequently, similarity of TbRhoGDI to fungal
RhoGDIs was high (above 60%; over 45% identity), and
similarity to RhoGDIs from other phyla ranged between
49% and 57% (33–38% identity).
Expression analyses by real time PCR: a comparison
between Tbgdi and Tbcdc42
In order to evaluate Tbgdi expression in the vegetative
mycelium in the absence (Driver) or presence of the symbiotic host (Tester), and in the presence of volatile organic
compounds from root exudates (TSA) we set up a quantitative real time PCR assay. We designed a suitable primer
pair with a high melting temperature encompassing a
splice junction to prevent genomic amplification; hence
non-specific products were not generated. The average Ct
values for Tbgdi were normalized against average Ct values
for the 18S rRNA. The expression differences in the three
tissues were extrapolated using the ΔCT average of the
Driver as a calibrator. In the presence of the plant (Tester),
the fungus expressed a 1.8-fold increased amount of Tbgdi
mRNA while the stimulated samples (TSA) showed an
expression slightly below four-fold that of the control
samples (Driver) (Fig. 4). The differences among the ΔCT
medians of the analyzed samples were statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis test). These expression results were
compared with those previously reported for Tbcdc42
[13], in order to highlight the tight link between the two
proteins. For both genes a higher expression in the pres-

hybrid analysis. When Dictyostelium Rho GTPses were
examined, we observed good interaction with Rac1 isoforms, but not with several other Rho GTPases. We verified the interaction of TbRhoGDI with TbCdc42 using a
translocation assay with recombinant His-tagged
TbRhoGDI (Fig. 5B). This assay tests the ability of a
RhoGDI to solubilize a prenylated Rho GTPase from a
membrane preparation, an activity that is characteristic of
RhoGDIs.
Complementation of a Dictyostelium RhoGDI null strain
with diverse RhoGDIs
The slow growth of T. borchii and the paucity of genetics
tools available make studies at the molecular level very
difficult in this organism. The absence of interaction of
TbRhoGDI with yeast Cdc42 in spite of the overall higher
similarity of TbRhoGDI to other fungal orthologs precluded the use of S. cerevisiae for functional studies. When
overexpressed, the yeast RhoGDI brings about a reduction
in the growth rate, and the same effect has been reported
when mammalian RhoGDI is introduced into yeast [24].
In agreement with the yeast two-hybrid data, we observed
that TbRhoGDI is unable to cause growth inhibition
when expressed in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 6).

ence of the plant and of root exudates was observed,
although the increase of Tbcdc42 in the TSA samples was
more pronounced than that of Tbgdi.
Interaction of TbRhoGDI with Rho GTPases
To date only one Cdc42 homolog has been described in T.
borchii [13]. We therefore investigated whether TbRhoGDI
is able to interact with TbCdc42 using a yeast two-hybrid
approach. For reasons that are explained below, we
extended our analysis to several RhoGTPases of D. discoideum (Rac1a, Rac1b, Rac1c, RacB, RacC, RacE and RacF1)
and human (Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA) as well as to S. cerevisiae
Cdc42 (Fig. 5A and Table 1). We observed a strong interaction of TbRhoGDI with TbCdc42. Additionally,
TbRhoGDI interacted with human Cdc42, but not with
Rac1 or RhoA. Surprisingly, TbRhoGDI did not show
interaction with S. cerevisiae Cdc42 in the yeast two-

In order to gain insight into the role of TbRhoGDI, we
switched to the genetically tractable model organism Dictyostelium discoideum. In this organism deletion of the gene
encoding a typical RhoGDI results in low growth and
accumulation of multinucleate cells as well as in an
altered F-actin polymerization response upon cAMP stimulation. These defects can be reverted by re-expression of
the ablated protein [23]. We used this GDI1- strain to
investigate whether expression of TbRhoGDI could
restore the defects observed in these cells. For comparison,
we included in this study two mammalian RhoGDI proteins, bovine RhoGDI and human LyGDI.
We first investigated the ability of the two mammalian
RhoGDI proteins to interact with D. discoideum RhoGTPases in the two-hybrid assay. In these experiments LyGDI
was found to interact with Rac1a/1b/1c and RacB (Fig. 5A
and Table 1). Our attempts to use bovine RhoGDI as prey
for the two-hybrid analysis were not successful, presumably because this protein interferes with the Rho signaling
system of yeast [24]. We therefore used translocation
assays with purified bacterially expressed His-tagged
RhoGDI and observed clear interaction with Rac1a and
RacB, weak interaction with RacE and no interaction with
RacF2, a pattern similar to that of D. discoideum GDI1 (Fig.
5C and Table 1).
We then introduced GFP fusions of TbRhoGDI, RhoGDI
and LyGDI into the GDI1- strain. Each rescue strain
expressed the corresponding fusion protein of the

expected size. Expression levels were comparable to those
of the strain re-expressing D. discoideum GDI1, which in
turn were similar to the endogenous levels (Fig. 7A).
Expression of bovine RhoGDI (RGFP-RhoGDI strain)
resulted in a complete reversion of the growth and cytokinesis defects characteristic of GDI1- cells (Fig. 7B,C). By
contrast, expression of TbRhoGDI or LyGDI (strains
RGFP-TbGDI and RGFP-LyGDI, respectively) did not
revert the growth defect (Fig. 7B). The cytokinesis defect
was restored only partially after expression of TbRhoGDI,
whereas LyGDI had no effect (Fig. 7C). The failure of
TbRhoGDI and LyGDI to restore the growth and cytokinesis defects cannot be explained by non-uniform expression levels of the fusion proteins in the cell populations
because we observed giant multinucleate cells displaying
higher than average fluorescence levels.
Upon cAMP stimulation fast and highly transient changes
in the F-actin content take place in D. discoideum cells that
correlate with changes in cell behaviour [35]. Five seconds
after stimulation a 1.6-fold increase in the amount of Factin was observed in the wild type strain that decreased
rapidly to basal levels after 20 seconds. A second much
lower peak followed immediately and lasted until approximately 60 seconds. This response is in part dependent on
RhoGDI, because GDI1- cells showed a significantly lower

increase in the first F-actin peak (1.2-fold), whereas the
second peak was not altered (Fig. 8). Again, expression of
bovine RhoGDI, but not of TbRhoGDI or LyGDI resulted
in a reversion of the actin polymerization response. Interestingly, TbRhoGDI had a negative effect in the actin
polymerization response of the GDI- cells, with a reduced
and slightly prolonged first peak and an abolished second
peak (Fig. 8, lower panel).

Discussion
In this study we focused on the role of RhoGDI during the
pre-symbiotic phase and its interaction with the small
GTPase Cdc42. In this phase, with the culture system used
here, the fungal hyphae grow gathering along the roots
and start branching, suggesting that the mycelium is able
to respond to molecular messengers secreted by the plant.
Among the messenger signal molecules, volatile organic
compounds secreted by the host plant roots may play a
fundamental role, as showed by gene expression analyses
performed on TSA samples [1,36]. We hypothesize that
the molecules present in the root exudates activate chemotactic and morphogenetic processes in fungal hyphae. In
analogy to what happens in pathogenic fungi during an
infection event [37-39], communication events with its
host plants can occur also in T. borchii, leading in both
partners to a coordinated program of gene expression,

probably activated by a MAP kinase cascade controlled by
Cdc42. In fact, Cdc42, recently characterized also in T.
borchii [13] has, like other Rho-like proteins, a key role in
signal transduction pathways that regulate gene expression and consequently represents one of the main modulators of cytoskeleton reorganization during polar growth
[40-43].
Gene expression analyses showed that Tbgdi expresses
almost two-fold as much when the host plant is present
and four-fold when root exudates are added to the
medium, and this behavior correlated with that of
Tbcdc42. An increased expression of both genes in the
presence of the host plant and/or of root exudates induces
the fungus to prepare itself to the development of mycorrhizal symbiosis, making it to get physically closer to the
plant roots through the prime of branching events and
polar growth. The similar pattern of expression of both
genes might reflect their strict functional link: the small
GTPase TbCdc42 is modulated by TbRhoGDI, which
would extract TbCdc42 from the cell membranes and
sequester it in the cytoplasm. An increase of mycelium
growing and branching during the pre-symbiosis phase is
supported also by the evidence that several genes differentially expressed in this step, like syntaxin binding protein,
aspartic protease and centractin-like protein [1], are
involved in vescicular transport and cell wall construction, events indispensable for cell growing.
RhoGDI proteins are fairly conserved among eukaryotes.
The high degree of conservation and the numerous crys-

tallographic structures available in the Swiss-Prot database allowed to deduce the virtual three-dimensional
structure of TbRhoGDI and verify the three-dimensional
shape of the predicted domains (data not shown). The
predicted three-dimensional structure revealed the presence of active sites matching those of RhoGDI in other
eukaryotes, mainly fungi. The slight amino acidic differences observed are unlikely to cause any gross functional
changes, but might explain the restricted pattern of interactions with Rho GTPases observed in this study. We
hypothesized that TbRhoGDI may have the same functions that it has in other organisms, more specifically
fungi. To date functional studies are difficult in Tuber cells
due to the slow growth and the absence of tools to generate genetically modified strains. The experience gathered
from previous studies on Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes
such as Suillus bovinus [44,45] and Hebeloma cylindrosporum [46] has only recently been applied to Tuber [47], but
unfortunately this technology is not yet widespread. To
address the role of TbRhoGDI we have made use of genetically tractable model organisms in which Rho signaling is
well studied: D. discoideum [28] and S. cerevisiae [48]. As
revealed in the yeast two-hybrid experiments, it appears
that TbRhoGDI is tailored to interact preferentially with
Cdc42 but displays an exquisite specificity, as it did not
interact with the yeast ortholog, thus precluding the use of
this organism for further studies.
D. discoideum belongs to the amoebozoa and undergoes a
characteristic life cycle that alternates a single cell stage as
free living amoeba with a multicellular stage that ends
with the formation of a fruiting body. The formation of
the multicellular structure requires the establishment of
cell polarity and the migration towards an aggregation
center, a process in which Rho signaling plays a key role
in orchestrating the remodeling of the cytoskeleton [49].
Taking advantage of the genetic tractability of D. discoideum, we performed heterologous complementation
experiments. TbRhoGDI, bovine RhoGDI1 and human
LyGDI were introduced successfully in a D. discoideum
strain lacking GDI1. We observed that only bovine
RhoGDI1, which displays a nearly identical pattern of specificity towards Rho GTPases like the D. discoideum
homolog, was able to fully revert the cytokinesis, growth
and actin polymerization defects of the GDI1- strain.
Interestingly, LyGDI, despite of having a spectrum of
interactions not very divergent from that of RhoGDI1,
failed to compensate the functions of the D. discoideum
GDI1. A possible explanation for this failure is the lower
affinity for binding to Cdc42 and probably other mammalian Rho GTPases reported for LyGDI [50] that might
extend to the Dictyostelium Rho GTPases. In agreement
with the restricted pattern of interaction with the set of
Rho GTPases from D. discoideum, TbRhoGDI was unable

Interaction of RhoGDIs with Rho GTPases
Interaction of RhoGDIs with Rho GTPases. A. Two-hybrid interactions between TbRhoGDI or LyGDI and the indicated Rho GTPases. After cotransformation of the corresponding plasmids into the Y190 yeast strain, colonies were allowed to grow on -Trp/-Leu plates and interactions verified and
in colony-lift β-galactosidase assays. DdRac1b and DdRac1c behaved like DdRac1a (not shown). B. Translocation of TbCdc42 by TbRhoGDI. A membrane
fraction of HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged TbCdc42 was incubated in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 40 μM purified bacterially expressed His-tagged
TbRhoGDI. The membranes were sedimented by centrifugation and aliquots of the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The aliquot of membrane
fraction (M) corresponds to the percentage of the analyzed supernatant (SN). TbCdc42 was detected with an antibody reactive against GFP. In these
experiments His-tagged TbRhoGDI was always recovered in the supernatant. C. Translocation of D. discoideum Rho GTPases by bovine RhoGDI1. Membrane fractions of insect cells infected with baculoviruses encoding the indicated Dictyostelium GST-tagged Rho GTPases were incubated in the absence (-)
or presence (+) of 40 μM purified bacterially expressed His-tagged RhoGDI1. The membranes were processed as in B. GTPases were detected with an
antibody reactive against GST. In these experiments His-tagged RhoGDI1 was always recovered in the supernatant.

to revert any of the phenotypes of the GDI1- strain. Leaving aside the possibility that TbRhoGDI does not display
the sufficient affinity for Dictyostelium Rac1, the missing
interaction with RacB could also contribute to the absent
compensation, as RacB is also required for an efficient
actin polymerization response [51]. Interestingly,
TbRhoGDI had a negative effect on the actin polymerization response, which can mean that still TbRhoGDI is able
to interact with other signaling components apart from
Rho GTPases. This observation is in accord with the recent
recognition of several binding partners that modulate the
activity of RhoGDI, the so-called displacement factors
[16,18], that could be sequestered by TbRhoGDI resulting
in altered signaling to the cytoskeleton.

Conclusion
T. borchii expresses a functional RhoGDI homolog that
appears to be tailored to interact specifically with
TbCdc42. The specificity of TbRhoGDI actions was underscored by its inability to elicit a growth defect in S. cerevisiae or to compensate the loss of a D. discoideum RhoGDI.

Our results represent a starting point to understand, yet in
the pre-infection phase, the mechanisms that lead to the
development of ectomycorrhiza in T. borchii. Further studies will allow better understanding the role of TbRhoGDI
in the organization of the complex network of events
underlying symbiosis instauration. The future availability
of Tuber knock out strains might improve our knowledge
of the cell signaling at the basis of cytoskeleton reorganization of this ectomycorrhizal fungus, which might in
turn lead to improvements in the production of mycorrhized plant seedlings used in timberland extension programs and fruit body production.

Methods
Strains and culture conditions
The T. borchii culture consisted of vegetative mycelia of
strain 10 RA grown on nylon membranes laid on solid
MS/2 medium pH 6.5 with 10 g/l of glucose as a carbon
source [52]. The culture was grown for 30 days at 24°C
under 16-h light provided by cool white fluorescent lamps
(Driver sample). The Tester sample was prepared as fol-

americana, from which they were separated by a nylon
membrane. The TSA (Air Stimulated Tester) samples were
obtained treating T. borchii mycelia with T. americana root.
Purified exudates were used to fill 20-μl capillary tubes
subsequently placed on Driver sample medium for 5 days
in order to allow diffusion of volatile organic compounds
in the culture dish.
Dictyostelium discoideum wild type (AX2) and RhoGDI1
null (GDI1-) mutant strains [23] were grown either in liquid nutrient medium at 21°C with shaking at 160 rpm or
on SM agar plates with Klebsiella aerogenes [53].
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain INVsc1 (MATa, his3Δ1,
leu2 trp1-289 ura3-52/MATα leu2, trp1-289 ura3-52) was
supplied by Invitrogen Life Technology (San Diego, California) and was maintained and cultivated using standard
procedures.
HeLa cells were cultivated in DMEM medium using standard procedures.

DNA and RNA isolation
Genomic DNA was isolated from 1-month-old cultures of
T. borchii mycelia following the protocol described by
Erland et al. [54]. Total RNA was extracted from mycelial
samples using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A
DNase (Ambion, Austin, Texas) digestion step was performed before all subsequent reactions.
Cloning of the Tbgdi gene
A 643 bp long DNA fragment harboring the Tbgdi gene
was obtained as described previously [1]. It was inserted
in pGEM vector II (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) and
transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue. After verification by
sequencing, a specific pair of primers was designed and a
207 bp long PCR product was used as a homologous
probe for the screening of 3 × 105 λ ZAP clones of a T.
borchii mycelium cDNA library [55]. Library screening,
subcloning and routine procedures were performed using
standard protocols [56]. DNA sequences were analyzed by
SeqPup ver 0.9e running on SUN JAVA VM ver 1.4.1_02.
Database searches of the DNA/protein sequences were
performed with the BLAST programs (NCBI).

Complementation of a Dictyostelium RhoGDI1 null mutant with T. borchii and mammalian RhoGDIs
Figure 7
Complementation of a Dictyostelium RhoGDI1 null mutant with T. borchii and mammalian RhoGDIs. GDI1 null cells were transfected with
plasmids that allow expression (indicated by an R, for rescue) of GFP fusions of Dictyostelium RhoGDI1(GDI1), TbRhoGDI, bovine RhoGDI1 and human
RhoGDI2 (LyGDI). The wild-type Dictyostelium strain AX2 was used as reference. A. Total cell homogenates of 4 × 105 cells were resolved in 12% polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blot of the upper panel was incubated with a GFP-specific mAb K3-184-2. The blot of the lower panel
was incubated with Dictyostelium GDI1-specific mAb K8-322-2. All GFP fusions are expressed at levels comparable to those of the endogenous Dictyostelium GDI1. B. Growth of GDI1- and complementation mutants in shaking suspension. GDI1- mutant cells have a reduced growth rate and reach lower cell
densities than the wild type. This defect was restored after expression of bovine RhoGDI1, but not by TbRhoGDI or human LyGDI. Curves are representative of at least three independent determinations, each done in duplicate. C. Distribution of the number of nuclei in GDI1- and complementation mutants.
Cells were allowed to grow on coverslips, then fixed with cold methanol and stained with DAPI. 300 cells of each population were scored. Photographs
show DAPI staining (left panels) and phase contrast (right panels). Arrows point at examples of giant multinucleate cells. Scale bar, 50 μm. In the GDI1mutant, cells with four or more nuclei account for about 10% of the population. This defect was restored completely after expression of bovine RhoGDI1
and partially after expression of TbRhoGDI, whereas human LyGDI had no effect.

Actin polymerization response in Dictyostelium upon cAMP stimulation of aggregation competent cells. The relative F-actin content was determined by TRITC-phalloidin staining of cells fixed at the indicated time points after stimulation
with 1 μM cAMP. Each data point represents the average of at least three independent measurements. For the sake of clarity,
error bars are not shown and the results are presented in two graphs. In GDI1-cells the initial response of actin polymerization
and depolymerization was reduced, and was restored after expression (indicated by an R, for rescue) of bovine RhoGDI1, but
not human LyGDI or TbGDI. Expression of TbRhoGDI resulted in a further decreased first peak and an abolished second peak
of actin polymerization.

Southern analysis
Genomic DNA samples for Southern blot analysis (10 μg
each) were digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI,
ScaI and BamHI that do not cut the probe used, and were
electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel. The DNA samples
were blotted onto positively charged Hybond N+ nylon
membranes (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and hybridized at
65°C over night in phosphate buffer with the 207 bp
Tbgdi fragment, which was labeled with [α-32P]CTP using
the RediPrime labeling kit (Amersham, Buckinghamshire,
UK). The final post-hybridization wash was carried out in
15 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM trisodium citrate (0.1 × SSC) and
0.1% SDS at 65°C.
cDNA synthesis and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR)
One-microgram aliquots of total RNA from Driver, Tester
and TSA mycelial samples were denatured at 70°C for 2
min, and then reverse transcribed in a 10-μl reaction mixture using random hexamers as primers and the MMLV
Power-Script Reverse Transcriptase from Clontech
(Mountain View, California). The cDNA was then diluted
1/30 for the subsequently PCR reaction. 18S rRNA gene
from T. borchii was used as a reference (18S RT F 5'TGGTCCGGTCGGATCTT-3', 18S RT R 5'-CATTACGGCGGTCCTAGAAA-3'). Specific primers for Tbgdi (GDI RT F2
5'-ATCCACCACCGAAGGATACA-3', GDI RT R2 5'-TCTCCAAGAGAGCCACCAGT-3') were designed to amplify
under the same cycling conditions (95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec and 60°C for 30
sec), generating a product of 141 bp comparable to the
real time RT-PCR analyses performed with Tbcdc42 specific primers [13].

The PCR was performed in a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ MultiColor Real Time PCR Detection System (Biorad, Hercules,
California). Each 25-μl reaction consisted of 1 μl diluted
cDNA, 12.5 μl of 2× Quantitect SYBR Green PCR kit and
300 nM of primers. The specificity of the amplification
products was confirmed by examining thermal denaturation plots and by sample separation in a 2% DNA agarose
gel. In the experiments we characterized the performance
of the primers over a range of Tester template concentrations, from 1:5 to 1:500 dilutions of the starting diluted
cDNA. The PCR reaction efficiency was 100.2% for the
inner standard 18S (18S RT F-18S RT R primers) and
94.3% for the GDI RT F2-GDI RT R2 primers. The relative
PCR efficiencies of target and reference were calculated
(Applied Biosystems, user bulletin 2) and were found
comparable for up to 36 PCR cycles. The amount of the
target transcript was related to that of the reference gene
by the ΔΔCt method (ΔCt = average Cttarget-average
CtTb18S) as described by Winer et al. [57]. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to samples obtained from at least four

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/57

independent experiments. Results were considered significant if p values were <0.05.
Yeast two-hybrid assays
Two-hybrid assays were performed using plasmids and
following the protocols of the Matchmaker two-hybrid
system from Clontech (Mountain View, California). A
cDNA fragment encoding Tbgdi was inserted in the plasmid pGADT7, while Tbcdc42 and S. cerevisiae cdc42 cDNAs
were inserted in the plasmid pGBKT7. Tbgdi cDNA was
amplified using the GDI-ATG EcoRI 5'-CGAATTCATGGCTTCACACGCAGATGA-3' and the GDI-STOP BamHI
5'-CGGATCCTTAATCCCAGCTCTTTTTAA-3' primers with
Pfu ultra polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, California)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR
product was cloned into pGADT7 vector previously
digested with EcoRI/BamHI. pAS2-1 vectors harboring D.
discoideum and human Rho GTPases have been described
previously [23]. DNA fragments encoding bovine
RhoGDI and human LyGDI were obtained by PCR using
primers designed to introduce suitable restriction sites for
cloning into the pACT2 vector. Plasmids were introduced
into Y190 yeast cells. Colonies were tested for growth on
-Trp/-Leu/-His/+3AT and in colony-lift β-galactosidase
assays.
Solubilization of membrane-bound recombinant Rho
GTPases with soluble RhoGDI
Production of Dictyostelium GST-tagged Rho GTPases and
of untagged human Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA in insect cells
has been described previously [23,58]. For production of
GFP-tagged TbCdc42 in HeLa cells a plasmid was constructed subcloning Tbcdc42 from pGBKT7 where GFP
cDNA was previously inserted in frame using NcoI and
EcoRI. The fusion was excised with NcoI and BamHI and
ligated blunt end in p3xFLAG-CMVT-14 (Sigma, St. Luis,
MO, USA). HeLa cells were transiently transfected using
Escort IV transfection reagent (Sigma, St. Luis, MO, USA)
and membranes were prepared 48 h later as previously
described [58]. Preparation of membranes containing
recombinant GTPases from baculovirus-infected insect
cells and purification of GST and GST-RhoGDI from E. coli
have been described previously [58]. PCR products encoding bovine RhoGDI or TbRhoGDI were cloned into
expression vector pQE30 or pET28+, respectively. Recombinant His-tagged RhoGDI and TbRhoGDI were
expressed in E. coli M15 and BL21DE3, respectively, and
purified from the soluble fraction of bacterial extracts on
Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Membranes of insect or HeLa cells expressing Rho GTPases (1.0
mg of protein each) were rotated end-over-end for 15 h at
4°C in 200 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM dithiotreitol and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 40 μM His-tagged RhoGDI. The samples
were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and the

supernatants used for Western analysis as described previously [23]. In these experiments His-tagged RhoGDI was
always recovered in the supernatant.
Plasmid construction and Dictyostelium transformation
To express green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the
amino terminus of TbRhoGDI, bovine RhoGDI1 and
human RhoGDI2 (LyGDI), cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR and subcloned in frame at its 5'end to the
coding region of the red shifted S65T mutant of Aequoria
victoria GFP in the transformation vector pDEX-GFP [59].
Plasmids were introduced in Dictyostelium GDI1- cells by
electroporation [60]. After selection for growth in the
presence of G418 (Sigma, St. Luis, MO, USA), GFPexpressing transformants were confirmed by visual
inspection under a fluorescence microscope. A GDI1strain re-expressing D. discoideum RhoGDI1 (GDI1) has
been described previously [23].
Heterologous complementation in yeast
For heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, the yeastexpression plasmid pYES2 (Invitrogen Life Technology, San
Diego, California) containing the URA3 auxotrophic
marker was used to express Tbgdi under the inducible promoter GAL1. Tbgdi was excised from pGADT7-Tbgdi using
EcoRI and XhoI and was directionally inserted into
pYES2. INVsc1 yeast strain cells were grown to OD600 0.8
in YPD medium (Sigma Aldrich, St. Luis, Montana) at
30°C and then transformed with pYES2-Tbgdi by chemical transformation (Sigma Aldrich, St. Luis, Montana)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were selected on glucose – Ura medium plates. For
expression, transformants were grown overnight in minimal medium lacking uracil, containing only raffinose as
carbon source. After 24 h cells were switched to a medium
containing raffinose and galactose in order to induce protein expression from the plasmid.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/57

then fixed in cold methanol (-20°C) and nuclei were
stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
(Sigma, St. Luis, Montana). Cells were visualized with a
Leica DMR fluorescence and images were acquired with a
Leica DC350FX camera (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Chemoattractant-induced F-actin formation in aggregation
competent cells was determined through staining with
TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma, St. Luis, Montana) and
quantitated as described previously [35] using a fluorimeter (Photon Technology Intl., Seefeld, Germany).
