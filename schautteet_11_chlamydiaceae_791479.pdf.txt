Chlamydiaceae infections in pig
Katelijn Schautteet* and Daisy Vanrompay

Abstract
Chlamydiaceae are Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria. They are responsible for a broad range of diseases
in animals and humans. In pigs, Chlamydia suis, Chlamydia abortus, Chlamydia pecorum and Chlamydia psittaci have
been isolated. Chlamydiaceae infections in pigs are associated with different pathologies such as conjunctivitis,
pneumonia, pericarditis, polyarthritis, polyserositis, pseudo-membranous or necrotizing enteritis, periparturient
dysgalactiae syndrome, vaginal discharge, return to oestrus, abortion, mummification, delivery of weak piglets,
increased perinatal and neonatal mortality and inferior semen quality, orchitis, epididymitis and urethritis in boars.
However, Chlamydiaceae are still considered as non-important pathogens because reports of porcine chlamydiosis
are rare. Furthermore, Chlamydiaceae infections are often unnoticed because tests for Chlamydiaceae are not
routinely performed in all veterinary diagnostic laboratories and Chlamydiaceae are often found in association with
other pathogens, which are sometimes more easily to detect. However, recent studies have demonstrated that
Chlamydiaceae infections in breeding sows, boars and piglets occur more often than thought and are economically
important. This paper presents an overview on: the taxonomy of Chlamydiaceae occurring in pigs, diagnostic
considerations, epidemiology and pathology of infections with Chlamydiaceae in pigs, public health significance
and finally on prevention and treatment of Chlamydiaceae infections in pigs.

1. Introduction
Chlamydiaceae are Gram-negative obligate intracellular
bacteria. They are responsible for a broad range of diseases in animals and humans. Chlamydiaceae primary
replicate in mucosal epithelial cells of the conjunctivae,
the respiratory, urogenital and gastrointestinal tract.
They can survive and replicate in monocytes and macrophages and are characterized by distinct extracellular
and intracellular forms. The infective elementary body
(EB) is metabolically inactive. It reorganizes to a reticulate body (RB) after entering the host cell. These RBs
are metabolically active and divide by binary fission
within phagocytotic vesicles. Condensation to EBs and
the subsequent lysis of the host cell completes the chlamydial replications cycle. Several studies, however,
described the occurrence of alternative developmental
stages consisting of abnormal sized, mostly enlarged

RB-like structures called aberrant bodies (ABs) and their
association with persistence of Chlamydiaceae [1].
Chlamydiaceae infections in pigs have been known to
occur since 1955 when Willingan and Beamer [2] first
isolated chlamydia from cases of arthritis and pericarditis in U.S. pigs. Massive outbreaks of chlamydiosis associated with bronchopneumonia or abortion in pigs kept
under intensive animal production systems were
reported in Eastern European countries and Russia
between 1960 and 1970 [3-5]. In 1969, the first pig
chlamydial strains were isolated in Western Europe
from numerous Austrian pigs with polyarthritis, polyserositis, pneumonia, conjunctivitis or enteritis, from sows
that aborted and from pigs with inapparent intestinal
tract infection [6,7]. In the 1980s, chlamydial strains
were isolated from healthy and sick German pigs [8,9].
In the 1990s, chlamydia was consistently isolated from
pig herds in Nebraska and Iowa or detected in conjunctival specimens from pigs affected with conjunctivitis or
keratoconjunctivitis in all phases of production [10].
Many of the nursing and nursery pigs with conjunctivitis
from these and other herds had diarrhoea, and at
necropsy most of the diarrheic pigs also showed pneumonia. Although known pathogens were believed to be
the cause of the diarrhoea and the pneumonia, chlamydia was isolated from or detected in the intestines and
lungs of affected pigs. During the 1990s, chlamydia was
also often isolated and/or detected in German and Swiss
pig herds and infections were associated with return to
oestrus, abortion, enteric disease and asymptomatic
intestinal infections [11-15].
Thus, as reported in the literature, chlamydial disease
in pigs includes conjunctivitis, pneumonia and pseudomembranous or necrotizing enteritis, as demonstrated
by experimental reproduction of infection in gnotobiotic
pigs using clinical isolates [16-18]. In addition, C. suis is
associated with pericarditis, polyarthritis and polyserositis in piglets [2] and numerous reproductive problems
such as vaginal discharge, return to oestrus, abortion,
mummification, delivery of weak piglets, increased perinatal and neonatal mortality [19] as well as orchitis, epididymitis and urethritis in boars [20]. For most of these
disorders, the exact role of Chlamydiaceae still has to
be determined. Eggeman et al. [21] noticed a correlation
between the occurrence of the periparturient dysgalactiae syndrome (PDS) in sows and the number of animals
being seropositive for Chlamydiaceae. However, evidence that C. suis is causing PDS is lacking.
Chlamydiaceae were and still are considered as nonimportant pathogens of pigs because tests for Chlamydiaceae are not normally performed at most veterinary
diagnostic laboratories and Chlamydiaceae are often
found in association with other pathogens.

Chlamydial infections in breeding sows, boars and piglets occur more often than originally thought. Chlamydia abortus, Chlamydia pecorum, Chlamydia psittaci
and Chlamydia suis can infect pigs.

2. Taxonomy of chlamydial species occurring
in pig
In 1999, Everett et al., [22] proposed a reassignment
from the single genus Chlamydia into two genera, Chlamydia and Chlamydophila, based on clustering analyses
of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes (Table 1).
However, comparative genome analysis of strains mentioned in Table 2 is consistent with the conclusion that
host-divergent strains of chlamydia are biologically and
ecologically closely related. The previous taxonomic
separation of the genus based on ribosomal sequences is
neither consistent with the natural history of the organism revealed by genome comparisons, nor widely used
by the chlamydia research community eight years after
its introduction. Consequently, it was proposed to
reunite the Chlamydiaceae into a single genus, Chlamydia [23] (Table 1). Accordingly, the chlamydia nomenclature is used here.
2.1. Chlamydia abortus (ruminant C. psittaci serovar 1)

Chlamydia abortus was formerly classified as ruminant
C. psittaci serotype 1. This species has a distinct serotype
and the ribosomal and outer membrane protein A
(ompA) sequences are nearly 100% conserved. An extra
chromosomal plasmid has not been identified in any of
the C. abortus strains. The ruminant strain B577 (ATCC
VR 656) is regarded as type reference strain.
Chlamydia abortus is one of the main infectious
causes of abortion in sheep, cattle and goats in many
countries around the world [24]. In addition, the pathogen has also been associated with abortion in horses,
rabbits, guinea pigs, mice and pigs. Furthermore, pregnant women working with animals infected with C.
abortus are at risk, as C. abortus is also a zoonotic agent
able to cause abortion in humans [25]. Chlamydia abortus strains in pigs are primarily associated with abortion
and weak neonates. So far, transmission of C. abortus
from pigs to humans has not been reported.
2.2. Chlamydia pecorum

Chlamydia pecorum strains are serologically and pathogenically diverse and have been isolated only from mammals. Two strains, E58 and Koala II, have an extra
chromosomal plasmid, pCp. The type strain for
C. pecorum is E58 (ATCC VR 628).
The presence of C. pecorum has been established in
ruminants [26], pigs and koalas (marsupials) [22].
Chlamydia pecorum has been associated with a wide

range of diseases. In koalas, C. pecorum causes conjunctivitis, reproductive disease, infertility and urinary
tract disease. Additionally, C. pecorum has been associated with urogenital tract infections, inapparent
intestinal infections, abortion, conjunctivitis, mastitis,
encephalomyelitis, enteritis, pneumonia, polyarthritis,
pleuritis, pericarditis in sheep, goats, cattle, horses and
pigs [26-28].
2.3. Chlamydia psittaci

Chlamydia psittaci primarily infects birds, but has
caused sporadic zoonotic infections in humans. The
bacterium is spread between birds mainly by inhalation
of contaminated aerosols of ocular or nasal secretions
and contaminated dust from feathers and faecal material. The transmission can also be vertical through the
egg. Chlamydia psittaci has nine known genotypes (A-F,
E/B, M56 and WC) which are all considered to be transmissible to humans. Several strains have an extra chromosomal plasmid. The type strain for C. psittaci is 6BC
(ATCC VR 125).
In pigs, C. psittaci ompA genotype A has been isolated
from the genital tract of a Swiss breeding sow [29].
Additionally, C. psittaci has been isolated from the
lungs of a Belgian sow [30]. In the latter study, the genotype could not be defined as the nucleotide sequence
of the cloned C. psittaci ompA gene (Genbank Accession No. AY327465) was found to be 99.3, 99.1 and
98.9% identical to that of C. psittaci CP3, 6BC and MN
Zhang, respectively. A significant relationship was found
between C. psittaci infections in pigs and keeping poultry on the farm [21,30].

2.4. Chlamydia suis

Before 1999, Chlamydia suis strains were referred to as
C. trachomatis because of ompA DNA sequence homology [28]. Currently, the only known natural host of
C. suis is the pig. Several strains have an extra chromosomal plasmid, pCs [25]. The type strain of this species,
S45 (ATCC VR 1474) was isolated in Europe in the late
1960s from faeces of an asymptomatic pig in Austria
[6]. This strain is tetracycline sensitive (TcS), as other
chlamydial species. Chlamydia suis strains expressing a
stable tetracycline resistant phenotype associated with
the presence of a resistance gene, tet(C), in the chromosome, have been isolated in farms in Iowa and Nebraska
[31], in Italy [32] and in Belgium [33]. Chlamydia suis
in pigs has been associated with conjunctivitis, rhinitis,
pneumonia, enteritis, PDS, reproductive disorders such
as return to oestrus (early embryonic dead in more than
50% of the sows) and inferior semen quality (decrease of
sperm cell motility and dead of more than 50% of the
sperm cells) and apparently asymptomatic infections
[10,15-18,21,34-36]. A high degree of genetic diversity
was observed in C. suis when compared to other chlamydial species [22,37]. Incongruent reports on the
pathology of Chlamydiaceae in pigs and variations in
virulence support the theory of genetic diversity
[15,21,34,38,39].

3. Diagnostic considerations
Diagnostic laboratories do not routinely test for Chlamydiaceae in pigs. Cell cultures are the most convenient
method for the isolation of Chlamydiaceae. However,
with pig strains, this method has been only partially

successful because it is difficult to grow the bacteria on
the established transformed cell lines (HeLa and
McCoy) for chlamydial culture and techniques had to
be modified. Guseva et al. [40] used pig genital epithelial
cells which were cultured ex vivo for dissecting the hormonal modulation of several aspects of C. trachomatis
pathogenesis and infection. Chlamydia suis (S45) was
used in this in vitro model. Consequently, these pig primary cells could be suitable in theory for chlamydial
diagnosis in pigs. Moreover, they can be frozen at -80°C
in DMEM-F-12 medium with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) for several weeks and they can reform monolayers in 3 to 5 days after thawing. However, continuous
cell lines are still more convenient and less expensive.
Schiller et al. [41] cultivated porcine Chlamydiaceae
under various conditions. The combination of centrifugation assisted cell culture infection and cycloheximide
treatment of cell coverslip cultures provided the highest
inclusion numbers with all chlamydial strains. Interestingly, the use of Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
instead of Eagle’s minimal essential medium significantly
increased C. suis inclusion counts in Vero cells.

However, C. suis and C. pecorum inclusion numbers
were markedly increased in CaCo cells when compared
to Vero cells.
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has
been very popular for chlamydial antigen detection
because it is easy to use. Kits designed to detect C. trachomatis in humans have been used extensively in veterinary medicine because most of them, (especially
the earlier developed kits) detect the chlamydial familyspecific LPS antigen and therefore will detect all chlamydial strains. However, the most important drawback
of these tests are the cost and the lack of sensitivity and
specificity [21,42].
Immunohistochemical staining of histological sections
is often used as more veterinary diagnostic laboratories
are using equipment to automate the staining. A Chlamydiaceae family-specific mouse monoclonal antibody
directed against the chlamydial lipopolysaccharide (LPS;
Clone ACI-P, Progen, Heidelberg, Germany) and a chlamydial genus-specific mouse monoclonal antibody
(IgG1) directed against recombinant C. trachomatis
HSP60 (clone A57-B9, Milan Analytica AG, La Roche,
Switzerland) have been used with detection by the streptavidin-biotin method (Dako ChemMate™ detection kit;
Dako Diagnostics, Heverlee, Belgium) [43]. Unfortunately, aberrant bodies are stained less, especially when
using anti-HSP60 antibodies.
PCR techniques have been developed for use in veterinary medicine. They are replacing isolation for the detection of Chlamydiaceae in animals. If properly designed,
the specificity is excellent and the sensitivity equals or
exceeds well-controlled isolation procedures. For biosafety reasons, the sample can be inactivated prior to
testing. Current PCR tests for detection of Chlamydiaceae species occurring in pigs, target the ompA, the 16S23S rRNA or the incA gene [22,38,44,45]. Targeting the
16S-23S genes increases sensitivity, as multiple copies of
those genes are usually present in the organism. However, cross-reactions with other bacteria can interfere.
The sensitivity and specificity of PCR also varies on sample preparation. Reagents designed to stabilise the DNA
should be considered when a delay in processing the
sample is anticipated. DNA samples can be prepared
using inexpensive reagents or using commercial available
kits. Sensitivity increases by targeting a relatively short
DNA segment, using a nested procedure or using realtime PCR techniques. The nested PCR procedure is very
sensitive. However, extreme care should be taken when
manipulating the reaction in order to decrease the risk of
contamination. The real-time PCR requires a labelled
probe and special equipment, which increases costs. The
sensitivity of this test is approximately the same as the
nested PCR and contamination problems and labour are
reduced as it consists of only one reaction in a closed

Schautteet and Vanrompay Veterinary Research 2011, 42:29
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/29

system, often provided with uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG)
to prevent post PCR carry over.
Some years ago, Sachse et al. [46] designed a microarray
hybridization assay for the identification of chlamydial species using the ArrayTube™ platform (Clondiag Chip
Technologies, Jena, Germany). The test proved suitable for
unambiguous species identification of chlamydial cell cultures and showed potential for direct detection of these
bacteria from clinical tissues. Unfortunately, routine testing for Chlamydiaceae in pigs is not possible because the
price (24 € per sample) is not feasible.
Sequencing of PCR products can allow comparison
between the sequences of reference chlamydial isolates
and this information can be used in phylogenetic analysis for classification and epidemiological purposes. However, sequence analysis of the outer membrane protein
A (ompA) gene is to our opinion not advisable for pig
isolates, because of high sequence homology between
the ompA gene of C. psittaci and C. abortus [47]. Multi
locus sequence typing (MLST) has also been used for
typing chlamydial species which occur in pigs. Multi
locus sequence typing has been described for C. abortus,
C. pecorum and C. psittaci [48,49].

4. Epidemiology of infections with Chlamydiaceae
in pigs
4.1. Serology

The earliest serological data on the occurrence of chlamydial organisms in European pigs originate from
1966. At that time, Wilson and Plummer [50] discovered antibodies against Chlamydiaceae by capillary
agglutination testing in 23% of sera derived from pigs
in Great Britain.
At present, chlamydial infections are endemic in the
Belgian pig population [30] as 240 (96.5%) of 249 examined fattening pig farms were seropositive by use of a
recombinant ELISA detecting Chlamydiaceae familyspecific antibodies. In this ELISA the plate was coated
with the recombinant Major outer membrane protein
(MOMP) of an avian C. psittaci genotype D strain [51].
Recombinant MOMP was prepared in COS-7 cells [52]
instead of E. coli [53], in order to mimic eukaryotic glycosylation of MOMP and avoid E. coli fragments (LPS)
which will be unavoidably present in purified recombinant proteins expressed in prokaryotes. In Germany,
Chlamydiaceae seroprevalence rates in sows and boars
are 33 to 72% and 10 to 47%, respectively [21]. For Switzerland, seroprevalence rates of 62% in sows, 6.9% in
piglets younger than 4 weeks and 48.1% in piglets older
than 4 weeks are reported [54]. These studies used an
LPS-based ELISA described by Wittenbrink et al. [14].
In Italy, 63.5 to 80.3% of the finishing pigs were serologically positive when using a purified elementary bodybased micro-immunofluorescence test (MIF) [55].

Page 5 of 10

Bagdonas et al. [42] found a seroprevalence rate of 7.7%
in Lithuanian pigs when using the complement fixation
test (CFT). However, serological results obtained by
using chlamydial LPS or whole elementary bodies
should be handled with some reservations, as serological
cross-reactions with antibodies against other pathogens
do occur [56-59]. Moreover, the CFT is less sensitive
and less specific than ELISA [60].
Qiu [61] and Zhou and Qiu [62], reported a seroprevalence rate in china of 11% and 80% in piglets and
sows, respectively. However, most recent data originate
from the Guangdong Province in Southern China
revealing a seroprevalence rate of 63.38%, 41.10% and
36.25% in breeding boars, breeding sows and fattening
piglets, respectively, when using a commercially marketed indirect haemaglutination assay (IHA kit; Lanzhou
Veterinary Research Institute, Lanzhou, China) [63]. To
our knowledge, there are no recent serological data on
Chlamydiaceae in pigs from other countries.
4.2. Molecular diagnosis

Serology is useful for monitoring the Chlamydiaceae
status in pigs, at least when using a Chlamydia-specific
target antigen. However, all current serological tests fail
to identify the causative chlamydial species. Thus, more
detailed information on the prevalence of Chlamydiaceae in pigs originates from newly developed speciesspecific molecular diagnostic research.
Recently, species-specific nucleic acid amplification
tests (NAATs) such as real-time PCR and microarray,
detecting the ribosomal intergenic spacer and domain I
of the 23S rRNA gene, have been designed [46,64].
Moreover, Dugan et al. [65] designed a PCR for detecting the tetracycline resistance (TcR) gene, tet(C). These
methods have been recently applied to examine the
occurrence of different chlamydial species in pigs.
Chlamydia psittaci DNA was only sporadically found
in pigs [29,30,33]. Chlamydia pecorum was also less frequently found and has been identified, using ompA gene
sequencing, in 2% of ompA gene-positive boar sperm
samples, in 5% of ompA gene-positive foetuses and in
9% of ompA gene-positive gut tissues [45]. Chlamydia
abortus was identified in the lungs of a Belgian pig that
accidently died after blood sampling [33]. Although,
C. abortus is mainly linked to reproductive failure and
abortions in pigs, it has previously been identified in
lungs of pigs [46].
Involvement of C. suis was reported in the vast majority of chlamydial intestinal infections in Belgian, German
and Swiss pigs. Chlamydia abortus was rarely found in
these studies [11,12,15,29]. Chlamydia suis was predominantly associated with conjunctivitis in intensively
kept German, Swiss and Estonian pigs [38]. Furthermore, a German study reported a high prevalence of

Schautteet and Vanrompay Veterinary Research 2011, 42:29

Page 6 of 10

mixed infections with C. suis and C. abortus in the lung
and gut of pigs [39].
Chlamydial DNA has been discovered by nested PCR
in 57.1% of the animals of a German wild boar population in Thuringia [44]. Organisms were predominantly
detected in the lung. Sequencing of the amplified ompA
segments revealed C. psittaci, C. abortus and C. suis in
this wild boar population. These findings revealed a possible wildlife reservoir of these bacteria.

5. Pathogenicity
5.1. Experimental infections

The first experimental infection was performed by Pavlov et al. [66] infecting young piglets with chlamydial
agents isolated from Bulgarian pigs. The infection
resulted in keratoconjunctivitis, fever, anorexia and
depression.
The literature describes four conjunctival C. suis
strains: H5, H7, R22 (USA) and DC6 (Germany);
14 C. suis strains obtained from Italian pigs with conjunctival and/or reproductive disorders (MS1 to
MS14); five intestinal strains: R19, R27, 130, 132 (USA)
and S45 (Austria); and two respiratory strains R24 and
R33 (USA) (Table 3). All C. suis strains, with the

exception of S45, originated from pigs with clinical disease. Koch’s postulates have been fulfilled in gnotobiotic pigs using H7 (conjunctivitis), R19 and
R27 (intestinal lesions) and R33 (lung and nasal
lesions) [16-18]. Strain S45 was isolated from the
faeces of an asymptomatic pig, but experimental
enteric infection of gnotobiotic piglets with S45 proved
its pathogenic potential as it elicited significant enteric
disease [67]. Interestingly, Pospischil et al. [43]
reported the occurrence of aberrant C. suis developmental forms, indicative for a persistent infection in
experimentally infected gnotobiotic pigs.
Experimental aerosol challenge with C. suis of conventional raised colostrum-fed pigs confirmed the pathogenic potential of C. suis for the porcine respiratory
system [46,68]. In the latter studies, six week-old pigs
were infected by aerosol using 109 chlamydial inclusionforming units. All infected animals developed an acute
infection characterized by a dry cough, serous nasal discharge and severe dyspnoea accompanied by wheezing,
shortness of breath and breathlessness. The body temperature of the pigs rose above 40°C for at least five
days post infection. Clinical signs lasted for seven days
post infection.

The role of C. suis and C. abortus in reproductive problems is still controversial. One of the reasons for this is
that there are often ethical objections when willing to
proof Koch’s postulates, as it requires C. suis or C. abortus experimental infections of Chlamydiaceae-negative
sows, at different stages of gestation. Moreover, it is
extremely difficult to find Chlamydiaceae-negative sows.
To our knowledge, there is only one study that deals
with an experimental C. abortus infection in sows.
Experimental infections of four sows with the BS ruminant C. psittaci serovar 1 strain at 42 days of gestation
resulted in infection of fetal membranes, but failed to
induce abortion [69].
Guscetti et al. [70] studied the pathogenicity of a
C. psittaci isolate of pigeon origin (T49/90) in three
day-old gnotobiotic piglets. The animals were infected
intragastrically resulting in a productive enteric infection
with mild lesions, weak systemic dissemination, and faecal shedding, indicating the pig as a potential host for
avian Chlamydiaceae. Oral administration of C. suis was
more virulent for three day-old gnotobiotic piglets than
oral inoculation of C. psittaci (pigeon strain T49/90) or
C. abortus (S26/E) [70,71].
5.2. Studies on natural infections

The prevalence, the zoonotic risk and the economic
impact of different chlamydial species occurring in pigs
was difficult to determine because species-specific diagnostic tests were unavailable. Recently, chlamydial speciesspecific NAATs have been developed. These NAATs are
currently being used to study the prevalence and the economic impact of different chlamydial species occurring in
pigs. Chlamydiaceae, and especially, C. suis are widespread
in pigs. Considering the high degree of genetic diversity
observed in C. suis when compared to other chlamydial
species [22,37], incongruent reports on the pathology of
Chlamydiaceae in pigs and variations in virulence support
the theory of genetic diversity [15,21,34,38,39]. Intestinal
C. suis infections seem to be common in commercial pigs
and most, if not all, are believed to be subclinical
[12,15,17,34,72]. However, Evans postulates have been fulfilled for this pathogen [16-18], thus it is probably more
harmful as some might believe. Chlamydia suis was
involved in return to oestrus (early embryonic dead in
more than 50% of the pregnant sows) in sows and inferior
semen quality (decrease of sperm cell motility and dead of
more than 50% of the sperm cells) in boars, as demonstrated on fattening pig farms in Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia,
Germany, Israel and Switzerland [14,21,33,36,39,54].
Becker et al. [38] found a high prevalence of C. suis in eyes
of German (90%) and Swiss (79%) ocular symptomatic
pigs. In general, intensive kept pigs seemed to be predisposed to ocular chlamydial infection associated with
conjunctivitis. Schautteet et al. [36] observed the same,

examining conjunctivitis and reproductive failure on a
large Estonian pig production plant.
Chlamydia suis, C. pecorum and C. abortus have been
detected in aborted foetuses [11,13]. Eggemann et al., [21]
found a significant correlation between chlamydial PCR
positivity and the incidence of abortion and litters with
stillborn piglets and piglets with low viability. Seropositive
farms had statistically less weaned piglets per sow and litter. Hoelzle et al., [39] used two PCRs targeting the ompA
(encoding the MOMP; 40 kDa) or ompB (encoding the
cysteine rich outer membrane protein; 60 kDa) gene,
respectively. The PCR was not species-specific but was
able to detect C. suis, C. pecorum as well as C. abortus in
lungs, intestines and endocervical swabs of pigs. PCR
amplicons were generated from 49 and 60% of pigs with
respiratory or reproductive disorders, respectively. Chlamydial DNA was present in 24.5% of respiratory healthy
controls and in none of the endocervical swabs from fertile
control sows. They found a high prevalence of mixed
C. abortus and C. suis infections in lungs and intestines
using RFLP and DNA sequence analysis of ompA.

6. Public health significance
The zoonotic potential of C. abortus and C. psittaci is
well documented [73]. However, to our knowledge,
transmission of these pathogens from pigs to humans
has not been reported. Chlamydia suis, previously
referred to as C. trachomatis, might be a potential zoonotic pathogen. So far, no reports on zoonotic transmission were published.
7. Prevention and treatment
Chlamydiaceae are highly susceptible to chemicals
that affect their lipid content or the integrity of their
cell walls. Cleaning of equipment and stables of
infected pigs is important because Chlamydiaceae can
survive for up to 30 days in faeces and bed materials.
Disinfection with most common detergents and disinfectants will inactivate Chlamydiaceae. The following
disinfectants can be used to inactivate the organism:
1:1000 dilution of quaternary ammonium compounds,
70% isopropyl alcohol, 1% Lysol, 1:100 dilution of
household bleach or chlorophenols [74,75]. Common
infection sources, infection routes, possible vectors
and infection kinetics on the farm have not been
examined.
Current infections are being treated by means of antibiotics. Generally, tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline) are the drugs of choice to control
the disease because they are most effective. Quinolones
(enrofloxacin) or macrolides (erythromycin) can be administered, in case of an infection with a tetracycline resistant C. suis strain. Enrofloxacin might present a solution
in case of tetracycline resistant C. suis strains [33].

Pollman et al. [76], demonstrated the beneficial effect
of a probiotic strain of Enterococcus faecium (NCIMB
10415) on reducing carryover infections from naturally
Chlamydiaceae infected sows to newborn piglets. The
probiotic strain is licensed by the European Union as a
feed supplement for animals.
So far, no vaccines are available. Chlamydial vaccines
produced for Chlamydiaceae in other animals would likely
have no efficacy in pigs, as the strains are both genetically
and serologically very different. Therefore, Knitz et al. [77]
used a herd-specific, formalin-inactivated C. abortus strain
(OCHL03/99) originating from vaginal discharge of sows
to study the humoral immune response in immunized
breeding sows, as a preliminary study towards vaccine
development. Compared to the control group, vaccinated
animals showed a marked primary and secondary IgG
serum antibody response. Protection was not examined.
Recently, Zhang et al. [78] presented data on vaccination
of mice using a porcine C. abortus strain. They obtained a
protective immune response following co-vaccination
using a DNA vaccine together with recombinant MOMP.
Nevertheless, it is obvious that we need more progress
in understanding protective and (possible) pathological
immune mechanisms in pigs, before a potential vaccine
candidate for Chlamydiaceae can be generated.
