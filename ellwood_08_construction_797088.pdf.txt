Abstract
Background: The development of genetic markers is complex and costly in species with little preexisting genomic information. Faba bean possesses one of the largest and least studied genomes
among cultivated crop plants and no gene-based genetic maps exist. Gene-based orthologous
markers allow chromosomal regions and levels of synteny to be characterised between species,
reveal phylogenetic relationships and chromosomal evolution, and enable targeted identification of
markers for crop breeding. In this study orthologous codominant cross-species markers have been
deployed to produce the first exclusively gene-based genetic linkage map of faba bean (Vicia faba),
using an F6 population developed from a cross between the lines Vf6 (equina type) and Vf27
(paucijuga type).
Results: Of 796 intron-targeted amplified polymorphic (ITAP) markers screened, 151 markers
could be used to construct a comparative genetic map. Linkage analysis revealed seven major and
five small linkage groups (LGs), one pair and 12 unlinked markers. Each LG was comprised of three
to 30 markers and varied in length from 23.6 cM to 324.8 cM. The map spanned a total length of
1685.8 cM. A simple and direct macrosyntenic relationship between faba bean and Medicago
truncatula was evident, while faba bean and lentil shared a common rearrangement relative to M.
truncatula. One hundred and four of the 127 mapped markers in the 12 LGs, which were previously
assigned to M. truncatula genetic and physical maps, were found in regions syntenic between the
faba bean and M. truncatula genomes. However chromosomal rearrangements were observed that
could explain the difference in chromosome numbers between these three legume species. These
rearrangements suggested high conservation of M. truncatula chromosomes 1, 5 and 8; moderate
conservation of chromosomes 2, 3, 4 and 7 and no conservation with M. truncatula chromosome
6. Multiple PCR amplicons and comparative mapping were suggestive of small-scale duplication
events in faba bean. This study also provides a preliminary indication for finer scale macrosynteny
between M. truncatula, lentil and faba bean. Markers originally designed from genes on the same M.

truncatula BACs were found to be grouped together in corresponding syntenic areas in lentil and
faba bean.
Conclusion: Despite the large size of the faba bean genome, comparative mapping did not reveal
evidence for polyploidisation, segmental duplication, or significant rearrangements compared to M.
truncatula, although a bias in the use of single locus markers may have limited the detection of
duplications. Non-coding repetitive DNA or transposable element content provides a possible
explanation for the difference in genome sizes. Similar patterns of rearrangements in faba bean and
lentil compared to M. truncatula support phylogenetic studies dividing these species into the tribes
Viceae and Trifoliae. However, substantial macrosynteny was apparent between faba bean and M.
truncatula, with the exception of chromosome 6 where no orthologous markers were found,
confirming previous investigations suggesting chromosome 6 is atypical. The composite map,
anchored with orthologous markers mapped in M. truncatula, provides a central reference map for
future use of genomic and genetic information in faba bean genetic analysis and breeding.

Background
Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is currently the third most important cool-season food legume in the world. Faba bean provides an important source of dietary protein in human
diet, edible oil and animal feeds. Like other grain legumes,
faba bean contributes to sustainable agriculture in the
management of soil fertility and plays an essential role in
crop rotation. Faba bean is a diploid with 2n = 2x = 12
chromosomes [1,2], is partially cross-pollinated ranging
from 4 to 84% [3], and possesses one of the largest
genomes among crop legumes (~13000 Mb). The development of saturated linkage maps as well as the identification and map-based isolation of important qualitative
traits or quantitative trait loci is therefore complex and
expensive.
A saturated genetic linkage map provides an invaluable
tool in plant genetic studies and practical breeding. One
of the first genetic linkage maps of faba bean was constructed by Van de Ven et al. [4] with only 17 markers; followed by successively more detailed genetic maps by
Torres et al. [5] with 51 markers, Satovic et al. [6] with 157
markers, Vaz Patto et al. [7] with 116 markers, Roman et
al. [8] with 121 markers, Roman et al. [9] with 192 markers and Avila et al. [10] with 103 markers. To date, faba
bean genetic maps have been restricted to morphological,
isozyme, RFLP, RAPD, a few seed protein genes and four
SSR markers. These markers have been limited either in
number, transferability or in their ability to provide syntenic information with other legume species.
The recent generation of abundant genomic and genetic
resources focussed around the model species Medicago
truncatula and Lotus Japonicus has opened up abundant
opportunities for creating gene-based molecular markers
that are ideal for genetic mapping in general and comparative mapping in particular [11-16]. In this approach, oligonucleotide primers were designed from sequences of

conserved regions in gene exons that flank polymorphic
regions such as introns or microsatellites. This PCR-based,
codominant marker system has remarkably increased the
efficiency of transferring genetic information across species. Examples include the comparison of M. truncatula
with alfalfa, pea, chickpea, soybean, mung bean, lentil
and lupins [12-18].
Comparative genomic studies can expose and confirm
phylogenetic relationships among species and determine
patterns of chromosomal evolution and syntenic relationships. More importantly, comprehensive comparative
genomics can facilitate back-and-forth use of genomic
resources between different legumes species, and help to
reduce cost and increase efficiency in genetic research as
well as crop breeding. The use of conserved genome structure to assist in transferring knowledge among related
plant species is well established in grasses [19,20] where
synteny greatly assists in gene identification among
related species.
In this paper we report: (1) the application of gene-based
markers in faba bean; (2) the development of the first
exclusively gene-based genetic and comparative map for
the species; (3) analysis of syntenic relationship between
faba bean and M. truncatula; and (4) the levels of homology existing between faba bean, M. truncatula and lentil, a
closely related species to faba bean.

Methods
Genetic mapping population
A gene-based genetic map of faba bean genome was constructed using a population of 94 F6 RILs generated from
a cross between faba bean line Vf6 (equina type) as the
pollen recipient and line Vf27 as pollen donor (paucijuga
type). These accessions have been widely used in previous
genetic studies [7,9,21] and the population was developed at IFAPA, Centro Alameda del Obispo, in Córdoba,

Spain, using diploid parental individuals. Total genomic
DNA was isolated from each parent and F6 individual as
previously described [22].
Primer design
A total of 796 intron-targeted amplified polymorphic
markers (ITAPs) were used for this study. These were composed of four sets of ITAPs; 340 ML and Lup primers
developed from alignment of M. truncatula and Lupinus
spp. database EST sequences; 160 MLG primers based on
alignments between M. truncatula, Lupinus albus, and Glycine max ([15], with a subset of these denoted AtMtL-);
143 cross-species makers (MP) developed by the Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis,
USA [12]; and 140 GLIP markers created by the European
Grain Legumes Integrated Project (GLIP) based on primarily on M. truncatula and pea (Andrea Seres, pers. comm.).
The majority of the ITAPs markers could be positioned to
a physical location in the M. truncatula psuedogenome
since most primers were designed from genes in characterized chromosomal regions.
Polymorphism detection
Each primer pair was screened on V. faba parental DNA.
PCR conditions were optimised to produce clear single
amplicons, and single PCR products of the same size were
purified and directly sequenced. Different detection methods were used to genotype the F6 population dependent
on the type of polymorphism [15]. Details of each marker
are given in Additional file 1.
Map construction
Chi-squared analysis (P < 0.05) was applied to test the
segregation of the mapped markers against the expected
Mendelian segregation ratio for co-dominant inheritance
in the faba bean F6 RIL population. Genetic linkage mapping was conducted with MultiPoint v 1.2 software [23],
with a recombination fraction (rf) of 0.29 (LOD = 9.0)
using 5000 bootstraps. Map distances were calculated in
cM by applying the "Kosambi" function. Groups of linked
markers that were similarly distorted were accepted for
linkage mapping. Independent markers showing signifi-

cant segregation distortion and markers with missing data
(> 10%) were rejected for linkage to avoid bias and false
linkages. Genetic maps were drawn with the software program MapChart v 2.1 [24].
Establishment of macrosyntenic relationships between
faba bean, lentil and M. truncatula
Markers mapped in faba bean were located on the M. truncatula map by aligning the ESTs originally used to design
the ITAPs primers with M. truncatula BACs in the Medicago pseudogenome Mt2.0 build 8/10/2007. Alignments
with a BLAST E values < 1e-20, hsp identity ≥ 60%, and hsp
length > 50 nt were retained. Precise positions of markers
were obtained by aligning the ITAP primer sequences with
M. truncatula BACs using BLASTN with an expected value
< 1e-4 (primer length varied from 18bp to 28bp). Approximate positions of markers that had been genetically
mapped in M. truncatula but not yet positioned on the
physical map were obtained from the M. truncatula
genetic map [25].
Loci dot plot created via Grid Map
Grid Map [26] was used to compare the genetic maps of
faba bean and M. truncatula. Ordered loci from faba bean
and M. truncatula linkage groups were listed vertically and
horizontally, respectively, and dots were positioned on
the diagram at the intersection of the locations of the corresponding markers in the two genetic maps.

Results
Gene-based marker development
Of the 796 markers screened for amplification in genomic
faba bean DNA, 19% produced two or more amplicons of
different sizes. Five hundred and seven were selected and
optimised for single-locus amplification. Fifty percent
(254) of these produced clear single band amplicons
(Table 1). Seven markers that produced two amplicons
(AIGP, GLIP172, GLIP429, GLIP621, GLIP651, Lup226
and MMK1) and one that produced three amplicons
(LG34) were also mapped as they exhibited convenient
length polymorphisms. One hundred and sixty-five polymorphic markers were identified (Table 1), of which 151

markers were used to genotype the 94 individuals of the
F6 RIL population (supplementary Table 1). Apart from
the GLIP markers which were selected for their ability to
amplify faba bean genomic DNA before this study, 'MLG'
and 'MP' markers worked equally well in faba bean (83%
and 84%, respectively) but 'MP' markers produced fewer
polymorphic amplicons. Amplification rate of the 'ML'
markers was the poorest (34%), less than half the rate of
the 'MLG' and 'MP' groups (Table 1). Likewise, the polymorphism level of the 'ML' markers was the lowest. Both
'MLG' and 'GLIP' markers produced very high levels of
polymorphism in the mapping parents (70%; Table 1).
DNA sequences of markers have been submitted to Genbank under accession codes FH893713 – FH937528.
Nineteen mapped markers (> 12%) deviated significantly
(P < 0.05) from the expected Mendelian inheritance ratio
of 1:1. About half of these markers (9) were highly distorted (P < 0.01). Fifty percent of the distorted markers
segregated in favour of the Vf6 parent and fifty percent in
favour of Vf27. Nine of the 12 faba bean LGs contained
one to four of these distorted markers, which tended to be
scattered throughout the faba bean genome. However, it
is noteworthy that distorted markers grouped together in
chromosomes FB-1, 7 and 8 (Figure 1).
The first gene-based and comparative map of Faba bean
A total of 151 genic markers were used to generate the first
gene-based and comparative map of faba bean. This map
was constructed with a recombination fraction of 0.29
[LOD = 9.0, 27]. The map consists of seven main linkage
groups (FB-1 to FB-7) and 5 fragments (FB-8 to FB-12),
which varied in length from 23.6 to 324.8 cM, and spans
a total of nearly 1686 cM (Figure 1 and Table 2). The
number of markers per LG ranged from three to 30 markers. In addition, there was one pair and thirteen unlinked
markers. Eight markers co-segregated at four loci, (three
loci in FB-1, one in FB-3; Figure 1 and Table 2). The maximum distances between markers ranged from 13.8 cM in
FB-12 to 40.2 cM in FB-3 with an overall mean gap distance of 14.6 cM (Table 2).

Of the 135 genic markers that mapped to the 12 faba bean
LGs in Figure 1, 127 were assigned to the M. truncatula
genetic or physical maps [25]. One hundred and four of
these (82%) were in syntenic regions. Clear evidence of a
simple and direct macrosyntenic relationship between the
V. faba and M. truncatula is presented in the dot matrix in
Figure 2. The formation of clear isoclinic diagonal lines
along the linkage groups provides a strong indication of
the conservation of gene order in the two legume
genomes. The extensive colinearity was particularly prevailing between FB LG 1, 2, 3, 4 and Mt LG 8, 1, 4, 5 where
syntenic regions accounted for 90%, 86%, 50% and 47%

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/380

of the M. truncatula pseudogenome, respectively (Table
3).
However, chromosomal rearrangements were also evident
at a moderate level. For example, M. truncatula chromosomes 1 and 7 together with 5 and 2 merged to form the
faba bean LGs 2 and 4, respectively. Similarly, M. truncatula chromosome 2 splits into FB- 4 and 8 and M. truncatula chromosome 3 into FB-5 and 9 (Table 3 and Figure 2).
Inversions and translocations were also notable among
the orthologous markers within each syntenic pair of faba
bean and M. truncatula LGs (Figure 2).
Evidence of macrosynteny among faba bean, lentil and
Medicago truncatula
A high level of co-linearity was found between the faba
bean, lentil and M. truncatula genomes based on the
macro-synteny established between faba bean and M.
truncatula (this study) or lentil and M. truncatula [15]
using only common orthologous markers which mapped
in all three species (Figures 3 and 4). The pattern of
homology between faba bean and M. truncatula was similar to that between lentil and M. truncatula: for example,
two linkage groups FB-1 and Len-II were exclusively syntenic to M. truncatula LG_8 and shared seven markers in
common. Common markers were evenly distributed in all
the three corresponding LGs suggesting that FB-1 and LenII are essentially co-linear (Figure 3A). Likewise, FB-2 and
Len-III were both syntenic to Mt-1 and orthologous to
each other with nine markers in common (Figure 3B).
Other examples are FB-3, Len-I and Mt-4; and FB-4, Len-V
and Mt-5 (Figure 2, 4A and Phan et al., 2007 [15]). FB-5
and FB-9 were co-linear with lentil Len-VII and LenVI,
respectively, and both pairs of these linkage groups were
colinear with Mt-3 (Figure 4B). This suggests shared
ancestral chromosomal changes in faba bean and lentil
compared to M. truncatula and confirms their phylogenetically closer relationship.
Evidence of fine scale macrosynteny on individual BACs
between faba bean, lentil and Medicago truncatula
Several ITAP markers used in this study were designed
from different genes on the same M. truncatula BACs.
These markers often mapped in clusters in two or more
species and in common syntenic regions of corresponding
linkage groups. An example is shown in Figure 3A with
markers LG89-LG98 designed from M. truncatula BAC
AC140032 and LG83-LG88 from M. truncatula BAC
AC138131 in M. truncatula chromosome 8. Similarly,
with the exception of LG34c, markers LG31-LG43
designed from M. truncatula BAC AC152751 in Mt chromosome 1 were located in one area of FB-2 and Len-III as
shown in Figure 3B; markers AnMtL6-AnMtL8 and
LG102-LG112 from M. truncatula BAC AC147712 and
AC135800 in Mt chromosome 3 were grouped together

Discussion and conclusion
The first genetic map of faba bean composed exclusively
with gene-based co-dominant molecular markers was

constructed using a F6 RIL population between lines Vf6
and Vf27. The map is also the first to enable the establishment of syntenic relationships between faba bean and the
model legume M. truncatula, comparison with other legume species, and integration with genetic maps available
in faba bean.

The map is composed of 12 linkage groups and 151
genetic markers. Although the number of chromosomes
in faba bean has been reported as 2n = 12 [2], the number
of linkage groups in recent genetic maps in the species
range from 13 to 18 [7-10] and previously as many as 48
have been reported [6]. The high number of linkage
groups compared to the number of chromosomes may be
due to the fact that faba bean possesses one of the largest
genomes among cultivated legumes (~13000 Mb). This

compares with other well-characterised species such as M.
truncatula, chickpea, soybean, lentil and pea which have
genomes of ~450 Mb, ~740 Mb, ~1200 Mb, ~4000 Mb
and ~4000 Mb respectively [28].
Of the 24 non-orthologous markers found in this study,
eight were from primer pairs where more than one PCR
gel band was present and where two or more such amplicons were mapped. In each case, at least one amplicon
mapped syntenically. The percentages of markers
sequenced in faba bean were lower compared to lentil
(63%, 26% and 55% compared to 93%, 69% and 65% for
MP, ML and MLG markers respectively, Table 1). This was
due to higher proportion of markers amplifying multiple
bands in faba bean compared to lentil (data not shown),
which may imply duplication. Differences in amplification, sequencing and polymorphism rates among different types of markers used for this study reflect the mode
of design of the markers. Since 'MP' and 'MLG' markers
were often based on the homology of more than two phylogenetically distant species, they are more likely to work
in different legume lineages. The same observation was
reported for these primer sets in lentil [15].
Despite the large differences in genome sizes between M.
truncatula and V. faba, a simple and direct relationship
between the two genomes was identified in this study.
Given the number of markers used (151), the syntenic
regions cover a large proportion of M. truncatula pseudogenome with 90%, 87%, 66%, 62% and 47% for M. truncatula chromosomes 8, 1, 3, 4 and 5, respectively (Table
3). The appearance of clear isoclinic diagonal lines along
the linkage groups in Figure 2 also demonstrates strong
evidence for the extensive co-linearity between linkage
group pairs of the two species. Similar high levels of conservation have also been reported between L. culinaris ssp.

1Data was either based on information from M. truncatula genome sequencing website [25] or from Choi et al. [12].
2Data is provided for three or more colinear markers and excludes markers on the same chromosome rearranged relative to the order in M.
truncatula.

culinaris and M. truncatula [15] and other closely related
legumes such as L. culinaris ssp. culinaris and P. sativum
[29], M. sativa and P. sativum [30], M. truncatula and P.
sativum [17], M. truncatula and M. sativa [11]. This study
also shows markers originally designed from genes on the
same BAC clustered in corresponding syntenic areas in
lentil and faba bean. The mapping populations were too
small to resolve marker order in lentil and faba bean but
extensive conservation of gene order,(and microsynteny)
has been shown in previous studies between other legume
species at similar or greater phylogenetic distances [12,3134], and to some extent between M. truncatula and Arabidopsis [33-35].
A higher level of homology between V. faba and L. culinaris ssp. culinaris compared to that between V. faba and
M. truncatula could be inferred from this study based on
the common markers mapped in the two genomes, common homology with M. truncatula and similar pattern of
rearrangements (Figures 3, 4 and Phan et al., 2007 [15]).
This finding agrees with phylogenetic studies that place
the genera Vicia, Lens and Pisum within the tribe Viceae
while Medicago and Melilotus form a parallel tribe Trifolieae within the Galegoid or cool season legumes [36], and

is consistent with different levels of macrosynteny
observed between M. truncatula, P. sativum, V. radiata, G.
max, and Phaceolus vulgaris dependent on phylogenetic
distance [12]. However, chromosomal rearrangements
were evident (Figures 2 and 3).
Rearrangements involving Mt6 and Mt3 in particular may
explain the differences in chromosome number between
the two species (M. truncatula: n = 8; V. faba: n = 6). Mt6
might be considered unusual and is largely composed of
heterochromatic DNA [37], contains few transcribed
genes [11] and a large proportion of resistance gene analogues [38]. In this study no corresponding linkage group
was detected in faba bean, as found previously in pea [12]
and lupin [13,14], together with less than five percent estimated coverage by the L. japonicus genome [34]. In faba
bean FB5 and FB9 appear to correspond to Mt3. This configuration is supported by a similar pattern in lentil (Figure 4B and Phan et al., 2007 [15]), although a larger
number of markers are needed to confirm this.
The faba bean comparative map constructed here is consistent with the pattern of chromosome conservation previously observed, where different levels of conservation

Figure 3of shared macrosynteny between V. faba chromosomes FB-1 and FB-2, L. culinaris and M. truncatula
Evidence
Evidence of shared macrosynteny between V. faba chromosomes FB-1 and FB-2, L. culinaris and M. truncatula.
Common orthologous markers are depicted by dashed lines and marker distances are provided in centi-Morgans for M. truncatula only. The figures exclude markers that could not be positioned in the M. truncatula psuedogenome. A ~ indicates markers

derivation from primer pairs that produced multiple PCR products.

were found to be relatively consistent between M. truncatula and other legume species i.e. high conservation of M.
truncatula chromosomes 1, 5 and 8; moderate conservation in the M. truncatula chromosomes 2, 3, 4 and 7 and
lowest conservation in the M. truncatula chromosome 6
(Figures 3, 4 and [39]). As described above, no homology
was identified with M. truncatula chromosome 6 in this
study. The alignment of this faba bean map with lentil
and the current M. truncatula genome based on M. truncatula genome assembly Mt2.0 is slightly different to that
based on an earlier assembly [15]. The changes can be
observed in Figure 3B where orthologous markers which

were syntenic to M. truncatula chromosome 6 in lentil are
now co-linear with M. truncatula chromosome 1 in common with faba bean.
Genome studies have demonstrated different factors are
responsible for genome size variation and speciation.
These include ancient polyploidisation events in the case
of the Brassicas [40]; segmental or region-specific duplication [41]; and genetic rearrangements, transposable element amplification, or combination of different genome
modifications [42]. Large scale rearrangements, duplications, or polyploidisation were not apparent in this study,

Figure 4of shared macrosynteny between V. faba chromosomes FB-3 and FB-5, L. culinaris and M. truncatula
Evidence
Evidence of shared macrosynteny between V. faba chromosomes FB-3 and FB-5, L. culinaris and M. truncatula.
Common orthologous markers are depicted by dashed lines and marker distances are provided in centi-Morgans for M. truncatula only. The figures exclude markers that could not be positioned in the M. truncatula psuedogenome. Markers highlighted *
were previously mapped [18] but not positioned in the M. truncatula psuedogenome. # indicates markers orthologous between
lentil and faba bean but unmapped in M. truncatula and markers suffixed a, b or c denotes derivation from primer pairs that produced multiple PCR products.

possibly as a result of the focus on single locus markers,
however differences in non-coding repetitive DNA or
transposable elements provide a possible explanation for
the large differences in genome size. Retroelements are
known to account for substantial proportions of these
Viceae genomes as shown by extensive studies in pea, for
example [43,44], and more recently Vicia [45,46]. Local
genic rearrangements similar to that in found in the
grasses (duplications, translocations, and insertions or
deletions) may explain multiple PCR amplicons [19,20].

The shared macrosynteny among the three species demonstrated here and even higher level of homology
between L. culinaris and V. faba will undoubtedly facilitate
the identification of markers closely linked to traits of
interest in V. faba. Alignment of this map with existing
faba bean maps containing important traits with polymorphic SSR markers and/or markers developed in this
study, coupled with cross-reference to the abundant
genetic information from the Medicago genome sequencing and extensive EST libraries available for the model leg-

ume species, will undoubtedly assist this process. As the
parental line Vf6 has been used in a number of genetic
and QTL mapping projects [6,7,9], this map can serve as a
central reference map. This study has provided a number
of significant outcomes for faba bean genomics and legume genomics in general.
