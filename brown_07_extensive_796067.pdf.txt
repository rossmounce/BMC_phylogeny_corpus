Abstract
Background: A central question in the evolutionary diversification of large, widespread, mobile
mammals is how substantial differentiation can arise, particularly in the absence of topographic or
habitat barriers to dispersal. All extant giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are currently considered to
represent a single species classified into multiple subspecies. However, geographic variation in traits
such as pelage pattern is clearly evident across the range in sub-Saharan Africa and abrupt transition
zones between different pelage types are typically not associated with extrinsic barriers to gene
flow, suggesting reproductive isolation.
Results: By analyzing mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite loci, we show that
there are at least six genealogically distinct lineages of giraffe in Africa, with little evidence of
interbreeding between them. Some of these lineages appear to be maintained in the absence of
contemporary barriers to gene flow, possibly by differences in reproductive timing or pelage-based
assortative mating, suggesting that populations usually recognized as subspecies have a long history
of reproductive isolation. Further, five of the six putative lineages also contain genetically discrete
populations, yielding at least 11 genetically distinct populations.
Conclusion: Such extreme genetic subdivision within a large vertebrate with high dispersal
capabilities is unprecedented and exceeds that of any other large African mammal. Our results have
significant implications for giraffe conservation, and imply separate in situ and ex situ management,
not only of pelage morphs, but also of local populations.

Background
In highly mobile species that are distributed across continuous habitat, persistent gene flow can stifle genetic differentiation and speciation [1]. Adult giraffes (Giraffa
camelopardalis) weigh in excess of 1000 kg [2], frequently

range over several hundred square km and are capable of
long distance movements of 50–300 km [3]. Further,
giraffes live in loosely constructed social groups with large
home range sizes, ranging from 5 km2 to 992 km2 [3,4]
throughout scrub and savannah habitat from the Sahel to

Figure subdivision in the giraffe based on mitochondrial DNA sequences
Genetic 1
Genetic subdivision in the giraffe based on mitochondrial DNA sequences. (A) Approximate geographic ranges,
pelage patterns, and phylogenetic relationships between giraffe subspecies based on mtDNA sequences. Colored dots on the
map represent sampling localities (see Additional files 1 and 10 for detailed locality information). The phylogenetic tree is a
maximum-likelihood phylogram based on 1707 nucleotides of mtDNA sequence (1143 nt of cytochrome b, 429 nt control
region and 135 nt of tRNA) from 266 giraffes. Asterisks along branches correspond to node-support values of > 90% bootstrap
support. Stars at branch tips identify paraphyletic haplotypes found in Masai and reticulated giraffes. (B) Minimum-spanning network of control region haplotypes using the molecular-variance parsimony algorithm (see Additional file 8), where circles represent haplotypes, numbers within them correspond to haplotype designations, and circle sizes are proportional to the
haplotype's frequency in the population. Branches represent a single nucleotide change and black squares represent multiple
changes (indicated by adjacent numbers). Colors are coded as in Figure 1A.

South Africa (Figure 1A). These life history attributes
would predict that low levels of differentiation should be
found among populations because the extent of gene flow
is related to the dispersal potential of individuals [5].
Consistent with this prediction, large-bodied mammals
such as the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) generally have low levels of
differentiation between adjacent populations [6,7].

However, giraffes exhibit a marked pattern of geographic
variation in pelage coloration (Figure 1A) as well as in
ossicone number [8,9] and mitochondrial variation [10]
suggesting significant population differentiation despite
the potential for high rates of genetic exchange.
Within the last century, numerous taxonomic schemes
have been developed to reflect the regional differences in
pelage pattern and morphology. These schemes have
ranged from the recognition of two species, G. reticulata
and G. camelopardalis and 10 subspecies for the latter [8],
to the recognition of a single species (G. camelopardalis),
with nine [11], eight [12], six [13] or five [14] subspecies
(Table 1). The controversy regarding giraffe subspecies in
part reflects high variability in pelage patterns within
some populations [15] and suspected hybridization
among putative subspecies [2,16,17]. Nonetheless, the
boundaries between pelage types and the subspecies they
represent can be abrupt and do not necessarily correspond
to apparent habitat or topographic obstacles to dispersal.
For example, in Kenya, Masai (G.c. tippleskirchi), reticulated (G.c. reticulata), and Rothschild's giraffes (G.c. rothschildi) have geographic boundaries in continuous acacia
scrub woodland habitat [2]. The marked geographic differences in characters such as pelage pattern (Figure 1A)
suggest reproductive isolation despite the potential for
genetic exchange, yet to date, no comprehensive genetic
studies using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers
have been conducted to evaluate this hypothesis.
In this study, we present a phylogeographic and population genetic analysis of the giraffe across most of the species' remaining geographic range. We sampled freeranging giraffes representing six of the nine subspecies
defined by Dagg and Foster [11] who used specific morphologic criteria and recognized five distinct pelage patterns (Table 1, Figure 1A). We assessed genetic variation in
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 14 nuclear
microsatellite loci. We found concordant patterns of
genetic subdivision in morphology and genetics coincident with subspecies boundaries and a fine scale pattern
of genetic subdivision within putative subspecies. Such
striking genetic partitioning within a highly mobile species is surprising, and implies environmental and behavioral mechanisms limit gene flow between populations.
Our results have important conservation implications, as
some of these genetically distinct populations clearly represent evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) that are
highly threatened and lack appropriate recognition in current management plans.

the cytochrome b (CYTb) gene to the end of hypervariable
region 1 of the control region in 266 giraffes from 19
localities (see Additional file 1) and one okapi (Okapia
johnstoni). We detected 35 haplotypes that differed by 1–
37 substitutions (uncorrected pairwise distance = 0.15–
5.66%). To ensure phylogenetic resolution and robust
support for relationships among haplotypes, the remaining portion of the CYTb gene was amplified and
sequenced from 35 giraffes, representing each of the 35
unique haplotypes, and the okapi (1709 nt total). Phylogenetic analysis of these 35 sequences revealed the existence of seven primary clades that are well supported with
bootstrap values generally over 90%. Moreover, these
clades are largely consistent with pelage patterns and
putative subspecific designations (Figure 1A). First, we
found two West African haplotypes defined a cluster that
is sister to a clade of three haplotypes belonging to the
Rothschild's giraffes. This clade of West African and Rothschild's giraffe haplotypes is also supported by a synapomorphic single nucleotide insertion (A at position 350 of
the 654-nt fragment) in the control region. These two
clades are reciprocally monophyletic to a clade defined by
the majority of haplotypes from the reticulated giraffe. A
fourth and fifth clade are defined by Masai giraffe haplotypes east and west of the Rift Valley in Kenya. The Masai
clade east of the Rift Valley is sister to a South African
giraffe grouping defined by two haplotypes. Finally, a seventh clade is defined solely by Angolan giraffe haplotypes,
which all share a synapomorphic T insertion at position
355 (of the 654-nt fragment) of the control region. The
seven clades are grouped into two or three larger clades,
depending on the method of rooting (Figure 1A; see Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), although relationships among
these larger clades was not well resolved. Notably, midpoint rooting, which places the root at the midpoint
between the most divergent lineages (assuming a uniform
rate of molecular evolution), divided giraffes into a northern group containing Western, Rothschild's and reticulated giraffes and a southern group containing Masai,
Angolan and South African giraffes (Figure 1A).

Two haplotypes were paraphyletic with respect to their
subspecies (stars at terminals in Figure 1A). One highly
divergent haplotype was found in a single reticulated
giraffe and formed a sister lineage to the clade containing
West African, Rothschild's, and all other reticulated giraffe
haplotypes. A second haplotype was found in nine Masai
giraffes and clustered with the reticulated giraffe haplotypes. These isolated cases of paraphyly likely represent
ancient introgression events [18] or incomplete lineage
sorting of variants rather than recent gene flow given the
congruence between subspecies and nuclear DNA data
patterns (see below).
Divergence times between the seven clades obtained from
coalescence analysis [19] ranged from 0.13–0.37 million
years (MY) between Masai and South African clades, to
0.54–1.62 MY between the southern clade (Masai, Angolan and South African giraffes) and the northern clade
(West African, Rothschild's and reticulated giraffes)
(Table 2). Values for the northern giraffe grouping were
intermediate, with West African and Rothschild's giraffes
diverging about 0.16–0.46 MY ago, and the two splitting
from reticulated giraffes about 0.18–0.54 MY ago. These
dates argue for a mid to late Pleistocene radiation of
giraffes.
Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance [20] based
only on the mtDNA control region data (429 nt) corroborates the phylogenetic results (see Additional file 8).
Groupings according to the six subspecies resulted in substantially higher values of genetic variance partitioned
among groups (φct = 75.37, p < 0.001) than alternative
groupings, corresponding to the deeper clades (see Additional file 8). Haplotype (h) and nucleotide (π) diversity
of giraffe control region sequences were generally low
except for Masai and reticulated giraffes, which had values
an order of magnitude greater than other groups (Figure
1B; see Additional file 9). The higher mtDNA diversity in
both Masai and reticulated giraffes and the central placement of their haplotypes in the minimum-spanning

network (Figure 1B) suggest that East Africa could
represent the geographic origin of giraffes, consistent with
the fact that the earliest fossil remains of Giraffa camelopardalis have been recovered in East Africa [21].
Analysis of microsatellite loci
Genetic structure was also inferred for 381 individuals
from 18 localities (see Additional file 10) using 14
unlinked microsatellite loci [22] all in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (see Additional files 11 and 12). Giraffe genotypes were strongly clustered into subspecific groups
based on neighbor-joining analysis of allele-sharing
genetic distances (Figure 2). Likewise, Bayesian clustering
analysis of multilocus genotypes using STRUCTURE [23]
resolved all six groups and, in addition, revealed striking
subdivision at the population level, with 11 of the 18
sampling localities resolved as distinct genetic clusters at
K = 13 and in assignment tests (Figure 3 and Additional
file 13). Assignment probabilities correctly classified 371
of 381 (97%) individuals to population of origin (p >
0.90; see Additional file 13). Only three individuals were
identified as hybrids between adjacent groups (see Additional files 14 and 15). Allele frequency differentiation of
groups, as measured by Fst, was significant for all pairwise
comparisons (p < 0.05, G test) and ranged from 0.113 to
0.466 (see Additional file 16A). These results suggest low
levels of gene flow among groups. Bayesian inference of
migration rates using microsatellite data suggests
migration rates are less than 0.2% per generation between
the six subspecific groups (Additional file 17). The Fst values among giraffe subspecies are comparable to that
observed between forest and savannah species of the

African elephant [6] and the levels of genetic structure
observed within giraffe subspecies (Figures 2 and 3) are
unprecedented for such a large and highly mobile African
mammal.
Although hybridization in the wild has been reported for
some subspecies (e.g., Masai and reticulated giraffes [2]),
our results show little evidence for genetic exchange
between subspecies or the 11 genetic units defined by
STRUCTURE (Figures 2 and 3; Additional file 13). Only
three potential subspecies hybrids in our sample of 381
individuals were identified by assignment tests (see Additional file 14) and include two Rothschild's/reticulated
hybrids, and one Masai/reticulated hybrid. In fact, neighboring populations often show high levels of differentiation despite being closely situated (e.g., Masai, reticulated
and Rothschild's giraffes in Kenya [2]) and not separated
by apparent habitat or topographic boundaries. Within
subspecies, the three reticulated giraffe localities were all
significantly differentiated (microsatellite Fst = 0.093–
0.113; see Additional file 16D) even though they range
from only 67 to 134 km distant. Genetic differentiation
was also significant between four of the Masai giraffe sampling locations within Serengeti National Park (microsatellite Fst = 0.080–0.126; see Additional file 16G) even
through they range from only 60 to 130 km distant. The
absence of genetic exchange, even between subspecies
sharing a common geographic boundary, suggests they
might be reproductively isolated.

Discussion
Historical causes of diversification
Our genetic results reveal the existence of sharp geographic subdivisions in mitochondrial DNA sequences
and microsatellite allele frequencies, which are
concordant with subspecific geographic ranges (Figures 1
and 2). Estimated divergence times among giraffe clades
suggest a mid to late Pleistocene diversification of giraffes
during a time of intense climatic change in sub-Saharan
Africa [24-26]. Specifically, three climate-related factors
could have influenced isolation among giraffe populations. First, paleoclimatic evidence indicates increasing
aridity and cooler conditions beginning in the Late
Pliocene that likely reduced connectivity between habitats
favored by giraffes [24,27]. Second, pronounced periodic
oscillations of wet and dry conditions driven by changes
in the intensity and location of maximal insolation and
with a 21000 year periodicity could have facilitated habitat fragmentation and population isolation [27,28].
Third, regional changes in habitat distribution could have
promoted the isolation of specific populations, such as
the expansion of the Mega Kalahari desert basin during
dry periods of the Late Pleistocene that might have isolated Angolan and South African giraffe populations [29].

etation and habitat, leading to population divergence,
then the phylogeographical patterns of giraffes should
also be found in other species. Indeed, western, eastern,
and southern African phylogeographic groupings in the
giraffe mtDNA genealogy are broadly concordant with the
genetic patterns observed in other taxa of large African
mammals and might correspond to former habitat refuges
[30]. For example, the phylogeographic patterns in the
giraffe are strikingly congruent with those observed in the
hartebeest (Alcelaphus spp.) complex [31,32]. Such concordance in phylogeographic patterns among multiple
unrelated species suggests histories shaped by similar
environmental forces, namely, changes in habitat related
to climatic fluctuations [24], in agreement with models of
environmentally driven evolution [33-35].
Factors currently maintaining isolation among giraffe
populations
Past historical factors leading to allopatric divergence
could explain broad scale geographic divisions among
western, eastern, and southern phylogeographic groupings. However, based on current knowledge of ecological
or topographic factors, our results imply that those factors
alone cannot explain the reproductive isolation among
the parapatric subspecies of giraffes found in East Africa
(Masai, Rothschild's, and reticulated giraffes). Indeed,
despite suggestions that hybridization occurs frequently
among giraffe subspecies, our microsatellite data suggests
that such events are quite rare, occurring in only three of
381 sampled individuals (0.8%). In East Africa, one contributing factor to reproductive isolation might be natural
selection for a reproductive cycle coincident with the
emergence of new browse in contrasting climate regimes.
The dry season occurs in July and August in the Sahelian
zone north of the equator in contrast to December to
March to the south [36]. Giraffes exhibit strong seasonality in births associated with the dry season when, in anticipation of the wetter conditions to follow, a flush of new
tree shoots grow, and the protein content of browse is
highest [37]. Rapid growth in juvenile giraffes is advantageous, especially during the first year, when mortality due
to predation can range between 50–70% [12,38]. Consequently, hybridization between giraffes North and South
of the equator could result in offspring born at the inappropriate season and have reduced fitness. Additionally,
the apparent absence of strong post-mating barriers to
reproduction in captivity [11,39] suggests a role for
behavioral isolation in the wild. Our finding that pelage
and genetic divergence in both maternally and biparentally inherited genetic markers are concordant on a broad
geographic scale implicates pelage-based mate preferences
as a possible isolating factor. Communication among
giraffes is primarily visual [11] and given marked variation in pelage, assortative mating by pelage type could
occur among some populations. For example, sexual

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/57

imprinting, in which early exposure to conspecifics influences mate choice later in life [40], can cause speciation
between populations that have diverged in allopatry and
experience reinforcement upon secondary contact [4143]. Although giraffes live in loose, non-territorial herds,
calves are likely to be in close contact with only their
mothers and other members of the local crèche until they
are several months old [44]. Thus, individual giraffes
might develop pelage-specific mate preferences, even in
regions of overlap between subspecies. In zoo settings,
visual barriers to interbreeding might not be maintained
if calves are exposed to multiple pelage types. These tentative hypotheses need testing from comparative field studies focused on giraffe dispersal and reproductive biology.
The fine-scaled patterns of population isolation we
observe within giraffe subspecies (Figure 3) are surprising
given that giraffe social groupings and home ranges are
known to be highly transient [2,4]. However, our genetic
results suggest that giraffe social structure might be much
more stable over the long term than has been shown by
previous short-term observational field studies [4] and
might also have a major influence on genetic differentiation among populations at larger geographic scales (i.e.,
subspecies).
Genetic units and potential giraffe species
The concordant genetic and phenotypic divisions among
giraffe subspecies (Figures 1 and 2) and the near absence
of hybrids even between parapatric subspecies (e.g.
among Masai, reticulated and Rothschild's giraffes) suggest that the giraffe might represent more than one species. Criteria for species designation vary according to the
taxonomic group considered and the biological properties
emphasized. For example, the biological species concept
emphasizes reproductive isolation [1] whereas the
phylogenetic species concept emphasizes fixed and diagnosable differences among species [45]. However, despite
the differences among species concepts, there is a general
consensus that species are separately-evolving metapopulation lineages united by gene flow [46]. We have shown
that among giraffe subspecific groupings, including those
that are adjacent to one another, there is an almost complete lack of gene flow, suggesting that these groups are
reproductively isolated and thus constitute separate lineages. This conclusion is further supported by our mtDNAbased coalescence analysis, which indicates that groups
have been isolated from one another between 0.13 and
1.62 MY (Table 2). The demonstration of largely independent gene pools using both organellar and nuclear loci
among proximate populations constitutes one of the
strongest forms of evidence that speciation has occurred
[47]. Consequently, these arguments support viewing the
giraffe as containing multiple distinct species rather than
a single polytypic form. Reciprocal monophyly in mtDNA

sequences and nearly absolute partitioning in microsatellite data support minimally six species, corresponding to
Giraffa peralta, G. rothschildi, G. reticulata, G. tippelskirchi,
G. giraffa, and G. angolensis. Further, the Masai giraffe
might constitute more than one species, consistent with
its subdivision into populations east and west of the Rift
Valley. However, additional taxa might be defined, pending analysis of the subspecies included in taxonomic
schemes (Table 1) not sampled by our study design (e.g.,
G. c. antiquorum[10]). Finally, many of these species
appear to include multiple distinct population units that
are genetically differentiated. Despite the demonstrated
capability for long distance dispersal [3], ecological, historical and behavioral factors could have collectively
caused differentiation in the giraffe comparable to that of
highly sedentary species. Consequently, individual dispersal, even in one of the most highly vagile terrestrial vertebrates, does not preclude an as yet uncertain isolating
mechanism.

Conclusion
We have shown that, despite a high capacity for dispersal,
the giraffe exhibits extensive population genetic structure
in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Further,
our results indicate that neighbouring subspecies as well
as those that are geographically separated are essentially
reproductively isolated, suggesting that some might represent distinct species rather than a single polytypic form.
Minimally, the seven lineages that are reciprocally monophyletic in the mtDNA tree (Figure 1A) need to be considered evolutionarily significant units if not species, even
under the most conservative definition of the term,
whereas the remaining populations should be considered
independent genetic units [48,49], all needing separate
population management.
Our results have important implications with regards to
the conservation of giraffe populations. Giraffes were
once continuously distributed throughout the dry savannas of Africa, from Algeria and Morocco to South Africa
[2,11]. However, the geographic range of the giraffe has
been severely fragmented during historic times due to
increasing aridity and human population growth so that
today, giraffes are discontinuously distributed from the
Sahel to South Africa. Recent estimates indicate that
approximately 110000 giraffes exist in Africa [13], but
many populations are declining due to human pressures.
For example, severe poaching and armed conflict in
Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya reduced the number of
reticulated giraffes (G.c. reticulata) from about 27000 individuals in the 1990s to currently fewer than 3000 individuals ([13]; N. Georgiadis, unpublished results). The
evolutionarily significant units that we have uncovered
and their isolated constituent populations merit conservation and separate management. Several of these previ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/57

ously unrecognized genetic units are highly endangered,
such as the West African giraffe, numbering about only
100 individuals and restricted to a single area in Niger
[13,50]. However, the giraffe is currently listed as Lower
Risk by the IUCN Red List [51] under the assumption that
all giraffe populations are considered a single species and
therefore managed as such. Our results show that even
within well known and highly mobile species, subdivisions can exist and their lack of recognition could lead to
further endangerment or even extinction [52].

Methods
Sample collection
Skin biopsies were taken by remote system delivery of
biopsy darts. We used a CO2 powered DanInject (Børkop,
Denmark) Model JM with both in house and manufactured (Palmer Capshur, Atlanta, GA, USA) 6 mm biopsy
darts. Where observed, we attempted to sample distinct
groups within each subspecies. The presence of so many
mtDNA haplotypes within many subspecies suggests multiple matralines were sampled (see results). Subspecies
assignments for each sampled giraffe were based on geographic location and pelage following Dagg and Foster
[11]. The skin samples were placed in 0.5 ml room temperature tissue preservative buffer for preservation. Samples were transferred to the same buffer but with 0.2%
gluteraldehyde for sterilization before export/import to
the USA. The sampling performed by HDZ researchers
was performed under Kenyan permit KE911780-1, Ugandan permits UWA/PMR/RES/50 and Ugandan National
Council for Science and Technology permit #EC549,
Niger Interior Ministry Permit 731 and Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism Research/Collection Permit #597/2002. All samples were imported under USDA/
APHIS Import Permit #43686. Detailed permit information is available on request to the authors. We extracted
genomic DNA from giraffe biopsy samples using a standard phenol chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction
protocol.
Mitochondrial DNA
A 654-nucleotide fragment of mtDNA was amplified and
sequenced in 266 giraffes and one okapi (Okapia johnstoni). We amplified and sequenced this fragment using
the primers L15774 and H16498 [53]. Polymerase chain
reaction amplification was performed in a 50 μl reaction
using an MWG-Biotech Primus 96 Plus thermal cycler
with 35.7 μl sterile double-distilled water, 5 μl 10 × PCR
buffer, 5 μl of 25 mM MgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mix, 1
μl of both 25 pM/μl forward and reverse primers, 0.3 μl
Taq polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and
approximately 50 ng of genomic DNA. The PCR amplification profile was 94°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles
of 94°C for 30 s, a primer-specific annealing temperature
for 35 s, 72°C for 45 s, ending with a single extension of

72°C for 5 min. All PCRs included a negative control (no
DNA). PCR products of expected size were excised from
1% agarose/Tris/acetic acid/EDTA gels and purified using
an Ultra Clean Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Solana Beach,
CA, USA). The mitochondrial fragment was sequenced in
both forward and reverse directions on a Beckman
CEQXL2000 capillary sequencer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Sequences were aligned using
Sequencher 3.0 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
The mtDNA data matrix (n = 266 sequences) was
collapsed to 35 haplotypes using the program Collapse
v1.1 [54]. To ensure proper phylogenetic resolution and
robust support for relationships among haplotypes, the
rest of the CYTb gene was amplified and sequenced from
35 giraffes, representing each of the 35 unique haplotypes, and the okapi. Primers L14724 [55], L15162, and
H15915 [56] were used to amplify and sequence the CYTb
gene using the same protocols described above. This
sequence was then concatenated with the 654 nt fragment, resulting in an alignment length of 1709 nt (with
okapi) or 1707 nt (without okapi). These sequences were
deposited in GenBank (accession numbers EU088317–
EU88352).
Phylogenetic relationships among the 35 giraffe haplotypes (1709 nt) were estimated using maximum parsimony (equally weighted) (MP), maximum likelihood
(ML), and minimum evolution (ME) methods. The
HKY85+I+G model of DNA substitution was selected [57]
and used in ML and ME analyses that included only giraffe
haplotypes. For analyses that included the okapi, the
HKY85 (without accounting for site heterogeneity) model
was used. Gaps (insertions/deletions) were coded as a
fifth base in MP analyses. Maximum parsimony and ME
analyses were executed in PAUP* 4.0b10 [58]. For these
analyses, heuristic searches were performed using 100
random sequence additions, with one tree held at each
step during stepwise addition, tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping, steepest descent option not in
effect, no upper bound for MaxTrees, and MulTrees
option in effect. Maximum likelihood analyses were conducted with TREEFINDER [59] and parameters of the
HKY85+I+G or HKY85 model were estimated along with
the tree topology. For each phylogenetic method, robustness of clades was assessed using 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. The okapi sequence was used to root the
phylogenies of the giraffe haplotypes. However, due to the
large sequence divergence between giraffe and okapi (and
therefore the potential for signal saturation), phylogenetic
trees including only giraffe haplotypes were also midpoint
rooted. Regardless of rooting method or optimality criterion used, clades with a ≥ 80% bootstrap value were maintained across all analyses (Figure 1A and Additional files
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

Minimum-spanning network between haplotypes
We also constructed a minimum-spanning network of
absolute distances between control region haplotypes
using the molecular-variance parsimony algorithm as
implemented in Arlequin v3.1 [20].
Genetic structure and diversity
Population structure was deduced with an analysis of
molecular variance (AMOVA) using Arlequin V3.1 [20].
In order to identify groups of populations based on
genetic differences, we grouped sampling localities to
maximise the among-group variance component (Φct).
Haplotype and nucleotide diversity indices were calculated with Arlequin V3.1 using mtDNA control region
data.
Estimation of divergence times using MDIV [19]
We generated maximum likelihood estimates of θ, twice
the effective female population size (Nfe) times the mutation rate (u); T, the divergence time between two populations scaled by population size; and M, the gene
migration rate between the two populations, also scaled
by population size. We assumed uniform prior distributions and applied an HKY model of mutation [60] to
allow for the possibility of multiple mutations per site. We
ran Markov chains of 4000000 cycles preceded by a
"burn-in" period of 500000 cycles for each pairwise population comparison, set maximum values for T and M of
10 and 30, respectively, and ran the analysis three times
for each population comparison using different random
seeds. We calculated divergence time (t) using the formula
t = T *θ/(2u)*g, where T and θ are generated by the program, u is the mutation rate, and g is generation time in
years. We calculated u as 2*μ*k, where μ is the mutation
rate per nucleotide and k is the length of the sequence.
Given the higher mutation rate found in the control
region relative to the cytochrome b gene, we used a range
of estimated mutation rates for control region sequence
that span values found previously in other large mammal
species. These included 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 substitutions/
site/MY, and a generation time of 4 years, which is the
approximate age of first breeding for giraffes [38].
Microsatellite amplification/genotyping
We amplified 13 published [22] and one novel (see Additional file 18) giraffe-specific microsatellite loci to generate multilocus genotypes for the 381 individuals. We
performed the PCR amplification in 25 μl reaction volumes using an ABI 480 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer; Foster City, CA, USA) with approximately 50 ng of genomic
DNA as template. Final amplification conditions consisted of 12.5 pmol unlabelled reverse primer, 12.5 pmol
fluorescently labeled forward primer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200
μM each dNTP, and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega; Madison, WI, USA). The thermal profile for

Page 9 of 13

BMC Biology 2007, 5:57

PCR amplification was 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35
cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 30 s, a annealing at
primer-specific temperature for 30 s, and elongated at
72°C for 30 s, ending with a single extension of 72°C for
10 min. We separated the PCR products on either a 7%
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresed on an ABI 377 or
through POP4 capillary buffer electrophoresed on an ABI
3100 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc; Foster City,
CA, USA). We assigned allele fragment lengths relative to
the GeneScan-500 (TAMRA; Applied Biosystems, Inc;
Foster City, CA, USA) size standard using the ABI GeneScan software program. We checked and corrected the data
set for errors using MICRO-CHECKER 2.2.3 [61] and MSA
4.00 [62].
Microsatellite analysis
Allelic diversity, and expected (He) and observed (Ho) heterozygosity were calculated using the program GENALEX
[63]. Each locus was tested for deviation from HardyWeinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium with
other loci (p < 0.05) using the program Genepop [64].
Bonferroni corrections to significance values [65] were
applied to account for multiple tests (see Additional files
12A and 12B).
Allele-sharing neighbour-joining network
We generated the neighbor-joining network tree using 14locus genotypes of 381 individuals. The network was created using the allele-sharing distance Ds [66] and the program POPULATIONS v1.2.28 [67].
Bayesian clustering analysis
We used the program STRUCTURE [23] to infer genetic
population structure using genotypes from 14 microsatellite loci of 381 individuals. All individuals were combined
into one dataset for analysis, without any a priori population assignments and admixture was allowed. We evaluated K values, the number of assumed populations, from
1–16 using a burn-in of 50000 iterations followed by
500000 iterations for each value of K. Each value of K was
run a minimum of three times to evaluate stability (see
Additional file 19). We then calculated the posterior probability of population assignment to one of the six subspecies using initial assignments based on the a priori K = 13
cluster proportion results, with the migration parameter
set to γ = 0.1 (see Additional file 13A). We also utilized the
program GENECLASS2 [68] for a comparative estimate of
population assignments using the same K = 13 cluster proportion results for initial population assignments. We
used the Rannala and Mountain [69] Bayesian assignment
method with the simulation method of Paetkau [70] and
an assignment threshold level of 0.05 (see Additional file
13B).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/57

Population differentiation and inbreeding coefficients
We calculated pairwise Fst values using microsatellite
results for population comparisons at the subspecies,
population and sampling site levels using the program
Fstat [71] (see Additional file 16A). Significant values of
Fst were determined using the G test in Fstat (α = 0.05).
We also calculated Nei's genetic distance [72] for population comparisons at the subspecies level (GENALEX [63])
(see Additional file 16B). Population inbreeding
coefficients (Fis) were also calculated using Fstat and
significant values determined using α = 0.05 (see
Additional file 20).
Migration-rate estimation
Recent migration rates between the six giraffe subspecies
were estimated using a Bayesian MCMC analysis of microsatellite genotypes (BayesAss 1.3 [73]). Individuals were
preassigned to the six subspecies based on sampling location. We used 3000000 iterations, a sampling frequency
of 2000, a burn-in length of 999999 iterations, and delta
values for allele frequency, migration rate and level of
inbreeding of 0.15 (see Additional file 17).
Isolation by distance
We tested for isolation by distance between subspecies,
populations and sample locations using a comparison of
genetic distance (Fst/(1-Fst)) with geographic distance,
applying the Mantel test in GENALEX [63] (999 permutations, significance level p < 0.01) (see Additional file 21).
Molecular analysis of variance – microsatellites
We calculated molecular analysis of variance (AMOVA)
for microsatellite data at the subspecies (Q = 6) and population (Q = 10) levels (999 permutations) using the program GENALEX [63] (see Additional file 22).
