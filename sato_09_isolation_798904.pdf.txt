Abstract
Imported animals, especially those from developing countries, may constitute a potential hazard to
native animals and to public health. In this study, a new flock of lesser flamingos imported from
Tanzania to Hiroshima Zoological Park were screened for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative
bacteria, integrons and antimicrobial resistance genes. Thirty-seven Gram-negative bacterial
isolates were obtained from the flamingos. Seven isolates (18.9%) showed multidrug resistance
phenotypes, the most common being against: ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole and nalidixic acid. Molecular analyses identified class 1 and class 2 integrons, βlactamase-encoding genes, blaTEM-1 and blaCTX-M-2 and the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
genes, qnrS and qnrB. This study highlights the role of animal importation in the dissemination of
multidrug-resistant bacteria, integrons and antimicrobial resistance genes from one country to
another.

Findings
The introduction of an exotic pathogen via imported animals has the potential to impact on all native animal species and on human health. Although all imported animals
have to be certified as healthy and free from infectious and
contagious diseases, these animals can act as carriers and
reservoirs for many pathogenic and non-pathogenic
microorganisms [1]. Furthermore, many animals undergo
extreme migration patterns and this, combined with the
translocation of animals, especially wild and zoo animals,
may thus result in the spread of imported zoonoses from
one country to another [2].

Currently, essential and life-saving antibiotics are becoming less effective, with fewer alternatives available for
treatment [3,4]. The genes for resistance traits can be
transferred among bacteria of different taxonomic and
ecological groups. The increasing occurrence of antibioticresistant microorganisms has fueled interest in the genetics and mechanisms of resistance evolved by bacteria to
counteract the effect of antimicrobial agents. The fact that
resistance genes do not respect phylogenetic, ecological or
geographical boundaries implies that antimicrobial use
and the resulting resistance in one ecological niche may
have consequences for the resistance situation in another
niche [1].

The scientific data on the role of imported animals in the
spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and resistance genes from one country to another is very limited.
Also, little is known about the molecular basis of resistance in MDR bacteria isolated from imported animals,
therefore, this study was conducted to detect and characterize the antimicrobial resistance genes in MDR Gramnegative bacteria isolated from an imported flock of flamingos at Hiroshima Zoological Park, Japan.
The imported flock of lesser flamingos (Phoeniconaias
minor) consists of 20 birds. They were free-living wild
birds in Tanzania. The lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias
minor) is the most abundant of all flamingos. It breeds
mainly in the Rift Valley lakes of East Africa in Ethiopia,
Kenya and Tanzania and covers a much broader geographical range during the non-breeding season (including sub-Saharan regions, the Arabian peninsula and parts
of Asia) [5]. They were transported by airplane through
the following pathway: Tanzania-Netherland-Osaka
(Japan) airports. Then, they were overland transported
from Osaka to Asa Zoological Park, Hiroshima, Japan.
This flock arrived at Hiroshima City Asa Zoological Park,
Hiroshima, Japan on 28th December 2006 and sampling
was made on the next morning. The imported flamingos
were kept in the quarantine space and isolated from other
animals. All feed, mat, manure, etc. were completely isolated from other areas. No antimicrobials were given to
the flamingos before sampling. A total of 14 swabs (8
fecal and 6 bathing water swabs) were randomly taken
from a recently imported flock of lesser flamingo from
Tanzania. The fecal swabs were taken instead of cloacal
swabs to avoid the direct handling of the birds. The swabs
were immersed in buffered peptone water and dispatched
immediately at 4°C to the laboratory where bacterial isolation was performed within 24 h. The isolates were isolated and identified using conventional techniques [6]
and results were confirmed, where necessary, by the API
20E system (BioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France). A total
of 37 Gram-negative bacterial isolates were recovered
from lesser flamingos. Biochemical identification showed
that the most prevalent species were Escherichia coli 18
(48.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (10.8%),
Edwardsiella tarda 3 (8.1%), Proteus mirabilis 3 (8.1%), Citrobacter koseri 2 (5.4%), and single isolates (2.7%) of Citrobacter youngae, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae.
The antimicrobial sensitivity phenotypes of recovered
bacteria were determined using a Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay according to the standards and interpretive criteria described by CLSI [7]. The antimicrobial diffusion
disk tests showed that 7 of the bacterial isolates (18.9%)
(4 isolates of E. coli and a single isolate of C. youngae, E.

http://www.actavetscand.com/content/51/1/46

cloacae and S. enterica subsp.arizonae) showed multidrug
resistance phenotypes to three or more antimicrobial
agents. The most common resistance phenotypes were
against: ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and nalidixic acid. Similar resistance phenotypes have been previously recorded for
strains of E. coli isolated from wild animals in Portugal,
from free-living Canada geese in Georgia and North Carolina (USA) and from black-headed gulls in the Czech
Republic [8-10]. More recently, we have reported multiple
resistance phenotypes in many Gram-negative bacteria
isolated from zoo animals at Hiroshima Zoological Park
[11]. Of note, Gram-negative bacteria with high level of
resistance especially to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were previously isolated from urinary tract
infections in pregnant women from Tanzania [12]. In
addition, from the public health point of view, three isolates showed resistance phenotypes to several clinicallyimportant extended-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics such as
cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone and aztreonam [4].
Previously, in Japan, a study showed that vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE) isolated from imported chickens could contribute to the colonization of VRE in the
intestines of healthy Japanese people who had ingested
uncooked chickens [13]. Also, in Japan, pet birds
imported from tropical countries were found to carry
MDR bacteria (they are frequently treated with antibiotics) [14]. Therefore, the transmission of non-pathogenic
multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria by imported animals
is also important because they can serve as a reservoir for
resistance genes that may be transferred to pathogens [1].
Integrons are genetic elements that can integrate gene cassettes, usually antibiotic resistance genes, by site-specific
recombination [15]. The class 1 integron primers, 5'-CS
and 3'-CS, which amplify the region between the 5'-conserved segment (5'-CS) and 3'-CS of class 1 integrons,
were used as previously described (Table 1) [11]. Also, for
the detection of class 2 integrons, PCR was performed
with the primer pair, hep74 and hep51, specific to the
conserved regions of the class 2 integrons, as described
previously (Table 1) [11]. PCR-screening results detected
class 1 integrons in two isolates of E. coli and one isolate
of S. enterica subsp.arizonae (Table 2). Although, S. enterica subsp.arizonae seldom infects humans, a fatal case of
gastroenteritis due to S. enterica subsp.arizonae has been
reported in a 3-month-old child presented to the Emergency Unit in New Delhi, India [16]. DNA-sequencing
results for the inserted gene cassettes within class 1 integrons identified only one gene cassette of dihydrofolate
reductase, dfrA7, which confers resistance to trimethoprim. It is noteworthy that class 1 integrons with different
gene cassettes (dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA12, dfrA15 dfrA17 and
aadA1, aadA2, aadA5) were previously reported from zoo
animals at Hiroshima Zoological Park [11]. Class 1 inte-

Plasmid-mediated quiniolone resistance

grons harboring aadA1 have been previously identified in
E. coli isolated from free-living Canada geese in Georgia
and North Carolina (USA) and black-headed gulls in the
Czech Republic [8,10]. On the other hand, class 2 integron with a fragment size of 1581 bp was identified in a
single isolate of E. coli. This class 2 integron was identical
to that of Tn1826, and contained sat2 and aadA1 gene cassettes (Table 2) [17]. Notably, our group recently identified a class 2 integron carrying the three classical gene
cassettes, dfrA1, sat2 and aadA1, in three E. coli strains isolated from wild birds, horned owl and white pelican
housed at Hiroshima Zoological Park, Japan [11].
Production of β-lactamases is the main mechanism of
resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. Many different β-lactamases have been described, but

TEM-, SHV-, OXA-, CMY- and CTX-M-β-lactamases are the
most predominant in Gram-negative bacteria [4]. The
bacterial isolates were tested for TEM-, SHV-, CTX-M-,
OXA- and CMY-β-lactamase-encoding genes by PCR using
universal primers for the TEM, SHV, OXA, CTX-M and
CMY families, as described previously (Table 1) [11].
PCR- and DNA-sequencing screening identified blaTEM-1,
in three E. coli isolates (Table 2). It is well known that
blaTEM-1 is a narrow-spectrum β-lactamase gene, which
confers resistance against penicillins and first-generation
cephalosporins [4]. TEM-β-lactamase has been previously
detected in E. coli isolated from wild animals in Portugal
[9] and from free-living Canada geese in Georgia and
North Carolina (USA) and black-headed gulls in the
Czech Republic [8,10]. In this study, an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) encoding gene, blaCTX-M-2, was

Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance is of great concern since these resistance determinants are potentially
spread among bacteria due to plasmid mobility. Until
now, three main types of qnr gene have been identified:
qnrA, qnrB and qnrS [18,19]. Multiplex PCR amplification
was used for screening of plasmid-mediated quinolone
resistance genes, qnrA, qnrB and qnrS as described previously (Table 1) [19]. PCR-screening and DNA-sequeencing results identified qnrS and qnrB in single isolates of C.
youngae and E. coli, respectively (Table 2). In Japan, we
previously identified six qnrB genes in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, C. freundii, P. mirabilis and P. fluorescence
from zoo reptiles and falcons, and four qnrS genes in three
isolates of E. coli and one isolate of E. cloacae from reptiles,
red fox and snowy owl [11].
Contact with animals in zoological parks provides opportunities for entertainment and education regarding animals and animal husbandry; however, inadequate
understanding of disease transmission and animal behavior can lead to infectious diseases and other health problems among visitors, especially children [20]. Regular
training and education of animal care-takers and visitors
by zoological parks are prerequisites to avoid exposure to
these resistance genes. The National Association of State
Public Health Veterinarians, Inc. (NASPHV) has provided
standardized recommendations for public health officials, veterinarians, animal venue operators, animal

exhibitors, visitors to animal venues and exhibits, and
others concerned with disease-control and with minimizing risks associated with animals in public settings [20].
Also, we think that the most important measure to prevent introduction of antimicrobial resistance genes
through exotic bacteria either to Japan or to any other
country is to screen the imported animal flocks (either
livestock or wildlife animals) for the presence of resistance
genes in the quarantine. No flocks should be approved to
enter the country if the screening results showed that they
harbored of any clinically important resistance genes. In
conclusion, theoretically, wild animals should never have
been exposed to antibiotics; however, this study emphasizes the potential risk of imported zoo animals as a
source and reservoir of MDR bacteria. It highlights their
potential role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance
genes from one country to another. Although, the source
of resistance genes in the imported flamingos is unknown,
the possibility remains that flamingos may become colonized with resistant bacteria during transit (in a possible
storage facility in Tanzania, in vehicles, in the Netherlands, or during air transport). Finally, more research is
needed to better understand the role of imported wild
birds in transmission of resistance genes and its implications for public health.
