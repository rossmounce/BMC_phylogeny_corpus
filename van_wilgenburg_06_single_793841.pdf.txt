Abstract
The haplodiploid sex determining mechanism in Hymenoptera (males are haploid, females are
diploid) has played an important role in the evolution of this insect order. In Hymenoptera sex is
usually determined by a single locus, heterozygotes are female and hemizygotes are male. Under
inbreeding, homozygous diploid and sterile males occur which form a genetic burden for a
population. We review life history and genetical traits that may overcome the disadvantages of
single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD). Behavioural adaptations to avoid matings
between relatives include active dispersal from natal patches and mating preferences for nonrelatives. In non-social species, temporal and spatial segregation of male and female offspring
reduces the burden of sl-CSD. In social species, diploid males are produced at the expense of
workers and female reproductives. In some social species, diploid males and diploid male producing
queens are killed by workers. Diploid male production may have played a role in the evolution or
maintenance of polygyny (multiple queens) and polyandry (multiple mating). Some forms of
thelytoky (parthenogenetic female production) increase homozygosity and are therefore
incompatible with sl-CSD. We discuss a number of hypothetical adaptations to sl-CSD which
should be considered in future studies of this insect order.

Introduction
The insect order Hymenoptera comprises over 200,000
species of ants, bees, wasps and sawflies. All members
have haplodiploid sex determination; males are haploid
(one chromosome set) and females are diploid (two chromosome sets). Arrhenotoky is the most common mode of
reproduction; males develop parthenogenetically from
unfertilised eggs and females from fertilised eggs. Arrhenotokous females typically have control over fertilisation
by releasing sperm to an egg upon oviposition, and can

facultatively adjust the sex ratio of their progeny. In thelytokous species diploid females develop parthenogenetically from unfertilised eggs and there are no males [1,2].
Thelytoky has independently arisen in several groups [3].
Sex determination in haplodiploids involves no heteromorphic sex chromosomes, thus the only difference
between males and females is the number of chromosome
sets. Several different genetic mechanisms of sex determination occur in Hymenoptera. One mechanism that has

been known for over 60 years is single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD, [4,5]). Under sl-CSD, the
sex of an individual depends on the allelic composition at
a single locus. Hemizygous haploid individuals are male
and diploid individuals are female when heterozygous,
but male when homozygous. Thus, in contrast to the
standard arrhenotokous situation of haploid males from
unfertilized eggs, some males can be diploid and those
males are of biparental origin. These males are typically
sterile [6,7] and sometimes have reduced viability [5,810]. In addition, they can produce diploid sperm which
leads to triploid (sterile) offspring [6]. In a number of
cases diploid males can be morphologically distinguished
by their size, weight or the density of wing microchaetae.
The csd gene has recently been cloned and sequenced from
the honey bee [11], but its exact mode of action in sex

determination is not yet understood [12]. Several
attempts to isolate the csd gene from other Hymenoptera
have to date been unsuccessful. Very little is known about
the genetic regulation of sex determination in species
without CSD. Although several models have been proposed, they have little empirical support [3,13,14]). In
this paper, we will not review the existing evidence for
these models again, but instead we consider a number of
life history and genetical aspects that are relevant to single
locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD).
Diploid male production (DMP) in Hymenoptera may
have a number of important evolutionary consequences.
Many authors have considered one or more aspects of
DMP for the population dynamics, including colonisation ability [15], population growth [16-20], sex allocation and mating structures [8,21,22]; the evolution of

tion through haploid males [26-29]. However, sl-CSD can
be particularly detrimental under inbreeding conditions
because it produces proportionally more homozygotes
(diploid males) than under outbreeding. Under sl-CSD,
matched matings (i.e. when the female and male partners
share a similar sex allele [30]) result in broods in which 50
percent of fertilised eggs develop into diploid males. Sibmatings increase the chance of such matched matings.

1 For

Nasonia vitripennis [40] and Diplolepis rosae [99] uniparental
diploid males have been found that apparently arose by mutation

Because diploid males are often infertile or less viable they
impose a genetic load on populations. Hence, there will
be frequency-dependent selection on sex alleles where
rare alleles in a population will have a selective advantage.
The number of alleles at the sex locus has been reported to
vary from 9 up to 86 [8]. In a random mating population,
the probability of matched mating (defined as a mating
between individuals carrying an identical sex allele) will
be 2/k [8], where k is the effective number of sex alleles. A
proportion of 1/k of the diploid individuals are thus
expected to be homozygous males. In recent years more
species of different groups have been investigated for the
presence or absence of sl-CSD. In addition, since Cook
and Crozier's [8] overview, several authors have addressed
one or more consequences of sl-CSD for the biology of
different hymenopteran groups. Moreover, some of the
commonly accepted consequences of sl-CSD were
recently challenged by a new study of Cowan and Stahlhut
[31]. In this paper we collate the new data. The purposes
of our paper are: (1) to extend and update previous overviews on the distribution of sl-CSD in the Hymenoptera,
(2) to consider some life history traits that may reduce the
load of DMP, (3) to explore what alternative mechanisms,
both at the genetic and population biological level, may
have evolved to minimise the costs of DMP and finally (4)

to point out a number of priority research topics that are,
in our opinion, crucial for a full understanding of the
many genetical, ecological and evolutionary aspects of slCSD. We hope that this review will highlight the key areas
of contention in this topic, and stimulates further
research.

Taxonomic distribution of CSD
Biologists have used different types of evidence for the
presence of sl-CSD. In increasing order of confidence level
they can be ranked as follows: 1) post-hoc explanations
for exceptionally high-male biased sex ratios in cultures or
field surveys, 2) on the basis of the verification of male
diploidy through cytological (chromosome number),
morphological (size, weight, density of wing microchaetae), genetical (microsatellites) or electrophoretical
(allozymes) methods, 3) on the basis of sex ratios in
inbreeding experiments that are in accordance with predictions under sl-CSD, 4) a combination of 2 and 3, and
5) linkage mapping of the sex locus and/or its molecular
characterization. sl-CSD has now been demonstrated in
over 60 species of Hymenoptera, including sawflies (Symphyta), parasitoid wasps (Apocrita; Parasitica), and ants,
bees and wasps (Apocrita; Aculeata) [3,7,8,32,33]. Tables
1 and 2 summarise the non-social and social Hymenoptera respectively for which sl-CSD has been supposed to
be present. They expand the list of species published by
Stouthamer et al. [7], Cook [3] and Periquet et al. [34] by
two-fold, but all added species belong to previously investigated groups.
The presence of members with sl-CSD in each major
hymenopteran subgroup has led to the suggestion that slCSD is the ancestral mode of sex determination in the
Hymenoptera [3,35]. However, this conclusion seems
premature since our knowledge of the phylogenetic distribution of sl-CSD is still incomplete. Some recent studies
in the parasitoid family Braconidae show that sl-CSD
occurs in particular subfamilies while it is absent in
closely related ones (compare Tables 1 and 3). Even more
striking is the presence of species with and without sl-CSD
within one genus: Cotesia[7,20]. This suggests that shifts
between sl-CSD and alternative mode(s) of sex determination may easily occur [36-38]. Another notable conclusion from comparing Tables 1 and 3 is the apparent
absence of non-CSD species in the social Hymenoptera
(see also below). Clearly, there is a need for further testing
in the Hymenoptera before general conclusions can be
made about the phylogenetic distribution of sl-CSD.
Importantly, there are some situations where the relation
between diploid males and CSD is unclear. For example,
diploid males have been reported from hybridization of
two subspecies of fig wasps [39]. In Nasonia vitripennis
diploid males have been found to occur spontaneously in

laboratory cultures [40,41]. They are not the result of slCSD, are fully fertile and produce diploid sperm. These
cases fall outside the scope of this paper.

Life history aspects of CSD
Non Social Hymenoptera
Table 1 summarizes the non-social Hymenoptera in
which sl-CSD is proposed to be the sex determining mechanism. Since many different methods have been used to
infer the presence of sl-CSD we have graded all the species
according to the five categories of increasing confidence
level of evidence that were distinguished in the previous
section. Apart from parent-offspring matings, which are
probably extremely rare in nature, the highest risk of producing diploid males is in sib matings. Mating in gregarious parasitoid species (i.e. two or more offspring
emerging from one host) generally occurs among individuals emerging from a single host before the females disperse [42]. Gregariousness may therefore be in conflict
with sl-CSD. The three Bracon species in Table 1 seem to
violate this prediction. In B. hebetor sex ratios have been
reported to be female-biased [21,43]. Nevertheless, sib
mating in B. hebetor is rare for a number of reasons.
Females exhibit a pre-mating refractory period during
which dispersal takes place [44-46], they have a mating
preference for males that emerged from a different host
[45], and males aggregate in leks that attract spermdepleted females. A pre-mating refractory period of 4 to 5
hours after emergence has also been found in B. brevicornis
[47]. In the only other gregarious species in Table 1,
Cotesia glomerata, 50 to 100 per cent of the females and,
approximately, 30 per cent of the males disperse immediately after emergence from their natal patch. This results in
only a minority of 25 per cent of females mating with sib
males in the field [20]. Clearly, these behaviours promote
an outcrossing mating system.

In solitary parasitoid species (i.e. only one offspring
emerging from a host) and sawflies the probability of sibs
meeting each other in the field will depend on their temporal and spatial distribution. Oviposition in solitary species is a sequential process, where the searching time for
oviposition sites or hosts causes a time delay between successive ovipositions. Additionally, differences in quality
of sites and hosts and differences in microclimate induce
further desynchronisation of development and emergence
time. This, together with the fact that all solitary species in
Table 1 are good dispersers with both sexes fully winged,
may contribute considerably to an outbreeding mating
structure. However, apart from these general mechanisms
inherent to the solitary life cycle, there may be other
aspects that further reduce the probability of sib mating.
Some species in Table 1 like Athalia rosae and Microplitis
croceiceps initially produce female biased sex ratios, but lay

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/1

male biased sex ratios later on in life [48,49], causing a
further temporal segregation of female and male sibs. A
similar effect results from the tendency of Diadegma species to lay male eggs in young, small hosts and female eggs
in older and larger hosts [50,51]. Other species in Table 1
divide their total egg complement over many host patches
thereby creating a spatial segregation of offspring. In
Neodiprion nigroscutum, Bathyplectes curculionis and
Diadromus pulchellus, for example, this results from the fact
that their hosts occur in low numbers per patch [52-54].
Comparing the behaviour of thelytokous and arrhenotokous forms of V. canescens Thiel et. al. [55] recently found
strong indications that the oviposition behaviour of the
arrhenotokous form is specifically adapted to promote
outbreeding.
Similarly to gregarious parasitoids, the offspring of nest
building wasps also are likely to meet sibs early in life.
Females of the hunting wasp Euodynerus foraminatus build
nests in which they store prey and lay eggs. Males develop
faster than females and up to 66 per cent of the females in
a nest mate with their brothers [56,57]; this species
undoubtedly has sl-CSD. However, Cowan and Stahlhut
[31] recently have shown that the diploid males in E.
foraminatus are normally fertile and able to transmit their
genes to their daughters. It seems that diploidy does not
entail many costs in these males. This case appears
unique, but shows that one needs to be cautious in generalising that diploid males produced by CSD are an evolutionary dead end. For another cavity nesting Vespid, the
potter wasp Ancistrocerus antilope, the other Vespoidea in
Table 1, extremely high levels (>90 per cent) of inbreeding
have been found in natural populations [58]. The same
study also reported that around 25 per cent of the males
collected from trap nests in the field were diploid. If CSD
is the mechanism causing this diploidy, the two findings
could point to a similar 'immunity for male diploidy' as
in E. foraminatus.
It must be emphasised that for none of the solitary species
in Table 1 life histories or mating and oviposition behaviour have been studied with special reference to CSD. For
example, little is known about avoidance of sib mating in
solitary parasitoid species in general, simply because it
remains relatively uninvestigated. Moreover, although the
mechanisms promoting sib mating avoidance in the gregarious Bracon case are likely adaptations to CSD, the
aforementioned mechanisms that contribute to temporal
or spatial segregation of sibs in solitary species are not
necessarily specific adaptations to CSD. Laying small
clutches, for example, may serve as a bet-hedging strategy
in the first place, while laying male eggs in small hosts a
matter of optimal host use. The Cotesia genus, in which
species with and without CSD occur, could provide a
good system to study the adaptive significance of life his-

tory traits and behaviour with respect to CSD. The example of E. foraminatus shows that asking if and how CSD
species reduce the probability of matched matings may
lead to surprising new findings.
Social Hymenoptera
Diploid males have now been detected in more than 40
species of ants, bees and social wasps. Although this study
doubles the number of cases compared to previous
reviews [3,7,34], contrary to non-social Hymenoptera, slCSD has been confirmed only for a small number of
social Hymenoptera (Table 2). This may be attributed to
difficulties of breeding social hymenopterans in the laboratory. The proportion of diploid males that have been
found among the progeny of social Hymenoptera can be
remarkably high, indicating either high levels of inbreeding or small variation in the sex determination locus. For
the primitively social wasp Liostenogaster flavolineata, for
example, Strassmann et al. [59] found 11 of 71 males to
be diploid and in some Formica ant species (F. aquilona, F.
rufa and F. polyctena) 10 per cent of all males are diploid
[60]. In the primitive eusocial bee Hallictus poeyi proportions of diploids that are male are estimated to range from
9.1 to 50 per cent [61]. Populations may differ significantly in their DMP. For example, Roubic et al. [23] found
that, within populations of the colonial genera Euglossa
and Eulaema of Euglossine bees in Panama, an estimated
12–100 per cent of all males are diploid, yet Takahashi et
al. [62] found almost no diploid males within Brazilian
populations of Euglossine bees [63].

In social hymenoptera, diploid males are produced at the
expense of workers or female reproductives and are therefore expected to impose severe disadvantages for colony
growth and survival. Plowright and Pallett [17], for example, found that colonies of the bumble bee Bombus atratus
in which 50 per cent of the diploid progeny were male
grew significantly slower than colonies producing only
workers. Also, incipient monogynous colonies (bearing a
single reproductive queen) of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta
with DMP have a significantly slower colony growth and
exhibit higher mortality than those that do not produce
diploid males [18]. While diploid males are often sterile,
diploid males of Polistes dominules wasps are capable of
mating and produce triploid offspring. In this species
DMP may thus result in a delayed fitness cost for two generations [64].
A number of traits appear to have evolved in social
Hymenoptera that reduce the risk of sib-mating. Additionally, there are several other traits that may diminish
the costs of DMP. In the following section an overview of
these traits is presented for various species known to produce diploid males.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/1

Avoidance of sib-matings
Social Hymenoptera show several behavioural and morphological traits that reduce the probability of mating
amongst siblings and most species have inbreeding levels
not significantly different from zero [65]. Most species
avoid inbreeding by dispersal of both sexes, and males
and females will often leave the nest at different times
[66,67]. Both sexes of Apis and Melipona bees, for example,
are known to fly great distances in order to mate in population-wide mating swarms [68]. Alternative sexual dispersal behaviour is found in the ants Harpagoxenus
sublaevis and Doronomyrmex kutteri. In these species, the
males leave their natal nest and disperse to find unmated
queens, while the females walk only a short way from the
nest to exhibit a so-called "female calling" behaviour to
attract mates [69,70]. Workers of a number of Bombus species reduce the risk of inbreeding by actively removing
young males from the colony, thereby preventing them
from mating with their own sisters. Males are attacked
when they are 4–5 days old and eventually killed if they
do not leave the colony [17]. In the primitively social bee
Lasioglossum zephyrum, the male bees recognise and avoid
mating female kin through olfactory signals [71].
Removal of diploid male larvae
Some social Hymenoptera remove diploid males in an
early stage, thereby avoiding rearing costs [72]. Woyke
[73] showed that diploid male larvae of the honeybee Apis
mellifera are removed and cannibalised almost immediately after hatching. The hydrocarbon patterns of diploid
male larvae of A. mellifera differ from those of diploid
worker and haploid drone larvae and may be used by
workers to distinguish between the three types of larvae
[74]. The diploid males of another honeybee, A. cerana are
also removed, one day after hatching [75]. In the African
swarm-founding wasp Polybiodes tabidus and Formica ants,
diploid males are only detected at times when the colony
produces sexual offspring, suggesting that in non-sexual
brood males are eliminated at early developmental stages
[60,76].
Removal of diploid male-producing queens
In contrast with the larvae of the honeybee, which are situated in open cells, the larvae of Melipona bees are reared
in sealed cells. Melipona bees are therefore not able to
detect and remove diploid males. Diploid males of M.
quadrifasciata have normal survival as immatures [77].
However, when a M. quadrifasciata queen produces diploid males, the workers kill the queen and rear a replacement [78].
Polyandry and polygyny
If all queens in a population of social Hymenoptera are
singly mated, under random mating, a number of females
within the population will mate with a male sharing their

Frontiers in Zoology 2006, 3:1

sex allele and produce diploid progeny of which half will
be males. If females mate with multiple males, more
females within the population will produce diploid
males, but the proportion of males among the diploid
progeny per female will be lower. Thus, in polyandrous
populations, although the absolute proportion of diploid
males will be the same, the variance in DMP among colonies is reduced [79].
The load hypothesis predicts that the load of diploid
males will select for monandry or polyandry depending
on the relationship between DMP and female fitness
[16,78-80]. In case of a linear relationship between DMP
and female fitness, sl-CSD in not expected to select for
polyandry, but under some non-linear relationships it
may. Antolin and colleagues [22], for example, showed
theoretically that multiple mating reduces genetic load if
populations contain only few sex alleles. In social
hymenoptera several factors influencing the relationship
between DMP and a queen's fitness, like the timing of the
removal of diploid males [78] and the timing of sexual
production during colony growth [16] have been suggested to promote polyandry. The load hypothesis predicts selection for polyandry when, for example, colonies
of social Hymenoptera can tolerate moderate, but not
high frequencies of diploid males, because high levels of
diploid males would almost always result in the death of
a colony. As a result, the fitness of multiple mated queens
within colonies that produce, for example, 25 per cent
diploid males could be higher than the average of single
mated queens producing 50 per cent or 0 per cent diploid
males. At this moment there is, however, no empirical evidence that polyandry has specifically evolved in response
to DMP.
In polygynous colonies, the DMP by some queens can be
buffered by the presence of workers produced by other
queens in the nest. In addition, polygynous colonies often
reproduce by fission or budding, and may therefore skip
the vulnerable early exponential phase of colony growth,
in which the load of diploid males might be fatal [16].
Around 1940, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta was introduced
from South-America to North-America; diploid males are
far more common in the introduced population than in
the native populations, probably due to loss of sex alleles
[15,81]. In the introduced range, several polygynous populations have apparently evolved independently in only a
few decades from the originally monogynous founder
population. While diploid males are very common in
polygynous colonies, they are absent in monogynous colonies [18]. Ross and Fletcher [18] showed that monogynous colonies which adopted queens rear diploid males
in the laboratory and the absence of diploid males in
monogynous colonies in the field can thus not be
explained by elimination of diploid males at early stages.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/1

This suggests that monogynous incipient colonies of S.
invicta producing diploid males do not survive [82]. While
DMP producing queens are likely to benefit greatly from
joining a multi-queen colony, it is unclear what role DMP
has had in the evolution or maintenance of polygyny in
the imported fire ant [18,81].
The load hypothesis predicts an association between
monogyny and monandry when colonies with moderate
frequencies of diploid males have high mortality [60].
Pamilo et al [60] investigated this hypothesis in several
Formica ant species. In accordance with the theory up to
10 per cent of all males are diploid in species of Formica
ant with highly polygynous colonies (F. aquilona, F. truncorum and F. polyctena), while no diploid males were
found in two mainly monandrous/monogynous species
(F. exsecta and F. pratensis). However, in three other
monogynous/weakly polygynous species (F. rufa, F. lugubris, F. truncorum) diploid males were found in fairly high
frequencies, which indicates that diploid males are not
necessarily an unbearable load.
Social species without DMP
Unlike the non-social Hymenoptera there are no social
Hymenoptera species for which the presence of sl-CSD
has been refuted. Yet, there are some social Hymenopteran species known to inbreed consistently. Because
inbreeding should result in DMP and no diploid males
have yet been found in these species, these species are
likely candidates for alternative mechanisms of sex determination. In the Japanese ant Technomyrmex alpibes, for
example, incipient colonies produce wingless sexuals that
inbreed for several generations [83]. For another Japanese
ant, the harvesting ant, Messor aciculatus, genetic data
revealed that mating swarms are drawn from very few colonies [84]. In the ant species Cardiocondyla batesii both
sexes are flightless and Schrempf et al. [85] estimated that
83 per cent of the matings are between brothers and sisters. The social parasitic ants of the genus Myrmoxenus also
have high levels of inbreeding, mating almost always
occurs within the nest prior to dispersal [86].

Genetical aspects of sl-CSD
Evolution of thelytoky
Thelytokous species consist of only females that produce
daughters parthenogenetically. Thelytoky occurs in all
major groups of Hymenoptera, although it appears to be
particularly abundant among the sawflies (Tenthredinoidea) and the parasitoid superfamilies Chalcidoidea and
Cynipoidea. Thelytokous reproduction may be advantageous under certain environmental conditions and be of
use in biological control [7]. Several authors have realised
that sl-CSD may severely impair the evolution of thelytoky [87-90]. They implicitly assume that thelytoky
evolved after sl-CSD. The reason is that several forms of

Page 7 of 15

Frontiers in Zoology 2006, 3:1

thelytoky lead to an increase in homozygosity [91,92] and
hence will yield diploid males rather than females in CSD
species. Indeed, many species for which sl-CSD has been
refuted (Table 3) belong to the superfamilies in which
thelytoky is abundant.
Several forms of thelytoky are known from the Hymenoptera and each differs in its compatibility with sl-CSD
(Table 4). The most extreme form is gamete duplication in
which the meiotically produced haploid egg undergoes an
extra round of DNA replication without cell division. The
result is complete homozygosity. Gamete duplication has
been demonstrated in only five species of Hymenoptera,
two chalcidoids and three cynipoids (Table 4).
Stouthamer and Kazmer [89] were the first to show that
gamete duplication in Trichogramma was induced by cytoplasmically inherited Wolbachia bacteria. Such parthenogenesis inducing (PI) Wolbachia are now known from over
75 species of Hymenoptera (reviewed in [93]; Table 5). SlCSD is believed to be fully incompatible with Wolbachiainduced thelytoky. This mode of sex determination may
therefore prevent the evolution of thelytoky by infection
with PI-Wolbachia, this is supported by correlative taxonomic evidence. PI-Wolbachia are most abundant in the
parasitoid superfamilies Chalcidoidea and Cynipoidea.
These two groups appear to lack species with sl-CSD
(Table 1). In contrast, PI-Wolbachia have not yet been
found in the Tenthredinoidea (sawflies), Ichneumonoidea, Apoidea and Vespoidea. These are all groups in which
sl-CSD is prevalent, and include the social Hymenoptera
in which Wolbachia infection is over 50 per cent [94]. Even
though thelytokous reproduction occurs among social
Hymenoptera [95] it is has never been found to be caused
by Wolbachia, this strongly suggest that sl-CSD has prevented the infection of PI-Wolbachia in the social
Hymenoptera. For a number of groups (e.g. the sawflies),
it is unclear how intensively they have been screened for
Wolbachia, and there is a clear need for additional data on
the link between sex determining mechanism and reproductive mode.
Caution needs to be exerted in extrapolating PI-Wolbachia
to gamete duplication; for only five species has it been
unequivocally demonstrated that gamete duplication is
the mechanism by which thelytoky occurs in PI-Wolbachia
infected species [89,96-99] see Table 4) and other mechanisms may occur [100]. There is a clear need for more
cytological investigations of the mechanism of thelytoky
in Hymenoptera in relation to sl-CSD and PI-Wolbachia.
Two other forms of thelytoky are fusion of second division sister and non-sister nuclei, also referred to as terminal and central fusion [92,101,102]. Here, either the two
central polar nuclei of the second meiotic division fuse
and form the egg from which the embryo develops, or the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/1

second polar nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus. Both
processes lead to an increase in homozygosity over time,
although they differ in the region of the genome that is
affected. Under non-sister nuclei fusion, all loci distal of a
cross-over have a 50 per cent chance of becoming
homozygous depending on the segregation of the univalents during anaphase. Under sister nuclei fusion, proximal loci between the centromere and a cross-over have a
50 per cent chance of becoming homozygous. Both processes are therefore compatible with sl-CSD as long as the
sex locus is located close to a centromere (non-sister
fusion) or a telomere (sister fusion) respectively. Second
division non-sister nuclei fusion has been reported in the
honeybee (Apis mellifera) and a genetically similar mechanism in the ichneumonid Venturia canescens (Table 4).
Another very special case is found in the ant Cataglyphis
cursor. In this species, queens produce gynes predominantly by central fusion, while workers are produced by
normal sexual reproduction [103]. As a result, the level of
homozygosity is significantly higher in gynes than in
workers, but no reports have been made of DMP. This suggests that this C. cursor either has an alternative sex determination system, or that the sex locus is located in a
region of no recombination, such as close to a centromere
or in an inversion. Fusion of second division nuclei has
been found in two sawflies and the chalcidoid wasp
Aphytis mytilaspides (Table 4). The sex locus in these species is expected to be located distally on one of the chromosomes.
Besides automictic (meiotic) parthenogenesis, apomixis
(mitotic parthenogenesis) has been reported in four species of Hymenoptera; the sawfly Strongylogaster maculata,
the cynipid Neoretus baccarum and the ant Oecophylla longinoda and the ant Wasmannia auropunctata (Table 4).
Apomixis in these organisms occurs in the form of premeiotic doubling [92], this fixes heterozygosity and all
offspring are identical to the mother. Pre-meiotic doubling is therefore fully compatible with sl-CSD because
the heterozygous state of the sex locus in the female
remains fixed.
Other adaptations to CSD
In this section we discuss a number of known biological
phenomena that may evolve in CSD species to overcome
DMP. Although there is currently little evidence for most
of these phenomena, this exercise is meant to draw attention to possible processes that have hitherto not been
investigated, and to help to further focus future research in
hymenopteran biology.
Evolution of more sex loci
One means of genetically reducing the risk of matched
mating is to increase the number of sex loci, i.e. multilocus CSD. Under the ml-CSD model (originally pro-

posed by Snell [104] and extended by Crozier [105], there
are two or more sex loci, each with multiple alleles, that
determine sex. Heterozygosity at one or more loci is considered to result in females; only diploids that are
homozygous at all loci will develop into males. Multilocus CSD could evolve from single-locus CSD by a gene
duplication event and a subsequent mutational change in
the sex allele of one locus. Gene duplications are known
to occur frequently during evolution [106]. However, thus
far only once has ml-CSD been claimed to exist [107], in
this study, the authors found evidence for two independent sex loci in the sawfly Arge nigrinodosa. At this moment
it remains unclear whether ml-CSD occurs in more
hymenopteran groups. Presence of ml-CSD has been rendered improbable for only two species based on prolonged inbreeding experiments [33,108] and for
completely homozygous thelytokous wasps that have
become sexual after Wolbachia removal [89]. More rigorous testing of species shown to lack sl-CSD is needed to
determine the validity and prevalence of ml-CSD.
Wolbachia effects on sex determination
A theoretical possibility of how Wolbachia induced thelytoky could evolve in sl-CSD species is if the Wolbachia
bacteria could overrule the hosts sex determining process,
e.g. by making a product that turns diploid homozygous
males into females. Although Wolbachia are known to
affect several different developmental processes, including feminisation of genotypic males [109], a direct overruling of the sex determining process in haplodiploids has
not yet been reported. However, it is not inconceivable
given that (1) Wolbachia is widespread among Hymenoptera, (2) new effects of Wolbachia on their hosts are frequently discovered and (3) such an effect would provide
a strong selective advantage to the micro-organism and
may alleviate the diploid male load.

Selective fertilisation
Selective fertilisation is a well known phenomenon [110];
in many organisms females mate multiply and store
sperm of several males. Sperm sorting refers to preferential fertilisation of eggs by particular types of sperm and
implies sophisticated egg-sperm interactions. There is
some evidence that eggs can gain information about the
"content" of sperm through recognition of sperm surface
proteins, before they make the "decision" of which of its
own haplotypes will be lost in the second polar body
[111,112]. In the case of sl-CSD, if eggs are able to recognise sperm with a matching sex allele and block fertilisation by such sperm, this would reduce or avoid the
production of diploid male offspring in matched crosses.
However, if females mate only once, they will receive only
one type of sperm (due to haploidy of males). Theoretically, if females could recognise the sex allele in their eggs
and control which eggs they fertilise, they could selectively fertilise those eggs that carry an unmatched allele
and lay eggs with the matched allele as unfertilised males.
Both sperm and egg sorting require the linkage of a signalling marker to the sex locus. Sperm selection has been proposed as an explanation for the deficiency of diploid
males in natural populations of the communal bee
Andrena scotica Perkins (= A. jacobi) [111]. These authors
found that 44 per cent of all matings in this species were
between sibs, whereas only 0.3 per cent of the diploids
were male. Clearly, more attention needs to be paid to the
possibility of selective fertilisation in Hymenoptera.
Selective self-ovicide
In some parasitoid species, females destroy the egg(s) of
other females before they oviposit in the host themselves,
a phenomenon known as ovicide [113] This behaviour
probably evolved as a means of increasing the survival of
their own eggs at the expense of eggs of conspecifics. It
implies that females are able to distinguish their own eggs

from those laid by other females. If females of CSD species were able to recognise matched eggs from unmatched
eggs, selective self-ovicide of diploid male eggs would enable them to increase their reproductive output. Though
self-ovicide has been reported for parasitoids [114] and
recognition of diploid male brood is known in several
social Hymenoptera (see above), recognition of diploid
males and females at the egg stage has not been reported
for Hymenoptera.
Viability and fertility of diploid males
Diploid males are frequently unviable, sterile or produce
diploid sperm resulting in triploid sterile daughters (references in [31]). The recent work of Cowan and Stahlhut
has challenged the view that such males are an evolutionary dead end. They reported evidence for normal fertility
of diploid males in the wasp Euodynerus foraminatus. Their
female offspring were diploid rather than triploid and
inherited either one of the paternal marker alleles. At this
time it is unclear by what mechanism diploidy of daughters is accomplished. Male hymenopterans have an abortive first meiotic division in spermatogenesis [102]. The
authors suggest that diploid males may either produce
haploid sperm by normal spermatogenesis or one chromosome set is eliminated from the fertilised egg. Selective
elimination of a chromosome set during spermatogenesis
[2] is another possibility. Whatever the mechanism may
be, this study shows that selection could potentially also
act to restore diploid male fertility by changes in the meiotic mechanism of spermatogenesis or in chromosome
processing during the first mitotic division of the fertilised
egg.
Matched genome inactivation
Paternal genome loss (PGL) exists in a number of mites
and insects, including cynipid wasps, coccids and the fungal gnat Sciara [2], and has also been reported from the
autoparasitoid Encarsia pergandiella [115]. In some forms

of PGL males are effectively haploid because the paternally derived chromosomes are rendered inactive in male
embryos through heterochromatisation and subsequent
expulsion from the fertilised egg [2,74]. This process is
believed to be under control of products put into the egg
by the female. Theoretically, the disadvantages of DMP
under sl-CSD could partly be overcome by the evolution
of PGL. This would require females to be able to selectively eliminate the paternal genome if it carries a
matched sex allele. Such females would produce fertile
haploid males instead of sterile diploid males and
although she would lose control over the sex ratio of her
offspring, this could be selectively favourable in situations
where the cost of producing males is not too high. Recognition of paternally and maternally inherited chromosome complements has been well documented, e.g. in the
case of the Paternal Sex Ratio (PSR) chromosome [116],
but the exact mechanisms are typically not known and
neither are the conditions under which it evolved.

Conclusions and outlooks for future research
This discussion highlights that there are still quite a
number of intriguing questions to be answered before a
full picture of the many genetical, ecological and evolutionary aspects of CSD becomes clear. We conclude this
discussion by suggesting a number of research topics that,
in our opinion, would contribute significantly to redressing this gap.
1. Diploid males have been reported in many more species than in which sl-CSD has actually been shown, notably in social Hymenoptera. In a few species, however,
diploid males have been found that are not the result of
sl-CSD, but rather that originated from mutation or
hybridization. Thus, caution is required by directly inferring a role for sl-CSD from the presence of diploid males,
and demonstrates the need to confirm CSD claims not
only on the basis of DMP but also with molecular tech-

niques or inbreeding experiments. Such experiments
should carefully control for brood size, as diploid males
may sometimes be unviable.
2. The taxonomic distribution of sl-CSD is still far from
clear. Although there is a two-fold increase in the number
of species suggested to have sl-CSD since previous reviews
more than ten years ago [3,7,34], the information on the
taxonomic distribution has increased to a much lesser
extent, since many of these new species belong to the
same taxa. We can only repeat Cook and Crozier's call to
expand the search for CSD to other groups, most notably
the Symphyta and allies, such as the primitive families
Xyeloidea and Megalodontoidea. One key question of
hymenopteran reproduction that can be resolved with
this type of information is whether sl-CSD is indeed, as
many researchers assume, the ancestral mode of sex determination.
3. In social Hymenoptera a number of special adaptations
to CSD appear to have evolved, such as the elimination of
diploid males and diploid male producing queens. In the
non-social Hymenoptera, such as sawflies and solitary
parasitoids some features of the oviposition behaviour
can lead to a further temporal and spatial segregation of
siblings. Whether these behaviours are specific adaptations to sl-CSD is not known. Groups of closely related
species with and without sl-CSD such as the Cotesia genus
(Table 1 and 3) offer good opportunities to study the
adaptive significance of oviposition behaviour in relation
to CSD. Such a comparative approach may reveal whether
CSD imposes an important constraint on evolutionary
processes in these species, or whether the sequential
nature of oviposition itself is sufficient to overcome the
disadvantages of sib mating under CSD.
4. In some groups alternative sex determining mechanisms apparently exist which provide escape from the disadvantages of sl-CSD. If sl-CSD is the ancestral mode,
then these other mechanisms illustrate the evolutionary
answers to the disadvantages of CSD. Studying these
mechanisms, such as multi-locus CSD and diploid male
fertility, is highly relevant in this respect, since they may
act as possible stepping stones to undiscovered sex determining mechanisms in Hymenoptera. We have also discussed a number of hypothetical mechanisms that may
have evolved to reduce the risk of diploid male production under sl-CSD. They include the evolution of multiple
sex loci, selective fertilization, selective self-ovicide and
matched genome inactivation. Attention should be given
to these possibilities in future research on reproduction in
Hymenoptera.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/1

the restrictions placed upon species with this mode of sex
determination. It will be very rewarding to reveal the
mechanism of allelic complementation and how this
process is modified in non-CSD species. In this respect,
study of Braconidae may be particularly instructive
because easy shifts between CSD and alternative mechanisms seem to occur. Furthermore, availability of whole
genome sequences, such as for the honey bee and Nasonia
vitripennis, will help in the identification of sex determining genes.
In conclusion, more than 65 years after the discovery of slCSD by Whiting [4] many questions remain unresolved.
The study of CSD, however, remains highly relevant. For
this mode of sex determination is likely to have played a
major role in the evolution of most, if not all, groups of
Hymenoptera. There are many economically important
hymenopteran species, both beneficial and harmful, and
an increased understanding of the genetical and ecological aspects of CSD will contribute to their culturing or
control.
