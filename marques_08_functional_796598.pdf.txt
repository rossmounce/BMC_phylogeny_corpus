<p>Analysis of the functional diversification of duplicate genes.</p>
Subcellular localization of duplicate genes patterns of duplicate genes revealed that protein subcellular adaptation represents a common
subcellular localization

Abstract
Background: Gene duplication is the primary source of new genes with novel or altered
functions. It is known that duplicates may obtain these new functional roles by evolving divergent
expression patterns and/or protein functions after the duplication event. Here, using yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model organism, we investigate a previously little considered mode
for the functional diversification of duplicate genes: subcellular adaptation of encoded proteins.
Results: We show that for 24-37% of duplicate gene pairs derived from the S. cerevisiae wholegenome duplication event, the two members of the pair encode proteins that localize to distinct
subcellular compartments. The propensity of yeast duplicate genes to evolve new localization
patterns depends to a large extent on the biological function of their progenitor genes. Proteins
involved in processes with a wider subcellular distribution (for example, catabolism) frequently
evolved new protein localization patterns after duplication, whereas duplicate proteins limited to
a smaller number of organelles (for example, highly expressed biosynthesis/housekeeping proteins
with a slow rate of evolution) rarely relocate within the cell. Paralogous proteins evolved divergent
localization patterns by partitioning of ancestral localizations ('sublocalization'), but probably more
frequently by relocalization to new compartments ('neolocalization'). We show that such
subcellular reprogramming may occur through selectively driven substitutions in protein targeting
sequences. Notably, our data also reveal that relocated proteins functionally adapted to their new
subcellular environments and evolved new functional roles through changes of their physicochemical properties, expression levels, and interaction partners.
Conclusion: We conclude that protein subcellular adaptation represents a common mechanism
for the functional diversification of duplicate genes.

Background

Gene duplication is an important evolutionary mechanism,
providing genomes with the genetic raw material for the
emergence of genes with new or altered functions [1]. Several

evolutionary fates of the two duplicate gene copies are possible and have been described. For instance, one of the two copies may be redundant and accumulate deleterious mutations
that eventually render it a non-functional pseudogene [1].

Alternatively, both copies might be functionally preserved by
natural selection if an increase in gene dosage of the ancestral
gene is beneficial [2], or if a change of the stoichiometry of
proteins in complexes (for example, after whole genome
duplication (WGD) events) would be deleterious [3,4].
Finally, if both gene copies are preserved after the duplication
event, they may functionally diverge in two major ways.

teome provides a unique opportunity to assess the extent and
patterns of protein subcellular adaptation after gene
duplication.

In the classic scenario termed neofunctionalization [1], one of
the duplicates evolves a new function (usually defined as a
new biochemical function of the encoded protein), while the
other retains the ancestral function of the progenitor gene. An
alternative model - termed subfunctionalization - posits that
the ancestral functions are partitioned between the two duplicates such that their joint levels and patterns of activity are
equivalent to the single ancestral gene [5-7]. 'Gene function'
in this model is defined as either a function of the encoded
proteins [6,8] or the expression pattern of the gene [5,9]. In
addition, a combination of these two scenarios ('subneofunctionalization') was recently proposed [10].

Using protein localization data (22 compartments; obtained
by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion analysis) covering
75% of the S. cerevisiae proteome [15], we established the
subcellular localization of proteins encoded by 900 yeast
genes, forming 450 pairs of WGD-derived duplicate genes
[17] (see Materials and methods for details). Among these, we
collected 238 pairs for which both paralogs are unambiguously assigned to at least one subcellular compartment (Table
1; see Materials and methods). For 88 of these protein pairs
(approximately 37%), we found that the two duplicates are
located in at least one different subcellular compartment
(Table 1 and Additional data file 1).

The subcellular localization of a protein is key to its function
in the cell [11]. In view of this and prompted by the observation that a number of individual reports describe gene families that encode proteins that differ with respect to their
subcellular localization (see, for example, [12,13]; for more
individual examples, see also [14]), we set out to systematically investigate an - as yet - little considered alternative
mechanism for the functional diversification of duplicate
genes, namely, the subcellular relocalization and adaptation
of their encoded proteins [14] (which may or not be followed
or accompanied by changes of gene expression patterns and/
or functional/biochemical properties of the proteins).

The localization data we used was previously shown to be in
80% agreement with data (small and large-scale) from the
Saccharomyces Genome Database [15,18], suggesting that
the subcellular assignments are generally reliable. However,
to assess to what extent experimental artifacts may potentially have influenced the analysis of subcellular divergence
between duplicates, we performed a second analysis using
earlier S. cerevisiae localization data generated by epitopetagging [19]. The two localization analyses present considerable differences in their experimental setup and the number of
cellular compartments covered. Thus, the error sources and
potentially misassigned subcellular localizations are expected
to be different between the two datasets (for details see [15]).

To this end, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a
model, for three reasons. First, the subcellular localization of
a large proportion (approximately 75%) of its proteins was
recently established [15]. Second, in addition to other duplicates, the WGD event in this species, which occurred approximately 100 million years ago [16], resulted in a large set of
well-defined duplicate gene pairs with the same age (that is,
they have the same divergence time). Finally, a wide range of
genome- and proteome-wide functional data sets are available for this organism. Thus, the S. cerevisiae genome/pro-

Results and discussion
Subcellular divergence is common among yeast wholegenome duplicates

We found no significant difference in the proportion of paralogous protein pairs showing distinct subcellular localizations
between the GFP (88 of 238 pairs, approximately 37%) and
epitope data (53 of 124 pairs, approximately 43%; two-tailed
P = 0.31, Fisher's exact test; Table 1). We also considered 75
paralogous protein pairs for which localization was assigned
in both the GFP and the epitope fusion analyses. Among
these, 18 (24%) showed a distinct subcellular localization in
both experimental sets (Table 1). Thus, we estimate that

approximately 24-37% of the S. cerevisiae WGD pairs show
protein localization differences, consistent with a recent estimate (approximately 19%) based on Gene Ontology (GO)
annotation [20]. This suggests that a significant proportion of
yeast duplicates have diverged in terms of their subcellular
localization.

show lower non-synonymous substitution rates than those in
D-pairs.

All following analyses are based on the GFP-fusion localization data [15], since they represent the most extensive and
reliable localization survey of the budding yeast proteome
available. WGD-derived duplicates with distinct cellular
localization will be referred to as D-pairs, and those with the
same subcellular distribution as S-pairs.

Subcellular localization change and protein function
As some biological processes (for example, phosphorylation)
are widespread in the cell, whereas others, such as transcription, are restricted to certain organelles (nucleus, mitochondria), one may expect that ancestral functions may impose
different constraints with respect to the subcellular diversification potential of duplicates.
To assess whether a gene's biological function indeed influences the subcellular localization fate of proteins after duplication, we tested for general functional differences between
genes in S- and D-pairs using GO annotation. In this analysis,
we assume that the current GO distribution of duplicates
overall reflects that of their ancestors. Two GO categories
stand out (Table 2). While S-pairs show a significant excess of
genes involved in biosynthetic processes, D-pairs are significantly enriched with genes involved in catabolism (P ≤ 0.01
after false discovery rate correction [21]). We note that, generally, S. cerevisiae proteins (excluding the WGD duplicates)
involved in catabolism are located in, on average, 1.47 compartments, while those that contribute to biosynthesis localize in 1.35 compartments, a significantly different
distribution (two-tailed P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). This
suggests that the a priori wider subcellular distribution of
proteins involved in catabolic pathways facilitates functional
divergence through subcelullar relocalization after gene
duplication when compared to biosynthetic proteins, which
show more restricted localization patterns.
Next, we analyzed the extent of amino acid divergence in Dand S-pair duplicates. To this end, we used a related yeast
species, Kluyveromyces waltii [17], which diverged from S.
cerevisiae before the WGD event, as an outgroup, and estimated the non-synonymous substitution rate (that is, the
number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site, dN) on the lineages leading to each one of the two
S. cerevisiae duplicates using a maximum-likelihood
approach [22] (see Materials and Methods for details). This
analysis revealed a difference in the dN distribution between
genes in S- and D-pairs (Figure 1; Additional data file 1; twotailed P < 10-5, Mann-Whitney U test); S-pair genes generally

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R54

Marques et al. R54.3

Consistent with previous observations [17], cases of extreme
decelerated evolution (one of the duplicates has a dN = 0)
among S-pairs include protein coding genes that are known to
be highly constrained, such as ribosomal genes (28 pairs),
histones (2 pairs) and elongation factors (2 pairs). Selection
for increased gene dosage and/or decreased dosage imbalance may explain the intensity of purifying selection observed
for these 'housekeeping' duplicates [1,3,23]. The fact that
these duplicates did not change their subcellular localization
is likely due to the specificity of their biological function,
which is restricted to certain compartments and may generally preclude subcellular shifts, as suggested by our data
above.
We also found that S-pair genes show higher expression levels
than D-pair genes (median = 1.3 copies per cell versus 0.8
copies per cell; two-tailed P < 10-5, Mann-Whitney U test),
consistent with the idea that many S-pairs represent duplications of housekeeping genes. This difference is also reflected
at the protein level; D-pair genes (median = 5,436.9 pmol)
express significantly more protein than S-pair genes (mean =
35,788.3 pmol, two-tailed P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test).
Thus, generally, biological function appears to be a strong
determinant for the propensity of duplicates to relocate in the
cell. While duplicate proteins encoded by slowly evolving
housekeeping genes with high expression levels (for example,
genes involved in biosynthetic process, such as ribosomal
genes) tend to preserve ancestral localization patterns (and
functions) after duplication, duplicates from other categories,
such as those involved in catabolic processes, are much more
likely to evolve divergent localization patterns.

Functional divergence of duplicates through neo- or
sublocalization
But how do these divergent localization patterns emerge?
Akin to concepts proposed for the functional divergence of
duplicate genes through changes in expression and/or protein function, we hypothesized that duplicates may show two
types of subcellular divergence (Figure 2). First, ancestral cellular compartments may be partitioned between them, or
they may specifically localize to only part of the ancestral
compartments, a process we term 'sublocalization'. Second,
they may localize to new, previously unoccupied compartments ('neolocalization'). These two processes are analogous
to the traditional neo/subfunctionalization concepts [1,57,9], but should be treated separately, as neo/subfunctionalization of the biochemical function and/or expression of the
duplicate (that is, the previously considered fates of duplicates) may follow or accompany subcellular divergence (Figure 2).

If divergent subcellular localization between duplicates was a
consequence of sublocalization alone, the joint number of different compartments per protein pair (that is, combining
both duplicates) would be expected to be the same as that of

the common ancestral protein. Conversely, the number of
compartments per pair should be higher than that of the
progenitor if neolocalization contributed to subcellular
diversification.

A potential caveat of this analysis is that the types of proteins
represented in D-pairs might generally and a priori be
present in a larger number of compartments, as also indicated by the analysis of the number of compartments for catabolic/biosynthetic proteins discussed above. To control for
this, we compared the number of distinct compartments per
D-pairs and singletons for proteins within the same GO
classes. To ensure adequate sample sizes, we focused on the 8
GO categories that contain more than 30 proteins for both Dpairs and singletons (Table 3). This analysis shows that for all
eight comparisons, the joint number of compartments per Dpair is significantly higher than that observed for singletons
(Table 3; two-tailed P < 10-4, Mann-Whitney U test). This suggests that the elevated number of compartments for D-pairs
is indeed a result of neolocalization and not due to a wide cellular representation of ancestral progenitor proteins, prior to
duplication. Based on the observed excess (mean, approximately 0.98) of D-pairs relative to singletons from the same
functional categories, we estimate that, on average, approximately one compartment is gained by neolocalization per
duplication event between duplicates showing subcellular
divergence. In addition to the elevated number of compartments per D-pairs, we find that the average number of compartments per D-pair protein (approximately 1.53) is
significantly higher than that of singletons in 7 of 8 comparisons (two-tailed P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). This result
further underscores that neolocalization probably predominated over sublocalization during yeast duplicate evolution.

To assess the contribution of neo- and sublocalization to the
functional diversification of duplicates and given the lack of
subcellular localization data for ancestral proteins, we used
the average number of subcellular compartments of yeast singleton gene products (that is, genes that show no evidence of
paralogs in the S. cerevisiae genome; see Materials and methods for details) as a proxy for the subcellular representation of
WGD duplicate progenitors (akin to a previous analysis of
yeast duplicates [10]).
We observed that the joint number of distinct compartments
per D-pair (mean = 2.31 ± 0.63, median = 2) is significantly
higher than that observed for singleton proteins (mean = 1.30

used the K. waltii ortholog(s) as outgroups and reconstructed
the phylogeny for 45 WGD yeast families (15 D- and 30 Spair-containing gene families) with at least 1 additional member and mapped the subcellular localizations of these onto the
phylogenies (Figure 3 and Additional data file 2). In 16 families, the subcellular localization has remained completely preserved among the members (Additional data file 2). For the
remaining 29 families, we analyzed changes in protein location, assuming that the scenario requiring the smallest

number of subcellular changes, given the observed data (parsimony principle), reflects the true pattern of events.
For 16 of the 29 families, we could infer the most likely scenario of subcellular diversification. Eight families show
instances of neolocalization (Additional data file 2). For
example, members of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, involved in protein degradation [24], are generally located
in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Figure 3a). However,

generally show a faster rate of protein evolution and, therefore, show an elevated SP divergence. Thus, at least for
proteins targeted to the mitochondria and to the ER, differences in subcellular localization between duplicates are associated with accelerated signal peptide sequence evolution.
Conceivably, this acceleration may have been driven by positive Darwinian selection. A recent study demonstrating selectively driven optimization of a mitochondrial targeting signal
of a protein from a young primate gene (L Rosso and colleagues, unpublished) suggests that this is a plausible
scenario.

Sublocalization events occurred in four protein families. For
instance, GIS2 (cytoplasmic) and AIR2 (nuclear) of the AIR
protein family partitioned their ancestral compartments (the
cytoplasm and nucleus - still seen for their AIR1 paralog; Figure 3b). Consistent with their specific localizations, GIS2 specialized in a function in the RAS/cAMP signaling pathway
[26], whereas AIR2 became specifically involved in the
processing and export of mRNAs from the nucleus [27].
In the remaining four families, both neo- and sublocalization
events appear to have occurred (Additional data file 2). In
addition to the neolocalization event described above, the
UBC family also reveals an instance of sublocalization based
on GFP data; UBC13 lost the ancestral nuclear localization
(Figure 3a). Thus, the UBC family shows both neo- and sublocalization of family members.

Subcellular shifts and signal peptide evolution
The information required for sorting of proteins to different
cellular compartments is encoded in their sequence, sometimes in distinct targeting motifs [11]. Consequently, differences in the subcellular localization of paralogous proteins
should be due to protein sequence changes and should, in
principle, be detectable. However, the identification of protein targeting sequence determinants has proven to be a
difficult task [11]. To elucidate the molecular basis of subcellular relocalization of duplicates, we focused our analysis on
the best characterized targeting sequences; amino-terminal
signal peptides (SPs) that target proteins to the mitochondria
or the ER. These types of SPs are typically 13-36 amino acids
long and are usually cleaved from the mature peptide [28].
We estimated the amino acid divergence between WGD proteins pairs with ER and/or mitochondrial localization (36
pairs in total, among which 21 are S-pairs and 15 are D-pairs;
Table 4). We then determined the aminoacid divergence in
the first either 13 or 36 amino acids (putative signal peptide
region) and in the mature peptide (protein sequence without
signal peptide), and then compared it between the 21 S- and
15 D-pairs (Table 4).
The average amino acid divergence in the SP is higher for protein pairs for which the ER/mitochondrial localization is not
preserved (the median divergence based on the 13 amino acid
SP is 0.92, and based on the 36 amino acid SP is 0.86) than
for those pairs that maintained the same subcellular localization (13 amino acid SP, 0.69; 36 amino acid SP, 0.67), a significantly different distribution (two-tailed P < 0.05, MannWhitney U test). In contrast, we observed no significant difference for the accumulation of amino acid substitutions in
the mature peptide (for neither of the mature peptide sizes
tested) between the two sets of proteins (two-tailed P > 0.6,

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R54

Marques et al. R54.7

The NTG1/2 base excision repair and TRR1/2 thioredoxin
reductase WGD gene pairs provide striking examples of how
subcellular reprogramming through changes in targeting
sequences may occur (Figure 4). Through a comparison with
the NTG orthologous protein from K. waltii, we determined
that NTG1 gained an amino-terminal signal after the WGD
event (mainly through a number of amino acid substitutions)
that targets it to mitochondria, while NTG2 maintained the
ancestral nuclear localization (Figure 4a). Conversely, TRR1
lost the ancestral capacity to localize to mitochondria, due to
a deletion of its amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting
sequence (Figure 4b). Thus, while keeping their ancestral
enzymatic functions [29,30], both NTG1 and TRR1 obtained
new functional roles through neolocalization changes, caused
by gain and loss of (mitochondrial) targeting sequences,
respectively.

Functional adaptation to new subcellular
environments
Functional adaptation of duplicate proteins to new subcellular compartments may occur in several ways. Given that
organelles generally display distinct physico-chemical properties that are reflected in the properties of their proteome
and transcriptome [31,32], relocalized duplicates may show
physico-chemical adaptations that allow them to optimally
function in their new (in the case of neolocalization) or more
restricted (sublocalization) cellular environments.
We first tested whether duplicate proteins reveal evidence for
adaptation to the pH of the compartments to which they
localize. To this end, we analyzed the pI (isoelectric point) of
duplicates, since the pI distribution of proteins is specific to
compartments and likely associated with the compartments'
pH [32]. We observed a significantly different distribution of
fold differences in pI between D- and S-pair duplicates (twotailed P < 10-3, Mann-Whitney U test; see Additional data file
1 for individual values), with D-pairs displaying a higher
median fold difference between the members of the pair
(0.09) than S-pair genes (0.04). This result is in accordance
with the notion that duplicates with different subcellular
localization show pI adaptation, likely due to the pH of their
new/altered cellular environments. However, alternatively, it

remains possible that the elevated pI divergence of D-pair
proteins may simply reflect the generally higher amino acid
divergence observed for D-pair relative to S-pair duplicates
(see above).
To distinguish between these two possibilities, we tested
whether the observed substitutions between proteins are
biased in terms of the pI of the accumulated amino acids. This
analysis revealed that 24 of the 88 D-pairs display a significantly skewed accumulation of substitutions regarding the pI

Bonferroni-corrected for multiple (238) tests). In other
words, for 24 pairs, the two paralogs have accumulated a significantly larger number of amino acids with a higher or
smaller pI, respectively, than expected by chance for such a
pairwise comparison (50%). This is a significantly higher proportion of pairs (one-tailed P < 0.05, Fisher's exact test) compared to that of S-pairs (26/150 pairs), for which the
difference in pI cannot be explained by subcellular localization differences. These analyses suggest that D-pair proteins

result is likely not due to a difference in the number of different interactors determined for the two sets of protein pairs
(median = 9 and 8 interactors per S- and D-pairs, respectively; two-tailed P = 0.48, Mann-Whitney U test). Thus, as
predicted, subcellular divergence of duplicates appears to
lead to a pronounced divergence in terms of their interaction
with other proteins.

show adaptation to the pH/pI properties of new or altered
cellular environments through the fixation of certain amino
acids by natural selection.
The expression level of a gene was reported to also be related
- at least in part - to the subcellular localization of its product
[31]. This may be due to the different volumes of the various
compartments (for example, larger compartments would
require more protein molecules according to this hypothesis
[31]). We computed the fold difference in mRNA transcript
abundance [33] for our set of yeast duplicates. The average
expression difference between genes in D-pairs (mean, 0.88)
is higher than that between S-pair genes (0.71), a significantly
different distribution (two-tailed P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U
test). The elevated expression divergence of D-pair duplicates
may indicate that they generally adapted to the expression
level requirements of their compartments, for example,
through changes in their regulatory sequences.

Subcellular adaptation, protein-protein interactions,
and the evolution of new functions
The subcellular localization of a protein determines its ability
to interact with other proteins in its local environment.
Therefore, subcellular diversification of duplicates should
often entail changes in their interactions with other proteins.
In the case of sublocalization, the descendant duplicate
(assuming that it required protein partners for functioning) is
bound to lose interaction partners that were specific to the
lost compartment(s). Conversely, proteins that occupy new
subcellular niches may obtain new interaction partners.
Using a database containing extensive S. cerevisiae protein
interaction data [34], we observed that the two members in
D-pairs share a significantly smaller fraction of interactors
(median = 6.4%) than duplicates in S-pairs (median = 13.7%,
two-tailed P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test; Figure 5). This

Subcellular relocalization may allow for the possibility that
duplicate proteins evolve new functions (in the case of neolocalization) or functionally specialize (in the case of sublocalization, where both duplicates localize to distinct
compartments) by evolving interactions with proteins that
are located in their own compartment(s) but not in that of
their duplicate copies. To test this, we assessed how often an
interactor is located in the same compartment as the D-pair
duplicate with which it interacts. We then compared this
value to the extent of co-localization of these interactors with
the other protein of the pair (with which no interaction was
found).
For 1,270 interactions that are not shared between D-pair
proteins (involving 955 interactors and 82/88 D-pair proteins), 684 show co-localization of the interactor and the
duplicate with which it interacts. This represents a significantly larger overlap than that observed between these interactors and the non-interacting paralogs of the pairs (582/
1,270, two-tailed P < 10-4, Fisher's exact test). We note, however, that - as expected (given the shared history of the two
duplicates of a D-pair) - this subcellular overlap is greater
than that observed between random protein pairs (1,354/
2,628, two-tailed P < 10-4, Fisher's exact test). These results
support the notion that subcellular diversification allowed
duplicates to obtain new functions and/or functionally specialize by evolving interactions with proteins that are specific
to their compartment(s). Given that neolocalization seems
frequent (see above), duplicates appear to often have
obtained novel functional roles by evolving interactions with
compartment-specific proteins - unattainable to their single
copy progenitors.

Conclusion

In this study, we have begun to assess the role of subcellular
relocalization and adaptation for the emergence of new or
altered gene functions after duplication, using yeast as a
model organism. Our work suggests that subcellular divergence has played a significant role for the functional divergence of duplicate genes. It has affected roughly one-third of
yeast WGD duplicates, in particular those involved in biological processes with a wider subcellular distribution (for example, catabolism).
Although subcellular redistribution of duplicate proteins
involved repartitioning/loss of ancestral compartments, relocalization of proteins to previously unoccupied

Genome Biology 2008,

compartments (neolocalization) seems to have prevailed and
led to an overall gain of compartments among duplicates.
Thus, duplicate genes appear to frequently have obtained new
functional roles through the process of subcellular relocalization. The finding that relocalized proteins have obtained new
interaction partners and lost ancestral ones underscores this
notion. Interestingly, we found that relocalized proteins show
adaptations to the physico-chemical properties of their
altered cellular environments through the selective fixation of
amino acid substitutions.

Subcellular localization data

A number of individual reports have revealed differences in
subcellular localization of paralogous proteins in humans and
other mammals (for example, [12]; see also references in
[14]). Our study here motivates and warrants systematic surveys that address the role of subcellular adaptation in the
functional diversification of mammalian (duplicate) genes.
These should also aim to explore recent duplications (most
duplications in the yeast genome - including those studied
here - are old), in order to better understand the timing and
selective pressures associated with this process. In fact, two
individual recent cases from apes have shed initial light on the
early stages of subcellular adaptation (L Rosso and colleagues, unpublished). These demonstrate that subcellular
adaptation may indeed occur through both neolocalization (L
Rosso and colleagues, unpublished) and sublocalization (L
Rosso and colleagues, unpublished), and that subcellular
adaptation may be accompanied or followed by adaptive
changes of the biochemical function of the protein (L Rosso
and colleagues, unpublished). Moreover, they show that subcellular shifts may be adaptive, driven by positive selection,
and may occur through a few selected changes in specific
(signal) sequences (consistent with our analysis of duplicated
target sequences presented here), thus allowing for rapid
retargeting of duplicate proteins during evolution.
We conclude that in addition to changes in their expression
and biochemical function, selectively driven subcellular
adaptation has played an important role for the functional
diversification of duplicate genes and the emergence of new
gene functions in both uni- and multicellular organisms.
Thus, generally, investigating the subcellular phenotype of
duplicate genes may provide valuable clues to their function
and fate.

Subcellular localization data were retrieved from [37]. Only
proteins unambiguously assigned to at least one of the 22
analyzed subcellular compartments were used. Another global protein localization data set [19,38] was used for comparison. Subcellular localizations (Figure 4) were predicted using
Predotar [39,40].

Non-synonymous substitution rates
We used MUSCLE 3.6 [41] to construct codon-based nucleotide alignments of S. cerevisiae WGD gene pairs and their
corresponding K. waltii orthologous genes. To estimate the
rate of non-synonymous changes, dN, along the different
branches of the S. cerevisiae/K. waltii gene trees, we used the
CODEML free-ratio model as implemented in the PAML 3.15
package [22].

Phylogenetic reconstructions
We used a maximum likelihood approach, PROML, as implemented in the PHYLIP 3.67 software package, to reconstruct
the phylogeny of the protein families (protein sequence alignment infiles were generated using MUSCLE 3.6).

S. cerevisiae singletons
To identify proteins without paralogs (singletons), an allagainst-all BLASTP similarity search (E-value = 0.1) was conducted. Proteins without hits against other proteins in this
search were considered to be singletons.

Gene ontology analysis
GO analyses were conducted using FatiGO [42,43].

Gene expression analyses
S. cerevisiae gene expression levels - measured as the number
of mRNA copies per cell - were retrieved from [33]. The average absolute protein abundance in pmol was retrieved from
the literature (supplemental data of [44]). The fold difference
of gene expression per gene pair was calculated as the absolute difference between the numbers of mRNA copies or protein concentration per gene normalized by the average mRNA
copy number or protein concentration per gene pair.

Isoelectric point and hydrophathy data
Hydrophathy and pI data were collected from the literature
(supplemental data of [44]).

Protein-protein interactions

S. cerevisiae WGD genes and other paralogs
We retrieved the gene IDs of 900 S. cerevisiae WGD paralogs
(organized in 450 gene pairs) as well as the IDs, orthologs,
and nucleotide/protein sequence of K. waltii orthologs from
the supplemental data of [17]. Nucleotide and amino acid
sequences for all S. cerevisiae WGD gene pairs and non-WGD
paralogs (as defined by Ensembl gene family annotations)
were retrieved from the Ensembl database, release 45
[35,36].

Protein interactors for all proteins in D- and S-pairs were collected from the BioGRID repository [34,45].
