Incomplete homogenization of 18 S ribosomal
DNA coding regions in Arabidopsis thaliana
Ayalew B Mentewab1*, Megan J Jacobsen2,3 and Rebekah A Flowers1

Abstract
Background: As a result of concerted evolution, coding regions of ribosomal DNA sequences are highly conserved
within species and variation is generally thought to be limited to a few nucleotides. However, rDNA sequence
variation has not been systematically examined in plant genomes, including that of the model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana whose genome was the first to be sequenced.
Findings: Both genomic and transcribed 18 S sequences were sampled and revealed that most deviation from the
consensus sequence was limited to single nucleotide substitutions except for a variant with a 270 bp deletion
from position 456 to 725 in Arabidopsis numbering. The deletion maps to the functionally important and highly
conserved 530 loop or helix18 in the structure of E. coli 16 S. The expression of the deletion variant is tightly
controlled during developmental growth stages. Transcripts were not detectable in young seedlings but could be
amplified from RNA extracts of mature leaves, stems, flowers and roots of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia.
We also show polymorphism for the deletion variant among four Arabidopsis ecotypes examined.
Conclusion: Despite a strong purifying selection that might be expected against functionally impaired rDNAs, the
newly identified variant is maintained in the Arabidopsis genome. The expression of the variant and the
polymorphism displayed by Arabidopsis ecotypes suggest a transition state in concerted evolution.

Background
In eukaryotes, the 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs are
encoded as a single transcript from rDNA repeats,
arranged in head to tail arrays and separated by spacer
regions. Within a given species, rDNA repeats are often
identical, which has lead to the proposal that rDNA loci
undergo a concerted evolution [1,2]. Concerted evolution results in rapid horizontal homogenization of a
select variant through a number of molecular processes
such as unequal crossing over and gene conversion.
Additionally, functionally constrained regions such as
those encoding the 18 S and 25 S genes are subject to a
strong purifying selection resulting in a high degree of
conservation across species [3].
Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies motivated by phylogenetic analysis have uncovered the presence of divergent rDNA paralogs and pseudogenes in a
number of taxa [4-7]. Systematic studies on the extent

and nature of sequence variation have been limited.
Indeed, in fully sequenced genomes, regions of rDNA
repeats cannot be tiled into contigs and thus megabase
size gaps remain unassembled. In Drosophila and several
fungal genomes rDNA variability was examined using
traces from whole-genome shotgun sequencing projects
[8-11]. All four studies point to the existence of a small
degree of polymorphism among rDNA repeats, with the
vast majority of polymorphic sites located in the spacer
regions. For example, out of 227 polymorphic sites
detected in several yeast strains, only 44 sites mapped to
the rRNA-encoding genes [11]. Within the coding
regions, polymorphisms were three to eight times more
frequent in the expansion segments compared with the
conserved core regions that are functionally constrained.
To date, sequence level variation in Arabidopsis rDNA
coding regions remains unexplored. The BAC-end
sequencing approach taken for the Arabidopsis thaliana
genome precludes the use of trace sequences to examine
sequence variation [12]. There are approximately 12001500 repeats per diploid genome, at the tips of chromosomes 2 and 4, with two rDNA arrays that could be

distinguished by RFLP analysis [12,13]. A single complete rDNA unit is also found in the centromeric region
of chromosome 3. Here we report on the presence of a
270 bp deletion variant of 18 S rDNA that suggests Arabidopsis rDNA arrays are in transition stages of concerted evolution.

Results
BAC-end sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome precludes direct analysis from trace sequences, thus to sample sequence variation of 18 S rDNA, genomic DNA
was amplified. A total of 47 individual clones were generated. After sequence assembly with CAP3, two contigs
were identified with 44 clones in the first contig and 3
clones in the second contig. The first contig was identical to the 18 S sequence from At3g41768 (GenBank ID:
186510611) and the vast majority of the clones fell in
that contig group. Among those 44 clones, sequence
variation was very limited, with only a total of 6 clones
showing single nucleotide polymorphisms (Table 1). The
level of polymorphism captured is 0.3% per fragment
length and 13.6% per sequenced clones. Thus sequence
analysis limited to the first contig supports the view that
rDNA sequences are overall highly homogenous. However, the second contig identified, drastically deviated
from the canonical sequence. It lacked a 270 bp fragment corresponding to positions 456-725 in the canonical 18 S sequence (Figure 1). The deletion encompasses
the functionally important helix18 critical for ribosome
function. In addition, a A151C mutation was also found
to be characteristic of the second contig. BLAST
searches were carried out to identify similar variants in
GenBank but none were detected. Thus the 270 bp deletion variant was new and unusual. A total of 3 clones,
obtained from 2 independent samples fell in the second

contig group. The deleted variant was thus detected in
this experiment at a frequency of 6.4%.
To confirm that the observed deletion is not a PCR or
cloning artifact, we directly amplified the deleted variant
from genomic DNA using a new reverse primer. The
new reverse primer was designed such that the primer
overlapped the deleted region and would only anneal to
the new variant. PCR was carried out with a polymerase
lacking proofreading activity. Plasmids with the full
length and deleted 18 S variants served as negative and
positive controls. A bright band at 465 bp was consistently obtained from the deleted variant while no visible
band or a faint band of 730 bp was amplified from the
full length 18 S plasmid. As shown in Figure 2, the
expected 465 bp fragment was generated from Arabidopsis genomic DNA. The PCR product was further
sequenced to ensure an 18 S fragment was amplified.
These results confirm the presence of a new rDNA variant with 270 bp deletion in the Arabidopsis genome.
To examine whether particular sequences were
enriched in the transcribed pool of 18 S genes, total
RNA was extracted, DNAseI treated and reverse transcribed. PCR was performed on cDNA, 18 S fragments
cloned, and a total of 34 clones were sequenced. All
sequences aligned with the consensus, however a high
number of polymorphism was observed (Table 2).
Indeed deviation from the consensus sequence was
observed at 30 different positions, with most clones having single nucleotide polymorphisms. The level of polymorphism is 1.7% per fragment length, and 88.2% per
sequenced clones, thus about 6 fold higher than that
observed for rDNA. As shown in Table 3, the majority
of polymorphisms correspond to transitions (76.7%)
with T/C transitions being the most frequent (43.3%).
The deleted variant was not found among the 34
rRNA clones, raising the question of its expression.
We sought to characterize its expression in roots,
leaves, stems and flowers of WT Arabidopsis. RT-PCR
was performed after treatment of the RNA extracts
with DNAseI to prevent any amplification from genomic DNA. Lack of contamination with genomic DNA
was verified by the sole amplification of a 560 bp fragment from the internal control eIF4A. The deleted variant was detected in mature roots, leaves, stems and
flowers but not in young seedlings (Figure 3). Thus the
deleted variant is transcribed throughout the plant,
except in young seedlings suggesting developmental
control of expression.
To examine whether the 270 bp deletion is unique to
A. thaliana ecotype Columbia, we tested for its presence
in 3 other ecotypes: Landsberg erecta, Bay and Shahdara. The deletion variant was found in Landsberg
erecta, but not Bay and Shahdara indicating polymorphism in Arabidopsis populations (Figure 4).

Discussion and Conclusion
Systematic analysis of sequence variation in 18 S rDNA
of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that overall sequences
were highly homogenous except for the 270 bp deletion
variant. More single nucleotide variants were observed

in rRNA sequences, most likely due to the fidelity of
reverse transcriptase. The discovery of a 270 bp deletion
variant highlights the poor characterization of rDNA
variants in sequenced genomes. This variant was not
detected during BAC-end sequencing of the Arabidopsis

genome suggesting it is not found as an isolated repeat.
Rather, it is likely to be found embedded among the
canonical variants at the tips of chromosomes 2 or 4,
the two regions that harbor rDNA repeats. The frequency with which we have detected it in this study,
6.4% is surprisingly high. We have not yet ruled out the
possibility of preferential amplification of the deleted
variant because of its smaller size and simpler secondary
structure. However, given estimates of 1200-1500 rDNA
repeats, it is possible that multiple copies of this novel
variant may be present in the A. thaliana diploid
genome.
The existence of such a divergent 18 S sequence is at
odds with highly homogenous sequences that might be
expected from concerted evolution. Intra-individual
polymorphic rDNAs may subsist either when concerted
evolution is impaired by the location of rDNA repeats
in non-homologous chromosomes, in polyploids and
interspecific hybrids [14-19] or, when the rate of mutation exceeds that of concerted evolution [20,21]. Given
the ancient polyploidy of the Arabidopsis genome [12]
and the otherwise homogeneity of 18 S rDNAs
observed, the presence of the deletion variant is unlikely
to reflect impaired homogenization. Instead, it probably
represents a relatively new mutation and repeats in transition stages of concerted evolution.
Our results show that Arabidopsis thaliana accessions
are polymorphic for the presence of the deletion variant.
Arabidopsis accessions generally exhibit a relatively high
degree of polymorphism that is often shared worldwide;
yet some population structure and isolation by distance
is evident [22-24]. The availability of such large scale
population data in Arabidopsis will enable studies on
the inheritance pattern of the deletion variant and evolution of rDNA in Arabidopsis.
The extent of the observed deletion is unprecedented.
Indels reported for rDNA coding regions within a species generally concern one or two nucleotides. The 270

bp deletion encompasses the universally conserved helix
18 or ‘530 loop’, critical for ribosome function. Crystal
structures of bacterial 30 S ribosomal subunit have
established the role of helix 18 in decoding. Correct
binding of mRNA and cognate tRNA in the A site of
the ribosome induces conformational change of G530,
which then interacts with the second position of the
anticodon and the third position of the codon [25]. Analysis of 16 S mutants in bacteria corroborates the importance of helix 18. Typically, mutations in helix 18 result
in a lethal phenotypes [26,27]. The importance of this
region is also underscored by the fact that it is the target of several antibiotics.
Despite the fact that a functionally critical helix is
missing, our results show that the deleted variant is
expressed. Several studies in Arabidopsis have revealed
that rDNA expression is modulated by a number of factors. Only a fraction of all the rDNA repeats are transcribed because of dosage compensation mechanisms
that involve large scale silencing and a similar mechanism operates in silencing specific arrays in hybrids
[28-30]. Additionally this large scale silencing is under
the control of developmental switches as evidenced by
onset during early stages of seed germination [31,32].
Studies focusing on 5 S rDNA have also shown that
aberrant repeats are also silenced. Indeed, specific 5 S
rRNA loci were shown to be methylated to prevent production of aberrant transcripts [32,33].
If misfolded, mutated or non-functional rRNA are transcribed, several quality control mechanisms lead to their
degradation before or after ribosome biogenesis. These
include the exosome mediated quality control of misfolded pre-rRNAs following their polyadenylation [34-37]
as well as the ‘non-functional rRNA decay’ leading to
decreased stability of the mature rRNA contained in fully
assembled ribosomes and ribosomal subunits [38].
It is thus surprising that we have been able to detect
the expression of a significantly truncated variant.

is not clear. Thus, this finding opens up the possibility
of investigating factors controlling the expression of
such aberrant 18 S rRNAs in plants.
In conclusion, this study documents the existence of a
new 18 S variant with a 270 bp deletion and demonstrates the incomplete homogenization of rDNA coding
regions in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results also show
that Arabidopsis accessions are polymorphic for this variant, which open-up the possibility of investigating the
evolution and inheritance pattern of aberrant rDNA variants in the context of studies that examine the population structure of Arabidopsis. In addition, its expression
is dependent on the developmental stage of the plant,
with tight control in seedlings suggesting that transcriptional or post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms are
at play.

Methods
For cloning 18 S rDNA, genomic DNA was extracted
from Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-1)
grown for 10 days under sterile conditions on MS
media [39] using a modified CTAB method [40]. For
cloning transcribed 18 S rDNA, total RNA was extracted
from 100 mg plant material using a Plant RNAeasy kit
(Qiagen) and treated with DNAseI (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The total RNA was
then reverse transcribed with random primers using the
SuperScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen).
18 S sequences were PCR amplified from two independent extracts using Platinum Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) with FwdFull 5’CACC TACCTGGTTGAT
CCTGCCA3’ and RevFull 5 ‘ATCCTTCCGCAGGTTCAC 3’primers. The primer pair amplifies a 1803 bp
fragment from the 18 S rDNA, At3g41768 (GenBank
ID: 186510611). The PCR enhancer reagent was
included in the reaction. The PCR reaction was carried
out for 30 cycles with an annealing temperature of 58°C
for 30 seconds and an extension time of two and a half
minutes at 68°C. The PCR product running at about 1.8
kb was excised from the gel, cleaned and cloned in the
directional pENTR-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The
presence of an insert was verified by digesting plasmid
preps with HpaI and EcoRV.
A total of 47 clones generated from genomic DNA
and 34 clones generated from cDNA were sequenced

with universal FwdM13 and RevM13 as well as 18 S
internal primers 5’TCGATGGTAGGATAGTGG3’ and
5’ACATCTAAGGGCATCACA3’ to cover the entire
length of the insert. Trace files were imported in
CodonCode Aligner V.3.0.1 (CodonCode Corp.); vector
sequences removed and assembled using CAP3 [41].
Sequences were analyzed processed in CodonCode. Low
quality bases (q < 20) were automatically replaced by
that of the consensus sequence and all other discrepancies resolved manually. The level of polymorphism was
calculated per fragment length (total number of clones
deviating from the consensus/length of 18SrDNA which
is 1808 bp) and per sequenced clones (total number of
clones deviating from the consensus/total number of
sequenced clones).
For the detection of the presence and expression of
the deleted variant, genomic DNA and total RNA were
extracted from Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia
(Col-1) as above. RNA samples were obtained from 10
days old seedlings or roots of two weeks old plants
grown under sterile conditions as well as mature leaves,
stems and flowers from plants grown in soil for 5
weeks. For testing polymorphisms, DNA was extracted
from ecotypes Landsberg erecta, Bay and Shahdara.
To specifically detect the presence of the deleted variant, the FwdFull primer as above was used with a new
reverse primer, RevDel 5’ AGGCACGACCCGGCCAGG
3’. The two primers amplify a 460 bp fragment

exclusively from the deleted variant when a polymerase
lacking proofreading activity is used. Hence, the Platinum SuperMix (Invitrogen) was used for the detection
of the deleted variant. Amplification of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A fragments (At3G19760) served
as internal controls. Primers FwdeIF4A: 5’TAGAAGAGGCGGTGGAGCTA 3’ and ReveIF4A: 5’TCTGGT
CCTTGAACCCTCTG 3’were designed such that amplification from genomic DNA would result in a 872 bp
fragment and amplification from cDNA would result in
a 560 bp fragment.
For visualization of the deleted region on the secondary structure of Arabidopsis 18 S ribosomal RNA, the
structure was downloaded from the RNA STRAND
database [42] and edited using Inkscape version 0.48.0-1.

Nucleotide sequence
The sequence of the 18 S variant with 270 bp deletion
has been deposited in GenBank under the Accession
