Abstract
Background: The recent discoveries of novel human T-lymphotropic virus type 3 (HTLV-3) and highly divergent simian Tlymphotropic virus type 3 (STLV-3) subtype D viruses from two different monkey species in southern Cameroon suggest that
the diversity and cross-species transmission of these retroviruses are much greater than currently appreciated.
Results: We describe here the first full-length sequence of a highly divergent STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) virus obtained by PCRbased genome walking using DNA from two dried blood spots (DBS) collected from a wild-caught Cercopithecus mona monkey.
The genome of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) is 8913-bp long and shares only 77% identity to other PTLV-3s. Phylogenetic analyses
using Bayesian and maximum likelihood inference clearly show that this highly divergent virus forms an independent lineage with
high posterior probability and bootstrap support within the diversity of PTLV-3. Molecular dating of concatenated gag-pol-envtax sequences inferred a divergence date of about 115,117 years ago for STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) indicating an ancient origin for
this newly identified lineage. Major structural, enzymatic, and regulatory gene regions of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) are intact and
suggest viral replication and a predicted pathogenic potential comparable to other PTLV-3s.
Conclusion: When taken together, the inferred ancient origin of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB), the presence of this highly divergent
virus in two primate species from the same geographical region, and the ease with which STLVs can be transmitted across
species boundaries all suggest that STLV-3d may be more prevalent and widespread. Given the high human exposure to
nonhuman primates in this region and the unknown pathogenicity of this divergent PTLV-3, increased surveillance and expanded
prevention activities are necessary. Our ability to obtain the complete viral genome from DBS also highlights further the utility
of this method for molecular-based epidemiologic studies.

Background
Simian and human T-lymphotropic viruses (STLV and
HTLV, respectively) are diverse deltaretroviruses now consisting of four broad primate T-lymphotropic virus (PTLV)
groups. PTLV-1, PTLV-2 and PTLV-3 include human
(HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3) and simian (STLV-1,
STLV-2, and STLV-3) viruses, respectively [1-8]. To date, a
total of three individuals from southern Cameroon with
reported nonhuman primate (NHP) exposures were
found to be infected with the recently identified HTLV-3
[1,7,8]. PTLV-4 consists of only HTLV-4 which was
reported from one individual in Cameroon with known
exposure to NHPs [7]. A simian counterpart of this virus
has yet to be identified. Moreover, recent phylogenetic
analyses of a highly divergent STLV-1-like virus from a
captive Macaca arctoides suggest the possibility of a fifth
group, tentatively referred to as PTLV-5 [9]. There is currently no evidence that STLV-5 has crossed into humans.
These recent discoveries of novel HTLVs and STLVs suggest a greater diversity of PTLVs than is currently appreciated.
Both HTLV-1 and -2 have spread globally and are pathogenic human viruses [10-13]. HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell
leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and other
inflammatory diseases in less than 5% of those infected
[2,11,13]. HTLV-2 is less pathogenic than HTLV-1, but has
been associated with a neurologic disease similar to HAM/
TSP [10,12]. The recently discovered HTLV-3 and HTLV-4
viruses have not yet been associated with any diseases, but
molecular analyses of the full-length genomes have identified functional motifs important for viral expression and
possibly oncogenesis [14,15].
STLVs have been identified in diverse Old World monkeys
and apes. STLV-1 has been found in at least 20 different
Old World primate species in Africa and Asia, and phylogenetic analysis shows that STLV-1s cluster by geography
rather than by host species suggesting they are easily transmitted among NHPs [2,3,5,16,17]. There are currently
seven recognized PTLV-1 subtypes (A to G) that are comprised of genetically related HTLV-1 and STLV-1 strains
from different primate species. The close relatedness and
clustering of the various HTLV-1s and STLV-1s into distinct subtypes suggests that at least seven independent
cross-species transmission events formed the genetic
diversity of HTLV-1. Currently STLV-2 is comprised of
only two strains, STLV-2(PP1664) and STLV-2(PanP),
both of which were identified in two different troops of
captive bonobos (Pan paniscus) [6].
Like STLV-1, STLV-3 has a wide geographic distribution
amongst NHPs in Africa [18-27]. Because of the phylogeographical clustering of STLV-3 into distinct clades, four

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/97

separate molecular subtypes have been proposed: East
African (subtype A), West and Central African (subtype
B), and West African (subtype C and D) clades [21]. STLV3 infection has been identified in captive Ethiopian gelada
baboons (Theropithecus gelada) [27], wild sacred baboons
(Papio hamadryas) [25], wild hybrid baboons (P. hamadryas X P. anubis hybrid) [25,27], and captive Eritrean
hamadryas baboons (P. hamadryas) [19], which together
comprise the STLV-3 East African (subtype A) clade. The
STLV-3 West and Central African (subtype B) clade is
made up strains found among Senegalese olive baboons
(P. papio) [21], Cameroonian and Nigerian red-capped
mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus torquatus), and Cameroonian agile mangabeys (Cercocebus agilis) [18,22,23].
Somewhat divergent subtype B STLV-3s have also been
recently identified in grey- cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) and moustached monkeys (Cercopithecus
cephus) in Cameroon although the phylogeny of these
viruses was inferred using relatively short tax and LTR
sequences [20,24]. That all three HTLV-3 strains which
have been recently discovered in Cameroon [1,7,8] cluster
within the STLV-3 subtype B clade is of phylogenetic significance. STLV-3 subtype C consists of divergent viruses
found in Cameroonian spot-nosed guenons (Cercopithecus nictitans) though phylogenetic inference of this
particular clade is limited by analysis of only very short
tax-rex sequences [20,26]. Full-length genomes of STLV-3
subtype C are currently not available. More recently, we
identified a highly divergent STLV-3 strain in Cameroon
from two different primate species, C. mona
(Cmo8699AB) and C. nictitans (Cni78676AB) [24]. Based
on preliminary analysis of partial gene regions, these new
STLVs formed a possible fourth STLV-3 lineage outside all
PTLV-3 subtypes but within the diversity of the PTLV-3
group that we tentatively called STLV-3 subtype D [24].
Both STLV-3(Cmo8699AB) and STLV-3(Cni7867AB)
share 99% sequence homology in the pol, tax, and LTR
regions and cluster together with high bootstrap support
within the STLV-3 subtype D clade [24]. Together, these
findings demonstrate the broad range of NHP host species
susceptible to STLV infection and that STLV diversity is
driven more by phylogeography than by co-divergence
with host species, illustrating the ease with which STLV is
transmitted across species barriers [28,29].
Here, we report the first full-length genome sequence of
STLV-3(Cmo8699AB) from a wild C. mona monkey. We
confirm that this virus is a highly divergent and novel
STLV-3. Across the genome, we found evidence that STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) is unique from other PTLVs. Robust
phylogenetic analysis of major gene regions of STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) as well as new tax sequences from the
divergent STLV-3d(Cni3034) and STLV-3d(Cni3038)
viruses demonstrate that STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) is a
novel and ancient lineage outside the diversity of all

known PTLV-3, thus strongly supporting its subtype D
designation. Detailed examination of the complete
genome predicted that all enzymatic, structural, and regulatory genes were intact. Viral replication and pathogenic
potential shown or hypothesized for other PTLV-3s have
yet to be determined [14,15,30]. Given the inferred
ancient origin of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB), its prevalence in
two primate species from the same geographical region,
and the documented propensity for STLVs to cross species
boundaries, STLV-3d may be more widespread than currently realized. These results underscore an unknown
public health concern for STLV-3d, particularly in a region
with frequent exposure to NHPs through hunting and
butchering.

Methods
DNA preparation and PCR-based genome walking
Using the NucliSens nucleic acid isolation kits
(Biomérieux, Durham, NC) as previously described [24],
nucleic acids were extracted from two dried blood spots
(DBS) each collected by two different hunters from a wildcaught C. mona monkey (Cmo8699AB) and a C. nictitans
monkey (Cni7867AB). Due to the limited DBS material
available, we successfully maximized DNA yield through
additional elution of nucleic acids from the silica beads
with water. DNA from Cni3034 and Cni3038 were prepared from whole blood using the Qiagen DNA extraction
protocol (Valencia, CA). DNA quality and yield were evaluated in a semi-quantitative PCR amplification of the βactin gene as previously described [31,32] and confirmed
with the QuantiT dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). A minimum total input of 10 ng of DNA
was used in each reaction mixture with standard PCR conditions. DNA preparation and PCR assays were performed
in different laboratories specifically equipped for the
processing and testing of only NHP samples according to
established precautions to prevent contamination.

Initially, small fragments of tax (222-bp) and env (371bp) encoding regions of the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB)
genome were PCR-amplified using degenerate, nested
primers, as previously described [14]. Using a PCR-based
genome walking strategy, generic and STLV-3-specific
primers were designed based on the short tax and env
sequences, and the new STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) or STLV3d(Cni7867AB) sequences. Viral sequences > 2kb were
then obtained using the Expand High Fidelity kit (Roche)
following the manufacturer's protocol. For STLV3d(Cmo8699AB), larger tax sequences (658-bp), overlapping sequences at the 3' end of tax to LTR (590-bp), and
the remainder of the LTR (585-bp) were amplified using
external and internal primers in standard PCR conditions
as previously described [24]. Overlapping partial genomic
fragments of the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) proviral genome
and their expected amplicon sizes are shown in Fig. 1 and

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/97

Table 1. Larger tax sequences (1047-bp) were generated
for STLV-3c strains Cni3034 and Cni3038 using previously described forward outer and inner primers (PH1F
and PH2F, respectively) [27] with the reverse outer,
8699LF4R (5'-TGG GTG GTT TAA GGT TTT TTC CGG-3')
and inner primers, 8699LF3R (5'-ACA AGG CAG GGA
GAG ACG TCA GAG-3'), respectively. STLV3d(Cni7867AB) LTR-gag fragments (646-bp) were amplified using P5LF5 (5'-TCA ACC TTT TCT CCC CAA GCG
CCT-3') and P3GR5 (5'-CYG CCT GRG CTA TGA GRG
TCT CAA-3') as outer primer pairs and P5LF6 (5'-GCA
CCT TCG CTT CTC CTG TCC TGG-3') and P3GR7 (5'-GRT
AGG GYG GAG GCT TTT GRG GGT-3') as inner primers
pairs. STLV-3d(Cni7867AB) pol-env fragments (2.3 kb)
were amplified using outer primer pairs 7867GPF2 (5'TCC ACA GAA AAA ACC CAA TCC ACT-3') and
PGENVR1 [7] and 7867GPF3 (5'-CAC TCC TGG TCC CAT
ACA CTT TCT CGG-3') and PGENVR2 [7] inner primer
pairs. The nested primers 9589 F1 (5'-GGC CTR CTC CCG
TGT CAR AAG GA-3') and 9589 R1 (5'-CCC AGG GTT
CTT TAT TTG CTA GTC-3) and 9589 F2 (5'-ACC CCC
GGG CTR ATT TGG ACT-3') and 9589 R2 (5'-GGC AAA
CAT GAG GAA ATG GGT GGT-3') were used to amplify a
436-bp sequence from an STLV-3-infected L. albigena
(Lal9589NL) to generate a 1,510-bp tax-LTR fragment
using the tax and LTR sequences (GenBank accession
numbers EU152289 and EU152277, respectively,
obtained from this animal in another study [24].)
PCR amplicons were purified with Qiaquick PCR or gel
purification kits (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and sequenced
directly using ABI PRISM Big Dye terminator kits (Foster
City, CA) on an ABI 3130xl sequencer or after cloning into
a TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis and dating the origin
of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB)
Comparison of the full-length, gap-stripped PTLV-3
genomes was performed with the SimPlot program (Version 3.5.1) where STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) was the query
sequence using the F84 (ML) model and a transition/
transversion ratio of 2.0 [33]. RNA secondary structure of
the LTR region was predicted using the mfold web server
program [34] found at http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/. Prediction of splice acceptor (sa) and splice donor (sd) sites
was performed using the NetGene2 program available at
the web server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetGene2/
[35]. Identification and analysis of ORFs were performed
using the ORF Finder program available at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/.

Percent nucleotide divergence was calculated using the
DNASTAR MegAlign 7.2 software (http://www.DNAS
TAR.com). For phylogenetic analysis two datasets were
used. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship

between PTLV, the first dataset included tax sequences
from complete PTLV genomes available at GenBank and
the new STLV-3 tax sequences from Cmo8699AB,
Cni7867AB, Cni3034, Cni3038, and Lal9859 obtained in
the current study, respectively. For further phylogenetic
resolution of STLV-3d among PTLV, a larger dataset was
used and included concatenated gag, pol, env, and tax
sequences from complete PTLV genomes available at GenBank and the complete genome of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB)
determined here. Sequences were aligned using the Clustal W program, followed by manual editing and removal
of indels. Nucleotide substitution saturation was assessed
using pair-wise transition and transversion versus divergence plots using the DAMBE program [36]. Unequal
nucleotide composition was measured by using the TREEPUZZLE program [37]. Nucleotide substitution models
and parameters were estimated from the edited Clustal W

sequence alignments by using Modeltest v3.7 [38]. A variant of the general time reversible (GTR) model, which
allows six different substitution rate categories (rA ↔ C =
2.62, rA ↔ G = 13.07, rA ↔ T = 2.79, rC ↔ G = 2.26, rC ↔ T =
4.54, rG ↔ T = 1) with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity (α = 0.7071) and an estimated proportion of invariable sites (0.3436) was determined to best fit the data for
the tax only alignments. The best model for the concatenated gag-pol-env-tax alignment was GTR+G, with six different rate substitutions (rA ↔ C = 2.53, rA ↔ G = 11.47, rA ↔
T = 2.58, rC ↔ G = 2.15, rC ↔ T = 4.3, rG ↔ T = 1) and gammadistributed rate heterogeneity (α = 0.366). Phylogenetic
trees were inferred using Bayesian analysis implemented
in the BEAST software package [39] and with maximum
likelihood (ML) using the PhyML program available
online at the webserver http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/[40].
Support for branching order of the ML-inferred trees was

STLV-3d-specific primers located within each major gene region in combination with generic PTLV primers (fragments B - F).

evaluated using 500 bootstraps. Two independent BEAST
runs consisting of 10 - 100 million Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) generations for the tax only and PTLV concatamer alignments, respectively, with a sampling every
1,000 generations, an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed
molecular clock, and a burn-in of 100,000 to 1 million
generations. Both the constant coalescent and the Yule
process of speciation were used as tree priors to infer the
viral tree topologies. Convergence of the MCMC was
assessed by calculating the effective sampling size (ESS) of
the runs using the program Tracer (v1.4; http://
beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer). All parameter estimates
showed significant ESSs (> 300). The tree with the maximum product of the posterior clade probabilities (maximum clade credibility tree) was chosen from the posterior
distribution of 9,001 sampled trees (after burning in the
first 1,000 sampled trees) with the program TreeAnnota-

tor version 1.4.6 included in the BEAST software package
[40]. Trees were viewed and edited using FigTree v1.1.2
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree.
Divergence dates for the most recent common ancestor
(MRCA) of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) were obtained by
using both the tax only and the concatenated gag-pol-envtax alignments, using Bayesian inference and using a
relaxed molecular clock in the BEAST program. The PTLV
evolutionary rate assumed a global molecular clock
model and was estimated according to the formula: evolutionary rate (r) = branch length (bl)/divergence time (t)
[27]. Divergence dates were obtained from well-established genetic and archaeological evidence for the timing
of migration of the ancestors of indigenous Melanesians
and Australians from Southeast Asia [14,16,29,41]. The
PTLV evolutionary rate was estimated by using the diver-

gence time of 40,000 - 60,000 years ago (ya) for the Melanesian HTLV-1 lineage (HTLV-1mel) and 15,000-30,000
ya for the most recent common ancestor of HTLV-2a/
HTLV-2b native American strains as strong priors in a
Bayesian MCMC relaxed molecular clock method implemented in the BEAST software package [39]. The use of
two calibration points has previously been shown to provide more reliable estimates of PTLV substitution rates
than a single calibration date [41,42]. The upper and
lower divergence times estimated from anthropological
data were used to define the interval of a strong uniform
prior distribution from which the MCMC sampler would
sample possible divergence times for the corresponding
node in the tree.
Nucleotide accession numbers
The STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) complete proviral genome
has the GenBank accession number EU231644. Partial
STLV-3d genomic sequences obtained from monkey
Cni7867AB were assigned the GenBank accession numbers FJ957879 (LTR-partial gag) and FJ957880 (pol-partial
env). Longer tax sequences obtained from STLV3d(Cni7867AB), STLV-3c(Cni3034), STLV-3c(Cni3038),
and STLV-3b(Lal9589NL) have the GenBank accession
numbers EU152281, FJ957877, FJ957878, and
GQ241937, respectively.

Results
Comparison of the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) proviral genome
with prototypical PTLVs
The complete STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) proviral genome
was obtained entirely from two DBS using a PCR-based
genome walking approach to generate nine overlapping
subgenomic fragments (Fig 1). The complete STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) proviral genome was determined to be

8913-bp. Comparing the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) genome
with other prototypical PTLVs suggests that this virus is
highly divergent and has equidistant nucleotide identity
from PTLV-1 (62%), PTLV-2 (64%), PTLV-4 (64%), and
PTLV-5 (62%). Compared to the PTLV-3 group, STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) has only 77% identity to prototypical
HTLV-3s and STLV-3s (Table 2), sharing the highest nucleotide identity (77.3%) with HTLV-3(Pyl43). Complete
genomes are not available for the recently reported STLV3 subtype C sequences, Cni217 and Cni227 [26] and
Cni3034 and Cni3038 [20] for comparison. However, we
were able to generate longer tax sequences for STLV3c(Cni3034; 1047-bp) and STLV-3c(Cni3038; 1048-bp),
both of which shared 99% identity with each other and
which shared 95% nucleotide identity with STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) and about 83% identity with PTLV-3
subtypes A and B in this highly conserved region. Like
STLV-3c and STLV3d subtypes, tax sequences from PTLV3 subtypes A and B are very similar sharing about 92%
nucleotide identity.
The predicted Tax and Gag proteins of STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) were the most conserved proteins with
the highest similarity (90 and 89%, respectively) to other
prototypical PTLV-3 strains (Table 2). The highest genetic
divergence between STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) and other
PTLV-3s was found in the non-coding LTR region (2629%), and in the protease (Pro) (21-24%) and Rex (28 31%) proteins (Table 2). These genetic relationships are
further illustrated in a similarity plot analysis comparing
STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) with other prototypical PTLV-3s
across the entire genome (Fig. 2), where the highest and
lowest sequence identities were observed in the tax and
LTR regions, respectively.

Similarity
Similarity plot analysis of the full-length STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) and prototypical PTLV-3 genomes using a
200-bp window size in 20 step increments on gap-stripped sequences. The F84 (maximum likelihood) model was
used with an estimated transition-to-transversion ratio of 2.28. HTLV-3b(Pyl43) was not included in the analysis because of its
high identity (> 99%) to STLV-3b(CTO604) and because of a 366-bp deletion in the pX region of this virus [15].

Evolutionary relationship of STLV-3d to other PTLVs
Analysis of the two PTLV datasets for nucleotide substitution saturation using pair-wise transition and transversion
versus divergence plots revealed that transitions and transversions plateaued at the 3rd codon positions (cdp) indicating sequence saturation (data not shown) as previously
observed [42]. In contrast, transitions and transversions
increased linearly for the 1st and 2nd cdp without reaching
a plateau indicating they still retained enough phylogenetic signal (data not shown). The BEAST and PhyML programs were then used to infer phylogenetic relationships
of PTLV sequences using only 1st and 2nd cdp and the bestfit parameters defined above. The final nucleotide alignment lengths were 630-bp and 4126-bp for the tax only
and viral concatamer sequences, respectively. Robust phylogenetic analysis of concatenated gag-pol-env-tax STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) (Fig. 3) and tax sequences (Fig. 4) as

well as sequences from other PTLV inferred a novel PTLV3 subtype with very high posterior probabilities and bootstrap support. STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) formed a distinct
lineage from known PTLV-3 East African (subtype A) and
West and Central African (subtype B) clades (Fig 3). Fulllength genome sequences were not available for West African STLV-3c found in four C. nictitans or from STLV-3b
sequences identified in L. albigena and C. cephus from
Cameroon [20,26] for these analyses. However, phylogenetic analysis using longer tax sequences we obtained
from two of these STLV-3 subtype C viruses (Cni3034 and
Cni3038) and from a single L. albigena (Lal9859NL)
indeed inferred a fourth distinct molecular subtype containing the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) and Cni7867AB tax
sequences (Fig. 4). The new STLV-3(Lal9589NL) sequence
clustered with other subtype B sequences from West-Central Africa (Fig. 4). Moreover, we identified another STLV-

3 subtype D strain, STLV-3d(Cni7867AB) from a C. nictitans in the same geographic region that has 99% identity
to STLV-3(Cmo8699AB) in the LTR-gag, pol-env, and taxLTR regions and clusters tightly within the STLV-3 subtype
D clade (Fig. 4). Combined, these results strongly support
the identification and taxonomic classification of STLV3(Cmo8699AB) and STLV-3(Cni7867AB) as a new PTLV3 subtype. As has been shown before using individual
genes, the phylogeny of the PTLV-3 clade in relation to
PTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-4 was not completely resolved
in the current Bayesian inference and clustered weakly
with PTLV-2 and PTLV-4 using the gag-pol-env-tax concatamer and with PTLV-1 when using the tax only dataset
(Figs. 3, 4).
Divergence dates for the most recent common ancestor of
STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB)
Additional molecular analyses were performed to estimate the divergence times of the MRCA of the potential
new PTLV-3 subtype lineage using the 1st and 2nd cdp
alignments and Bayesian inference and two independent
fossil calibration points. The posterior mean evolutionary

rate for PTLV was estimated to be 6.29 × 10-7 and 5.36 ×
10-7 substitutions/site/year (Table 3) for the concatenated
gene and the tax only alignments, respectively, which is
consistent with rates determined previously both with
and without enforcing a molecular clock [14,2123,29,41]. The mean MRCA of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) is
inferred to have split from PTLV-3a and PTLV-3b 115,117
ya (52,822 - 200,926 ya, 95% high posterior distribution
(HPD)) based on the PTLV concatamer alignments (Table
3) suggesting that this is the oldest PTLV-3 lineage identified to date. Using the conserved tax only alignment STLV3c and STLV-3d shared a common ancestor about 18,452
ya (4,386 - 36,666 ya 95% HPD) compared to 41,524 ya
(17,149 - 68,097 ya 95% HPD) for divergence of STLV-3a
and -b (Table 3). The inferred mean MRCA for the PTLV3 group is 75,795 ya (33,342 - 127,209 ya 9% HPD) and
120,574 ya (52,894 - 201,260 ya 95% HPD) based on the
tax only and PTLV concatamer alignments, respectively.
The divergence dates for PTLV-3 inferred in the current
analyses are higher than those reported previously
because our analyses include the two new highly divergent STLV-3c and -d viruses which increase substantially

dates are consistent with those obtained recently using 1st
and 2nd cdp of individual PTLV genes, including the finding of lower divergence dates using only highly conserved
tax genes [42].
Genomic organization of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) and
identification of conserved functional motifs
With regulatory and structural proteins flanked by long
terminal repeats (LTRs) (Fig. 1), the genomic organization
of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) resembles that of other prototypical replication competent PTLV strains. The STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) LTR is 708-bp in length (Fig. 5) and as
seen with other PTLV-3s, the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) LTR
has two rather than the three highly conserved 21-bp taxresponsive element (TRE) repeat sequences found in
HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 LTRs (Fig. 5). Conserved in all PTLV3s, the cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) motif
(TGACGTC) [43] is present in the central TRE (nt 118 124) (where nt stands for nucleotide) (Fig. 5) that has
been shown to be critical for binding of Tax and activation
of gene expression [44]. Conserved regulatory motifs such
as the polyadenylation signal (nt 221 - 225), TATA box (nt
239 - 242), cap site (nt 266 - 267), and splice donor site
(nt 413 - 414) are all present in the STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) LTR (Fig. 5). Similar to HTLV-3(Pyl43),
STLV-3(PH969),
STLV-3(TGE-2117)
and
STLV3(CTO604), the activation protein-1 (AP-1) site is preserved in STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) (Fig. 5). The conserved
primer binding site (PBS) for PTLV, a 19-bp region
between the 5' LTR and the gag gene and which allows
reverse transcriptase to initiate synthesis of the viral DNA,
is also present in STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB). Likewise, the
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) binding site [TAG(G/A)(G/A)A] (nt 508 - 513), which
has been suggested to play a critical role in RNA splicing
and modulation of HTLV-1 gene expression [45], and the
c-Myb (YAACKG) and pre-B-cell leukemia (Pbx-1,
TGACAG) transcription factor binding sites associated
with leukemogenesis [46] are all found in the LTR of
STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB). The c-Myb and Pbx-1 sites are
also present in the LTRs of STLV-3(CTO604), HTLV3(Pyl43), STLV-2, and HTLV-4 [42]. The predicted RNA
secondary structure of the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) LTR
shows a stable stem-loop structure from nucleotides 427 462 containing the rex responsive element (RexRE) which
plays a critical role in the polyadenylation of PTLV transcripts for viral gene expression (Fig. 6).
STLV-3d proteome analysis
The predicted protein translation of the STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) genome revealed all major structural
and enzymatic (Gag, Pro, Pol, and Env) and regulatory
proteins (Tax and Rex) (Fig. 1 and Table 2). Analysis of the
overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) of gag and pro

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/97

and pro and pol predicts that translation occurs by one or
more successive -1 ribosomal frameshifts that align different ORFs. The conserved-slippage sequence (6(A)-8 nt6(G)-11 nt-6(C) can be found in the gag-pro overlap of
STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB). The pro-pol overlap slippage
sequence has the same point mutation found among the
other prototypical PTLV-3s (GTTAAAC versus TTTAAAC in
HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-4). Comparable to other
PTLV-3s, the Gag protein of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) is
composed of 420 amino acids (aa) and is predicted to
cleave into three core protein products: p19 (matrix), p24
(capsid), and p15 (nucleocapsid). One of the most highly
conserved PTLV domains, the Gag protein of STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) has > 88% similarity to that of prototypical PTLV-3 subtypes (Table 2). The highest amino acid
similarity to other PTLV-3 subtypes is found in the p24
capsid protein (94 - 96%), while the p15 nucleocapsid
protein was the most divergent (80 - 83%).
The predicted length of the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) Env
glycoprotein is 493 aa, similar to the Env protein of STLV3b(CtoNG604) and HTLV-3b(Pyl43) (10, 35). The surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) proteins are comparable to all other PTLV-3 subtypes at 315 aa and 178 aa,
respectively. The TM protein is highly conserved across
PTLV-3 subtypes (90 - 92% similarity) including STLV3d(Cmo8699AB). The high aa identity of the Gag p24 and
Env proteins suggests that this divergent virus would be
cross-reactive on standard HTLV-1/2 Western blot (WB)
assays. Unfortunately, serum or plasma was not available
from animals Cmo8699AB and Cni7867AB to confirm
this hypothesis. The STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) SU also contains highly conserved residues believed important for
viral entry (data not shown) similar to those described
recently for HTLV-3b(Pyl43) [47].
PTLV Tax proteins are important for the trans-activation of
viral gene expression, viral replication and viral pathogenesis. Comparison of the Tax proteins of prototypical
PTLVs and STLV-3d revealed the conservation of critical
functional motifs including the nuclear localization signal
(NLS), cAMP response element (CREB) binding protein
(CBP)/P300 binding motifs, and nuclear export signal
(NES) motifs (data not shown). Amino acid sequences
(M1, M22, and M47) that are important for Tax1 transactivation and activation of κβ (NF-κβ) pathway [48] are
also preserved in the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) and STLV3d(Cni7867AB) Tax proteins (data not shown). The C-terminal transcriptional activating domain (CR2) at positions 313 - 318 of the protein is important for CBP/P300
binding and up-regulation of transcription and is also
present. The CR2 motif [(S/T)T(V/I)PFS] is conserved
among all PTLV-3 subtypes and is identical to those found
in STLV-3a subtypes. In the Tax C-terminus, STLV-3d also
possesses a conserved PDZ-binding motif present in

[14,30,42,49,50]. The PDZ domain has been shown to be
an important binding site for Tax in mediating signal
transduction and interleukin-2-independent growth
induction for T-cell transformation [50,51]. Taken

together, preservation of the predicted STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) Tax protein sequence motifs suggests
Tax interactions with cellular regulatory pathways similar
to those of both PTLV-1 and PTLV-3. All functional
motifs, including a potential PDZ domain, are present in

the cytoplasm [52,53]. However, like HTLV-2 and HTLV4, the Rex protein of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) has an
alanine (A) at position 94 instead of the glycine (G) found
in HTLV-3b(Pyl43) and STLV-3b(CTONG409) or aspartic
acid (D) present in all other PTLV-3s.

the STLV-3d Tax, although 12 aa residues are missing from
the N-terminus of the Tax proteins of STLV-3c(Cni3034
and Cni3038) obtained in the current study. This suggests
that these motifs are highly conserved among the very
divergent PTLV-3 group (data not shown).
While comparable in length to other PTLV-3s, the 182 aa
Rex protein of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) is the most divergent viral protein sharing only about 70% similarity. The
activation domain/NES (DALSARLYNTLSLDSPP) (aa 81 97) is an important motif conserved in all PTLVs for shuttling unspliced viral RNA transcripts from the nucleus to

gene expression with two of the open reading frames
(ORFs) encoding for the ubiquitous Tax and Rex proteins
[54]. Two putative splice donor sites with high confidence
were predicted at positions 414 and 5058 in the LTR (sdLTR) and Env (sd-Env), respectively, that code for the Env
protein (Fig. 1). A conserved splice acceptor site is located
at position 7552 that with the sd-Env site code for the singly spliced Tax and Rex proteins (Fig. 1). The positions of
these putative splice junction sites are similar to those of
other PTLV-3s [14,15,21-23,27]. Analysis of the pX region
of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) revealed only a single additional ORF (ORFI that begins with a methionine and is
predicted to code for a proteins of 131 aa in length (Fig.
1)), in contrast to other PTLV-3s which have been predicted to have at least two additional ORFs in the pX
region. BLAST analysis of the ORFI protein resulted in
matches to miscellaneous fungal and mammalian proteins with very low identity (< 30%). Further studies are
required to evaluate the function of the ORFI viral protein.
In vivo studies have demonstrated that the recently characterized basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor found on the
complementary minus-strand of the HTLV-1 RNA
genome [55] can enhance viral infectivity and persistence
[56]. Although originally discovered in HTLV-1 [55] and
thus called the HTLV-1 bZIP (HBZ) protein, putative HBZ
proteins have also been reported for all other PTLVs
[14,15,42]. Consequently it has been proposed that HBZ
be renamed as the HTLV antisense protein (ASP) [57]. As
with other PTLVs, the ASP ORF of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB)
has a 21-aa arginine-rich region followed by 4 conserved
leucine heptads and a leucine octet (Fig. 7), suggesting a
similar inactivation pathway of cyclic AMP response element (CREB-2) and therefore, down-regulation of viral
transcription [14,55]. Interestingly, the first "leucine"
heptad in HTLV-1 and other PTLVs starts with another
nonpolar amino acid: phenylalanine. This is unlike the
leucine typically found in mammalian bZIP proteins. ASP
has also been reported to modulate Tax activity by binding to the transcription factors JunB and c-Jun [58] as well
as the ubiquitous AP-1 regulatory element [59]. The finding of an AP-1 site in the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) LTR may
be a novel method for the regulation of viral transcription
by ASP, as recently suggested for HTLV-3b(2026ND) [14].
Additional studies are necessary to validate and investigate a role for ASP in Tax expression and PTLV replication.

Discussion
Screening of human populations with high exposure to
NHPs has resulted in the successful discovery of novel retroviruses, including HTLV-3, HTLV-4, and simian foamy
virus (SFV) [1,7,8,32]. We have previously demonstrated
that hunter-collected DBS specimens from wild-caught
NHPs are not only an effective collection strategy to demonstrate STLV diversity but also allow for monitoring of
retroviral cross-species transmission events at the primatehunter interface [24]. Using these primate DBS specimens, we recently identified novel STLV-3s in wild-caught
C. mona and C. nictitans monkeys by analysis of partial
gene sequences [24]. To characterize this new virus, we
obtained its complete proviral genome using nucleic acids
extracted entirely from two DBS, collected by two hunters
in the field. To our knowledge, this is the first full-length
genome of a simian retrovirus obtained entirely from
DBS. The ability to generate a complete viral genome from
the equivalent of about 0.25 ml whole blood demonstrates further the utility of this collection strategy for
monitoring and characterizing viral diversity.
Robust phylogenetic analysis of both the conserved tax
region and gag-pol-env-tax concatenated sequences
inferred a novel lineage with high statistical support
within the PTLV-3 clade that is highly divergent. The formation of a fourth lineage within the diversity of PTLV-3,
containing STLV-3 sequences from two distinct primate
species (C. mona and C. nictitans), strongly supports the
proposed nomenclature and classification of this new
virus as STLV-3 subtype D. The discovery of nearly identical STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB and Cni7867AB) viruses in two
different primate species within the same region of Cameroon and the inferred ancient divergence of STLV-3d
about 115,000 ya also suggests a higher prevalence and a
more widespread distribution for this virus.
Our results also suggest that taxonomic subdivision
within the current subtype B strains is warranted. PTLV-3
from Cameroon (STLV-3(Cto604), HTLV-3(Pyl43), and
HTLV-3(Lobak18)) are distantly related to other PTLV-3

subtype B strains from West-Central Africa ((HTLV3(Cam2026ND), STLV-3(NG409), STLV-3(PPAF3), and
STLV-3(Lal9589NL) sharing < 90% nucleotide identity.
Since both PTLV-3 lineages are presently known as B subtypes, we propose re-naming them as subtypes B1 (from
Cameroon only) and B2 (from West-Central Africa). A
similar nomenclature strategy has been previously
adopted for subtyping HTLV-2 [60]. This re-classification
and the categorization of the new STLV-3 subtype D are
based upon highly supported phylogenetic division of
these subtypes and genetic distances of at least 5% across
the genome, as recently proposed for PTLV classification
[42].
PTLVs have an ancient evolutionary history with the
ancestral HTLVs being inferred to have first occurred
many thousands of years ago following zoonotic transmission from STLV-infected NHPs [14,24,29,42,61]. This
finding contrasts with the relatively recent emergence of
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from simian
immunodeficiency virus-infected NHPs in the last century
[62,63]. The recent discovery of HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 and
novel STLV-1-like viruses among people who hunt and
butcher NHPs suggests that these interspecies transmission events are not rare and are most likely contemporaneous [1,7]. From phylogenetic analysis it has been
inferred that STLV-1 may have crossed species boundaries
to humans on at least seven separate occasions resulting
in the multiple HTLV-1 subtypes [28]. Given the inferred
ancient origin of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) and PTLV-3, the
wide geographic distribution of STLV-3 across Africa, the
long history of human exposure to simians in Africa and
the lack of screening for HTLV in blood banks in Africa,
human infections with STLV-3d-like viruses might be
expected to occur there. Thus, although HTLV-3 so far has
only been identified in three persons from Cameroon and
all three are subtype B viruses, it is tempting to speculate
that like HTLV-1 diversity, HTLV-3 diversity will be driven
by transmission of each of the four STLV-3 subtypes to
humans. More surveillance studies at the NHP-human
interface are needed to determine the prevalence, diver-

sity, and epidemiology of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) and
HTLV-3.
Molecular differences between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 Tax
proteins have been proposed to modulate function, transmissibility, and pathogenesis [61]. We therefore examined the predicted protein sequences of STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) to determine whether important functional and regulatory motifs were present to infer the replication-competency and pathogenic potential for this
divergent viral subtype. All enzymatic, structural, and regulatory
proteins
were
preserved
in
STLV3d(Cmo8699AB), including the ubiquitous Tax binding
domains CBP/P300, NES, and CR2, which are all important for viral transcription and transformation [64-66]. In
addition, the presence of a PDZ-binding motif in the
STLV-3d Tax, which has been shown to be critical in signal
transduction and T-cell transformation of HTLV-1infected cells [50,51], suggests that the STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) Tax is more similar to the Tax of PTLV1 and other PTLV-3s, than it is to the Tax of PTLV-2 which
lacks a PDZ motif [14,42]. Furthermore, as has been demonstrated with all PTLVs, STLV-3d also possesses a conserved ASP basic leucine zipper motif in the antisense
strand between the env and tax/rex gene regions. ASP has
been shown to participate in regulation of viral replication and possibly oncogenesis [50,51]. Combined, these
findings show that the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) genome is
intact, is likely to be replication competent, and may have
a pathogenic potential similar to HTLV-1 which is also
predicted for HTLV-3 subtype B; however, further studies
are required to validate this hypothesis.
The LTR region of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) has two of the
three 21-bp repeat Tax-responsive elements (TRE) typically found in the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 LTRs. The three
TREs (distal, central, and proximal) are involved in basal
transcription and have been shown to confer Tax1, Tax2,
and Tax3 responsiveness [67]. Studies have also shown
that mutations in the central TRE compared to the distal
or proximal TRE-1 result in the greatest loss of basal transcription levels [68]. As with all PTLV-3s, the STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) LTR lacks only the distal TRE, which
does not appear to have deleterious effects on gene expression and viral replication [30,69]. Nonetheless, more
studies are necessary to determine if these differences will
affect
the
transcriptional
activity
of
STLV3d(Cmo8699AB).
Another notable difference of STLV-3d from other PTLV3s was observed in the leucine-rich activation region of
the putative NES domain of the Rex protein involved in
regulation of viral expression. STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) has
a single aa mutation from aspartic acid or glycine to
alanine at position 94 similar to that seen in the HTLV-2

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/97

Rex protein (Rex2). Mutagenesis studies substituting
alanine for serine residues in this region have demonstrated a significant reduction in the phosphorylation activation required for efficient RNA binding of Rex-2 [70].
These results suggest that the alanine mutation at aa position 94 of the STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) Rex may also have
a similar loss of biologic activity. The effects of these
changes on the processing of viral transcripts and regulation of viral replication by the STLV-3d Rex will require
further investigation.

Conclusion
In summary, complete genome analysis of STLV3d(Cmo8699) reveals this novel virus is a highly divergent member of the PTLV-3 group that we name subtype
D. We show by robust genetic analysis that STLV3d(Cmo8699AB) has an ancient origin and an intact
genome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that complete
viral genomes can be obtained using limited amounts of
genomic material extracted from DBS collected in the
field. This collection strategy will facilitate the monitoring
of viral diversity and cross-species transmission at the
human-primate interface. Expanded surveillance will help
us to better understand the epidemiology and public
health importance of STLV zoonoses.
