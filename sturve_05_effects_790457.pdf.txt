Abstract
Background: DT diaphorase (DTD; NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.2) catalyses
the two electron reduction of quinones, thus preventing redox cycling and consequently quinone
dependent production of reactive oxygen species. In rat and mouse, a wide range of chemicals
including polyaromatic hydrocarbons, azo dyes and quinones induces DTD. Bifunctional
compounds, such as β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), induce DTD together
with CYP1A and phase II enzymes by a mechanism involving the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).
Monofunctional induction of DTD is mediated through the antioxidant response element and does
not lead to the induction of AHR dependent enzymes, such as CYP1A. The aim of this study was
to investigate the effects of prooxidants (both bifunctional and monofunctional) on the activity of
hepatic DTD in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in order to evaluate DTD suitability as a
biomarker. We also investigated the effect of β-NF on hepatic DTD activity in perch (Perca
fluviatilis), shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), brown trout
(Salmo trutta) and carp (Cyprinus carpio). In addition, the effect of short term exposure to
prooxidants on catalase activity was investigated.
Results: In rainbow trout, hepatic DTD activity is induced by the bifunctional AHR agonists β-NF
and B(a)P and the monofunctional inducers naphthazarin, menadione and paraquat. Although
exposure to both B(a)P and β-NF led to a strong 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD)
induction, none of the monofunctional compounds affected the rainbow trout EROD activity. DTD
was not induced by β-NF in any of the other fish species. Much higher DTD activities were
observed in rainbow trout compared to the other fish species. Catalase activity was less responsive
to short term exposure to prooxidants compared to DTD.
Conclusion: Since rainbow trout hepatic DTD activity is inducible by both monofunctional and
bifunctional inducers, it is suggested that rainbow trout DTD may be regulated by the same
mechanisms, as in mammals. The fact that DTD is inducible in rainbow trout suggests that the
enzyme may be suitable as a part of a biomarker battery when rainbow trout is used in
environmental studies. It appears as if DTD activity in rainbow trout is higher and inducible
compared to the other fish species studied.

Background
The aquatic environment is exposed to a great number of
pollutants. Effluents from industries and sewage treatment plants as well as drainage from urban and agricultural areas contain pollutants that may damage aquatic
life. A large part of these compounds exert their toxic effect
by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing oxidative stress [1]. Compounds such as quinones, certain
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) metabolites and
bipyridils generate ROS through their ability to redox
cycle, a process where an enzymatic one electron reduction of the parent compound is followed by an autooxidation in the presence of molecular oxygen [2]. In this
reaction, the oxygen will be reduced to a superoxide ion
that can lead to the formation of other ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals [3]. ROS
causes cell injury by oxidizing lipids, proteins and DNA
leading to membrane damage, enzyme malfunction and/
or tumor formation. The cell has evolved an antioxidant
defense system consisting of antioxidant enzymes and
molecules as a defense against oxidative damage. Failure
of the antioxidant system to counteract ROS mediated
damage, either due to an increased ROS production or a
malfunctioning antioxidant defense, will lead to a state of
oxidative stress with concomitant oxidative damage [3].
Responses to xenobiotics, including molecular or biochemical changes or cellular damage are used as biomarkers of exposure or injurious effects [4]. Several field
studies show changes in antioxidant enzyme activities and
levels of antioxidant molecules, as well as oxidative damage, in fish from areas supposedly exposed to prooxidants
[1,5,6]. Both short term and heritable tolerance of killifish
(Fundulus heteroclitus) to toxic sediments in the Elisabeth
river (VA, USA) was suggested to be partly due to an
upregulation of the antioxidant defence system [7].
The antioxidant defense system is generally less responsive to xenobiotics compared to other biomarkers such as
the cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) mediated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity [4]. Despite this
fact, and since oxidative stress is an important mechanism
in the pathology of fish, it would be of interest to establish
new oxidative stress biomarkers in aquatic organisms. Elevated rates of idiopathic lesions and neoplasia in fish
from polluted sites were suggested to be related to pollutant induced oxidative stress [2]. DT diaphorase (DTD;
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase; NQO1; EC 1.6.99.2)
was proposed as a biomarker for quinones in the aquatic
environment [8]. Quinones are of interest due to their
widespread occurrence in the environment, both naturally as metabolites in plants as well as environmental
contaminants, such as quinonoid metabolites derived
from benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons [9-11].

DTD is a mainly cytosolic flavoenzyme that catalyzes the
two-electron reduction of quinones into hydroquinones,
thus counteracting redox cycling of prooxidants. Hydroquinones are more stable and less likely to undergo
autooxidation [12-15]. DTD is characterized by its ability
to utilize both NADH and NADPH as electron donors and
to be inhibited by the anticoagulant dicoumarol [16]. In
mammals, DTD can be induced by monofunctional and
bifunctional inducers together with other phase II
enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GST)
[17,18]. In mouse, the two regulatory elements ARE (antioxidant responsive element) and XRE (xenobiotic responsive element) have been found on the 5' promoter region
of the NQO1 gene, and the XRE shows significant homology to the CYP1A1 XRE [19]. Monofunctional DTD induction is mediated through the ARE, whereas bifunctional
compounds can induce DTD activity by two different
mechanisms: (i) directly via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AHR) acting on the XRE on the NQO1 gene; or (ii)
through electrophilic metabolites from the CYP1A1 phase
1 reaction acting on the ARE [18]. Bifunctional inducers
consist of large planar aromatic compounds, such as
PAHs, whereas monofunctional inducers are a diverse
group of chemicals with a majority containing, or acquiring by metabolism, a Michael reaction acceptor structure
[20]. Although DTD has been proposed as a biomarker for
quinones and redox cycling compounds in fish [8], few
studies address the effects of prooxidants on DTD in fish.
The aim of the present study was to study the effect of the
monofunctional inducers paraquat (PQ), menadione
(MN) and naphtazarin (5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone; DHNQ), and of the bifunctional inducers β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), on the
catalytic activity of DTD in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) liver. The aim was also to investigate the suitability
of rainbow trout DTD as a biomarker for redox cycling
compounds. β-NF, which proved to be a potent inducer of
DTD activity in rainbow trout, was also chosen to study
the inducibility of DTD in other fish species used as sentinel species in monitoring studies. These fishes were the
perch (Perca fluviatilis), shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus
scorpius), eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), brown trout (Salmo
trutta), and carp (Cyprinus carpio). In addition, we studied
the effects of prooxidants on the activities of catalase and
EROD. Catalase metabolizes H2O2 into molecular oxygen
and water [21] and EROD reflects the catalytic activity of
the phase I detoxifying enzyme CYP1A [22].

NF exposed groups, although the increase was only significant in the group exposed to the high dose (15 mg Kg-1)
and after 5 days (Table 1). Treatment with a high B(a)P
dose (15 mg Kg-1) also caused increased DTD activity after
5 days (Table 1).
Among the monofunctional inducers studied MN was the
only one to cause a significant increase in DTD activity
after 2 days (Table 1). After 2 days exposure to the low
dose (5 mg Kg-1) of MN, rainbow trout displayed a significant increase in DTD activity, whereas no change was
observed in the group exposed to a high dose (15 mg Kg1) of MN. The same pattern was observed after 5 days
exposure with a significant increase in DTD activity in the
low dose (5 mg Kg-1) group and no increase in DTD activity in the group exposed to a high dose (15 mg Kg-1) of
MN. The fish exposed to PQ showed the same trend as the
MN exposed fish, with lower DTD activity in the high dose
groups compared to the low dose groups. After 2 days
exposure, DTD activity increased in the group treated with
a low dose of PQ (3 mg Kg-1) but the difference was not
statistically significant. After 5 days treatment, both the
low and the high dose groups (3 and 10 mg Kg-1) displayed significantly higher DTD activity compared to the
control group, even though the high dose group displayed
lower DTD activity than the low dose group (Table 1).
DHNQ treatment led to an increase in DTD activity in
both the low dose (1 mg Kg-1) and the high dose (3 mg Kg1) groups, after 5 days exposure (Table 1).

EROD activity
EROD activity was significantly and strongly increased in
all groups treated with β-NF and B(a)P (both low and
high dose and after 2 and 5 days) (Table 1). The monofunctional inducers PQ and MN treatment did not affect
EROD activity, whereas the group exposed to the high
dose of DHNQ (15 mg Kg-1) displayed a significant reduction in EROD activity after 5 days exposure (Table 1).
Catalase activity
PQ caused a significant decrease in catalase activity in the
high dose groups (after both 2 and 5 days exposure) and
a significant increase in the low dose group after 5 days
exposure (Tab. 1). B(a)P, β-NF, MN and DHNQ caused
no statistically significant effects on the catalase activity
(Table 1).
Comparison of DTD activity in different fish species
In contrast to rainbow trout, DTD activity did not increase
in perch, carp, brown trout, eelpout or shorthorn sculpin
treated with a high dose (15 mg Kg-1) of β-NF for 5 days.
The DTD activity in these fishes was considerably lower
compared to DTD activity in rainbow trout (Table 2).

Discussion

The effects of β-NF and B(a)P on cellular defense systems
have been extensively studied in fish, including rainbow
trout. Both compounds have proved to be potent AHR
agonists inducing enzymes in the CYP system, especially

CYP1A [22]. Most studies in fish address effects of these
compounds on the CYP system and relatively few have
investigated effects on oxidative stress parameters.
Stephensen et al. [23] demonstrated, in a short term study
in rainbow trout liver, that treatment with 15 mg Kg-1 of
β-NF caused a moderate increase in cytosolic glutathione
reductase (GR) activity and a decrease in the cytosolic GST
activity. Longer exposure to a higher dose of β-NF (50 mg
Kg-1 for 14 days) increases GST activity in rainbow trout
[24]. Regoli et al. [25] showed that both β-NF and B(a)P
increased GR activity in European eel (Anguilla anguilla)
liver, whereas both compounds suppressed GST and catalase activities, indicating an increase in oxidative stress
caused by these two AHR agonists. Some AHR agonists
can also induce DTD activity in rainbow trout. Förlin et al.
[26] observed in a long term study of rainbow trout that
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) caused an increase in DTD activity. It has
previously been demonstrated that also β-NF induces
DTD activity in rainbow trout [27]. In the present study,
both β-NF and B(a)P caused an increase in hepatic DTD
activity in rainbow trout. β-NF and B(a)P also caused a
strong increase in the CYP1A mediated EROD activity in
all exposed groups indicating strong AHR activation. The
fact that exposure to the bifunctional inducers β-NF and
B(a)P induced both DTD and CYP1A activities implies
that the DTD induction can be mediated through activation of the AHR. In mammals, it has been demonstrated
that both β-NF and B(a)P induce DTD activity [28,29].
Both compounds are classified as bifunctional since they
induce DTD activity (via a mechanism involving the AHR)
and have electrophilic metabolites that induce DTD activity (via the ARE) [18]. Therefore, the results obtained in
this study imply that rainbow trout DTD activity can be
induced by a mechanism involving the AHR, as in mammals. It is not yet known whether the promoter region of

the rainbow trout DTD gene contains functional XRE or
ARE. Thus, it is not clear whether the observed induction
of DTD activity is mediated directly by the AHR, through
the XRE, or it is caused by metabolites acting as monofunctional inducers through the ARE, or even whether
both mechanism coexist. This should be investigated in
future studies.
Relatively few studies address the effects of monofunctional inducers on oxidative stress parameters in fish.
Stephensen et al. [23] investigated the effects on glutathione and glutathione dependent enzymes in rainbow
trout exposed to the monofunctional inducers PQ, MN
and DHNQ. All three compounds induced the catalytic
activities of GR and GST, PQ being the most potent
inducer. DHNQ also induced the activities of glutathione
peroxidase and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the ratelimiting enzyme in the glutathione synthesis. The same
study also showed that glutathione levels were increased
after exposure to PQ and MN. In the present study, the
monofunctional inducers DHNQ, MN and PQ elevated
hepatic DTD activity in rainbow trout, but none of those
compounds induced EROD activity. This suggests that
DTD activity in rainbow trout may be induced through an
oxidant responsive element resembling the mammalian
AREs. A study by Samson et al. [30] suggests that H2O2
dependent metallothionein induction in rainbow trout
was mediated through ARE-like sequences on the metallothionein gene.
Our results show that high doses of prooxidants can lead
to a decrease in DTD activity. Exposure to high doses of
both PQ and MN resulted in lower DTD activities compared to exposure to low doses. Previous studies have
shown that PQ is a potent redox cycler, strongly inducing
GR and G6PDH activities [23,31]. The effect on G6PDH
activity suggests that PQ exposure lead to the depletion of
NADPH, a molecule crucial to the redox state in the cell
and a cofactor in the catalytic activity of DTD and CYP1A
enzymes. However, since DTD can also utilize NADH as
an electron donor, the NADPH depletion should not
affect DTD activity. The lower DTD activities in the rainbow trout exposed to high doses of MN and PQ, when
compared to activities from animals exposed to lower
doses, could be due to an overproduction of ROS; causing
an oxidation dependent malfunction of the DTD enzyme.
Our results also show that catalase activity was decreased
after the exposure to a high dose of PQ. Catalase can be
partially inhibited by the ROS superoxide [3] and it is possible that also DTD is affected by a similar mechanism. In
contrast, exposure to a high dose of DHNQ led to a
decrease in EROD activity and an increase in DTD activity
in rainbow trout. As previously reported [32,33], the
decrease in EROD activity could be due to ROS mediated
inactivation of the CYP1A enzyme.

A great number of evidence shows that the main function
of mammalian DTD is to protect the cell against harmful
ROS production caused by redox cycling compounds
[34]. Exposure to such compounds causes an increase in
DTD activities in rodents [29]. Studies also demonstrate
that a lack of DTD activity, either due to knockout of the
DTD gene or by dicoumarol enzyme inhibition, causes an
increase in quinone dependent toxicity [12,35]. The cells
inability to break the redox cycling of compounds, such as
quinones, increases the ROS generation that leads to
increases in oxidative cellular damage, which may result
in tissue malfunction. The monofunctional compounds
included in this study exert their toxic effect through redox
cycling, which causes ROS production [23]. Metabolites
from the bifunctional compounds may also cause ROS
production through redox cycling [23]. The increase in
hepatic DTD activity in rainbow trout by these compounds implies that DTD has a protective role also in this
species. The increase of hepatic DTD activity in response
to prooxidant exposure in rainbow trout may also suggest
DTD activity as part of an oxidative stress biomarker battery. Cultivated rainbow trout are often used in fresh water
caging studies for environmental biomonitoring. Biomarkers can be defined as specific biological changes resulting
from exposure to chemicals. In order to qualify as an enzymatic biomarker, the enzyme needs to be induced or
changed in a measurable way as a result to an exposure.
This study shows that hepatic DTD activity in rainbow
trout is inducible by prooxidants in short term exposure
studies, suggesting that hepatic DTD may serve as a
biomarker for prooxidants in rainbow trout. However,
rainbow trout were exposed to high doses of the test compounds and the elevation of DTD activity was moderate
(2-fold). Long-term studies with ecologically relevant
doses would be necessary to fully evaluate the suitability
of DTD as a biomarker.
Hepatic catalase activity is frequently used as a biomarker
to assess oxidative stress in biomonitoring programs in
the aquatic environment [36-38]. Catalase is mainly a peroxisomal enzyme, and it is thus possible that an elevation
of catalase activity reflects peroxisomal proliferation
rather than antioxidant defense. It has been shown that
catalase activity positively correlates the number of peroxisomes in mice [39]. Though elevation in catalase activity
is observed in field studies, few laboratory studies have
reported increased catalase activities in fish exposed to
prooxidants [4]. In the present study, only exposure to PQ
and not to β(a)P, β-NF, DHNQ or MN affected catalase
activity. This suggests that catalase is only slightly responsive to acute prooxidant exposure.
Among the fish species included in this study, rainbow
trout was the only species that displayed inducible DTD
activities. Treatment with 15 mg Kg-1 of β-NF for five days

http://www.comparative-hepatology.com/content/4/1/4

doubled the DTD activity in rainbow trout liver cytosol,
whereas no increase in DTD activity was observed in the
other fish species receiving the same treatment, including
the brown trout (Salmo trutta) that is more phylogenetically related to the rainbow trout. β-NF is believed to be
rapidly metabolized by CYP1A enzymes and a dose of 15
mg Kg-1 causes a high but not maximal induction of
CYP1A activities in rainbow trout. Since different species
differ in their sensitivity towards AHR agonists, 15 mg Kg1 was chosen as a moderate dose to initially screen the
effects of a possible DTD inducer on fish species commonly used as sentinel ones in monitoring studies. This
dose was chosen to avoid a too high dose capable of
inhibiting DTD activity but also high enough for inducing
DTD activity. Nevertheless, further studies should be conducted to investigate effects of increased number of doses
and duration of exposures. On the other hand, studies in
other fish species report low levels of DTD activity and
inability of AHR agonists to induce DTD activity [27,40].
For example, wild sea bass (Dicentrarachus labrax) and dab
(Limanda limanda) exposed to 3-MC displayed low DTD
activities (ca. 4 and 3 nmol min-1 mg-1, respectively, in
control fish) and no DTD induction [27]. Pretti et al. [40]
reported low DTD activities in gilthead seabream (Sparus
auratus) (0.7 nmol min-1 mg-1 in control fish) and
observed no elevation in DTD activity after exposing the
fish to a high dose (50 mg Kg-1) of β-NF. Previous studies
in rainbow trout exposed to the AHR agonist 3-MC and βNF showed increased hepatic DTD activities [26,27].
Rainbow trout also displayed much higher DTD activities
compared to the other fish species included in this study.
When comparing the activities of different detoxification
enzymes in different fish species, Förlin et al. [41]
described a similar pattern with higher DTD activities in
rainbow trout compared to other fish species. It was suggested that the observed species difference could be due to
the presence of DTD inducing compounds in the commercial fish food, being rainbow trout the only cultivated
fish species included in the study. This suggestion, however, is not fully supported by the fact that DTD activity
was not induced in the other fish species treated with βNF. Instead, it seems that the rainbow trout has higher
natural basal levels of DTD activity compared to other fish
species. It is also possible that rainbow trout express an
inducible isoform of the enzyme, different from that
found in other investigated fish species. The reason for
this apparent species difference in relation to DTD is not
known. It would be of interest to investigate whether the
rainbow trout specific feature of DTD is natural or
acquired. Stocks of rainbow trout have been cultivated for
up to one hundred years and the species may have
adapted to the special conditions in a fish farm. Higher
basal levels of a more effective DTD enzyme could be one

such adaptive response to prooxidants in commercial fish
foods.

Conclusion
Since rainbow trout DTD activity is inducible by both
monofunctional and bifunctional inducers, we suggest
that rainbow trout DTD gene expression may be regulated
by the same mechanisms, as in mammals. The inducibility of rainbow trout hepatic DTD may also suggest that
rainbow trout DTD have a protective role. The rainbow
trout has a higher basal DTD activity compared to other
fish species studied, and its activity is inducible. The fact
that DTD activity is inducible in rainbow trout suggests
that the enzyme may be suitable as a part of a biomarker
battery; for example, in biomonitoring caging studies
where cultivated rainbow trout are being used. It appears
that DTD activity is not suitable as a biomarker in the
other fish species investigated in this study, and that further studies are needed to elucidate the DTD response to
prooxidants in these fish species.

Louis, USA). 7-ethoxyresorufin, reduced β-nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide 2'-phosphate (NADPH), reduced βnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), bovine
serum albumine (BSA) and 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, USA).
Rhodamine B and H2O2 were obtained from MERCK
(Darmstadt, Germany) and Dicoumarol from Aldrich
(Milwaukee, USA). All other chemicals were of analytical
grade.
Fish
Cultured juvenile rainbow trout of both sexes, weighting
108 (SD = 24) g, were obtained from Antens fiskodling
AB, a hatchery close to Göteborg. At least a week prior to
the experiments, the fish were acclimatized to the laboratory conditions in 500 l tanks with filtered, aerated fresh
water at 10°C in a flow-through system (5 l water/min).
During the experiment, fish were kept in 50 l glass aquaria
(7 fish per aquaria) with filtered, aerated water at 10°C,
also in a flow-through system (0.5 l water/min). The fish
were not fed and were exposed to a 12:12 h light/dark
cycle.

Perch (Perca fluviatilis) weighing 6 (SD = 0.8) g, shorthorn
sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) weighing 153 (SD = 41)
g, eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) weighing 35 (SD = 13) g, and
brown trout (Salmo trutta) weighing 102 (SD = 23) g, were
provided by local fishermen, and carp (Cyprinus carpio)

http://www.comparative-hepatology.com/content/4/1/4

weighing 155 (SD = 42) g was obtained from a local
hatchery. Perch, brown trout and carp were treated as
described for rainbow trout. Eelpout and shorthorn
sculpin were kept in salt water (30‰), also under similar
conditions as described for rainbow trout.
Experimental design
At the start of the experiment, fish were injected intraperitoneally with the test compound dissolved in its respective carrier solution (peanut oil for β-NF, B(a)P, MN and
DHNQ and 0.15 M KCl for PQ) or the carrier solution
alone (0.5 ml/100 g fish). Rainbow trout were divided
into three groups: one control group that received the carrier solution alone; one group that was exposed to a low
dose of a single test compound (B(a)P, β-NF or MN 5 mg
Kg-1, K DHNQ: 1 mg Kg-1, K PQ: 3 mg Kg-1); and, finally,
one group that was exposed to a high dose of a single test
compound (B(a)P, β-NF or MN 15 mg Kg-1, DHNQ, 3 mg
Kg-1, PQ, 10 mg Kg-1). Doses were chosen relative to PQ
toxicity data (manufacturers label, mammalian data) with
the high PQ dose 10 times lower than recorded LD50 values. Since B(a)P, β-NF and MN are less toxic than PQ,
these compounds were administered in higher doses. Due
to DHNQ's higher toxicity we used lower doses of this
compound. The exposure times were 2 and 5 days, and 7
fish were sampled per exposure group and time point.

Fish were killed with a sharp blow to the head and the
weight and length recorded. Each fish was cut open and
the liver excised, weighed and homogenized in Na+/K+phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 M KCl. The
homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 700 g, and the
supernatant recentrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 g. An aliquot of the supernatant (S9 fraction) was stored at -80°C
for EROD measurements, and the rest of the supernatant
centrifuged for 60 min at 105,000 g. Aliquots of the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) were stored at -80°C until analyzed. All subcellular preparation steps were performed at
4°C.
The additional fish species studied were treated with a
high dose (15 mg Kg-1) for 5 days. The fish were exposed
and sampled and the samples treated as described for
rainbow trout. Six fish were sampled per exposure group.
Biochemical assays
DT-diaphorase activity was measured in liver cytosolic
fraction according to Ernster [13], modified and adapted
to a microplate reader [42]. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 40 µM DCPIP and 0.3
mM NADH in a final volume of 210 µl. Ten µl of the sample were pipetted into microplate wells and the reaction
was started by the addition of 200 µl of reaction mixture.
Samples were measured with or without the addition of
0.1 mM dicoumarol, dissolved in 0.15 % NaOH. DTD

activity was defined as dicoumarol inhibitable DCPIP
reduction. Change in absorbance was monitored at 600
nm, and DTD activity calculated using the extinction coefficient for DCPIP (ε = 21 mM-1cm-1).
EROD activity was measured in liver S9 fraction according
to the method described by Förlin et al. [43] using rhodamine as standard. The reaction mixture contained 0.1 M
Na-phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.5 µM ethoxyresorufin
and 25–50 µl of sample in a final volume of 2 ml. The
reaction was started with the addition of 10 µl 10 mM
NADPH. The increase in fluorescence was monitored at
530 nm (excitation) and 585 (emission).
Catalase activity was measured in liver cytosol according
to the method described by Aebi [21]. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM K-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and
50 mM H2O2 diluted in 80 mM K-phosphate buffer (pH
6.5). The mixture was incubated at 25°C, the baseline
recorded, and the decrease in absorbance further recorded
at 240 nm, after the addition of the sample. Catalase activity was calculated using the extinction coefficient for H2O2
(ε = 40 M-1cm-1).
Protein content was determined using the BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Pierce, USA), with BSA as standard.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and, following significant differences, with
Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Levene's test was used to test
for homogeneity of variances. Data displaying heterogeneity of variances were instead analysed using KruskalWallis H test, followed by Dunnett's C test. When comparing only two groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used.
All statistical analyses were calculated using SPSS® for
Windows. The significance level (α) was set at 0.05. Data
are presented as: mean (standard deviation).
