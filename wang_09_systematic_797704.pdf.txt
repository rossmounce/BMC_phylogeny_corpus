Abstract
Background: Amino acid insertions and deletions in proteins are considered relatively rare events, and
their associations with the evolution and adaptation of organisms are not yet understood. In this study, we
undertook a systematic analysis of over 214,000 polypeptides from 32 nematode species and identified
insertions and deletions unique to nematode proteins in more than 1000 families and provided indirect
evidence that these alterations are linked to the evolution and adaptation of nematodes.
Results: Amino acid alterations in sequences of nematodes were identified by comparison with
homologous sequences from a wide range of eukaryotic (metzoan) organisms. This comparison revealed
that the proteins inferred from transcriptomic datasets for nematodes contained more deletions than
insertions, and that the deletions tended to be larger in length than insertions, indicating a decreased size
of the transcriptome of nematodes compared with other organisms. The present findings showed that this
reduction is more pronounced in parasitic nematodes compared with the free-living nematodes of the
genus Caenorhabditis. Consistent with a requirement for conservation in proteins involved in the
processing of genetic information, fewer insertions and deletions were detected in such proteins. On the
other hand, more insertions and deletions were recorded for proteins inferred to be involved in the
endocrine and immune systems, suggesting a link with adaptation. Similarly, proteins involved in multiple
cellular pathways tended to display more deletions and insertions than those involved in a single pathway.
The number of insertions and deletions shared by a range of plant parasitic nematodes were higher for
proteins involved in lipid metabolism and electron transport compared with other nematodes, suggesting
an association between metabolic adaptation and parasitism in plant hosts. We also identified three sizable
deletions from proteins found to be specific to and shared by parasitic nematodes, which, given their
uniqueness, might serve as target candidates for drug design.
Conclusion: This study illustrates the significance of using comparative genomics approaches to identify
molecular elements unique to parasitic nematodes, which have adapted to a particular host organism and
mode of existence during evolution. While the focus of this study was on nematodes, the approach has
applicability to a wide range of other groups of organisms.

Background
Novel molecular signatures specific to particular taxonomic or organismal groups have possible applications
for advancing of our understanding of the species within
them. In addition, emerging strategies for protein engineering and drug design exploit molecular evolutionary
information of proteins [1-6]. Approaches such as targeting evolutionary conserved residues and domains in proteins to modify the interaction of enzymes with other
compounds have been reported [2,7-9]. An example is the
development of the drug Raltegravir, which targets the
conserved reaction core domain of integrase of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [10,11] and provides a
treatment for patients with resistance to conventional
classes of drugs against human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infections. However, compared to the focus on conserved proteins, there has been very limited attention to
exploring variation in protein sequences and structures
linked to insertion/deletion events in homologous proteins among different groups of organisms. Depending on
their location and size, insertions and deletions can have
a significant effect on the structure and function of proteins, resulting in significant diversity and reflecting the
adaptation of an organism to a specific mode of existence
or environment [12,13]. Therefore, insertions and/or
deletions unique to particular groups of organisms could
advance our understanding of such groups at a molecular
level and provide useful genetic, biochemical or physiological markers and targets for drug design.
Insertions and deletions (indels) in coding sequences
have been reported to be the result of one or more mutation processes, including DNA mispairing [14], crossover
[15], transposition [16], and/or others [17]. However, the
precise processes and mechanisms remain to be determined. Despite their effects on sequence diversity, indels
are considered to be relatively rare events compared to
point mutations [18,19]. Indels are also less likely than
substitutions to be selectively neutral and are proposed to
be under constant selective pressure and are frequently
deleterious [20]. Many proteins are under substantial
functional and structural constraints, thus limiting substitutions at the amino acid level [21]. Indels accumulated
during evolution, not deleterious to a species or a group
of species, can change protein structures and function
[22,23] leading to adaptations to new environments [24].
The paucity of information on indels, particularly those
conserved across different phyla, has limited our understanding of protein function and evolution in relation to
the adaptation of organisms to particular environments or
hosts. Interestingly, preliminary study of proteins inferred
from genomic data sets for parasitic nematodes suggested
the presence of nematode-specific proteins and indels
compared with other Metazoa (Mitreva et al., unpub-

lished), which emphasizes the need to undertake extensive investigation for different evolutionary groups. A
systematic, comparative bioinformatics analysis of
sequence and structural differences in proteins could thus
provide unique insights into evolutionary and functional
aspects of proteins in parasitic organisms, particularly in
relation to host adaptation and ecology. From an applied
perspective, such analyses could also identify indel events
that might be further explored for the rational design of
drugs to such unique targets. This latter statement is particularly pertinent to parasitic nematodes, because of
widespread problems with drug resistance [25,26] and the
need to find new intervention strategies, including drugs
and vaccines [27].
Nematodes represent one of the largest phyla of animals,
yet many remain poorly described. Thus far, more than
25,000 have been described [28]. Although there are
many uncertainties regarding the evolution of Nematoda,
a molecular phylogeny, based on the use of a ribosomal
subunit gene, has proposed five main clades (I-V) [29,30].
These clades reflect the diversity in biology and ecology
within Nematoda and suggest that the adaptation to parasitism has occurred multiple times during their evolution.
In contrast to free-living nematodes, such as members of
the genus Caenorhabditis, many parasitic nematodes cause
diseases in plants and animals and are thus of major socioeconomic importance. For instance, hundreds of millions of people are infected with geohelminths (soiltransmitted worms), such as Ancylostoma duodenale and/or
Necator americanus, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris spp. [31],
causing serious adverse effects on human health, particularly in children. Similarly, parasitic nematodes of livestock, such as cattle and sheep, also cause substantial
economic losses worldwide, with billions of dollars spent
annually on the treatment and control of nematodes. In
addition to the socioeconomic impact that these parasites
have, there is potential for the emergence of resistance
against the main classes of nematocidal compounds used
to treat the diseases they cause [32]. Therefore, there is a
significant need to work towards discovering new compounds to control these parasites.
Genomic technologies can assist in this discovery effort.
For example, expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing
projects provide a resource for the prediction of new drug
and vaccine targets [e.g. [33-35]]. Recently, the projects
conducted at Washington University with its collaborators have succeeded in generating ~300,000 expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) from 32 species of nematodes representing four of the five clades of the Nematoda. The
amount and depth of this dataset enabled us to carry out
a systematic analysis of insertions and deletions in proteins inferred from these transcripts by comparing to proteins from a range of other organisms (including a range

of metazoans). The present study conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis to identify indels specific to
nematode proteins and their relationships with molecular
function and organism adaptation. This initial analysis
provided a foundation for "indel-based" drug design in
nematodes, while elucidating possible mechanisms of
nematode parasitism, adaptation and protein evolution.

Results
Taking advantage of the abundance of nematode
sequences accumulated from several nematode sequencing projects, and the large evolutionary distances between
some sequences, the present study characterized insertions and deletions (indels) unique to nematode proteins.
Distinct from most previous studies [19,36-38], which
combined data on indels, the present analysis considered
both insertion and deletion events by comparing nematode proteins with those of their homologues in other
eukaryotic (metazoan) organisms. We defined insertions
unique to nematodes as gaps common to all other eukaryotic sequences, and nematode-unique deletions as gaps
absent from any other sequence. To ensure the reliability
in the identification of insertions and deletions, we
focused the analyses on the 1286 families with 10 or more
homologues available from other metazoa and at least
one fungus. These families contain 20,695 polypeptides
(12,583 inferred from EST contigs and 8,112 from five different genome sequences) in nematodes. The average
length of the peptides inferred from EST contigs and
genomes was 171 and 456 amino acids (aa), respectively.
For a protein family to be considered in the present analysis, it had to represent at least 3 different species (one
species of Caenorhabditis and at least 2 parasitic species).
Hence, only alignments that represented both Caenorhabditis and parasitic nematodes were evaluated, thus eliminating bias due to length differences. We studied the
evolution of the insertions and deletions in nematodes via
a detailed analysis of insertion and deletion events that
were shared among different lineages or clades. The relationships of these indels were studied by examining the
inferred function of their corresponding proteins. Also,
the associations between the presence of indels and different tropic ecology (i.e., food source) as well as the parasitic mode of existence were studied.
Uneven insertions and deletions
EST databases [39] provide a large amount of sequence
data for nematodes. A total of 130,357 translations of
contig-level EST consensus sequences (comprising
262,497 ESTs) originating from 29 nematode species,
were complemented with complete datasets (84,408 proteins) generated in five genome sequencing projects (3
Caenorhabditis species, Brugia malayi, and Ancylostoma
caninum). Hence, a total of 214,159 polypeptides/proteins from 32 nematode species were used for the subse-

quent analysis (Figure 1). The systematic analysis (Figure
2) defined 54,036 homologous families, of which 5,326
were common to at least three species (one Caenorhabditis
and 2 parasitic nematodes). By focusing on the nematode
protein families with homologues in other eukaryotic
organisms, we were able to define nematode-specific
indels, employing fungal sequences as outgroups. Within
these 1,286 families of proteins, the defined number of
deletions (10,132) was significantly greater (P < 0.0001,
Chi-square) than the number of insertions (3,507). In
addition, the deletions (31.3 residues/positions) tended
to be longer than the insertions (7.1 residues/position)
(Figure 3) (P < 0.0001, Chi-square).
Subsets of protein families (173 groups) representing at
least two species from each clade of the phylum Nematoda (I, III, IV, V) were selected (according to the distribution of member sequences according to species), in order
to conduct an analysis of indel events in relation to the
proposed molecular phylogeny of Nematoda. For the 173
families, 2,236 deletions and 636 insertions were identified, with a significant bias (P < 0.0001, Chi-square)
toward deletions, and, again, the deletions tended to be
larger. The indels could be classified into 11 groups based
on whether they were common or restricted to clade(s) or
lineages (see Methods). The distribution of indels of the
173 families (Figure 4) showed limited numbers of indels
at the internal nodes (in terms of common to members
from the same clade or different clades), suggesting that
the majority of the indels identified evolved after the separation of the clades. The largest number of indels
belonged to sequences representing Clade V (Figure 4).
For each clade, < 3% of indels were common to all members. Under the assumption that indels shared by all
members of a lineage occurred at its last common ancestor (LCA), the present data indicated that shared insertions tended to be more basal than shared deletions
(Figure 4). Seven of 14 (50%) of the shared insertions
were generated at the LCA, in contrast to < 6% (3 of 53)
for deletions (P < 0.0001; Fisher Exact test). More insertions than deletions occurred at the LCA of all nematodes
and the LCAs of Clades III, IV and V, whereas more deletions occurred across all other lineages, which is consistent with the tendency of nematode proteins to have more
deletions than insertions.
Evidence of a link between indels and the adaptation from
free-living Caenorhabditis to a parasitic mode of existence
We investigated indels based on their trophic ecology, i.e.
FLN (Free-living Nematodes representing predominantly
the Caenorhabditis lineage), PPN (Plant-parasitic Nematodes), and APN (Animal-parasitic Nematodes). These
three groups of nematodes had a limited number of common indels (Table 1). The free-living Caenorhabditis
nematodes had in common ~10% of deletions and ~30%

rant further exploration (e.g. targets for parasite intervention), we mapped (as an example) the deletion of the
protein family homologous to mitochondrial carrier protein to the structure of its bovine homologue [40]. Figure
5 shows that there is a deletion of an entire helix, including its terminal loops, from the nematode proteins.
Unfortunately, there is no structural data available for the
other protein families.

of their insertions. Interestingly, free-living nematodes
had more insertions compared with parasitic nematodes
(P < 0.0001, Chi-square) (Table 1). The ratio of insertions
to deletions for free-living nematodes was 0.44, whereas
for nematodes parasitic in animals and plants, the ratios
were lower (0.26 and 0.25, respectively). Also, Caenorhabditis spp. shared more insertions (213) than deletions
(159). There were only three deletion events (> 10 residues) and one insertion event (1 residue) common to all
parasitic nematodes. The proteins associated with the
shared insertion were inferred to be involved in fatty acid
synthesis (3-oxoacyl- [acyl-carrier protein] reductase). The
three deletion events were linked to proteins associated
with genetic information processing (26S proteasome regulatory subunit N, and small subunit ribosomal protein
S14), and environmental information processing (mitochondrial carrier protein). Because these deletion events
were shared only by parasitic nematodes representing different clades, they are likely linked to an adaptation to
parasitism. To examine whether these shared, unique
indels might represent novel molecular features that war-

Interested in proteins with common indels that might
relate specifically to a parasitic mode of existence, we classified the protein families with indels common to FLN,
PPN, or APN, according to the Panther protein classification system. Table 2 lists the top ten processes based on
the number of assigned protein families and grouped
them according to the trophic ecology of the species (a
complete list of the mappings to the Panther protein classification system is available as Additional file 1). While
the highest percentage of families were mapped to "nucleotide metabolism", there was no significant difference
among the three different types of nematodes. In contrast,
there was a significant difference among nematodes in the
number of mappings to the electron transport and lipid
metabolism (P < 0.05). In both these categories, PPN had
an increased number of families compared with FLN and
APN. Approximately 22% of the PPN protein families
were associated with these two functional classes, compared with < 10% for free-living and animal-parasitic
nematodes (statistically significant difference at P < 0.01,
Chi-square).
Mapping indel events identified in protein families to
cellular pathways
The frequencies of indel events in particular protein families involved in cellular pathways were inferred, in order
to explore possible links to biological function and the
adaptation of nematodes to their environment and/or
hosts. The KEGG pathway database enables associations
to metabolic and regulatory pathways, and was therefore
used for this analysis. According to KEGG analysis, four
main types of pathways were identified: genetic information processing, cellular processes, metabolism, and environmental information processing. The lowest
frequencies of insertions and deletions were linked to proteins involved in genetic information processing, whereas
the highest frequencies were associated with cellular processes (Table 3), with a difference of ~50% between them.
The differences among deletions and insertions were statistically significant (P < 0.05 and P < 0.1, respectively; Ttest). A complete list of all KEGG mappings is available as

was the least represented (4.28 deletions and 2.15 insertions), whereas endocrine signaling and immune system
had the highest representation (11.90 deletions and 4.08

pathways were also investigated. This analysis included >
300 families homologous to multi-pathway proteins and
> 600 families homologous to other proteins, and
revealed that the average frequencies of both insertions
and deletions of the multi-pathway families were ~30%
higher than those of others (insertions: 3.01 versus 2.42;
deletions: 8.79 versus 6.29) (Additional file 4) and the differences were highly significant (P < 0.0001; T-test).

Discussion
The present, systematic analysis of indels in proteins of
nematode origin has provided useful information to
make inferences about protein evolution and function
and could have important implications for the identification of novel genetic, biochemical or physiological markers and targets for drug design.
It is known that indels are distinct from point substitutions, and their evolution is affected by distinct influences
[41]. The present results support the proposal that insertions and deletions relate to distinct evolutionary processes. The number of deletions is significantly higher than
that of insertions, and the sizes of deletions are larger than
those of insertions. A previous study also found more
deletions in coding sequences in mammals [42]. It
appears that mutational bias is one cause of these
increased deletions. Analyses of non-coding genomic
sequences have revealed a mutational process biased
toward deletions [43,44], and the present results indicate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/23

that similar mutational mechanisms might apply to the
protein-coding sequences. However, the observed larger
size of deletions cannot be explained by mutational bias,
since deletion and insertion mutations have similar sizes
[45]. So, the role that natural selection and adaptation
have played here is unclear. From the structural perspective, proteins are more flexible with insertions than deletions [46], although single-residue deletions can be
tolerated [47]. Therefore, deletions, particularly larger
ones, are not expected to be maintained, which contrasts
current observations. It is likely that function-related
selection has played a role. Such selection has been identified in a primate sperm ion channel protein [48]. Both
the increased number of deletions at the terminal nodes
(Figure 4) and the increased common deletions (Table 1)
among parasitic nematodes further suggest that the function-related selection is associated with recent species
adaptation. Nonetheless, the observed, larger number of
deletions and their larger sizes (compared with insertions) indicate a size decrease in nematode transcriptomes
during evolution. This size reduction in nematode transcriptomes seems to be consistent with a tendency for
their genomes to be smaller than some other metazoa,
such flatworms [49] and birds [50].
The biased distributions of indels on different functional
pathways (Table 3) further demonstrate the selective
forces on them, and suggest the association between
increased indels and functional adaptation. Proteins
involved in genetic information processing are believed to
have stringent selective constraints, and are under strong
"purifying selection" [51,52]. Accordingly, these proteins
have the least number of insertions and deletions per protein (Additional file 4). Depending on the function, some
proteins are under positive selections and accumulate
more insertions and deletions [53]. The present study
showed that nematode proteins involved in cellular processes (Table 3, Additional file 2) including endocrine signaling pathways and immune system (such as Toll-like
receptors and antigen processing) had 50% more deletions and insertion than those involved in genetic information processing. This information agrees with the
findings of previous studies [53,54]. Rapidly evolving
genes are also considered to be frequently associated with
the immune and endocrine systems in other organisms
[54,55]. These systems are considered to be key to a specific molecular interaction with the environment where a
rapid adaptation to a food source [56] or host may be
required. Overall, the present results suggest that proteins
bearing sizable nematode-specific indels are functionally
grouped. Furthermore, adaptation can lead to an increase
of protein sequence changes, including substitution,
insertion, and deletion [55,57]. The high rates of insertion
and deletion events in proteins involved in multiple pathways might also be viewed as an evidence of functional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/23

PPN are likely to use indels as a strategy for their adaptation as well as lateral gene transfer [63]. Nonetheless,
given the nature and potential bias of our data, the
upcoming parasitic nematode genome data [64] will enable us to perform more comprehensive studies which will
lead to more firm conclusions.

adaptation, as suggested by recent research [58]. Although
a relaxed selective pressure can also lead to such high
rates, it is unlikely here. The selective pressure on these
proteins is assumed to be greater because they are
involved in multiple pathways and potentially interact
with more proteins. Their substitutional rates tend to be
lower [59]. Thus, increased indels in proteins involved in
multiple pathways is suggested to be due to their positive
role in an adaptation of nematodes to their host and environment.
More direct evidence for roles of nematode-specific indels
in adaptation comes from a comparison of their distributions in different groups of nematodes. The number of
indels common to plant parasitic nematodes, compared
with other nematodes, is higher for proteins involved in
electron transport and lipid/fatty acid/steroid metabolism
(Table 2). The higher number could be related to the
adaptation of PPN to their specific lifestyle, which
includes different stages capable of surviving aerobic and
anaerobic environments. Adaptation of these energy
metabolism related functional classes is important for
parasites. Direct biochemical evidences of adaptation
with these two classes have been observed [60-62]. These
detected common indels can be one of the reasons for
those observed biochemical changes, and suggest that

There is a very limited number of indels occurring on
internal nodes (Figure 4), although these internal nodes
do not represent short evolutionary times. For example,
the internal branch leading to the split of Clade V, IV and
III stands for more than 100 million years [65] (the
branch leading to Clade III stands for about 350 million
years [29,30]). If all indels were retained and their rates
are constant, the numbers of indels of these internal
branches are expected to be in the same order of magnitude as the terminal branches. The extremely low
observed numbers of insertions and deletions on internal
nodes could reflect that nematodes have higher indel
rates, and thus the number of newly generated indels is
higher that the older indels. Thus, sequence comparisons
can only detect fewer shared indels. However, it is also
possible that an indel burst occurred in the evolution of
the Nematoda during a recent adaptation to their life
niches.
In addition to insights into fundamental aspects of indel
events in proteins, including their evolution and roles in
adaptation, this study might assist in the design of intervention strategies against nematodes. Indels common to
all parasitic nematodes could provide drug targets for
broad control. On one hand, if they are restricted to nematodes, specific targeting will not affect the regular functionality of the homologous proteins in the hosts.
Importantly, these indels might also be crucial for the survival of parasites (or they will not be shared by all the parasites since parasitic adaptations are proposed to have
occurred several times independently [29]). Using indels
to design effective drugs has been successfully explored by
Nandan et al., [66] who designed a compound that targeted a 12 residue deletion in the EF-1α protein of the
protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The compound
attacks the parasite by blocking this protein without
affecting the human homologue. It is likely that the indel
used for drug design should be located on the surface of a
protein or should relate to a unique structural component

of a protein. Sizable deletions uniquely shared by all parasites could possess similar characteristics and become a
target for these approaches as well. One such example is
the deletion of an entire helix on a functionally important
mitochondrial carrier protein (Figure 5). Hence, the identified conserved nematode-specific molecular signatures
have possible applications for advancing our understanding of the nematodes.

Conclusion
Genomics studies of parasites in the phylum Nematoda
have been mainly restricted to EST-derived partial pro-

teomes [35,39]. The analysis varied from comparison
between two species, to a pan-phylum analysis. Numerous laboratories around the world have contributed to >

currently also have available genome sequences from four
nematode species including two parasites. The first annotated genome of a parasitic nematode, Brugia malayi, contained over 11,000 genes [67] and the plant parasite
Meloidogyne incognita over 19,000 genes [68]; both studies
have identified potential new anti-parasitic drug targets.
However, as the cost for the next-generation sequencing
technologies decreases substantially, the sequencing of

complete genomes of many eukaryotic species, including
parasitic nematodes selected mainly due to their importance to health, evolution and ecology, can be foreseen in
the near future. In the next five years, collaborative
projects at the Genome Center at Washington University
and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute will increase the
available parasitic nematode sequences by another order
of magnitude, adding a total of 25 draft genomes supplemented by millions of cDNA reads via pyrosequencing.
However, we anticipate that complete annotated genomes
for parasitic nematodes are still 2–4 years away. Until
then, the transcriptomic data will remain the main source
of information for the investigation of nematodes at the
molecular level. These EST-derived partial proteomes represent mainly abundantly transcribed sequences and
therefore lack or have reduced representation of some
gene classes and are thus inappropriate for certain type of
analyses, such as "gene loss" which is due to lack of evidence rather than true loss.
However, several pan-phylum analyses have been facilitated by the wealth of transcriptomic data from over 30
nematode species spanning the phylum Nematoda. The
first pan-phylum analysis [35], was one of the most complete analyses of the genetic diversity of a single phylum
yet attempted, and was full of surprises. This report
showed that the C. elegans genome contains only a relatively small fraction of the genetic diversity of nematodes.
Despite the availability of the genomes of two Caenorhabditis species and numerous ESTs, the nematode gene-space

appears far from thoroughly sampled because the addition of each new species to the analysis yielded a linear
increase in new gene discovery. The same dataset of
265,494 ESTs clustered into 93,645 genes and comprised
of 25,871,325 codons were used for a comprehensive
codon usage analysis [69]. This latter study demonstrated
that codon usage similarity in Nematoda usually persists
over the breadth of a genus but then rapidly diminishes
even within each clade. This analysis together with an
analysis by Cutter et al. [70] based on the same dataset,
established the major evolutionary forces responsible for
determining observed codon usage bias in nematodes
including directional mutation pressure, translational
efficiency, and effective population size. Finally, recently
Wasmuth et al. [71] have analyzed nematode protein families and distinct domains and found preponderance of
genetic novelty in the phylum, i.e. an ongoing "invention
of novelty".
These pan-phylum analyses suggest that Nematode proteins and their transcriptomes have experienced drastic
changes, and specific changes can be related to functional
diversification, speciation and species adaptation [72-76].
Among the nematode-derived proteins, there are two
intriguing groups, (i) nematode-specific proteins, which
are inferred to be of crucial importance for understanding
nematode evolution and parasitism [77-79]; (ii) proteins
that have sufficiently diverged in the host as to be functionally absent or altered. The current pan-phylum study
has focused on systematic analysis of the latter group and

identified a biased distribution in molecular features
(insertions and deletions) in the nematode proteins,
which assist in elucidating the mechanism of genome size
decrease in nematodes. By examining the insertions and
deletions common to different nematodes and the functions of the relevant proteins, the present study infers an
important role of indels in nematode adaptation. The
detected indels shared by different groups of nematodes
warrant further investigation as potential targets for the
development of compounds against parasitic nematodes.

Methods
Data sets and classification of protein families
Sequence data from ESTs or genomic sequencing projects
are available for more than 30 species of nematodes (e.g.
[35,39,69,80] representing clades I, III, IV and V (cf. [29])
[81]. In the present study a total of 130,357 contig-level
EST consensus sequences (representing 262,497 ESTs
from organisms other than Caenorhabditis) originating
from 29 nematode species http://www.nematode.net,
were complemented with complete datasets (84,408 proteins) generated in five genome sequencing projects [3
Caenorhabditis species http://www.wormbase.org, Brugia
malayi [67], and Ancylostoma caninum [82]. Hence, a total
of 214,159 polypeptides/proteins from 32 nematode species were used for the subsequent analysis (Figure 1).
Using the Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) [83], protein
families were defined (Figure 2). To ensure generality of
protein families, we required every family to contain
member sequences from one species of Canenorhabditis
and two parasitic nematodes. Representative proteins and
protein families for insertion/deletion analysis were
selected based on the protein profile model of the family,
established using the program hmmpfam from the
HMMER package [84]. The member sequence with the
highest fitting-score to the family profile model was
selected as the representative of the family. Representative
peptide sequences were initially screened against the
KEGG [85] and Pfam [86] databases to identify significant
homology to known proteins. Those without significant
homology were eliminated. Representative sequences of
the remaining families were then compared against fulllength proteins from organisms other than nematodes
that were publicly available in the NCBI database (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; threshold of 1.0e-3). Homologous sequences originated from metazoans were downloaded into a separate database [henceforth referred to as
"reference" (r-) sequences]. Groups of proteins comprising less than 10 reference sequences were excluded, as
were those without fungal references. The final dataset
contains 1286 protein families with sequences from at
least 3 nematode species (one Caenorhabditis and two
parasitic species) and not less than 10 other metazoan
homologues (including fungus).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/23

Multiple-alignments and identification of insertions and
deletions restricted to nematodes
Alignments of family member sequences with reference
sequences were conducted in a step-wise fashion. First, the
reference sequences within each protein family were
aligned using MUSCLE [87]; second, the nematode
sequences of each family were aligned to their reference
sequences using CLUSTALW [88], employing the profile
alignment methodology [89]. The sequences were aligned
using this approach to avoid ambiguity and minimize
alignment gaps and maximize similarity/homology. Following the alignment of sequences, family member
sequences were edited further by collapsing contigs from
the same cluster (i.e. gene) and merging sequences from
the same species that shared a significant identity (more
than 90 bases or 50% of one sequence). Insertions and
deletions unique to nematodes were identified based on
the adjusted alignments. The gaps absent from reference
sequences were recorded as being nematode-specific gaps.
The positions corresponding to the gaps shared by all reference sequences but not any of the member sequences
(of a family) were recorded as insertions unique to nematodes. If gaps in different sequences overlapped by more
than one third of their total length or more than half of
the length of any individual gap, they were treated as
"shared gaps". The length of the gap was represented by
the average length of their individual member gaps. Insertions (n = 3,507) and deletions (n = 10,132) identified to
be unique to nematode protein sequences were subjected
to functional and phylogenetic analyses. All analyses were
automated using Perl scripts. These scripts are available
from the authors upon request.
Evolution of insertions and deletions
For the evolutionary studies, only protein families with at
least two members representing each of the clades I, III,
IV, and V were investigated. The indels of these families
were analyzed based on the proposed molecular phylogeny of the phylum Nematoda [30,90]. Because these families have multiple sequences derived from each of the
four clades, we could identify whether an indel was
restricted to members from one clade or was common to
multiple clades. Furthermore, we were able to distinguish
whether an indel was shared by all members of a specific
clade or group of clades (common indels), or whether it
was not shared by all members of a designated group but
restricted to a lineage (restricted indels). In this way, the
indels were classified into 11 groups (common or
restricted to members from each of the four clades,
restricted to clade III, IV and V, restricted to Clade IV and
V, and common to all four clades). The numbers of insertions and deletions in each of these groups were calculated. Given the phylogenetic relationships of these
clades, it was possible to map the indels of these groups to
the proposed phylogeny. For example, those common

and restricted to Clade V could be located to the last common ancestor (LCA) of Clade V, while those common to
Clade V but not shared by all the member sequences
derived from this clade (restricted) might be localized to a
descendant in Clade V.

multi-pathway, and if only one pathway could be
assigned, the family was classified as a single-pathway
protein family. The numbers of nematode-unique insertions and deletions linked to a multi-pathway or singlepathway protein group were calculated and compared.

Insertions and deletions specific to parasitic and/or freeliving nematodes
Parasitic nematodes can be grouped into those infecting
plants (PPN, plant parasitic nematodes) and others infecting animals, including humans (APN, animal parasitic
nematodes). Indels were examined to determine whether
they were associated with either or both of these groups.
The five free-living species (FLN, free-living nematodes)
were used as a control (Figure 1). Furthermore, we made
the distinction between indels shared between all the
members of a group (common indels) or only by some
members (restricted indels). Hence, the indels were categorized into eight classes: indels common to PPN, APN,
or FLN, indels restricted to PPN, APN, or FLN, indels common to all parasites, and indels common to all nematodes
(including free-living species). The representative
sequences of the protein families containing these indels
were also compared against data in the Uniprot database
[91] to identify homologues for functional classification
using the Panther database [92]. The Uniprot homologues
possessing these indels were used to explore the function
of these families by referring to the functional annotation
of proteins by employing Panther. The biological processes that the proteins were predicted to be involved in
were then compared.

Authors' contributions

Linking insertions and deletions to cellular pathways
Proteins and their cellular pathway annotations were
retrieved from the KEGG pathway database http://
www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html. Protein family
members were assigned to cellular pathways based on
their homology (cut-off: 35 bits and 50% of identity) to
sequences in KEGG (v.44) using WU-BLAST. The "closest"
homologue was selected for each family, and insertions
and deletions unique to nematodes were then linked to
the pathway to which the best homologue could be
assigned. Total numbers of insertions and deletions and
the mean number of families associated with each pathway were calculated.

Proteins involved in multiple pathways have more interactions with other proteins and tend to be functionally
essential [58,59]. Herein, "multi-pathway proteins" were
defined as those involved in several cellular pathways,
and single-pathway proteins as those involved exclusively
in one. Families of "multi-pathway proteins" were identified by examining the annotations of their closest KEGG
homologues. If they could be assigned to multiple pathways by KEGG associations, the family was classified as
