Abstract
Background: Burkholderia pseudomallei is the etiologic agent of melioidosis, a significant cause of
morbidity and mortality where this infection is endemic. Genomic differences among strains of B.
pseudomallei are predicted to be one of the major causes of the diverse clinical manifestations
observed among patients with melioidosis. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of
genomic islands (GIs) as sources of genomic diversity in this species.
Results: We found that genomic islands (GIs) vary greatly among B. pseudomallei strains. We
identified 71 distinct GIs from the genome sequences of five reference strains of B. pseudomallei:
K96243, 1710b, 1106a, MSHR668, and MSHR305. The genomic positions of these GIs are not
random, as many of them are associated with tRNA gene loci. In particular, the 3' end sequences
of tRNA genes are predicted to be involved in the integration of GIs. We propose the term "tRNAmediated site-specific recombination" (tRNA-SSR) for this mechanism. In addition, we provide a GI
nomenclature that is based upon integration hotspots identified here or previously described.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that acquisition of GIs is one of the major sources of genomic
diversity within B. pseudomallei and the molecular mechanisms that facilitate horizontally-acquired
GIs are common across multiple strains of B. pseudomallei. The differential presence of the 71 GIs
across multiple strains demonstrates the importance of these mobile elements for shaping the
genetic composition of individual strains and populations within this bacterial species.

Background
Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, an important tropical disease affecting people in
Southeast Asia and the tropical "Top End" of northern
Australia. Within these regions, this Gram-negative bacterium exists in the environment as a soil saprophyte and
accounts for 20% of community-acquired septicemias
and may cause death in 40% of treated patients [1]. Reinfection and relapse are common in melioidosis patients
[2,3]. Infection can occur when contaminated soil or
water comes into contact with breaks in the skin; this is a
common infection route for rice farmers in northeastern
Thailand [4,5]. Inhalation of contaminated dust has also
been confirmed as a route of infection, including U.S. helicopter pilots during the Vietnam War [6]. Because of the
high inhalational risk, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have classified B. pseudomallei as a
Category B Select Agent [7]. Various clinical manifestations are associated with melioidosis, ranging from subclinical involvement to symptomatic characteristics that
may include localized cutaneous infection, acute pulmonary infection, bacteremia, and disseminated infection
[1,8,9]. Cheng and Currie [10] suggested that this variation in clinical presentation may be caused by one or
more of three factors: variation in mode of acquisition,
variation in host immune response, or variation among
bacterial strains, including presence/absence of virulence
factors.
Many challenges exist for the control and prevention of
melioidosis [9]. At present, cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with these diverse clinical manifestations are not fully understood. Vaccine development and
better therapeutics are necessary to prevent and treat
melioidosis. However, knowledge of the relationship
between hosts and pathogen is still limited. This has hindered improved vaccine and therapeutic developments,
which require a full understanding of genomics and bacterial pathogenesis.
After the first genome of B. pseudomallei K96243 was
released in 2004 [11], subsequent studies capitalized
upon this foundation, which lead to enhanced genetic
and genomic analyses that have facilitated a better understanding of this organism. As additional genomic
sequences have been generated, striking differences have
been observed. For example, two mutually exclusive gene
cassettes, termed "BTFC and YLF", have been described
that are dissimilar in their geographical distribution [12].
It is well established that B. pseudomallei contains an
"open" genome [13] that recombines at a high frequency,
leading to great intra-species diversity within and among
pathogen populations. In recent unpublished analyses,
we have found that when compared to existing genomic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/566

sequences, new B. pseudomallei genome sequences can
contain as much as 500 Kb of additional genomic material in the form of blocks of novel DNA known as genomic
islands. Thus, we hypothesize that the primary differences
among B. pseudomallei genomes are horizontal gene transfer events from diverse bacterial or phage origins. Horizontal gene transfer involves the incorporation of genetic
elements, perhaps directly into the genome where they
form genomic islands [14]. Currently, very little is known
about fitness in B. pseudomallei. It seems likely that the
genes contained in genomic islands may generate unique
phenotypes and affect bacterial fitness, such as the interaction of bacterial cells with their surrounding environment. Fitness phenotypes could range from the ability to
survive under extreme environmental conditions to the
ability to defeat host immune system defenses.
Here, we describe diversity among B. pseudomallei
genomes in terms of identification and differential possession of genomic islands. Nomenclature for genomic
islands is proposed, and the specific mechanism behind
the genetic recombination is explained in detail. Finally,
we present the frequency distributions of a focused group
of interesting genomic islands across a large, diverse collection of B. pseudomallei isolates.

Results and discussions
Identification of genomic islands in B. pseudomallei
i) Genomic comparison of five B. pseudomallei strains
We identified genomic islands in B. pseudomallei from a
set of 5 diverse reference genomes: strains K96243, 1710b,
1106a, MSHR668, and MSHR305 (Table 1). All 5 strains
were isolated from melioidosis patients in Thailand or
Australia. Clinical manifestations and severity of disease
caused by these 5 strains were varied. Thai patients
infected by strains K96243, 1710b and 1106a exhibited
classical melioidosis manifestations, including lung and
liver abscesses, and septicemia. In contrast, Australian
patients infected by strains MSHR668 and MSHR305 had
the relatively rare melioidosis encephalomyelitis and neurological involvement. Patients infected with strains
K96243, 1710b, and MSHR305 died. Detailed clinical
information associated with all five isolates, as well as
their genomic features, is summarized in Table 1.

The five genomes were compared using Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [15], which enabled genomic alignment
and visualization of BLASTN results. We confirmed that
all genome sequences contained 2 chromosomes, except
the genome sequence of MSHR305, which was incomplete at the time of writing this manuscript. To facilitate
genomic comparison with the other 4 strains, we created
2 artificial chromosomes from the genome contigs of
strain MSHR305 [see Additional file 1: Figure S1a and S1b

genomic arrangement is not confirmed.
In general, we identified genomic islands by identifying
variable regions among the five genomes and determining
if any of these regions met the general criteria previously
described by Holden et al. in their analysis of strain
K96243 [11], or the criteria described by Hacker and
Kaper [16]. These criteria included: size of large inserts,
distinct %G+C compared to the rest of the genome, and
the presence of mobility genes. It is important to note that
across the 5 strains multiple GIs were often present at the
same genomic location (Table 2). In practice, our identification of genomic islands involved four main steps.
First, we determined if the 16 specific GIs previously identified in K96243 [11] were present in the four other
strains. In K96243, 12 of these GIs are found on chromosome 1 and four are found on chromosome 2. Using the
genomic locations of these GIs in K96243 as a reference,
we performed pair-wise comparisons between K96243
and the other four strains and noted the differential presence of the 16 GIs in the other four strains. These 16 specific GIs were uncommon in the other 4 B. pseudomallei

genomes: only four of these GIs (GI1, GI6, GI10, and
GI14) were found in at least one of the other four strains,
and none were found in all of the other strains (Table 2).
Second, we identified new, distinct GIs that were present
at the same 16 genomic locations where GIs were previously found in K96243. To accomplish this, we used ACT
to align the genomes of all five strains in the following
order: K96243 vs. 1710b vs. 1106a vs. MSHR668 vs.
MSHR305. In addition to identifying structural variation
among any GIs present at these 16 locations, this alignment also allowed us to locate integration sites. Even
when there is more than one GI found at the same relative
genomic location, the integration sites were all similar
across the five strains and these integrations sites were
often associated with tRNA genes (Table 3). The genomic
locations of GI2, GI5, and GI9 in K96243 did not contain
GIs in any of the other four strains. One of the other locations, corresponding to GI6 in K96243, contained an
identical GI in just strain MSHR305. However, the GIs
located at the 13 other locations were quite diverse: at four
of these locations each of the five strains possessed a distinct GI containing a different set of genes (Table 2).

Note: Rows represent 37 different genomic locations where GIs were found in at least one strain. These positions are listed according to the
relative location in strain K96243. Different GI names indicate different gene content [see Additional file 3]. GIs shared among strains at the same
relative genomic location are indicated (bold). * GIs1-16 in strain K96243 were previously described [11], whereas GI16b is reported here for the
first time.

Third, we identified new, distinct GIs that were present at
genomic locations other than the 16 previously described
from K96243 [11]. These new GIs were identified by
searching for integrations of large DNA blocks in the ACT
alignment of the five strains; these integrations were
found in both single strains and multiple strains. If these
occurred in multiple strains at the same genomic location,
the gene contents of the inserts were compared to determine if they represented distinct GIs. This process identi-

fied GIs present at 21 additional genomic locations (Table
2).
Fourth, the contents of all identified GIs were analyzed to
determine if they met the criteria described above. Most
identified GIs contained low %G+C, sequence composition different from the core backbone composition, and
were large inserts. In addition, insertions usually were
located adjacent to tRNA genes, flanking direct repeats or

insertion sequence (IS) elements, or mobility genes such
as integrases or transposases.
GIs appear to be a major source of genomic diversity
within B. pseudomallei as each strain has a distinct set of
GIs (Table 2). We identified 71 distinct GIs among the five
strains that we examined. The number of GIs identified
from each strain varied: a total of 17, 16, 16, 17, and 21
GIs were identified from strains K96243, 1710b, 1106a,
MSHR668, and MSHR305, respectively. For all five

strains, more than half of the GIs found in that strain were
unique to that particular strain. At seven of the 37
genomic locations, GIs were present in all five strains.
However, none of these seven genomic locations contained the same GI across all five strains. These data illustrate that particular GIs are present in some B. pseudomallei
strains but absent in other strains. We note that we identified a new GI in strain K96243, GI16b, which is located
between GI16 and GI13 on chromosome 2 in K96243.

MSHR305 aligned against the relative locations of the
original 16 GIs from K96243 are illustrated in Figure 1
and listed in Table 2. Sizes of the GIs ranged from 3.91 Kb
for GI7.4 in MSHR305 to 107.94 Kb for GI6b in 1710b.
Interestingly, dinucleotide signatures [17] 'GC' and 'CG'
have the highest frequencies in all GIs regardless of the
actual %G+C [see Additional file 2]. This and other information for all GIs is presented in Additional file 3.
We identified GIs in B. pseudomallei based upon the
aligned differences observed across multiple genomes,
which could be explained by horizontal acquisition of
DNA segments from other organisms. Recently Vernikos
and Parkhill [18] presented an interesting machine learning approach for identifying GIs in bacteria based upon
weights of eight criteria, including: the interpolated variable order motif (IVOM) score, presence/absence of integrase, presence/absence of phage-related protein

ii) Nomenclature of B. pseudomallei genomic islands
Each of the five strains of B. pseudomallei that we examined
contained unique GIs. Thus, it seems quite likely that the
number of GIs discovered in this species will continue to
increase as additional genome sequences become available. To facilitate scientific communication, we feel it is
necessary to create a nomenclature for these important
sources of genomic diversity. We propose a GI nomenclature system based upon differences in terms of locations
and gene content between the newly identified GIs and
the original 16 GIs identified in K96243. K96243 was choReplication

domains, size, RNA, density, repeats, and insertion points.
Their studies in three different bacterial genera, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus, suggest that GIs
can be seen as a superfamily of mobile elements, with core

family.

sen as the reference genome for GI locations because it
was the first B. pseudomallei strain whole-genome
sequenced and it is commonly used in many other studies. Detailed criteria for the proposed nomenclature are as
follows:
a) Precedence
Any GIs found at the same relative GI locations and containing the same gene contents will be given the same
name as the GIs previously identified in K96243. For
example, strains 1710b and 1106a contain GIs at same
position as GI1 of K96243 and both the GIs in these
strains have similar gene composition to GI1 of K96243.
Hence, these GIs also are called GI1.
b) Unique gene composition
Any GIs containing different gene content but located at
the same reference genomic location will be given the
same name as GIs in K96243 but with suffix differentiation based upon the order of their discovery (e.g., x.1, x.2,
x.3). For example, strain MSHR668 contains a GI at the
same location as GI1 in K96243 but it has different gene
content. Thus, the GI in MSHR668 is designated as GI1.1,
which indicates that this GI is located at the same location
as GI1 but has different gene content. Some GIs may be
found at the same genomic location and share highly similar sets of genes but contain differing numbers of mobility genes, suggesting different recombination events or
mechanisms. These would be considered distinct GIs and
given unique suffix designations. This criterion describes
the difference between GI14.1 of MSHR668 and GI14 in
K96243, 1710b, 1106a, and MSHR305. Both GIs contain
similar genes but GI14.1 contains an extra pair of IS407A
transposase genes, indicating that the GIs resulted from
different recombination events. Using this criterion, we
are able to identify different GIs that are located at the
same reference location across multiple strains of B. pseudomallei.
c) Unique genomic location
Any novel GIs discovered at genomic locations located
between two consecutive reference GI locations in
K96243 will be named with a lower case letter (a to z) suffix indicating a new insertion position. Whenever possible
these will be named in alphabetic ascending order consistent with the numerical order (e.g., GI9: GI9a, GI9b, GI9c:
GI10). However, subsequent GI discovery studies may
require a non-sequential naming, which we think is still
preferable to a more complex system with additional digital codes. In this study, MSHR668 contains a new GI
located between the genomic locations of GI1 and GI2 in
K96243; this new GI is named GI1a. We use "a" because
this is the first new GI discovered in this genomic region.
We also used this rule to name GI9a, GI9b and GI9c,
which are new GIs located in between the K96243

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/566

genomic positions of GI9 and G10. It is important to note
that these new reference positions sometimes contain
multiple GIs. In such a case, the GI name will be consistent with naming rule b and a "dot numeral" is added as a
suffix (e.g., ".1"). In this study, we identified a new GI,
GI9c, in MSHR668 but strain MSHR305 also contains a
new GI at this same genomic location but with different
gene content. The MSHR305 GI is therefore named GI9c.1
in accordance with naming rules b and c.
Using these three naming conventions, we are able to
name new GIs discovered from multiple B. pseudomallei
genomes according to their genomic location order, and
this system should accommodate new GIs that will be discovered as new genome sequences become available.
Genetic recombination of genomic islands
Many genomic islands in B. pseudomallei are created by
site-specific recombination mechanisms. Site-specific
recombination (SSR) involves the alignment of identical,
or nearly identical sequences followed by the breaking
and joining (crossover) of the strands, resulting in the
exchange of genetic material. In the case of genomic
islands, these recombination events are part of the integration process of foreign genetic materials. We observed
at least two SSR-types, tRNA-SSR and gene specific-SSR,
among the five genomes of B. pseudomallei examined in
this study. These two types are differentiated by the recognition sequence targets used to insert the foreign genetic
material.
i) tRNA-SSR
GIs of B. pseudomallei are most commonly located next to
tRNA genes. There are 9, 7, 7, 10, and 10 GIs located adjacent to tRNA genes in K96243, 1710b, 1106a, MSHR668,
and MSHR305, respectively (40â60% of all GIs found in
these strains; see Additional file 1: Figures S1a - S1j, and
Table 3). In B. pseudomallei genomes, there are between 59
to 61 tRNA genes distributed across both chromosomes.
Recombination at tRNA loci is initiated at the 3' end of
tRNA genes. This process creates a short, direct repeat
sequence of the tRNA gene downstream of the integration
site. We termed this type of recombination "tRNA-mediated site-specific recombination" or "tRNA-SSR". The
genomic recognition sites are as short as a 14 bp repeat
sequence (tRNA-Ser; GI13) and as long as a 56 bp repeat
sequence (tRNA-Leu; GI5). Table 3 summarizes the locations of all 3'end repeats of tRNA genes that are associated
with GIs in the five B. pseudomallei genomes. We noted
that not all GIs located next to tRNA genes contain the
short direct repeat sequences (Table 3). This suggests that
multiple recombination events at the same recognition
site may have caused the repeat sequences to disappear.
Details of tRNA sequences and their repeat sequences are
presented in Additional file 4: Tables S2.1-S2.5. Numbers

of tRNA-SSR are varied among the five B. pseudomallei
strains. At least 8, 3, 2, 5, and 5 tRNA-SSR events are
present in K96243, 1710b, 1106a, MSHR668, and
MSHR305, respectively. In addition, recombination
events at tRNA-Met, Pro, Thr, Ala, and Arg are common
across the genomes (Table 3), suggesting that these sites
serve as "genomic hotspots" for GI insertion in B. pseudomallei genomes.
To evaluate whether this type of genetic recombination is
present in other Burkholderia species, we performed similar analysis on four B. mallei genomes, strains ATCC23344
[19] (accession no. CP000010&CP000011), NCTC10247
(accession no. CP000547&CP000548), NCTC10229
(accession no. CP000545&CP000546), and SAVP1
(accession no. CP000525&CP000526); as well as the
genome of B. thailandensis strain E264 (accession no.
CP000085&CP000086). Similar to B. pseudomallei, tRNASSR events at tRNA-Pro genes were found in all four B.
mallei strains. In addition, these integration events were
all mediated by a well-known insertion element, IS407A
[19] (Figure 2). In B. thailandensis E264, Yu and colleagues
[20] previously identified 15 different genomic islands,
known as Bt-GI1 to Bt-GI15. We aligned all 15 GIs from
this B. thailandensis strain to the relative genomic locations of GIs in B. pseudomallei. In B. thailandensis E264, we
found one tRNA-SSR event present at tRNA-Ser and two at
tRNA-Arg, corresponding to the same genomic locations
as GI13, GI7.1, and GI12 in B. pseudomallei, respectively
[see Additional file 5]. In addition, the 3'end repeat downstream of tRNA-Arg in B. pseudomallei K96243 (GI12) and
B. thailandensis E264 has caused a recombinant tRNA-Ser.
This is an unusual event in B. pseudomallei genomes and it
is not known if this extra tRNA-Ser is functional in these
B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis strains. Figure 3 illustrates the recombination events that we propose caused
these new recombinant tRNAs-Ser in B. pseudomallei

K96243 and B. thailandensis E264. Details of all tRNA-SSR
events and 3'end tRNA repeat sequences in the B. thailandensis and B. mallei genomes are presented in Additional
file 4: Tables S2.6 - S2.10.
ii) Gene specific recombination
We identified a site-specific recombination event at the
mutS gene (DNA mismatch repair protein) in strain
MSHR305 that is associated with GI8c of B. pseudomallei.
The insertion of GI8c caused two direct repeats of 15 bp
located on genes BURPS305_7225 (DNA mismatch repair
protein) and BURPS305_7284 (mutS, DNA mismatch
repair protein). The genes have different sizes and are only
partially identical. A 15 bp recognition site, 5'ACGCCGATGATGCAG-3', of the BURPS305_7225 gene is
predicted to be involved in this genetic recombination
event (Figure 4). Additionally, we found that recombination at the mutS gene was also associated with Bt-GI4 in B.
thailandensis E264. To our knowledge, this mutS-specific
recombination is reported here for the first time.

Recognition sites at the 3'end of various tRNA genes and
mutS genes in B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis serve as
hotspots for genetic recombination in these bacterial species. tRNA-SSR has been reported in other Gram-negative
bacteria such as the VPI-2 pathogenicity island of Vibrio
cholerae, which is associated with the sequence of tRNASer [21]. Recombination at a specific gene also has been
reported at the glr (glutamate racemase) gene of Helicobacter pylori where it is served as the recognition or integration site of the cag pathogenicity islands [22].
Gene contents and predicted functional roles of GIs
Overall, most GIs contain genes known to be involved
with genomic mobility and genetic recombination. These
genes include transposase, integrase, conjugal plasmid
protein, recombinase, invertase, and resolvase genes.

Site-specific recombination (SSR) at tRNA-Pro in B. mallei causes a 3' end repeat 26 bp downstream of the
recombination site. This site contains insertion element IS407A, which is common in B. mallei genomes. This suggested that
IS407A was present in other mobile genetic elements when they were originally introduced to B. mallei genomes and the
recombination event was associated with tRNA-Pro.

More than 80% of GIs contain at least one transposase
genes. Transposase genes are known as major components of insertion elements in bacterial genomes. Most
common IS elements located in the genomic islands are
members of the IS3 family, including IS407A and ISBp1
[23]. IS407A was found in most GIs from all strains except
MSHR305, whereas ISBp1 was only found in GIs of strains
1710b and 1106a. MSHR305 contains unique IS elements
in its GIs, such as ISPsy16, ISAfe1, ISAfe4, and ISrso12, that
are uncommon in GIs from other strains. This suggests
that GIs in B. pseudomallei originated from different
sources, as they were brought to the species by different
insertion elements.
To predict functional roles of GIs in B. pseudomallei, we
classified all GIs from the five B. pseudomallei strains into
four different functional categories: prophage, metabo-

lism, pathogenicity, and unknown. GIs can contain genes
that are predicted to be involved in more than one of these
functions. In this study, we classified GIs based upon the
functional role of a majority of the genes. Abundance of
genomic islands for these four major categories in five
strains of B. pseudomallei is shown in Figure 5. Details of
all 4 categories are as follows:
i) Prophages
Many GIs in B. pseudomallei are prophages or prophagelike structures. The first functional prophage in B. pseudomallei was identified in K96243 [11]. Following UV
induction, strain K96243 produced at least one lysogenic
phage known as Î¦K96243, which was able to infect B.
mallei. DNA sequence analysis of Î¦K96243 indicates that
it is associated with GI2, which contains approximately
36.3 Kb of genes necessary for bacteriophage biogenesis.

Prevalence
Prevalence of GIs with four predicted functions in five reference B. pseudomallei strains. Interestingly, strains
MSHR668 and MSHR305 from Australia contain a high number of GIs associated with metabolism.

We note that GI2 is located directly downstream of tRNAPhe and contains a direct repeat (45 bp) of the 3' end
sequence of tRNA-Phe. This repeat sequence is believed to
be generated during bacteriophage lysogenization at the
recognition site, known as attB, which is the 3' end
sequence of tRNA-Phe. GI2 is not present in the other four
B. pseudomallei genomes examined here, but it is found in
other B. pseudomallei strains such as Pasteur 52237 (accession no.AAHV00000000) and S13 (accession no.
AAHW00000000) (data not shown).
Another well characterized prophage in Burkholderia species is associated with site-specific recombination at the
3'end of tRNA-Pro in B. thailandensis E125. Î¦E125, a temperate bacteriophage from B. thailandensis, has been
shown to insert as a lysogen in B. mallei ATCC23344 by
site-specific recombination at the 3'end of tRNA-Pro [24].
This type of prophage in B. pseudomallei was firstly
described in strain 1026b [25].
Bacteriophage induction occurred spontaneously during
normal growth of strain 1026b in liquid culture. We
found that strain 1710b contains a prophage (GI6b) that
is similar to the functional prophage of 1026b, but it is
two-fold larger in size. Both prophages are similar since
they are associated with tRNA-SSR at tRNA-Pro. Surprisingly, GI6b contains two 3'end tRNA-Pro repeats (49 and
23 bp; Additional file 4: Table S2.2), suggesting multiple
site-specific recombination events. There are no data demonstrating that GI6b in strain 1710b is a functional
prophage or can be induced. However, this putative
prophage does contain genes for bacteriophage biogenesis and also a putative phospholipase gene

(BURPS1710b_1675), suggesting that specialized transduction has occurred. Several studies have shown that
phospholipase genes are potential virulence genes in B.
pseudomallei [26,27].
Site-specific recombination that forms bacterial
prophages is not only associated with specific tRNAgenes, but also with specific gene targets. MSHR305 contains a putative prophage in GI8c that is associated with
the mutS gene. Recombination has created a small 15 bp
repeat downstream of the genomic island, as described
earlier. We also note that strain 1106a contains only one
prophage (GI10.2) in its genome, which is associated with
site-specific recombination at tRNA-Thr. Again, there are
no data confirming that the GI10.2 is a functional
prophage, although its structure does contain bacteriophage biogenesis genes.
ii) Metabolism
GIs containing metabolic genes are variable across different
B. pseudomallei strains and populations, which may affect
bacterial fitness and be related to specific environmental
niches. Nineteen of the 71 (26.7%) GIs we identified in B.
pseudomallei contain metabolic genes [see Additional file 3].
GI14 and GI14.1 are similar in term of gene contents and
both contain genes with predicted metabolic functions.
Hence, both represent potential metabolic islands. The
genes in these islands include peptidase enzymes such as
collagenase (BPSS0666), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent
taurine dioxygenase (BPSS0665), and x-prolyl-dipeptidyl
aminopeptidase (BPSS0654). These genes are predicted to
be involved in amino acid metabolism but there are no
studies on their actual functional roles. We used a PCR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/566

assay to query the presence/absence of the BPSS0654 taurine dioxygenase gene across large B. pseudomallei strain collections from Thailand and Australia. We found that this
gene is present in 99% and 97% of tested strains from these
two countries, respectively [see Additional file 6]. We note
that strains MSHR668 and MSHR305 contain six and eight
GIs with metabolic genes, respectively (Figure 5). Metabolic GI gene BURPS305_5421 (bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein) in MSHR305 has a very limited
distribution, occurring in less than 10% of tested strains
from Thailand and 56% of tested strains from Australia [see
Additional file 6].

used in their study. We have determined that these genes are
located in GI15d of MSHR305 and not observed in the other
four B. pseudomallei genome sequences examined here. We
examined the frequency of the bpaA gene (the largest gene in
GI15d) among diverse B. pseudomallei strains and found that
it was rare. Only 2.3% of strains contained this gene and,
interestingly, these strains were only found in clinical isolates
from Australia [see Figure 6b; Additional file 6]. B. pseudomallei virulence determinants are not well understood, but animal models have demonstrated that different strains do
differ in their virulence levels [30,31] and this could be
related to variation in GIs and GI content.

iii) Pathogenicity
We have identified two different groups of genes in B.
pseudomallei GIs that could have functional roles in bacterial pathogenicity, especially bacterial adherence. They are
genes that encode for filamentous hemagglutinin proteins
(FHA) and two-partner secretion systems (TPS).

iv) Unknown functional roles
The functional roles of many genomic islands in B. pseudomallei (32%) is unknown; most genes found in B. pseudomallei GIs have only hypothetical protein predictions
that do not match any characterized proteins databases.

FHA genes in B. pseudomallei are located on different
genomic islands and varied among strains. Strain 1106a
contains three different clusters of fha genes located at
GI5a.1, GI11.1, and GI16.1; strain 1710b contains two
clusters (GI5a and GI16.1); strain K96243 contains one
cluster at GI16; and strains MSHR668 and MSHR305 contain only one cluster at GI5a.1 and GI5a.2, respectively.
Homologs of fha genes have been reported in other Gramnegative bacteria where they have functional roles in virulence. When we compared the fhaB gene, which is the largest gene in each fha gene cluster, to its homolog in
Bordetella pertussis, we found high similarity to all three B.
pseudomallei gene clusters. Thus, it seems likely that all
three genes encode a filamentous hemagglutinin domain
protein in B. pseudomallei [see Additional file 7]. More
recently, Sim and Yu et al. reported that the experimental
mutation one fhaB gene (BPSS2053, equivalent to fhaB3
gene in our study) in B. pseudomallei DD503 caused the
reduction of microbial adherence to human epithelial
cells [28]. We also examined the occurrence of this gene
among diverse B. pseudomallei populations and found that
fhaB copy number varied among the strains. Most B. pseudomallei strains from Thailand and Australia contained
either two clusters of fhaB genes (cluster I from GI5a/
GI5a.1/GI5a.2 and cluster III from GI16/GI16.1), or a
fhaB gene from cluster III (GI16/GI16.1) alone. In contrast, cluster II found in strain 1106a (GI11.1) was very
rare. Details of the distribution of fhaB gene clusters in B.
pseudomallei are demonstrated in Figure 6a and a list of
tested strains is provided in Additional file 6.
Two-partner secretion systems in B. pseudomallei were first
described by Brown and colleagues in 2002 [29]. They
reported that this particular two-partner secretion system was
encoded by genes bpaAB, which were located in the GIs of
strain 08 but absent in many other B. pseudomallei strains

The four categories of functional roles of GIs described
above are based primarily upon computer predictions and
only a minimal number of laboratory studies. Direct functional studies of GI genes are very rare, and most functional genomics studies rely upon B. pseudomallei gene
conservation compared to other species. Almost all comparative genomic studies among B. pseudomallei strains
identify differences primarily among genomic islands
genes [25,32,33]. In a 2006 study by Duangsonk and colleagues [32], GI genes identified by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) between two different B.
pseudomallei strains were used to develop a variable amplicon typing (VAT) scheme. VAT was applied successfully to
population genetics problems and differentiated groups
of B. pseudomallei strains that caused different clinical outcomes. Most recently, genes of five GIs from K96243,
including GI2, GI6, GI9, GI11, and GI16, were used to
measure frequency values among clinical and environmental B. pseudomallei strains from Thailand [34]. There
were no significant differences between environmental
and disease-associated isolates for these genes. However,
because only GIs from K96243 were used, this study was
not representative of the large GI diversity observed
among multiple B. pseudomallei genomes. Still, this is one
of the first examples attempting to correlate these very
important genomic components to clinically relevant
phenotypes. Because of the importance of GIs in the
accessory genome of B. pseudomallei, they may play important roles in various phenotypic differences within the B.
pseudomallei species. Studies of GI genes in various fields
of research, such as population genetics and functional
genomics, warrant further investigation but this must be
based upon pan-genomic analysis using all available data.

Conclusion
The data presented here suggest that a large number of GIs
have been acquired by horizontal acquisitions and that

these GIs represent a major source of genomic diversity in
B. pseudomallei. The proposed nomenclature suggested
above will be important for effective communication in the
research community and for cataloging the highly variable
GIs. tRNA-mediated site-specific recombination appears to
be an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfers
of GIs. The differential presence of GIs in multiple strains
also demonstrates the limited phylogenetic distribution of
mobile genetic elements in this bacterial species. GIs are
part of the accessory genome, which have not been studied
thoroughly in B. pseudomallei. Various fields of postgenomics, such as population genetics and functional
genomics of GIs, are worthy of further investigations.

Methods
Genomic Data
Genomes of five clinical B. pseudomallei strains were used in
this study. These strains included K96243, 1710b, 1106a,
MSHR668, and MSHR305. Clinical information and
genomic features of all five strains are summarized in Table 1.
Comparative genomics, genome alignment, and
bioinformatics of genomic island
Comparisons of the genome sequences for most aspects of
this study were performed using ACT (Artemis comparison tool) [15]. Each genomic comparison file was generated from NCBI- Local BLAST program, which is available
in BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor [35]. Dinucleotide

signatures among all genomic islands were analyzed using
an in-house Java program. Dinucleotide frequencies and
indices were calculated according to Karlin and Burge
[17]. Circular diagrams of all genomes used in this study
were made by using CGView [36].
Experimental examination of genomic islands
SYBR-Green real-time PCR assays were developed to
examine the presence/absence of genomic island genes
across multiple strains of B. pseudomallei. Specific genes
from six genomic islands were selected and used as the targets for PCR. These included three different clusters of
fhaB genes located in several different GIs; bpaA, a known
gene encoding for a two-partner secretion system; and two
metabolic genes, BPSS0654 of GI14 and BURPS305_5421
of GI14a. Details of PCR primers and target genes are
described in Additional file 8. We used genomic DNA
samples from five genome-sequenced strains, K96243,
1710b, 1106a, MSHR668 and MSHR305 as positive and/
or negative PCR controls. A total of 468 genomic DNA
samples were used in the analysis.

pseudomallei may have the same functional role as the filamentous
hemagglutinin, a virulence effector molecule in B. pertussis.
