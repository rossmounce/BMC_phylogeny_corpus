Abstract
Background: LTR Retrotransposons transpose through reverse transcription of an RNA
intermediate and are ubiquitous components of all eukaryotic genomes thus far examined. Plant
genomes, in particular, have been found to be comprised of a remarkably high number of LTR
retrotransposons. There is a significant body of direct and indirect evidence that LTR
retrotransposons have contributed to gene and genome evolution in plants.
Results: To explore the evolutionary history of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and
their impact on the genome of Oryza sativa, we have extended an earlier computer-based survey
to include all identifiable full-length, fragmented and solo LTR elements in the rice genome database
as of April 2002. A total of 1,219 retroelement sequences were identified, including 217 full-length
elements, 822 fragmented elements, and 180 solo LTRs. In order to gain insight into the
chromosomal distribution of LTR-retrotransposons in the rice genome, a detailed examination of
LTR-retrotransposon sequences on Chromosome 10 was carried out. An average of 22.3 LTRretrotransposons per Mb were detected in Chromosome 10.
Conclusions: Gypsy-like elements were found to be >4 × more abundant than copia-like elements.
Eleven of the thirty-eight investigated LTR-retrotransposon families displayed significant subfamily
structure. We estimate that at least 46.5% of LTR-retrotransposons in the rice genome are older
than the age of the species (< 680,000 years). LTR-retrotransposons present in the rice genome
range in age from those just recently inserted up to nearly 10 million years old. Approximately 20%
of LTR retrotransposon sequences lie within putative genes. The distribution of elements across
chromosome 10 is non-random with the highest density (48 elements per Mb) being present in the
pericentric region.

Background
LTR Retrotransposons transpose through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and are ubiquitous components of all eukaryotic genomes thus far examined [1].
Plant genomes, in particular, have been found to be comprised of a remarkably high number of LTR retrotransposons [2-4]. For example, more than half of the maize

[5] and over 90% of the wheat [6] genomes are comprised
of LTR retrotransposons. There is a significant body of
direct and indirect evidence that LTR retrotransposons
have contributed to gene and genome evolution in both
animals and plants [4,7-13].

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for over half of the
world's population. Unlike most other cereal grasses, rice
has a relatively small genome estimated at 430 Mb
[14,15]. Comparative genetic maps within the grass family indicate extensive regions of conserved gene content
and orders [16]. The development of many important
tools for genetic analysis, including excellent genetic and
physical maps [17,18], efficient genetic transformation
techniques [19], an ever increasing dataset of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) [20], and a large collection of diverse
germplasm [21] has established rice as an ideal model for
the study of mechanisms underlying plant evolution. The
recent release of draft genome sequences of two rice subspecies, indica [22] and japonica [23], and ongoing efforts
to compile a complete japonica rice genome sequence
publicly available by International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) [15], promises to greatly facilitate the
study of rice genome evolution.
Most TEs were earlier discovered by chance or by limited
assays using conserved regions of retrotransposons in rice
[24-26]. For example, based on the screening of genomic
libraries with a conserved retrotransposon probe, Hirochika and his colleagues [24] made an estimate of ~1000
retrotransposons totally in the rice genome, which fall
into 32 families. By hybridizing a rice BAC library with a
variety of RT probes, however, Wang et al. [27] estimated
that the genome contains only about 100 copia-like elements in the entire haploid genome. Computer based
sequence similarity searches of the nucleic acid databases
are considered to be a more accurate method to identify
retrotransposon families and estimate TE content and distribution in rice genome [28-31]. Using a new data-mining program (LTR retrotransposon structure program), we
previously mined the GeneBank rice database (GBRD) as
well as a more extensive Monsanto rice data set (MRD)
(259 Mb) of LTR retrotransposons [32]. Including numerous LTR retrotransposon families that have not been previously reported, our comprehensive survey indicated that
there are at least 59 distinct O. sativa LTR retrotransposon
families comprising ≈17% of the rice genome. Although
the majority of rice retrotransposon families have been
identified and their phylogenetic relationships have been
inferred based on the sequence similarity of the RT
domains, the evolutionary dynamics, substructure, and
relative integration time or age of rice retrotransposon elements remain poorly understood.
Our laboratory has long been interested in the evolution
of LTR retrotransposons and their contribution to genome
evolution. The current availability of a considerable part
of the rice sequences at NCBI database is providing an
excellent and timely opportunity to analyze the evolutionary history of rice LTR-retrotransposons. The present study
was undertaken (i) to assess retrotransposon diversity and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/18

timing of insertion events by identifying all distinguishable rice LTR-retrotransposon sequences in the published
sequence database, and(ii) to further infer, based on the
establishment of substructure of all characterized families
using the sequence divergence among the more rapidly
evolving LTRs, possible retrotransposon evolution. In
order to gain insight into the chromosomal distribution
of LTR-retrotransposons in the rice genome, we also
selected chromosome 10 to conduct a detailed examination of the intra-chromosomal distribution of LTR-retrotransposons. Finally, we have made a preliminary attempt
to assess the potential contribution of LTR-retrotransposons to the evolution of gene structure and function in
rice by identifying elements located in or near putative
genes.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of O. sativa LTR Retrotransposons
LTR retrotransposons displaying ≥ 90% reverse transcriptase (RTs) pairwise identity at the amino acid level
were, by earlier convention, assigned to the same family
[33]. Using this criterion, McCarthy et al. [32] previously
identified and characterized 55 families of LTR retrotransposons in the rice genome. Four additional groups of nonautonomous LTR retrotransposons identified in this previous study did not display a RT sequence homology but
were, nevertheless, designated as families based on their
distinct structures [32]. Only 38 retrotransposon families
for which both LTRs have been identified [32] were
included in this study.

In this study, we have extended the earlier survey of fulllength LTR retrotransposons in the rice genome to include
all identifiable fragments of LTR retrotransposon
sequences. In accord with previously established criteria
[34], we classified rice LTR retrotransposon sequences
into three major groups: 1) full-length elements: a) autonomous full-length elements contain all of the characteristic
features of LTR retrotransposons including putative gag,
pol and, in some cases, env genes flanked by LTRs; b) nonautonomous full-length elements are a recently identified
[32,39] sub-class of full-length elements that have two
LTRs flanking a series of repeating motifs of various
lengths. Although numerous, relatively small and, in
some cases, recently transposed, these non-autonomous
elements encode none of the typical LTR retrotransposon
ORFs and must acquire essential reverse transcription and
intergration functions in trans; 2) solo LTRs are solitary LTR
elements believed to be the products of recombination
events between the flanking LTRs of full-length elements
[1]; 3) fragmented elements are defined as partially deleted
or truncated LTR retrotransposon sequence. This third category is a "catch all" grouping that includes all LTR retrotransposon sequences that are neither full-length
elements or solo LTRs. For information purposes, we

We identified a total of 1219 LTR retrotransposon

numerous than copia-like elements (990 vs. 229). The
number of element sequences within families was found
to vary considerably, ranging from 1(Osr19) to 255
(Osr34) (Table 1). We identified 217 full-length elements
representing 17.8 % of all LTR retrotransposon sequences
identified. Osr27 contains the largest number of fulllength elements (61) in the genome, while 12 families
(Osr5–7, 14, 19–20, 22–23, 28, 42–44) have only 1 fulllength element. The most abundant copia-like family was
Osr8 (59 sequences) while Osr34 is the most abundant
gypsy-like family (255 sequences).

Significant sub-structure was detected in eleven families
by neighbor-joining and parsimony criteria (Osr4, 10, 12,
25, 26, 27, 30, 34, 35, 43, and 44).

Of the total LTR retrotransposon sequences identified,
822 or 67.4% were found to be fragmented or truncated
elements. Fragmented elements were detected in 31 families varying in number from 1 (Osr4, 20, 22, and 23) to
214 (Osr34) per family. Seven families of LTR retrotransposons (Osr2, 12, 16, 19, 24, 35, and 36) were found to
contain no fragmented elements. We identified 179 solo
LTRs representing 14.8 % of all LTR retrotransposon
sequences identified. The solo LTRs are distributed over
21 families (Osr1, 4, 8, 13–17, 25–27, 29–34, 37, and 40–
41), and range in number from 1 (Osr15 and Osr16) to 39
(Osr27) per family. The Osr19 family consists of a single
full-length element without any distinguishable fragmented elements or solo LTRs.

Aging of the LTR-Retrotransposons of O. sativa
LTR nucleotide identity can be used to estimate the time
of LTR retrotransposon integration [37-39]. Of the 217
full-length elements that we have identified in O. sativa,
116 (53.5%) have >99% LTR similarity with 34 of these
(15.7%) being identical. The remaining 101(46.5%)have
relatively low levels of nucleotide divergence (<99%).
Among them, 31(14%), 24(11%), 30(14%), and 15(7%)
fell into different ranges of LTR similarities of 98–99%,
97–98%, 95–97%, and <95%, respectively. Identical LTRs
imply that the elements have inserted recently and have
not had time to accumulate mutations between LTRs.
Using the average neutral substitution rate for grasses
[37,39,40] of 0.065 substitutions per site per million years
and the intra-element LTR divergence calculated here, we
have computed the estimated integration time of the 181
elements with LTR nucleotide divergence (Table 1, see
Additional file). Based on the full-length elements available in this study, we estimate over half of rice retroelements (53.5%) with >99% LTR identity have inserted
within the last 770,000 years while the older elements
(46.5%) have integrated over a span of 770,000–
7,700,000 years ago. Figure 3, 4 and 5 show estimated
ages of all the full-length elements found in our study.

Other distinguishing characteristics of the LTR retrotransposon sequences identified in this study are presented in
Table 1 (see Additional file 1), including clone accession
numbers, chromosomal location, sequence length, target
site repeats (TSRs), LTR pairwise identities and estimated
element age. TSRs result from a duplication of the unoccupied insertion site following element insertion [35].
The TSRs of all rice LTR retrotransposon are five bp long
except for Osr26.1 which has a TSR of seven bp. While
members of O. sativa families share >90% RT sequence
identity [32], sequence identity values among the more
rapidly evolving LTRs are highly variable within families,
ranging from 75.505% to 100%.
Phylogenetic Substructure of O. sativa LTR
Retrotransposons
The slowly evolving RT encoding region of LTR retrotransposons is ideal for calculating evolutionary distances
among even distantly related families of retroelements
[6,36]. However, sequence analyses of the more rapidly
evolving LTRs are better suited for the characterization of
phylogenetic substructure within families of LTR retrotransposons. We used LTR sequence divergence among
elements within each family to identify sub-structure
within the O. sativa LTR retrotransposon (Osr) phylogeny.
Distribution of Rice LTR-retrotransposons on
Chromosome 10

The Osr26 family, for example, is comprised of 32 elements falling into at least 5 distinct clades (Fig. 1). The
Osr27 family, which is composed of 134 elements, displayed complicated substructure, consisting of at least 10
divergent clades with strong bootstrap support (Fig. 2).
The remaining 27 families are closely related and displayed no significant intra-family substructure.

The LTRs of one gypsy-like (Osr27.2) and one copia-like
(Osr13.8) element displayed atypically high levels of
sequence divergence indicating that these elements are
exceptionally old or possibly that these elements are, in
fact, hybrid elements generated by homologous recombination or some other recombination process. Indeed,
such inter-element recombination events have been previously documented in yeast [41,42]. However, in this case,
recombination is unlikely since the target site duplications of these (and indeed all full-length elements identified in this study) are identical. Thus, we have no direct
evidence that any of the full-length rice LTR retrotransposons analyzed in this study were generated by
recombination.

At the time of this study, about 48% rice genomic
sequences were available in the public database, which

that two families (Osr12 and 33) have more elements in
Chromosome 10 than in the whole sequenced genome.
This is not unexpected because many sequences from
Chromosome 10 were released after we stopped searching

rice genomic sequences in GenBank as of January 1, 2002
(see methods).
O. sativa LTR retroelement sequences are associated with
putative genes
In an initial effort to determine whether and how frequently LTR retrotransposon sequences are associated
with putative genes in the rice genome, we examined elements from all 19 families of copia-like elements and 5

a. No full-length element was identified for this family in the GenBank database of O. sativa. Location given is for an example RT in the database

followed by solo LTRs (3%) and full-length elements
(2%). While these numbers are likely to change somewhat
as the rice genome is better annotated, these preliminary
estimates indicate that the potential contribution of LTR

retrotranspson sequences to the evolution of gene structure and function in rice may be significant.

Figure 7
The distribution of full-length, solo and fragmented LTR elements along the chromosome 10
The distribution of full-length, solo and fragmented LTR elements along the chromosome 10. The borders of the pericentromeric regions of chromosome 10 were assigned as being 5 cM from the center of the centromere on each arm. The remainders of the chromosome were designated as arms. Both copia-like and gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons exhibit nonrandom
clustering along the chromosome. More LTR retrotransposons reside in the pericentric regions of the chromosome than in
the arms, and short arm of Chromosome 10 also displays a higher density of the elements than long arm. The number of gypsylike elements are more than that of copia-like elements on chromosome 10.

Conclusions
We have previously determined that two classes (gypsy-like
and copia-like) of full-length LTR retrotransposons comprise ~17% of the Oryza sativa genome[32]. In this study,
we have extended the earlier survey to include all identifiable fragments of LTR retrotransposon sequences. We
have classified rice LTR retrotransposon sequences into
three groups: full-length elements, solo LTRs, and fragmented elements. We have identified a total of 1219 LTR

retrotransposon sequences in the region of the O. sativa
genome analyzed in this study distributed over 38 families. Gypsy-like elements are >4 × more abundant than
copia-like elements. Eleven of the thirty-eight investigated
LTR-retrotransposon families display significant subfamily structure. We estimate that at least 46% of LTR-retrotransposons in the Oryza sativa genome are older than
the age of the species (<680,000 years). A detailed examination of chromosome 10 revealed that LTR retrotranspoPage 12 of 18

Insertion frequencies of full-length, solo and fragmented LTR elements along the chromosome 10
Insertion frequencies of full-length, solo and fragmented LTR elements along the chromosome 10. DNA density for chromosomal arms and pericentromeric regions was calculated from the total DNA of three contigs (~10.4 cM and ~62.8 cM in arms,
~10.5 cM in pericentromeric regions) on Chromosome 10 (see Methods). Both copia-like and gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons
exhibit nonrandom clustering along the chromosome. More LTR retrotransposons reside in the pericentric regions of the
chromosome than in the arms, and short arm of Chromosome 10 also displays a higher density of the elements than long arm.
The number of gypsy-like elements are more than that of copia-like elements on chromosome 10.

son sequences are not randomly distributed across this
chromosome but are more dense in the pericentric region.
We found that aproximately 20% of Oryza sativa LTR
retrotransposon sequences lie within putative genes and
thus may play a significant role in gene evolution.

Methods
Sequence identification and Retrieval
Whole genome analysis
LTRs representing previously identified families of rice
LTR retrotransposons [32] were used as queries in

BLASTN searches against rice genomic sequences present
in GenBank as of January 1, 2002 http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. About ~17% of rice genomic
sequences was represented in this release. Subsequent
sequence similarity searches against 29,285,477 bp of the
complete chromosome 10 sequences in the GeneBank
were performed up to April 25, 2002. Only 38
retrotransposon families for which both LTRs have been
identified [32] were included in our study. To be considered an LTR sequence in this study, a BLAST "hit" had to
display • 60% sequence homology to the LTR query

a. No full-length element was identified for this family in the GenBank database of O. sativa. Location given is for an example RT in the database

sequence in a pair-wise comparison test [43] and have a
size • 40% of that of the LTR query sequence. Each LTR
identified by these criteria was given the name of the Osr
(O. sativa retrotransposon) to which it was most
homologous.
Multiple Sequence Alignments and Phylogenetic Analyses
Using the clone coordinates from the BLAST searches, the
rice LTR sequences were copied and placed into individual
files. Alignments were created using ClustalW and edited
with MacVector 7.0 http://www.gcg.com/. ClustalX 1.8
[44] was used to generate neighbor-joining (NJ) trees with
bootstrap values and visualized with TreeView 1.5.3 [45].
Age determination of elements
Full-length elements were aged by comparing their 5' and
3' LTR sequences [37]. Kimura-2 parameter distances (K)

between 5' and 3' LTRs of individual elements were calculated by MEGA-2 [46]. The average substitution rate (r) of
6.5 × 10-9 substitutions per synonymous site per year for
grasses [40] was used to calibrate the ages of the rice LTRretrotransposons. The time (T) since element insertion
was estimated using the formula T = K /2r, where T = time
of divergence. K = divergence, and r = substitution rate
[47].
Location of LTR-retrotransposon sequences on
Chromosome 10
Rice LTR retrotransposons were used as queries in BLASTN
searches against chromosome 10 sequences present in
GenBank as of April 25, 2002. The distribution of LTR retrotransposon sequences on Chromosome 10 of
Nipponbare was estimated based on the position of LTR
retrotransposon sequences in PACs and BACs http://

in pericentromeric regions) on Chromosome 10. According to the estimates of Harushima et al. [17] and Cheng et
al. [48], we assigned the borders of the pericentromeric
regions of chromosome 10 as being 5 cM from the center
of the centromere on each arm. The remainder of the
chromosome was designated as arms.
Gene Annotation
The O. sativa expressed sequence tag database http://
www.ncbi.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html was BLASTed (in

April, 2002) for homology to all (228) copia-like LTR
sequences and 278 gypsy-like LTR sequences of 5 representative families. About ~19% of rice genomic sequences was
represented in this release. TBLASTN searches (default
parameters) of these LTR associated genes were then ran
against the NCBI O. sativa genome database to search for
homology to previously characterized genes. GeneFinder
http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/Genefinder
was used to delineate the exon boundaries of the putative
genes.
