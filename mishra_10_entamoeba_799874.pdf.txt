Entamoeba histolytica Phosphoserine
aminotransferase (EhPSAT): insights into the
structure-function relationship
Vibhor Mishra1, Vahab Ali2, Tomoyoshi Nozaki3, Vinod Bhakuni1*

Abstract
Background: Presence of phosphorylated Serine biosynthesis pathway upstream to the de novo cysteine
biosynthesis pathway makes PSAT a crucial enzyme. Besides this, phoshoserine produced by the enzyme can also
be taken up directly by cysteine synthase as a substrate. PSAT is a PLP dependent enzyme where the cofactor
serves as an epicenter for functional catalysis with the active site architecture playing crucial role in optimum
function of the enzyme.
Findings: EhPSAT is a homodimer of molecular mass 86 kDa. To understand the structural modulations associated
with pH dependent changes in functional activity of EhPSAT detailed biophysical studies were carried out. pH
alterations had no significant effect on the secondary structure, cofactor orientation and oligomeric configuration
of the enzyme however, pH dependent compaction in molecular dimensions was observed. Most interestingly, a
direct correlation between pH induced modulation of functional activity and orientation of Trp 101 present in the
active site of the enzyme was observed. Sodium halides nullified the pH induced global changes in the enzyme,
however differential effect of these salts on the active site microenvironment and functional activity of the enzyme
was observed.
Conclusions: The study unequivocally demonstrates that pH induced selective modification of active site
microenvironment and not global change in structure or oligomeric status of the enzyme is responsible for the pH
dependent change in enzymatic activity of PSAT.

Background
PSAT is a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme that belongs to
the a-family of pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP) enzymes.
It catalyzes the reversible conversion of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to L-phosphoserine in a glutamate linked
transamination reaction, the second step of phosphorylated serine biosynthetic pathway. Earlier studies on
PSAT from E coli [1], Bacillus alcalophilus [2], Arabidopsis thaliana [3], and Homo sapiens [4] suggests that
the enzyme exist as a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass between 40 to 48 kDa. Each subunit is predominantly composed of two domains, a large PLP
binding domain and a small domain comprising of Cterminal part along with a short N-terminal portion [1].

Structurally PSAT is a a/b protein with one PLP molecule present in the active site, per monomer. The
dimeric configuration of the enzyme is essential for the
functional activity [5]. The active site amino acid residues are nearly conserved in all PSATs (Fig. 1A).
Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that
infects the gastrointestinal tract and causes amoebic
colitis and extra intestinal abscesses in humans [6].
Role of L- serine in a number of important metabolic
pathways in the parasite has been well established [7,8]
Predominantly it serves as a precursor molecule for Lcysteine biosynthesis which plays important role in
survival, growth, attachment [9,10], anti-oxidative
defense [11], and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis [12]. From
the amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic
analyses EhPSAT shows close association with bacteroide PSAT [13].

The inset shows stacking of the cofactor PLP(cyan color) and the Trp101(brown color) at the active site.

The cofactor PLP plays a significant role in structural
stabilization of PSAT from extremophiles [14] and
serves as a vital tool for understanding the active site
stochiometry and conformational rearrangements under
various experimental conditions. We have carried out a
detailed study on the pH induced changes in the functional, structural and stability properties of EhPSAT and
effect of salts on these changes. Additional file 1 carries
detailed information regarding the materials and experimental procedures applied in the presented study.

Results
EhPSAT production and oligomeric state

The purified protein was homogenous as indicated by a
single protein band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) and a single
peak in ESI-MS of molecular mass about 43 kDa (data
not shown). The SEC profile of EhPSAT (Fig. 3A) along
with glutaraldehyde crosslinking experiments (Fig. 3B)
demonstrates that the recombinant EhPSAT is a homodimer under physiological conditions.
pH dependent changes in functional and structural
properties of EhPSAT
Functional property

EhPSAT showed pH dependent bell shaped enzymatic
activity profile for forward reaction with maximum activity
at pH 8.5 (Fig. 2B). At pH 10 and 6.0, the enzyme retained
about 50% and 20% residual activity, respectively.
For understanding the structural basis of such a characteristic pH dependence of enzymatic activity, structural changes in the enzyme under these conditions,
were studied.

Secondary structure

The secondary structure elements are generally conserved among PSAT family of enzymes [1,2]. The secondary structure of EhPSAT as characterized by far-UV
CD shows that it is a a/b type protein (Fig. 2C inset).
No significant alterations in the CD signal at 222 nm
were observed for the enzyme between pH 9 and 6(Fig.
2C). Hence, pH change does not significantly affect the
secondary structure of EhPSAT.
Active site microenvironment

No significant alteration in fluorescence polarization of
PLP was observed between pH 6 to 9 suggesting no
change in orientation of cofactor PLP of EhPSAT with
change in pH (Fig. 2D). Interestingly for tryptophan
residues, with decrease in pH from 10 to 6 an almost
linear enhancement in fluorescence polarization was
observed, (Fig. 2E). This demonstrates that low pH
induces restriction in orientation of tryptophan moiety
present in enzyme. EhPSAT contains 3 tryptophan residues, two in the N-terminal region and one, Trp 101, in
the active site. We wanted to see whether the above
observed changes correspond to the active site tryptophan moiety or not.
On reduction of PLP aldimine, the cofactor serves as a
reporter molecule itself and also as an energy acceptor
of tryptophan fluorescence provided the two moieties
are within a distance of 5 Å [15,16]. For EhPSAT, PLP
and Trp 101 are stacked close to each other at the
active site (Fig. 1B inset). Fig. 2F summarizes the effect
of pH on the fluorescence spectra of EhPSAT on excitation at 295 nm. At pH 8.0 and 9.0, single fluorescence
emission maxima at 335 nm and 340 nm, respectively

was observed. However, at pH 6 and 7, two clear emission maxima centered at 386 and 335 nm, respectively
were observed. Furthermore, on decrease in pH from 9
to 6, a decrease in intensity of signal at 335 nm and a
concomitant increase in intensity of signal at 386 nm
were observed. These observations demonstrate that
between pH 9 and 6 the two fluorophores PLP and
Trp101 come closer to each other and show FRET. The
FRET studies along with the PLP polarization studies
(Fig. 2D to 2F) demonstrate that with change in pH, the
orientation of Trp101 residue is modified such that it
comes close to PLP cofactor in 3D space.
Molecular dimension, Subunit configuration and stability

On decrease in pH from 9 to 6, decrease in the hydrodynamic radii of the enzyme (Fig. 3A) was observed

indicating either pH-induced dissociation of native dimer
to monomer or compaction of dimeric conformation.
Chemical crosslinking is a well accepted technique for
studying changes in the oligomeric status of a protein
under experimental conditions [16-21]. Fig. 3B shows the
SDS PAGE profile of the glutaraldehyde cross linked protein samples. A single species corresponding to dimer of
enzyme was observed under all the conditions studied.
The stability of dimeric configuration over a broad pH
range has also been reported for PSAT from Bacillus circulans ssp. Alkalophilus. These studies collectively demonstrate that PSAT dimer is stable over a broad pH range.

EhPSAT at pH 8.5 and 6 as monitored by the loss of
CD signal at 222 and 415 nm. Superimposable far-UV

and near UV CD signals demonstrate a high degree of
structural cooperativity exist in EhPSAT under these
conditions. However, for pH 8.5 and 6, Tm of about 67°
C and 79°C, respectively were observed. These obeservations are in agreement with the ProTherm database as
reported earlier for Bacillus circulans ssp. Alkalophilus
[14]. Hence, decrease in pH leads to enhanced thermal
stability of PSAT.
Effect of sodium halides on the enzymatic activity

Salts affect the physico-chemical properties of proteins
primarily through modulation of electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions acting on the protein molecule. Fig. 4A shows the effect of 200 mM NaF, NaCl
and NaBr on the enzymatic activity at pH 8.5. NaCl and
NaBr inhibited the enzymatic activity in a concentration
dependent manner, while NaF showed no such effect.
Detailed studies with NaCl and NaF on pH induced
changes in the functional activity (Fig. 4B) clearly show
no significant change in the pH dependence of enzymatic activity for NaF. Interestingly, in presence of NaCl
the maximum activity was found to be retained over a
broader range of pH 7.5 to 8.5 and even at pH 6 about
40% residual activity was observed.
Effect of NaCl and NaF on pH induced modification at the
active site and strain of internal aldimine of EhPSAT

With change in pH from 8.5 to 6 in the presence of
NaCl, no effect on fluorescence polarization of PLP was

Page 5 of 8

observed (Fig. 2D). However, the tryptophan fluorescence polarization was found to enhance under these
conditions, but to a significantly lower extent as compared to that in absence of NaCl. This demonstrates
that the pH-induced change in orientation of tryptophan
residue is modulated by the presence of NaCl (Fig. 2E).
FRET analyses also support these observations, Fig. 4C
and 4D show no significant alteration in the tryptophan
microenvironment in presence of NaCl between pH 9
and 6. In contrast for NaF, FRET profile similar to that
in absence of salt was observed (Fig. 2F).
The first step in the catalytic mechanism of the
enzyme is transfer of a proton of charged substrate
amino group to the unprotonated imine nitrogen of the
internal Shiff’s base in the Michaelis complex. This is
followed by nucleophilic attack of the substrate amino
group on C4’ carbon atom of the cofactor resulting in
formation of external aldimine intermediate between
PLP and substrate. In PLP catalysis, the electron sink
property of cofactor plays an important role. It has been
proposed that in the catalytic mechanism the strain and
distortion of conjugated π-electron system of PLP and
internal aldimine in PSAT are important [22]. When the
internal aldimine is protonated a single positive CD
band is observed at 410-415 nm but it is shifted to 345350 nm when the internal aldimine is deprotonated
[22]. The additional file 2 shows the pH dependence of

near-UV CD spectra of EhPSAT in presence and
absence of NaCl. Under both conditions, between pH 6
and 8, a major CD band at 410-415 nm was observed
suggesting that the protein is predominantly in protonated state under these conditions. However, for protein
samples at pH 9 and 10 the major CD band is shifted to
345-350 nm suggesting that the protein is predominantly in unprotonated state. These observations indicate that the pH- induced difference in the functional
activity in absence and presence of NaCl is not due to
modulation of pKa of the catalytic reaction.

thermal unfolding of EhPSAT

Fig. 4E and 4F, presents the SEC profile of EhPSAT at
pH 6,7,8 and 9 in presence of 200 mM NaCl and NaF,
respectively. No significant change in molecular dimension of the protein with change in pH was observed

Page 6 of 8

suggesting that pH induced compaction is abolished by
salts. Fig. 5A to 5D, shows the thermal unfolding at pH
8.5 and 6.0, respectively in presence of 200 mM NaCl
and NaF. At pH 8.5, a significant difference in Tm associated with loss of secondary structure and dissociation
of PLP from enzyme was observed suggesting the thermal denaturation process in presence of salts to be a
noncooperative event. However, at pH 6.0 in presence
of salts changes similar to that in absence of salts were
observed.

Discussion
The active site of PSAT is optimized for binding of Lglutamate, 3-phosphohydroxy pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate
and L-phosphoserine [1]. Structural fluctuations in the
native state of protein significantly influence the functional activity [23]. The secondary structure of EhPSAT
is resistant to pH change between 9 and 6 similar to

ellepticity measured at 222 nm and 415 nm, respectively. A linear extrapolation of baselines in pre and post transition regions was used to
determine the fraction unfolded protein within the transition region by assuming a two state mechanism of unfolding. The thermal transition of
the enzyme was found to be irreversible with precipitation observed at the end of the scan.

Bacillus circulans spp. Alkalophilus (BCIR) PSAT [14].
Hence, the secondary structure of PSATs is stable over
a wide pH range and so does not play any significant
role in modulation of enzymatic activity.
Crystallographic studies on BALC PSAT clearly suggest the presence of ion binding sites on PSAT molecule[2]. Four Cl - ions in particular are found to be
present 2 per monomer close to the active site residue
Trp102. Main chain amides of Ser101, Trp102, Thr152
and Ile153 form the binding site for one Cl- ion and the
second one is located between positively charged side
chain of Arg334 and the N ε1 atom of Trp102(amino
acid position described according to BALC PSAT) [2].
Amino acids responsible for chloride ion binding are
conserved in BALC PSAT and EhPSAT (Fig. 1A). It is
possible that direct binding of Cl- and Br- ions (ionic
radii 1.67Å and 1.96 Å, respectively) in the active site
leads to structural modifications which results in significant loss of functional activity. F- Ions being smaller in
size (ionic radii 1.36 Å) will not bind to the anion binding site(s) with similar affinity and hence not bring
about similar change in active site conformation as
chloride or bromide ions. This possibility is also supported by the observation that SO42- ions as they also
inhibit the enzymatic activity similar to chloride or bromide ions (Data not shown).
The two active sites of PSAT dimer are situated
approximately 20 Å apart at the subunit interface. In
each active site a PLP molecule is bound with an aldimine linkage to Lys 191 and aditionally hydrogen
bonded to residues from the two large domains, besides
this prominent stacking interaction at the active site
between the pyridine ring of PLP and the indole ring of
Trp101, which are usually separated by a distance of
approximately 5 Å, occurs on the re-face of the cofactor
[[14], this study]. No change in orientation of PLP and
tryptophan aromatic ring occurs upon pH change [14].
In case of EhPSAT we observed a pH dependent change
in orientation of tryptophan moiety but not for the PLP
as monitored by fluorescence polarization (Fig. 2D and
2E). Presence of two fluorophores predominantly
stacked with each other in the active site invariably
serves as an important tool for probing fine fluctuations
of the pH sensitive active site microenvironment. On
moving towards low pH (from 8 to 6), the enzyme starts
to gradually loose its activity and under these conditions
there is a gradual appearance of FRET, suggesting an
inwards movement of tryptophan moiety thus bringing
it close to PLP in space. In contrast, on moving towards
basic pH i.e. from 8 towards 10, a shift of tryptophan
fluorescence emission maximum from 335 nm to 340
nm was observed, which shows an opening of native
conformation of enzyme with partial solvent exposure of
tryptophan residue(s). Such pH dependent changes in

Page 7 of 8

the active site dynamics suggest relaxation (open) and
compaction (close) of active site conformation. Such a
dynamic movement in the active site would interfere
with proper docking of substrates and responsible for
loss of enzymatic activity. Support to such a possibility
comes from the pH studies in presence of NaCl where
no relative movement of the two fluorophores with pH
change (as discussed in paper) was observed and under
these conditions no significant alteration in the enzymatic activity was observed over a wider pH range. Conformational changes observed in the present study have
not been reported earlier based on the comparison of
crystal structures of PSAT at pH 4.6 and pH 8.5[14]
because of the fact that protein crystal packing may
interfere with fine conformational changes observed in
the solution [24,25]. These differences in the active site
microenvironment between EhPSAT and BCIR PSAT
might probably be due to change in flexibility of the
loop region 199-202 which is located near the active
site. In this loop the Pro201 in BCIR PSAT is changed
to Ala195 in EhPSAT (shown in Fig. 1). Such a change
will definitely bring about differences in the flexibility of
the loop and subsequently modulate the packing of the
protein in the vicinity of active site. The studies presented in the paper clearly demonstrate that local
changes at active site microenvironment and not global
changes in the protein conformation are responsible for
the pH induced modulation of functional activity of
PSAT.
