Abstract
Background: A number of molecular marker technologies have allowed important advances in the understanding of
the genetics and evolution of Eucalyptus, a genus that includes over 700 species, some of which are used worldwide in
plantation forestry. Nevertheless, the average marker density achieved with current technologies remains at the level
of a few hundred markers per population. Furthermore, the transferability of markers produced with most existing
technology across species and pedigrees is usually very limited. High throughput, combined with wide genome
coverage and high transferability are necessary to increase the resolution, speed and utility of molecular marker
technology in eucalypts. We report the development of a high-density DArT genome profiling resource and
demonstrate its potential for genome-wide diversity analysis and linkage mapping in several species of Eucalyptus.
Findings: After testing several genome complexity reduction methods we identified the PstI/TaqI method as the most
effective for Eucalyptus and developed 18 genomic libraries from PstI/TaqI representations of 64 different Eucalyptus
species. A total of 23,808 cloned DNA fragments were screened and 13,300 (56%) were found to be polymorphic
among 284 individuals. After a redundancy analysis, 6,528 markers were selected for the operational array and these
were supplemented with 1,152 additional clones taken from a library made from the E. grandis tree whose genome has
been sequenced. Performance validation for diversity studies revealed 4,752 polymorphic markers among 174
individuals. Additionally, 5,013 markers showed segregation when screened using six inter-specific mapping pedigrees,
with an average of 2,211 polymorphic markers per pedigree and a minimum of 859 polymorphic markers that were
shared between any two pedigrees.
Conclusions: This operational DArT array will deliver 1,000-2,000 polymorphic markers for linkage mapping in most
eucalypt pedigrees and thus provide high genome coverage. This array will also provide a high-throughput platform
for population genetics and phylogenetics in Eucalyptus. The transferability of DArT across species and pedigrees is
particularly valuable for a large genus such as Eucalyptus and will facilitate the transfer of information between different
studies. Furthermore, the DArT marker array will provide a high-resolution link between phenotypes in populations and
the Eucalyptus reference genome, which will soon be completed.
Background
A number of molecular marker technologies have been
developed and used for species of Eucalyptus in the last
20 years [1]. Each of these technologies allowed important advances in the understanding of the multifaceted
genetics, evolution and breeding of this vast genus that

includes over 700 species, some of which are globally
important plantation forestry species [2]. Molecular
markers have been used to resolve phylogenetic issues
[3], describe the genetic structure of natural populations
[4,5], solve questions related to the management of
genetic variation in breeding populations [6] and build
linkage maps [7-9] that in turn have led to the identification of QTLs for important traits [10-13]. Nevertheless,
the genotyping density achieved even with technologies
such as AFLP [14] remains at a few hundred markers per

sample and because AFLP is gel-based it is relatively
labour-intensive. Multiplexing has allowed moderatelevel throughput in microsatellite studies. However, the
transferability of microsatellites across species is notoriously poor and needs to be investigated and optimized
before microsatellites can be used in a new species [1].
Wider genome coverage and higher throughput genotyping methods are necessary to increase resolution and
speed for a variety of applications. Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) [15] provides a promising alternative to
satisfy the requirements of throughput, genome coverage
and transferability. DArT is a complexity reduction, DNA
hybridization-based method that simultaneously assays
hundreds to thousands of markers across a genome.
DArT preferentially targets low-copy genomic regions,
allows automation of data acquisition and is cost competitive. Although developed some years ago, this marker
technology has recently gained increasing attention [1620]. We report the development of the first version of a
high density operational DArT genotyping microarray
with over 7,000 markers and demonstrate its potential for
diversity and linkage mapping studies in species of Eucalyptus across the two most important subgenera.

Results and Discussion
This paper describes the various steps that were taken in
developing the eucalypt DArT array (Figure 1). The first
step was to find a successful method for reducing genome
complexity. Once this was done, a prototype microarray
was developed and tested. The DArT array was subsequently expanded and again tested for redundancy. The

final step was to validate the operational microarray for
genome-wide genotyping in Eucalyptus.
Genome complexity reduction

The first necessary step in the development of DArT
markers (Figure 1) is choosing a genome complexity
reduction method (see http://www.diversityarrays.com/
molecularprincip.html). The DArT genome complexity
reduction method is based on restriction enzyme (RE)
digestion of total genomic DNA, adapter ligation and
amplification of adapter-ligated fragments. DNA extraction was done with a CTAB protocol [21]. Seven methods
of genome complexity reduction were tested for their
performance in Eucalyptus (Additional File 1). DNA samples were prepared by digestion with the rare cutting PstI
RE as a primary cutter in combination with a frequently
cutting enzyme (TaqI, BstNI, MspI, HpaII, BanII, MseI or
AluI) as a secondary cutter. PstI is sensitive to CpG methylation, thereby excluding heavily methylated repetitive
DNA from the representation. Adapters, complementary
to the "sticky-ends" of the fragments generated by PstI
digests were ligated (protocol modified slightly from the
original [15,16]), to allow PCR amplification of only the
PstI fragments that had not been cut with the secondary
enzyme. A desirable genome complexity reduction
method will produce a smear of products with few or no
distinct bands when representations are visualised on
agarose gels following electrophoresis. Strong banding
indicates the amplification of repetitive sequences and
such representations are unsuitable for DArT development [22]. The genomic representations produced by the
digestion with PstI in combination with either TaqI (PstI/

TaqI) or BstNI (PstI/BstNI) were considered the most
suitable for Eucalyptus to advance to the subsequent
development steps (Figure 1, Additional File 1).
Test screening of clones for polymorphic DArT markers

The second step (Figure 1) entailed the construction of
small genomic libraries for each of the selected complexity reduction methods and the screening of the resulting
DNA clones (probes) to reveal polymorphic markers. For
library construction, two sets of pooled DNA samples
were utilized separately: the first from 12 E. grandis and
the second from 12 E. globulus trees. Each pooled sample
was digested with both enzyme combinations: PstI/TaqI
and PstI/BstNI. Four testing libraries were generated,
each with 384 randomly picked clones, with a total of
1,536 DArT clones to be screened for polymorphism. The
cloned DNA fragments were printed onto glass slides for
the first test array in duplicates (randomly positioned
within the array) as is normally done for DArT. Genomic
representations of each of the 12 E. grandis and 12 E.
globulus individuals were prepared to generate 'targets'
that were hybridized to the arrays. For each species, the
12 genotypes were assayed with two technical replicates
per genotype. Each target was labeled with a green fluorescent dye (Cy3-dUTP) and red fluorescent dye (Cy5dUTP), and then mixed with a blue fluorescently-labeled
polylinker from the vector used for cloning the DNA
fragments in the libraries that provided a reference value
for the quantity of amplified DNA fragment present in
each 'spot' of the microarray, as well as an in-built quality
control for spots on the microarrays. This mixture was
hybridized to a 1,536-clone microarray, that was scanned
for blue, green & red fluorescence and data were
extracted using DArTSoft version 7.44. DArTSoft localizes the individual spot features of the microarrays and
then compares the relative intensity (blue versus green)
and (blue versus red) values obtained for each clone
across all slides/targets to detect the presence of clusters
of higher and lower values corresponding to marker
scores of '1' (high) and '0' (low) respectively. The quality
parameters used in this study were: Call Rate (percentage
of targets that could be scored as '0' or '1') and Reproducibility value (reproducibility of scoring between replicated target assays) [16]. The results of the DArTSoft
analysis for the two arrays prepared using DNA clones
derived from either PstI/TaqI or PstI/BstNI digestions
were compared with regard to the frequency of clones
revealing polymorphic DArT markers. The criteria used
for declaring a clone as revealing a polymorphic marker
were Reproducibility > 97% and Call Rate > 80%. From
the analysis of the two species hybridized in duplicate to
the two arrays, the complexity reduction method using
PstI/TaqI was found to yield a higher proportion (21.7%)

of candidate polymorphic markers according to the above
criteria compared to the PstI/BstNI method (14.3%).
Prototype Eucalyptus DArT microarray

The PstI/TaqI genome complexity reduction method was
used in the development of the prototype Eucalyptus
DArT microarray (Figure 1). The initial test array, with
1,536 clones, was expanded by picking an additional random set of 14,592 discovery DArT clones, this time
derived from a total of 14 libraries (Table 1). A broader
sample of genotypes (254 samples from seven eucalypt
species representing the two most important genera of
eucalypts [Corymbia and Eucalyptus] and the two most
important subgenera of Eucalyptus [Eucalyptus and Symphyomyrtus]) were used for library construction resulting
in a broader sample of DNA sequences, therefore increasing the probability of sampling genomic segments that
could reveal polymorphic markers across a wider range of
genetic backgrounds [16]. A total of 16,128 clones were
printed twice on each slide and were hybridized with
DNA from each of 284 individuals ("targets"; Table 2) representing eight different species with replication, following the methods described above. The results were
analyzed with DArTSoft and assessed using the threshold
criteria of Reproducibility > 97% and Call Rate > 80%.
This analysis revealed 7,677 clones (47.6%) as robust
polymorphic markers (Table 3). The Call Rate average
was 95.3% and the Reproducibility average was 99.7%
(this value was calculated on the basis of duplicate genotyping assays for all test samples).
Testing Corymbia targets on the array composed primarily of Eucalyptus probes (and vice versa) showed very
clearly that the overall array signal of Corymbia targets
was low and uncorrelated to signal from Eucalyptus species (and vice versa). Because of this poor transferability
across genera, we abandoned the development of DArT
for Corymbia. As clones used to build an array are picked
at random from the libraries, clone redundancy (i.e. DNA
fragments with the same or very similar/overlapping
sequence) is an issue. Redundancy of the polymorphic
DArT clones was evaluated with the software package
DArT ToolBox http://www.diversityarrays.com/ by constructing a Hamming distance matrix between clones,
followed by distance binning, in which all clones with
zero distance were placed into the same bin. This was
done using the 284 samples used as targets listed in Table
2. This estimation of clone redundancy based on similar
score pattern enabled the selection of unique or low
redundancy clones prior to the availability of sequence
information for the clones. The redundancy estimation
based on distance binning of the 7,677 polymorphic
markers resulted in 2,652 unique bins, i.e. 34.5% nonredundant marker scoring patterns (Table 4). With a limited number of effective scores for calculating the dis-

tance matrix for markers and a clear genetic structure in
the materials used for initial marker discovery, there was
a high likelihood of unique sequences being grouped to a
single bin, especially in large bins. Therefore, a total of
4,608 clones were selected for re-arraying, keeping
approximately 30% of the potentially redundant markers,
with frequency of retention proportional to the bin size.
In order to verify the redundancy estimation, we
sequenced re-arrayed clones that belonged to nine bins
that had at least 30 clones. Sequencing results revealed
that on average 53% of the DArT clones in these large
bins represented unique DNA sequences. Binning results

were therefore, as anticipated, conservative and yielded
an overestimation of redundancy (Table 5).
Interim and operational Eucalyptus DArT microarrays

In order to enrich the Eucalyptus DArT array for polymorphic markers, four additional genomic libraries were
constructed that provided a total of 7,680 new clones that
were screened for polymorphism (Table 6). Two of these
libraries contained DNA from 62 eucalypt species and
were built by pooling equimolar DNA quantities from
one individual of each species and cutting either with PstI
or PstI/TaqI. The PstI representation allowed markers
that were present at low frequency in the PstI/TaqI representation to be cloned and therefore minimized redundancy in the final clone set. Most species (56) were from
subgenus Symphyomyrtus (representing 14 of the 15 sections and missing only a minor one); the other species
were from three other subgenera (Alveolata, Eucalyptus,
and Minutifructus). Screening these new libraries for
polymorphism (Figure 1) was performed using a set of
190 individuals from seven different Eucalyptus species
(E. grandis, E. urophylla, E. camaldulensis, E. globulus, E.
dunni, E. pilularis and E. nitens) with targets in full replication (Table 7). DArTSoft and DArT ToolBox were used
to identify robust markers and to estimate redundancy as
described for the first array (with the same parameters
and thresholds). DArTSoft detected 5,653 polymorphic
markers among the 7,680 clones (73.6%). The average
Call Rate and Reproducibility were similar to the first
array with 93.7% and 99.7% respectively. However, a sig-

nificantly higher percentage of polymorphic markers
(73.6% versus 47.6%) was found in the array expansion
stage (Table 3), most likely due to the greater genetic
diversity that was captured in the genomic representations from the four new libraries. A consolidated analysis
of redundancy based on binning was carried out to minimize redundancy between the 7,677 polymorphic clones
selected initially for the prototype microarray and the
additional 5,653 clones. From a total of 13,300 clones,
4,051 bins were found in the interim array (Tables 3 and
4). On the basis of polymorphism analysis and the additional redundancy assessment, 1,920 new clones were
selected from the 7,680, to create a second re-arrayed
library. The two re-arrayed libraries (the first one with
4,608 clones and the second with 1,920 clones), were supplemented with 1,152 clones developed primarily from a
genomic library of BRASUZ1, the Eucalyptus grandis tree
whose genome is being sequenced (Table 6), to constitute
an operational DArT genotyping array for Eucalyptus
with 7,680 markers.

als were a subset of those used to create the libraries. This
analysis revealed 4,752 polymorphic markers out of the
7,680 clones (61.9%) among the 174 individuals. As
expected, not all the 7,680 clones were found to yield
polymorphic markers since the 174 samples assayed did
not represent the total genetic diversity used to construct
the array.
As a second validation, an assessment of DArT marker
segregation and rate of polymorphism was carried-out
with 94 samples in full replication, including 15-16 samples from each of six mapping pedigrees. Most of these
individuals were not used in library construction and represented a test of the level of polymorphism that could be
expected in diverse linkage mapping experiments. There
were 2,211 polymorphic markers per pedigree on average
(Table 8). The number of shared polymorphic markers
(polymorphic in two pedigrees) amongst the six mapping
pedigrees varied from a minimum of 859 to a maximum
of 1,328 (Table 8). A total of 5,013 markers (65.3%) out of
the 7,680 clones showed segregation within at least one
mapping population, when data from the six pedigrees
were consolidated (Table 9). Table 9 shows the number of
DArT markers that were exclusively polymorphic in one
pedigree only (1,154 markers or 23%) through to those
that were polymorphic in an increasing number of pedigrees up to all six pedigrees (150 markers: 3%).

Validation of DArT array for diversity and linkage mapping

The performance of the operational DArT array for
diversity studies was first validated by genotyping 174
individuals from six of the Eucalyptus species used to create the libraries (E. grandis, E. urophylla, E. dunni, E.
camaldulensis, E. globulus and E. nitens). These individu-

Conclusions
This eucalypt DArT array is one of the best performing
DArT arrays yet developed (DArT Pty Ltd, unpublished
results). The high frequency of polymorphic markers is
likely to be a function of the high level of sequence variation in the Eucalyptus genome [23] and, to a much lesser
extent, a function of its relatively small genome size and
low proportion of repetitive DNA [1]. Interestingly, the
high level of sequence diversity in Eucalyptus species [23]

could be a serious impediment to the development of
highly multiplexed SNP platforms that usually require
reasonably long stretches of sequence without secondary
SNPs. It may prove challenging to find good targets for
SNP assay design which would be invariable across a
range of Eucalyptus species. In this context, DArT analysis is not constrained by high sequence polymorphism
and is therefore very suitable for genotyping thousands of

genetic markers in highly outbred organisms such as
Eucalyptus.
DArT generated a substantially larger number of robust
polymorphic markers for Eucalyptus species than previous technologies. Although co-dominant microsatellites
are significantly more informative at the single locus level
they are low-throughput and expensive per data-point.
Comparing DArT with RAPD or AFLP analysis would be
more appropriate as they are all dominant markers. The
complicating issue, however, is the ascertainment bias
that takes place when selecting RAPD primers, AFLP
primer/enzyme combinations or DArT polymorphic
probes. This bias is exacerbated by the specific target
population that is used when selecting polymorphisms
and by the rigor of the experimenter in declaring these
polymorphisms. It is important to note that the DArT
array developed in this study provides at least two orders
of magnitude more polymorphic markers in a single assay
than RAPD or AFLP analysis. In Eucalyptus, while a

selected RAPD primer can provide up to 10 robust polymorphic bands in a single gel run and a selected AFLP
combination can provide on average 30 to 40 polymorphic markers, a single DArT assay provides 1,000 to 4,000
polymorphic markers from the7,680 probes present on
the current array. In addition, the standard probe set
selected for routine DArT genotyping allows comparisons of markers across a range of species and populations
while both AFLP and RAPD markers are much less amenable to integration across laboratories and even less so
across different species.
The high level of DArT marker multiplexing was validated in a large collection of eucalypt species and individuals. The results indicated that the DArT genotyping
array will deliver thousands of polymorphic markers for
population diversity studies and provide a very efficient
platform with which to generate high-density linkage
maps with a substantial proportion of markers shared
across pedigrees. This array will be especially useful for
applications that benefit from access to a large number of
markers. The cost per data point (per sample per marker)
will of course depend on the application and the facility
generating the data. Using the fully costed service provided by the technology development partner, DArT Pty
Ltd, the cost per data point for polymorphic markers is
expected to vary between one and five cents US (assuming an assay cost per sample of 50 USD, not counting
shipping and DNA extraction costs). In linkage mapping
studies, an application where one of the lowest degrees of
polymorphism is expected because diversity comes
essentially from only two parents, we expect that a minimum of 1,000 polymorphic markers could be mapped at a
cost of approximately five cents US per polymorphic
marker. The per sample cost is much cheaper than current SNP genotyping platforms assaying an equivalent
number of markers (e.g. Illumina GoldenGate). The inhouse use of DArT arrays would involve purchasing the
equipment necessary to spot high density arrays, hybrid-

ization chambers and a multi color scanner and therefore
would require a very high throughput operation to make
such investment worthwhile.
Another significant advantage of the DArT markers is
their transferability across species, which is particularly
valuable when dealing with a genus like Eucalyptus with
over 700 species, of which many are foundation species in
their forest ecosystems, and several are commercially
useful in either temperate or sub-tropical regions of the
world. This transferability will allow the detailed comparison of linkage maps and QTL positions across studies.
However, this transferability appears to have limits as we
obtained poor transferability across eucalypt genera
(Corymbia to Eucalyptus). We will address the phylogenetic consequences of this finding and the performance
of the DArT array across the full range of Eucalyptus species in a related study (Steane et al. submitted).
A limitation of the DArT technology compared to multi
allelic microsatellites is their dominant inheritance,
which precludes studying aspects of within-individual
variation, although methodologies are being developed
that can mitigate this [24]. Dominant markers are also
less informative for constructing linkage maps, unless a
large number of them are available and population sizes
are large, in which case they can be as useful as co-dominant markers. Finally, clustering of DArT markers across
the genome could potentially be an issue due to the
reduced representation method by which that DArT
probes are developed. However, this is not exclusive to
the DArT technology and an assessment of this will only
be possible by linkage mapping DArT markers in multiple pedigrees and/or physically mapping them on the
upcoming Eucalyptus reference genome.
To better characterize the genomic content of this
array, all 7,680 DNA clones on the operational DArT
array are being sequenced. The availability of DNA
sequences for the DArT markers will facilitate the integration of high-density maps and QTL locations with the
Eucalyptus genome assembly. The operational DArT

array constitutes a powerful tool with which to undertake
high resolution genetic analyses required for applications
such as fine QTL mapping, genome-wide selection and
complex phylogenetic and evolutionary investigations.
Moreover, the flexibility and expandability of the DArT
technology opens the possibility of further enriching the
current array with additional polymorphic markers by
simply screening additional sets of clones. A number of
mapping (Grattapaglia et al. in prep; Kullan et al. in prep),
population and phylogenetic (Steane et al. submitted)
studies currently underway with DArT in several Eucalyptus species are corroborating the excellent performance of this technology and will be the subject of
upcoming reports.

Methods
For the development of the Eucalyptus DArT microarray,
DNA samples from many different species and provenances were used both in the prototype and technology
development steps (Tables 1, 2, 6 and 7). DNA was
extracted from either fresh leaf tissue or bark cambium in
three different laboratories (Australia, South Africa, Brazil) all using a CTAB protocol [21]. DNA quality was
checked on agarose gels with DNA digested with the
restriction enzyme HindIII together with undigested
DNA to check that (1) undigested DNA formed a tight
band of high molecular weight without RNA contamination; (2) fully-digested DNA formed a smear of mid- to
low molecular weight. DNA concentration was adjusted
to 50-100 ng/μL, targeting a concentration of 75 ng/μL.
Methods of genome complexity reduction to generate
genomic representations

Digestion and adapter ligation were performed simultaneously on 75 ng of genomic DNA in a 10 μL aqueous
solution containing 2 Units of each restriction enzyme,
80 Units of T4 DNA Ligase and 0.05 μM adapter (5'-CAC
GAT GGA TCC AGT GCA-3' annealed with 5'-CTG
GAT CCA TCG TGC A-3'). Reactions were incubated at

Sansaloni et al. Plant Methods 2010, 6:16
http://www.plantmethods.com/content/6/1/16

37°C for 2 hours, followed by 2 hours at 60°C as required
by the enzyme combinations. 1 μL of digestion/ligation
reaction product was used as a template for PCR amplification in a 50 μL reaction using DArT PstI primer (5'GAT GGA TCC AGT GCA G-3') with the following
cycling parameters: 94°C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles
of 94°C for 20 sec, 58°C for 40 sec, 72°C for 1 min, and
finished with an extension at 72°C for 7 min. Initial
assessment of the tested methods was performed by
resolving 5 μL of amplification product in a 1.2% agarose
gel stained with ethidium bromide.
Construction of small clone DArT libraries

The genomic representations of each species/complexity
reduction method combination were pooled and cloned
using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) as specified
by the manufacturer's instructions. Individual bacterial
colonies were picked into 384-well plates containing LB
medium with 4.4% glycerol, 100 μg/mL ampicillin and a
mixture of salts to facilitate PCR from the LB cultures
(unpublished observation) and grown at 37° for 18 hours.
A PCR amplification was performed using 0.5 μL of bacterial culture template, 0.2 μM "M13 Forward" and "M13
Reverse" primers (Invitrogen), and the following PCR
program: 95° for 4 min, 57° for 35 sec, 72° for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94° for 35 sec, 52° for 35 sec and 72°
for 1 min and a final step of 72° for 7 min. The PCR products were dried at 37°C and washed with 70% ethanol
before being dissolved in "DArTspotter" spotting buffer,
designed for use with poly-L-lysine coated micro-array
slides (Wenzl et. al. in preparation, available from DArT
Pty Ltd). Arrays were spotted using a MicrogridII arrayer
(Biorobotics) on poly-L-lysine coated glass microarray
slides (Erie Scientific). Slides were aged on the bench for
24 hours before being immersed in Milli-Q water at 95°C
for 2 min, to denature the DNA spotted onto the slides,
then in Milli-Q water with 0.1 mM DTT and 0.1 mM
EDTA at 20°C, and finally being dried by centrifugation at
500 × g for 7 min and vacuum desiccation for 30 min.
Fluorescent labeling of genomic representations

Genomic representations of the 12 samples of E. grandis
and E. globulus were prepared as described above for
library construction, to generate 'targets' for hybridizing
to the arrays. The products of amplification were precipitated individually with isopropanol, washed with 70%
ethanol and air dried at room temperature for 12 hours.
For each species the 12 genotypes were assayed with two
replicates per genotype. Targets were labeled in a 10 μL
reaction volume with 2.5 nM of Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP
(Amersham Bioscience), 2.5 units of Klenow exo- fragment of E. coli Polymerase I (New England Biolabs) and
25 μM random decamers in 1 × NEB Buffer 2 (New England Biolabs). The labelling reactions were incubated at
37°C for 3 hours.

Test hybridization to microarrays

The labeled targets were mixed with a hybridisation buffer containing a 50:5:1 mixture of Express Hyb
(Clonetech), herring sperm DNA (Promega) and FAMlabeled polylinker region of the pCR 2.1 TOPO vector
(Invitrogen) used for cloning the libraries, plus 2 mM
EDTA at pH 8.0. The target mixtures were denatured at
95°C for 2 min before hybridization to the microarrays,
which was carried out at 62.5°C for 18 hours. After
hybridization, the microarray slides were washed in four
solutions of increasing stringency (1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for
4 min; 1 × SSC for 4 min; 0.2 × SSC for 1 min; 0.02 × SSC
for 30 sec) and dried by centrifugation at 500 × g for 7
min and vacuum desiccation for 30 min.
Microarray imaging and data extraction

Microarrays were scanned using a TECAN LS300 confocal laser microarray scanner at a resolution of 20 μm per
pixel with sequential acquisition of 3 images for each
microarray slide, using the following laser/emission-filter
combinations: 488 nm laser/520 nm filter (for imaging
the fluorescent signal from the FAM-labeled polylinker
region of the pCR 2.1 TOPO vector); 543 nm laser/590
nm filter (for imaging the fluorescent signal from the
hybridized target labeled with Cy-3); 633 nm laser/670
nm filter (for imaging the fluorescent signal from the
hybridized target labeled with Cy-5). The use of a third
fluorescent dye is not absolutely required and DArT
assays can be performed on any two-color scanner as
reported in early DArT papers. However, the third dye
provides significantly higher sample throughput together
with lower assay cost because two samples can be processed on a single array instead of just one as is the case
when using a two-color scanner. The signal from the
FAM-labeled vector polylinker provided a reference value
for quantity of amplified DNA fragment present in each
'spot' of the microarray. The resulting images were analyzed using DArTSoft version 7.44, a program created by
Diversity Arrays Technology Pty Ltd for microarray image
data extraction, polymorphism detection, and marker
scoring (Cayla et al. in preparation). DArTsoft localized
the individual spot features of the microarrays from the
16 bit TIFF images generated by the laser scanner and
spots with insufficient or absent reference signals were
rejected from further analysis. A relative hybridisation
intensity value was then calculated for all accepted spots
as log [Cy-3 signal/FAM signal] for the targets labelled
with Cy-3, and log [Cy-5 signal/FAM signal] for targets
labelled with Cy-5. DArTSoft then compared the relative
intensity values obtained for each clone across all slides/
targets to detect the presence of clusters of higher and
lower values corresponding to marker scores of '1' and '0'
respectively. Targets with relative intensity values that
could not be assigned to either of the clusters were
recorded as unscored. For each clone, the software gener-

Sansaloni et al. Plant Methods 2010, 6:16

ated a range of quality parameters to assist in selection of
polymorphic clones. The quality parameters used in this
study were: Call Rate (percentage of targets that could be
scored as '0' or '1') and a Reproducibility value (reproducibility of scoring between replicated target assays). Two
replicates per clone were spotted on each array. The
operational array has 15,360 spots in total, comprising
two randomly positioned spots for each one of the 7,680
clones. The DArT array is available to the public through
Diversity Arrays Technology Pty Ltd http://www.diversityarrays.com/.
