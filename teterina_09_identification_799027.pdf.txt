Abstract
Rodent betaherpesviruses vary considerably in genomic content, and these variations can result in
a distinct pathogenicity. Therefore, the identification of unknown betaherpesviruses in house mice
(Mus musculus), the most important rodent host species in basic research, is of importance. During
a search for novel herpesviruses in house mice using herpesvirus consensus PCR and attempts to
isolate viruses in tissue culture, we identified a previously unknown betaherpesvirus. The primary
PCR search in mouse organs revealed the presence of known strains of murine cytomegalovirus
(Murid herpesvirus 1) and of Mus musculus rhadinovirus 1 only. However, the novel virus was
detected after incubation of organ pieces in fibroblast tissue culture and subsequent PCR analysis
of the supernatants. Long-distance PCR amplification including the DNA polymerase and
glycoprotein B genes revealed a 3.4 kb sequence that was similar to sequences of rodent
cytomegaloviruses. Pairwise sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses showed that this
newly identified murine virus is most similar to the English isolate of rat cytomegalovirus, thereby
raising the possibility that two distinct CMV lineages have evolved in both Mus musculus and Rattus
norvegicus.

Findings
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the Betaherpesvirinae, can cause severe infections in immunocompromised
hosts. Because of their inherent species-specificity, CMVs
are used in rodent infection models to study human CMV
(HCMV) pathogenesis. These models include, e.g., the
house mouse (Mus musculus) and the rat (Rattus norvegicus) with their host-specific viruses (mouse and rat CMV;
MCMV and RCMV, respectively). CMVs have evolved with
their hosts for a long period of time, and this coexistence
has shaped their genetic content. In addition, frequent
serial passaging of the commonly used MCMV laboratory
strains Smith and K181 has resulted in even further varia-

tions of viral genes and the emergence of new genotypes
[1-4]. This genetic variation, including the loss of numerous genes, has been also reported for clinical isolates of
HCMV [5,6].
To determine the impact that the presence of modified or
completely different genes on CMV biology might imply,
we sought to detect novel betaherpesviruses. To do so, we
employed consensus PCR with degenerate primers that
had previously proven useful in identifying a hitherto
unknown gammaherpesvirus, the first reported rhadinovirus in Mus musculus [7]. Spleens, lungs, inguinal lymph
nodes and salivary glands were obtained from two or

three individuals of four strains of house mice. Each organ
sample was divided into two pieces, one for DNA extraction followed by an initial PCR analysis with degenerate
consensus primers and one for virus isolation in fibroblast
tissue culture. The organ samples were minced and co-cultivated on monolayers of murine 3T3 and 10.1 cells, as
well as on L929 and BHK21 cells. About two weeks later,
supernatants were taken, DNA was extracted, and another
PCR analysis was performed using the same primers as in
the initial analysis. DNA of organs and tissue supernatants
was extracted using the QiAamp tissue kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Panherpes consensus-PCR for amplification of a 160 bp 181 bp fragment (without primer-binding sites) of the
DPOL gene [8] was carried out with five degenerate/deoxyinosine-substituted (deg/dI) nested-primers as described
previously [9] (Figure 1).
Direct consensus PCR analysis of 44 organ samples collected from eleven mice of four house mouse strains
revealed the presence of several variants of MCMV in two
mouse strains and of the previously described Mus musculus rhadinovirus 1 (MmusRHV-1 [7]) in one strain. Subsequent PCR analysis of tissue culture supernatants of
MCMV-positive organs confirmed known MCMV in all
cases. The tissue culture supernatants of MmusRHV-1positive organs, however, did not contain the expected
sequences, indicating that MmusRHV-1 failed to grow in
cell culture. Instead, we detected a DPOL sequence of an
unknown betaherpesvirus in the supernatant of L929 cells
that had been co-cultivated with the MmusRHV-1-positive lung (specimen #5479) of one mouse (Figure 2a).

triangles, respectively. Amplified sequences are shown as

To amplify glycoprotein B (gB) gene sequences of that
virus, the deg/dI nested-primer set CMV-gB-1 was used
(Figure 1a). With this set, gB gene sequences of several
members of the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily had previously been amplified, resulting in a second-round amplification product of approximately 225 bp (without
primer-binding sites) [7]. PCR products were obtained
from the L929 tissue culture supernatants, and sequencing revealed a gB sequence of an unknown betaherpesvirus.
To prove that the gB and the DPOL sequence originated
from the same virus, we connected them with Long-distance (LD) PCR using the TaKaRa-Ex PCR system (Takara
Bio inc., Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. An amplification product of approximately
3,3 kb size was obtained and sequenced by primer walking. A contiguous sequence of 3431 bp was obtained (in
combination with the initial gB and DPOL sequences),
spanning 1101 bp of the 3'-part of the gB gene and 2313
bp of the 5'-part of the DPOL gene (Figure 1a). Since a
cytomegalovirus of the house mouse is already known
(MCMV = MuHV-1), the virus from which the novel
sequence originated was tentatively named Mus musculus
cytomegalovirus 2 (MmusCMV-2).
Rowe and Capps [10] discovered a mouse virus which
causes thymic necrosis in newborn mice, however, it
could not be propagated in cell culture. This virus was
named mouse thymic virus (MTV) and classified as Murid
herpesvirus 3 (MuHV-3). No sequences of MuHV3 are
available in public databases. Seroepidemiological studies
have shown that MuHV-3 (like MCMV) is ubiquitously
present in free-living European house mice [11]. To rule
out that MmusCMV-2 might in fact be MuHV-3, we compared it with a recently amplified partial DPOL sequence
of MuHV-3 (R. S. Livingston, University of MissouriColumbia, USA; personal communication). This 450 bp
betaherpesvirus-like sequence of MuHV-3 was only distantly related to the corresponding DPOL sequence of
MmusCMV-2 (and those of MCMV, RCMV-E and RCMVM) (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that
MmusCMV-2 and MuHV-3 are different viruses.
From the DPOL sequence, we deduced primers specific for
MmusCMV-2 (MmusCMV2-fwd: 5' CGGCATGCTCCCTTGTCTTC-3'; MmusCMV2-rev: 5'TTGATGCGAAGGACTTCGGT-3'). The expected amplification product had a size
of 168 bp. With an annealing temperature of 60°C, all 44
organ samples were retested, using the MmusCMV-2-positive supernatant as a control. As expected, the cell culture
supernatant tested positive for MmusCMV-2 as did lung,
spleen, salivary gland and lymph node of that mouse
from which the positive supernatant originated. In contrast, the organs of all other mice were negative for

isolate (RCMV-E; [GenBank: GU018179]) and HCMV

MmusCMV2, pairwise identity percentages were 57.6%,
56.2%, 65.9% and 46.9%, respectively (Table 1). Therefore, we conclude that RCMV-E might be the closest relative of MmusCMV-2.

To determine the evolutionary position of MmusCMV-2,
the 3421 bp sequence [GenBank: GU017485] was pairwise compared with the corresponding DPOL and gB
sequences of MCMV (Murid herpesvirus 1; [GenBank:

Our findings revealed that Mus musculus - like Rattus norvegicus - harbours two distinct CMV (MCMV and
MmusCMV-2). The results of the pairwise sequence comparisons and the NA-based phylogenetic analysis showed
that this newly identified murine virus MmusCMV-2 is
most similar to RCMV-E. This raises the possibility that
two distinct CMV lineages in both Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus have evolved. At this point, however, we tentatively state that MmusCMV-2 represents a distinct CMV,
as has been reported for RCMV-E and RCMV-M [15,16].
As soon as the virus has been cultured to sufficiently high
titres, the complete MmusCMV-2 sequence derived from
purified virus DNA may confirm its distinctiveness.
Further analysis of the molecular biology of MmusCMV-2
and the study of its behaviour in vivo might reveal significant differences to MCMV and the two rat CMVs and
broaden our understanding of cytomegalovirus biology.
