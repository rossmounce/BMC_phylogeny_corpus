Background
Cellulose is an important biopolymer produced by all
plants and is used in a number of different industries,
including for pulp and paper production. Cellulose is
deposited into the plant cell wall by a large membranebound protein complex, which is composed of different
cellulose synthase (CESA) proteins. The cellulose content and pattern of deposition in plant cell walls is
highly variable depending on the function of the cell. All
plant cells have a thin primary cell wall, but a number
of plant cell types, including xylem cells, also deposit a
secondary cell wall to give these tissues mechanical
strength required to perform their function. Different
cellulose synthase (CesA) genes have been shown to be
involved in the deposition of primary and secondary
walls. In Arabidopsis, three CesA (AtCesA4, 7 and 8)
genes have consistently been associated with cells depositing secondary cell walls, while a different set of CesA
genes have been shown to function during primary cell
wall formation [Reviewed in 1]. These findings have
been mirrored by studies of CesA gene orthologs in
Populus and Eucalyptus[2-4]. While there have been a
number of studies on CesA genes and their functions,
much less is known about the regulation of these genes.
In a previous study, we investigated the promoters of
CesA genes involved in primary and secondary cell wall
formation by performing a phylogenetic footprinting
analysis to identify cis-elements conserved in the promoters from orthologous Arabidopsis, Populus and
Eucalyptus cellulose synthase genes [5]. We identified a

number of putative cis-regulatory elements that may
play a role in the regulation of cellulose biosynthesis
during primary and secondary cell wall formation. In
the current study our aim is to further validate the ciselements identified in the CesA gene promoters by
investigating their conservation across different Eucalyptus species and to determine the regulatory function of
these promoter regions and the proteins which bind to
them.

Methods
A number of different methods are being employed to
investigate the regulatory functions associated with the
EucalyptusCesA promoters. Firstly, to validate the ciselements previously identified, we cloned and sequenced
the promoters of six CesA genes from 13 different Eucalyptus species. The promoter sequences were analysed
on the nucleotide diversity level. The cis-elements identified in the previous study were mapped onto the
cloned promoter sequences and analysed for conservation in sequence and position. Next, we studied the possible roles of promoter regions harbouring conserved
cis-elements in spatio-temporal regulation of CesA
genes. We tested regions of the EucalyptusgrandisCesA1
(EgCesA1) promoter for involvement in spatio-temporal
regulation by cloning the full-length (2 kb) promoter
and a series of truncates thereof upstream of the b-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. These constructs were
used to transform Arabidopsis (floral dipping) and Eucalyptus (Induced Somatic Sector Analysis, [6]). The GUS
expression patterns were compared to the pattern produced by the 2 kb EgCesA1 promoter. Finally, promoter
regions identified as functionally active and harbouring
conserved elements of interest are being used to screen

a Eucalyptus immature xylem cDNA expression library
for yeast-1-hybrid interactions to identify proteins which
interact with these regions.

Results and discussion
Studying the diversity of CesA promoter sequences and
cis-elements in 13 Eucalyptus species provided us with
valuable insight into the relative conservation of specific
promoters regions and the cis-elements within these
regions. We found that the overall nucleotide diversity
of the promoter sets varied greatly from promoter to
promoter, but we could identify regions in the promoters that were as conserved as coding regions. We found
that in many cases these localized decreases in nucleotide diversity corresponded to clusters of conserved ciselements which were identified previously [5]. This was
particularly noticeable at the transcriptional start site for
most genes and in this region we noticed a repeat element in all of the promoters investigated. Some elements were also shown to be specific to either the
primary or secondary cell wall associated promoters.
The cis-element information obtained from this study
was used to create seven truncates of the EgCesA1 promoter. Using GUS expression analysis in Arabidopsis we
identified a number of repression and activation sites
within the promoter. We also observed a loss of leaf
(vein) expression 800 bp upstream. One of the repeat
elements fused to the 5’UTR greatly enhanced overall
GUS expression in a non-specific way. In a Eucalyptus
background (ISSA), six of the seven truncates showed
xylem-specific expression, but the 5’UTR and repeat element fusion showed GUS expression in phloem and
xylem. These regions have been used to construct bait
vectors for Yeast-1-hybrid screening which is still
ongoing.
Conclusion
In this study we addressed three main objectives, (1)
investigate the evolution of the EucalyptusCesA promoters and cis-elements associated with primary and secondary cell wall formation, (2) investigate the expression
patterns of truncated versions of the EgCesA1 promoter
using the GUS reporter system and (3) test the EgCesA1
promoter regions affecting gene expression in a yeast1-hybrid assay to identify possible regulators of this
gene. We have identified regions in the promoter that
were conserved and corresponded to previously identified cis-elements. Using this information we produced
seven promoter truncates and discovered several regions
and cis-elements in the EgCesA1 promoter which affect
GUS expression patterns. These results will aid
in understanding and elucidating transcriptional networks regulating xylogenesis in woody genera such as
Eucalyptus.
