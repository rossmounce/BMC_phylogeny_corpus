Abstract
Background: Systematic research on fish immunogenetics is indispensable in understanding the origin and
evolution of immune systems. This has long been a challenging task because of the limited number of deep
sequencing technologies and genome backgrounds of non-model fish available. The newly developed Solexa/
Illumina RNA-seq and Digital gene expression (DGE) are high-throughput sequencing approaches and are powerful
tools for genomic studies at the transcriptome level. This study reports the transcriptome profiling analysis of
bacteria-challenged Lateolabrax japonicus using RNA-seq and DGE in an attempt to gain insights into the
immunogenetics of marine fish.
Results: RNA-seq analysis generated 169,950 non-redundant consensus sequences, among which 48,987 functional
transcripts with complete or various length encoding regions were identified. More than 52% of these transcripts
are possibly involved in approximately 219 known metabolic or signalling pathways, while 2,673 transcripts were
associated with immune-relevant genes. In addition, approximately 8% of the transcripts appeared to be fishspecific genes that have never been described before. DGE analysis revealed that the host transcriptome profile of
Vibrio harveyi-challenged L. japonicus is considerably altered, as indicated by the significant up- or down-regulation
of 1,224 strong infection-responsive transcripts. Results indicated an overall conservation of the components and
transcriptome alterations underlying innate and adaptive immunity in fish and other vertebrate models. Analysis
suggested the acquisition of numerous fish-specific immune system components during early vertebrate evolution.
Conclusion: This study provided a global survey of host defence gene activities against bacterial challenge in a
non-model marine fish. Results can contribute to the in-depth study of candidate genes in marine fish immunity,
and help improve current understanding of host-pathogen interactions and evolutionary history of
immunogenetics from fish to mammals.

Background
Since it is a representative population of lower vertebrates serving as an essential link to early vertebrate
evolution, fish is believed to be an important model in
various developmental and comparative evolutionary
studies [1-3]. Fish immunogenetics has received considerable attention due to its essential role in understanding the origin and evolution of immune systems [4-6].

Further, it is also beneficial in the creation of immunebased therapy of severe fish diseases. Great progress in
bioinformatics and genome projects in model organisms,
including human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), frog (Xenopus laevis), chicken (Gallus gallus), and
zebrafish (Danio rerio), has led to the emergence of studies focusing on the identification and characterization
of immune-related genes in teleost fish based on comparative genomics. These have provided preliminary
observations on fish immunogenetics and evolutionary
history of immune systems from lower vertebrates to
mammals [7,8]. However, large-scale identification of

immune-related genes at the genome or transcriptome
levels in fish was seen in limited species (e.g. Danio
rerio) due to the inadequate number of high-throughput
deep sequencing technologies available [9,10]. This is an
even more difficult problem in non-model fish species
with totally unknown genome sequences.
Recently developed RNA deep sequencing technologies, such as Solexa/Illumina RNA-seq and Digital gene
expression (DGE), have dramatically changed the way
immune-related genes in fish are identified because
these technologies facilitate the investigation of the
functional complexity of transcriptomes [11,12]. RNASeq refers to whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing
wherein mRNA or cDNA is mechanically fragmented,
resulting in overlapping short fragments that cover the
entire transcriptome. DGE is a tag-based transcriptome
sequencing approach where short raw tags are generated
by endonuclease. The expression level of virtually all
genes in the sample is measured by counting the number of individual mRNA molecules produced from each
gene. Compared with DGE analysis, the RNA-Seq
approach is more powerful for unraveling transcriptome
complexity, and for identification of genes, structure of
transcripts, alternative splicing, non-coding RNAs, and
new transcription units. In contrast, the DGE protocol
is more suitable and affordable for comparative gene
expression studies because it enables direct transcript
profiling without compromise and potential bias, thus
allowing for a more sensitive and accurate profiling of
the transcriptome that more closely resembles the biology of the cell [9,13-17]. These two technologies have
been used in transcriptome profiling studies for various
applications, including cellular development, cancer, and
immune defence of various organisms [10,18-29]. However, they have not been used in immunogenetic analysis of marine fish species.
Japanese sea bass (Lateolabrax japonicus) is an economically important marine species widely cultured in
fisheries worldwide. Various diseases caused by bacterial
and viral pathogens plague this species [30]. High mortality is associated with infection with Vibrio harveyi, a typical gram-negative pathogen of a wide range of marine
animals. Infection results in a variety of vibriosis, a common aquatic animal disease associated with high mortality throughout the world [31]. In L. japonicus, V. harveyi
infection leads to bacterial septicaemia with muscle ulcer
as well as subcutaneous and gastroenteritic haemorrhage.
The present study is the first to conduct a transcriptome profiling analysis of V. harveyi-challenged L. japonicus using RNA-seq and DGE to gain deep insight into
the immunogenetics of marine fish. Bacteria-challenged
L. japonicus is expected to be a model system for studying bacterial immunity in marine fish. Further, a global
survey of anti-bacterial immune defence gene activities

in marine fish can contribute to the in-depth investigation of candidate genes in fish immunity. Results are
also expected to improve current understanding of
host-pathogen interactions and evolutionary history of
immunogenetics from fish to mammals.

Results
Aligning raw sequencing reads to non-redundant
consensus

Approximately 34.59 and 33.03 million 75-bp pair end
(PE) raw reads (submitted to GEO database, Association
No. GSE21721) from the head kidney and spleen tissues
of bacteria- and mock-challenged fish, respectively, were
generated using Solexa/Illumina RNA-seq deep sequencing analysis. Repetitive, low-complexity, and low-quality
reads were filtered out prior to assembly of sequence
reads for non-redundant consensus. Using Grape software, reliable reads were assembled into contigs, which
were then compared with all PE reads. Overlap of PE
reads with two contigs was taken to indicate that the
contigs are short segments of a scaffold. Reads were
used for gap-filling of these scaffolds to generate final
scaffold sequences. Using tgicl and cap3 software programs, scaffold sequences were assembled into clusters
that were then analysed for consensus. A total of
150,125 and 140,330 non-redundant consensus
sequences, ranging from 100 to 2,000-bp, were generated from each group. Then, consensus sequences were
merged for DGE analysis. Removal of partial overlapping
sequences yielded 169,950 non-redundant consensus
sequences (Table 1). These sequences provide abundant
data on healthy and infected conditions, thus allowing
for better reference of immune-relevant genes.

48,987 have reliable coding sequences (CDs) [32,33].
CD-containing consensus sequences have high potential
for translation into functional proteins and most of
them translated to proteins with more than 100 aa.
Comparison with the Nr and Swissprot databases
revealed that 44,842 consensus sequences had good
comparability with known gene sequences in existing
species. Annotation of the 44,842 sequences using GO
and COG databases yielded good results for approximately 16,469 consensus sequences and 9,545 putative
proteins [34,35]. GO-annotated consensus sequences
belonged to the biological process, cellular component,
and molecular function clusters and distributed among
more than 50 categories (Figure 1), including biochemistry, metabolism, growth, development, apoptosis, and
immune defence. Similarly, COG-annotated putative
proteins were classified functionally into at least 25
molecular families, including cellular structure, biochemistry metabolism, molecular processing, signal
transduction, gene expression, and immune defence,
that correspond to the categories observed in GO analysis (Figure 2). The KEGG database was used to analyse
potential involvement of the consensus sequences in cellular metabolic pathways (Figure 3) [36]. Among the
44,842 consensus sequences, 24,496 can be grouped into

Page 3 of 21

seven categories comprised of 219 known metabolic or
signalling pathways, including cellular growth, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, endocrine, and various
immune-relevant signalling or metabolic pathways
(Table 2).
Annotation of immune-relevant genes and pathways

To gain deep insight into the molecular biology of
immune systems in L. japonicus, the immune-relevant
genes, metabolic and signalling pathways were analysed.
Approximately 2,673 consensus sequences were found
to be homologous to known immune-relevant genes in
other species (Table 3, Additional file 1, Table S1),
including the most important elements of innate and
adaptive immunity, such as pattern recognition receptors (mannose binding proteins, scavenger receptors,
Toll-like receptors, and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins), inflammatory cytokines and receptors (IL-1b, IL10, IL-12, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, IFN-g, TGF-b, VEGF, IL-1,
and TNF receptors), immunoglobins (IgM and IgD),
transcriptional factors (NF-kB, Ik-B, AP-1, transcription
factor 4, chorion specific transcription factor, and transcriptional enhancer factor 5), complement components
(C1q, C1r, C1 s, C2, C4, MASP, Bf, Df, and CR1-5), leukocyte differentiation antigens (CD3, CD4, CD8, and

assigned to at least one GO term. Most consensus sequences were grouped into three major functional categories, namely biological process,
cellular component, and molecular function.

(MHC I, MHC II, TAP1, TAP2, TAP2B, proteosome
subunit, PA28a/b, and constant chain protein li), regulatory molecules involved in immune cellular proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis (growth differentiation factor 11, proliferation associated protein 2G4, apoptotic
peptidase activating factor 1, and anti-apoptotic protein
NR13), and other molecules involved in immune
response (hepcidin, lectin, lysozyme, antimicrobial peptide NK-lysin, chemokines, ferritin, RAG1, and RAG2).
KEGG analysis revealed that approximately 2,082 consensus sequences were significantly enriched in various
known immune-relevant metabolic or signalling pathways (Figure 3). These suggest a considerable conservation of immune-relevant genes and pathways between L.
japonicus and mammals. Conserved genes and pathway
members might include Toll-like receptors (TLR1-9 and
TLR13) and corresponding adaptors in mammals
(MyD88, TRAM, FADD, CASP8, IRAK4, TRAF6, TAK1,
MKK4/7, JNK, and AP-1) and in other fish species
(TLR5a/b, TLR14 and TLR21-23) (Figure 4); T cell
receptors (TCRa/b) and corresponding signalling

Ras, Raf1, and MEKK1) (Figure 5); B cell receptors and
downstream factors (B-cell antigen receptor complexassociated protein a/b chain, CD81, CD22, and BCL10); key molecules involved in antigen presenting and
processing pathways (MHC class I and II, Hsp70,
Hsp90, and Calnexin); members of complement and
coagulation pathways (classical pathway members C1q,
C1r, C1 s, C2, and C4, MBL pathway members MBL
and MASP, alternative pathway members Bf and Df, and
complement receptor type 1); and members involved in
FcεR I signalling pathway (PI3K and SYK), leukocyte
migration (lymphotactin, Rho GTPase-activating protein
5, RhoH, integrin alpha-M, and leukaemia inhibitory
factor receptor), and natural killer-mediated cytotoxicity
(natural killer cell receptor 2B4, natural killer cell protease 1, natural killer cell enhancement factor, natural
killer-tumour recognition sequence, and natural killer
cell stimulatory factor 2). Furthermore, a number of

Automatic Annotation Server for pathway information, and about 24,496 consensus sequences were annotated. The categories GIP and EIP
stand for genetic information processing and environmental information processing, respectively.

consensus genes involved in cellular adhesion, energy
production, and amino acid (arginine and praline) metabolisms were also conserved between fish and mammals.
These genes are indirectly related to immune responses
in mammals. For instance, L-arginine metabolism has
been proven to be related to phagocytosis of macrophages, which eventually led to the discovery of NO signalling molecule [37]. Thus, the involvement of these
consensus genes in metabolic pathways provides the
basis for further identification of the biological functions
of candidate genes in fish immune responses.

Digital gene expression profile analysis after bacterial
challenge

Solexa/Illumina DGE analysis was performed to identify
the genes involved in L. Japonicus response to bacterial
challenge [12]. A total of 3.44 and 3.22 million raw tags
(submitted to GEO database, Association No.
GSE21712) of the mRNAs extracted from head kidney
and spleen of the mock- and bacteria-challenged groups,
respectively, were identified by base calling [38,39].
After transformation of raw sequences into clean tags
by data-processing steps using bio-perl scripts, approximately 0.33 and 0.27 million high quality non-redundant
tags were obtained in both groups (Figure 6). Gene
annotation was performed by tag mapping analysis
using the 169,950 non-redundant consensus sequences
from RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis as reference
transcript database. Results showed that 71.41% and
74.53% of all distinct tags can be mapped to the entire
reference database (sense or anti-sense) in both groups.
Out of the 26,394 sense strands and 23,790 anti-sense
strands detected in the mock-challenged group, about
36,782 (75.1%) sense or anti-sense strands were mapped
by the tags. In contrast, about 34,840 (71.1%) sense or
anti-sense genes were mapped out of the 23,359 sense

and absolute value of log 2 Ratio≥1 were used as the
threshold of significant differences in gene expression.
Approximately 1,224 CD-containing consensus
sequences mapped by 19,548 differentially expressed

challenge. Among them, about 376 consensus sequences
were significantly up-regulated (including 61 most overexpressed sequences that increased by more than 100fold), while 848 consensus sequences were significantly
down-regulated (including 10 most down-regulated
sequences that decreased by 10-100-times) (Figure 7,
Additional file 4, Table S3). The distribution of the significant changes detected is illustrated in a volcano plot
(Figure 8), where the statistical significance of each consensus was plotted against fold change. Sequences with
the highest average differences between the bacteriaand mock-challenged groups (far right and left of the
plot) also had the smallest false discovery rate (FDR)
values. Analysis of the CD-containing consensus
sequences revealed that they all had FDR values less
than 0.1, with the highest value being 0.063.
Functional annotation of consensus sequences was
performed to define the differentially regulated
sequences more precisely. Majority of the 1,183
sequences annotated were related to factors involved in
various immune-relevant pathways, such as TLR pathways (TLR1/3/13/18/21, BTK, IRAK1, IP2, NR2C2, and
UBE2n), TCR signalling pathways (TCR beta chain,
Zap70, LCK, SHP1, CARMA1, Vav, NFAT, GRB2,
MALT1, NCK, and Raf1), antigen presenting and processing relevant pathways (MHC class II transactivator,
CASP1, and CASP8), TGF-b signalling pathway (TGF-b
receptor type-2, Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 4,

serine/threonine kinase receptor, BMPs, and SMAD7),
and various inflammatory cytokines and receptor relevant pathways (IL18R, IL12R b-2 chain, C-C motif chemokine 7, C-C motif chemokine 19, TGFb-1-induced
transcript 1 protein, TNR superfamily member 1A, and
TNFa-induced protein 2). There were annotations in
several other biological processes that may indirectly
participate in immune response, such as the cell cycle;
DNA replication, transcription, and translation; metabolisms of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids; and activation of ATPase family members, transcription
elongation factor B, membrane transport protein,
NADH dehydrogenase, NAD kinase, nucleolar protein 6,
tyrosine protein kinase, ribosomal protein L32, nuclear
receptor, and replication initiator 1. Among the 61 most
over-expressed transcripts and the 10 most down-regulated transcripts, enrichments of factors involved in
metabolic or signalling pathways that have not been
linked to immune responses previously, such as cytoskeleton regulation, calcium signalling pathway, MAPK signalling pathway, aimnocyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and
methionine, glutamate, and aminosugar metabolism,
were detected. Highly responsive consensus sequences
are shown in Table 4.

than 1,183 transcripts were well annotated, whereas

approximately 41 transcripts had low sequence homology to known sequences in public databases, suggesting
that they might be putative novel immune-relevant
genes in L. japonicus involved in the response to bacterial challenge. Among these novel sequences, 13 were
differentially regulated by more than 100-fold, implying
that they were strongly infection-responsive genes. ProDom analysis identified one HSP domain- and one protein kinase domain-containing sequence [42]. SignalP
and TMHMM programs distinguished 24 sequences
with signal peptides or transmembrane domains, suggesting that they are cytokines and transmembrane proteins, respectively [43,44]. Observations presented in
Additional file 5, Table S4 can provide guidance for
further identification. In-depth functional studies of
these novel sequences may benefit the exploration of
potential marine fish-specific immune-relevant genes for
application in the control of fish diseases.
Experimental validation of consensus sequences

To validate the integrity of RNA-seq results, representative consensus sequences with complete encoding
regions, such as hepcidin, Myf5, SNARE, and two IL-8like CXC chemokine family members, were selected for
experimental cloning and sequencing analyses by RTPCR (Additional file 6, Table S5). All experimentally
examined genes matched the RNA-seq-generated

sequences perfectly. One of the two IL-8-like CXC chemokines was newly discovered by this study. The two
IL-8-like CXC chemokine family members were identified through phylogenetic analysis. Both sequences conserved the four cysteine residues (C46-C48-C74-C91) that
are the hallmarks of IL-8 CXC chemokines and can be
found throughout the vertebrate IL-8 family (Additional
file 7, Figure S2 and Additional file 8, Figure S3). This
demonstrates the reliability of RNA-seq results and indicates the necessity for further identification of immunerelated genes in L. japonicus.

Discussion
The transcriptome is the complete repertoire of
expressed RNA transcripts in a cell. Its characterization
is essential in deciphering the functional complexity of
the genome and in obtaining a better understanding of
cellular activities in organisms, including growth, development, disease, and immune defence. The definition of
the transcriptome has long been a challenging task. Traditionally, global gene expression analysis has relied
mostly on several approaches, including RNA hybridisation on high-density arrays, whole-genome tiling arrays,
expressed sequence tag (EST), serial analysis of gene
expression (SAGE), and SAGE-derived technologies,
which include massively parallel signature sequencing
(MPSS) and polony multiplex analysis of gene

Limitations of all differentially expressed genes are based on P ≤ 0.01. The absolute value of Log2Ratio≥1 and FDR≤0.05 showed that the genes were significantly
altered after bacterial challenge. The cutoff E-value was set to 1e-10 during the gene annotation process. The absolute value of “Fold Change” means magnitude
of up- or down-regulation for each gene/homolog after bacteria challenge; “+” indicates up-regulation, “-” indicates down-regulation.

expression. However, these approaches have several
inherent limitations. For example, the array-based
approaches allow detection of specific sequences only
and capture the transcriptome while ignoring splicejunction information or alternative splicing events. The
EST approach provides only partial sequences of individual cDNA clones, is sensitive to cloning biases, and is
associated with high costs and difficulties in data analysis. SAGE and MPSS are also costly and cannot be used
for splicing events [9]. Thus, the newly developed
Solexa/Illumina RNA-seq and DGE high-throughput
deep sequencing approaches have dramatically changed
how functional complexity of the transcriptome can be
studied. These approaches overcome many of the inherent limitations of traditional systems, making the detection of alternative splicing events and low-abundance
transcripts possible. They have been applied recently to
several species, such as yeast, Arabidopsis, Chlamydomonas, Zebrafish, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, and human,
for different purposes [9,10,18-29].
In this study, the transcriptome profile analysis of bacteria-challenged L. japonicus was conducted through
these two approaches in an attempt to gain deep
insights into the immunogenetics of a marine species.
As expected, a large set of transcriptional sequences
with complete or differing lengths of encoding regions
was generated. KEGG analysis showed that more than
52% of transcripts are enrichment factors involved in
approximately 219 known metabolic or signalling pathways, including cellular growth, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, endocrine, and immune system processes.
Further, more than 8% of transcripts represent novel
fish-specific genes that have never been described previously. Detailed analysis of immune-relevant genes and
pathways showed that more than 2,673 transcripts are
homologous to known immune-relevant genes, whereas

approximately 2,082 transcripts can be enriched in various immune-relevant metabolic or signalling pathways.
Challenging the fish with V. harveyi resulted in large
alterations of the host transcriptome profile, including
significant up- or down-regulation of 1,224 transcripts,
among which 41 sequences might be novel immunerelevant genes in fish. In addition, several other biological processes that have not been linked to host immunity before, such as the metabolism of carbohydrates,
amino acids, and lipids; activation of ATPase, NADH
dehydrogenase, NAD kinase, and tyrosine protein
kinase; and up-regulation of nuclear receptors, replication initiators, and ribosomal proteins, were found to be
dramatically involved in host immune response. These
significantly regulated transcripts might represent strong
infection-responsive genes in L. japonicus, and reflect a
number of immune activities during fish defence against
bacterial challenge. The transcriptome profiling data sets
obtained in this study provide strong basis for future
genetic research in marine fish and support further
in-depth genome annotation in vertebrates. Future
molecular and functional characterisation of infectionresponsive genes could lead to global identification of
immune-relevant genes and infection markers in marine
fish.
At present, transcriptome analysis in fish relies mainly
on the EST approach [45,46]. Although there have been
an increasing number of ESTs sequenced in a large
number of libraries in various fish species, including
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar), medaka (Oryzias latipes), and zebrafish
(Danio rerio), the immune-relevant transcriptional profiling data sets obtained from fish are still insufficient.
Recently, DGE- and microarray-based transcriptome
profiling studies performed in zebrafish revealed that
zebrafish and its developing embryo are useful in vivo

Xiang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:472
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/472

models for the identification of host determinants of
responses to bacterial infection [9,10]. However, transcriptional information on immune responses to infection in a non-model marine fish remains elusive.
Therefore, the large set of immune-relevant genes and
their role in responses to bacterial challenge in L. japonicus presented in this study may largely improve
knowledge on fish immunogenetics in other analytical
systems. The present study also demonstrates the
advantages of new deep sequencing approaches for gene
discovery, thus providing new leads for functional studies of candidate genes involved in host-bacteria interactions. The RNA-Seq and DGE analyses conducted in
this study were found to complement each other well.
RNA-Seq was very effective in unravelling transcriptome
complexity, and can detect a large set of genes, including numerous low-expressing genes or novel genes.
DEG data can be merged with RNA-Seq data sets, indicating an affordable method for comparative gene
expression study. Thus, RNA-Seq was initially
performed in this study to provide strong reference
transcriptome database for subsequent DGE analysis.
Emerging hallmark components and the cells necessary for innate and adaptive immunity in higher vertebrates have been identified in fish [47,48]. This was the
basis for the widely accepted notion that innate and
adaptive immunity was established in teleosts about 470
million years ago. However, the exact molecular and cellular basis of immune systems in teleosts remains poorly
understood. The precise regulatory mechanisms underlying the innate and adaptive immunity of teleosts
remain vague due to the limited immune-relevant
genetic information available in fish. The present work
on the definition of high-throughput transcriptome data
set of the immune system of L. japonicus may contribute greatly to better understanding of the molecular
and cellular activities involved in fish immunity. Results
unexpectedly showed that the fish immune system is
more complex than previously thought. On one hand,
the substantial amount of immune-relevant genes
involved in metabolic and signalling pathways and the
induction of genes encoding cell surface receptors, signalling intermediates, transcription factors, and inflammatory mediators show a clear conservation of
mechanisms detected in other vertebrate models, including humans. On the other hand, a large set of novel
immune response genes and infection markers that have
never been linked previously to immune responses in
other vertebrate systems was identified in L. japonicus,
indicating the existence of numerous fish-specific
immune activities during early vertebrate evolution.
For instance, the TLR family is the most important
class of pattern recognition receptors that play crucial
roles in mediating immune responses to pathogenic

Page 16 of 21

microorganisms [8,49,50]. Triggering of TLRs by ligands
leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins, resulting in
the activation of a range of transcription factors, such as
NF-B, activator protein 1 (AP-1), and IFN regulatory
factors (IRFs), through distinct signalling pathways. This
eventually leads to the downstream activation of proinflammatory cytokines and receptors, such as IFN-a/b,
TNF-a, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL10, CD40, CD86, and MIP1a.
To date, 13 TLRs (TLR1-13), at least five adaptor proteins (MyD88, Mal/TIRAP, TIR domain-containing
adaptor protein, TRIF/TICAM1, TRAM/TICAM2, and
SARM), and numerous downstream effectors have been
described in mammals and humans. In the present
study, a series of TLRs and corresponding adaptor proteins and downstream effectors were identified in L.
japonicus. The identified TLRs include the majority seen
in mammals and humans (TLR1-13), and four TLRs
(TLR14, TLR18, TLR21, and TLR23) seen in fish species. Adaptor proteins and downstream effectors identified include the majority known in mammals and
humans, including MYD88, BTK, TOLLIP, FADD,
HMGB1, HRAS, HSPD1, CASP8, MAPK8IP3, PELI1,
RIPK2, SARM1, TICAM2, TIRAP, EIF2AK2, IRAK1,
IRAK2, MAP3K7, MAP3K7IP1, NR2C2, PPARA,
PRKRA, TRAF6, UBE2N, and UBE2V1. These adaptor
proteins and downstream effectors have been found to
be well enriched in various known TLR signalling
pathways. Downstream transcriptional factors and proinflammatory cytokines mediated by these pathways,
including NF-B, JNK/p38, NF/IL6, IRF, IFN-a/b, TNFa, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, was also be identified
successfully. These suggest that TLR mechanisms are
conserved from fish to mammals throughout vertebrate
evolution. A putative draft of TLR signalling pathways
in L. japonicus based on knowledge of TLR signalling in
mammalian species was constructed (Figure 4). However, TLR signalling pathways in fish might be more
intricate compared with those in mammalian species
because of the novel TLRs (TLR14, TLR18, TLR21, and
TLR23). An in-depth study of novel TLRs will improve
understanding of fish-specific innate immunity in early
vertebrates and even the complete evolutionary history
of TLR-based innate immunity. DGE analysis revealed
that TLR-1, -3, -13, -18, -21 and their signalling intermediates (Rac1, AKT, CASP8, IRAK1, TRAM, IRAK1,
IKK alpha/beta, IRF7, and STAT1) were up- or downregulated dramatically at different levels in the pathway
upon bacterial challenge (P ≤ 0.01). This provides evidence that both conserved (TLR-1, -3, -13) and fish-specific (TLR-18, -21) TLR-based immunity participates in
fish defence against bacterial challenge.
The innate immune system is generally believed to
represent the evolutionarily ancient aspect of vertebrate
immunity. As a representative of lower vertebrates, fish

Xiang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:472
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/472

is suggested to possess stronger innate immune
responses. However, fish adaptive immunity might be
more primitive because of limited immunoglobulins and
hallmark components necessary for adaptive immunity
identified in this species [7]. In recent years, several hallmarks for T and B cells (TCR, BCR, CD3, CD4, and
CD8), antigen presenting and processing molecules
(MHCI, MHCII, and DC-SIGN/CD209), co-stimulatory
factors (CD80/86, CD83, CD154, and CD40), and
immunoglobulins (IgM, IgD, and IgZ/T) have been
identified in teleost fish, thus providing preliminary evidence that the adaptive immune system might also be
well-established in fish. However, the precise molecular
and cellular bases and mechanisms underlying teleost
adaptive immunity are still uncharacterised and require
further immunogenetic studies. The present study successfully identified a large number of adaptive immunerelevant components homologous to those in higher
vertebrates, providing abundant data sets for insights
into the characterisation and origin of adaptive immunity in early vertebrates. Data sets imply that adaptive
immunity in teleost fish seems to be much more complicated than previously believed. The basic components
and signalling pathways necessary for adaptive immunity
exist in fish, and a majority showed clear conservation
between fish and mammals. For instance, T cell receptor
(TCR) signalling pathways regulate T cell activation, one
of the most important processes in adaptive immunity
[51]. Majority of the four types of TCRs (TCR-a/b, -gδ)
and numerous signalling transducers (Zap70, Lyn, LCK,
SHP1, CD3, ITAM, LAT, Fyb, SLP-76, CBL, NCK, LAT,
GRB2, CARMA1, NFAT, AP1, MALT1, and GRB2) discovered in humans and mammals can be identified in L.
japonicus. DGE analysis showed that a number of TCR
signalling pathway members, including TCR beta chain,
Zap70, LCK, SHP1, CARMA1, Vav, NFAT, GRB2,
MALT1, NCK, and Raf1, are induced significantly after
bacterial challenge (P ≤ 0.01). These pathway members
largely contribute to the proliferation and activation of
T cells in mammals, thus suggesting that TCR signalling
mechanisms underlying the T cell activation might be
conserved between teleost fish and mammals. A putative
draft of TCR signalling pathways based on knowledge of
pathways known in mammals was constructed (Figure
5). Future studies on these pathways are expected to not
only enrich current knowledge on fish immunology but
also contribute to better understanding of the evolutionary history of adaptive immunity.

Conclusions
This study investigated the transcriptome profile of bacteria-challenged L. japonicus using Solexa/Illumina
RNA-seq and DGE deep sequencing technologies. The
substantial amount of transcripts obtained provides a

strong basis for future genomic research on marine fish
and supports in-depth genome annotation in vertebrates. Globally identified immune-candidate genes,
infection markers, and putative signalling pathways in
L. japonicus revealed that the immune system of fish
may be much more complex than previously believed. A
considerable amount of immune-relevant genes and
pathways in fish showed significant similarity to vertebrate models, suggesting that mechanisms underlying
the innate and adaptive immunity in fish may be conserved in higher vertebrates. In addition, a large set of
novel immune response genes that have never been
linked previously to immune responses in other vertebrate systems indicate the existence of numerous fishspecific immune events during early evolution. This suggests that innate and adaptive immunity might be well
established in teleost marine fish. Findings provide deep
insight into the immunogenetics of fish species, which
can be clinically applied in the therapy of fish diseases.
They also contribute to a better understanding of the
evolutionary history of innate and adaptive immunity
from fish to mammals.

Methods
Experimental fish

One-year-old Japanese sea bass of both sexes, weighing
48.6 ± 2.5 g, were obtained from the fishery institute of
Zhejiang, China. They were kept in running aerated seawater (salinity 30) at 25°C and fed with commercial pellet food at a daily ration of 0.7% body weight. All fish
were maintained in the laboratory for at least two weeks
prior to experimental use to allow for acclimatisation
and evaluation of overall fish health. Only healthy fish,
as determined by general appearance and level of activity, were used in the experiment.
Bacterial strain

Wild-type marine fish-virulent V harveyi strain (96-915),
a pathogen for bacterial septicaemia in L. japonicas, was
maintained in the laboratory. It was cultured in Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts Sucrose at 27°C overnight. The
desired number of cells was adjusted to 5 × 108 CFU/
ml. Cells were inactivated with 5% formalin at 27°C
overnight before thorough washing with sterile PBS (pH
7.0). They were re-suspended in PBS prior to use.
Bacterial challenge and RNA preparation

Fish in the experimental groups were inoculated intraperitoneally with 0.2 ml of V harveyi at 1 × 108 CFU
per fish. In parallel, fish in the control groups were
administrated with 0.2 ml of mock PBS. Both groups
were kept under conditions as described above. At
seven days post-challenge, fish were sacrificed after
anaesthesia, and tissues from the head kidney and spleen

Xiang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:472
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/472

were collected. Tissue samples from 15 fishes were
mixed for RNA preparation. Total RNA was isolated
using a TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL) following the manufacturer’s instructions and treated with RNase free
DNase I (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were measured
using a spectrophotometer and integrity was ensured
through analysis on a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel.
Sample Preparation for RNA-seq

After RNA extraction, poly-A-containing mRNAs were
purified using oligo-dT-attached magnetic beads and
fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations
under elevated temperature. Cleaved RNA fragments
were copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. This was followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase I
and RNase H. These cDNA fragments underwent end
repair process, addition of a single ‘A’ base, and ligation
of adapters. Products were subsequently purified and
amplified through PCR to create the final cDNA
libraries.
Transcriptome analysis

Transcriptome sequencing was conducted using Solexa/
Illumina RNA-seq. Four fluorescently labelled nucleotides and a specialised polymerase were used to determine the clusters base by base in parallel. The 75-bp
raw PE reads (submitted to GEO database, Association
No. GSE21721) were generated by the Illumina Genome
Analyzer II system. Raw reads were then assembled into
non-redundant consensus sequences using Grape, tgicl,
and CAP3 softwares [52,53]. All sequences were examined for possible sequencing errors. Adaptor sequences
were trimmed using the Cross_Match software in the
Phrap package http://www.phrap.org/[54]. Short
sequences (< 100 bp in length) were removed using custom Perl program [55]. The resulting high-quality
sequences were assembled into sequence contigs with
the TGICL program, which creates an assembly using
CAP3. Sequence homology searches were performed
using local BLASTall programs against sequences in
NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database and the
Swissprot database (E-value < 1e-10). Genes were tentatively identified according to the best hits against known
sequences. Assembled consensus sequences were used
to determine the GO term, COG term, and were analyzed further using KEGG.
DGE-tag profiling

DGE analysis included sample preparation and sequencing. Sequence tag preparation was performed using the
Digital Gene Expression Tag Profile Kit (Illumina)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 6
μg total RNA was used for mRNA purification using

Page 18 of 21

oligo-dT magnetic bead adsorption and oligo-dT was
used to guide reverse transcription for double-stranded
cDNA synthesis. The generation of 5’ ends of tags was
done using endonuclease NlaIII, which recognizes and
cuts off the CATG sites on cDNA. cDNA fragments
with 3’ ends were purified through magnetic bead precipitation, and Illumina adapter 1 was added to the 5’
ends. The junction of Illumina adapter 1 and CATG site
was the recognition site of MmeI, which cuts 17 bp
downstream of the CATG site, producing tags with
adapter 1. After removal of 3’ fragments with magnetic
bead precipitation, the 21-bp unique tags with adaptor 1
were purified and ligated to adaptor 2 to form a cDNA
tag library. These adapter-ligated cDNA tags were
enriched after 15 cycles of linear PCR amplification. The
resulting 85-bp fragments were purified by 6% TBE
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fragments were then
digested and the single-chain molecules were fixed onto
the Solexa Sequencing Chip (flowcell). Sequencing by
synthesis was performed using the Illumina Genome
Analyzer II system according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Image analysis, base calling, generation of raw
17-bp tags, and tag counting were performed using the
Illumina pipeline. Raw data (tag sequences) were deposited in the GEO database under submission number
GSE21712.
Aligning DGE tags to reference transcriptome data set

Clean tags and count number of DGE libraries from
bacteria- and mock-challenged groups were collected
and summarised using custom Bio-perl scripts. All tags
were mapped to the reference transcriptome generated
by RNA-seq. To monitor mapping events on both
strands, both sense and complementary antisense
sequences were included in the mapping process. Only
perfect matches over the entire 21-bp length of the 17bp tag plus the 4-bp NlaIII recognition site were
allowed. This study was limited to tags that mapped to
ORFs only and cannot show tags that mapped to
mRNA with long 3’UTRs.
Identification of differentially expressed genes

Rigorous algorithms were developed to identify differentially expressed genes between two samples. The correlation of the detected count numbers between parallel
libraries was assessed statistically by calculating the
Pearson correlation. In addition to the P value, FDR was
manipulated to determine differentially expressed genes
[56]. Assuming that R differentially expressed genes
have been selected, S genes really show differential
expression, whereas the other V genes are false positives. If the error ratio Q = V/R must remain below a
cutoff (5%), FDR should not exceed 0.05. In this
research, P ≤ 0.01, FDR ≤ 0.1, and the absolute value of

Xiang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:472
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/472

log2Ratio≥1 were used as threshold to assess the significance of gene expression difference. More stringent criteria with smaller FDR and bigger fold-change values
can be used to identify differentially expressed genes.
Experimental validation

Representative consensus sequences with complete
ORFs (hepcidin, Myf5, SNARE, syntaxin, and IL-8-like
homologues) generated by RNA-seq were selected for
experimental cloning and sequencing validation. The
cDNAs of these genes were amplified by RT-PCR using
the primers shown in Supplemental Table 6. All PCR
products were purified using Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), cloned into pUCm-T vector (TaKaRa), and
sequenced on MegaBACE 1000 Sequencer (GE) using
the DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Kit (Pharmacia). Protein sequence alignments were generated using the Cluster W program (version 1.83). The
phylogenies of protein sequences were estimated using
MEGA 3.0 with the neighbour-joining method.
