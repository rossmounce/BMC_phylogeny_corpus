results in altered starch fine structure, decreased
digestibility and reduced coleoptile growth
during germination

Abstract
Background: Two distinct starch branching enzyme (SBE) isoforms predate the divergence of monocots and
dicots and have been conserved in plants since then. This strongly suggests that both SBEI and SBEII provide
unique selective advantages to plants. However, no phenotype for the SBEI mutation, sbe1a, had been previously
observed. To explore this incongruity the objective of the present work was to characterize functional and
molecular phenotypes of both sbe1a and wild-type (Wt) in the W64A maize inbred line.
Results: Endosperm starch granules from the sbe1a mutant were more resistant to digestion by pancreatic aamylase, and the sbe1a mutant starch had an altered branching pattern for amylopectin and amylose. When
kernels were germinated, the sbe1a mutant was associated with shorter coleoptile length and higher residual
starch content, suggesting that less efficient starch utilization may have impaired growth during germination.
Conclusions: The present report documents for the first time a molecular phenotype due to the absence of SBEI,
and suggests strongly that it is associated with altered physiological function of the starch in vivo. We believe that
these results provide a plausible rationale for the conservation of SBEI in plants in both monocots and dicots, as
greater seedling vigor would provide an important survival advantage when resources are limited.

Background
The starch granule is a highly-ordered structure with
alternating crystalline and amorphous growth rings
[1,2]. Starch molecules are biopolymers of anhydroglucose units linked by a-1,4 and a-1,6 glycosidic bonds.
They are composed of two glucan polymers, the generally linear fraction, amylose, and the branched fraction,
amylopectin. The constituent amylopectin chains can be
mainly categorized into A chains (not bearing any
branches) and B chains (bearing one or more branches)
[3]. The main physiological functions of starch include
high-density storage of energy and the controlled release
of this energy during starch degradation.
Starch-branching enzyme (SBE) plays an important
role in starch biosynthesis by introducing branch points,

the a-1,6 linkages in starch. Boyer and Preiss [4] identified three major SBE isoforms in developing maize kernels: SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb. The SBE isoforms have
been shown to be encoded by different genes [5-8]. Phylogenetic analyses of SBE sequences from a number of
plant species have shown that the SBEI and SBEII isoforms are conserved among most plants, and that
SBEIIa and SBEIIb isoforms are conserved among most
monocots [9-13]. Furthermore, genes belonging to both
the SBEI and SBEII families can be identified in various
lineages of green alga, which supports the theory that
these two families of genes evolved approximately a billion years ago [14]. These examples of extreme evolutionary conservation are strong evidence for a specific
and vital role for each enzyme isoform in starch
biosynthesis.
In vitro biochemical analyses have documented that
the SBEI and SBEII isoform activities are not identical
[15,16], but these studies do not necessarily indicate

their action in vivo, as starch biosynthesis occurs in the
presence of starch synthases and debranching enzymes.
Studies have suggested that multi-protein starch synthesizing complexes exist, and that interactions within
these complexes could modulate the intricate structure
of a developing starch granule [17-33]. Whether there
are functional differences among SBE isoforms in vivo
remains to be addressed.
Insight into a possible in vivo function of an SBE may
be gained from the study of sbe mutants deficient in
one or more SBE isoform activities. The maize amylose
extender (ae) mutant, which is deficient in SBEIIb, has a
profound effect on starch structure, leading to an
increased amylose proportion and a reduced branching
density of endosperm amylopectin [5,33-35]. More
recently, studies of a maize sbe2a mutant showed that
deficiency of the SBEIIa isoform decreased plant fitness
and resulted in lower kernel yield, but there was minimal effect on kernel starch properties [11,36]. Previous
work showed no effect of SBEI deficiency (in the sbe1a
mutation) on starch molecular size and on chain length
distribution after debranching [26,37]. Subsequently,
preliminary analysis of susceptibility of sbe1a endosperm
starch to pancreatic a-amylase digestion, using the
AOAC procedure (2002.02) to determine enzyme-resistant starch (RS), indicated that sbe1a mutant endosperm
starch had a greater resistance to digestion [38]. We reasoned that it was likely that the deficiency in SBEI led to
reduced susceptibility to enzymatic digestion by altering
the starch structure in some way. Thus, in this work we
sought to confirm this initial observation and to explore
more subtle aspects of starch structure in the sbe1a
mutant. The objective of the present work was to characterize functional and molecular phenotypes of both
sbe1a and wild-type (Wt) in the W64A maize inbred
line.

Results
Starch Molecular Structure

To study the functional role of SBEI on molecular structure of amylose and amylopectin, Wt Sbe1a starch and
mutant sbe1a starch were fractionated from mature kernels. The maize sbe1a mutant contains a Mu transposon
in the 14th exon of the Sbe1a gene, and was previously
shown to be null for the expression of SBEI transcript
and protein [37]. The proportions, iodine binding properties, and size-exclusion chromatograms for the amylopectin and amylose fractions were similar for Wt and
sbe1a starch (data not shown). To study the molecular
fine structure, b-amylolysis and subsequent isoamylase
and pullulanase debranching were applied to both the
amylopectin and amylose fractions from Wt and sbe1a.
Despite a similar chain length (CL) profile observed for
both fractions from the two genotypes (see Additional

Page 2 of 13

File 1 online), the CL distribution after various extents
of b-amylolysis showed differences for Wt and sbe1a
(Figure 1A; see Additional File 2 online).
For the amylopectin fraction from both genotypes,
hydrolysis with b-amylase caused a dramatic change in
CL distribution within the first 10 min (Figure 1A): A
major increase was observed below degree of polymerization (DP) ~10. In this region for Wt, the change in
the CL distribution from 10 min to 24 h of b-amylolysis
was primarily a reduction of the DP 4 stubs to DP 2
stubs; however, for the sbe1a sample no further reduction in DP 4 was observed after 10 min (Figure 1A).
After 24 h of b-amylolysis, conditions necessary to produce b-limit dextrin (b-LD) [39,40], the sbe1a sample
had a much smaller proportion of the DP 2 chains and
a much larger proportion of DP 4 chains than the Wt
sample (Figure 1A; see Additional File 2 &3 online).
For the amylose fraction from both genotypes, b-LD
was produced. Analysis of the CL distribution of isoamylase-debranched b-LDs showed a higher proportion
of chains of DP ≥ 100 and lower proportions of other
chains (DP < 100), before and after pullulanase addition
(Figure 1B; see Additional File 4 online). The subsequent pullulanase debranching led to an increase in
both the DP 3 and DP 2 areas for both genotypes, and
this increase was greater in sbe1a (Figure 1B; see Additional File 4 online). The subsequent pullulanase debranching also led to a decrease in chains of
approximately DP 8-9 for both genotypes (Figure 1B).
Starch Digestibility In vitro by Pancreatic a-Amylase

Starch hydrolysis is an important feature of starch function both in the plant and when the plant is used for
human food. Hydrolysis of starch ingested as food can
vary both with respect to the rate and the extent of
digestion by pancreatic a-amylase. In the human digestive tract, the undigested starch that reaches the colon is
termed RS; the level of RS is a measure of the extent of
digestion by this enzyme. An official in vitro method
(AOAC 2002.02) is used for determination of the RS
level. This method was modified to allow study of both
the digestion rate and the extent of digestion [41,42]. Ftests performed for a fully nested analysis of variance
(ANOVA) showed an effect of genotype (p = 0.000), but
no effect of biological replication (p = 0.334). The RS
value was higher in the sbe1a mutant starch (13.2%)
than in the Wt starch (1.6%) from measures of 3 biological replications (p < 0.05).
The digestion pattern was similar among the three
biological replications for each genotype (data not
shown). For graphic illustration of the digestion timecourse, curves for one biological replication for each
genotype are shown in Figure 2. The kinetics of digestion were analyzed using a five-parameter, double-

calculated as the areas for DP ≥ 17.5, 7.5 ≤ DP ≤ 17.5, 4.5 ≤ DP ≤ 7.5, 3.5 ≤ DP ≤ 4.5, 2.5 ≤ DP ≤ 3.5, and DP ≤ 2.5, respectively, as in [40].

h. 3b-Limit dextrin was obtained after 3 times of 24-h b-amylolysis on amylose.

and the calculated parameters are presented in Table 1.
A higher y0 (the limit of digestion as determined using
the model) was found in sbe1a than for Wt (Table 1),
consistent with the higher limit of digestion given by
the RS value for this genotype.
Granular Morphology of Native Starch and Residual
Starch after Digestion

Scanning electron microscopy was used to image starch
granules from Wt and sbe1a mutant plants in native
form and after the 16 h in vitro digestion with pancreatic a-amylase for determination of the RS value. Prior to
digestion, native starch granules from Wt and sbe1a had

similar morphology (Figure 3A) with an average diameter of 10.2 μm for Wt and 9.8 μm for sbe1a. However, after digestion, differences were observed between
the two genotypes (Figure 3B; see Additional File 5 &6
online). Samples of the sbe1a RS contained many residual granules with distinct holes in the surface and hollow interiors, whereas for Wt only small fragments of
residual granules were seen (Figure 3B). The Wt fragments also showed evident alternating layers on the
edge of the pieces, which was less evidently present in
sbe1a samples (Figure 3B; see Additional File 6 online).
Light micrographs of iodine-stained native granules
are shown in Figure 3C. For both genotypes, all native
starch granules were stained blue and produced a

differences in germination rate. The coleoptile length of
each genotype was measured daily over 11 days (Figure 4).
The average length of sbe1a coleoptiles was shorter than
Wt from Day 7 onward (Figure 4). For both genotypes the
endosperm starch content decreased over time (Figure 4).
On Days 6, 8, and 11, the starch content was higher in
sbe1a germinating endosperm as compared to Wt, suggesting less utilization of starch. This trend is consistent
with the reduced growth of sbe1a coleoptiles after Day 6.

showed more heterogeneity in staining as compared to
Wt, as there were more relatively dark-stained granules
in sbe1a than in Wt native starch (24.3% and 8.7%).
Starch Utilization during Kernel Germination

As endosperm starch from the sbe1a mutant has a lower
susceptibility to pancreatic a-amylase, we suspected that
the sbe1a endosperm starch might be less readily utilized during kernel germination. To study the effect of
sbe1a on kernel germination, starch utilization and
coleoptile growth during germination of Wt and sbe1a
mutant kernels were examined.
All the kernels from three different ears of both Wt and
sbe1a genotypes were germinated, demonstrating no

Values are expressed as mean ± SD for three biological replications. Values
for each biological replication were obtained from fit of combined data from
two independent digestions. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in the same
column, as determined by one-way ANOVA analysis, are indicated by different
superscripts.

In the present study, rapid degradation of chains DP
≥18 and DP 8-17 were observed for both Wt and sbe1a
samples in the first 10 min of b-amylolysis (Figure 1A).
As b-amylase cannot bypass branch points to hydrolyze
starch chains, a plausible interpretation for the less
extensive degradation of DP 8-17 in sbe1a would be
that the B chains (those chains with other chains
attached) [43] would have slightly longer internal segments and shorter external chains. For the second stage
of b-amylolysis [44], a slow reduction in the amount of
DP 4 chains was observed in Wt samples over the period of 10 min to 24 h but not in sbe1a samples (Figure
1A), suggesting differences in the proportion of branch
points that would differentially limit access of the
enzyme to glycosidic linkages [40].
Amylopectin branching pattern models for both sbe1a
and Wt are presented to account for this difference in
b-amylase action on DP 4 stubs (Figure 5A). In the
model for sbe1a, DP 4 stubs would be difficult for bamylase to hydrolyze to DP 2 when closely associated
branch points present a steric barrier to binding of bamylase. Although most of the DP 4 is from residual A
chains [43], some DP 4 chains from residual B chains
would result from short B chains with short internal
segments. The incomplete hydrolysis of DP 4 in sbe1a
suggests that A chains are preferentially localized near
another branch point, leading to 1) hindered hydrolysis
of residual A chains of DP 4 to DP 2 due to steric constraint, and 2) more residual B chains with DP 4 due to
incidence of short internal segments (Figure 5A). In the
model for Wt, the DP 4 stubs would be slowly hydrolyzed to DP 2, as there is less steric hindrance from
proximal branch points. According to the two models,
sbe1a amylopectin contains a higher proportion of closely associated branch points than Wt. Furthermore,
based on CL profiles (see Additional File 1 online), the
calculated overall average branching density is similar in
the two amylopectins. Thus, we suggest that the effect
of the sbe1a mutation is to increase the local concentration of branch points but not to influence the overall
amount of branch points in amylopectin.

Figure 4 Germination analysis of Wt and sbe1a mutant kernels.
The lengths of the emerged coleoptiles were measured on
successive days during the incubation period1. Starch content in the
germinating endosperm was quantified at Day 1, 6, 8, 11, and
percentage of starch content at each day against the dry weight of
Day 1 kernels was plotted1. 1Each data point is mean ± standard
error of measurements of kernels from three biological replications.
As 2 kernels were removed at Day 1, 6, 8, 11 for quantifying starch
content, 15, 13, 11, and 9 kernels from three biological replications
were used for coleoptile measurement Day 1, 2-6, 7-8, 9-11,
respectively. Comparison between two genotypes for each day was
made by one-way ANOVA analysis and a significant difference was
marked by an asterisk (p < 0.05).

In the debranched b-LDs from the amylose fraction
(but not in intact amylose), a higher proportion of long
chains of DP ≥ 100 was observed in sbe1a (Figure 1B
and Additional File 1 online). The higher proportion of
longer chains in b-LDs of amylose from sbe1a can be
explained by branch points that tend to be closer to the
non-reducing ends, so that longer internal chains result.
When debranching of b-LDs from amylose was performed with isoamylase without subsequent pullulanase
digestion, there were fewer DP 2 than DP 3 chains (Figure 1B; see Additional File 4 online). For b-LD from
amylopectin, all of the DP 3 and some of the DP 2
chains are known to be debranched by isoamylase [40].
However, our results of b-LD from amylose for both

genotypes suggest that even some DP 3 chains are not
debranched by isoamylase. Comparing sbe1a to Wt,
more of DP 2 and DP 3 chains are not debranched by
isoamylase in b-LD from sbe1a amylose (Figure 1B). As
the structures escaping isoamylase debranching may
have closely associated branch points and those structures can be debranched by pullulanase [40], a greater
increase in both DP 2 and DP 3 by subsequent pullulanase treatment suggests that a higher proportion of
these structures are resistant to isoamylase in amylose
from sbe1a. Amylose branching pattern models are presented in Figure 5B to account for the difference in isoamylase action. In the model for sbe1a, A chains are
preferentially attached by branch points close to each
other whereas in Wt, A chains are not, leading to less
hindered isoamylase debranching.
Our data suggest that amylose of sbe1a mutant starch
has 1) longer internal chains and 2) more A chains
attached by branch points close to each other. This evidence can be used to create an overall model for amylose branching patterns of sbe1a and Wt (Figure 5C).
The models are drawn taking into account similar CL
profiles (see Additional File 1 online) and assuming that
~50% of amylose molecules are branched, with ~5-6
branches per molecule [45]. According to the proposed
model, for sbe1a, A chains are closer to each other, and
the location of the chains tends to be more towards
non-reducing end. For Wt, A chains are farther away
from each other, and the location of the chains is more
random and thus more distributed.
Starch Digestion

Kinetic analysis shows that the y0 value for Wt starch is
effectively zero (Table 1), in agreement with the RS
value for Wt starch (1.6%), and the y0 and RS values for
sbe1a starch are also in good agreement.
The kinetic model is based on the presence of two
general types of starch substrate: a rapidly-digested substrate (S1), and a slowly-digested substrate (S2) [41,42].
The two genotypes differ both in the proportions of S1
and S 2 and the reaction rate constants for these two
components. The S 1 components of Wt and sbe1a
starch were 85.9% and 59.8% respectively. This suggests
that the sbe1a mutation altered the starch structure and
this resulted in less rapidly-digested component. Consistent with our results, Ao et al. [46] found that increased
branch density led to a decreased proportion of RDS
(analogous to our S 1 ) and an increased proportion of
SDS (analogous to our S2).
Starch Granular Structure

Two microscopic techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM), were employed
to observe granular structure before and after RS

digestion by pancreatic a-amylase. Native starch granules from Wt and sbe1a appear similar in size, shape,
degree of birefringence, and morphology, as described in
a previous report for wx and sbe1a wx granules [47].
Polarized light microscopy (see Additional File 5 online)
shows that almost all of the digested Wt granules had
lost their birefringence, while for sbe1a, many digested
granules had maintained some birefringence in the peripheral area of the granules, which indicates that the
center of the digested sbe1a granules is either gone or
no longer crystalline enough to show birefringence. The
presence of a hollow interior in the digested sbe1a granules was confirmed by SEM (Figure 3B), indicating a
relatively greater resistance to digestion for the exterior
portion of the sbe1a granule.
Most of the recovered RS from Wt were represented
by small granule fragments. However, the sbe1a RS
showed variations in morphology, from small fragments
to hollow granules. The difference in digestion of individual granules may be due to differences in heterogeneity
in granule structure, as a higher proportion of relatively
dark-stained granules were observed in sbe1a than in
Wt native starch (Figure 3C). SEM revealed the presence of alternating layers in the Wt residual fragments
(Figure 3B), which probably reflect the residual growth
rings after digestion.
By observing the sbe1a RS by SEM (Figure 3B), one
may roughly estimate that, for the recovered granules,
approximately 40% of granule content has escaped
digestion. However the RS value for sbe1a starch is
approximately 13%. Therefore, some of the sbe1a granules were likely to have been digested completely. The
heterogeneity found among sbe1a granules (Figure 3C)
may account for different degree of digestion of individual granules. Thus, it can be reasoned that the micrographs of the sbe1a RS may disproportionately represent
the more resistant granules.
A distinct feature of the recovered sbe1a RS is the
presence of holes on the surface of the peripheral portion of the granules. These holes are possibly from the
enlargement of the surface pores in native granules by
a-amylase hydrolysis [48]. The presence of these holes
on the shell is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that digestion of normal granules starts with
surface pores and proceeds through deeper hydrolysis in
channels [49-52], followed by fragmentation [48]. In the
current study, the presence of remaining shells with
holes in the sbe1a RS indicates continuing difficulty in
digestion by a-amylase. Neither holes nor shells were
observed in the Wt RS, indicating a more complete
digestion.
As observed under microscopy, the RS from Wt consists mostly of portions of residual growth rings, while
the RS of sbe1a is mostly residual peripheral regions.

Xia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/95

The kinetic analysis shows that the digestion of sbe1a
starch reached a plateau by 16 h, suggesting the RS
from sbe1a is not further digested. When the RS is
observed by SEM, one can conclude that some of the
peripheral regions in sbe1a starch granules cannot be
further digested. Enrichment of amylose has been found
by some to exist toward the granule peripheral region
[53,54]. SEM showed that the peripheral regions were
more resistant to a-amylase digestion in sbe1a granules.
It is possible that these differences may be preferentially
localized in the peripheral region of the granules, where
starch synthesis may be more influenced by deficiency
of SBEI [10]. The CL distribution of residual starch collected after a-amylase digestion showed some small differences between Wt and sbe1a (see Additional File 7
online). However, no direct evidence was obtained in
the current study about whether the molecular structure
in the peripheral regions was different in sbe1a.
Starch Utilization during Kernel Germination

An endogenous a-amylase is considered to be responsible for attacking the starch granule and initiating starch
hydrolysis in germinating cereal endosperm [55]. Starch
hydrolysis continues by the action of limit dextrinase, aamylase, b-amylase, and a-glucosidase to produce maltose and glucose for plant utilization [55]. The observed
reduction in starch hydrolysis during the later stages of
germination raises the possibility that continued hydrolysis of a-amylase-hydrolyzed glucans is hindered in the
sbe1a mutant. The altered carbon metabolism could
then cause a deficiency in general plant growth characteristics such as coleoptile length [23]. The structural
analysis of sbe1a starch suggests that the decreased
starch utilization of sbe1a seeds is due to an altered
starch branching pattern.
Consideration of SBEI Function in the Context of
Pleiotropic Effects

Differences in SBE activity in sbe mutants could be simply due to the amount of a remaining SBE isoform or to
biochemical or physical interactions that modulate the
activities of an isoform; for the latter possibility SBEI
may be regulated through complex interactions with
other starch synthetic enzymes. Colleoni et al [21]
showed that two migratory forms of SBEI are missing in
maize endosperm of the maize ae mutant, indicating a
possible interaction of SBEI and SBEIIb. Seo et al. [24]
found that when SBEs were heterologously expressed in
a yeast system, SBEIIa and/or SBEIIb appear to act
before SBEI on synthesizing glucan structure. The studies of Yao et al. [25,26] suggest that in the absence of
SBEIIb, a reciprocal inhibition exists between SBEI and
SBEIIa, and that the presence of either SBEI or SBEIIa

Page 8 of 13

increases amylopectin branching as opposed to the presence of SBEI and SBEIIa together.
Direct evidence for protein-protein interactions
between SBEs and different members of all the proteins
involved in starch biosynthesis has also been reported
by several groups, based on co-immunoprecipitation and
affinity purification methods. Tetlow et al. [27] reported
that SBEI from wheat amyloplasts was present in a high
molecular weight complex with starch phosphorylase
and SBEIIb. A separate study [56] using maize amyloplasts showed that eliminating SBEIIb caused significant
increases in the abundance of SBEI, BEIIa, SSIII, and
starch phosphorylase in the granule, without affecting
SSI or SSIIa. Hennen-Bierwagen [30] reported that SBEI
and SSI were shown to interact in one of three independent methods tested; SBEI did not interact with any of
the other proteins in their study (SSIIa, SSIII, SBEIIa,
SBEIIb), and unlike the other five proteins in their
study, SBEI was the only protein to exist as a monomer
in gel permeation chromatography.
In present study, the sbe1a mutant line is nearly isogenic with the Wt control. Most if not all mutant phenotypes are likely the result of many effects, direct and
indirect, on the overall growth, development and physiology of the plant, so it is impossible to truly isolate a
primary effect of the mutation when looking at a whole
plant level phenotype, even the starch structure phenotype. Modifying SBE activity may induce modifications
in the distribution of phosphate groups within amylopectin such as in potato [57,58]. This may alter accessibility of amylase (a or b) to its substrate and may
induce differences in digestibility. Nonetheless, there is
value in observing and characterizing the phenotype of
these plants, both at the macro and molecular levels as
we have presented. We have a sister paper [36] which
does investigate the effect of various SBE mutations on
leaf starch which further sheds light on the SBEI function in the context of pleiotropic consequences.
Evolution and Function of Maize SBEI Isoform in Starch
Biosynthesis

This work for the first time reports a specific and
unique function for SBEI during the life cycle of maize.
Molecular structure analysis suggests an important function of SBEI in modulating the branching pattern in
normal starch by decreasing local clustering of amylopectin branch points. Thompson [59] emphasized the
non-random nature of the distribution of branch points
in starch. A specific type of non-random branching pattern may be required to optimize both storage and
hydrolysis. It is reasonable to hypothesize that alteration
in the specific non-random branching pattern could lead
to an altered granule organization, rendering it more or

Xia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/95

less favorable to the plant for storage and/or for enzyme
hydrolysis during utilization. Our data from in vitro
starch digestibility and from plant germination analysis
support this hypothesis.
Gene duplication and neo-functionalization are well
known mechanisms by which specific genes can evolve
to express different isoforms of enzymes with slightly
specialized expression patterns or different enzymatic
activities [60-62]. With the evidence from current and
previous work, we can infer that an ancestral Sbe gene
has duplicated at least twice during the evolution of
maize, and these evolved to express three different SBE
isoforms with highly specific functions in starch biosynthesis. A detailed phylogenetic analysis of the
branching enzymes was published by Deschamps et al.
[14]. This work demonstrated that genes belonging to
both the SBEI and SBEII families can be identified in
the green alga, which supports the theory that these two
families of genes evolved approximately a billion years
ago based on phylogenetic estimates of the divergence
between the Chlorophyta and Magnolippyta lineages
(estimates range from 729-1210 million years ago)
[63,64]. This example of extreme evolutionary conservation is strong evidence for a specific and vital role for
each enzyme isoform in starch biosynthesis. While most
plant species studied retain genes representing each subfamily of SBE, Arabidopsis does not, suggesting that
somewhere in the lineage leading to Arabidopsis, the
gene was lost with minimal consequences to the species
[65].
The evidence presented in this work strongly supports
the hypothesis that SBEI is required to synthesize endosperm starch granules that allow normal hydrolysis and
utilization during germination. Considering plant survival in the wild, optimal seedling vigor would be a strong
evolutionary force to select for genotypes of plants with
starch granules optimized for molecular structure that
would lead to efficient storage and utilization. The
reduced seedling vigor of sbe1a mutant seeds observed
in this work provides powerful evidence for a specialized
and important role of SBEI in plant development, consistent with the evolutionary conservation of SBEI in all
higher plants.

Conclusions
This work for the first time reports that a lack of SBEI
activity resulted in an observable effect, which was seen
on both starch molecular structure and starch function.
Structural and functional analysis of endosperm starch
deficient in SBEI activity strongly supports the hypothesis that SBEI is required to synthesize starch granules
for normal kernel development, allowing efficient hydrolysis and utilization.

Page 9 of 13

Evidence from this work reveals a unique and essential
function of SBEI in normal plant development, consistent with the evolutionary conservation of SBEI in all
higher plants.
The new knowledge generated in this work will contribute to our understanding of the function and evolution of the maize SBEs, and of their roles in the
biosynthesis, hydrolysis and utilization of starch granules. Moreover, the novel sbe1a starch might have application as a food ingredient with nutritional benefit.

Methods
Starch Material

Maize plants of Wt and sbe1a mutant were grown during summer, 2007 at Penn State Horticultural Research
Farm (Rock Springs, PA). In order to compare starch
material within a highly similar genetic background,
homozygous Sbe1a/Sbe1a (i.e. Wt) and sbe1a/sbe1a
mutant siblings were identified from a single segregating
population derived from seeds of selfed Sbe1a/sbe1a
plants to obtain ears for endosperm analysis. Genotyping of Wt and sbe1a mutant plants followed Blauth et
al. [37]. The detected homozygous Wt and sbe1a
mutant plants were self-pollinated to produce ears for
endosperm analysis, and are segregated from a BC4 F3
population backcrossed by Blauth et al. [11,37]. Starch
extraction from three different ears, considered as three
biological replications, for each genotype, was according
to Yao et al. [66]. Starch fractionation followed Klucinec
and Thompson [67].
b-Amylolysis of Amylopectin and Debranching of bDextrins

b-Dextrins were prepared by the method of Xia and
Thompson [40] with slight modifications in sample
size. Amylopectin samples (48 mg) were dispersed in
480 μL of 90% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by heating
in a boiling water bath for 10 min. To the dispersion,
warm sodium acetate buffer (3.52 mL, 50°C 0.02M,
pH 6.0) was added. The mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min and cooled to 50°C. A 200μL aliquot of a b-amylase (from barley, Cat.No. EBARBL; Megazyme International Ireland, Ltd.) solution (250 U/mL, 0.02M sodium acetate, pH 6.0) was
added, and the samples were incubated at 50°C with
constant agitation (200 strokes/min). At approximately
10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h, a 0.5-mL aliquot of sample was removed and heated in a boiling
water bath for 10 min to stop the reaction. The procedures for precipitating b-dextrins and debranching bdextrins by successive action of isoamylase (from
Pseudomonas sp., Cat.No. E-ISAMY; Megazyme) and
pullulanase (from Klebsiella planticola, Cat.No. E-

Xia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/95

PULKP; Megazyme) were the same as used previously
for b-LDs) [39,40].
Preparation of Isoamylase-Debranched and Isoamylase
plus Pullulanase-Debranched b-Limit Dextrins from
Amylose Fractions

The preparation and debranching of b-LDs followed the
procedures in Klucinec and Thompson [39] with slight
modifications in sample size. After the b-LDs were debranched with isoamylase for 24 h, a 30-μL aliquot of the
digested solution was added to 270 μL of DMSO and
reserved for analysis by high-performance size-exclusion
chromatography (HPSEC). Then the b-LDs were further
debranched with pullulanase for 24 h, afterwards
another 30-μL aliquot of the digested solution was
added to 270 μL of DMSO for HPSEC analysis [40].
Resistant Starch Determination

The official method for in vitro RS determination
(AOAC 2002.02, AACC 32-40) was employed, which
was scaled-down and modified for direct analysis of the
digestion supernatant for total carbohydrate [41]. The
modification allowed analysis of digestion time-course
for small starch samples (~20 mg). For RS determination, after the 16 h digestion step at 37°C with porcine
pancreatic a-amylase and amyloglucosidase (enzymes
from RS Assay Kit, Cat.No. K-RSTAR, Megazyme), the
sample tube was removed from the water bath and to
an aliquot of each sample was added 1 volume of 95%
(v/v) ethanol with 0.5% (w/v) EDTA. After centrifugation (1,500 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was analyzed
in duplicate for total carbohydrate using the phenol sulfuric acid method [68]. The percent non-digested starch
(% NDS) was calculated from this data and was the
basis for the calculation of the RS value. Starch isolated
from Wt and sbe1a mutant endospermes from three
separate plants (triplicate biological replications) were
subjected to triplicate pancreatic a-amylase digestion,
for determining the RS values.
Digestion Time-Course Analysis

For determination of digestion time-course, the starch
samples were digested as described above. An aliquot
was removed at approximately 30 sec, 3 min, 6 min, 15
min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 7 h, 10 h, 13 h, and
twice at 16 h, and added to 1 volume of ethanol/EDTA
solution to ensure immediate deactivation of the
enzymes. After centrifugation the supernatants were
analyzed for total carbohydrate as described above.
Digestion time-course was analyzed following the
method developed by Rees [42] to obtain kinetic data. A
“Double, 5 parameter” regression model in SigmaPlot
(Systat Software, Inc.) was selected to fit the data using
the double exponential decay equation:

Page 10 of 13

y = y0 + S1 e−k1 x + S2 e−k2 x

where y is % NDS, x is the time, y0 is the y-value that
the model asymptotically approaches, S1 and S2 are the
concentrations of the two different substrate components, and k1 and k2 are the reaction rate constants for
the decay of the two different components. The units
for y0, S1, and S2 were % of initial starch, and the units
for the rate constants were min -1 . After running the
regression program, the software gives three possible
completion status messages depending on how well the
model fits the data:
(1) Converged, tolerance satisfied.
(2) Converged, tolerance satisfied. Parameter may
not be valid. Array numerically singular on final
iteration.
(3) Didn’t converge, exceeded maximum number of
iterations.
The data were kept for further regression analysis if
message 1 or 2 resulted, and were discarded if message
3 resulted.
Digestion time-course analysis was performed for
three biological replications per genotype. For each biological replication, two technical replications were performed. If both sets of data “converged” using the
model (message 1 or 2), no further analyses were performed. If message 3 appeared, a new technical replication was done until the data “converged.” The data from
the two “converged” technical replications for each biological replication were combined, and the software program was run on the combined data. For all samples,
the regression model fit for the combined data completed with convergence (Message 1), and generated
valid parameters for analysis. Using the combined data,
values for five parameters in the equation were determined for each biological replication. A mean and standard deviation of the five parameters for each genotype
was then calculated, and comparisons among genotypes
were made by one-way ANOVA analysis.
Light Microscopy

Bright field and polarized light microscopy were performed using a light microscope (BX51; Olympus) with
an attached digital camera (Spot II RT; Diagnostic
Instruments). 5 mg of native starch sample was mixed
with 0.5 mL of deionized water in a micro-centrifuge
tube. For the resistant starch samples, the supernatant
was removed after centrifugation of digestion solution
and 20 μL of deionized water was added to the pellets
to disperse the sample. To examine the sample under
the microscope, 20 μL of the dispersed sample was
added to a glass slide, and a cover slip was fixed over

Xia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/95

the sample with fingernail polish. Examination of iodinestained starch followed the method in Evans and
Thompson [54]. 20 μL of iodine solution (0.08% I 2 ,
0.12% KI) was placed onto 20 μL of the dispersed sample to give a final I2 concentration of 0.04%. In order to
compare birefringence between granules, the camera’s
automatic exposure function was turned off, and the
exposure was set the same for all samples. The same
sample field was examined under bright field and polarized light.
Heterogeneity of iodine staining was evaluated quantitatively by a volunteer panel. Differentially iodinestained starch granules were classified into two categories, dark or light stained granules, and were sorted
visually by five individual evaluators who were not
otherwise involved in the research. The evaluators were
trained to understand the difference between dark and
light stained granules, by observing granules in a portion
of a micrograph for sbe1a granules. Four micrographs
for each genotype (Wt or sbe1a) were used for sorting.
The evaluators were then given those eight micrographs,
unlabeled and in randomized order, and asked to sort
the granules into two categories. The proportion of dark
granules for each micrograph was calculated based on
the sorting results from all five evaluators, and a mean
proportion was obtained for each micrograph. For each
genotype, a mean was calculated from the means of the
four micrographs. Comparison between two genotypes
was made by one-way ANOVA.

incubation period. To measure the amount of endosperm starch remaining, the roots, coleoptiles, embryo,
and pericarps were removed from 2 kernels at days 1, 6,
8, and 11. The remaining endosperm was ground with a
mortar and pestle on ice. The powered tissue was
washed into a tube with deionized water and homogenized with a Tissumizer (Model SDT 1810; Tekmar) at
20,000 rpm for 1 min. The ground tissue was washed
with deionized water, centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10
min, and suspended in 3 mL of deionized water. For calculating the dry weight of samples, 1 mL of this suspension was dried at 70°C overnight and weighed. The
remaining 2 mL of the suspension was boiled for 30
min, and the total glucan polysaccharide in the solubilized solution was quantified in triplicates, using a commercial assay kit that measures glucose released after
digestion with a-amylase and amyloglucosidase (Cat.No.
K-TSTA; Megazyme). The quantified starch content was
normalized against the dry weight for comparison
between genotypes.

Scanning Electron Microscopy

A thin layer of starch sample was applied to doublesided sticky carbon tape on a specimen stub, and sputter-coated with 10 nm Au/Pd (BAL-TEC SCD 050; USTechnoTrade). Samples were then examined using a
scanning electron microscope (JSM-5400; JEOL Ltd.) at
an accelerating voltage of 20 keV and at different magnification levels (1,500 ×, 3,500 ×, and 10,000 ×). For
image collection, lower magnification was first employed
to examine the whole view of samples, and higher magnification was then used to focus on sample areas that
were representative overall.

Kernel Germination Assay

A kernel germination assay was performed according to
the method in Dinges et al. [23] with slight modifications. Mature, dried maize kernels were surface-sterilized by immersion in 15 mL of 1% sodium hypochlorite
for 5 min and then washed three times with deionized
water. 15 kernels from each of three ears for each genotype were placed in Petri dishes containing three layers
of moist Whatman paper and incubated at 30°C in the
dark. The length of each coleoptile was measured by a
ruler on successive days throughout the 11-day
