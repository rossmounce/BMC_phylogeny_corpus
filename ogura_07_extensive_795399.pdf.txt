Extensive genomic diversity and selective conservation of
virulence-determinants in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
strains of O157 and non-O157 serotypes

Abstract
refereed research

Background: Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157 causes severe food-borne illness in
humans. The chromosome of O157 consists of 4.1 Mb backbone sequences shared by benign E. coli K-12,
and 1.4 Mb O157-specific sequences encoding many virulence determinants, such as Shiga toxin genes (stx
genes) and the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Non-O157 EHECs belonging to distinct clonal
lineages from O157 also cause similar illness in humans. According to the 'parallel' evolution model, they
have independently acquired the major virulence determinants, the stx genes and LEE. However, the
genomic differences between O157 and non-O157 EHECs have not yet been systematically analyzed.
Results: Using microarray and whole genome PCR scanning analyses, we performed a whole genome
comparison of 20 EHEC strains of O26, O111, and O103 serotypes with O157. In non-O157 EHEC
strains, although genome sizes were similar with or rather larger than O157 and the backbone regions
were well conserved, O157-specific regions were very poorly conserved. Around only 20% of the O157specific genes were fully conserved in each non-O157 serotype. However, the non-O157 EHECs
contained a significant number of virulence genes that are found on prophages and plasmids in O157, and
also multiple prophages similar to, but significantly divergent from, those in O157.

interactions

Conclusion: Although O157 and non-O157 EHECs have independently acquired a huge amount of
serotype- or strain-specific genes by lateral gene transfer, they share an unexpectedly large number of
virulence genes. Independent infections of similar but distinct bacteriophages carrying these virulence
determinants are deeply involved in the evolution of O157 and non-O157 EHECs.

Background

Escherichia coli is a commensal intestinal inhabitant of vertebrates and rarely cause diseases except in compromised
hosts. Several types of strains, however, cause diverse intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases in healthy humans and animals by means of individually acquired virulence factors [1].
Enterohemorragic E. coli (EHEC) is one of the most devastating pathogenic E. coli, which can cause diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis with life-threatening complications, such as
hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [2]. Shiga toxin (Stx) is
the key virulence factor responsible for the induction of hemorrhagic colitis with such complications [3]. In addition, typical EHEC strains possess a pathogenicity island called 'the
locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)', which encodes a set of
proteins constituting type III secretion system (T3SS)
machinery. The LEE also encodes several effector proteins
secreted by the T3SS, and an adhesin called intimin (encoded
by the eaeA gene). The system confers on the bacteria the
ability to induce attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on the
host colonic epithelial cells, enabling it to colonize tightly at
the lesions [4]. The LEE has also been found in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), which cause severe diarrhea in infants,
and in several other animal pathogens, including Citrobacter
rodentium and rabbit EPEC [5,6]. It is also known that EHEC
strains harbor a large plasmid encoding several virulence factors, such as enterohemolysin [2].
Our previous genome sequence comparison of O157:H7
strain RIMD 0509952 (referred to as O157 Sakai) with the
benign laboratory strain K-12 MG1655 revealed that the O157
Sakai chromosome is composed of 4.1 Mb sequences conserved in K-12, and 1.4 Mb sequences absent from K-12
(referred to as the backbone and S-loops, respectively) [7,8].
Importantly, most of the large S-loops are prophages and
prophage-like elements, and O157 Sakai contains 18
prophages (Sp1-Sp18) and 6 prophage-like elements (SpLE1SpLE6; these elements contain phage integrase-like genes but
no other phage-related genes). These Sps and SpLEs carry
most of the virulence-related genes of O157, including the stx
genes (stx1AB on Sp15 and stx2AB on Sp5). The LEE pathogenicity island corresponds to SpLE4. Of particular importance is that, in addition to 7 LEE-encoded effectors, 32
proteins encoded in non-LEE loci have been identified as
effectors secreted by LEE-encoded T3SS (non-LEE effectors)
[9-15]. Among these, TccP has already been shown to play a
pivotal role for the induction of A/E lesions in EHEC [16,17].
Others are also suspected to be involved in EHEC pathogenesis. Nearly all of these non-LEE effectors are encoded on the
Sps and SpLEs [15].
We have recently performed a whole genome comparison of
eight O157 strains by whole genome PCR scanning (WGPScanning) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
using O157 oligoDNA microarray analysis [18,19]. These
analyses revealed that O157 strains are significantly divergent
in the genomic structure and gene repertoire. In particular,

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R138

Sp and SpLE regions exhibit remarkable diversity. We identified about 400 genes that are variably present in the O157
strains. They include several virulence-related genes, suggesting that some level of strain-to-strain variations in the
potential virulence exist among O157 strains.
Although numerous EHEC outbreaks have been attributed to
strains of the O157 serotype (O157 EHEC), it has increasingly
been more frequently recognized that EHEC strains belonging to a wide range of other serotypes also cause similar gastrointestinal diseases in humans. Among these non-O157
EHECs, O26, O111, and O103 are the serotypes most frequently associated with human illness in many countries
[20]. By multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) of housekeeping genes, Reid et al. [21] have shown that these non-O157
EHEC strains belong to clonal groups distinct from O157
EHEC. Based on this finding, they proposed a 'parallel' evolution model of EHEC; each EHEC lineage has independently
acquired the same major virulence factors, stx, LEE, and plasmid-encoded enterohemolysin [21]. However, our knowledge
on the prevalence of virulence factors among non-O157 EHEC
strains is very limited. Many other virulence factors found on
the O157 genome, such as fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesins, iron uptake systems, and non-LEE effectors, are also
thought to be required for the full virulence of EHEC, but
their prevalence among non-O157 EHEC strains has not yet
been systematically analyzed. Differences (or conservation)
in the genomic structure between O157 and non-O157 EHEC
strains are also yet to be determined.
In this study, we selected 20 non-O157 EHEC strains, 8 of
which belong to O26, six to O111, and six to O103 serotypes,
and performed a whole genome comparison with O157 EHEC
strains by O157 oligoDNA microarray and WGPScanning.
Our data indicate that the backbone regions are highly conserved also in non-O157 EHEC strains, while most S-loops are
very poorly conserved. Among the genes on S-loops, only
8.5% were detected in all the EHEC strains examined, and
around 20% were fully conserved in each non-O157 serotype.
Besides, we found that the genome sizes of non-O157 EHEC
strains are similar or rather larger than those of O157 strains,
indicating that non-O157 EHEC strains have a huge amount
of serotype- or strain-specific genes. Interestingly, virulencerelated genes, particularly those for non-LEE effectors and
non-fimbrial adhesions, were relatively well conserved in the
non-O157 EHEC strains.

Results
Phylogeny and other features of non-O157 EHEC
strains
EHEC strains used in this study were isolated from patients in
Japan, Italy, or France (Table 1). The XbaI digestion patterns
examined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed
that the genomic DNA of EHEC strains is significantly divergent (Additional data file 1), while all possess stx1 and/or stx2

information

Chromosome sizes and plasmid profiles

Plasmid profiles indicated that all but one O157 strain contain
one large plasmid of a similar size (Table 2; Additional data
file 3). All of the non-O157 EHEC strains also contained at
least one large plasmid except for O26 strain 1 (one small
plasmid was present) and O103 strain 2 (no plasmid was
detected). Several O26 and O111 strains possessed two or
three large plasmids. The estimated total genome sizes of
EHEC strains ranged from 5.27 Mb to 6.21 Mb.

interactions

The MLST analysis using seven housekeeping genes (aspC,
clpX, fadD, icdA, lysP, mdh, and uidA) indicated that strains
belonging to the O157, O26, O111, and O103 serotypes were
clustered into three different phylogenic groups (O26 and
O111 strains were clustered together; Additional data file 2).
This result is basically consistent with those from previous
MLST analyses using different genetic loci [21,23]. The type
of intimin was classified as γ1, β1, γ2, and ε for O157, O26,
O111, and O103, respectively.

Because I-CeuI specifically cleaves a 19 base-pair sequence in
the 23S ribosomal RNA gene, it demonstrated that these
strains have seven copies of the ribosomal operon (rrn), as in
K-12 and O157. Estimated chromosome sizes of these strains
were all much larger than that of K-12, with diverged sizes
ranging from 5,102 to 5,945 kb (Table 2). O111 and O103
strains contained slightly smaller chromosomes than O157
strains. In contrast, most O26 strains contained relatively
larger chromosomes. We could not estimate the chromosome
sizes in two O157 strains (2 and 9) and one O103 strain (4),
because all or the largest fragments repeatedly exhibited
smear patterns.

genes, and the eaeA gene encoding intimin (see 'Detection
and subtyping of stx and eaeA genes' in Materials and methods). The results of the fluorescent actin staining (FAS) assay
[22] indicated that all strains are potentially capable of inducing A/E lesions except for O111 strain 1. The efficiency, however, somewhat varied from strain-to-strain (data not
shown).

Overview of the CGH analysis of non-O157 EHEC

O157 Sakai contains many repeated genes (542 out of 5,447
genes), such as transposase- and phage-related genes. They
can be grouped into 151 families. Compared with the singleton genes, the repeated gene families were relatively well conserved in non-O157 EHECs. About half of the 'conserved in K12' repeated gene families (11 out of the 23 families (47.8%))
were fully conserved in all the test strains, and 81 (63.3%), 74
(57.8%), 60 (46.9%), and 77 (60.2%) out of the 128 'Sakaispecific' repeated gene families were fully conserved in O157,
O26, O111, and O103, respectively (Figure 3; Additional data
file 4). Because most of the repeated genes were from lambdalike prophages and IS elements [8,18], this result indicates
that non-O157 EHEC strains also contain multiple lambdalike prophages and IS elements very similar to those found in
O157 Sakai.

We analyzed the gene contents of non-O157 EHEC strains by
using the O157 oligoDNA microarray, and compared the
results with those of O157 strains in our previous report [18]
(Figures 1 and 2). More Sakai genes were absent from the
non-O157 EHEC strains. In O157 strains, the absent genes
were found mostly in Sp and SpLE regions, but in non-O157
EHEC strains, they were found not only in Sp and SpLE
regions but also in various S-loops. The conservation tended
to exhibit a serotype-specific pattern, but remarkable strainto-strain diversity was also observed in each serotype.

Among the 3,651 'conserved in K-12' singleton genes, 224
(6.1%) were absent in at least one test strain. These genes
were found to be absent more frequently in non-O157 EHEC
strains than in O157 strains: 75 genes (2.1%) in O26 strains,
184 (5.0%) in O111, and 61 (1.7%) in O103, while only 37
(1.0%) in O157 (here we counted only the genes that were
judged as 'absent' in at least one strain; therefore, these
results do not include the genes that were 'uncertain' in some
strains but 'absent' in no strain). These genes were dispersed
on the chromosome and belonged to various functional categories (Additional data file 5); but as expected, none of them
was listed as essential, either in the 'profiling of E. coli chromosome' (PEC) database [24] or in a systematic single-gene
deletion study of E. coli K-12 [25]. We also identified 46, 83,
and 30 'conserved in K-12' singleton genes that are fully
absent in O26, O111, and O103, respectively. Among these, 22
genes, which are located in 12 different chromosomal loci,
were absent in all non-O157 EHEC strains, and 10, 44, and 3
genes were specifically missing in O26, O111, and O103,
respectively.

interactions

We categorized 'Sakai-specific' singleton genes according to
the COG (clusters of orthologous groups of proteins) classification [26], and analyzed the gene conservation of each functional category (Figure 4). In O157, most genes were well
conserved in all categories. Many genes for 'replication,
recombination and repair' and for 'transcription' were variably present among O157 strains, but most of them were on Sps
and SpLEs. In the non-O157 serotypes, however, the 'Sakaispecific' singleton genes belonging to almost every COG functional category exhibited poor conservation (many were classified as 'Fully absent'). The level of conservation was similar
to that observed for the four sequenced pathogenic E. coli
strains of different pathotypes [27-30] (Additional data file
4).

refereed research

Among the 4,905 singleton genes, 101 were categorized as
'partly conserved in K-12' genes. They included 81 genes that
are encoded on the backbone and 20 genes on S-loops or
backbone/S-loop junctions. In O157, all but 5 (95.0%) of the
'partly conserved in K-12' genes were fully conserved. In nonO157 EHECs, however, many 'partly conserved in K-12' genes
were categorized as 'uncertain' (7 to 42 genes in each nonO157 EHEC strain, 28 genes on average), because only one of
the two probes yielded positive results. Therefore, only 44
(43.6%), 40 (39.6%), and 58 (57.4%) were fully conserved in
O26, O111, and O103, respectively (Figure 3; Additional data
file 4). This result suggests that most of the 'partly conserved
in K-12' genes are present in the non-O157 EHEC strains but
many have significantly divergent sequences from those of
O157 Sakai.

Absent 'conserved in K-12' genes in EHEC strains

deposited research

'Conserved in K-12' singleton genes were highly conserved in
all serotypes: 3,596 (98.5%), 3,450 (94.5%), 3,331 (91.2%),
and 3,542 (97.0%) out of 3,651 genes were fully conserved in
O157, O26, O111 and O103, respectively, and 3,240 (88.7%) in
all the test strains (Figure 3; Additional data file 4). 'Sakaispecific' singleton genes were relatively well conserved in
O157 strains, but very poorly in non-O157 EHEC strains: 741
(64.3%), 221 (19.2%), 300 (26.0%), and 231 (20.0%) out of
1,153 genes were fully conserved in O157, O26, O111, and
O103, respectively. Only 98 (8.5%) were conserved in all the
test strains.

reports

To more precisely analyze the CGH data, we categorized the
Sakai genes into three groups [18]. Since most Sakai genes
were represented by two oligonucleotide probes in our microarray, we first classified the probes into two groups by their
homologies to the K-12 genome sequence; those with ≥90%
identity into 'conserved in K-12' probes and others into
'Sakai-specific' probes. Each gene was then classified into
'conserved in K-12' genes, 'partly conserved in K-12' genes
(genes represented by one 'conserved in K-12' probe and one
'Sakai-specific' probe), or 'Sakai-specific' genes. Repeated
gene families that occurred in O157 Sakai more than once
were analyzed separately from singleton genes (see Materials
and methods for details on the classification and the presence
or absence determination).

interactions

LEE is a T3SS-encoding pathogenicity island (SpLE4 in O157
Sakai) acquired by lateral gene transfer (LGT). Although LEE
has been found in various EHEC and EPEC strains, they are
genetically divergent. Based on the sequence polymorphism
of the eaeA gene encoding intimin, 28 alleles have been identified so far [34]. Although the core regions of each type of
LEE encode nearly the same set of genes, their DNA
sequences are known to be significantly divergent. For example, the sequence identity of the LEE core region between
O157 Sakai (intimin γ1) and the O26:NM strain 413/89-1
(intimin β1) (accession number: AJ277443) is around 93% on
average, and that between O157 Sakai and the O103:H2 strain
RW1374 (intimin ε) [35] (accession number: AJ303141) is
also 93%. In our CGH analysis, many probes for LEE core
genes exhibited reduced signal intensities, just below borderline for presence/absence calls in all the non-O157 EHEC
strains, and thus many LEE core genes were judged as
'absent' (Table 4). This indicates that the core genes of the
non-O157 EHEC strains, which include seven LEE-encoded
effector genes, also have significantly diverged nucleotide
sequences.

refereed research

In the COG classification, many of the virulence-related genes
were classified into the 'not in COGs' category. We thus
picked up all the known or suspected O157 virulence-related
genes, and analyzed their conservation in non-O157 EHECs.
Fimbria are important for virulence as an initial attachment
factors to the host intestine. The O157 Sakai genome
contained 14 fimbrial biosynthesis gene clusters (loci 1 to 14),
all of which were completely conserved in every O157 strain
except for strain 8, in which locus 11 was partially conserved
(Table 3). Among the 14 clusters, four (loci 3, 5, 7, and 14)
were completely conserved in K-12 and three (loci 1, 8, and 11)
partially conserved. These seven loci were also completely or
partially conserved in the non-O157 EHEC strains, suggesting
that these gene clusters are widely conserved in various E. coli
strains irrespective of their pathotypes. Genes on the remaining seven loci were almost completely absent in all non-O157
serotypes. Only loci 9 and 10 were partially conserved in sev-

Iron uptake systems are also important for bacterial survival
in host environments. O157 Sakai contains seven gene clusters for iron uptake. All were conserved in every O157 strain
except for strains 4 and 7, where locus 4 was missing (Table
5). In non-O157 EHECs, although three clusters common
with K-12 were present in all strains, another four clusters
were completely missing.

deposited research

Distribution of O157 Sakai virulence-related genes in
non-O157 EHECs

In addition to the fimbrial genes, 14 Sakai genes have been
demonstrated or suspected to encode non-fimbrial adhesins
(Table 4). They were relatively well conserved in the nonO157 EHEC strains. 'Regulators' and 'Toxins and their activators' showed similar levels of conservation as the genes
related to adhesion (Table 4).

reports

SpLE1 carries gene clusters for urease (ECs1321-1327) and
tellurite resistance (ECs1343, 1351-1358). In an earlier report,
the urease genes were found specifically associated with
EHEC strains irrespective of their serotypes [33]. Our present
data, however, demonstrate that five EHEC strains (one
O157, one O26, and three O103 strains) lack the urease genes.
The tellurite resistance genes were also well conserved in
non-O157 EHECs but absent in one O26 and two O103
strains.

eral non-O157 EHEC strains. Thus, we may regard them as
O157-specifc fimbrial gene clusters.

reviews

A relatively large number of genes for 'carbohydrate transport
and metabolism' were fully conserved in non-O157 EHECs.
Among these, genes for the sugar ABC transporter system
(ECs0374-0378), and the N-acetylgalactosamine-specific
PTS system (ECs4013-4014), and two genes for sugar utilization (ECs3242: fructokinase and ECs3243: sucrose-6 phosphate hydrolase) were conserved in all the tested strains. A
relatively large number of genes for the 'cell wall/membrane
biogenesis' category were also fully conserved. Most of them
were the genes for lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis
(ECs2831 and ECs2836-2845). This is consistent with the fact
that four serotypes examined here share the same core type
(R3) [31,32].

highly variable conservation patterns in the non-O157 EHEC

profiles, all the pO157 genes except for an IS-related gene
were absent in O26 strain 1 and O103 strain 2, in which no
large plasmid was detected (Table 2; Additional data file 3).

singleton genes on the O157 Sakai genome, 3,651 were categorized as
'conserved in K-12', 101 as 'partly conserved in K-12', and 1,153 as 'Sakaispecific'. Among the 151 repeated gene families, 23 were categorized as
'conserved in K-12' and 128 as 'Sakai-specific'. Genes that were judged as
'present' in all the tested strains were categorized as 'Fully conserved'
genes, those judged as 'absent' in all the strains as 'Fully absent' genes, and
others as 'Variably absent or present' genes. In the CGH analysis, because
repeated gene families with reduced copy numbers were often judged as
'absent', all the repeated gene families judged as 'absent' were categorized
as 'uncertain'. See Additional data file 4 for further details.

Symbols: '+' indicates a locus where all genes were conserved; '-' a locus where all genes were absent; and 'P' a locus where one or more genes, but
not all genes, were absent. Genes judged as 'uncertain' were not considered.

(Table 4). The ecf operon (ecf1 to ecf4), encoding a lipid A
modification system that has recently been found to be
related to colonization of bovine intestine [37], was also well
conserved in the non-O157 EHEC strains.

Comparative analysis of genomic structures in EHEC
strains by WGPScanning
Although the gene composition of each strain can be easily
analyzed by CGH, it does not provide positional information,
such as strain-specific translocations and strain-specific
insertions. To obtain more details on the genomic differences
between O157 and non-O157 EHECs, we analyzed the nonO157 EHEC strains by WGPScanning, and compared the
results with earlier information on O157 strains [19] (Figures
1 and 2). Remarkable structural variations had been found
mainly in Sp and SpLE regions in the O157 strains. In the nonO157 EHEC strains, Sp and SpLE regions exhibited much
higher levels of structural change, and various other chromosomal loci containing S-loops also showed remarkable structural alterations. Because the PCR products obtained from
most of these loci were reduced in size, we consider that Sloops have been deleted. This supposition is in good agreement with the CGH data.
We were able to obtain PCR products rarely from most Sp and
SpLE regions in the non-O157 EHEC strains. Only SpLE1 and
Sp10 regions of a few non-O157 EHEC strains yielded PCR
products from their entire regions, indicating that only these
strains contained genetic elements closely related to SpLE1
and Sp10 at the same loci as in Sakai. At other Sp- and SpLEintegration sites, it is likely that no insertion exists or different types of genomic elements have been inserted. We per-

formed further PCR analyses to confirm this, using primer
pairs targeting the flanking regions of each Sp and SpLE. We
obtained PCR products from many Sp and SpLE loci through
this analysis, and the results suggest that no large insertions
exist at these loci (indicated by blank areas in Figures 1 and 2).
At the remaining sites, it appears that large inserts different
from those of O157 Sakai have been integrated. Of interest
was the finding that no PCR product was obtained for many
genes detected by the CGH analysis on the Sp and SpLE loci
(see the Sp4 region of Figure 1 as an example). These results
indicate that non-O157 EHEC strains also contain Sp- and
SpLE-like elements, which are structurally and/or positionally highly divergent from those in O157 Sakai.
In non-prophage regions, a number of segments (49 in total)
were again not amplified by PCR, suggesting that these loci
contain large insertions or some other types of genomic rearrangements (indicated by arrowheads in Figures 1 and 2). In
these regions, we identified several alternative integration
sites for LEEs and Stx phages, as described in the next
section.
Although a significant number of pO157 genes were detected
in the CGH analysis, pO157-targeted primer pairs yielded no
PCR product in all the non-O157 EHEC strains with a single
exception (a small segment in one O26 strain; Figures 1 and
2). This indicates that plasmids harbored by non-O157 EHEC
strains are highly divergent from pO157 in structure.

Integration sites of Stx phages and LEE islands
All the non-O157 EHEC strains examined in this study carried
Stx phage(s) and the LEE. The results of WGPScanning anal-

*Conservation of O157 Sakai virulence genes in four sequenced pathogenic E. coli strains was determined according to the results of homology search using the BLASTP
program. The threshold for presence (+) or absence (-) determination was ≥90% sequence identity and ≥50% aligned length coverage of a query sequence. † Genes conserved
in all strains are indicated by brackets in bold, and those absent only in one strain by parentheses in bold.

yses, however, implied that their integration sites are different from those in O157 Sakai (Figures 1 and 2). We thus
searched for integration sites of these elements in the nonO157 EHEC strains. We first searched for LEE integration
sites by long PCR using primer pairs, one targeting eaeA and
the other the flanking regions of known LEE integration sites.
This analysis revealed that LEEs are located at the pheU locus
in all O26 strains and the pheV locus in all O111 and O103
strains (Figure 5a).
Although Stx1 and Stx2 phages are integrated into the wrbA
and yehV genes, respectively, in the two sequenced O157
strains (Sakai and EDL933), several alternative integration
sites of Stx phages have been described in other O157 strains;
one site for Stx1 phage (sbcB) and two for Stx2 phages (sbcB
and yehV) [19]. The yecE locus has also been identified as an
integration site of the Stx2 phage in an ONT:H - strain [38].
We consecutively analyzed these sites of the non-O157 EHEC

strains by long PCR using primer pairs specific to stx1A (or
stx2A) and each of these integration sites. We could find Stx1
phages at the wrbA locus in only seven O26 strains (1 to 7)
and a Stx2 phage at the yecE locus in only one O111 strain
(strain 2) (Figure 5a). We then constructed fosmid libraries of
six EHEC strains (O157 strain 8, O26 strain 2, O111 strains 2
and 3, and O103 strains 1 and 5), and screened for stx1- or
stx2-containing clones. By this systematic screening, we identified four new integration sites (torS-torT intergenic region,
argW, ssrA, and prfC) for Stx phages. Based on this finding,
the long PCR strategy also enabled us to find the Stx1 phages
integrated at the torS-torT intergenic region in three O103
strains (2, 4, and 6) (Figure 5a). These results indicate that
Stx phages are extremely divergent not only in genomic structure but also in integration site among EHEC strains. DNA
sequences of these newly identified integration sites are
shown in Figure 5b-e).

Symbols: '+' indicates a locus where all genes were conserved; '-' a locus where all genes were absent. Genes judged as 'uncertain' were not considered.

The genome sizes of the non-O157 EHEC strains were similar
or rather larger than those of O157 strains (Table 2). The CGH
data, on the other hand, indicates that 83% of 4,905 singleton
genes and 78% of 151 repeated gene families (composed of

information

Selective conservation of pO157-associated virulence-related
genes in non-O157 EHECs is also intriguing. Most non-O157
EHEC strains contained one or two large plasmids, but their
structures were very different from pO157, and pO157 genes
other than virulence-related genes were very poorly conserved in non-O157 EHEC strains. (Figures 1 and 2; Table 4).
Although more information on the large plasmids of nonO157 EHECs is necessary, similar but significantly diverged
plasmids may have independently carried these virulencedeterminants into each EHEC lineage.

interactions

Interestingly, however, a significant number of virulencerelated genes, particularly those for non-LEE effectors and
non-fimbrial adhesins, were well conserved in the non-O157
EHEC strains (Table 4). All four sequenced extra-intestinal

Prophages in non-O157 EHEC strains are remarkably divergent in their structure and integration site from those in O157
Sakai. With respect to this, another important achievement of
this study is the identification of a set of alternative integration sites for prophages and other large genomic elements in
the non-O157 EHEC genomes (Figures 1 and 2). They include
those for the Stx phages and LEE islands (Figure 5).

refereed research

More than 1,600 O157 Sakai genes that are absent from K-12
encode a great variety of proteins, including various virulence
factors. Most of these 'Sakai-specific' genes are also absent
from four sequenced extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli
strains (Table 4; Additional data file 4), which belong to a different phylogenetic group (Additional data file 2). The highly
biased GC content of 'Sakai-specific' genes implies that most
of them have been acquired by LGT [8]. In fact, two-thirds of
the S-loops are prophages and prophage-like elements. Our
CGH analysis demonstrated a very poor conservation of
'Sakai-specific' genes in non-O157 EHECs: only 98 'Sakaispecific' singleton genes were conserved in all tested EHEC
strains (Figure 3; Additional data file 4). Among these, 16
genes were also present in all the sequenced extra-intestinal
pathogenic E. coli strains, indicating that they have been specifically deleted in the K-12 lineage.

pathogenic strains do not contain homologues of 31 non-LEE
effectors and 11 non-fimbrial adhesins that are absent in K-12,
except for three non-fimbrial adhesin genes (ECs0350,
Ecs0362, and ECs1360). It is thus assumed that these virulence-related genes were selectively acquired and retained in
multiple EHEC lineages like the genes for Stx, LEE, and
enterohemolysin. Most of these virulence genes are on
prophages, prophage-like elements, or the plasmid [8,15,44].
'Sakai-specific' repeated gene families derived from
prophages were also well conserved in the non-O157 EHEC
strains, suggesting that they contain multiple prophages similar to those of O157 Sakai. These results indicate that infection of similar bacteriophages is deeply involved in the
evolution of O157 and non-O157 EHEC lineages.

deposited research

A previous whole genome comparison of two E. coli strains,
K-12 and O157 Sakai, revealed that their chromosomes are
large mosaics of conserved core sequences and strain-specific
sequences [8]. Our present CGH analysis of O157 and nonO157 EHEC strains demonstrates that the core sequences are
also well conserved in the non-O157 EHEC strains. Although
the EHEC strains analyzed here were derived from three different clonal lineages, 3,240 out of 3,651 'conserved in K-12'
singleton genes and 11 out of 23 'conserved in K-12' repeated
gene families were perfectly conserved in all EHEC strains.
The number of 'E. coli core genes' proposed by several arraybased genome comparisons ranges from 2,800 to 3,782 genes
[39-43]. The difference would come from the number and
types of tested strains and types of microarrays used in each
study.

Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. O157
Sakai and K-12 MG1655 were used as references in CGH and
WGPScanning analyses. Eight EHEC O157:H7 (or H-) strains
were previously described [19]. Of the tested non-O157 EHEC
strains, ED71, ED80, and ED411 were isolated in Italy (kindly
provided by S Morabito, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome),
PMK5 in France [45], and the others in Japan in 2001.
Growth conditions and the protocol for genomic DNA preparation were described previously [18].

Detection and subtyping of stx and eae genes

Multi-locus sequence typing

interactions

Internal regions of each of seven housekeeping genes, aspC,
clpX, fadD, icdA, lysP, mdh, and uidA, were amplified and
sequenced for each test strain. Primer designs and PCR conditions were determined according to the 'multil-locus
sequence typing database for pathogenic E. coli [48]. The
sequences of seven loci were concatenated and aligned with
those of other pathogenic E. coli strains in the EcMLST database by using the ClustalW program [49] in the MEGA3 software [50], and then a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was
generated by using the Tamura-Nei evolutionary model.

refereed research

Detection of stx1 genes was done by PCR amplification with
primers stx1-F (5'-caggggataatttgtttgcagttg-3') and stx1-R (5'gacacatagaaggaaactcatcag-3'), using 10 ng of genomic DNA as
template with a EX taq PCR kit (Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan) by
30 amplification cycles of denaturation for 20 s at 98°C,

information

We describe the first systematic whole genome comparison
between O157 and non-O157 EHEC strains based on the O157
Sakai sequence. Chromosomal backbone regions were highly
conserved both in O157 and non-O157 EHEC strains of O26,
O111, and O103 serotypes. In contrast, O157 Sakai-specific
regions were very poorly conserved in the non-O157 EHEC
strains, even though their total genome sizes were the same or
rather larger than that of O157. It is assumed, therefore, that
O157 and non-O157 EHEC strains have independently
acquired a huge amount of lineage- or strain-specific genes by
LGT. On the other hand, an unexpectedly large number of virulence genes, especially those for non-LEE effectors and nonfimbrial adhesions, were well conserved in non-O157 EHEC
strains in addition to the stx genes and LEE island. In O157,
most of them were encoded on prophages and the plasmid.
Although non-O157 EHEC strains contained multiple
prophages similar to those of O157, these prophages exhibited
remarkable structural and positional diversity. These data
suggest that infections of similar but distinct bacteriophages
are deeply involved in the evolution of EHEC strains belonging to different E. coli lineages.

Conclusion

Materials and methods

reviews

542 repeated genes) are conserved in non-O157 EHEC strains
on average. Taken together, we can expect that each nonO157 EHEC strain contains around 950 serotype- or strainspecific genes that do not exist in O157 Sakai. The presence of
such a huge amount of serotype- or strain-specific genes may
explain why non-O157 EHECs exhibit several phenotypes
distinct from O157. For example, O26, O111, and O103 EHEC
can cause diseases in cattle, goats, pigs, and rabbits, while
O157 rarely does [6]. In this regard, the absence of several
gene clusters for fimbrial biosynthesis and iron utilization
systems in non-O157 EHECs may suggest that non-O157
EHEC lineages have acquired alternative gene clusters for virulence towards these animals, which may confer different
types of host tropisms to these lineages. To address these
issues, more detailed analyses of non-O157 EHEC strains,
including whole genome sequence determination, will be
required.

Variation in the integration sites for Stx phages and LEE islands in O157 and non-O157 EHEC strains
Variation in the integration sites for Stx phages and LEE islands in O157 and non-O157 EHEC strains. (a) Locations of the Stx phages and the LEE islands
on each chromosome are shown. Integration sites of Stx2 phages in O157 strain 3, O26 strain 8, and O111 strain 3, and those of Stx1 phages in O111
strains 1, 4, 5, and 6, and O103 strain 3 are unknown. (b-e) Schematic presentation of newly identified integration sites for Stx phages. DNA sequences of
left or right junctions for each integration site are also shown. (b) The torS-tort intergenic region in O103 strains 1, 2, 4, and 6. The torS and torT genes
encode a sensor for a two-component regulatory system and a periplasmic protein of unknown function, respectively. The right junction was not
identified. (c) The argW region in O157 strain 8 and O103 strain 5. The argW gene encodes an arginine tRNA. (d) The ssrA region in O111 strains 2 and 3.
The ssrA gene encodes the tmRNA. The right junction was not identified. (e) The prfC gene in O103 strain 5. The prfC gene encodes the peptide chain
release factor (RF-3). Integration of Stx1 phage into the prfC gene changes the amino acid sequence of a short amino-terminal region of RF-3, and removes
the authentic ribosome binding site and promoter sequences. It is not known whether the prfC gene is transcribed and/or translated in the strain. The prfC
gene, however, is not listed as an essential gene of E. coli [24].

100 μg/ml proteinase K. XbaI-digested genomic DNA was
separated by using CHEF MAPPER (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Inc.) with 1% Pulsed Field Certified Agarose (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.,) at 6.0 V/cm for 22 h and 18 minutes with
pulsed times ranging from 47 to 44.69 s. I-CeuI-digested
DNA was with 1% Pulsed Field Certified Agarose at 6.0 V/cm
for 23 h and 52 minutes with pulsed times ranging from 1.19
to 83.55 s or with 0.8% Agarose at 3.0 V/cm for 24 h with
pulsed times ranging from 600 to 800 s. Sizes of each DNA
band were estimated by Lane Analyzer (ATTO Corp., Tokyo,
Japan).

Plasmid profile
Plasmid DNA was purified from overnight culture of each
EHEC strain using a plasmid midi kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan)
according to the manufacturer's instructions, and was separated by the CHEF MAPPER with 1% Pulsed Field Certified
Agarose at 6.0 V/cm for 12 h with pulsed times ranging from
0.14 to 21.79 s. Band sizes were estimated by Lane Analyzer.

Microarray analysis
The protocol of CGH analysis using an O157 oligoDNA microarray has been described previously [18]. In brief, oligonucleotide probes were prepared for all the protein-coding genes in
the Sakai genome (5,447 genes in total). The probes were
principally 60-mer in length and two probes were prepared
for each gene. Repeated genes sharing various lengths of
almost identical sequences (542 genes in total) were grouped
into 151 repeated gene families, and each family was represented by a single probe. Genomic DNA (3 μg) from the reference strain (O157 Sakai) and each test strain was used to
generate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled samples, respectively, and
cohybridized on a single array. For each test strain, DNA labeling and hybridization were performed twice independently.
Fluorescence intensities of the spots were collected using the
ArrayVision 8.0 software (Imaging Research Inc., Ontario,
Canada). After filtrating the spots with slide abnormalities or
low signal intensities in the reference channels, the fluorescence intensity in each cannel was log2-transformed. Presence or absence of each probe was then determined by using
the array-based genotyping software GACK [52]. The presence or absence of each gene was finally determined according to each probe result obtained from two independent
hybridizations as described previously [18]. Processed
datasets were displayed in genomic order using the
TREEVIEW program [53].
In our previous test experiment using K-12 strain MG1655,
96.9% of the genes that were predicted as 'present' by an in
silico analysis (threshold value ≥90% identity in each 60-mer
probe sequence) were judged as 'present' in the microarray
analysis, and 97.8% of the genes predicted as 'absent' were
judged as 'absent' [18].

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R138

The microarray data have been submitted to the Gene
Expression Omnibus (series record number GSE7931). Final
processed data are presented in Additional data file 6.

WGPScanning analysis
The WGPScanning method was described previously [19]. In
brief, we used a total of 1,120 primers that can amplify the
entire O157 Sakai genome by 560 long PCRs (549 for the
chromosome and 11 for the plasmids). All the primer
sequences are available at our web site [54]. Long PCR was
performed using the LA taq PCR kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto,
Japan) and 1 ng of genomic DNA as template with 30 cycles
of a two-step amplification program: 20 s at 98°C and 16 minutes at 69°C. PCR products were separated by field inversion
gel electrophoresis (FIGE), and product sizes were estimated
by Lane Analyzer.

Construction of fosmid libraries
To identify alternative integration sites of Stx phages, we constructed fosmid libraries for O157 strain 8, O26 strain 2, O111
strains 2 and 3, and O103 strains 1 and 5 by using a Copycontrol Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicentre, Medison, WI,
USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Insert
sizes and redundancies of each library were, on average, 40
kb and 20 times, respectively. The stx1- and stx2-containing
clones were screened by PCR using the following primer
pairs; stx1-F, 5'-gacacatagaaggaaactcatcag-3', and stx1-R, 5'caggggataatttgtttgcagttg-3' for stx1; and stx2-F, 5'-ggcgcgttttgaccatcttcgt-3', and stx2-R, 5'-tacctttagcacaatccgccgc-3' for
stx2. End sequences of each insert were determined by direct
sequencing, and were used to roughly map the integration
sites on the E. coli chromosome. Precise integration sites
were determined by the primer-walking method.
