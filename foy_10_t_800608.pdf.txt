expression of the class I lysyl-tRNA synthetase
of Bacillus cereus strain 14579 is functional
and can be partially induced by reduced
charging of asparaginyl-tRNAAsn

Abstract
Background: Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is unique within the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family in that both
class I (LysRS1) and class II (LysRS2) enzymes exist. LysRS1 enzymes are found in Archaebacteria and some
eubacteria while all other organisms have LysRS2 enzymes. All sequenced strains of Bacillus cereus (except AH820)
and Bacillus thuringiensis however encode both a class I and a class II LysRS. The lysK gene (encoding LysRS1) of B.
cereus strain 14579 has an associated T box element, the first reported instance of potential T box control of LysRS
expression.
Results: A global study of 891 completely sequenced bacterial genomes identified T box elements associated with
control of LysRS expression in only four bacterial species: B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, Symbiobacterium thermophilum
and Clostridium beijerinckii. Here we investigate the T box element found in the regulatory region of the lysK gene
in B. cereus strain 14579. We show that this T box element is functional, responding in a canonical manner to an
increased level of uncharged tRNALys but, unusually, also responding to an increased level of uncharged tRNAAsn.
We also show that B. subtilis strains with T box regulated expression of the endogenous lysS or the heterologous
lysK genes are viable.
Conclusions: The T box element controlling lysK (encoding LysRS1) expression in B. cereus strain 14579 is
functional, but unusually responds to depletion of charged tRNALys and tRNAAsn. This may have the advantage of
making LysRS1 expression responsive to a wider range of nutritional stresses. The viability of B. subtilis strains with
a single LysRS1 or LysRS2, whose expression is controlled by this T box element, makes the rarity of the occurrence
of such control of LysRS expression puzzling.

Background
The aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (AARS) family of
enzymes function to attach amino acids to their cognate
tRNAs [1-3]. Each enzyme specifically charges a tRNA
with its cognate amino acid in an energy requiring reaction that is executed with very high fidelity. However,
despite all AARSs carrying out essentially the same reaction, the AARS family is subdivided into class I and
class II enzymes that are structurally distinct and

unrelated phylogenetically [for reviews see [3,4]]. This
division of AARS into class I and class II enzymes is
universal with each AARS being a member of one or
other enzyme class in all living organisms. The lysyltRNA synthetase (LysRS) is an exception in that both
class I (LysRS1) and class II (LysRS2) variants exist
[5,6]. LysRS1 enzymes are found in Archaebacteria and
in some eubacteria (eg. Borrelia and Treponema species)
while LysRS2 enzymes are found in most eubacteria and
all eukaryotes. Interestingly some bacteria have both
class I LysRS1 and class II LysRS2 enzymes. For example, in Methanosarcina barkeri the class I and class II

LysRS enzymes function as a complex to charge tRNAPyl
with the rare pyrolysine amino acid while in B. cereus
strain 14579 both enzymes can function together to
aminoacylate a small tRNA-like molecule (tRNAOther)
that functions to control expression TrpRS1 [7-9].
Sustaining charged tRNAs at levels adequate for the
protein synthetic needs of growth under each environmental and nutritional condition is crucial for cell survival. Achieving this mandates that expression of each
AARS be responsive to the cellular level of their charged
cognate tRNAs. Therefore the mechanisms controlling
AARS expression must be able to distinguish their cognate tRNA from other tRNA species and be able to
measure the extent to which the pool of cognate tRNA
is charged. Expression of the majority of AARSs in
Bacillus subtilis is regulated by the T box antitermination mechanism [10]. This mechanism was first discovered in studies on the regulation of threonyl- and
tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase expression in B. subtilis
[11-13], for a review see 14. The T box elements are
widely distributed, being present in Firmicutes, δ-proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Deinococcales/Thermales and Actinobacteria, and control expression of genes involved in
cellular activities other than tRNA charging such as
amino acid biosynthesis, amino acid transport and regulation of amino acid metabolism [15-17].
The T-box regulatory element is usually a 200-300
nucleotide untranslated RNA leader sequence containing
a conserved T box sequence, stem-loop structures and a
conditional Rho-independent terminator located
upstream of the start codon [11-13]. Two specific interactions between tRNAs and T box leader sequences
enable recognition of cognate tRNA species and distinction between charged and uncharged pools of tRNA.
The NCCA sequence in the acceptor stem of a nonacylated-tRNA interacts with the UGGN sequence within
the T box sequence (N varies according to the identity
of the discriminator base of each tRNA) [13,14,18,19].
This interaction cannot occur when a tRNA is aminoacylated, thereby distinguishing between charged and
uncharged tRNAs. Specificity for cognate tRNAs is
achieved by the presence of a specifier codon within a
bulge in stem I of the leader sequence that interacts
with the anticodon sequence of each tRNA. (eg. See
Additional file 1, Figure S5). Thus for T box control of
AARS expression, a high level of an uncharged tRNA
(necessitating increased AARS production) causes interaction between that tRNA and its cognate T box element that stabilizes the anti-termination structure of the
leader sequence allowing transcription of the AARS
gene to proceed. A high level of aminoacylated-tRNAs
in contrast cannot interact with the leader sequence
allowing formation of the Rho-independent terminator
and preventing continued transcription of the gene.

While most eubacteria encode either a class I or a
class II LysRS, all sequenced strains of B. cereus (except
strain AH820) and B. thuringiensis encode a copy of
both enzyme types [8,16,17]. In Bacillus cereus strain
14579, the LysRS2-encoding lysS gene is positioned at
the end of an operon encoding genes involved in folate
metabolism, its normal position in most Bacilli while
the lysK gene encoding the class I-type LysRS1 is
located elsewhere on the chromosome. Shaul et al.
(2006) show that this LysRS1 is closely related to the
class I LysRS1 of Pyrococcus, suggesting that it has been
acquired by B. cereus by horizontal transfer [20]. The
function of LysRS1 in B. cereus is not clear but it is
expressed predominantly in stationary phase and can
aminoacylate a novel tRNA species (tRNAOther) in concert with the class II LysRS enzyme [8]. Thus it may
play a role in surviving nutritional downshift in B. cereus.
Ataide and colleagues reported the presence of a putative T box regulatory element upstream of the lysK coding sequence in B. cereus strain 14579 [8]. This was the
first reported instance of putative control of LysRS
expression by a T box mechanism. Here we investigate
control of LysRS expression by a T box mechanism,
confirming that it occurs only very rarely in bacteria.
We show that the T box element of the lysK gene of
B. cereus strain 14579 is functional and responds to an
increased level of uncharged tRNA Lys in a canonical
manner. Interestingly, this T box element shows some
promiscuity in its specificity by responding to a reduced
cellular level of asparaginyl-tRNAAsn. We also show that
strains of B. subtilis, in which expression of the endogenous LysRS2 or the heterologous LysRS1 is controlled
by this T box element, are viable.

Results
Regulation of lysyl tRNA synthetase expression by a
T-box antitermination mechanism occurs rarely

A search of the upstream region of AARS-encoding
genes in 891 completely sequenced bacterial genomes
identified 976 T box elements. Significant variation in
the frequency with which individual AARS are regulated
by a T box mechanism was observed in this cohort, consistent with previous reports [16,17]. Control of LysRS
expression by T box elements occurs very rarely, being
documented in only 4 bacterial species: all sequenced
B. cereus strains (except AH820); in B. thuringiensis
strains Konkukian and Al Hakam; in Clostridium beijerinckii and in Symbiobacterium thermophilum [8,16,17].
These cases display several interesting features (Table 1):
(i) all bacterial species with T-box regulated LysRS
expression have a second LysRS that is not T-box regulated; (ii) the phylogenetically related B. cereus and
B. thuringiensis species each have a class II LysRS2 and a
T-box regulated class I LysRS1 - these T box regulatory

elements show very high sequence conservation (~92%
identity, Additional file 1, Figures S1, S5); (iii) conversely
in S. thermophilum, the class II LysRS2 (STH525) is regulated by a T box element with little similarity to that
found in the Bacillus species (Additional file 1, Figures
S3, S7) while the class I LysRS1 (STH208) is not T box
regulated and (iv) C. beijerincki has two classII LysRS
(Cbei_3591 and Cbei_0105), one of which (Cbei_3591) is
regulated by a T box element that displays clear sequence
similarity (~50% identity) to the T box found in the
Bacillus species (see Additional file 1, Figures S2, S6), but
little similarity to the T box element of S. thermophilum
(Additional file 1, Figure S4). Thus T box regulated
LysRS expression is very rare and is invariably accompanied by a second non-T-box regulated (either class I or
class II) LysRS. Two separate T box elements were identified - one controlling expression of a class II LysRS2 in
S. thermophilum and the second controlling expression
of a class I LysRS1 in B. cereus and B. thuringiensis but a
class II LysRS2 in C. beijerinckii
The T-box element controlling expression of lysK in
B. cereus strain 14579 is functional

The T-box element in the B. cereus and B. thuringiensis
strains has a canonical structure [8], is highly conserved
and controls expression of a class I LysRS (encoded by the
lysK gene) of Pyrococcal origin [20]. Interestingly, the lysK
gene is expressed predominantly during stationary phase
in B. cereus strain 14579, whereas the class II LysRS is
expressed during exponential growth of this bacterium [8].
To ascertain whether this T-box element is functional,
expression of a PlysK(T box) lacZ transcriptional fusion (present in single copy at the amyE locus of the B. subtilis
chromosome) was established under conditions of lysine
starvation (strain NF33 is a lysine auxotroph) and LysRS2
depletion (strain BCJ367 has the endogenous lysS gene
under the control of the IPTG-inducible Pspac promoter).

The results are shown in Figure 1. When strain NF33 is
grown in lysine replete medium, only a low level of PlysK(T
box) lacZ expression (~10 units of b-galactosidase activity) is
observed (Figure 1A, squares). However growth in a lysine
depleted medium (growth cessation occurs at ~ OD600 1
due to lysine deficiency) results in a high level of PlysK(T box)
lacZ expression, with accumulation of ~1200 units of bgalactosidase activity. Importantly PlysK(T box) lacZ induction
is coincident with the point of growth cessation due to
lysine deficiency (Figure 1A). To confirm that increased
PlysK(T box) lacZ expression is associated with increased
levels of uncharged tRNALys, strain BCJ367 (Pspac lysS PlysK
(T box) lacZ) was grown in the presence of 1 mM IPTG,
250 μM IPTG and 100 μM IPTG. Growth of the cultures
containing 1 mM and 250 μM IPTG was similar to that of
wild-type strain 168 while growth of the cultures with
100 μM IPTG was reduced, presumably due to a decreased
level of charged lysyl-tRNALys (Figure 1B). Expression of
PlysK(T box) lacZ is low (~10 units b-galactosidase activity) in
cultures containing 1 mM IPTG. PlysK(T box) lacZ expression
is initially low in cultures containing 250 μM IPTG but
gradually increases with accumulation of ~200 units of
b-galactosidase activity at the onset of stationary phase.
However in cultures with 100 μM IPTG, PlysK(T box) lacZ
expression increases throughout exponential growth with
accumulation of more than 800 units of b-galactosidase
during this period (Figure 1B). To confirm that this
increased PlysK(T box) lacZ expression is due to increased
levels of uncharged tRNALys caused by LysRS2 depletion, a
culture was grown for 150 minutes in the presence of
100 μM IPTG at which point, the IPTG concentration was
increased to 1 mM (Figure 1C). Results showed accumulation of ~1200 units of b-galactosidase activity at 150 minutes but this level decreased subsequent to IPTG addition
and continued to decrease for the remaining period of
exponential growth (Figure 1C). It is noteworthy that the
growth rate also increased upon IPTG addition (Figure 1C).
As a control we established that PlysK(T box) lacZ expression
is not induced by cellular depletion of phenylalanine showing that its induction shows the expected specificity (data
not shown). These data show that the T box regulatory element found in the control region of the class I lysK gene of
B. cereus strain 14579 is functional and responds to
increased levels of uncharged tRNALys in a canonical
manner.
A B. subtilis strain expressing the B. cereus class I LysK
under T box regulatory control is viable

The rarity of the T box control of LysRS expression, and
where found, occurs only in conjunction with a second
cellular LysRS, prompted us to ask whether T box control of LysRS expression is compatible with viability. To
address this question, B. subtilis strain NF54 (amyE::
P lysK(T box) lysK ∂lysS) was constructed in which

expression of the B. cereus lysK gene is under the control of its natural promoter and T box regulatory element in single copy at the amyE locus and the
endogenous lysS gene is partially deleted (373 amino
acids of LysRS deleted leaving only the C-terminal 126
amino acids) by a double cross-over event. It is important to note that in strain NF54 the P lysK(T box) lysK

cassette is flanked by transcriptional terminators, ensuring that lysK expression is solely dependent on the PlysK
(T box) promoter. This strain was successfully constructed and verified by PCR and Southern blot analysis
and by sequencing of selected regions (data not shown).
This confirms that in B. subtilis T box mediated control
of LysRS1 expression is compatible with viability. To

establish whether NF54 has a phenotype, growth profiles
were established in rich (LB) and minimal media and
compared with wild-type B. subtilis strain 168. Results
show an increase in the generation time of strain NF54
during growth in LB medium: NF54 has a doubling time
of ~31 minutes while that of wild-type strain 168 is ~22
minutes under these conditions. However strain NF54
does not grow in minimal medium whereas wild-type
strain 168 has a generation time of ~76 minutes in this
medium. To establish whether this growth phenotype
was due to reduced tRNALys charging, the P lysK(T box)
lacZ was introduced into strain NF54 generating strain
NF206. Reduced charging of tRNALys in strain NF206
will result in increased b-galactosidase accumulation
when compared with strain BCJ363 that has the PlysK(T
box) lacZ contruct in an otherwise wild-type background
(ie. with the endogenous class II lysS). Results show that
250-300 units of b-galactosidase accumulate during
exponential growth of strain NF206, an ~20-fold
increase over that observed in the control strain BCJ363.
We conclude T box control of LysR1 expression is compatible with viability of B. subtilis. However such strains
have a reduced growth rate in rich medium and cannot
be propagated in minimal medium probably due to
reduced tRNALys charging.
A B. subtilis strain with expression of the endogenous
class II lysS under the control of the T box regulatory
element is viable and indistinguishable from wild-type in
terms of growth and tRNALys charging

While T box control of LysRS1 expression supports
growth of B. subtilis, the level of charged tRNA Lys is
reduced and there is a growth phenotype. However it is
unclear whether this phenotype is caused by T box regulation of LysRS expression or is due to the B. cereus
derived class I LysRS1 enzyme that is reported to be
less efficient catalytically than its class II counterpart
[21]. To distinguish between these possibilities and to
further address the issue of T box regulation of LysRS,
we constructed strain NF113 (lysS::PlysK(T box) lysS) that
placed expression of the endogenous B. subtilis lysS
gene under the control of the lysK promoter and T box
element from B. cereus strain 14579. It is important to
note that in strain NF113 the PlysK(T box) lysS cassette is
flanked by transcriptional terminators ensuring that lysS
expression is solely dependent on the PlysK(T box) promoter. Strain NF113 was successfully constructed and the
relevant chromosomal regions verified by PCR and
Southern blotting (data not shown) confirming that T
box regulation of LysRS2 expression supports growth of
B. subtilis. Importantly growth of strain NF113 in rich
(LB) and minimal media (Spizizen salts) was indistinguishable from wild-type strain 168 (data not shown).
The level of charged tRNA Lys was assessed in strain

Page 5 of 12

NF113 by introducing the P lysK(T box) lacZ transcriptional fusion to generate strain NF205. Approximately
10 units of b-galactosidase accumulated during exponential growth of strain NF205 similar to control strain
BCJ363 (data not shown). We conclude that T box control of lysS expression is compatible with growth of
B. subtilis. It is likely that the growth and tRNALys charging deficiency of strains NF54 and NF206 (containing
T box regulated LysRS1) is caused by decreased efficiency of tRNALys charging by LysRS1 rather than by
T box control of its expression.
The T box element associated with the B. cereus class I
LysRS1 can be partially induced by asparagine starvation

The results presented show that while T box regulation
of LysRS expression occurs very rarely and invariably in
conjunction with a non-T box regulated paralogue, control of expression of the main LysRS by a T box
mechanism is compatible with viability. This prompted
us to question why T box regulation of LysRS expression does not occur more frequently. We noted that
expression of neither LysRS nor AsnRS is regulated by a
T box mechanism in Bacilli and that these two amino
acids are encoded in a mixed codon box (Figure 2A).
We therefore hypothesized that the T box element that
controls expression of the class I LysRS1 of B. cereus
may be inducible both by uncharged tRNA Lys and
tRNAAsn. A prediction of this hypothesis is that cellular
depletion of charged tRNAAsn may induce expression of
P lysK(T box) lacZ. To test this hypothesis, strain NF60
(Pspac asnS PlysK(T box) lacZ) was constructed containing
the asnS gene under the control of the inducible Pspac
promoter (there is no B. subtilis asparagine auxotroph)
and the P lysK(T box) lacZ to monitor induction. The
growth profiles of NF60 cultures containing 1 mM and
250 μM IPTG were identical, but b-glactosidase accumulation differed significantly under these two conditions. Approximately 30 units of b-galactosidase
accumulated during exponential growth of the culture
containing 1 mM IPTG while more than 350 units of
b-galactosidase accumulated during exponential growth
of the culture containing 250 μM IPTG (data not
shown). To exclude the possibility that depleting cellular
levels of AsnRS leads to a concomitant increase in the
uncharged tRNALys level (and hence increased PlysK(T
box) lacZ expression) we established the highest IPTG
concentration at which some induction of PlysK(T box)
lacZ occurred but at which growth of the culture was
unaffected. The growth profiles of NF60 cultures containing 1 mM IPTG and 600 μM IPTG are identical
(Figure 2B). However ~20-40 units of b-galactosidase
accumulate during exponential growth of the culture
containing 1 mM IPTG while more than 80 units of
b-galactosidase accumulate during exponential growth

of the culture containing 600 μM IPTG. Importantly the
kinetics of PlysK(T box) lacZ expression differed in the
two cultures: an increase in b-galactosidase accumulation is evident in the 600 μM culture that is not seen in
the 1 mM IPTG culture. To verify that this induction is

not due to an increased level of uncharged tRNALys, the
cellular level of lysyl-tRNALys was measured in wild-type
strain 168 and in cultures of NF60 grown in 1 mM and
600 μM IPTG (Figure 2C). It is clear that the level of
lysyl-tRNALys is approximately the same (~80%) in both

Foy et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:196
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/196

IPTG-containing cultures of NF60, a level that is higher
than that observed (~74%) in cultures of wild-type
B. subtilis strain 168 grown in the same medium (without IPTG). As an additional control, we measured PlysK
Lys
levels in
(T box) lacZ expression and charged tRNA
cultures of strain BCJ367 (P spac lysS P lysK(T box) lacZ)
growing in 1 mM and 600 μM IPTG. Approximately
20-30 units of b-galactosidase accumulated in both cultures and importantly the level of charged tRNA Lys in
both cultures was ~83% (data not shown).
We then sought to establish (i) if depletion of the cellular level of a charged tRNA leads to a general reduction in level of other charged tRNAs and (ii) if some
level of cross-induction exists among T box elements
controlling expression of AARS that charge the constituent tRNAs of mixed codon boxes in B. subtilis. To
address both issues, transcriptional fusions of the promoter and T box element of the pheS, ileS and trpS
AARS genes of B. subtilis with the lacZ reporter gene
were constructed. Each fusion was introduced into
strains auxotrophic for their cognate amino acids and
into strains auxotrophic for the non-cognate amino acid
in the mixed codon box. In each case, depletion for the
cognate amino acid resulted in immediate induction of
b-galactosidase expression while depletion for the noncognate amino acid did not induce b-galactosidase
expression to a significant level in any case (data not
shown). These data show that depletion for an individual amino acid does not lead to a general increase in
the level of uncharged tRNAs of other amino acids and
that promiscuous cross-induction of T box controlled
promoters by depletion of the non-cognate amino acid
of a mixed codon box does not occur in B. subtilis.
We conclude that the T box element controlling expression of lysK encoding the class I LysRS1 of B. cereus strain
14579 displays some promiscuity of induction, being capable of responding to an increased level of uncharged
tRNAAsn in addition to uncharged tRNALys. However such
promiscuous cross-induction is not a general feature of T
box elements in B. subtilis.

Discussion
T box regulation of LysRS expression occurs rarely and in
exceptional circumstances

The T box mechanism is widely employed to regulate
AARS expression in a manner that is responsive to the
level of uncharged cognate tRNA in the cell. Of 976 T
box elements associated with regulation of AARS
expression in 891 completely sequenced bacterial genomes identified in our analysis, potential T box control
of LysRS expression was identified in only 4 bacterial
species: T box elements were identified in all sequenced
strains of B. cereus (except AH820) and B. thuringiensis,
in association with a class I LysRS1 of Pyrococcal origin

Page 7 of 12

[8]; a T box element was identified in C. beijerinckii
associated with a class II LysRS2 [17] and a T box element was identified in S. thermophilum, associated with
a class I LysRS1 [16]. The T box elements in the Bacillus and Clostridium species are homologous: the T box
elements of the Bacillus strains are ~92% identical while
~50% identity exists between the T box elements of the
Bacillus and Clostridium species (see Additional file 1,
Figure S1). However the T box element of S. thermophilum appears unrelated to the other T box elements (see
Additional file 1, Figure S3). This is especially interesting since despite its high G+C (68.7%) content, S. thermophilum proteins are more similar to those of the low
G+C Firmicutes such as Bacilli and Clostridia than to
the high G+C Actinobacteria. In view of this, it is also
interesting that among the homologous T box elements,
those in the Bacilli are associated with a class I LysRS
while the T box element in C. beijerinckii is associated
with a class II LysRS. Thus T box regulation of LysRS
expression appears to have evolved on two separate
occasions, and one T box element has been conjoined
with two different LysRS-encoding genes.
There are several interesting features about this cohort
of T box regulated LysRS: (i) all bacterial species with a
T box regulated LysRS have a second LysRS that is not
T box regulated; (ii) the four T box elements in the
phylogenetically related B. cereus and B. thuringiensis
species are associated with a class I LysRS1 and display
~92% identity; (iii) the class I LysRS1 of B. cereus and
B. thuringiensis is most closely related to LysRS1 from
Pyrococcal species suggesting that a common ancestor
of B. cereus/thuringiensis acquired it by a lateral gene
transfer event [20]; (iv) the T box regulated LysRS1 in
B. cereus strain 14579 is expressed predominantly in
stationary phase [8] and (v) T box elements do not
occur in Archaebacteria. The likely Pyrococcal origin of
B. cereus LysRS1 and the absence of T box elements in
Archaebacteria presents an interesting question as to
how the regulatory sequence and structural gene were
conjoined in this case. Perhaps tRNALys-responsive T
box elements were more common in the ancestor of
Firmicutes (supported by a similar T box element being
associated with a class II LysRS2 in C. beijerinckii) and
were selectively lost as controlling elements of the principal cellular LysRS, but were retained for control of
ancillary LysRS enzyme expression. A second interesting
possibility, especially in view of the fact that it can be
induced by tRNA Asn , is that the T box element associated with lysK of B. cereus may have evolved from an
element with a specificity determinant similar in
sequence to that of lysine. These observations suggest
that T box regulation may be unsuited for controlling
expression of the housekeeping LysRS in bacteria and
perhaps is only tolerated in additional copies of LysRS

Foy et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:196
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/196

that play an ancillary role such as adaptation to stationary phase conditions as observed in B. cereus. Determining whether the other T box regulated lysS genes play
an ancillary role requires further investigation. Notably,
T box regulation of housekeeping aminoacyl tRNA
synthetases is widespread, suggesting that it is some
aspect of lysine metabolism that makes T box control of
LysRS expression unsuitable as a regulatory mechanism.
The LysRS1 T box element from B. cereus is functional
and B. subtilis strains with T box control of LysRS1 and
LysR2 expression are viable

The unknown provenance and functionality of the
T box element, despite the reported theoretical capability to form canonical T box element structures [8]
prompted us to verify that it was functional and to ask
whether strains of B. subtilis expressing a single copy of
LysRS1 or LysRS2 controlled by this T box element are
viable. We chose to conduct this study in B. subtilis
because of the paucity of relevant auxotrophic B. cereus
strains and other difficulties with antibiotic resistance
and transformability. However we consider B. subtilis to
be a valid model system in which to conduct this study.
Our results show that the T box element is functional
and can be induced up to 120-fold in response to lysineor LysRS-depletion but not by depletion of non-cognate
amino acids. Also strains of B. subtilis with expression
of the endogenous LysRS2 controlled by this T box element are viable, and could not be distinguished from B.
subtilis wild-type strain 168 during growth in rich or
minimal medium. While a strain of B. subtilis expressing
LysRS1 controlled by the T box element from B. cereus
strain 14579 is also viable, it displays a growth defect
when grown in rich medium and cannot be propagated
in minimal medium. However it is likely that these phenotypes result from the reduced catalytic activity of
class I LysRS enzyme rather than from control of
expression by the T box element. These results show
there is no a priori reason precluding control of LysRS
expression by a tRNALys-responsive T box element. It
emphasizes the puzzling rarity of T box regulated LysRS
expression and the restriction of its occurrence in
B. cereus strain 14579 to controlling expression of a
LysRS1 enzyme that plays an ancillary role in adapting
cells to adverse conditions.
The T box element controlling expression of LysRS1 in
B. cereus strain 14579 can be induced by an increased
level of uncharged tRNAAsn

The unusual occurrence of tRNALys-responsive T box
elements and the experimentally demonstrated viability
of B. subtilis strains with T box regulated LysRS expression prompted us to investigate why T box regulation of
LysRS expression is rare. We noted a tendency in

Page 8 of 12

B. subtilis for non-T box regulated AARS (ArgRS,
AsnRS, GltRS, LysRS, MetRS, and ProRS) to charge
tRNAs with amino acids encoded in mixed codon boxes
(ProRS being an exception, not being encoded by a
mixed codon box). This observation, together with its
possible origin being a T box element that is responsive
to a different tRNA, prompted us to investigate whether
the T box element controlling LysRS1 expression in
B. cereus might also be induced by depletion of asparaginyl-tRNAAsn. Our results show that cellular depletion
of AsnRS in B. subtilis results in induction of the PlysK(T box)
lacZ. We show that this induction is not caused by concomitant depletion of lysyl-tRNA Lys since induction
occurs when cellular levels of charged tRNALys are high
(Figure 2). Importantly, there is no direct link in the biosynthetic pathways of lysine and asparagine. Also, expression of P lysK(T box) lacZ does not occur when cells are
depleted for phenylalanine, showing that induction displays the expected specificity for lysine starvation. These
data show that the T box element controlling expression
of LysRS1 of B. cereus can be induced by an increased
level of uncharged tRNALys and tRNAAsn. However such
promiscuity of induction is restricted to this lysK-associated T box element since T box element control of
expression of AARSs within mixed codon boxes is frequently found [17] and induction of the T box-controlled
pheS, ileS and trpS genes was not observed in response to
starvation for the non-cognate amino acid of the mixed
codon box. The induction promiscuity of the B. cereus
LysRS1-associated T box element might derive from its
having evolved from a T box element that responded to a
different tRNA. Such promiscuity may be tolerated since
LysRS1 in B. cereus appears to have an ancillary role during stationary phase, or it may even be advantageous in
that it makes LysRS1 expression responsive to a broader
range of adverse nutritional conditions.

Conclusions
The T box regulatory element makes expression of
AARS responsive to the uncharged level of their cognate
tRNA and is widely used among bacteria. However significant variability exists in the frequency with which
expression of individual AARSs is controlled by this
mechanism [15-17], this study. It is largely unknown
why T box regulation of LysRS expression is found in
only 4 bacterial species (B. cereus, B. thuringiensis,
S. thermophilum and C. beijerinckii) while more than
140 instances of T box control of IleRS expression are
documented. Moreover these four bacterial species with
a T box regulated LysRS all have a second non-T box
regulated LysRS. We report that two tRNALys-responsive
T box elements exist: the first is found in the Bacillus
and Clostridium species controlling expression of a class
I LysRS1 in Bacillus but a class II LysRS2 in

Foy et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:196
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/196

Clostridium; the second in S. thermophilum displays little homology to the first T box element and controls
expression of a class II LysRS2. We established that the
T box element associated with lysK expression in
B. cereus strain 14579 is functional, but unusually
responds to an increased level of uncharged tRNALys
and tRNAAsn. Since LysRS1 is expressed mainly in stationary phase, this unusual induction profile may make
its expression responsive to a wider range of nutritional
signals. We also demonstrated that B. subtilis cells, in
which expression of the endogenous lysS is controlled
by the lysK T box element from B. cereus, are viable
and are indistinguishable from wild-type B. subtilis
strain 168 in terms of growth and tRNA Lys charging.
Thus there appears to be no a priori reason why expression of the main cellular LysRS is not regulated by a
T box element in B. subtilis (in fact expression of a
majority of the AARS are T box regulated in B. subtilis),
making the rarity of T box control of LysRS expression
among bacteria even more puzzling.

Methods
Bacterial strains, media and growth conditions

Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 2.
Cells were grown routinely at 37°C in LB media, Spizizen’s minimal media [22] or Basal Limitation media
[23]. All cloning in E. coli was carried out in strains
TG1 or TP611 [24,25]. Transformation of B. subtilis and
E. coli was performed as described [26,27]. Antibiotics
were used at the following concentrations: ampicilllin,
100 μg/ml; spectinomycin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol,
3 μg/ml; erythromycin, 2 μg/ml; phleomycin, 1.5 μg/ml
and kanamycin, 10 μg/ml. IPTG was added to cultures
as indicated in the text.
General molecular biology methods

Standard DNA manipulations and cloning procedures
were carried out as described [26]. Chromosomal DNA
was isolated from B. subtilis and B. cereus using the
chromosomal DNA purification kit from Edge Biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturerer’s protocol. Plasmid DNA was isolated by a
modified boiling lysis method [26] and further purified
using the Concert Rapid PCR Purification System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), or the Genelute Plasmid miniprep kit (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification
was performed using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or high fidelity KOD polymerase (CalbiochemNovabiochem Corp. USA). Sequencing was carried out
by MWG Biotech-Germany (Ebersburg, Germany) and
GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). Oligonucleotides
used in this study (listed in Table 3) were purchased
from MWG Biotech-Germany (Ebersburg, Germany) or

Page 9 of 12

Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). For Southern blot
analysis DNA was transferred to Biodyne membranes
(Pall Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) by vacuum blotting
and crosslinked by UV exposure (150 mJ). Dig labeled
probes (Roche, East Sussex, UK) were prepared as per
manufacturer’s protocol and hybridized to the filter
using high concentration SDS buffers. Filter washes and
probe detection were carried out using the Dig detection
kit (Roche, East Sussex, UK).
Strain construction

To construct strain NF33, a 400 bp DNA fragment from
the region upstream of B. cereus lysK was amplified by
PCR using primers NF36F and NF36R, cut with EcoRI
and BamHI, and ligated into similarly restricted
pDG268 [28] to produce the plasmid pBCJ307. pBCJ307
was inserted into the amyE locus of the B. subtilis lysine
auxotroph strain 1A765 by double crossover to produce
strain NF33.
In order to analyze the effect of a reduction of the cellular level of charged tRNALys on expression of a PlysK(T
box) lacZ fusion, strain BCJ367 was constructed. Plasmid
pBCJ307 was integrated into the B. subtilis chromosome
by a double crossover event at the amyE locus to produce strain BCJ363. To place the endogenous lysS gene
of B. subtilis under IPTG inducible control, plasmid
pMUTIN4 [29] was digested with SalI and BsiWI and
eluted from an agarose gel to remove the 2 kb lacZ
gene. The ends of the plasmid molecule were blunt
ended using Klenow polymerase and religated, resulting
in plasmid pMUTINXZ. A 670 bp DNA fragment
encoding the end of the yacF gene was amplified with
oligonucleotides NF2F and NF2R using B. subtiliis strain
168 chromosomal DNA as a template. This fragment
was digested with EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site
of pMUTINXZ, resulting in plasmid pXZ2. Plasmid
pXZ2 was then integrated onto the chromosome of
strain BCJ363 by a Campbell type event generating
strain BCJ366 thereby placing expression of the lysS
gene under the control of the IPTG inducible Pspac promoter. To effect tight control of the P spac promoter,
replicating plasmid pMap65 [30] that encodes a lacI
gene, was transformed into BCJ366 to produce strain
BCJ367.
Strain NF54 was made to assess whether a B. subtilis
strain expressing a T-box regulated lysK gene was viable.
A 1.95 kb fragment of the B. cereus chromosome encoding the lysK promoter, leader region and structural gene
was generated by PCR using oligonucleotides NF36F
and NF9R. This fragment was digested with EcoRI and
cloned into the EcoRI site of plasmid pBCJ102 that has
transcriptional terminators flanking the multiple cloning
site, to generate plasmid pNF30 [31]. A 2567 bp fragment encoding the lysK promoter, T box element and

structural gene flanked by transcriptional terminator

The ends of this fragment were phosphoryalted using
T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and it was then
cloned into the EcoRV site of plasmid pDG1730 [32] to
produce the plasmid pNF48. Plasmid pNF48 was integrated at the amyE locus of the B. subtilis chromosome
by a double crossover event to produce strain NF52.
The lysS gene of strain NF52 was then partially deleted
by integration of plasmid pBCJ144 [31] into the

chromosome by a double-crossover event, replacing part
of lysS with a kanamycin resistance cassette, thereby
generating strain NF54. In strain NF54, 373 amino acids
of LysRS are deleted leaving only the C-terminal 126
amino acids). Importantly, in this strain the PlysK (Tbox)
lysK construct is flanked by transcriptional terminators
so that lysK expression is solely dependent on the PlysK
(Tbox) promoter. To insert the PlysK (Tbox) lacZ reporter
fusion into the chromosome of B. subtilis strain NF54,
plasmid pBCJ307 was integrated at the amyE locus,
thereby generating strain NF206.

To construct B. subtilis strain NF113, that has expression of the endogenous lysS gene under the control of the
lysK promoter and T box element, a 423 bp DNA fragment encoding the B. cereus lysK promoter and T box element (generated using oligonucleotides NF36F and
NF15R) was fused to a 672 bp fragment of the lysS gene
(generated using oligonucleotides NF15F and NF3R/2) by
overlapping PCR (using the outside primers NF36F and
NF3R/2). This DNA fragment was then digested with
EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into EcoRI digested
pBCJ102 [31] to generate the plasmid pNF112: the PlysK
(Tbox) lysS insert is flanked by transcriptional terminators
in this plasmid. Plasmid pNF112 was then integrated into
the B. subtilis chromosome at the lysS locus by a Campbell-type event to produce the strain NF113. To introduce
the PlysK (Tbox) lacZ reporter fusion into strain NF113, it
was transformed with chromosomal DNA from strain
NF204 that contains the PlysK (Tbox) lacZ reporter fusion at
the amyE locus, thereby generating strain NF205. Strain
NF204 was constructed by transformation of strain 1A717
[32] with pBCJ307. To construct B. subtilis strain NF60 in
which expression of the endogenous asnS gene is placed
under the control of the IPTG-dependent PSpac promoter
and containing the PlysK(T box) lacZ fusion, a 516 bp DNA
fragment encoding the asnS promoter region was amplified using oligonucleotides NF16F and NF16R, digested
with HindIII and cloned into HindIII digested pMutinXZ
to produce plasmid pNF40. Plasmid pNF40 was transformed into B. subtilis strain BCJ363 by a Campbell-type
event to produce strain NF58. Plasmid pMAP65 (encoding
the lacI gene) was then established in strain NF58 to
ensure strict IPTG-dependent asnS expression, thereby
generating strain NF60.
Measurement of tRNA charging by Northern analysis

Establishing the level of charged tRNA Lys was carried
out as previously described [31]. B. subtilis tRNA Lys

Bioinformatic analysis

The genes encoding AARS proteins were identified in
891 bacterial genomes by homology with their orthologues of B. subtilis - for glutaminyl tRNA synthetases, the E. coli protein was used. Only proteins that
displayed BLAST E-values of less than 10 -1 0 were
retained for further analysis. The complete upstream
region of each AARS-encoding gene was examined
for the presence of the T-box motif TGGNACCGCG,
allowing up to two mismatches in the last six positions. Sequences containing potential T-box
sequences were then examined manually for their
ability to form mutually exclusive terminator and
anti-terminator DNA structures
