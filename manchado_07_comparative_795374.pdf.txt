Abstract
Background: Ribosomal proteins (RPs) are key components of ribosomes, the cellular organelle
responsible for protein biosynthesis in cells. Their levels can vary as a function of organism growth and
development; however, some RPs have been associated with other cellular processes or extraribosomal
functions. Their high representation in cDNA libraries has resulted in the increase of RP sequences
available from different organisms and their proposal as appropriate molecular markers for phylogenetic
analysis.
Results: The development of large-scale genomics of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) and Atlantic
halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), two commercially important flatfish species, has made possible the
identification and systematic analysis of the complete set of RP sequences for the small (40S) ribosome
subunit. Amino acid sequence comparisons showed a high similarity both between these two flatfish
species and with respect to other fish and human. EST analysis revealed the existence of two and four
RPS27 genes in Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis clustered RPS27 in
two separate clades with their fish and mammalian counterparts. Steady-state transcript levels for eight
RPs (RPS2, RPS3a, RPS15, RPS27-1, RPS27-2, RPS27a, RPS28, and RPS29) in sole were quantitated during
larval development and in tissues, using a real-time PCR approach. All eight RPs exhibited different
expression patterns in tissues with the lowest levels in brain. On the contrary, RP transcripts increased
co-ordinately after first larval feeding reducing progressively during the metamorphic process.
Conclusion: The genomic resources and knowledge developed in this survey will provide new insights
into the evolution of Pleuronectiformes. Expression data will contribute to a better understanding of RP
functions in fish, especially the mechanisms that govern growth and development in larvae, with
implications in aquaculture.

Background
The eukaryotic ribosome is a complex macromolecular
structure composed of a large (60S) and a small (40S)
subunit. The large ribosomal subunit catalyses peptide
bond formation and is responsible for channelling the
nascent proteins through their exit tunnel. The small
ribosomal subunit binds mRNA and is responsible for the
fidelity of translation by ensuring the correct base pairing
between aminoacyl-tRNAs and codons of the mRNA in
the decoding centre [1]. Biochemically, the eukaryotic
ribosome is composed of four ribosomal RNA molecules
and over 70 ribosomal proteins (RPs) [2]. In mammals,
the 60S and 40S subunits are composed of 47 and 32 RPs,
respectively [3]. Each mammalian RP is typically encoded
by a single gene except RPS4 in human [4], and RPS27 in
rat [5] and human [6], which are encoded by two separate
genes. In contrast, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the
78 RPs are encoded by 137 genes, 59 of which are duplicated [7]. In fish, the complete set of RPs in Fugu rubripes
[8] and Ictalurus punctatus [9] has been described. Of the
32 RPs from the 40S subunit, a duplication of RPS27 in
both species and of RPS26 in I. punctatus was observed. In
the 47 RPs from the 60S subunit, all of them but one
(RPL5 in I. punctatus) appeared to have only one type of
mRNA [10].
RPs play a critical role in protein biosynthesis. Cellular
levels change as a function of growth rate in bacteria and
fungi [11-14]. In fish, mRNA levels increase co-ordinately
during embryogenesis and larval development [15-18]. In
mammals, certain tumors have substantially increased
levels of some RP transcripts [19,20]. However, different
RPs have also been associated with various other cellular
processes; the so-called extraribosomal functions. For
example, in Drosophila, mutations in the RPS2 gene
appear to cause arrest of oogenesis [21] and RPS6 functions as a tumor suppressor in the hematopoietic system
[22]. Mammalian RPS3 appears to possess apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity involved in DNA repair
functions [23]. Haploinsufficiency of the RPS4 genes has
been suggested to contribute to anatomic abnormalities
associated with the Turner syndrome in humans [4]. The
gene encoding RPS19 seems to participate in embryogenesis due to its capacity to interact with FGF-2, a factor
involved in the differentiation process of different cell
types [24]. Finally, apoptosis can be induced by inhibiting
or activating expression of RPS3a and RPS27L, respectively [6,25].
Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis (Pleuronectiformes:
Soleidae), and Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus
(Pleuronectiformes: Pleuronectidae), are two commercially important flatfish species. During larval development, both species change from a symmetrical
morphology to an asymmetric, benthic juvenile. This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/107

metamorphic process involves dramatic morphological
and physiological changes. In Senegalese sole, metamorphosis occurs very early during larval development,
between 12 and 19 days after hatching (DAH) [26]. In
Atlantic halibut, metamorphosis begins with the migration of the left eye about 80 DAH [27]. Apoptotic processes induced by thyroxine hormone have been associated
with this tissue remodelling in flatfish [28]. In addition,
Senegalese sole larvae exhibit two different growth rates
during development [26,29]. Because of the key role RPs
play in cellular growth and proliferation and in some
cases apoptosis, it is important to elucidate the expression
pattern of RPs during flatfish development.
RPs are highly represented in cDNA libraries [9,10]. The
development of large-scale genomics on Senegalese sole
and Atlantic halibut has made possible an efficient and
systematic analysis of RP sequences in both species. In this
work, we report the complete set of 32 40S subunit RP
cDNAs for both Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut and
describe their main characteristics. Comparative sequence
analysis revealed the existence of two and four RPS27
genes in Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut, respectively.
Real-time PCR analysis revealed different RP expression
patterns during larval development and in tissues in sole.

Results
Characteristics of the 40S RPs
Sequence analysis of normalized libraries for Senegalese
sole allowed the identification of 31 out of 32 40S subunit
RPs (only RPS28 was absent). RPS28 was obtained from a
premetamorphic stage larval library using specific primers
(Table 1). Overall, 40S RP genes were not highly represented in the normalized libraries accounting for 252
(2.5%) out of the 10,099 good sequences. The number of
clones for each RP ranged between 24 for RPS2 and only
1 for RPS27-2 and RPS29 (Table 2A).

Gene sizes for the complete set of 40S RPs ranged between
279 and 1,043 bp for RPS29 and RPSa, respectively. Only
RPS2, RPS4 and RPS8 had partial sequences missing the
5'-ends. All cDNA sequences have been deposited in the
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ with accession numbers from
AB291554 to AB291586 (Table 2A). Most RPs (63.6%)
used TAA as termination codon. Only RPS8, RPS11,
RPS12, RPS15, RPS17, RPS27-1, RPS28, and RPS29 used
TAG, and RPS6 and RPS24, TGA. The 3'-UTRs were highly
AT-rich. All RPs had a canonical AATAAA polyadenylation
signal between 7–37 nucleotides from the poly(A) tail.
In halibut, sequences for all except RPS29 and RPS27-2
were identified from the Pleurogene database (Table 2B).
In most cases, the complete coding sequences were
obtained, but 3'-end sequencing was performed for all RP
sequences to confirm the 3'ends, particularly of the long

ESTs. The RPS29 and RPS27-2 sequences presented in this
analysis derive from Atlantic halibut ESTs in GenBank
[GenBank:DN792676, GenBank:DN794622]. In addition, only a partial sequence for RPS2 was obtained and
the 5'-end was completed by the addition of an Atlantic
halibut EST in GenBank [GenBank:CF931586]. 108 ESTs
from a total of 12,675 sequences in the database encoded
RPs (0.9%), an indication of the excellent normalization
in these cDNA libraries.
Sizes of coding sequences, 5'- and 3'-UTRs and positions
of polyadenylation signals are given in Table 2B. All RPs
had a single polyadenylation signal with the exception of
RPS20, which had two possible non-canonical sites
(AtTAAA and AATgAA), and RPS23, which had two possible canonical sites. The polyadenylation signal for RPS19
overlapped the stop signal and no polyadenylation signal
could be identified in RPS27-3. As with Senegalese sole,
most 40S subunit RPs used TAA (59%) as a stop codon,
followed by TAG (26%) and TGA (15%) and the 3'-UTRs
were very AT-rich. Two ESTs comprising RPS14 and
RPS27a contigs differed in the lengths of their 5'-UTRs by
over 100 nucleotides due to the presence of unspliced
introns in this region.
Comparison of the Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut
40S subunit RPs
The complete set of 40S RPs in Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut had a high overall similarity (92.1%) as determined by deduced amino acid sequences (Table 3). With

respect to the other species, Senegalese sole overall similarities ranged between 92.8 and 95.4% with human and
F. rubripes, respectively. For halibut, these values were 89.8
and 92.5% with human and F. rubripes, respectively. The
most conserved 40S RPs in the five species (overall mean
>99%) were RPS23 and RPS27a; and the most divergent
ones were RPS30 (86.9%), RPS25 (87.9%), and RPSa
(89.0%).
The number of amino acids was highly conserved
throughout evolution. Of the 32 40S subunit RP cDNAs,
21 had ORFs with identical number of amino acids in the
five species compared; RPS3 and RPS24 showed different
sizes in Atlantic halibut and human. Four RPs had the
same number of amino acids among fish species but different from human (RPS3a, RPS5, RPS10, and RPS17). In
addition, three others varied in more than two species
(RPSa, RPS2, and RPS25) (Table 3). Senegalese sole RPSa
and RPS2 showed the highest differences in size being 18
amino acids longer and 13 amino acids shorter than in
human, respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis of RPS27 genes
Two and four cDNAs encoding RPS27 were found in Senegalese sole (referred to as RPS27-1 and RPS27-2) and
Atlantic halibut (referred to as RPS27-1, RPS27-2, RPS273, and RPS27-4), respectively (Figure 1A). In Senegalese
sole, the total lengths of RPS27-1 and RPS27-2 were 485
and 507 nucleotides (nt), respectively. They were represented by 7 and 1 clones, respectively (Table 2A). In Atlan-

* GenBank sequences comprise final contig

tic halibut, total lengths ranged between 499 and 963 nt
for RPS27-2 and RPS27-3, respectively. The Atlantic halibut RPS27-4 had a slightly shorter coding region (249 nt),
whereas no putative polyadenylation signal could be
identified in RPS27-3. RPS27-1 and RPS27-3 were represented by 4 and 5 clones in the halibut libraries, respectively, and RPS27-4 by only 1 EST.
Both Senegalese sole paralogs showed a high divergence at
the nucleotide level when complete cDNAs (48.4% identity) or coding regions (73.7%) were aligned. At the
amino acid level, they differed in 9 residues with a
sequence identity of 89.3% (Figure 1B; Table 4). Similarly,
low sequence similarity (36.5–49.4%) was detected
among Atlantic halibut full-length sequences. These values ranged between 66.7 (RPS27-1 and RPS27-4) and
82.0% (RPS27-1 and RPS27-3) in the coding regions. At
the protein level, RPS27-4 was 2 amino acids shorter that
the other paralogs. Amino acid similarities ranged
between 74.4 (RPS27-3 and RPS27-4 with 21 amino acid
changes) and 95.2% (RPS27-1 and RPS27-3 with 4 residue differences). Among species, S. senegalensis RPS27-1
and H. hippoglossus RPS27-1 were the closest evolutionary
homologues with 82.5% similarity using full-length
sequence, 92.5% in coding sequence and 100% in amino
acid sequence (Table 4).
A phylogenetic analysis based on RPS27 coding sequences
using the NJ, MP and ML methods showed that fish RPS27
genes grouped mainly in two distinct clades (Figure 2).
Both Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut RPS27-2 genes
clustered with their fish counterparts. The RPS27-4
appeared more closely related to RPS27-2 than the other

two Atlantic halibut RPS27 genes. Moreover, RPS27-2 and
RPS27L genes in rat and human, respectively, formed a
sister clade sharing a common ancestor with fish RPS27-2
genes (bootstrap values higher than 50%). The other fish
RPS27 gene copies appeared linked in a clade that was not
well resolved. Both Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut
RPS27-1 grouped with P. flesus and T. nigroviridis RPS27-1
(bootstrap values higher than 70%). Curiously, this clade
contained both I. punctatus RPS27 genes.
Gene expression analysis
We used a quantitative approach based on reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR amplification to
investigate the steady-state levels of eight sole RP transcripts (RPS2, RPS3a, RPS15, RPS27-1, RPS27-2, RPS27a,
RPS28, and RPS29) in liver, spleen, intestine, stomach,
head kidney, gills, muscle, brain, heart, and skin. Relative
gene expression levels were normalized by measuring
ubiquitin levels.

All eight RP genes were expressed in detectable amounts
in all tissues (Figure 3). RPS2 transcripts were the most
abundant except in brain, where RPS27-1 showed the
highest values (1.82-fold higher than RPS2). On the other
hand, RPS27-2 was expressed at the lowest level in all tissues analyzed.
RP genes were expressed differentially among tissues.
RPS2, RPS15, and RPS28 exhibited lower expression levels in brain and RPS3a transcripts were reduced in brain,
heart, and skin. In contrast, RPS27-2 was expressed more
highly in intestine and stomach, and RPS29 in heart. If we
calculate the mean ribosomal expression ratio as a global

(0.74–0.99) except brain with only 0.48.
We also investigated the expression pattern of RP genes
during sole larval development. mRNA levels were determined in samples extracted from whole larvae pools collected from 2 to 22 DAH (Figure 4). Expression levels of
each RP gene were normalized to that of GAPDH. RPS2,
RPS27-1, RPS27a, RPS28, and RPS29 showed higher transcript levels than RPS3a, RPS15 and RPS27-2 during early
(2 to 3 DAH) larval development in Senegalese sole.

All RP mRNAs increased from 2 to 3 DAH, 24 hours after
first external feeding (2.1-fold as global mean). Fold
induction values ranged between 1.7 for both RPS27-1
and RPS28 and 3.0 for RPS27-2. These levels were reduced
at 9 DAH, two days before the onset of eye migration, with
the lowest values at the first metamorphic stages (13
DAH). The number of mRNA molecules for the 8 RPs analyzed declined approximately 3.5-fold as global mean
from 3 (pre-metamorphosis) to 13 DAH (metamorphosis). The fold reduction values ranged between 1.7 and
10.3 for RPS28 and RPS27-2, respectively. RPS27-1 was
expressed at a higher level than RPS27-2 during all pre-

In fact, concatenation of orthologous RP amino acid

dae and Soleidae species provides new molecular markers
to investigate the taxonomy and phylogeny among Pleuronectiformes. Also, the existence of paralogous genes
exhibiting differential expression patterns in tissues, and
even more important during larval development, particularly in metamorphosis, suggests RPs as interesting molecular markers to investigate flatfish genome evolution in
terms of gain and loss of paralogous genes and the availabilty to acquire new functions (neofunctionalization) or
divide the ancestral function between the paralogs (subfunctionalization) [42,43].

[31]. With regard to this, Pleuronectiformes comprises a
broad taxonomic group with 11 families and about 500
species worldwide, some of them of high commercially
interest both in fisheries and aquaculture [32-34]. All flatfish species share in common an asymmetrical body
development and a bottom-dwelling mode of life. However, their high phenotypic similarity has invoked great
differences in the number and nomenclature of taxa
depending on the relevance assigned to morphologic features [35-38]. Most phylogenetic studies focused on relationships among Pleuronectiformes have been based on
partial mitochondrial DNA sequences [39-41]. The

Three rounds of large-scale gene duplications (referred to
as 1R, 2R, and 3R or fish-specific genome duplication)
have been identified in fish [44,45]. These duplications
are responsible, at least in part, for their speciation, adaptive radiation and high morphological complexity [45].
Although the majority of these gene duplicates have been
lost or silenced during evolution, several gene copies have
been described for some group of genes including glycolytic enzymes [44], Hox genes [46,47] and hormones and
their receptors [48,49]. Similarly, different gene copies
have been described for some RPs. In human, two differ-

ent RPS4 genes exist, one encoded on the X and one on
the Y chromosome. Rat possesses two distinct RPS27 transcripts that are expressed differentially in the hypothalamus [5]. In fish, I. punctatus has two paralogous genes of
RPS26 and RPS27 [9]. In S. senegalensis and H. hippoglossus, two and four different RPS27 genes have been
detected, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
RPS27-1 and RPS27-2 sequences grouped in two separate
clades supported by significant bootstrap values.
Although Thomas et al. [5] proposed the RPS27-2 as a
mammalian-specific isoform, the identification of orthologous sequences for both RPS27 genes in different fish
species supports the hypothesis of at least two RPS27 paralogs as a common feature in fish as well. Moreover, two
additional RPS27 genes (referred to as RPS27-3 and
RPS27-4) were identified in H. hippoglossus. These two paralogous genes might have appeared in the 3R or fish-specific genome duplication, In this respect, we should
highlight that both RPS27 genes in I. punctatus grouped
together in the same clade with S. senegalensis RPS27-1
and H. hippoglossus RPS27-1 and RPS27-3. This clustering
suggests the existence of, at least, a third RPS27 gene in I.
punctatus orthologous to fish RPS27-2. Such a hypothesis
is also supported by the fact that both I. punctatus RPS27
paralogs were expressed at a similar level (represented by
7 and 10 clones for RPS27-1 and RPS27-2, respectively)
[9], whereas in S. senegalensis RPS27-2 was expressed at a
much lower level than RPS27-1 in all tissues and during
larval development as determined by real-time PCR.
During embryogenesis, after mid-blastula transition in
zebrafish, RP genes co-ordinately increase their expression
[16-18]. In addition, in Atlantic halibut up to 40 and 41
RPs increase mRNA levels from embryos to 1 day-old yolk
sac larvae and fast skeletal muscle in juveniles, respectively [15]. In this study, we provide evidence that one day
after first feeding, the eight RPs analyzed by real-time PCR
increase their expression levels in Senegalese sole also.
During this period, larvae undergo important physiological and morphological changes such as the opening of the
mouth and anus. When live prey are provided for feeding,
different organs such as the liver, pancreas, and the digestive tract are activated, promoting larval metabolism [50].
Larval rearing is a critical period during which different
aspects concerning important anatomical and physiological traits in the juvenile stage are modulated. There are
reports on biomarkers for fish larvae fed different diets
that focused specifically on oxidative stress [51] and digestive enzymes [52]. The co-ordinate changes in RP expression under important physiological events such as the first
feeding suggest RPs might be considered as biomarkers
that could provide broader information about the general
physiological condition in fish. In addition, the high
abundance of these RPs (about 50% of RNA polymerase
II transcription in rapidly growing yeast cells [53]), most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/107

of which are considered as house-keeping genes, indicates
that even small induction values, as observed in this survey (1.7–3.0 fold), can play an important physiological
role.
Although RP transcript levels increased after first feeding,
they dropped at the first metamorphic stages (13 DAH).
In this respect, we should take into account that Senegalese sole exhibits two different growth rates during larval
development. At pre-metamorphosis, larvae grow at
almost twice the rate as at metamorphosis and accumulate
energy reserves in tissues to be used during this important
period [26,29]. The lower growth rate at metamorphosis
has been correlated with reduced IGF-II expression levels
[54], an activator of the 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase
(S6K1), a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a central role in cell growth and proliferation. This kinase
mediates the phosphorylation of RPS6, thereby enabling
efficient translation of 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine tract
(5'-TOP) mRNAs. Since RPs and translation elongation
factors are encoded by 5'-TOP mRNAs, signalling along
the S6K1 pathway may regulate ribosome biogenesis and
therefore the response to growth conditions [55,56].
Moreover, apoptosis has been shown to play an important role in the organ-rebuilding process during flatfish
metamorphosis [57] and some RPs have been associated
with apoptotic processes [25,58]. The reduction in RP
gene expression, especially at the beginning of sole metamorphosis, suggests they could also be involved in the
control of apoptosis during metamorphosis.
We evaluated gene expression of eight RPs in ten different
sole tissues. Overall, all tissues except brain expressed RPs
at a similar level. These data agree with those obtained in
I. punctatus using a transcriptomic approach. Representation of RPs was reduced in brain compared with skin and
head kidney [9]. Ribosome formation can vary in
response to cellular demands and their protein biosynthetic requirements [59] and these differences in the
steady-state number of RP transcripts might reflect the distinct metabolic activity of tissues.
RPs exhibited different expression levels in different sole
tissues. RPS27-2 mRNA levels were up to 41.9 and 54.7fold lower than RPS27-1 and RPS2, respectively. These differences in relative mRNA abundance among RPs were
also observed in I. punctatus and H. hippoglossus larvae and
juveniles [9,15]. Such difference suggests a translational
regulation to facilitate the correct assembly of ribosomes.
Moreover, there is increasing evidence that RPs modulate
a variety of cellular activities independent of their own
involvement in the protein biosynthesis such as replication, transcription, RNA processing, DNA repair, and
inflammation [60]. In our study, some RPs exhibited different tissue expression patterns. For instance, RPS2 was

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:107

highly expressed in all tissues except in brain where
RPS27-1 transcripts were the highest. These data agree
with those described for I. punctatus where the number of
ESTs corresponding to RPS2 and RPS27 were 10-fold
lower and 3-fold higher, respectively, in brain than in skin
and head kidney [9]. In addition, RPS3a transcripts were
reduced in brain, heart, and skin, and RPS27-2 showed
the highest expression levels in intestine and stomach. All
these data underscore the necessity for new studies to elucidate the regulation of these RPs in tissues and their possible extraribosomal function.

Conclusion
In this work we have identified and characterized the
complete set of 40S RPs in two Pleuronectiformes: Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut. These data provide new
molecular markers to investigate genome evolution and
phylogenetic relationships among flatfish. Also, gene
expression studies in Senegalese sole have revealed a coordinate response after first feeding in larvae suggesting a
possible role of RPs as general condition biomarkers to
estimate larval physiological status in response to changing environmental conditions. Moreover, the differential
expression patterns in tissues suggest that RPs might perform other functions distinct from protein biosynthesis.

Methods
Identification of RP cDNAs in Senegalese sole and Atlantic
halibut
Ten cDNA libraries were constructed from different larval
stages and adult tissues of Senegalese sole using the ZAP
Express® cDNA Syntesis kit and Zap Express cDNA Gigapack® III Gold Cloning kit (Stratagene) following the
manufacturer's protocol (Cerdà et al., in preparation). The
libraries were pooled and normalized, and approximately
11,000 randomly selected clones were sequenced from
the 3'-end. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) encoding RPs
were identified after EST annotation. For RPS28 isolation,
we designed specific primers (Table 1) using a partial
sequence from a suppression subtractive hybridization
library. RPS28 was amplified from the premetamorphic
larval development library using combination of specific
primers and the universal primers T3 and T7.

In halibut, normalised cDNA libraries were constructed
for five different larval time points (hatching, mouthopening, midway to metamorphosis, premetamorphosis,
and postmetamorphosis) and eight adult tissues (testis,
ovary, liver, head kidney, spleen, skin, gill, and intestine)
[61], incorporated into the Pleurogene database http://
www.pleurogene.ca and provisionally annotated using
AUTOFACT [62] implemented on the database.

Fish sampling
Juvenile Senegalese sole individuals (n = 3) were obtained
from IFAPA Centro El Toruño facilities (El Puerto Santa
María, Cádiz, Spain). They were sacrificed by immersion
in tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222). Liver, spleen,
intestine, stomach, head kidney, gills, muscle, brain,
heart, and skin were rapidly dissected, frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use.

For larval studies, fertilized eggs from a naturally spawning Senegalese sole broodstock (IFAPA Centro El Toruño)
were collected. They were incubated in a 150 L tank at 19–
21°C for two days. Newly hatched larvae were transferred
to a 400 L tank at an initial density from 45 to 50 larvae L1 with a 16L:8D photoperiod and a light intensity of 600–
800 lux. Larvae were fed rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) 3
DAH till 9 DAH. From 7 DAH enriched artemia metanauplii were fed until the end of the experiment. Pools of larvae from 2 to 22 DAH (n = 3) were collected, washed with
DEPC water, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C
until analysis.
RNA isolation and gene expression analysis
Homogenization of juvenile tissues and larvae was carried
out using Lysing Matrix D (Q-BioGene) for 40 s at speed
setting 6 in the Fastprep FG120 instrument (Bio101).
Total RNA was isolated from 50 mg of S. senegalensis tissues or pools of larvae using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). All RNA isolation procedures were performed in
accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. In all cases,
total RNA was treated twice with DNase I using the RNaseFree DNase kit (Qiagen) for 30 min in order to avoid
amplification of contaminated genomic DNA. RNA sample quality was checked using Experion (Bio-Rad) and
quantification was performed spectrophotometrically.
Total RNA (1 µg) from each sample was reverse-transcribed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad).
Reverse transcription reactions were performed in duplicate. Lack of genomic DNA contamination was confirmed
by PCR amplification of RNA samples in the absence of
cDNA synthesis.

Real-time analysis was carried out on an iCycler (BioRad). Reactions were performed in a 25 µl volume containing cDNA generated from 10 ng of original RNA template, 300 nM each of specific forward (F) and reverse (R)
primers (Table 1), and 12.5 µl of iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Matching oligonucleotide primers were
designed using Oligo v6.89 software (Medprobe). The
amplification protocol used was as follows: initial 7 min
denaturation and enzyme activation at 95°C, 40 cycles of
95°C for 15 s and 70°C for 30 s. Each assay was performed in duplicate. For normalization of cDNA loading,
all samples were run in parallel with a housekeeping gene
(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH;

[DDBJ:AB291587]) or ubiquitin ([DDBJ:AB291588]) for
larval development or juvenile tissues, respectively). To
estimate efficiencies, a standard curve was generated for
each primer pair based on known quantities of cDNA (10fold serial dilutions corresponding to cDNA transcribed
from 100 to 0.01 ng of total RNA). All calibration curves
exhibited correlation coefficients higher than 0.99 and the
corresponding real-time PCR efficiencies were 0.90–0.95.
Relative mRNA expression of RPs was determined using
the Ct method (value obtained by subtracting the Ct value
of GAPDH or ubiquitin mRNA from the Ct value of the
target mRNA). Data was expressed as the ratio (calculated
using 1.93-(∆Ct)) of target mRNA to reference (GAPDH or
ubiquitin) mRNA. Owing to the small differences among
amplicons both in size (87–139 bp) and %GC (45.4–
65.4), the relative sensitivity factor KRS was assumed to be
one.

Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. Comparisons
among groups were performed with one-way analysis of
variance, followed by a Tukey test for identification of the
statistically distinct groups. Significance was accepted for
P < 0.05.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Alignments of sequences were carried out and the
sequence similarities calculated by the MegAlign program
from the LASERGENE software suite. For phylogenetic
analysis, sequences of RPS27 from different species
including Homo sapiens ([GenBank:HSU57847, GenBank:NM_015920]; [6,63]), Rattus norvegicus ([GenBank:AF184893, EMBL:X59375]; [5,64]), Xenopus laevis
([GenBank:BC053815]; [65]), Ictalurus punctatus ([GenBank:AF402836, GenBank:AF402837]; [9]), Platichthys
flesus ([GenBank:DV566302 and GenBank:DV567451];
unpublished), Danio rerio ([GenBank:BQ077524, GenBank:BC114281]; unpublished) and Tetraodon nigroviridis
([EMBL:CR722207 and EMBL:CR642405]; unpublished)
were employed. Coding sequences were aligned using
MegAlign software. Neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum
parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses
were carried out using PAUPv4beta10 software [66]. The
TrNef + G model of sequence evolution was the most
appropriate as selected by MODELTEST v3.5 [67]. The
parameters of ML methods were R(a) = 1.0000, R(b) =
3.2865, R(c) = 1.0000, R(d) = 1.0000, and R(e) = 6.057.
The gamma distribution shape parameter was estimated
to be 0.3234. The degree of confidence assigned to nodes
in trees was achieved by bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates.
