Abstract
Background: Mesoamerica is one of the world's most complex biogeographical regions, mostly due to its complex
geological history. This complexity has led to interesting biogeographical processes that have resulted in the current
diversity and distribution of fauna in the region. The fish genus Astyanax represents a useful model to assess
biogeographical hypotheses due to it being one of the most diverse and widely distributed freshwater fish species in the
New World. We used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to evaluate phylogenetic relationships within the genus in
Mesoamerica, and to develop historical biogeographical hypotheses to explain its current distribution.
Results: Analysis of the entire mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) gene in 208 individuals from 147 localities and of a
subset of individuals for three mitochondrial genes (Cytb, 16 S, and COI) and a single nuclear gene (RAG1) yielded similar
topologies, recovering six major groups with significant phylogeographic structure. Populations from North America and
Upper Central America formed a monophyletic group, while Middle Central America showed evidence of rapid radiation
with incompletely resolved relationships. Lower Central America lineages showed a fragmented structure, with
geographically restricted taxa showing high levels of molecular divergence. All Bramocharax samples grouped with their
sympatric Astyanax lineages (in some cases even with allopatric Astyanax populations), with less than 1% divergence
between them. These results suggest a homoplasic nature to the trophic specializations associated with Bramocharax
ecomorphs, which seem to have arisen independently in different Astyanax lineages. We observed higher taxonomic
diversity compared to previous phylogenetic studies of the Astyanax genus. Colonization of Mesoamerica by Astyanax
before the final closure of the Isthmus of Panama (3.3 Mya) explains the deep level of divergence detected in Lower
Central America. The colonization of Upper Mesoamerica apparently occurred by two independent routes, with lineage
turnover over a large part of the region.
Conclusion: Our results support multiple, independent origins of morphological traits in Astyanax, whereby the
morphotype associated with Bramocharax represents a recurrent trophic adaptation. Molecular clock estimates indicate
that Astyanax was present in Mesoamerica during the Miocene (~8 Mya), which implies the existence of an incipient landbridge connecting South America and Central America before the final closure of the Isthmus of Panama (~3.3 Mya).

Background
Mesoamerica is one of the most complex biogeographical
areas in the world [1-5]. This complexity reflects the confluence of Neotropical and Nearctic biotas and a long history of geological activity, stretching from the Miocene to
the present, during which movements of the Cocos, North
American, Pacific and Caribbean Plates [6,7] created barriers and land-bridges that have affected the distribution
of freshwater fishes [8-13]. For example, the Pliocene
(~3.3 Mya) closure of the Panama Strait has been postulated to be one of the most important causes of faunal
interchange between Neartic and Neotropical regions
[14]. Climatic changes have also been invoked to explain
the distribution of Mesoamerican fish fauna [15]. Distinguishing between climatic and geological effects requires
information on phylogeny and species boundaries in a
diversity of taxa [8,9,16-19].
Special attention has been devoted to understanding the
number and timing of colonizations of Mesoamerica by
freshwater fishes from South America: a topic which
remains somewhat controversial [8,13,20-22]. The most
widely accepted theories support two waves of colonization: 1) an ancient episode (70 – 80 Mya) through a
proto-Antillean arc and 2) a more recent, Cenozoic episode via the Antillean islands and/or a continental corridor [14,23,24]. Molecular data suggest colonization of
Mesoamerica by primary freshwater fishes about 4–7 Mya
[8,12,13,22]. This is incongruent with the geological data,
which does not support the existence of a continental
land-bridge before the closure of the Panama Strait (3.3
Mya). Older colonization events have been postulated for
secondary freshwater fishes: for example, Early to Mid
Miocene (12.7–23 Mya) colonization for Synbranchidae
[13], 14–24 Mya for heroinid cichlids (10 Mya for Mesoamerican lineages) and 18.4–20 Mya for rivulids [22].
The absence of primary freshwater genera (e.g.,
Hypopomus, Pimelodella, Rhamdia and Roeboides) from Mesoamerica and the Antillean islands argues against an
ancient colonization route through a proto-Antillean arc.
Instead, it supports a colonization route through an incipient land-bridge formed during the gradual uplifting of
the Panama Isthmus [8,12], over a time span of 3–20
Mya, combined with changes in sea level [25]. This is supported by molecular studies of arthropods [26], amphibians [27], and marine geminate species pairs on either side
of the Panamanian Isthmus [28].
Support for a more recent colonization of Mesoamerica
by primary freshwater fish through the Panama Strait
comes from phylogeographical studies of Characids (e.g.,
Brycon, Bryconamericus, Eretmobrycon, and Cyphocharax).
These studies indicate multiple waves of rapid expansion
from South America during the Pliocene ~3.3 Mya. [15].

The genus Astyanax provides an ideal model to investigate
the relative importance of vicariance and dispersal on biogeographical patterns. This is partly because it is widely
distributed across the region [29], and because its dispersal is confined to freshwater routes and dependent, therefore, on the formation of land-bridges.
Characiforms are generally assumed to have a Gondwanan (South American) origin [30-32], as supported by the
fossil record [33], so the presence of Characidae in Northern America is viewed as a consequence of dispersal.
Astyanax comprises more than 107 recognized species and
is, together with Hyphesobrycon (105 species), the largest
and most diverse characiform genus [34,35]. Moreover,
Astyanax has the widest distribution of American characids, being found from the Nearctic (Colorado River in
Texas and New Mexico) to the Neotropics (Negro River in
Patagonia) [4].
Previous phylogenetic studies [36,37] of the biogeography of Astyanax used a small number of samples from
Mexico, Belize and Guatemala, and did not find geographical congruence for some of the groups recovered
(i.e. Yucatan and Belizean populations were not the most
closely related despite their geographical proximity). Furthermore, conspecific cave and nearest surface populations formed two separate lineages, in agreement with an
earlier study of the genus [38]. This was attributed to at
least two separate colonizations of Mesoamerica from
South America during the Pleistocene. Estimated colonization times based on the cytochrome b gene were 1.8 and
4.5 Mya (3.1 Mya), with an estimated divergence rate of
1.5% per pairwise comparison per million years, which
coincides with the closure of the Panama Strait (3.3 Mya)
[37]. However, incomplete sampling (only few samples
were included from upper Central America and Mexico)
could lead to erroneous interpretations. This study provides a phylogeographical analysis based on a comprehensive distribution-wide sampling regime and more
extensive sampling, and thus should provide new insights
into the evolutionary history of the genus.
The genus Astyanax is characterised by high phenotypic
plasticity and a capacity to adapt to diverse habitats
[36,38-41]. There is clear evidence of extremely rapid
adaptations of fish to new habitats and environments,
with ecological specialization and morphological differentiation, generally in accordance with genetic divergence
[15,42-44]. Considerable attention has been given to the
evolution of developmental mechanisms and adaptation
to cave environments [36,38,39], but less attention has
been given to other habitat associated morphological
plasticity. In this regard, Bramocharax, which is sympatric
with Astyanax, is characterized by conspicuous trophic

specializations, including differences in the number of
premaxillary teeth, the presence of diastemas on the maxillary teeth, as well as differences in the shape and number
of cuspids on the premaxillary, maxillary and dentary
teeth, with some species (B. caballeroi and B.baileyi) having intermediate states between the morphotypes of Astyanax and Bramocharax species [45-47].

was based on the topology obtained with the combined
data set.

In this study we used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
sequences to develop a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for
Astyanax and Bramocharax. This allows us to test biogeographical hypotheses for the Mesoamerican fish fauna,
including the relative importance of historical geology
and climatic factors.

We identified six major phylogenetic groupings with high
bootstrap support and significant posterior probabilities
(Figures 1 and 2). Percentage divergences between groupings are given in Table 2. Groups V and VI correspond to
the Chagres region (Panama) and Lagarto-Puntarenas
basins of Costa Rica in Lower Central America, respectively. Groups II to IV are from Middle Central America
and Group I is from Upper Central America and Mexico.
These groups are non-overlapping geographically except
for I with II and II with III (see phylogenetic Clades
scheme in Additional file 1). Their inter-relationships
were not resolved with either the Cytb or the combined
data set (3.8 Kbp).

Results
Three mitochondrial (Cytb, COI and 16 S) genes and one
nuclear gene (RAG-1) were sequenced, giving a total of
3862 characters (2350 mitochondrial and 1512 nuclear).
RAG-1 was the most conservative of the genes analyzed
(Table 1). Among the mitochondrial DNA genes, Cytb was
the most variable, with COI exhibiting similarly high levels of variability and 16 s being the least variable. For the
joint mitochondrial and nuclear analysis, 931 sites were
variable, with 448 (~11%) being parsimony informative.
The topologies recovered by Maximum Parsimony (MP)
and Bayesian Inference (BI) for the Cytb data set (Figure 1)
and combined data set were similar. In addition, Cytb and
the combined data set analyses were also concordant,
with discrepancies restricted to the tree topologies in
Clades III and IV from Group I (the Maquinas population
was grouped with Montebello in the Cytb topology but
with Polochic-Grijalva-Usumacinta with the combined
data set). The combined data matrix was useful to resolve
the deeper nodes and recovered mostly higher support
values, providing greater phylogenetic resolution. For this
reason, description of the higher-level groups identified

All analyses supported the polyphyly of Bramocharax, with
species of Bramocharax being sister groups to different
clades of Astyanax (Figure 1), making Astyanax paraphyletic.

Geographic structuring within the major phylogenetic
groupings
GROUP I (Mexico and Upper Central America)
Four main clades were recovered from Group I. Clade I
comprised most of the Mexican and Upper Central American (Guatemala and Belize) populations. Clades II-IV
represented fewer populations with a patchy distribution
over the range of Clade I.

Within Clade I we found geographical structure corresponding to the following four lineages: Lineage Id, from
the Chiapas region of Mexico, was sister to a clade comprising Lineage Ie from the Candelaria region and a pair
of sister lineages (1a and 1b) that occupy a wider region
from the Yucatan Peninsula to the Bravo-Conchos basin.

Sampling sites
Sampling sites. Map of the sampled localities in Mesoamerica. The six major groups obtained in our phylogenetic analyses are
represented by different colours. Stars represent the localities or basins where we found different lineages in sympatry.

Lineage Ia contained individuals of A. mexicanus and the
troglobitic species A. jordani from northern Mexico. This
lineage was subdivided in two sublineages. The first
included samples from Bravo-Conchos basin in the northern-most part of the range of Astyanax, and the basins of
Mezquital and Nazas – Aguanaval. The second sublineage
grouped populations from the Panuco, Tuxpan, Nautla
and San Fernando-Soto La Marina basins, including most
troglobitic populations from the Huasteca region (see
region A in the Figure 3). Therefore, this latter sublineage
included A. mexicanus and the cave-dwelling nominal species, A. jordani.
Lineage Ib contains Astyanax and Bramocharax from southern TMVB and Belize. It is subdivided into four sublineages. It ranges from the Media Luna Lagoon (Panuco
basin, Mexico) to the Mopan Basin (Belize) on the Atlan-

tic slope, and from the Armeria – Coahuayana Basin to the
Balsas Basin (both in Mexico) on the Pacific slope. This
group is a good example of morphological plasticity with
low levels of genetic differentiation (see further details in
Additional file 2).
The first sublineage included Astyanax fasciatus from
Puente Nacional to Grijalva – Usumacinta basins (including Papaloapan and Coatzacoalcos basins) on the Atlantic
slope, and populations from the type localities of A.
armandoi and A. altior (Palenque in the Grijalva – Usumacinta basin and Cenote of Noc-Ac in the Yucatan
Peninsula, respectively). Both of these are junior synonyms of A. fasciatus [35,48]. We also found shared haplotypes or low divergence (see Additional file 2) between
Bramocharax caballeroi and sympatric A. fasciatus from
Lake Catemaco (see region C, Los Tuxtlas, Figure 4). Addi-

tionally these distances were lower than those observed
within Astyanax populations.
The second sublineage (Catemaco) was a shallow clade
restricted to the Tuxtlas region (lakes Chalchoapan and
Catemaco, Figure 3), and comprised morphotypes of A.
fasciatus and B. caballeroi, with very low genetic distinctiveness with haplotypes shared in some cases (Figures 1 and
2, see also Additional file 2). The third sublineage
included A. fasciatus, mostly from the Pacific slope (Coahuayana to Balsas basins), and one single population of
A. mexicanus from the Media Luna Lagoon basin on the
Atlantic slope (Figure 3). The fourth sublineage ('Yucatan
Peninsula', Figure 1) included A. fasciatus from GrijalvaUsumacinta (Candelaria River), Cenotes from Yucatan
Peninsula, Belize and Nuevo basins (Belize) and Mopan
basin (Guatemala).
Lineage Ic, (region D, Figure 3) comprised populations
from the Atlantic slope: Astyanax fasciatus (a synonym of
A. mexicanus sensu Lima et al. [35]) from the type locality
of A. petenensis (Peten – Itza Lake, Yucatan Peninsula) and
A. fasciatus from the Candelaria karst region in Guatemala. This lineage included Bramocharax dorioni from its
type locality (Semococh river). Similar to other instances
of sympatry between Bramocharax and Astyanax, these two
morphotypes showed low levels of genetic differentiation
(less 0.5%, see Additional file 3).
Lineage Id (Chiapas) grouped Pacific slope populations of
A. fasciatus (Figure 1) from the Pichoacan basin (Oaxaca,
Mexico) to the El Jococal Lagoon (El Salvador), including
the Guatemalan coast, with very low genetic divergence
within the clade.
Clade II comprised two lineages. (Ie and If; mean divergence of D K 81uf = 2.13% ± 1.21). Lineage Ie (referred to
as "Sabinos-Aguanaval-Mezquital") grouped troglobitic
morphotypes (A. jordani) from the Piedras, Tinaja, La
Curva, and Sabinos caves (type locality of A. hubbsi, synonym of A. jordani sensu Lima et al. [35]) with the surfacedwelling populations of A. mexicanus from the Mezquital

and Nazas – Aguanaval basins, with a low level of differentiation between surface and cave populations (mean of

D K 81uf = 1.4% ± 0.9).
Lineage If included populations of A. mexicanus from the
Rascon valley and the Panuco basin in Tamposa. This lineage was highly divergent with regard to the rest of the lineages in this group, and those populations closest
geographically (see Additional file 2)
Clade III grouped Atlantic slope populations of A. fasciatus
from the La Palma and Maquinas basins (see Los Tuxtlas
region, Figure 3) with those from the upper Polochic
basin (Cahabon river) and the Grijalva-Usumacinta
basin.
Clade IV contained populations from the Montebello
Lagoons (Montebello) in south-eastern Mexico. This
group clustered with the Maquinas and La Palma populations in the analysis of Cytb alone, but this clustering was
not supported by the combined nuclear and mitochondrial analysis (Figures 2 and 4).
GROUP II (Middle Central America)
Our analyses did not resolve relationships among the five
main clades recovered within Group II. This group occurs
widely over Middle Central America, ranging from Belize
to Nicaragua and Costa Rica (E, Figure 3).

Clade V included A. fasciatus from the Macal Basin
(Belize). It is highly divergent with respect to the other
clades from Group II (DK81uf = 3.6% ± 1.39).
Clade VI ("Belize-Polochic-Motagua") includes Atlantic
slope A. fasciatus from the Moho basin (Belize), and from
Guatemala, downstream of the Polochic Basin to the
Puente Virginia Basin (Figure 5).
Clade VII comprised two lineages (IIa and IIb). Lineage IIa
included Astyanax nicaraguensis and Bramocharax bransfordii. As in other clades containing both morphotypes there
were low levels of genetic differentiation (DK81uf = 0.9% ±
0.61). This lineage occurs from the Jigüina Basin to the
Sarapiqui basin (Nicaragua) on the Atlantic slope, and
included populations from the great Lakes of Nicaragua
(Managua and Nicaragua, region E, figures 1 and 4) and
the Senacapa and Brito basins (Nicaragua) on the Pacific
slope. Lineage IIb included A. fasciatus from Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan basin (Nicaragua), as well as the Barbilla and Reventaza basins on the Atlantic slope of Costa
Rica.
Clade VIII included A. fasciatus from the Pacific tributaries
of Nicaragua and A. nasutus from the Managua Lake Basin.

comprising the Ciruelas and Tempisque basins on the
Pacific slope of Costa Rica ("Ciruelas-Tempisque", Figure
5).

taxonomic utility of trophic characters (e.g., teeth shape or
jaw modification), as previously done by Rosen [47] on
the basis of intermediate morphological states between
Astyanax fasciatus and Bramocharax baileyi.

Lower Central America
Four major groups (groups III-VI) in Lower Central America were characterized by more restricted ranges relative to
Groups I and II. Group III comprised A. fasciatus populations from the Ciruelas and Chires basins on the Pacific
Slope of Costa Rica (figures 1 and 2). Two highly divergent (DK81uf = 2.5%) haplotypes (corresponding to
Groups II and III) were found in sympatry in the Ciruelas
basin (figures 1 and 2).

Further incidences of morphological convergence were
found in troglobitic morphotypes of Astyanax jordani (this
has been noted by previous authors [37,38,50]), providing further evidence of independent (at least two different
times, see Figure 6) adaptation to troglobitic habitats. The
presence of recurrent morphological convergence in Astyanax [50,51] makes the delimitation of species and genera
difficult. Thus the absence of congruence between phylogenetic relationships uncovered in this study and previous
taxonomic classifications for Astyanax and Bramocharax
from Mesoamerica [35,37,52] is not surprising. In addition, our results are not in agreement with the idea that
Astyanax (including samples from Mexico and Upper Central America) is a single species (i.e., A. fasciatus) as has
previously proposed [37].

Group IV included a single and well-differentiated population of A. orthodus from the Sixaola basin on the Atlantic
slope of Costa Rica. Group V contained Pacific slope A.
fasciatus populations from the Puntarenas basin (Costa
Rica) to the Lagarto basin on the Panama-Costa Rica border. Group VI included A. fasciatus from the Chagres
region on the Atlantic slope of Panama.

Discussion and conclusion
Systematics of the genera Astyanax and Bramocharax
Our analyses do not support the previously proposed
monophyly of Bramocharax based on morphological analyses [45-47]. Moreover, Bramocharax specimens were
present in two of the seven major Astyanax clades, with
low levels of genetic differentiation when both morphotypes were found in sympatry (such as in lake Catemaco
where it was possible to find haplotypes shared between
individuals from both genera). Differentiation was
equally reduced between allopatric populations of Bramocharax and Astyanax.

The genus Astyanax has been considered to be monophyletic in Mesoamerica [37], but polyphyletic in South
America [30] on the basis of molecular analyses. Our
results support the monophyly of Mesoamerican Astyanax
only if we consider Bramocharax species to be morphotypes of Astyanax within the range of its phenotypic plasticity. This hypothesis is supported by the low genetic
divergence between specimens of Bramocharax and Astyanax, and the evidence of recurrent evolution of the
Bramocharax morphotype within Astyanax (Figure 3). This
morphotype is associated with lacustrine habitats, suggesting that its recurrent evolution is a result of morphological convergence to similar ecological factors; similar
patterns have been shown in other freshwater fishes
[37,38,41,45,49]. If the "recurrent convergence" hypothesis is considered to be correct, then the taxonomy of
Bramocharax needs to be revised and the evolutionary
mechanisms giving rise to these morphological homoplasies need further investigation. Our analyses question the

Although not a main goal of this study, we propose a provisional taxonomic nomenclature for Astyanax populations from Mesoamerica (see Additional file 3). The
nomenclature proposed is based on well-defined monophyletic groups, high genetic divergences with Cytb (>2%
K81uf), and in agreement with geographical distributions.
In ascribing species names we gave priority to previous
species descriptions and diagnostic morphological traits.
Where monophyletic lineages could not be assigned to a
valid species name, they were assigned to their own
monophyletic group as Astyanax sp.
Genetic and Time Divergences
The penalized likelihood analyses performed in r8s for
Cytb sequences was calibrated using the following events:
1) the Merida-Perija uplift about 8–12 Mya, 2) the presence of fossils of Colossoma macropomum in the Magdalena
basin (from at least 15 Mya), and 3) the formation of the
TMVB about 3–6 Mya (Figure 6) [53]. The analysis gave an
average divergence rate of 0.8% per million years with our
in-group and the K81uf model of evolution (Figure 6).
While this is similar to divergence rates reported for other
fishes [Cichlidae (0.7%), [22], Cobitidae (0.68%) [54]
(Table 3) and slightly lower than in cyprinid fishes
(1.05%) [38], it is much lower than previous molecular
clock rates (using fragments from the same gene) proposed for Astyanax (1.5% K2P divergences) [37]. This difference in estimated divergence rate is partially the cause
of discrepancies between our study and previous historical biogeographical interpretations for Astyanax [37].
Biogeographical implications
We found a pattern of north-south phylogeographical
structuring. The major phylogenetic groups were mostly

non-overlapping, with the exception of Groups I and II,
which overlap in the upper part of the Polochic basin of
Guatemala, and Groups II and III, which overlap in the
Ciruelas basin of Costa Rica. This north-south pattern is
similar to that reported for other freshwater fishes
[12,13,22]. We explain the observation of sympatric lineages of Astyanax in terms of niche overlap and lineage
turnover, similar to that proposed in biogeographical
models for other characins in Mesoamerica [15].
The lack of phylogenetic structuring in Astyanax in Middle
Central America (even with the subset of data 3.8 Kbp)
can be explained by a more recent colonization and rapid
radiation about 6.9 Mya (Table 4); this pattern has been
previously observed in other freshwater fishes of the
region [12,13,15,22,55].
Dispersal hypothesis on the origin of genus Astyanax in
Mesoamerica
We accept the widely held hypothesis of a South American
origin for Astyanax and other Central American characids
[15,30,33]. This is supported by the observation that
Lower Central America lineages were most closely related
to South American samples from Brazil and Argentina.
Considering the widely used Cytb calibration rate for fish
(1.09%/my HKY distances) [22,38,54] and our mean rate
of 0.8%/my K81uf distances from R8s (Figure 6 and Table
4), levels of divergence for populations of South and Central America imply a period of Mesoamerican colonization/expansion of Astyanax from South America about
7.8–8.1 Mya, before the final uplift of the Isthmus of Pan-

ama ~3.3 Mya [7,20,56]. The inclusion of more Astyanax
samples from both sides of the Sierra de Perija and Merida
Andes in further studies could improve this dating scenario.
The colonization of Central America prior to Late Cenozoic closure of the Panama Strait is incongruent with the
geological data, and with other studies of characid genera
(Brycon, Bryconamericus, Eretmobrycon and Cyphocharax)
[15], including a previous study of Astyanax [37], all of
which propose that closure of the strait ~3.3 Mya provided
the first opportunity for colonization of Central America
from South America.
An earlier colonization of Mesoamerica has been proposed for other freshwater fishes (Table 3) [[8,12], [13],
[22]]. For example, ancient colonization events have been
proposed for the family Poeciliidae (Cretaceous – Rosen
model [23]) [57] and the Cichlidae, Rivulidae and Synbranchidae families (Miocene – GAARlandia model as
proposed by Iturralde-Vinent and MacPhee [7])
[8,12,13,22]. However in contrast with Astyanax, these
families also occur in the Caribbean islands, and as secondary fishes could have crossed through a shallow passage between South America and Central America during
the Miocene [13,20,22].
Divergence times similar to those found in this study have
been reported in molecular studies of primary freshwater
fauna [8,12]. For example, the Bermingham and Martin
model [8] proposes a colonization of Mesoamerica

between 4 and 7 Mya, prior to the final closure of the Panama Isthmus (~3.3 Mya), based on comparative phylogeography of three genera [Roeboides (Characidae),
Pimelodella (Pimelodidae) and Hypopomus (Hypopomidae)] Moreover, Rhamdia seems to have colonized Mesoamerica in two different waves, one prior to the closure of
the Panama Strait (6.5 to 5.6 Mya, R. laticauda group)
[12]. These estimates are in agreement with our study, and
coincident with other primary and secondary freshwater
fish fauna [12,13,22], as well as divergence times for
invertebrates (9 Mya in pseudoscorpions) [26] and benthic foraminifera fossils (8 Mya) [58].
We found evidence of a unique biogeographical pattern
involving multiple waves of expansion of Group I (Clades
II – V) Astyanax in the upper part of the Polochic-Motagua
fault (Mexico and Chiapas region). These clades have a
restricted distribution overlapping that of Clade I, and in
general occupy relatively stable ecological environments
(springs or lakes), which can be less affected by climate
change. Niche overlap and lineage turnover could explain
this pattern, except in stable habitats where two lineages
are found in sympatry (lineages Ia of Clade I and the lineage of Clade II in the Huasteca region, and in the
Mezquital and Nazas-Aguanaval basin).
Main vicariant events in Astyanax populations from
Mesoamerica
The vicariance events involving Astyanax in Mesoamerica
occurred during the Plio-Miocene (4–8 Mya), occurring
earlier in Lower Central America (Panama and mainly
Costa Rica) than in Central and Upper Mesoamerica.

A pattern of restricted geographic ranges in Lower Central
America (Groups IV-VI) supports pronounced geographical fragmentation as a consequence of tectonics movements [7,20], which eventually resulted in closure of the
Panama Strait ~3.3 Mya. Bermingham and Martin [8]
have implicated multiple range fragmentation during the
Miocene in patterns of diversity in other taxa of the primary freshwater fauna. With our data, five main vicariant
events were identified for Lower Central America (Figure
6). These are related to changes in eustatic sea level (5–8
Mya) [25] and to the formation of inter-oceanic biogeographical barriers [58] during the Middle-Late Miocene (8
Mya).
In Upper Central America, the main volcanic activity was
produced by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB).
This region was affected by periods of intense geological
activity between 3 and 12 Mya, with some volcanic activity still occurring today [53,59,60]. The geographic structuring evident in Clade I of Astyanax indicates that the
TMVB formed an effective geographic barrier during its
development during the late Miocene 4 – 6 Mya (Figure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/340

6). This date is in agreement with the geology of the
region and previous studies of several groups of vertebrates [1,5,10,11,61,62].
Other biogeographical patterns
Other biogeographical patterns were obtained in Lower
and Middle Central America. These cannot be explained
by geological barriers, but are in accordance with the main
biogeographical regions proposed for other freshwater
fishes [15,22,63].

While our results contrast somewhat with the Mesoamerican faunal regions recognized by Bussing [14], they do
support his Isthmian Region, but with a fragmented pattern similar to that reported for other primary freshwater
fishes [8,12,15]. Furthermore, we found that some Belize
and Guatemala Astyanax clades (Clades VII and VIII in Figure 5) were joined to the Central America group (group
II), a pattern shared with other Mesoamerican Cichlids
[22]. Our Chiapas-Nicaraguan lineages (Lineage Id in Figure 4) did not reach the Pacific cost of Costa Rica, but
instead have their southern limits in El Salvador. The distribution of lineages from San Juan Region differs from
Bussing's proposal [14], occurring from the Barbilla basin
(Costa Rica) to Belize (Atlantic slope) and on the Pacific
slope from the Rio Grande Basin to the Ciruelas basin in
the Nicoya Gulf (Costa Rica). This pattern has been previously reported by other authors [22,63].
Finally, we dated the separation of Groups I and II to
about 6 and 7.8 Mya (Table 4). These coincide geographically with Polochic-Motagua Fault [6], reported as a transition region for other freshwater fish groups [22,13]. In
addition, we observed the presence of two well differentiated Lineages of Astyanax (Clade IV in Group I and Clade
V in Group II) in sympatry in the Polochic basin, a finding
that has not been reported for other characids [15]. We
explain this pattern in terms of river capture whereby the
Cahabon tributary was diverted to the Polochic river as a
consequence of tectonic activity (Sierra de Chiapas [64]),
while separating the Cahabon river from the Grijalva-Usumacinta (Clade IV in Group I). This has been proposed for
Rhamdia [12].

Methods
Tissue collection and DNA extractions
A total of 208 specimens of the Astyanax and Bramocharax
from 141 localities from Panama to the Mexican-USA border (Additional file 3; Figure 3) were analyzed, corresponding to 10 species of Astyanax: A. aeneus, A. altior, A.
armandoi, A. fasciatus, A. jordani, A. mexicanus, A. nasutus,
A. nicaraguensis, A. orthodus and A. petenensis; and three
species of Bramocharax: B. caballeroi, B. dorioni and B.
bransfordii. Samples of Roeboides bouchellei (from El Salvador), Astyanax bimaculatus (from Argentina) and Astyanax

fasciatus (GenBank sequence from Brazil) were used as
outgroups. We collected individuals from the type localities of most of the species (10 nominal species) described
in Mesoamerica and considered valid by Lima et al [35].
Specimens were sampled by electro-fishing and netting,
individually tagged, and preserved in DMSO/EDTA buffer
[65] or 95% ethanol. DNA voucher specimens and their
associated lots were subsequently preserved in 10% buffered formalin and deposited in the Museo Nacional de
Ciencias Naturales of Madrid, Spain (MNCN), and the
Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo,
Michoacan, Mexico (UMSNH, see Additional file 3).
DNA extraction and Sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated by standard proteinase K and
phenol/chloroform extraction methods [66] and stored at
4°C. The entire cytochrome b (Cytb) gene (1140 bp) and
fragments of 16 S rRNA (552 bp) and cytochrome oxidase
I (COI) (655 bp) genes were amplified. We also amplified
exon 3 of the nuclear Recombinant Activating Gene 1
(RAG1) (1512 bp). Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs)
were performed in 25-L reactions containing 0.4 M of
each primer, 0.2 M of each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1.5
units of Taq DNA polymerase (Biotools). PCRs were conducted under the following conditions: 94°C (2 min), 35
cycles of 94°C (45 s), region specific Tm°C (1 min), 72°C
(90 s), and 72°C (5 min), for most amplifications (see
Table 1), with the exception of the RAG1 gene for which
we followed the PCR conditions described in [67]. PCR
products were run on 1.0% agarose gels to confirm amplification and purified with the EXOSAP-IT PCR Product
Clean – Up (Usb) kit or by ethanol precipitation. Both
strands were sequenced (see Table 5 for primers) and run

on an ABI 3700 DNA automated sequencer (SECUGEN
sequencing service).
Data analysis
Chromatograms and alignments were visually checked
and verified. Saturation for transition and transversion
substitutions was checked by plotting the absolute
number of changes at each codon position against patristic distances for coding genes only.

Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed for Bayesian
Inference (BI) using MrBayes version 3.1.2 [68]. We used
Modeltest 3.07 [69] to find the best-fit model of evolution
for each gene fragment using the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) [69] (see Additional file 4). BI was performed on two data sets as follows: (1) Cytb gene only
with separate best-fit models for each codon position and
(2) using the three mtDNA and RAG1 (separate best-fit
models for each codon position were used) genes with a
separate best-fit model of evolution for each gene fragment (partition). Analyses of best-fit models of evolution
and BI were performed for a subset of the data.
Bayesian analyses were performed using two independent

The program Tracer v1.4 [70] was used to assess run convergence and determine burn-in.
Sequence data were also analysed using maximum parsimony (MP) as implemented in PAUP* 4.0 b10 [71],

were done under the same heuristic search strategy. Statistical support for recovered clades was assessed using bootstrap (1000 pseudo-replications). We applied different
weights for transversions and transitions according to the
empiric criterion obtained in PAUP* 4.0 b10 [71]. The
two datasets run for BI were also run for MP.
Analysis 1 (for which most species and populations of the
Astyanax and Bramocharax genera from Mesoamerica were
represented) was used to infer phylogenetic relationships
among populations. Analysis 2 (for which only a subset of
the species/populations were available) was used to infer
relationships among the main lineages identified in analysis 1.

We constrained the molecular clock considering two main
points in the tree topology (see figure 6). First, our
ingroup (node 1, Figure 6) was calibrated with the isolation of the Maracaibo basin as a result of the rise of Sierra
de Perija and Merida Andes 8–12 Mya: [7,79,80]. Additionally for this node, we also used the oldest fossil record
for a Characid (Colossoma macropomum, 15 Mya) in the
Magdalena river system [81]. This allowed us to determine
the minimum and maximum values for this node (8 and
15 Mya, respectively). We also constrained the molecular
clock using the final closure of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) 3–6 Mya (node 6 in the Figure 6)
[53,60].

Authors' contributions
Molecular clock and divergence time
Since we have a more complete data matrix, and in order
to make our data comparable with previous studies in the
region, we calibrated the molecular clock based on Cytb
data alone rather than the combined data matrix (which
included two more mitochondrial genes and one nuclear
DNA gene).

Rate heterogeneity within the dataset was assessed using
the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) [74,75]. LRTs were determined by comparing the log likelihood of the optimal
topology recovered by maximum likelihood analysis
(using appropriate models identified by Modeltest), while
enforcing the molecular clock to the log likelihood of the
optimal topology recovered by one that did not. The likelihood ratio statistic is twice the difference between the
two log likelihoods. This statistic is compared to a 2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of
terminals minus two following [76].
Because the molecular clock hypothesis was rejected, we
conducted a non-parametric rate smoothing approach
(NPRS) of divergence time estimation with the r8s package [75] to estimate divergence between the taxa. NPRS
relaxes the molecular clock assumption by applying a
least squares smoothing of estimates of substitutions
rates.
Standard errors of divergence dates were estimated using
the boot strapping procedure outlined in, and implemented by, Perl scripts in the r8s bootkit provided by
Torsten Eriksson [77]. The first 100 bootstrapped datasets
were created from the original Cytb dataset with the program Mesquite v. 2.01 [78]. Branch lengths were then reestimated for each bootstrapped dataset in PAUP* using
the original ML parameters. The resulting trees, with
branch lengths, were then imported into r8s. The TN
(Truncated Newton) algorithm was implemented.

CPOG collected material, compiled data, performed analyses and wrote the manuscript. ID designed the research
project, collected material and wrote the manuscript.
ODD collected material. The final draft was read and
