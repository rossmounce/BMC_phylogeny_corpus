Abstract
Background: Angiosperm mitochondrial genomes are more complex than those of other organisms. Analyses of
the mitochondrial genome sequences of at least 11 angiosperm species have showed several common properties;
these cannot easily explain, however, how the diverse mitotypes evolved within each genus or species. We
analyzed the evolutionary relationships of Brassica mitotypes by sequencing.
Results: We sequenced the mitotypes of cam (Brassica rapa), ole (B. oleracea), jun (B. juncea), and car (B. carinata)
and analyzed them together with two previously sequenced mitotypes of B. napus (pol and nap). The sizes of
whole single circular genomes of cam, jun, ole, and car are 219,747 bp, 219,766 bp, 360,271 bp, and 232,241 bp,
respectively. The mitochondrial genome of ole is largest as a resulting of the duplication of a 141.8 kb segment.
The jun mitotype is the result of an inherited cam mitotype, and pol is also derived from the cam mitotype with
evolutionary modifications. Genes with known functions are conserved in all mitotypes, but clear variation in open
reading frames (ORFs) with unknown functions among the six mitotypes was observed. Sequence relationship
analysis showed that there has been genome compaction and inheritance in the course of Brassica mitotype
evolution.
Conclusions: We have sequenced four Brassica mitotypes, compared six Brassica mitotypes and suggested a
mechanism for mitochondrial genome formation in Brassica, including evolutionary events such as inheritance,
duplication, rearrangement, genome compaction, and mutation.

Background
Plant mitochondrial genomes are complex because they
encode significantly more genes than do their fungal
and animal counterparts. Investigations of the mitochondrial genome sequences of at least 13 angiosperm
species, including Arabidopsis thaliana [1], Beta vulgaris
[2], Oryza sativa [3-5], Brassica napus [6,7], Zea mays
[8-10], Nicotiana tabacum [11], Triticum aestivum [12],
Vitis vinifera [13], Citrullus lanatus and Cucurbita pepo
[14], and Vigna radiata [15], together with physical
mapping [16-18], have showed several properties of
plant mitochondrial genomes, such as large size (2002400 kb), slow rates of evolutionary change,

incorporation of foreign DNA, a multipartite structure,
and specific modes of gene expression (e.g. cis and trans
splicing, RNA editing), etc [19]. These properties cannot
easily explain how the diverse mitotypes evolved within
each plant genus or species. To understand the evolutionary peculiarity of plant mitotypes, which are defined
as mitochondrial genome types of which there can be
more than one within one plant species or genus, more
systematic sequences are needed. To date, no systematic
sequences of one angiosperm genus with multiple species had been used to analyze the derivation of mitochondrial genome, and thus the mechanism underlying
the peculiarity has not been revealed. Here, we selected
Brassica as an evolutionary clade in which to analyze
the evolutionary relationships of Brassica mitotypes by
sequencing.

Brassica contains six cultivated species that are very
important for producing vegetables and oilseeds. The
nuclear genomic relationships between the six species
were showed by the U with cytogenetics approach [20],
which has been popularly accepted as U’s triangle theory
(Figure 1). However, the cytoplasmic relationship
between the six species needs to be further explored,
although the entire sequences of two mitotypes of Brassica napus have been reported [6,7] with a focus on the
mechanism of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of three Brassica species
has been physically mapped [18]. Here, we report the
sequence of the mitochondrial genomes of B. rapa (cam
mitotype), B. oleracea (ole), B. juncea (jun), and B. carinata (car). Together with previously reported mitochondrial genome sequences of the pol and nap mitotypes in
B. napus [6,7], we compared the six mitochondrial genome sequences to learn the mechanism of formation for
Brassica mitochondrial genomes.

Results
Brassica mitochondrial genomes

Brassica comprises six cultivated species [21]: B. rapa
(cam), B. oleracea (ole), B. napus, B. juncea (jun), B.
nigra, and B. carinata (car). The sizes of entire single
circular mitochondrial genomes of cam [GenBank:
JF920285], jun [GenBank: JF920288], ole [GenBank:
JF920286], and car [GenBank: JF920287] are 219,747 bp,
219,766 bp, 360,271 bp, and 232,241 bp, respectively.

The mitochondrial genomes of car and ole are larger
than these of cam, jun, pol, and nap. The ole mitotype
is larger because of the duplication of a 141.8 kb segment. The G+C content of the six mitotypes ranges
from 45.19% in nap to 45.33% in car, with slight differences among mitotypes. Similarly, nucleotide base content varies slightly in the six mitotypes. The total length
of genes with known functions differs between the mitotypes. The percentages that the total length of genes
with known functions accounts for the mitochondrial
genomes are almost the same in the cam, jun, ole, pol,
and nap mitotypes, but the percentage in car is 27.98%
(Table 1), less than that of the other five mitotypes, perhaps as a result of differentiation of Brassica mitotypes.
Analysis of genes with known functions showed that
these six mitotypes share 36 species of protein-encoding
genes, 3 species of ribosome genes, and 15 species of
tRNA genes (Table 2); paralogous genes present in
more than one copy are counted here as one species.
However, the ole and car mitotypes lack the complexIV-related cox2-2 gene found in the other four mitotypes and the CMS-related genes (homologous to orf224
and orf222) found in the pol and nap mitotypes [22,23].
The cam and jun mitotypes that have identical gene
constitution, also lack the CMS-related genes (orf224
and orf222). The numbers of genes with known functions are almost the same in all six mitotypes, but the
total number of genes varies with mitotype, ranging
from 53 in car to 95 in ole (Table 2).
Previous studies have reported physical maps of the
cam [18,24] and ole [17,24] mitochondrial genomes. We
found that the length of cam sequence is almost the
same as that obtained from the physical map (219.7 kb
vs. 218 kb), but because of a large duplication, the
length of the ole mitotype is 360.3 kb, much larger than
that previously reported from physical mapping (219
kb). A reasonable explanation for the discrepancy may
be that the large repeats of ole are difficult to detect by
physical mapping.
Repeats

Figure 1 Cytogenetic relationships of six cultivated Brassica
species as depicted by U’s triangle [20]. U’s triangle illustrates the
evolutionary relationship between three cultivated elementary
species (B. rapa, B. oleracea, and B. nigra) and three amphiploid
species (B. napus, B. juncea, and B. carinata). Chromosome numbers,
nuclear genome types and mitotypes are shown inside or outside
the circle for each species.

Large repeats are a cause of the formation of the multipartite structure of the Brassica mitochondrial genome,
including one master circle and two smaller subgenomic
circles, through reversible homologous recombination
[18]. A pair of large (2,427 bp) repeats, called the RB
repeats, identified in pol and nap is also found in the
cam, jun, and ole mitotypes, but only one copy of RB is
found in the car mitotype (Figure 2). Two other pairs of
large repeats, R1 and R2, are also found in ole; R2 is an
mtDNA fragment 141.8 kb in size, and R1 carries two
exons of the nad5 gene and is 3,605 bp in size. One
copy of R1 is found in all other mitotypes except the ole
mitotype. Car contains two copies of the 6,580 bp R

R1 (Figure 2), one copy of RB, and one copy of R1.
Therefore, the multipartite structures of cam, jun, pol,
and nap might result from the same large RB repeats,
and the multipartite structure in car might result from
R repeats, but the multipartite structure in ole is complex and is not predicted because it has multiple large
repeats. The sizes of multipartite circles for the other

five mitotypes except ole predicted by this inference are
given in Additional file 1, Table S1.
Tandem repeats exist in all six mitotypes. Frequency
distribution analysis of the six mitotypes shows that the
size of tandem repeat is mainly between 11 and 40 bp,
and median of the number of repeats is mainly 2-3
(Additional file 1, Tables S2 and S3). Short repeats
range from 30 to 500 bp in length with a total number

Figure 2 Large repeats exist in the six mitotypes. RB, R1, R, and R2 denote repeats of more than 2 kb. RB and R1 are shared by the six
mitotypes, but their copy numbers vary.

of approximately 190, accounting for roughly 5% of the
entire mitochondrial genome.
Short repeats are closely related with an irreversible
re-organization of the Brassica mitochondrial genomes
[7,25,26]. The short repeats are uniformly distributed in
the six mitochondrial genomes, as detected by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method [27]. This may imply that
there are prerequisites for the irreversible rearrangement. To investigate the relationships of syntenic region
rearrangements, syntenic regions were numbered
(defined in Figure 3). We found that some rearrangements of numbered regions are associated with short
repeats. For example, Figure 4A shows that in the cam
and ole mitotypes, syntenic segments 7, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 1
were rearranged together with sequence direction
changes, and the recombinations that resulted in these
rearrangements are related to the short repeats marked
Q, which are made up of approximately 100 bp repeats
within the neighboring segment. Another typical example is the short repeat of about 70 bp (P): the separated
segments 16 and 1 that contain the short P repeat in
the car mitotype were recombined into the rearranged
form in ole omitting the P repeat (Figure 4B). These
findings are evidence for an association of short repeats
with rearrangements.
A 141.8 kb segment duplication in the ole mitotype
was the main factor influencing the differences in the
number of functional genes between ole and the other
five mitotypes. This large duplicated 38 genes with
known functions and several partial exons, including
three exons of nad1, three exons of nad2, and three
exons of nad5. This partial duplication of the mitochondrial genome and the resulting dramatic change
in the copy number of genes and ORFs of B. oleracea
suggests that the role of ole mitotype is different from
that of the other five Brassica mitotypes in cytotypenuclear genotype interactions or plant-environment
interactions.

Inheritance of mitochondrial genomes in Brassica

By comparing the complete sequences, we found that
the cam and jun mitotypes have the same genome organization and are closely related at the nucleotide
sequence level. According to U’s triangle for the cytological relationship between Brassica species, B. juncea is
derived from the offspring of an interspecific cross
between B. rapa and B. nigra; thus, the cam mitotype of
B. rapa can be inferred to have been transmitted into B.
juncea without a significant genomic change. Similarly,
the pol mitotype in B. napus, which is postulated to be
derived from the offspring of an interspecific cross
between B. rapa and B. oleracea according to U’s triangle, has only one region different from cam, suggesting
that pol also inherited the cam mitotype, with an evolutionary modification. At the modification position, pol
has a 4.4-kb insertion and cam has an 813-bp insertion,
suggesting that pol was derived from cam at this location through evolutionary modifications resulting in a
813-bp sequence deletion and 4.4-kb sequence insertion.
The relationship between pol, jun, and cam shows that
the cytoplasmic origin of plant species can be traced
because the mitochondrial genome is conserved. On the
other hand, this pattern of mitotype inheritance in
plants, for which we are presenting the first evidence,
indicates that the evolution of new composite species is
not always accompanied by sudden mitochondrial genome changes, or that new species may inherit maternal
mitochondrial genomes with a few insertions/deletions
(indels), as shown in the pol mitotype. This mitotype
inheritance mechanism might be involved in other composite plant species formed by chromosomal doubling
or interspecies hybridization.
Mitochondrial genome restructuring

Relative to three highly similar mitotypes (cam, jun, and
pol), nap, ole, and car were found to be restructured
mitotypes. The genomic structure of the ole mitotype is

different from that of cam (Figure 3A), and it can be
inferred that, relative to cam, the genomic structure of
ole has experienced at least four recombination events.
The recombination events and a large duplication (141.8
kb) (Figure 2) made the ole mitotype distinct from the
other five mitotypes. Relative to ole, the car mitochondrial genome has as many as 17 syntenic regions (Figure
3B), suggesting that the car mitotype restructuring is

more complex. The number of recombination events in
the process of mitochondrial genome formation in car is
difficult to estimate, because there are so many syntenic
regions.
The similarities between the syntenic regions (Additional file 2) of the six Brassica mitotypes are very high,
with the lowest nucleotide identity being 87% and most
of the nucleotide identity being more than 99%,

sequence is shown by an arrow. (A) Repeat Q is possibly related to
the influence of the rearrangement of syntenic regions 7, 2, 5, 6, 8,
and 1 of the ole and cam mitotypes. (B) Repeat P may be related to

indicating that the syntenic regions are consistently conserved in Brassica.
Mitotype divergence

Structural comparisons between two mitotypes help to
identify indel sequences present in one mitochondrial
genome and absent (or deleted) in another. Indels frequently found in both coding and non-coding gene
regions of plant mitochondrial genomes can provide
evolutionary clues [8,28]. To illustrate the genomic differences, we summed the length of indels found in a
mitochondrial genome comparison and defined a dissimilarity indicator to measure the divergence between

Page 6 of 12

two mitochondrial genomes using indels and single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between them. Cluster analysis of the six mitotypes showed that cam and
pol are in one class, ole slightly diverges from the campol class, and nap and car have diverged the furthest
from the cam-pol group (see Figure 5 and Additional
file 1, Tables S4 and S5).
Combined indel analysis of multiple mitochondrial
genomes showed that all insertions in the cam, jun, pol,
and ole mitotypes can be aligned with other mitotypes.
However, for some insertions in the nap and car mitotypes, matching sequences with high homology could
not be found in other Brassica mitotypes. These
unmatched insertions account for 2.92% of the nap
mitotype (one insertion larger than 2 kb) and 10.36% of
the car mitotype (11 insertions).
Variation of open reading frames with unknown functions

Using the ORF Finder software at NCBI, the cam, pol,
nap, ole, and car mitotypes were found to contain 44,
45, 46, 44, and 36 species of ORFs with unknown functions, respectively, indicating that the numbers of ORFs
in the six mitotypes are different (jun has an ORF constitution identical to cam). On the other hand, the six
mitotypes share 20 ORFs with unknown functions:
orf100b, orf101a, orf101b, orf104, orf106b, orf108b,
orf109, orf113a, orf115a, orf115c, orf115d, orf116, orf119,
orf120, orf135, orf146, orf159, orf161, orf257, and orf448.
Another 34 ORFs sequences are not possessed consistently by all of the six Brassica mitotypes (Table 3)
(defined here as polymorphic ORFs, present in one
mitotype in complete form, and completely absent or
present in partial or mutated form in other mitotypes).

Total number of function-unknown orf in six mitotypes

Each line presents the homologous ORFs. +, present; -, absent; GR, gene rearrangement; ID, insertion/deletion; M, mutation. ORF copy numbers are shown ahead

#
orf222 and orf224 are the same as Table 1.
Data for pol and nap are from our previous report and Handa’s results [6], respectively. The total numbers outside parentheses show the changing ORF for each
mitotype; the number in parentheses contains the ORFs that exist consistently in the six mitotypes. The total number of ORFs in ole is not plus the multiple
copies, if containing the copies the total number is 73.

This result suggests that the inclusion of ORFs with
unknown functions in different mitotypes are very
different.
Genome rearrangement may result in loss of ORFs
through a DNA break within an ORF, which results in
loss of the ORF or generation of a novel ORF through
the recombination of the broken sequences with others.
In our analysis, three polymorphic ORFs were found to
be due to genome rearrangement (Table 3). For example,
the breakage of orf101c at position +108 due to genome
rearrangement has led to the loss of this ORF in car, and
the orf265 sequence in nap was lost in the course of rearrangement, generating orf261 [7]. In car, breakage of the
orf265 sequence at position +463 was followed by recombination of its terminal sequence with another sequence,
resulting in orf277 of the car mitotype.
Ten polymorphic ORFs were caused by indels (Table
3), indicating that indels had a direct influence on
ORF variation. Orf101d and orf128 are absent in car,
orf117b is absent in cam and pol, orf122 and orf132
are absent in nap and car, and orf124 and orf138a
exist only in car. The region including orf224 in pol
and orf188, orf222 in nap is contained in an insert
region, as shown in comparison of the two mitotypes
(Additional file 2).

Twenty-one out of the 34 polymorphic ORFs resulted
from nucleotide mutations (Table 3), suggesting that
mutations have a more important role than other evolutionary events in mitotype formation in Brassica. There
are a total of 105 mutation sites in the 21 polymorphic
ORF sequences, of five mitotypes, of which 67 sites are
frame-preserving mutations although the length of ORF
is changed, three sites are single nucleotide mutation
sites resulting in premature stop codons, four are triplet
indels of less than 52 nucleotides in length (in orf120a,
orf108c, orf286, and orf288), which cause length variation among the homologous ORFs, and the other 31
sites are non-triplet indels, including two sites of 1 bp
indels, six sites of 2 bp indels, four sites of 4 bp indels,
five sites of 5 bp indels, and 14 sites of indels more than
5 bp. For example, orf118 is incomplete because of several nucleotide mutations in car. In the ole mitotype,
mutation of nucleotides TC to AA at positions +188
and +189 in orf120a occurred together with a AGTATT
insertion at + 212 to generate orf120a.
Little is known about the roles of the predicted ORFs,
because limited studies have been carried out on them.
Only one ORF, the CMS-related orf222 (or its homolog
orf224), has been demonstrated to be important, but the
ORFs with unknown functions specific to Brassica could

Chang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:497
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/497

have a particular role in the mitochondrial activities of a
particular species [29].
Given the above-mentioned numbers of polymorphic
ORFs with unknown functions, the importance of the
roles of the three evolutionary factors in genome formation may be arranged in the following order: mutation >
segment indel > genome rearrangement. The mechanism including these evolutionary factors undoubtedly
changed the mitochondrial genome structure and ORFs,
but these factors influencing the Brassica mitochondrial
genomes did not alter the constitution of the gene species (or classes) with known functions, which is almost
same as the situation in A. thaliana [1]. This result suggests that genes with known functions in the mitochondrial genomes are not changed, and it may indicate that
the genes with known functions are too important to be
lost or indispensable across the long evolutionary time
in the plant genus or within several closely related
species.

Discussion
Mitotype formation in Brassica

In previous analyses of plant mitochondrial genomes,
several evolutionary factors, such as duplication, rearrangement, indel, and mutation, have been found to be
important in genome evolution [5,8,9,30]. In this study,
as well as these evolutionary factors, we have shown for
the first time that mitotype inheritance can explain well
the formation of some of the mitotypes (pol and jun) of
Brassica. Thus, we suggest that the Brassica mitotypes
are derived through a mechanism including several evolutionary events, such as inheritance, duplication, rearrangement, indel, and mutation of the plant
mitochondrial genome sequence. However, this is not
our final conclusion on mitochondrial genome formation because this cannot explain the phenomena resulting from our syntenic region alignment.
We have inferred the origin of two mitotypes (pol and
jun), but how have the other four mitotypes originated?
We analyze this result as follows.
First, U’s triangle can help reveal the origin of mitotypes (Figure 1). From the cytogenetics of Brassica, the
composite species have been thought to be formed by
interspecific hybridization between elementary species
and following chromosome doubling, and the mitotypes
of composite Brassica may be regarded as having been
derived by inheritance from corresponding maternal
parents with primary mitotypes. In the past, the maternal parents of amphiploid species were inferred to be
the species with more chromosomes on basis of the
crossability between two parents. For example, B. rapa
is regarded as the ancestral female parent for B. napus
because a cross with B. rapa as maternal parent and B.
oleracea as male parent is easier to accomplish than its

Page 8 of 12

reverse cross, and mitotypes of B. napus including nap
can be regarded as inherited from the cam mitotype (B.
rapa) although this lacked evidence at the molecular
level.
Second, our combined insertion alignment results
show that the insertions in the cam, jun, pol and ole
mitotypes can be aligned with other Brassica mitotypes.
This result implies that, if we regard cruciferous species
with bigger mitochondrial genomes than most Brassica
as ancestral species, the Brassica mitotypes can be
inferred to have evolved from a common ancestral parent with all the mitochondrial genome information of
Brassica mitotypes, and which existed after the so-called
mitochondrial genome expansion of angiosperms [31].
The indels in Brassica mitotypes may be traces of deletions from the common ancestral parent. If we do not
accept this hypothesis, then we must postulate that the
insertion sequences were obtained through horizontal
transfer or transfer from the nuclear genome [32,33].
The possibility that insertion sequences are transfers
from the nuclear genome can be ruled out because
none of them can be aligned with the nuclear DNA in a
search of NCBI sequence databases. As for insertion
sequences from horizontal transfer between mitochondria, the concept is seemingly logical but currently lacks
supporting evidence. In addition, the so-called transfers
have been considered to be random transfers, so we
cannot conceive why the same insert sequences are
found in different mitotypes. Thus, we conclude that
there has been some genome compaction during the
process of mitochondrial genome evolution.
Third, there are two mitotypes identified in B. napus,
the nap and pol mitotypes [7,18]. The nap mitotype,
discovered by Shiga and Thompson [34,35], exists popularly in natural rapeseed germplasm population with
usually male fertile phenotype in most genetic backgrounds. The pol mitotype, which is sparse in natural
rapeseed germplasm, resulting in cytoplasmic male sterility with easily-found restorer lines, was discovered first
by Fu [36], has been widely used in to generate heterosis. No other natural mitotype apart from these two
mitotypes of B. napus has been identified. Also, no
other natural mitotype for the elementary species of
Brassica apart from those studied here has been identified, and thus how the nap mitotype has been inherited
appears to remain unsolved. Nevertheless, the nap mitotype might have been inherited from an unidentified or
lost mitotype of B. rapa, which has very rich germplasm,
and then experienced mitochondrial genome evolution
events as mentioned above. Similarly, the formation of
the car mitotype found in the composite species B. carinata can be explained by the same mechanism as that
proposed for the nap mitotype. Our previous results [7]
demonstrated that the nap and pol mitotypes coexist in

Chang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:497
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/497

B. napus: the pol cytoplasm consists mainly of the pol
mitotype, and the nap mitotype is the main genome of
nap cytoplasm. In this case, the inference that the
maternal parent of nap mitotype is B. rapa, is further
supported because the coexistence does not contradict
the genome compaction hypothesis. Mitotype coexistence has also been demonstrated in other plant species,
such as Phaseolus vulgaris [37,38]. Whether mitotype
coexistence can be regarded as vestige of ancestral
maternal mitochondrial genome compaction needs to be
further explored, but the compaction may be a cause of
mitotype diversification for the different species with
different nuclei (speciation) as a result of adaptation of
each plant species to internal and external environment.
Finally, from the above analysis, mitotypes for elementary species of Brassica can be regarded as the products
of condensation or compaction of a bigger ancestral
mitochondrial genome accompanied by long-term evolution history changes that may be necessary for adaptation to their environments, or be random evolutionary
events such as mutation. Composite species may be
inferred to have been derived from maternal mitotype
inheritance and the following modification of maternal
mitotype (Figure 6).
Additionally, intergenic regions of the mitochondrial
genome were not found to be conserved in other studies
[30,39], but our results on intergenic regions seem to be
inconsistent with this conclusion. A reasonable

Page 9 of 12

explanation is that the mitotypes in our analysis belonging to the same genus in which closely related species
were formed through genome compaction. In previous
studies, either the analyzed materials were not as closely
related as in our study, or the origins of the indels (the
so-called non-conserved regions in other studies) were
not elucidated. Our results may be an addition to the
evolutionary theory of the mitochondrial genome.
Evolutionary pattern of plant mitochondrial genomes

Mitochondrial genomes are considered to be have
evolved monophyletically from a eubacterial ancestor
[31,40]. The evolutionary trends are different between
animals and plants over their long evolutionary history.
The trend in animals is towards a further compaction of
the mitochondrial genome through loss of genes and
intergenic spacers, as exemplified in Homo sapiens and
Metridium senile [41-43]. Conversely, the mitochondrial
genomes in plants and fungi have experienced mtDNA
expansions, including increases in size, primarily by
acquisition of a large amount of apparently non-coding
DNA of currently unknown origin and function [41,43].
This description is summarized as the serial endosymbiosis theory, which remains unrefuted [31,41].
Nevertheless, our research with Brassica as a phylogenetic model clade has demonstrated that a compaction
mechanism has been involved in plant mitotype evolution. This phylogenetic pattern within a Brassica clade

Figure 6 Hypothesis regarding the evolution of six cultivated Brassica mitotypes. Diverse Brassica mitotypes are hypothesized to have
evolved from an expanded ancestral parent mitotype and formed through mitochondrial genome speciation and compaction. Jun (B. juncea) is
derived from the cam mitotype and pol and nap from a primary mitotype very similar to the cam mitotype, without deletion of the CMS-related
orf224 gene region (4.4 kb) or its homolog orf222. The maternal mitotype from which car is derived is unclear (dotted lines). Three mitotypes for
the elementary species are also hypothesized to be compaction forms from the large ancestral mitotype.

Chang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:497
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/497

coincides well with the properties of the animal clade.
Given this conclusion, one difference in the evolutionary
mechanism between animals and angiosperms may be
that the mitochondrial genome has undergone an
expansion process in angiosperms but not in animals.
Mitotype effects

Rapeseed breeders pay much attention to cytoplasmic
effects. From our results, the jun and cam mitotypes
do not have the CMS-related orf222 gene found in nap
or the homologous CMS-related orf224 found in pol,
and other genes with known functions are almost the
same as in the nap, pol or jun mitotype, so jun and
cam may probably be beneficial to breeding of conventional varieties of B. napus because the CMS-related
gene is usually regarded as being noxious to plants
[44]. The fact that the amphiploid B. juncea is more
tolerant to stressful environments than B. napus [21] is
probably related to the mitotype differences between B.
juncea and B. napus. Potential uses of the ole and car
mitotypes in Brassica crop breeding need to be
explored.

Conclusions
This study has compared the sequences of six Brassica
mitotypes. The pol mitotype of B. napus and the jun
mitotype of B. juncea are found to be an inherited form
of the cam mitotype with less modification. This result
may have implications for the mitochondrial genome
origin of other composite plant species formed by chromosomal doubling or interspecific hybridization.
Sequence relationship analyses showed that a mechanism of genome compaction and inheritance has been
involved in Brassica mitotype evolution. Our study suggests a mechanism of mitochondrial genome formation
in Brassica including evolutionary events such as inheritance, duplication, rearrangement, sequence compaction
(indels), and mutation.
Methods
Mitochondrial DNA preparation

Materials used for mitochondrial genome sequencing
included four Brassica accessions: Suzhouqing of B.
rapa, Jiangpu-yejiecai of B. juncea, 08C717 of B. oleracea, and W29 of B. carinata. The first two of these were
from our germplasm deposited in the National Key Lab
of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement in
Nanjing Agricultural University. The 08C717 accession
of B. oleracea was provided by the Institute of Vegetable
Crops in Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and
W29 of B. carinata was provided by Yanyou Wu of
Jiangsu University. Methods for mitochondrial DNA
extraction and purification of the four species were
reported previously [7].

Genome sequencing

The Brassica mtDNA was sequenced using the massively parallel GS-FLX DNA pyrosquencing platform
from Roche 454 Life Sciences (Branford, CT, USA).
Contigs were joined by Sanger sequencing of PCR products. The number of reads for cam, jun, ole, and car
were 11,805, 11,125, 15,189, and 29,676, respectively.
Total sequence data for cam, jun, ole, and car were
4,432,258 bp, 4,422,401 bp, 6,798,916 bp, and 13,381,537
bp, respectively, representing mitochondrial genome
coverage ratios of 19X, 20X, 18X, and 57X, respectively.
The coverage ratio for the car mitotype is far greater
than that of the others because it was sequenced twice,
as the first sequencing attempt was not successful.
Genome annotation

Database searches were carried out using the NCBI
web-based Blast service [45], and genes with e-values
less than 0.001 were selected. The ORFs were used to
query non-redundant databases using BLAST similarity
searches, by applying a cut-off of 70% sequence identity
over at least 80% of the ORF length. To define genes,
ORF Finder, BLASTN, BLASTX [45], and tRNAscan-SE
[46] were used. To improve identification accuracy, the
mtDNA annotations were compared with other plant
mitochondrial genome annotations, and all differences
in coding predictions were reassessed on the basis of
the choice of the start codon, length of plant mtDNA
conservation, and the presence of identical motifs. In
addition to unknown genes, only ORFs of at least 100
codons were annotated, using the mitochondrial genome
annotations of the nap (GenBank: AP006444.1) and pol
(EMBL: FR715249) mitotypes of B. napus as a reference.
Mitochondrial genome comparisons

The six mitochondrial genomes were aligned using
BLASTN [45]. Homologous segments > 400 bp in
length were chosen. Indel, defined as a sequence present
in one mitochondrial genome but absent in another
mitochondrial genome, were extracted to elucidate
genomic divergence. Two previously reported mitochondrial genomes for Brassica were combined for analysis.
The dot matrix plot provided in BLASTN helped in
analysis of genome restructuring. Additionally, progressive Mauve [47] was used to identify SNPs between
genomes.
Analysis of repeats

Repeats (30-500 bp) were discovered using in-house private commercial software developed by Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Biotechnology Company (China).
BLASTN was used to identify repeats longer than 500
bp. Information on tandem repeats was obtained using
the tandem repeats finder [48]. The Kolmogorov-

Smirnov method was used to test the uniformity of
short repeat distribution.

Mitochondrial genome clustering

Two main indicators were used to measure mitochondrial divergence: the number of SNPs between two genomes and the total length of indel sequences that
account for differences when two mitochondrial genomes were compared. Dissimilarities among mitochondrial genome sequences were measured with the
formula d = (2N SNP +L Indel1 +L Indel2 )/(LG1 +LG2 ), where
L G1 and L G2 represent the entire lengths of the two
mitochondrial genomes to be compared, N SNP represents the number of SNPs found when the paired genomes were compared, and LIndel1 and LIndel2 denote the
total length of insertion sequences for the two mitochondrial genomes. With this definition of dissimilarity,
the UPGMA method [49] was used to cluster the mitochondrial genomes of Brassica species.
