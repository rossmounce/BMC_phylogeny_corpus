Abstract
Background: DAX1 (NR0B1), a member of the nuclear receptors super family, has been shown
to be involved in the genetic sex determination and in gonadal differentiation in several vertebrate
species. In the aquaculture fish European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, and in the generality of
fish species, the mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation have not been elucidated. The
present study aimed at characterizing the European DAX1 gene and its developmental expression
at the mRNA level.
Methods: A full length European sea bass DAX1 cDNA (sbDAX1) was isolated by screening a
testis cDNA library. The structure of the DAX1 gene was determined by PCR and Southern blot.
Multisequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis were used to compare the translated sbDAX1
product to that of other vertebrates. sbDAX1 expression was analysed by Northern blot and
relative RT-PCR in adult tissues. Developmental expression of mRNA levels was analysed in groups
of larvae grown either at 15°C or 20°C (masculinising temperature) during the first 60 days, or two
groups of fish selected for fast (mostly females) and slow growth.
Results: The sbDAX1 is expressed as a single transcript in testis and ovary encoding a predicted
protein of 301 amino acids. A polyglutamine stretch of variable length in different DAX1 proteins
is present in the DNA binding domain. The sbDAX1 gene is composed of two exons, separated by
a single 283 bp intron with conserved splice sites in same region of the ligand binding domain as
other DAX1 genes. sbDAX1 mRNA is not restricted to the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis and is also
detected in the gut, heart, gills, muscle and kidney. sbDAX1 mRNA was detected as early as 4 days
post hatching (dph) and expression was not affected by incubation temperature. Throughout
gonadal sex differentiation (60–300 dph) no dimorphic pattern of expression was observed.
Conclusion: The sbDAX1 gene and putative protein coding region is highly conserved and has a
wide pattern of tissue expression. Although gene expression data suggests sbDAX1 to be
important for the development and differentiation of the gonads, it is apparently not sex specific.

Background
DAX1 (NR0B1) is a member of the nuclear receptors super
family initially isolated from a 160 kb region in the
human Xp21 chromosome, called dosage- sensitive sex
reversal (DSS) region, that, when duplicated in the
genome, is responsible for the DSS syndrome which
causes male to female sex reversal in individuals with a
normal SRY gene [1]. Mutations in this gene can give rise
to a severe adrenal insufficiency, adrenal hypoplasia congenita frequently accompanied by hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism [2]. Similarly, over expression of the
DAX1 gene in certain mouse strains also leads to phenotypic sex reversal in males [3]. Mice knockout models have
also shown that DAX1 expression in developing testicular
tissue is essential for normal testicular development and
for male fertility. DAX1 deficient male mice present
abnormal testicular morphology, low sperm production
and sperm count [4,5], whereas in female DAX1 knockout
mice, normal ovarian development and reproductive
function is accomplished, although presenting a compromised endocrine function.
DAX1 is unusual in that it lacks the characteristic zinc-finger motif in the DNA-binding domain that is highly conserved in other members of the family [2]. In humans it
encodes a protein of 470 amino acids, which N-terminus
consists instead of three repeats of a unique 67 amino
acids long cysteine-rich motif [2]. The number of repeats
seems to vary throughout evolution, since in all homolog
of non mammalian species studied so far only one repeat
is present: chicken [6] alligator [7], frog [8] and in Nile
tilapia [9]. In the C-terminus, there is a nuclear receptor
ligand-binding domain motif, even though no ligands are
known to bind the protein [10], and a bipartite transcriptional repression domain [11]. DAX1 has been shown to
be able to down regulate the transcription of several genes
involved in the development and steroidogenic activity of
both the adrenal and gonadal tissues, e.g. StAR [11],
CYP11A [12], CYP17 [13], CYP19 [14], müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) [15], estrogens receptors α and β [16]
and androgen receptor [17]. Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1),
another nuclear receptor, also regulates most of the same
steroidogenic enzymes which DAX1 targets and it is the
balance between repressor and inducer function of DAX1 and SF-1 that is critical for the regulation of these
enzymes [18]. Transcriptional repression by DAX1 is
thought to be mediated by both direct binding to gene
promoters, e.g StAR [11], and by interaction with different
co-repressors: N-CoR [19] and Alien [20]. In addition,
DAX1 is also suggested to play additional regulatory function in the post-transcriptional processes [18].
The European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, is a gonochoristic teleost fish belonging to the family Moronidae,
closely related to the Serranidae, a family composed of

http://www.rbej.com/content/5/1/19

hermaphroditic species [21]. This singularity has been
suggested as being connected to its sex liability translated
in the occurrence of intratesticular oocytes in juveniles
[21] and to a high degree of temperature-dependent sex
differentiation (TSD) in farming conditions [22-25].
Thus, incubating sea bass larvae at relatively high temperatures (above 17°C) strongly affects the sex ratio, increasing the proportion of males [22-25]. The thermosensitive
period for gonadal differentiation in sea bass corresponds
to the first 60 days post fertilization (dpf) [23]. The
gonads become sensitive to steroids during a period of
around 6 weeks centred at 100 dpf [21]. The first gonad to
differentiate is the ovary at 160 dpf (8 cm standard length,
SL) followed by the testis, most males differentiating at
250 dpf (11.8 cm SL) [21]. Size is a critical marker for the
timing of sexual differentiation, so that larger larvae are
more likely to develop as females while smaller larvae
tend to develop as males [26]. Thus, the identification of
genes acting early in the sex determining cascade will facilitate understanding the mechanism involved in the TSD
in this species and may provide markers for the early
detection of sex.
In teleost fish, including the sea bass, exogenous steroids
given at the appropriate period of sex differentiation can
lead to various degrees of sex change including sex reversal
[27,28]. Thus natural and artificial estrogens feminize the
gonads while non-aromatizable androgens and aromatase inhibitors have a masculinising effect [27,28]. Furthermore, downregulation of CYP19 transcripts has been
associated to temperature-induced masculinisation in
Nile tilapia [29,30] as well as with testis differentiation in
reptiles with TSD [31].
Considering the above, and the high conservation of the
main features of the sex differentiation pathway in vertebrates [7], we hypothesize that in sea bass DAX1 expression may be directly or indirectly upregulated by high
temperatures and, through the interaction of sex steroid
producing enzymes or receptors, promote the masculinisation of the gonads (Figure 1). In this report we investigate the possible role of DAX1 on sex differentiation in the
European sea bass. We have cloned and characterized a
cDNA for a European sea bass DAX1- homolog, determined the gene structure and analysed its mRNA expression pattern in early gonadal development in fish cultured
at normal and masculinising temperatures and during
gonadal differentiation in female and male biased populations.

Schematic representation of pathway for the biosynthesis of sexual steroids. DAX1 regulates key steps for
androgen production by repressing the transcriptional activation of SF-1 on the promoters of StAR [11], CYP11A [12] and
CYP17 [13]. DAX1 binds directly to the CYP19 promoter to
downregulate its transcription [14]. It also regulates estrogen
[16] and androgen receptors [17] through protein-protein
interactions. CYP11A, CYP17 and CYP19 are, respectively,
genes that encode for the P450 enzymes cholesterol side

mento, Portugal) and maintained at the Ramalhete
Experimental Station (University of Algarve, Faro, Portugal) prior to sampling in through-flow seawater tanks at
17 ± 2°C under natural photoperiod.
To investigate DAX1 gene expression during the thermosensitive period an experiment was carried out in which
sea bass eggs were incubated at 15°C or 20°C until they
reached a total length of 18 mm (48 and 66 dph, respectively). Thereafter both groups were maintained at natural
temperature (ranging between 18 to 22°C) until sex determination was complete (300 dph) and gonadal sex was
determined histologically. Rearing conditions were similar to those described by Mylonas et al [22]. Treatment
resulted in 75% and 22% females in the 15°C group and
20°C groups respectively. Samples for gene expression
analysis were taken at 4, 18, 32, 46 and 60 dph to analyze
gene expression. At 4 dph samples were 6 pools of 3 larvae
per sample, at other times consisted of 6 individual larvae.
The fish to analyse gene expression during gonadal development in male and female dominant populations came
from an experiment described in detail by Papadaki et al.
[32], carried out at the Institute of Aquaculture, Hellenic

http://www.rbej.com/content/5/1/19

Center for Marine Research (Crete, Greece). Eggs were
incubated at 17°C until hatching and from then on the
larvae and juveniles were cultured at ambient temperatures throughout. The experiment consisted of grading the
fish four times at ca. 50 days intervals, from 56 dph to 220
dph, each time retaining the 50% larger and the 50%
smaller fish in the two groups that were formed after the
first grading. Since European sea bass females tend to be
larger than males, there was a progressive selection of
females in the group with the larger fish and of males in
the group with the smaller fish. Samples were taken from
each grading but only from 150 days (second grading) it
was possible to determine sex by histology. The percentage of females in the smaller fish population decreased
from 50% as a result of the 120 days grading, 43% after
the 166 days grading and 30.2% following 200 days. In
the larger population during the same period the %
females were 91%, 92% and 96.5%. Samples (n = 3–8 per
point) to analyze gene expression were taken at 56 dph
(whole larvae), at 100, 150, 200, 250 dph (body trunks)
and at 300 dph (gonad).
For sample collection, fish were killed with an overdose of
2-phenoxyethanol (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid,
Spain). Whole larvae or dissected tissues in older fish were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C
until used (normally within 3 months).
RNA isolation and reverse transcription
Total RNA was isolated from larvae, gonads and other various tissues of adult sea bass (1.5 years old) with TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (3–5 μg) was
reverse-transcribed in 40 μl at 37°C for 60 min., using 200
units of superscript, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 0.2 units of RNase
inhibitor and 3 μg random-hexamers. Poly (A)+ RNA was
isolated from total RNA using a mRNA purification kit
from Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences (Lisbon, Portugal).
Isolation of the sea bass DAX1 full length cDNA
A pair of oligonucleotide primers (Tildax, Table 1) was
designed based on the sequence of tilapia DAX1 [9] and
used in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) to isolate a 587bp fragment of DAX1 from testis
cDNA. RT-PCR amplification was carried out in 25 μl reactions containing 1 μl of cDNA, 2.5 μl of 10× Buffer
(Promega), 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.04 dNTPs, 0.4 μM sense and
antisense primers, and 0.5 units of taq Polimerase
(Promega) (see also Table 1). Products were separated
and purified from an agarose gel (1%) with the GFX PCR
DNA and Gel Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences),
cloned in pGem Teasy vector (Promega, Madison, USA)
and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product had 90% similarity with that of tilapia DAX1 cDNA.

The sea bass DAX1 fragment was radiolabeled using a random labelling kit (Rediprime II, Amersham-Pharmacia)
and used to screen a sea bass testis cDNA library constructed in Lambda Zap using the UNIZAP vector (Stratagene). After screening 4 × 105 recombinants at moderate
stringency (in Church- Gilbert buffer at 55°C), four independent clones were autoexcised in pBluescript phagemid
using helper phage. Two clones, 2LD and 5LD, each containing a 1373 bp insert, were isolated and completely
sequenced by primer walking. The two clones were identical.
Multisequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
The DAX1 sequences used in the alignments were from
was mapped to Fugu Consortium Scaffold S000386 [33],
tilapia [9], chicken [6], frog [8], human [2] and alligator
[7]. Alignments were performed using the ClustalW [34].
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the ProML Protein Maximum Likelihood program (© Copyright
1986–2001 by the University of Washington).
Southern and northern blot analysis
High molecular weight DNA was isolated from liver of 3
females and 3 males, using a standard extraction method
with phenol:chloroform. Ten μg were digested with 45 U
ECORI (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan) at 37°C over
night and the fragmented DNA was separated on agarose
gel (0.7%), the gel was treated with a 0.250 M HCl, denatured in 1.5 M Nacl/0.5 M NaOH and neutralized in 1.5
M NaCl/0.5 M Tris Base, pH = 8. The DNA was transferred
in 20 × SSC by capillarity onto a nylon membrane
(Hybond XL, Amersham Pharmacia). The membrane was

http://www.rbej.com/content/5/1/19

hybridized with (α-32P) CTP labelled 587 bp DAX1 cDNA
fragment in Perfect Hyb solution (Sigma), according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Probe labelling was by
random priming (Rediprime II, Amersham-Pharmacia).
For northern blot, total mRNA from 3 testes and 3 ovaries
was isolated from 2.5 years old fish as previously
described. The RNA (5 μg for testis and 10 μg from
females) was heat denatured for 5 min (65°C), run on a
1% denaturing formaldehyde gel, and transferred onto a
nylon membrane (Hybond XL, Amersham Pharmacia).
Hybridization with a DAX1 probe covering the full ORF
(Open reading frame) followed the same procedure as
described for Southern blotting analysis.
Gene structure
Different sets of forward (F1-F3) and reverse (R1-R4)
primers were designed according to the sbDAX1 full
length sequence, and used in all possible combinations,
to amplify the intronic sequences present within the
DAX1 gene from liver genomic DNA, isolated as
described.
Relative RT-PCR analysis
In all RT-PCR reactions, 1 μl of cDNA was amplified in a
reaction of 25 μl containing 2.5 μl of 10× Buffer
(Promega), 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.04 dNTPs, 0.4 μM of DAX1
specific primers (sbDAX1 Table 1), and 0.5 units of Taq
polymerase (Promega). The thermocycles were optimised
in order to obtain a single product within the linear range
of RT-PCR amplification. For all samples RT-PCR amplification of 18S rRNA was used as reference in the same con-

ditions as above except for 1.0 mM MgCl2 and 0.4 μM 18S
primers (18S Fw/18S Rv, Table 1). The DAX1 and 18S RTPCR reaction products were separated on agarose gel
(0.7%), denatured (1.5 M Nacl/0.5 M NaOH), neutralized (1.5 M NaCl/0.5 M Tris Base, pH = 8) and transferred
onto nylon membranes (Hybond XL, Amersham Pharmacia) in 6× SSC solution by a standard capillarity method.
The membranes were hybridized with (α-32P) CTP radiolabeled probes (161 bp DAX1 and 450 bp 18S) in
Church Gilbert buffer (65°C), and subjected to stringent
washing (1 × SSC/0.1%SDS and 0.1 × SSC/0.1%SDS) at
65°C. The membrane signals were quantified by phosphorimaging (GS-505 Molecular Imager System, Biorad)
and expressed as the ratio of amplified target to that of 18
S ribosomal RNA.
Statistics
The ratios of DAX1 to 18S were log transformed and the
effects of temperature or grading and age were analysed by
two-way Analysis of Variance followed by the Tukey multiple comparison test with a significance level of 5%.
Unless otherwise stated the results are expressed as mean
± standard error of the mean.

Results
Cloning of sea bass DAX1 and sequence analysis
A 1373 bp DAX1 clone (named sbDAX1) was obtained
from screening approximately 4 × 105 recombinants of a
testis cDNA library. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of
116 bp ends with a partially conserved Kozak sequence
(CCATGGC) signalling the beginning of an open reading
frame (ORF) encoding 301 amino acids (additional file
1). The 3'UTR is approximately 350 bp, and contains a
putative poly adenylation signal at nucleotides 1334–
1340 and a poly(A)+ tail. The sequence has been deposited to Embl (accession number AJ633646). PCR of sea
bass genomic DNA resulted in the amplification of several
DNA fragments covering the coding region of sbDAX1,
but only the primer combination F3-R4 contained a 283
bp intron, located at amino acid positions 221–222,
within the LBD (Figure 2). This intron is located in the
exact position as all other DAX1 genes described so far,
confirming that the structure of this gene is maintained
throughout all taxa.

Multisequence alignment (Figure 3) revealed that the predicted sbDAX1 protein shared highest overall sequence
identity and similarity to Fugu followed by, in descending
order, tilapia, zebrafish, rainbow trout, chicken, frog, alligator and human (Table 2). While a high level of conservation was found for the carboxy terminal region (higher
than 50%), the amino terminus was relatively more
poorly conserved. The main reasons for the poor conservation of the putative DNA binding domain is the much
longer N-terminal human protein compared to all verte-

http://www.rbej.com/content/5/1/19

brates and the presence of region of variable length and
amino acid sequence adjacent to a generally conserved
nuclear LXXLL-like motif (NR box3, Figure 3). In the sea
bass DAX1 this region corresponds to a poly glutamine
stretch composed of 13 Glu (amino acid positions 36–48)
and two extra glutamine repeats composed of 4 and 2 Glu
(amino acid positions 51–54, 57–58). As with all the nonmammalian vertebrates the sbDAX1 protein lacked NR
box1 and NR box2 of the three LXXLL-like repeats present
in the human DAX1 DNA binding domain. Similarly, sea
bass, like chicken, frog, alligator, tilapia, and fugu has
only a partially conserved copy of NR box3 (-NSILYNILKS-) at amino acids positions 17–27 (Figure 3).
Phylogenetic analysis shows that fish DAX1 cluster
together with other fish DAX1 and separate from the tetrapods (Figure 4).
Southern blot analysis showed a single band of similar
size in DNA from both sexes (Figure 5). Northern blot
analysis yielded a single transcript of ~1.3 kb in both
ovary and testis (Figure 6).
Tissue distribution of DAX1 mRNA expression
The pattern of sbDAX1 expression in female and male tissues was determined by relative RT-PCR analysis (Figure
7). sbDAX1 is widely expressed with a relatively balance
expression in the two sexes in brain, pituitary and gonads,
but an apparent male dominance in a range of other tissues, including head and trunk kidney, digestive tract,
heart, liver, muscle and gills.
DAX1 mRNA expression during early development
The expression pattern of sbDAX1 during the temperature
sensitive period for sex differentiation was determined by
relative RT-PCR in larvae from 4 dph to 60 dph (Figure
8A). At 15°C sbDAX1 expression was always detected and
at similar levels in larvae grown at 15°C and 21°C. The
levels of sbDAX1 expression were significantly lower at 18
days, compared to any of the other points sampled (p <
0.05).

The expression pattern of sbDAX1 between 56 dph and
300 dph, encompassing gonadal differentiation, was
determined by relative RT-PCR (Figure 8B). sbDAX1
expression was detected in all samples, and no significant
differences were found between larger and smaller fish. In
both groups significantly lower DAX1 expression was
detected at 150 days (p < 0.005).

Discussion
In this study we have identified a full length cDNA clone
of a DAX1 homolog gene in the European sea bass. The
sbDAX1 cDNA clone encodes a 301 amino acids protein
that shared highest overall sequence identity and similarity to other DAX1 homologs in fish (fugu, tilapia,

Multisequence alignment of DAX1 protein
Multisequence alignment of DAX1 protein. Identical and similar amino acids are marked with asterisks and dots, respectively. The putative DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand binding domain (LBD) are indicated. The conserved LXXLL-like
motif and the AF-2 core, in the DBD and LBD, respectively, are indicated inside boxes.

2 in Figure 3). It has been documented that these LXXLLlike motifs are implicated in nuclear receptor binding,
namely in interacting with SF-1 [35,36], estrogen receptor
[16], androgen receptor [17] and progestin receptor [37].
Moreover it has been shown that all LXXLL-like motifs in
DAX1 are able to interact with other nuclear receptors,
although with different binding affinities [16]. Thus it
appears that DAX1 from sea bass and from other non
mammalian vertebrates is able to interact with nuclear
receptors through the conserved NR box 2.
Intriguingly, however, the sea bass and fugu first LXXLLlike motif is followed by a polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch.
In sea bass, the polyQ stretch is composed of 13
glutamines followed by two extra glutamine repeats composed of 4 and 2 glutamines. In the fugu DAX1 the polyQ
strech is also composed of 17 glutamines but it is uninter-

rupted. In contrast, Nile tilapia contains only seven scattered glutamines within this region, rainbow trout 6 and
zebrafish only 3 [38]. Glutamine is the most common
repeated amino acid in eukaryotic proteins, and it has
been postulated that the introduction of such repeats is a
general evolutionary mechanism for adding new amino
acid sequence [39]. PolyQ stretches are also functionally
associated to human disorders and it has been shown that
the polyQ stretch length is correlated to the appearance of
polyQ peptides in inclusion of highly insoluble aggregates
in the nucleus or cytoplasm [for a review see [40]]. Thus,
aggregation can compromise function by sequestering the
protein away from their usual localization, but also
because these aggregates are able to interact with several
transcription factors harbouring short glutamine repeats
[e.g. cAMP response element binding protein (CBP) and
TATA-binding protein (TBP), [41,42]] via glutamine-

glutamine interactions, or with other interaction partners
[43]. Moreover, it has been shown that expanded polyQ
tracts in genes involved in male sexual differentiation in
tetrapods, result in abnormal sex differentiation. Breeding
the Y chromosome in certain Mus musculus domesticus
strains onto the inbred laboratory mouse strain, C57BL/6J
(B6), results in hermaphroditic progeny, with different
degrees of sex reversal, as a consequence of specific
changes in the predicted polyQ amino acid sequence at
this site [44]. Also, extended polyQ tracts in the transactivation domain of the androgen receptor (AR) are associated to increased risk of defective spermatogenesis and
under masculinisation, depending on the genetic background [45]. Considering the above and although, the

http://www.rbej.com/content/5/1/19

data available is rather small, it is tempting to speculate
that the length of the glutamine stretch in DAX1 from
fishes could be positively correlated to susceptibility to
masculinisation by temperature. While in European sea
bass, with a large number of polyQ, temperatures above
17°C (2–4°C above the natural spawning temperature)
cause masculinisation [26], in Onchorynchus species
(closely related to rainbow trout), zebrafish and tilapia
(with a small number of polyQ), temperatures close to the
lethal upper limit are required for some degree of masculinisation to occur [46-49]. In this hypothesis, the formation of DAX1 aggregates could limit the availability of
active DAX1 protein and reduce its inhibitory action on
masculinising factors, such as SOX-9 [16,17,50]. However, this does not explain the susceptibility to temperature in tetrapods, which appear to be highly dependent on
kinetic properties of the aromatase enzyme [51].
The C-terminal of DAX1, presents a high degree of conservation in all species studied so far. To date, all mutations
in adrenal hypoplasia congenita localize to the C-terminal
part of the gene, suggesting that this region represents the
critical domain for DAX1 function [52]. This domain has
been shown to be responsible for transcriptional silencing
activity in mammalian species in a similar way to a
restricted subset of other members of the nuclear receptor
super family: thyroid hormone (TR), the related oncogene
product v-erbA, retinoic acid receptor (RAR), and the
chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) [11]. The silencing activity of DAX1 is possible due to a bipartite domain in the C-terminal [11] that
corresponds to the helix 3 and helixes 11–12, according to
the DAX1 protein structure prediction when aligning
DAX1 with RAR, TR and v-erbA sequences [11,20]. The
fact that all DAX1 sequences are highly conserved within
these regions, suggests a common mechanism across the
vertebrates. This is further supported by the presence of a
highly conserved AF-2 core sequence at the C-terminal
end.
In the Southern blot a single band was detected in males
and females indicating that DAX1 is the product of a single gene and that it is not sex-specific. Moreover, genomic
DNA amplification of the DAX1 gene in sea bass from
both sexes has also shown that this gene has a two exon
structure, separated by a single intron with 283 bp and
conserved splice sites located at the same region of the ligand binding domain as all other DAX1 genes described so
far. These results confirm what had been observed in the
Southern blot analysis and thus emphasize that in this
species the DAX1 gene is transcribed from a single gene.
Northern blot analysis detected a ~1.3 kb transcript in
gonads of mature (2-year old) fish of both sexes, similar
to that isolated in the testis cDNA library. These results are
similar to those obtained in tilapia [6], chicken [9] and

alligator [7]. In contrast, no expression was detected in
ovary or testis of adult frogs, which was suggested to be
due to the fact that after metamorphosis is complete only
spermatogonia could be found in testis, while in younger
animals, Leydig cells could be detected [8]. The DAX1
mRNA was not confined to reproductive tissues but
instead it was present in all tissues analysed. Although
higher levels of DAX1 were apparent in brain, pituitary
and gonads of female sea bass, the reverse was true for
head kidney, kidney, digestive tract, liver, heart, gills and
muscle. The same broad expression in tissues and differences in expression levels between male in female tissues
have also been documented for tilapia, although male
tilapia brain expressed higher levels of DAX1 [9]. In frog
and mouse DAX1 is also expressed in several tissues other
than the brain-pituitary-gonadal/adrenal axis [8,53]. ERα,
another nuclear receptor, was also higher in female compared to male sea bass liver [54]. Nonetheless, the biological significance of this dimorphic pattern in non
reproductive tissues is hard to interpret at present.
In the sea bass, DAX1 was detected as early as day 4 post
hatching, well before the period of sex differentiation
[21], in accordance with similar observations in other vertebrates [6,8,9,55], including zebrafish [38] and with its
essential role in steroidogenic enzyme and interrenal/
adrenal development [38,56,57]. In fact, recent observations in Danio rerio have underlined the role of DAX1 in
the interrenal development where it has been found that
there is a weak and transient expression of this gene at
approximately 31 hours post fertilization (hpf) in the
interrenal, and also that disruption of DAX1 function by
morpholino oligonucleotides resulted in the down regulation of steroidogenic enzymes StAR and CYP11A in this
tissue [38]. The expression of DAX1, however, did not follow a dimorphic expression pattern at any time during sea
bass development, including the sex differentiation
period. At 150 days (gonadogenesis) there was an apparent decrease in expression, although the tissue analysed
was not exclusively gonads (body trunks). Coincidently,

this is also the period of highest sensitivity to androgen
treatments [58] and when there is a dimorphic pattern of
androgen receptor (AR) α and 11β-hydroxylase mRNA
expression with higher levels in the group dominated by
males [59,60]. Considering this temporal pattern and also
the documented regulation of DAX1 on AR in mammalian species, the DAX1 could be a candidate to regulate the
effects of androgens on gonadal differentiation. In
human, DAX1 protein is able to interact with the AR protein through direct interaction of the DAX1 N-terminal
repeat domain with the AR C-terminal ligand binding and
activation domain [17]. By blocking the interaction of the
N-terminal and C-terminal of the AR, the DAX1 will also
inhibit the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of
the AR, and thus influence the regulation of androgendependent gene transcription in the male reproductive
system [17]. Despite the early expression of DAX1 in sea
bass larvae, we could not detect any influence of temperature on DAX1 expression during the thermo sensitive

period, possibly due to the fact that at this stage (4–60
dph) there is no gonadal development and thus, the
expression levels obtained are from whole body larvae. In
alligators, an increase in gonadal DAX1 expression was
detected during the temperature- sensitive period,
although, as found in sea bass, DAX1 expression was not
sexually dimorphic during gonadogenesis [7].
Although no dimorphic pattern could be detected at the
mRNA level during both thermosensitive period and
gonadal differentiation period, it is possible that at the
protein level, DAX1 is interacting or regulating other proteins that are involved in determining the sexes. Thus,
future studies on protein interactions with the sbDAX1
protein should give us a better insight on the role of this
protein in the process of gonadal differentiation. Also,
immunocytochemistry or in situ hybridization should

help to clarify the early pattern of gonadal DAX1 expression.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have isolated a full length cDNA from
sea bass that has highest identity to other teleost fish
DAX1. The mRNA expression of sbDAX1 shows a dimorphic pattern of expression as higher levels are detected in
the female gonads, brain and pituitary than in males,
although out of this axis this gene is substantially more
expressed in tissues from males than from females. Sea
bass DAX1 is expressed throughout ontogeny from day 4
post hatching until the end of gonadal differentiation
(300 dph), although no dimorphic pattern is observed
between males and females, suggesting that DAX1 is
important for gonadal differentiation but is not sex specific. No effect of temperature was found in DAX1 mRNA

developed into a majority of females (96.0% females) and
smaller fish developed into a majority of males (35.4%
females). Groups covered by horizontal line at the same level
are not statistically different.
