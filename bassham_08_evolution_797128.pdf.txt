Abstract
Background: Gene duplication provides opportunities for lineage diversification and evolution of
developmental novelties. Duplicated genes generally either disappear by accumulation of mutations
(nonfunctionalization), or are preserved either by the origin of positively selected functions in one or both
duplicates (neofunctionalization), or by the partitioning of original gene subfunctions between the
duplicates (subfunctionalization). The Pax2/5/8 family of important developmental regulators has
undergone parallel expansion among chordate groups. After the divergence of urochordate and vertebrate
lineages, two rounds of independent gene duplications resulted in the Pax2, Pax5, and Pax8 genes of most
vertebrates (the sister group of the urochordates), and an additional duplication provided the pax2a and
pax2b duplicates in teleost fish. Separate from the vertebrate genome expansions, a duplication also
created two Pax2/5/8 genes in the common ancestor of ascidian and larvacean urochordates.
Results: To better understand mechanisms underlying the evolution of duplicated genes, we investigated,
in the larvacean urochordate Oikopleura dioica, the embryonic gene expression patterns of Pax2/5/8
paralogs. We compared the larvacean and ascidian expression patterns to infer modular subfunctions
present in the single pre-duplication Pax2/5/8 gene of stem urochordates, and we compared vertebrate
and urochordate expression to infer the suite of Pax2/5/8 gene subfunctions in the common ancestor of
olfactores (vertebrates + urochordates). Expression pattern differences of larvacean and ascidian Pax2/5/
8 orthologs in the endostyle, pharynx and hindgut suggest that some ancestral gene functions have been
partitioned differently to the duplicates in the two urochordate lineages. Novel expression in the larvacean
heart may have resulted from the neofunctionalization of a Pax2/5/8 gene in the urochordates. Expression
of larvacean Pax2/5/8 in the endostyle, in sites of epithelial remodeling, and in sensory tissues evokes like
functions of Pax2, Pax5 and Pax8 in vertebrate embryos, and may indicate ancient origins for these
functions in the chordate common ancestor.
Conclusion: Comparative analysis of expression patterns of chordate Pax2/5/8 duplicates, rooted on the
single-copy Pax2/5/8 gene of amphioxus, whose lineage diverged basally among chordates, provides new
insights into the evolution and development of the heart, thyroid, pharynx, stomodeum and placodes in
chordates; supports the controversial conclusion that the atrial siphon of ascidians and the otic placode in
vertebrates are homologous; and backs the notion that Pax2/5/8 functioned in ancestral chordates to
engineer epithelial fusions and perforations, including gill slit openings.

Background
Ohno's classical model to explain the fate of genes after
gene duplication [1] predicts that one gene duplicate preserves the original gene function while its paralog either
disappears by accumulation of detrimental mutations
(called nonfunctionalization [2]) or occasionally acquires
beneficial mutations that confer novel, positively selected
functions (called neofunctionalization [2]). The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts a third alternative, in which the two duplicate genes
become permanently preserved as a consequence of complementary, degenerative mutations that result in partitioning of ancestral subfunctions, so that the sum of the
functions of two paralogs equals the functions of the original gene prior to the duplication [2,3]. The DDC model
also predicts that after the initial preservation of the two
duplicates, whether by subfunctionalization or from neofunctionalization, further partitioning of redundant subfunctions may occur. Studies show that functional
constraints on genes duplicated in whole-genome duplications are relaxed, compared with singletons, for tens of
millions of years [4]. In addition, novel functions may
originate over time, their evolution facilitated by the relaxation of pleiotropy occasioned by fewer tasks in each
descendent gene duplicate compared with its single copy
gene ancestor [2,5-9].
Understanding the evolution of duplicated genes is
important because of the hypothesis that gene duplicates
provide opportunities for the evolution of reproductive
barriers that lead to lineage divergence [10], and for the
origin of evolutionary novelties [1,11,12]. In vertebrates,
many sets of paralogous genes arose in two rounds of
genome duplication (R1 and R2) that took place in early
vertebrate evolution [12-18]. An additional round of
genome duplication (R3) occurred in the teleost lineage
after ray-fin fish diverged from lobe-fin fish, and provided
additional gene family members observed in many fish
models [19-23]. It has been suggested that the R1 and R2
genome amplifications facilitated the origin of vertebrate
innovations [24], and the R3 event may have facilitated
the teleost species radiation [9,25].
Non-vertebrate chordates often have single copies of vertebrate gene families because their lineages diverged from
the vertebrate lineage before the R1 and R2 genome duplication events. Recent phylogenomic analyses converge on
the conclusion that the chordate subphylum Urochordata, which includes the classes Larvacea and Ascidiacea,
are the closest living relatives of the vertebrates, constituting the group Olfactores (vertebrates + urochordates),
while the subphylum Cephalochordata, including the
amphioxus, diverged basally among chordates ([7,26-30],
reviewed in [9]). As gene duplication is pervasive [31,32],
non-vertebrate chordates sometimes have genes that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/35

duplicated independently in the cephalochordate [33-35]
or urochordate lineages [35-41].
We propose that the comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in a gene family that experienced lineagespecific, independent duplication events, interpreted in a
phylogenetic context and with respect to subfunction partitioning, can help in the inference of ancient gene functions and in the identification of gene functions that arose
by neofunctionalization, and thus may be important for
lineage divergence and the origin of developmental novelties. To test this proposition, we examined the Pax2/5/8
gene family. Pax2/5/8 genes encode transcription factors
with conserved motifs, including a paired domain, homeodomain, and octapeptide, and are associated with mechanosensory development in mammals [42], frogs [43],
fish [44,45], flies [46,47], ascidians [48] and in mollusks
[49], while in a cnidarians, the apparent Pax2/5/8
homolog is associated with nerve and sensory cell differentiation [50,51].
Pax2/5/8 genes duplicated independently in different
chordate lineages. Within the vertebrates, tetrapods have
three members of the Pax2/5/8 gene family (Pax2, Pax5
and Pax8), and teleosts additionally have duplicate pax2
genes ([45] and references therein). In contrast to vertebrates, the basally diverging cephalochordate amphioxus
possesses a single Pax2/5/8 gene that is equally related to
Pax2, Pax5 and Pax8 [52], and urochordates have two
Pax2/5/8 genes (Pax2/5/8a and Pax2/5/8b) [38,53,54] that
originated in a duplication event prior to the divergence of
larvacean and ascidian lineages [38]. The chordate Pax2/5/
8 family embodies a full spectrum of gene evolutionary
events: non-duplication (in amphioxus); independent
duplications (within urochordates and vertebrates); gene
loss (for example, tetrapods have just three of the four paralogs expected from two rounds of genome duplication);
neofunctionalization (for example, vertebrate Pax5 in
lymphocyte development [55]); and ancestral subfunctions appear to have been partitioned between paralogs
within a lineage and, further, differently partitioned
between lineages (for example, Pax2 and Pax8 in fish and
mammal thyroids [56]).
The independent duplication of the stem olfactores' Pax2/
5/8 gene in vertebrate and urochordate lineages provides
replicate evolutionary experiments to explore the principles of subfunction partitioning and the origin of novel
functions. To exploit this opportunity, we provide here a
detailed description of expression patterns for Pax2/5/8
paralogs during development of the larvacean urochordate Oikopleura dioica. We then compare our results with
expression patterns of Pax2/5/8 orthologs in ascidians,
with independently duplicated Pax2/5/8 paralogs in vertebrates, and with the non-duplicated Pax2/5/8 gene in

amphioxus as an outgroup. We discuss the expression of
the Pax2/5/8 gene family during development of the heart,
endostyle, pharynx, and sensory organs, and provide new
insights that reconcile previous conflicting hypotheses
about the homology of the ascidian atrial primordia and
the vertebrate otic placode. This work thus illustrates the
power of comparative analyses of independently duplicated genes to infer ancestral gene subfunctions, modules
that can segregate independently from each other to
evolving gene duplicates.

Results
Functional motif variation and gene structure of chordate
Pax2/5/8 paralogs
Pax2/5/8 proteins are transcription factors, whose
sequence is poorly conserved across Chordata outside of
two functional motifs: the paired domain, which interacts
with the DNA of target genes (dark blue in Figure 1), and
an octapeptide motif (dark green in Figure 1), which is
conserved with other Pax proteins [57], functions in
repression of Pax transactivation [58], and interacts with
other transcriptional cofactors [59]. Sequence alignment
of various chordate Pax2/5/8 proteins (Figure 1) reveals
that while the sequence of the DNA-interacting paired
domain is highly conserved across all chordate Pax2/5/8
proteins analyzed, the octapeptide motif is less conserved.
In urochordates, for instance, the octapeptide is present in
the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi [48], and, contrary to a previous report [60], our alignment reveals it is also present
in Ciona intestinalis Pax2/5/8a (Figure 1A). The octapeptide sequence of the Oikopleura Pax2/5/8a gene is poorly
conserved, and the octapeptide motif is absent from the
expected position in all urochordate Pax2/5/8b proteins
(Figure 1A). Interestingly, we have identified a new motif
(light green in Figure 1B) that is conserved among all
ascidian Pax2/5/8b paralogs, located further toward the
carboxyl end. As this newly recognized sequence shows
some similarities with the octapeptide motif, we have
called it the 'octapeptide-like' motif (bottom Figure 1A).
We could not identify an octapeptide-like motif in the
Oikopleura Pax2/5/8b. Our alignment also reveals a lysinearginine-rich domain (in red in Figure 1) that is conserved
in vertebrate Pax2 and amphioxus Pax2/5/8, is variable
among vertebrate Pax5 and Pax8 paralogs, and is present
in urochordate Pax2/5/8b but not Pax2/5/8a. This protein
motif marks the beginning of an amino acid range identified as important for greatly increasing vertebrate Pax2
protein's transactivation activity [58].

Comparison of gene structures revealed that, while most
chordate Pax2/5/8 genes have 8 to 11 exons, ascidian
Pax2/5/8b paralogs have 20 exons, which code for a protein of about 1300 amino acids, three times longer than
the approximately 400 amino acid-long Pax2/5/8 proteins from other chordates. This difference in size is due

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/35

mainly to an exon more than 1200 nucleotides long
located upstream of the paired domain. Our analysis of
publicly available EST sequences confirmed the presence
of this large exon in gene models predicted for Pax2/5/8b
in Ciona intestinalis (EMSBL ID ENSCINT00000012344)
and in Ciona savignyi (ENSCSAVG00000001640) (data
not shown). This large exon is absent from O. dioica Pax2/
5/8 paralogs and may have evolved in the ascidian lineage
after the divergence of urochordates.
In conclusion, various Pax2/5/8 paralogs appear to have
lost ancestral features and evolved new structural motifs
or new exons, as would be predicted by the DDC model
applied to Pax2/5/8 paralogs evolving after independent
gene duplication events. The identification of these structural features focuses attention on regions to test for function to learn the roles each motif may have played in the
origin of lineage-specific morphologies.
Developmental expression of the Oikopleura paralogs
Pax2/5/8a and Pax2/5/8b
Tailbud stages
At the end of gastrulation, Pax2/5/8a and Pax2/5/8b were
both broadly expressed in the Oikopleura embryo. Pax2/5/
8a was expressed mainly in the ectoderm of the trunk (Figure 2A), while Pax2/5/8b was expressed primarily in the
interior of the trunk (Figure 2B). In early tailbud stages,
Pax2/5/8b expression continued in its broad internal
expression domain (Figure 2D), but Pax2/5/8a expression
became restricted to two domains: a few medial cells at
the boundary of the anterior brain and the pharynx (Figure 2C,C' yellow arrowheads), and a bilateral pair of ectodermal cells in the posterior trunk (Figure 2C,C' red
arrowheads). By mid- and late-tailbud stage, the signal of
the Pax2/5/8a expression domains strengthened (Figure
2E,E' yellow and red arrowheads), and a new domain
appeared in the rostral-most ectoderm of the trunk (Figure 2E, E" black arrowhead), probably labeling the first
two cells fated to invaginate into the stomodeum and
form the oral epithelium (see below; Figure 3A).
Early hatchling and mid-hatchling stages
At the early hatchling stage, Pax2/5/8a expression maintained its late-tailbud stage pattern. The rostral-most
expression domain in the stomodeal region expanded
internally from the surface to form a group of contiguous
internal cells (Figure 3A, black arrowheads), which were
separated from the internal expression domain in presumptive pharynx/endostyle precursor cells (Figure 3A,
yellow arrowhead). The bilateral Pax2/5/8a expression
domain in the posterior part of the trunk included at least
four ectodermal cells in the area where the Langerhans
mechanoreceptors eventually develop (Figure 3A, red
arrowheads), at a level slightly anterior to the tip of the
notochord and adjacent to the homolog of the vertebrate

broad expression domain of Pax2/5/8b that was present at
tailbud stages began to fade at the same time that two separate expression domains became distinct, one in the ectoderm at about the same bilateral position as the Pax2/5/8a

ectodermal domain (Figure 3A', B', red arrowheads) and
the other within the pharynx (Figure 3B, yellow arrowhead). Although Pax2/5/8a and Pax2/5/8b were both
expressed in the ectoderm at the eventual position of the
Langerhans receptors, close inspection revealed differ-

and Pax2/5/8b positive cells (Figure 3A", B"). By midhatchling stages, the bilateral Pax2/5/8a expression
domain expanded to at least six ectodermal cells (Figure
3C"), while the brief flash of Pax2/5/8b expression in the
ectoderm became undetectable (Figure 3C', D', purple
arrowheads). Simultaneously, the distal portion of each

gill pouch began to express Pax2/5/8b. It is not known if
ectodermal cells contribute to the formation of the gill
pouches at these early stages when the ectoderm is still
forming its epithelial character.

the pharynx in time and space: while Pax2/5/8a expression
was diminishing in the stomodeum and the rostral pharynx (Figure 3C, C'), new Pax2/5/8b expression domains
appeared (Figure 3D, D', black and yellow arrowheads).
The proximal endoderm of the gill pouches began to
express Pax2/5/8a while the distal portion of the gill
pouches expressed Pax2/5/8b (Figure 3C, C', D', blue
arrowheads). Presumptive dorsal precursor cells of the
endostyle first began to express Pax2/5/8a, while presumptive ventral endostyle cells expressed Pax2/5/8b (Figure
4C, C', D, white arrowheads).
Late hatchling stages
By the late hatchling stage, organs are distinct and internal
cavities have started to expand. At this stage, the gills and
mouth have opened to the outside, and the heart and the
ciliary rings of the gills have both begun to beat. The direct
development of larvacean urochordates permits the tracing of gene expression domains in organ rudiments from
hatchlings until fully mature adults. In contrast, in ascidian urochordates, many organs begin to develop only at
metamorphosis, just as many chordate-specific characters
disappear.

Pax2/5/8a expression in late hatchling stages overlaps
Pax2/5/8b in some domains: in the distal part of the gills
from the ciliary rings (cr) to the external gill opening (Figure 4, purple arrowheads), and, transiently, in the posterior trunk epidermis (Figure 4A, B, C, red arrowheads).
Other domains are unique to each gene, and in several
regions expression of the paralogs appears complementary. For example, while the lips of the mouth express
Pax2/5/8a (Figure 4A, C, black arrowheads), the pharynx
just internal to the lips strongly expresses Pax2/5/8b (Figure 4B, D, black arrowheads); while dorsal cells of the
endostyle express Pax2/5/8a (Figure 4A, C, white arrowheads), ventral cells of the endostyle express Pax2/5/8b
(Figure 4B, D, white arrowheads); and while the most
posterior section of the rectum expresses Pax2/5/8a (Figure 4A, C, green arrowheads), the anus expresses Pax2/5/
8b (Figure 4D, green arrowhead). Except for the distal part
of the gills, the posterior pharynx exclusively expresses
Pax2/5/8b, including the gill endoderm where the two gill
pouches meet medially (Figure 4B, D, blue arrowheads).
And, strikingly, only one layer of the two-ply heart, the
pericardium, expresses Pax2/5/8b (Figure 4B', D', orange
arrowheads); the muscular myocardium does not.
A subtle metamorphic event called 'tailshift', the rapid
reorientation of the tail from a posterior to a ventral position with respect to the trunk, signals the beginning of the
juvenile stage in Oikopleura. Just prior to tailshift, the two
Pax2/5/8 paralogs continue to show mostly non-overlapping expression patterns, now in clearly differentiated
organs. Pax2/5/8a (Figure 5A) is still expressed around the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/35

mouth (including ciliated sense organs in the upper lip),
in the dorsal, iodine-binding corridor cells of the endostyle, in the gill endoderm, in the rectum, and in a row of
cells at the posterior margin of the oikoplastic epithelium
(a specialized secretory tissue that covers much of the
trunk). Expression of Pax2/5/8b (Figure 5B) is also a continuation of domains identified earlier, including the
pharynx and gills, the ventral endostyle, the anus, and the
pericardium. New domains, however, now appear in dorsal, ventral and lateral fields of the oikoplastic epithelium,
the tissue that will soon secrete the first filter-feeding
'house' the animal inhabits [61]. Figure 5C is a schematic
diagram summarizing the expression domains of both
Oikopleura Pax2/5/8 paralogs in late hatchlings. Table 1
summarizes by tissue and developmental stage all Pax2/5/
8 expression domains.

Discussion
These investigations of the structure and expression of
Pax2/5/8 gene duplicates in Oikopleura, when analyzed in
a comparative context with shared and independent Pax2/
5/8 gene duplications in other chordate lineages, illuminate a variety of problems in the evolution of chordate
developmental mechanisms and the principles that govern change in duplicated gene function over time. The
work resolves alternative hypotheses for the homologies
of the ascidian atrial siphon, illuminates evolution of the
thyroid, identifies candidates for ancestral gene subfunctions, and defines the origin of functional innovations in
this gene family.
Pax2/5/8 and the evolution and development of the
chordate heart
The shared expression of cardiac developmental genes
(for example, Nkx-2.5, dHand, and Mesp1) supports the
homology of bilaterian hearts from chordates to flies [6269]. The evolutionary relationship of the single-chambered heart of non-vertebrate chordates to the individual
chambers of the innovative multi-chamber vertebrate
heart, however, is still unclear (reviewed in [70]). Our
work reveals unprecedented Pax2/5/8 expression in the
developing heart of a chordate, and may provide a late
ontogenetic marker for assessing homology of tissue layers among simple, urochordate hearts.

In contrast to the single-layered heart of cephalochordates, urochordates have a two-layered heart. The simple
heart of Oikopleura dioica consists of two epithelial layers
lying just medial to the left stomach lobe. In Oikopleura
species, the lateral wall of the heart contains the muscle
fibers while the medial wall is a thin pericardial membrane (called 'procardium' in [71]). Peristaltic heart contractions, which periodically reverse, cause the
hemolymph to course between the heart and the stomach
wall [71,72]. In comparison, the ascidian heart rolls up to

become tubular rather than planar, but also has a contractile layer and a non-muscular, pericardial layer (reviewed
in [70]). The larvacean pericardial membrane, therefore,
is the likely homolog of the ascidian pericardium.
In ascidians, heart development can be broadly divided in
two phases (reviewed in [70]). In the first phase, heart cell
precursors become fated during early cleavage and embryonic stages, and after a complex process of muscle cell
migration from the tail to the trunk, heart development
temporarily arrests. In the second phase, after metamorphosis, heart development re-initiates and after final differentiation, the heart starts to beat and becomes
functional. In larvaceans, the transparency and absence of
a drastic metamorphosis provides a complementary
model system for the study of heart development. In O.
dioica, the heart starts beating less than 24 hours post fertilization, before tailshift. In late larvacean hatchlings,
when heart differentiation is at or nearing completion, the
pericardium expresses Pax2/5/8b. In ascidians, however,
neither Pax2/5/8 paralog has been shown to be expressed
in the heart, perhaps because most published analyses of
Pax2/5/8 expression in Ciona, Halocynthia and Herdmania
[48,53,60,73,74] have not included late developmental
stages after metamorphosis (3 to 4 days after fertilization). Therefore, whether Pax2/5/8 expression in the heart

– and more specifically in the pericardium – is a shared
feature among urochordates remains to be investigated.
Cephalochordates have a single-layered, muscularized
blood vessel ventral to the gut that propels the hemolymph by peristalsis [75,76]. During amphioxus development, the primordium of this muscularized vessel
expresses a homolog of vertebrate NK2 class genes – a
group that includes several genes necessary for vertebrate
cardiac development – suggesting that the amphioxus vessel is homologous to the vertebrate heart [69]. Pax2/5/8 is
not reported to be expressed in the circulatory vessels of
amphioxus [52], and likewise, amphioxus has no structure that appears to be morphologically comparable to
the Pax2/5/8-expressing larvacean pericardium or to the
pericardia of ascidians or vertebrates.
In vertebrates, mouse Pax2 and Pax5 are not expressed in
the heart [77,78], and although Pax8 expression has been
detected in the heart of newborn mice, its level was equal
to or less than all other tissues tested except kidney [79],
suggesting that it may represent background levels. No
role for Pax2, Pax5, or Pax8 has been demonstrated in the
heart in knockout mutations in mouse [80-82]. Consistent with these results, our survey of EST databases in NCBI
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov reveals the absence of Pax2/

5/8 genes in the heart transcriptomes of human, mouse,
frogs and zebrafish. Thus, we can infer that Pax2/5/8
expression in the heart was either already present in the
last common ancestor of olfactores (that is, urochordates
+ vertebrates) and lost in the vertebrate lineage, or was a
neofunctionalization event within the urochordates, and
perhaps within larvaceans.
Evidence of Pax2/5/8 subfunction partitioning in thyroid
homologs
The thyroid is an endocrine gland located in the neck ventral to the pharynx in humans and other vertebrates, and
it regulates energy production and growth by synthesizing
tyrosine-based, iodine-containing hormones (T3 and T4).
The presumed homolog of the thyroid in filter-feeding,
non-vertebrate chordates is the endostyle, an organ
located ventral to the pharyngeal floor that functions in
iodine binding and secretion of food-trapping mucus
[83]. The homology between the thyroid and the endostyle is further supported by the expression of similar
molecular markers, including members of the Pax2/5/8
family ([84] and references therein). Our results show that
the larvacean endostyle expresses Pax2/5/8 genes in a pattern similar to that described for amphioxus [52], ascidians [84], and vertebrates [56,85]. The last common
ancestor of all three chordate subphyla, therefore, probably employed a Pax2/5/8 gene in the development of an
endostyle-like organ that evolved into the endostyle of
cephalochordates and urochordates and the thyroid of
vertebrates (Figure 6).

Pax2/5/8 subfunctions related to vertebrate thyroid development have likely suffered independent processes of
subfunction partitioning among paralogs (Figure 6). For
instance, in mouse, Pax8 is expressed during thyroid
development but Pax2 is not [56,85]; in frogs, however,
subfunctions of these genes are reversed, as Pax2 but not
Pax8 is involved in the development of the thyroid [43].
These results suggest that ancestral vertebrate thyroid regulatory subfunctions of Pax2/5/8 were preserved by both
Pax2 and Pax8 in stem amniotes, and resolved independently in the amphibian and mammalian lineages. In
zebrafish, both pax8 and pax2a (previously called pax2.1)
retain thyroid expression, although they are activated at
different times in development [56].
Although the duplication of Pax2/5/8 paralogs in urochordates occurred before the divergence of the larvacean and
ascidian lineages [38] (Additional File 1), the endostyle of
Oikopleura expresses both Pax2/5/8 paralogs (Pax2/5/8a
dorsally, and Pax2/5/8b ventrally), while the endostyle of
ascidians does not express Pax2/5/8b, but expresses Pax2/
5/8a in both the dorsal and ventral domains, the sum of
the pattern for the two Oikopleura duplicates [84]. These
lineage-specific differences in expression patterns of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/35

orthologous Pax2/5/8 duplicates suggest that in the last
common ancestor of larvaceans and ascidians, both Pax2/
5/8a and Pax2/5/8b were expressed both dorsally and ventrally, and that after lineages diverged, in larvaceans the
dorsal and ventral endostyle subfunctions partitioned to
different Pax2/5/8 genes, but in ascidians both subfunctions remained associated with the Pax2/5/8a paralog and
both were lost by the Pax2/5/8b paralog. As vertebrate
Pax8 can directly bind the promoters of thyroid follicle
cell-specific genes such as thyroperoxidase [86], we raise
the hypothesis that urochordate Pax2/5/8a genes, which
are expressed in peroxidase-producing, dorsal cells of the
endostyle [87,88], play a homologous role while urochordate Pax2/5/8b genes have lost this function.
Evidence of Pax2/5/8 subfunction partitioning in the
anterior pharynx and stomodeum
Comparison between ascidians, larvaceans and cephalochordates suggests that stem chordates expressed Pax2/5/8
in the stomodeum and anterior pharynx, but that this
expression domain was lost in the vertebrate lineage. Larvaceans and ascidians both have ciliated mechanosensory
organs that ring the mouth and are involved in a filterfeeding, particle-rejection response [39,89,90]. Although
the oral sensory cell types themselves are morphologically
different in the two urochordate classes, these organs may
share a common origin in a stomodeal sensory placode
that has been lost in the vertebrate lineage [39,73,90-94].
Although both larvacean Pax2/5/8 paralogs are expressed
in this stomodeal domain, their patterns are distinct:
Pax2/5/8a expression in the rostral pharynx of early hatchlings is replaced with Pax2/5/8b by mid-hatchling stages.
In mid-hatchlings, Pax2/5/8a expression is in the external
ectoderm surrounding the mouth opening, including the
two bristle-bearing cells of the upper lip, while Pax2/5/8b
is expressed just inside the mouth, including the ciliated
sensory cells of the circumoral organ. Although the two
mechanosensory cell types fall into expression domains of
different Pax2/5/8 paralogs, they are innervated by the
same branched sensory axons emanating from a pair of
rostral brain cells [39,89].

The single amphioxus Pax2/5/8 gene is expressed both
externally around the developing mouth and internally in
the pharynx [52]; this expression domain corresponds to
the sum of expression domains occupied by different larvacean paralogs, as expected by subfunction partitioning
[2] if the last stem chordate had separate regulatory elements governing the contiguous external and internal
pharyngeal domains that partitioned to different larvacean paralogs after the Pax2/5/8 duplication event.
Ascidian Pax2/5/8a is expressed in the invaginating stomodeum but Pax2/5/8b is expressed in the buccal cavity, a
pattern comparable with the late hatchling expression
domains of the Oikopleura orthologs. At least some sub-

Hypothesis for the evolution of chordate Pax2/5/8 subfunctions
Hypothesis for the evolution of chordate Pax2/5/8 subfunctions. In stem chordates, Pax2/5/8 already played a role
during the development of the endostyle, the homolog of the vertebrate thyroid, as well as in controlling genes for making epithelial fusions and perforations (for example, gill openings). The Pax2/5/8 subfunction related to the development of neurogenic placodes (for example, otic placode) appears to be restricted to the olfactores; like vertebrate orthologs, urochordate
Pax2/5/8a genes are expressed from just after neurula stage in paired thickenings overlapping the early expression of other placode-marking genes [39]. Inferred origins for some of the functions (circles in stems) performed by the pleiotropic Pax2/5/8
gene family and inferred subfunction partitioning are schematized in the context of the chordate phylogeny. Gene duplication
events (stars) in different chordate lineages permitted independent partitioning of endostyle/thyroid (red circles) and otic placode (blue circles) subfunctions among gene paralogs. Half semicircles denote dorsal and ventral expression domains. Pale blue
circles denote paralogs whose expression is inferred to have become delayed, transient or spatially narrowed in development
of the otic system. White circles indicate inferred subfunction losses. [43,45,48,52,56,73,84,85,118,119].

functions, therefore, appear to have partitioned between
Pax2/5/8 paralogs before the larvacean and ascidian lineages diverged. The ascidian Pax2/5/8a gene, however,
appears to lack expression comparable with the early,
internal expression of Oikopleura Pax2/5/8a in the rostral
pharynx, a difference that may derive from the developmental delay and incomplete development of endodermal organs experienced by ascidian larvae compared with
the uninterrupted and complete endodermal ontogeny in
larvaceans.
Pax2/5/8 expression and the Langerhans receptor,
ascidian atrial siphon, and vertebrate otic placode
The expression of Pax2/5/8 genes in the Langerhans receptors of Oikopleura helps us understand apparently conflicting interpretations of the ancestral role of Pax2/5/8 in the
origin of the vertebrate otic placode. Previous evidence
supports the notion that larvacean Langerhans receptors
are homologous to hair cell-like sensory organs in the
ascidian atrium, the chamber surrounding the branchial
basket [39,73,95]. Expression of Pax2/5/8a in the ascidian
atrium and expression of Pax2 and Pax8 in the vertebrate
hair cell-producing otic placode suggested the hypothesis
that the atrium of ascidians is homologous to the otic vesicles of vertebrates [48].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/35

are expressed at the stomodeal placode and the putative
acousticolateralis placode homolog (the Langerhans
organ primordia). Therefore, in contrast to ascidians, in
which hair cell-like organs and sites of perforation are
conflated in the atrium [95], Oikopleura's paired mechanosensory organs are topographically separate from the
gill openings.
In agreement with the perforation argument [52,99],
expression of Oikopleura Pax2/5/8 as in amphioxus, in the
gill openings and anus, which lack sensory cell types, supports the hypothesis of an ancient function for Pax2/5/8 in
the adhesion and fusion of epithelial layers and in the
promotion of epithelial perforations. On the other hand,
expression of Oikopleura Pax2/5/8a at early tailbud stage in
the primordia of the Langerhans organs occurs long
before the fusion of the gill endoderm with the ectoderm,
which happens at the late hatchling stage. This timing gap
argues against the interpretation that early expression of
Pax2/5/8 in the Langerhans domain is associated only
with remodeling the extracellular matrix for gill perforation. Instead, early Pax2/5/8 expression defines the location of paired, thickened sensory organ primordia, in
agreement with the hypothesis of Wada et al. [48] that
Pax2/5/8 marks a urochordate placode. Larvacean Pax2/5/
8 expression adds to a growing body of morphological
and gene expression data that supports the origin of cranial placodes in early chordates, rather than in vertebrates,
as had been long assumed [39,48,73,93-95], [100-105],
and strengthens the case for an early origin specifically of
the otic or acousticolateralis placode.

An alternative to the 'placode hypothesis', however, arose
from the finding that in amphioxus, the developing gill
slits and mouth express Pax2/5/8. This alternative suggests
that Pax2/5/8 expression in the atrial primordium of
ascidians reflects an ancient gene function in the perforation, adhesion and fusion of epithelial layers, such as in
the epithelia of gill openings, rather than the homology of
atrial primordia and vertebrate placodes [52]. The 'epithelial fusion hypothesis' is consistent with the finding that
among vertebrates, Pax2 apparently plays a role in gill slit
perforation in Xenopus [96] and Pax8 is necessary for vaginal opening in mouse [97]. Furthermore, Pax2 and Pax8
regulate genes that control the composition of the extracellular matrix in epithelial fusions [42,98].

Therefore, analysis of Pax2/5/8 paralogs in Oikopleura has
allowed us to reconcile the 'placode hypothesis' and 'epithelial fusion hypothesis', supporting an evolutionary scenario in which the role of Pax2/5/8 in epithelial fusions
and perforations was already present in stem chordates,
and the role of Pax2/5/8 related to placode development
is likely also ancient, though perhaps restricted to Olfactores (Figure 6).

Evidence to resolve this dilemma comes from examination of gene expression and organ structure in a phylogenetic context. Our analysis of larvacean Pax2/5/8
expression teases apart epithelial fusion from placode formation and suggests that Pax2/5/8 likely functioned in
both processes in ancient chordates. In Oikopleura, several
Pax2/5/8 expression domains can be grouped into two
overlapping categories: sites of epithelial fusion and sites
of sensory cell development. At the sites of epithelial
fusion, larvacean Pax2/5/8 paralogs are expressed at the
junction of the gill pouch with the epidermis, the joining
of the rectum to the epidermis at the anus, and the fusion
of the stomodeum and pharynx at the mouth. At sites of
sensory cell development, Oikopleura's Pax2/5/8 paralogs

Evolution of Pax2/5/8 genetic pathways
Pax, Eya, Six and Dach genes form a genetic network in
several biological processes, including in sensory placode
development (reviewed in [81,106]). Pax2, Pax5, Pax8,
Eya1, Six1, and Dach1 are co-expressed during fish otic
vesicle development (see for example [107,108]), where
they interact to specify otic tissue and maintain its continued ontogenesis. Larvacean Pax2/5/8 genes are expressed
in presumptive sensory tissues previously reported also to
express Eya and Six orthologs [39], namely around the
mouth and in the mechanosensory Langerhans receptors.
The two Pax2/5/8 paralogs may interact with different subsets of Eya-Six-Dach genes in different tissues. For
instance, in developing sensory tissues, Pax2/5/8a expres-

BMC Biology 2008, 6:35

sion in tailbud and early hatchling stages is similar to that
of Eya and Six3/6a in the developing Langerhans receptor
primordia, and to Six1/2 and Six3/6a expression around
the mouth, including sensory cilia-bearing cells of the
upper lip. Endodermal Pax2/5/8b expression, on the other
hand, most strongly overlaps that of Six3/6a in the rostral
pharynx and Eya in the gill endoderm in mid-hatchling
stages. Similarly, ascidian Pax2/5/8a expression overlaps
Eya and Six1/2 in the atrial primordia and Eya, Six1/2, and
Six3/6 in the stomodeal domain, but Pax2/5/8b exhibits
broad expression in the ectoderm and may also overlap
Eya, Six1/2, and Six3/6 in a way that larvacean Pax2/5/8b
does not [73]. Such differences between presumed Pax2/
5/8 paralogs and orthologs is further evidence that,
though the Pax-Six-Eya-Dach 'module' is conserved at the
level of gene families, paralogs within each module may
differ both within a developmental program and between
lineages [39,99]. Not surprisingly, then, sequence analysis
shows that several known protein interaction domains
differ between the larvacean Pax2/5/8 paralogs and
between the larvacean and ascidian orthologs (Figure 1),
consistent with divergence of the molecular pathways in
which these Pax proteins participate.
Pax2/5/8 gene duplications and the evolution of gene
functions
A requirement for partitioning of ancestral gene functions
is that the ancestral gene must have multiple independently
mutable functions either in protein-coding domains or in
regulatory elements that drive restricted expression: in
other words, units that are by definition 'subfunctions'.
Direct evidence for independently mutable Pax2/5/8 subfunctions in an extant gene comes from the Drosophila
ortholog, called D-Pax2, in which mutations in separate
regulatory elements affect development of either ommatidia or sensory bristles [109]. The known functions of
vertebrate Pax2/5/8 genes are diverse and include the
establishment of the midbrain-hindbrain border [110113], specification and mature function of thyroid follicular cells [85], specification and morphogenesis in the
pronephros [80], differentiation of interneuron subtypes
in the central nervous system (see for example [114]), promotion of correct axon guidance in the optic nerves [115],
and morphogenesis and sensory cell specification in the
epibranchial, otic and lateral line sensory placodes (see
for example [96]). It is not known, however, how many of
these functions, segregated among extant genes, resulted
from independently mutable ancestral subfunctions.

From the partially overlapping expression patterns of vertebrate Pax2/5/8 genes, we can infer that subfunction partitioning has occurred in this gene family. Next,
comparative analysis of expression domains in the chordate phylogenetic context helps us infer when subfunctions arose. Parallel, independent partitioning of Pax2/5/8

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/35

endostyle/thyroid functions in both vertebrate and urochordate lineages suggests that the single Pax2/5/8 gene of
stem olfactores had already acquired independently
mutable regulation for endostyle/thyroid expression.
Likewise, paralleling segregation of mammalian otic placode subfunctions to Pax2 and Pax8 [42,45], larvacean
otic placode-like tissues express only one Pax2/5/8 paralog
early and in a pattern overlapping orthologs of other vertebrate placode markers of the Six and Eya gene families
[39] (Figure 6). It remains possible, though, that despite
the similarity between vertebrate and urochordate Pax2/5/
8 gene expression patterns, each lineage separately
evolved independently mutable functions in the endostyle/thyroid and otic placode development and that the
ancestral gene did not already bear these subfunctions.
Within the urochordate lineage, further parsing of gene
functions may represent subfunctions that were present in
the ancestral urochordate Pax2/5/8 gene. For example, at
some sites of epithelial fusion, larvacean Pax2/5/8 paralogs exhibit complementary expression, for example just
outside (Pax2/5/8a) or just inside (Pax2/5/8b) the mouth
and just outside (Pax2/5/8b) or just inside (Pax2/5/8a) the
anus. Therefore, though a role in epithelial fusions is
probably ancient in Chordata, urochordate paralogs may
have taken on separate refinements of the same function.
In addition to the partitioning of ancestral functions, we
might also expect to detect apparent neofunctionalizations of gene duplicates, particularly when we compare
deeply diverging lineages such as vertebrates and urochordates. The role of vertebrate Pax5 in the B-lymphoid lineage of the immune system might be one example of a
vertebrate neofunctionalization [55]. Similarly, because
no comparable expression can be found outside of Urochordata, a role for Pax2/5/8b in the pericardium of the
heart could be a novel deployment of Pax2/5/8 exclusive
to the urochordates or even to the larvacean lineage.
Though observed Pax2/5/8 expression patterns are consistent with a hypothesis of ancestral subfunction partitioning, this analysis detects only transcriptional
regulatory differences and might underestimate the extent
of actual subfunction partitioning. For example, mRNA
expression of the paralogs may overlap in a given tissue,
but the structurally different proteins the genes encode
may not have redundant functions in those tissues. In
addition, post-transcriptional regulation would also be
missed in our analysis. Partitioned genes likely continue
to evolve after their initial partitioning, and such divergence could complicate distinguishing subfunctionalization from neofunctionalization when comparing gene
functions in deeply diverging lineages. Nonetheless, functional analysis of urochordate Pax2/5/8 genes could help
distinguish between ancestral chordate subfunction parti-

tioning and convergent patterns of neofunctionalization.
For example, if Pax2/5/8 proteins carry out a similar function in the vertebrate thyroid as in the urochordate endostyle, this would be more concrete evidence that an
ancient function was partitioned to paralogs in both chordate subphyla.

Conclusion
The present work shows how analyzing the evolution of
gene families that have experienced multiple independent
gene duplication events in related lineages can improve
understanding of the evolution of the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of homologous structures of anatomically divergent organisms (for example
the endostyle of non-vertebrate chordates and the thyroid
of vertebrates), and can help to identify gene subfunctions
that otherwise may be difficult to recognize because of
extensive pleiotropy (for example, Pax2/5/8 subfunctions
in epithelial fusions around perforations and development of placode derivatives). Analysis of the evolution of
subfunctions in a phylogenetic context identifies lineage
specific innovations (for example, placode derivative
homologs in olfactores). The modular fashion in which
gene subfunctions partition after independent gene duplication events in various lineages implies the existence of
independent regulatory elements that control temporal
and spatial expression for each subfunction. For instance,
comparison of Pax2/5/8 expression patterns in the endostyles of amphioxus, Oikopleura, and ascidians predicts the
presence of separable regulation for expression in the
iodine-binding dorsal component and the supporting
ventral component of the endostyle/thyroid, a hypothesis
that remains to be tested. The identification of the complete set of gene orthologs and paralogs in gene families
in an increasing number of completely sequenced
genomes will likely reveal additional cases of independent
gene duplications and subfunctionalization events, the
analysis of which will improve our understanding of the
evolution of gene functions and the implications in the
evolution and diversity of living forms.

Methods
Biological materials
Oikopleura dioica animals were collected in the Pacific
Ocean near the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (Charleston, OR), and were cultured in the laboratory at the
University of Oregon (Eugene, OR, USA) at 13°C in 10
μm-filtered seawater for several generations. The transparency of Oikopleura embryos and adults allows non-invasive study of internal anatomy at the level of individual
cells and the tracing of organs from embryo to adult. For
some images, we merged DIC optical sections using
Adobe Photoshop software to integrate images of structures that spanned multiple focal planes.

Whole-mount in situ hybridization
Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as
described [116,117] with minor modifications. Fixed,
dehydrated embryos were dechorionated manually with
glass needles before re-hydration; to reduce background,
Tween-20 concentration was increased from 0.1% to
0.15% in the hybridization buffer, PBT solution and posthybridization washing buffers. Embryos were mounted in
80% glycerol for microscopy. Riboprobes for detecting the
expression of Pax2/5/8a and Pax2/5/8b (Genbank accession numbers, respectively: AY870648, AY870649) genes
are described in [38].
