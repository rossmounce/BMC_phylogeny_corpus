Abstract
Background: Phylogeographic reconstruction of some bacterial populations is hindered by low
diversity coupled with high levels of lateral gene transfer. A comparison of recombination levels
and diversity at seven housekeeping genes for eleven bacterial species, most of which are
commonly cited as having high levels of lateral gene transfer shows that the relative contributions
of homologous recombination versus mutation for Burkholderia pseudomallei is over two times
higher than for Streptococcus pneumoniae and is thus the highest value yet reported in bacteria.

Despite the potential for homologous recombination to increase diversity, B. pseudomallei exhibits
a relative lack of diversity at these loci. In these situations, whole genome genotyping of
orthologous shared single nucleotide polymorphism loci, discovered using next generation
sequencing technologies, can provide very large data sets capable of estimating core phylogenetic
relationships. We compared and searched 43 whole genome sequences of B. pseudomallei and its
closest relatives for single nucleotide polymorphisms in orthologous shared regions to use in
phylogenetic reconstruction.
Results: Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of >14,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms yielded
completely resolved trees for these 43 strains with high levels of statistical support. These results
enable a better understanding of a separate analysis of population differentiation among >1,700 B.
pseudomallei isolates as defined by sequence data from seven housekeeping genes. We analyzed this
larger data set for population structure and allele sharing that can be attributed to lateral gene
transfer. Our results suggest that despite an almost panmictic population, we can detect two
distinct populations of B. pseudomallei that conform to biogeographic patterns found in many plant
and animal species. That is, separation along Wallace's Line, a biogeographic boundary between
Southeast Asia and Australia.
Conclusion: We describe an Australian origin for B. pseudomallei, characterized by a single
introduction event into Southeast Asia during a recent glacial period, and variable levels of lateral
gene transfer within populations. These patterns provide insights into mechanisms of genetic
diversification in B. pseudomallei and its closest relatives, and provide a framework for integrating
the traditionally separate fields of population genetics and phylogenetics for other bacterial species
with high levels of lateral gene transfer.

Background
Efforts to understand the evolutionary history of organisms have benefited from the availability of increasing
amounts of molecular data, especially whole genome
sequences (WGSs). The availability of multiple WGSs has
led to more accurate reconstructions of phylogenetic relationships within several bacterial species [1-9], but all of
these studies have been limited by a small number of
WGSs (19 or fewer genomes). The availability of multiple
WGSs per species is currently quite rare, but the cost of
generating WGSs continues to decline and it is anticipated
that future phylogenetic studies will routinely employ
multiple WGSs.
Due to their short evolutionary history and clonality,
Bacillus anthracis [5] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [10]
were ideal models for pioneering phylogenetic work using
multiple WGSs, but hurdles in phylogenetic reconstruction persist for other species. The genomes of these two
species exhibit almost no homoplasy (the appearance of
similar character states in unrelated samples due to evolutionary convergence or parallelisms) due to their recent
species derivation and complete clonality. Thus, character
differences, as measured by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are assumed to have arisen only once in
their evolutionary history. Also, these two species exhibit
no evidence of conspecific lateral gene transfer (LGT),
which can cause apparent homoplasy by placing alleles with

common origins in different genetic backgrounds. In contrast, most bacterial species, including Burkholderia pseudomallei, have a longer history of mutation accumulation,
as well as a history of LGT [11-13], which increase the
probability of homoplasy and apparent homoplasy, respectively. Thus, for all but the most recently emerged and
clonal species, fine-scale phylogenetic reconstruction has
been elusive using common genetic markers. Recent
sequencing efforts for B. pseudomallei and other closely
related species provided the opportunity for pioneering
phylogenetic work on a species with high levels of LGT.
B. pseudomallei causes the severe disease melioidosis [14]
and is widely distributed in soil and fresh water in Southeast Asia and tropical Australia [15]. Animal to animal
transmission is rare but a wide variety of animals can be
infected [16,17], reseeding nearby areas [17,18] and providing limited dispersion for this otherwise immobile species. These small-scale movements should be reflected in
the population structure of B. pseudomallei, with geographic barriers such as oceans being traversed rarely or
not at all. A monophyletic group of isolates within the B.
pseudomallei group has diverged to become an equine
pathogen, B. mallei [16], which does not survive well in
soil. Like B. pseudomallei, the closely related B. thailandensis and B. oklahomensis live in soil but are much less pathogenic and are phylogenetically distinct from B.
pseudomallei/B. mallei [19].

Various molecular methods have been used for phylogenetic reconstruction of these Burkholderia species, with different levels of success. Multiple-locus variable number
tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) of B. pseudomallei
and B. mallei is effective for determining relationships
among very closely related isolates, but not broad patterns
of relatedness [20,21]. Multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) of seven housekeeping genes [22] can be used to
identify epidemiologically linked isolates of the same
sequence type (ST) and determine phylogenetic relationships at a species level [16], but efforts to infer relationships among STs within B. pseudomallei have yielded little
statistical support [16,23,24]. This is due to homologous
recombination within and possibly among B. thailandensis, B. pseudomallei, and B. mallei [11-13,24,25], as well as
limitations of restricted gene sampling in highly recombining populations [26]. Microarray-based comparative
gene hybridization analysis of 23 strains from these three
Burkholderia species avoided problems associated with
limited gene sampling by targeting close to 7,000 open
reading frames discovered from the WGS of a single B.
pseudomallei isolate, K96243 [27]. However, the subsequent phylogeny derived from this work was heavily
weighted towards isolates from Southeast Asia [27] and
may not be representative of the global evolution of these
species. Thus, the need for a comprehensive phylogeny
with extensive character sampling persists.

recombination.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic patterns revealed by shared, orthologous
SNPs derived from WGSs
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 11,208 orthologous
SNPs shared among all WGSs confirmed the distant relationship of B. thailandensis and the monophyletic derivation of B. mallei from a B. pseudomallei lineage (Figure 1).
These SNPs were identified by comparing and searching
WGSs of 23 B. pseudomallei, ten B. mallei, five B. thailandensis, and five other near neighbor isolates (Additional
file 1), followed by removal of paralogous and nonshared SNP loci. The phylogenetic position of MSMB43,
an Australian isolate with many B. thailandensis characteristics, appears sister to B. thailandensis and B. pseudomallei/
mallei, a result consistent with MLST phylogenetic analysis
[32].

Excluding distant taxa increases the proportion of the
genome that is shared among remaining taxa. Thus, when
progressively smaller groups of isolates are compared, a
larger number of orthologous shared SNP loci can be
found. Excluding distant taxa also improves phylogenetic
accuracy by avoiding problems associated with long
branch attraction [33]. This approach, which provided

Here, we construct a robust, large-scale phylogeny of B.
pseudomallei and its close relatives, overcoming significant
problems associated with LGT and SNP discovery by using
a large number of orthologous SNP loci distributed across
the entire genome and shared among 43 fully sequenced
genomes. We compare these findings to broad population
patterns determined using sequence data from seven
housekeeping genes in a global collection of >1,700 isolates. To our knowledge, this broad-scale integration of
phylogenetics from whole genome sequence comparisons
and population genetics from extensive MLST data in a
spatial context is unprecedented for this species and pro-

Whole genome SNP phylogenies are highly accurate in
terms of defining both branching order and branch
lengths, despite collapsed secondary branches that lead to
isolates that have not been sequenced [5,28,29]. SNPs are
more evolutionarily informative than most other types of
molecular markers due to intrinsically slow mutation
rates, few character states, and extensive distribution
across the entire genome. In addition, a large number of
shared, orthologous SNP loci facilitate robust characterization of deep relationships and high resolution among
closely related individuals [28,30,31]. However, because
SNPs are relatively rare and scattered throughout a
genome, WGSs from multiple strains are required for
identification.

high levels of statistical support, utilized results from previous, more global analyses to identify outgroups for rooting phylogenetic trees. In this way we were able to confirm
the location of MSMB43 by eliminating the WGSs of B.
ubonensis and B. dolosa from our SNP discovery procedure
and subsequent phylogenetic analysis (tree not shown).
Similarly, by retaining only B. thailandensis as an outgroup
for rooting, we searched for the first isolate or group of
isolates to diverge from the B. pseudomallei/B. mallei clade.
The close proximity of the deep bifurcation points in this
clade is likely due to a radiation event, or to the cohesive
forces of LGT that led to a limited number of SNPs separating these bifurcation points. This resulted in unresolved deep branches despite using 17,718 SNPs in a
Bayesian analysis (Additional file 2). We further analyzed
these data using Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Parsimony, and Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic methods
alongside a data set of 67,644 SNPs obtained by relaxing
the criteria for SNP selection (see methods and Additional
file 3). All analyses including the Bayesian analysis show
that the Australian isolates share a more ancient common
ancestor than the Asian isolates, and both Maximum Parsimony and Neighbor-Joining analyses suggest that B.
pseudomallei isolate 668 was the first isolate to diverge
from the B. pseudomallei/B. mallei clade. Thus, we used B.
pseudomallei isolate 668 as an outgroup for rooting our B.
pseudomallei/B. mallei phylogeny, which was constructed

using 14,544 SNPs shared only among B. pseudomallei and
B. mallei genomes (Figure 2). The conclusions that we
draw are contingent on an Australian root to this tree and
not isolate 668 in particular.
All B. pseudomallei bifurcations received the highest possible level of statistical support (Figure 2). The Australian
population of B. pseudomallei is more ancient than either
the Asian B. pseudomallei group or the B. mallei group.
The Australian isolates form a deep paraphyletic group
within the B. pseudomallei/B. mallei phylogeny, and the
most divergent isolates in this group are five isolates from
Australia and E208 from Ecuador (Figure 2). The remaining isolates form two clades: the B. mallei clade and a
group of B. pseudomallei dominated by Asian isolates.
The phylogenetic position of B. mallei confirms previous
research suggesting that this species arose from a B. pseudomallei lineage and experienced a recent radiation [16].
Our results suggest that none of the B. pseudomallei isolates included in this study are closely related to the B.
mallei clone, and all Asian B. pseudomallei isolates fall
into a single coherent group that diverged relatively
recently, after the split with B. mallei.

LGT events may have had only a slight effect on phylogenetic topology, suggesting that while most events are

Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of these SNPs result in clade credibility values of 1.00 for all bifurcations (except 23344/JHU =
0.96) (B). B. thailandensis was used to root this tree (see Additional file 3).

space, some highways of gene sharing may exist. Homoplastic SNPs are located throughout shared genomic
regions and are interspersed with non-homoplastic SNPs,
suggesting that all regions may have been subject to LGT
events and that such events likely involved small stretches
of DNA (Additional file 4a). Our test of residual homoplasies (materials and methods) resulted in a tree that is
remarkably similar to the previous topology (Additional
file 4b,c). Topological similarities have three explanations: 1) a lack of preferential transfer of DNA always
involving the same lineages (no highways of gene sharing),
2) convergent or reverse mutations evenly spread
throughout the phylogeny, and 3) sequencing errors
evenly spread throughout phylogenetic space. Stochastic
variation in homoplastic mutations and sequencing errors
may explain topological differences within the B. mallei
clade, which was mostly supported by non-homoplastic
characters. Stochastic variation in all three parameters
may be sufficient to cause topological differences among
B. pseudomallei relationships, however as three of the four
changed bifurcations remain statistically robust, we suspect that some LGT events consistently involved the same
lineages. The congruency between trees created with
homoplastic SNPs and all orthologous shared SNPs further increases our confidence that depicted phylogenetic
relationships provide a reasonable hypothesis for the
actual patterns of descent for the individual isolates. As
the addition of more taxa increases phylogenetic accuracy
[34], we suspect that the actual patterns of vertical descent
will become even more distinct as more genomes are
sequenced. This confirms the appropriateness of depicting
the core evolutionary history of this set of organisms with
a phylogenetic tree, rather than a network, as individual
LGT events do not involve a large enough portion of the
genome to disrupt the core phylogenetic patterns. In other
words, despite high levels of LGT, the underlying core evolutionary trajectory can be determined and follows a
bifurcating pattern. Indeed, as the evolutionary history of
individual genes are determined, mapping these events
onto the core phylogenetic tree will provide insights into
gene flow within a species and will cause the core tree to
appear more network-like. These analyses reveal the value
and necessity of whole genome orthologous SNPs for
defining patterns of descent even in organisms that are
not completely clonal, with high levels of LGT. Sequence
comparisons from a small number of genes such as MLST
schemes would be grossly insufficient for defining these
relationships.
Gene flow dynamics revealed by MLST data
While the use of 23 WGSs from a single species is a high
number for microbial phylogenetic studies, this number
will seem more and more diminutive as the cost and
speed of sequencing technologies increase. However,
until the day when hundreds of genomes from a single

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/78

species are sequenced, phylogenetic analyses will suffer
from limited taxon sampling that may not represent natural diversity. It is therefore imperative that such phylogenetic information be integrated with data from a wider
sampling of isolates, even though genotyping data will be
more limited. Despite the limitations of MLST and the
program eBURST [35] for phylogenetic inferences to
determine exact evolutionary relationships between individual isolates [26,36], a large amount of MLST data
nonetheless represents a valuable resource from which
population-level trends can be gleaned. Analysis of allele
frequencies can facilitate recognition of distinct populations, and comparisons of allelic diversity among populations are informative since ancient populations are
expected to be more diverse than more recent populations, wherein genetic diversity is limited by founder
effects [37]. Also, levels of intra- and inter-population
connectedness, as measured by allele sharing, can be suggestive of levels of horizontal gene transfer and relatedness. Lastly, MLST data can be used to estimate levels of
recombination that provide insights into LGT frequencies
from measuring homoplasy, the standardized index of
association [38] and the relative contribution of recombination and mutation in generating diversity [39]. We
therefore analyzed MLST data from >1,700 isolates of B.
thailandensis, B. pseudomallei, and B. mallei from an online
database http://bpseudomallei.mlst.net downloaded on
July 28, 2008. B. pseudomallei isolates in this database
were collected from human and animal infections as well
as a variety of environmental sources. As might be
expected, STs that are found in clinical and animal cases
are a subset of those found in the environment. Approximately 47% of STs are from Southeast Asia, 45% are from
Australasia, and 8% are from other geographic regions.
The extant B. pseudomallei form two populations: one
composed largely of Australian isolates and one composed largely of Southeast Asian isolates (Î¦PT = 0.117; P =
0.001; Figure 3). The existence of these distinct populations was confirmed using a systematic analysis of MLST
data. A Bayesian-based clustering algorithm [40] was used
to assign individual STs to populations with no a priori
determination of the groupings (Figure 3). For each iteration, each ST is assigned to one of K populations. The proportion of iterations where a ST is assigned to each
population is indicated by different colors and sums to
one. Sorting STs into three geographically based categories
(Australasia, Southeast Asia, and the rest of the world)
confirmed the existence of two major populations and
their geographic relationship. Increasing the value of K
retained the two major populations but with further subdivision in both, indicating that the coherence of either
population is not merely an artefact of intensive sampling
in a single geographic region. STs incorrectly attributed to
a geographic region either by mistake or by not taking into

account the travel history of a patient [41] are easily identified by colored bars that are distinct from the surrounding vertical bars, indicating that they are genetically more
similar to a different group, and providing further confidence in these results. STs from the rest of the world did not
form a separate population even as K was increased, but
rather were assigned to either the Australasian or Southeast Asian population, again suggesting that the observed
patterns are not the result of uneven geographic sampling.
Most of these STs are from isolates found in temperate
geographic regions not normally associated with B. pseudomallei. It seems likely that such isolates are associated
with either recent travel to endemic areas, or relatively
recent introduction events. The statistically significant Î¦PT
value suggests that these two populations are sexually isolated from each other, while FST values show the divergence of each population from an estimated ancestral
population (FST = 0.03 and 0.21 for the Australasian and
Southeast Asian populations, respectively). The low divergence of the Australasian population and high divergence
of the Southeast Asian population is expected, given our
phylogenetic analyses which show that the Australasian
population is paraphyletic and ancestral to the monophyletic Southeast Asian population.
The ancestral nature of the Australasian B. pseudomallei
population was also confirmed with other analyses. An
eBURST population snapshot of the MLST data depicts the
connectedness of all 641 STs identified among the >1,700
isolates (Figure 4). The periphery of this population snapshot is dominated by singleton STs, mostly from Australia, that share few, if any, loci with other STs. The large
central complex contains STs that share many alleles
across the seven loci; these isolates are mostly from Southeast Asia, although some are Australasian. The next largest
complex is comprised solely of B. thailandensis STs, none
of which share >4 alleles with any STs from the other species. Conversely, B. mallei is represented by just two STs
that differ from each other by a single SNP in one locus,
and also share as many as five loci with some B. pseudomallei STs.

There is a high degree of interconnectedness in the Southeast Asian population of B. pseudomallei that is not
observed in the Australasian population (Figure 4). The
Southeast Asian population contains a smaller number of
MLST alleles, but they are mixed into a greater number of
STs compared to the Australasian isolates (Figure 5).
While the lower allelic diversity in the Southeast Asian
population may be due to purging genetic novelties
through recombination, this pattern is consistent with
founder effects. Indeed, the greater allelic diversity of the
Australasian population and its greater SNP-based diversity are consistent with the ancestral nature of the Australasian population as defined by phylogenetic analysis of
the WGSs. The greater number of single, double, and triple locus variants in the Southeast Asian population suggests that this population recombines more frequently
than the Australasian population (Figure 6), or the Australasian population contains a much deeper gene pool,
resulting in any two isolates having a lower probability of
obtaining the same MLST allele.
Other measurements of the extent of LGT within a species
suggests that recombination plays a much greater role
than mutation in generating diversity in MLST loci for B.
pseudomallei. We measured the standardized index of association [38], the relative contribution of recombination
and mutation in generating diversity [39], and the average
Nei's [42] diversity across MLST loci, for B. pseudomallei as
well as 10 other species, some of which are often cited as
being highly recombinagenic with regard to the relative
contribution of recombination versus mutation. For Neisseria meningitidis [43], Streptococcus pneumoniae [43], Enterococcus faecium [44], Staphylococcus epidermidis [45] and
Staphylococcus aureus [46], we used previously published
values for the ratio of recombination to mutation. All
other calculations (excluding those for B. pseudomallei)
were based on MLST data from online databases (http://
www.mlst.net and http://pubmlst.org, accessed May 23,
2009) (Figure 7 and Additional file 5). The recombination
to mutation ratio is indicative of the contribution of
recombination relative to mutation in generating allelic

diversity [39] which can be measured by Nei's diversity
index [42]. The index of association (Ias) measures the
degree of association between loci where low values are
indicative of linkage equilibrium and high levels of LGT
[47]. Higher Ias values do not necessarily indicate clonality
as linkage disequilibrium can be caused by population
structuring of a highly recombinant species [47]. For H.
pylori, recombination gives rise to new MLST alleles only
1.5 times as often as mutation; therefore, the extremely
high diversity can only be the result of high rates of both
mutation and recombination. Given such high rates of
recombination, the high index of association must be
indicative of highly structured populations as has previously been reported [37]. In contrast to H. pylori, recombination in B. pseudomallei is between 18 and 30 times more
likely to generate new alleles than mutation, a result consistent with previous analyses [48]. The low diversity in B.
pseudomallei suggests that neither recombination nor
mutation are very frequent while low index of association

values suggest that this population is almost panmictic
although significant linkage disequilibrium exists (P <
0.05). The overall population cannot be completely panmictic as population genetic analyses show two distinct
populations. Thus panmixia must occur within populations. As might be expected by the greater interconnection
of Southeast Asian STs compared to Australian STs (Figures 4 and 6), the recombination to mutation ratio for the
Southeast Asian population is approximately 1.7 times
higher than in the Australian population.

Conclusion
The approaches described here provide a framework for
phylogenetic analysis of species such as B. pseudomallei
with high levels of LGT and homoplasy. Selecting only
SNPs from whole genome comparisons eliminated faster
evolving loci that are more prone to homoplasy [49], and
sampling >14,000 SNPs spread across the genome
reduced the confounding effects of convergent evolution

values coupled with a non-conflicting phylogenetic pattern of homoplastic SNPs provided confidence in the phylogenetic hypotheses presented here. The inferred
phylogenies are a meaningful approximation of descent,
and not simply a depiction of the inevitable stochastic variation in similarity that would be present in products of
any finite random sampling of an infinitely panmictic
population.
The validity of using phylogenetic trees to depict the evolutionary history of organisms exhibiting LGT has been
hotly debated, with some authors championing web-like
structures to depict instances of reticulate evolution [53]
and others suggesting the importance and appropriateness of discerning patterns of vertical inheritance [54].
Certainly, intra- and interspecific genetic exchange has
shaped the genome of extant Burkholderia isolates. However, although a large proportion of the genome may have
been shaped this way over evolutionary time, only a very

Page 8 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2009, 7:78

small portion of the genome is laterally inherited from
generation to generation. Thus, a phylogenetic tree
remains a valid way of representing the major patterns of
descent for these species. On such a tree, the small connective threads that depict LGT and discordant individual
gene phylogenies can subsequently be strung as individual genes are studied.
It is likely that the most recent common ancestor to B.
pseudomallei existed on the Australian continent. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate a tendency for Australian B.
pseudomallei isolates to be associated with a more ancient
common ancestor compared to other isolates. This pattern also is supported by completely independent MLST
results from 599 B. pseudomallei STs that showed that the
Australasian population is defined by greater allelic diversity and fewer shared alleles. The presence of B. thailandensis isolates in Australia and the phylogenetic position of
Burkholderia sp. MSMB43 point to the possibility that Burkholderia sp. MSMB43, B. thailandensis, B. pseudomallei,
and B. mallei isolates are all descendants from an Australian B. thailandensis-like isolate, although this pattern is
based on very few B. thailandensis and Burkholderia. sp. isolates. As more B. thailandensis isolates are discovered, their
phylogenetic and geographic associations will be critical
for confirming or rejecting this provisional hypothesis.
The monophyletic B. mallei clade diverged from B. pseudomallei before the current Southeast Asian population
was established (Figure 2). The long branch leading to B.
mallei strains suggests a long passage of time before a rapid
radiation led to the extant population. A high consistency
index among SNPs from whole genome comparisons of
B. mallei strains provides evidence for a completely clonal
mode of descent for this species since its relatively recent
radiation, in contrast with B. pseudomallei. The lack of LGT
among B. mallei isolates is not surprising given the loss of
recombination opportunities associated with host sequestration and inability to thrive in the environment; it is
likely that LGT between B. mallei and B. pseudomallei has
not occurred for these same reasons. Although host specialization may account for the differential rates of LGT
between the B. pseudomallei and B. mallei populations,
other barriers may influence LGT among B. pseudomallei
populations.
The mechanistic basis for high recombination frequencies
observed in Southeast Asian populations of B. pseudomallei, compared to Australian populations, is of considerable
interest. As sequences diverge, the likelihood of homologous recombination decreases [55-58]. Therefore, perhaps
the greater genetic distances among Australian B. pseudomallei strains may, in part, explain lower levels of LGT
in this population versus the more closely related and
more connected Southeast Asian population. However, B.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/78

thailandensis shares more alleles with the Southeast Asian
population of B. pseudomallei than with the Australian
population (7:1), providing some evidence that LGT
between species does occur despite genetic divergence.
Different levels of LGT among populations may be due to
greater abundance of B. thailandensis in Southeast Asia,
providing greater opportunities for physical contact and
LGT. In Australia, the typically lower abundance of B.
pseudomallei in the environment [59] may account for
lower rates of LGT in comparison to the Southeast Asian
population [60]. Large, intensively farmed artificial wetlands such as the rice paddy fields of Thailand may favor
high cell densities and mobility of strains. Conversely, the
largely tropical savannah areas of Northern Australia dispersed over vast distances with limited low density grazing and human populations would be expected to impede
gene flow [61]. A third scenario is that these populations
may have evolved differential intrinsic LGT rates, however
we have no evidence to support this hypothesis.
B. pseudomallei is subdivided into two distinct subpopulations with distinct geographic distributions that are separated by Wallace's Line. For hundreds of years naturalists
have noted a tendency for plant and animal populations
to be divided along Wallace's Line [62] but, to our knowledge, no prokaryotic examples have been reported. Two
mutually exclusive hypotheses may explain the biogeographic separation of the Australian B. pseudomallei population from the more recent Asian population along
Wallace's Line, both of which are reliant on the geological
history of the region. Islands on the western side of Wallace's Line are part of the Eurasian tectonic plate, whereas
those on the eastern side are on the Australian plate [63].
Perhaps B. pseudomallei was introduced into Southeast
Asia after the late Miocene (approximately 12 million
years ago (Ma)) collision of these two plates in the vicinity
of Wallace's Line. Conversely, like other species, the biogeographic separation may have begun with the divergence of an ancestral population living in Gondwanaland.
This initial divergence would be related to plate tectonic
motion approximately 140 Ma when the Indian subcontinent split from Gondwanaland. Populations could have
been subsequently introduced into Asia during the collision of the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate that began
approximately 55 Ma [64] and then spread to the western
edge of Wallace's Line. It was previously postulated that B.
pseudomallei may have originated in Gondwanaland and
dispersed with the breakup of that ancient supercontinent
(the Gondwana hypothesis), or alternatively dispersed from
Australia to Southeast Asia via the later Miocene land
bridges that partially linked those regions [23]. However,
low MLST allelic diversity and sharing of prevalent alleles
between strains from Australia and Southeast Asia suggests that B. pseudomallei may actually be a much younger
species [65]. A founding population must therefore have

Page 9 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2009, 7:78

crossed Wallace's Line more recently than the late
Miocene. Such an event would have to be rare to allow for
genetic divergence to occur; indeed, B. pseudomallei does
not survive well in sea water [66,67]. Although all molecular clock estimates are fraught with potential inaccuracies regarding estimates of mutation fixation rates and
generation times, these two dispersion hypotheses differ
by more than an order of magnitude(<12 Ma, and >140
Ma), making it likely that even a rough estimate of divergence times can discriminate between these two hypotheses. Indeed, using a range of mutation rates and
generation times similar to those determined in other bacterial species, our molecular clock estimates support the
hypothesis of a founding population of B. pseudomallei
crossing Wallace's Line and becoming isolated from the
larger population, with subsequent spread throughout
Southeast Asia (Additional file 6). The range of our estimates for the time of divergence between the two populations (16 thousand years ago (Ka) - 225 Ka) coincides
with the times of recent glacial periods when low sea levels would have maximized the potential for dispersion
amongst what are now islands in the Malay Archipelago.
We also dated the last common B. pseudomallei ancestor to
between 24.9 Ka and 346 Ka and the divergence of B. thailandensis and B. pseudomallei to between 307 Ka and 4.27
Ma.
Our results demonstrate that, given large amounts of
molecular data and extensive sampling, past evolutionary
and biogeographic events can be reconstructed despite relatively high levels of LGT. Our use of evolutionarily
informative SNPs derived from WGSs is imperative for
maximizing phylogenetic resolution and reduces the likelihood that individual LGT events will corrupt the overall
phylogeny, as can be expected with limited genomic sampling. Despite the problems with using limited genomic
sampling schemes for determining fine scale phylogenetic
patterns of relatedness in B. pseudomallei, such schemes
are widely accessible and thus result in large data sets. Fortunately, the resolution of MLST data is sufficient for
determining broad patterns of population dynamics and
distribution for B. pseudomallei and adds this species to the
growing list of bacterial species in which biogeographic
structuring has been demonstrated [68,69]. More comprehensive phylogenetic and population studies will set the
stage for framing and addressing further questions about
single gene evolution, dispersal, and population substructuring.

Methods
SNP discovery
SNPs were detected using an in-house pipeline starting
with pairwise genomic comparisons using MUMmer (Stefan Kurtz, Hamburg, Germany) [70]. We ensured orthology by requiring each SNP locus (with 100 bp on either

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/78

side of the SNP) to be present in every sequenced genome
and any locus that was duplicated in any genome was discarded. SNP loci with an additional SNP within 7 bp were
also discarded (but see Additional file 3) to avoid possible
artifacts of slight alignment errors. An average quality
score of â¥15 was required for the 10 bases on each side of
a SNP.
Phylogenetic analyses
The evolutionary model that best fit the SNP data derived
from whole genome comparisons was determined by
Modeltest 3.6 (David Posada, Vigo, Spain) [71], analyzed
under the Akaike's Information Criterion. The best fit
model was used in Mr. Bayes 3.1 (John Huelsnebeck, Bret
Larget, Paul van der Mark, Fredrik Ronquist, Donald
Simon. Tallahassee, Florida, USA) [72] for phylogenetic
inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was
run for 2,000,000 generations and sampled every 100
generations. A burn-in set of 2,000 trees was discarded.
For all data sets, we ran the default of four chains, the log
likelihood converged on a stable value well before 2,000
trees. The program SplitsTree4 (Daniel Huson and David
Bryant. TÃ¼bingen, Germany) [73] was used to compute a
Neighbor-Net network using uncorrected distances and
equal angle splits.
Analysis of residual homoplasies
Combining loci with different evolutionary histories, due
to LGT, can result in a tree that reflects neither the history
of individual genes, nor the history of the group of organisms. To determine whether LGT changed the core phylogenetic relationships among isolates, we created trees
using only homoplastic SNPs. Each homoplastic SNP
allele will have been inherited in a vertical manner (from
mother cell to daughter cell) for the vast majority of its
history, and only transferred laterally a few times. As such,
the phylogenetic information content for homoplastic
loci reflects both the evolutionary history of vertical
descent as well as the history of LGT or convergent mutations. If LGT events involve small genomic regions and
occur among a variety of lineages, the portion of phylogenetic information content due to LGT will be incongruent
across genomic regions, whereas the portion that reflects
the patterns of vertical descent will remain congruent. The
incongruent information due to LGT will be diluted by
conflicting LGT patterns from other loci, allowing the portion of phylogenetic information due to vertical descent
to dictate tree structure. Thus, we identified 8,213 nonhomoplastic SNPs as those loci whose allelic differences
could be explained by a single change, given the phylogeny of Figure 2b. These non-homoplastic loci (Additional
file 4a) were excluded from a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of only the 6,331 remaining homoplastic SNPs as performed for Figure 2b (Additional file 4b). The differences

Page 10 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2009, 7:78

between the tree using all 14,544 SNPs and the 6,331
homoplastic SNPs are highlighted (Additional file 4c).
Population structure analyses
The program Structure 2.2 [40] was used to analyze 601
STs across seven loci assuming one to five populations for
10 iterations each. A burn-in of 1,000 replications was discarded and 5,000 additional replications were analyzed.
The burn-in period was sufficient for stabilization of log
likelihood values. The plot shown (Figure 3) for each
value of K is based on the run with the highest likelihood
value. Likewise, FST values for K = 2 were calculated from
the Structure 2.2 run with the highest likelihood value
and show the divergence of each population from an estimate of ancestral allele frequencies. The level of divergence between populations (Î¦PT) was computed with 999
permutations using GenAlEx (Rod Peakall and Peter
Smouse. Canberra, Australia) [74]. For this test, STs were
assigned to either an Australian or Southeast Asian population based on the geographic region designated on the
MLST database.
Calculation of other population metrics
The program START2 (Keith Jolley. Oxford, UK) [75] was
used to calculate the standardized index of association
[38] using only STs. Nei's [42] diversity index (D = 1â
(allele frequency)2) for each MLST locus was calculated
and averaged across all seven loci for each species or population. To calculate the relative contribution of recombination and mutation on allelic variation, we used the
methods described elsewhere [39] except we used the program eBURST [35] to identify the most likely ancestral ST
for each clonal complex. For the purposes of these calculations, the B. pseudomallei STs were divided into Australasian and Southeast Asian populations based on 95%
assignment by the program Structure (see 'population
structure analyses' above) into respective populations.
The two STs assigned to B. mallei were excluded from these
groups. The Neisseria MLST database contained both N.
gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis and were separated based
on species labelling within the database. The Campylobacter database also contained both C. jejuni and C. coli
STs, some of which were incorrectly labelled (EPP unpublished data). We therefore identified errors based on phylogenetic grouping and eliminated STs with ambiguous
assignments. The recombination to mutation ratios for C.
jejuni that we report here are similar to previously published values [76].
Molecular clock calculations
Molecular clock estimates were performed by a set of inhouse Perl and Java scripts. First, all protein-coding gene
sequences (excluding pseudogenes) from both chromosomes of B. pseudomallei strain K96243 were downloaded
as gene references. A BLAST-like Alignment Tool (BLAT)
database [77] was constructed for all B. pseudomallei, B.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/78

mallei, and B. thailandensis genomes used in the comparisons and then BLAT was performed for each K96243 gene
against the combined Burkholderia database. The BLAT
output was used to align the gene sequences for all taxa
relative to the coding direction in each K96243 gene.
Numbers of observed synonymous (sSNPs) and potential
synonymous SNP sites (sSites) were calculated for each
taxon pair. Ages of divergence were calculated for each
taxon pair using the following formula: Age = sSNPs/(MR
Ã sSites Ã generations Ã 2). Divergence times at a given
bifurcation were calculated by averaging the times calculated for every taxon pair that shared that bifurcation
point. As mutation rates (MR) and generations per year
are unknown for B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, and B. thailandensis, we used a range of MR [78,79] and generations per
year [80] to calculate the divergence point of the Australian and Asian populations of B. pseudomallei.

neither the SNP mutation rate nor the number of generations per year are
known, we assumed a range of mutation rates from 1.4 Ã 10-10 in E. coli
[78] to 5.2 Ã 10-10 in Bacillus anthracis [79] and a range of 100 - 300
generations per year as in E. coli [80] to predict that the divergence of
these two populations occurred between 16 Ka and 225 Ka (grey box).
While actual values for B. pseudomallei may lie outside this range, they
would have to differ greatly to support the hypothesis that the two populations diverged before the Australian and Eurasian plates collided. Using
these same parameter values, we dated the last common B. pseudomallei
ancestor to between 24.9 Ka and 346 Ka (not shown). We also dated the
divergence of B. thailandensis and B. pseudomallei to between 307 Ka
and 4.27 Ma.
