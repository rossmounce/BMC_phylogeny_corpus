Computational analysis of LexA regulons in
Cyanobacteria
Shan Li, Minli Xu, Zhengchang Su*

Abstract
Background: The transcription factor LexA plays an important role in the SOS response in Escherichia coli and
many other bacterial species studied. Although the lexA gene is encoded in almost every bacterial group with a
wide range of evolutionary distances, its precise functions in each group/species are largely unknown. More
recently, it has been shown that lexA genes in two cyanobacterial genomes Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 and Synechocystis
sp. PCC 6803 might have distinct functions other than the regulation of the SOS response. To gain a general
understanding of the functions of LexA and its evolution in cyanobacteria, we conducted the current study.
Results: Our analysis indicates that six of 33 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes do not harbor a lexA gene
although they all encode the key SOS response genes, suggesting that LexA is not an indispensable transcription
factor in these cyanobacteria, and that their SOS responses might be regulated by different mechanisms. Our
phylogenetic analysis suggests that lexA was lost during the course of evolution in these six cyanobacterial
genomes. For the 26 cyanobacterial genomes that encode a lexA gene, we have predicted their LexA-binding sites
and regulons using an efficient binding site/regulon prediction algorithm that we developed previously. Our results
show that LexA in most of these 26 genomes might still function as the transcriptional regulator of the SOS
response genes as seen in E. coli and other organisms. Interestingly, putative LexA-binding sites were also found in
some genomes for some key genes involved in a variety of other biological processes including photosynthesis,
drug resistance, etc., suggesting that there is crosstalk between the SOS response and these biological processes.
In particular, LexA in both Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421 has largely diverged from
those in other cyanobacteria in the sequence level. It is likely that LexA is no longer a regulator of the SOS
response in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.
Conclusions: In most cyanobacterial genomes that we analyzed, LexA appears to function as the transcriptional
regulator of the key SOS response genes. There are possible couplings between the SOS response and other
biological processes. In some cyanobacteria, LexA has adapted distinct functions, and might no longer be a
regulator of the SOS response system. In some other cyanobacteria, lexA appears to have been lost during the
course of evolution. The loss of lexA in these genomes might lead to the degradation of its binding sites.

Background
The LexA protein was first characterized as the transcriptional regulator of the SOS response in Escherichia
coli [1,2], and later in several other bacteria, including
Bacillus subtilis [3,4] and Fibrobacter succinogenes [5].
In fact, the lexA gene is found in almost all eubacterial
groups examined so far [5,6]. In E. coli, around 30 genes
involved in the SOS response are under the regulation

of LexA [2]. Under normal growth conditions, LexA
represses the SOS response genes by binding to their
promoter regions, and thus blocking their transcription.
When DNA is damaged, the binding of RecA to the
released single-stranded DNA induces the auto-cleavage
of the Ala84-Gly85 peptide bond [7,8] in LexA, thereby
inhibiting the dimerization of LexA and preventing its
binding to DNA [9-11]. In this manner, SOS response
genes are de-repressed and expressed at different time
points and different levels in a coordinated way [10].
LexA in E. coli consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding
domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain [8,12].

The N-terminal contains three a-helices (I, II, III) and an
anti-parallel b-sheet [12]. Helices II and III form a helixturn-helix DNA-binding motif, and all the DNA-contacting residues Ser 39 , Asn 41 , Ala 42 , Glu 44 and Glu 45 are
located in helix III [13] as revealed by both NMR [12]
and X-Ray crystallography analyses [8]. The LexA-binding sites in E. coli were found to be a 16-bp palindromic
motif with the consensus sequence CTG(TA)5CAG [14].
It has been shown that two reactive residues Ser119 and
Lys156 in E. coli LexA are critical for the auto-hydrolysis
of the peptide bond Ala84-Gly85 [1,9]. The core set of the
SOS response system consists of lexA, recA, uvrABCD,
umuCD and ruvB [10]. Upon the auto-hydrolysis of
LexA, the uvrABCD operon is expressed first, whose products are responsible for the nucleotide excision repair
(NER). Then recA and several other genes for homologous recombination are expressed, retrieving the excised
DNA double strands. Next, the cell division inhibitor
SfiA is induced to guarantee a sufficient time for the
DNA repairing to be completed. In the end, if the DNA
is not completely repaired, the operon umuCD encoding
the mutagenic DNA repair polymerase Pol V will be
induced to perform translesion DNA synthesis [9,14].
Since the lexA gene itself is also under the control of
LexA, after the damaged DNA is repaired, the activity of
RecA declines, the production of LexA surpasses its
auto-cleavage. Consequently, the increased concentration
of LexA restores the inhibition of the expression of the
SOS response genes.
More recently, LexA homologs were also experimentally studied in a few cyanobacteria [15-21]. These studies suggest that LexA in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 [16]
binds to the promoter regions of lexA and recA; however, LexA in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 may regulate
different genes/systems other than the SOS system.
Domain et al. concluded from microarray gene profiling
analysis [21] that LexA in this species might be involved
in carbon metabolism. Later, LexA in Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803 was found to regulate the crhR gene encoding
a RNA helicase [19]. Moreover, it has been shown that
the transcription of the bidirectional hydrogenase genes
hoxEFUYH was regulated by LexA in Synechocystis sp.
PCC6803 [17]. In Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, hoxEFUYH
genes are split into two separate operons, and LexA was
found to bind to the upstream regions for both operons
[15]. Mazon et al. [16] showed that the LexA-binding
sites in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 have a 14-bp pseudo-palindromic structure in the form of RGTACNNNDGTWCB,
which are similar to those in B. subtilis. Additionally,
Sjöholm et al. [15] found two putative palindromic
LexA-binding sites: one in the promoter region of
alr0750-hoxE-hoxF that resembles Mazon’s LexA boxes
[16], and another, TTACACTTTAA in the upstream
region of hoxU in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120. Meanwhile,

Page 2 of 17

multiple putative LexA boxes were identified in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803: a 13-bp pseudo-palindromic segment AGTAACTAGTTCG in the upstream region of
hoxE, which is similar to Mazon’s site but with one base
deletion [17]; another direct repeat pattern, CTA-N9CTA proposed to be recognized by LexA in vitro [20];
and two putative LexA boxes that resemble none of the
putative LexA boxes listed above [18]. Despite this progress, a more extensive study of LexA proteins and their
binding sites and regulons in cyanobacterial genomes is
still needed. In this study, we have predicted LexA-binding
sites and regulons in all the sequenced cyanobacterial genomes that harbor a lexA gene, and analyzed the evolutionary changes in the LexA regulons in cyanobacteria, as well
as their relationship with those in proteobacteria and
gram-positive bacteria.

Results and Discussion
Conservation of the DNA-binding domain of LexA in
cyanobacteria

We identified orthologs of the LexA protein in Nostoc
sp. PCC7120 (alr4908) in 26 of the 33 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes using the bi-directional best hit
(BDBH) method based on BLASTP search with an
E-value cutoff 10 -10 (see Methods). Seven genomes
appear not to harbor a lexA gene under this criterion,
namely, Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421, Synechococcus
sp. JA-3-3Ab A-Prime, Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B’a(213) B-Prime, Synechococcus elongatus PCC6301, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 and Thermosynechococcus elongatus
BP-1. We removed the Synechococcus elongatus
PCC7942 genome from our study since Synechococcus
elongatus PCC6301 is virtually identical to it [22]. However, an ortholog of the lexA gene (Gll0709) does exist
in Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421. The reason we failed
to identify this ortholog is that it does not meet our
BDBH criterion due to its largely divergent sequence.
The phylogenetic tree of these 27 LexA amino acid
sequences indicates that they can be clustered into three
groups (Figure 1A), corresponding to the previously
described Clade A (containing Gloeobacter violaceus
PCC7421), Clade C (containing small marine Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus), and Clade B (containing
most remaining cyanobacteria) [23,24]. However, aside
from Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421, the DNA-binding
domains (DBD) of LexA from these cyanobacteria are
highly conserved (Figure 1B), especially the helix III,
where DNA-contacting residues are located [13]. This
result is in agreement with earlier observations [16,21].
This provides the rationale of our analysis, including the
phylogenetic footprinting analysis (next section) and genome-wide scanning for LexA-binding site predictions. On
the other hand, since the DBD in Gloeobacter violaceus

and are labelled by vertical arrows.

PCC7421 is quite different from those in other cyanobacteria, especially where the DNA-contacting residues locate,
thus, we excluded it from our study, leaving 31 species/
strains for the putative LexA regulon prediction.
LexA-binding sites predicted by phylogenetic footprinting

We considered both an operon and a singleton gene as
a transcription unit (TU). As Mazon et al. [16] have

Page 3 of 17

demonstrated the binding of LexA to the upstream
regions of two genes, lexA and recA, and predicted
LexA-binding sites for other four genes (uvrA, ssb,
alr4905, and all4790) in Nostoc sp PCC7120, we used
phylogenetic footprinting to identify possible LexAbinding sites in the pooled 118 inter-TU sequences
associated with these six genes in Nostoc sp. PCC7120
[16] and their orthologs in the other 25 cyanobacterial
genomes (excluding Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421)
that harbor a lexA gene (see Methods). We identified
49 high-scoring 14-bp palindromic sequences (Table 1)
out of the 118 input sequences by applying the motif
finding tools MEME [25] and BioProspector [26] and
incorporating the best motifs found by these two programs (See Methods and Additional file 1). However,
the putative LexA box AGTCCTAGAGTCCT (Additional file 1) identified in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803
was not identified by Patterson-Fortin et al. [20] using
DNaseI footprinting assays or by Gutekunst et al.
[17]. Therefore, we removed this site, leaving 48 putative LexA-binding sites (Table 1) for profile construction. The two LexA boxes that have been characterized
in Nostoc sp PCC 7120 [16] were accurately recovered
by the phylogenetic footprinting procedure (Table 1),
suggesting that most of these high-scoring motifs are
likely to be genuine LexA boxes. These putative
LexA-binding sites show either a strong palindromic
structure similar to the experimentally characterized
LexA boxes in Nostoc sp. PCC7120 [16], or a tandem
repeat structure with the consensus sequence
AGTACWNWTGTACT. As demonstrated in Figure
S1 in Additional file 2, this pattern is rather similar to
the consensus sequence of the LexA-binding sites previously identified in B. subitlis (CGAACN 4 GTTCG)
[3], and to a less extent, to that of LexA-binding sites
found in a-proteobacteria (GTTCN 7 GTTC and
GAACN7GAAC) [27], but differs remarkably from that
in E. coli CTG(TA)5 CAG [14]. These results are consistent with our phylogenetic analysis of the 183 LexA
proteins detected in 598 genomes, showing that LexA
proteins in cyanobacteria are more closely related to
those in gram-positive and a-proteobacteria bacteria
than to those in g-proteobacteria (Figure S2 in Additional file 3). Accordingly, since the LexA-binding sites
in B. subtilis [3,16] have a palindromic structure, it is
not surprising that the LexA-binding sites in cyanobacterial genomes might have a similar palindromic
structure.
Genome-wide prediction of LexA-binding sites and
regulons in cyanobacterial genomes

Both consensus sequence and position weight matrix
(PWM) have been widely used to represent the pattern of
similar sequences. The advantage of PWM (or profile)

methods over the consensus sequence methods is that the
former can capture more quantitative information about
the patterns by using a probabilistic model to represent
the sequences. In this way, it can differentiate subtly conserved positions from the non-conserved ones [28]. In our
study, We used the profile of these 48 LexA boxes (Table
1) to scan the 31 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes to
predict additional putative LexA-binding sites and members of LexA regulons, using a scanning algorithm [29-31]
that incorporates orthologous information and computes a
log-odds ratio (LOR) score for evaluating the confidence of
predictions in each genome (see Methods for details). The
predicted results with a p-value < 0.01 for the 26 genomes
harboring a lexA gene are listed in Table S1-26 (Additional
file 4), while those for the five genomes without a lexA
gene are listed in Table S27-31 (Additional file 5). The
predicted results with a p-value < 0.05 for the 31 cyanobacteria are summarized in Table S32-62 (Additional file
6).
The score of a detected putative LexA binding site for
a TU is the sum of two terms: one evaluates the extent
to which the putative LexA binding site resembles the
scanning profile; the other evaluates the similarity of
this binding site to those identified for the orthologs of
genes within the TU in the other genomes. To evaluate
the confidence of each motif score s, we used randomly
selected coding sequences as the null model to test the
statistical significance. A false positive rate was used to
evaluate this statistical significance, which was defined
as the fraction of the randomly selected coding
sequences containing binding sites with a score higher
than the cutoff s in the genome. We chose randomly
selected coding regions as the null model based on the
assumption that a coding sequence is less likely to contain cis-regulatory binding sites than an intergenic
sequence. Although it might be possible for genuine
LexA boxes to occur in coding regions [15,20], such
kind of binding sites should be rare. The LOR function
for a genome evaluates the ratio of the fraction of the
inter-TU sequences containing a binding site with a
score higher than s to the fraction of the randomly
selected coding sequences containing a binding site with
a score higher than the same s in the genome. Accordingly, positive LOR values that increase monotonically
with the increase in binding site sores would suggest
that an inter-TU sequence is more likely to contain a
high-scoring LexA-binding site than does a randomly
selected coding sequence in the genome.
As shown in Figure 2, when the motif score s
increases beyond some value, the LOR is generally high
for most of the 26 cyanobacteria that harbor a lexA
gene, therefore those genomes with high LOR values are
likely to contain some true binding sites. Exceptions
exist in five genomes, namely, Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801,

Page 5 of 17

Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Synechococcus RCC307,
Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, and Microcystis aeruginosa
NIES-843, in which the LOR curves oscillate around
zero when binding site score s increases. These poor
LOR values might suggest that there are not more highscoring LexA-binding sites in the inter-TU regions than
in the coding regions in the five genomes. The reason
for this could be that our scanning algorithm rewards a
binding site that is shared by orthologs in the other genomes. If a true binding site is unique to a genome, then
it will not score high. In this sense, LexA is probably no
longer a major SOS response regulator in these genomes. Instead, it might have become a specific local regulator during the course of evolution to adapt to their
unique living environments (we will return to this subject later). In the case of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, it is
noted that the LexA-binding sites identified by Patterson-Fortin et al. [20] are totally different from those
identified by Mazon et al. [16], and that the LexA
sequence in this genome is largely divergent from those
in the other genomes (Figure 1A). Accordingly, the
LexA binding sites in this genome might differ in some
way from those in the other genomes, which can be
another reason for its low LOR values.
In contrast, as shown in Figure S3 in Additional file
2, the LOR values in the five genomes that do not harbor a lexA gene (Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab A-Prime,
Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B’a (2-13) B-Prime, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, Thermosynechococcus elongates BP-1 and Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101)
oscillate around or decrease below zero when the motif
score s increases beyond a certain value, implying that
the chance to find a relative high-scoring putative
LexA-binding site in an inter-TU region is not higher
than in a randomly chosen coding sequence, suggesting
that these genomes are unlikely to contain functional
LexA-binding sites. On the other hand, the LOR values
in the three genomes Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab APrime, Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B’a (2-13) B-Prime and
Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 are relatively
higher than those in the other two genomes (Additional
file 2, Figure S3), or even could be comparable to those
of the five poor-LOR-valued cyanobacteria that harbor
a lexA gene (Figure 2). In fact, the numbers of predicted binding sites in the three genomes are not too
small (Table S27, S28, S31 in Additional file 5), which
suggests that a few putative LexA-like binding sites
exist in these genomes. A possible explanation for this
phenomenon could be that these LexA-like binding
sites are recognized by other transcription factors that
have similar DNA-binding domains to that of LexA.
The predictions of LexA regulons in the 26 cyanobacterial genomes that harbor a lexA gene are summarized
in Table 2.

Conservation and diversity of the putative LexA regulons
in cyanobacteria

To investigate how well the predicted LexA regulons in
the 26 cyanobacterial genomes are conserved, we constructed a LexA regulon conservation tree based on the
pairwise comparison of the predicted LexA regulons in
these genomes (see Methods). As shown in Figure 3,
these genomes are divided into two groups. Interestingly, one group is exclusively comprised of marine
strains, and the other group contains the remaining genomes isolated from different non-marine habitats. In the
former group, high light (HL) adapted and low light
(LL) adapted ecotypes are largely grouped into two subgroups. The results suggest that the composition of
LexA regulons is dependent on the habitat of the organisms to a large extent. The general topology of the tree
(Figure 3) is basically consistent with both the 16S
rRNA gene tree (Figure 4) and the LexA protein tree of
these genomes (Figure 1A). Furthermore, both the HL
and LL adapted marine sub-groups are very compact,
indicating that the predicted LexA regulons in both subgroups are relatively conserved. In contrast, the species

in the non-marine habitats are not so close to one
another (Figure 3), suggesting that the putative LexA
regulons in these genomes share few genes with one
another except for the closely related Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 and Nostoc sp. PCC7120. The tree also
indicates that Microcystis aeruginosa NIES 843 and
Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 have the most distinct LexA
regulons from other cyanobacterial genomes (Figure 3).
Functional classification of putative LexA regulons in
cyanobacteria

Predicted members of LexA regulons in the 26 cyanobacteria that harbor a lexA gene are listed in Tables S1-S26
in Additional file 4, their functions can be summarized as
follows.
1. SOS response system

As shown in Table S63 in Additional file 6, all the 33
cyanobacterial genomes included in this study encode a
few SOS response genes found in E. coli. Several of the
SOS genes in some of the 26 genomes that harbor a
lexA gene bear a high-scoring putative LexA-binding
site in their regulatory regions (Table S1-26 in

Figure 3 Conservation relationships among the predicted LexA regulons in the 26 cyanobacterial genomes. The tree is based on the
pairwise conservation of the predicted LexA regulons in the 26 cyanobacterial genomes (see Methods).

Additional file 4). In particular, two of the core SOS
response genes [5,6], namely, recA and lexA, are among
the most conserved putative LexA targets in the 26 cyanobacterial species/strains (Table S64 in Additional file
6). In addition, the umuC and umuD genes encoded in
13 genomes are also predicted to bear a putative LexAbinding site in their promoter regions (Table S64 in
Additional file 6, Table 3 and Additional file 4). These
results suggest that as in E. coli, the SOS response in
most cyanobacteria might still be regulated by LexA.
However, the other SOS response genes were found to
bear a putative LexA-binding site only in a few genomes
(Table 3). For instance, a high-scoring LexA-binding site
for the ruvB gene encoding Holliday junction DNA helicase B was found only in HL adapted Prochlorococcus
ecotypes MIT9312, MIT9515, MIT9215, MED4 and

AS9601. Moreover, in the case of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes uvrA, B, C and D, which are
under the regulation of LexA in E. coli [10], we were
able to identify putative LexA-binding sites only in the
promoter regions of the uvrA and uvrB in Nostoc sp.
PCC7120 and the promoter region of uvrD in Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9312 (Tables 3). Thus, it is likely
that the NER process in the remaining genomes is regulated by some transcription factor other than LexA,
given that uvr genes are present in all the 32 cyanobacterial genomes analyzed in this study, including those
that do not encode a lexA gene (Table S63 in Additional
file 6). These results are consistent with the earlier
observation that LexA target genes in bacteria are highly
diversified in order for them to adapt to different ecological niches [5,6].

Figure 4 Phylogenetic relationships of 32 cyanobacterial genomes based on the 16S rRNA genes. The tree is rooted with the 16S rRNA
gene of E. coli K12. Bootstrap values are shown on the nodes. Cyanobacterial genomes that do not encode a lexA gene are shown in red.

On the other hand, in Synechococcus PCC7002, Synechococcus RCC307 and Synechococcus WH7803, LexA
boxes were only detected for one of the core SOS
response genes, i.e., SYNPCC7002_A0426 (recA) in Synechococcus PCC7002, SynRCC307_1756 (lexA) in Synechococcus RCC307 and SynWH7803_0439 (recA) in
Synechococcus WH7803, although these genomes all
encode a lexA gene and other core SOS response genes,
such as recA (SYNPCC7002_A0426, SynRCC307_2111
and SynWH7803_0439,) and ruvB (SYNPCC7002_A1390,
SynRCC307_1756 and SynWH7803_0185), umuC
(SynRCC307_0043 and SynWH7803_1080,) and umuD
(SynRCC307_0042 and SynWH7803_1081). Since only
one single SOS response gene bears a putative LexA box
in these genomes, it is likely that the role of LexA in the
regulation of the SOS response in these genomes might
have been attenuated. The case of Synechocystis sp.

PCC6803 seems to go even further in this direction as
detailed below.
As indicated previously [16,18], the LexA protein of
Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is unusual in two aspects
compared to those in the other genomes analyzed in this
study. First, as shown in Figure S4 in Additional file 2,
the Ala-Gly dyad in the N-terminus of LexA responsible
for auto-cleavage of the protein in all other cyanobacteria
as well as in E. coli and B. subtilis [16] are replaced by
Gly-Gly in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Second, the reactive residue Ser (Ser119 of LexA in E. coli) that attacks the
Ala-Gly peptide bond is replaced by Asp of LexA in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 [16,18]. It has been shown that
SOS induction cannot be initiated by a non-cleavable
LexA repressor [10,16]. Therefore, it is highly likely that
LexA in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 cannot undergo the
auto-cleavage reaction in response to DNA damage, and

it might have adopted a different function other than
the canonical SOS response regulator seen in E. coli
and B. subtilis [32]. This argument is consistent with
the observation that Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 has a
notably larger branch length in the 27 LexA protein tree
(Figure 1A), but this is not seen in the 16S rRNA gene
tree (Figure 4).
Although the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome harbors some core SOS response genes including lexA and
recA (Table S63 in Additional file 6), none of them
belongs to our predicted LexA regulon at a p-value <
0.01 (Table S26 in Additional file 4 and Table 3). The
mutS (sll1772) gene is the only gene that is likely to be
in involved in DNA mismatch repair, while bearing a
putative LexA binding site in the genome. However, the
orthologs of mutS is not under the regulation of LexA
in E. coli [2,33] or within the putative LexA regulon of
any other cyanobacteria (Table S1-26 in Additional file
4). These results suggest that at least most of SOS
response genes are not under the regulation of LexA in

2111 0959
ndhH
psbB

0467

Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Indeed, using microarray
gene expression profiling in response to lexA depletion,
Domain et al. [21] concluded that LexA in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 might be involved in carbon metabolism or controlled by carbon availability rather than the
regulation of SOS response. However, our predicted
LexA regulon in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Table S26
in Additional file 4) has no intersection with the LexAresponsive genes identified by Domain et al. [21]. Since
the LexA-binding sites that were experimentally characterized [17,20] in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 are different from the sequences in our scanning profile, and
considering the distinct nature of the LexA protein in
Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 indicated above, it would be
particular interesting to determine by experiment the
function of the predicted sites in this genome.
Thus, although Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 clearly harbors the components of a basic SOS response system
(Table S63 in Additional file 6), it is probably no longer
under the regulation of LexA. Accordingly, LexA in this

Li et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:527
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/527

genome might have adopted a different function. Thus,
the loss of the original function of LexA in Synechocystis
sp. PCC6803 is coupled with the loss of the sequence
constraint, thereby accelerating its divergence from
other cyanobacterial LexA proteins, at both the
sequence and functional levels. On the other hand,
given the importance of the SOS response in cell survival, it is highly likely that the transcriptional regulator of
the SOS response system in Synechocystissp. PCC6803
has been replaced by another protein.
2. Other cellular processes

Interestingly, we also found putative LexA-binding sites
in the regulatory regions of genes that participate in various cellular processes in these 26 cyanobacterial genomes (Table 3). The major cellular processes that are
likely under the regulation of LexA are summarized
below.
2.1 Photosynthesis Putative LexA-binding sites were
predicted for the following photosynthetic genes in the
26 cyanobacteria that harbor a lexA gene with p < 0.01
(Table 3, Table S1-26 in Additional file 4): Ava_3553,
A9601_12231, PMM1117, P9215_12531, P9301_12241,
PMT9312_1128, and P9515_12081, coding for a photosystem II reaction center protein PsbY; slr0906, coding
for the photosystem II CP47 protein; and MAE_44810,
PMT9312_1615, PMN2A_1682a and SYNPCC7002_
A1008, coding for a protein involved in photosystem I.
These results suggest that the SOS response system
might have cross-talk with photosynthesis in those
genomes.
2.2. Transporters Around 20 genes encoding transporters
were predicted to bear a putative LexA box (Table 3).
Most of them belong to the ABC transporter proteins,
including AM1_4624 in Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017,
Ava_4995 in Anabaena variabilis ATCC29413, MAE_
18340 in Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843, Npun_F3763 in
Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102, alr5147 in Nostoc sp
PCC7120, P9215_08441 in Prochlorococcus marinus
MIT9215, P9303_15661 in Prochlorococcus marinus
MIT9303, P9515_06251 in Prochlorococcus marinus
MIT9515, SYNW2111 in Synechococcus sp WH8102 and
slr0467 in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. In addition, several
toxin and antibiotics exporters were identified to have a
putative LexA-binding site in their regulatory regions,
including cadmium resistance transporter Ava_4997 in
Anabaena variabilis ATCC29413; MFS (major facilitator
superfamily) multidrug efflux transporter P9301_11521 in
Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9301 and A9601_11511 in
Prochlorococcus marinus AS9601; multidrug efflux ABC
transporter P9515_06251 in Prochlorococcus marinus
MIT9515 and SYNW0959 in Synechococcus sp WH8102;

putative ABC transporter/multidrug efflux family protein
SYNW2111 in Synechococcus sp WH8102; drug exporter-1
ABC transporter ATPase subunit AM1_4624 in Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017. These findings are interesting
since it has been shown that the SOS response system is
related to drug resistance in E. coli [34,35] and Staphylococcus aureus [35-37] by mechanisms that are not fully
understood. It was reported that the vP2449 gene encoding
a toxin exporter responsible for xenobiotic resistance in
Vibrionales parahaemolyticus was under the direct control
of LexA [38]. Therefore, it is likely that these drug resistance genes are regulated by LexA, thereby coupling the
SOS response to drug resistance in these cyanobacteria.
The origin of the lexA gene in cyanobacteria

As indicated earlier, 27 of the 32 cyanobacterial genomes analyzed evidently harbor a lexA ortholog, while
the remaining five genomes do not, even when being
scrutinized by more sensitive sequence search methods
such as PSI-BLAST (data not shown). The five cyanobacteria lacking a LexA are Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab
A-Prime, Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B’a(2-13) B-Prime,
Synechococcus elongatus PCC6301, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 and Thermosynechococcus elongatus
BP-1. However, the core SOS response genes remain in
these five genomes (Table S63 in Additional file 6). In
the tree of 183 detected LexA proteins in 598 sequenced
genomes (Figure S2 in Additional file 3), the 26 cyanobacterial LexA proteins that are detected by BDBH (see
Methods) form a monophyletic group while LexA in
Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421 is clustered with the
group of a-proteobacteria. Furthermore, the topology of
the 16S rRNA gene tree (Figure 4) and the LexA tree/
subtree of 27 cyanobacterial genomes (Figure 1A and
Figure S2 in Additional file 3) are quite similar. This
result suggests that lexA in the 26 cyanobacterial genomes (excluding Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421) is
likely to be vertically inherited from the last common
ancestor of cyanobacteria. However, Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421 might have lost its LexA protein during
evolution and obtained an ortholog later through horizontal transfer from an a-proteobacterium. The five genomes that lack a lexA gene do not form a monophyletic
group in the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic tree of
these 32 cyanobacteria (Figure 4). In particular, Synechococcus elongatus PCC6301, and Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 are spread in a clade whose members
except these two genomes harbor a lexA gene. The most
parsimonious explanation of this distribution would be
that these two genomes Synechococcus elongatus
PCC6301 and Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 lost

Li et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:527
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/527

their lexA genes through two independent events (one for
each genome) to adapt to their corresponding environments during the course of evolution. Furthermore, the
remaining three genomes, Thermosynechococcus
elongatus BP-1, Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab A-prime and
Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B’a (2-13) B-prime, which do not
possess a lexA gene, branch earlier from the others (Figure 4). A plausible explanation of this distribution would
be that these genomes lost their lexA genes inherited
from the last common ancestor of cyanobacteria during
the course of evolution. Interestingly, all these three genomes are thermophilic, their extreme ecological niches
might facilitate the loss of the lexA gene. Since the core
SOS response genes remain in these five genomes (Table
S63 in Additional file 6) after lexA was lost, they might
have been hijacked by another transcription factor given
the importance of the regulation of the SOS response
genes for cell survival. The genomes that lost their lexA
gene appear to have lost LexA-binding sites (Figure S3 in
Additional file 2). Alternatively, these five cyanobacteria
might still harbor a lexA gene that has largely diverged
from the others’ during evolution to such a level that our
method could not detect them.
In addition, it has been suggested that the lexA gene
was derived from gram-positive bacteria, which
then spread into cyanobacteria and fibrobacteres. Then
a-proteobacteria acquired lexA from cyanobacteria
[5,6,16]. Our phylogenetic analysis of the LexA proteins
and their binding sites supports such an argument. As
mentioned before, cyanobacterial LexA proteins are
more closely-related to those in gram-positive bacteria
and a-proteobacteria than those in the other groups
(Figure S2 in Additional file 3), and the predicted LexAbinding sites in cyanobacteria are clustered together
with those in the gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis
and in a-proteobacteria, but are far away from those in
E. coli (Figure S1 in Additional file 2).
Moreover, Erill et al. [27] have suggested that there is
a common set of genes in the LexA regulon of proteobacteria and gram-positive bacteria: recA, uvrA, ssb, and
ruvC. However, our predicted LexA regulons in cyanobacteria do not always include this set of genes. Thus,
the concept of a common set of SOS response gene in
its more general form warrants further scrutinization.

Conclusions
In this study we have predicted LexA-binding sites and
analyzed the putative LexA regulons in 26 cyanobacterial
genomes that harbor a lexA gene using a highly efficient
motif scanning and regulon prediction algorithm. In
most lexA-containing cyanobacterial genomes, some SOS

Page 12 of 17

response genes bear a putative LexA box. Some genes
involved in various cellular processes such as photosynthesis, drug resistance, etc. are also predicted to bear a
putative LexA box in their promoter regions. However,
in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, LexA might have adopted
a new function and no longer be in charge of the SOS
response genes. In some genomes, lexA was likely lost
during the course of evolution accompanied by the loss
of its binding sites. The SOS response genes in these genomes that appear to lack a lexA gene might be regulated
by another or multiple transcription factors. Moreover,
we conclude that cyanobacteria inherited the lexA gene
from their last common ancestor; however, substantial
genome-wide turnover seems to have led to the high
degree of variation of the LexA regulons in some species
during evolution.

genomes using the operon prediction algorithm developed by Dam et al. [39]. The algorithm is based on the
integration of both genome-specific and comparative
genomic information. In this work, both the multi-gene
operon and singleton operon (containing one gene) are
considered as a transcription unit (TU), and the
upstream intergenic sequence of the first open reading
frame is not considered as a part of the operon.
Prediction of orthologs

We used the bi-directional best hit (BDBH) method
based on BLASTP searches with an E-value cut-off of
10-10 for both directions to predict orthologous protein
pairs between any two proteomes. The BDBH method
assumes that a cross-species protein pair are orthologous if each protein returns the other as the best hit in
the whole proteome comparison [40].
Phylogenetic analysis

To construct the phylogenetic tree of LexA in cyanobacteria, multiple sequence alignment of the LexA amino acid
sequences from 27 cyanobacterial genomes and the E. coli
K12 genome were made using ClustalW implemented in
MEGA [41] with default settings. The phylogenetic tree
was then constructed using the neighbor-joining method
with Poisson correction model in MEGA. E. coli LexA was
placed as the outgroup of the tree. To construct the species tree, the DNA sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA
genes from the 32 cyanobacteria and E. coli were aligned
using ClustalW with manual adjustment by removing the
unalignable regions. A neighbor-joining tree was then constructed with E. coli K12 being the outgroup using the
Kimura 2-parameter model. Statistical significance at each
node in the trees was evaluated using 500 bootstrap
resamplings.
To construct the LexA protein tree across cyanobacteria, gram-positive bacteria, a-proteobacteria, δ-proteobacteria and g-proteobacteria and some other bacteria
strains/species (Figure S2 in Additional file 3), we first
downloaded 598 sequenced microbial genome sequences
from NCBI, and then identified LexA orthologs in them
by the BDBH method described above. Multiple
sequence alignments of these LexA sequences were
made using ClustalW implemented in MEGA [41] with
default settings. The phylogenetic tree was then constructed in the same way as the 27 LexA protein tree.
The phylogenetic tree (Figure S1 in Additional file 2)
of LexA-binding sites in cyanobacteria, B. subtilis,
a-proteobacteria and E. coli K12 was generated by the

Page 13 of 17

STAMP web tool [42] with the default alignment parameters: Pearson correlation coefficient for column comparison metric; ungapped Smith-Waterman for pair-wise
alignment. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using
the UPGMA method implemented in STAMP [42].
Phylogenetic footprinting and construction of LexAbinding sites in cyanobacteria

The previous study by Mazon et al. [16] characterized
the LexA boxes associated with two genes: alr4908
(lexA) and all3272 (recA). Four putative LexA boxes
were also identified in the promoter regions of alr3716
(uvrA), alr0088 (ssb), alr4905, and all4790 in Nostoc sp
PCC7120 in that study. The orthologs (if they exist) of
these six genes in PCC7120 were identified in the other
25 cyanobacterial genomes which harbor a lexA gene.
We pooled the entire upstream inter-TU regions of
these six genes in the target genome Nostoc sp.
PCC7120 as well as those of the TUs containing at least
one of the orthologs of these six genes in other cyanobacteria. If the length of the inter-TU region is longer
than 800 bases, then only the immediate upstream 800
bases were extracted. Two motif finding programs,
MEME [25,43] and BioProspector [26], were then
applied to these pooled inter-TU regions to identify
palindromic 14-mers as putative LexA-binding sites in
these sequences according to previous studies [16].
MEME applies an expectation maximization method to
fit a two-component finite mixture model and returns
the identified motifs with an E-value [43], while BioProspector employs a Gibbs sampling strategy and estimates the significance of the identified motif by a
Monte Carlo method [44]. These two programs were
selected as they are widely used and often have complementary predictions [45,46]. MEME identified 45 putative LexA-binding sites with an overall E-value of 1.4e026 for its most significant predicted motif, while BioProspector detected 39 putative LexA boxes in its most
significant predicted motif (see Additional file 1 for
details). High-scoring putative LexA-binding sites from
either program were selected to build the LexA-binding
sites profile (Table 1) in cyanobacteria. Sequence logos
of binding sites were created using the Weblogo server
[47].
Genome wide prediction of LexA-binding sites

We used the profile constructed above to scan the interTU regions of the genomes to predict all putative
LexA-binding sites using a scanning algorithm that we
previously developed [29-31]. This algorithm is briefly
described as follows.

For each predicted TU U(g 1 ,g 2 ,...,g n ) composed of
genes g1,g2,...,gn in genome G, we extracted its upstream
inter-TU regions and the first 40 bases of coding region
(if its length is longer than 800 bases, then only the
immediate upstream 800 bases were extracted), denoted
as IU(g1,g2,...,gn). The set of all the IU(g1,g2,...,gn) in this genome is denoted as IU . To find the best matching substring in a sequence t in IU (t Î IU) when scanned by
profile M, we use the following scoring function:

where l is the length of the binding sites of profile M,
h any substring of sequence t with length l (i.e. each
l-mer of the sequence t), h(i) the base at the i-th position
of h, p(i,b) the frequency of base b at position i in M, q(b)
is the frequency of base b in the aggregated inter-TU
regions for the organism, Ii is basically the information
content or the relative entropy of the column [28,48]
divided by a normalization factor a, a is the upper limit
of the information content Ii for this column to keep Ii Î
[0, 1], n the number of binding sites for constructing the
profile M. To avoid zero value of the numerator p(i,b), a
pseudo count 1 is added to the counts of the each base
{A, C, G, T} in column i.
To show the derivation of the normalization factor a,
we considered the extreme case: for a column i of profile M containing n binding sites, the more conserved
the column is, the higher its information content Ii will
be, and the maximum information content for column i
occurs when this column is completely homogeneous.
That is, all sequences have the same nucleotide, say, A
at that position, and this nucleotide has the smallest
background frequency, q(A), noted as q 0 . Thus, after
adding one pseudocount to the counts of each of the
four nucleotides to column i, the frequency of base A of
column i in the profile will therefore be (n+1)/(n+4),
and 1/(n+4) for the other three nucleotides. Then the
upper limit a of the prenormalized Ii as shown by formula (3) can be derived as follows.

Intuitively, we slide a window of length l across
sequence t with the profile M, and return the substring
h with the highest score defined by (1).
Since true regulatory binding sites are likely to be
more conserved than other inter-TU sequences and
thus tend to be shared by closely related orthologous
genes. For each genome (considered as a target genome), we reward its putative binding sites appeared to
be conserved in regions upstream from orthologous
genes in other genomes. To do this, we assume a transcription unit U(g 1 ,g 2 ,...,g n ) in the target genome G is
composed of n genes. Gene gi (i = 1...n) has orthologs in
mi genomes G1, G2, ..., G mi , and ok (gi) is the upstream
inter-TU sequence associated with the orthologous gene
gi in genome Gk (for a graphic explanation, see Figure
S5 in Additional file 2). Then the s M (t) score for the
inter-TU sequence t upstream from U(g1,g2,...,gn) in genome G can be increased by a term Amax(gi):
s(t ) = s M(t ) + A max ( g i )

where A max (g i ) is the value calculated for gene g i

where d i,k is the Hamming distance between the
sequence h detected by the profile M in sequence t and
the corresponding sequence in, ok (gi) and l is the length
of the binding sites in profile M.
Since the orthologs of genes of a transcription unit in
one organism may not comprise a single transcription
unit in another. For U(g 1,g2,...,gn) in target genome G,
orthologs of g1,g2,...,gn may be separated into different
TUs in other genomes, therefore we evaluated the
orthologous inter-TU sequences for each gene in (g 1 ,
g2,...,gn), and chose the gene gi whose orthologs across
other genomes have the maximum average of the product of two terms indicated above. Then by combining
formula (5) and (6), the refined score of the best putative binding site in sequence t can be defined as:

of scores of binding sites found in I U and C U , respectively, and P(S(t) >s) be the cumulative probability of
finding a binding site in a sequence t (t Î IU (or) t ÎCU)
with a score S(t) > s as defined by equation (7). Next, the
false positive rate, p(S CU > s) can be used to evaluate the
statistical significance of the motif score s of a inter-TU
sequence. p(S CU > s) is actually the fraction of coding
sequences bearing a putative binding site with a score
higher than s in the coding sequences set C U in genome G. In other words, it describes the extent to
which one can find a motif with a score higher than s
by chance. Thus, it can be considered as an empirical
p-value for a binding site score s. A cut-off score s corresponding to a p-value <0.01 is used for the LexAbinding site and regulon prediction in each genome in
this study.
To evaluate the confidence of our overall predictions in
inter-TU regions in one genome, we used a log odds ratio
(LOR) to compare the probability of finding a putative
binding site in an inter-TU region with the probability of
finding a putative binding site in a randomly extracted
coding region by considering all the extracted IUs and CUs
in a genome. We estimated the statistical significance of
the predictions using the LOR function defined as
LOR( s) = ln

p(S I U > s)
p(S CU > s)

.

Statistical significance of predicted binding sites

To evaluate the extent to which a putative binding site
with a score s or higher can be found purely by chance,
we randomly extracted coding sequence with the
same length as IU(g1,g2,...,gn), denoted as CU(g1,g2,...,gn). All
the CU(g1,g2,...,gn) extracted in genome G form the set CU.
The score of an extracted sequence t (t ÎCU) scanned
by a profile M is also defined by formula (1). Note that
each randomly chosen CU(g1,g2,...,gn) has nothing to do
with U(g 1 ,g 2,...,g n). Therefore, when incorporating the
additional score from reference genomes (formula (7)),
the coding sequence o k (g i ) is unlikely the coding
sequence associated with the orthologous genes of g1,
g 2 ,...,g n in a reference genome G k as it is a randomly
chosen one. To avoid possible biased sampling of coding
sequences for each I U(g1,g2,...,gn) in I U , we randomly
extracted 300 coding sequences CU(g1,g2,...,gn) sharing the
same length as IU(g1,g2,...,gn). These randomly chosen coding regions for all the U(g1,g2,...,gn) in genome G form a
sequence set CU, then each sequence in the set CU was
scanned using formula (7). Let S(IU) and S(CU) be the set

The LOR function for a genome is the log-odds ratio
of the fraction of the inter-TU sequences containing a
binding site with a score higher than s to the fraction of
the randomly selected coding sequences containing a
binding site with a score higher than the same s in the
genome. Accordingly, a monotonic increase in positive
LOR with the increase in the motif score in a genome
would suggest that this genome is likely to contain
some high-scoring LexA-binding sites.
Analysis of the conservation of LexA regulons in
cyanobacteria

We defined the conservation (cij) between two regulons
Ri and Rj from genome i and j, respectively, as,
c ij =

| Ri ∩ R j |
| Ri ∪ R j |

=

| Ri ∩ R j |
| Ri | + | R j | − | Ri ∩ R j |

(9)

Where |Ri ∩ Rj| is the number of orthologous genes
shared by both regulons Ri and Rj. We took the reciprocal of c1ij as the distance dij between the two regulons.
A neighbor joining tree (Figure 3) based on a distance
matrix such defined was constructed using PHYLIP [49]
and displayed by MEGA [41].
