Abstract
Background: Despite the diversity of motif representations and search algorithms, the de novo
computational identification of transcription factor binding sites remains constrained by the limited
accuracy of existing algorithms and the need for user-specified input parameters that describe the
motif being sought.
Results: We present a novel ensemble learning method, SCOPE, that is based on the assumption
that transcription factor binding sites belong to one of three broad classes of motifs: nondegenerate, degenerate and gapped motifs. SCOPE employs a unified scoring metric to combine
the results from three motif finding algorithms each aimed at the discovery of one of these classes
of motifs. We found that SCOPE's performance on 78 experimentally characterized regulons from
four species was a substantial and statistically significant improvement over that of its component
algorithms. SCOPE outperformed a broad range of existing motif discovery algorithms on the same
dataset by a statistically significant margin.
Conclusion: SCOPE demonstrates that combining multiple, focused motif discovery algorithms
can provide a significant gain in performance. By building on components that efficiently search for
motifs without user-defined parameters, SCOPE requires as input only a set of upstream sequences
and a species designation, making it a practical choice for non-expert users. A user-friendly web
interface, Java source code and executables are available at http://genie.dartmouth.edu/scope.

Backgound
The computational discovery of DNA binding sites for
previously uncharacterized transcription factors in groups
of co-regulated genes is a well-studied problem with a
great deal of practical relevance to the biologist, since such
binding sites provide targets for mutational analyses (for
reviews see [1-3]).

The position-specific variability of transcription factor
binding sites makes their de novo identification challenging. Many computational motif finding methods are
based on the observation that transcription factor binding
sites occur more often than expected by chance in the
upstream regions of the set of genes regulated by the same
transcription factor [1]. The problem thus simplifies to the

identification of overrepresented motifs in a given set of
upstream sequences.

cult for a first-time user to select a motif finder on a
principled basis.

Motif finding programs rely on a search algorithm to optimize a motif model (an abstract representation of a set of
transcription factor binding sites). Most recent programs
represent motifs as position weight matrices (PWMs),
which record the frequency of each base at every position
in the motif. Other motif finding programs have relied on
the use of consensus motif models (in which every base is
represented by a letter of the 15-letter IUPAC code, which
accounts for degeneracies as well as single bases) or k-mismatch motif models (in which a non-degenerate word
with at most k allowed mismatches is used to represent
the word). Regardless of the motif model used, a search
for all overrepresented motifs of any length and degree of
degeneracy leads to a dauntingly large search space. Thus,
motif finding algorithms restrict their search space by
using simplified motif representations, employing heuristic search strategies that are prone to local optima, or
invoking additional parameters to limit the search space
and thereby pass some of the optimization process off to
the user [3].

A key result of the Tompa, et al. study was the finding that
all of the motif finders had roughly the same average performance under a wide range of conditions and test statistics [5]. This finding was particularly notable because the
motif finders studied employed a wide range of motif representations, scoring functions and search strategies and
all were operated under the most favorable conditions
possible. Although the average performance of the programs did not differ significantly, the authors found that,
for each pair of programs, each program performed better
than the other on some subset of the data [5]. Previous
studies over smaller numbers of motif finders have found
that no program clearly stands out as superior to the others and each program outperforms all others on some subset of the regulons [6-8]. This diversity of performance has
led a number of authors to speculate that ensemble methods, comprising multiple motif finders, may lead to
improvements in accuracy [1,5,8].

Program parameters (such as motif length, number of
occurrences and orientation) that cannot be reasonably
specified by the user without prior knowledge about the
true binding sites are referred to as nuisance parameters
[4]. Selection of the correct settings for these parameters is
a crucial step in motif finding, and is often assumed to be
the domain of experts. In a recent evaluation, Hu and colleagues [4] compared the performance of five motif finders on a single prokaryotic genome, systematically
exploring the effects of nuisance parameters, including
expected motif length and number of occurrences. Every
motif finder they tested was found to be sensitive to values
used for these parameters. Guidance on the specific
parameter settings to use for given motif finding situations is not provided in most publications presenting
motif finders. Even assuming that optimal parameter settings exist for a motif finding program for each specific situation, for the typical biologist looking to identify motifs
in a set of uncharacterized sequences, acquiring such
expertise is an onerous task.
Nuisance parameters complicate the interpretation of performance comparisons as well. A recent large-scale performance comparison between thirteen different motif
finding tools used expert knowledge in setting the parameters for every program [5]. Several of the programs contributing to the performance comparison were run with
different parameter settings for each regulon, and in some
cases, motifs were hand filtered as a post-processing step.
Such performance comparisons evaluate not just algorithms but also the expertise of the users, making it diffi-

Ensemble methods, well known in the machine learning
community [9], are typically composed of multiple methods comprising different search strategies (or the same
search strategies with different initiation settings or random restarts) with a unified objective function. The final
predictions are chosen from the ensemble of methods by
a learning rule, which may be as simple as finding the
maximum score from all the methods, or as complex as
optimizing a weighted scoring scheme from among the
methods. The construction of this learning rule is key to
the performance of an ensemble learning method, as the
performance of an ensemble method with an ineffective
learning rule will be the average of the performance of its
component algorithms. In this context, we note that
Tompa et al. [5] found that, although every motif finding
program tested had some regulons on which its performance was clearly superior, it was not possible a priori to
predict which motif finder represented the best choice
under any given set of conditions [5]. This observation
serves to illustrate the challenges to the construction of an
effective learning rule.
To the best of our knowledge, only one study to date has
explored ensemble learning in motif finding. Hu, Li and
Kihara [4] described a simple ensemble method wherein
the component programs were random restarts of the
same stochastic algorithm (such as Gibbs sampling or
Expectation Maximization) and the learning rule was a
voting scheme in which the results of each random restart
cast a "vote" for which positions in the DNA sequence
should be part of the final reported motif (hereafter, we
refer to this as the HLK method). Under this scheme, the
authors found that ensemble learning resulted in an

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:249

increase in performance ranging from 6 to 45%. The HLK
voting method provides a framework wherein a number
of different motifs finders can be combined under the
heuristic that if several motif finders make the same (or
overlapping) prediction, then that prediction is accurate.
Here we present a novel ensemble motif finder based on
a different conceptual approach. Rather than randomly
restarting the same search algorithm or comparing multiple search strategies that all search for the same global
optimum (and are potentially vulnerable to the same
local optima), our algorithm assumes that the "biological
significance surface" primarily consists of three local
optima, and that one of these peaks represents the global
optimum. Thus, our ensemble uses three specialized algorithms whose search spaces restrict them to each of these
three local optima (BEAM for non-degenerate motifs,
PRISM for degenerate motifs and SPACER for bipartite
motifs). We have previously demonstrated that the greedy
search strategies employed by each of these methods
allow them to reliably search their respective motif
domains without the use of nuisance parameters, as the
algorithms themselves efficiently optimize the parameters
that are typically forced on the users [10-12].
The results of these component algorithms are then combined using a learning rule that is simply the maximum
score returned by each component algorithm. To make
comparisons possible, the motif scores returned by each
algorithm are penalized according to the complexity of
the motif. The resulting ensemble algorithm, SCOPE, has
no nuisance parameters and performs significantly better
than its component algorithms. In addition, we find that
SCOPE performs favorably compared to a diverse range of
existing methods and is robust to the presence of extraneous sequences in its input.

Results
Algorithm
SCOPE takes as input a set of sequences U that are
upstream of a set of genes G that are thought to be coregulated. The ultimate goal of a motif finder is to identify
the specific subsequences Ã in U that act as binding sites
for the transcription factor(s) that regulate G. In practice,
sets of binding sites are represented using a motif. We have
found that simple consensus motifs over the full IUPAC
alphabet (a 15-letter code consisting of the bases A,T,C,G
and all possible combinations) provide enough representational power to adequately describe Ã, while still allowing for an efficient search [3,4]. While alternative
representations, such as position weight matrices (PWMs)
are more expressive, their heuristic searches are prone to
local optima and often do not perform well in practice
[3,4,11-13].

SCOPE has three component algorithms, BEAM, PRISM
and SPACER, which search for non-degenerate, short
degenerate, and long, highly degenerate and "gapped"
motifs, respectively (Figure 1). Each motif is scored considering one or both strands and the motif is marked to
indicate which calculation scores higher. The results of the
three algorithms are merged and sorted. Artifactual
motifs, whose significance can be accounted for by higher
scoring motifs that they overlap, are identified and
removed (for details, see Additional file 1, section S1).
Each of SCOPE's three component algorithms seeks to
maximize the same objective function over a different
class of motifs. Let M be a random variable over the full
space of IUPAC words. The statistical significance p(M =
m) of a particular word m is determined by the distribution of M over the entire space of upstream sequences in
the given species. In general, we seek to maximize -

BEAM. For yeast (whose upstream regions are standardized
to 800 bp), BEAM and PRISM use the overrepresentation-KS
objective function (so/ks), while SPACER's slower running
time requires the simpler overrepresentation objective function (so). The top 5 motifs from SPACER are rescored using
the combined objective function. For bacteria and Drosophila,
upstream regions are defined to be the intergenic region
upstream of each gene; thus, the KS objective function is not
used. The results of each program are sorted by Sig and
lower scoring motifs that substantially overlap higher scoring
motifs are removed. The filtered lists of motifs from the
three programs are finally merged by Sig score. Repetitive
motifs are identified and removed during all stages.

log(p(M = m)). All values of M are not, however, equally
likely a priori. For example, it is quite likely that there
exists an extremely long sequence that is entirely unique
to U. Such a unique sequence would appear to be highly
significant, until we consider that we have in effect
searched all possible sequences until we found one that is
unique. To correct for this multiple hypothesis testing problem, van Helden et al. [14] proposed using a Bonferroni
correction, in which p(M = m) is penalized by the number
of motifs N of length |m|:
Sig = -log(p(M = m)Â·N).
Thus, if m = "ACGT", N = 44. We employed this same definition of Sig for BEAM, our algorithm that searches for
non-degenerate motifs [10]. Defining N for degenerate or
bipartite motifs raises a significant conceptual challenge.
Van Helden et al. [14] chose to use the same definition,
but limited their search to a small number of degenerate
bases. In contrast, we have proposed that all characters
should not be treated equally, but should be penalized in
proportion to the information provided by them [11,12].
By this logic, "ACGT" will not be penalized differently
from "ACNNNNGT", as both have the same number of
bases that contribute any information to protein-DNA
binding. Building on this intuition, one can argue that the
characters "A" and "not-A" (IUPAC character "B") are
roughly equivalent, while "A or G" (IUPAC character "R")
is different from "A" as there are six ways to define a combination of two bases, while only four ways to define a
combination of one base or three bases. For motif m =
m1m2...mn, we can therefore define
N = â Choose(4, |mi|),
where |mi| is the number of DNA bases covered by the
IUPAC character mi. In the case were both orientations of
the motif are considered, this number is adjusted to
account for palindromes. The resulting Sig score thus
penalizes motifs based on their length and degeneracy,
enabling fair comparisons to be made between different
motif classes.
Testing
Evaluation of objective functions used by SCOPE
Each component algorithm in SCOPE efficiently searches
its restricted search space, keeping SCOPE's runtime low
(average runtime on our datasets were about one minute).
This efficiency allowed us to explore several objective
functions for scoring the statistical significance p(M = m)
of motifs. These objective functions were as follows: position bias (based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, or KS, statistic), overrepresentation (a Poisson-based measure
based on how often a motif occurs in U) and coverage (a
Poisson-based measure based on how many upstream

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/249

sequences contain the motif). For precise definitions, see
Methods.
To establish which objective function (or combination of
functions) was most suitable, we tested each objective
function independently of SCOPE, using a subset of the S.
cerevisiae dataset. The measure used to assess the biological relevance of a motif was accuracy, a measure of the
nucleotide level overlap between a motif and the known
binding sites (for details see Methods). From each regulon
from the SCPD database [15] we selected ten six-mers at
random from the upstream sequences and ten six-mers at
random from the collection of known binding sites for
that regulon. For each of these sampled six-mers, we calculated accuracy with respect to the known binding sites.
We also calculated the Sig score for each six-mer, using
four objective functions (KS, overrepresentation, coverage
and combined KS-overrepresentation). We then plotted
Sig versus accuracy for each objective function, to determine which objective functions correlated most strongly
with biological relevance (Figure 2).
These plots demonstrate that overrepresentation is a
closer approximation to biological relevance than coverage or KS alone. Adding KS to overrepresentation modestly improved the correlation by 13% (as compared to
overrepresentation alone) to R2 = 0.28. To assess the
degree of class separation achieved by the two objective
functions, we ranked the sampled six-mers by Sig score,
and calculated the percentage of motifs with high Sig
scores (in the 95th percentile and above) that possessed a
reasonable degree of overlap with the known binding sites
(accuracy â¥ 0.10). By the overrepresentation measure,
74.4% of high scoring motifs had accuracy = 0.10, while
79.1% of high scoring motifs by KS-overrepresentation
had accuracy â¥ 0.10.
This analysis suggests that more complex objective functions may provide a better estimate of biological significance than the overrepresentation objective functions
commonly used. We thus chose to run SCOPE using the
overrepresentation-KS combined objective function on
the S. cerevisiae dataset, in which the upstream regions are
of fixed length. We used the overrepresentation objective
function for the other species, as our upstream definitions
for those species were of variable length due to the available annotations. Because identifying the genomic positions of highly degenerate bipartite motifs is prohibitively
slow, initial rankings of motifs for SPACER were computed using the overrepresentation objective function,
and the overrepresentation-KS objective function was
used only to produce the final ordering and scores.
Although the KS objective function is computationally
expensive (linear in the frequency of the motif in the
genome), the SCOPE algorithms all aggressively limit the

search space, thereby making the use of this objective
function â and exploration of other complex objective
functions â possible.
The surprisingly low correlations between Sig and accuracymay indicate that the objective functions employed by
motif finding programs are only a first approximation to
biological significance. Indeed, previous studies have
reported little or no correlation between the significance
measures of various motif finders and measures of accuracy [4,16]. Further research into more biologically accurate objective functions may yield better performance for
motif discovery algorithms.

Evaluation of SCOPE performance and ensemble learning scheme
We first assessed the performance of the optimized
SCOPE framework on synthetic datasets (for details, see
Additional file 1, section S2). SCOPE performed well on
the synthetic datasets, correctly identifying 92% of
planted motifs that are over-represented relative to background (those motifs with a Sig score of greater than 5;
Figure 3).

While synthetic test sets are useful in algorithmic development and initial testing, the results of such tests must be
taken with a grain of salt, as they are highly dependent on
the model used to generate the test sets [6]. We therefore

Performance at different overrepresentation Sig values on
Performance at different overrepresentation Sig values on
synthetic data. A motif was "found" if the top scoring motif
returned by SCOPE overlapped the planted motif by at least
50%. Different Sig values were achieved by varying the
number of upstream regions, the number of motifs per
upstream region, and the number of extraneous upstream
regions without planted motifs. A Sig value of 0 implies that
one motif of that significance is expected by chance.

tested SCOPE on an extensive array of regulons with
known binding sites (for details of datasets, see Additional file 1, section S3). We ran SCOPE on each regulon
and, following the scoring methodology used by Sinha
and Tompa [6], we computed the accuracy for each of the
top three motifs reported by SCOPE against the known
binding sites. The motifs reported by SCOPE overlap to a
large extent with the published cis-regulatory elements (as
discussed in Additional file 1, section S3, a difference of
one base pair length between the reported motif and the
published cis-regulatory element results in an expected
accuracy of about 0.25). SCOPE was run on 78 regulons
from S. cerevisiae, B. subtilis, E. coli and D. melanogaster. On
these datasets, SCOPE's average accuracy was 0.28, 0.29,
0.16, and 0.08 respectively.

to the average of its three component algorithms. To provide a basis for evaluating the performance of SCOPE's
learning rule, we constructed an ensemble learning
method (referred to here as BASELINE) from the results of
BEAM, PRISM and SPACER, by randomly selecting one of
the accuracies from these three programs for each regulon.
Over 120,000 trials, BASELINE's average performance on
this dataset was 0.176 with a standard deviation of 0.013.
BASELINE's average score never exceeded that of SCOPE
(p < 8.25 Ã 10-6). When compared to its component algorithms, SCOPE picked the highest accuracy motif in 66%
of the cases (as opposed to 33% for a random selection
between three algorithms). These results suggest that
SCOPE's learning rule is highly effective, though it may
certainly be improved further.
Of course, SCOPE's learning rule is extremely simple, and
more complex learning rules may allow SCOPE to
approach its theoretical upper bound. One rule that may
prove effective is to weight the output of each algorithm
according to (for example) the frequency of occurrence of
each class of motif (non-degenerate, short degenerate or
long degenerate) in the species or by learning the appropriate weights on a representative training set, creating, in
effect, a NaÃ¯ve Bayesian Network. The training of a more
complex learning rule must, however, be performed in a
cross-validation framework, and the size of the available
dataset of regulons will place a practical limit on the complexity of the learning rule that can be devised.
Comparison with other motif finding programs
To provide a frame of reference for SCOPE's performance,
we ran ten other popular motif finders on these datasets
(for details and references see Table 2). We ran all programs directly from their websites, leaving all parameters
at their defaults. The only parameter that we specified
(where available) was the species from which the background sequences were derived. Thus, the results of this
performance comparison may be interpreted as a comparison against other motif finders when those motif finders
are run using their default values.

SCOPE's reported accuracy was significantly higher than
any of its component algorithms (Table 1). Indeed, we
found that SCOPE increased accuracy by 31â44% over
BEAM, PRISM or SPACER alone. This improvement was
achieved by combining BEAM's high positive predictive
value (PPV) with PRISM's high sensitivity (Figure 4). Sensitivity is defined here as the fraction of the known binding
sites (at the nucleotide level) predicted by the motif
finder, and PPV is defined as the fraction of nucleotides
predicted by the motif finder that correspond to the
known binding sites (see Methods for details).

SCOPE has no user-adjustable parameters, although its
component algorithms do contain a number of internal
parameters ("hyperparameters") that govern their search
over common nuisance parameters. On synthetic datasets, we found SCOPE's component algorithms to be
quite robust to the settings of these hyperparameters. We
have therefore fixed those parameters to reasonable values
and do not expose them to the user [10-12]. This construction means that SCOPE can only run in a default configuration.

An ensemble motif finder with a learning rule that is no
better than random will provide an accuracy that is equal

regulon for which a program had the highest accuracy and that accuracy was at least 0.10. Programs in a two-way tie are credited with
0.5 wins each, so by construction, SCOPE can at best share a win with one of the other programs. A perfect winner-take-all ensemble
method would have the same number of wins as all the component algorithms combined. A "clear win (loss)" is a regulon for which
SCOPE's accuracy was at least 0.10 higher (lower) than the other program. The p-value reported for the paired t-test was Bonferronicorrected to account for multiple (three) comparisons.

regulon, where that accuracy is at least 0.1) [6]. On this
dataset, SCOPE had the highest score by both criteria (Figure 5a). The cumulative distribution of accuracy shows
that SCOPE had the most high-scoring motifs at every
level (Figure 5b). When we looked at the number of clear
head-to-head wins (such a win is taken to occur when the
difference in accuracy between SCOPE and another motif
finder is greater than 0.1 [6]), we found that SCOPE
scored a clear majority (82%) of clear head-to-head wins
(Figure 5c). The average accuracies of BEAM, PRISM and
SPACER on this dataset were similar to those of the ten
other programs.

A formal statistical analysis found that SCOPE's performance margin over the other motif finders run on this dataset was statistically significant at p < 10-5 (for details, see
Additional file 1, section S3). Corroborating the results of
previously published performance comparisons [1,4-7],
none of the other programs showed a statistically significant difference relative to the other nine. Similarly, none
of SCOPE's component algorithms outperformed the
other ten programs on this dataset by a statistically significant margin.
SCOPE's high accuracy was a reflection of both high PPV
and high sensitivity (Figure 6a; see Methods for a precise
definition). By these measures, SCOPE was the only program that scored highly in both sensitivity and PPV (ranking first and second respectively). In contrast, none of the
other motif finders that performed well by one criterion
performed well by the other, as shown by the average
ranks for each motif finder over both sensitivity and PPV
(Figure 6b).

Performance in the presence of extraneous upstream sequences
In practice, microarray co-expression data are often used
to identify genes in a particular regulon. This approach
identifies genes that are either directly or indirectly regulated by the transcription factor of interest. Therefore, sets
of genes identified from co-expression data may often
contain multiple extraneous upstream sequences. Adding
sequences that do not contain binding sites decreases the
signal-to-noise ratio, making motif finding more difficult

and 4 times the number of true upstream sequences in the
regulon. SCOPE's accuracy on this dataset was remarkably
stable in the presence of extraneous sequences. Figure 7
shows the aggregate results of this test, with the SCPD regulons divided into three groups based on SCOPE's accuracy on the true regulon. For each set of regulons, SCOPE's
performance decayed gradually as increasing numbers of
extraneous genes were added to the regulon. These results
were consistent with the relationship between the Sig
score and performance on synthetic datasets (Figure 2).

Discussion
The field of motif finding is saturated with a large number
of algorithms representing myriad search strategies, objective functions and motif models. Yet remarkably, performance comparisons consistently reveal disappointing
performance for motif finders and fail to find any statistical significance between them. A brief survey of the perregulon results of these performance comparisons yields
two key observations: (1) there are many regulons for
which a large number of programs find a small portion of
the binding sites (though not necessarily the same portion); and (2) every program has a respectable number of
"wins" (i.e. every program is the best existing program on
some handful of regulons [1,4-8].

Such observations are common in many machine learning applications, and are the direct result of complex
search spaces that force restrictions on either the search
strategy or the representation of the solution space (in this
case, the motif model used to represent the motifs). For
example, YMF and RSAT are guaranteed to find the optimal solutions in their motif space (fixed-length motifs
with limited degeneracies), but that space is limited to the
point that optimality provides no clear advantage over the
other methods. Conversely, the PWM-based methods
have an apparently more powerful motif model [17], but
their search strategies cannot guarantee optimality and
often terminate at local optima.
The HLK ensemble method [4] successfully exploits the
first key observation above. By running the same (stochastic) algorithm multiple times and using a voting method,
those subsequences of the binding sites that are repeatedly
reported become clear while the spurious bases are eliminated. Hu and colleagues report that this method
increased accuracy and proposed that their approach may
prove effective when running different algorithms as well
[4]. The limitation arises, however, in regulons where only
one program has a high accuracy and the others fail to
find any portion of the binding sites. In such cases, it is

likely that a voting-based ensemble will follow the crowd
and fail to find the true binding site.
The second observation, that all motif finders win some
number of regulons and often perform roughly the same
on average, is broadly consistent with a theorem in the
Machine Learning field referred to as the No Free Lunch
Theorem [18,19]. Briefly, this theorem states that, averaged over all datasets, the performance of all search algorithms are exactly the same, with the corollary that two
algorithms will have the exact same number of wins in
relation to each other. In practice, this theorem argues for
the use of specialized domain knowledge [20], where
available, and may suggest that similar average performance across a diversity of approaches is an indication of
the diversity of the datasets themselves. Thus, motif finders designed for one class of motifs will win on regulons
containing those motifs, but will perform poorly on other
regulons, while more general motif finders will tend to
have more consistently mediocre performance.
In this light, SCOPE can be seen as leveraging the second
key observation by embracing the No Free Lunch Theorem: rather than boost average performance by taking the
average results of three general purpose algorithms,
SCOPE uses highly specialized algorithms and assumes
each will perform strongly on some regulons and weakly
on others (and that the unified scoring metric can tell the
difference). The working hypothesis is, in effect, that the

local maxima are predictable (corresponding to one of
three motif classes) and exploitable (we can find the local
maxima in each class and choose whichever is higher).
Consistent with this hypothesis, there was very little overlap among the component algorithms of SCOPE (each
wins about 20 of the 78 regulons, with very few ties) and,
by taking the maximum score from those three local
maxima, SCOPE tended to choose the motif with the
highest accuracy in a clear majority of the cases (66%,
compared to 33% for a random learning rule). Furthermore, SCOPE not only significantly outperformed its
components on this dataset, it also outperformed a
number of general purpose algorithms that seek to find
the global maximum in a single pass.
Of course, based on the No Free Lunch Theorem, SCOPE's
performance averaged over all theoretically possible datasets will still converge to that of the other motif finding
approaches (including random guessing). As the physical
properties of transcription factors will inevitably constrain
the structure of their binding sites, biologically relevant
datasets comprise a subset of the space of all theoretically
possible sequences. Our test set of 78 regulons was
selected in a blinded manner (for details, see Additional
file 1, section S3), thus these results suggest the generalizability of SCOPE's use of domain knowledge on biologically relevant datasets from these species.
These observations are not offered as definitive proof that
there are only three classes of motifs; rather, they show
that power can be gained by identifying distinct motif
classes and combining specialized algorithms with a unified scoring rule. It is possible that more power could be
gained by identifying other distinct motif classes and adding algorithms that explicitly search for those classes. For
example, Zinc finger transcription factors have been demonstrated to bind three triplets of nucleotides which overlap at their third base positions [21]. This observation
could be leveraged by a search algorithm that explicitly
searches for motifs matching this unique structure. Thus,
all nondegenerate triplets in a set of upstream regions
could be scored and the highest-scoring triplets combined
into a single five-mer with a two-base degeneracy (corresponding to the IUPAC characters R,Y, W, S, K or M) at the
middle position. The highest-scoring five-mers could then
be combined with the highest scoring triplets to generate
a seven-mer with two-base degeneracies at positions three
and five. Provided the appropriate Bonferroni correction
is applied for this new class of motifs, these motifs may be
easily compared with the results from BEAM, PRISM and
SPACER, thereby extending the SCOPE ensemble to
include a fourth class of motifs. We note, however, that as
more methods are added to SCOPE, it will be increasingly
difficult to devise a scoring metric that can accurately
choose the best result from among the components.

SCOPE may also serve as a complementary approach to
the HLK method. For example, the parameters of many
methods can be set to search for specific classes of motifs
(such as bipartite versus non-bipartite motifs). Thus, analogous to the ensemble method described in this paper,
one may build a hierarchical ensemble that first searches
each motif class by the HLK method using a number of
algorithms or random restarts, and then uses the SCOPE
method to choose the best result from among the motif
classes. One constraint associated with such an approach
is the run-time. A second constraint associated with a hierarchical ensemble learning method is the multiplicative
increase in the number of parameters associated with it,
though this problem may be ameliorated by the use of
parameter-free algorithms that employ restricted search
spaces.
An important factor to consider when taking the best of
multiple runs is the relative size of the search space. Certainly to maintain statistical validity, some correction
must be made for multiple hypothesis testing. Furthermore, the effects of multiple testing may bias the results in
favor of one of the component algorithms. To ensure statistical validity and avoid such a bias, we developed a simple Bonferroni-like correction, which penalized every
proposed motif proportional to its length and degree of
degeneracy, resulting in a modest improvement of 8% in
SCOPE's accuracy.
Although our test set of 78 regulons gave us enough power
to find significance between SCOPE and its components
or other algorithms, it did not provide enough power to
disentangle the effects of small improvements (such as the
Bonferroni correction, the objective function that takes
position bias into account, or scoring motifs based off one
or both strands), especially in the rigorous cross-validation framework necessary to decipher precisely which
aspects contribute significantly to the performance. Nevertheless, as larger datasets become available, SCOPE's
efficient search strategy makes it an ideal platform for
exploring the effect of focused improvements to the motif
finding approach described, such as the use of complex
objective functions that may better approximate biological significance.
The comparisons to other motif finding programs in this
study are provided to place SCOPE's performance in the
broader context of the motif finding field, particularly
when viewed from the standpoint of the practicing
"bench" biologist. Any performance comparison must be
interpreted with caution, since the results are highly
dependent on the dataset used, the conditions of the testing and the metrics used for evaluation. With this in mind,
we sought to evaluate a wide representation of motif finders on a large number of regulons using performance met-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/249

rics consistent with previous studies [6,7]. To the best of
our knowledge, this dataset represents the largest set of
biologically relevant regulons used for performance comparisons to date. Whereas previous performance comparisons attempt to optimize the parameters of the programs
in question [4,6,7] or allow expert users to tune their own
programs and manually filter both the input and output
[5] we intentionally made our comparisons between programs without manually optimizing any parameters for
any species so as to emulate typical use conditions. Our
comparison thus complements the recent large scale study
of Tompa et al., who gauge performance under optimal
conditions on semi-synthetic data sets [5], as well as the
study of Hu et al., who explore the effect of parameter
optimization on a handful of popular motif finders [4].
Although the present philosophy of performance comparison implicitly benefits SCOPE, which has no parameters
to optimize, it is arguably the most relevant comparison
possible for the typical biologist. Although previous studies have shown the potential importance of choosing
parameters carefully [4,6], we note that the results we
obtained under default settings were quite similar to those
reported in previous studies (for details, see Additional
file 1, section S3). Arguably, systematic parameter optimization for each of these programs may well yield higher
accuracy scores than those reported here. However, in
order to avoid the pitfall of overfitting to the dataset, such
parameter optimization must be performed using crossvalidation or some other resampling technique [9,22,23].
We note that all the motif finders tested, including
SCOPE, performed poorly on the Drosophila dataset.
Although SCOPE had the highest accuracy on this dataset,
that accuracy was significantly less than on the bacterial
and yeast data. Especially poor performance on Drosophila
was also reported in the Tompa et al. performance comparison, indicating that this difficulty is not limited to the
current dataset [5]. One possible cause of poor performance in this study is that the "regulons" are derived from
enhancer regions defined in an earlier computational
paper [24]. Whereas a background set of promoter regions
is easy to identify, it is not clear how to define a reasonable genomic sample of enhancers. Thus, the background
sequences used by SCOPE and the other programs may
not be representative of the "true" background model of
enhancers, leading to inaccurate statistics. The persistently
poor performance of motif finders on Drosophila regulons
thus highlights the importance of using well-defined
background sequences to calibrate the statistics of the
objective functions being optimized. Recently, algorithms
have been reported that predict enhancer regions on a
genome wide scale [[24-26][27,28]]. It is possible that
using such algorithms to define a collection of background enhancer sequences may improve the perform-

value (PPV, if mi represents the reported binding sites). See
Additional file 1, section S3, for a discussion on the use of
Phi score for measuring accuracy.

Conclusion
Ensemble methods hold the potential for providing
improvements in motif finding accuracy without resorting
to the use of additional data (such as phylogenetic information or characterization of the domain structure of the
transcription factor), which are not always available. Typically, ensemble learning methods are plagued with certain liabilities, such as increased runtimes, logistical
complexity and a multiplicity of nuisance parameters, all
of which grow with the number of programs run. In the
machine learning field, ensemble methods have coexisted
for many years with non-ensemble methods, with no clear
superiority having been established between the two.
SCOPE serves as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating an
efficient and effective approach to ensemble-based motif
finding. By dividing the search space into tractable
domains, SCOPE mitigates the potential liabilities associated with ensemble methods, resulting in a program that
is capable of finding cis-regulatory elements of arbitrary
length, degree of degeneracy, motif orientation and frequency of occurrence. Its strong performance, rapid runtime and freedom from nuisance parameters make it a
simple and effective tool for the biologist.

Methods
Accuracy, Sensitivity and Positive Predictive Value
Each algorithm's accuracy for each regulon was measured
via the Phi score (also referred to as nucleotide level performance coefficient, or nPC, in previous performance
comparisons [4-6,11]. This metric, first proposed by
Pevzner and Sze [29], measures the degree of overlap
between the actual instances of two motifs (or sets of
motifs) m1 and m2 in the set of co-regulated upstream
sequences. The Phi score can be defined as follows: let U
be a unique numbering of all the bases in the upstream
sequences of a given gene set, and IU(m) â U be the set of
bases that are covered by actual instances of m in U. Phi is
then defined as the ratio of the number of bases occupied
by the actual instances of both the motifs, to the total
number of bases occupied by the actual instances of either
of the two motifs:

Î¦U(m1, m2) = [IU(m1) â© IU(m2)]/[IU(m1) âª IU(m2)].
This metric therefore takes both false positives and false
negatives into account at the level of the individual bases
that are actually covered by the motif. As in Hu et al. [4],
we define accuracy to be the Phi score between the known
and predicted binding sites. Changing the denominator of
the Phi equation to be IU(mi) yields the sensitivity (if mi
represents the true binding sites) or the positive predictive

Objective functions for Statistical Significance
In line with other motif finders, we have used statistical
significance as a surrogate for biological significance.
Since the latter cannot be defined without data that obviates the need for computational motif finding, objective
functions that approximate biological significance are
critical. In this section, we detail the objective functions
we used and their effect on SCOPE's performance. For any
motif m, each objective function provides a definition for
p(m), the probability of observing a motif with the same
sufficient statistics as m assuming a particular null model.
This p-value is used in the computation of the Sig score
(see Results).
Overrepresentation
The most common statistical test in motif finding is based
on overrepresentation, which can be roughly defined as
the probability that a motif m that is observed C(m) times
in the regulon would occur at least C(m) times in a random collection of the same number of genes. In the context of consensus motifs, overrepresentation is expressed
in terms of a multinomial model, in which each position
i in each gene j is a random variable Xij that can take on
any motif allowed by the particular motif model. The
probability of seeing m at least C(m) times in the regulon
can be approximated by the Poisson distribution:

p(m) = âkâ¥C(m) [(Î»ke-Î»)/k! ]
where Î» is the expectation of C(m) with respect to the null
motif distribution and the number of positions in the regulon. A detailed justification of this approach was given
by Carlson et al. [11]. The expectation Î» is most accurately
modeled using Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs)
computed as the actual proportion of any given motif in
the complete set of all upstream sequences in the genome
[10]. These MLEs are implemented as lookups of exact
substrings, which can be performed efficiently using a suffix array data structure [10-12].
Coverage
A simple modification to the overrepresentation objective
function is coverage, which is identical to overrepresentation with the modification that C(m) is the number of
upstream regions in the regulon that have one or more
instances of m and Î», the expectation of C(m), is determined from the proportion of upstream regions in the
genome that contain the motif. While this objective function prevents a single upstream region from dominating a
motif's score, it fails to account for multiple instances of a

Page 13 of 15

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:249

binding site in a single gene that may arise due to cooperative binding.
Positional bias
Transcription factors often require their binding sites to be
located in a restricted range relative to the start of transcription. One well known example is TBP (TATA-binding
protein), which localizes the RNA polymerase complex by
binding the TATA-box motif roughly 25 bases upstream of
the transcription start site [30]. While other examples of
binding sites with positional restrictions are well known,
few motif finders incorporate position in their scoring
function. In the case where all upstream regions are the
same length, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic provides a natural test for positional bias. The KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) statistic is a non-parametric statistic that
measures the probability that two samples are drawn from
the same distribution. Let X be the sample that we wish to
compare to some reference sample Y. The KS statistic is
defined to be the maximum absolute difference between
the unbiased cumulative distribution functions of X and
Y. The KS statistic has a well-defined distribution from
which a p-value can be easily computed. Kuiper's variation
was used to increase sensitivity in the tails of the distribution [31].

In the context of motifs, we defined the test sample X for
a motif m to be the set of starting positions (with respect
to transcription start sites) of m in the regulon. The reference sample Y is defined as the set of starting positions of
m in all upstream regions in the genome. Thus, pKS(m) is
a measure of how m is localized differently in the regulon
than in the genome as a whole. It is also possible to define
Y as the uniform distribution; however, we found that
many motifs had non-uniform distributions throughout
all upstream regions of the genome, possibly as an artifact
of the non-uniform AT/CG distributions in upstream
regions [32].
Combining overrepresentation and positional bias
Since overrepresentation and KS are independent, the
probabilities can simply be multiplied together to yield
the probability of randomly sampling a motif with a given
degree of overrepresentation and positional bias.
Motif orientation
Many transcription factors will bind motifs on either DNA
strand. Others, such as the general transcription factor
TBP (TATA-Binding Protein), require a specific orientation and will only function if bound to motifs on a specific DNA strand [30]. In scoring a motif m, a choice must
therefore be made as to whether or not the reverse complement mR of m will be considered to be the same motif
as m. Most programs assume motif orientation does not
matter and so define m = mR. Such an assumption may be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/249

overly generous â as the TBP example above makes clear,
the transcriptional machinery of a cell is clearly able to
differentiate between the two strands. We thus chose to
attach a flag to each motif, indicating whether or not the
motif should be orientation-neutral. BEAM and SPACER
thus enumerate and evaluate all motifs with both values
of this flag. SCOPE reports that orientation does matter
(i.e. m â  mR) for 17% of the regulons in our biological test
set.
