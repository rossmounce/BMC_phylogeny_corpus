A further insight into the sialome of the tropical
bont tick, Amblyomma variegatum

Abstract
Background: Ticks–vectors of medical and veterinary importance–are themselves also significant pests. Tick salivary
proteins are the result of adaptation to blood feeding and contain inhibitors of blood clotting, platelet
aggregation, and angiogenesis, as well as vasodilators and immunomodulators. A previous analysis of the
sialotranscriptome (from the Greek sialo, saliva) of Amblyomma variegatum is revisited in light of recent advances in
tick sialomes and provides a database to perform a proteomic study.
Results: The clusterized data set has been expertly curated in light of recent reviews on tick salivary proteins,
identifying many new families of tick-exclusive proteins. A proteome study using salivary gland homogenates
identified 19 putative secreted proteins within a total of 211 matches.
Conclusions: The annotated sialome of A. variegatum allows its comparison to other tick sialomes, helping to
consolidate an emerging pattern in the salivary composition of metastriate ticks; novel protein families were also
identified. Because most of these proteins have no known function, the task of functional analysis of these proteins
and the discovery of novel pharmacologically active compounds becomes possible.

Background
The tropical bont tick, Amblyomma variegatum, is a
major pest of ruminants in Africa [1-3], causing skin
lesions [4] and most importantly by vectoring the obligate intracellular proteobacterium Erlichia ruminatium,
the causative agent of heartwater or cowdriosis in ruminants [5]. Although originally from Africa, A. variegatum
has been established in the West Indies and is an important threat to domestic ruminants in the Americas [5,6].
Among the adaptations found in ticks for successful
blood feeding, their salivary glands (SGs) have compounds that counteract host hemostasis and inflammation, including anticlotting, antiplatelet, vasodilatory,
antihistaminic, antileukotriene, anticomplement, antichemokine, and immune-modulatory compounds [7-11].
During the past 10 years, the peptidic composition of
tick saliva has been inferred from transcriptome studies,
where hundreds of polypeptides are associated with a
salivary function in at least 25 broad groups of protein
families [7,12]. Perhaps because secreted salivary

proteins are under attack by host antibodies, their rate
of evolution is fast; conceivably, it is for this reason that
there are many salivary protein families that are, at the
primary sequence level, unique to the organism’s genus
level. Tick salivary compounds are of interest for providing insight into the evolution of blood feeding by arthropods, for their possible use as vaccine targets to
suppress ticks or the diseases they transmit, and for presenting a platform of novel pharmacologically active
compounds.
Eight years ago, a pioneer salivary transcriptome analysis of the metastriate tick A. variegatum was performed following the sequencing of near 4,000 salivary
cDNA clones from blood-feeding adult ticks [13]. In the
same year, transcriptome analysis of Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis [14] as well as of the
prostriate tick Ixodes scapularis [15] were performed.
These three papers represent a landmark in tick biology
by providing insights into their salivary composition. In
these last 8 years, there was progress in the number of
sialotranscriptomes (from the Greek sialo, saliva)
sequenced, including representative species of the soft
ticks, as well, as in the depth of their analysis. Many
unique tick families were thus identified and reviewed

[7,16]. We recently had the opportunity to collect A.
variegatum from cows in the cattle market of Kati, Mali,
a suburb of the capital city, Bamako. We separated the
SG homogenate by gel chromatography and performed
tryptic digest of protein bands, followed by mass spectroscopy (MS) analysis of these fragments. We re-analyzed data from Nene et al. [15], available at DBEST
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucest of the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), producing an annotated and hyperlinked spreadsheet containing new information related to unique tick proteins
unavailable in 2002. This database was used in conjunction with proteomic analysis to identify expressed peptides. We also submitted over 600 coding (protein)
sequences to GenBank, making these invaluable data
available in their non-redundant (NR) database, which
has only five sequences from A. variegatum as of June,
2010. Nucleotide sequence data reported are available in
the Third Party Annotation Section of the DDBJ/EMBL/
GenBank databases under the accession numbers TPA:
BK007105-BK007849.

transcripts, including Tigger/Pogo transposases. These
sequences may represent active transposition or, more
likely, the expression of regulatory sequences that might
suppress the DNA transposition phenomena [20], as
indicated by a Tigger transposase message containing a
stop codon (unigene amb_var-contig-1376).
Analysis of the A. variegatum sialotranscriptome

Several clusters of sequences coding for H and S polypeptides (indicated in Additional file 1) are abundant
and complete enough to extract consensus sequences
that are typically absent from either GenBank or Swissprot. This analysis provides over 700 coding
sequences, 605 of which have been submitted to GenBank through the third-party annotation system. It is
to be noted that as of July, 2010, there were only five
protein sequences for A. variegatum deposited in GenBank. These extracted sequences were grouped
together in Additional file 2. A detailed description of
the sialotranscriptome of A. variegatum follows to
serve as a guide to browsing the two additional files.
These two files are crosslinked to the TIGR GeneID
assembly and annotation.

cDNA library characteristics

A total of 3,985 clones from the original SG cDNA
library of A. variegatum was assembled using a combination BLAST and CAP3 pipeline [17], producing 2,077
NR sequences, or unigenes, 1,588 of which are singlets;
the remaining contigs were assembled from 2 to 161
expressed tag sequences (ESTs). This assembly compares well with the TIGR assembly [13], which generated 2,109 unigenes with 1,631 singlets.
Based on various BLAST sequence comparisons to several databases (see Methods and Additional file 1), these
unigenes were functionally characterized into the following groups: Putative secreted (S), putative housekeeping
(H), transposable element-derived (TE), and of unknown
class (U), because they could not be classified (some of
which may derive from untranslated regions of mRNAs)
(Table 1). Thirty-two percent of ESTs belonged to the S
class, smaller than other sialomes of insects and prostriate ticks (which are ~50% of the total ESTs) but similar
to metastriate sialomes of Rhipicephalus sanguineus,
which had only 26% of its salivary ESTs attributed to the
S class [18]. The S class was further subdivided in groups
according to a previous tick salivary classification [7].
The H class was further characterized (again based on
similarities to various databases, in particular the KOG
and Gene Ontology [GO] databases) into 20 functional
groups (Table 1), the unknown conserved class being
the most prevalent [19].
Transposable element (TE) sequences are commonly
found in sialotranscriptome. The sialotranscriptome of
A. variegatum revealed both TE class I and class II

Possibly secreted (S) class of expressed genes

This analysis is organized according to the groups of
proteins indicated in our previous review [7].
Group 1: Glycine-rich superfamily

This group of proteins represent the largest group of
salivary ESTs from A. variegatum (Table 1 and Additional file 1), totalling 749 ESTs and 56 unigenes from
which 44 coding sequences (CDS) were extracted (Additional file 2). The saliva of metastriate ticks is rich in
glycine-rich proteins–many of which resemble spider
filaments and mostly probably function in tick attachment to their hosts–and have been targets of anti-tick
vaccines [21-24]. This group also includes smaller peptides, some of which are rich in glycine and tyrosine
and resemble nematode antimicrobial peptides [25].
Group 2: Mucins

Under this class we include diverse serine + threoninerich secreted proteins that have in common a large
number of potential O-N-acetylgalactosylation sites as
identified by the NetOGlyc server [26] and can thus can
be categorized as mucins. Such proteins have been regularly found in sialotranscriptomes of insects and ticks,
where they are postulated to help maintain the insect
mouthparts in addition to other possible functions. Ten
such proteins are described in Additional file 2, including members with a chitin-binding domain.
Group 3: Antigen 5 proteins

The CAP superfamily of proteins (comprising the
CRISP, Antigen-5, and pathogen-related-1 families) has
been found in most sialotranscriptomes of insects and

ticks studied to date in the form of proteins similar to
wasp-venom proteins and annotated as antigen-5 [27].
The functions of these proteins are very diverse, being
associated with toxins in snake venoms, [28], proteolytic
activity in snails [29], and immunoglobulin binding in
salivary proteins of the stable fly [30]. For example, a
member of this family expressed in tabanid SGs contains a disintegrin (RGD) domain and functions as a platelet aggregation inhibitor [31,32]. To date, no tick
salivary members of this family have been functionally
characterized. A 3’ truncated CDS for a member of this
family is shown in Additional file 2.

Members of this family have 110-120 amino acids (aa),
many of which have the disintegrin Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)
domain with nearby cysteine residues, a motif associated
with disruption of fibrinogen binding to platelets [33].
The A. variegatum protein named Amb_var-991 has
similarities to I. scapularis ixodegrins, but it does not
have the RGD domain. Amb_var-991 is also similar to
proteins annotated as astakine, which are related to the
growth factor prokineticin, which is important for
hematopoiesis [34,35].

Kunitz domain-containing proteins The Kunitz
domain is associated with proteins containing serine
protease inhibitor activity as well as channel blockers. A
single Kunitz domain protein from R. appendiculatus
was identified as a potassium channel blocker, [36]
while dual and five Kunitz domain proteins from I. scapularis were identified as clotting inhibitors by acting
on the tissue factor pathway [37,38]. Additional file 2
presents 11 CDS for Kunitz domain-containing proteins
from A. variegatum including Amb_var-163, with four
Kunitz domains, and Amb_var-1788, Amb_var-68,
Amb_var-995, and Amb_var-69 with three domains, as
indicated by the KU Smart motif.
Serpins Serpins are a ubiquitous protein family associated with the function of serine protease inhibition,
from which the family name derives. A. variegatum serpins were identified in the original 2002 sialome publication. Four truncated CDS are presented in Additional file
2. A single tick salivary serpin from I. ricinus has been
shown to inhibit vertebrate elastase and to have immunosuppressive activity [39,40]. Another salivary serpin from
the same tick inhibits cathepsin G and chymase [41].
Tick serpins have been proposed as anti-tick salivary vaccines, including non-salivary expressed serpins [42,43].
Cystatins Cystatins are cysteinyl protease inhibitors of
nearly 100 aa in length. Two salivary cystatins from I.
scapularis have been functionally characterized as inhibitors of cathepsins L and S, to inhibit inflammation,
suppress dendritic cell maturation, and serve as vaccine

targets [44-46]. A 3’ truncated member of this family is
available in Additional file 2.
Thyropins Thyropins are motifs found in thyroglobulins
and in cysteine protease inhibitors of the actiniamderived equistatin protein [47-49]. Equistatin itself has
three thyropin domains, two of which were shown to be
involved in protease inhibition [49]. Two thyropin
domains are discernible in Amb_var-355 (Additional file
2). No functional analysis of any tick thyropin has been
done to date.
Trypsin inhibitor-like (TIL) domain-containing proteins The TIL domain is found in some serine protease
inhibitors and antimicrobials [50]. Peptides of this family
have been isolated from tick eggs and shown to be inhibitors of elastase and subtilisin and to have antifungal
activity [51]. The CDS of Amb_var-204 represents a salivary member of this family found in A. variegatum.
Hirudin/Madanin/Variegin superfamily This is a
superfamily found only in metastriate ticks [7] and
includes the previously described peptide variegin from
A. variegatum, shown to have antithrombin activity [52];
it also contains madanin, an antithrombin from the tick
Haemaphysalis longicornis [53,54], and a related protein
from A. variegatum deposited in GenBank in 2004
(accession number BAD29729.1). Additional file 2 presents three additional members of this hirudin-like protein family, characterizing its possible multigene status
within A. variegatum.
Basic tail and 18.3-kDa superfamily The basic tail and
18.3-kDa superfamily was first recognized in I. scapularis,
where many members have repeats of basic aa in their
carboxytermini. Other members have an acidic tail, and
others lack the charged tail but can be recognized by the
PFAM domain named tick salivary peptide group 1. The
I. scapularis 18.3-kDa family was found by PSI-BLAST to
be related to the basic tail family. Two members of this
family in I. scapularis have been characterized as anticlotting agents [55,56]. Additional file 2 introduces the
CDS for four members of this family from A. variegatum.

Page 4 of 11

[7]. Amb_var-1080 represents an A. variegatum member
of the family.
Group 11: 12-kDa polypeptide family

This is another protein family exclusive of hard and soft
ticks, previously found only in I. scapularis, Ornithodoros coriaceus, and Ornithodoros. moubata [7]. Three
members from A. variegatum are shown in Additional
file 2, expanding the members of this unique family.
Alignment of the tick sequences allows for a bootstrapped phylogram indicating strong bootstrap support
for two clades (Figure 1).
Group 14: Cytotoxin-like family

Thus far, the cytotoxin-like protein family has been
found only in the Ixodes genus and in soft ticks. Two
additional proteins from A. variegatum add metastriate
proteins to this unique tick family.
Group 16: Enzymes

Some of the enzymes listed below could serve an H
function, but are related to enzymes previously found
secreted and thus are described in the S group.
Apyrase/5’ nucleotidases

Apyrases are enzymes that hydrolyze tri- and di-phosphonucleotides to their monophosphate esters plus inorganic phosphate. They are commonly found in the saliva
of blood-sucking arthropods, where they degrade ATP
and ADP, important agonists of neutrophil [64,65] and
platelet aggregation [66]. The salivary apyrase of mosquitoes, triatomines of the genus Triatoma and ticks
have been identified as members of the 5’-nucleotidase
family [67-71]. While most members of the 5’ nucleotidase family are membrane-bound ectoenzymes by virtue
of a glycosylinositol lipid anchor, the secreted apyrases
lack the carboxyterminus region where the anchor is

Group 7: Lipocalins

Lipocalins are ubiquitous proteins characterized by a
barrel shape that often carries lipophylic compounds
(lipocalin literally means lipid cup). In blood-sucking
insects and ticks, lipocalins bind not only lipidic compounds, such as leukotrienes and thromboxane A 2
[57-59], but also charged agonists of inflammation, such
as serotonin and histamine [57,60,61]. Lipocalins can
also have functions unrelated to their small molecule
binding function, such as anticlotting [62] and anticomplement function [63]. Seven CDS for A. variegatum
lipocalins are presented in Additional file 2.
Group 8: 8.9-kDa polypeptide family

The 8.9-kDa polypeptide family is exclusive to hard
ticks, 60 members of which were described previously

Figure 1 Bootstrapped phylogram of the 12 kDa family of tick
proteins. Amblyomma variegatum proteins are recognized by their
Amb_var or Ambvar prefix. The remaining sequences were obtained
from GenBank and have six letters (three from the genus and three
from the species name) followed by their NCBI accession number.
The numbers near the branches indicate the percentage bootstrap
support. The bar at the bottom indicates 10% amino acid
divergence.

located. Amb_var-450 (Additional file 2) is a 3’ truncated member of this family, and for this reason, the
lack of the anchor site cannot be evaluated.
Endonucleases

Endonucleases were found in saliva of Culex and sand
flies, where they may serve a function in decreasing the
viscosity of the feeding lesion and produce antiinflammatory nucleotides [72-74]. Three truncated members of
this family of enzymes are presented in Additional file 2.
Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases

Sphingomyelin metabolites are important regulators of
cell growth, inflammation, and immunity [75,76]. A
fragment of an enzyme-targeting sphingomyelin is
identified.
Epoxide hydrolases

Two truncated members of this family of enzymes were
found that could act in the metabolism of arachidonate
metabolites.

metastriate tick proteins. Amblyomma variegatum proteins are
recognized by their Amb_var or AMBVAR prefix. The remaining
sequences were obtained from GenBank and have six letters (three
from the genus and three from the species name) followed by their
NCBI accession number. The numbers near the branches indicate
the percentage bootstrap support (values below 50% are not
shown). The bar at the bottom indicates 20% amino acid
divergence. Bootstrap was performed with 1000 iterations.

Oxidant metabolism enzymes

A peroxidasin fragment, a superoxide dismutase, and
two selenoproteins are reported in Additional file 2.
These proteins have the potential to regulate the toxic
products of oxygen and nitric oxide [77,78].
Proteases

Carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, metalloproteases of the reprolysin family, and trypsin-like serine
proteases are presented in Additional file 2. Carboxypeptidases and dipeptidyl peptidases could act in the
destruction of inflammatory peptidic agonists. In fact, a
dipeptidyl peptidase was shown to be responsible for the
very fast bradykinin degradation caused by I. scapularis
saliva [79]. Metalloproteases in the saliva of I. scapularis
were shown to be responsible for the fibri(noge)nolytic
activity [80]. Salivary serine proteases have been shown
to have fibrinolytic activities in horse flies [31].
Group 17: Immunity related

A member of the ficolin family, named ixoderin in ticks
[81], is identified. These proteins have a lectin and a
fibrinogen-like domain and are associated with activation of the colectin pathway of complement activation
in vertebrates and invertebrates [82].
Group 18: Metastriate-specific families

Several protein families found only in metastriate ticks
were identified in our previous review of tick sialomes
[7]. Seven of these families were also found in the A.
variegatum sialome, including three multigene families
that appear to be unique to A. variegatum, as follows:
Da-p36 immunosuppressant The first member of this
family was described as an immunosuppressant found in
the SGs of Dermacentor andersoni [83]. The A. variegatum sialome reveals four members of this family, one of
which was reported in Figure 2 of the original 2002
paper [13]. One additional sequence from A. variegatum
was deposited in GenBank in 2004 (accession number

BAD11807.1), but has no associated publication. Alignment of the related sequences (not shown) reveals one
small conserved region characterized by the block [ILF]x(3)-[IMLF]-x-[SCA]-P-[FM]-x(4)-[NT]-[VLIFM]-x[ILFV], indicating the divergence of the family. The
bootstrapped phylogram shows strong support for one
clade containing Amblyomma, Dermacentor, and Rhipicephalus sequences (Figure 2). Other clades do not have
sufficient bootstrap support (>50%), except for two A.
variegatum sequences that are over 20% divergent. The
phylogram supports a common origin of this multigene
family in metastriate ticks.
Metastriate insulin growth factor-binding protein
This protein family was discovered from the assembly of
ESTs from ticks, as described in a previous review [7].
Members of this family produce matches to GO proteins
annotated as “insulin-like growth factor binding protein
7” and have the IB SMART domain for “insulin growth
factor-binding protein homologues.” This family actually
has two sets. A shorter form contains only the IB domain
(Figure 3A), while the longer form has, in addition of the
IB domain, a Kazal domain and the SMART immunoglobulin C-2 type domain (Figure 3B). Alignment of all IBcontaining proteins (Figure 3A) shows the conserved IB
domain motif in the amino terminal end of the mature
protein, indicated by the block PA C-x(12,13)-[EQD]-C-x
(2)-G-x(5)-C-G-C-C-x(2)-C-x(5)-[EQD]-x-PA C-x(7,13)C-x-[EK]-x(3)-C. Alignment of the long-form sequences
shows three very conserved proteins in Rhipicephalus
microplus, R. appendiculatus, and A. variegatum, containing a signal peptide followed by the IB, Kazal, and
immunoglobulin domains (Figure 3B). This degree of
conservation is more common among housekeeping proteins, as they are not under host immune pressure. Proteins containing these three domains are characterized by

the InterPro insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/ISpy?ac=Q16270. The
human homolog having this domain structure (GenBank
accession number NP_001544.1), named MC25 or
IGFBP7, has many effects in tissue growth and differentiation [84,85], It has also been shown to inhibit vascular

endothelial growth factor and keratinocyte growth
[86,87]. If any of these proteins are secreted, they could
serve as binders of growth factors affecting angiogenesis,
tissue repair, and immunity.
A. variegatum-specific proteins Additional file 2 contains two families of proteins that appear to be species

specific, namely the Avar family10 kDa (three genes)
and Avar family 8 kDa (two genes). Within each family,
the members are less than 50% identical, indicating gene
duplication events followed by divergence. Additional
file 2 presents 79 additional protein sequences that have
a putative signal peptide indicative of secretion but have
no similarity to any known protein, including the
recently released I. scapularis proteome. It is possible
that some of these CDS may derive from the 3’ region
of transporters or other transmembrane proteins, as
these regions may produce a positive signal peptide.
A. variegatum proteins not found in previous sialotranscriptome, but similar to putative I. scapularis
proteins Additional file 2 contains 13 proteins from A.
variegatum that are similar to I. scapularis proteins but
have not been found in previous sialomes. Some of
these are proline-rich, low-complexity proteins or histidine-rich proteins.
Group 21: Secreted conserved proteins

Forty-five proteins with signal peptide indicative of secretion are presented in Additional file 2. Most of these are
of the class “Unknown conserved” [19] but also include
calreticulin, which has a typical KHEEL carboxydomain
indicative of endoplasmic reticulum retention but was
shown to be a marker of tick exposure [88].
Group 22: Housekeeping proteins

Additional file 2 presents 414 CDS for proteins associated with various cellular functions. Additionally, 40 of
the unknown conserved and 3 transposable element
fragments were extracted.
Preliminary characterization of the salivary proteome of
A. variegatum

To obtain information on protein expression in the SGs
of A. variegatum, we performed a one dimensional (1D)
gel electrophoresis separation of the SG homogenate followed by proteolytic digest of the 25 cored sections indicated in Figure 4 and subsequent tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) of the tryptic peptides. Additional
files 1 and 2 show the matching sequence hits obtained
by MS/MS. A total of 170 proteins were identified in the
gel fractions by two or more ions derived from the same
gel fraction. An additional 39 proteins were identified
from a single ion on the same spot. These matches are
shown in the worksheet named Gel-MS-MS results in
Additional file 2. Figure 4 displays the electrophoresis
gel, indicating 19 proteins associated with blood feeding.
These include large and small glycine-rich proteins, the
most abundant group found in the transcriptome and by
MS. Reprolysin-type metalloprotease and dipeptidyl peptidase are found in band 8, with their expected molecular
masses (just above the 66-kDa marker). Calreticulin, citotoxin-like protein, one lipocalin, and four hypothetical
secreted proteins are also shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis of salivary gland homogenate of Amblyomma
variegatum. Lane A shows molecular mass markers, with their
masses indicated in column MW. Lane B represents the tick sample.
The grid at the right indicates how the gel was cut for tryptic
digest of the peptides, and the two-letter-number code indicates
the putative secreted proteins identified at the gel bands. The twoletter codes stand for: GR, glycine-rich protein; MT, metalloprotease;
DP, dipeptidyl peptidase; CR, calreticulin; HP, hypothetical protein;
CT, cytotoxin-like; and LP, lipocalin. The numbers indicate the
Amb_var protein number available in Supplemental Table S2.

Conclusions
The detailed re-analysis of the transcriptome of A. variegatum, in light of the emerging pattern of protein
families in tick sialomes, extends and confirms common
components in the saliva, such as the recruitment of
metalloproteases, protease inhibitors, lipocalins, and several other unique families–such as the 8.9-kDa, 11-12kDa, and cytotoxin-like–common to metastriate and
prostriate ticks. A. variegatum also has a large set of
transcripts coding for cement-like proteins unique to
metastriate ticks. In parallel with this transcript abundance, glycine-rich proteins were the largest group of
proteins identified by proteomics, when secreted proteins are considered. Other unique metastriate protein
families were identified, including some that appear to
be multigenic and also unique to A. variegatum such as
the Avar 10-kDa and Avar 8-kDa families. Many orphan
proteins were further characterized. Further transcriptome analysis of other Amblyomma ticks may reveal
relatives of these unique proteins.
Most of the proteins described have no known function but, if secreted into their hosts, they should have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/136

antihemostatic, antiinflammatory, anti-angiogenic, or
immunomodulatory function. They may also contain
antimicrobial activity. As the sialome puzzle emerges,
the task of functional characterization of these novel
protein families becomes possible.

Methods
Biological material

Female A. variegatum ticks were obtained from zebu
cattle (Bos primigenius indicus) at a market located in
the village of Kati, located approximately 30 km north
of Bamako, the capital of Mali (12°44’48.03"N, 8°
04’17.09"W). The ticks were briefly washed in 70% ethanol and then air dried. The tick was secured to a glass
slide using double-sided tape, and then one horizontal
and two lateral cuts were made with a sterile scalpel to
disconnect the SGs from the spiracles connecting them
to the feeding duct and spiracular plate. The dorsal
plate was then removed, exposing the midgut, SGs, and
other organs. The SGs were teased away from other
organs using ultra-fine forceps (#5, Bioquip) in a bath of
1 × PBS. The dissected SGs were washed in 1 × PBS
before being stored in PBS. The tick carcasses were
retained in 70% ethanol and submitted as voucher specimens for identification by Dmitry A. Apanaskevich,
assistant curator at the United States National Tick Collection at Georgia Southern University.

case of complete coding sequences, were submitted to
the SignalP server [100] to help identify translation products that could be secreted. O-glycosylation sites on
the proteins were predicted with the program NetOGlyc
[26]. Functional annotation of the transcripts was based
on all the comparisons above.
When attempting identification of multigene families,
we attributed transcripts coding for proteins that were
more than 10% different in their primary aa sequence to
derive from different genes. The reader should be aware
that products divergent more than 10% could be alleles
of polymorphic genes.
Gel electrophoresis studies

Tick salivary proteins representing approximately 100 μg
were resolved by one-dimensional (1D) sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4-12% gradient gels) and visualized with Coomassie blue staining
(Pierce). Excised gel bands were destained using 50%
acetonitrile in 25 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, and vacuum
dried. Trypsin (20 μg/mL in 25 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.4)
was added and the mixture was incubated on ice for
one h. The supernatant was removed and the gel bands
were covered with 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , pH 8.4. After
overnight incubation at 37°C, the tryptic peptides were
extracted using 70% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid, and
the peptide solution was lyophilized and desalted using
ZipTips (Millipore).

Bioinformatic tools and procedures used

ESTs from the SGs of adult female A. variegatum
deposited in DBEST as part of a previous publication
[13] were retrieved and assembled in our assembly pipeline. The BLAST tool [89] and the CAP3 assembler [90]
were used to assemble the database as well as to compare it to other databases and pipe the results into a
hyperlinked Excel spreadsheet, as described in the dCAS
software tool [17]. ClustalW [91] and TreeView software
[92] were used to align sequences and visualize alignments. Phylogenetic analysis and statistical neighborjoining bootstrap tests of the phylogenies were done
with the Mega package [93]. For functional annotation
of the transcripts, we used the tool blastx [94] to compare the nucleotide sequences to the NR protein database of the NCBI and to the GO database [95]. The tool
rpsblast [94] was used to search for conserved protein
domains in the Pfam [96], SMART [97], Kog [98], and
Conserved Domains Databases (CDD) [99]. We have
also compared the transcripts with other subsets of
mitochondrial and rRNA nucleotide sequences downloaded from NCBI. Segments of the three-frame translations of the EST (because the libraries were
unidirectional, we did not use six-frame translations),
starting with a methionine found in the first 100 predicted aa, or to the predicted protein translation in the

Nanoflow reverse-phase liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (nanoRPLC-MS/MS)

Tryptic peptides were analyzed using nanoRPLC-MS/
MS. A 75-μm i.d. × 360-μm o.d. × 10-cm long fused
silica capillary column (Polymicro Technologies) was
packed with 3 μμm, 300 Å pore size C-18 silicabonded stationary RP particles (Vydac). The column
was connected to an Agilent 1100 nanoLC system
(Agilent Technologies) that was coupled online with a
linear ion-trap mass spectrometer (LTQ; ThermoElectron). Peptides were separated using a gradient consisting of mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and
B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The peptide samples were injected, and gradient elution was performed
under the following conditions: 2% B at 500 nL/min
for 30 min; a linear increase of 2-42% B at 250 nL/min
for 110 min; 42-98% for 30 min including the first 15
min at 250 nL/min and then 15 min at 500 nL/min;
98% at 500 nL/min for 10 min. The linear ion-trap
mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent
tandem MS (MS/MS) mode in which the five most
abundant peptide molecular ions in every MS scan
were selected for collision-induced dissociation using a
normalized collision energy of 35%. Dynamic exclusion
was applied to minimize repeated selection of

Ribeiro et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:136

previously analyzed peptides. The capillary temperature
and electrospray voltage were set to 160°C and 1.5 kV,
respectively. Tandem MS spectra from the nanoRPLCMS/MS analyses were searched against a protein fasta
database derived from the tick transcriptome using
SEQUEST operating on an 18-node Beowulf cluster.
For a peptide to be considered legitimately identified,
it had to achieve stringent charge state and proteolytic
cleavage-dependent cross correlation (X corr ) and a
minimum correlation (ΔCn) score of 0.08.
MS results were mapped to the Excel spreadsheets
using a homemade program. The following example
illustrates the convention for interpreting the data: The
hit Band7 ® 6 indicates that a particular protein had
six MS/MS peptide hits in gel fraction 7. Additional columns indicate the number of residues covered in aa
residues and percent of total protein that was covered
by the procedure.
