Abstract
Background: The ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) genes encode a highly-conserved eukaryotic set of
nucleolar proteins involved in rRNA transcription, assembly, processing, and export from the
nucleus. While the mode of regulation of this suite of genes has been studied in the yeast,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, how this gene set is coordinately regulated in the larger and more
complex metazoan genomes is not understood.
Results: Here we present genome-wide analyses indicating that a distinct mode of RiBi regulation
co-evolved with the E(CG)-binding, Myc:Max bHLH heterodimer complex in a stem-holozoan, the
ancestor of both Metazoa and Choanoflagellata, the protozoan group most closely related to
animals. These results show that this mode of regulation, characterized by an E(CG)-bearing corepromoter, is specific to almost all of the known genes involved in ribosome biogenesis in these
genomes. Interestingly, this holozoan RiBi promoter signature is absent in nematode genomes,
which have not only secondarily lost Myc but are marked by invariant cell lineages typically
producing small body plans of 1000 somatic cells. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of 10 fungal
genomes shows that this holozoan signature in RiBi genes is not found in hemiascomycete fungi,
which evolved their own unique regulatory signature for the RiBi regulon.
Conclusion: These results indicate that a Myc regulon, which is activated in proliferating cells
during normal development as well as during tumor progression, has primordial roots in the
evolution of an inducible growth regime in a protozoan ancestor of animals. Furthermore, by
comparing divergent bHLH repertoires, we conclude that regulation by Myc but not by other
bHLH genes is responsible for the evolutionary maintenance of E(CG) sites across the RiBi suite
of genes.

Background
Ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) is a primary function of the
nucleolus [1-3]. In the nucleolus, rRNA molecules are synthesized as precursors by DNA-directed RNA Pol I and Pol
III. Nascent rRNAs then undergo extensive chemical modifications and RNA cleavage reactions. Numerous RiBi

proteins are involved both in this enzymatic processing as
well in assisting with proper rRNA folding to produce
functional ribosomal subunits [1]. Synthesizing functional ribosomes requires immense coordination because
gene products from all three DNA-dependent RNA
polymerases are required to ensure proper stoichiometry

of ribosomal components. This level of co-regulation is
likely to be controlled through a highly-specific DNA signature as seen in other gene regulatory systems [4]. Such a
signature would allow the appropriate factors to co-ordinately regulate the RiBi genes as a distinct regulon. For
example, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae two important regulatory motifs consisting of the PAC (polymerase
A and C) and RRPE (Ribosomal RNA Processing Element)
motifs have been identified in RiBi genes [5-7]. In animals
no known factor or motif is known to coordinate the
entire RiBi set. However, the metazoan transcription factor Myc has been found to target at least some RiBi genes.
Myc is a bHLH DNA-binding protein present in animals
where it plays an important role in cell growth and proliferation by regulating gene expression during development
and tumorigenesis [8-10]. Myc functions by heterodimerizing with its obligate partner Max to bind the sequence
5'-CACGTG [a CG-core E-box, or E(CG)] and transactivate
target genes [11-14]. Previous studies have implicated the
Myc transcription factor in rRNA transcription [15-17],
but the possibility that Myc could directly regulate the
hundreds of gene products involved in RiBi, as opposed to
a few early genes or key steps [18-20], has not been investigated. Also unknown is when such an RiBi circuit or
other non-RiBi targets of Myc may have evolved and
whether it was in the most recent common ancestor of
Bilateria (protostomes and deuterostomes), Metazoa
(animals), Holozoa (Metazoa + choanoflagellates),
Opisthokonta (Holozoa + fungi), or Eukaryota.
Here, we use a multi-genomic approach to show that the
vast majority of genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis
are associated with E(CG)-bearing core promoters in all
holozoan genomes containing Myc, and thus constitutes
a uniquely holozoan RiBi regulon. Max, Mad, and Mnt, all
members of the Myc bHLH superfamily, are all either
insufficient or dispensable in explaining the correlation of
E(CG) with RiBi as revealed by a comparison of multiple
eukaryotic genomes, which differ in their bHLH repertoires. Thus, in addition to known RiBi targets of Myc [1820] and the similar growth defects of both RiBi and myc
mutant alleles [8-10,18,20,21], our comparative genomic
results suggest that the characteristic RiBi E(CG) core promoter architecture co-evolved with a proto-Myc:Max complex in a unicellular holozoan ancestor. This is consistent
with the metabolic evolution of a unique, Myc-Max regulated, RiBi growth signalling pathway in an ancient unicellular heterotroph.

Results and discussion
Overall approach
To gain insight into the regulatory control of Ribosome
Biogenesis (RiBi) in animals, we first wanted to character-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/442

ize a co-regulated RiBi gene set definable by a shared regulatory signature, a component of which would be the
Myc-Max binding site E(CG). A priori, we had no reason to
expect whether a common regulatory signature would be
found across the large number of known ribosome biogenesis genes or whether such a signature would be limited to only a subset (i.e. the sensitivity of the postulated
signature for RiBi genes). Furthermore, we set no expectation on whether this signature would necessarily be
present or absent in other non-RiBi genes devoted to cell
growth or other functions (i.e. the specificity of the postulated signature for RiBi genes). For this purpose, we chose
the Drosophila melanogaster genome because of its relatively compact size and absence of genome wide duplications characteristic of vertebrates. Both of these properties
facilitate the identification of a sequence signature and the
characterization of its sensitivity and specificity for entire
biological functions because they simplify the ability to
conduct and interpret computational queries of genome
sequence.
Having identified the list of genes in this fly regulon we
would then utilize the many available eukaryotic genome
sequences to identify shared sequence signatures associated with this regulon in each genome. Because of the
highly conserved nature of the protein functions associated with ribosome biogenesis, it is likely that this list of
genes would remain co-regulated in other genomes
despite evolution of the regulatory signatures associated
with this regulon.
E(CG) is highly specific to the fly RiBi regulon
An overwhelming majority of confirmed Myc targets contain E(CG) near the transcriptional start site (TSS) [19].
We therefore examined all fly genes with promoter proximal E(CG) sites to determine whether they were related by
a common cellular function. We searched the Drosophila
melanogaster genome and identified only 390 promoter
sequences containing an E(CG) site in the core promoter
region (160 bp centered around +1) out of 20,468 annotated transcripts (14,752 genes). Remarkably, these genes
include most proteins known to be involved throughout
ribosome biogenesis [see Additional file 1]. To examine
the relationship between the E(CG) motif and ribosome
biogenesis in more detail, we used Gene Ontology (GO)
classification of the yeast genome to map 121 fly
orthologs of yeast nucleolar genes. Of these, ~75% possess E(CG), indicating that the majority are under control
of a common regulatory motif in Drosophila [see Additional file 1]. As explained below, many additional fly
E(CG)-bearing genes, which are not conserved as
orthologs in yeast, are likely to be related to ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, as detailed by multiple statistical
tests conducted in this study, the rate of E(CG) motifs in

the Drosophila RiBi gene promoters is significantly elevated relative to promoters of genes not known to be
involved in nucleolar functions and/or ribosome biogenesis.
E(CG)-bearing, RiBi-type promoters are unique
Any examination restricted to gene orthologs precludes
the identification of genes not conforming to a 1-to-1
orthology. To this end, it would be ideal to search the
entire genome to provide a comprehensive analysis of the
entire E(CG) fly RiBi regulon. This method could identify
novel fly RiBi genes harboring E(CG) sites independent of
a 1-to-1 orthology and ambiguous annotations of transcriptional initiation sites. To carry out this whole genome
query, we first searched for additional motifs that comprised the full core promoter context of RiBi genes. With
additional motifs in hand, highly specific whole genome
queries for promoter-linked E(CG) sites could be
achieved, thereby identifying a more complete RiBi regulon.

Myc's known co-localization to core promoters [16] suggests it may define or associate with a distinct core promoter architecture. We therefore looked for novel
elements that may be specific to RiBi promoters but infrequent across other promoters. We also investigated
whether promoters bearing E(CG) are associated with
specific core promoter elements such as TATA-boxes, Initiator sequences, downstream promoter elements (DPEs),
and other common motifs [22]. As detailed below, these
results support the idea that the fly RiBi-type promoter,
uniquely characterized by the E(CG) site, defines a distinctive and highly specific promoter architecture, which
is useful in identifying this gene set in Drosophila.
By searching for novel motifs, we first noted that the
flanks of the E(CG) site often match an extended consensus MAACACGTGYG (M = A/C, Y = C/T). Three out of
every four core promoters that contain this extended
E(CG) consensus map to RiBi genes (Fig. 1A). As a negative control for the specificity of the flanking sequence, we
also searched the entire genome with an E(CG) motif in
which the flanking pattern was maximally divergent from
the observed, RiBi-specific, CG-core E-box flanking pattern. This "anti-flank" E(CG) motif, KKYCACGTGRMK (K
= G/T, R = A/G), maps to almost 3-fold more sites than the
extended E(CG) consensus, but nonetheless is absent
from the core promoters of known nucleolar or RiBi
orthologs (data not shown).
We also identified sequences corresponding to the DRE
core promoter element, 5'-CTATCGATA, as previously
reported [23]. DRE (DNA-replication element) binds
DREF (DRE factor) and is associated with promoters
involved in DNA replication [24]. We observe a cluster of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/442

DRE sites in many RiBi gene promoters, where it occurs
immediately upstream of E(CG) (Fig. 1A). When the fly
genome is queried for regions containing at least 2 DRE
motifs and an E(CG) within an 80 bp window, this highly
specific signature identifies 126 loci in the genome. Over
half of these are known to be associated with RiBi [see
Additional file 1]. Tellingly, DRE motifs are not associated
with E(CG) sites containing the anti-flank sequence (i.e.
KKYCACGTGRMK).
This analysis provides enough information to distinguish
most core-promoter linked E(CG) sites from the majority
of ~15,000 E(CG) sites that lie outside of promoter
regions and likely represent random background occurrences. We queried the entire Drosophila genome for the
different E(CG)-type core promoter signatures [E(CG) +
flanks, or E(CG) + DRE, or E(CG) + mapped 5'-end]. The
largest functional group of genes identified across the
genome is the RiBi gene set (151/321 genes; Fig. 1). These
genes are involved at all steps of ribosomal processing
including factors involved in rRNA transcription (11
genes), snoRNA processing (3 genes), snoRNPs (12
genes), 90S particles (30 genes), pre-60S particles (48
genes), 40S particles (15 genes), ribosome structure (19
genes), unknown steps in ribosome biogenesis (10
genes), and unknown functions of the nucleolus (3
genes). Some of these RiBi genes have previously been
implicated as potential direct or indirect Myc targets
[16,18,19,23]. Some genes encode products that are only
known to be localized to the nucleolus (e.g. spermidine
synthase) [16]. Others participate in tRNA modification
in addition to rRNA modification [25,26]. Altogether
these results support the hypothesis that the many RiBi
genes are co-regulated and identifiable through a specific
E(CG)-bearing promoter architecture.
Characterization of the RiBi regulon across Eukaryota
To determine the evolutionary origins of the RiBi regulon,
we first measured the conservation of E(CG) motifs in the
RiBi genes of other bilaterian genomes, including humans
and nematodes. Of the human RiBi genes, 77%, possess
an E(CG) in a window Â± 600 bp from the 5' annotated
end, which is a significantly elevated compared to the
~20% background level in control promoters (Fig. 2;
Table 1). In contrast with humans, there is no elevated
level of E(CG) in RiBi genes in the nematode genome of
C. elegans despite the conservation of such genes (Fig. 2).
The presence of an E(CG)-RiBi signature in both a deuterostome (humans) and a protostome (flies) suggests that
the absence in another protostome (nematodes) is a secondary loss.

To test whether components of the fly RiBi regulon are
conserved outside of Bilateria, we analyzed the presence
of the E(CG) signature in the RiBi orthologous cohort in

E(CG) is1a core promoter element of Drosophila ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) genes
E(CG) is a core promoter element of Drosophila ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) genes. (A) Fly RiBi genes (5 examples
shown) generally possess three common features around the transcriptional start site (rightward pointing arrow) and
upstream of the translational start (ATG). This distinct promoter architecture is characterized by a CG-core E-box (blue box),
a specific E(CG) flanking motif (green box) and a coordinating cluster of sites matching the DNA Replication Element, DRE,
(red boxes) spanning a distance less than 100 bp. The distance of E(CG) to the TSS for each gene is indicated above E(CG).
G6375 corresponds to the pit gene, which is a known Myc target and an RiBi gene [18]. (B) This core promoter architecture
identifies several functional groups of genes associated with RiBi (green circles). The number of genes is indicated for functional
groups with more than 3 members. The sum of 151 genes (large circle) is the sum of all of the individual subfunctions with specific roles in Ribosome Biogenesis. The RiBi genes encode a variety of domains and protein folds including RNA-binding regions
(RNP-1), C-terminal helicases, DEAD/DEAH box helicases, WD-40 repeats, ARM repeats, Histone-folds, AAA ATPases and
many others [see Additional file 1]. (C) The results of genome queries in Drosophila for E(CG) type core promoters results in
a highly significant enrichment of GO terms directly related to ribosome biogenesis (nucleolar, rRNA metabolism, rRNA binding, snoRNA complex, pseudouridine synthesis, ribosomal subunits, etc.)

the genomes of more distantly-related organisms (Figs. 2
and 3). For a metazoan outgroup to Bilateria, we used the
cnidarian genome of Nematostella vectensis [27]. For a
holozoan outgroup to Metazoa, we used the choanoflagellate genome of Monosiga brevicollis [28]. For an
opisthokont out-group to Holozoa, we used the baker's
yeast genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

We identified all of the RiBi orthologs between the fly,
human, and yeast genomes and their apparent orthologs
in the Nematostella and Monosiga genomes and were able
to find at least 100 such genes in each genome. We found
that each holozoan genome (except C. elegans) possesses
E(CG) sites across ~50% to 90% of its identifiable RiBi
genes in the region Â± 600 bp from the 5'-most end (Fig. 2).

(A) A list of all human genes with orthologous fly genes containing an E(CG) tightly linked to the core promoter in both orthologs. These genes
have an E(CG) Â± 600 bp and Â± 80 bp from the transcriptional initiation site in the pair of human and fly orthologs, respectively. Genes with asterisks
are known to be involved in ribosome biogenesis. See Additional file 1 for a more exhaustive list of genes described in this study. (B) A list of all
human genes that have been evolutionarily maintained with E(CG)-bearing promoters across orthologous holozoan loci (humans, flies, cnidarians,
and choanoflagellates). These genes have an E(CG) Â± 600 bp from the annotated 5'-end in each genome. Missing from this list are genes that may be
E(CG)-bearing in a genome but are not yet annotated by full-length transcripts. Genes with asterisks are known to be involved in ribosome
biogenesis. See Additional file 1 for a more exhaustive list of genes described in this study.

This corresponds to a statistically significant (p < 0.001)
two-fold to four-fold elevated level of E(CG) relative to
the core promoter regions of adjacent control genes (C1 in
Fig. 2). As additional negative controls, we analyzed the
frequency of E(CG) in the region Â± 600 bp from the 3' end
of the same test genes (C2), or in the promoters of genes
with mitochondrial GO terms (CM). We again found no
enrichment over background (Fig. 2).
Importantly, we also failed to find elevated levels of
E(CG) in yeast RiBi versus control groups (C1 and CM in
Fig. 2). Of relevance, the yeast RiBi genes are known to be
regulated by motifs that are distinct from E(CG) [29-31].
We were also unable to find the E(CG)-RiBi signature in
other fungal and more distantly related eukaryotic
genomes (see Figs. 4, 5 and Methods).
Interestingly, there are a few fly E(CG)-bearing genes
whose orthologs are E(CG)-bearing across humans, cni-

darians, and choanoflagellates, but are not yet known to
be related to ribosome biogenesis (Table 1). One of these
is the vasa (DDX4) locus, which is an RNA-binding protein and metazoan germline determinant. This gene is
maintained as an E(CG)-bearing promoter in humans,
ascidians, flies, cnidarians, and choanoflagellates, but not
in the nematode C. elegans and could conceivably be
another DDX/DHX-containing RiBi gene, which was secondarily co-opted as a metazoan germline determinant.
Another corresponds to the Dph5 gene, which is involved
in the diphthamide modification of a histidine residue on
elongation factor 2 (EF2) [32,33]. Dph5 is possibly
required for frame-shift suppression during translation
[34], but could conceivably play a role in unknown ribosomal modifications.
In contrast to the highly conserved nature of the RiBi regulon across Holozoa, there is little evolutionary conservation of E(CG) sites for genes not known to be involved in

Holozoan RiBi promoters are enriched in E(CG) sites
Holozoan RiBi promoters are enriched in E(CG)
sites. The percentage of E(CG)-bearing promoters in RiBi
genes is two to four fold higher in D. melanogaster (Dm), H.
sapiens (Hs), N. vectensis (Nv), and M. brevicollis (Mb) relative
to negative control sequences composed of promoter
regions of downstream conserved genes (C1), the 3' regions
of RiBi genes (C2), or the promoters of genes with GO mitochondrial classification (CM). This difference between RiBi and
C1, C2, or CM is lacking in outgroup genomes such as S. cerevisiae (Sc), which lack Myc, as well as in the nematode genome
of C. elegans (Ce), which has secondarily lost Myc (Fig. 3).
Inset depicts phylogenetic relationships among these organisms.
RiBi [see Additional file 1]. This indicates that these fly
E(CG)-bearing genes, including some known Myc targets
in flies and/or humans [e.g. CAD [35] and TIMM10 [36]],
acquired the E(CG) site either in a stem bilaterian or in
subsequent independent occurrences. These sites could
also represent background noise due to sequence drift in
a particular lineage. Many of these genes have fly E(CG)
sites that are Â± 600 bp of the initiation site, but are not as
tightly linked to the core promoter (Â± 80 bp) as RiBi
genes.
The E(CG)-bearing RiBi regulon is found only in Mycbearing genomes
Like the bilaterian genomes of flies and humans, the cnidarian Nematostella, a non-bilaterian metazoan, possesses
Myc and Max homologs [27,37,38]. Nematostella Myc
homologs can also bind to E(CG) in vitro as well as rescue
the proliferative defects of myc null mammalian cells
(Janice Ascano, S.J.B, and M.D.C.; in preparation).
Intriguingly, the non-metazoan choanoflagellate genome
of Monosiga also possesses clear orthologs of both Myc
and Max (Fig. 3). However, outside of Holozoa, Myc and
Max genes appear to be absent. Yeast do not possess Myc
or Max orthologs even though E(CG)-binding bHLH dimers are present [39]. Moreover, the yeast RiBi genes, which
lack E(CG) sites, are known to be regulated by non-bHLH
factors [29-31,39]. We were also unable to find members
of the Myc clade of genes in other fungal and more distantly related eukaryotic genomes (see Methods).

The RiBi-E(CG) regulon occurs only in Myc-bearing
holozoan genomes. (A) Specific amino acid residues in
holozoan MAX (red), MAD (blue), MNT (pink), and MYC
(green) allow identification among the MYC/MAX superfamily bHLH genes (common superfamily residues in yellow
and underlined). Only three bHLH genes were found in the
choanoflagellate genome of Monosiga brevicollis: Mb-MYC,
MbMAX and MbMUSH, corresponding to Myc and Max
orthologs, and a distant MITF/USF/SREBP homolog (not
shown). No Myc and Max orthologs were found outside of
Holozoa. The predicted amino acid sequences of the bHLH
regions of the M. brevicollis Myc/Max family of genes are
shown aligned to Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, and Nematostella
orthologs. (B) The presence of Myc (green filled boxes) is
correlated with multiple genomes possessing the E(CG)-RiBi
signature (green filled boxes). Other bHLH genes in the Myc
superfamily (Max, Mad, Mnt; gray filled boxes) are either not
necessary (Mad or Mnt) or insufficient (Max) to explain the
occurrence of E(CG) sites in the RiBi regulon. "X" boxes
indicate absence of a gene or E(CG) signature as indicated.

Secondary loss of Myc is linked to secondary loss E(CG)
RiBi signature in nematodes
Unlike flies and humans, the nematode represents a bilaterian that appears to have secondarily lost Myc but not
Max (Fig. 3) [38]. This loss of a nematode Myc together
with the loss of the E(CG) signature in the RiBi regulon is
intriguing and suggests a few hypotheses and predictions.
We explore these here because the loss of both an important metazoan transcription factor and a statistically significant association of E(CG) motifs with the holozoan
RiBi gene battery is noteworthy and instructive of Myc
function.

One major developmental hypothesis of nematode loss of
both Myc and E(CG) sites in RiBi core promoters might
stem from the relatively small number of 1000 somatic
cells in the adult nematode [40]. This extremely low quantity of adult cells and limited cell-proliferation may render

capping of target genes [43,44], trans-splicing might have
alleviated the need for keeping the Myc gene.

The frequency of E(CG) in 25 opisthokont RiBi orthologs
was investigated. These 25 RiBi orthologs were selected
based on the presence of conserved E(CG) sites in the
human, fly, sea anemone, and choanoflagellate orthologs
(Table 1B). DNA sequences 500 bp upstream from the translational start sites in the RiBi orthologs of S. cerevisiae (Sc), C.
glabrata (Cg), K. lactis (Kl), A. gossypii (Ag), P. stipitis (Ps), D.
hansenii (Dh), C. albicans (Ca), Y. lipolytica (Yl), N. crassa (Nc),
S. pombe (Sp), and M. brevicollis (Mb) were collected. For D.
melanogaster (Dm), 500 bp of DNA sequence (Â± 250 bp)
from the 5' annotated end was collected. The sequences of
each of these opisthokont promoters was analyzed for the
presence of E(CG) motifs. The percentage of (ECG) in each
species' RiBi orthologs is depicted on the Y-axis with the
number of orthologs containing E(CG) over the total
ortholog number of orthologs displayed above each genome.
Key nodes for latest common ancestors (LCAs) are depicted
in the phylogenetic tree [59-61].

Yet a third hypothesis for loss of both Myc and E(CG) sites
in RiBi core promoters involves novel shared motifs in C.
elegans RiBi genes. Interestingly, as described further
below our investigation analysis across opisthokont
genomes, reveals several additional motifs resembling the
RRPE motif that is present across Opisthokonts (Fig. 5).
This could indicate a greater reliance on factors binding
the RRPE motif or an augmented basal level of expression.
Several studies have documented the evolution of cis-regulatory signatures via substitution of transcription factors
that regulate even highly conserved gene sets [45,46].
All three hypotheses for loss of nematode myc along with
loss of the E(CG)-RiBi signature are mutually non-exclusive. For instance, loss of proliferative cells and the underlying Myc genetic circuitry might have been permissive for
the development of trans-splicing. Alternatively, the evolution of nematode trans-splicing might have occured first
and been permissive for loss of Myc regulation.
Mad and Mnt are dispensable for the E(CG)-RiBi core
promoter signature
The loss of specific bHLH genes, such as the loss of Myc in
nematodes, results in different bHLH repertoires present
across holozoan genomes. We therefore next examined
genomic bHLH repertoires among different organisms in
order to consider potential trans-factors other than Myc
that might correlate with E(CG) core elements in RiBi promoters (Fig. 3).

Myc's induction of the RiBi regulon unnecessary. Thus,
under this hypothesis, the RiBi regulon is under two
modes of regulation in Holozoa. First, there is a basal rate
of low-level expression, and second there is a Mycdependent induced rate of elevated expression that is
associated with proliferating cells. Thus, nematodes with
their particular small body sizes, and limited cell numbers, might have evolved to forgo Myc-RiBi induction. If
this hypothesis is correct, we might expect to find further
pseudogenization of the Myc locus, in animals with similar character. Other phyla known to include animals of
such type include gastrotrichs, kinorhynchs, loriciferans,
nematomorphs, and some priapulids.

Among the Myc superfamily, Max:Max, Mad:Max,
Mnt:Max, and Myc:Max dimers, can all bind to E(CG)
[12,13,23]. The continued presence of both Mad and Max
in nematodes [38] suggests that Mad:Max or Max:Max
complexes do not target the RiBi regulon via the E(CG)
target site, which is absent in nematode genomes (Fig.
3A). Furthermore, a Mad ortholog is not present in Drosophila, whereas both Mnt and Mad are apparently absent
in Monosiga suggesting that both are dispensable for the
function of the E(CG)-RiBi signature (Fig. 3A). [Both Mad
and Mnt are present in other eumetazoan genomes such
as cnidiarians (N. vectensis) and sea urchins (S. purpuratus), but are reciprocally lost in flies (no Mad) and nematodes (no Mnt) (Fig. 3A).]

An alternative molecular hypothesis of nematode-specific
loss of both Myc and E(CG) sites in RiBi core promoters
involves the nematode phenomenon of trans-splicing
[41,42]. Nematodes employ a distinctive 5'-mRNA capping process that depends on trans-splicing of pre-capped
5' leader sequences expressed at independent loci.
Because Myc has recently been found to upregulate mRNA

All of these genomic configurations suggest that E(CG)
promoter signatures are direct targets of Myc:Max complexes and are consistent with both the known biochemically confirmed RiBi targets of Myc as well as the growthrelated phenotypes of myc mutant alleles. Nonetheless,
these results do not exclude the possibility that other
E(CG)-binding proteins potentially modulate the RiBi

Figure 5
Evolution of shared motifs in opisthokont RiBi core promoters
Evolution of shared motifs in opisthokont RiBi core promoters. The promoter gene sets for each species depicted in
Figure 4 weres analyzed by MEME to identify common cis-regulatory motifs for each lineage [57,58]. Motifs found in greater
than two-thirds of RiBi genes are depicted from left to right (highest scoring motifs to left). The frequency of each motif is
expressed as a percentage in the upper left corner. The known fungal motifs RRPE [5,6] and PAC [5-7] are shown in shown in

regulon when they coexist with Myc in the genome [47].
Thus, in conjunction with our RiBi-E(CG) genomic analyses, a consideration of the bHLH repertoire of holozoan
genomes supports the hypothesis that the need for regulation by Myc, but not by other bHLH genes, is responsible
for the evolutionary maintenance of E(CG) sites across
the RiBi suite of genes.
Evolution of RiBi core promoter sequences across
Opisthokonts
While we were not able to find either Myc or Max
orthologs in any available genome outside of Holozoa, it
is still possible that the E(CG) motif is still associated with
RiBi genes and controlled by other factors. For instance,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two E(CG)-binding
bHLH complexes from its small repertoire of bHLH genes
[39]. These correspond to Pho2p/Pho4p heterodimers
and Cbf1p homodimers. The Pho2p/Pho4p complex is
involved in the regulation of phosphate biogenesis in

responses to phosphate starvation, whereas Cbf in
involved in centromeric function, methionine biosynthesis, sulfur metabolism, and regulating ribosomal structural proteins, [39,46]. We therefore looked for the
presence of E(CG) in the core promoters of RiBi genes of
10 different fungal genomes (Fig. 4). We specifically
looked at the 25 RiBi orthologs that are E(CG)-bearing
across Holozoa (Table 1B). We find that the average rate
of E(CG) sites across all identifiable RiBi orthologs in the
500 bp window immediately upstream of the start ATG
(this window size corresponds to the typical intergenic
distances in these fungal genomes) is 16%. Three separate
fungal genomes have 0% E(CG)-bearing RiBi core promoters (0/25 RiBi promoters), while Ashbya gossipyi has
the highest at 37.5% (9/24 RiBi promoters). By comparison, in the 500 bp core promoter window of the 25 RiBi
genes in choanoflagellates the rate is 72% (18/25), while
in flies it is 84% (21/25); the few missing promoters have
E(CG) motifs in the adjacent upstream 100 bp. Thus, this

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:442

core set of RiBi genes is not likely to be regulated by E(CG)
motifs in fungi as the majority of their promoters lack this
site.
We next conducted a MEME analysis of 500 bp core promoter fragments across multiple holozoan and fungal
core promoter sequences for RiBi genes to identify all
potential motifs that might serve as common binding sites
in each system. We find that the previously identified PAC
(Polymerase A and C) RiBi motif [5-7] can be readily identified in almost all Hemiascomycete fungi except the distantly related Yarrowia lipolytica. This motif, when present,
is usually found in 100% of all RiBi genes analyzed in
each species. Thus, the same genes that are likely co-regulated by Myc:Max via E(CG) in Holozoa are instead coregulated by PAC binding factors in the Hemiascomycota
sub-phylum. Interestingly, among the Myc targets identified in flies, we have found subunits of DNA-dependent
RNA polymerases [see Additional file 1].
Unexpectedly, the RRPE motif, which was identified as a
co-occuring motif in yeast RiBi genes along with PAC
motifs, appears in both fungal and holozoan RiBi genes
promoters. A yeast-specific factor, Stb3, has been proposed to promote cell growth by binding to at least some
RRPEs in target genes in a glucose-dependent manner
[48]. However, not all RRPE-bearing yeast promoters
appear to require Stb3 for induction [48]. Nonetheless,
this motif may represent a more ancient and possibly conserved RiBi binding motif than previously appreciated. In
this case, Holozoan-specific and Hemiascomycete-specific
modes of RiBi regulation might be relatively more recent
additions since their divergence. Altogether, these analyses support the conclusion that E(CG) is uniquely associated with Myc-bearing Holozoan genomes and that
different signatures and factors control the same regulon
in distant taxa.

Conclusion
We successfully identified a specific core-promoter signature, partially composed of the Myc:Max binding site
E(CG), which is highly specific to the entire suite of genes
devoted to ribosome biogenesis in Holozoa but not in
fungal genomes. Based on these whole-genome analyses,
and the confirmation of individual RiBi genes as Myc targets, we conclude that the entire RiBi gene set constitutes
a bona fide Myc-targeted regulon. By analyzing a wide
diversity of eukaryotic genomes, we show that this specific
core-promoter signature is present only in holozoan
genomes that still contain Myc. Furthermore, gene loss in
other Myc:Max superfamily members, such as Mad or
Mnt, while retaining Myc, is apparently not sufficient for
loss of the E(CG) signature in the RiBi gene set. Thus,
nematode genomes, which lack Myc, but not Max or Mad,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/442

do not possess the E(CG) signature across the well-conserved RiBi gene set.
A toolkit of animal-specific genes, including the bHLH
family of DNA-binding factors, is thought to have been
assembled early in pre-animal evolution. The bHLH family has been intriguing because of its diversification into
cell-type specific functions modulating proliferation, differentiation, and metabolic programs across eukaryotes
[37-39,49,50]. Consequently, the evolution of animals is
likely to have involved the establishment of a canonical
set of bHLH transcription factors regulating these downstream genomic programs. Here, we describe a large RiBi
regulon that co-evolved with Myc:Max in a stem-holozoan. Significantly, Myc and Max mark the beginning of an
animal-like bHLH repertoire in a pre-metazoan ancestor.
Choanoflagellates represent the sister-group to animals.
Their ability to form colonies is indicative of a possible
precondition in the evolution of multicellularity in metazoa [51]. Furthermore, at least one Receptor Tyrosine
Kinase (RTK) has been identified in choanoflagellates
[52]. RTKs were once thought to be exclusive to animals,
which use them in cell-cell communication and as signaling inputs into growth factor-mediated pathways of gene
activation such as Myc [53]. These results suggest a model
for the origins of a Myc-induced RiBi regulon, which is
commonly misregulated in diverse human cancers.
Around 750 to 1000 million years ago [54], a protozoan,
heterotrophic ancestor of Holozoa either adapted, or coopted through duplication and divergence, a protoMyc:Max bHLH heterodimer complex and evolved the
capability to induce the primordial Myc moiety in
response to RTK-mediated growth signals. Core promoterbound Myc:Max complexes would then co-ordinately upregulate the ribosome biogenesis regulon and thereby
commit to cell growth and/or proliferation.
An alternative hypothesis would be that the RiBi genes
have always been inducible in diverse taxa, but that this
mode of regulation has diverged and/or been supplanted
by distinct mechanisms in different taxa. Thus, the Holozoan E(CG) RiBi signature would not represent a new
ability to up-regulate this gene set but rather a unique
mechanism for inducing the RiBi gene cohort. Similarly,
in the hemiascomycete fungi (except for the distantly
related Yarrowia) the RiBi gene set is co-regulated by nonbHLH factors via the PAC motif.
A recent study has also identified E(CG) as present in a
subset of core promoters of yeast ribosomal structural
protein-encoding genes driven by Cbf1p [46]. Yeast are
well known to have at least two E(CG)-binding bHLH systems in Pho2/Pho4p and Cbf1p complexes, which are

Page 9 of 13

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:442

involved in phosphate biogenesis and methionine biosynthesis/translation, respectively. We also see a slight elevated level of E(CG) in some fungal genomes such as
Pichia and Ashbya. Thus, the Holozoan Myc and Max system might have evolved out of an Opisthokont ancestor
in which E(CG) motifs might have been loosely tied to
generic growth programs controlling both RiBi and RP
gene sets. Under this scenario, a general cell growth pathway culminating in a bHLH induction of an undefined
regulon might have existed in an ancient opisthokont
ancestor. This pathway then diverged separately in fungi
and Holozoa. In Holozoa, this bHLH gene evolved into a
bHLH-ZIP encoding gene and subsequently duplicated
and diverged to produce Max, and a growth-inducible
activating form with Myc. The Myc-Max then specialized
in induction of RiBi genes. In fungi, this system perhaps
retained its ancestral homodimeric form in Cbf1p and
controlled a more generic cell growth pathway that
included ribosomal proteins, a few RiBi genes, as well as
other cell growth functions. Furthermore, the RiBi genes
in hemiascomycetes evolved to be largely controlled specifically by PAC-binding factors. Future research will have
to be conducted in both fungal and animal genomes to
explore these ideas.

Methods
Statistical analysis
Statistical tests were conducted to test for the significance
of the difference between RiBi, mitochondrial (CM), and
other control (C1 or C2) gene sets. A Mann-Whitney test
for the significance of the difference between RiBi genes
and control orthologs (C1 or C2, see Fig. 2) was statistically
significant (p < 0.001) for Hs, Dm, Nv, and Mb data. There
was no statistical significance between RiBi orthologs and
control data for Ce or Sc. A Mann-Whitney test for the significance of the difference between non-RiBi genes with
RiBi-type promoters, and mitochondrial or control
orthologs (C1 or C2, see Fig. 2) was statistically significant
(p < 0.001) for Hs and Dm data. However, there was no
statistical significance between RiBi-type promoter bearing non-RiBi gene orthologs and control data or mitochondrial orthologs for Nv, Mb, Ce, or Sc data. Statistical
validation of over-represented GO terms shared by genes
that we identified in Fig. 1 was carried out as previously
described [55]. The GO term "Ribosome Biogenesis and
Assembly" was found to be statistical significant (p < 1.2e
- 27) based on Fisher's Exact Test (one-sided P-value) of
the association between attribute and query.
Human and fly orthology
Lists of fly and human genes together with their corresponding DNA sequences (Â± 600 bp from 5'-annotated
end) meeting orthology gene tree tests between genomes
were retrieved from Ensembl data mining tool BioMart.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/442

The annotation data corresponded to Ensembl Release 44,
2007 using genome builds Drosophila melanogaster BDGP
4.3 and Homo sapiens NCBI 36. This resulted in 3066
human/fly pairs although some groups of pairs correspond to multiple isoforms in one genome. DNA
sequences were searched for CACGTG E-boxes [E(CG)]
using the UNIX grep and perl tools. Orthologous gene
pairs with E(CG) in each genome were compared with a
list of verified ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) genes [56], the
list of yeast orthologs with "nucleolar" GO classification,
and current results in the literature (Pubmed).
Genome assemblies and orthology identification
We used the following genome builds: Drosophila melanogaster BDGP 4.3, Homo sapiens NCBI 36, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae SGD1.01, and Caenorhabditis elegans WS170. We
used Ensembl Release 44 (2007) for orthology calls
between these four genomes. ENSEMBL orthology calls
use best reciprocal hits between genomes to cluster proteins followed by construction of maximum likelihood
phylogenetic gene trees (NJTREE) and distinguish
orthologs from paralogs. For identifying orthologous loci
in the Nematostella vectensis and Monosiga brevicollis we
used BLASTP to identify the best matches in the respective
genomes to the Drosophila amino acid sequence. EST coverage in each genome allowed independent confirmation
of the majority of homologous sequences. We identified
all hits with E <e - 10. We then performed a reciprocal
BLASTP to weed out 1-to-many hits.
Promoter sequence analysis
In searching for core promoter linked E(CG) sites we
looked used the BDGP assembly release 4, flybase annotation rel.4.3-20060130. To identify potential E(CG)
flanking patterns, the sequences adjacent to E(CG) sites in
the conserved human/fly RiBi genes as well as other
known confirmed Myc targets were aligned to identify the
reported information content in the immediate flanking
sequences. Additionally, these sequences were compared
to a variety of control sequences composed of anti-signature 2 motifs, promoter sequences of adjacent genes, or
unrelated developmental genes (anterior/posterior Drosophila developmental loci) to identify over-represented
motifs spanning 6 to 8 bp with 0, 1 or 2 wild cards. This
resulted in the identification of three classes of motifs: 1)
E(CG) with flanking sequence, 2) DRE sequences, 3) Arich sequences (Fig. 1). Genome queries were conducted
by direct searches of the most recent Drosophila genome
(BDGP 4.3) using UNIX grep and perl. Genomic queries
for signatures were defined as follows. Signature 1 identifies 15,434 in the Drosophila BDGP 4.3 genome searches.
Signature 2 was any sequence matching one of the following CAACACGTGCG, AAACACGTGTG, and AAACACGTGCG. Signature 3 was defined as a window of 80 bp

containing CACGTG and 2 of the following sequences:
CTATCG or TATCGA. Loci that mapped within 600 bp,
240 bp or 1 kb of these three signatures, respectively, were
identified.
bHLH phylogenetic analyses
Over 150 bHLH amino acid sequences from plant (Arabidopsis thaliana), ciliate (Tetrahymena thermophilia), yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae), choanoflagellate (Monosiga
brevicollis), sponge (Amphimedon queenslandica), cnidarian
(Nematostella vectensis), protostomes (Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans) and deuterostome
(Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) organisms were aligned
using CLUSTALW and used to make a primary alignment
and phylogenetic guide tree. Alignments were adjusted by
hand to reduce the number of insertions, and were subsequently used to generate random samples using PHYLIP
Seqboot. Phylogenetic trees were generated using neighbor-joining (PHYLIP Neighbor), parsimony (PHYLIP Protpars), or maximum liklihood (PHYLIP Proml). The
analyses were conducted by using all, or diverse subsets of
bHLH sequences, all of which supported the Myc and Max
clades. The Mnt/Mad clades alternatively group with a
Myc/Max clade or to the Max clade with a Myc sister clade
to that. Choanoflagellate bHLH sequences were identified
by BLASTP to bHLH sequences from yeast and Drosophila.
This process identified 3 choanoflagellate bHLH
sequences (Fig. 3).
Genome conservation
Human, Drosophila, and Saccharomyces genomic data were
retrieved for RiBi orthologs from Ensembl using their 1to-1 orthology classification. Nematostella, and Monosiga
single best BLAST matches (p < 10 - 5) were identified
from the Joint Genome Institute data sets annotated by
EST sequences and their genomic sequences retrieved. To
ascertain that the absence of the E(CG) regulon in the
yeast genome was not a secondarily derived trait akin to
nematodes, we investigated other fungal genomes as well
as more distantly related eukaryotic genomes, including at
10 other sequenced fungal genomes (JGI), as well as the
ciliated protist Tetrahymena thermophilia, the single celled
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (JGI), and the poplar
tree Populus trichocarpa (JGI). Each genome was searched
for BLASTP alignments using the fly Myc and Max bHLH
amino acid sequences. Only the Tetrahymena genome produced a match, which upon various CLUSTALW alignments falls outside of the Group B superclade from which
the Myc and Max clades group.
Control Sequences
Control genes (C1) were obtained by finding neighboring
downstream genes preserving orthology [see Additional
file 2]. First, yeast control genes were identified by finding
for each gene with a nucleolar GO term, the next down-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/442

stream gene with an ortholog in the human genome.
Orthology with a human gene ensured that control
sequences were derived from genes that are as conserved
as RiBi genes. Fly and worm control genes were generated
by finding for each human RiBi ortholog, the nearest
downstream gene a human ortholog. Monosiga and Nematostella downstream controls (C1) were generated by finding the nearest downstream EST to the corresponding RiBi
gene. The presence of one or more E(CG) sites in the
region Â± 600 bp from the 5'-most annotated end was
ascertained for each such control gene. Additional control
sequences (C2) were obtained for the Nematostella and
Monosiga genomes by taking Â± 600 bp from the 3' annotated end of each test gene [see Additional file 1].
MEME analysis and sequence logos
A set of RiBi orthologs meeting orthology gene tree tests
between genomes were retrieved from the Ensembl data
mining tool BioMart for Hs, Dr, Dm, Ce, and Sc genomes
respectively. The annotation data used genome builds Hs
(NCBI 36), Dr (Zv7), Dm (BDGP 5.4), CE (WS180) and
Sc (SDG1.01). For identifying orthologous loci in Nv, Mb,
and Ps, we used best reciprocal hits to identify orthologs
in the respective genomes of the closest related species. A
set of RiBi orthologs for Ag, Nc, and Sp were retrieved
from the Ashbya Genome Database project base on
Ensembl release 40. For identifying orthologous loci in Kl,
Dh, Cg, Ca, and Yl we used ortholgy calls from the
GÃ©nolevures Genomic Project. The DNA sequences for
each species RiBi gene promoters were then collected from
either Ensembl, JGI, or GÃ©nolevures for each respective
genome. For fungal and choanoflagellate RiBi promoter
sequences, -500 bp from the translational start site was
collected for each ortholog. For Dm, Ce, Nv, Dr, and Hs,
Â± 250 bp from the 5' annotated end was collected for each
ortholog. Each organism's RiBi sequence group was analyzed my MEME to determine overrepresented motifs
[57,58]. Motifs 6â10 bp in length that occured either zero
or one time in each sequence of each set per species such
that at least 10â75 motifs per set were identified. Furthermore, a secondary cut-off stipulating that all motifs be
found in at least 2/3 of all sequences per set was applied.
Sequence logos from the matrices of over-represented
motifs derived from MEME were then created using WebLogo.

Catalog of E(CG)-bearing promoters by genome and gene function.
All fly genes matching the fly RiBi promoter architecture (see Methods),
or else constituting the fly ortholog to a yeast nucleolar or RiBi gene is
listed. For each such fly gene, the corresponding ortholog (human, nematode, and yeast) or closest 1-to-1 homolog (cnidarian, choanoflagellate) is
listed along with the presence (1, red) or absence (0) of E(CG) within
600 bp of the annotated start site. The E values scores for BLASTP
