Abstract
Background: Cell elongation in plants requires addition and re-arrangements of cell wall
components. Even if some protein families have been shown to play roles in these events, a global
picture of proteins present in cell walls of elongating cells is still missing. A proteomic study was
performed on etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis used as model of cells undergoing elongation
followed by growth arrest within a short time.
Results: Two developmental stages (active growth and after growth arrest) were compared. A
new strategy consisting of high performance cation exchange chromatography and monodimensional electrophoresis was established for separation of cell wall proteins. This work allowed
identification of 137 predicted secreted proteins, among which 51 had not been identified
previously. Apart from expected proteins known to be involved in cell wall extension such as
xyloglucan endotransglucosylase-hydrolases, expansins, polygalacturonases, pectin methylesterases
and peroxidases, new proteins were identified such as proteases, proteins related to lipid
metabolism and proteins of unknown function.
Conclusion: This work highlights the CWP dynamics that takes place between the two
developmental stages. The presence of proteins known to be related to cell wall extension after
growth arrest showed that these proteins may play other roles in cell walls. Finally, putative
regulatory mechanisms of protein biological activity are discussed from this global view of cell wall
proteins.

Background
Plant cell walls are dynamic compartments whose composition and structure vary during development or in
response to environmental stresses. Variability has been
observed in developing roots at the level of glycoproteins

in carrot [1], and of polysaccharides in Arabidopsis thaliana
[2]. In both articles, antibodies against specific epitopes
showed an irregular distribution among cell types, as well
as changes in the course of development. Cell wall plasticity is particularly needed during cell elongation since cell

walls need to expand. During the elongation process, the
cellular machinery has to synthesize and export cell wall
components and reorganize cell wall networks [3].
To gain information on the genes and proteins involved
in cell wall elongation, it is important to dissect the different phases of the process. Arabidopsis hypocotyls are a suitable material, since almost no cell division occurs and
only the cells present in the embryo undergo elongation
[4-6]. Another advantage is that in etiolated hypocotyls,
synthesis, addition, and reorganization of cell wall material occur in time-separate phases [4,7]. During the first 3
days after germination synthesis and deposition of cell
wall material which result in cell wall thickening, are the
main features. Through the following days, the hypocotyl
will grow, mainly through extensive cell wall polymer disassembly and rearrangement.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible
for rearrangements of cell wall polymers during hypocotyl
growth requires the identification of the proteins present
in muro. On the one hand, previous studies identified gene
families involved in rearrangements of cell wall components during cell elongation [8-11]. On the other hand
plant cell wall proteomics emerged a few years ago, providing information on cell wall proteins (CWPs) present
in different types of Arabidopsis cells including cell suspension cultures, roots, rosette leaves, and stems [12,13]. In
most cases, limitations were encountered, e.g. the presence of intracellular contaminants [14] and a poor quality
of separation of CWPs by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-E) [15]. The main families of CWPs were identified [16] on the basis on bioinformatics prediction of
functional domains.
In this paper, we analyzed the cell wall proteome of halfand fully-grown etiolated hypocotyls, corresponding to
the phases of active elongation and after growth arrest. A
new strategy was established for CWP separation, and
semi-quantification. The comparison of these two proteomes revealed significant dynamics in CWPs. The
expected presence of CWPs involved in polysaccharide
rearrangement and modification was confirmed in growing hypocotyls. However, some of CWPs were also present
in fully-grown hypocotyls, suggesting that either they have
long half-lives, or that they could be involved in other
functions. Finally, this study led to the identification of
new candidates acting in cell elongation.

Methods
Plant material
Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia 0) seeds are purchased from The Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre
(NASC) http://arabidopsis.info/. One hundred and thirty
mg of Arabidopsis seeds were cultivated in Magenta boxes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/94

as previously described [14]. Magenta boxes were kept in
the dark at 4°C during 48 h, and subsequently exposed to
light for 4 h to synchronize germination. Finally, seedlings were grown in the dark at 23°C for 5 or 11 days.
Seedling hypocotyls were cut just below the cotyledons
and above the roots. Typically, 36 and 18 Magenta boxes
were required for 5 and 11 day-old seedlings respectively.
Preparation of a cell wall fraction and protein extraction
Cell walls were prepared as previously described [14]. Proteins were extracted from the cell wall fraction in two successive steps, first with a CaCl2 solution (5 mM sodium
acetate buffer, pH 4.6, 0.2 M CaCl2 and 10 μL protease
inhibitor cocktail, Sigma), followed by two extractions
with a LiCl solution (5 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6,
2 M LiCl and 10 μL protease inhibitor cocktail). Finally,
proteins were desalted and lyophilized.
Protein separation by cation exchange chromatography
Lyophilized proteins were dissolved in a total volume of 2
mL of water. They were quantified with the Coomassie®
protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using bovine serum
albumin (BSA) as a standard [17]. One mg of proteins was
used for chromatographic fractionation on a 1 mL
HiTrap™ SP FF (Sepharose Fast Flow) column (Amersham
Biosciences), equilibrated with 50 mM MES (pH 5.6)
operated with an FPLC™ (Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography) System (Amersham Biosciences), controlled by the
FPLCdirector™ version 1.0 (Amersham Biosciences). The
protein solution was adjusted to 50 mM MES (pH 5.6),
and 20 μL protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) were added
before loading onto the column at a flow rate of 0.5
mL.min-1. A 10 mL unfixed fraction was collected at the
same rate. Three mL of first wash with 50 mM MES (pH
5.6) were collected at a flow rate of 1 mL.min-1. Fixed proteins were eluted by a gradient from 0 M to 0.8 M NaCl in
50 mM MES (pH 5.6); 24 fractions (1 mL each) were collected at a flow rate of 1 mL.min-1. Finally the column was
successively washed with 3 mL of 1.2 M NaCl and 3 mL of
1.5 M NaCl in 50 mM MES (pH 5.6) at the same flow rate.
These washes were also collected in 6 fractions (1 mL per
tube). To prevent protein degradation, 2 μL of protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) were added to all the 1 mL fractions, 6 μL to the first wash and 20 μL to the unfixed fractions. The fractions were combined in twos and threes,
depending on their protein concentration. Non-fixed proteins were concentrated by successive centrifugations at
4000 × g using the Centriprep® centrifugal filter device
(YM-10 kDa membrane for volumes greater than 6 mL or
5 kDa for smaller volumes, Millipore) at 4000 × g. All protein fractions were desalted prior to lyophilization using
Econo-Pac® 10DG columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with
0.2 M ammonium formate.

Protein separation by mono-dimensional electrophoresis
(1D-E) and identification
Each lyophilized fraction was dissolved in 200 μL water
and separated by electrophoresis according to Laemmli
[18]. Samples were loaded on 22 × 15 × 0.15 cm SDSpolyacrylamide gel with a concentration of 12.5% of acrylamide. The staining was carried out with a Coomassie
Brilliant Blue (CBB)-based method [19]. Colored bands
were excised from gels and digested with trypsin as
described before [20,21]. Matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization – time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) analyses were performed as previously reported
[20,21]. MALDI-TOF-TOF MS analysis was performed
using a MALDI TOF-TOF Voyager 4700 (AppliedBiosystems/MDS Sciex, USA). N-terminal sequencing of the protein encoded by At5g14920 was performed at Plate-Forme
d'Analyse et de Microséquençage des Protéines at the Institut
Pasteur (Paris, France).
Semi-quantification
Peptide mass fingerprints were compared to the nonredundant database of Arabidopsis of NCBI http://prospec
tor.ucsf.edu/html/instruct/allman.htm#database using
ProteinProspector (MS-FIT: http://prospector.ucsf.edu/
cgi-bin/msform.cgi?form=msfitstandard). A quantification index (QI) was calculated for each protein by adding
the percentages of coverage, using peptide mass mapping
(ratio between the number of amino acids in peptides
detected by MS and the total number of amino acids of
the protein) in all the bands of the FPLC profile in which
the protein had been identified.
Bioinformatic analyses
Sub-cellular localization, length of signal peptides, prediction of transmembrane domains, homologies to other
proteins and protein functional domains were predicted
as described before [15]. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and
carbohydrate esterases (CEs) were respectively classified
according to the CAZy database http://www.cazy.org[22].
Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase-hydrolases (XTHs) and
expansins were respectively named according to http://
labs.plantbio.cornell.edu/xth/ and http://www.bio.psu.
edu/expansins/index.htm. Arabinogalactan proteins
(AGPs) and fasciclin arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs)
were named according to Schultz et al. [23], Johnson et al.
[24] and van Engels and Roberts [25]. Proteins homologous to COBRA, leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) and
Hyp/Pro-rich proteins were respectively annotated
according to Roudier et al. [26], Baumberger et al. [27],
and Fowler et al. [28]. Peroxidases were named according
to the PeroxiBase http://peroxidase.isb-sib.ch/index.php
[29]. Laccases were annotated as in Pourcel et al. [30] and
McCaig et al. [31]. SKU-like proteins and phytocyanins
were respectively named according to Jacobs and Roe
[32], and Nersissian and Shipp [33]. Proteases were anno-

Results
Establishment of methods for efficient proteomic analysis
of hypocotyl cell walls
The aim of this proteomic study was to compare two
developmental stages of Arabidopsis hypocotyls. This goal
required about 40 g of homogenous material obtained in
the following culture conditions: synchronized germination, high seedling density on the culture medium, and
control of in vitro culture conditions. Five day-old elongating hypocotyls and 11 day-old fully-grown hypocotyls
were compared [4,7]. First, the cell wall fraction was prepared to minimize intracellular contamination and loss of
proteins [14]. To collect mg amounts of proteins for FPLC
separation, two successive extractions were performed
with 0.2 M CaCl2 and 2 M LiCl [14]. Both extracts were
combined and used for further analysis. Typically, about
1 mg of proteins was obtained from 1 g of dry cell wall
fraction.

Finally, proteins were separated prior to their identification by peptide mass mapping using MALDI-TOF MS and
bioinformatics. Since 2D-E is not appropriate for resolving CWPs [12], these proteins were separated using monodimensional gel electrophoresis (1D-E). Approximately
60 bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue
(CBB). Fifty two and 67 proteins were respectively identified in the extract from 5 and 11 day-old hypocotyls
extracts (Additional data files 1, 2). Because of the limited
resolution by 1D-E, many proteins, some of which have a
low number of peptides, were identified in each band. In
order to improve the separation and identification of proteins, we introduced an additional step prior to 1D-E.
Since most CWPs are basic [16], a cation exchange chromatography was performed using an FPLC device (Figures
1A, 2A). Fractions were collected and combined prior to
separation by 1D-E (Figures 1B, 2B). At this point, approximately 500 bands were stained with CBB and were further analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The proportion of
successful protein identification in stained bands was
about 70%. Respectively 141 and 109 proteins were identified in 5 and 11 day-old hypocotyls. Many of the proteins were identified in several bands, thus reinforcing
their identification. There was a great improvement in the
quality of the analysis: (i) the number of identified proteins was doubled; (ii) the quality of the identifications
was improved with higher numbers of peptides for identification of most proteins (Additional data files 3 and 4);
(iii) the semi-quantification of proteins allowed the comparison of the two samples.

Proteins identified in cell wall extracts of Arabidopsis
etiolated hypocotyls
Combining results of 1D- and 2D-separation, 147 and
126 proteins were identified respectively in 5 and 11 dayold etiolated hypocotyls respectively (Table 1, Additional
data file 5). On the one hand, bioinformatics prediction
indicated that 120 (82%) and 101 (79%) proteins were
secreted proteins in 5 and 11 day-old hypocotyls respectively. On the other hand, 27 and 25 proteins (in 5 and 11
day-old hypocotyls respectively) had no predicted signal
peptide, and were considered as intracellular contaminants. Altogether, 173 proteins were identified in hypocotyls among which 137 (79%) were predicted to be
secreted, indicating the good quality of cell wall preparations. In this article, these proteins will be called CWPs.
Although many CWPs (84) were found in both samples,
only 36 and 17 were identified only in 5 and 11 day-old
hypocotyls respectively.

A second bioinformatics analysis of CWPs allowed their
classification according to functional domains. For several
protein families, experts' designation was used as
described in Experimental procedures. The nine functional classes defined by Jamet et al. [12] were employed
(Figure 3): proteins acting on carbohydrates, oxidoreductases, proteins with interaction domains, proteases,
structural proteins, proteins involved in signaling, proteins related to lipid metabolism, proteins with miscellaneous functions, and proteins of unknown function.
Some protein classes were more abundant at 5 days than
at 11 days, e.g. proteins acting on carbohydrates (28 vs
21), proteins with interaction domains (25 vs 22), proteins related to lipid metabolism (7 vs 5), and proteases
(14 vs 9) (Figure 3a). In each functional class, some CWPs
were only identified at 5 or 11 days (Figure 3b). Differences appeared among proteins acting on carbohydrates
(11 and 4 were found only at 5 or 11 days respectively),
proteases (5 were only found at 5 days), proteins with
domains of interactions with proteins or carbohydrates (3
were only found at 5 days), miscellaneous proteins and
proteins of unknown function. In particular, the pattern
of oxido-reductases appeared to be very different with 5
and 6 proteins being identified only at 5 and 11 days
respectively. On the contrary, signaling and structural proteins showed minor changes. Due to their specific structural characteristics, they are not very present in either

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/94

proteomes. Structural proteins are difficult to extract when
they are cross-linked. They are also hard to identify
because of numerous post-translational modifications
(PTMs) [34]. Proteins involved in signaling, such as AGPs,
may also have many PTMs [35], and proteins with transmembrane domains are not usually extracted with the
protocol used [14].
Finally, 51 proteins reported in this work were not identified in previous cell wall proteomic studies (Table 2).
There are 11 CWPs that act on carbohydrates, 8 oxidoreductases, 5 proteases, 8 that carry interacting domains, 1
which is possibly involved in signaling, 1 structural protein, 4 proteins related to lipid metabolism, 5 proteins
with diverse functions, and 7 without known function.
Semi-quantitative comparative analysis of CWPs
In the previous section, the comparison of the two physiological stages was based on the single criterion of presence/absence of a protein among proteins identified by
MS. A more precise comparison would require the quantification of the proteins. However, for several reasons,
CBB staining of the gels does not allow such quantification. Despite improvement in the separation of proteins
by liquid chromatography followed by 1D-E, as compared
to 1D-E alone, most proteins were found in several FPLC
fractions and in several bands of the same FPLC fractions.
This was probably due to PTMs, proteolytic maturation or
degradation of proteins. Moreover, due to differences in
ionization efficiency of diverse peptides, and variations
related to competitive desorption of peptides at the time
of ionization, MALDI-TOF MS analyses are not quantitative. We propose alternative ways to compare the proteins
of both samples. In a first approach, FPLC fractions, in
which proteins were identified, were counted. This was
done in order to give a first criterion, based on the following rationale: an abundant protein is more difficult to
resolve and will be distributed in more fractions than a
rare protein. The calculations carried out on members of
several gene families give an overview of the relative abundance of each protein (Figure 4). Two additional criteria
were then considered with the aim of evaluating the relative amount of each protein at both stages of development: the number of bands per fraction, and the
percentage of coverage of the amino acid sequence by
peptide mass mapping. A correlation was observed

between the abundance of a protein and the number of
matching peptides expressed as a percentage of coverage
(results not shown). For a given protein, adding up all values, a semi-quantitative index (QI) was obtained, which
allows comparisons of the relative amount of each protein
in the two samples (Additional data file 6).
Taking into account QIs, 63% of the proteins showed differences in the two developmental stages: 61 proteins
(42%) are more abundant at 5 days and 26 (17%) at 11
days. Figure 3c presents the results ordered by functional
classes. These results were fully consistent with those
described above, which only take into account the presence of a protein in FPLC fractions (Figure 3b). However,
the differences are now more important. For example, 17
out of 32 for proteins acting on carbohydrates are more
abundant at 5 than at 11 days. The case is the same for
proteins having domains of interactions, proteins related
to lipid metabolism, and miscellaneous proteins.
For proteins acting on carbohydrates (Figure 4a), all the
identified expansins were more represented at 5 than at 11
days. The situation was similar for PMEs with the exception of At3g43270 that was found in the same number of
FPLC fractions at 5 and 11 days. On the contrary, XTHs
and PGs presented a more complex pattern. Three XTHs
were more abundant at 5 than at 11 days (AtXTH4,
AtXTH5, and AtXTH31), whereas AtXTH33 was equally
present at both stages, and AtXTH32 was found only at 11
days. Three PGs were found only at 5 days (At2g33160,
At1g19170, and At4g18180), At3g15850 was equally represented at 5 and 11 days, and At3g06770 was only found
at 11 days.
The distribution of oxido-reductases in the two stages
looked as complicated as that of XTHs (Figure 4b).
AtPrx36 and AtPrx57 were identified only at 5 days
whereas AtPrx12, AtPrx43, and AtPrx72 were identified
only at 11 days. AtPrx32 was more abundant at 5 days
whereas AtPrx45 was more abundant at 11 days. Finally,
AtPrx30, AtPrx34, and AtPrx69 were equally present at
both stages. Among other proteins predicted to be oxidoreductases, berberine-bridge enzymes were found in the
two stages of development.
Most proteins related to lipid metabolism were more
abundant at 5 than at 11 days (Figure 4c). This is especially the case for proteins containing a GDSL-Lipase/
Acylhydrolase domain (At1g29670, At1g54010, and
At3g48460).
In the case of proteases (Figure 4d), the situation differed
depending on the protease family. Three Asp proteases
were found only at 5 days (At1g79720, At3g02740, and
At3g52500), whereas 3 of them were more abundant at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/94

11 than at 5 days (At3g54400, At5g10770, and
At5g07030). At1g09750 was equally present at both
stages. Three Cys proteases were more abundant at 11
than at 5 days (At1g47128, At5g43060, and At4g01610).
Instead, a Ser protease was found only at 11 days
(At4g30610). Finally, protease inhibitors (Figure 4d) were
distributed in the two stages of development, with 4 of
them equally present at both stages, 2 only found at 5
days, and 1 more represented at 11 days.

Discussion
This work provides a global picture of the cell wall proteome during elongation of etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis. It shows the dynamics of CWPs during two phases
of hypocotyl development, i.e. active elongation and after
growth arrest. Expected CWPs known to be involved in
cell wall extension such as XTHs, expansins, PGs, PMEs
and peroxidases were identified as well as new CWPs such
as proteases, proteins predicted to be related to lipid
metabolism and proteins of unknown function. In addition, the occurrence of CWPs known to be related to cell
wall extension after growth arrest showed that those proteins probably have other functions in mature cell walls.
Important progress in plant cell wall proteomics was
achieved by setting up a new separation method for
CWPs. Separation of plant CWPs for proteomic purposes
was difficult using 2D-E [12]. The window of protein separation is optimal for pIs between 3 and 10 and for molecular masses between 120 and 10 kDa. Since most CWPs
are basic glycoproteins, they tend to migrate as a smear on
the basic side of 2D-gels [15]. Alternative methods were
proposed; they consisted in separation of CWPs into an
acidic and a basic fraction by cation exchange chromatography followed by 2D-E and 1D-E respectively [20,21].
The new method includes a first step of separation by cation exchange chromatography at acidic pH, and a second
step of separation by 1D-E. It gives more information on
the physico-chemical properties of the proteins, allows
comparative semi-quantification among different samples, as well as a better identification through MALDI-TOF
MS. In the case of etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis, it
allowed the doubling of the number of proteins identified
as compared to separation by 1D-E alone. In addition,
since many CWPs can now be visualized, this work provided preparative tools for developing biochemical studies on CWPs, either for further purification or structural
characterization.
Altogether, 137 CWPs were identified in this study among
which 51 had not been previously identified through cell
wall proteomics. This work also presents an overview of
the dynamics of CWPs during cell elongation. Many differences were observed between elongating and fullygrown hypocotyls. When only the presence/absence of a

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:94

CWP was considered, these changes concerned 53 out of
the 137 identified CWPs (38%). When the proposed
semi-quantification method was taken into account, this
percentage increased to 63% (34 additional proteins).
Changes in the same gene family can reflect the regulation
of gene expression at different stages of development and/
or differences in biological activity, as discussed below for
XTHs, PGs, expansins, PMEs, and peroxidases. Proteins
acting on carbohydrates are more numerous and more
abundant in elongating hypocotyls than in fully-grown
hypocotyls. This was to be expected since rearrangements
of cell wall polysaccharides are very important during cell
elongation [7]. The fact that proteases are more numerous
and in higher amounts at 5 than at 11 days is more surprising. Nothing is known about their targets in cell walls.
Are they contributing to release peptides involved in signaling [36]? Are they involved in protein maturation [13]
or in protein degradation? Conversely, two protease
inhibitors are much more abundant at 11 than at 5 days.
Altogether, it seems that proteolytic activities are more
important when elongation is active than during elongation arrest. Among oxido-reductases, five berberine-bridge
enzymes were identified among which three were present
only at 11 days. The role of such proteins in cell walls is
still unknown. For proteins with interacting domains,
some lectins and PME inhibitors are more abundant at 5
days. Among miscellaneous proteins, the amount of
CWPs containing phosphatase domains was found to be
higher at 5 than at 11 days. Such proteins were shown to
be associated to the regeneration of protoplast cell walls
[37] and pollen tube growth [38], but their precise roles
are still unknown. A protein homologous to COBRA
(AtCOBL10) was only found at 5 days. Although the function of AtCOBL10 is not known, it should be noted that
COBRA was shown to participate in the orientation of cellulose microfibrils, and dark-grown hypocotyls of the cob4 mutant have a 95% reduction in length compared to the
wild-type [39]. AtCOBL10 may play such a role during the
elongation of hypocotyl cells.
Many proteins expected to participate in cell wall extension, such as XTHs, expansins, PGs, PMEs and peroxidases
[3,8,9,40] were found. But such proteins, i.e. same proteins or proteins of the same family were also found after
completion of elongation. Several hypotheses can be proposed. Although many proteases were identified at both
stages of development suggesting a regulation of CWPs by
proteolytic degradation, these proteins can have a long
half-life. However, it is probable that some of these proteins participate in the differentiation of tracheary elements, such as AtXTH32 which was only identified at 11
days. This XTH which belongs to the phylogenic group 3,
like AtXTH31 and AtXTH33, has been assumed to have
xyloglucan endo-hydrolysis activity [41]. AtXTH31-33
might be involved in the rearrangement of cell walls of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/94

differentiating vessels elements. Such elements can be
observed using microscopy (not shown). In the same way,
some expansins were found in differentiating tracheary
elements [42]. Finally, at least PMEs and peroxidases were
assumed to play a role both during the elongation process
and elongation arrest. The enzymatic activity of PMEs may
be modulated, depending on the pH of the extracellular
matrix and on the structure of pectic homogalacturonans.
They could have either a local activity favoring the enzymatic activity of endo-PGs thus producing fragments of
pectin, or a processing activity leading to the de-esterification of stretches of GalA and to the formation of the socalled egg-boxes that tend to rigidify the pectic network
[8]. Moreover, the degree of pectin methyl-esterification
was shown to be positively correlated to hypocotyl growth
[43]. The activity of peroxidases is also versatile [9]. During the hydroxylic cycle, peroxidases can produce reactive
oxygen species that can break cell wall polysaccharides in
a non-enzymatic way thus favoring cell wall extension
[9,44]. On the contrary, during the peroxidative cycle, peroxidases can promote cross-linking of cell wall components such as structural proteins or lignins. In addition,
members of most of these protein families were identified
in apoplastic fluids of rosette leaves [21]. Since leaf cells
are surrounded by mature walls, this can mean that those
CWPs may play house-keeping roles.
Proteomics provides information about possible regulatory mechanisms of CWPs. As previously discussed [10],
the presence of a protein does not mean that it has full
biological activity. Proteins with putative enzymatic activities are numerous, but inhibitors of these activities are
also present. This is the case for proteases (14) and protease inhibitors (7), PMEs (6) and PME inhibitors (3
PMEIs). Some PMEs have a pro-domain consisting of a
PMEI. However, such domains are assumed to be cleaved
during or just after protein export, since they were never
found in purified PMEs [8]. In the same way, no peptide
matching the PMEI domains were found during identification of PMEs by peptide mass mapping (data not
shown). Other enzyme inhibitors are assumed to be
involved in defense reaction, such as PG inhibiting proteins (3 PGIPs) and inhibitors of xyloglycan endoglucanases (3 XEGIPs). Indeed, some of them were shown to be
specifically active against fungal enzymes [45]. Other regulatory mechanisms include variations in pH of the extracellular matrix that occur during growth arrest [45],
physical contact between enzymes and their substrates
[10] and proteolytic degradation.
Eight proteins predicted to be related to lipid metabolism
were identified at both stages of hypocotyl development.
At present, little is known about the functions of such proteins in cell walls. Since etiolated hypocotyls have a
thicker cuticle than light-grown hypocotyls [4], the pres-

ence of proteins involved in cuticle formation is expected.
Several genes encoding proteins from the same families
have been found to be up-regulated in 35S::AtMYB41
plants having defects in cell expansion and leaf surface
permeability [46]. Two mutants affected in genes encoding proteins related to lipid metabolism have been
described. GLIP1 encodes a predicted lipase/acylhydrolase that was shown to have a lipase activity in vitro and to
disrupt fungal spore integrity at the level of cell wall and/
or membrane [47]. Although none of the proteins of the
GDSL family was shown to have an activity towards natural lipids in vitro, it cannot be excluded that such proteins
are hydrolases acting on cutin or suberin lipids (F. Beisson, personal communication). BODYGUARD encodes a
protein predicted to belong to an α/β-hydrolase fold
superfamily [48]. The bodyguard mutant shows defects in
cuticle formation that could result from incomplete
polymerization of the carboxyl esters of the cuticle. The
function of LTPs is still a matter of debate. They were
shown to bind fatty acids and to transfer phospholipids
among membranes in vitro [49]. At2g38530 encoding
LTP2 was found to be up-regulated in the epidermis of
stems and assumed to contribute to active cuticle formation during stem elongation [50]. Apart from this role in
cuticle formation, many roles were proposed for LTPs
including systemic resistance signaling [51], ability to promote cell wall expansion through binding to a hydrophobic partner in cell walls [52], and activation of a PG [53].
CWPs predicted to be related to lipid metabolism, identified in this study are candidates for roles in cuticle formation.

Conclusion
This proteomic survey provides tools for biochemical
studies of CWPs, identifies members of multigene families involved in cell elongation, and gives clues for
unraveling the function of many CWPs in etiolated
hypocotyls. It also shows CWP dynamics in the two developmental stages. This is illustrated by changes in protein
amount, presence/absence of specific members of multigene families, and presence of many enzymes including
proteases and their inhibitors. Interestingly, many CWPs
were found only at one stage of development, either in
active elongation or after growth arrest. Conversely, different CWPs from the same gene families were found at both
stages of development, showing stage-specific regulation
and suggesting diverse roles in cell walls. Particular attention should be paid to proteins of unknown function,
some of which are very abundant. Additional functional
studies are now required to shed light on the roles of the
identified CWPs during the elongation of hypocotyls in
the dark.
