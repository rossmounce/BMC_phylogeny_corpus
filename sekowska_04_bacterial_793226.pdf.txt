Abstract
Background: The thiomethyl group of S-adenosylmethionine is often recycled as methionine from
methylthioadenosine. The corresponding pathway has been unravelled in Bacillus subtilis. However
methylthioadenosine is subjected to alternative degradative pathways depending on the organism.
Results: This work uses genome in silico analysis to propose methionine salvage pathways for Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Leptospira interrogans, Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis and Xylella fastidiosa. Experiments performed
with mutants of B. subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa substantiate the hypotheses proposed. The enzymes that
catalyze the reactions are recruited from a variety of origins. The first, ubiquitous, enzyme of the pathway, MtnA
(methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase), belongs to a family of proteins related to eukaryotic intiation factor
2B alpha. mtnB codes for a methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase. Two reactions follow, that of an enolase
and that of a phosphatase. While in B. subtilis this is performed by two distinct polypeptides, in the other organisms
analyzed here an enolase-phosphatase yields 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene. In the presence of
dioxygen an aci-reductone dioxygenase yields the immediate precursor of methionine, ketomethylthiobutyrate.
Under some conditions this enzyme produces carbon monoxide in B. subtilis, suggesting a route for a new gaseous
mediator in bacteria. Ketomethylthiobutyrate is finally transaminated by an aminotransferase that exists usually
as a broad specificity enzyme (often able to transaminate aromatic aminoacid keto-acid precursors or histidinolphosphate).
Conclusion: A functional methionine salvage pathway was experimentally demonstrated, for the first time, in P.
aeruginosa. Apparently, methionine salvage pathways are frequent in Bacteria (and in Eukarya), with recruitment
of different polypeptides to perform the needed reactions (an ancestor of a translation initiation factor and
RuBisCO, as an enolase, in some Firmicutes). Many are highly dependent on the presence of oxygen, suggesting
that the ecological niche may play an important role for the existence and/or metabolic steps of the pathway, even
in phylogenetically related bacteria. Further work is needed to uncover the corresponding steps when dioxygen
is scarce or absent (this is important to explore the presence of the pathway in Archaea). The thermophile T.
tengcongensis, that thrives in the absence of oxygen, appears to possess the pathway. It will be an interesting link
to uncover the missing reactions in anaerobic environments.

Background

Results

Availability of a huge number of genome sequences (1004
ongoing or completed genome sequencing programmes
are listed at http://wit.integratedgenomics.com/GOLD/
on February 17th, 2004) now allows scientists to explore
new avenues in the deciphering of metabolic pathways.
While sulfur is ubiquitously used in life, it is a highly reactive atom, hence very sensitive to the oxido-reduction
potential of its local environment. It is also very sensitive
to dioxygen and reactive oxygen species. As a consequence, sparing processes that enable the cell to keep a
sulfur atom in its final chemical and electronic environment (inside well characterized groups of atoms) often
exists in cells [1]. A case in point is the fate of the ubiquitous S-adenosylmethionine molecule (AdoMet), which
can donate each one of its sulfur connected groups:
methyl-, aminobutyryl- (usually, after decarboxylation as
aminopropyl-), and adenosyl- (ribosyl-). A vast number
of AdoMet mediated methylation events continuously
happen in most, if not all organisms. Methylases are
present at the level of DNA metabolism, RNA metabolism
and protein post-translational modifications [2-4]. They
are also involved in formation of a variety of small metabolites (essential coenzymes or prosthetic groups in particular [5,6]). This group transfer results in the synthesis of
S-adenosyl homocysteine (AdoHcy). The latter molecule
has to be recycled or further metabolized, either after excision of the adenine moiety by hydrolysis or phosphorolysis, or by direct hydrolysis into adenosine and
homocysteine. When aminopropyl- is transferred, methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a by-product. It is produced
during synthesis of spermidine and spermine, and also of
N-acylhomoserine lactone synthases in Gram-negative
bacteria [7] and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate
(ACC) synthase in plants (and possibly in bacteria producing ethylene). Furthermore, other still unknown reactions might exist, transferring the aminopropyl-group to
yet unrecognized acceptors (most likely to be nitrogen
atoms). Recycling the sulfur-containing compounds Sadenosylhomocysteine and MTA is a challenge for all
cells. MTA may regenerate methionine in the process. The
biochemical details of the MTA to methionine pathway
remains unknown in most organisms. This prompted us
to make a thorough analysis of available genome
sequences to try and identify some of the metabolic pathways involved in MTA recycling through genomic and
functional comparisons with our recent findings [8]. The
present work aims at combining comparative genomics
and biochemical or genetic data to propose a list of identified and putative genes associated to the corresponding
functions. A self-consistent nomenclature will be proposed in parallel, so that homologous functions in various organisms could tentatively be identified from their
genome sequences.

MTA can be exported from the cell, or recycled, beginning
with two main alternative pathways (Figure 1). The most
energy sparing one starts with MTA phosphorolysis and
yields methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR-1-P) [9],
while the second one splits this first step into two steps:
the first one being hydrolysis of MTA to methylthioribose
(MTR) and adenine, followed by ATP-dependent phosphorylation of MTR by MTR kinase [10,11]. In this latter
case, MTR can also be excreted from the cell, especially in
organisms that are not challenged by a high level of dioxygen (this happens in facultative anaerobes living in rich
media, such as Escherichia coli [12]).
MTA phosphorylase
The gene coding for MTA phosphorylase (named mtnP,
see below) has been identified in many organisms, in all
three kingdoms: Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. The activity of the enzyme has long been studied as a target to fight
some kinds of tumor cells [13]. A PROSITE signature,
PDOC00946, [GST]-x-G-[LIVM]-G-x-[PA]-S-x-[GSTA]-Ix(3)-E-L, is common to three classes of nucleoside phosphorylases, purine nucleosidases, uridine nucleosidases
and MTA phosphorylase. A second signature,
PDOC00954
[LIV]-x(3)-G-x(2)-H-x-[LIVMFY]-x(4)[LIVMF]-x(3)-[ATV]-x(1,2)-[LIVM]-x-[ATV]-x(4)-[GN]x(3,4)-[LIVMF](2)-x(2)-[STN]-[SA]-x-G-[GS]-[LIVM]
labels some other phosphorylases (including MTA phosphorylase), from Eukarya in particular.

This family can be narrowed into three conserved
domains families: COG0005, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, pfam00896, phosphorylase family 2,
KOG3985, MTA phosphorylase. Interestingly, these
purine nucleoside phosphorylase families share most of
their sequence in amino acid residues, except for the very
first residues, that appear to be made of a particular
sequence in the case of MTA phosphorylase. In contrast to
other purine nucleoside phosphorylases, it appears likely
that the amino-terminal end of MTA phosphorylase starts
very early upstream of the G [ST]G sequence that is conserved in purine nucleoside phosphorylases: the exception we find to the rule is the sequence present in
Synechocystis PCC6803, but a methionine codon is placed
just at the expected beginning of the protein, while
translation of the upstream region is not confirmed by
biochemical analysis (and it is notorious that start codons
are difficult to identify in general and in cyanobacteria in
particular). Immediately upstream of this first consensus
sequence, a G amino acid residue is found in all known
and putative MTA phosphorylases, as well as other features of the region displayed in Figure 2. It was therefore
important to explore whether in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
gene PA-3004 (mtnP), which has this signature, codes for
MTA phosphorylase. The presence of this gene is not ubiq-

uitous in gamma-proteobacteria, since this gene seems to
be absent from Klebsiella pneumoniae (the sequence of the
complete genome is not publicly available, sequences of
the ongoing genome project are available at http://
genome.wustl.edu/blast/client.pl).
The P. aeruginosa methionine-auxotroph PAO503, which
carries a mutation in the metZ gene encoding O-succinylhomoserine sulfhydrylase [14], grew well on minimal
medium E when supplemented with either methionine,
homocysteine or MTA. By contrast, a mutant derived from
PAO503 by gene replacement, PAO6422 (metZ mtnP), did
not grow with MTA, but still responded to methionine
and homocysteine (Table 1). These results demonstrate
that P. aeruginosa has an MTA recycling pathway and that

MTA phosphorylase has an essential function in this
pathway.
An alignment of MTA phosphorylase and purine phosphorylase is provided in Figure 2, with sequences from
Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (Firmicutes [15]) and P.
aeruginosa (gamma-proteobacteria), as well as from an
organism that is usually difficult to classify in terms of
proteins, Leptospira interrogans. In addition to the position
of the beginning of the protein (shorter in MTA phosphorylase) residues that are discriminating between general
scavenging purine phosphorylase and MTA phosphorylase are indicated in Figure 2, around the common motif
[FIMLV]-[IV]-X-G-[ST]-G-X16–22-P. Noteworthy features
are the presence of conserved residues in MTA phosphor-

that separated the two classes. The position of the first residue of the alignment shown is displayed in blue. Note that for Synechocystis the published sequence starts earlier, but that the residue indicated is likely to be the real start of the protein.

ylase, that differ from those at the same position in the
other phosphorylases: G upstream of the highly conserved
G-[ST]-G motif and a T is present upstream of the partially
conserved P residue, with a downstream aromatic residue
followed by a G in MTA phosphorylase (respectively L or
I and F in other phosphorylases). The product of the reaction is MTR-1-P, which undergoes further processing as
detailed below.
MTA hydrolysis and methylthioribose phosphorylation
AdoMet-dependent methylases produce AdoHcy, while
aminopropyl-group transfer produces MTA. It was once
thought that the metabolism of AdoHcy was split in various organisms into two alternative pathways [16]: the
molecule was recycled either by AdoHcy hydrolase that
generates homocysteine and adenosine, or by the sequential action of AdoHcy nucleosidase that generates adenine
and S-ribosylhomocysteine, followed by a S-ribosylhomocysteine-cleavage enzyme. The hydrolase has been
now found in many organisms, such as Pseudomonas sp.,
Homo sapiens, L. interrogans, Aquifex sp. and Thermotoga
maritima but it is not present in E. coli nor in Bacillus
subtilis, at least with a related sequence [17].

In E. coli the nucleosidase (coded by gene pfs) has in fact a
lower specificity since it hydrolyses both AdoHcy and
MTA [18]. In B. subtilis it has been experimentally demonstrated that the gene initially termed yrrU has this activity
[19]. The counterpart of this enzyme exists in K. pneumoniae (Figure 3). In many bacteria (including E. coli) the
fate of the MTR thus produced is not known, but the molecule is found to accumulate in the external medium, suggesting the presence of an export system [12]. In B. subtilis
experiments using radioactive labelling have shown that a
kinase exists that transforms MTR into MTR-1-P (Figure
1). It is encoded by a gene belonging to a S-box riboswitch-controlled operon [20,21], ykrT (renamed here
mtnK, see below) [22]. In contrast with the situation in E.
coli, a counterpart of this gene exists in K. pneumoniae (Figure 3), consistent with the existence of a methionine salvage pathway in the latter. Interestingly, this enzyme that
has been crystallized recently [23] does not belong to the
ribo- or deoxyribokinase family, but, rather, to the
choline/ethanolamine kinase family [24].
The elusive dowstream section of the methionine salvage
pathway
It has long been known that MTA, once converted to adenine and MTR-1-P was able to regenerate methionine.
This was found in organisms as distant as H. sapiens or K.
pneumoniae. The overall reaction scheme has been
unraveled by Abeles and coworkers in K. pneumoniae [25].
However, the actual enzymes or genes involved for each
step have not been uncovered in totality. A gene inactivation study in B. subtilis revealed the involvement of several

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/9

genes [26], but the exact nature of the enzymes needed for
each step in this organism was only discovered when
appropriate biochemical experiments were set up [8].
Briefly, the pathway in B. subtilis begins as follows: MTR1-P is converted into MTRu-1-P by the isomerase encoded
by gene ykrS (now mtnA, see new proposed nomenclature
below) [8,22]. Remarkably, it has been observed that this
gene, expressed at a level similar to that of ykrT (mtnK)
[22], codes for a protein with a sequence annotated as
similar to that of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2B (alpha
subunit). Figure 4 shows a high degree of conserved residues in the corresponding alignment with genes from Firmicutes, gamma-proteobacteria, plants and humans.
Interestingly this sequence is similar, especially in its carboxy-terminal end (see the Mus musculus sequence), with
eIF-2B-alpha, but, as can be seen in the Figure, this similarity, although unambiguous, should perhaps not have
been emphasized in genome annotations.
The next step is dehydration of MTRu-1-P by MTRu-1-P
dehydratase encoded by gene ykrY (now mtnB), a member
of operon ykrWXYZ, under the control of an S-box riboswitch [20,21]. The product of the reaction is the diketone
2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate. A counterpart of this gene can be found in many organisms (Figure
5), where it is usually associated to other genes involved
in the pathway. This is the case, for example in K. pneumoniae. In P. aeruginosa, the operon aroC, PA-1682, PA-1683,
PA-1684, mas http://bioinfo.hku.hk/AeruList encodes
proteins similar to chorismate synthase, a metabolite
transporter, MTRu-1-P dehydratase, 1,2-dihydroxy-3keto-5-methylthiopentene dioxygenase and enolasephosphatase, respectively. Indeed, the methionine-auxotroph (metZ [14]) P. aeruginosa strain PAO503, which
grew well on minimal medium E when supplemented
with either methionine, homocysteine or MTA, lost the
ability to use MTA when the mtnB gene (PA-1683) was
inactivated by gene replacement in strain PAO6412 (metZ
mtnB) (Table 1). Thus, in addition to the MTA phosphorylase, P. aeruginosa has an MTRu-1-P dehydratase which
has an essential function in the methionine salvage pathway (Table 1). The MtnB sequence is a member of a large
cluster of proteins that form class II aldolases (COG235,
Pfam0096). Among these enzymes one finds L-ribulose5-phosphate-4-epimerase, suggesting that recognition of
the ribulose backbone is common to a variety of enzymes
of the class. The N-terminal domain of these proteins
form class KOG2631, which appears to overlap exactly
with the dehydratase.
The dehydratase product is further metabolized by 2,3diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate
enolase,
encoded in B. subtilis by gene ykrW (now mtnW). Interestingly, this enzyme is highly similar to RuBisCO [8,26,27].
It produces 2-hydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentenyl-1-

The MTA nucleosidase / MTR kinase pathway in B. subtilis and K. aeruginosa. When the methionine salvage pathway exists, while
the organism does not code for a MTA phosphorylase, the combination of MTA nucleosidase and MTR kinase produce MTR1-P from MTA (Figure 1). B. subtilis (BACSU) and K. pneumoniae (KLEPN) possess this pathway, while E. coli (ESCCO) has only
the nucleosidase. Conservative replacements are shown in blue following Dayhoff's rule [54]. The short protein that may be a

phosphate. At this stage (outcome of the enolase reaction)
2-hydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentenyl-1-phosphate
phosphatase, encoded in B. subtilis by gene ykrX (mtnX),
produces
1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene
(Figure 1).
In other organisms, such as K. pneumoniae, the corresponding enzymes appear usually to consist of a single
enolase-phosphatase, allowing the cell to bypass the last
step. Interestingly, in Arabidopsis thaliana, the protein carrying the dehydratase (Figure 5) is a two-domain protein,
the carboxy-terminal domain coding for the enolasephosphatase (Figure 6). This further substantiates the proposed identification of the corresponding steps in the
pathway. The enolase-phosphatase corresponds to the
KOG family KOG2630. The product of the enolase-phosphatase reaction is then submitted to the action of a dioxygenase, as demonstrated in K. pneumoniae [28]. It has
also been shown that dioxygen is required for the
methionine salvage pathway in B. subtilis [8,26]. The
sequence of the proteins is illustrated in Figure 7. The acireductone dioxygenase that creates 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (KMTB) has counterparts in many Bacteria and
Eukarya, including in mammals, belonging to family
COG1791. It seems to be absent from Archaea. Interestingly Abeles and co-workers discovered that the enzyme
has two activities, depending on its metal co-factor. When
iron was involved, the enzyme produced KMTB, the
immediate precursor of methionine, together with formate. In contrast, when nickel was involved, carbon monoxide was produced in addition to formate, together with
3-methylthiopropionate [29]. The enzyme has been crystallized [30]. In B. subtilis, using palladium salt reduction,
we found that CO was likely to be produced when the
cells were grown in the presence of MTR. A significant difference between the wild type and a mtnD mutant could
be seen: the wild type makes more reducing gasses when
MTR is the sulfur source (16.7 ppm/hour, Table 2). However, B. subtilis produced other reducing gasses as shown
by the presence of a reddish-black hue in the precipitate,
even in the mutant. To test for another possible source of
reducing gasses we investigated reducing gas production
in a yflM mutant. Its gene product, YflM, is highly similar
to an NO synthase. As shown in Table 2, an yflM mutant
produced somewhat less reducing gasses. The amount
produced in our conditions, about 6.7 ppm/hour less
than the wild type in sulfate, and 10 ppm/hour less in
MTR, is however not much higher than the uncertainty of
the experiment (ca 5 ppm/hour). In this background, the
effect of MTR was still visible and significant as compared
to growth with sulfate as sulfur source (13.4 ppm/hour).
However a significant level of palladium precipitation
remains in these mutants. The background level found in
the absence of bacteria was of the order of 12.5 ppm/hour.
Other gasses such as methanethiol and hydrogen sulfide

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/9

are likely to contribute to the reducing power of the
organism.
When MTA is recycled, the two last steps of the methionine salvage pathway appear to be common to all organisms that grow in the presence of dioxygen. The
counterpart of the dioxygenase is not known in organisms
that live under anaerobic growth conditions. KMTB is
transaminated to methionine. There are many analogs of
the final aminotransferase, however they can more or less
complement one another (as is often the case with aminoacid aminotransferases, see e.g. [31]). In B. subtilis,
putative aspartate aminotransferases, the yugH, ywfG,
ykrV, aspB, and patA gene products, have been cloned,
expressed, and characterized for methionine regeneration
activity. In this family, only YkrV (encoded by ykrV, adjacent to the ykrWXYZ operon) was able to convert KMTB to
methionine, and it catalyzed the reaction only when
glutamine was used as amino donor [32]. This suggests a
link with nitrogen metabolism, substantiating our previous observations [33]. However the bulk of the activity
resulted from transaminase YbgE, using either branched
chain aminoacids or phenylalanine or tyrosine as donors
could also perform a similar reaction [32]. In K.
pneumoniae it is the same enzyme that makes methionine
from KMTB and tyrosine from its ketoacid precursor [34].
Nomenclature
We propose the following nomenclature, taking into consideration previous names of some of the genes, as well as
previous usage of names for some other groups of genes,
trying to avoid naming conflicts. The acronym "mtn" (for
methylthionucleoside) will be used.

Because the early steps are variable, we shall use as a mnemonic the capital letter of the enzyme's name, following
Demerec's rule. Thus, mtnN will code for MTA nucleosidase, mtnK will code for MTR kinase, mtnP will code for
MTA phosphorylase.
Considering that the common part of the pathway starts
with MTR-1-P, we shall name the following genes sequentially: mtnA will code for MTR-1-P isomerase (ykrS in B.
subtilis) and mtnB will code for MTRu-1-P dehydratase
(ykrY).
In B. subtilis, the pathway is probably unusual, with mtnW
(ykrW) coding for the enolase and mtnX (ykrX) for the
phosphatase creating 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene. In other organisms, this step is performed by an
enolase-phosphatase, encoded by gene mtnC, while mtnD
(ykrZ) codes for the aci-reductone dioxygenase.

that it is not possible to distinguish between purely black and reddish

exists as a specific enzyme. The pathway with this nomenclature is summarized in Figure 1.

Discussion
The beginning of the methionine salvage pathway is variable, even in phylogenetically related organisms. It can
either correspond to the tandem reactions, MTA nucleosidase/MTR kinase (as in B. subtilis or K. pneumoniae) or start
with MTA phosphorylase as in P. aeruginosa, many
Eukarya or presumably in T. tengcongensis, a Firmicute living at high temperature in partially anaerobic conditions.
The pathway can further vary at the level of enolase, with
either an enolase (RuBisCO-like) and a phosphatase (in
B. subtilis, B. cereus and B. anthracis, for example), or, more
often, with an enolase-phosphatase as in a variety of
organisms, including many Bacteria (e.g. P. aeruginosa),
Plants and Animals (Figure 1). An explicit substantiation
of this latter pathway can be seen in A. thaliana where gene
At5g53850 codes for a protein made of two domains, similar to KOG2631 and KOG2630, with proposed activities
of the Class II aldolases and enolase-phosphatases. We do
not discuss here the case of Archaea because, although
there seems to be a clear counterpart of the methionine
salvage pathway, starting from MTA phosphorolysis [27],
no clearcut biochemical data are yet available, while the
last step (dioxygenase) is probably missing or altered to
another type of reaction (many Archaea are strict
anaerobes).
In order to further support our description of the pathway
we extrapolated from the B. subtilis data to other genomes,
based on chromosome neighborhood [35] (Figure 8).
Here we discuss four cases: K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa,
Xylella fastidiosa, L. interrogans and T. tengcongensis.

Most of the methionine salvage pathway has been uncovered in K. pneumoniae by the biochemical studies of Abeles
and coworkers [25,28,29]. It was therefore interesting to
identify the genes corresponding to the pathway. A complete genome sequence is known but not publicly
available, while the K. pneumoniae genome programme at
Washington University is still ongoing. We could however
identify the genes for a complete methionine salvage
pathway, which begins as in B. subtilis (MTA nucleosidase
followed by MTR kinase), but differs at the level of the
enolase-phosphatase step (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6).
In contrast with the behavior of K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa codes for an MTA phosphorylase. Gene PA-3004,
located downstream from nagZ (coding for N-acetyl-Dglucosaminidase) and perhaps from transcriptional regulator gene psrA, corresponds to mtnP. Operon aroC(PA1681)-PA-1682-PA-1683-PA-1684-masA(PA-1685)
is
likely to code for the core of the pathway in which PA1682 has an unknown transport function, whereas PA1683(mtnB), PA-1684(mtnD) and PA-1685(mtnC) correspond to the enzymatic steps described above. Finally,
mtnA corresponds to gene PA-3169, possibly the first gene
of a large mixed-function cluster mtnA-gyrA-serC-pheAtyrB-aroE-cmk-rpsA-himD. This cluster is also involved in
biosynthesis of aromatic molecules, and the gene tyrB
coding for a wide spectrum aminotransferase is probably
involved in KMTB transamination, as is its counterpart is
in K. pneumoniae [34]. As a support to this analysis, both
mtnP and mtnB mutants of P. aeruginosa could not grow
on MTA as a sulfur source.
In X. fastidiosa a cluster of genes, presumably constituting
an operon, is consistent with the existence of a complete
methionine salvage pathway. This operon "serA-xf-2207xf-2208-xf-2209-xf-2210-xf-2211-xf-2212" would code for
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (serine and
one-carbon metabolism), subunits of a transporter, mtnB,
mtnD, mtnC and a short fragment (N-terminus) of mtnK,
respectively (Figure 3). A second gene cluster "xf-2555-xf2554-mtnA-gyrA-xf-2551" codes for a tRNA synthetase, a
protein of unknown function, mtnA, DNA gyrase and a
protein of unknown function found in plants. There exists
also a clear counterpart of mtnP (xf-2353, see Figure 2).
This gene belongs to an operon (xf-2358->xf-2352), coding for an RNA methylase, a putative membrane protein
highly conserved in cyanobacteria or bacteria associated
to plants, a very short protein with similar sequence found
in
plants,
a
cell
wall
hydrolase,
purine
phosphoribosyltransferase, MtnP and a cold-shock-like
protein. This operon is, at least in part, consistent with
MTA and/or S-adenosylhomocysteine production and
phosphorolysis. In particular, the first gene product
would produce the latter molecule, while the phosphoribosyltransferase could scavenge adenine or a derivative.

Thus, X. fastidiosa has all genes needed for a functional
methionine salvage pathway. The truncated form of mtnK
suggests that the core metabolic genes might have been
obtained by horizontal gene transfer [36], and that MtnK
was useless in the presence of a functional MtnP. Presence
of a gene coding for spermidine synthase (xf-0143) as well
as a counterpart of AdoMet decarboxylase (xf-1539) indicates that the substrate, MTA, is indeed synthesized in X.
fastidiosa. The similarity between the steps of the methionine salvage pathway in K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and
X. fastidiosa suggests that similar pathways will be found
in many gamma-proteobacteria.
Leptospira interrogans genome annotation has been particularly difficult because the majority of the genes present in
this organism are only poorly related to known genes in
other organisms. Indeed, the annotated genome contains
a large number of small putative genes that may not really
be coding DNA sequences [37]. This prompted us to
explore the presence of a methionine salvage pathway in
this organism. In order to have better chances to find the
genes of the pathway, we started by looking for
counterparts of the first gene in the pathway, mtnA. There
is a clear counterpart, LA2868, in L. interrogans (Figure 3),
as an isolated gene in chromosome I. The gene for the
phosphorylase with clear features (molecular footprint)
of MTA phosphorylase (Figure 2), mtnP (LA4248), is also
present as an isolated gene in the same chromosome. In
chromosome II, operon LB294-LB293-LB292-fabG codes
for translation factor EFP, MtnD, MtnB and a putative
oxoacyl-ACP-reductase. The last enzyme required for the
pathway is the enolase-phosphatase (MtnC): it is encoded
in an operon present in chromosome I "LA0931-LA0930LA0929-LA0928". The first gene codes for a peptide that
could have a regulatory role, the following gene codes for
a permease, then we find mtnC (Figure 5). The operon
ends with a gene coding for a short peptide that could
have features of transcriptional regulators. This indicates
that L. interrogans most probably has the complete
methionine salvage pathway. Interestingly, this organism
has two counterparts of spermidine synthase (one on each
chromosome), enzymes that should result in the production of MTA. Gene LB312, on the second chromosome
could be the counterpart of speD in this genome.
Finally, we tried to explore the pathway in T. tengcongensis,
because although similar to B. subtilis, this organism
thrives mostly under anaerobic conditions. In T. tengcongensis the phosphorylase would be encoded in a large cluster (either continuous or split into two operons: tte1584<-tte-1594) "ileS-ssnA-araD-tdh2-gcn3-cbiO2-cbiQ2pnp2-tte-1586" upstream of "metC3-tte-1584". Both parts
of this cluster, typical of a "sulfur island" [38], are preceded by a S-box riboswitch [20,21]. Because of the consistency of the functions encoded in this cluster it is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/9

possible that ileS has been mistakenly thought to code for
isoleucine tRNA synthetase, but rather codes for methionine tRNA synthetase (both enzymes are usually
extremely similar). Because annotations are often propagated by similarity only, it would be most interesting to
check experimentally whether this enzyme is an authentic
methionine tRNA synthetase. If this were the case, this
should prompt reanalysis and annotation of the whole
class of cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine and
valine tRNA synthetases. The second gene could code for
a metal-dependent hydrolase, probably hydrolyzing C-N
bonds. The third gene, in the present context, is mtnB, tdh2
could code for a metal-dependent enolase (differing from
its counterpart in other organisms, hence tentatively
named mtnY, but this has to be substantiated experimentally), gcn3 is mtnA, the next two genes are divalent metal
transporters, followed by mtnP, while the last gene could
code for a component of a transporter. Thus the operon
would be "S-box-metS-ssnA-mtnB-tte-1591(mtnY)-mtnAcbiO2-cbiQ2-mtnP-tte-1586". For this organism, it is
unlikely that a dioxygenase belongs to the pathway,
because it lives mostly in the absence of oxygen. Indeed,
we do not find a clear counterpart of mtnD. Starting from
the end of the pathway we find that a broad-spectrum
aminotransferase (labelled hisC, tte-0380) belongs to a
large cluster mostly devoted to divalent-metal transport
and synthesis of coenzyme B12, with two unknown genes
tte-0378 and tte-0379. Coenzyme B12 is often involved in
pathways operating under anaerobic conditions and this
should prompt further studies of the methionine salvage
pathway under these conditions (T. tengcongensis, that
belongs to Bacteria, might provide a missing link to
explore the pathway in Archaea).
Sulfur metabolism has probably to be compartmentalized, because of the extreme reactivity of this atom
towards dioxygen and radicals. In this respect, it is
interesting to observe that, despite their apparent variety
of origins, genes of the methionine salvage pathway have
a tendency to cluster into operons (translation products of
neighboring cistrons are produced in close proximity in
the cell), or even fuse and give multidomain proteins (this
is frequent in eukaryotes [39]). Another case of gene
fusion that might be related to comparmentalization of
sulfur containing molecules can be seen in Aquifex aeoliqus
where the MtnA protein begins with a domain of
unknown function:
MDIRTHLGINQELSGKPVKVAEGYAEVLLKTQESMKADDKGLVHGGFIFSAADYA
SMLAVNHPNVVLAGANVKFLKPVKVGDEIICKARVSEDKGKKKKVLVECFKGEDKVFEGEFFTVFLID
that represents a whole COG domain, COG2050.1, PaaI.
This domain has a signature for sulfur metabolite binding.

BMC Microbiology 2004, 4

This further substantiates the idea that sulfur metabolism
is compartmentalized.
Finally it was interesting to note that B. subtilis, when in
the presence of significant amounts of MTR, was likely to
produce CO, that may act as a gaseous mediator. This is
the more interesting because B. cereus and B. anthracis possess the same methionine salvage pathway as B. subtilis.
Furthermore, because this pathway exists in humans, it
may be relevant to the ongoing discussion about the role
of CO as a neuronal or gastro-intestinal mediator [40,41].
Analysis of similar arrangements in other genomes will
lead to recognition of new features of the genetics of
microbial sulfur metabolism.

Conclusions
The MTA => methionine salvage pathway is present in
many Bacteria. This pathway provides us with a remarkable example of enzyme recruitment in bacteria associated
to their biotope. Indeed the enolase-phosphatase step in
the pathway is performed by enzymes of entirely different
descent, RuBisCO being the most puzzling example. In
the same way it seems quite remarkable that a family of
GTP binding proteins, previously shown to be involved in
translation elongation, universally belong to this pathway
(MtnA). It will be an interesting link to compare the reactions in anaerobic environments. This will teach us how
we could modify enzyme activities in the future and
reprogram biochemical processes.

Methods
Genetic and biochemical experiments
Growth conditions
The following B. subtilis strains were used in this work: the
wild type strain 168 [42], BFS1853 (mtnD(ykrZ)::lacZ)
and BFS4605 (yflM::lacZ). These strains have been constructed during the B. subtilis functional analysis program
(http://locus.jouy.inra.fr/cgi-bin/genmic/madbase/progs/
madbase.operl and http://bacillus.genome.ad.jp[26,43]).
Escherichia coli strains were grown either on LB or on nutrient yeast broth (NYB) liquid or agar plates at 37°C. B. subtilis was grown in ED minimal medium: K2HPO4, 8 mM;
KH2PO4, 4.4 mM; glucose, 27 mM; Na3-citrate, 0.3 mM; Lglutamine, 15 mM; L-tryptophan, 0.244 mM; ferric citrate,
33.5 µM; MgSO4, 2 mM; MgCl2, 0.61 mM; CaCl2, 49.5
µM; FeCl3, 49.9 µM; MnCl2, 5.05 µM; ZnCl2, 12.4 µM;
CuCl2, 2.52 µM; CoCl2, 2.5 µM; Na2MoO4, 2.48 µM at
37°C. To assay for CO production, ED minimal medium
plates were used with either a MgSO4 containing medium
or a sulfur-free basal medium (where MgSO4 was replaced
by MgCl2 at 2 mM concentration). In the latter case, 10 µl
of the sulfur source under investigation (MTR, 200 mM
stock solution) was applicated onto paper discs deposited
at the center of the plate, after bacteria had been uniformly spread on the surface of the plate. All experiments

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/9

were performed in accordance with the European regulation requirements concerning the contained use of Genetically Modified Organisms of Group-I (French agreement
N°2735). P. aeruginosa strains were routinely grown in
NYB or on nutrient agar plates at 37°C. When required,
antibiotics were added to media at the following concentrations: tetracycline (Tc), 25 µg ml-1 (E. coli) or 125 µg ml1 (P. aeruginosa); kanamycin (Km), 50 µg ml-1 (E. coli);
ampicillin (Ap), 100 µg ml-1 (E. coli); spectinomycin (Sp),
25 µg ml-1 (E. coli) or 1,000 µg ml-1 (P. aeruginosa); erythromycin plus lincomycin, 1 µg ml-1 and 25 µg ml-1 (B.
subtilis). To counterselect E. coli S17-1 donor cells in matings with P. aeruginosa for gene replacement, chloramphenicol was used at a concentration of 10 µg ml-1;
mutant enrichment experiments were performed with
tetracycline at a final concentration of 20 µg ml-1 and
carbenicillin at a final concentration of 2,000 µg ml-1.
Strain PAO503 and its derivatives were cultivated in NYB,
washed and plated out on minimal medium E; 50 µl of
methionine, homocysteine or MTA (50 mM each) were
then spotted onto sterile filters placed on the bacterial
lawn. Growth around the filters was scored after 18 h of
incubation. The optical density (OD) of bacterial cultures
was measured at 600 nm.
DNA manipulation and cloning procedures
Small- and large-scale preparations of plasmid DNA were
carried out by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) method [44] and with JetStar columns
(Genomed,
Basel,
Switzerland),
respectively.
Chromosomal DNA was purified from P. aeruginosa with
phenol:chloroform (1:1) by a method described previously [45]. Restriction enzyme digestions, PCR, ligation,
agarose gel electrophoresis, and electroporation were performed using standard procedures [46,47]. For Southern
blotting, chromosomal DNA was digested overnight with
the appropriate enzymes, electrophoresed on a 0.8%
agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Labeling of DNA probes,
hybridization and detection were performed using the
digoxigenin (DIG) DNA Labeling and Detection Kit
(Roche) according to the manufacturer's procedures.
Nucleotide sequences of PCR-derived constructs were
determined on both strands with a dye terminator kit
(Perkin-Elmer product 402080) and an ABI Prism 373
sequencer.
Construction of P. aeruginosa mutant strains
For the construction of strain PAO6412 (metZ9011
mtnB::Ω-Sp/Sm), the mtnB gene (= PA1683) was PCRamplified using PAO1 genomic DNA as a template and
primers
PA1683-1
(5'-AAAAGAATTCTGCACCTGGAATCGCTGGG-3') and PA1683-2 (5'-AAAAGGATCCCGGTGCTCGTCGAGGAACTTG-3'), tagged with EcoRI
and BamHI artificial sites (italics), respectively. The mtnB

Figure of gene organisation for the methionine salvage pathway in different bacteria
Variety 8
Variety of gene organisation for the methionine salvage pathway in different bacteria. The organisation of the genes coding for
the methionine salvage pathway is shown in several bacteria: B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, X. fastidiosa, L. interrogans and T. tencongensis. The pathway is as described in Figure 1. Genes with the same function are indicated with the same color code. When a
gene arrow is broken, this indicates that the function is the same, but that the gene product differs (enolase (MtnW) and phosphatase (MtnX) in B. subtilis, vs enolase-phosphatase (MtnC) in other organisms). The stem and loop symbol indicates the presence of a S-box riboswitch. In B. subtilis the enolase-phosphatase activity found in other organisms is replaced by two enzymes,
a RuBisCO-like enolase and a phosphatase. In X. fastidiosa, downstream of the main operon on can see a truncated form of
mtnK (broken arrow) requiring the presence of mtnP instead.

gene was interrupted by a spectinomycin-streptomycin
resistance cassette (Ω-Sp/Sm) integrated as a 2-kb SmaI
fragment into the SmaI site of mtnB; the resulting 3.3-kb
EcoRI-XbaI fragment containing mtnB::Ω-Sp/Sm was
inserted into the suicide plasmid pME3087 [48] to generate pME3880. This plasmid was mobilized into PAO503
(metZ9011) by the donor E. coli S17-1 (thi pro hsdR recA/
RP4-2 Tc::Mu Km::Tn7) and chromosomally integrated
with selection for tetracycline resistance. Excision of the
pME3087 carrying mtnB by a second crossover was
obtained by enrichment for tetracycline-sensitive cells
[49]. The tetracycline-sensitive, spectinomycin-resistant

clones (containing mtnB::Ω-Sp/Sm) were checked by
Southern blotting (data not shown).
For the construction of strain PAO6422 (metZ9011
mtnP::Ω-Sp/Sm), the mtnP gene (= PA3004) was PCRamplified with primers PA3004-1 (5'-AAAAGGATCCGTCGAAGGCGGTTTCGAC-3')
and
PA3004-2
(5'AAAAAAGCTTCATGTGGCGATTCCCGAAGAC-3') containing artificial sites for BamHI and HindIII (italics). To
generate pME3891, the 2-kb SmaI fragment containing
the Ω-Sp/Sm cassette was integrated into the EcoRV site of
mtnP and the resulting 3.3-kb KpnI-XbaI fragment carrying

mtnP::Ω-Sp/Sm was inserted into the suicide plasmid
pME3087. The resulting plasmid (pME3891) was delivered to the chromosome of PAO503 as described above,
resulting in strain PAO6422, which was checked by
Southern hybridization as above.
Preparation of MTR and CO assays
Methylthioribose (MTR) was prepared from MTA (Sigma,
D5011) by acid hydrolysis as described by Schlenk et al.
[50]. The CO production assay was carried using the
GASTEC No.1DL dosimeters (Carbon Monoxide Low
Range Passive Dosi-Tubes, Gastec Corporation, Japan). To
detect CO production the ED minimal medium plates of
150 mm diameter were inoculated with bacteria and the
dosimeter was activated by breaking the tube at its score.
Plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 hrs and readings
were recorded after the end of incubation period. Comparison of replicates of the same experiment (same volume of the growth medium, same temperature, same
incubation time) indicated that the level of significance
was better than 5 ppm. Control and MTR experiments
were performed on the same day. It is not possible, however, to separate the nature of the different reducing gasses
from the production of palladium metal precipitates. Replicates of the experiment on plates without bacteria gave
an average level of reducing gasses of ca 12.5 ppm/h.
Computer-mediated analyses
Data were extracted from the microbial genome databases
set up at http://bioinfo.hku.hk/genolist.html, using the
following databases with their imbedded BLAST browsers
and searching using appropriate patterns ("search patterns") when appropriate: AeruList, LeptoList, ThermaList
and XylelList. For B. subtilis, the reference database was
used: http://genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList. Analyses of
domains were performed using "CD-search" at the NCBI
[51]. Annotations were used with the help of SwissProt
[52]. Alignments were performed using CLUSTALW and
further refined manually [53].
