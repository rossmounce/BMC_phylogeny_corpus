Mating system drives negative associations
between morphological features in
Schistosomatidae
Sophie Beltran1*, Yves Desdevises2, Julien Portela1, Jérôme Boissier1*

Abstract
Background: Sexual morphological features are known to be associated with the mating systems of several animal
groups. However, it has been suggested that morphological features other than sexual characteristics could also be
constrained by the mating system as a consequence of negative associations. Schistosomatidae are parasitic
organisms that vary in mating system and can thus be used to explore links between the mating system and
negative associations with morphological features.
Results: A comparative analysis of Schistosomatidae morphological features revealed an association between the
mating system (monogamous versus polygynandrous) and morphological characteristics of reproduction, nutrition,
and locomotion.
Conclusions: The mating system drives negative associations between somatic and sexual morphological features.
In monogamous species, males display a lower investment in sexual tissues and a higher commitment of resources
to tissues involved in female transport, protection, and feeding assistance. In contrast, males of polygynandrous
species invest to a greater extent in sexual tissues at the cost of reduced commitment to female care.

Background
A mating system reflects the manner in which members
of an animal society are structured with respect to sexual behaviour. Three mating systems are generally
recognised: monogamy, polygamy, and polygynandry (or
promiscuity). In monogamous species, males and
females have only one sexual partner at any given time.
In polygamous species, one male has a mating relationship with several females (i.e., polygyny) or one female
has a mating relationship with several males (i.e., polyandry). Finally, polygynandry is a mating system in
which any male mates with any female. Specific morphological features are known to be associated with the
mating systems of several animal groups, including
primates [1,2], bats [3], birds [4-6], rodents [7],
teleost fishes [8], amphibians [9], and insects [10,11].
Logically, as a consequence of sexual selection, such

morphological features mainly involve primary or
secondary sexual characteristics. However, it has been
suggested that morphological features other than such
characteristics could also be constrained by the mating
system, reflecting evolutionary trade-offs between effective mating and bodily phenotype [3]. Previous authors
indicated that males of bat species with mating systems
based on female promiscuity had smaller brains and larger testes, whereas species with mating systems involving female fidelity were endowed with larger brains and
smaller testes. This pattern was interpreted as an investment trade-off between two metabolically expensive
organs [3]. Such an “expensive sexual tissue” hypothesis
proposes that more intense sexual selection will affect
the evolution of energy-demanding tissue and associated
functions as a result of negative association with costly
sexual organs, ornaments or armaments [3]. Although
this hypothesis has been proven in bats [3], no such link
has been demonstrated in mammals [12].
Schistosomes (Trematoda: Schistosomatidae) are
endoparasites of birds and mammals [13]. The ~100
species of schistosomes are unusual among the ~18,000

species of the subclass Digenea because, unlike other
digeneans (which are usually hermaphroditic), schistosomes are of two separate sexes. More importantly,
schistosomes are the only parasitic organisms that show
variability in mating systems. Three such systems have
been identified in these worms [14]: (1) Monogamy
occurs in ~30 species and, in these species, worm pairs
consisting of only one female and only one male can be
observed either in vivo or after experimental recovery.
Moreover, the monogamous female needs the continuous presence of a male to maintain sexual activity, making monogamy compulsory. However, monogamy does
not imply faithfulness. Mate changes can occur, as have
been shown in the genus Schistosoma [15,16]; this
means that schistosomes are socially but not genetically
monogamous [17]. (ii) Polygyny occurs in ~4 species
and, in these species, one male monopolizes more than
one female, with other males having no access to these
females. (iii) Polygynandry occurs in ~66 species; males
and females are never seen in copula in vivo (i.e., males
and females mate with several partners of the opposite
sex over a given period of time). In contrast to monogamous female schistosomes, polygynandrous females are
able to attain sexual maturity and to lay eggs even if a
male is not continuously present [18]. Schistosomes are
therefore the only parasitic organisms that can be used
to explore possible links between a chosen mating system and a negative association with a morphological
feature. The goals of the present work are (i) to determine if, as a consequence of mate competition, male
polygynandrous schistosomes invest more energy (as
measured by testis size) in their reproductive organs
than do monogamous males; and (ii) to establish
whether any negative association between investment in

sexual and somatic tissues can be identified. Our prediction was that the larger the investment in sexual tissue,
the smaller would be the investment in locomotor and
nutritive functions, as measured by relative sucker size
and oesophagus length, respectively.

Methods
Data collection

A total of 28 species were included in this study, a number that is limited by DNA sequence information
required for the phylogenetic reconstruction used in the
comparative analyses. Nineteen species from six genera
are monogamous, and nine species from six genera are
polygynandrous. DNA sequence information is available
for only two polygynous species, which were therefore
not included in the analysis. Data on morphological features were collected from published parasite descriptions; these measurements are summarized in
Additional file 1, Table S1. The surface area of each
organ was calculated from the length (l) and the width
(w) of the organ using the ellipsis surface area formula
(l × w × π/4). The relative organ length is the length of
the organ divided by the body length, and the relative
organ surface area is the surface area of the organ
divided by the body surface area. We identified three
groups of morphological features according to their
functions (Figure 1):
1. The “reproduction group” constitutes sexual morphological features of female and male schistosomes. For
females, we recorded the relative seminal receptacle surface area (seminal receptacle surface area divided by the
total surface area of the body) and the relative ovary
length (ovary length divided by the overall length of the
body). For males, we determined the number of testes,

Beltran et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:245

and measured the relative seminal vesicle surface area
(seminal vesicle surface area divided by the total surface
area of the body) and relative testes surface area (total
testes surface area divided by body surface area). We
also recorded the relative male gynecophoral canal
length (length of the gynecophoral canal divided by the
overall length of the body). The gynecophoral canal is a
groove on the ventral surface of the male in which the
female is held during copulation.
2. The “nutrition group” constitutes somatic morphological features of female and male schistosomes
involved in nutrition. For males and females, we
recorded the relative oesophagus length (oesophagus
length divided by the overall length of the body), which
has implications for the transport of food toward gut
caecae.
3. The “locomotion group” contains somatic morphological features of female and male schistosomes
involved in locomotion. Schistosomes, like all digeneans,
possess an oral sucker and a ventral sucker, or acetabulum. Locomotion is achieved by alternate attachment of
the suckers on internal host surfaces [19]. For males
and females, we measured relative oral and ventral
sucker surface areas (sucker surface area divided by the
total surface area of the body). We also computed male/
female relative sucker-surface-area ratios.
Note that, in addition to its inclusion in the reproduction group, the male gynecophoral canal could appear in
all three morphological groups because of its potential
involvement in female nutrition (through transtegumental transfer of substances) [20], female sexual maturation
[21], female locomotion [22] and possibly mate guarding
and female protection against the host immune system
[14,23].
Comparative analyses

To control for phylogeny, we performed a phylogenetic
reconstruction among the Schistosomatidae species
using published DNA sequences of complete 18S and
28S rDNA genes, and a partial sequence of the cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) mtDNA gene (see Additional
file 2, Table S1). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT,
version 5 [24,25], and were improved by eye using Se-Al
v2.0a11 [26]. After deleting ambiguous regions from the
alignments, the final lengths of DNA sequences were
1653 bp (18S), 3741 bp (28S) and 1095 bp (CO1).
Because not all species investigated were sequenced for
all genes used, we constructed trees from the various
datasets and combined these source trees via a supertree
with the aid of Rainbow [27], using matrix representation with parsimony and the Baum [28] and Ragan [29]
coding scheme [30,31]. The combined matrix was subjected to a parsimony analysis with the heuristic algorithm implemented in PAUP*, using 10 random

Page 3 of 8

addition replicates and the tree bisection-reconnection
branch-swapping algorithm [32]. Source trees were built
via Bayesian analysis with MrBayes 3.1.2 [33] by running
four chains of 106 generations. The best evolutionary
models were chosen by applying a hierarchical likelihood-ratio test using MrModelTest 2.2 [34] for the
rDNA sequences, and applying a mixed model to translated mtDNA sequences. The burn-in value was set to
20% of the sampled trees (1% of the number of generations). Following Loker and Brant [13], Griphobilharzia
amoena was used as the outgroup.
Comparisons of morphological features in relation
to monogamous versus polygynandrous mating
system were analyzed statistically using non-parametric
Mann-Whitney U-tests. We also performed variation
partitioning [35,36] of these morphological features
between historical (phylogeny) and potentially adaptive
(mating system) components. The objective of this analysis is to estimate the fraction of the variation linked to
the mating system (the potentially adaptive component),
the fraction linked to phylogeny (the historical component), and the fraction linked to both phylogeny and the
mating system (the overlap between the two components) for each morphological trait examined. This partitioning technique allows the user to compute the
fraction of the variation of the response variable due to
each explanatory trait under study (here, mating system
and phylogenetic effects) while controlling other(s). This
leads to “pure” fractions (here, fractions explained only
by the mating system or only by the phylogeny), as well
as a common fraction of the variation due simultaneously to both independent traits. We stress that this
common fraction (here, the joint variation explained by
mating system and phylogeny) is not equivalent to an
interaction term in an analysis of variance. This overlap
is usually considered to be phylogenetic niche conservatism (sensu Grafen [37]), reflecting the fact that the
putative effect of the mating system on morphological
features is intermingled with phylogenetic effects if species with the same mating system are closely related.
Such variation in decomposition requires the quantification of trait variation due to phylogeny alone. This precludes the use of classical comparative methods, such as
independent contrasts [38,39], because such methods
cannot quantify phylogenetic inertia per se (see [40]).
Here, the expression of the phylogenetic variance is carried out via a principal coordinate analysis on the distance matrix computed from the phylogenetic tree of
the species considered. A few principal coordinates were
chosen using a broken-stick model [41] to account for
phylogeny. Details of the partitioning method used,
which is based on the combination of R2 values resulting from different regressions, can be found in Desdevises et al. [35] and Cubo et al. [42]. Adjusted R2 values,

which have been shown to be better in a variation-partitioning context, were used here [43]. Principal coordinate analyses were performed using DistPCoA [44].
Variation partitioning and tests of significance of the
fractions were computed using the functions “varpart”
and “anova.cca” from the “vegan” library [45] of the
R statistical language (R Development Core Team 2008;
R: a language and environment for statistical computing.

URL http://www.R-project.org). All tests were performed
using permutational procedures (9999 permutations/
test). The mating system was coded as a binary variable
(0/1). In the phylogeny obtained (see below), species
were split into two clades–one containing the monogamous species, and the other containing the polygynandrous species. This design does not allow a proper test
of whether a transition toward a given mating system is
associated with a change in a morphological feature,
because the most parsimonious explanation suggests
that only one transition in mating system occurred (see
[46]). We then computed the principal coordinates
within each monophyletic group to test if having a certain mating system is related to modifications in given
morphological features, while taking phylogeny into
account.

length, were significantly linked to the mating system,
with R 2 values greater than 0.4 (i.e., explaining more
than 40% of the variance). Females of monogamous species displayed relatively lower seminal receptacle surface
areas than did polygynandrous females. However, no
significant association was found between this variable
and the chosen mating system. Similarly, no difference
in relative ovary length among females differing in mating system was observed.
Turning to the “nutrition group” of features
(Figure 3B), both males and females of polygynandrous
species displayed longer relative oesophagus lengths
than did monogamous species. Variation-partitioning
analysis suggested that this morphological feature was
significantly linked to the mating system, in both sexes.
In the “locomotion group” of features (Figure 3C),
males of monogamous species displayed a higher relative
sucker surface area than did males of polygynandrous
species. There was no difference in sucker surface area
between females of monogamous and polygynandrous
species. Comparative analyses suggested a significant
effect of mating system only on the male/female relative
sucker surface area ratio. Thus, sexual dimorphism in
sucker surface area was greater in monogamous than in
polygynandrous species.

Results

Discussion
It is now well established that, as a consequence of
sperm competition, males displaying promiscuous sexual
behaviour need to invest more energy in the reproductive organs than do monogamous males [47]. Such a
link has been shown in primate, bird, rodent, amphibian,
and insect species, and also between different populations of the same species [47]. In parasitic organisms, an
impact of sexual selection on morphological features has
been demonstrated in polygamous acanthocephalans
[48]. In the cited study, it was shown that investment in
testicular volume was related to the intensity of malemale competition. Our present work provides the first
evidence from a parasitic organism showing that the
development of sexual tissue is dependent on the mating system, with polygynandrous male schistosomes
investing more energy in reproductive organs (measured
by testis size) than do monogamous males. Literature
reports on the link between accessory gland size and
sperm competition level are few. Recently, it was shown
in rodents that the masses of both the seminal vesicle
and the anterior lobe of the prostate vary positively with
testis weight [7]. Without controlling for phylogeny, we
found a similar link between the relative testis and vesicle surface areas in males and the associated relative
seminal receptacle surface area in females. Unfortunately, variation-partitioning tests did not show any
effect of mating system on the sizes of these accessory

Phylogeny

The supertree analysis led to 14 equally parsimonious
trees that were combined by consensus into a majority
rule. The consensus was congruent with the tree
obtained from phylogenetic analysis of 28s rDNA
sequences. Because branch lengths were desirable for
the subsequent statistical analysis, based on this phylogenetic tree, we then kept this 28S rDNA tree, where
we collapsed some clades as polytomies as obtained in
the supertree consensus, and added the taxa from which
28S rDNA sequences were missing (Schistosoma guineensis, S. edwardiense, S. hippopotami) (Figure 2).
Branch lengths for these three species were estimated
from the phylogenetic analysis based on CO1 mtDNA
gene, and resized to be coherent with the lengths computed from the 28S rDNA analysis. This tree was used
for the variation partitioning analyses.
Comparative analyses

In the “reproduction group” of features (Figure 3A),
males in monogamous species possessed fewer testes,
showed lower relative surface areas of both testes and
seminal vesicles, but had higher relative gynecophoral
canal lengths than did males of polygynandrous species.
Both the variation-partitioning mating system and phylogenic analyses showed that all of relative testis surface
area, testis number, and relative gynecophoral canal

sex organs, suggesting that more species need to be
included in future analysis.
The gynecophoral canal, a ventral groove in which the
female resides, is a male secondary sexual characteristic
specific to Schistosomatidae. We found that monogamous male schistosomes had gynecophoral canals 7-fold
longer than those of polygynandrous males (90% vs. 12%
of total body length), a difference that can be fully
explained by variation in mating systems. When such
systems were not considered in previous studies, a negative association was observed between the size of the
gynecophoral canal and the number of testes [49]. The
level of paternal investment is known to be associated
with the mating system [50], and it is generally accepted
that the male makes a lower investment in the system
when successful paternity is less likely [51]. Thus, if the
gynecophoral canal represents a paternal investment, as

has indeed been proposed [49], it seems logical that
monogamous male schistosomes, which make a greater
investment than do polygynandrous males, should possess longer canals.
In Schistosomatidae, the gonado-somatic index (i.e.,
the relative testis surface area) ranges from 3-24%
depending on whether the mating system is monogamous or polygynandrous. By comparison, testis mass as
a percentage of body weight ranges from 0.12-8.4% in
bats and from 0.02-0.75% in primates [3]. It might be
expected that more energy is invested in testicular tissue, which is energetically demanding [52], less energy
is available for other tissues and functions. The present
study shows that if monogamous male Schistosomatidae
have a lower relative testis surface area than do polygynandrous males, the relative sucker surface area is larger
and the relative oesophagus length smaller.

Suckers are very important organs in digeneans
because the suckers allow migration and fixation of the
worm in the definitive host. In addition, because Schistosomatidae are endoparasites that live in the veins of
birds or mammals, the organisms must be capable of
resisting blood flow. Our present work showed that relative sucker dimorphism was greater in monogamous
than in polygynandrous species. This difference is a consequence of a higher relative sucker surface area in
monogamous males compared to polygynandrous males,
rather than a variation in relative female sucker surface
area. More precisely, no difference was apparent in relative sucker surface area between monogamous females
and polygynandrous male or female parasites (0.410.58% of body surface area when both suckers were considered). Only monogamous males displayed expanded
relative sucker surface areas (1.83% and 3.28% of body
surface area for the oral and ventral suckers, respectively). This can be explained by the fact that, in monogamous species, the male parasite must maintain and
transport its female to egg-laying sites. In contrast,
females of polygynandrous species must travel and resist
blood flow alone.
Schistosomes ingest red blood cells (the principal diet)
using negative pressure created by contraction of the oral
sucker muscle and the esophagus [53]. We found that

the oesophagus of both male and female polygynandrous
parasites was longer than that of monogamous males and
females. With polygynandrous males, it may be assumed
that the need to produce numerous spermatozoids
requires high-level nutrient intake. In addition, because
such males need not hold and transport a female, the
males can invest more energy in obtaining nutrition. In
polygynandrous females, the longer length of the oesophagus compared to that of monogamous females may
be a consequence of the absence of continuous pairing.
In monogamous schistosomes (at least in the Schistosoma
genus, for which most information is available), it is well
established that the male assists the female to pump
blood and to reach sexual maturity [54]. A lone female is
stunted and unable to produce eggs [18]. Therefore, as a
consequence of the mating system, monogamous
females, aided by their males, would be expected to possess a shorter oesophagus than that of polygynandrous
females, which live separately from males.

Conclusions
The present study shows that the mating system drives
negative associations between somatic and sexual morphological features. Monogamous males invest less in
sexual tissues (the testes and associated organs) and
more in tissues required for female transport, protection,

Beltran et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:245

and feeding assistance. On the other hand, polygynandrous males make a greater investment in sexual tissues
and a lower investment in female care compared to
monogamous males. Therefore, sexual selection acts not
only on primary and secondary sex organs, but also on
somatic organs, the functions of which are beneficial in a
given mating system.
