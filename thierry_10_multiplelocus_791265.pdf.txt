Abstract
Background: Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) is a prominent subtyping
method to resolve closely related microbial isolates to provide information for establishing genetic patterns among
isolates and to investigate disease outbreaks. The usefulness of MLVA was recently demonstrated for the avian
major pathogen Chlamydophila psittaci. In the present study, we developed a similar method for another pathogen
of birds: the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.
Results: We selected 10 VNTR markers located on 4 different chromosomes (1, 5, 6 and 8) of A. fumigatus. These
markers were tested with 57 unrelated isolates from different hosts or their environment (53 isolates from avian
species in France, China or Morocco, 3 isolates from humans collected at CHU Henri Mondor hospital in France
and the reference strain CBS 144.89). The Simpson index for individual markers ranged from 0.5771 to 0.8530. A
combined loci index calculated with all the markers yielded an index of 0.9994. In a second step, the panel of 10
markers was used in different epidemiological situations and tested on 277 isolates, including 62 isolates from birds
in Guangxi province in China, 95 isolates collected in two duck farms in France and 120 environmental isolates
from a turkey hatchery in France. A database was created with the results of the present study http://minisatellites.
u-psud.fr/MLVAnet/. Three major clusters of isolates were defined by using the graphing algorithm termed
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The first cluster comprised most of the avian isolates collected in the two duck
farms in France, the second cluster comprised most of the avian isolates collected in poultry farms in China and
the third one comprised most of the isolates collected in the turkey hatchery in France.
Conclusions: MLVA displayed excellent discriminatory power. The method showed a good reproducibility. MST
analysis revealed an interesting clustering with a clear separation between isolates according to their geographic
origin rather than their respective hosts.

Background
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus thrives on
decaying vegetation and organic debris. It releases large
amounts of asexual spores (conidia), which are dispersed
by air. As a result of this ubiquitous presence, people
and animals are constantly exposed to A. fumigatus conidia. In humans, conidia can colonize the respiratory
tract, causing pulmonary infections including bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis. In birds, respiratory aspergillosis is considered as
a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Aspergillosis

is frequently reported in turkey poults, in quails, in marine birds that are brought into rehabilitation, in captive
raptors, and in penguins being maintained in zoological
parks [1-3].
The Multiple Locus Variable-number tandem-repeat
Analysis (MLVA) is based on polymorphism of tandemly repeated genomic sequences called VNTR (Variable-Number Tandem-Repeats). VNTRs are classically
separated into microsatellites (up to 8 bp) and minisatellites (9 bp and more) [4]. The MLVA technique has
been used for the genotyping of many bacterial pathogens [5-12] as well as the opportunistic yeast Candida
glabrata [13]. For these pathogens, MLVA technique
allowed to resolve closely related microbial isolates for
investigation of disease outbreaks and provided

information for establishing phylogenetic patterns
among isolates. The MLVA technique can be performed
with simple electrophoretic equipment. The usefulness
of MLVA was recently demonstrated for the avian
major pathogen Chlamydophila psittaci [5].
The objective of the present study was to develop a
new typing method based on the detection of VNTRs in
the filamentous fungus A. fumigatus, another major
avian pathogen. All putative VNTR markers were
screened on the whole genome of A. fumigatus strain
Af293. Ten markers were finally selected and used for
the typing of a large number of isolates from poultry
and their environment in France and China.

Methods
Strain collection

In order to develop a MLVA scheme and choose discriminant VNTR markers, a total number of 57 isolates
was selected from our laboratory collection. These isolates were considered as geographically or temporally
unrelated. The isolates were collected from tissues or
from pharyngeal swabs: (i) 49 isolates from different animal species with lesions of aspergillosis in different
places in France (n = 48) or Morocco (n = 1); (ii) 3 isolates collected from human cases of aspergillosis at one
hospital in Ile-de-France region, France; (iii) 2 isolates
collected from healthy birds in 2 poultry farms in
France; (iv) 2 isolates from healthy birds in chicken and
duck farms in Guangxi province, China; (v) the reference strain CBS 144.89 (Table 1).
To test the MLVA technique, we selected a second
group of 277 isolates which represented 5 distinct epidemiological situations: (i) 52 isolates collected during an epidemiological survey conducted in the same duck farm in
2008 in Sarthe department, France; (ii) 43 isolates collected
during an epidemiological survey conducted in another
single duck farm in 2008 in Sarthe department, France; (iii)
48 isolates collected during an epidemiological survey in a
chicken farm in 2008 in Guangxi province, China; (iv) 14
isolates collected during an epidemiological survey in a
duck farm in 2008 in Guangxi province, China; (v) 120
environmental isolates collected in 2009 in a turkey hatchery in Maine-et-Loire department, France (Table 2).
To test the specificity of the MLVA technique, isolates
from other Aspergillus species (A. lentulus CBS 117885,
A. flavus environmental isolate, A. nidulans CBS 589.65
and A. niger CBS 733.88 and environmental isolate)
were also included.
Aspergillus isolates were microscopically identified
after cultivation on Malt Agar plates at 37°C until conidia formation. For 95 randomly selected isolates, the
species identification was confirmed by amplification
and sequencing of partial b-Tubulin gene using primer
set btub1-btub2 [14,15].

DNA isolation

From each isolate, conidia were collected from the culture and transferred into a microtube for extraction. A
bead mill homogenization step was used, before the lysis
treatment, to facilitate the disruption of the complex
fungal cell wall. Bead mill homogenization was carried
out in a high-speed (5000 rpm) mini-bead beater (Mixer
Mill MM301, Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Lysis and
DNA extraction were then performed using the
Nucleospin DNA Extraction Kit (Macherey-Nagel,
Germany).
Selection of VNTR markers

The availability of the whole genome sequence of A.
fumigatus strains (strain Af293) allowed us to search for
tandem-repeat sequences in the Tandem Repeat Database of the University Paris Sud XI in Orsay http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr/GPMS/ using the Tandem Repeat
Finder software [16]. In order to evaluate the polymorphism of selected tandem repeats, primers were
chosen on both sides of the repeats and the 57 unrelated isolates from our laboratory collection were analyzed. PCR were performed in a total volume of 15 μl
containing 1-5 ng of DNA, 1X PCR reaction buffer, 0.5
U of Taq polymerase (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga Japan), 250
μM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 0.5 μM
of each flanking primer. Primers were designed using
Primer Express® 2.0 software. The initial denaturation
step at 95°C for 10 min was followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, primer annealing at 58°C for 40 s, and elongation at 72°C for 30 s.
The final extension step was at 72°C for 10 min.
Ten microliters of amplification product were loaded
onto a 3% standard agarose gel. Gels stained with ethidium bromide were visualized under UV light, and
photographed (Figure 1). The size marker used was a
Quick-load 100-bp ladder (New England BioLabs, Ipswich UK).
Sequencing

The alleles observed on each VNTR were sequenced to
confirm the observations made on electrophoresis gel.
The number of repeats was estimated from the amplicon size. The sequencing of one example of allele
allowed to check whether microdeletions occurred and
to evaluate the internal variation of the repeats. A total
number of 70 amplicons were sequenced by Qiagen
(Courtaboeuf, France) and then aligned and compared,
in order to confirm the exact number of repeats.
Stability and reproducibility

The stability of the VNTR markers was estimated by
analysis of 5 distinct isolates of A. fumigatus subcultured
12 times in 2 months.

flanking sequences was subtracted from the band size
and the number was divided by the repeats size. The
result of this calculation corresponded to the number of
repeats. Data were analyzed with Bionumerics software

pattern (data not shown). This result proved that double-bands patterns were due to mixtures of isolates.
Stability and reproducibility

The 60 samples (5 isolates subcultured 12 times in 2
months) used for the evaluation of stability were typed
by MLVA and yielded exactly the same MLVA pattern.
The 16 samples used for the evaluation of reproducibility (8 isolates tested by 2 different technicians in 2 different laboratories) yielded exactly the same MLVA pattern.

unrelated isolates. The index for individual markers ranged from 0.5771 to 0.8530 (Table 3). A combined loci
index calculated with all of 10 markers yielded an index
of 0.9994. When the VNTR profiles of 330 isolates were
considered, the combined loci index was 0.9956.

first. A cutoff value of maximum differences of 2
VNTRs out of 10 was applied to define cluster in the
MST method.

A database was created with the results of the present

website, it is possible to compare VNTR patterns with
300 different patterns included in the database using
complete panel of markers or just a selection of them.
This database also allows to build dendrograms with the
query. All the possibilities provided by the website and
database are explained by Grissa et al. [18].
Specificity

Results
Selection of VNTR markers

The use of the Tandem Repeat Finder software allowed
the detection of 77 tandem repeats with a repeat unit
larger than 9 bp. Putative VNTR markers were found in
the 8 chromosomes of A. fumigatus. For the selection of
markers, 2 criteria were used: a homology of more than
90% between the different repeats and a number of
repeats higher than 3. Only 10 out of these markers
were polymorphic in the 57 unrelated isolates. The 10
markers were located on 4 different chromosomes (1, 5,
6 and 8). Five VNTRs were on chromosome 1
(Asp_167, Asp_202, Asp_330, Asp_443 and Asp_446).
VNTRs Asp_165, Asp_252 and Asp_345 were on chromosome 5. VNTRs Asp_204 and Asp_20 were on chromosome 6 and 8, respectively. Characteristics of final
VNTRs and respective primer sets are listed in Table 2.
Considering that the genome of A. fumigatus is haploid, we excluded isolates presenting double-bands patterns, because these patterns could be explained by a
mixture of genotypes. When mixtures were suspected,
different colonies were separated and subcultured. Each

When VNTR primer sets were tested with DNA from
Aspergillus flavus, A. niger and A. nidulans no amplification was observed. When VNTR primer sets were tested
with DNA from Aspergillus lentulus, a species closely
related to A. fumigatus, amplification was obtained with
3 out of 10 markers (Asp_167, Asp_202 and Asp_330).
As a consequence the combination of 10 VNTRs should
be considered as specific of A. fumigatus.
Clustering analysis

A total number of 330 A. fumigatus isolates were typed
with the panel of 10 VNTRs. This analysis yielded 255
different genotypes. Only 33 genotypes were shared by
two isolates or more.
UPGMA analysis did not allow a clear clustering of
the isolates (data not shown). Some isolates (n = 12)
were characterized by the insertion of a large sequence
(about 450 bp) in VNTR Asp_20 whereas others (n = 6)
had a very high number of repeats (from 10 to 17) in
the VNTR Asp_202 and (from 10 to 15) in the VNTR
Asp_330, exhibiting patterns which were not observed
in the group of unrelated isolates (Table 3).

*Each index was calculated with the results from 57 unrelated A. fumigatus isolates

The graphing algorithm termed Minimum Spanning
Tree (MST) demonstrated three major clusters of isolates (Figure 2). The first cluster comprised 91 out of 95
avian isolates (95%) collected in the two duck farms in
Sarthe department in France. The second cluster comprised 42 out of 62 avian isolates (70%) collected in
poultry farms in Guangxi province in China and the
third cluster comprised 90 out of 120 environmental
isolates (75%) from the turkey hatchery in Maine-etLoire department in France. In the dendrogram, genotypes corresponding to unrelated isolates are clearly
separated.

Discussion
Typing A. fumigatus isolates may help to improve the
understanding of the distribution of this major pathogen
in different situations and environments, including susceptible birds in poultry farms. This molecular approach
may also give a deeper understanding of the colonization pattern of putative hosts. To date, it is still a matter
of controversy whether certain isolates are more virulent
and genetically distinct from other isolates, or whether
infection by A. fumigatus is simply a matter of contracting infection from any environmental source.
The choice of a specific typing technique depends on
the scientific questions and the equipment of the laboratory. Many different techniques have already been
described for A. fumigatus: Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [19], Restriction Enzyme

Analysis (REA) [20], Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) [21], Amplified Fragment Length
Polymorphism (AFLP) [22], Microsatellite Length Polymorphism (MLP) [23-27] and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) [28]. CSP typing is a recently developed
typing strategy that involves DNA sequence typing of a
repetitive region of the A. fumigatus AFUA_3G08990
gene coding for a Cell Surface Protein, designated the
CSP locus [29,30]. All of these typing techniques were
developed in order to resolve closely related isolates for
the purposes of outbreak investigation in hospitals and
disease surveillance in humans. RFLP (with Afut1 probe)
and MLP typing methods were proved to be highly discriminant. Furthermore MLP showed high reproducibility because of the unambiguous data. For these reasons,
MLP method is now considered as the gold standard for
the analysis of epidemiological relationships between
large amounts of A. fumigatus isolates over a long period of time in hospitals. Another method with high
reproducibility is MLST, but the loci described so far
for A. fumigatus are probably not discriminant enough
to identify the source of an outbreak situation. The
RAPD method was used in many investigations probably
because it requires simple equipment and no genomic
sequence information, but it suffered from limited discriminatory power and reproducibility.
In the present study, a molecular typing method for A.
fumigatus based on the study of 10 VNTR markers with
repeat size larger than 9 bp was developed and further

a unique genotype. The diameter of each circle corresponds to the
number of isolates with the same genotype. Genotypes connected
by a shaded background differ by a maximum of 2 of the 10 VNTR
markers and could be considered a “clonal complex”. Thick
connecting lines represent one marker difference; regular
connecting lines represent two marker differences; thick interrupted
lines represent three differences; thin interrupted lines represent
four or more differences. The length of each branch is also
proportional to the number of difference. Each epidemiological
situation is represented by a specific colour: red for isolates
collected during an epidemiological survey conducted in the same
duck farm in 2007 and 2008 in Sarthe region, France; salmon pink
for isolates collected during an epidemiological survey conducted in
another single duck farm in 2007 and 2008 in Sarthe region, France;
navy blue for isolates collected during an epidemiological survey in
a chicken farm in 2008 in Guangxi province, China; light blue for
isolates collected during an epidemiological survey in a duck farm
in 2008 in Guangxi province, China; green for environmental isolates
collected in 2009 in a turkey hatchery in Maine et Loire region,
France and yellow for unrelated isolates. Large ellipses correspond

applied to 277 isolates from birds or from the environment. The MLVA typing method proved highly discriminant with a Simpson’s diversity index of 0.9994. This
value was obtained with unrelated isolates from animals
or humans and was exactly the same as that obtained
with isolates from humans using microsatellite markers
[25]. Size differences between alleles of the 10 selected
VNTRs were large enough to allow efficient sizing on
agarose gel. This makes the present MLVA scheme easy
to implement in laboratories possessing basic molecular
biology equipment. The method showed a good reproducibility, which could be increased by the production
of an internal ladder (including an example of each
allele amplicon size) or the use of capillary electrophoresis [31]. The MLVA was shown to be rapid and very
discriminant. Performing monoplex amplifications, like
in the present study, leads to more effort than using
multiplex amplifications. In future development of the
MLVA technique, the combination of two or more
VNTR amplifications in a single reaction tube should be
tested.
For the clustering analysis of VNTR profiles, we used
a graphing algorithm termed minimum spanning tree
(MST). This method was introduced to improve analysis
of VNTR profiles [15]. Similar to maximum-parsimony
phylogenetic tree reconstruction methods, MST constructs a tree that connects all the genetic profiles in
such a way that the summed genetic distance of all
branches is minimized. The differences in mathematical
approach between MST and UPGMA methods may
account for the changes in isolates clustering. Thus,
MST allowed to group A. fumigatus isolates which were
unclustered with UPGMA. A first cluster included most
of the isolates from birds in France whereas the second
included most of the isolates from birds in China
(Figure 2). The third cluster included most of the environmental isolates collected in a hatchery in France. As a
consequence, MST results clearly reflected the geographic origin of the isolates. However, the clustering
did not allow the separation of isolates collected from
birds living in two different farms in the same department (in France) or province in China. This suggests
that geographic clustering occurs at the scale of large
areas. The distance between the two farms in Sarthe
department in France or in Guangxi province was 20
km and 30 km, respectively. The mean distance between
the two farms in Sarthe department and the hatchery in
Maine-et-Loire was 120 km. To confirm the geographic
clustering and evaluate the minimum size of geographic
clusters, additional samples from other origins should

Guangxi province and avian isolates near the hatchery in
Maine-et-Loire department. Geographic clustering of A.
fumigatus isolates using repeat sequence analysis with
the CSP method, was suggested by Balajee in 2007 [29].
Recently, another study using the AFLP method showed
a geographic structuration of A. fumigatus isolates [32].

Conclusions
The present study allowed to describe 10 VNTR markers, applicable in the typing of the major fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. The loci in this VNTR assay
were highly discriminating and stable over time. The
typing method could be used for molecular epidemiological studies of A. fumigatus in different situations
including avian farms and hospitals where outbreaks of
invasive aspergillosis may occur. Furthermore, data
obtained by the present method could be easily shared
in a web database
