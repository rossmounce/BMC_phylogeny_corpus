Development of a novel multiplex DNA
microarray for Fusarium graminearum and
analysis of azole fungicide responses

Abstract
Background: The toxigenic fungal plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum compromises wheat production
worldwide. Azole fungicides play a prominent role in controlling this pathogen. Sequencing of its genome
stimulated the development of high-throughput technologies to study mechanisms of coping with fungicide stress
and adaptation to fungicides at a previously unprecedented precision. DNA-microarrays have been used to analyze
genome-wide gene expression patterns and uncovered complex transcriptional responses. A recently developed
one-color multiplex array format allowed flexible, effective, and parallel examinations of eight RNA samples.
Results: We took advantage of the 8 × 15 k Agilent format to design, evaluate, and apply a novel microarray
covering the whole F. graminearum genome to analyze transcriptional responses to azole fungicide treatment.
Comparative statistical analysis of expression profiles uncovered 1058 genes that were significantly differentially
expressed after azole-treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis for 31 selected genes indicated high conformity to
results from the microarray hybridization. Among the 596 genes with significantly increased transcript levels,
analyses using GeneOntology and FunCat annotations detected the ergosterol-biosynthesis pathway genes as the
category most significantly responding, confirming the mode-of-action of azole fungicides. Cyp51A, which is one of
the three F. graminearum paralogs of Cyp51 encoding the target of azoles, was the most consistently differentially
expressed gene of the entire study. A molecular phylogeny analyzing the relationships of the three CYP51 proteins
in the context of 38 fungal genomes belonging to the Pezizomycotina indicated that CYP51C (FGSG_11024)
groups with a new clade of CYP51 proteins. The transcriptional profiles for genes encoding ABC transporters and
transcription factors suggested several involved in mechanisms alleviating the impact of the fungicide. Comparative
analyses with published microarray experiments obtained from two different nutritional stress conditions identified
subsets of genes responding to different types of stress. Some of the genes that responded only to tebuconazole
treatment appeared to be unique to the F. graminearum genome.
Conclusions: The novel F. graminearum 8 × 15 k microarray is a reliable and efficient high-throughput tool for
genome-wide expression profiling experiments in fungicide research, and beyond, as shown by our data obtained
for azole responses. The array data contribute to understanding mechanisms of fungicide resistance and allow
identifying fungicide targets.

Head Blight (FHB) complex in cereals, a disease of global concern in wheat and barley [1]. Typically, spores
dispersed by raindrops or wind infect flowering spikelets
during humid weather at anthesis which may lead to
serious FHB under post-flowering moisture conditions
[1,2]. Like in FHB, several Fusarium species including
F. graminearum are responsible for a disease on basal
stem tissue of cereals, including maize, called crown rot.
Beside considerable yield losses, drastic quality losses

may result from contamination of grains with mycotoxins produced by F. graminearum. Like other members
of the genus, F. graminearum produces a mixture of
several mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol (DON)
that cause severe threats to human and animal health
[3]. National governments have established strict regulations for tolerable mycotoxins levels in cereal products.
Azole fungicides are indispensable for the control of
FHB. These fungicides inhibit the cytochrome P450
sterol 14a-demethylase (CYP51, syn. ERG11), an
enzyme that is essential for ergosterol biosynthesis, leading to disturbance of fungal membrane integrity. The
current limitation of alternative fungicides to control
effectively FHB has resulted in increased application of
azoles. As a result, strains exhibiting increased resistance
to this fungicide class were recovered from F. graminearum field populations [4,5]. Declining efficacies of
azoles have also been reported in other fungal cereal
pathogens, e.g. Septoria tritici and Blumeria graminis
[6,7]. The molecular basis of fungicide resistance, however, is unclear in many cases. Fungicides currently used
in agriculture only address a limited number of molecular targets, most of which are enzymes of the ergosterol
biosynthetic pathway. Thus, the discovery of novel fungicides with novel modes-of-action would represent a
break-through in chemical plant protection. Genomewide transcriptome analysis may help suggesting
mechanisms of drug resistance [8].
The importance of F. graminearum for agronomy but
also for basic research stimulated efforts to sequence its
genome [9]. Recently, the third improved annotation of
the genome (FG3) that lists 13,332 genes has become
available. Gene calls from the first genome annotation
by the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA, USA) and from
an annotation by the MIPS Institute (München, Germany) were combined to develop a DNA microarray
using the Affymetrix GeneChip format [10]. While the
Affymetrix photolithographical method allowed synthesis of short oligonucleotides (25 mers), the more
recently developed ink jet procedure of Agilent synthesizes longer 60 mer oligonucleotides in situ which
increased the detection sensitivity [11]. In addition, for
Agilent several multiplex array formats are available.
The Agilent 8 × 15 k format holds eight independent
microarrays on a single slide, each carrying up to 15,000
spotted oligonucleotides, which is sufficient to cover
most fungal genomes with at least one probe per gene.
As demonstrated previously, the high specificity and affinity of long oligomer probes allow representing genes
on microarrays by a single probe [12].
In this study, we developed a novel microarray
designed for the 8 × 15 k Agilent multiplex format. To
validate its reliability for expression profiling experiments, this array was employed to determine the

genome-wide transcriptional response of F. graminearum to treatment with the sterol biosynthesis inhibitor tebuconazole. The application of recent microarray
statistics and functional gene enrichment approaches
uncovered the most significant responses for several
sterol biosynthesis pathway genes. In addition, amongst
the many genes encoding ABC transporters and transcription factors, some were identified that showed significantly altered transcript levels that were only
observed in our tebuconazole study but not in a previously published microarray experiment that examined
starvation stress conditions.

Methods
Fungal cultivation

In this study, we used Fusarium graminearum strain
NRRL 31084 (syn. PH1). To warrant high reproducibility, conidial stock suspensions (10 6 conidia/ml) were
stored in 20% (v/v) glycerol at -80°C. Fungal cultivation
and preparation of conidia suspension were performed
as described before [13].
To prepare RNA and genomic DNA used for the
microarray preselection experiment (see below), 10 6
conidia were inoculated into three 300 ml flasks containing 100 ml complete medium (CM) [14] and cultivated at 23°C with shaking at 150 rpm. Mycelia were
harvested after 24 h, washed with sterile distilled water
and re-inoculated into 100 ml of CM, minimal medium
(MM) [14] lacking a nitrogen source (MMN) or MM
without a carbon source (MMC). After 12 h of cultivation at 23°C with shaking at 150 rpm, the mycelia were
harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at -80°C
until preparation of nucleic acids. For the preparation of
RNA used for microarray experiments investigating
azole responses, 10 6 conidia were inoculated into six
300-ml-flasks containing 100 ml CM and incubated as
above. After 24 h, three of the cultures were adjusted to
5 mg/l tebuconazole. Incubation of all cultures continued for further 12 h, and cultures were harvested as
described above.
Nucleic acid isolation

Total RNA was isolated from mycelia grown in vitro
with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The
optional on-column DNase digestion step was performed using RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). Genomic
DNA was isolated from mycelium cultured in CM as
described [15]. Quantity and purity of nucleic acid preparations were determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000
UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,
Wilmington, USA). RNA quality was assessed with a
BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Böblingen,
Germany).

Microarray development

The microarray was designed in collaboration with an
Agilent-certified service provider (imaGenes, Berlin,
Germany) that applied an in-house developed approach
for selection of the best performing probes for each
gene (http://www.imagenes-bio.de/services/microarray/
pss/mechanism). Using the annotation FG3, for each
gene model, several 60 mer oligonucleotides were
selected by the software eArray (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/) and were then filtered by proprietary
software (imaGenes). In addition to the 13,332 genes of
the FG3 annotation, available cDNA sequences of the
TRI (= trichothecene biosynthesis) gene cluster from
nivalenol (NIV) producing strains of F. graminearum,
i.e. strains H88-1 (accessions: AAK53574 to AAK53581,
AAM22490) and NRRL 13383 (accessions: AAM 48747
to AAM48754) were chosen for oligonucleotide selection. The inclusion of these cDNA sequences was
considered useful as genes of the TRI cluster of NIVproducing strains show several differences that might
not reliably allow quantitative detection with oligonucleotides derived from DON-type PH1 sequences.
Throughout this study, data from these additional
cDNA-based probes were excluded from analyses.
Thereafter, up to nine oligonucleotides per gene were
assembled on a pre-selection array using the Agilent 2 ×
105 k format and hybridized against cyanine 3 (Cy3)labeled genomic DNA and cRNA obtained from pooled
total RNA derived from three cultures grown in CM,
MMN, and MMC. Based on the RNA hybridization
results, for each gene the relative ratio of probes was
determined that yielded significant signal intensities. In
case that this ratio was 60% higher than the background,
a gene was considered expressed. For these genes, final
oligonucleotide selection relied on the results from RNA
hybridization, whereas for genes considered nonexpressed hybridization results from genomic DNA
were used. The final array design applied a proprietary
algorithm (imaGenes) that used different criteria for
expressed and non-expressed genes. The optimal oligonucleotides finally assembled in the 8 × 15 k Agilent
microarray format for analyzing transcriptomic
responses of F. graminearum is publicly available (Additional file 1). Microarrays can be ordered at Agilent
using design ID 021301. Since this format is highly flexible in production it can easily be updated if future
annotations should modify some gene models.
Microarray sample preparation and hybridization

For sample preparation and array processing the Agilent
protocol “One-color microarray-based gene expression
analysis (Quick Amp Labeling)” was used (http://www.
chem.agilent.com). Briefly, the recommended volume of
control RNAs (Agilent One-Color RNA Spike-In Kit)

Page 3 of 17

was added to 200 ng of total RNA. Thereafter, Cy3labeled cRNA was produced, using the Agilent Quick
Amp Kit (one-color) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Labeled cRNA was purified with the RNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen). Yield and Cy3 incorporation rates
were analyzed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-VIS
spectrophotometer. In addition, size distribution of
cRNAs was assessed by a BioAnalyzer 2100. Genomic
DNA was Cy3-labeled using the Genomic DNA Enzymatic Labeling Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Hybridization of the 105 k pre-selection arrays was
performed with either 5 μg or 1.5 μg of the Cy3-labeled
gDNA or cRNA derived from a pooled RNA sample as
described above. For hybridizations using the 15 k
arrays, 600 ng of Cy3-labeled cRNA was used. Hybridization was performed with eight cRNA samples. Six
cRNA samples derived from three independent
untreated and three independent azole-treated liquid
cultures (see above). The remaining two samples represented additional technically repeated hybridizations
that used the labeled cRNAs from one of the untreated
cultures. Hybridization was set up in a Microarray
Hybridization Chamber (Agilent) and was incubated in
a hybridization oven (Agilent) at 65°C and 10 rpm for
17 h. After performing the suggested washing steps,
slides were scanned by a microarray scanner (Agilent) at
5 μm resolution.
Normalization and statistical analysis of microarray data

The microarray scan data were analyzed by Agilent’s
Feature Extraction software, which estimates the background level and gives a feature-specific background
cut-off level per chip. The background-corrected raw
signals were converted to gene signals by a median
polish algorithm as implemented in the RMA (robust
multi-array average) algorithm [16]. Gene signals were
normalized between experiments by quantile normalization [17].
Relying on the normalized gene signals, the average
log 2 fold-changes between both experimental groups
(tebuconazole-treated vs. untreated) were assessed for
each gene. We applied the optimal discovery procedure
(ODP) to identify significant changes in relative transcript levels [18]. This combinatorial statistical approach
is available in the open-source software package EDGE
version 1.1.291 [19]. The identification of differentially
expressed genes includes two steps. First, ODP statistics
is applied for each gene, which results in a ranking of
the genes from most to least differentially expressed. In
a second step, statistical significance is estimated by
using the false discovery rate (FDR) methodology [20]
which results in the assignment of a q-value for each
gene. The q-value gives the expected rate of false

Becher et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/52

positives amongst those genes that were assigned as differentially expressed.
Datasets of processed signal intensities from biological
and technical replicates were evaluated with Pearson’s
coefficient of correlation (R) using MS Excel 2007
(Microsoft, Redmond, USA).
Bioinformatics
Functional enrichment analyses

Gene sets were examined for significant enrichment of
functional categories using two annotation schemes, i.e.
“The Functional Catalogue” (FunCat) [21] and “GeneOntology” (GO) [22]. The FunCat annotation of the
F. graminearum genome was provided by the MIPS
Fusarium graminearum database (FGDB) (http://mips.
helmholtz-muenchen.de/genre/proj/FGDB/). We performed the GeneOntology annotation of the F. graminearum genome by subjecting all 13,332 proteins of the
FG3 annotation to Blast2GO (version 2.3.6) analysis
(http://www.blast2go.org). This software extracts GO
terms characterizing the putative function of the proteins relying on ontologies mapped to homologous proteins identified by BLAST [23]. BlastP parameters that
differed from the default were set as follows: “Number
of Blast Hits” at 30, “Blast ExpectValue” at 1.0E-10.
Furthermore, the “Try SIMAP first” option was chosen.
The GO annotation was performed with default settings
except for the “Annotation Cutoff” value that was set to
30. Thereby, Blast2GO could assign 8463 proteins to at
least one of the general GO categories of biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. In
analogy to FunCat enrichment analysis at the FGDB server, assessment of statistically significant GO term
enrichment utilized the hypergeometric distribution
function as implemented in MS Excel. The resulting
p values from both, the FunCat and the GO enrichment
analyses, were corrected for multiple testing by applying
the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR procedure [24]. The cutoff
for FDR-corrected p values was set to 0.05.
Identification and assignment of putative homologs

Microarray data analyses were focused, amongst others,
on genes of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. For this
purpose, at first sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
proteins known to be involved in ergosterol biosynthesis
[25] were retrieved from the Saccharomyces Genome
Database (SGD) (http://www.yeastgenome.org/). These
sequences were used as queries in the BlastP search
option implemented at the FGDB server (see above) to
retrieve putative homologs from the F. graminearum
proteome (see Additional file 2).
We examined the phylogenetic relationships of the
CYP51/ERG11 proteins from F. graminearum by comparison to the corresponding proteins of other fungi
(see below). To identify such proteins in 38 currently

Page 4 of 17

annotated proteomes of the Pezizomycotina we used the
ERG11 sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the
query in BlastP searches at NCBI Genomic Blast (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi), at the
Joint Genome Institute database (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/
genome-projects), or at the NITE Institute database
(http://www.bio.nite.go.jp/dogan).
Furthermore, we assessed the phylogenetic relationships between all putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters from F. graminearum. The identification of
such proteins relied on the FunCat and GO annotations
described above. FGDB provided 78 genes annotated in
the FunCat category ‘ABC transporters’ (20.03.25). Manual revision appeared to be necessary since this list also
contained MFS (= major facilitator superfamily) transporters and other non-ABC proteins. Beyond those, we
excluded four additional proteins that lacked any transmembrane domains, which were identified by the
TMHMM software (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
TMHMM/), resulting in a set of 50 putative ABC transporters. In a second analysis using the GO annotations,
we applied the GO term ‘ATPase activity, coupled to
transmembrane movement of substances’ (GO:042626).
This recovered four additional proteins that were not
found by FunCat and which were included in the molecular phylogeny. To assign all identified ABC transporters to one of the known subfamilies [26,27] we
analyzed the distribution of predicted transmembrane
and ATP binding domains by the TMHMM (see above)
and the Conserved Domain Search (CDS) softwares
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml).
In addition, BlastP searches using ABC transporters
from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans as queries assisted in
the classification of the corresponding F. graminearum
proteins.
Predicted putative F. graminearum transcription factors were obtained from the Fungal Transcription Factor
Database (FTFD) (http://ftfd.snu.ac.kr/). Transcription
factors whose transcript levels differed significantly
between the control and the fungicide treatment in the
microarray experiments were used as queries in BlastP
searches against the proteomes of S. cerevisiae (at SGD;
see above) and Candida albicans (CGD; http://www.
candidagenome.org). Vice versa, best hits were used for
BlastP searches against the F. graminearum proteome.
Phylogenetic analyses

For phylogenetic analyses, we used the software MEGA
version 4 [28]. Alignments were created by the implemented ClustalW algorithm, using the substitution
BLOSUM weight matrix and the following parameters.
For pairwise and multiple alignment the gap opening
penalty was set to 10, whereas the gap extension penalties were set to 0.1, and respectively 0.05. Evolutionary
history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method.

Becher et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/52

Evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson
correction method. Gaps and missing data were eliminated only from pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion option). The confidence of the resulting
tree was estimated with 1000 bootstrap iterations.
Comparative analyses using published microarray data

Microarray data analyzing in F. graminearum two
nutritional stress conditions, i.e. carbon and nitrogen
starvation, were published [10] and deposited at the
MIAME-compliant Plant Expression Database (http://
www.plexdb.org). The RMA-normalized signal data were
assigned to the updated gene names based on the ProbeSet mapping table available at the MIPS FTP sites
(ftp://ftpmips.gsf.de/FGDB/) and subjected to the same
statistical analyses described above. Genes determined
to be differentially expressed in any of the three stress
conditions, i.e. tebuconazole treatment, carbon and
nitrogen starvation, were assessed for common and specific responses using MS Excel. We performed BlastP
searches (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) at the
database ‘Non-redundant protein sequences (nr)’ and
organism ‘fungi (taxid:4751)’ to check whether those
genes that only responded to tebuconazole were exclusively found in the F. graminearum genome.
Deposition of microarray data

MIAME-compliant information about the 8 × 15 k
F. graminearum microarray platform and the azole
treatment experiment have been deposited in the NCBI
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under the accession numbers
GPL11158 (platform) and GSE 25114 (experiment).
Quantitative RT-PCR

qRT-PCR used the Power Sybr Green RNA-to-CT 1-step
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and the
iCycler model MyiQ Single color (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
München, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. Reactions of 20 μl contained 20 ng of the
same total RNAs that had previously been used for
microarray hybridization. For all reactions, melting
curve analyses at the end of the amplification and subsequent electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels allowed verifying amplification of a single fragment. Additionally, for
each gene assessed, one reaction was purified with the
SureClean Kit (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany) and
sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). For each gene
analyzed and each RNA preparation used, qRT-PCR was
conducted in three technical repeats.
Primers were designed with the software NCBI Primer-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primerblast/) (Table 1). Primers for the reference genes (see
below) included a predicted intron, if available, which

Page 5 of 17

tested for contamination of RNA preparations with
genomic DNA. In case of FGSG_10791, a predicted
intron could not be confirmed.
Analysis of qRT-PCR data applied the sigmoidal
curve-fitting method [29] that calculates the initial fluorescence (R0), which relates to the initial amount of the
target in a sample. Computation of R0 was conducted
using the software Sigmaplot version 11 (Systat Software, Erkrath, Germany). As quantification of gene
expression requires normalization by stable internal
references, a minimum of three reference genes is
recommended to derive a combined normalization factor used to adjust the data of the genes of interest [30].
To identify genes with putatively stable expression
levels, normalized signals from all hybridizations of the
8 × 15 k microarray data except those from the technical replications were used to calculate a coefficient of
variation (CV = SD/mean) for each gene. The least variable genes with CV < 0.05 were examined for a putative
housekeeping function, according to the gene descriptions at the FGDB. As a result, FGSG_06245 (cofilin),
FGSG_01244 (pre-mRNA splicing factor), and
FGSG_10791 (RNA helicase) were chosen as potential
reference genes. Subsequently, qRT-PCR expression data
for the reference genes were subjected to analysis by the
software geNORM (http://medgen.ugent.be/~jvdesomp/
genorm/) to check their expression stability [30]. All
three selected reference genes yielded values for the
gene-stability measure M below the threshold (M = 0.7)
and were therefore used to derive the specific normalization factor (NF) for each RNA sample as reported
[30]. Finally, for each gene-of-interest the mean R0 of
the RNAs from treated and untreated mycelia were calculated and used to determine the log 2 fold-change
between the control and treatment.

Results
Design and validation of an 8 × 15 k microarray for
F. graminearum

In this study, a new Fusarium graminearum microarray
was designed for the 8 × 15 k Agilent multiplex format.
The representation of most genes by a single oligonucleotide probe on the array demanded a thorough preselection. Potentially suitable 60 mer probes were determined by bioinformatics and then experimentally validated for hybridization-signal quality by a pre-selection
microarray experiment. For 57% of the genes four to
seven probes were assembled on the pre-selection array
whereas 41% of the genes were represented by eight to
nine probes. It was not possible to derive more than
three probes for about 2% of the genes. For two of the
annotated genes, FGSG_08274 and FGSG_12303,
no specific oligonucleotide was identified, due to
sequence duplication and repetitive sequence structure.

The given gene ID is the entry number of the F. graminearum genome annotation FG3 provided by Broad Institute.

Accordingly, 103,747 probes were assembled on a 2 ×
105 k Agilent microarray that was hybridized to Cy3labeled cRNA derived from a pool of RNAs from three
cultures using different media. The second hybridization
used labeled genomic DNA. Transcripts were detected
for about 80% of the genes when applying a proprietary
threshold adjustment (imaGenes, Berlin, Germany) to
the processed signal data from the RNA hybridization
(data not shown). Those 10,622 genes were considered
to be expressed. A proprietary algorithm (imaGenes)
selected the optimal oligonucleotides for the final 15 k
array by using the results from the RNA hybridization
for the expressed genes. For the 2725 genes that were
not expressed, the signal data from the DNA hybridization were utilized. The final 15 k array design comprised

15,208 F. graminearum-specific and 536 additional oligonucleotides, including internal controls (Additional
file 1). In total 11,476 genes and 10 ESTs that were
derived from NIV-type TRI cluster genes were represented by one oligonucleotide, whereas for 1854 genes
and 7 NIV-type TRI cluster ESTs two probes were
chosen.
The general quality of the signals was assessed with
regard to the background noise. For all hybridizations,
the average percentage of spot data determined by the
Feature Extraction Software to be positive and significantly above background was 96.1 ± 2.2%. The chosen
one-color hybridization method is a rather recent development for the Agilent platform. Therefore, the performance of the array was evaluated by technical

Becher et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:52

replications that used a single RNA sample from one of
the untreated cultures for three hybridization experiments to determine variation arising during all stages of
data generation. Pearson’s correlation coefficients (R) of
0.992, 0.995, and 0.995 (p < 0.0001 each) indicated
highly significant conformity. In comparison, the biological replicates of the untreated and the treated samples
also showed strong correlation, with R = 0.939, 0.946,
0.952, and respectively 0.945, 0.958, 0.968 (p < 0.0001
each). The minor variations detected in these experiments demonstrated high experimental reproducibility.
Gene expression in response to tebuconazole treatment

To validate the suitability of the microarray to suggest
fungicide target(s) and mode(s) of action, F. graminearum strain PH1 was exposed to 5 ppm of tebuconazole in liquid culture for 12 h. This concentration was
previously determined as sub-lethal but strongly inhibitory for fungal vegetative growth (about 95% on fungicide-amended agar-plates compared to untreated
controls; data not shown).
Based on the processed, normalized gene signals the
average log2 fold-change (log2 FC) between both experimental groups (tebuconazole treated vs. untreated control) was assessed for each gene (Additional file 3).
Statistical analysis using the optimal discovery procedure
(ODP) as implemented in the EDGE software resulted in
a list ranking genes according to significance based on q
values (Additional file 3). To identify genes that
appeared differentially expressed after fungicide treatment, we applied two conditions, i.e. a cut-off for statistical significance (q < 0.04) and a cut-off for foldchanges (log2 FC ≥ 1 and ≤ -1). This procedure identified 596 genes with significantly increased and 462
genes with significantly decreased transcript abundances.
The 15 most significantly differentially expressed genes
with either an increase or a decrease in response to the
fungicide are listed in Table 2. Among those with
increased transcript levels were five genes (FGSG_04092,
FGSG_09764, FGSG_03686, FGSG_13888, and
FGSG_02771) that are putatively involved in sterol
metabolic processes. Among the genes exhibiting
decreased transcript levels were genes that affiliated
with amino acid transport (FGSG_02499, FGSG_02950,
and FGSG_09354) and amino acid metabolism
(FGSG_10119, FGSG_02349, FGSG_00296, and
FGSG_09647).
Two functional annotation approaches, “The Functional
Catalogue” (FunCat) and “GeneOntology” (GO), were
used to determine whether distinct functional groups of
proteins were overrepresented within the differentially
expressed genes. Among the genes with increased transcript levels, these programs identified only few functional categories as significantly enriched. These

Page 7 of 17

analyses revealed “sterol biosynthetic process” and “tetracyclic and pentacyclic triterpenes (cholesterin, steroids
and hopanoids) metabolism” as the most significantly
enriched functional classes (Additional file 4). Furthermore, both analyses also identified isoprenoid metabolism and heme binding protein functions as significantly
enriched. The two methods yielded distinct results for
some additional categories. Whereas FunCat found protein degradation as significantly enriched, GO regarded
proteins with hexosyl transferase activity and proteins
involved in membrane processes and mycelium development as significantly enriched among the genes with
increased transcript levels. The analyses of the genes
with significantly decreased transcript levels retrieved a
higher number of enriched categories. Both methods
identified several central cellular processes, e.g. respiratory chain and energy generation and metabolism of
amino acids and cofactors (Additional file 4).
Analyses of selected gene subsets

Previous studies on azole response and/or resistance in
human pathogens to azoles have implicated a general
importance of genes encoding ergosterol biosynthesis proteins, ABC transporters and transcription factors. However, in plant pathogens corresponding information is
scarce. Therefore, we examined these genes in more detail.
Ergosterol biosynthesis

Both functional enrichment analyses uncovered proteins
belonging to sterol or steroid biosynthesis as the category exhibiting the most significant response to tebuconazole treatment. This was reflected by significantly
increased transcript levels of most of the genes with
homologs among the ergosterol biosynthesis genes from
S. cerevisiae (Additional file 2).
In contrast to S. cerevisiae, certain Erg genes are
represented by more than one copy in some Pezizomycotina, including F. graminearum [31]. Each of the S.
cerevisiae genes Erg3, Erg5, Erg6, Erg10, and Erg24 corresponded to two genes in the genome of F. graminearum. Interestingly, three genes, i.e. FGSG_01000,
FGSG_04092 and FGSG_11024, encoded ERG11 (syn.
CYP51) the molecular target of azole action. Therefore,
we analyzed the evolution of CYP51 in 38 species of the
Pezizomycotina that have annotated proteomes. In total,
17 of the species had one and 14 had two Cyp51 genes.
The genomes of five species, i.e. F. graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae), Fusarium solani (teleomorph
Nectria haematococca), Aspergillus terreus, A. flavus,
and A. oryzae, harbor three putative Cyp51 genes. We
created a molecular phylogeny to examine the relationships between the CYP51 proteins from Pezizomycotina
and included S. cerevisiae as the outgroup (Figure 1).
These analyses identified three clades for the CYP51
proteins of the Pezizomycotina, two of which had

previously been termed CYP51A and CYP51B [32]. Species that had only one copy of CYP51 were exclusively
found in clade B. In those species that encoded two or
three CYP51 proteins one variant clustered in clade B,
the other in clade A, except for Cochliobolus heterostrophus and Talaromyces stipitatus. The former possessed
two CYP51B variants, whereas the latter showed a distinct CYP51 type that positioned at an unsupported
branch. For species that encoded three CYP51 proteins
in their genomes two patterns of clustering were
observed for the third additional copy. In Aspergillus
spp., the third CYP51 variants clustered either with
clade A (A. flavus and A. oryzae) or with clade B (A. terreus). In contrast, the third CYP51 variants of F. graminearum (FGSG_11024) and F. solani formed a distinct
and supported clade termed CYP51C.

Regarding the unique phylogenetic distribution of the
three Cyp51 genes in F. graminearum, we analyzed
whether they exhibited different transcriptional
responses after azole treatment. qRT-PCR confirmed
that the transcript levels of all three Cyp51 genes were
significantly increased by the treatment (Table 3). The
largest increase was observed for FGSG_04092 (=
Cyp51A) that was also the most consistently differentially expressed gene of the microarray study (Table 2).
The sigmoidal model applied to evaluate real-time
kinetics allowed calculating the R0 value which reflects
initial transcript abundance [33]. These comparisons
revealed similar transcript abundances for FGSG_01000
(= Cyp51B) and FGSG_11024 (= Cyp51C) in untreated
mycelia. Transcript abundances of these genes were
about 10 times higher than that of FGSG_04092 (=

Cyp51A) (Additional file 5). However, the response of
the latter gene towards tebuconazole treatment appeared
as most drastic, showing a 121-fold increase of transcript abundance.
ABC transporters Previous studies on azole responses
in other fungi had indicated a contribution of ABC
transporters to drug tolerance [34]. Using FunCat and
Blast2GO annotations, 54 putative ABC transporter proteins were identified in the F. graminearum proteome.
We constructed a phylogenetic tree to examine their
relationships especially in the context of subfamilies
known from ABC transporters [26,27] (Figure 2).
Thereby, we classified multidrug resistance proteins
(MDR), multidrug resistance-related proteins (MRP),
pleiotropic drug resistance proteins (PDR), and adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDp)-type ABC transporters,
which were represented by 16, 16, 19, and 2 members,
respectively (Figure 2). One putative ABC transporter
gene, FGSG_08373, did not group with any of these
subfamilies established first in the Saccharomycotina. Its
domain organization corresponded to MDR-type proteins, but it had highest similarity to PDR-type proteins
from C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. Typically, ABC transporters comprise two transmembrane and two nucleotide-binding domains. However, for the MDR- and
PDR-types, half-sized proteins with only one copy of the
domains are also known. In F. graminearum, six halfsize MDR and three PDR-proteins exist (Figure 2). Two
sequences (FGSG_08027 and FGSG_09611) seemed to
miss parts of the corresponding proteins putatively as a
result of erroneous ORF predictions.
The microarray analyses indicated that transcript
levels of 23 genes of the ABC superfamily showed more
than twofold (log2 FC ≥ 1 and ≤ -1) changes after tebuconazole treatment, and seven that additionally met our
significance threshold of q < 0.04 (Additional file 2). Of
these, four belonged to the MDR-, two to the PDR-, and
one to the MRP-type. One gene encoding a half-size
MDR protein exhibited significantly reduced transcript
levels. However, results from microarray analyses of
gene families like the ABC transporters might be
blurred by mispriming due to extended sequence similarities. Therefore, qRT-PCR was performed for 16 ABC
transporter genes to evaluate the reliability of the microarray data (Table 3). For 15 of the selected genes the
log2 FC values for tebuconazole treatment obtained by
the microarray experiment were coherent with those of
qRT-PCRs. For one gene, i.e. FGSG_11028, qRT-PCR
did not confirm the microarray data. The relative transcript levels of different ABC transporter genes, as
determined by qRT-PCR varied by up to a factor of 538

in untreated mycelia (see FGSG_02786 vs. FGSG_06771).
In mycelia treated by tebuconazole, up to 778fold differences in transcript abundances were detected
(FGSG_11028 vs. FGSG_06771) (Additional file 5).
Transcription factors The microarray data were also
analyzed to identify potential regulators involved in
azole-induced transcriptional responses. According to
the Fungal Transcription Factor Database, the F. graminearum proteome contained 660 putative transcription
factors classified into 44 families (Additional file 2). The
transcript levels of 22 of these genes were significantly
increased, whereas 15 were decreased by the tebuconazole treatment (log2 FC ≥ 1 and ≤ -1; q < 0.04). BlastP
analyses using the proteins of the increased genes as
queries against the annotated proteomes of S. cerevisiae
and C. albicans yielded hits with some proteins known
to be involved in azole-stress responses in these yeasts
(see Additional file 2). The proteins encoded by
FGSG_06324, FGSG_10364, and FGSG_11561
resembled the sterol regulatory binding protein
UPC2, which is a transcription factor controlling ergosterol biosynthetic and sterol uptake genes [35]. The protein encoded by FGSG_06810 was similar to the
transcription factor TAC1, which is a regulator of ABC
transporters [36]. Other up-regulated transcription
factors appeared to be involved in rather general
stress responses. FGSG_01341, FGSG_10470, and
FGSG_13711 were similar to CRZ1, a transcription factor involved in calcineurin- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent signaling [37]. The proteins encoded by
FGSG_09019, FGSG_01293, FGSG_01936, and
FGSG_13828 are putative regulators of metabolic processes, which may be indirectly compromised by fungicide treatment. These genes exhibit similarities to yeast’s
transcription factors involved in phosphate metabolism,
carbohydrate metabolism, and fatty acid degradation
(see Additional file 2).
Among the 13 putative transcription factors, which
exhibited significantly reduced transcript levels after
tebuconazole treatment, FGSG_09333 showed similarity
to RDR1 of S. cerevisiae [38]. RDR1 is a repressor of the
ABC transporter gene Pdr5 encoding an efflux pump
which is important for multidrug resistance in yeast.
FGSG_12970 was similar to the transcription factor
RIM101 described as a positive [39] and negative [40]
regulator protein contributing to cell wall assembly and
altered lipid asymmetry signaling in yeast. Due to their
homologies to the yeast proteins DAL81 and ARG81,
the F. graminearum proteins encoded by FGSG_10914
and FGSG_00144 might be involved in regulation of
catabolic processes.
qRT-PCR analyses were performed for 12 genes encoding transcription factors and showed high congruency to
the respective array data (Table 3). The qRT-PCR data

Page 12 of 17

suggested considerable intergenic differences of absolute
transcript abundances (Additional file 5).
Comparison of transcriptomic responses to different
types of stress

We compared our microarray data to those of a study
that was previously published for F. graminearum [10]
to assess how many of the genes responding to tebuconazole would also respond to other types of stress. We
applied the same statistical procedures described above
to the published microarray data that examined two
nutritional stress conditions, i.e. carbon and nitrogen
starvation. Based on the q value plots obtained by the
EDGE software we used q < 0.01 as the cut-off for statistical significance for these data sets. In addition, transcript levels in the published data needed to be changed
at least twofold (log2 FC ≥ 1 and ≤ -1) by the respective
treatment to be considered significant. Resulting gene
sets were used for subtractions (Figure 3). Transcript
abundances from the majority, i.e. 457 (76.7%) of the
above described 596 genes were specifically increased
after the fungicide treatment whereas 139 (23.3%) genes
responded also in at least one of the other two stress
conditions (Figure 3 A; Additional file 6). Some of those
belonged to one of the three groups of proteins discussed above. FGSG_02346 (homolog of the S. cerevisiae
gene Erg24), FGSG_09381 (homolog of S.c. Erg9) and
FGSG_10424 (homolog of S.c. Erg19) belonged to the
ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, whereas for ABC transporters and transcription factors we correspondingly
identified three genes (FGSG_02786, FGSG_06771,
FGSG_08312), and five genes (FGSG_01293, FGS
G_01307, FGSG_01936, FGSG_06324, FGSG_10639),
respectively. However, functional enrichment analysis
with the remaining 457 genes whose transcripts were
specifically increased by tebuconazole still indicated a
statistically significant enrichment of genes involved in
steroid metabolism (data not shown).
Comparison of the three stress conditions with respect
to genes showing reduced transcript levels indicated
considerably overlapping responses (Figure 3B). Of the
462 genes transcriptionally decreased after tebuconazole
treatment 232 (50.2%) were also decreased in at least
one of the other two conditions. This included the
genes FGSG_00069, FGSG_09177, FGSG_09333,
FGSG_09349, FGSG_09852, FGSG_12970, FGSG_13172,
all of which encode transcription factors. Importantly,
none of the genes encoding enzymes of ergosterol biosynthesis or ABC transporters exhibited decreased transcript levels by the starvation stresses. Additional BlastP
analyses focussing on those genes that were indicated to
be specifically transcriptionally increased or decreased
by the tebuconazole treatment revealed 42, respectively
11 genes that appeared to be unique to F. graminearum

Discussion
In this study, we developed and validated a new 8 × 15
k Agilent microarray, and employed it to analyze gene
expression in F. graminearum after treatment with tebuconazole. Our results demonstrate that this multiplex
microarray is an effective and versatile tool to detect
transcriptome responses at high sensitivity.
Due to its scientific and economic relevance, microarray technology has rapidly evolved into different platforms using short or long oligonucleotides provided by
several commercial manufacturers, such as Affymetrix
and Agilent Technologies. As studies using different
microarray platforms indicated an overall good comparability [41], the choice of a platform is mainly governed
by practical and cost considerations. Agilent’s inkjet-like
printing technology provides high flexibility for microarray design and allows convenient optimization in followup versions. In addition, multiplex formats were
developed that carry several microarrays on a single
slide, allowing for cost-effective transcription profiling.
The chosen Agilent 8 × 15 k format is fully sufficient
for covering the entire genome of F. graminearum, thus
permitting to simultaneously perform eight independent
expression profiling experiments. The employment of
the one-color labeling technique recently introduced for
the Agilent platform facilitates comparisons across
microarrays and between groups of samples without
compromising the quality of results [42].
To address the reliability of the results obtained by the
new microarray, we selected 31 genes for determining
their transcript levels by an independent experimental
approach, i.e. qRT-PCR. For most of these genes, the
log2 FC values from the qRT-PCRs were very close to
those of the microarray experiments. The comparison of
the entire data sets reveals a highly positive correlation
(R = 0.95) which corroborates the results of a previous
report that also examined these two experimental
approaches [43].
The new 8 × 15 k Agilent microarray was used to
analyze gene expression patterns in F. graminearum
treated with tebuconazole. We assess the results in the
context of microarray experiments that were performed
earlier. On the one hand, results that are supported by
those previously observed (e.g. in S. cerevisiae) highlight
the capability of the new microarray to gain information
relevant for better understanding the regulatory

Becher et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/52

networks mediating azole responses. This will be especially helpful for studying novel fungicides whose modeof-action should not only be analyzed in a model organism like S. cerevisiae but ideally also in the targeted
pathogens, e.g. F. graminearum. Consistent with studies
in other fungi [44-47] we found that the transcript levels
of most of the genes encoding proteins involved in
ergosterol-biosynthesis were increased by azole treatment. Furthermore, our functional enrichment analyses
using GeneOntology and FunCat demonstrated that the
ergosterol pathway ranks at the top among all functional
categories containing genes with significantly enhanced
transcript abundances. Interestingly, we found that
within this category FGSG_04092 (= Cyp51A), which is
one of the three genes encoding CYP51 in F. graminearum, exhibited the most significantly increased transcript levels of the entire study. In S. cerevisiae binding
of azoles to CYP51 leads to ergosterol depletion, accumulation of a toxic aberrant sterol and compromised
membrane rigidity [48]. It is thus possible that a
feed-back loop connecting transcriptional regulation of
ergosterol biosynthesis and sterol levels exists in F. graminearum, as previously reported for S. cerevisiae [49].
In yeast this link is mediated by UPC2 and ECM11
which regulate transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes
by binding to a sterol regulatory element (SRE) in their
promotors [35].
The fact that our microarray study uncovered the
transcript levels of genes in the ergosterol biosynthesis
pathway as highly significantly increased by tebuconazole treatment demonstrates its utility for fungicide
research. The data presented here clearly indicate that
microarray analysis can contribute to identify unknown
mode-of-actions, as has previously been shown for the
fungicide ciclopirox olamine in Candida albicans [50].
Sixty percent of the up-regulated genes were found to
encode proteins for iron uptake and metabolism suggesting that treated cells suffered from iron limitation.
This was supported by physiological experiments showing that addition of Fe2+ or Fe3+ diminished the detrimental effect of ciclopirox olamine on germ tube
formation.
Comparison of our results with published microarray
data indicates that about one quarter of the genes upregulated by tebuconazole and almost half of the downregulated genes correspondingly responded when F. graminearum was exposed to two unrelated starvation
stress conditions. This suggests that many of the genes
exhibit a rather unspecific stress response, which may in
part originate from defective nutrient supply resulting
from the azole-mediated membrane perturbations. On
the other hand, the majority of the genes with enhanced
transcript abundances responded specifically to fungicide treatment, which is underlined by the fact that all

Page 14 of 17

Cyp51 variants only responded in our azole treatment
study. Thus, the novel microarray is an excellent tool
supporting identification of target genes. Microarray
data of course need to be confirmed in subsequent studies, e.g. by targeted gene deletion or RNAi experiments, to address the function of individual genes to
attenuate fungicide impact and the mechanisms by
which this may be achieved.
Currently it is uncertain whether the CYP51A, B, and
C proteins have specific functions in F. graminearum. In
Aspergillus fumigatus transformants carrying individual
deletions of Cyp51A and Cyp51B remained viable
whereas the gene family as a whole was essential [51].
However, in this human pathogen up to now only point
mutations in Cyp51A but not in Cyp51B were discovered in clinical isolates and resistant strains generated in
vitro [52-54]. This suggests that the functions of these
proteins may not completely overlap.
Also ABC transporters were reported to be involved in
azole stress responses and in the development of azole
tolerance in several fungi as some of them mediate
active efflux of fungicides and other xenobiotics [34].
The subfamily most closely associated with drug resistance in the Saccharomycotina is PDR which have up to
10 members in yeasts [55]. In contrast, the genome of
F. graminearum harbors 19 PDR-type ABC transporters.
An evolutionary expansion of the PDR subfamily was
previously noticed for Pezizomycotina [56]. In addition,
the numbers of genes encoding MRP and MDR transporters (16 each) are clearly increased in F. graminearum as compared to S. cerevisiae (4 and 7,
respectively).
Our microarray data provide valuable insight into the
transcriptional responses of ABC transporter genes from
F. graminearum, suggesting that several of them may
attenuate the effects of tebuconazole action. Similarly,
microarrays analyzing azole responses of C. albicans
wild type strains showed that the transcript levels of the
ABC transporter genes Cdr1 and Cdr2 were increased
[46]. Both genes were also up-regulated in in vitro
azole-adapted strains and in clinically resistant isolates
[57,58]. Gene deletions in an azole-resistant isolate of
C. albicans indicated that CDR1 is essential to mediate
azole resistance whereas CDR2 seems to be less important [59]. However, heterologous overexpression of both
Cdr1 or Cdr2 conferred increased azole tolerance to
S. cerevisiae [60]. Another well-characterized ABC transporter is PDR5 of S. cerevisiae, which is exporting a
wide range of xenobiotics, including azoles [60,61].
Additional reports underline the involvement of ABC
transporters in contributing to fungicide resistance also
in plant pathogenic Pezizomycotina [62,63]. Since most
of this research has focused on PDR-type transporters, it
will be interesting to analyze also the contribution of

Becher et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/52

azole-responsive MDR- and MRP-type proteins in the
future.
Transcription factors have been identified as additional elements in conferring fungicide resistance
[64,65]. Since the corresponding transcriptional networks vary to some degree when comparing species in
the Saccharomycotina [64,66] it is important to extend
such analyses to Pezizomycotina, including toxigenic
plant pathogens like F. graminearum. Among the genes
with significantly increased transcript levels, we detected
several similarities with genes encoding the transcriptional regulators Upc2 and Tac1 known to be involved
in azole responses in S. cerevisiae and/or C. albicans.
Also in C. albicans transcript levels of Upc2 and Tac1
increased in response to azole-stress [36,67]. In both
yeasts, UPC2 homologs are activators of genes encoding
proteins for ergosterol-biosynthesis and sterol uptake
[35,67-69]. In C. albicans a disruption of Upc2 induced
hypersusceptibility and its overexpression increased
azole resistance [70]. A G648D exchange in UPC2 created an allele that constitutively up-regulated Erg11
expression and thereby improved azole resistance. Similarly, Tac1 in C. albicans and Pdr1 in S. cerevisiae regulate the PDR-type ABC transporter genes Cdr1, Cdr2,
and Pdr5, respectively [36,71]. In these two yeasts transcription factors mediate the response to azoles by regulating the expression not only of genes for ergosterol
biosynthesis but also of efflux transporters. Other putative regulators with significantly increased transcript
levels were similar to CRZ1 from S. cerevisiae and
C. albicans, a transcription factor that is involved in regulating cell wall integrity [37]. This may reflect a more
general response of the fungus in surviving the fungicide
treatment. Apart from putative transcription factors with
similarity to proteins reported to coordinate azole stress
responses in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans we found
additional azole-responsive transcription factors in
F. graminearum. The response of these factors may
reflect differences in transcriptional regulation of azole
response that are either specific for F. graminearum or
higher taxonomic levels.

Conclusions
This study introduces a novel F. graminearum microarray that is flexible and cost effective due to its multiplex
format. Gene expression analyses investigating the tebuconazole response indicated that this array when analyzed with proper bioinformatic tools will be very
helpful in fungicide research, e.g. in elucidation of
mechanisms of fungicide resistance or mode-of-action,
and beyond. Detailed analyses of genes encoding ergosterol biosynthesis proteins, ABC transporters, and transcription factors established a base for functional studies
