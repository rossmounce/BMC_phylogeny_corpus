Conclusion: Together, these data suggest that transposable elements have a profound impact on
the M. oryzae genome by creating localized segments with increased rates of chromosomal
rearrangements, gene duplications and gene evolution.

Magnaporthe oryzae, a member of the M. grisea species
complex [1], causes blast disease of rice and is one of the most
destructive pathogens of this important food crop [2]. Its
recently published genome sequence [3] is the first for a plant

pathogenic filamentous fungus and is providing new insight
into the molecular and genetic basis for pathogenesis. M.
oryzae shares a number of traits with other plant pathogenic
fungi, such as the formation of specialized infection structures called appressoria that are important in penetrating the

interactions

Results: We found significant levels of conserved synteny between chromosome 7 and the
genomes of other filamentous fungi, despite more than 200 million years of divergent evolution.
Transposable elements are largely restricted to three clusters located in chromosomal segments
that lack conserved synteny. In contradiction to popular evolutionary models and observations
from other model organism genomes, we found a positive correlation between recombination rate
and the distribution of transposable element clusters on chromosome 7. In addition, the
transposable element clusters are marked by more frequent gene duplications, and genes within
the clusters have greater sequence diversity to orthologous genes from other fungi.

Background: Transposable elements are abundant in the genomes of many filamentous fungi, and
have been implicated as major contributors to genome rearrangements and as sources of genetic
variation. Analyses of fungal genomes have also revealed that transposable elements are largely
confined to distinct clusters within the genome. Their impact on fungal genome evolution is not
well understood. Using the recently available genome sequence of the plant pathogenic fungus
Magnaporthe oryzae, combined with additional bacterial artificial chromosome clone sequences, we
performed a detailed analysis of the distribution of transposable elements, syntenic blocks, and
other features of chromosome 7.

plant epidermis. M. oryzae, along with many other plant
pathogens, also exhibits a genetically controlled pattern of
host recognition, called the gene-for-gene interaction, that
mediates host range [4]. Because of the commonality of these
features among plant pathogenic fungi, its genetic tractability, and its economic importance, M. oryzae has been developed as a model for studying infection related morphogenesis
and fungal-plant interactions [5].
The genome of M. oryzae, like that of many living organisms,
is rich in repetitive DNA. Analysis of the whole genome shotgun sequence (WGS) suggests that more than 9.7% of the
genome is made up of repetitive DNA, a significant portion of
which is derived from transposable elements (TEs) [3]. TEs
have had an important impact on the genome and TE insertions are known to cause mutations in genes that mediate
host range [6-8]. Previous studies have shown that TEs are
arranged in distinct clusters in the genome [9-14]. Clustered
TE distribution has been reported in many organisms, though
in most cases the actual mechanisms leading to this distribution are unknown. In many species, including Drosophila
melanogaster [15], Arabidopsis thaliana [16], and Tetraodon nigroviridis [17], TEs tend to accumulate in heterochromatic regions of the chromosomes, leading to a negative
correlation between genetic recombination rate and TE density. The most common explanation for this is that selection
against the deleterious effects of TEs is weaker in chromosomal regions with lower recombination rate, although
exceptions to this model are also known. In D. melanogaster,
TEs are preferentially clustered in regions with low recombination rate [18], while in C. elegans, a positive correlation
between recombination rate and DNA transposons has been
observed [19]. Clearly, the selection model is insufficient to
explain the distribution of TEs in all cases.
A prior study of one of the first full length sequences of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone from the M. oryzae
genome showed that this approximately 100 kb segment
shared a considerable amount of synteny with Neurospora
crassa and opens the possibility that more extensive conservation of synteny may exist between these species [20]. This
conservation of synteny is unexpected, since it is well known
that M. oryzae isolates have extremely variable karyotypes
due, at least in part, to the presence of transposable elements
[11,21]. Estimates of divergence dates within the ascomycetous fungi suggest that M. oryzae and N. crassa may be separated by more than 200 million years of divergent evolution
[22]. The ancient radiation of these fungi and the karyotype
variability do not fit the expectation that large segments of
conserved synteny should exist between M. oryzae and other
species.
The availability of whole genome sequences for M. oryzae [3],
N. crassa [23] and several other filamentous fungi are now
allowing for more in-depth analyses of the organization of
repetitive elements and their role in the evolution of fungal

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/2/R16

genomes. Recently, we completed a draft sequence of 38 BAC
clones spanning chromosome 7 from M. oryzae, which we
combined with selected contigs from the M. oryzae WGS, to
yield a new chromosome 7 sequence assembly that was 4 Mb
in length and contained 50 gaps. We used this sequence to
measure the extent of conserved synteny between M. oryzae
and the genome sequences of N. crassa, Fusarium graminearum and Aspergillus nidulans. We found that large segments of conserved synteny could be identified between these
fungi and that syntenic blocks were negatively correlated with
clusters of TEs. In addition, we found that chromosomal
regions containing TE clusters also have higher rates of gene
duplications and rates of gene evolution.

Results
Content and distribution of repetitive DNA
The combined BAC-WGS sequence of chromosome 7 is
3,997,066 base-pairs (bp) in length, including fifty 200 bp
gaps. The centromere has been genetically mapped to a
region between markers CH5-75H and cos156 (Figure 1; M
Farman, personal communication). This region also contains
a single gap, which probably represents the centromere, since
centromere-like sequences were not found in the flanking
BAC sequences. The sequence ends are estimated to be less
than 40 kb from the telomeres, based on the presence of telomeric repeats found within the fosmid end sequences that
make up the WGS (M Farman and C Rehmeyer, personal
communication). Using a curated set of TE reference
sequences, we scanned the chromosome 7 sequence with
RepeatMasker [24]. We determined that nearly 14% of chromosome 7 is composed of repetitive DNA, considerably more
than the estimate of 8.2% that we obtained from the WGS
alone. This increase of nearly 6% can be attributed to the
increased sequence coverage that was derived from the BAC
sequences, as well as improvements to the assembly through
manual editing. Virtually all of the repetitive DNA found on
chromosome 7 was in the form of TEs, with simple sequence
repeats and other types of repeats comprising less than 1% of
the total repetitive DNA content. In terms of number of elements, diversity (number of families) and overall contribution to the sequence, long terminal repeat (LTR)
retrotransposons are the most common class (Table 1). At
least 7 families of LTR type retrotransposons exist in the M.
oryzae genome, all of which are found on chromosome 7 and
make up 8.8% of the sequence.
We analyzed the distribution of TEs in chromosome 7 by
defining non-overlapping 100 kb intervals across the
sequence and measuring repetitive sequence content as the
number of TEs per interval, and normalizing for gaps. A histogram of these data clearly indicates the presence of three
clusters on chromosome 7 (Figure 1), containing both class I
(retrotransposons) and class II (DNA transposons) elements.
The presence of TE clusters on chromosome 7 is consistent
with our earlier report of TE clustering based on analyses of

TEs are frequently reported to be associated with both telomeres and centromeres, although gaps in the combined chromosome 7 sequence prevent analyses of these regions.
However, the analysis presented here indicates that TEs, in
addition to being found in telomeric and centromeric regions,
are also found in abundance in other parts of the chromosome. No such clustering of simple sequence repeats (SSRs)
was evident, although a slight depression in SSR frequency
was observed within TE clusters (Figure 1). Likewise, a slight
depression in gene content was evident in regions of high TE

that the centromere would map to the segment with the
lowest recombination rate. However, interval 6 has the lowest
recombination rate, but the centromere is mapped to interval
3 between markers CH5-75H and cos156 (M Farman, personal communication). It is likely that recombination rate
depression in the vicinity of the centromere is a highly localized effect, and not evident in the coarse scale of the genetic
map. Transposable element content was expressed as the percentage of DNA derived from TEs identified with RepeatMasker. Using a Spearman rank correlation test, we determined
that there is a significant (P = 0.02) positive correlation
between chromosome recombination rate and TE content
(Figure 3). To determine whether this pattern was representative of the whole genome, we repeated the test using the
WGS. Of the 119 genetic markers that were anchored to the
WGS, 64 were removed from the analysis because they were
anchored to multiple locations in the genome or because the
order of markers on the physical map was not consistent with
the genetic map. The remaining markers were used to define
54 intervals on all seven chromosomes. Using this data set, we
also found a significant (P = 0.0003) positive correlation
between recombination rate and TE content, indicating that
the pattern of TE distribution observed in chromosome 7 is
representative of the whole genome.

Blocks of conserved synteny
The FISH software package provides a fast algorithm to identify chromosomal segments with conserved synteny and
includes a statistical evaluation of the segments [27]. Using
FISH, we identified 21 syntenic blocks (P < 0.001) between
chromosome 7 and the N. crassa genome that ranged in size
from 5 to 16 orthologous gene pairs (Table 2). The largest
block consists of 16 conserved gene pairs, and spans 86,053
bp of chromosome 7, a region that includes 30 predicted
genes. The remaining 14 genes in the segment either did not
have identifiable homologs in N. crassa or had homologs to
genes that were not identified as members of the syntenic
block. Interestingly, all of the blocks were found on N. crassa
chromosome 1, though the relative order of the syntenic
blocks was not retained between the two chromosomes. We
found similar patterns of conserved synteny when we used
the same analytical methods to compare chromosome 7 to
two other filamentous fungi. Seventeen blocks were identified
between chromosome 7 and the F. graminearum genome, 14
of which were found on chromosome 2. The remaining three
were found on chromosome 4, suggesting either a translocation of a large chromosomal segment in the F. graminearum
lineage or an error in the genetic map. Only two syntenic
blocks were identified in A. nidulans, reflecting its greater
evolutionary distance to M. oryzae.

Increased gene duplications and rates of gene evolution
within TE clusters

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R16

information

The recent availability of whole genome shotgun sequences
for several filamentous fungi affords us the opportunity for
the first time to perform an in-depth analysis of the evolution
of the structure of fungal genomes. With the combined BACWGS sequence for chromosome 7, we have a more accurate
estimate of the true repetitive DNA content of the chromosome as well as a better reference sequence with which to
study conservation of synteny. The M. oryzae genome is
known to be rich in repetitive DNA and several authors have
shown that, based on analyses of genomic libraries, TEs are
not distributed randomly across the genome, but are tightly
clustered. Our analysis of chromosome 7 revealed the

interactions

The relative rates of evolution between proteins encoded by
genes within TE clusters and outside of clusters were compared by computing the evolutionary distance to orthologous
proteins in the N. crassa and F. graminearum genomes. This
analysis assumes that all of the orthologous protein pairs
diverged at approximately the same time [30]. While the
divergence time may not necessarily be the same for all
orthologous protein pairs, the mean time of divergence within
and outside of the TE clusters should be similar. Putative
orthologs to proteins from chromosome 7 were identified

Discussion

refereed research

The borders of the three TE clusters were manually defined by
inspecting the chromosome browser available at the
Chromosome 7 Sequencing Project homepage [28]. The TE
clusters span over 88% of the TEs and 40% of the predicted
genes on the chromosome (Figure 2). Using the protein
sequence clustering tool TRIBE-MCL [29], we grouped chromosome 7 proteins into families. This clustering resulted in
the classification of 74 proteins into 32 families of 2 to 4 proteins per family. Percent identity within these families ranged
from 28.8% to 100%, with an average of 42.3% identity.
Examination of the distribution of gene family members
revealed that 62% of the genes were found within the TE clusters while 84% of the families contain at least 1 member
within a TE cluster, suggesting that gene duplications are
more prevalent within the TE clusters.

from the genomes of N. crassa and F. graminearum by performing BLASTP searches. Orthologs could be identified in N.
crassa for 12.7% of the genes within TE clusters and 59.8%
outside of the clusters (Table 3). The orthologous protein
pairs were aligned over their full length and rate of evolution
was inferred by computing Kimura's distance [31] for each
alignment. The average distance between orthologous protein
pairs was significantly higher between orthologous genes
within the TE clusters (0.963) than outside of the TE clusters
(0.735), based on a two-tailed Student's t test (P < 0.05).
When this analysis was repeated using the F. graminearum
genome, we obtained a similar pattern of evolutionary rates
(Table 3).

presence of three clusters of TEs, two of which are localized
near the distal ends of the chromosome while the other is centrally located. The locations of the TEs are positively correlated with recombination rate, a finding that is not predicted
by the popular selection models that describe the TE distribution in several other species [15,32]. Several sources of selective pressure are proposed to play a role in the establishment
of this type of distribution. The ectopic exchange model states
that repetitive DNA promotes deleterious ectopic recombination events. Since negative selection would be reduced in
regions of low recombination rate, repetitive DNA would
accumulate in regions with low recombination rate. Under
the insertion model, TE insertions generally have a deleterious effect on fitness, and are thus likely to be lost from the
population. In chromosomal segments that have low recombination rates, deleterious mutations are more likely to be
genetically linked to neutral genes, decreasing their negative
fitness effect.
Many TEs are known to selectively integrate into specific
sequences and this activity, known as site specificity, has also
been proposed to play a role in biased TE distribution. Site
specificity has been demonstrated for TEs from a wide array
of species, including D. melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and others [33]. In most
cases, TEs tend to integrate into intergenic regions. For example, the S. pombe TE Tf1 preferentially integrates into a region
100 to 420 bp upstream of translation start sites, though this
specificity does not lead to biased TE distribution on a
genome level [33]. The S. cerevisiae LTR transposons Ty1-

Ty4 tend to integrate into regions upstream of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and, in the case of
Ty3, it has been demonstrated that interactions between Ty3
integration factors and Pol III transcription factors are
responsible for this site specificity [34,35]. In S. cerevisiae,
tRNA genes, which are transcribed by Pol III, dispersed
throughout the genome and are not correlated with TE clusters. As shown by Bachman et al. [36], the Ty1 element preferentially inserts into upstream regions of specific members
of tGly and tThr genes, leading to a biased genomic distribution
of Ty1. Analysis of predicted tRNA genes in chromosome 7
revealed that the tRNA genes are distributed evenly throughout the chromosome (data not shown). Specificity for tRNA
genes could explain the distribution of TEs in the M. oryzae
genome only if all TE families had the same site specificity, for
example, to the same members of tRNA gene families and the
targeted family members were also positively correlated with
recombination rate. Ty1 elements have also been shown to
have specificity for pre-existing LTR transposons [36,37],
which would likely result in the formation of TE clusters;
however, selection models still are needed to explain the correlation between the distribution of TE clusters and recombination rate.
As is the case in M. oryzae, a positive correlation has also
been described between DNA transposons and recombination rate in C. elegans, although no such correlation was
found for retrotransposons [19]. Unlike C. elegans, both retrotransposons and DNA transposons show a positive correlation with recombination rate in M. oryzae. C. elegans is

Based on the data presented here, we suggest that specific
segments of chromosome 7 rapidly lose conserved synteny as
a result of rearrangements promoted by increased recombination rate and by the presence of TEs. These rearrangements

interactions

Seventy four of the 1,151 predicted proteins on chromosome 7
could be grouped into paralogous families by sequence similarity, of which 64.8% were located within a TE cluster. However, the TE clusters span only 40% of the predicted genes,
suggesting that duplicated genes may be more common
within TE clusters. If TE clusters lose synteny at a faster rate
due to chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations
and deletions, then it is reasonable to expect that duplications
would also occur with greater frequency in these regions. By
comparing protein sequences from chromosome 7 to orthologous proteins from F. graminearum and N. crassa, we show
that evolutionary distance was significantly greater in genes
found within the TE clusters. If, on average, the protein pairs
within TE clusters diverged from their orthologs at approximately the same time, then this result can be used to infer rate
of evolution and we can conclude that genes within the TE
clusters are evolving at a faster rate. Therefore, high recombination rate in M. oryzae is associated with increased number
of gene duplications, increased rate of gene evolution and
with loss of synteny, a pattern that has also been described in
wheat [40,41].

refereed research

The divergence dates of the species included in this study are
difficult to estimate, due to the sparse fossil record for fungi.
Based on the phylogeny published by Berbee and Taylor [38],
we estimate that the earliest radiation of the Sordariomycetes, which includes Magnaporthe, Fusarium, and Neurospora, was approximately 200 MYA and the divergence of
the Aspergillus lineage from this group occurred at least 300
MYA. More recent work by Padovan et al. [39] suggests that
these radiations may be up to 653 MYA and 930 MYA, respectively. Based on these estimates, our initial expectation was
that little conservation of synteny at the chromosome level
would be evident between these fungi and the early reports of
conserved microsynteny between M. oryzae and N. crassa
[20] were presumed to be rare exceptions. However, we
found that a significant number of syntenic blocks exist
between these species, suggesting that portions of these chromosomes still share common ancestry. The syntenic blocks
that we detected contain a large number of intervening nonsyntenic genes, many of which did have homologs in the other
fungal genomes but to genes in other chromosomal locations,
indicating that translocations of small DNA segments containing only one or a few genes occurred over large distances.
Perturbations of gene order within blocks were also common
and probably resulted from small scale rearrangements.

over at non-homologous chromosomal sites, which can lead
to chromosomal rearrangements and loss of conserved synteny. Such a correlation has been reported in wheat, where
indirect selection due to gene hitchhiking has been hypothesized to be the driving factor in the biased distribution of
conserved synteny [40]. Indirect selection is stronger in
regions of low recombination, leading to reduced levels of
polymorphism, such as insertions and translocations. It is
likely that both the presence of repetitive DNA and high
recombination rate promote the ectopic recombination
events that result in a loss of synteny between species.

highly inbred, and it has been suggested that this may reduce
the effects of recombination rate-based selective pressures on
the genome. While M. oryzae is a naturally outbreeding species, it is commonly recognized that sexual reproduction
occurs only rarely in the field and it is primarily disbursed
through asexual propagules. Therefore, the selective pressures imposed by meiotic recombination, though still
present, may not be strong enough to force the distribution of
TEs into regions of low recombination rate and some force,
but not recombination, must be driving the clustering of TEs
in the M. oryzae genome.

*Average distance of all orthologous protein pairs between the indicated species and chromosome 7; distance (D) was computed using Kimura's
method. The values were significantly different (P < 0.05) based on a two-tailed Student's t test.

The sequence of chromosome 7 from M. oryzae, strain 70-15,
was obtained from the chromosome 7 sequencing project [28]
(GenBank: CM000230). The whole genome shotgun
sequences for M. oryzae, N. crassa, F. graminearum, and A.
nidulans were obtained from the Broad Institute Fungal
Genome Initiative web site [42].

package [27]. The FISH algorithm identifies segmental
homologies (syntenic blocks) between chromosomal segments either within or between species and uses as input a set
of homologous markers. We used as input to the FISH package the results of a BLASTP search in which the predicted
proteins from chromosome 7 were used as the query
sequences and the proteome set (the set of annotated proteins
available from the Broad Institute) for N. crassa, F. graminearum, and A. nidulans were used as blast databases. Thus,
one chromosome 7 protein may match more than one protein
from another species and these one-to-many mappings were
included in the analysis. The default parameters for the FISH
software package were used except that the minimal acceptable alignment score (bit score) between protein sequences
was raised to 500. Syntenic blocks that contained five or more
pairs of genes (P < 0.001) were retained. For the purpose of
this analysis, protein pairs within statistically significant syntenic blocks were considered to be orthologs.

Annotation

Analysis of gene duplications and rate of evolution

Known repetitive elements were identified and masked from
the chromosome 7 sequence with RepeatMasker [24], using a
previously prepared database of repetitive elements from the
M. oryzae genome [43]. Additional annotations (for example,
blast searches, expressed sequence tags (EST) alignments)
were performed using the masked sequence. The gene prediction program FGENESH (Softberry Corporation, Mount
Kisco, NY, USA) trained to predict M. oryzae genes [3] was
used to identify 1,151 putative gene coding sequences. Recombination rate was measured by identifying the physical locations of nine genetic markers on the chromosome and using
them as a basis for delineating eight intervals spanning chromosome 7. The markers, previously anchored to the M.
oryzae BAC library [9,44], were assigned locations on the
chromosome by aligning BAC end sequences to the chromosome sequence. The position of each marker was estimated by
taking the average location of all BAC end sequences
anchored to both a marker and to the chromosome.

Duplicated genes were identified by clustering the protein
sequences with TRIBE-MCL. An E value cutoff of 1e-5 was
used for the initial BLASTP search. A multiple sequence
alignment was computed for each cluster using the Muscle
program [45] and the mean percentage identity for each cluster was computed as the mean of all pairwise comparisons
within the cluster. Putative orthologs to proteins from the N.
crassa and F. graminearum genomes were defined as
BLASTP hits with an E value smaller than 1e-30 that had no
other hits better than 1e-5. Pairwise sequence alignments
were performed with the Muscle program and evolutionary
distance was calculated using Kimura's method as implemented in the Phylip package [31,46].

may also contribute to the formation of new genes by gene
duplication, as is suggested by the presence of a higher than
expected number of duplicated genes within the TE clusters.
Furthermore, within the TE clusters, genes are less likely to
have orthologs in N. crassa and F. graminearum than genes
outside of the TE clusters. Based on these findings, we propose that TE clusters are major contributors to the genesis
and evolution of new genes in the M. oryzae genome.
