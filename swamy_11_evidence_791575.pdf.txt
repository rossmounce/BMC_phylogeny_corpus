Abstract
Background: Divergence of transcription factor binding sites is considered to be an important source of regulatory
evolution. The associations between transcription factor binding sites and phenotypic diversity have been
investigated in many model organisms. However, the understanding of other factors that contribute to it is still
limited. Recent studies have elucidated the effect of chromatin structure on molecular evolution of genomic DNA.
Though the profound impact of nucleosome positions on gene regulation has been reported, their influence on
transcriptional evolution is still less explored. With the availability of genome-wide nucleosome map in yeast species,
it is thus desirable to investigate their impact on transcription factor binding site evolution. Here, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the role of nucleosome positioning in the evolution of transcription factor binding sites.
Results: We compared the transcription factor binding site frequency in nucleosome occupied regions and
nucleosome depleted regions in promoters of old (orthologs among Saccharomycetaceae) and young
(Saccharomyces specific) genes; and in duplicate gene pairs. We demonstrated that nucleosome occupied regions
accommodate greater binding site variations than nucleosome depleted regions in young genes and in duplicate
genes. This finding was confirmed by measuring the difference in evolutionary rates of binding sites in sensu stricto
yeasts at nucleosome occupied regions and nucleosome depleted regions. The binding sites at nucleosome
occupied regions exhibited a consistently higher evolution rate than those at nucleosome depleted regions,
corroborating the difference in the selection constraints at the two regions. Finally, through site-directed
mutagenesis experiment, we found that binding site gain or loss events at nucleosome depleted regions may
cause more expression differences than those in nucleosome occupied regions.
Conclusions: Our study indicates the existence of different selection constraint on binding sites at nucleosome
occupied regions than at the nucleosome depleted regions. We found that the binding sites have a different rate of
evolution at nucleosome occupied and depleted regions. Finally, using transcription factor binding site-directed
mutagenesis experiment, we confirmed the difference in the impact of binding site changes on expression at these
regions. Thus, our work demonstrates the importance of composite analysis of chromatin and transcriptional evolution.

Background
The chromatin of eukaryotic genomes is compacted into
several levels. Nucleosomes, which form the lowest level
of compaction, are made up of ~147 bp of DNA
wrapped around a histone protein complex and interspersed by ~50 bp of exposed linker DNA. In recent

years, the occupancy of nucleosome positions in yeasts
has been investigated by using different approaches
(such as tiling arrays and parallel sequencing), which
employs micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion [1-3].
The results show that about 70-80% of the yeast genome
is occupied by nucleosomes [4-6]. The intrinsic mechanisms that determine the nucleosome locations have long
been of interest to researchers. Studies of budding yeast
have discovered dinucleotides (AA/TT/AT) periodicity
along nucleosome positioning sequences [7,8]; and that
nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) are characterized

by positioned stretches of poly (dA:dT) tracts [9,10]. In
addition, a number of patterns of nucleosome occupancy have been observed. For example, a ~140 bp
NDR is often found upstream of the transcription start
site flanked by -1 and +1 nucleosomes, with the +1
nucleosome located ~13 bp downstream from the transcription start site [11,12]. It has also been found that,
near the 5’ end of genes, a uniform 165 bp spacing of
nucleosomes (18 bp linker) extends to as many as nine
nucleosomes [5-8,13-15]. Importantly, many of these
features are evolutionary conserved [7,16].
It is known that the transcription mechanism in
eukaryotes functions at different levels, e.g. at the DNA
sequence level, transcription factors interact with cisregulatory sequences; and at the chromatin level, where
the chromatin allows the chromosomal segments to
switch between activated state and suppressed states of
transcription [17,18]. The interplay of changes in
nucleosome occupancy and transcriptional machinery at
each level suggests a strong association between nucleosome positioning and transcription mechanism [19,20].
For example, TATA-less promoters, which are characterized by NDRs, are frequently linked to basal transcription. Conversely, the promoters of TATAcontaining genes tend to be occupied by nucleosomes
and are stress responsive [13,21,22]. Moreover, it has
been demonstrated that nucleosomes could facilitate the
recognition of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs),
and guide transcription factors to their target sites in a
DNA sequence [22,23]. As an example, Maffey et al.
[24] characterized the constraints imposed by well positioned nucleosomes on the interaction of androgen
receptors with their binding sites, which are located in
the proximal promoters of murine probasin genes. The
above evidence confirms the importance of the association between nucleosome positioning and transcriptional
regulation. Such evidence in turn raises the interesting
issue of the role of nucleosomes in constraining evolutionary changes in TFBSs.
Recent studies have identified the evolutionary features related to nucleosome organization in yeasts
[9,25]. For example, it has been found that nucleosome
free linker regions have a lower evolution rate than
nucleosome occupied regions (NRs) [9,25]. In an
another study, a large-scale comparative genomic analysis of distantly related yeasts found that gene expression
divergence is coupled with the evolution of DNAencoded nucleosome organization [26]. Further, by analyzing the nucleosome position of two closely related
yeast species, Tirosh et al. [27] indicated that the major
contribution towards divergence of nucleosome positioning is through mutations in the local sequences (ciseffects). Moreover, the sequences that quantitatively
affect nucleosome occupancy were found to evolve

under compensatory dynamics while maintaining heterogeneous levels of AT content [28]. Considering the
fact that significant fraction of regulatory variation can
be attributed to changes in cis-regulatory elements
[29-32], understanding the evolutionary process requires
the investigation of all the factors that contribute to
TFBS evolution [33]. With the availability of the whole
genome nucleosome map in yeast species [34], it is thus
desirable to extend existing studies on regulatory
regions from an evolutionary perspective while considering the presence of chromatin structure. In this paper,
we have attempted a more comprehensive analysis to
demonstrate that nucleosome occupancy in yeast promoters plays an important role in the evolutionary
changes in TFBSs.
To determine the evolutionary features of TFBSs constrained by nucleosome occupancy, we first investigated
the distribution of TFBSs in NRs and NDRs that regulate 1) orthologous genes of Saccharoymyces cerevisiae,
Candida glabrata, and Kluyveromyces lactis (Saccharomycetaceae); and 2) those that specifically regulate S.
cerevisiae (Saccharomyces specific) genes, which represent young genes. We found that TFBS locations in
orthologous genes are dominant in NDRs, but those in
Saccharomyces specific genes appear more frequently in
NRs. To further validate this evolutionary tendency, we
investigated the distribution of TFBSs in NRs and NDRs
in duplicate gene pairs of yeast that might have undergone relaxation of selection pressure. Since TFBS variations are due to difference in consensus sequences and
nucleotide substitutions can promote diversification of
regulatory elements [35,36], these interesting findings
motivated us to estimate the evolution of TFBSs by
position-specific evolution rates [37]. The evolution
rates of TFBSs were found to be higher at NRs than
their depleted counterparts (NDRs). Finally, the impact
of TFBS changes on gene expression at NRs and NDRs
were evaluated using site-directed mutagenesis of TFBS
and real-time PCR analysis. Our findings on the evolutionary events in TFBSs suggest that 1) NRs can accommodate more changes that contribute to the variation in
TFBSs, and 2) the selection constraints of NRs and
NDRs are different. Future analyses of data across different biological conditions can reflect on the role of variations in TFBSs.

Methods
Collecting yeast TFBSs

The genome sequence and the gene and chromosome
annotations of the yeast species examined in this study
were obtained from a recent compilation in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) [38]. The target genes

related yeasts from the Saccharomyces sensu stricto

clade, namely, S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S.
kudriavzevii and S. bayanus, were retrieved from the
MYBS database http://cg1.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~mybs/[39]
(Figure 1a). MYBS contains integrated information
derived from an array of experimentally verified and
predicted consensus or position weight matrices
(PWMs) that correspond to 183 known yeast transcription factors.
To improve the accuracy of binding site search, traditional methods impose filters such as phylogenetic
footprinting information and transcription factor-DNA
binding affinity by setting the p-value in a ChIP-chip
experiment. However, during inter- or intra-species
evolutionary analysis, using conservation of phylogenetic footprinting as primary criteria will not be feasible. In such cases, simply considering the constraints
of bound promoters in ChIP-chip data might be insufficient. Thus, in this current work, to control for the
specificity of TFBSs, we examined the reliable annotations of TFBSs for each transcription factor according
to the following criterion. For a transcription factor a,

that the p-value of the corresponding transcription factor ChIP-chip experiment for the gene should be ≤

TFBSs corresponding to the same transcription factor
were excluded from our analysis. In total, our dataset
contained 104 transcription factors with 29,193 TFBSs
in 2,522 promoters of S. cerevisiae. For TFBSs corresponding to the 104 transcription factors that occurred
at least once in all five sensu stricto species, including S.

Nucleosome occupancy information in S. cerevisiae

Genome-wide nucleosome occupancy data (Figure 1b)
of S. cerevisiae was retrieved from http://atlas.bx.psu.
edu/project/saccharomyces.html[11]. Mavrich et al. [11]
used MNase digested DNA from nucleosome core particles that were crosslinked with formaldehyde in vivo.
These were further immunopurified with antibodies
against tagged histones H3 and H4. After correction for
MNase bias and making calls on nucleosome locations,
a total of 1,206,057 individual nucleosomal DNAs were
sequenced using Roche GS20 (454 Life Sciences), and
then mapped to genomic coordinates obtained from
http://www.yeastgenome.org[38]. Furthermore, Mavrich
et al. established rules governing genomic nucleosome
organization in S. cerevisiae. They also developed a statistical model to predict nucleosome positions in terms
of nucleosome occupancy, and identified well positioned
and fuzzy nucleosomes. In this work, we consider both
well positioned and fuzzy nucleosomes.
Orthologous and Saccharomyces specific genes

We first examined the differential relationship between
the frequency distribution of TFBSs in orthologous
genes (in Saccharomycetaceae) and in genes only present in the descendent species S. cerevisiae, with respect
to nucleosome occupancy. For this task, we collected
the genome sequences of three diverged yeast species,
namely, S. cerevisiae, C. glabrata, and K. lactis, from
SGD [38]. Then, for each of the 2,522 genes in S. cerevisiae, we downloaded the “orthologous” genes in C. glabrata and K. lactis from the OrthoMCL-DB [41] (see
Table 1 and Figure 1c). Genes that existed in S. cerevisiae, but not in C. glabrata or K. lactis, are called “Saccharomyces specific” genes. Additional file 1 Table S1
lists 2,152 orthologous genes and 75 Saccharomyces
specific genes considered in our analysis.

Next, using the TFBSs from our set of transcription
factors, we computed the numbers of TFBSs in the
nucleosome occupied regions (NRs) and nucleosome
depleted regions (NDRs) of each gene (Table 1) based
on the genome wide nucleosome occupancy map of S.
cerevisiae [11] (Figure 1e). The measurement was performed separately on the orthologous genes and Saccharomyces specific genes. A TFBS was deemed to be in
NR (or NDR) if its location overlapped (or did not overlap) with that of the nucleosome positions retrieved
from Mavrich et al. [11]. For those TFBSs, we used a
two-sided c2-test to determine whether the differences
in their frequency in NRs and NDRs occurred more
often than under random expectation (Figure 1f). The
null hypothesis H0 is that the frequency distribution in
NRs is equal to the distribution in NDRs, and the alternative hypothesis is that they are different. We rejected
the null hypothesis under the criterion that the p-value
≤ 0.05.
Identifying duplicate genes in S. cerevisiae

We compiled a list of 1,048 independent duplicate pairs
in the S. cerevisiae genome by adopting a similar, but
more stringent, protocol to that developed by Gu et al.
[42]. First, we downloaded all available proteins in S. cerevisiae from the latest compilation of SGD [38]. To identify duplicate gene pairs (Figure 1d), we performed an allagainst-all BLASTP search on the entire proteome. Two
genes were regarded as duplicate pairs if they satisfied
the following three criteria. First, the expected value (E)
of reciprocal best hits during the BLASTP search should
be < 10-20. Second, the length of the alignable region (L)
between the two sequences should be greater than half of
the length of the longer protein. Third, their similarity
should be ≥ I, where I = 30% if L ≥ 150 amino acids (a.a.);
and I = 0.06 + 4.8L -0.32(1 + exp(-L/1000)) if L < 150 a.a..
Furthermore, all overlapping pairs and transposons containing genes were excluded to ensure that each gene
pair only occurred once in our dataset. Moreover, only
gene pairs with at least 150 informative codons were
retained for further analysis.
From the promoters of duplicate gene pairs, we computed the frequency of TFBSs in NRs and NDRs and
normalized them with the total number of TFBSs at
these regions (Figure 1e). Furthermore, we determined
whether the preference of the TFBSs at NRs and NDRs
were significantly different according to one-sided twosample proportion test (Figure 1f) under the criterion
that p-value < 0.01 (Table 2).
Calculating the evolution rates of TFBSs

We calculated the evolution rates of TFBSs in NRs and
NDRs based on the method proposed by Moses et al.
[37]. The rates were computed for all the TFBSs of

S. cerevisiae that were conserved in other sensu stricto
yeasts (Figure 1g). Using aligned promoters from the
same gene sets of sensu stricto yeasts [43], species tree
of these species [44,45] and parsimony algorithm [46],
we derived evolutionary inference by computing the
minimal number of changes (minimum parsimony)
needed to align each column of the promoters in all
four species with the promoters of S. cerevisiae. Promoter regions with missing sequences in the alignment
were treated as gaps and excluded.
The average evolution rate of a TFBS was obtained by
computing the sum of the minimal number of changes
over all positions, and then divided by its length. Given
that mutation rates at NRs are higher across the genome
when compared to NDRs [9,25], it could be intriguing
whether the evolutionary rates of TFBSs at NRs and
NDRs is an extrapolation of the genome-wide trend. In
this situation, using the complete set of promoter
sequences containing the TFBSs as a general background
can induce considerable bias. Hence, to control for such
context-inducible bias, we calculated the number of
changes in NRs and NDRs separately, by excluding the
positions containing TFBSs on each promoter. These two
calculations act as two types of backgrounds. The number of changes in a TFBS (at NRs and NDRs) was further
normalized by the number of changes in the respective
background (Figure 1g). Furthermore, for species with
short evolutionary distances, like those considered here,
the number of substitutions per site of a DNA sequence
determined by using parsimony methods is expected to
be similar to that obtained by applying maximum likelihood approach. We also investigated whether the median
evolution rate of TFBSs at NRs was statistically greater
than that of TFBSs at NDRs by applying the WilcoxonMann-Whitney U two-sample test with a stringent criterion that the p-value ≤ 0.01 (Figure 1h).
Mutagenesis for TFBSs

A yeast strain (BY4741 (BY), a descendant of S288C)
was grown in yeast extract-peptone-adenine-dextrose

(YPAD) medium [47] and harvested at the mid-log
phase. Overnight yeast cultures were used to prepare
the starting cultures with OD600 = 0.1 and grown in the
YPAD medium at 30°C with 250 rpm shaking. The
yeast cells were harvested at the OD600 = 1.0, and the
total RNAs were extracted by using the MasterPure™
yeast RNA purification kit (EPICENTRE), and contaminated DNAs were removed by treatment of DNaseI in
the same kit.
To determine the effects of TFBSs that have recently
evolved in related yeast species on expression difference,
we randomly chose TFBSs that have undergone gain or
loss events [48] from NRs and NDRs in S. cerevisiae
promoters for site-directed mutagenesis. Further, we
identified the nucleotides that cause TFBS gain or loss
in each gene for site-directed mutagenesis. The constructions were performed by PCR-based mutagenesis,
which involved two sequential steps [49]. First, the
TFBS region of interest in the BY gene was replaced by
a URA3 cassette with about 45 bp flanking homologous
regions to the gene of interest at both ends. To perform
the first transformation, we used the LiOAc/SS Carrier
DNA/PEG method [50], and the insertion of URA3 in
the TFBS region was confirmed by diagnostic PCR and
sequencing. The inserted URA3 was then replaced by a
second transformation with the appropriate fragment of
BY’s PCR-based TFBS-modified sequence (where the
specific transcription factor could not bind) in the
URA3-inserted strain. The second transformation was
performed by electroporation based on the user manual
of MicroPulser™ electroporator (BIORAD). The transformants were selected by 5-Fluoroorotic Acid (5-FOA)
counter selection. Only the strains (called swapped
strains) that carried the desired sequence (where the
specific transcription factor could not bind) survived
and formed colonies on the media with 5-FOA(4 g/ml).
The constructions in the TFBS region were confirmed
by diagnostic PCR and sequencing.
Perusing expression shifts with real-time PCR

To compare the mRNA levels of the candidate genes
(the genes in the mutagenesis and control groups), we
used SYBR green core reaction to perform quantitative
PCR (Applied Biosystems model 7,300 Real-Time PCR
System). Before performing real-time PCR, total RNAs
were first reverse transcribed by a high-capacity cDNA
reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) using
oligo dT primers as reverse transcription primers. Realtime PCR was performed on the final volume of 25 μL
containing 50 ng of the cDNA sample, 50 nM of each
gene-specific primer, and 12.5 μL of the SYBER green
Taq premixture [51]. The PCR conditions included
enzyme activation at 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10
min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for

Swamy et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/150

15 sec, and annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 min. To
verify that a single product had been amplified, a dissociation curve was generated at the end of each PCR
cycle using the software provided by the Applied Biosystems 7,300 Real-Time PCR System (version 1.4). The
relative expression of each gene was normalized to that
of the ACT1 gene (ΔCt, the Ct (cycle threshold) is
defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the defined threshold). In addition,
the amplification efficiency of each primer pair was
tested by using two-fold serial dilutions of the templates
as suggested by ABI. Finally, the mRNA levels of the
candidate genes were compared using a paired t-test.

Results
The distribution of TFBSs is constrained by nucleosome
occupancy

To understand the differences in the selection constraints due to nucleosome occupancy of the regulatory
sequences in yeast promoters, we first compared the distribution of TFBSs in orthologous genes of Saccharomycetaceae and Saccharomyces specific genes in NRs and
NDRs. For this task, we downloaded 2,152 genes of S.
cerevisiae that had orthologs in both C. glabrata and K.
lactis from OrthoMCL-DB [41] with 23,605 TFBSs and
75 Saccharomyces specific genes with 1144 TFBSs
(Table 1 see Materials and Methods for details). In Saccharomyces specific genes, frequency of TFBSs was
found to be higher in NRs than in NDRs; however, in
orthologous genes, TFBSs were more frequent in the
NDRs (Table 2). The p-value of the two-sided c2-test is
≤ 0.05, which indicates a significant association between
TFBSs and nucleosome occupancy, rather than random
expectation (see Materials and Methods). These results
suggest that young genes found only in the descendent
S. cerevisiae species exhibit more TFBS variation and
frequently occur in NRs, indicating a possible source of
the vicissitude in their regulatory sequences.
To verify the evolutionary tendency of TFBSs with
respect to nucleosome occupancy, we examined the distribution of TFBSs in the promoters of duplicate gene
pairs at NRs and NDRs. Our results (one-sided twosample proportion test; p-value < 10-40) indicated that
the duplicate pairs that have undergone relaxation of
the selection constraint [42,52-54] also exhibited more
TFBS variation at NRs than at NDRs (Table 2).

al. [25]. In this study, by determining the minimum parsimony of nucleotides at each position (see Materials
and Methods), we analyzed the impact of nucleosome
occupancy on the evolution rate of TFBSs in sensu
stricto yeasts (Figure 1g and 1h). We only considered
alignments of the sequences available in all five sensu
stricto species, i.e., we excluded regions containing gaps
in the alignment. Our dataset contained 21,930 TFBSs.
This analysis was performed separately on the TFBSs at
NRs and NDRs. Though, our data for evolutionary rate
scattered broadly, the median evolution rate of the
TFBSs in our dataset (Figure 2), is significantly higher at
NRs (0.45) than at NDRs (0.37) according to WilcoxonMann-Whitney U two-sample test (p-value = 1.61×1032
). Nevertheless, experimental errors in determining
nucleosome positions and TFBS prediction might be the
possible source of the broad scatter in the data and
could bias our result.
TFBS gain and loss events in NDRs show higher
possibility of altering gene expression

To evaluate the impact of TFBS change at NR and NDR
on gene expression, we randomly selected six TFBSs
that were known to have experienced gain or loss events
[48] from NDRs and NRs in S. cerevisiae promoters for
site-directed mutagenesis. The TFBSs corresponding to
gain or loss events were removed from the laboratory
strain (Additional file 2 Table S2). After which, we measured the expression changes in mutant/wild type
strains using quantitative PCR (real-time PCR). In the
six mutagenesis cases in both NRs and NDRs (t-test pvalue < 0.05), significant expression changes were found
between the mutant and wild type strains in three
TFBSs in NDRs (50%), while only one out of six TFBSs
in NRs demonstrated expression differences (Table 3).

Comparing the evolution rate of TFBSs at NRs and NDRs

Previous studies analyzed the dependence of nucleotide
substitution rates in the yeast genome by comparing
their positions on a map of nucleosome locations [9,25].
A relative difference (about 10%) in substitution rates
between the NDR and the equidistant centre point of
nucleosomal DNA (dyad) was reported in Washietl et

Figure 2 Evolution rate of TFBSs conserved in sensu stricto
yeast species at NRs and NDRs using minimum parsimony
method. The evolution rate of TFBSs in the sensu stricto species was
found to be higher at NRs than at NDRs (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U
two-sample test, p-value = 1.61×10-32).

Twelve genes that experienced TFBS gain or loss events at both NDRs and NRs were selected for site-directed mutagenesis and expression analysis. T-test was
based on ΔCt of swapped mutants and BY4741(wild type).
* Significantly different from ΔCtBY(p-value< 0.05) by t-test

These results indicate that TFBS gain or loss events at
NDRs may have a higher probability of causing expression differences than those at NRs.

Discussion
Evolutionary analysis in promoter regions has provided
important insights into the regulatory process and the
properties of TFBS motifs [30-32,48]. Yet, the current
understanding of TFBS evolution is limited, especially in
deciphering the extant of the contributions from other
DNA-binding factors such as nucleosomes, chromatin
remodelers and chromatin modifiers. While there are
several theories highlighting the influence of chromatin
architecture, specifically the nucleosome landscape on
the molecular evolution of genomic DNA [9,25], not
many studies focus on the role played by nucleosome in
TFBS evolution [34,55,56]. Further, studies have partially
resolved the effect of nucleosome arrangement patterns
on transcription [18,57]. Our goal here is to comprehensively elucidate the evolution of TFBSs due to the constraints on sequence structure affected by nucleosome
positioning in sensu stricto yeasts. We have conducted a
detailed evolutionary analysis of TFBSs with respect to
nucleosome occupancy by taking advantage of recently
published nucleosome map in S. cerevisiae [11]. Our
analysis has uncovered TFBS evolution changes in the
context of nucleosome occupancy by different
perspectives.
Our results suggest that the evolution of TFBSs in
yeast species has a noteworthy relationship with the
nucleosome organization encoded in promoter
sequences on a genome-wide scale. We found that
TFBSs in orthologous genes (shared in Saccharomycetaceae) were frequently located at NDRs, while TFBSs in

younger Saccharomyces specific genes were dominant at
NRs. Furthermore, genes that have undergone duplication are known to be under lower purifying (stabilizing)
selection [54,58]. In addition, promoters near duplicate
gene pairs are also known to have increased substitution
rates, indicating relaxation of selection constraints [53].
According to our results, the TFBSs at NRs in duplicated genes exhibited more variation in terms of their
occurrence frequency than those at NDRs. Consistently,
the expression divergence of duplicate genes confirms
rapid evolution, which could be attributed to cischanges, specifically to the variation of TFBSs [42,59].
These results are also concordant with our findings for
TFBSs in ancestral and young gene sets, reinforcing the
possibility of difference in selection across NRs and
NDRs. A possible source of difference could be ascribed
to the impinging of repair mechanisms of DNA
sequences by nucleosomes [60-63]. This is reflected by,
high mutation rates at NRs than at linker regions, which
are depleted of nucleosomes [9,25] and could conceivably explain the frequent occurrence of novel TFBSs in
these regions. In addition, a recent study has suggested
that natural selection acts to maintain genome-wide signature of nucleosome formation [64]. This study also
provided evidence for selection on conserving chromatin
structure, and contributes significantly in driving mutational bias at both coding and non-coding regions. Most
importantly, the above results reveal the significance of
conglomerate analysis of regulation and promoter
nucleosome status in explaining the regulatory evolution
[55].
The availability of whole genome nucleosome maps
has facilitated research on the regulatory process. As a
result, some studies have hinted that the existence of

Swamy et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/150

competition and co-operation between nucleosomes and
transcription factors may contribute to the regulatory
effects on expression divergence [26,65-67]. Since regulatory sequences are believed to play an important role
in molecular evolution [48,68,69], we explored the evolutionary significance of the dominance of TFBSs in
young genes located at NRs by comparing the evolution
rates of TFBSs at NRs and NDRs. Our results demonstrated that, at NRs, TFBS evolutionary rates were significantly higher than at NDRs, although the data seems
to be broadly scattered. This indicates the possibility
that NRs, which can accommodate more TFBSs variations, may contain binding site sequences with lower
purifying selection relative to NDRs. The finding is also
congruent with the recent work of Babbitt [70], which
indicated that the nonfunctional TFBS could escape purifying selection when they occur in high nucleosome
occupancy. It is likely that the weaker selection constraint on TFBSs at NRs plays an important role in the
creation of novel binding sites via stochastic mutational
processes [36,71]. Furthermore, the weaker selection
constraint at NRs can probably be explained by the fact
that DNA in nucleosomes is less accessible to DNA
binding proteins [72].
Functional constraint could be one of the major explanations for the different evolution rates in NRs and
NDRs. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate whether
there is a difference in impact of TFBS changes on
expression at NRs and NDRs. We provided an indirect
evidence via TFBS modification and expression analysis
(Table 3 and Additional file 2 Table S2) and revealed
that a larger fraction of swapped mutants at NDRs led
to expression shift than swapped mutants at NRs.
Although our data is limited, previous studies in several
species, including yeast have also indicated the role
played by nucleosome in regulating gene expression
[18,26,57]. These results suggest the possibility of difference in selection constraint on TFBSs at NRs and
NDRs.

Conclusions
Recent studies have indicated that nucleosome organization broadly influences regulatory evolution in yeast
[27,55]. For example, in the evolution of within species
cis-regulatory elements, it is known that polymorphism
in the regulatory sequences are interrelated to changes
in nucleosome occupancy [73,74]. The data from our
current analysis shows that NRs can contain more TFBS
variations, which in turn reflects the importance of
TFBSs located in NDRs [75]. We confirmed the difference in selection constraint at NRs and NDRs by measuring the evolutionary rates of TFBSs at these regions
Moreover, observations reported in literature support
our findings by demonstrating the differences in the

Page 8 of 10

accessibility of DNA to their binding proteins inside and
outside nucleosome occupied regions [60,62,72]. To
ensure the quality of our data, we took several precautions in data selection and have controlled for possible
source of bias in our estimates. Thus, the current analysis of the effect of nucleosome positions on the evolution of TFBSs can be considered reliable. Though our
study reveals an important feature in TFBS regulatory
evolution, a more direct analysis would be required to
address the nature of selection that drives the distinction in evolutionary rates.
