Abstract
Background: Rapid advances in research on antisense transcripts are gradually changing our comprehension of
genomic and gene expression aspects of the Herpesviridae. One such herpesvirus is the human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV). Although transcription of the HCMV UL87 gene has not been specifically investigated, cDNA clones of
UL87 antisense transcripts were found in HCMV cDNA libraries previously. In this study, the transcription of the
UL87 antisense strand was investigated in three clinically isolated HCMV strains.
Results: First, an 800 nucleotides transcript having an antisense orientation to the UL87 gene was found in a late
HCMV cDNA library. Then, the UL87 antisense transcript was confirmed by Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
and Northern blot in three HCMV clinical strains. Two ORFs were predicted in the antisense transcript. The putative
protein of ORF 1 showed a high degree of conservation among HCMV and other CMV strains.
Conclusion: An 800nt antisense transcript in the UL87 gene region exists in HCMV clinical strains.
Keywords: transcript, HCMV, UL87, antisense strand

Background
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the prototypical
member of the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. Seroepidemiologic studies have shown that the virus is widespread
in the human population [1-5]. Like other herpesviruses,
HCMV can not be completely eliminated by the
immune system and remains either as a low-level persistent infection or in a quiescent, latent state for the lifetime of the infected person. HCMV infection is
asymptomatic in most healthy adults, but causes lifethreatening disease in immunologically immature or
compromised individuals, including neonates [6,7],
AIDS patients [8], and allogeneic transplant recipients
[9].
Although the entire sequences of some HCMV strains
are available (GenBank: X17403.1, FJ616285.1,
GQ466044.1, GU179001, GU937742, and others), the
precise number and nature of the viral genes and gene
products are still in question. To date, most HCMV

genes have not been extensively characterized with
respect to their expression patterns. A remarkable accumulation of antisense (AS) transcripts during HCMV
infection, reported by Zhang et al. [10], suggests that
currently available genomic maps based on open reading
frame (ORF) and other in silico analyses may drastically
underestimate the true complexity of viral gene
products.
UL87 is one of the 208 ORFs of the HCMV AD169
strain (GenBank: X17403.1) predicted by Chee in 1990
[11], and was reevaluated to have coding potential by
Murphy [12]. Although UL87 was identified to encode
an early protein expressed during infection with HCMV
recombinant virus [13], its transcriptional pattern has
not been described. However, two AS transcripts overlapping the UL87 gene were obtained by screening a
HCMV cDNA library made during late infection, in the
study by Zhang et al. [10]. Moreover, we also found two
cDNA clones in a late HCMV cDNA library containing
the sequence of the UL87 AS strand [14].
In the present study, the HCMV UL87 AS transcript
was screened further in a late HCMV cDNA library.
The structure of the UL87 AS transcript was

investigated by RACE experiment and Northern blot in
three HCMV clinical strains. An unspliced AS transcript
of the UL87 gene was identified.

Results
AS transcripts in the UL87 region identified from the
HCMV cDNA library

Nineteen cDNA clones were identified as having
sequences congruent with the UL87 gene region by
graded PCR from the library. All of the 19 sequences possessed a poly(A) tail which was not coded by the HCMV
genome, and were found to be homologous to the complementary strand of the UL87 gene. The 5’ end of one of
the 19 sequences was located at nt 131055, and the 5’
ends of 17 other sequences were located at nt 130263.
One other sequence, with a 5’ end at nt 130261, was
most likely a truncated cDNA created during library preparation. The 3’ ends of the 19 sequences were all located
at nt 129489-129491 downstream of a poly(A) signal
(AATAAA) located at nt 129565-129570 (Figure 1). The
sequencing results for the cDNA clones suggested that
the transcripts present in the library correspond to the
AS orientation of the UL87 gene, of which an 800 nt
unspliced transcript was the dominant transcript.
3’ and 5’ ends of UL87 AS transcripts obtained by RACE
analysis

To confirm the existence of the UL87 AS transcripts,
and to find other potential forms of UL87 AS transcripts, both 5’ and 3’RACE analyses were employed
with late class RNAs of the three HCMV strains (X,
CH, H). The products of 3’ RACE for all three strains
showed an accordant band of about 500 bp (Figure 2).
Sequencing results demonstrated that the 3’ ends of the
UL87 AS transcripts of all three strains were located at
nt 129489-129491 downstream from a consensus poly
(A) signal at nt position 129465-129470, which was
identical to those of the transcripts derived from the
cDNA library.

(GeneBank: X17403.1).

Figure 2 The 5’ RACE (A) and 3’ RACE (B) results for the UL87
antisense transcript. All RACE experiments were performed using
L class RNA of the three clinically isolated strains (X, CH, H).

First, 5’ RACE experiments were performed using F1
and F2 (nested) primers (Table 1 Figure 1). An ~500 bp
product was found in all three strains (Figure 3). The
sequences from most of the clones of the 5’ RACE products initiated at nt position 130267, which was four
nucleotides upstream of the 5’ end at nt 130263 of the
transcript represented in the cDNA library. Two other
clones of the 5’ RACE product, of the CH strain,
initiated at nt positions 130264 and 130265, respectively.
Then, in order to confirm the 5’end at nt 131055
obtained in the cDNA library, two other nested primers
(F3 and F4) (Table 1 Figure 1) were used. Multiple 5’
ends were found, ranging from nt 130645 to nt 131430
in the three strains. However, no accordant results were
found among the three strains. Moreover, the 5’ end at
nt 131055 could not be validated in any of the strains.
The result suggested that complex structures may exist
in the 5’ end of the transcript.
UL87 AS transcripts confirmed by Northern blot

Northern blot analysis was performed using total cellular RNAs harvested from HELF cells infected with

HCMV H strain (immediate early, early, and late class),
and the total RNA of mock-infected cells was used as
control. RNAs were hybridized to a riboprobe (nt
129553 to 130049) complementary to the UL87 AS
region. An 800 nt transcript was detected in late class
RNA from HCMV-infected HELF cells, but not in
mock-infected HELF cells (Figure 3). This suggests that
the 800 nucleotide transcript is an UL87 AS transcript
expressed by HCMV.

the H strain. C: mock-infected HELF cells. M: the digoxigeninlabeled RNA molecular weight marker I, which was run
synchronously with the RNAs being investigated. To ensure that
equal amounts of RNA were loaded, 28S and 18S rRNAs stained by
EB were also included in the agarose gel.

The spatial location of the 800 nt UL87 AS transcript in
the HCMV genome, as well as the primers and riboprobe
used, are shown in Figure 1. The sequence of the area in
HCMV AD169 is detailed in Figure 4A. A non-conventional potential TATA promoter element (TATTA) is
present at 28 bp upstream of the RNA initiation site,
according to sequence data obtained through 5’ RACE.
Besides a consensus poly(A) signal (129465-129470)
located upstream, the 3’ terminus, a weak consensus G/T
cluster (GTGTCTGTGTCGGCAAATGTG, 129484129464) was found downstream of the 3’ terminus, an
element essential for cleavage of the 3’end of the mRNAs
[15,16].
Two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) were predicted in the transcript, which have the potential to
code for a 60-amino-acid and a 78-amino-acid protein,
respectively. Prosite motif research showed that there is
one N-myristoylation site and one Casein kinase II
phosphorylation site in both the predicted proteins, and
two Protein kinase C phosphorylation sites in the predicted protein encoded by ORF 1.

Position relative to AD169 strain (GeneBank: X17403.1).

To study how conserved the putative UL87 AS proteins are among HCMV and other CMV genomes, a
phylogenetic study was done using the UL87 AS homologous sequences of CCMV, MCMV, and HCMV of the
AD169, Merlin, and Towne strains, along with the three
clinical strains from this study. As shown in Figure 5,
the putative proteins encoded by ORF 1 were completely consistent among these HCMV strains. CCMV and
MCMV also have a similar ORF to the ORF1 of HCMV,
in the same region, with the main differences located at
the amino termini. The amino acid sequence of CCMV
had higher homology to that of HCMV than MCMV.
The ORF2 was absent in MCMV. The amino acid alignment of ORF2 did not show a high degree of conservation, in contrast to that of ORF 1, between HCMV and
CCMV. Even in HCMV strains, besides amino acid
changes, mutations in the termination site could be
found in the CH and Towne strains (Figure 5).

Discussion
In this study, the transcription of the AS strand of the
HCMV UL87 gene area was investigated, and an 800 nt
UL87 AS transcript was deeply characterized, which has
been found as a cDNA clone in a late HCMV cDNA

library [14]. The transcript was identified in three
HCMV clinical strains.
In the present study, several lines of evidence demonstrated that an ~800 nt unspliced UL87 AS transcript
existed among late-class transcripts during HCMV
infection. An additional poly(A) tail, which was not
coded by the genome, was found at the end of the UL87
AS transcript by sequencing the cDNA clones and 3’
RACE products, confirming that it was indeed polyadenylated. The potential TATA promoter element, the
consensus poly(A) signal, and the weak consensus G/T
cluster all provided evidence that the novel transcript
was a conventional mRNA, which could potentially
encode a protein.
Two small ORFs were predicted in the transcript,
which could encode proteins of 60 amino-acids and 78
amino-acids, respectively. Amino-acid sequence alignments showed that the putative protein of ORF 1 displayed highly conservation among the HCMV, CCMV,
and MCMV strains. It seems likely that ORF 1 could
have a protein-coding function. However, the two ORFs
were predicted neither in the preliminary analysis of the
HCMV genome by Chee et al. [11] nor in the re-analyses of the HCMV genome [12,17]. This is because in

Figure 5 Alignments of the putative UL87 AS protein 1 and protein 2 from several CMV genomes. Amino acid alignments were done
using MegAlign, from DNAstar, and Clustal W algorithms. The genomes compared included CCMV, MCMV, HCMV AD169, Merlin, Towne, and the
three clinical strains from this study.

Ma et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:515
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/515

these analyses the authors required that any putative
coding ORF encode a polypeptide of at least 100 or 80
amino acids in length. It will be important to ascertain
whether the two putative proteins are in fact present in
infected cells. Such studies are ongoing.
About 1.5 kb unspliced cDNA of UL87 AS transcripts
was found in the HCMV cDNA library. Two other
spliced AS transcripts expressed from the UL87 area
have also been obtained by screening a late HCMV
cDNA library [10]. Compared with the transcripts identified in the present study, they have different initiation
sites (nt 134496 and 132114) but the same termination
site. These results indicated that more than one transcript is expressed from the UL87 area in the AS orientation. There are several non-mutually exclusive
explanations to account for the failure to further confirm these transcripts in this study. First, the cDNA
library could not contain all of the transcripts that accumulate during infection, especially those expressed in
small quantities. Second, the transcripts may vary
among different strains and under different replication
conditions. Third, the possible lower abundance of these
transcripts in the infected HELF cells may have made
detection by Northern blot difficult in this study.
The 5’ RACE result with F3 and F4 as the specific
nested primers did not provide an authentic identical 5’
end. This could be attributed to the complicate secondary structure (hairpins or stem-loop caps) of mRNA 5’untranslated region (5’-UTR), which may block the
reverse transcription. Several RNA structures located in
the 5’-UTR of eukaryotes mRNA transcripts have been
shown to affect translation efficiency [18-20]. Further
investigation on the 5’ ends of other UL87 antisense
transcripts and the secondary structure of the 5’-UTR
would help to understand the characteristics of the transcript on translational regulation.
A recent study showed that a UL87 ORF was
expressed as an early viral protein [13]. In the present
study, no UL87 transcript was obtained when screening a HCMV cDNA library using primers located in
the UL87 gene area. The cDNA library used in the
study should contain HCMV transcripts of each infection phase, although mainly of the late class genes.
However, DNA sequence analyses of several HCMV
strains (AD169, GenBank: X17403.1; Merlin, GenBank:
GU179001.1; Towne, GenBank: FJ616285.1) showed
that the nearest poly(A) signal (AATAAA) to the 3’
termini of the UL87 ORF was located 512 bp downstream of the UL94 ORF, which is about 10 kb from
the 5’ terminus of the UL87 gene. Therefore, the UL87
to UL94 genes could be co-expressed as a large polycistron. The full-length cDNA of this large transcript
could not be contained in the cDNA library. Nevertheless, our study along with those of others [10,13]

Page 6 of 9

confirmed that both strands of the UL87 gene area
have expression potential.
Abundant sense and antisense transcript pairs have
been found by Zhang et al [10]. They obtained direct
evidence for the existence of S-AS transcript pairs
derived from 38 known or predicted viral genes. Individual AS transcripts have also been described for many
herpesviruses, including the betaherpesviruses [21-23],
the gammaherpesviruses [24-26], and especially the
alphaherpesviruses [27-40]. In fact, Carter et al have
predicted that genes in AS orientation to known herpesvirus genes could be common [29]. S-AS pairs may be
functionally relevant with respect to regulation between
them [21], so the dynamics of the S-AS transcripts of
the UL87 gene area, along with their relationship to
each other, need to be characterized further.

Conclusion
In this study, an 800 nt unspliced UL87 AS transcript
was identified to express in HCMV late infection phase,
and two ORFs were predicted in the antisense
transcript.
Materials and methods
Virus and specimens

Three HCMV clinical strains, named X, CH, and H,
were isolated from urine samples from three infants less
than 5 months old who had been hospitalized in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. The strains
were passaged less than ten times in human embryonic
lung fibroblast (HELF) cells, which were maintained in
1640 medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum,
and 100 units penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and 5%
CO2 in a humidified incubator. HELF cells were inoculated with the three strains at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 3-5, respectively.
RNA preparations

For preparation of immediate-early (IE) RNA of HCMV,
the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX)
(Sigma, USA) (100 μl/ml) was added to the culture medium 1 hour before infection and the cells were harvested
at 24 hours post-infection (hpi). For early (E) RNA, the
DNA synthesis inhibitor phosphonoacetic acid (PAA)
(Sigma, USA) (100 μl/ml) was added to the medium
immediately after infection, and the cells were harvested
at 48 hpi. Late (L) RNA and mock-infected cellular
RNA were derived from infected and uninfected cells,
respectively, cultured in parallel, and harvested at 96
hpi. Total RNAs were isolated from approximately 107
infected or uninfected HELF cells using TRIzol agent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The isolated RNAs were
treated with DNA-Free reagent (Ambion, Austin, USA)
to remove possible contaminating DNA. The integrity

Ma et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:515

and size of the isolated RNAs were analyzed by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. The quantity and
purity of the RNAs were estimated by optical density
value detection.
Screening a HCMV cDNA library

A HCMV cDNA library had been constructed previously using the SMART technique (Clontech, USA)
using the L RNA of HCMV H strain isolated from the
urine sample of a HCMV-infected infant [14]. To select
specific cDNA clones from the cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a graded PCR was set up
as previously described [41,42].
Six thousand cDNA clones were screened by graded
PCR using several pairs of primers (Table 1 Figure 1).
The PCR conditions were initially denatured at 94 °C for
4 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 sec, 55 °C for 30 sec, and
72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final elongation of 72 °C
for 10 min. Inserts in the selected clones were sequenced
using vector primers (M13F and M13R). The screening
results allowed us to obtain clones containing transcript
sequences for both strands of the UL87 gene area.
RACE

Rapid amplification of cDNA 3’ ends (3’ RACE) and
5’ends (5’ RACE) experiments were performed with 3’Full RACE Core Set Ver.2.0 and 5’-Full Race Kit
(TaKaRa, Dalian, China), respectively. The L class RNA
preparations for the three strains and RNA of mock
infected cells were used as templates. First-strand cDNAs
were synthesized with MMLV reverse transcriptase using
oligo-dT-adaptor primers (3’ RACE) and random 9-mer
primers (5’ RACE). Nested PCR amplifications were carried out using LA Taq (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) after
reverse transcription. All of the primers are listed in
Table 1 and Figure 1. The reactions were carried out at
94°C for 4 min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30
sec, and 72°C for 3 min, with a final extension at 72°C for
10 min. In 5’ RACE experiments, two control reactions
were performed in strict accordance with kit instructions:
i) TAP (-), omitting tobacco acid pyrophosphorylase, ii)
MMLV (-), omitting MMLV reverse transcriptase.
Cloning and Sequencing

Products of RACE were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Different-sized products were purified using
the DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA). Recovered PCR products were ligated into a pCR
2.1 TA vector (Invitrogen, China) with T4 ligase at 14°
C, overnight. The ligation products were transformed
into E. coli DH/5a competent cells. Ten clones of each
purified PCR product were selected randomly for
sequencing using the M13 primers and the ABI PRISM
3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).

Northern blot

For northern blot analysis, 2 μg per lane of IE, E, and L
total RNA of the HCMV H strain and RNA from mockinfected HELF cells were subjected to denaturing agarose
gel (1% [wt/vol]) electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde, alongside the digoxigenin-labeled RNA molecular
weight marker I (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The
UL87 AS-specific riboprobes were labeled using a DIG
Northern starter kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The riboprobes correspond to nucleotides 129553 to 130049 of the
complementary strand of the AD169 sequence (Figure 1).
The separated RNA fragments were transferred onto positively charged nylon membranes using capillary transfer.
Then, the nylon membranes were baked at 80°C for 2 h
followed by prehybridization for 30 min at 63 °C using the
Dig EasyHyb-buffer (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). After
overnight hybridization at 63 °C, the membranes were
washed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
hybridized probes were incubated with anti-digoxigenin
conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and were then visualized with the chemiluminescence substrate CDP-Star
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The membranes were
exposed using ChemiDoc™ XRS+ (Bio RAD, USA).
BLAST search and sequence analysis

Standard nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST was performed
on the NCBI website. The nucleotide positions referred
to in this study are in reference to the sequence of the
HCMV AD169 strain (GenBank: X17403.1). The following sequences were used for alignment analysis: HCMV
AD169 strain (GenBank: X17403.1), Merlin strain (GenBank: GU179001.1), Towne strain (GenBank:
FJ616285.1), the three clinical strains (H, CH, and X) in
this study, Chimpanzee cytomegalovirus (CCMV, GenBank: AF480884), and Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV,
GenBank: AM886412). DNA alignment was done by
MegAlign using Clustal W algorithms. ORFs of identified transcripts were predicted by Editseq of the DNAstar package. The motifs in the predicted proteins were
predicted using GeneDoc program.
