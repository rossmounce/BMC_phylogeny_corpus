Background
Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs)
represent the most abundant genomic component in all
plant genomes thus far investigated. They are transposable elements that replicate through a “copy/paste”
mechanism that relies on reverse transcription and integration of a RNA intermediate. Plant LTR-RTs can be
divided in two major superfamilies: Copia and Gypsy[1].
LTR-RTs have impact on genome size variation, as well
as in the expression of adjacent genes in their host genomes, providing a “genomic plasticity” [2]. Their transcription was believed to be extremely repressed in
plants. However, despite their potential mutagenic and
deleterious effects, LTR-RTs were proven to be transcriptionally active in several plant species [3].
Eucalyptus is one of the most commercially important
forest genus in the world, due to their superior growth,
broad adaptability and multipurpose wood properties.
Most molecular studies in Eucalyptus are focused on
cellulose production and wood development, and there
are few works on genome composition, structure and
evolution. Pinus and Populus, the tree genera with most
available genomic resources, have several works analyzing their repertoire of LTR-RTs [i. e 4, 5], but only one
study characterized LTR-RTs in Eucalyptus[6], with no
detailed manual checking or phylogenetic analysis. Here,
we used FOREST database as a starting point to identify
transcriptionally active Copia LTR-RTs in Eucalyptus,
that were further analyzed regarding their in silico
expression, evolutionary diversity, and distribution in
public genomic databases.

Methods
A previous survey with 88 CopiaLTR-RTs from diverse
plants defined six major common evolutionary Copialineages [7]. The 22 Arabidopsis thaliana families analyzed in that study were used as queries to the identify
EucalyptusEST sequences related to Copiaelements in
FORESTS database [8], by tBLASTx (e-value >1e-50).
Sequences were then analyzed in RepBase [9] to confirm
their similarity to Copia LTR-RTs. EucalyptusESTs with
>200bp of copia-like retrotransposon fragments were
used to identify complete copies in Eucalyptusgrandis
genome v 1.0 in a BLASTn search (identity >80%; in a
region >250bp). We picked up 10000bp surrounding the
aligned region, that were analyzed using LTR-Finder
[10] and LTR_STRUC [11]. Full-length LTR-RTs were
then used as queries in GenBank to retrieve related
EucalyptusEST sequences (>200bp; >80% identity). Phylogenetic analyses using the reverse transcriptase of
these elements (alignment in MUSCLE, Maximimum
Likelihood method, bootstrap 1000 replicates) were
done using MEGA 5.01 [12].
Results
Stem, calli and seedlings were the cDNA libraries from
FOREST database with most EST sequences, in this
Copia LTR-RT search. We identified 20 consensus
sequences (total: 36 ESTs) from 3 tissues, roots, leaves
and flower-buds. We also identified 29 ESTs in GenBank from xylem, root apex and cold-stressed plants
(Table 1). Using EST data, we identified six full-length
retrotransposons families that had different copy number in the Eucalyptus genome, estimated by BLAST
searches (cutoff 1e-50). Copy number ranged from 24 to
262 (Table 1). Phylogenetic analyses showed that they
are members of the Ale, Angela, GMR and Ivana evolutionary lineages (figure 1). Ale was the evolutionary

Conclusion
In summary, the present data demonstrate the potential
impact of future studies about functional and genomic
analysis of LTR-RTs in Eucalyptus. This is the first
characterization of full-length Copia LTR-RTs families
in Eucalyptus genome with potential transcriptional
activity, giving insights about phylogenetic diversity and
copy number variation of retrotransposons in this tree.
