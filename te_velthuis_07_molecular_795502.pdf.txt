Abstract
Background: Development, differentiation and physiology of metazoans all depend on cell to cell
communication and subsequent intracellular signal transduction. Often, these processes are
orchestrated via sites of specialized cell-cell contact and involve receptors, adhesion molecules and
scaffolding proteins. Several of these scaffolding proteins important for synaptic and cellular
junctions belong to the large family of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK). In order
to elucidate the origin and the evolutionary history of the MAGUKs we investigated full-length
cDNA, EST and genomic sequences of species in major phyla.
Results: Our results indicate that at least four of the seven MAGUK subfamilies were present in
early metazoan lineages, such as Porifera. We employed domain sequence and structure based
methods to infer a model for the evolutionary history of the MAGUKs. Notably, the phylogenetic
trees for the guanylate kinase (GK)-, the PDZ- and the SH3-domains all suggested a matching
evolutionary model which was further supported by molecular modeling of the 3D structures of
different GK domains. We found no MAGUK in plants, fungi or other unicellular organisms, which
suggests that the MAGUK core structure originated early in metazoan history.
Conclusion: In summary, we have characterized here the molecular and structural evolution of
the large MAGUK family. Using the MAGUKs as an example, our results show that it is possible to
derive a highly supported evolutionary model for important multidomain families by analyzing
encoded protein domains. It further suggests that larger superfamilies encoded in the different
genomes can be analyzed in a similar manner.

Background
The membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK)
family in mammals consists of 22 members, which vary in
size and domain organization (Fig. 1A, Table 1). Despite
these variances, the MAGUKs share a well conserved core
structure, which is comprised of one or multiple PDZ
domains, a Src homology 3 (SH3) and a guanylate kinase
(GK) domain. The SH3 and GK domains surpass their

canonical counterparts by interacting with each other to
form a super domain. This characteristic is also remnant
of voltage-gated calcium channel beta subunits that lack
PDZ domains. The large MAGUK family, as already
implied by their assortment of different gene architectures, encodes for a heterologous group of proteins with
very diverse biological functions (for review see [1]).

Molecular studies essentially have established a wide variety of cellular functions for different MAGUKs. Examples
include regulation of cellular processes including such as:
establishment of cell polarity, tight junction formation,
cell proliferation or apoptosis, cell differentiation and
neuronal synapse transmission [2-5]. Mutations or
changes in expression have often been found to cause
defects in cell-cell adhesion, cell polarity, cell proliferation and subsequently development [6-9].
The domain architecture of the MAGUKs enables interaction with receptors, the actin-cytoskeleton and ion channels, but also allows for tethering of different MAGUK
subfamily proteins together [10-12]. MAGUK proteins
may contain up to six PDZ domains, two L27 and two
WW domains (Fig. 1A). In addition to these domains, all
MAGUKS, expect for the MAGI subfamily, contain a SH3
domain. The GK domain of the MAGUKs shares homology with Guk1of yeast but appears to have lost GMP binding capacity and catalytic activity [13]. Additionally, the
SH3- and GK domain form an intermolecular interaction
which renders the GK domain catalytic inactive and can
function as a separate binding interface [14,15]. The
understanding of the biochemical role and regulation of
this super domain is limited, but it is intriguing that a similar SH3-HOOK-GK motif is present in voltage-gated calcium channels beta subunits [11,16].
Figure architectures of the MAGUK
distribution
Domain 1 over the eukaryotic phyla subfamilies and their
Domain architectures of the MAGUK subfamilies
and their distribution over the eukaryotic phyla. (A)
Eight subfamilies have been identified as members of the
MAGUK family in our study. Depicted here in a general schematic representation are the domains present in these members. All members contain a central core comprised of a GK
domain and several N and/or C-terminally positioned PDZ
domains. All members except the MAGI proteins contain a
SH3 domain that is nested between a PDZ and the GK
domain. The CASK and MPP proteins contain N-terminal
L27 domains, while CARMA genes encode CARD domains at
this position. Names used are allowing a more systematic,
but do not reflect in all cases the commonly used names e.g.
DLG4 is better known as PSD95. A list of synonyms is given
in table 1. The CACNB subfamily, commonly not regarded as
a canonical MAGUK subfamily, only contains the SH3 and
GK domains. Phylogenetic analysis presented here however
shows that it is a related subfamily. (B) The MAGUK subfamily distribution over the eukaryotic phyla shows no
homologs were found for Choanozoans/Protozoans, Plantae
and Fungi, here represented by Monosiga ovata, Arabidopsis
thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisae, respectively. Tetraodon
nigroviridis has duplicated DLG4, ZO1 and ZO2 encoding
genes, whereas Gallus gallus lacked the gene for DLG4. The
arrowheads on the bottom indicate two possible gene duplication events.

Structural and molecular studies have shown that PDZ
domains are pivotal features of scaffolding proteins and
localize MAGUKs and their interaction partners to specialized membrane domains of neuronal and epithelial cells
[1,2,17]. PDZ domains have a compact and modular
structure, and allow MAGUK proteins to bind to C-terminal recognition sequences. Although originally identified
in metazoans, the domain has been found to be spread
through bacterial, fungi and plant lineages as well [1,18].
To date, phylogenetic analyses have been carried out only
for individual members, such as ZO1 and the MAGIs
[19,20]. Through our extensive phylogenetic analysis of
the entire MAGUK family presented here, we were able to
divide the MAGUKs into 7 subfamilies and to infer a
probable evolutionary sequence of events that gave rise to
the MAGUK domain architectures. We used a domain-bydomain analysis in order to determine that the PDZ-SH3GK structure evolved only once in the course of evolution.
In addition, we confirm our phylogenetic data by molecular modeling and provide evidence for the hypothesis
that the MAGUK GK domain originated from a catalytically active GK domain and gradually lost its enzymatic
characteristics when new subfamilies emerged.

Results
Taxonomic distribution and phyla-specific architectures
Many important biological roles have been described for
members of the MAGUK family (reviewed in [1]). However, only very limited information is available about
their evolutionary history. To analyze the phylogeny and
molecular evolution of the MAGUKs, we initially gathered
protein sequences for species of all major metazoan
phyla, ranging from Porifera to Chordata, by using
human, fruit fly, sponge and hydrozoan sequences as
seed. Some sequences were readily available in GenBank
and in helpful automated databases like Pfam (with many
redundant sequences present) and Superfamily [21].
Many sequences were assembled from ESTs and genomic
data. Sequences for all functional domains were identified
(described in Methods) and categorized (see Additional
file 1 for complete list).

No MAGUK homologs or MAGUK-like structures, represented by combinations of a GK domain with a SH3 and/
or PDZ domains were found in protozoans, fungi and in
plants. Our data shows that most canonical MAGUK family members are present throughout all animal phyla
investigated (Fig. 1B). Basal metazoans, represented here
by the sponges, Oscarella carmela and Suberites domuncula,
and the cnidarians, Hydra vulgaris and Hydra magnipapillata, encode for several different MAGUK subfamily members (Fig. 1B). This was previously recognized when a
MAGI homolog was characterized in S. domuncula [20]
and a ZO member was described for H. vulgaris [19]. Here,
we are able to add three new members to this list in basal
metazoans, which now includes homologs of MPP, DLG
and a DLG5 encoding genes (Fig. 1B and Additional file
1).

Guanylate kinase dendrogram and summarized phylogenetic analyses. (A) The dendrogram is based on all
protein families currently known to contain GK sequences
(note: this is not a phylogeny). These include the three families of the voltage-gated calcium channel beta subunit (CAB),
the homologs of Guanylate kinase (GUK) and the MAGUK
family. The core structure of the GUK is GK only, while the
CAB and MAGUK families have a SH3-GK or PDZ-SH3-GK
architecture respectively. The MAGUK and CAB families
were only found in metazoan species, while sequences of
GUK family members appeared dispersed over all eukaryotic
lineages. In the GUK clade the metazoans are indicated with
the letter M, the Fungi with F, Bacteria with B, Viruses with V
and the Plants with P. Species that were included in this dendrogram as well as sequences used are listed in Additional file
2. (B-C) Summarized phylogenetic trees based on Bayesian
consensus trees (see Additional file 3, 4, 5) for the GK, SH3
and PDZ domains, respectively. Numbers indicate % Bayesian posterior probability and % bootstrap Maximum Likelihood.

The protein architectures, with respect to the domain
combinations, appear largely consistent and conserved
throughout all metazoan phyla investigated. However,
some lineage-specific differences can be found for example the C. elegans dlg5 gene, lacks the sequences for the
GK-, the SH3- and the fourth PDZ-domain. The M. musculus and H. sapiens Dlg5 genes show variations as well, since
they encode additional DUF622 or CARD domains
(Q3UGX5, NP_004738). These domains are not present
in all other species investigated.
We observed several species specific gene duplications
within the MAGUK family for example several additional
ZO homologs are present in the T. nigroviridis genome,
compared to other vertebrates. A Tetraodon Zo1 gene can
be found on both chromosome 5 and 13 and duplicated
sequences for ZO-2 are positioned on the same two chromosomes (see Additional file 1). Gene duplications in teleosts have been described for the hox clusters [22,23].

Phylogenetic analysis of guanylate kinase domains
To elucidate the evolution of the MAGUK family genes
and their gene architectures, we performed an analysis of
the centrally positioned approximately 250 amino acid
long GK domain. It has been suggested that the MAGUK
GK domain evolved from other, enzymatically active, GK
domains. The latter include domains like those present in
the homologs of the S. cerevisae guk1 gene, which shares
approximately 40% homology at the protein level [1].
Enzymatic GK domains can be found in most eukaryotic
phyla, including plants, fungi, Protozoa and Metazoa, and
are encoded by guanlylate kinase homologs (syn. Guk or
GMP). The domains are also present in bacteria and certain viruses [e.g. [24]]. Our assembly (Fig. 2A) illustrates
that the MAGUK protein subfamilies form a specific clustering pattern. Of particular interest is the clustering of the
CASK subfamily with the MPP subfamily and very close to
MPP1. Indeed, the MPP and CASK subfamilies are the
only proteins in the MAGUK family that share an architecture containing two L27 domains (see Fig. 1A) [25]. The
Guk and CACNB sequences clustered in separate clades.

On the basis of the aligned GK sequences that we used to
construct the dendrogram we generated a phylogenetic
tree (Fig. 2B; Additional file 3). Guk family sequences (not
belonging to the MAGUKs) were used to root the tree.
Judging from the GK phylogenetic relationships, the GK
tree suggests that the MPP subfamily split of first from an

active GK precursor closely followed by the MAGI and the
CACNB subfamilies.
The phylogenetic analysis of the SH3 domains (Fig. 2C;
Additional file 4), which may be 60–70 amino acids in
length, showed the same basic evolutionary relationships
as the GK domain-based phylogeny, which suggest that
the two domains co-evolved along the same path. It must
be noted that the MAGI subfamily is not present in the
SH3 phylogeny since its members do not contain a SH3
domain.
Comparison of GK 3D structures
To substantiate our above described phylogeny, we created models of the GK and the super domain SH3-HOOKGK, which is present in each MAGUK subfamily member,
except the MAGIs. Canonical GK domains catalyze the
reversible phosphoryl transfer from ATP to GMP [e.g.
[25]]. Like other NMP kinases, GK proteins contain three
essential, dynamic regions: the CORE domain, the LID
domain and NMP-binding pocket (Fig. 3) [26]. Unique
for the GK is that its GMP-binding domain is comprised
of four β-sheets and a short helix, whereas others are
purely α-helical [27].

Consistent with our phylogenetic analysis, it is apparent
that the MPPs show the most extensive structural similarity with the active GK. The other subfamilies show less

Molecular modeling of guanylate kinase domains based on the human sequences
Molecular modeling of guanylate kinase domains based on the human sequences. Indicated in the left, uppermost
panel are the three dynamic domains of the GMP guanylate Kinase: the GMP binding sub-domain, the CORE sub-domain and
the LID sub-domain. The other panels show modeled structures of the MAGUK subfamilies, superimposed by Swiss Model.
Arrows indicate the likely course of the structural evolution. The relationships established through our phylogenetic analysis
are reflected here in the comparison of structures for the human representatives. The MPP structure still has a resemblance
close to the human GMP guanylate Kinase, having a similar orientation of the three sub-domains of the GMP GK. The DLG and
ZO subfamilies are also very closely related, when the presented 3D structures are compared. The MAGI GK could only be
partially superimposed on known structures, sharing at least the GK GMP binding domain with the other MAGUK subfamilies.
The used PDB files are listed in Additional file 2. The lowest four panels show representative models of the GK-HOOK-SH3
super domains of the MAGUK subfamilies MPP, DLG, ZO and CACNB. As in the upper panels the GK domain is colored yellow and magenta (β-strands and helices respectively), while the SH3 and HOOK regions are colored green and blue.

structural resemblance, but it is clear that the DLG and ZO
subfamilies are more related to one another, than to the
other subfamilies. This was also apparent from our phylogeny.
Indicated in the lowest two panels of figure 3, the SH3HOOK-GK structures of representatives of the MPP and
CACNB subfamilies are shown. Members of the DLG and
ZO subfamilies adopted a structure largely similar to the
MPP model, which places the CACNB subfamily by itself.
This may be explained by the different biological role that
CACNB is involved in, which requires a different structural organization compared to the scaffolding role of the
canonical MAGUKs. The CARMA subfamily GK or SH3HOOK-GK sequences could not be superimposed on any
annotated structure in de database used. The PDB files
and sequences used for the superimpositions, as well as
their expect values, are listed in Additional file 2.
Insertion of the WW domains in the MAGI subfamily
The MAGI proteins are different from the other MAGUK
members as they lack a SH3 domain between the core GK
and PDZ domains. They contain, however, two WW
domains (Fig. 1A), which have been suggested to function
in a similar fashion as the MAGUK SH3 domain, i.e. facilitating oligomerization [1,28]. From sequence alignments
and annotation of the protein-protein interaction
domains on these alignments we observed overlapping
regions of the GK domain range and WW domains in the
sequences of invertebrate species (in SMART, not shown).
These overlaps were not present in the mammalian
sequences, most likely because a larger, not well conserved, amino acid stretch was present between the two
domains. Our alignment of the MAGI sequences revealed
that there is a partial conservation of the proper GK
domain (approx. 80 residues, compared to the normal
250) and indeed this area could also be reliably modeled
(Fig. 3). These observations suggest that early in metazoan
evolution, the two WW domains inserted into the C-terminal part of the MAGI GK domain, which thereafter
resulted in a loss of this part of the domain.
Diversification of the MAGUK architecture
We assumed that a thorough analysis of the PDZ domain
(approx. 70–100 amino acids) would provide more
insight into the architectural evolution of the MAGUK
family. All C-terminally positioned PDZs of the DLG1-3
subfamily, the ZO1-3 subfamily and DLG5 are intimately
related (Fig. 2D; Additional file 5). Within the DLG1-3
subfamily the three PDZ domains in these proteins are
also clustered together very closely, which suggests rapid
domain duplications. In the DLG5 subfamily, the fourth
PDZ domain seems to have arisen from a domain duplication of the third DLG5 PDZ domain.

Figure
lution 4
Evolutionary model of the MAGUK subfamily-structure evoEvolutionary model of the MAGUK subfamily-structure evolution. Evolving from a catalytically active GK
encoding gene, the family arose by obtaining both a PDZ and
SH3 domain. Then the MPP subfamily branched off, assimilating L27 domains and, in the case of CASK, also a kinase
domain. The MPP subfamily member known as MPP1 evolved
last and lost its L27 domains. The CACNB and MAGI subfamilies arose through domain loss of the PDZ and SH3
domains, respectively. The later one also obtained WW
domains, most likely resulting in a C-terminal truncation of
the GK domain. The MAGUK core structure, consisting of a
PDZ, SH3 and GK domain evolved further and gave rise,
after duplication of the most C-terminal PDZ domain, to the
DLG, ZO and, lastly, the CARMA subfamily. This PDZ
domain duplicated another time at the birth of the DLG5
structure. The arrowheads on the bottom indicate two different gene duplication events. Arrows on top of the protein
structures show PDZ domain duplication events derived
from our phylogeny.

The first MAGI PDZ is closely related to the PDZs of the
ZO, DLG subfamilies, which was expected from the GK
phylogenetic tree. Interestingly however, all other MAGI
PDZs (PDZs 2–6) are more related to one another and the
MPP/CASK then to the most N-terminally positioned
PDZ. These results suggest that the MAGI core structure is
not due to an inversion of the GK domain as commonly
assumed and reflected in the name (MAGI: membraneassociated guanylate kinase with an inverted arrangement
of protein-protein interaction domains [28]).

Discussion
The goal of the present study was to gain insight into the
general and structural evolution of the MAGUK family.

We further wanted to prove that it is possible to derive a
supported evolutionary model by analyzing the phylogeny of individual domains found in multidomain protein
families, like the MAGUKs. In order to map the general
evolutionary history of this gene family we assembled a
large dataset of sequences for all major metazoan phyla,
and phylogenetically and structurally analyzed the core
domains present.
Choanoflagellates may be closely related to metazoans
and based on phylogenetic analyses and the observation
that these protists have a collar of feeding tentacles reminiscent of sponge feeding cells, both had been suggested
to form a monophyletic group called the Opisthokonta,
[e.g. [24,30-32]]. Other protozoan species like Giardia
intestinalis (syn. G. lamblia) were also suggested to be close
to basal metazoans [33-35]. We attempted to identify
MAGUK proteins and closely related structural homologs,
which are vital for metazoan processes such as cell to cell
communication, in these species as well, however, none
could be found in protozoans. In addition, MAGUK
sequences were not found in the genomes of bacteria,
fungi and plant species. This suggests that the formation
of the MAGUK structure, with its characteristic and centrally-positioned, non-functioning GK domain is essentially of metazoan origin and we speculate that the
MAGUKs initially played important roles in cell to cell
communication. The absence in Plantae can be explained
by the late evolution of the MAGUKs, but it is tempting to
speculate that cell to cell communication in plants is fundamentally different due to additional cell walls and thus
might require different (scaffolding) modules than the
MAGUKs.
Our search for MAGUK homologs has however, let to the
identification of three new members in the most basal
metazoans, which now includes homologs of MPP, DLG
and a DLG5 encoding genes (Fig. 1B and Additional file
1). These findings imply that all canonical MAGUK family
members arose very early during metazoan evolution. The
CARMA genes are a likely exception and no homologs
were identified in species more basal than the Deuterostomia. It is important to note that while this is a reasonable
assumption at this time, not all genome projects have yet
been completed. Thus, after completion they should be
revisited.
We initiated our phylogenetic analysis with the GK and
SH3 domain, and compared their evolutionary histories
as they are both present in most MAGUK subfamilies.
Indeed, the GK and SH3 domain show a similar phylogeny (Fig 2B and 2C; Additional file 3 and 4). Furthermore,
these findings are supported by molecular modeling of
the 3 dimensional structures of the GK domain and not
contradicted by the phylogenetic analysis of the PDZ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/129

domains (Fig 2D; Additional file 5). This is an important
finding, showing that the analysis of the independent
domains of different sizes renders a similar evolutionary
scenario.
In regard to the MAGUK family, we found that the Ca2+
channel beta-subunit family seems to have evolved
together with the MAGUK family. The CACNBs are commonly not considered to belong to the MAGUKs, but our
phylogenetic results show that they are related, share a
common ancestor and may thus represent a MAGUK subfamily.
Our analysis of the PDZ domains showed a bifurcated
evolution (Additional file 5), with the MAGI PDZs linked
to both groups (first PDZ to DLG, ZO and CARMA; the
second to sixth PDZ to the MPPs). Additionally, we
describe here that the WW domains likely inserted into
the MAGI GK domain and then moved toward the C-terminus, leaving the GK domain deprived of its essential
CORE and LID domain. At present, we do not have a good
explanation for these events, but our findings are evidence
against a complete inversion of the MAGI structure as was
suggested earlier [28].
Based on our domain-by-domain analysis we propose a
model to describe the structural evolution of the MAGUK
family, including the CACNB family (Fig. 4). Evolving
from an enzymatically active GK encoding gene, the family arose by obtaining both a PDZ and SH3 domain. Then
the MPP subfamily split off, taking up L27 domains. The
CACNB and MAGI subfamilies arose through domain loss
of the PDZ and SH3 domains, respectively. The MAGUK
core structure, consisting of a PDZ, SH3 and GK domain
evolved further and gave rise, after duplication of the Nterminal PDZ domain, to the DLG, ZO and, lastly, the
CARMA subfamily. Duplications of PDZ domains happened twice during evolution of the MAGUKs and are
illustrated in our model (Fig. 4, arrows on top of protein
structures).
In summary, we have derived here a highly supported evolutionary model for the MAGUK family by analyzing the
phylogeny of individual domains. The results of our analysis provide strong evidence that other complex multidomain families and also larger superfamilies can be
investigated in a similar way. Additionally, we provide
evidence that places the Calcium-channel beta-subunit
proteins within the MAGUK family from an evolutionary
perspective.

Conclusion
To elucidate the origin and the evolutionary history of the
MAGUK family, we investigated full-length cDNA, EST
and genomic sequences of species in major phyla. These

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:129

data indicated that MAGUKs are present only in metazoan
species and not encoded in protozoans, bacteria or plants.
Phylogenetic analysis of our sequence data showed a
matching evolutionary history for the central protein
interaction domains of the MAGUKs. Supported further
by structural evidence, we postulate that the MAGUKs
evolved first as a GK-SH3 structure from an active GK
enzyme, which is present in protozoa and plants. Then
the PDZ domain was added to this structure, thereby completing the MAGUK core structure. New domains were
subsequently added or duplications of the PDZ were
made in order to give rise to the MAGUK assortment now
present in vertebrates. Additionally, we provide evidence
that places the Calcium-channel beta-subunit proteins
within the MAGUK family, based on the evolutionary perspective of our research. Our results show that it is possible to derive a supported evolutionary model for
important multidomain families by analyzing encoded
protein domains. We suggest here that larger superfamilies can be analyzed in a similar manner.

Methods
Creating a functional domain database
Initially, a dataset of the functional domains found in the
MAGUK family was established. For this purpose human
homologs were searched with the Blastp algorithm [36]
against the protein databases and with tBlastn against
genome and EST databases of Ensembl, National Centre
for Biotechnology Information and the Joint Genome
Institute. Blast hits with high enough E-values were further analyzed with the protein domain prediction program SMART [37,38] and reblasted with Blastp for
confirmation. Metazoan species searched for homologs
were: Branchiostoma floridae (Bf), Danio rerio (Dr),
Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce), Ciona intestinalis (Ci), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), Gallus gallus (Gg), Homo sapiens
(Hs), Hydra magnipapillata (Hm), Hydra vulgaris (Hv), Mus
musculus (Mm), Leucoraja erinacea (Le), Lymnaea stagnalis

Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Alignments were performed using ClustalX [39] with
default parameter values, and manually refined in GeneDoc. The alignments were used for phylogenetic analysis
employing both Bayesian analysis and Maximum Likelihood (ML). Bayesian trees were generated with MrBayes
[40]. Rate variation across sites was modeled with a four
rate gamma distribution and invariant sites, while the
MCMC search itself was continued for 1,000,000 generations, sampled every 100 generations, and 2500 trees were
discarded as burnin. The amino acid substitution model
was set to mixed in order to reduce assumptions prior to
analysis. For ML, alignments were bootstrapped 1000

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/129

times with the program Seqboot from the Phylip package
[41]. Subsequently, phylogenetic trees were generated
with the ML algorithm implemented in PhyML [42], with
the amino acid substitution set at Jones-Taylor-Thornton.
Other PhyML parameters were gamma distribution with
four classes for across-site rate variation and optimization
of the alpha parameter that was used for the gamma distribution. Consensus trees were calculated with Consense
[41]. At last, phylogenetic trees were visualized with
MEGA 3.1 [43]. In the tree figures shown, the topology
support values are labeled on the Bayesian consensus tree
in the order % Bayesian posterior probability/% bootstrap
Maximum Likelihood to reduce and standardize the characters and figures used.
Molecular modeling and tree construction on structural
information
To create 3D models of the GK and the GK-HOOK-SH3
super domain of the different MAGUK subfamilies we
used sequences of human origin. The BLAST E-value limit
was set at 1.0e-6 while template identification searches
were performed, selecting for the best template through
the SWISS-MODEL workspace [44,45]. For model building, refinement and visualization of the superimpositions
Swiss-PdbViewer version 3.7 was used [44]. Used templates and their expect values are given in Additional file
