Abstract
Background: Recent studies have revealed an unexpected diversity of domain architecture among
FcR-like receptors that presumably fulfill regulatory functions in the immune system. Different
species of mammals, as well as chicken and catfish have been found to possess strikingly different
sets of these receptors. To better understand the evolutionary history of paired receptors, we
extended the study of FcR-like genes in amphibian representatives Xenopus tropicalis and Xenopus
laevis.
Results: The diploid genome of X. tropicalis contains at least 75 genes encoding paired FcR-related
receptors designated XFLs. The allotetraploid X. laevis displays many similar genes primarily
expressed in lymphoid tissues. Up to 35 domain architectures generated by combinatorial joining
of six Ig-domain subtypes and two subtypes of the transmembrane regions were found in XFLs.
None of these variants are shared by FcR-related proteins from other studied species. Putative
activating XFLs associate with the FcRγ subunit, and their transmembrane domains are highly
similar to those of activating mammalian KIR-related receptors. This argues in favor of a common
origin for the FcR and the KIR families. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the entire repertoires of
the Xenopus and mammalian FcR-related proteins have emerged after the amphibian-amniotes split.
Conclusion: FcR- and KIR-related receptors evolved through continual species-specific
diversification, most likely by extensive domain shuffling and birth-and-death processes. This mode
of evolution raises the possibility that the ancestral function of these paired receptors was a direct
interaction with pathogens and that many physiological functions found in the mammalian receptors
were secondary acquisitions or specializations.

Background
Immune responses are regulated by a balance of opposing
signals delivered from leukocyte surface molecules [1,2].

In the mammalian immune system, several families of
activating and inhibitory receptors form an elaborated
regulatory network that tightly affects all stages of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:148

immune responses. The evolutionary history of this network is poorly understood. While "pairing" of receptors
into the inhibitory and activating forms appears to have
occurred in invertebrates, there is no clear evolutionary
continuity between invertebrate and vertebrate receptor
systems [3,4]. Furthermore, ambiguity of relationships is
often observed for paired receptors from different lineages
of vertebrates [5-8].
Classical Fc receptors (FcR) and killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) constitute two families that are prototypic for the paradigm of immune regulation through
integration of activating and inhibitory signals. Members
of each family fall into two main signaling classes. The
inhibitory receptors contain ITIMs in their cytoplasmic
tails, while the activating receptors associate with the
ITAM-bearing transmembrane signal subunits, such as
FcRγ (FcRs) or DAP12 (KIRs). FcRs are widely expressed
on various leukocyte subsets. They regulate phagocytosis,
cytokines release, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity, and antibody synthesis [9,10]. KIRs play a crucial
role in regulation of human NK cell cytotoxicity via recognition of MHC class I antigens on the surface of target cells
[11-13].
During the last decade, it has been recognized that FcRs
and KIRs belong to large families comprised of structurally related yet highly diverse proteins. Thus far, eight
human and six mouse FcR-like (FCRL) genes have been
described [14-23]. Two of them, designated FCRLA and
FCRLB according to the new nomenclature [24], are intracellular proteins composed of three Ig-like domains and a
C-terminal mucin-like domain. Six human (FCRL1FCRL6) and three mouse (FCRL1, FCRL5, and FCRL6)
genes code for cell surface receptors with the extracellular
regions (EC) composed of two to nine Ig-like domains
and intracellular regions bearing different patterns of the
ITIM-, ITSM- and ITAM-like motifs. Apart from the FcRcharacteristic D1, D2 and D3 subtypes, two new structural
Ig-like domain subtypes, D4 and D5, have been identified
in these proteins. Furthermore, one of the novel mouse
genes, FCRLS, encodes a soluble mosaic protein containing a scavenger domain [17,22].
Studies of the KIR family have also revealed its considerable structural and functional heterogeneity. Human KIRlike proteins (KIRL) include cell surface receptors of the
LILR (ILT/LIR/MIR) family as well as FcαR, GPVI, Nkp46,
OSCAR, Lair1 and Lair2 [25,26]. The LILR family consists
of both inhibitory and activating forms: LAIR-1 is an
inhibitory receptor, LAIR2 is soluble, the others are activating. Like FcRs but unlike KIRs, the activating LILR
receptors, as well as FcαR, OSCAR, NKP46, and GPVI
associate with the FcRγ subunit [27-31]. However, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/148

transmembrane regions (TM) of activating KIRLs are
structurally different from those of FcRs.
Intriguingly, the repertoires of the FcR- and KIR-related
proteins are different from one species to another in
higher vertebrates. For instance, each of the six human
and four mouse extracellular FCRLs has a unique domain
architecture [22,24]. Functional equivalents of KIRs in
rodents are C-type lectin receptors of the Ly49 family [32].
The mouse also lacks counterparts of FcαR and Lair-2 and
has fewer LILR homologues described as PIRs [25,26].
Profound differences in the KIR and FcR families have
been also revealed between mammals and birds. Recent
data show that the chicken genome has more than a hundred genes for KIR-like paired receptors known as CHIRs
[33-35]. At the same time, a single FcR-related gene has
been detected in this species [36,37].
Comparison of the 3-D structure of membrane-proximal
domains of FcγRII and KIR2D demonstrated their similar
folding and prompted a suggestion that the two families
may have had a common origin [33]. This suggestion was
made before identification of FCRLs. A later phylogenetic
analysis did not provide solid support in favor of homology of five FCRL-characteristic Ig-domain subtypes with
the two main domain subtypes of KIR-related receptors
[5]. Nevertheless, this idea of the common ancestry of the
FcR and KIR families has been revived in modified form
after the recent identification of a family of paired receptors called leukocyte immune-type receptors (LITR) in catfish [6]. LITRs are composed of several domain subtypes
some of which resemble the FcR-characteristic domains
D1D2, whereas others are more similar to KIRL domains.
Such composition of Ig domains has been proposed as
ancestral for the tetrapod paired receptors [6]. However,
weak sequence similarity between LITR and KIRL Ig
domains, as well as the absence of the D3, D4 and D5 type
domains in LITRs did not allow conclusions about definite relationships of the teleostean proteins with the
higher vertebrate FcR and KIR families.
The fact that all known FcR- and KIR-related receptors are
primarily expressed in cells of the immune system is consistent with their contribution to the immune regulation.
However, the exact functions of all FCRLs and many KIRLs
are still unknown. The ambiguity of the structural and
functional evolution of FcR- and KIR-related receptors
complicates our understanding of how this regulatory network is organized, which factors drives its species-specific
changes and ultimately how it may be manipulated for
therapeutic purposes.
To gain deeper insight into the evolution of the immunoregulation through paired receptors, we studied the FcR
family in the amphibians Xenopus laevis and Xenopus trop-

icalis. The data obtained provide evidence in favor of a
common origin of the FcR and KIR families and their
ceaseless diversification that appears to be caused by very
strong natural selection pressure.

Results
The FcR family is expanded in amphibians
During our studies of the human and mouse FcR-like
genes we observed that EST databases contain numerous
X. tropicalis and X. laevis cDNAs encoding proteins structurally similar to mammalian FcRs and FCRLs. The degree
of amino acid sequence identity ranged from 25 to 43%
for different domain subtypes. We designated these genes
XFL (Xenopus FcR-Like). The recent sequencing of the X.
tropicalis genome provided an opportunity to examine the
organization and structure of the XFL genes in more
details. We used in silico analysis of the version 2, 3 and 4
genomic sequences deposited at the JGI website. We did
not consider the consortium gene models in this survey.
Direct application of gene prediction programs to
genomic sequences often results in erroneous models. To
overcome this pitfall, we first identified exons coding for
the XFL EC and TM domains using the TBLASTN search
with amino acid sequences of the corresponding X. tropicalis and X. laevis EST cDNAs or mammalian FcR-like proteins. The identified X. tropicalis sequences were used in
the second round of the computational screening to reveal
exons that might have been overlooked in the first round.
The procedure was repeated until no novel exons were
identified. The exons lacking frame-shift mutations or
stop codons were examined for the presence of the AG
and GT splice signals matching the phase 1 rule. Thereafter, the gene models were generated using both automatic
and manual procedures. The exons for the TM regions
served as the gene delimiters. This approach resulted in
finding several hundred exons on 33 scaffolds. Of these,
19 scaffolds contained 1–2 exons that may either represent misassembled gene regions, gene fragments or pseudogenes. The exons on 14 other scaffolds could be
arranged in at least 75 XFL genes. Fig. 1 shows the predicted organization and exon/intron arrangement of these
genes. The exons encoding the signal peptides and cytoplasmic regions are not shown in this scheme because of
poor accuracy of their prediction. Nevertheless, in certain
cases, such exons could be delineated on the basis of
alignment of the genomic sequences with the EST cDNAs.
At the time, the EST databases contained X. tropicalis
cDNAs corresponding to 13 XFL genes. The signal peptides were invariably encoded by two exons, like in the
mammalian FcR-like genes. In a fraction of XFL genes, the
exons for signal peptides met the rule 30/21 bp (the
length of the first/the length of the second exon), which is
characteristic of mammalian FCRL1-6, FcγRI and FCRLB
genes. The XFL cytoplasmic regions are encoded by one to
five exons.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/148

In the mammalian genomes, FcR-like genes are linked to
the genes of the CD2 family. Thus, the FCRL6 gene is a
part of a conserved syntenic group that includes the
SLAMF8 (BLAME), IgSF9, DUSP23, TAGLN2 and NGES1
genes [37]. We found a similar group in the scaffold 626
that contains 16 XFL genes (Fig. 1). The XFL gene 626_16
is located between two CD2-like genes, one of which
shows the greatest similarity to mammalian SLAMF8
(BLAME). Xenopus homologs of the mammalian IgSF9,
DUSP23, TAGLN2 and NGES1 genes are also tightly
linked. This conserved synteny taken together with the
results of the sequence comparisons (See additional data
file 1) and phylogenetic analysis (see below) strongly supports the assignment of the XFL genes as true amphibian
homologs of the mammalian FcR genes.
The XFL receptors are subdivided into two classes
With a few exceptions, the predicted XFL genes code for
type I cell surface receptors (Fig. 2). Their TM regions fall
into two structural types that we designated TM1 and
TM2. The characteristic feature of TM1 is the presence of a
conserved NxxR motif at the N-termini. TM2 lacks
charged residues. Interestingly, TM1 regions are highly
homologous to the TM regions of some KIRLs such as
LILRA2, PIR-A, NCR1/NKp46, GPVI, OSCAR, and FcαR
(Fig. 3). All these proteins are known to associate with the
FcRγ signal subunit [27-31]. It is important to stress that
TMs of classical activating FcRs are quite different, and
bear a typical conserved structural motif (M/L)Fxx(D/
N)TxL [38]. Despite the extensive search, we did not find
exons for TM regions with such a signature in the X. tropicalis genome, or in the available Xenopus EST cDNAs. Our
phylogenetic analysis supports a close relationship of the
TM regions of the XFL and KIRL proteins. As shown in Fig
3b, the NxxR motif-containing TMs and TMs of activating
classical FcRs form two distinct clusters. The TM region of
DAP12-associating KIR2DS, a member of the human KIR
family of MHC class I-specific NK cell receptors, is not
related to either of these groups.

Comparison of the X. tropicalis genomic and EST
sequences showed that the TM1-containing proteins lack
a cytoplasmic tail or have a very short one. In every such
case, the TM region and the tail are encoded by the same
exon. Genes with a TM2 have longer cytoplasmic tails.
These tails contain one to three tyrosine-based motifs
matching the consensus YxxL/I/V and are encoded by
exons separated from TM exons. All these structural features are compatible with the subdivision of the XFL
receptors into two functional classes, activating and inhibitory. The number of genes for each class is roughly similar and they are intermingled in the genome (Fig. 1).

Alignment (A) and phylogenetic analysis (B) of the deduced TM regions of the Xenopus and mammalian FcRand KIR-like proteins. All the displayed mammalian members of the KIR family associate with FcRγ subunit. The X. tropicalis
genes are designated according to the scaffold number and a gene position. Identical and similar residues are shown by white
letters on black and gray backgrounds, respectively. The Neighbor-Joining tree of the nucleotide sequences of the TM exons
was constructed using the MEGA3 software [39]. The bootstrap values are shown.

The EC regions of XFLs are highly diverse
A remarkable feature of the predicted XFL proteins is an
extraordinary diversity of their domain architectures.
Overall 24 different combinations of six structural subtypes of the Ig-like domains in the EC regions of XFLs were
found. Five subtypes were assigned to D1-D5 subtypes
previously identified in the mammalian members of the
FcR family. A sixth subtype appears to be Xenopus-specific
as no close relatives were found in the protein databases.
The D3 subtype domain is most frequent and may be
repeated up to 7 times in a protein. Although we cannot
rule out that some of the gene predictions result from
genome assembly artifacts, we found high similarity
between the expressed and genomic sequences. The ESTgenome comparisons showed the absence of two exons in
the genomic sequences. In both cases, close inspection
demonstrated the presence of gaps in the corresponding
genomic regions. Eleven of 13 cDNAs fully matched our
gene models. This fact, together with the absence of gaps
in many predicted genes and reiteration of certain domain
architectures two or more times suggest a high degree of
confidence in the proposed models. Among the predicted
proteins there are typical pairs with identical ectodomains
and distinct TM subtypes. (Fig. 1 and 2). The EC regions

of 11 XFLs are composed of D1, D2, and D3 domains, like
mammalian FcγRI. This is the only EC composition
shared by the known mammalian and Xenopus FcR-like
proteins. If we consider structural subtypes of the TM
regions as distinct domains, up to 36 domain architectures may be distinguished among the XFL proteins, none
of which are present among mammalian members of the
FcR family.
Lineage-specific expansion of Xenopus and mammalian
FcR families
While the attribution of the XFL proteins to the FcR family
is unequivocal according to the reciprocal sequence comparisons and protein database analysis, it remains unclear
how Xenopus and mammalian proteins are related to each
other. To assess such relationships, we generated a series
of phylogenetic trees with the MEGA3 software package
[39]. For this purpose, amino acid sequences of the Ig
domain subtypes from all the predicted XFLs were aligned
(see additional data file 1). Trees were generated using the
NJ and ME methods. To simplify the trees, the aligned
blocks of D1, D2 and D3 domains were reduced by
removing redundant sequences with close association.
Thereafter, the sequences for all the XFL domain subtypes

Page 6 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:148

were aligned together with the domain sequences of the
human proteins, and their relationships were analyzed by
the same procedure. The final tree is shown on Fig 4. The
tree topology supports subdivision of the Xenopus and
human Ig domains into five common (D1-D5) and one
Xenopus-specific (D6) subtypes. Most importantly, the tree
shows separate clustering of the Xenopus and human
sequences. This branching pattern suggests that duplications of the FcR-like genes in amphibian and mammalian
lineages were lineage-specific and that separation of the
mammalian genes into classical FcRs and FCRLs occurred
after the split of the amphibian and mammalian lineages.
The relationships among the XFL genes provide evidence
for a complex pattern of family evolution in amphibians.
Its detailed description is beyond the scope of the present
paper and will be published separately. What is relevant to
note here, is that the strong association of the amphibian
sequences with each other does not necessarily correspond to high level of sequence similarity among them.
The cumulative tree illustrates subdivision of the XFL D1,
D2 and D3 domains into structural variants whose relationships with each other cannot be resolved. The D1, D2
and D3 domain subtypes fall into 15, 13 and 21 structural
groups, respectively. The degree of sequence similarity
among the group representatives (32–45% identical residues) is in the range of sequence similarity between XFL
and mammalian FcR domains. In the case of D3, the
diversity is mainly derived from a small number of genes
located in the scaffolds 362, 435, 1131 and 1256. For
instance, the extracellular parts of the predicted proteins
1131_3 and 1131_5 are composed of five D3 domains
each. These domains are subdivided into four groups.
Each of five D3 domains of the XFL 1256_2 represents a
distinct structural variant producing a separate branch in
the tree. On the other hand, more than 50 proteins
encoded by the genes of the other scaffolds have one to
seven D3 domains belonging to the same group (group
1). This group may be further subdivided into three main
subgroups 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 and a number of individual
members based on the structure of the D2 and D1
domains. For instance, the proteins encoded by the genes
on the scaffold 626 have very similar D3 domains but
their D1 and D2 domains fall into 8 structural variants
with poorly resolved relationships. This fact strongly suggests that intergenic exon recombination was a frequent
event in the evolution of the XFL family. Of ten genes containing exons for the D4, D5 or D6 domain subtypes, nine
belong to the subgroup 1.1 and one to the subgroup 1.3.
Interestingly subgroups 1.1 and 1.2 differ in patterns of
amino acid replacement in the D1 and D2 domains. The
D2 domains of subgroup 1.2 are characterized by extensive variation in the length and sequence of the FG loop,
the equivalent of CDR3 of the V-type domains (Fig. 5).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/148

The region covering the strands C to F is well conserved.
In contrast, the D2 domains of subgroup 1.1 show more
variation in the region between the C' and F strands. Their
F-G region is relatively conserved. The D1 domains of the
1.1 and 1.2 subgroups also display variability at different
sites (not shown) suggesting the existence of at least two
classes of ligands for the group I receptors. The D1 and D2
domains are implicated in binding to IgG and IgE by classical FcRs. However, the residues known to contact the Fc
portion of Ig are not conserved in the XFLs sequences,
Experimental support of XFL diversity
To gain a deeper insight into structure and expression of
the XFL genes, we studied this family in X. laevis, a close
relative of X. tropicalis. In contrast to X. tropicalis that has a
diploid genome, X. laevis is an allotetraploid species. The
immune system of X. laevis is one of the most thoroughly
studied among lower vertebrates [40-42]. Five different X.
laevis cDNAs for XFL proteins were obtained from the
IMAGE consortium and sequenced. More than 30 cDNAs,
11 of which were unique, were additionally cloned from
several X. laevis cDNA libraries using screening with an
exon encoding the D3 domain of group 1 as a probe. Of
16 distinct cDNAs, 9 were full-length, the others were
truncated at the 5' end. Nine cDNAs encoded typical cell
surface proteins containing TM2-like TM regions and
cytoplasmic tails of varying length with one to three tyrosine-based motifs (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequences of
two clones had short cytoplasmic tails. Their TM regions
contained the NxxR motif and were assigned to the TM1
subtype. One cDNA clone encoded protein lacking TM
but containing a typical cytoplasmic tail with two tyrosine-based motifs. Finally, four cDNAs coded for putative
secreted proteins composed of the Ig-like domains only.
At present, it is unclear whether or not the latter five
clones represent alternative transcripts of genes encoding
cell surface receptors.

As expected, the initial sequence comparisons demonstrated that most of X. laevis derived XFLs may be joined
into group 1. Their D3 domains shared 65 to 95% identical residues with each other and with the X. tropicalis D3
domains of the group 1 receptors. These proteins were
designated XFL1.1 – 1.14. As in the case of X. tropicalis, the
X. laevis group 1 proteins showed variable degree of identity (35 to 85%) in their D1 and D2 domains. Two other
proteins were designated XFL2 and XFL3. Their D3
domains shared 35–45% identical residues with each
other and with the D3 domains of the group 1 proteins.
According to the phylogenetic analysis (not shown), the
X. laevis XFL2 and XFL3 genes were most similar to the X.
tropicalis 435_1 and 1131_1, 2, 3 genes respectively.
To estimate the genomic complexity of the XFL family in
X. laevis, we performed Southern blot hybridization using

the D1-exon of XFL2 and D3-exons of the XFL1.1 and
XFL3 genes as probes under non-stringent conditions.
Multiple (up to 25) hybridizing bands were revealed on
the blots probed with the D3-exon of the XFL1.1 gene
(Fig. 6). The XFL2- and XFL3-specific probes revealed one
and three hybridizing bands, respectively. These results
demonstrated that the cloned XFL genes constitute only a
part of the family and that, like in X. tropicalis, most of the
X. laevis XFL genes appear to belong to the group 1.
X. laevis XFL genes are primarily expressed in lymphoid
tissues
To assess the XFL expression pattern, we performed
Northern blot hybridization of total RNA from various tissues of adult frogs. The exon for D3 domain of the group
I was used as a probe at low stringency conditions. As
expected, Northern blotting revealed diffuse bands representing multiple gene transcripts. The highest signal
intensity was observed in the spleen and thymus (Fig. 7).
To examine expression patterns of the individual genes,
we designed gene-specific primers for seven different XFL
cDNA. To exclude possible cross matching, the 3'-untranslated sequences were mainly used for the reverse primers.

The RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the tissue distribution of the corresponding mRNA is variable (Table 1).
The transcripts of all the genes were mainly detected in
lymphoid (spleen, thymus) and non-lymphoid tissues
containing cells of haemopoietic origin (e.g., liver, intestine, lung). Expression of the XFL3, XFL1.10 and XFL1.12
genes was detected in brain. The tissue distribution of
mRNA in tadpoles was slightly broader. In particular, all
XFLs tested except 1.8, were detected in the gills which is
known to be a very active immunological site owing to
intense blood circulation and high exposure to antigens
[43]. Furthermore, expression of the XFL1.8 gene was
found only in tadpole spleen. Different pattern of the XFL
transcript distribution in adults and larvae suggest that the
expression of at least a proportion of the XFL genes is
developmentally regulated.
TM1 facilitates XFL association with the FcRγ subunit
The presence of the NxxR motif-bearing TMs in many
XFLs suggested that, like the mammalian activating KIRLs,
these Xenopus receptors may require FcRγ chain for cell
surface expression and/or signal transduction. To examine
whether this is the case, we generated a series of constructs

permeabilized cells. However, the surface expression of
XFL2 was restored when it was co-transfected with FcRγ
(Fig. 8). In contrast to XFL2, XFL1.7-HA was targeted to
the surface of the transfected cells in the absence of the
adapter molecule, although its surface expression was
increased two-fold in the presence of FcRγ. Both XFL2 and
XFL1.7 proteins were readily expressed on the cell surface
when their EC regions were fused with a TM of PDGFR.
These results show that XFL molecules containing a TM1
region with the NxxR motif associate with the FcRγ chain.
The surface expression of XFL1.7 is less dependent on the
presence of FcRγ chain. This may be explained by divergent structure of their TMs. Such differences also have
been observed among the FcRγ-associating KIRLs; FcRγ is
critical for surface targeting of LILRA2, but not FcαR or
OSCAR [27,29,31].

Discussion
Comparative studies of mammals and chicken have
revealed an unexpected structural and functional variability of the paired receptor families such as FCRLs and KIRLs
[22,25,26,34-37]. Studies have also indicated that the repertoires of these families have evolved in a species-specific
manner. The evolutionary factors responsible for such
diversity remain poorly understood. The recent descrip-

tion of LITRs as putative teleost counterparts of both
FCRLs and KIRLs left many questions unanswered, since
only a weak similarity of LITRs to the mammalian and
avian receptors has been found [6,44]. The present study
fills the gap by extending the analysis of paired receptor
families to amphibians, the most primitive branch of
tetrapods.
In the diploid X. tropicalis we have identified at least 75
genes coding for paired FcR-like cell surface receptors. The
mere fact of the family expansion is not unusual. Rapid
evolutionary change of a gene content known as the
"expansion-contraction" or "birth-and-death" process has
been documented in many families of immunity-related
receptors [45]. What distinguishes the FcR family from
many other paired receptor families is the extraordinary
structural diversity of its members. Combinatorial joining
of six Ig domain subtypes generates as many as 24 EC
architectures. When we consider the TM subtypes as distinct domains, the number of the XFL domain architectures increases to 35. None of these variants are shared by
either human or mouse homologs, although five Igdomain subtypes are common for the Xenopus and mammalian proteins. Overall, 50 different domain architectures can be defined among human, mouse, and X.
tropicalis FcR-related proteins.

Except for the D1- and D2-subtype domains no homologous structural elements were found between XFLs and
catfish LITRs (not shown). Other Ig-domain subtypes
composing EC of LITRs seem to be more similar to the
KIRL domains. Such mixed domain composition has been
suggested to predate the KIR and FcR families [6]. The XFL
data are consistent with the suggestions that the FcR and
KIR families share evolutionary roots [33,46]. A strong
argument in favor of this model is the fact that activating
FcRs use a peculiar TM module (TM1) to associate with
FcRγ chain that is homologous to TMs of activating mammalian KIRLs. TM1 appears to be an ancestral element of
the primordial FcR/KIR family that has been lost by
CHIRs, classical FcRs and KIRs, but retained by XFLs as
well as Xenopus and mammalian KIRLs.
Although available data do not allow inferring the structure of the KIRL and FCRL ancestor, it is clear that the family evolved by inter- and intragenic recombinations in a
species-specific way. The former mechanism gave rapid
change in the number of genes per family (birth-anddeath), whereas the latter was responsible for extensive
domain shuffling. The FcR-related receptors in different
vertebrate species are similar in their subdivision into activating and inhibitory forms and predominant expression
in lymphoid tissues. However, the ratio of inhibitory to
activating members, the cellular distribution, and the
exact amount and architecture of ectodomains are unique
in each examined species.
What might be the evolutionary forces responsible for this
degree of diversity common among the FcR- and KIRrelated receptors, and XFLs in particular? We can try to
answer this question by inference from the attributed
function of the actual mammalian receptors, which is to
regulate immune responses. Classical FcRs regulate B cell
responses by binding to the IgG and IgE immune complexes, whereas KIRs, or at least their inhibitory forms,
regulate NK cell function by binding specifically to MHC
class I molecules. However, Ig-binding appears to be a secondary or (derived) specialization, since our previous [37]
and present data together with the definition of a chicken
IgY receptor as a member of the CHIR family [47] strongly
argue that classical FcRs have emerged after the separation
of mammals and birds. MHC-recognition as a potential
ancient function of FCRLs/KIRLs is more attractive. The
ability to interact with classical and non-classical MHC
class I molecules is a feature of some KIRLs [11-13,48-50],
it has been also suggested for mammalian FCRLs [51] and
catfish LITRs [46]. From this point of view the diversification of FCRL/KIRLs may have been driven by the necessity
to match the rapid evolution of MHC loci under pathogen
pressure of, as it has been suggested for the KIR and Ly49
gene clusters [[32,52] and [53]]. This may be the case for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/148

XFLs too as there are at least 20 non-classical MHC class I
in X. laevis [54].
There are however some inconsistencies with this scenario. First, the scope of variability of domain architectures among FCRLs seems to be excessively high relative to
MHC class I molecular structure. Second, the functions of
mammalian KIRLs are not limited to MHC antigen-binding. Among ligands of these receptors, there are also collagens (GPVI and LAIR1), IgA (human FcαR), IgG (bovine
FcγR2) and integrins (mouse Gp49B1) [55-59]. Human
α1-B-glycoprotein, a distant secreted relative of KIRLs,
binds to the cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 [60], while
its opossum homolog is a snake venom metalloproteinase-neutralizing factor [61]. Due to the independent
expansion of KIR-related receptors in mammals, birds
[34,35] and amphibians [our unpublished data] it is difficult to determine which of these functions are truly
ancient or of ancestral type. Finally, mouse Ly49 is a clear
example of the self-MHC recognition served by receptors
structurally different from KIRLs and FCRLs.
An alternative explanation for the extraordinary diversity
of XFLs and other FcR- and KIR-related receptors may be
that they are directly involved in innate immunity. Combinatorial diversity is a hallmark of the immune system
and it is usually associated with recognition of pathogens.
The capacity of paired receptors to directly bind to pathogens is well documented [62-66]. In the latest of these
studies it has been found that mouse PIR-B, and its
human relatives LILRB1 and LILRB3 recognize Staphylococcus aureus and modulate TLR-mediated inflammatory
responses against this bacterium. These facts are usually
interpreted in terms of adaptive coevolution of the microorganisms, which implies that the pathogen recognition is
a secondary or derived function. However, the extensive
variability of the FcR/KIR relatives raises the possibility
that these receptors expanded primarily to fight pathogens, whereas the known immuno-regulatory functions
may represent secondary acquisitions or specializations.
Depending on the nature of the pathogen and the signal
properties of the receptors, it is clear that pathogen-receptor interaction may be either advantageous or detrimental
for the host, and as such, may rapidly change the ratio of
activating versus inhibitory receptors, as well as their
respective amount and specificities. In this regard, a parallel may be drawn with the species-specific expansion of
various receptor families in invertebrates that participate
in innate immune responses [67,68]. While it may be difficult to obtain direct evidence to support this scenario, it
clearly deserves attention. The elucidation of the factors
responsible for the diversification of the FcR- and KIRrelated receptors may contribute to better understand

their function and ultimately develop new therapies based
on their immunoregulatory properties.

Conclusion
Our study shows that in two amphibian species Xenopus
tropicalis and X. laevis, paired receptors have diversified
into a large family of genes, XFLs, preferentially expressed
in lymphoid tissues. The extracellular regions of these
receptors are composed of one to eleven Ig-like domains
belonging to six structural subtypes. A fraction of XFLs use
a TM module (TM1) to associate with FcRγ signaling subunit. TM1 is highly similar to TMs of activating FcRγ-associating KIRLs. This fact strongly argues in favor of a
common evolutionary origin of the FcR and KIR families.
The variation in number and composition of distinct Iglike and TM domain subtypes generates striking diversity
of domain architectures among XFLs. Phylogenetic analysis shows that this diversity emerged in a lineage-specific
manner. Classical FcRs and other known mammalian
FcR-related proteins appear to be specific to mammals.
The continual and extensive diversification of domain
architectures in the FcR and KIR families indicates a strong
selection pressure not completely consistent with the
usual assumption that paired receptors have been primarily selected to regulate immune responses. We propose
that FcR/KIR-related receptors might have primarily
expanded as pathogen-recognizing components of innate
immunity while their known physiological functions
have been acquired later in a lineage-specific manner.

Methods
Experimental Animals
Adult and larval outbred Xenopus laevis were obtained
from the X. laevis Research Resource for Immunobiology
at the University of Rochester Medical Center [69]. Larval
development stages were determined according to Nieuwkoop and Faber [70]. All animals were handled under
strict laboratory and UCAR regulations. Adults and larvae
were euthanized with 0.5% and 0.1% Tricaine methanesulfonate (TMS), respectively.
cDNA library construction and screening
cDNA libraries from 2 μg spleen total RNA from Xenopus
laevis adults or froglets (stage 60–62) were constructed
using SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech).
First strand cDNA was amplified using Advantage 2 RCR
Enzyme System (Clontech). Size fractionation was
achieved by separation on a sepharose columns and 0.5–
4 kb cDNAs were ligated into lambdaTriplEx2 arms and
then packed with GigapackIII Gold Cloning Kit (Stratagene). Libraries containing 106 independent recombinant
clones were amplified. cDNA libraries from Xenopus laevis/
gilli LG7 hybrids (from adult spleen or tadpole spleen and
liver RNA) were kindly provided by Dr. Louis Du Pasquier
(University of Basel, Switzerland). All four cDNA libraries

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/148

described were screened using32P-labeled PCR fragment
coding for the first D3 domain of XFL1.2 (279 bp) as
described by Sambrook et al. [71]. Plasmids containing
cDNA inserts were recovered from isolated positive
phages by in vivo excision. cDNAs were sequenced using
an automated fluorescent sequencer ABI-Prizm 310
(Applied Biosystems).
GenBank accessions of cDNA clones
Xenopus EST cDNA clones dc12e01, dai46h06, daa24c04,
dab24g06 and NISC_mp06d01 were obtained from the
I.M.A.G.E. Consortium [72] through ATCC (USA) or
Research Genetics Inc (USA), sequenced as described
above and submitted to GenBank. Accession numbers for
these cDNAs are [GenBank: AY293300], [GenBank:

DQ367415] and [GenBank: EF431890–EF431893] accession numbers were assigned to cDNA sequences obtained
through cDNA library screening.
Southern blot analysis
Genomic DNA from Xenopus erythrocytes was isolated as
described by Sambrook et al. [71] and digested to completion with restriction endonucleases BamHI, HindIII or
PvuII. The digested DNA (10 μg/lane) was separated on
1% agarose gel and transferred onto Zeta-probe nylon
membranes (BioRad Laboratories) by the vacuum blotting technique in 0.4 M NaOH. Hybridizations with 32Plabeled probes were performed following the membrane
manufacturer's recommendations. The probes were PCR
amplified fragments coding for the first D3 domain of
XFL1.2 (279 bp), D1 domain of XFL2 (215 bp) or D3
domain of XFL3 (239 bp).
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and RT-PCR
amplification
Tissue samples were homogenized in 0.8 mL of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted according to
the manufacturer's protocol. A sample RNA pellet was
resuspended in RNase free water and quantified with
SmartSpec spectrophotometer (BioRad). 500 ng of quantified total RNA were used to synthesize cDNA with iScript
first strand cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Negative RT controls were run
for each sample at the same time. cDNA and negative RT
control samples were diluted three times to a final volume
of 60 μl before proceeding to PCR amplification. For each
PCR reaction (30 μl total volume) 3 μl of 2 mM dNTPs, 3
μl of 10× PCR buffer, 10 pmol of each primer, 2 U of Taq
DNA polymerase (Life Technologies), and 1 μl of cDNA
were used. Then tubes were set for 35 cycles: 45 sec at

Negative (RT) controls were also performed with same
primers to control for genomic DNA contamination.
Northern blot analysis
Total RNA (10 μg/lane) extracted and quantified as
described above, was separated on 1% agarose gel with
formaldehyde [71] and transferred onto Zeta-probe nylon
membranes (BioRad Laboratories) by capillary transfer in
20 × SSC. Hybridization with 32P-labeled probe was performed at non-stringent conditions following the membrane manufacturer's recommendations. The probe was
PCR amplified fragment coding for D3 domain of XFL1.5
(282 bp). As a control for RNA integrity a probe encoding
X. laevis β-actin was used.
Constructions
cDNA regions encoding an extracellular or extracellular
plus transmembrane part of XFL2 (or XFL1.7) were cloned
using primers with XmaI and PstI (or SalI) sites and
ligated into pDisplay (Invitrogen) vector with an N-terminal HA epitope and with or without a C-terminal PDGFR
transmembrane domain. The cDNA portions used were
45–809 bp or 45–938 bp for XFL2 cDNA [GenBank:
AY293305] and 225–806 bp or 225–938 bp for XFL1.7
cDNA [GenBank: EF591296]. Complete coding region of
X. laevis FcRγ cDNA [GenBank: EF431895] was cloned
using primers with NheI and ApaI sites and ligated into
pAP-Tag5 (GenHunter) vector with a C-terminal c-myc
epitope.
Immunochemistry and flow cytometry
Constructions were transiently transfected into 293T cells
using Unifectin 56 (IBCH, Moscow, Russia) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Seventy two hours after they
were transfected, the cells were used for immunocytochemistry and cytometric analysis. For cell surface staining, transfected cells were washed twice with Wash Buffer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/148

(PBS, containing 1% FCS and 0.1% NaN3). The cells were
first incubated with rabbit anti-HA (Sigma) (anti-hemagglutinin protein) in Wash Buffer for 30 min on ice. Cells
were then washed three times with cold Wash Buffer and
incubated with goat anti-rabbit Ig-FITC (BD Bioscience)
in Wash Buffer for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed
three times with Wash Buffer and analyzed using a microscope Axioscop 2 plus and FACSAria cytometer (BD Bioscience). For intracellular staining, transfected cells were
smeared on glass slides, fixed with acetone and stained for
FcRγ subunit with anti-c-myc monoclonal antibodies
(Sigma) and goat anti-mouse IgG-TexasRed (Molecular
Probes).
Bioinformatics tools
Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed
using utilities at the NCBI [73], EMBL [74] and BCM [75]
web sites. Amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal utilities in the MEGA3 software [39] and shaded with
the BoxShade program [76]. The nucleotide and amino
acid sequences of known genes were retrieved from the
GenBank using ENTREZ at the NCBI [73]. The genomic
sequences were retrieved from and analyzed at the
Ensembl [77,78] or JGI web sites [79]. Homology searches
were performed using TBLASTN and TFASTA programs.
The GeneScan program [80,81] and the Webgene program package [82,83] were used for the automated gene
structure prediction. The XFL-surrounding genes were
identified using the Ensembl and JGI utilities and were
verified by reciprocal sequence comparisons at the NCBI
website using the BLASTP program.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA3 [39]
for nucleotide sequences of exons and amino acid
sequences of domains after alignment with the CLUSTAL
option. In certain cases, the CLUSTAL generated alignments were manually corrected. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed using the bootstrap and interior branch tests
of the Neighbor-joining (NJ) method with p-distances
(proportion of differences). Minimum Evolution (ME)
trees were essentially the same as the NJ trees in the major
branching patterns.

Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of D1-D5 domains of X.
tropicalis, X. laevis XFLs and human FcR-related proteins. X. tropicalis genes are designated according to a scaffold number and their consecutive position at the corresponding scaffold (version 4.1). For proteins
containing multiple domains of the same type these domains are numbered from N- to C-terminus (i. e. D3.1-D3.3). X. laevis domains are
designated according to the name of the cloned XFL cDNA (XFL1.1-1.12,
XFL2 and XFL3) or GenBank accession number of the EST cDNA (i.e.
BU903031). Identical and similar residues are shown by white letters on
black and gray backgrounds, respectively. Dashes represent gaps introduced to maximize similarity.
