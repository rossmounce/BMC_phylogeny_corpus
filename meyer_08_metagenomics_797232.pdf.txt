Abstract
Background: Random community genomes (metagenomes) are now commonly used to study
microbes in different environments. Over the past few years, the major challenge associated with
metagenomics shifted from generating to analyzing sequences. High-throughput, low-cost nextgeneration sequencing has provided access to metagenomics to a wide range of researchers.
Results: A high-throughput pipeline has been constructed to provide high-performance computing
to all researchers interested in using metagenomics. The pipeline produces automated functional
assignments of sequences in the metagenome by comparing both protein and nucleotide databases.
Phylogenetic and functional summaries of the metagenomes are generated, and tools for
comparative metagenomics are incorporated into the standard views. User access is controlled to
ensure data privacy, but the collaborative environment underpinning the service provides a
framework for sharing datasets between multiple users. In the metagenomics RAST, all users retain
full control of their data, and everything is available for download in a variety of formats.
Conclusion: The open-source metagenomics RAST service provides a new paradigm for the
annotation and analysis of metagenomes. With built-in support for multiple data sources and a back
end that houses abstract data types, the metagenomics RAST is stable, extensible, and freely
available to all researchers. This service has removed one of the primary bottlenecks in
metagenome sequence analysis – the availability of high-performance computing for annotating the
data.

Background
The genomic revolution of the 1990s has yielded almost a
thousand sequenced microbial genomes. More recently,
the explosion of random community genomics, or
metagenomics, where DNA is sequenced directly from
environmental samples has provided insights into microbial communities. Currently, two approaches to sequencing metagenome samples are commonly used. In the
traditional approach, DNA is cloned into BACs, or small
plasmids, and dideoxy chain termination sequencing
("Sanger sequencing") is used to determine the sequences
[1,2]. In the alternative approach, DNA is sequenced without cloning, using one of the so-called next-generation
sequencing techniques, usually pyrosequencing. Both
approaches have advantages and disadvantages. For
example, Sanger sequencing generates longer sequence
reads but has inherent biases due to the cloning. Pyrosequencing has much higher throughput and a lower error
rate per base sequenced compared to Sanger sequencing,
but those errors are biased toward certain mistakes [3].
Regardless of the sequencing approach used to generate
the data, the first steps in analysis of any metagenome
involve comparing those sequences to known sequence
databases. This computationally intensive task provides
the basic data types for many subsequent analyses, including phylogenetic comparisons, functional annotations,
binning of sequences, phylogenomic profiling, and metabolic reconstructions.
Here we describe the development of a freely available,
fully automated open source system for processing
metagenome sequence data to generate these basic elements. A public implementation of this system has been
provided for all researchers to analyze their metagenomes.
Our service, the metagenomics RAST server (mg-RAST for
short), is available over the web to all researchers, and
access is not limited to specific groups or data types.
Almost 500 metagenomes have been processed through
the beta version of the pipeline so far.

Implementation and results
The MG-RAST server is an open source system based on
the SEED framework for comparative genomics [4,5].
Users can upload raw sequence data in fasta format; the
sequences will be normalized and processed and summaries automatically generated. Genome annotation systems
are ever evolving; therefore, in order to accommodate new
methods that may be developed, the pipeline was
designed with a modular framework that allows the rapid
addition of new analysis steps or comparative data at any
stage of the analysis. The server provides several methods
to access the different data types, including phylogenetic
and metabolic reconstructions, and the ability to compare
the metabolism and annotations of one or more metage-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/386

nomes and genomes. In addition, the server offers a comprehensive search capability. Access to the data is
password protected, and all data generated by the automated pipeline is available for download and analysis in
variety of common formats. Here we describe the key
components of the pipeline, which are summarized in
Figure 1.
User Registration and Management
The user registration serves two functions: to limit access
to each data set to the user and their colleagues and to
secure a valid email address in case correspondence is
required, for example if a data-processing problem occurs.
Once logged in, users can view their own metagenomes,
those to which the owner has granted them rights, and the
default set of publicly available metagenomes. The system
supports delegation of authorization so that users can
allow others to access one or more of their metagenomes.
In addition, data owners can release their metagenomes to
the public at any point, allowing all users of the system to
view their data.
Data Types
The pipeline accepts data in a number of formats: 454
reads may be uploaded directly in the format delivered by
454 [6], and fasta files typical of Sanger-sequences and
used by other platforms may also be uploaded. The pipeline will also accept assembled sequences in fasta format.
Sequence data may be compressed by one of several common computer programs to speed upload.

Users may choose to upload raw unassembled reads or
assembled contigs. As discussed below, each approach has
advantages and disadvantages. Users with a limited
number of larger contigs, where the average contig length
exceeds 40 kb, should consider using the RAST server for
the analysis of complete Bacterial and Archaeal genomes
[7].
The Genomics Standards Consortium has proposed a
minimal set of data, called the Minimum Information
about a Genome Sequence (MIGS) [8], that should be collected with every metagenome sequence. Although this is
an evolving standard, the metagenomics-RAST server is
MIGS-compliant. Metadata, accessory data about the
metagenome (e.g., date and location where the sample
was collected), is requested from the user at the time of
sequence submission. This data is stored with the user's
data and can be provided to the GSC genome catalogue,
and other archives, when the sequence data is ready for
public release.
Implementation and Core Analyses
The pipeline is implemented in Perl by using a number of
open source components, including the SEED framework

server.

[4], NCBI BLAST [9], SQLite, and Sun Grid Engine [10] as
components. The system also uses the publicly available
SEED subsystems, SEED nr, and FIGfam protein families
(see http://www.theSEED.org).
The distinct steps are implemented to provide a flexible,
extensible processing pipeline. The steps incrementally
add data to a self-contained "job directory" that contains
all job-relevant data in flat file and SQLite [11] format.
Relational database technology is used to efficiently provide a mapping of sequences in a metagenome to both
organisms and metabolic functions and at the same time
allow the user to change the parameters for the underlying
sequence matches. The user interface enables the download of the user's job directories, and a future version of
the software will allow uploading of user-created directories into the server.

After uploading the data, a normalization step (see Figure
2) is executed, generating unique internal IDs and removing exactly duplicate sequences from 454 data sets. (These
sequences are an artefact of the sequencing technique and
are not scientifically meaningful [12].)
In the second step, the sequences are screened for potential protein encoding genes (PEGs) via a BLASTX [9]
search against the SEED comprehensive nonredundant
database sourced from the INSDC databases, sequencing
centers, and other sources [4]. An expect value (E) cut-off
of 0.01 is used to pick up potentially coding elements.
(This was chosen empirically to increase the number of
potentially coding elements while not being overwhelming for data analysis.) In parallel with the BLASTX
searches, the sequence data is compared to all accessory
databases by using the appropriate algorithms and significance selection criteria. These databases include several

rDNA databases, including GREENGENES [13], RDP-II
[14], and the European 16S RNA database [15], and boutique databases such as the chloroplast database, mitochondrial database, and ACLAME database of mobile
elements [16]. The search criteria are specific for each
database. For example, screens for ribosomal RNA genes
are performed by using BLASTN against the rDNA databases, but much more stringent selection criteria are used
to identify candidate RNA genes than for identifying protein-encoding genes (by default, the similarity must
exceed 50 bp in length and have an expect value less than
1 × 10-5).
In the third step, these matches to external databases are
used to compute the derived data. First, a phylogenomic
reconstruction of the sample is computed by using both
the phylogenetic information contained in the SEED nr
database and the similarities to the ribosomal RNA database. Functional classifications of the PEGs are computed
by projecting against SEED FIGfams [17] and subsystems
based on these similarity searches [4]. These functional

assignments become the raw input to an automatically
generated initial metabolic reconstruction of the sample,
providing suggestions for metabolic fluxes and flows,
reactions, and enzymes.
One of the design goals of this server was easy accessibility
via a web-based interface. The interface provides views for
browsing and analysis of the data, as well as a means to
download all result tables and the sequences for every
subset displayed. Figure 3 provides an overview of the various elements of the user interface and highlights the
options for downloading various subsets. The user interface provides a means to alter some of the parameters
used to compute the functional, metabolic, and phylogenetic reconstruction. This allows more stringent match criteria (e.g., expectation value, score, overall percent
identity, length of match, and number of mismatches);
and, by restricting the matches, the derived data is dynamically changed. The default parameters have been chosen
by empirical testing and represent a tradeoff between
accuracy and specificity.

Comparative Metagenomics
The abundance of comparative metagenomics tools is
central to the utility of the mg-RAST platform. Various
tools have been built into the framework, allowing users
to compare their data against other metagenomes or complete genomes taken from the SEED [4] environment. The
subsystems heat map and the taxonomic heat map provide comparative metagenomics summaries that encapsulate the differences between samples.

The subsystem comparison tools identify the number of
pegs in each metagenome that are connected to a subsystem via protein level similarity. Based on these connections, each subsystem present in a sample is scored by
counting the number of sequences that are similar to a
protein in each subsystem. This score is divided by the
total number of sequences from the sample that are similar to any protein in a subsystem, to give a fraction of

sequences in subsystems that are in a given subsystem.
This approach allows comparisons between samples that
have different numbers of sequences. Since the fractions
tend to be small (a few sequences hit each subsystem, but
there are now over 600 subsystems in the SEED), the
scores can be factored for display purposes. Furthermore,
a nonquantitative approach is provided to group the subsystem scores, emphasizing those subsystems that are
most different between the samples. Moreover, the display can be limited to specific areas of metabolism, or
other subsystem groups, as desired by the user.
The taxonomic heat map works in an analogous fashion
but highlights the different taxonomic profiles in each
sample, as determined by the phylogenetic or phylogenomic approaches selected by the end user (e.g., 16S comparisons, phylogenomics from BLAST results). Again,
samples may be grouped in a nonquantitative fashion to

rapidly highlight particular phylogenetic groups that predominate in different samples.
Often a metagenome comprises a few dominant organisms, and many of the pathways in the metagenome can
be predicted. The automatically generated metabolic
reconstructions can be compared to any given metagenome or complete microbial genome. This approach highlights subsystems that are unique to a metagenome, a
comparative genome, or the subsystems common to both.
With these tools, users can identify shared metabolism
present in their samples.

Discussion
A completely new public metagenome annotation system
has been developed and released. The process is the result
of several years of planning and engineering. Designed to
leverage the SEED microbial genome annotation plat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/386

form, the mg-RAST platform provides seamless integration of metagenome data, microbial genomics, and
manually curated annotations. Each metagenome project
has its own requirements for stringency, datasets to be
analyzed, and output format for results. The metagenomics SEED pipeline was designed to allow alterations to the
parameters for the sequence matches underlying both the
phylogenetic and metabolic reconstructions to restrict
matches. It has been built by using an extensible format
allowing the integration of new datasets and algorithms
without a need for recomputation of existing results.
The mg-RAST service handles both assembled and
unassembled data. Each approach has advantages that
should be considered when comparing metagenomes. For
example, if one is carrying out comparative metagenomics
or if statistics are being used to compare samples [18,19],
the sequences cannot be assembled, since the assembly

the comparison (protein-based-only SEED subsystems or all SEED proteins vs. RNA based RDP or Greengenes) and the
parameters for the matches. The parameters include e-value, minimal alignment length, p-value, and percent identity. Finally,
the result (c) is displayed in tabular format, in which a heatmap-style color coding is used to highlight differences. The resulting
table can be downloaded as a spreadsheet.

process loses the frequency information critical for determining differences between samples. In contrast, assembled sequences tend to be longer and therefore more
likely to accurately identify gene function or phylogenetic
source from binning [20].
The analytical methods integrated into the pipeline provide core annotation and analysis tools to compare and
contrast a diverse set of metagenomes [21-24]. The
approach underlying the subsystems-based functional
analysis of metagenomes has been validated with 90 different samples from nine major biomes. The analysis
demonstrated that the biomes could clearly be separated
by their functional composition [25]. All of the metagenomes present in that study are included in the publicly
available datasets visible in the mg-RAST server.
Although the service contains core functionality for the
annotation and analysis of metagenomes, many of the
techniques traditionally used for genome analysis (e.g.,
approaches for the prediction of coding sequences) either
do not work with metagenomes or show a significant performance degradation [26]. Many of the differences
between complete genome annotation and metagenome
annotation are reminiscent of those encountered previously with the analysis of expressed sequenced tags [27].
Therefore, new analytical methods are needed to fully
understand metagenomics data. The most obvious problem is with the large number of unknown sequences in
any sample. Depending on the specific sample processed,
as few as 10% of the sequences or as many as 98% of the
sequences may have no known similarity to anything in
the database [28]. We and others are developing new binning, clustering, and coding region prediction tools to
handle these unknown sequences, and effective tools will
be incorporated into the pipeline when available. Another
problem is that the rapid pace with which sequence data
is being generated outpaces increases in computational
speed, and therefore improvements in common search
algorithms are required to ensure that sequence space can
be accurately and efficiently searched. A third problem,
common to all annotation platforms, is that metabolic
reconstructions and analyses are dependent on the underlying quality of the data. The SEED has the most consistent and accurate microbial genome annotations of any
publicly available source because of the subsystems
approach to annotation. However, the SEED subsystems
are necessarily focused on core metabolism and pathogenesis of a select few organisms. Comprehensive subsystem coverage of secondary metabolism, and especially of
metabolism specific to diverse environments, is required
to truly comprehend those data sets.

Conclusion
We have provided a free, public resource for the analysis
of metagenome sequence data. Our service does not
require a specific type of sequence data and has no
requirement for release or control of the data. All
sequence data remains protected by a password mechanism and is visible only to permitted users. This metagenomics annotation pipeline was specifically developed to
handle pyrosequencing data and accommodate some of
the nuances associated with that data. However, the tools
and approaches we have developed are applicable and
available for any metagenome project, regardless of
sequence type. This service has removed one of the primary bottlenecks in metagenome sequence analysis – the
availability of high-performance computing for annotating the data.

Availability
The service is available to all users after a simple registration process. In addition to being available through the
integrated SEED-Viewer [29] interface, all results are available for download in variety of formats, including GFF3,
GenBank, and flat text formats (e.g., tab-separated text for
use in spreadsheets). The server is made available on a
best-effort basis, and all underlying data and software are
open source (please see ftp://ftp.theseed.org).
Plans include the development of novel tools to allow systematic data mining in the samples and improved support
for in-depth analysis of 16S-based metagenome data sets.
