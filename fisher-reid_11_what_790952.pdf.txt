What are the consequences of combining nuclear
and mitochondrial data for phylogenetic analysis?
Lessons from Plethodon salamanders and 13
other vertebrate clades
M Caitlin Fisher-Reid* and John J Wiens

Abstract
Background: The use of mitochondrial DNA data in phylogenetics is controversial, yet studies that combine
mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data (mtDNA and nucDNA) to estimate phylogeny are common, especially in
vertebrates. Surprisingly, the consequences of combining these data types are largely unexplored, and many
fundamental questions remain unaddressed in the literature. For example, how much do trees from mtDNA and
nucDNA differ? How are topological conflicts between these data types typically resolved in the combined-data tree?
What determines whether a node will be resolved in favor of mtDNA or nucDNA, and are there any generalities that
can be made regarding resolution of mtDNA-nucDNA conflicts in combined-data trees? Here, we address these and
related questions using new and published nucDNA and mtDNA data for Plethodon salamanders and published data
from 13 other vertebrate clades (including fish, frogs, lizards, birds, turtles, and mammals).
Results: We find widespread discordance between trees from mtDNA and nucDNA (30-70% of nodes disagree per
clade), but this discordance is typically not strongly supported. Despite often having larger numbers of variable
characters, mtDNA data do not typically dominate combined-data analyses, and combined-data trees often share
more nodes with trees from nucDNA alone. There is no relationship between the proportion of nodes shared
between combined-data and mtDNA trees and relative numbers of variable characters or levels of homoplasy in
the mtDNA and nucDNA data sets. Congruence between trees from mtDNA and nucDNA is higher on branches
that are longer and deeper in the combined-data tree, but whether a conflicting node will be resolved in favor
mtDNA or nucDNA is unrelated to branch length. Conflicts that are resolved in favor of nucDNA tend to occur at
deeper nodes in the combined-data tree. In contrast to these overall trends, we find that Plethodon have an
unusually large number of strongly supported conflicts between data types, which are generally resolved in favor
of mtDNA in the combined-data tree (despite the large number of nuclear loci sampled).
Conclusions: Overall, our results from 14 vertebrate clades show that combined-data analyses are not necessarily
dominated by the more variable mtDNA data sets. However, given cases like Plethodon, there is also the need for
routine checking of incongruence between mtDNA and nucDNA data and its impacts on combined-data analyses.

Background
The field of molecular phylogenetics is heading towards
an exciting future. In this future, genomics will allow for
the use of dozens of unlinked nuclear loci to estimate
phylogenies [e.g. [1-5]]. These data may then be

analyzed using species-tree methods that use principles
of population genetics to resolve incongruence among
loci (e.g., BEST [6]; STEM [7]; *BEAST [8]).
But even as the field of phylogenetics seems to be
moving towards such a future, it is clearly not there yet.
For example, in animals, many phylogenies continue to
be estimated based on mitochondrial (mtDNA) data
alone [e.g. [9-12]], or a combined (concatenated) analysis of nuclear (nucDNA) and mtDNA data [e.g. [13-18]].

In many cases, these analyses of mtDNA or concatenated data may be necessary because sampling many
species makes it impractical to include many nuclear
loci (and due to fiscal constraints), and sampling many
species and/or few loci makes it impractical to utilize
explicit species-tree methods (despite strong theoretical
justification for their use; e.g., [6,8,19]). Many review
papers have addressed the pros and cons of mtDNA
data [e.g. [20-24]], and many empirical studies have suggested the need for caution in their use [e.g. [25-27]].
However, most reviews have focused on the use of
mtDNA in phylogeographic studies [e.g. [23,24,28]] and
on the question of whether mtDNA should be used in
phylogenetics at all [e.g. [22]].
Here, we address a somewhat different question.
Given that many systematists routinely estimate phylogenies using combined mtDNA and nucDNA, we ask:
what are the consequences of the common practice of
combining these two types of data? For example, will
the combined-data tree tend to resemble the mtDNA
tree due to larger numbers of variable mtDNA characters? Or will the combined-data tree contain a mixture
of clades favored by the separate data sets? Are there
any generalities that can be made about when mtDNA
or nucDNA data will be favored in particular clades or
data sets? These questions are particularly important
because many published studies simply present trees
from combined analyses of mtDNA and nucDNA, without any examination of whether the mtDNA and
nucDNA trees are congruent, or to what extent the
combined-data tree reflects the contributions of each
data set [e.g. [14-18], but see for example [29]]. In fact,
if combined-data trees are often discordant with trees
from nucDNA and largely reflect the mtDNA data
instead, there may be little to be gained by collecting
and adding nucDNA data in the first place (i.e., if trees
are estimated from the combined-data and nucDNA
have negligible impact on the combined-data analysis).
To our knowledge, these important questions have
never been the subject of a focused study.
In this paper, we address these and related questions,
by evaluating combined-data analyses that utilize both
mtDNA and nucDNA data. We approach these questions using new data and analyses for Plethodon salamanders, along with new analyses of existing data sets
from 13 other vertebrate groups. Below, we describe the
four main questions (and five associated predictions)
that we address. For each of the four main questions,
we are attempting to discern if there are generalities
that can be made regarding the interaction of mtDNA
and nucDNA data sets in a combined-data analysis.
First, are there frequent conflicts between separate
mtDNA and nucDNA trees, and are the conflicting
clades strongly supported by each data set? Weakly

Page 2 of 20

supported conflicts may be spurious and thus not problematic, whereas strongly supported conflicts may
reflect more serious issues (such as long-branch attraction or discordance between gene and species trees) that
may confound combined analyses [e.g. [6,30-34]]. As a
working hypothesis, we predict that (i) discordance
between mtDNA and nucDNA will generally be uncommon, and if found, will often be weakly supported by
one or both data sets. This prediction is based on the
simple expectation that both mitochondrial and nuclear
genes will frequently share the same underlying phylogenetic history (especially given that smaller effective
population sizes of mitochondrial genes may reduce discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting [21]), and
that incongruence may often be due to estimated phylogenies that do not fully match the underlying gene trees
[30-32].
Second, are conflicts between the separate mtDNA
and nucDNA trees generally resolved in favor of
mtDNA or nucDNA in the combined-data tree? Mitochondrial genes are generally thought to evolve more
rapidly than nuclear genes, and so should have more
variable characters but should also have more homoplasy [e.g. [21,22]]. In general, we expect conflicts
between data sets to be resolved in favor of the data set
with more variable characters, but also with less homoplasy. A data set with extensive conflict among characters (i.e., high homoplasy due to random noise from
high overall rates of character change) may be less likely
to overturn relationships inferred from a data set with
less internal conflict among characters. Thus, the resolution of conflicts between mtDNA and nucDNA data sets
in the combined-data tree may vary from analysis to
analysis, depending on the number of characters
sampled in each data set and their levels of variability
and homoplasy. We predict that (ii) when mtDNA dominates a combined-data tree, it will be due to larger
numbers of variable characters compared to nucDNA,
and (iii) when nucDNA dominates a combined-data
tree, it will be due to lower levels of homoplasy compared to mtDNA.
We address these predictions by first comparing the
number of nodes shared between trees from mtDNA,
nucDNA, and the combined-data, across 14 vertebrate
clades. Next, we test if the proportion of nodes shared
between the combined-data and mtDNA trees is correlated with the overall proportion of the variable sites in
the combined data that are from mtDNA (given the prediction that the data set with more variable characters
will have a stronger influence on the combined-data
tree). We also test if the resolution of conflicts in the
combined-data tree is related to the level of homoplasy
in the mtDNA versus nucDNA data sets, given the prediction that the combined-data tree will be resolved in

Fisher-Reid and Wiens BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/300

favor of the data set with less homoplasy (i.e., nucDNA)
regardless of the relative numbers of variable sites.
Third, what generalities, if any, can we make about
which nodes of the combined-data tree are resolved in
favor of mtDNA vs. nucDNA? We expect that the resolution of nodes in the combined-data tree may depend
on the underlying branch lengths and the depth of
those branches in the tree. We predict (iv) mtDNA and
nucDNA will be more congruent on longer branches,
because allele histories should coalesce on longer
branches, reducing discordance among genes due to
incomplete lineage sorting [35]. Furthermore, introgression is less likely among more distantly related species
(i.e., separated by longer branches), due to the accumulation of reproductive isolating mechanisms over time
[36], which should also contribute to greater congruence
between mtDNA and nucDNA on longer branches
(especially if mitochondrial introgression is an important
source of discordance between mtDNA and nucDNA
trees; e.g., [25]). Longer branches may also be more congruent if they tend to be more strongly supported by
each gene [4], reducing spurious conflicts between
mtDNA and nucDNA due to weak support. We expect
shorter branches to be resolved in favor of mtDNA,
given that there may be too little time for mutations to
accumulate on the shortest branches for slower-evolving
nuclear genes. In addition, there may be extensive
incongruence among nuclear genes on short branches
due to incomplete lineage sorting, also leading to weaker
branch support [e.g. [4]]. In contrast, the mitochondrial
genome is a single locus (such that there should be no
incongruence among histories of mitochondrial genes),
and incomplete lineage sorting may be less problematic
at the between-species level due to the generally smaller
effective population size of the mitochondrial genome
[e.g. [20,22,37]].
Finally, when mtDNA and nucDNA trees conflict, we
predict (v) that nucDNA may be more likely to win conflicts deeper in the combined-data tree, while mtDNA
may win resolutions that are shallower [e.g. [38,39]].
Clades deep in the tree may be harder to resolve due to
long-branch attraction [40], and faster evolving genes
(like mtDNA) will likely exacerbate problems of longbranch attraction (i.e., branch lengths may generally
tend to be longer). The importance of tree depth may
depend not only on the relative placement of branches
in the tree, but also on overall branch lengths (with
mtDNA being more problematic when branches are
generally longer). The potential for nucDNA data to
better resolve deep branches may be an important justification for including these data in the first place, along
with the desire to sample unlinked loci.
In summary, a consideration of general principles suggests conflicts between mtDNA and nucDNA may be

Page 3 of 20

uncommon and weakly supported, and that the resolution of conflicting nodes in the combined analysis (i.e.,
favoring mtDNA vs. nucDNA) may vary based on the
number of variable characters and level of homoplasy in
each mtDNA and nucDNA data set, the lengths of
branches, and the depths of branches in the tree. We
test these predictions empirically here, using new data
from Plethodon salamanders and published data from 13
other vertebrate clades.
Plethodon is the most species-rich genus of North
American salamanders [41]. They are terrestrial, directdeveloping salamanders that are generally common and
diverse in North American forests [42]. Plethodon have
long interested evolutionary biologists and ecologists,
and hundreds of papers have been published on Plethodon in diverse areas, including studies of behavior, [e.g.
[43-46]], community ecology [e.g. [47-49]], patterns of
trait evolution [e.g. [13,50]], speciation and hybridization
[e.g. [51-58]], and response to environmental change [e.
g. [59-61]]. Many of these studies have used a phylogenetic approach, making a reliable phylogeny for Plethodon particularly important.
Earlier studies addressed Plethodon phylogeny using
data from allozymes [e.g. [52,53]] and mtDNA [e.g. [56]],
whereas more recent studies have combined mtDNA and
nucDNA data [e.g., [13,57]]. In general, these studies
have yielded similar estimates of higher-level Plethodon
phylogeny (e.g., most agree on a split between eastern
and western species, and on the species groups in eastern
North America). However, there have been substantive
disagreements between studies regarding some specieslevel relationships (e.g., within the cinereus group; [13]).
Furthermore, all previous studies used relatively few
nuclear loci (two or three; [13,57,61]). Here we obtain
new data from five nuclear loci and combine these with
existing data from four nuclear genes and three mitochondrial genes, and use these data to address Plethodon
phylogeny and general questions about combining
mtDNA and nucDNA in phylogenetic studies.

Results
Plethodon phylogeny

Trees from Bayesian analyses of the combined-data,
mtDNA, and nucDNA for Plethodon are summarized in
Figures 1, 2, and 3. The separate data sets generally
agree on the major clades (eastern, western) and species
groups (cinereus, wehrlei-welleri, glutinosus) recognized
in previous studies [e.g., [13,52,56,57]]. Nevertheless, the
mtDNA and nucDNA conflict with each other at 34 of
51 nodes, and conflicts at 19 of the 34 discordant nodes
are strongly supported by both data types (Table 1). In
15 of these 19 cases, these strongly supported conflicts
are resolved in favor of the mtDNA in the combineddata tree. Of the remaining four strongly supported

A summary of the number of variable characters that each data type (mtDNA, nucDNA) contributes to each combined analysis and the amount of homoplasy in
each data set (lower values indicate more homoplasy; see Additional File 8 for additional details on each data set). The consistency index excludes uninformative
characters. Outgroups were not included.

conflicts, three (nodes 28, 36, and 45) have topologies
unique to the combined-data tree, and one (node 47) is
resolved in favor of the nucDNA. The topology of the
combined-data tree shares 73% of its nodes with the
mitochondrial tree, and 27% with the nuclear tree
(Table 2). The mtDNA data set has a greater number of
variable characters and a higher level of homoplasy
when compared to the nucDNA (Table 3).
The mean branch lengths and node depths grouped by
clade-resolution category are summarized in Table 4,
and significance tests are summarized in Additional File
1. Concordance between the nuclear and mitochondrial
trees occurs on significantly longer branches in the
combined-data tree (W = 131.5; P = 0.0055). Discordance occurs at intermediate branch lengths, and the
branches resolved favoring mtDNA are not significantly
different in length from those favoring nucDNA clades
(W = 75; P = 0.50). Clades found only in the combineddata tree are significantly shorter than clades that are
concordant between mtDNA and nucDNA (W = 67; P
= 0.0007) and those that are discordant (W = 104; P =
0.015). Nodes of the combined-data tree favoring the
mtDNA occur at shallower depths in the combined-data
tree than those favoring the nucDNA, but this trend
was not significant (W = 80; P = 0.3454).
Comparisons across clades

Trees from Bayesian analyses of the combined-data,
mtDNA, and nucDNA for the other 13 vertebrate clades

are summarized in Additional File 2. Combining our
results from Plethodon with those from these 13 other
clades, we find that discordance between trees from
mtDNA and nucDNA is very common, with only 3070% (mean = 49%) of nodes concordant in each study.
Seven of the 14 data sets show extensive incongruence
between mtDNA and nucDNA, with only a minority of
nodes (range among seven data sets = 30-49%; mean =
38%; Table 1) in common between them in each data
set. In addition, four of the remaining seven data sets
show only a slight majority of congruent nodes between
mtDNA and nucDNA (range among four data sets =
54-58%; mean = 56%; Table 1). The final three data sets
show more extensive congruence (range among three
data sets = 63-70%; mean = 67%; Table 1).
Nevertheless, despite this widespread incongruence, in
all clades except Plethodon, only a minority of the conflicts between mtDNA and nucDNA are strongly supported (range among 13 clades = 9-44%; mean = 25%;
Plethodon = 56%; Table 1). These strongly supported
conflicts are often resolved in favor of mtDNA (mean =
56% across the 14 data sets; 79% in Plethodon), but the
trend is not significant for most data sets, and in four
out of 14 data sets, these strong conflicts are more often
resolved in favor of nucDNA (Table 1). Of the remaining conflicts, 0-46% (mean = 26%) were weakly supported by both data sets, 0-56% (mean = 23%) were
strongly supported by nucDNA, but weakly supported
by mtDNA, and 0-44% (mean = 24%) were weakly

A summary of the mean branch lengths and mean node depths of branches in the combined-data trees for each clade, grouped by how they are resolved. For
the node depths, larger numbers indicate shallower nodes (i.e. those closer to the tips and farther from the root). The last row of pooled data reports mean
relative branch lengths and mean relative node depths. Significance testing is summarized in the Results and more extensively in Additional File 1.

supported by nucDNA, but strongly supported by
mtDNA (Table 1).
Surprisingly, we find that the combined-data trees are
more similar to the nucDNA trees for eight of 14 data
sets (Table 2). Four of those eight data sets have nearly
equal numbers of variable characters between the
mtDNA and nucDNA data sets (balistid fish, cotingid
birds, emydid turtles, murid rodents (Philippines); Table
3), but two actually have many more variable mtDNA
characters than nucDNA characters (hylid frogs, phrynosomatid lizards; Table 3). The remaining two data
sets (caprimulgid birds, murid rodents (Sahul = Australia and New Guinea); Table 3), had substantially more
variable nucDNA characters than mtDNA characters.
The ability of nucDNA data to sometimes dominate
more nodes of the combined-data tree with only a minority of variable characters is surprising. One obvious
explanation for this pattern is that the mtDNA characters have consistently higher levels of homoplasy than
nucDNA characters (Table 3). However, the proportion
of shared nodes between the combined-data tree and
the mtDNA tree (first column, Table 2) was not correlated with either of our indices of relative mtDNA
homoplasy (consistency index: r = 0.33; P = 0.26; retention index: r = 0.19; P = 0.51). The proportion of shared
nodes between the combined-data tree and the mtDNA

tree was not significantly correlated with the proportion
of mtDNA variable sites (r = 0.49; P = 0.08), although
there is a trend in this direction. Multiple regression of
the proportion of nodes shared between the mtDNA
and combined-data trees on homoplasy and variability
was not significant for either homoplasy index (all
values of P â¥ 0.807).
Comparisons across all 14 data sets confirm our prediction that branches in the combined-data tree that are
concordant between mtDNA and nucDNA are longer
on average than other branches (Table 4; Figure 4; concordant vs. discordant in Additional File 1). However,
contrary to our expectations, there is no support for the
hypothesis that shorter branches tend to be resolved in
favor of mtDNA and longer branches in favor of
nucDNA (see Additional File 1). The only significant
pattern is found in hylid frogs (W = 37; P = 0.0475) and
caprimulgid birds (W = 91; P = 0.0011), in which clades
resolved in favor of mtDNA are significantly longer than
those resolved in favor of nucDNA (the opposite of our
expectations).
Thirteen out of 14 clades (all except hylids) show the
predicted pattern in which deeper branches of the combined-data tree are resolved in favor of nucDNA and
shallower branches are resolved in favor of mtDNA
(Table 4; Additional File 1). Although this pattern is

only significant within hemiphractids (W = 69; P =
0.0055), finding the same pattern in 13 of 14 clades is
statistically significant (P < < 0.0001; exact binomial
test). The lack of significant patterns within each clade
may reflect limited sample size for significance testing
(e.g., phrynosomatids have only two clades resolved in
favor of mtDNA). Pooling relative node depths across
clades shows that branches on which mtDNA is favored
are significantly shallower than branches on which
nucDNA is favored (W = 5655.5; P = 0.0133; Figure 4),
and nodes that are concordant between mtDNA and
nucDNA are significantly deeper than discordant clades
(W = 37282.5; P = 0.0261; Figure 5). Across all clades,
relative node depth is negatively correlated with relative
branch length (r s = -0.31; P < < 0.00001), such that
longer branches tend to be found deeper in the tree.
The longer branches deeper in the tree may explain the
greater concordance between mtDNA and nucDNA on
deep branches.

Combining data from nucDNA and mtDNA is a common practice in phylogenetic studies, but one whose
consequences have gone largely unstudied (or at least
under-reported). This is surprising given the extensive
debate about pros and cons of mtDNA data for phylogenetic analysis [e.g. [20-24,28,37]], and about combining
data in general [e.g. [6,19,31-33,62]]. In this study, we
test several key predictions about how mtDNA and
nucDNA interact in combined-data analyses, using new
data from Plethodon salamanders and published data
from 13 other vertebrate clades.
Our results suggest that even though conflicts between
mtDNA and nucDNA are widespread in these 14 groups,
the general dominance of mtDNA in combined-data
trees is not supported, even in two clades in which the
number of variable mtDNA characters greatly outnumbers those from the nucDNA (see below). We find that
discordance between mtDNA and nucDNA trees is common: across the 14 data sets, 30-70% (mean = 49%) of
nodes are concordant. This suggests that the issue of
how these conflicts are resolved in the combined-data
analysis is of critical importance. But we also find that
many of these conflicts are only weakly supported by one
or both data sets. Strongly supported conflicts (for which
conflicting clades are strongly supported by each type of
data) tend to be uncommon (mean = 27% of discordant
nodes, range 9-56%), and may be resolved in favor of
either mtDNA or nucDNA with almost equal frequency
(mean = 54% in favor of mtDNA, range = 0-100%).
Surprisingly, we find that in the majority of the 14
data sets, the combined-data tree is more similar to the
nucDNA tree than the mtDNA tree (i.e., shares more
nodes). In fact, nucDNA can dominate the combineddata tree even when the number of variable mtDNA
characters is 2-3 times that of the variable nucDNA
characters (i.e., in hylid frogs and phrynosomatid
lizards). The most obvious explanation for this pattern
is that the lower homoplasy of nucDNA characters may
outweigh the influence of the larger numbers of variable
mtDNA characters. However, our analyses of the relationship between homoplasy levels and the dominance
of the combined-data tree by mtDNA do not support
the idea that more homoplasy in mtDNA necessarily
leads to combined-data trees that more closely resemble
the nucDNA trees. There are several possible explanations for this unexpected combination of results. One is
that the differences in homoplasy between mtDNA and
nucDNA are primarily what matter, and that variation
in levels of homoplasy among mtDNA data sets (which
is what our indices mostly reflect, see Methods) is relatively unimportant. Another (non-exclusive) possibility

Fisher-Reid and Wiens BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/300

is that the conflicts between mtDNA and nucDNA
occur because of processes that are not reflected by
levels of homoplasy in the mtDNA data (e.g., introgression, incomplete lineage sorting).
Contrary to our expectations, we find no evidence that
shorter branches are generally resolved in favor of
mtDNA. In fact, among the 14 data sets, the only significant trend is for longer branches to be resolved in favor
of mtDNA, which occurs in hylid frogs and caprimulgid
birds. We do find that within a given combined-data
tree, there is a tendency for longer branches to be
agreed upon by mtDNA and nucDNA. This result parallels the pattern seen among nuclear genes in some studies, where congruence between genes increases on
longer branches, possibly due to fewer conflicts between
gene and species trees associated with incomplete lineage sorting [e.g. [4,27]]. The causes of discordance
between mtDNA and nucDNA on shorter branches are
not entirely clear. Most of the conflicts (73%) we uncovered between mtDNA and nucDNA are not strongly
supported by one or both data sets. Therefore, spurious
resolution of weakly supported clades may be a major
cause of disagreement. We also find that clades that are
absent in both the separate mtDNA and nucDNA trees
(unique) tend to be the shortest branches in the combined-data tree, suggesting that they have few supporting characters from either data set.
Finally, our prediction that deeper nodes tend to be
resolved in favor of nucDNA was supported in 13 out of
14 data sets, and when data were pooled across clades.
Interestingly, one clade (hylid frogs) showed the opposite pattern, with deeper nodes typically resolved in
favor of mtDNA. In fact, the idea that mtDNA and
nucDNA will resolve different portions of the phylogeny
(shallow vs. deep; e.g., [38,39]) may be one of the major
motivations for obtaining and combining these data
types in the first place. Our prediction was based on the
idea that long-branch attraction might be more common among deeper nodes, and that slow-evolving
nucDNA might help resolve such problems. This prediction is further supported by a significant negative correlation between branch length and node depth,
suggesting that longer branches are indeed found deeper
in the tree (note that without considerable rate heterogeneity it would be difficult for a long branch to be
shallowly placed). Our results here suggest that nucDNA
does indeed help to resolve deeper branches in the phylogeny (see also [38,39]), and for this reason, nucDNA
data are worth pursuing in clades for which phylogeny
was previously estimated by mtDNA only.
In summary, our results suggest that combined analyses of mtDNA and nucDNA are not necessarily dominated by mtDNA, even though conflicts between
mtDNA and nucDNA are indeed common. Thus, both

Page 12 of 20

data sets typically contribute to resolution of combineddata trees, and the addition of nucDNA data can be
worthwhile. However, we do find considerable variation
in these patterns among clades, which suggests the need
for routine checking of incongruence between mtDNA
and nucDNA and its impacts on combined analyses. For
example, our results for Plethodon show widespread,
strongly-supported incongruence between mtDNA and
nucDNA that is generally resolved in favor of mtDNA
(despite inclusion of nine nuclear genes). It should also
be noted that we only considered data sets in which the
overall taxon sampling of mtDNA and nucDNA was
basically identical. Cases in which one data set is more
broadly sampled might certainly alter these dynamics (e.
g. nucDNA for 80 species and mtDNA for ~200 species;
[63]). Furthermore, dramatic differences in sampling of
genes between these genomes could obviously influence
the results (e.g., whole mitochondrial genomes vs. a single nuclear gene; [29]). Nevertheless, our results provide
an initial baseline for understanding how mtDNA and
nucDNA may typically interact to determine the results
of combined analyses.
Plethodon phylogeny

Our survey of vertebrate clades shows that the results
for Plethodon are quite unusual, in both the preponderance of widespread, strongly supported incongruence
between mtDNA and nucDNA, and the consistency
with which the incongruence is resolved in favor of the
mtDNA. We speculate that mitochondrial introgression
between young but distantly related species may be a
major factor driving this pattern. For example, P. shermani has been previously classified as a member of the
jordani species complex [e.g., [64]]. All members of the
jordani complex, except P. shermani, are placed in clade
B in the combined-data tree (Figure 1). We find P. shermani in clade A in the mtDNA (Figure 2) and combined-data (Figure 1) trees, where it is placed in a clade
with P. aureolus, with which it is known to hybridize
[52,54,57]. In contrast, in the nucDNA tree (Figure 3),
P. shermani is placed in clade B with strong support.
This pattern suggests the possibility that P. shermani
belongs to clade B, but mitochondrial introgression with
P. aureolus leads to its placement in clade A in the
mtDNA and combined-data trees. Placement of this species into these two different major clades by mtDNA
and nucDNA contributes to the broad-scale incongruence between these data sets.
Despite the widespread incongruence between mtDNA
and nucDNA, we find some cases where the new
nucDNA data do appear to improve the combined-data
results. For example, in the mtDNA tree (Figure 2), P.
jordani and P. metcalfi (of the jordani complex) are at
the base of the glutinosus group, while the rest of the

Fisher-Reid and Wiens BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/300

jordani complex (P. amplus, P. cheoah, P. meridianus, P.
montanus) is within clade B (except for P. shermani, see
above). In the nucDNA (Figure 3) and combined-data
(Figure 1) analyses in the present study, P. jordani and
P. metcalfi are placed in clade B with strong support.
Despite these potential improvements, there are still
many issues to be resolved with future work on Plethodon systematics. Many clades in the nucDNA tree (Figure 3) are still weakly supported (despite use of nine
nuclear genes), especially in the rapid, recent radiation
of the glutinosus complex. Sequencing yet more nuclear
loci may be helpful here. There also appear to be important taxonomic issues to resolve in the glutinosus complex, which will require sampling many populations as
well as many loci. For example, individuals of P. aureolus and P. glutinosus are found in separate clades in
both mtDNA and nucDNA, suggesting the presence of
multiple species. Sampling the same nuclear genes used
here in individuals from many localities within the range
of each species may be a useful next step for better
resolving both species limits and the phylogeny.

Conclusions
Combined analyses of mtDNA and nucDNA are common, but the consequences of combining these data are
largely unexplored. This trend is somewhat unsettling
given that use of mtDNA is somewhat controversial,
and given the possibility that mtDNA might dominate
combined analyses due to larger numbers of variable
characters. Our results here for 14 vertebrate clades
show that even though conflicts between mtDNA and
nucDNA are indeed widespread, they are typically
weakly supported, and mtDNA does not dominate combined-data trees in the majority of clades. Instead, both
data types often contribute to resolving the combined-

Page 13 of 20

data tree, with nucDNA being particularly useful for
deep branches. Thus, even though nucDNA data is traditionally more difficult to obtain in animals than
mtDNA (hence the large number of studies still using
mtDNA alone), and typically yields fewer variable characters per base pair (Table 3), our results suggest that
the added cost and effort needed to obtain and add
nucDNA is not necessarily wasted in a combined analysis. However, our new results for Plethodon show that,
even with large numbers of nuclear loci, mtDNA may
still dominate a combined-data tree. Therefore, testing
for the congruence of mtDNA and nucDNA and the
impact of each data set on combined analyses is an
essential precaution.

Methods
Sampling of taxa and genes

We obtained DNA from 50 of the 55 currently recognized species of Plethodon [41], representing all major
clades and species groups previously recognized [e.g.,
[13,52,56,57]]. Most species were represented by a single
individual, but some geographically widespread species
were represented by up to four individuals. We also
included seven outgroup species, representing three
other plethodontine genera (Aneides, Desmognathus,
and Ensatina) and one genus of spelerpines (Eurycea).
Voucher numbers and localities are listed in Additional
File 3. GenBank accession numbers are listed in Additional File 4.
We combined mtDNA and nucDNA data from previous studies of Plethodon phylogeny [56,57,61] with
1884 aligned base pairs (bp) of new data from five
nuclear loci (572 variable characters; Table 5). First, we
used the third intron of Rhodopsin (Rho), with primers
developed specifically for use in Plethodon by K.H.

Kozak (pers. comm.). We also tested many other nuclear
introns from published lists for vertebrates [65-67], but
found only one intron (GAPD; glyceralderhyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) that amplified well and was variable among Plethodon species. Finally, we also tested
many loci (~22) from an Ensatina cDNA library provided by T. Devitt (pers. comm.). From this testing, we
found three more introns that could be amplified in
many Plethodon species and that were relatively variable
among species. Based on BLAST searches of the
sequences, these introns are associated with the nuclear
genes RPL12 (60s ribosomal protein L12), ILF3 (interleukin enhancer binding factor 3) and Mlc2a (myosin
light chain 2 mRNA). Primer sequences are provided in
Additional File 5. The length and variability of each
gene are described in Table 5.
DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved tissues
using the Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit. Gene fragments
were amplified using standard polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) methods. PCR products were purified and
sequenced using an ABI 3100 automated sequencer.
Sequences were edited using Sequence Navigator (ver.
1.0.1, Applied Biosystems) or ContigExpress (Vector
NTI build 175, Invitrogen). All sequences were initially
aligned using MUSCLE [68], and manually refined using
Se-Al v2.0a11 Carbon.
Prior to any combination of data from different
genes, we used parsimony (implemented in PAUP*;
[69]) to analyze each gene separately to identify any
potential contaminant sequences. Contamination was
hypothesized when two species had identical sequences
for a given gene, and potential contaminants were resequenced. However, sequences were not excluded
based on incongruence with previous taxonomy or
with other genes, to avoid biasing the results. Only
high quality sequences (i.e., few or no ambiguous
bases), without potential contaminants, were used in
the final analyses.
To these new data, we added 7035 bp of previously
published sequence data from three sources (Table 5):
(i) one nuclear protein-coding gene (recombination-activating gene 1; RAG-1), one nuclear intron (triose phosphate isomerase; TPI), and two protein-coding
mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b; cyt-b and NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 4; ND4) from Wiens et al. [57];
(ii) one mitochondrial protein-coding gene (NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 2; ND2) from Kozak et al. [56];
and (iii) two nuclear protein-coding genes (proopiomelanocortin; POMC and brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
BDNF) from Vieites et al. [61]. GenBank accession numbers for all previously published sequence data are provided in Additional File 6.
For all newly collected data, we used the same samples
from Wiens et al. [57] and thus were able to use the

Page 14 of 20

same individuals to represent each species across most
of the sampled mitochondrial and nuclear genes. For
the other genes, we combined data from different individuals into a single terminal taxon to represent a given
species. Combination of published data from different
individuals generally followed Kozak et al. [13], who
carefully combined data from Kozak et al. [56], Wiens
et al. [57], and Vieites et al. [61].
Phylogenetic methods

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted primarily using
Bayesian methods, but major results were confirmed
using maximum likelihood (see below). We performed
three analyses: all mitochondrial genes together, all
nuclear genes together, and a combined-data analysis of
all molecular data. The best-fitting model for each of
the five ânewâ genes was identified using comparisons of
the Akaike Information Criterion in MrModelTest ver.
2.0 [70]. Given that these five genes are introns (i.e., no
codons), we did not recognize partitions within these
sequences. For the other genes, previous studies [e.g.
[56,57,61]] identified best-fitting models and used comparisons of Bayes factors [71,72] to show that partitions
based on codon positions are supported for all proteincoding loci. Models and partitions used are summarized
in Table 5. Model parameters were unlinked between
data sets. We did not assess different substitution models for different partitions within genes given that simulations show that overly simple models may be
inappropriately selected when a small sample of characters is tested [73].
We conducted Bayesian analyses using MrBayes ver.
3.1.2 [74]. For each data set, we conducted two replicate
searches, each using four chains and default priors. Analyses for each data set used 6.0 Ã 106 generations, sampling every 1000 generations. For each analysis, we
assessed when stationarity was achieved based on plots
of log-likelihoods over time and on the standard deviation of split frequencies between parallel searches. In all
analyses, stationarity was achieved within the first 10%
of generations, and this value was used as the cut-off for
burn-in (trees from the first 10% were deleted). For each
analysis, the phylogeny and branch lengths were estimated from the majority-rule consensus of the pooled
post burn-in trees from the two replicate searches.
Clades with posterior probabilities (Pp) â¥ 0.95 were considered strongly supported [e.g. [75-78]].
Some taxa proved difficult to amplify for a given gene
despite repeated attempts and development of new primers. These taxa were coded as having missing data
("?â) in combined analyses. Simulations [e.g. [79-81]]
and empirical analyses [e.g. [63,80,82,83]] suggest that
taxa with missing data can be accurately placed in phylogenies regardless of their number of missing data cells,

Fisher-Reid and Wiens BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/300

especially when the total number of characters in the
analysis is relatively high (and the incomplete taxa contain sufficient non-missing data). For the combined
mtDNA and nucDNA sequence data (8919 characters
total), each species had an average of 34.75% missing
data cells, with a range among species of 0.16-72.71%.
As one example, the individual with the most missing
data, P. shenandoah-2, was placed with the other individual of P. shenandoah within the cinereus group in the
combined-data analyses with strong support (Figure 1),
suggesting that the most incomplete taxa were also
accurately placed in our study. For the sake of completeness, we included data from some nuclear genes that
were only sparsely sampled in previous studies (BDNF,
POMC, TPI), and we did not pursue additional sequencing of these genes ourselves (given that these genes
appeared to be relatively slow evolving). Simulations
suggest that adding genes with extensive missing data
should generally either increase accuracy in Bayesian
analyses, or else have no effect [83]. However, we
acknowledge that these sparsely sampled genes may
have less ability to help resolve conflicts between
mtDNA and nucDNA.
Another concern may be that missing data impact
estimates of branch lengths [but see [83]]. We tested
for a relationship between the % missing data in each
species and their associated, terminal branch lengths in
the combined-data tree using Spearmanâs rank correlation in R (i.e., if missing data consistently bias branch
lengths in some way, these terminal branches should be
significantly longer or shorter in species with more
missing data). We found no significant relationship (rs =
-0.15; P = 0.2288), suggesting that the amount of missing data had no consistent impact on estimated branch
lengths.
We also ran each analysis in RAxML ver. 7.0.3 [84,85],
conducting 100 heuristic maximum-likelihood searches
combined with 500 âfastbootstrapâ replicates. We used
the same partitions as in the Bayesian analysis, but with
the GTRGAMMA model for all partitions. This decision
was made following the recommendation of Stamatakis
[85]. Regardless of the initially specified model, the âfastbootstrapâ setting in RAxML uses 25 rate categories (i.
e. the GTRCAT model) to account for rate heterogeneity, instead of the usual four used to compute the final,
optimal likelihood. Thus, a separate parameter for invariant sites should be unnecessary. The combined-data
and mtDNA likelihood and Bayesian trees were nearly
identical to each other (98% and 92% shared nodes,
respectively). The nucDNA likelihood and Bayesian
trees were less similar, but still generally concordant
(78% shared nodes) and discordance was restricted to
nodes with weak support (e.g., bootstrap values < 70%;
[40]). Given the general similarity between Bayesian and

Page 15 of 20

likelihood results, we emphasize only the Bayesian
results for simplicity.
Analyses of support and congruence among Plethodon
data sets

We used these data to test the predictions that: (i) discordance between mtDNA and nucDNA will be uncommon and weakly supported by one or both data sets, (ii)
mtDNA will dominate combined-data trees given larger
numbers of variable characters, (iii) nucDNA will dominate combined-data trees due to lower homoplasy, (iv)
mtDNA and nucDNA will be more concordant on
longer branches, and (v) nucDNA will dominate resolution of the combined-data tree on deeper and longer
branches. Prior to conducting these analyses, outgroup
taxa were pruned from all trees, as was P. cinereus-4,
which lacked mtDNA data (otherwise, all taxa were
represented in both mtDNA and nucDNA trees). All
statistical analyses were conducted in R (ver. 2.11.1).
Given that for all comparisons either one or both variables were not normally distributed (based on a Shapiro-Wilk test), all tests used were non-parametric
unless otherwise noted.
We used the proportion of nodes shared between each
pair of trees (mtDNA + nucDNA, combined-data +
mtDNA, and combined-data + nucDNA) as our index
of similarity between trees, based on Rohlfâs [86] consensus index (implemented in PAUP*). We also tallied
the Bayesian support (posterior probability; Pp) for each
concordant or discordant clade (see below).
We determined if a given clade in the combined-data
tree was concordant or discordant with trees from separate analyses of mtDNA and nucDNA data. We also calculated the support value (Pp) for the concordant or
discordant clades. Each clade in the combined-data tree
was assigned a number (Figure 1) and its Bayesian support (Pp) was recorded. If the same clade appeared in
the separate mtDNA or nucDNA trees, it was listed as
supported by that data set with a given Pp. If a clade in
the combined-data tree was not present in either the
mtDNA or nucDNA trees, it was considered discordant
with that data set. The support value for these discordant clades was the highest Pp for any clade inconsistent with the monophyly of that combined-data clade.
We then tallied the total number of shared nodes, total
number of conflicting nodes, and, among those nodes in
conflict, which were strongly supported (Pp â¥ 0.95). We
also recorded which data set (mtDNA or nucDNA) the
strongly supported conflicts were resolved in favor of in
the combined-data tree. The number of variable characters in each data set was estimated with PAUP*. The
degree of homoplasy in each data set (mtDNA,
nucDNA) was calculated using the consistency index
(excluding uninformative characters) and the retention

Fisher-Reid and Wiens BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/300

index (both implemented in PAUP*), with lower values
for these indices indicating higher homoplasy. These
values were calculated on the combined-data Bayesian
tree. We recognize that these are parsimony-based estimates of homoplasy, but they nevertheless should capture variation in homoplasy relevant to all methods.
While we acknowledge that model-based measures of
homoplasy are potentially available, we are not aware of
such a method that would allow us to readily estimate
homoplasy for entire data sets of hundreds of characters.
Next, we assessed how concordance between mtDNA
and nucDNA in the combined-data analysis is related to
branch lengths. We assigned each branch in the combined-data tree to one of four categories: concordant,
mtDNA wins, nucDNA wins, and unique. Clades in the
combined-data tree congruent with separate analyses of
both mtDNA and nucDNA were categorized as concordant. Clades in the combined-data tree congruent with
the mtDNA tree but not the nucDNA tree were categorized as mtDNA wins. Clades in the combined-data
tree congruent with the nucDNA tree but not the
mtDNA tree were categorized as nucDNA wins. Finally,
clades in the combined-data tree not congruent with
either the mtDNA or nucDNA trees were categorized as
unique. Branch lengths from the combined-data tree
were used to determine the mean branch length for
each category, and the difference between the means of
each of the different categories was tested for significance using an exact Wilcoxon rank-sum two-sample
test (equivalent to a Mann-Whitney U test). We chose
to use âwilcox.exactâ (package: exactRankTests) over
âwilcox.testâ because many of our comparisons contained ties, and the exact test calculates an exact P-value
in the presence of ties.
We assumed that the branch lengths from the individual data sets and the combined-data tree generally
reflect the true underlying branch lengths of the species
tree. We confirmed that there is a significant correlation
between the lengths of branches for clades shared by
the mtDNA and nucDNA trees using Spearmanâs rank
correlation (rs = 0.53; P = 0.03), and between the lengths
of the shared branches in the mtDNA and combined
trees (r s = 0.96; P < 0.00001) and the nucDNA and
combined trees (rs = 0.73; P < 0.0001). We found similar
results across the other 13 clades (see below) and present these results in Additional File 7.
Finally, we assessed if the combined-data tree tended
to be resolved in favor of mtDNA or nucDNA at particular depths. We compared mean depth of clades
between the two clade categories, mtDNA wins and
nucDNA wins. We predicted that conflicts deeper in the
combined-data tree would be resolved in favor of
nucDNA, whereas conflicts at shallow depths would be
resolved in favor of mtDNA. Clade depth was initially

Page 16 of 20

estimated in two ways. First, we assessed the number of
nodes separating each clade from the root of the trees
(e.g., clade 6 in Figure 1 is three nodes away from the
root). Second, we summed the branch lengths (from the
combined-data tree) along the shortest path from the
root to the ancestor of the clade to estimate the path
length. For both methods, smaller numbers are closer to
the root and thus deeper, whereas larger numbers are
closer to the tips, and thus more shallow. These two
methods produced strongly correlated estimates of node
depth (rs = 0.74; P < 0.000001), and in all subsequent
analyses on additional data sets (see below) the first
method was used to compare mean depths across categories, and is referred to as the node depth index. The
difference between the means of each of the different
categories was tested for significance using an exact
Wilcoxon rank-sum two-sample test as described above.
Other vertebrate clades

We tested the generality of the results from Plethodon
by conducting identical analyses on 13 other vertebrate
clades: balistid fish [87], scarine fish [88], hemiphractid
frogs [89], hylid frogs [63], phrynosomatid lizards [90],
alcid birds [91], caprimulgid birds [92], cotingid birds
[93], dicaeid birds [94], emydid turtles [27], cervid mammals [95], and murid rodents from both the Philippines
[96] and Sahul (Australia and New Guinea) [97]. These
clades were selected in order to represent the major
groups of vertebrates and because they have relatively
large, matched mtDNA and nucDNA data sets (see
Additional File 8 for data on sampling of genes and
taxa, and original papers for other details). We acknowledge that these 14 clades are not a comprehensive sample of all vertebrates with published mtDNA and
nucDNA data. However, each clade required extensive
analyses and re-analyses (see below), and 14 clades
should be adequate to detect strong general trends, if
they exist (such as dominance of combined-data trees
by mtDNA).
For most clades, we ran (or re-ran) Bayesian analyses
to produce comparable combined-data, mtDNA, and
nucDNA trees, using the same methods described for
Plethodon. However, for emydids and phrynosomatids
we used the original Bayesian results. For phrynosomatids we used results from the reduced set of 37 taxa
(including Urosaurus bicarinatus), which have comparable data for most genes [90]. For hylids, we used the
smaller set of ~80 relatively complete taxa [63]. New
analyses were run for 3 to 20 million generations,
depending on the number of taxa in the data set. Any
taxa in these additional data sets that were missing all
of one type of data (e.g., missing all mtDNA) were
removed prior to the analyses. These and other minor
changes from the original methods are noted in

Fisher-Reid and Wiens BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/300

Additional Files 8 and 9. In theory, we could have done
these analyses using maximum likelihood also (or
instead), but many of these data sets were initially analyzed using Bayesian methods, and previous analyses of
these clades and our own experience strongly suggested
that likelihood analyses would yield very similar results.
The resulting trees were subjected to the same analyses described above for Plethodon. In addition, we
explicitly tested if mtDNA dominates combined-data
trees due to a larger proportion of variable characters
(prediction ii above), and if nucDNA dominates combined-data trees due to lower homoplasy (prediction iii
above). For (ii), we used the proportion of the total variable sites that are derived from mtDNA data, and for
(iii), we used an index of relative homoplasy (nucDNA
homoplasy - mtDNA homoplasy; using both the consistency and retention indices). We correlated indices of
these values with the proportion of nodes shared
between the combined-data and mtDNA trees (Rohlfâs
consensus index values) using Pearsonâs productmoment correlation (note that for this analysis, all variables were normally distributed). We also used multiple
regression (R package: stats; function: âlmâ) to test for
an interaction between homoplasy and variability of data
sets that may predict the proportion of nodes being
shared between combined-data and mtDNA trees, once
with the consistency index as our measure of homoplasy, and once with the retention index as our measure
of homoplasy.
Three additional analyses of the influence of node
depth were also conducted across clades. First, we tested
if the overall number of sampled study clades that followed the predicted pattern (nucDNA resolves deeper
nodes, mtDNA resolves shallower nodes) was significantly different from random using an exact binomial
test (recommended for n â¤ 25; [98]). In our case, the
three potential outcomes were assigned equal probability
and then lumped into two categories. The first category
is those outcomes agreeing with our hypothesis: (a)
nucDNA is favored deeper in the combined-data tree
(smaller depth index) than mtDNA (shallower: larger
depth index). The second category is those outcomes
not agreeing with our hypothesis: (b) nucDNA and
mtDNA are equally favored at a given depth (equal
depth index) in the combined-data tree; or (c) mtDNA
is favored deeper in the combined-data tree than
nucDNA.
Second, because sample sizes within each of the ten
clades were sometimes small (e.g., due to a limited number of cases in which nucDNA âwinsâ), we pooled data
across all clades. First, all node depths were standardized by dividing them by the shallowest node (largest
number) in their tree to get relative node depths for
each data set. For example, in the Plethodon combined-

Page 17 of 20

data tree (Figure 1), node 5 is two nodes away from the
root, while the shallowest node, 39, is 14 nodes away
from the root, and so relative depth for node 5, is 2/14
= 0.1429. These relative node depths for each category
(mtDNA wins, nucDNA wins) were pooled across clades,
and the difference between the means of the two categories was tested for significance using an exact Wilcoxon rank-sum two-sample test as described above.
Finally, we tested for a relationship between node
depth and branch length (given the possibility that
greater congruence on deeper branches might be
explained by deeper branches being longer). We tested
for association between the standardized relative node
depths for all nodes across all 14 clades and the corresponding standardized relative branch lengths using
Spearmanâs rank correlation. Relative branch lengths
were calculated similarly to relative node depths as
described above. A cladeâs branch length was divided by
the longest branch in the combined-data tree. For example, in Plethodon, the longest branch in the combineddata tree (Figure 1) is for node 2 at 0.0836. For Node 5,
the absolute branch length is 0.0296, and its relative
branch length is therefore 0.0296/0.0836, or 0.3541.

Additional file 4: GenBank accession numbers for new data
collected for this study. Sequences that are less than 200 bp (denoted
by *****) are not accepted by GenBank and are available from M.C.
Fisher-Reid upon request. Dashes (-) indicate that the sequence was not
collected for that individual at that locus.
Additional file 5: Primer sequences for new nuclear genes. Primers
for five nuclear genes (RHO, RPL12, Mlc2a, ILF3, GAPD) from which new
sequence data for Plethodon were collected for this study. Forward
primers are indicated by âFâ in the primer name, and reverse primers are
indicated by âRâ in the primer name. PDF file.
Additional file 6: GenBank accession numbers for previously
published data used in this study. Sources include: RAG-1, TPI, ND4
and Cyt-b data from Wiens et al. 2006. POMC and BDNF data from

Additional File 7: Branch length correlations among data types for
each vertebrate clade. For each clade, all branches shared between a
pair of trees (combined + mtDNA, combined + nucDNA, mtDNA +
nucDNA) were tested for correlation. Nearly all comparisons show
significant positive correlations in all possible combinations between the
lengths of shared branches among trees. The two clades that do not
show significant correlations in all combinations (dicaeid birds and cervid
mammals) have very small sample sizes of shared branches, making
detection of significant patterns difficult.
Additional file 8: Summary of data for 13 vertebrate clades.
Supplementary Tables S1-S13. Summary of data for 13 vertebrate clades,
including taxon sampling, length of gene, number of variable characters,
number of parsimony informative characters, the best-fitting model of
evolution, and the best-fitting partitions for each gene region. PDF file.
Additional file 9: MrBayes settings for additional data sets. All data
followed the phylogenetic methods used for Plethodon except for total
number of generations. The generations used for each data set that was
reanalyzed for this study are listed below. Emydid turtles and
phrynosomatid lizards were not reanalyzed because we had access to
the MrBayes output files from the original studies. PDF file.
