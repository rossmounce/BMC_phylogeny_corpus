Homopolymeric tracts represent a general
regulatory mechanism in prokaryotes
Renato H Orsi*, Barbara M Bowen, Martin Wiedmann

Abstract
Background: While, traditionally, regulation of gene expression can be grouped into transcriptional, translational,
and post-translational mechanisms, some mechanisms of rapid genetic variation can also contribute to regulation
of gene expression, e.g., phase variation.
Results: We show here that prokaryotes evolved to include homopolymeric tracts (HTs) within coding genes as a
system that allows for efficient gene inactivation. Analyses of 81 bacterial and 18 archaeal genomes showed that
poly(A) and poly(T) HTs are overrepresented in these genomes and preferentially located at the 5’ end of coding
genes. Location of HTs at the 5’ end is not driven by a preferential placement of aminoacids encoded by the AAA
and TTT codons at the N-terminal of proteins. The inlA gene of the pathogen L. monocytogenes was used as a
model to further study the role of HTs in reversible gene inactivation. In a number of L. monocytogenes strains, inlA
harbors a 5’ poly(A) HT, which regularly shows frameshift mutation leading to expression of a truncated 8 aa InlA
protein. Translational fusions of the inlA 5’ end allowed us to estimate that the frequency of variation in this HT is
about 1,000 fold higher than the estimated average point mutation frequency.
Conclusions: As frameshift mutations in HTs can occur at high frequencies and enable efficient gene inactivation,
hypermutable HTs appear to represent a universal system for regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes.
Combined with other studies indicating that HTs also enable rapid diversification of both coding and regulatory
genetic sequences in eukaryotes, our data suggest that hypermutable HTs represent a general and rapid
evolutionary mechanism facilitating adaptation and gene regulation across diverse organisms.

Background
The ability to adapt to different environments is critical
for all living organisms. Mechanisms of adaptation range
from rapid changes in gene transcription to stable
genetic changes that occur over an evolutionary time
frame. Phase variation is a specific adaptive mechanism
that typically involves a rapid switch between two different states (ON and OFF) to enable individual microbial
cells to vary expression of proteins. Bacterial pathogens
such as Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitides and Helicobacter pylori are examples of organisms where phase
variation, affecting the expression of flagella, fimbriae
and outer membrane proteins, has been well documented [1,2]. Phase variation has also been observed in a
number of non-pathogenic bacteria including Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans,
and Bacillus subtilis [3].

Regulation of phase variation can occur through multiple, different mechanisms, including homologous and
site-specific recombination events that generate chromosomal changes that activate or inactivate expression of a
gene [1], e.g., due to inversion of a promoter element.
Another effective mechanism for rapid phenotypic diversification among bacteria is through generation of
genetic diversity in regions of short sequence repeats
(SSRs), and, in particular in homopolymeric tracts
(HTs). Frameshift mutations in HTs can occur at high
frequencies and enable efficient and reversible gene
inactivation [4]. The high mutation rate in HTs results
from slipped-strand mispairing (SSM), which occurs
during DNA replication and causes insertions or deletions (indels) [5]. Indels in HTs located in coding genes
usually create a shift in the gene’s translational reading
frame, resulting in expression of truncated and often
non-functional proteins. In particular, mutations at the
5’ end of a coding gene usually lead to expression of

short, non-functional peptides. For example, the Bacillus
subtilis swrA gene, which is involved in swarming, is
phase variable due to a frameshift insertion in a poly(A)
HT between nt 20 and 27 [4]. In Campylobacter coli, a
deletion in a poly(T) HT at the 5’end of flhA has been
shown to be responsible for the phase variation of FlhA
expression [6]. In the human foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, frameshift deletions have been
observed in a 5’ poly(A) HT in the virulence gene inlA
[7]. This gene encodes the internalin protein, a virulence
factor necessary for internalization into human intestinal
epithelial cells and hence required for effective systemic
infection [8,9]. Although the 5’ frameshift mutation in
inlA seems to be more prevalent among food isolates, a
few human isolates have also been found presenting this
genotype [7,10-12].
To broadly probe for the distribution of HTs in prokaryotes and to gain further insights in possible regulatory roles of HTs, the coding sequences of 99
prokaryotic (81 bacterial and 18 archaeal) genomes were
scanned for the presence of HTs (for each of the four
nucleotides). Our data indicate that prokaryotes have
evolved to contain HTs within the 5’ ends of coding
sequences, probably to contribute to regulation of gene
expression (e.g., phase variation, reversible gene inactivation) as frameshift mutations closer to the 5’end of coding genes would more effectively abolish expression of
the full protein. Further functional studies in L. monocytogenes showed that the poly(A) HT located in the inlA
5’ end shows a high 6A to 7A reversion frequency,
which is about 1,000 fold higher than the estimated
average frequency for point mutations. Combined with
other studies that also showed high mutation frequencies in other bacterial HTs, our data indicate that hypermutable HTs appear to represent a universal system for
regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes.

Results
Poly(A) and poly(T) HTs with up to 7 bases are generally
overrepresented in prokaryotic coding genes

Analyses of the coding genes of 99 prokaryotic (81 bacterial and 18 archaeal) genomes showed that poly(A)
and poly(T) HTs ranging from 3 to 7 bases in length
were significantly (P < 0.05; Z-test) overrepresented in
the coding genes of most prokaryotic genomes evaluated
(Figure 1; Additional File 1). For example, poly(A) HTs
with 6 bases were overrepresented, in coding genes, of
70 of the 81 bacterial and 11 of the 18 archaeal genomes. As genomes with high GC content will have low
expected frequencies of poly(A) and poly(T) HTs with 8
or more bases, genomes with high GC content do not
show underrepresentation of poly(A) and poly(T) HTs
(see Figure 1). For example, the expected frequency of
poly(A) HTs with 8 bases for a genome with GC

Page 2 of 12

content of 70% and approximately 1.8 Mb of coding
sequence is close to 0.3; hence it would be statistically
impossible to detect an underrepresentation of poly(A)
HTs with 8 bases in this genome. The converse is also
true for genomes with low GC content, which will have
low expected frequencies of poly(C) and poly(G) HTs
with 8 or more bases. While a total of 22 genomes
showed no overrepresentation of poly(A) or poly(T)
HTs with 7 to 9 bases, there are no apparent common
features among these genomes. Briefly, these 22 genomes represent 12 bacterial genomes and 10 archaeal
genomes. The genomes include human pathogens (e.g.
Mycobacterium leprae and Staphylococcus aureus) as
well as fungal symbionts (i.e. Frankia alni) and nonpathogenic free living organisms (e.g. Kineococcus radiotolerans). In terms of genome features, the GC content
of these 22 organisms range from 33% to 74%, the total
length of coding genes range from 1,201,602 nt to
8,362,023 nt and the number of coding genes in each
genome ranges from 1434 to 7769.
While poly(C) and poly(G) HTs with more than 2 bases
were generally underrepresented in the genomes evaluated, poly(C) HTs with 7 and/or 8 bases were overrepresented in 11 genomes (Additional File 1) and poly(G)
HTs with 7 and/or 8 bases were only overrepresented in
9 genomes (Additional File 1). Among the genomes that
show overrepresentation of poly(C) or poly(G) HTs with
7 or 8 bases, only Thermus thermophilus has a GC content greater than 50% (%GC = 69.6).
HTs longer than 7 bases were generally not overrepresented among the coding genes evaluated, although
some exceptions could be observed. For example, coding
genes in 35 of 81 bacterial and 4 of 18 archaeal genomes
also showed overrepresentation of poly(A) HTs with 8
bases. Overall, 41 genomes showed significant overrepresentation of poly(A) HTs with 8 and/or 9 bases,
including Buchnera aphidicola, Borrelia burgdorferi, and
Chlamydia trachomatis, three of seven organisms with
less than 1000 genes in their chromosome included
among the genomes analyzed here. B. aphidicola and B.
burgdorferi also showed overrepresentation of poly(T)
HTs with 8 and 9 bases.
Among the archaeal genomes, only the Candidatus
methanoregula genome showed significant overrepresentation of poly(A) or poly(T) HTs with 8 and 9 bases
(Additional File 1). Wilcoxon tests on Z-scores for overrepresentation of poly(A) and poly(T) HTs showed that,
compared to archaeal genomes, bacterial genomes
showed increased overrepresentation of poly(A) HTs
with 6 to 8 bases (P = 0.024, P = 0.006, P = 0.009, for 6,
7 and 8 bases, respectively) and poly(T) HTs with 6 and
7 bases (P = 0.006 and P = 0.011, respectively). Furthermore, prokaryotic genomes of mammalian pathogens
showed significant overrepresentation of poly(A) HTs

genomes. Each bar represents one bacterial genome; genomes are sorted by increasing G+C content in the coding genes (a list of genomes in
the order displayed here is available as Additional File 5). Bacterial genomes are represented by white bars while black bars represent archaeal
genomes. Horizontal lines indicate ± 1.96 standard deviations (the cut-off for significant [P < 0.05] over or under-representation). Bars with Zscores > 0 indicate an overrepresentation, while Z-scores < 0 indicate underrepresentation of the HTs in the sequences analyzed. Vertical lines at

with 6 and 7 bases (P = 0.007, P = 0.011, respectively) as
compared to other prokaryotes (i.e. plant pathogens,
symbionts, invertebrate pathogens and free living
organisms).
As it is tempting to hypothesize that HTs may be
associated with specific functional gene classes (e.g.
pathogenicity factors, cell surface proteins), we also performed a preliminary analysis on the frequency of HTs
among genes representing different role categories
(available at [13]) in two model organisms, i.e., L. monocytogenes strain EGD-e and B. aphidicola strain Cc,
which presented overrepresentation of long poly(A) and
poly(T) HTs with highest deviations from the expected
values among the organisms studied. These analyses did
not show any clear pattern that would indicate that
some specific role categories would be associated with
overrepresentation of long HTs (Additional File 2). For
example, only L. monocytogenes genes classified as
“hypothetical proteins” or “regulatory functions” showed
an overrepresentation of poly(T) HTs with 7 bases,
while all role categories but “signal transduction” and
“protein synthesis” showed overrepresentation of poly
(A) HTs with 7 bases. No role categories showed overrepresentation of HTs with 8 or more bases in L. monocytogenes. Conversely, in B. aphidicola, all role categories
showed overrepresentation of poly(A) HTs with 7 and 8
bases and only “regulatory functions” did not show overrepresentation of poly(A) HTs with 9 bases.
Poly(A) and poly(T) HTs are located significantly closer to
the 5’end of coding genes, suggesting a role for poly(A)
and poly(T) HTs in regulation of gene expression through
phase variation and reversible gene inactivation

We hypothesized that if HTs evolved to contribute to
regulation of gene expression (e.g., phase variation,

reversible gene inactivation), selective pressures would
favor the placement of the HTs near the 5’ end of the
reading frame, where frameshift mutations would more
effectively abolish expression of the full protein. Therefore, the relative position of HTs (ranging from 5 - 10
bases in length) within a given coding gene was also
investigated among the 81 bacterial and 18 archaeal
genomes analyzed. As the number of bases in poly(A)
and poly(T) HTs increased from 5 to 8, the HTs were
located closer to the 5’ end of coding genes (Figure 2).
However, HTs > 8 bases as well as poly(C) and poly(G)
HTs were not located significantly closer to the 5’ends
of coding genes. To further assess whether the relative
locations of poly(A) and poly(T) HTs with 5 to 8 bases
were significantly biased towards the 5’end of coding
genes, we compared the observed number of a HT in
the first 10% of coding genes (using pooled data from
all genomes) against the expected number of the same
HT (in the same region) under the assumption that
HTs are uniformly distributed within a given gene. The
observed numbers of HTs in the first 10% of coding
genes was significantly greater for all HTs as compared
to the expected number of HTs (P < 0.001; Fisher’s
exact test). Moreover, the odds ratio of having an HT in
the first 10% bases of coding genes in the observed dataset as compared to the expected dataset generally
increases as the number of bases in the HT increases
(Figure 3).
Overall, poly(A) HTs with 7 and 8 bases were located
significantly closer to the 5’end of the genes in the genomes of mammalian prokaryotic pathogens as compared
to other prokaryotes (i.e. plant pathogens, symbionts,
invertebrate pathogens and free living organisms) (P <
0.001 and P = 0.047, respectively; Wilcoxon one-sided
test). Poly(T) HTs, on the other hand, were not located

Figure 2 Histograms showing the frequency of HTs in 20 windows each representing 5% of the length of the coding genes. (i.e., the
first bar represents the frequency of HTs in the first 5% of the coding genes) for (A) all 81 bacterial genomes and (B) all 18 archaeal genomes.
The data shown represent the frequencies among all bacterial or archaeal genomes (i.e., data for all genomes were pooled and not analyzed
separately for each organism). Statistical analyses indicate that longer poly(A) and poly(T) HTs are located significantly closer to the 5’end of
coding genes relative to shorter tracts (P-values from one-sided Wilcoxon tests are shown above graphs, e.g., P < 1 × 10-4 indicates that A6
tracts are located significantly closer to at the 5’ ends of genes as compared to A5 tracts [for bacterial genomes]); AAA and TTT codons were
also located significantly (P < 1 × 10-15) closer to the 5’ as compared to AAG and TTC, respectively.

closer to the 5’ end in the genes of mammalian prokaryotic pathogens as compared to other prokaryotes (P >
0.05; one-sided Wilcoxon test). Wilcoxon one-sided
tests also revealed that, compared to archaeal genomes,
poly(A) HTs with 5 to 7 bases from bacterial genomes
are located significantly closer to the 5’end of coding
genes (P < 0.001 for all HTs). Conversely, compared to
bacterial genomes, poly(T) HTs with 6 bases from
archaeal genomes are located significantly closer to the
5’ end of genes (P = 0.020).
While AAA and TTT codons are preferentially located at
the 5’ end of genes, the same is not observed for AAG
and TTC codons, which encode the same amino acids as
AAA and TTT

To test whether the positioning of poly(A) and poly(T)
HTs was associated with the placement, at the N-terminal end of proteins, of amino acids encoded by the
AAA or TTT codons, we analyzed the distribution of
these two codons as well as the distribution of the AAG
and TTC codons, as these pairs of codons encode the
same two amino acids, i.e., lysine (Lys, encoded by AAA
and AAG) and phenylalanine (Phe, encoded by TTT
and TTC). Analyses of the coding sequences from all 99
genomes tested here found that both AAA and TTT
codons are located significantly closer to the 5’ end of

the coding genes as compared to the AAG and TTC
codons, respectively (P < 1 × 10-15 for both, Wilcoxon
one-sided test; see Figure 2). These results suggest that
the location of poly(A) and poly(T) HTs closer to the
5’end of coding genes is not a consequence of a preferential location of the Lys and Phe amino acids at the Nterminal of prokaryotic proteins.
When compared to a randomly generated uniformly
distributed dataset of pseudo relative locations, Lys was
located significantly closer to the C-terminal ends of
proteins (P < 1 × 10-15, Wilcoxon one-sided test) than it
would be expected if the relative locations of Lys were
uniformly distributed. The C-terminal enrichment of
Lys can not be explained by the distribution of poly(A)
HTs as 39% of the Lys at the C-terminal are encoded by
the AAG codon and poly(A) HTs are located significantly closer to the 5’end of genes. We thus investigated
the location of all other 19 amino acids in all coding
genes of the 99 prokaryotic genomes and observed that,
in additions to Lys, Arginine (Arg) was also located in
the C-terminal of proteins. This C-terminal placement
of Arg was also statistically significant (P < 1 × 10-15,
Wilcoxon one-sided test using a comparison of the
observed data to a randomly generated uniformly distributed dataset of pseudo relative locations). As Lys
and Arg are similar amino acids (i.e., both are basic,

TTC, significant clustering of AAA and TTT codons in
the 5’end of genes was observed (P < 1 × 10-15 for both,
Wilcoxon one-sided test). Overall, these data suggest no
association between the positioning bias of HTs and
codon bias and thus indicate that the position of poly
(A) and poly(T) HTs within prokaryotic coding genes is
not driven by codon bias.

Figure 3 Odds ratios of having a poly(A) or poly(T) HT with a
given length in the first 10% of coding genes. Observed
frequencies for poly(A) or poly(T) HT (with length between 5 and 9
nt) located in the region encompassing the 5’ 10% of all genes
(based on pooled data for all 99 genomes) were compared to
expected frequencies (calculated based on a randomly generated
dataset created under the assumption that the location of the
respective HTs are uniformly distributed within coding genes). Y axis
shows the odds ratios, e.g. an odds ratio of 2.3 for an A9 tract
indicates that A9 HTs are 2.3 fold more likely to occur in the first
10% of a coding gene as compared to their expected frequency.
The lower limits of 95% confidence intervals for all Odds Ratios were
> 1, indicating that all poly(A) or poly(T) HT shown (i.e, those with
sizes between 5 and 9 nt) occur significantly more commonly in the
5’ 10% of genes in the prokaryotic genomes evaluated than
expected by chance.

large and acyclic) these data suggest that the C-terminal
enrichment for Lys is associated with the biochemical
characteristics of the amino acid itself.
Position of poly(A) and poly(T) HTs at 5’ ends of genes is
not associated with AAA and TTT codon usage

One possible explanation for a bias towards AAA and
TTT codons at the 5’ end of genes could be selection
for common (preferred) codons at 5’ end of genes to
improve translational efficiency and avoid ribosome stalling. We thus assessed whether the position of poly(A)
and poly(T) HTs was associated with codon usage patterns for AAA and TTT codons. Among the 99 prokaryotic genomes analyzed, AAA and TTT were preferred
codons (usage >50%) for 61 and 63 genomes, respectively. On the other hand, for 26 and 29 genomes, AAG
and TTC codons represented the preferred codons; in
these genomes AAG and TTC represented > 70% of the
Lys and Phe codons, respectively. Even among these
genomes with high preference for codons AAG and

To further investigate the role of HTs in phase variation
and gene inactivation, we used the facultative intracellular pathogen L. monocytogenes as a model. L. monocytogenes shows significant positioning of poly(A) HTs with
up to 7 bases closer to the 5’end of genes; A 7 HTs
occur with a frequency of approx. 0.45 HTs per coding
gene (Additional File 1). A 7 and T 7 tracts are also
located significantly closer to the 5’end of genes (as
compared to A6 and T 6 tracts, respectively; P < 0.001
and P = 0.002, Wilcoxon one-sided test) in the L. monocytogenes genome.
We specifically used a L. monocytogenes poly(A) HT in
the 5’ end of inlA as a model to investigate the mutation
frequency of poly(A) HTs. The 5’ inlA poly(A) HT was
previously shown to be polymorphic in L. monocytogenes. In one phylogenetic L. monocytogenes lineage
(lineage II) the 5’ end of inlA either includes an A7 HT,
which leads to an in-frame inlA, or an A6 HT, which
causes a frameshift mutation with a premature stop
codon after aa 8 [7]. Interestingly, all L. monocytogenes
isolates in lineage I characterized so far as well as some
lineage II isolates carry a “AAGAAAA” (A 2 GA 4 )
sequence (which leads to an in-frame inlA) instead of
an A7 or A6 HT [7]. Translational out of frame fusions
between the three different allelic variants at the 5’end
of inlA and kanR, a kanamycin resistance gene, were
created in L. monocytogenes FSL F2-640 (Table 1) to
investigate the frequency of frameshift mutations including the frequency of (i) A6 ® A7 and (ii) A7 ® A6, and
(iii) the frequency of deletions in A2GA4; in each case,
the mutation of interest would revert an out-of frame
kanR fusion to an in-frame kanR fusion that yields a
kanamycin resistance phenotype. In three biological
replicates, the strain carrying an A6 out of frame kanR
fusion showed between 4,600 and 35,000 revertants per
2 to 3 × 1010 bacteria, indicating an A6 ® A7 reversion
frequency of approx. 5.5 × 10-7 (based on an average of
three experiments; see Additional File 3). On the other
hand, only a single revertant was obtained in one of the
three replicate experiments with the strain carrying an
A7 out of frame kanR fusion, indicating a low A7 ® A6
reversion frequency (which can be estimated to be
approx. 3.9 × 10 -8 ; see Additional File 3). In three

Orsi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:102

biological replicates, no kanamycin resistant revertants
with a deletion in the A 2 GA 4 region were observed,
indicating a very low frequency of deletions (below
approx. 3 × 10 -10 ; see Additional File 3 for detailed
data).
The frameshift mutation in a poly(A) HT in the 5’ end of
L. monocytogenes inlA has at least two independent
origins

To further investigate the origin of the frameshift mutation in L. monocytogenes inlA, the DNA sequences
including the noncoding region upstream inlA as well as
the 5’ coding region of the gene from 106 L. monocytogenes isolates (Additional File 4) were used to probe the
phylogenetic history of this fragment in these isolates.
The frameshift mutation seems to have arisen at least
twice, independently, among L. monocytogenes lineage II
isolates (Figure 4). Interestingly, one of the clusters containing inlA sequences with the A6 allele (which results
in the premature stop codon) also contained isolates with
the A7 allele. In this clade, the only difference between
the inlA sequences with A6 HT and the inlA sequences
with the A7 HT was the single adenine indel in this HT.
Phylogenetic analyses of inlA sequences also showed
that all inlA sequences for L. monocytogenes lineage I
isolates (which predominantly represent serotypes 1/2b
and 4b) have an A 2 GA 4 instead of an A 7 (or A 6 )
sequence. Among the 79 lineage II isolates only 18 carried this A 2 GA 4 ; the other lineage II isolates carried
either an A7 (43 isolates) or an A6 (18 isolates) sequence
at this location. The 18 lineage II inlA sequences with
an A2GA4 sequence at the 5’ end formed five cluster,
including three clusters that were located within the
clade that contained all lineage I inlA sequences, suggesting that these lineage II isolates acquired this allele
from a lineage I ancestor through horizontal gene transfer followed by homologous recombination. The observation that the other inlA sequences with an A 2 GA 4
sequence at the 5’ end of inlA formed two distinct clusters within the clade that contained only lineage II inlA
sequences, suggests that these two clusters with an
A2GA4 sequence 5’ end of inlA arose at least twice independently, suggesting a strong selective pressure for this
change.

Discussion
Genome wide analyses on 99 prokaryotic genomes
(including 81 bacterial and 18 archaeal genomes) as well
as in-depth characterization of evolutionary history and
reversion frequency in a poly(A) homopolymeric tract in
L. monocytogenes inlA were performed to evaluate the
role of homopolymeric tracts as general regulatory features allowing for rapid gene silencing and phase switching. Overall, our data indicate that (i) poly(A) and poly
(T) homopolymeric tracts are overrepresented in prokaryotic genes and preferentially located at the 5’ ends
of genes, indicating selective pressure for presence of
these homopolymeric tracts consistent with their role as
regulatory elements, and (ii) poly(A) homopolymeric
tracts show high mutation frequency in L. monocytogenes and are used to selectively inactivate the virulence
gene inlA.
Poly(A) and poly(T) homopolymeric tracts are
overrepresented in prokaryotic genes and preferentially
located at the 5’ ends of genes

Our analysis of homopolymeric tracts in coding genes of
99 prokaryotic genomes showed that poly(A) and poly
(T) HTs with 3 to 7 bases are overrepresented in most
of these genomes while poly(C) and poly(G) tracts are
not. Interestingly, mammalian pathogens showed
increased overrepresentation of poly(A) HTs with 6 and
7 bases as compared to other prokaryotes (i.e., plant
pathogens, symbionts, invertebrate pathogens and free
living organisms). This may reflect the higher need for
phase-variable antigens among mammalian pathogens in
order to evade the host immune system [1]. For example, several H. pylori outer membrane proteins were
shown to be phase variable during murine infection
[14]. Additional putative targets of the mammalian
immune system were shown to be phase variable in
other pathogens, including Mycoplasma spp [15], Burkholderia mallei [16], and Bordetella pertussis [17],
among others. The only organism, among those analyzed, with overrepresentation of poly(A) and poly(T)
tracts with 8 to 10 nt was the endosymbiont B. aphidicola. Poly(A) HTs had previously been shown to be
overrepresented in the B. aphidicola genome, which is
extremely AT rich [18]. While frameshift mutations

were observed in several poly(A) tracts in B. aphidicola,
transcriptional polymerase slippage appears to generate
heterogeneous mRNAs for these genes, including a
number of mRNAs encoding in-frame proteins, suggesting that at least in some organisms frameshifts in homopolymeric tracts may not always fully inactivate gene
function.
Overall, our data also showed that longer poly(A) and
poly(T) HTs are located significantly closer to the 5’
ends of genes as compared to shorter tracts in prokaryotic genomes. As there was no association between the
location of these HTs close to the 5’ end of coding
genes and either (i) codon bias or (ii) placement of
amino acids encoded by AAA and TTT codons (i.e., Lys
and Phe), these data support the hypothesis that the
location of HTs at the 5’ end of coding genes was driven

by selection for DNA sequences that provide an effective
mechanism for high frequency mutations, which would
permit phase variation or reversible gene inactivation.
As the frequency of frameshift mutations tends to
increase as the HT length increases [19,20], longer HTs
located closer to the beginning of genes are likely to
allow for more efficient phase variation and gene inactivation as compared to shorter HTs.
Our hypothesis that homopolymeric tracts located at
the 5’ ends of prokaryotic coding genes provide a general mechanism for effective phase variation or reversible gene inactivation in the majority of prokaryotes is
also supported by a number of previous studies on specific organisms or specific genes. For example, in B. subtilis, frameshift mutations in a poly(A) HT at the 5’end
of swrA occur at high frequency, roughly 10-4 and 10-5

Orsi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:102

for a base pair deletion (9 to 8 bp) and insertion (8 to 9
bp), respectively [4]. A C. coli poly(T) HT at the 5’end
of flhA showed a deletion frequency of 3 × 10-4 (T8 ®
T7 ) and an insertion frequency of 7 × 10-6 (T7 ® T8)
[6]. In Mycoplasma hominis, a 5’poly(A) HT in vaa-2 is
associated with phase variation of the Vaa antigen. The
switching frequency between the Vaa+ (HT with 8 bp)
and Vaa- (HT with 7 bp) phenotypes was estimated as
10-3 to < 10-4 [21]. In our model, the L. monocytogenes
inlA 5’ HT, we observed a frequency of insertion of an
adenine in the A6 tract (A6 ® A7) in the order of 10-7,
while the frequency of an adenine deletion in this HT
(A7 ->A6 ) was lower, suggesting that mutation events
that lead to reversion to a full length inlA are more
common in this HT. Further examples of HTs involved
in phase variation include a poly(A) HT at the 5’end of
the Mycoplasma fermentans p78 gene, which encodes
the ABC transporter subunit p78 [15]. In this HT, deletion of one adenine in the 7-base tract was shown to
result in inactivation of the gene. Frameshift mutations
in a 5’ poly(G) HT in flhB from Pseudomonas putida
have also been described [22]. Interestingly, our data
showed that H. pylori is the only species in our dataset
with overrepresentation of poly(A), poly(C), poly(G),
and poly(T) HTs with 3 to 8 bases. Consistent with this
observation, there are many examples of H. pylori genes
that are phase variable due to indels in HTs [14,23-25].
For example, Tannaes et al. (2001) reported a poly(G)
HT involved in phase variation of H. pylori pldA, which
encodes the phospholipase A. This gene has been
shown to be phase variable during murine colonization
of the gastric environment by H. pylori [14]; gene inactivation occurs by insertion of a guanine in a 7 nt poly(G)
HT in pldA.
Poly(A) homopolymeric tracts show high mutation
frequency in L. monocytogenes and are used to selectively
inactivate the virulence gene inlA

As initial data have shown that a 5’ poly(A) HT in inlA,
which encodes the L. monocytogenes internalin A protein, shows frequent frameshift mutations that result in
a truncated and inactive 8 aa peptide [7,10], we used
this gene as a model to further probe the contributions
of HTs to phase-shifting and reversible gene inactivation
in bacterial pathogens. Natural L. monocytogenes isolates
have been shown to either carry an A7 , A6 , or A2GA4
sequence starting at inlA nt 6; while an A7 or an A2GA4
sequence at this location maintain an in-frame inlA
ORF, an A6 sequence at this location leads to the truncated 8 aa peptide. Although L. monocytogenes represents at least four phylogenetic lineages (i.e., lineages I,
II, III and IV) [26-28], A7 or A6 HTs have so far only
been identified in the inlA gene of lineage II isolates
(even though some lineage II strains harbor inlA

Page 8 of 12

sequences with an A 2 GA 4 at the 5’ end). All inlA
sequences for isolates representing other lineages (I, III,
and IV) were found to harbor an A 2 GA 4 sequence at
the 5’ location of inlA, which our data indicate represents a stabilized HT that shows a lower mutation frequency as compared to the poly(A) HT at this location.
The frequency of an A6 ® A7 reversion was estimated
as approx. 1,000 fold higher than the estimated average
point mutation frequency (i.e., 4.5 × 10 -10 [29]).
Although the experimentally observed reversion frequency from A7 ® A6 is not significantly different from
the lack of any revertants observed for A 2 GA 4 , our
population genetics studies clearly show that the deletion A7 ® A 6 occurred at least twice, indicating that
this mutation occurs in nature and is biologically relevant. Interestingly, while L. monocytogenes lineage I
strains are overrepresented among human disease associated isolates and lineage III isolates are overrepresented among animal disease associated isolates [30,31],
lineage II strains are overrepresented among foods and
non-clinical disease associated isolates, even though they
are regularly isolated from human and animal listeriosis
cases [30,31]. Hence it appears that disease associated L.
monocytogenes have evolved an inlA sequence that facilitates stable expression of this virulence gene, which is
essential for infection [8,32,33], while some generalist
strains (i.e., some lineage II strains) have evolved
mechanisms that allow for reversible silencing of inlA,
possibly during environmental survival or inside hosts
where inlA is not required (e.g., mice [34]). Interestingly,
some lineage II strains have acquired, through multiple
independent events, an A2GA4 sequence at the inlA 5’
end, possibly suggesting adaptation, of some clades and
strains within lineage II, to a more disease associated
lifestyle (consistent with a previous data that identified
human and animal disease associated clades in lineage II
[35]). These data suggest that evolutionary forces select
for presence of HTs in specific prokaryotic genes and
genetic lineages, possibly to facilitate adaptation to specific ecological niches and lifestyles (e.g., host adapted
life styles). As our genome wide analyses suggest broad
selection for presence of HTs and their location in the
5’ region of coding genes in prokaryotic genomes in
general, HTs thus appear to play important roles in
facilitating adaptation and gene regulation in prokaryotes. Future phenotypic and genetic studies will be
needed though, to clarify the biological relevance of
HTs in L. monocytogenes and other prokaryotes. For
example, even though L. monocytogenes showed a considerable number of genes with poly(A) and poly(T)
HTs, beyond our data reported here, no functional analyses of long HTs in L. monocytogenes have been
reported. In addition, none of the previous genome analyses in Listeria have included a comprehensive analysis

Orsi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:102
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/102

of frameshift mutations, even though one HTs in L.
monocytogenes flaR has been found to show evidence
for phase variation based on population data [36].

Conclusions
Based on our findings, we propose that HTs, particularly
those at the 5’ end of coding genes, represent a universal prokaryotic system that allows for effective gene
inactivation and phase switching. This system for gene
regulation is considerably slower than rapid transcriptional and translational mechanism of gene regulation,
but faster and more reversible than other chromosomal
mutational events. As an emerging body of evidence
also supports that HTs also enable rapid diversification
of both coding and regulatory genetic sequences in
eukaryotes [37,38], HTs appear to represent a universal
mechanism for mutational adaptation across diverse life
forms.
Methods
Homopolymeric tract search

The coding genes from 81 bacterial and 18 archaeal
completed genomes were retrieved from NCBI (Additional file 5). The 99 genomes were selected to represent
the phylogenetic and ecologic diversity of prokaryotic
organisms among genomes sequenced to date. We specifically selected the genomes studied here using the following criteria: (i) availability of a finished genome; (ii)
inclusion of widely studied pathogens (e.g., Salmonella,
Bacillus anthracis) and other widely studied organisms
(e.g., endosymbionts) (in order to allow others studying
these organisms to use our data); (iii) inclusion of only
one representative per species (with exception of two E.
coli and two L. monocytogenes genomes); (iv) representation of different groups of bacteria (i.e., Actinobacteridae, Alpha-proteobacteria, Aquificales, Archaeoglobi,
Bacillales, Beta-proteobacteria, Chlamydiales, Chroococcales, Clostridia, Dehalococcoidetes, Deinococci, Deltaproteobacteria, Epsilon-proteobacteria, Gamma-proteobacteria, Halobacteria, Lactobacillales, Methanococci,
Methanomicrobia, Mollicutes, Prochlorales, Spirochaetales, Thermococci, Thermoplasmata, Thermoprotei,
and Thermotogales); (v) representation of a wide range
of GC content (21% to 74%) and genome sizes (357 to
7769 coding genes). A list of the organisms used is provided in Additional File 1. All files were scanned for the
presence of single nucleotide repeats ranging from 1 to
20 bases in length using the program “dreg” implemented in the EMBOSS package [39]. HTs with 1 to 5 bases
were analyzed to allow for comparison to the longer
and meaningful HTs with 6 or more bases. It is unlikely
that HTs with less than 6 bases would allow for frequent insertions or deletions. To our knowledge, the
shortest HTs that have been found to be involved in

Page 9 of 12

phase switching or a similar variation is 6 bases long
(Stibitz et al., 1989; Gogol et al 2007; this work). HTs
identified by dreg do not overlap (i.e. HTs with 7 bases
are not counted within HTs with 8 bases). Codons were
scanned using the program “fuzznuc” also implemented
in the EMBOSS package.
Statistics used to evaluate overrepresentation of HTs in
the coding genes of a given genome

To estimate the expected number of HTs for each chromosome the following formula was applied:
E(H ik )  ( f i ) k  (1  f i ) 2  (N  ((k  1)n))  (( f i ) k  (1  f i )  2n)

Where:
i Î {A, C, T, G}
k Î {1, 2, ..., 20}; k is the number of bases in the
homopolymeric tract
fi = frequency of nucleotide i in the coding genes
N = total length of the coding genes
n = total number of coding genes
The significance of the difference between the
observed and expected values was assessed as the probability of observing a value as extreme as that observed
under the null hypothesis that the number of homopolymeric tracts follows a binomial distribution. A binomial
approximation to the normal distribution was used to
calculate the Z-score where:
Z  (HTOBS  HT EXP ) / StDev

A Z-score > 1.64 (P < 0.05, one-sided test) was considered significant when testing for overrepresentation
of a given HT.
Statistics used to evaluate location of HTs in different
gene regions

To assess clustering of HTs in different gene regions,
data on the relative location, within a given gene, of
HTs with a given length (e.g., T 7) were pooled, separately, for (i) all 81 bacterial genomes and (ii) all 18
archaeal genomes analyzed. Relative location of an HT
in a gene was defined as the absolute location (i.e.,
location of the first nt of the HT + the location of the
last nt in the HT/2) divided by the length of the gene.
One-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed
using R (version 2.5.0) to determine whether HTs with
a given length (e.g., T6) had relative locations significantly lower (i.e. the HTs located significantly closer to
the 5’ end of coding genes) as compared to the relative
locations of HTs that were one base shorter (e.g., T5).
The same general approach was used to investigate the
position of AAA, AAG, TTT, and TTC codons in different gene regions. In addition, we evaluated the

Orsi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:102
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/102

location of HTs in the 5’end of coding genes in different groups of organisms (i.e. mammalian pathogens,
bacterial organisms, archaeal organism) by pooling the
HT relative locations of all members of a group and
comparing it, using the Wilcoxon rank sum one-sided
test, against the relative locations for the same HT in
another group.
To assess if a given amino acid was located significantly closer to the C- or N-terminal of proteins, the
relative location of each amino acid was pooled among
all 99 genomes. A random dataset of uniformly distributed pseudo relative locations was generated for each
amino acid using the “runif” function in R. The randomly generated datasets had the same length as their
respective observed dataset. The observed data was then
compared to the randomly generated dataset using the
Wilcoxon rank sum one-sided test.
Odds ratios and Fisher’s exact tests were used to
assess whether the observed numbers of poly(A) and
poly(T) HTs located in the regions encompassing the 5’
10% of coding genes were significantly greater than
expected under the assumption that HTs are uniformly
distributed across the coding genes. A random dataset
of uniformly distributed pseudo relative locations was
generated for each poly(A) or poly(T) HTs with 5 to 8
bases using the “runif” function in R. The randomly
generated datasets had the same length as their respective observed dataset. The number of HTs falling in the
first 10% of the coding genes were then determined for
the observed and expected (randomly generated) datasets and Fisher’s exact test was used to compare
observed and expected counts.
inlA-kanR translational fusion construction

In order to evaluate the frequency of different frameshift mutations in a poly(A) HT in L. monocytogenes,
three different alleles of the promoter region and 5’
end of inlA gene were fused out-of-frame to the kanamycin resistance gene (kanR) using SOEing PCR. The
kanR gene was amplified from plasmid pDG780 [40]
and SOEing PCR was carried out as previously
described [41,42]. Constructs were introduced into the
inlA locus of EGD-e by homologous recombination as
previously described [43]. The three alleles used for
this fusions contained different poly(A) HT sequences
in the 5’ of inlA (starting at nt 6), including (i) an A7
HT, (ii) an A 6 HT, and (iii) an A 2 GA 4 sequence (see
Table 1). In these three fusions, an (i) A6 ® A7 insertion, (ii) an A7 ® A6 deletion, and (iii) a single nucleotide deletion in A 2 GA 4 lead to an in-frame kanR
construct. As a control, we also constructed a L. monocytogenes strain that contained an in-frame kanR fused
to the 5’ end of a inlA genes with an A 6 HT (see
Table 1).

Detection of mutation frequencies in inlA HTs using the
inlA-kanR translational fusion strains

L. monocytogenes kanR fusion strains (see Table 1) were
initially grown overnight in 5 ml of BHI broth without
antibiotic at 37°C. Subsequently, 50 μl of the overnight
cultures were inoculated into 5 ml of fresh BHI broth
and incubated at 37°C with agitation until cultures
reached mid-log phase (defined as on OD600 of approx.
0.4); 50 μl of this log-phase culture were inoculated into
5 ml of fresh BHI broth and incubated at 37°C with agitation. After incubation for 18 hours, appropriate dilutions of each culture were plated on BHI without
antibiotics (to estimate the total number of viable cells)
and BHI containing 150 μg/ml of kanamycin (to enumerate kanR revertants). Total viable counts were
enumerated after 24 h of incubation at 37°C. Kanamycin
resistant bacteria were enumerated using digital images
of the plates, which were acquired with a Q-Counter
(Spiral Biotech, Norwood MA)) after 28 and 48 h of
incubation. Colonies observed on these plates clearly
represented two distinct sizes, i.e., large and small colonies. The digital images were thus used for enumeration
of colonies, including classification of colony size (in
pixels [px]). Colonies with > 8 px were classified as
“large colonies” while colonies < 9 px were classified as
“small”. This classification was necessary as it was
observed that small colonies represented in their great
majority slow growing non-revertants (possibly due to
other mutations) while large colonies represented mostly
true revertants. To calculate the reversion frequency for
each fusion, the inlA fragment upstream of the kanR
gene was sequenced for all or a proportion of large
colonies; if < 20 large colonies were isolates in a given
replicate for a give fusion, all large colonies were tested,
otherwise at least 10 colonies were tested.
