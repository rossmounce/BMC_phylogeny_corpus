A next-generation sequencing method for
overcoming the multiple gene copy problem in
polyploid phylogenetics, applied to Poa grasses
Philippa C Griffin1*, Charles Robin1 and Ary A Hoffmann1,2

Abstract
Background: Polyploidy is important from a phylogenetic perspective because of its immense past impact on
evolution and its potential future impact on diversification, survival and adaptation, especially in plants. Molecular
population genetics studies of polyploid organisms have been difficult because of problems in sequencing
multiple-copy nuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method for sequencing a barcoded
mixture of targeted gene regions using next-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems.
Results: Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced three chloroplast and two nuclear gene regions (each
of which contained two gene copies with up to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60 individuals across 11
species of Australian Poa grasses. This method had high replicability, a low sequencing error rate (after appropriate
quality control) and a low rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent of the 320 gene/individual combinations
produced sequence reads, and >80% of individuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possible nuclear
alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability.
We applied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine Poa species, which we discovered to share an
allopolyploid ancestor with a group of American Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allele sharing among
the Australian species and so we recommend that the current taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected
hypermutation in the trnH-psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plant barcode region. Some
markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanian and mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic
structure was detected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which may be a result of restricted
seed flow and long-distance pollen flow in this wind-pollinated group.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that 454 sequencing of barcoded amplicon mixtures can be used to reliably
sample all alleles of homeologous loci in polyploid species and successfully investigate phylogenetic relationships
among species, as well as to investigate phylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generation sequencing method is
more affordable than and at least as reliable as bacterial cloning. It could be applied to any experiment involving
sequencing of amplicon mixtures.

Background
Polyploid species are numerous and economically
important. Cycles of polyploidization and diploidization
have recurred throughout the evolutionary history of
eukaryotes [1,2], such that many eukaryotic species possess more than the two chromosome sets expected in a
diploid. There are polyploid animals, fungi and protists

[3,4], but polyploidization has been especially prevalent
in flowering plants. The entire angiosperm lineage
underwent at least one round of ancient polyploidization
early in its evolution [2]. Many family- or lineage-specific polyploidization events have occurred since then
(examples reviewed in [5]), and most of our main food
and economic crop species are recent polyploids, including cotton, bread wheat, maize, potatoes, brassicas,
bananas, tobacco and coffee [6,7].
Polyploidization is often associated with genome plasticity. Chromosomal rearrangements, new transposable

element activity, DNA mutation, duplicate gene deletion,
gene expression and epigenetic changes are commonly
observed with polyploid formation [2,5,6,8]. Polyploidy
maintains higher levels of heterozygosity in a population, reducing the occurrence of inbreeding depression,
although mutant alleles accumulate in polyploid populations more quickly than in diploids [4]. Polyploids can
also adapt faster than diploids as long as beneficial
mutant alleles are not masked too strongly by wild-type
alleles [4]. Each polyploidization event combines genes
in novel ways, potentially producing a lineage with new
phenotypes, capable of surviving and adapting to environments outside the range of its parent lineages [5,9,10].
Thus polyploidization may be a vital mechanism for
adaptation to rapidly-changing environments, such as
those expected under anthropogenic climate change.
Practical difficulties have limited our current understanding of polyploid evolution, diversification and population dynamics. Nuclear DNA sequence is the most
informative data source for phylogenetic inference.
Haploid organellar sequence data can be useful, but
nuclear regions must be included to obtain multiple
unlinked markers. These are necessary where the evolutionary history of a lineage is complicated by incomplete
lineage sorting or hybridization, because a single marker
has a low probability of predicting the true evolutionary
tree [11-14]. Nuclear sequence data are often useful in
investigating complex evolutionary histories [15-17].
Since polyploids contain multiple distinct copies of each
nuclear gene, known as homeologues, it is usually impossible to amplify a homogeneous, single amplicon using
PCR. DNA sequencing by the Sanger method can only be
performed on a single pure amplicon. If more than one
copy is amplified with a particular PCR primer pair,
direct sequencing will give double peaks at sites that differ within and between homeologues, and the phase of
many such double peaks can not be determined. Furthermore, if there are insertion-deletion polymorphisms
(indels) that distinguish between the copies, then direct
sequencing will fail because all sites after an indel will be
undecipherable double peaks. The resulting practical difficulties with gene sequencing have been well documented [13,16,18].
Several approaches have been used to overcome this
problem, but all have drawbacks, in terms of the extra
time and cost associated with each method compared to
similar work in diploid or haploid taxa. Many researchers
have used bacterial cloning to separate gene copies
[17,19,20]. This is time-consuming and expensive, meaning that few individuals and few genes are investigated.
A single species is often represented by a single individual
[17,20,21], which may be adequate for investigating the
hybrid origins of species [20], but not for investigating
intraspecific variation. Comparisons based on individuals

may also lead to the wrong conclusion about the evolutionary history of related taxa, due to undetected incomplete lineage sorting and/or reticulate evolution [11].
Other researchers have designed primers specific to each
known homeologue of a multi-copy nuclear gene [16,22],
but this method requires extensive preliminary experimentation in poorly-characterized species [13,22,23]. It may
also be unsuitable for autopolyploids or some allopolyploid
genes for which good distinguishing primers cannot be
designed. In some studies, DNA is extracted from a mixture of individuals from a single population [24], but this
might not accurately estimate the frequency of alleles in a
population, as preferential PCR amplification may occur.
Here we describe a new method that uses the capacity
of next-generation sequencing technologies to sequence
mixtures of DNA rather than pure PCR products. We
sequence multiple gene copies, multiple genes, and multiple individuals in a single run, using barcoded samples.
Our method demonstrates the utility of 454 sequencing
for phylogenetic inference in a group of polyploid grasses
that seem to have evolved under a recent, rapid radiation.
It could be applied to any experimental design that aims
to sequence amplicon mixtures from many independent
samples.
Study species

Tussock grasses in the genus Poa (Poaceae) dominate the
alpine communities of the Australian Alps. These grasses
were initially lumped as Poa australis R. Br. or P. caespitosa Forst. f., despite variation in morphology and habitat
associations [25]. More recently, approximately 50 Australian Poa taxa have been described [25], about 12 of which
occur in the alpine and/or subalpine region [25,26]. The
genus Poa has long been regarded as taxonomically difficult [21,27,28] and even viewed as a massive polyploid
complex [29]. The taxonomy of the Australian alpine
species is also considered to be imperfect [25,26].
Initial results from a pilot study using microsatellite
markers, chloroplast non-coding DNA and nuclear
regions amplified in 25 herbarium specimens indicated
that these Poa species are tetraploid. This was consistent
with evidence from a previous study by Patterson et al.
[21] that found two copies of each of the two nuclear
genes analyzed in a range of Poa species, and with the
very common occurrence of polyploidy in the entire
grass family [9].

Results
Sequencing results

We submitted a mixture of three chloroplast and two
nuclear gene regions amplified in 61 Poa specimens
from 11 species for 454 sequencing. The Â¼ plate 454
sequencing reaction produced approximately 121,000
sequence reads. Read length ranged from 40 to 775 bp

(mean Â± 1 s.d. = 278 Â± 153 bp). Approximately 111,200
(92%) of these reads were successfully matched to one
of the gene region primer sequences (Figure 1A). After
barcode deconvolution and quality control 70,601 reads
remained (Figure 1B).
The barcode success rate was checked using a subset of
the rpl32-trnL reads. Of the 3,448 reads matching at least
one of the amplicon primer sequences, 2,732 exhibited
the desired amplicon primer + 3-bp barcode + checksum
base and so were matched to an individual. A further 656
reads failed to match the amplicon primer + barcode
sequence either because they were trimmed at the Adapter A end (through fragmentation after the initial PCR, or
through sequencing error) or because of sequencing
error(s) in the primer region. Only 60 reads (2.0%) were
rejected because of checksum base problems, and these
were usually because of a missing checksum base rather
than an incorrect base call. All mismatches were discarded during the barcode deconvolution process.
After quality control, sequence error rate was estimated
as the percentage of single-base mutations in the rpl32trnL region within individuals and was found to be
approximately 0.13% (see Methods). Despite efforts to
include equal amounts of PCR product for each chloroplast region/individual combination (and four times that
amount for each nuclear gene/individual combination),
read numbers varied across genes and individuals and
showed some species-specific patterns (Figure 1).

(Figure 1B). The resulting sequences are available in
GenBank [30] (accession numbers [HQ542308-HQ542469
and HQ594198-HQ594464]). Eight (21%) of the unsuccessful samples dropped out or showed very weak amplification (<4 ng/Î¼l product) at the PCR stage. The rest of the
unsuccessful gene/individual combinations appeared to
amplify successfully, but failed at the sequencing stage.
Most of these involved a chloroplast region and we suspect that they failed because insufficient PCR product was
included to ensure useful sequence reads. One sample (a
P. clivicola individual) produced no sequence reads for
any gene. This does not seem to be a barcode-related problem, because the same barcode was successful in another
experiment (CR et al., unpublished work). It probably
resulted from experimental error (for example, failure to
include this individual in the final amplicon mixture).
Achieving sufficient sequence reads

For the chloroplast regions, a single read per individual
provided sufficient sequence information, since these
regions were single-copy. For the nuclear genes, however, up to four alleles were expected per region (two
gene copies with up to two alleles each). Calculating the
number of reads required to obtain all existing alleles is
an example of the âInverse Coupon Collectorâs Problemâ
in probability theory [31] and was previously modelled
by Joly et al. [32]. We simulated the cases of two, three
and four existing alleles, assuming that all alleles were
amplified evenly, and repeated the simulation 10,000
times for each number of sequence reads (Figure 2).
These analyses suggest that at least 15 reads are needed
to be 95% sure that all four alleles are sequenced.

Individual success

Useful sequence (â¥1 read per individual) was obtained for
281 out of 320 (88%) of gene/individual combinations

Figure 2 Probability of observing all alleles for one nuclear
region vs. number of sequence reads obtained. 10,000 draws
with replacement were simulated for each sequence read number.
Black lines show the case of equal allele proportions where the true
allele number is 2 (dotted line), 3 (dashed line) and 4 (solid line).
Red and blue dotted lines show the case for the observed copy
proportions for CDO504 and DMC1 respectively. Grey vertical lines
show the read number required to observe all alleles with >0.8 and
>0.95 probability when 4 alleles are actually present.

We then wanted to check whether the assumption of
equal read proportions for each allele was justified. To
do this, we regressed the number of copy B sequence
reads against the number of copy A sequence reads for
each nuclear gene, with the regression forced through
the origin (0, 0). A t-test was used to discover whether
the regression slope (the B:A ratio) was significantly different from 1 for both nuclear genes. For the CD0504
gene the mean ratio of B copies to A copies was 1.87 Â±
0.23 (t 55 = 3.77; P < 0.001). For the DMC1 gene there
were also more B copies with a mean ratio of 1.29 Â±
0.11 (t 60 = 2.64; P < 0.01). Using these ratios in the
simulation algorithm we found that five to seven reads
were required to be 95% confident that both copies had
been sequenced (Figure 2).
Repeatability

The procedures were repeated (from the DNA extraction stage onwards) for three individuals (two P. costiniana and one P. hothamensis), with repeats barcoded
separately to test the accuracy and repeatability of the
entire process. The two repeated P. costiniana individuals showed identical alleles at the level of stringency
chosen here (â¥2 bp difference required to assign different alleles), except for one low-frequency extra DMC1
Copy A allele that was found in one individual but not
its repeat (Figure 3). On examination, this apparent
extra allele probably resulted from a PCR error as it was
identical to the other allele except for a unique 2 bp

insertion. For the repeated P. hothamensis individual,
one repeat produced consistently few sequence reads,
while the other sequenced well (Figures 1, 3). This was
probably due to a low-quality DNA extraction and poor
PCR amplification for the first repeat. These two repeats
differed by 3 and 2 bp for the DMC1 A and B allele
respectively, but the alignments from the first individual
were unreliable because they were based on only two
sequence reads each (Figure 3). In general, the method
was repeatable and accurate when a minimum of 2 bp
difference was required (out of approximately 400) to
assign different alleles.
PCR Recombination

PCR recombination was judged to have resulted in 302/
10,301 (2.9%) of âusefulâ reads for CDO504 and 614/
4,326 (14%) for DMC1. Examining a subset of suspected
recombinants in RDP3 [33] supported this judgement
(see Methods). At the individual level, recombination
frequency (mean Â± 1 s.d.) was 3.5 Â± 3.6% for CDO504
and 13.6 Â± 11.5% for DMC1 (Figure 3).
Polyploidy in nuclear genes

Two distinct copies of each nuclear gene were detected.
These were separated by 19 (4.0%) and 35 (8.5%) fixed
base differences for DMC1 and CDO504 respectively.
Furthermore, there were no shared polymorphisms
between the A and B copies for either homologue set. The
DMC1 copies also differed by a 7 bp indel and the
CDO504 copies differed by 4 indels 1 to 4 bp in length.
No recombination was detected among the two copies for
either gene, and the two copies were not in linkage disequilibrium (see Methods). For this reason they were treated as separately-evolving, unlinked loci. Poa annua was
the expected outgroup because it is native to Europe,
though it is now widespread in Australia. Two distinct
copies were also detected in this species and a single
P. annua copy was included in each alignment as an
outgroup.
Coding regions of the nuclear genes were either based
directly on GenBank matches (DMC1) or determined
using using Artemis and Artemis Comparison Tool
(ACT) software [34,35] on an alignment of corn, rice
and sorghum sequences from GenBank (GenBank:
226502914, NC_008396 and 239825523, respectively)
and representative Poa sequences (CDO504). Coding
regions were examined for synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, frameshift mutations or stop codons
that would render gene copies non-functional in some
individuals. Both DMC1 copies had few coding region
mutations (DMC1 copy A: one non-synonymous, two
synonymous; DMC1 copy B: one non-synonymous,
three synonymous). CDO504 copy A exhibited four
non-synonymous and six synonymous mutations in the

DMC1 results, the lower panel shows CDO504. For individual/gene combinations with <50 reads for that gene, the number of useful reads is
printed at the base of the column. Within each gene, the gene copies are referred to as âAâ and âBâ, and the alleles âA1â and âA2â, as per the text.

coding region. Overall mutations were rare among individuals for all four gene copies (Tajimaâs D <0, P < 0.05
for coding region and overall sequence).
Initially, CDO504 Copy B was detected to have more
than two alleles in most individuals, suggesting an extra
gene copy was present. Twenty-four percent of all Copy
B reads included a 57-bp deletion in the first intron.
This âshortâ allele was found in most individuals. These
alleles matched Copy B but such a deletion was not
detected in any GenBank matches. No secondary structure was detected and so this apparent allele was considered to represent a real gene copy, probably resulting
from duplication of CDO504 Copy B. This apparent
gene copy was excluded from further analysis but we
cannot rule out the possibility that some of the âlongâ
Copy B alleles may actually be reassorting at this locus.
Within the âlongâ Copy B coding region, three nonsynonymous and four synonymous mutations were
detected at low frequency (Tajimaâs D < 0, P < 0.05 for
coding region and overall sequence). Eight individuals
had CDO504 copy B alleles with exon insertions that
caused frameshift mutations, making the putative protein product non-functional. Since three of these individuals shared a 2-bp insertion, three shared a 5-bp

insertion and two shared a 32-base insertion, individualspecific sequencing errors were unlikely and these insertions were considered to be genuine. These frameshift
mutations may indicate a loss of function in this gene
copy.
To compare our results to those previously reported for
the genus Poa, we built a phylogenetic tree using a subset
of the Australian CDO504 copy A and B sequences
(spanning the diversity observed in each), along with
other Poa CDO504 sequences obtained from GenBank
(see Methods). All of the Australian CDO504 copy A
sequences fell within the well-supported sequence class
A (as defined by Patterson et al.), and all the CDO504
copy B fell within sequence class C (Figure 4).
Species differentiation

As expected, the three Poa annua accessions formed a
clear outgroup to the native Australian species for all
gene regions (Figures 5, 6, 7), and most of the parsimony-informative sequence variation distinguished
P. annua from the rest of the species (Table 1). Among
the Australian species, a total of 23 parsimony-informative base changes and 7 informative insertion-deletion
polymorphisms were detected in the chloroplast regions,

and a further 38 base changes and 18 indels in the
nuclear regions. By gene region, the chloroplast regions
exhibited between 1.8 and 2.7% parsimony-informative
variation among the Australian species, and the nuclear
regions 1.1 to 5.2%.
No clear, consistent species differentiation was obvious
from the genetic distance networks (Figures 5, 6, 7). Poa
gunnii appeared somewhat distinct with the rpl32-trnL
(Figure 5) and CDO504 B (Figure 6) markers, but was
significantly differentiated only from two other species,

and only in rpl32-trnL, by a pairwise FPT comparison (P.
gunnii vs. P. clivicola FPT = 0.39, P < 0.05; P. gunnii vs.
P. costiniana FPT = 0.44, P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Most P. clivicola samples clustered together for
both DMC1 A and DMC1 B (Figure 7), but not for the
other gene regions. For DMC1 B, P. clivicola was significantly differentiated from P. fawcettiae (pairwise FPT 0.22, P < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction) but not from
any other species. In general, genotypes were shared
by individuals of multiple species, and most species

comparisons.
Inversional mutations in trnH-psbA

The trnH-psbA intergenic spacer produced a very different network from the other chloroplast regions (Figure
5). The rectangular shape was caused by two small
inversions, a 6-bp region and a 2-bp region, which
occurred in all four possible combinations with no species-specific patterns. We suggest this is an example of
inversional mutation caused by hairpin secondary structure [36] (see predicted hairpin structure in additional
file 1 - Figure S1). The appropriate hairpin structure
was predicted using MFold [37], supporting this hypothesis. The same 6-bp inversion polymorphism was
detected in alignments of multiple Festuca and Lolium
sequences from GenBank. The 2-bp inversion region
was extremely polymorphic across many of the Poaceae
(see alignment in additional file 1 - Figure S1), and
showed intraspecific variation in Puccinellia, Festuca,
Deschampsia and Oryza. In fact, the entire putative hairpin region exhibited a high degree of variation.

Geographic structure

Two of the chloroplast regions, rpl32-trnL and rpoB-trnC,
showed evidence of spatial genetic structure. Significant
dissimilarity was seen at the 200 to 300 and 600 to 800 km
distance classes: this pattern disappeared when the Tasmanian samples were excluded, suggesting that the Tasmanian-mainland differentiation was responsible (see spatial
autocorrelation plots in additional file 2 - Figure S2). For
DMC1 A, low but significant dissimilarity was also seen at
the 200 to 300 km distance class (r = -0.077, 95% CI =
-0.027 to -0.105), which was strengthened when the Tasmanian samples were excluded (r = -0.089, 95% CI =
-0.040 to -0.129). This was not explained by geographic
source population (see Methods): no pair of populations
was significantly differentiated (AMOVA P > 0.05 after
Bonferroni correction).
At a smaller spatial scale, no genetic structure was
detected using the nuclear markers, but significant positive structure was detected between 0 to 60 km for
rpl32-trnL (falling to 0 to 30 km when Tasmanian samples were excluded) and 0 to 20 km for rpoB-trnC (see
additional file 2 - Figure S2).

Discussion
Utility of next-generation sequencing

Phylogenetic analysis of polyploid species has typically
been problematic, requiring large amounts of time and
effort to sequence multiple gene copies in sufficient
individuals using traditional Sanger sequencing and
bacterial cloning [13,16,18]. However, high-throughput
ânext-generation sequencingâ of barcoded DNA mixtures is an affordable and successful solution to this
problem. This effectively-clonal PCR method is financially viable for any type of mixed DNA sample. Nextgeneration methods involving sample barcoding have
already been applied to a wide variety of bacterial, fungal and mixed environmental samples [for example 38,
39], and to multi-copy genes [40], but not to individual
taxa containing a mixture of alleles, like polyploids or
diploid heterozygotes, though the idea has been suggested [41].

In this project we have designed simple barcodes fused
to the sequencing adaptors, a different method from
those previously suggested [42]. Commercial sequencing
facilities typically offer amplicon barcoding using the 10bp âmultiplex identifiersâ suggested by Roche [43]. These
services can be expensive, and only 14 multiplex identifiers are available [43], limiting the number of samples.
The barcode-adapter ligation protocol we describe here
is relatively cheap and easy to implement. When sequencing an amplicon mixture, the level of barcode accuracy
required is lower than that for other applications (genome sequencing projects, for example [44]) because individual reads with barcode sequencing errors will be
detected and discarded in the alignment process. Thus,
we suggest that simple 3 to 5 bp barcodes will be sufficient for most phylogenetic analyses. Their short length
should prevent them from interfering with any stage of
the amplification/sequencing process, especially if ligated

after the initial PCR step. Longer barcodes could be
designed to identify mixtures of more than the 61 individuals we examined here. Instead of attaching barcodes to
the sequencing adapters as we did, it may be more sensible in some cases to synthesise PCR primers with built-in
barcodes. In that case, barcoding power could be
increased by using both barcoded forward and reverse
PCR primers, but this would restrict the length of the
sequenced regions, as each region would only be
sequenced in one direction. Similar barcodes should also
be suitable for other next-generation sequencing methods although distinguishing homeologues may be more
difficult with shorter sequence reads such as those produced using the Illumina method. With some creativity
and careful study design, appropriate barcodes can be
developed to suit any situation.
Researchers accustomed to dealing with individual
DNA chromatograms may feel overwhelmed by the
large volume of data obtainable from a next-generation
sequencing run. However, barcode deconvolution and
quality control using the methods we describe here was
quick. The entire workflow was completed in under an
hour for each gene region. The time bottleneck actually
occurred at the alignment and editing stage, which uses
the same skills needed for âtraditionalâ molecular taxonomy, except that it is applied to larger numbers of
sequences.
Sequence success and repeatability

Despite efforts to mix equal amounts of DNA for each
individual combination, there were significant differences between initial read numbers between different
species. Since we were not interested in the relative
abundance of different PCR products, but rather in
sequencing all alleles that were present in each individual for each gene, this was not a problem. Drop-out
rate was 12%, comparable to traditional sequencing
methods using multiple markers [45]. Since we were
able to sequence many more individuals than usual for a
phylogenetic analysis, the occasional gene dropout for
an individual did not affect our overall results.
Assuming 4 alleles were present at equal frequency in
an individual, only 15 sequence reads were required to
have a 95% chance of observing all 4 alleles (Figure 2)
[32]. This was achieved for 54/64 individuals for
CDO504 and 52/64 individuals for DMC1 (Figure 1).
Much lower read counts were required to observe all
distinct alleles if only two or three alleles were present
per individual (Figure 2). This is in broad agreement
with the 20 to 40+ clones recommended for sequencing
multiple-copy nuclear genes using bacterial cloning [13].
However, we found significantly higher read numbers of
copy B in both nuclear genes (copy B read no. 1.9 Ã
copy A for CDO504, 1.2 Ã copy A for DMC1). This was

Page 10 of 18

despite efforts to reduce preferential amplification as
suggested by Small et al. [13]. Five and seven sequence
reads were needed to be confident of obtaining both
copies in DMC1 and CDO504, respectively (Figure 2,
red and blue lines), which was achieved in 58/64
samples for DMC1 and 54/64 samples for CDO504
(Figure 1).
We argue that the 454 sequencing method is more
reliable than bacterial cloning for several reasons. First,
cloning bias is avoided. Second, in Sanger sequencing,
PCR errors that occur early in the reaction are propagated through later cycles, but this should not occur in
next-generation sequencing because the sequencing
reaction is performed on individual DNA molecules.
Therefore sequencing errors are easier to detect in nextgeneration sequencing read alignments. Third, it is
much easier to achieve the required numbers of
sequence reads to obtain all alleles: in the past, researchers have often relied on far fewer clones than the 20 to
40+ recommended [19,22,46] and so missing alleles may
be an issue in many phylogenetic studies, especially if
preferential copy amplification is common.
PCR-based in vitro recombination is often observed in
reactions with multiple templates [13,19]. We suspect
that most of the PCR recombination we observed
occurred in the initial PCR step [21], although it could
have also occurred in the adapter-extension PCR step.
However, the recombinant alleles were readily identified.
DMC1 showed a higher proportion of recombinant
sequences than did CDO504 (13.6% vs 2.9%). We have
no clear explanation for this difference.
Allopolyploidy in the Australian alpine Poa species

Two distinct gene copies were observed for each nuclear
gene, differing by 4% and 8.5% (CDO504 and DMC1,
respectively). As there was no evidence of recombination
between them, we treated them as separately-evolving
gene copies. This treatment is appropriate for polyploids.
It is thought that homeologues do pair at meiosis in
recent autopolyploids, but that most stable polyploid taxa
become functionally diploid over time, meaning that
gene copies from different ancestral genomes do not
recombine [47]. As these Poa species seem to be functionally diploid, we would argue that they are relatively
âoldâ polyploids. This idea is supported by the fact that
the same, identifiable gene copies were identified in all of
the native Australian species examined, suggesting that
they all evolved from a common allopolyploid ancestor.
Indeed, a previous study of some Poa species at the
genus level found two distinct CDO504 copies of P. sieberiana, the only Australian species included in the study
[21]. Our findings support this classification, with all of
our Australian CDO504 copy A falling within sequence
class A (as defined by Patterson et al.) and CDO504 copy

Griffin et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/19

B falling within sequence class C (Figure 4). Each of these
sequence classes also contained P. arctica, P. nervosa,
P. fendleriana, P. iridifolia and P. arachnifera, which are
mostly restricted to North or South America (P. arctica
is also found in the European Arctic) [48]. Two Australian/New Zealand species were also placed with some of
these American species in an earlier study using chloroplast restriction site data [27]. The diploid progenitors of
this Australian/American Poa group remain to be identified. The lack of resolution within these clades (Figure 4)
means we cannot yet determine the geographic pattern
of colonization, though it may be similar to that proposed
for a related group of grasses, the New Zealand Loliinae,
involving long-distance dispersal from North America to
New Zealand via South America [49], followed by dispersal to Australia. We can state with confidence, however,
that the Australian alpine species have not undergone
polyploidization since colonization of the Alps, but that a
polyploidization event took place before the Australian
and the American species diverged.
Gene copies resulting from polyploidization often take
on distinct functions or lose function [50]. Here we
detected very few non-synonymous or synonymous
mutations in the coding region of either DMC1 copy or
CDO504 copy A, indicating that these three loci are
probably still functional. Tajimaâs D was significantly
negative in the introns of all four loci, indicating an
excess of rare polymorphisms. This could have resulted
from sequencing errors, a selective sweep or a recent
population expansion. Sequencing error is unlikely to
explain the large number of rare mutations we observed,
because our method had a low (0.13%) error rate after
quality control, and individual alleles were represented
by many sequence reads. We suggest that population
expansion is the most likely explanation, either expansion after the ancestral hybridization event, or expansion
to colonize the ânewâ environment of Australia. Sequencing this gene in the related New Zealand and American
species would help to resolve this issue.
CDO504 copy B showed a different pattern, possessing
several frameshift mutations that may render the protein
product non-functional. This may indicate a loss of
function in copy B, although every individual with an
apparently non-functional allele also possessed a functional allele. There was also evidence of probable gene
duplication in this copy: an allele with a 57-bp intron
gap was present in most individuals, but as the gene
dynamics were unclear, these alleles were excluded.
Inversional mutation in trnH-psbA

Inversional mutation [36] explains the unusual rectangular network pattern in the trnH-psbA region and this
mutation mechanism seems to have occurred throughout the grass family [see additional file 1 - Figure S1].

Page 11 of 18

TrnH-psbA inversions have been reported for other
angiosperm families [51-54] but not for grasses, probably because trnL-trnF and other loci are more widely
used as phylogenetic markers in the grass family
[55-57]. Also, grass phylogenies that have used this marker but only included one individual per species or
genus [58,59] would necessarily fail to observe intrataxon variation. TrnH-psbA has been proposed as a
general DNA barcode region for land plants [60]. Our
results support the argument that trnH-psbA is unsuitable as a barcode region because of its apparent propensity to inversion mutations [51].
Species and geographic structure

The general pattern seen from both the chloroplast and
the nuclear genes is one of extensive haplotype sharing
between what are currently considered to be different
species (Figures 5, 6, 7). The nuclear gene networks
showed incongruence both with each other and with
the chloroplast gene networks. Nuclear-organellar
incongruence is common [18,20,46,61]; incongruence
between nuclear genes is less widely reported, but does
occur [22]. Both can result from incomplete lineage
sorting or hybridization. Either of these processes could
be occurring in the Australian alpine Poa species. They
may well have resulted from a recent, rapid species
radiation maintaining high effective population size, a
typical scenario in incomplete lineage sorting [14,62].
Hybridization is also commonly reported within the
genus Poa [27,28,63-65] and the entire grass family [9].
Experimental inter-species crosses between some of the
species examined did produce viable offspring (Griffin,
unpublished). Further work will attempt to distinguish
between incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization
as an explanation for the lack of species structure
observed.
Some geographic pattern was revealed, with Tasmanian
samples sharing a distinct clade in the rpl32-trnL and the
CDO504 B networks, although some mainland samples
also shared this clade in each case. The Tasmania-mainland differentiation was also detected in the spatial autocorrelation analysis, with significant genetic dissimilarity
detected between pairs of individuals 500 to 900 or 700
to 900 km apart (in the markers rpl32-trnL and CDO504
A, respectively) that disappeared when the Tasmanian
samples were removed from the analysis [see additional
file 2 - Figure S2 A-B]. Although Tasmania was connected to the mainland as recently as 17,000 years ago at
the last glacial maximum [66], similar divergence has
been noted in a wide range of species [67-69]; in other
species, genetic groups span the Bass Strait divide
[70-72]. The low but significant spatial genetic differentiation at 200 to 300 km noted with the DMC1 copy A
marker was not explained by geographic clusters

Griffin et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/19

reflecting the source mountain range or broad geographic area and may be a chance result due to sampling
bias.
On the local scale, fairly strong spatial genetic structure
was detected using two of the chloroplast markers.
Rpl32-trnL found significantly similar genotypes up to
60 km apart, which decreased to 30 km apart when the
Tasmanian samples were excluded [see additional file 2 Figure S2 E-F]. RpoB-trnC, which had less genetic variation overall (Table 1), revealed spatial genetic similarity
in neighbourhoods of up to 20 km with or without the
Tasmanian samples [see additional file 2 - Figure S2
G-H]. No significant local-scale genetic structure was
detected with the nuclear markers. Because the chloroplast is maternally inherited in most angiosperms, these
results suggest a smaller neighborhood for seed dispersal
than for pollen dispersal. The Australian alpine zone
occurs across small, relatively isolated âsky islandsâ, and
strong spatial genetic structure has been detected in Australian alpine and montane lizards [70,73,74]. However, it
is perhaps not surprising that these alpine grasses lack
spatial genetic structure with nuclear markers: they are
wind-pollinated, and high population connectivity has
been documented in one Poa species across mountaintops approximately 8 kilometres apart [75].

Conclusions
We developed a novel method of barcoding amplicon
mixtures from polyploid individuals for 454 sequencing.
We successfully sequenced multiple nuclear genes, each
with multiple copies and multiple alleles, and also
sequenced three single-copy chloroplast regions, all in
64 individuals representing 11 species. This method had
high replicability, a low error rate after quality control
and a low rate of missing data (88% of the 320 gene/
individual combinations produced sequence reads). This
method is cheaper than and at least as reliable as bacterial cloning. It could be applied to any experiment
involving sequencing of amplicon mixtures.
We applied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine Poa species, which were discovered to
have an allopolyploid ancestor in common with a group
of American Poa species. Alleles and haplotypes were
shared extensively between the Australian âspeciesâ and
little inter-species differentiation was detected, though
the Tasmania and mainland samples were somewhat
distinct. Significant spatial genetic structure was
detected at <100 km spatial scales using chloroplast but
not nuclear markers, indicating smaller seed than pollen
neighborhoods. More work is necessary to distinguish
incomplete lineage sorting from hybridization in this
seemingly recently-evolved group, but we can recommend that the current taxonomy be re-examined, as we

Page 12 of 18

found little evidence to support current species
concepts.

Methods
Sampling and DNA extraction

Herbarium specimens were examined at the Australian
National Herbarium, Canberra, Australia (CANB). Eleven species were chosen, with a total of 61 specimens
sampled (Table 2). Specimens sampled had been collected later than 1970, identified to the species or variety
level by experienced taxonomists, and with large
amounts of well-preserved leaf tissue from a single
plant. A small amount of leaf tissue (1/2 to 5 leaves
depending on plant size) was removed. In the laboratory, approximately 20 mg of leaf tissue was added to a
1.5 ml Eppendorf tube with two glass beads (3 mm diameter). DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturerâs protocol, grinding leaf tissue in a Mixermill
(Retsch MM300) and eluting in a total volume of 200
Î¼l. Duplicate samples of three herbarium specimens
were included from the DNA extraction stage onwards,
bringing the total number of samples to 64.
Initial PCR and amplicon pooling

The program Primer3 [76] was used to design primers for
amplifying regions 400 to 450 bp in length from the
nuclear regions DMC1 and CDO504, and the following
chloroplast regions: rpl32-trnL, rpoB-trnC and trnH-psbA.
The maximum sequence length for this study was limited
to approximately 500 bp as recommended by Roche [43].
Primers were designed based on initial sequence alignments gained from a trial panel of 25 individual herbarium
specimens [see additional file 3 - Table S1]. These had
been obtained using primers designed by Patterson et al.
[21] (CDO504), Petersen and Seberg [77] (DMC1, primers
TDMC1e10 and TDMC1e15R), Shaw et al. [78] (trnHpsbA and rpoB-trnC), and Shaw et al. [79] (rpl32-trnL)
(results not reported here). For all PCR amplifications, 2 Ã
BIO-X-ACTâ¢ Short Mix (Bioline, London, England) containing enzyme, buffer, dNTPs and 2.0 mM MgCl2 was
used in 20 Î¼l reactions. Primers (0.8 Î¼M each primer),
template (2 Î¼l extracted DNA for nuclear amplifications, 2
Î¼l 1/10-diluted extracted DNA for chloroplast amplifications) and MgCl2 [see additional file 3 - Table SI] were
added and the volume made up to 20 Î¼l with 2 Ã PolyMate Additive (Bioline, London, England). The basic PCR
protocol was as follows: 96Â°C for 5 minutes; 40 cycles of
96Â°C for 40 seconds, 50Â°C for 60 seconds, 72Â°C for 40 seconds; 72Â°C for 5 minutes; 15Â°C hold. Variations from this
protocol for each marker are shown in additional file 3 Table S1. For the nuclear genes, three PCR reactions were
pooled for each sample/marker combination to avoid

to a ladder (HyperLadderâ¢ II, Bioline, London, England).
For the chloroplast regions, 25 ng of each PCR product
was pooled for each individual. 100 ng of each nuclear
region was added, because we wanted to represent each of
the four possible amplicons equally in the final mixture.
Barcoded amplicon library creation

To avoid synthesizing a composite amplicon primer-barcode-adapter fusion primer, for every gene Ã individual
combination [42,43], which would have been prohibitively
expensive, a ligation reaction was performed to add barcode sequences to the pooled amplicons. The barcodes
comprised the GS FLX Adapter A (5ââCGTATCGCCT
CCCTCGCGCCATCAGâ3â) with a 3-bp barcode
sequence at the 3â end as in [44] followed by a checksum
base and an extra T to facilitate sticky-ended ligation (Figure 8). The checksum base was included to detect sequencing errors in the barcode region, such that the barcodes
occupied only 64/256 possible 4-bp-long combinations of
the four bases. The reverse complement of this Adapter
A-barcode oligonucleotide was also present. Adapter B
(5ââCTGAGCGGGCTGGCAAGGCGCATAGâ3â) was a
non-barcoded, non-biotinylated oligonucleotide identical
to that used in the current GS FLX Titanium Lib-L
sequencing chemistry [80]. To make the barcodes double-

stranded, equimolar mixtures in ligase buffer (BioLine,
London, England) of the forward and reverse-complement
oligonucleotides (each 20 Î¼M) were subjected to 95Â°C for
3 minutes and allowed to cool to room temperature.
Barcodes were ligated onto the amplicons using a
standard ligation reaction as follows. The amplicon mixture for each individual was purified using an Illustra
GLX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK, 2008 version). The purified product was quantified using a NanoDrop 1000
Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE,
USA).100 ng of the pooled amplicon mixture, doublestranded Adapter A-barcode and double-stranded Titanium Adapter B (0.25 Î¼M each), 5 U T4 polynucleotide
kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 20
cohesive end units T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and 10 Ã T4 ligase buffer were
combined in a 40 Î¼l ligation reaction. This mixture was
subjected to 37Â°C for 1 hour, followed by 10 cycles of
22Â°C for 1 hour, then placed at 14Â°C for 1 hour, and 65Â°
C for 20 minutes before being brought to room temperature. The desired ligation product was flanked by
the Adapter A-barcode oligonucleotide on one end and
the double-stranded Titanium Adapter B on the other
end (Figure 8). Some products would have formed with
either Adapter A-barcode or Adapter B on both ends;
these would be removed automatically later in the process, in the Enrichment step described in the Roche GS

3â, to match exactly with the current Titanium chemistry
(Figure 8). PCR protocol was as follows: 96Â°C for 5 minutes; 10 cycles of 96Â°C for 30 seconds, 53Â°C for 30 seconds,
72Â°C for 45 seconds; 72Â°C for 5 minutes; 15Â°C hold. By
designing barcode oligonucleotides to match exactly the
current sequencing chemistry, researchers should be able
to avoid this step.
After the PCR extension step, the amplicon mixtures
were pooled in equal amounts. The resulting barcoded
amplicon library (approximately 630 ng of DNA) was
purified again using the PCR Purification Kit (Scientifix,
Clayton, Victoria, Australia) to remove PCR primers and
sequenced using the GS FLX Titanium chemistry (Lib-L;
Roche, Basel, Switzerland). A Â¼ plate run was performed
following appropriate quality control and sample preparation carried out by the Australian Genome Research
Facility (AGRF), Brisbane, Australia.

A from ligation
Figure 8 Diagram of barcoded amplicon. The amplicon of
interest, flanked by forward and reverse PCR primer sequences, was
subjected to ligation of the Titanium Adapter B and Adapter A +
barcode sequence, producing an oligonucleotide of the form
shown. One out of 64 barcode + check-sum base sequences is
represented here. Initially, the Adapter A oligonucleotide used was 6
bp shorter at the 5â end. It was extended by PCR to match the
Titanium sequence shown here, as described in the text.

FLX Titanium emPCR Method Manual [80]. To remove
excess adaptors, all ligations were pooled in groups of 5
(10 Î¼l each ligation) and the resulting mixtures were
purified using a PCR Purification Kit (Scientifix, Clayton,
Victoria, Australia).
To check the success of the ligations for two samples,
the ligation products were ligated into a pGEM-T Easy
Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) after addition of
an A-overhang and used to transform JM-109 competent
cells according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Three
clones were sequenced for each sample to check whether
the original ligation had occurred as desired, using commercial ABI-3730XL capillary sequencing (Macrogen Inc,
Geumcheon-gu, Seoul, Korea). Sequences were examined
using Sequencher 4.7 (GeneCodes Corporation, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA).
Our barcodes had been designed to match the 2007 GS
FLX chemistry, so the Adapter A sequence was 6 bp
shorter than the 2010 Titanium Adapter A (which was to
be used in the actual sequencing reaction). To overcome
this problem, after the adapter ligation step, we performed
three replicate PCR reactions for each mixture using Titanium Adapter A as the forward primer and Titanium
Adapter B as the reverse primer. This reaction extended
the barcode end of the samples an extra 6 bp so that they
were of the form: 5â - Titanium A adapter - barcode checksum base - T - amplicon - A - Titanium B adapter -

Barcode deconvolution and quality control

Sequence (.fasta) and quality (.qual) files obtained from
the sequencing run were imported into the public Galaxy
platform, a free online bioinformatics interface available
at http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/[81]. The full dataset was
divided into gene regions by regular expression (REGEX)
matching the amplicon primer sequences. Since this
work was carried out, âclip adapterâ and âbarcode splitterâ
tools have become available in the FASTX-Toolkit
(http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) implemented
in Galaxy, which may simplify the procedure further.
Individual barcodes were then detected using R [82] [see
additional file 4 - Supplementary Text].
After this barcode deconvolution, quality control was
performed to trim low-quality read ends, mask unreliable
base calls and remove short sequences. This workflow is
shown in detail in Figure 9. A subset of rpl32-trnL reads
was examined in R to check the accuracy of the quality
control procedure and to estimate the frequency of barcode failure. Finally, a FASTA file containing all goodquality reads for each gene region, named by the source
individual, was exported for alignment and editing.
Sequence alignment and editing

Sequences were aligned using Sequencher 4.7 [83] for
each combination of individual and gene. Alignments
were edited manually to remove adapters, PCR primers
and bases that had been added during the ligation process. For the chloroplast regions, a single consensus product was expected for each individual. For the nuclear
regions, distinct alleles were identified as differing consistently by at least two base positions in >80% of reads
in the alignment. A separate alignment was then edited
manually for each allele.
Sequencing error rate was estimated by counting the
single-base variants in 25 of the rpl32-trnL alignments

(>20,000 bases). Poor-quality (<15) bases were excluded
from error estimation as they had been previously
masked with Ns. Length variation was also excluded.
Apparent alleles that actually resulted from PCR recombination were detected using two criteria. First, these
apparent alleles occurred in a minority of reads for that
particular individual/gene combination (usually <5%). Second, one end of the recombinant sequence matched one
common allele and the other end matched a different
common allele when all three were examined in a contig.
A subset of the alleles identified as recombinant were
checked using the BootScan method [84] in RDP3 [33].
Once a suitable sequence alignment was produced,
indels were coded. Apparent length variation in mononucleotide repeats of >5 bp was not scored, as there was
often no clear consensus between sequence reads at
such regions. Indels that were not phylogenetically
informative (that is only occurred in one individual)
were also not scored, as they may have resulted from
PCR errors. All other indels were coded as âaâ or âcâ and
added to the end of the sequence alignment, so weighting them as transversions.
Data analysis

For each sequence alignment, the best substitution
model was chosen by AIC value comparison using

Import sequence
(.fna, .fasta) file

Modeltest 3.7 [85] implemented in PAUP* v4b10 [86].
A pairwise genetic distance matrix was then calculated
using Mega 5 [87] with substitution model parameters
as close to those chosen in Modeltest as possible. This
distance matrix was followed to make a network in
SplitsTree 4.11.3 [88], using the NeighbourNet method
and the EqualAngle display option.
For the chloroplast regions, the same pairwise distance
matrix was used for investigating species and geographic
genetic structure. For the nuclear regions, an uncorrected
p-distance matrix made in Mega 5 was converted to an
individual distance matrix with Pofad 1.03 [89]. For all
seven gene regions, the following analysis was performed
in GENALEX 6.3 [90]. First, Poa annua sequences and
any species with only a single representative individual
were removed. Either species or broad geographic groups
(Tasmania, western Victoria, north-eastern Victoria, Kosciuszko Main Range (eastern NSW), Australian Capital
Territory, NSW lowlands) were coded as populations. An
analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed
with 999 permutations and both pairwise and overall FPT
output. Second, the genetic distance matrix was recoded
as a single population, and a geographic distance matrix
was calculated from the latitude/longitude of sample collection listed on the herbarium record of each individual.
A spatial autocorrelation analysis was then performed

using ten even distance classes of 100-km intervals, 999
permutations and 999 bootstrap resampling steps. It was
repeated for each region excluding all Tasmanian samples. A second analysis was performed with 20-km distance intervals for gene regions that showed spatial
genetic structure in the first analysis.
Representative CDO504 copy A and B sequences were
chosen that covered the sequence diversity observed in
this study. CDO504 sequences for other Poa species were
downloaded from GenBank [30]. All sequences were
aligned manually using Sequencher 4.7 without coding
insertion-deletion polymorphism. The best model of
nucleotide evolution was again chosen using Modeltest
3.7, run in PAUP*. Bayesian analysis was then performed
on the alignment in BEAST 1.6.1 [91], running 10,000,000
MCMC generations and logging every 1,000 generations,
with the following departures from the default priors: constant population size; GTR+G substitution model with
starting substitution matrix and gamma parameter values
chosen using ModelTest. A maximum clade credibility
tree was then calculated using TreeAnnotator after removing the first 1,000,000 generations as burnin. A maximum
parsimony analysis was also run on the alignment using
200 iterations of the ratchet provided in PaupRat [92]
implemented in PAUP*, with random-addition searches
with TBR branch swapping. One thousand bootstrap repetitions were then performed, using 50 random sequence
addition heuristic searches and TBR branch swapping.
