An expression map for Anopheles gambiae
Robert M MacCallum1*, Seth N Redmond1,2 and George K Christophides1

Abstract
Background: Quantitative transcriptome data for the malaria-transmitting mosquito Anopheles gambiae covers a
broad range of biological and experimental conditions, including development, blood feeding and infection. Webbased summaries of differential expression for individual genes with respect to these conditions are a useful tool
for the biologist, but they lack the context that a visualisation of all genes with respect to all conditions would
give. For most organisms, including A. gambiae, such a systems-level view of gene expression is not yet available.
Results: We have clustered microarray-based gene-averaged expression values, available from VectorBase, for
10194 genes over 93 experimental conditions using a self-organizing map. Map regions corresponding to known
biological events, such as egg production, are revealed. Many individual gene clusters (nodes) on the map are
highly enriched in biological and molecular functions, such as protein synthesis, protein degradation and DNA
replication. Gene families, such as odorant binding proteins, can be classified into distinct functional groups based
on their expression and evolutionary history. Immunity-related genes are non-randomly distributed in several
distinct regions on the map, and are generally distant from genes with house-keeping roles. Each immunity-rich
region appears to represent a distinct biological context for pathogen recognition and clearance (e.g. the humoral
and gut epithelial responses). Several immunity gene families, such as peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs)
and defensins, appear to be specialised for these distinct roles, while three genes with physically interacting
protein products (LRIM1/APL1C/TEP1) are found in close proximity.
Conclusions: The map provides the first genome-scale, multi-experiment overview of gene expression in A.
gambiae and should also be useful at the gene-level for investigating potential interactions. A web interface is
available through the VectorBase website http://www.vectorbase.org/. It is regularly updated as new experimental
data becomes available.

Background
Genome sequencing [1] and gene expression microarray
technologies have, in recent years, enabled systems-level
research into the malaria-transmitting mosquito Anopheles
gambiae. By measuring transcript levels with respect to
biological events, such as blood feeding, development,
parasite infection and mating, one can identify genes that
are likely to be involved in the underlying processes. However, due to the wealth of information produced by individual experiments and the numerous leads that require
further investigation, it is understandable that research
groups rarely perform so-called meta-analysis of gene
expression data, whereby multiple experiments are analysed simultaneously. Furthermore, meta-analysis is

impeded by incompatibilities between different versions of
genome annotations, microarray technologies, file formats,
experimental designs, data processing pipelines and statistical analyses. Several ongoing projects are aiming to eliminate these inconsistencies and produce uniform processed
and analysed data for the end user. Human curators at the
two major microarray repositories, NCBI GEO [2] and
Array Express [3], are working to produce enriched
resources known as GEO Datasets and the Gene Expression Atlas [4], respectively. The VectorBase consortium [5]
produces a similar unified gene expression resource for
the invertebrate vector community.
Web-based expression summaries provide useful and
concise biological overviews for individual genes of
interest, however a common requirement is to know
which other genes are expressed in a similar manner to
a particular gene. GEO and ArrayExpress’ curated
expression resources provide such “nearest neighbour”

gene lists, but within a single experiment only, not
across multiple experiments. Some years ago, gene
expression data from 553 Caenorhabditis elegans twocolour microarray experiments was clustered simultaneously to produce a 2D map known as TopoMap [6].
It was found that TopoMap clustered many genes of
similar function, such as lipid metabolism, heat shock
and neuronal genes. TopoMap is integrated into the
WormBase genomics resource, but the underlying
expression data is not available, reducing its utility. To
the best of our knowledge, no large-scale meta-analysis
of expression data has been made public for any other
species.
Here we present a simple method for clustering expression data from a diverse set of microarray experiments.
We have used data from A. gambiae, but the method is
applicable to any organism. The results are visualised on
a 2D map, and we show that many regions of the map
are strongly linked to biological function. Two case studies are presented. One focuses on odorant binding proteins, which can be classified into several functional
groups. The second looks at a large number of immunity-related genes, and likewise suggests specialised roles
for members of several immunity gene families.

Results and Discussion
A map of A. gambiae gene expression

Using the VectorBase gene expression resource (1.0.7,
June 2009) [5], gene-averaged expression values were
extracted for 93 experimental conditions (see Table 1)
derived from 11 publications [7-17]. After median-shift
normalisation (see Methods for details), 10194 A. gambiae
genes were clustered according to their expression
data into a 25×20 grid of discrete clusters using the selforganizing map algorithm [18] with a Pearson correlation
coefficient-based distance measure (see Methods for
further details). The self-organizing map is randomly initialised; its iterative “training” or clustering algorithm is
somewhat related to the k-means clustering method. However, unlike k-means, the 500 clusters on the self-organizing map are laid out in a meaningful order (two nearby
clusters will usually have similar characteristics), although
note that the “X” and “Y” axes have no predetermined
meaning. Figure 1 illustrates how the high-dimensional
expression data has been flattened into a two-dimensional
grid, as a result of the competitive learning process. Gene
expression space is highly convoluted, as indicated by the
multiple discrete areas of high expression for many conditions (e.g. adult female, embryo 6 h, fat body, 3 h post
blood meal).
Given the assumed difficulty of mapping such highdimensional data into two dimensions, how reproducible
are the maps with respect to the random initialisation
step? A simulation, based on an additional 100 randomly

Page 2 of 15

seeded maps (not shown), was performed to see how
often genes that are co-clustered in the “main” map
(shown in the figures) would co-cluster in a re-mapping.
It was found that 9907 of 50,000 (20%) randomly selected
co-clustered gene pairs co-cluster again in a randomly
selected re-mapping, while 40,747 (81%) of gene pairs remap to the same or “nearby” clusters (≤ 5 grid units
separation). This indicates that the general topology of
the map is reproducible, although the fine details may
not always be.
Map nodes and regions are enriched with respect to
gene function

The gene sets corresponding to each map node were
tested for enrichment in annotated function through a
Gene Ontology (GO [19]) term over-representation analysis [20]. A large number of biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components were found to
be enriched. Genes annotated with a small selection of
these GO terms are highlighted in Figure 2, where the
coloured pie slices within the grey circles indicate the
proportion of genes with these GO terms. Components
of macromolecular complexes, such as the ribosome and
proteasome are among the most highly enriched terms,
which is expected since these proteins need to be produced in stoichiometric amounts and are therefore likely
to be coregulated. Non-complex associated genes are
also highly clustered by the map, such as those involved
in polysaccharide metabolism and odorant binding. A
full list of highly significant GO terms is provided in
Table 2.
Highly enriched gene functions are frequently found
in multiple distinct regions of the map, indicating major
differences in their expression and hence the biological
context in which the genes operate. Some examples are
discussed below.
The strongest enrichment of function is seen for the
ribosomal proteins on the left hand edge of the map.
However, there is a second group of ribosomal protein
genes in the centre of the map that is characterised by
high expression in ovaries and is therefore likely to be
involved in egg production.
Genes involved in DNA, RNA and protein synthesis
are generally found above the diagonal from lower-left
to upper-right. Temporally, spatially or functionally
related metabolic functions are often co-located on the
map. For example, near the centre of the map, clusters
enriched in protein synthesis (ribosome), protein folding
and protein degradation (proteasome) are found
together. Additional file 1, Figure S1 shows a wider
selection of DNA/RNA/protein metabolic functions and
their relationships (e.g. the proximity of DNA replication and repair, transcription and RNA processing, and
protein synthesis and protein transport).

The 93 experimental conditions used in the VectorBase release 1.0.7 expression map are listed.

One additional gene function analysis was performed.
The null hypothesis asserts that the genes annotated with
a particular GO term are randomly distributed across the
map, and this is tested empirically. Table 3 lists the 59
GO terms for which this null hypothesis is rejected at P
<0.01 (after multiple testing correction), that is, functions
which are non-randomly distributed on the map.
Multi- vs. single-experiment maps

Some of the experiments included in this analysis, for
example the life-cycle series [10], blood meal time series
[8] and embryonic developmental series [17], have a
large enough number of experimental conditions to
allow effective clustering of genes on their own. Using
an identical self-organizing map approach on data from
these individual experiments, we found significant
enrichment of gene function in the resulting clusters, as
shown in Figure 3. However the number of enriched
GO terms (reflecting the breadth of biology visualised in
the map) was lower than that obtained with the allexperiment (VectorBase release 1.0.7) map. The difference is particularly clear at the P <1 × 10-6 threshold.

The mapping was also performed with two older
releases of the expression data (release 1.0.3, January
2009 and release 1.0.5, July 2008), which contain fewer
experiments (see Table 4). In general there is an
increase in the number of enriched GO terms as new
experiments are added, although there is a small drop in
the number of biological process terms from release
1.0.3 to 1.0.5. From this limited data we tentatively predict that the incorporation of future experimental data
will produce increasingly informative maps. Further discussion on the inclusion/exclusion of experiments can
be found below (see section Limitations).
Case study: odorant binding proteins

Odorant binding proteins (OBPs [21]), which transport
odorant molecules through the extracellular fluid of chemosensilla to transmembrane odorant receptor (OR)
proteins on olfactory receptor neurons, are found in
three main regions of the expression map (Figure 2, two
in purple and one in grey labelled “minimal regulation”,
bottom right). One region is characterised by minimal
differential regulation and presumably represents

Figure 1 The A. gambiae expression map. Expression data from all publicly available experiments, representing 93 assay conditions, was
summarised for 10194 genes and clustered using the self-organizing map algorithm. The area of the grey circles represents the number of genes
mapping to each discrete node on the map (minimum 1, maximum 114). The four panels show the same map with different annotations that
indicate regions of the map associated with high expression in various conditions: a Development from embryo to adult male and female [8,10]; b

constitutively expressed genes (although we cannot rule
out differential expression in some yet-to-be-performed
experiment). Another region rich in OBPs is characterised by high expression in non-blood fed females,
suggesting a role in mating or host seeking for these
genes. The third cluster is expressed after blood feeding
and may be implicated in locating suitable sites for egg
laying. A similar functional hypothesis for OBPs, based
on blood meal data alone, has already been proposed
[8], however this only identified three of the most differentially expressed genes, whereas the expression map
classifies the majority of this large family into three, or
perhaps more (see below), functional groups. In contrast
however, the vast majority of ORs (as defined by InterPro domain IPR004117) appear to be unregulated (data
not shown, but easily available via the web interface).

We observe a large degree of overlap between OBP
expression map clusters and paralogous groups (OBPPGs) defined in the VectorBase comparative genomics
database (Figure 4). This is to be expected since gene
duplication events are likely to involve “upstream” regulatory DNA, and so transcripts of duplicated genes are
likely to be co-regulated. However, paralogous OBPs are
somewhat divergent (20- 25% pairwise identity at the
protein level is common) so it is notable that their transcriptional regulation has been conserved. The phylogenetic analysis splits the “high in non-blood fed females”
region (Figure 2, middle right) into two sub-regions
(Figure 4): on the left, two clusters containing most
members of OBP-PG3 and OBP-PG4, and on the right,
a cluster dominated by OBP-PG5, which consists of a
tandem array of five hitherto unannotated [21] OBPs

are described according to their gene expression characteristics. The Gene Ontology terms are as follows: orange, GO:0003735, structural

(AGAP008280-AGAP008284) with no known orthologues in Drosophila melanogaster or other mosquitoes.
AGAP008280 is more highly expressed in males while
AGAP008281-AGAP008284 have very much higher
expression in females. This combination of sex-specific
expression and species-specific phylogeny suggests a
role for OBP-PG5 genes in mating, perhaps supplementary to wing-beat frequency matching [22]. Given that
members of OBP-PG3 and OBP-PG4 have Drosophila
orthologues, these OBPs may be involved in sugar-based
meal seeking rather than blood meal host seeking. OBPPG1 members have only mosquito orthologues, which
supports the suggestion above that these genes may be
involved in oviposition site selection (the larval habitats
of fruit flies and mosquitoes are very different).

Case study: immunity genes

In Figure 5, immunity-related genes, including Toll, IMD,
JAK/STAT and siRNA pathway members, and antimicrobial effectors such as defensins and cecropins are
marked on the expression map. These genes show a very
clear non-random distribution (P < 0.001), and occupy
several distinct regions of the map. Genes from the four
main immune pathways are generally intermingled,
rather than in pathway-specific separate clusters. This
possibly reflects the shared or similar biological contexts
(e.g. timing and tissues) in which the various immune
challenges are encountered and cleared. The intermingling may also suggest crosstalk between the pathways.
The genes REL1 and REL2, encoding the core transcription factors of the Toll and IMD pathways

A list of GO terms for which the genes annotated with them are found to be non-randomly distributed on the map. Only GO terms associated with between 20
and 400 genes were analysed. The test for non-random distribution and multiple testing correction is described in the Methods section.

Figure 3 Multi-experiment maps cluster genes by function to a greater extent than single experiment maps. The number of enriched
non-redundant Gene Ontology terms is shown for three significance thresholds for six different maps: three single experiment maps, two maps
made with older versions of the VectorBase expression data, and the map using current data as shown in previous figures. The multi-experiment
maps show substantially more clustering of genes by biological process and molecular function than the single experiment maps. Full details of
the maps and datasets can be found in Table 4.

respectively, have very different expression profiles. This
is perhaps expected since REL1, an orthologue of Drosophila dorsal, and other Toll pathway members have well
documented roles in dorso-ventral pattern formation in
the early embryo, and indeed we see TOLL1B, TOLL5A,
REL1, and CACT in the early embryo region of the
map. Notably, TOLL1A, 1B, 5A and 5B are co-orthologues of Drosophila Toll, which codes for a transmembrane receptor with developmental and immune roles.

One can speculate that, of these four mosquito receptors, TOLL1B is the most likely functional orthologue of
Toll as it clusters closely with REL1 on the map. However, the location of TOLL5B close to many other
immunity genes (Region labelled “High: fat body, NBF”,
middle right) as well as that of TOLL5A close to
TOLL1B, REL1 and CACT may imply that at least three
of the four co-orthologues of Toll play central, but likely
distinct, roles in mosquito immunity.

Figure 4 Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are found in several distinct regions of the expression map, which generally correspond to
paralogous groups. The OBP paralogous groups (OBP-PGs) are defined (top). OBPs are shown as coloured pie sections on the expression map
(centre) with regions of interest are outlined and annotated in terms of two major expression characteristics. The pie charts of four map nodes
dominated by OBPs are shown at greater magnification (bottom left and right).

Figure 5 Immunity genes are highly localised. Genes belonging to various immunity-related pathways and gene families are shown on the
map. Toll pathway members are labeled in dark cyan, the IMD pathway in dark red, JAK/STAT pathway in yellow, siRNA pathway in bright
green, anti-microbial peptides and effectors in magenta, and LRIM1, APL1C and TEPs are labeled in dark green. CLIP-domain serine proteases,
serpins, C-type lectins and galectins are shown generically in black, light red, black italic and cyan respectively. Several regions of the map that
are rich in immunity genes are outlined and described by their dominant gene expression characteristics.

Many of the major immunity gene family members
are quite widely dispersed on the map. For example, the
anti-microbial cecropin genes CEC1, CEC2 and CEC3
are tightly clustered in a region characterised by strong
midgut expression and low expression 3 h post blood
meal (top right), while CEC4 is located quite far away in
a region with less overall differential expression and a
mild positive response at 3 h post blood meal (lower
right). This suggests that cecropins 1-3 have similar
roles but are perhaps specialised to counter a range of
pathogens, while CEC4 has evolved to perform a different role. The four defensins have a similarly informative
distribution: DEF1 is with the main cluster of cecropins
suggesting it has a similar function, while the others are
in the lower right corner where the 3 h post blood meal

response is strong. In particular, DEF3 is clustered with
a large number of cuticle genes, suggesting a role in
immunity during blood meal induced cuticle expansion,
perhaps against fungal infection.
The peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are
another gene family whose functional diversity is
reflected in the map. All PGRPs, as their name implies,
are able to bind microbial peptidoglycan specifically but
some are believed to have catalytic activity due to the
conservation of three active site amino acids [23-25]. In
A. gambiae, the putative catalytic members of the family
are PGRPLB, PGRPS2 and PGRPS3. Interestingly these
three genes all map to the right-most edge of the map.
PGRPLB lies in a region populated by other effector
genes and peptides (GAM1 (AGAP008645), LYSC7,

MacCallum et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:620
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/620

DEF1 and cecropins 1-3), supporting its proposed role
as an antimicrobial agent. PGRPS2 and PGRPS3 map
close to DEF2 and DEF4 respectively, suggesting parallel
but as yet unidentified roles.
The recently described physical interactions between
two leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins LRIM1
(AGAP006348) and APL1C and the complement C3-like
protein TEP1 [26] are mirrored in the expression map;
the two LRR genes map to the same grid node while
TEP1 maps to the node below. These proteins are implicated with the activation of the mosquito complement
system, with TEP1 being shown to localise around invading Plasmodium berghei ookinetes. This region of the
map (Figure 5, green outline, middle right) has the highest density of immunity genes, including many other
TEPs (1,2,9,10,12,17), CLIP-domain serine proteases, and
one additional member of the recently characterised
LRIM family [27], LRIM17 (LRRD7), which has been
shown through RNAi mediated knockdowns to affect
Plasmodium ookinete invasion [28].
Limitations

Although the clustering of genes based on their expression in many different experiments appears to be successful–as assessed by the co-clustering of genes with
similar function, at least–the methodology has some
potential shortcomings which merit discussion.
Since data from so many experimental conditions is presented in one place there is the possibility that users could
over-interpret map cluster expression summaries. For
example, genes in cluster 22,9 could be (wrongly) interpreted as having “high expression in the fat bodies of non
blood-fed females”. However, the fat body assays used tissue from blood-fed females, so the correct summary
should be “high expression in non blood-fed females and
the fat bodies of blood-fed females”. Users should be
aware that very few of the possible combinations of experimental conditions have actually been assayed.
The use of different mosquito strains from one laboratory to another may also make interpretation of the map
more difficult. First, polymorphisms may differentially
alter microarray hybridisation efficiency in one strain
relative to another for certain genes. However, this would
appear to have a minimal confounding effect, since
microarray studies have directly compared different
strains and the results have been successfully validated
with quantitative PCR [15,29]. Second, strains may actually exhibit biologically meaningful differences in expression (e.g. a gene may be highly expressed in the midgut
of one strain but not in another). On first impressions
this may seem like a problem, but it is actually an advantage because the differential (inter-experiment) expression resulting from strain differences (and other sample
characteristics, such as sex, rearing conditions, etc)

Page 11 of 15

simply provides data with which finer-grained clustering
can be obtained. The web interface, however, could be
enhanced in future versions to display all available sample characteristics. Currently only the most pertinent
information is available in the experiment titles (e.g.
“Adult female tissues”).
While we have re-analysed all data in order to standardise the statistical treatment there is still a possibility that
technical differences between microarray technologies
(platforms) could affect the meta-analysis. For example,
platforms with a wider range of detection are capable of
producing data with greater dynamic range. If high and
low dynamic range datasets are mapped together, the
high dynamic range data will have a greater influence on
the clustering of genes. However, the dynamic range of
expression data can also be influenced by the relative
severity of the experimental conditions being tested (for
example a 10°C heat shock will cause greater magnitude
gene expression changes than a 1°C heat shock [30]). The
VectorBase 1.0.7 expression data set contains both high
and low dynamic range experiments (Additional file 2,
Figure S2). The low dynamic range experiments tend to
involve less severe conditions, such as strain comparisons. If datasets were range-normalised prior to mapping,
the biological relevance of very highly regulated genes
would be lost.
Another limitation is that we discard/ignore the statistics relating to the mean expression values used as input
data to build the map. For instance, the numbers of replicates and standard deviations could be used to filter out
bad data or to produce Gaussian models for each expression value (with which the map could be trained). Such
enhancements, if implemented, would likely improve the
quality of the mapping still further.
We have tried to keep the number of parameters in our
approach to a minimum, however the size and shape of
the map has a major effect on the outcome and was
decided somewhat arbitrarily. In general, small maps produce large gene clusters, while large maps produce smaller clusters. For any given biological annotation, the
extent of its enrichment within clusters will depend on
cluster size and the number of genes annotated as such
(i.e. in a large map, members of a large gene family may
be spread across many neighbouring nodes but not be
significantly enriched in any one node; while in a smaller
map, significant enrichment in one large cluster may be
seen). Thus, no map size is optimal in all cases. The
dimensions of the VectorBase A. gambiae expression
map (25 × 20) were chosen to give an average of 20
genes per cluster–a manageable number. Alternative
map sizes could be provided by VectorBase in the future.
VectorBase strives to be unbiased and include all data
for its core species in the expression database, particularly those with raw data deposited in public repositories.

MacCallum et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:620
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/620

However, for technical reasons, total coverage of experiments cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, in the mosquito field there is quite a heavy experimental bias (for
example, the majority of data comes from female mosquitoes). As the VectorBase resource expands, questions
arise as to what to do with largely redundant datasets
(there are now three adult tissue experiments: [8,10,31]).
Multiple assays of similar conditions or tissues (albeit
with strain and rearing differences, see above) will proportionally shift the focus of the map towards those conditions or tissues; less space will be available for the
allocation of genes into clusters based on other expression characteristics. One solution may be to perform
some pruning of redundant datasets, another may be to
produce specialist maps (e.g. developmental studies only)
in addition to the “all conditions” map.

Conclusions
One obvious use for the A. gambiae expression map is
to short-list potential interaction partners for proteins of
interest. For example, one can extrapolate from the
recent findings for LRIM1 [26] that other LRIM family
members will form heteromeric complexes and perhaps
also interact with one or more TEPs, and that these
genes will, like LRIM1, APL1C and TEP1, probably also
be co-located on the map. Similarly, we observe a general tendency for CLIP-domain serine proteases and serpin family serine protease inhibitors (marked “CLIP”
and “SRPN” in Figure 5 respectively) to be clustered
together in many areas of the map, which suggests that
the experimental elucidation of enzyme-inhibitor relationships can be greatly accelerated using the map.
A further advantage of performing clustering on all
available data is that the clusters obtained are likely to
be fine-grained enough for promoter analysis aimed at
the discovery of cis-regulatory DNA sequences responsible for co-regulation. Post-transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms (e.g. endogenous miRNA) will also be
responsible for some of the observed co-regulation, so
transcript-based signals (e.g. miRNA targets) might also
be detectable in expression map clusters.
Finally, we propose a role for expression maps in comparative transcriptomics. Current approaches compare
data from two or more broadly equivalent experiments
that have been performed in two or more organisms (e.g.
developmental stages in A. gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster [10]). If the experiments are performed in different laboratories and at different times, the experimental
designs are likely to be different enough to invalidate or at
the least complicate the analysis. However, expression
maps tend to smooth out these differences, so that intramap distances between pairs of orthologous genes should
be robustly comparable between species, especially if
the maps have been generated using a similar set of

Page 12 of 15

experiments. One can also quantify the functional divergence of gene families by measuring their intra-map dispersal, and compare these between species.

Availability
The A. gambiae expression map has potential for making expression data more accessible and useful to
researchers throughout the field. A web interface is
available at http://funcgen.vectorbase.org/ExpressionMap/Anopheles_gambiae/paper – showing the data presented in this paper. However, as the resource is
updated as part of VectorBase’s release cycle, newer versions are also available. While this manuscript was being
revised an expression map for the Dengue vector Aedes
aegypti was also made available. In addition, the source
code for map generation and web visualisation is available under the GNU General Public License at https://
github.com/VectorBase/ExpressionMap.
Methods
Data preparation

All data was obtained from the VectorBase gene expression resource, which is a curated collection of published,
publicly available gene expression data for invertebrate
vectors of human pathogens. The standard VectorBase
curation pipeline begins with importing original raw data
files, obtained from GEO [2], ArrayExpress [3] or the
authors, into the microarray data management system
BASE [32]. Low quality data is then removed according
to the authors’ quality flags. Intensity data is normalised
with either the Lowess algorithm [33] for two colour
data, or the RMA algorithm [34] for single channel data,
using the relevant BASE plugin with default parameters.
All ratio or intensity values for a given gene and hybridisation combination (there may be multiple reporters per
gene and/or multiple spots per reporter) are summarised
by their mean. The means from multiple hybridisations
for the same experimental condition (these are usually
biological replicates, or less often, technical “dye swap”
replicates) are then averaged again to give a single value
per gene and condition combination. The number of
averaged data points and their variance are discarded (see
Results and Discussion: “Limitations”).
Some microarray technologies and experimental
designs produce intensity values whose absolute values
cannot always be compared directly from gene to gene.
These include single channel technologies and some two
colour experiments using global reference samples. With
this kind of data, it is only possible to calculate correlation coefficients between gene expression profiles within
a single experiment. Some form of normalisation is
needed to give expression values from different “reference-less” experiments a common reference point so that
multi-experiment expression profiles can be compared.

MacCallum et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:620
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/620

We chose to apply a “median shift” normalisation step to
such ratios and intensity values. In median shift normalisation, each expression profile is centred around zero by
subtracting its median value (example: for a gene with
expression values in one particular experiment (say, three
tissues) being 11,4, and 6, the normalised values will be 5,
-2, and 0). The median-shift normalised data for 10194
genes and 93 experimental conditions is available from
the VectorBase download page.
Self-organising map

The expression data was clustered using the self-organizing map algorithm as follows. Unless otherwise stated,
the map dimensions were 25×20, the starting learning
rate was 0.1, and the starting neighbourhood radius was
10. Prior to training, the map was randomly initialised
with values within the range of the expression data. During the training of a self-organizing map, input vectors
are compared with reference vectors at each map node
(henceforth: “node vectors”). These vectors have the
same number of dimensions as the input data (93 in this
case). In this work, the comparison is made with the
Pearson correlation coefficient, and missing values are
simply excluded from the calculation. (The Euclidean distance measure was also tried and gave similar results.)
The node vector with the highest correlation and its
neighbours within a specified radius are updated towards
the input vector by an amount proportional to the learning rate. As training proceeds, input vectors are “presented” to the map at random (with replacement) on
average 20 times each while the learning rate and neighbourhood radius are linearly reduced towards zero.
When training is complete, genes are assigned for a final
time to their closest node. Each node vector can be
thought of as a mean expression vector (or profile) for
the genes mapping to that node. The algorithm attempts
to preserve the topology of the high dimensional input
data in the two-dimensional mapping, however the two
axes of the map have no predetermined meaning.
The algorithm was implemented in Perl and PDL (Perl
Data Language), and the maps are stored in a relational
database through the object oriented Class::DBI interface. All source code is available under the GNU General Public License at https://github.com/VectorBase/
ExpressionMap.
Map outlines

The coloured outlines in Figures 1, 2 & 5 indicate
regions where one or more node vector components
satisfy a simple arithmetic inequality. For example, the
orange outlines marked “embryo” in Figure 1a highlight
map nodes where the node vector component for
embryo expression [10] is greater than 0.25. The choices
of node vector component and thresholds was largely

Page 13 of 15

arbitrary, with an emphasis on simplicity and clear
visualisation. For Figures 2 & 5, nodes of interest (e.g.
with a large fraction of genes with a particular function)
were chosen manually and vector component thresholds
were determined in a semi-automatic fashion. Different
thresholds may be explored interactively via the web
interface.
Gene function over-representation analysis

The self-organizing map presented in Figures 1, 2 & 5
consists of 500 nodes, each of which can be considered
as a gene cluster. We applied a Gene Ontology (GO)
over-representation analysis as implemented in the program ErmineJ [20] on each cluster. The analysis uses
Fisher’s Exact Test and the null hypothesis states that
genes with a particular GO term are randomly distributed between the cluster of interest and the rest of the
map. GO terms that are associated with less than ten or
more than a quarter of the genes on the map were
excluded from the analysis as they are generally not
informative. The GO term database of 2009/03/02 was
used to defined GO term relationships, and the GO
annotations for A. gambiae genes were retrieved from
VectorBase BioMart on the same date.
The P values reported from the GO analysis are corrected for multiple testing (>1000 GO terms are tested)
according to the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery
rate (FDR) procedure, and correspond to the minimum
FDRs (false positives as a fraction of all positives) at
which the null hypotheses can be rejected. This correction does not take into account overlaps between parent
and child GO terms.
Additionally, a GO term is only reported as enriched
if four or more genes in the cluster are annotated with
that term.
Empirical non-random distribution test

The over-representation analysis described above is not
ideal in situations where genes with a particular function
are localised within the map, but are not necessarily confined to one map node/cluster. We therefore implemented a sampling-based test to quantify the general nonrandomness of a gene set on the map as follows. For the
set N of n genes of interest located on the map we calculate the mean, d, of the city block distance to their closest
neighbours within N. Then, sets N’ of n genes are randomly sampled from the map 100 times. For each sample
of genes, their mean distance to closest neighbour d’ is
calculated as above and compared with the “true” value
d. For a non-randomly distributed set of genes, d’ is not
likely to be smaller than d. The estimated P value is
therefore [d <d]. Where multiple tests are performed, a
100
Bonferroni correction is applied by multiplying the

MacCallum et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:620
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/620

number of random samplings by the number of tests
(159 in the case of Table 3).
Odorant binding protein paralogous groups

For this analysis, odorant binding proteins are defined as
the 49 VectorBase genes annotated with InterPro
domain IPR006625 (Insect pheromone/odorant binding
protein PhBP). The within-species paralogues for each
gene were retrieved via the Perl API from the VectorBase/Ensembl Compara database (7 species, schema version 54, August 2009). Paralogous groups (PGs) are
defined as sets of genes with the same mutual paralogues. Six genes have no paralogues, two PGs contain
two genes each, and one PG contains three genes. The
remaining PGs contain five or more genes and are listed
in Figure 4.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Figure S1. DNA/RNA/protein metabolic functions.
Pie charts for each cluster indicate the relative number of genes
annotated with selected GO terms related to DNA/RNA/protein
metabolism. In general, the relative location of the gene functions
reflects the underlying biology. For example, DNA replication and repair
are found close to each other [35], as are translation and protein
transport (translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum is co-translational
[36]). In contrast to previous figures, the pie chart area is not
proportional to the number of genes in each cluster. The colours
correspond to the following GO terms: orange, GO:0006260, DNA
replication; light blue, GO:0006281, DNA repair; green, GO:0006350,
transcription; yellow, GO:0006396, RNA processing; dark blue,
