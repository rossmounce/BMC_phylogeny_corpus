Abstract
Background: The pattern of genetic variation within and among populations of a species is
strongly affected by its phylogeographic history. Analyses based on putatively neutral markers
provide data from which past events, such as population expansions and colonizations, can be
inferred. Drosophila virilis is a cosmopolitan species belonging to the virilis group, where divergence
times between different phylads go back to the early Miocene. We analysed mitochondrial DNA
sequence variation among 35 Drosophila virilis strains covering the species' range in order to detect
demographic events that could be used to understand the present characteristics of the species, as
well as its differences from other members of the group.
Results: Drosophila virilis showed very low nucleotide diversity with haplotypes distributed in a
star-like network, consistent with a recent world-wide exponential expansion possibly associated
either with domestication or post-glacial colonization. All analyses point towards a rapid population
expansion. Coalescence models support this interpretation. The central haplotype in the network,
which could be interpreted as ancestral, is widely distributed and gives no information about the
geographical origin of the population expansion. The species showed no geographic structure in
the distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes, in contrast to results of a recent microsatellite-based
analysis.
Conclusion: The lack of geographic structure and the star-like topology depicted by the D. virilis
haplotypes indicate a pattern of global demographic expansion, probably related to human
movements, although this interpretation cannot be distinguished from a selective sweep in the
mitochondrial DNA until nuclear sequence data become available. The particular behavioural traits
of this species, including weak species-discrimination and intraspecific mate choice exercised by the
females, can be understood from this perspective.

Background
The development of methods to analyse intraspecific phylogenies has provided very valuable tools to understand
how populations have been influenced by historical and
contemporary processes [1,2]. Mitochondrial DNA has

proved a very useful tool for reconstructing phylogenies of
species and historical demographic events [3-8]. Its usefulness for the study of closely related taxa and populations within species lies in its very low rate of
recombination, maternal inheritance, conserved strucPage 1 of 8

ture, reduced effective population size and relatively high
rates of evolution [6,7,9]. However, after an explosion of
studies using mitochondrial DNA for phylogeographic
inference, there is nowadays rising concern about making
inferences based in this single molecule, due to problems
related with recombination, effective population size,
mutation rates, introgression and neutrality [10,11].
These problems influence the construction of species-level
phylogenies most profoundly [e.g. [12]]. However, they
may also confound estimations of demographic history
and coalescence times within species. Nevertheless, if
these drawbacks are taken into account when examining
the evolutionary history of a taxon, mitochondrial DNA
surveys can provide efficient means of detecting gene
flow, levels of reproductive isolation, species boundaries
and historical patterns of population structure [13].
The pattern of variation of mitochondrial DNA, permits
inferences about a species' demographic history, including events such as population expansions and colonizations. The application of coalescent theory [14,15] for the
analysis of population data has allowed inferences about
past and present population size. A change in population
size over time will be reflected in the DNA sequences in
such a way that the analysis of the substitutions can indicate the direction and the timing of the change. It has been
shown that demographic expansions lead to star-shaped
genealogies [16], an excess of rare mutations [17] and a
unimodal mismatch distribution [18]. Although spatial
or range expansions also lead to an increase in the global
effective size of a species, they lead to the same molecular
signature as that of a purely demographic expansion if the
migration rate between demes was large [19,20]. Otherwise, for relatively low levels of gene flow, multimodal
mismatch distributions should be expected [19]. During
the Pleistocene, global climate oscillations and the associated cycles of glaciation had a profound influence on the
population distributions of many organisms [21-24].
Populations and species retracted their habitats to limited
areas which served as refuges. Range expansions and colonizations followed by demographic expansions often
happened after these events, when climate ameliorated,
and it is possible to find the signals of those processes in
contemporary populations.
The Drosophila virilis group comprises 13 species and subspecies divided into two clades, the virilis and montana
phylads [25-30]. Throckmorton [25] suggested that the
phylads diverged in the early Miocene, or not later than
the Pliocene, when both of them entered the New World
by way of Beringia. Divergence times between the phylads
have been estimated to be from 7 Mya [31] to 11 Mya
[29]. In general, species within the montana phylad have
evolved more in terms of chromosomal re-arrangements,
and are also more variable regarding the number of inver-

sions segregating within populations than members of the
virilis phylad [25], although species in this group show a
higher number of fusions.
Drosophila virilis group species have been used as models
in evolutionary studies for decades and their role in this
kind of research will become even more important now
that the whole genome of D. virilis has been sequenced
http://insects.eugenes.org/species/data/dvir/. Within the
virilis phylad, Drosophila virilis is a domestic species of
nearly cosmopolitan distribution. The primitive karyotype is found in D. virilis and natural populations are
exceptional in having no inversion polymorphism, in
contrast to other species of the group. It has been proposed that D. virilis originated somewhere in the ancient
deciduous forests of China or in arid regions such as Iran
or Afghanistan, and remained isolated from the remaining species of the group until relatively recently [25]. Its
ancestral role is supported by its monomorphic karyotype, an extremely high (about 50%) proportion of satellite DNA, and the distribution of various repetitive DNA
elements [32].
Drosophila virilis also differs from other species of the
group by the weak species-discrimination and intraspecific mate choice exercised by the females [e.g. [25,33]].
Although females are able to recognize species-specific
characters of the male song, they do not require to hear
the song before mating [34]. D. virilis strains originating
from different parts of the species distribution have
shown significant variation in male courtship song [33].
Rapid expansion into a novel habitat, not occupied by
related species, may explain these characteristics. The ability of D. virilis to survive in various kinds of environments
can partly be explained by its high thermotolerance [35]
and high tolerance for ethanol [36]. Like several other cosmopolitan species, e.g. D. melanogaster, D. virilis possesses
intraspecific genetic differences in thermotolerance with
an obvious adaptive significance to local thermal conditions [37], which may make it easier for the species to
occupy new habitats.
In this paper, we report an analysis of the demographic
history of D. virilis using mitochondrial DNA sequence
data, in order to provide an historical framework for evolutionary studies on life history and behavioural traits of
the species and comparisons with other species in the
group, especially D. montana, the most divergent species
within the virilis group.

Results and Discussion
We examined a total of 35 lines covering the species range:
9 from Japan, 9 from Eastern Europe and Central Asia, 5
from Western Europe, 2 from the United States and 10
from China (Table 1). These lines have been kept in cap-

the case of line 15010-1051.8 from California, and only

The analysis was based on a total of 1358 base pairs of
mitochondrial DNA sequence, 670 bp corresponding to
the cytochrome oxidase I and 688 bp to the cytochrome oxidase II gene. There was a total of 19 haplotypes and,
among them, 24 nucleotide substitutions, of which 20
were transitions and 4 transversions. Nucleotide diversity
(per base) was 0.00185 ± 0.00114. The haplotype network (Figure 1), estimated using statistical parsimony,
included one common haplotype, represented in six lines
and present in all geographical regions except the USA.
The second most frequent haplotype was found in four
lines from China. The difference between these haplotypes was only two substitutions: in fact, the maximum

number of differences between any pair of haplotypes was
only 7 substitutions. There was no apparent geographical
structure in the relationships among the haplotypes: the
network was star-like with low levels of sequence divergence and a high frequency of unique mutations, indicating either a rapid population expansion or that selection
has caused the rapid spread of a mitochondrial lineage
carrying beneficial mutations. The limited number of
lines sampled per region means that rare haplotypes specific to individual regions may have been missed. However, such haplotypes would contribute little to overall
measures of differentiation.
When analysing demographic scenarios, where migration
between populations, recombination and sexual reproduction usually play an important role, population history might not be tree-like. In these cases intraspecific
genealogies constitute the appropriate way to make evolu-

tionary inferences. The genealogical approach, which estimates parameters of the genealogical process, provides a
coherent framework in which to consider recombination,
migration, selection and other processes [38]. This
approach takes into account several characteristics of the
populations which make them different to species-level
analysis, such as low divergence, ancestral nodes extant in
the sampled population, multifurcations, reticulation and
large sample sizes [1,2].
The mismatch distribution was smooth and unimodal
(Figure 2a), but it departed from the expectations of the
stepwise population expansion model (Harpending's raggedness index = 0.0721, p = 0.11, fit to the stepwise
growth model, SSD = 0.0157, p = 0.03). There was an
excess of unique mutations compared with that expected
for a constant-size population (Table 2). We used the program FLUCTUATE to fit a model of exponential population expansion and estimate θ0, the present-day scaled
population size (Table 2). The site categories and the rate
of change were obtained using a maximum likelihood

heuristic search in PAUP, using HKY85 as preferred
model, following MODELTEST, with 5 rate categories,
transition/transversion ratio of 2.3 and shape parameter
of 0.105. Model comparisons using GENIE confirm that
the exponential growth model was a good fit to the data
and this can be seen in the skyline plot (Figure 2b) which
indicates a rapid and recent expansion (Table 2).
The Drosophila virilis lines analysed in this study did not
show any geographic structure among mitochondrial haplotypes. There was a very low number of substitutions differentiating haplotypes and they were commonly shared
among locations. All analyses point towards a rapid population expansion over a short time-scale, which could be
consistent with population growth following the end of
the last glaciation and/or a shift into domestic environments. These are the most obvious possible causes of
expansion, although they suggest population growth
would have initiated less than 10,000 years ago which is
more recent than the timing implied by the skyline plot,
for example, which suggests continuous population

In natural populations, ancestral haplotypes may persist
and be sampled together with their descendants [2]. The
coalescence process predicts that high frequency haplotypes are likely to have been present in the population for
a long time [2]. Rare haplotypes represent more recent
mutations and are more likely to be related to common
haplotypes than to other rare variants [39]. Therefore,
ancestral haplotypes have greater probability of being central in a network, being common and having a broader
geographic distribution [2]. Following these considerations, the central haplotype in the network appears to be
ancestral (Figure 1), and because it is widely distributed
gives no information on the geographic origin of the population expansion.

growth for >50,000 years (using a substitution rate of 108 per year). However, it is not possible to rule out alternative models, such as recent expansion from a smaller but
more stable refugial population and time estimation
should be treated with caution given the wide confidence
interval on the expansion rate estimate and uncertainty
about the substitution rate in D. virilis.

In their study on sequence variation in six X-linked genes
of 21 D. virilis strains from different continents, Vieira and
Charlesworth [40] found no fixed differences between the
Asian strains and strains originating from Europe or
North- or South-America, all the variants found outside
Asia being also present in Asia, but not vice versa. These
data were consistent with either a large population centred in Asia and a smaller migrant population elsewhere,
or a large migrant population that went through a bottleneck [40]. Throckmorton [25] has previously suggested
that D. virilis originated from an ancestral form in Asia,
since the most primitive species of the virilis-repleta section
of the genus Drosophila have been observed in Southeast
Asia. This hypothesis recently received further support
from a molecular phylogeny of the virilis section [41].
In a recent study, Huttunen et al. [42] analysed 48 microsatellite loci in 30 D. virilis strains, many of which were
analysed here for mitochondrial DNA. Although a phylogenetic tree and STRUCTURE analysis showed only moderate clustering of the strains originating from
Continental Asia, Europe, America and Japan, an assignment test using a priori information about the geographical origin of the strains gave high posterior probabilities
for their correct assignment. Microsatellite variation also
showed significant population differentiation, as measured by FST, with evidence for isolation by distance. Variability detected by microsatellites can have a more recent
origin than variation measured by mitochondrial DNA.

Consequently, the lack of population differentiation in
mitochondrial DNA could indicate shared ancestry while
microsatellite variation between populations indicates
that differentiation is in progress because current gene
flow is restricted. Alternatively, the homogeneity of mitochondrial DNA could be the result of a recent selective
sweep which did not disturb the pre-existing population
structure for nuclear loci. Unfortunately, the use of laboratory strains prohibited testing for a demographic expansion using the microsatellite data.
There are several papers describing genetic variation in
another species of the virilis group, D. americana, which,
together with D. lummei, represents dispersal of the virilis
group into the Neartic region [43-46]. Drosophila americana is represented by two chromosomal forms, D. a.
americana and D. a. texana, differing by a fusion between
the X and fourth chromosome and the frequency of chromosomal inversions. As in the case of D. virilis, phylogenetic analysis failed to resolve distinct clades between the
chromosomal forms and also between geographic regions
sampled, with Fst values not significantly different from
zero [43,44]. The absence of differentiation among the
geographically distinct populations indicated either that
gene flow homogenizes neutral sequence variation, even
when different chromosomal rearrangements are
involved, or that large populations retain shared ancestral
polymorphisms [43]. Furthermore, and opposite to
results obtained for D. virilis [42], an analysis of 27 microsatellite loci in 85 individuals from 6 different natural
populations of D. americana showed no differentiation
between populations [46], which confirms the existence
of ongoing gene flow between populations of the species.
The pattern of geographic variation in haplotypes of D.
virilis, and in D. americana, is in sharp contrast with the
pattern recently described for another species of the
group, D. montana [47]. In this case there was clear differentiation, based on both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites, between lines from populations in Finland,
Canada and USA. Both markers indicated the presence of
at least two distinct populations, one in Eurasia and the
other one representing the expansion of the species to the
New World, with a divergence time between them estimated from 450,000 to 900,000 years ago, within the
Pleistocene. Although D. virilis and D. montana belong to
the same species group in the genus Drosophila, they represent different phylads and differ in many characteristics,
including chromosomal variation, habitat preferences,
and courtship behaviour. Differences in biogeographic
history, reflected in the pattern of mitochondrial variation
in the two species, could have been important in the origin of these characteristics and constitute the basis for the
interpretation of their evolution.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/59

Conclusion
Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation in Drosophila virilis suggests a worldwide exponential population expansion during the Pleistocene, with extensive migration
between demes. Slight differentiation at microsatellite
markers results either from bottlenecking during or after
expansion, or accumulation of differentiation across current barriers to gene exchange. The alternative possibility,
that a selective sweep has homogenised mitochondrial
sequences without disturbing pre-existing population
structure for nuclear markers, cannot be excluded. However, a recent demographic expansion is consistent with
the domestic habitat of D. virilis and helps to explain its
lack of chromosomal polymorphism as well as evidence
for a history of weak selection on mating behaviour by
comparison with related species.

Methods
Drosophila stocks and sampling
In total, 35 Drosophila virilis strains, covering the species'
range, were selected for analysis (Table 1). The stocks were
collected during a time period covering almost 90 years,
from 1913 to flies sampled in China in 2001/2002. A single individual from each strain, either from laboratory
stocks or freshly caught, was used to extract DNA and for
PCR amplification of the COI and COII mitochondrial
genes.
Amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial DNA
DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved flies following
a standard protocol [48], where the samples were homogenised in buffer and proteinase k, and DNA was extracted
with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with
isopropanol. The amplification of mitochondrial DNA
was carried out with primers flanking the COII gene in the
tRNALYS and tRNALEU [[49]; TL2: 5'-ATGGCAGATTAGTGCAATGG-3', TKN: 5'-GTTTAAGAGACCAGTACTTG-3'],
which amplify an 850 bp fragment that includes the 688
bp
COII
gene,
and
COI-1460-F:
5'-ATCTATCGCCTAAACTTCAGCC-3' and COI-2195-R: 5'-ACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATC-3' [50,51] which amplify
the complete 670 bp corresponding to the COI gene. PCR
reactions were performed in 50 μl volumes including 0.5
μM of each primer, 200 μM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1
U Taq polymerase (Bioline) in reaction buffer. Initial
denaturation was for 7 minutes at 94°C followed by 35
cycles of 1 minute at 94°C, 1 minute at the annealing temperature (54°C for COI and 56°C for COII) and 1 minute
at 72°C, and a final incubation of 5 minutes at 72°C. The
products were purified using QIAquick columns (QIAGEN) and sequenced using the forward primer. No
ambiguous sites were found in the sequences. Sequences
(GenBank accession nos. DQ426800 to DQ426823) were
aligned with CLUSTAL-V [52].

Mitochondrial DNA analysis of population history and
phylogeography
The partition homogeneity test, PHT [53], as implemented in PAUP 4.0, was used to test for incongruence
between the COI and COII data sets. There was congruence between the data-sets and therefore the two fragments were combined for all subsequent analyses.
ARLEQUIN 2.0 [54] was used to calculate pairwise distances between haplotypes, the mismatch distributions
and tests of the standard neutral model for a demographically stable population (Tajima's D [55] and Fu's F [56]).

The program FLUCTUATE [57] was used to make simultaneous estimates of present day θ and the population
growth rate g, assuming an exponential model of growth
and using a maximum likelihood approach. The parameters used for the simulations were obtained by running a
hierarchy of likelihood-ratio tests in Modeltest 3.0 [58] to
choose the model of evolution with the best fit to the data.
Skyline plots were constructed using GENIE v. 3.0 [59].
The starting trees were obtained using maximum likelihood with molecular clock enforced. The software
requires that the genealogy is estimated under the
assumption of a molecular clock [59]. GENIE was also
used to calculate the fit to different models of population
growth, with fit assessed using the corrected Akaike Information Criterion.
Networks of haplotypes were constructed based on statistical parsimony using the program TCS 1.06 [60].
