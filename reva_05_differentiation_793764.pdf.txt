Abstract
Background: Complete sequencing of bacterial genomes has become a common technique of
present day microbiology. Thereafter, data mining in the complete sequence is an essential step.
New in silico methods are needed that rapidly identify the major features of genome organization
and facilitate the prediction of the functional class of ORFs. We tested the usefulness of local
oligonucleotide usage (OU) patterns to recognize and differentiate types of atypical oligonucleotide
composition in DNA sequences of bacterial genomes.
Results: A total of 163 bacterial genomes of eubacteria and archaea published in the NCBI
database were analyzed. Local OU patterns exhibit substantial intrachromosomal variation in
bacteria. Loci with alternative OU patterns were parts of horizontally acquired gene islands or
ancient regions such as genes for ribosomal proteins and RNAs. OU statistical parameters, such as
local pattern deviation (D), pattern skew (PS) and OU variance (OUV) enabled the detection and
visualization of gene islands of different functional classes.
Conclusion: A set of approaches has been designed for the statistical analysis of nucleotide
sequences of bacterial genomes. These methods are useful for the visualization and differentiation
of regions with atypical oligonucleotide composition prior to or accompanying gene annotation.

Background
The number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes increases
rapidly each year. Their comprehensive analysis requires
the development of new high-throughput computational
methods. The analysis of oligonucleotide usage biases has
been recognized to be practical for the recognition of
pathogenicity islands [1,2] and elucidation of origins of
orphan sequences [3-5]. Recently we have developed
methods for the global analysis of oligonucleotide usage
(OU) in complete sequences of bacterial chromosomes,
plasmids and phages [6]. The patterns of deviations of oli-

gonucleotide frequencies from expectations were shown
to be genome signatures reflecting to some extent the phylogenetic links between microorganisms [3,4,7,8].
The usage of oligonucleotides in bacterial sequences is not
random. Frequencies of the oligonucleotide words (further – words) depend strongly on their physicochemical
properties such as base stacking energy, propeller twist
angle, bendability, position preference and protein
deformability [6]. Oligonucleotide usage in bacterial
genomes is strongly influenced by codon usage [9],

however, there are further, yet unknown mechanisms of
word selection [10].
To characterize OU in a sequence, the concept of OU patterns has been introduced [6]. Disparity of frequencies of
words and their reverse complements termed as pattern
skew (PS) and variance of oligonucleotide frequencies
(OUV) are attributes of each OU pattern and the distance
(D) expresses the difference between two OU patterns.
These OU parameters are independent of the length of the
sequence and hence allow the comparison of windows of
different sequence length ([6] and see 'Materials and
methods'). This study applied OU statistics to visualize
and discern gene islands of different functional classes.
The developed methods are of importance for structural,
functional and comparative genomics.

Results and discussion
Types of OU patterns, abbreviations and nomenclature
Counts of words of different lengths N from 2 to 7-mer
were analyzed in this work applying different schemes of
normalization. Different types of OU patterns were abbreviated as type_N-mer. Types were "n0" for non-normalized, "n1" for normalized by mononucleotide
frequencies, "n2" for normalized by dinucleotides and so
on. For example, the non-normalized tetranucleotide
usage pattern is denoted as n0_4 mer, trinucleotide usage
pattern normalized by dinucleotides is n2_3 mer, pentanucleotide usage pattern normalized by trinucleotides is
n3_5 mer. Each OU pattern is characterized by three statistical parameters: D – distance between two patterns of
the same type (in this work we used distances D between
local and global genome patterns); PS – pattern skew, distance between the two patterns of the direct and reverse
strands of the same DNA sequence; and OUV – oligonucleotide usage variance. Correspondingly, the nomenclature is as follows: distance between a local n0_4 mer
pattern and the corresponding global pattern – D:n0_4
mer; pattern skew of a n0_3 mer pattern – PS:n0_3 mer;
variance of a n3_7 mer pattern – OUV:n3_7 mer. Two
subtypes of normalization of local OU patterns were
defined: normalized by frequencies of component words
in the current genomic fragment (internal normalization,
i) and in the complete sequence of the genome (global
normalization, g). For example, internal and global OUV
determined for a local n1_4 mer pattern were OUV:n1i_4
mer and OUV:n1g_4 mer, respectively. Internal normalization was always used in this study with the exception of
the chapter "Identification of horizontally transferred elements" where the distances between OUV:n1i_4 mer and
OUV:n1g_4 mer are analyzed. To simplify nomenclature,
the index i was skipped in the pattern type abbreviation in
all other chapters.

OU constraints in bacterial DNA
OUV values of OU patterns from n0_7 mer to n6_7 mer
were calculated for the complete genome sequences of
Bacillus subtilis 168, Escherichia coli K12 and Pseudomonas
putida KT2440 (Fig. 1). OUV of n0_7 mer patterns
depends strongly on GC-content getting minima in
genomes with a GC content of about 50% such as in E. coli
(Fig. 1) and maxima in AT-rich and, especially, GC-rich
organisms, probably because OU is more strongly biased
in GC-rich sequences [6,11]. Normalization of OU by
mononucleotide frequency significantly removes this bias
caused by GC-content (Fig. 1 and see ref. [6]). OUV n1_7
mer, however, is still high (Fig. 1). OUV decreases continuously with increase of the word length of internal normalization getting close to zero for n5 and n6
normalization of heptanucleotide usage (Fig. 1). This
observation suggests that most OU constraints are caused
by mononucleotide frequency and di-, tri- and tetranucleotide combinations while biases in frequencies of longer
oligonucleotide words are probably just an extension of
constraints of shorter component words.
Local variations of OU patterns
To analyze local variations of OU in bacterial genomes,
the sliding window approach was used. 163 bacterial
chromosomes of eubacteria and archaea published in the
NCBI database were analyzed. Local OU patterns were calculated for 8 kb genome fragments with 2 kb sliding windows [6]. Fig. 2 shows the distances D of local n0_4 mer
patterns in three selected bacterial genomes: E. coli K12, P.
putida KT2440 and B. subtilis 168 chromosomes. Genomic
regions termed the 'core sequences' were characterized by
OU patterns being similar to the global pattern of the
chromosome. However, multiple genomic loci with alternative OU patterns that can make up more than 10% of
the whole genome [11] were also detected in the three
tested bacterial genomes (Fig. 2). Locally deviant OU patterns were found to comprise of heterogeneous subsets of
parasitic and recent foreign DNA, ancient genes for ribosomal constituents (RNAs and proteins), multidomain
genes and non-coding sequences with multiple tandem
repeats.

These functionally and evolutionarily unrelated subsets of
atypical genomic loci were differentiated by the other OU
statistical parameters: OUV and PS. These parameters
often exhibited extreme values in detected atypical
regions, however, their profiles were not congruent to
each other. For example, consider the two adjacent gene
islands in the P. putida KT2440 genome from 160 kbp to
240 kbp (Fig. 3). The first region (coordinates 170,815 –
180,000 bp) comprises of two tandem operons for ribosomal RNAs (rrnA-rrnA') [12], while the second 26,045 bp
sequence covers the largest P. putida gene PP0168 encoding the surface adhesion protein [11]. Both regions were

recognized by alternative OU patterns (maximal D:n0_4
mer were 59% and 37.5%, respectively, see Figs. 2 and 3).
Notably, OUV:n1_4 mer has its genomic minimum
(0.08) in the first region but its genomic maximum (0.88)
in the second region, whereas PS:n0_4 mer is maximal
(74.7%) in the first region and it is closer to the average
level (47.5%) in the second region. This example illustrates that the combination of several OU pattern parameters may be useful for the differentiation of unrelated
gene subsets.
The application of this procedure to a whole genome is
shown in Fig. 4 for the cases of P. putida KT2440 and Mycobacterium leprae TN. Dots corresponding to the genome
fragments were plotted in accordance with their D:n0_4
mer, OUV:n1_4 mer and PS:n0_4 mer values. The majority of fragments that represent the core genome clusters in
one area. Three outlier groups detected in P. putida
KT2440 and in the majority of other tested genomes were
termed sections (Fig. 4A). Section I is heterogeneous and
includes long intergenic regions, clusters of short hypothetical genes, laterally transferred elements and genes for
ribosomal RNAs. The OU patterns of section I are charac-

terized by low OUV and high PS. The operons for ribosomal RNAs exhibited the highest PS values (depicted by
red dots, see Fig. 4). Genes for ribosomal proteins are
localized in section II. This separation of ribosomal protein genes from the bulk genome was observed in most
analyzed bacterial chromosomes but in some slow-growing microorganisms such as M. leprae these genes were not
distinct from the core sequence (Fig. 4B). This observation
is consistent with the notion that the codon usage in genes
encoding ribosomal proteins is separate from the rest of
genes in fast-growing bacteria but indistinguishable in
slow-growing bacteria [13]. The differential codon usage
of fast-growing bacteria has the consequence that ribosomal protein mRNA transcripts utilize other tRNA pools
than the other mRNA species for the most abundant
amino acids and hence the synthesis of the translational
machinery is uncoupled from all other translational
demands of the cell [14].
Section III encompasses the regions with outermost OUV
(approximately 3 to 15 standard deviations of genomic
OUV) and locus-specific OU patterns (large D values).
The genetic repertoire covered by these loci is represented

more large multidomain genes of over 4 kbp in length or
non-coding sequences with multiple tandem repeats.
Examples are genes coding for surface proteins (P. putida
KT2440, Staphylococcus aureus N315, Xylella fastidiosa

(Corynebacterium efficiens YS-314) and genes for proteins
with an overrepresentation of a few amino acids (Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)).

Many bacterial chromosomes lack these genetic elements.
It seems that these genes or mulidomain regions are species specific. For example, consider the M. leprae genome
lacking such genetic elements (Fig. 4B) in comparison
with the closely related M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Table 1).
The genetic elements of section III were not observed in
the following tested genomes: Aeropyrum pernix K1, Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58, Aquifex aeolicus VF5, Archaeglobus fulgidus DSM4304, Azoarcus sp. EbN1, Bacillus

Section I is heterogeneous. The genes for ribosomal RNAs
are discerned from the other genes in section I by their
extremely high PS of 60 – 70% that are usually the highest
values in the genome. For further differentiation of the
gene classes in section I, the next chapter describes the
strategy to apply further OU statistical parameters to identify the subgroup of horizontally acquired elements.
Identification of horizontally transferred elements
Identification of laterally acquired elements in chromosomal sequences is of great importance because genomic
islands often comprise pathogenicity and catabolic versatility determinants [15,16]. Two types of normalization of
local OU patterns, – internal and global (see above), –
were applied to visualize horizontally transferred gene
islands within a genome sequence. The reason for introduction of these additional parameters was to improve
the discrimination of foreign inserts in genome
sequences. In core sequences, where the mononucleotide

content is virtually the same as in the complete genome,
results of internal and global normalization are identical
in contrast to the laterally transferred loci characterized by
an alternative mononucleotide content (in terms of GCcontent, G/C-skew and A/T-skew). Correspondingly,
values of OUV:n1i_4 mer and OUV:n1g_4 mer should
merge in core sequences but widely diverge in gene
islands (Fig. 5A). This concept was proven for genomes
with known gene islands: SKIN element in Bacillus subtilis
168 [17], phage related gene islands in P. putida KT2440
[11] and in Salmonella enterica Ty2 [18], pathogenicity
island LEE in E. coli O157:H7 [19], IS-elements, pathogenicity and prophage islands in Shigella flexneri 2457T
[20], ISFtu1 element in Francisella tularensis Schu4 [21],
cag pathogenicity island in Helicobacter pylori 26695 [2]
and 67 kbp gene island in X. fastidiosa 9a5c [22]. All mentioned gene islands were successfully localized from the
comparison of local with global OU patterns, however, no
large foreign regions were observed in sequences of
Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Mesorhizobium loti chromosomes, which both contain large symbiotic gene islands
[23,24]. It looks as if these gene islands had been acquired
a long time ago and hence their OU patterns adapted to

the host genome OU signatures by genome amelioration
[4,25].
An example for the identification of a laterally acquired
gene island is shown in Fig. 5. The island in the chromosome of P. putida KT2440 has significantly divergent
OUV:n1i_4 mer and OUV:n1g_4 mer values and D:n0_4
mer values beyond the 95% confidence interval of the
complete chromosome (Fig. 5A). Since OUV:n1i_nmer
and OUV:n1g_nmer in local patterns and the difference
thereof are automatically calculated by the program, the
method may be used for the high-throughput identification of horizontally transferred elements in bacterial
genomes. Whereas OUV:n1i_4 mer and OUV:n1g_4 mer
values are strongly correlated in the bulk P. putida
genome, all islands show up by high OUV:n1g_4 mer and
low OUV:n1i_4 mer values (Fig. 5B).
Informative assignments of the OU statistical parameters
The objective of our work was to analyze the informative
assignment and applicability of different statistical
parameters of OU. Di-, tri- and tetranucleotide usage patterns are charged with most information content (see Fig.

Figure 6 analysis of the complete sequence of the plasmid pKLC102 by local trinucleotide usage patterns
Structural
Structural analysis of the complete sequence of the plasmid pKLC102 by local trinucleotide usage patterns.
Local OU patterns were analyzed in 1.2 kbp sliding windows with steps of 0.2 kbp. The scale indicates the coordinates of the
plasmid sequence and separates genes by their direction of transcription. Red bars depict protein coding genes and black bars
hypothetical genes. Grey bars along the D and OUV axes depict the 3-sigma ranges of fluctuation of D:n0_3 mer and
OUV:n1_3 mer in a randomly generated sequence of the same length and mononucleotide contents as pKLC102.

fluctuations of OU will vanish. We recommend that the
window should not be longer than 10-fold of its minimal
length. Tetranucleotide (and, sometimes, pentanucleotide) usage patterns are more appropriate for the global
analysis of sequences. A long sliding window silences signals from the local repeats and structural biases at the
level of individual genes so that the characteristics of
whole operons and gene islands become apparent. For a
more detailed analysis of chromosomal loci or short
genomes of bacterial plasmids and phages, tri- and dinucleotide usage patterns may be more appropriate. For
example, in Fig. 6 the mosaic structure of the plasmid
pKLC102 was recovered by investigation of local trinucleotide usage patterns (genomic fragments were segregated
by 1.2 kbp sliding windows in steps of 200 bp). Three
peaks of high D values depict recombination sites of the
plasmid where additional genetic elements (transposons,
integrons and gene cassettes) may be inserted [26]. A
region with extremely high OUV:n1_3 mer corresponds to
the putative replication origin of the plasmid [26].
To check whether the local fluctuations of OU parameters
are statistically valid, a sequence of 100 kbp of
mononucleotide content similar to pKLC102 was randomly generated. The ranges of 3-sigma fluctuation of
D:n0_3 mer and OUV:n1_3 mer in the random sequence

are depicted in Fig. 6 by vertical grey bars along the corresponding D and OUV axes. In the real sequences these values vary over a significantly larger range with the mean
value of D smaller and the mean OUV higher than in the
randomly generated sequence. (The plasmid pKLC102
sequence and the randomly generated sequence are
included in the additional files as examples of source data
files pKLC102.fts and random.fts, respectively.)
Normalization of OU by the internal component words
changes the information assignment of OU biases. The
three parameters D, PS and OUV were calculated for n0_4
mer, n1_4 mer, n2_4 mer and n3_4 mer local patterns for
the pKLC102 genome and a part of the E. coli K12 chromosome from 1 Mbp to 2 Mbp. The former one is an
example of a mosaic genome, and the latter one represents
a regular bacterial chromosome. Correlation coefficients
were calculated for respective OU statistical parameters
determined for non-normalized and normalized local OU
patterns. The correlation coefficients varied between 0.10
and 0.89 for pKLC102 and between 0.46 and 0.94 for E.
coli (Table 2). This data demonstrates that n0, n1, n2 and
n3 of 4 mer local patterns measure different characteristics
of a sequence. In other words, the statistical parameters
with different types of normalization provide non-redundant information that can be exploited for a refined anal-

ysis of genome organization. In case of tetranucleotide
usage analysis four types of patterns exist: n0_4 mer, n1_4
mer, n2_4 mer and n3_4 mer. Each pattern type can be
characterized by three parameters, D, PS and OUV that
provide in total a comprehensive set of 12 non-redundant
parameters for the nucleotide sequence analysis. Moreover, two subtypes of normalized OU patterns were introduced above, – with internal and global normalization, –
that results in a total set of 21 non-redundant tetranucleotide usage statistical parameters each suitable for the
refinement of functional gene classes in a raw nucleotide
sequence.

Conclusion
Bacterial genomes are not homogeneous but contain polymorphic blocks including horizontally transferred gene
islands, non-coding sequences, long multidomain genes
and ancient conserved gene clusters. The structural polymorphism of bacterial genomes may be effectively analyzed by local OU pattern signatures. A set of statistical
approaches has been designed to perform this structural
analysis of nucleotide sequences of bacterial genomes.
These methods are useful for the visualization of regions
with atypical oligonucleotide composition. The
combination of the informative parameters that are 21 in
case of tetranucleotide usage analysis, facilitates the prediction of gene classes. Moreover, many other subtypes of
OU patterns may be additionally introduced. To this end,
OU statistical analysis provides a valuable toolbox for the
functional classification of regions and genes of interest
prior to common-practice gene annotation.
A command line version of the Python program to apply
the OU statistics methods mentioned above is available as
additional file. To run the program, first the Python interpreted language program must be downloaded from the
and
Web-site
http://www.python.org/download/

installed on the computer. The source DNA sequence (or
sequences) should be saved in FASTA format in text file(s)
with .FST file name extensions. Users may choose the OU
statistical parameters to be calculated and the parameters
of the sliding window by setting corresponding command
line arguments. Many different OU parameters may be
determined by a single run of the program and all FST files
in the target folder will be processed continuously in a
batch. For each source data file an output file in TXT
format will be saved in the same folder. The full list of
arguments and description of how to use the program are
documented in the readme.doc file provided in the additional files. The program is fast enough to calculate all set
of OU parameters mentioned in this paper for a complete
bacterial genome of average length in 10–20 min depending on the computer performance.
Several general conclusions about OU in bacteria can be
drawn from this report. First, most OU constraints are
hidden in di-, tri- and tetranucleotide combinations that
vanish with increasing word length (see Fig. 1). For
example, in case of a hexamer the four possible heptamer
words will have the same likelihood to occur next in the
sequence. Hence, i)the analysis of the oligonucleotide
distribution of up to 4-mers is sufficient to uncover all OU
constraints in the sequence; and ii)neighbor effects are
limited to dipeptides so that protein evolution is not
skewed by oligonucleotide biases. Second, D and PS values are correlated in local patterns (see the examples for
D:n0_4 mer and PS:n0_4 mer in Fig. 3 and 4). This observation is in accordance with the general trend in bacterial
sequences to keep parity of frequencies of words and their
reverse complements, in other words- a trend towards
minimal PS [6]. OU parity is most pronounced for the OU
pattern of the whole chromosome, whereas fluctuations
of OU in local patterns lead to an increased PS. The exceptions are the laterally transferred elements with their

island-specific OU signature. In this case, large D values of
the local OU patterns may be associated with low PS (see
blue and green dots in section I in Fig. 4).

Methods
Sequences of 163 bacterial chromosomes including
eubacterial and archaeal genomes published in the NCBI
database [27] were analyzed in this study.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/251

whereby the F values are the observed frequencies of the
particular word of length n in the complete sequence and
ξ is any nucleotide A, T, G or C. The expected count of a
word [ξ1...ξN] of length N in a Lseq long sequence normalized by frequencies of n-mers (n <N) was calculated as
follows:



N −n+1

= Lseq × F[ξ1...ξn ] × ∏ 
i =2 



F[ξi ...ξi + n − 2 ,ξi + n −1]









The OU statistical parameters-variance of word deviations
(OUV); distances between patterns (D); pattern skew
between leading and lagging strand (PS) were calculated
by applying the algorithms described previously [6]. In a
sequence of Lseq nucleotides we calculated numbers of
occurrence of overlapping N-long oligonucleotide words.
There are 4N possible combinations of nucleotides and the
total number of words in a sequence corresponds to the
sequence length Lseq. OU pattern was denoted as a matrix

For further processing of OU statistics, the words were
sorted by their ∆[ξ1...ξN] and the ranks of words instead the
real values of deviations of observed from expected counts
were used. The rank values (from 1 to 256 in the case of
tetranucleotide analysis) were assigned to the words in

of deviations ∆[ξ1...ξ N ] of observed from expected counts
for all possible words of the length N:

accordance with their ∆[ξ1...ξ N ] values by ordering the
words from the most overrepresented one (the greatest

∆[ξ1...ξ N ] = (C[ξ1...ξ N ]|obs − C[ξ1...ξ N ]|e )/ C[ξ1...ξ N ]|0
where ξn is any nucleotide A, T, G or C at the position 1,
2, 3, ... N in the N-long word; C[ξ1...ξN]|obs is the observed
count of the word, [ξ1...ξN]; C[ξ1...ξN]|e is the expected count
and C[ξ1...ξN]|0 is a standard count estimated from the
assumption of an equal distribution of words in the
sequence: ( C[ξ1...ξ N ]|0 = Lseq × 4− N ).
OU parameters of words of length N were normalized by
shorter words n (0 ≤ n <N) as follows:

C[ξ1...ξN ]|n

sequence. Each word of length N can be represented as a
consecutive set of N - n + 1 overlapping component words
of length n. For example, a pentamer ATGGC can be
expressed as a set of 4 overlapping dimers: AT, TG, GG and
GC. In a general case of a N-long word, a component word
[ξ1...ξn] reduces the set of available options for the next
word in the sequence to 4 possible oligonucleotides:
[ξ2...ξn, A], [ξ2...ξn, T], [ξ2...ξn, G] and [ξ2...ξn, C]. The relative frequencies of these words are:
F[ξ2 ...ξn ,ξn+1] × [(F[ξ2 ...ξn ,A] + F[ξ2 ...ξn ,T] + F[ξ2 ...ξn ,G] + F[ξ2 ...ξn ,C] )]−1

X

F[ξi ...ξi + n − 2 , X]

∆[ξ1...ξ N ] . This approach made the OU statistical parameters free from any dependence on the sequence length,
provided that the sequence has a minimum length Lmin so
that in a random sequence of the same length Lmin 95% of
all words of length N occur at least ten times (see above
and [6]). Hence, local OU patterns that meet these
requirements could be compared with the global pattern.
The distance D between two patterns was calculated as the
sum of absolute distances between ranks of identical
words (w, in a total 4N different words) in patterns i and j
as follows:
4N

C[ξ1...ξ N ]|e = C[ξ1...ξ N ]|n if OU is normalized by empirical

∆[ξ1...ξ N ] to the least represented one (the lowest

C[ξ1...ξ N ]|e = C[ξ1...ξ N ]|0 if OU is not normalized, or
frequencies of all shorter words of the length n. The normalization was performed as follows. First at all, we calcu-

PS is a particular case of D where patterns i and j were calculated for the same DNA but for direct and reversed
strands, respectively. Dmax = 4N(4N - 1)/2 and Dmin = 0
when calculating a D, or, in a case of PS calculation, Dmin
= 4N if N is an odd number or Dmin = 4N - 2N if N is an even
number [6].
The definition of OUV was provided in our previous
paper [6].
The random sequence was generated by a in-house program using the Python randomizer [28].
