alfalfa and sugar beet rhizospheres investigated
by comparative transcriptomics

Abstract
Background: The rhizosphere is the microbe-rich zone around plant roots and is a key determinant of the
biosphere’s productivity. Comparative transcriptomics was used to investigate general and plant-specific
adaptations during rhizosphere colonization. Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae was grown in the rhizospheres
of pea (its legume nodulation host), alfalfa (a non-host legume) and sugar beet (non-legume). Gene expression
data were compared to metabolic and transportome maps to understand adaptation to the rhizosphere.
Results: Carbon metabolism was dominated by organic acids, with a strong bias towards aromatic amino acids, C1
and C2 compounds. This was confirmed by induction of the glyoxylate cycle required for C2 metabolism and
gluconeogenesis in all rhizospheres. Gluconeogenesis is repressed in R. leguminosarum by sugars, suggesting that
although numerous sugar and putative complex carbohydrate transport systems are induced in the rhizosphere,
they are less important carbon sources than organic acids. A common core of rhizosphere-induced genes was
identified, of which 66% are of unknown function. Many genes were induced in the rhizosphere of the legumes,
but not sugar beet, and several were plant specific. The plasmid pRL8 can be considered pea rhizosphere specific,
enabling adaptation of R. leguminosarum to its host. Mutation of many of the up-regulated genes reduced
competitiveness for pea rhizosphere colonization, while two genes specifically up-regulated in the pea rhizosphere
reduced colonization of the pea but not alfalfa rhizosphere.
Conclusions: Comparative transcriptome analysis has enabled differentiation between factors conserved across
plants for rhizosphere colonization as well as identification of exquisite specific adaptation to host plants.

Background
Interactions between micro-organisms and plant roots
in the rhizosphere are a key determinant of plant productivity. There is a two-way dialogue in which plants
manipulate the rhizosphere’s microbial community,
which, in turn, profoundly alters plant growth [1]. Plants
exude up to 11% of fixed carbon via their roots, including both small organic compounds and those that act as
signaling molecules [2]. Carbon export on this scale
must have a significant impact on rhizosphere microorganisms, leading to alterations in community structure
and function. The rhizosphere is an environment in
which there are co-evolved mutualistic relationships

between plants and microbes [1]. The best characterized
beneficial associations are mutualisms with Rhizobium
and mycorrhizae, but many other bacteria promote
plant growth [1].
The symbiosis between rhizobia and legume hosts has
been studied in great detail because their reduction of
atmospheric N 2 to ammonium is one of the largest
inputs of available nitrogen into the biosphere [3]. Colonization of legume roots by rhizobia induces development of root nodules; in most studied systems, plantreleased flavonoids induce rhizobia to synthesize lipochitooligosaccharide Nod factors, which induce root hair
deformation and nodule morphogenesis [3]. Rhizobia
are entrapped by curling root hairs and induce the plant
to form infection threads that grow through the root
hair and root cortical cells, leading to nodule formation.
Bacteria are released from infection threads by

endocytosis and surrounded by a plant membrane that
controls exchange of carbon and nitrogen between the
plant cytosol and rhizobia [4]. Despite detailed knowledge of root hair infection and nodule formation in
legumes, little is known about the critical steps of rhizosphere colonization. By comparing Rhizobium leguminosarum colonization of the rhizosphere of its host legume
with that of a non-host legume and a non-legume, we
have been able, for the first time, to draw general conclusions about life in the plant rhizosphere as well as
examine specific adaptation to a legume host.

Results and discussion
Rhizobia provide a special advantage when studying the
plant rhizosphere as bacterial responses can be investigated during colonization of the rhizosphere of a specific host legume (for example, pea), a non-host legume
(alfalfa) and a non-legume (sugar beet). In addition, we
are able to chart metabolic activity in the rhizosphere by
comparison to the Sinorhizobium meliloti transportome,
which comprises a large induction map for 76 identified

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transport systems in rhizobia [5]. This induction map was extended in this study
with a series of microarrays of free-living cultures grown
on a variety of metabolites (Table 1).
At the start of this study three variables were compared: (i) length of incubation of bacteria in the rhizosphere (bacteria harvested at 1, 3 and 7 days postinoculation (dpi) of 7-day-old pea plants (Table 1; Additional file 1)); (ii) age of the plant (bacteria harvested at
1 dpi of 7-, 14- and 21-day-old pea plants (Table 1;
Additional file 2)); (iii) level of bacterial inoculum (103
or 108 colony forming units (CFU; 7 dpi of 7-day-old
peas); Table 1; Additional file 3).
Incubating bacteria in the pea rhizosphere for 7 dpi
was chosen as the standard incubation because it gave
the highest number of three-fold or more differentially
regulated genes (7 dpi (764) > 3 dpi (682) > 1 dpi (638);
Additional file 1). Seven-day-old plants were chosen
because this gave the largest number of three-fold or
more differentially regulated genes (7-day-old plants

Microarrays comparing growth on acetate, acetoacetate, inositol, succinate, glucose and pyruvate as carbon sources have been published previously [8]. All
carbon sources were 10 mM, except pyruvate (30 mM), protocatechuate (3 mM), 4-hydroxybenzoate (3 mM), phenylalanine (5 mM), formate (40 mM) and
arabinogalactan (10 mg/ml). aWhere two or more accession numbers are given they form part of different time courses. Inoculation of all rhizospheres was
performed with 108 CFU unless otherwise stated.

Additional files 4 and 5). Thus, the results of two independent methods could be compared.
Increased gene expression was classified as general
(that is, elevated in all plant rhizospheres) or specific,
either for the rhizospheres of legumes or individual
plant species (Additional files 4 and 6). Seventy of the
106 genes up-regulated in all rhizospheres tested compared to glucose-grown bacteria (Additional files 4 and
7) are annotated as hypothetical (compared to 27% of
the genome); even permitting for a degree of mis-annotation, this suggests synthesis of proteins of novel function. A similar observation has been made for
Pseudomonas [6]. As our purpose was to integrate information about metabolism and cellular function in the
rhizosphere, we have avoided a tedious list of genes and
instead distilled key features of bacterial life in the rhizosphere into diagrams for membrane transport
(Figure 1), metabolism (Figure 2) and cellular activities
(Figure 3) (data in Additional file 8).
In order to determine the importance of bacterial genes
up-regulated in the rhizosphere, competition assays were

(635) > 21-day-old (441) > 14-day-old (171); Additional
file 2). In addition, 138 genes were specifically up-regulated in 7-day-old pea plants (Additional file 2), including many genes of interest (for example, rhi genes
pRL10169-171, cinI (RL3378) and nod genes
pRL100180, pRL100183, pRL100186-188), which we
assume are induced by young, fast growing roots but
not by those of older plants. An inoculum of 108 CFU
rhizobia was chosen because it resulted in more differentially expressed genes (Additional file 3) and RNA
recovery was more reliable.
With the standard conditions established R. leguminosarum bv. viciae Rlv3841 was inoculated at 108 CFU into
the rhizosphere of 7-day-old pea, alfalfa or sugar beet
plants and bacteria harvested 7 dpi. The gene induction
pattern was compared against glucose-grown laboratory
cultures, leading to an indirect comparison of rhizospheres
(Table 1; Additional file 4). By contrast, relative levels of
gene induction were also directly compared from bacteria
isolated from the rhizospheres of two different plants (that
is, pea:alfalfa, pea:sugar beet and alfalfa:sugar beet; Table 1;

Figure 2 Rhizosphere-induced genes in Rlv3841 metabolic pathways. Bold lines show reactions encoded by genes induced (by three-fold
or more, P ≤ 0.05) and are color coded for the rhizospheres: black, all; green, pea-specific; red, alfalfa-specific; blue, legume-specific; purple, alfalfa
and sugar beet. An induced gene is also considered to be elevated in further rhizospheres where expression was elevated by two-fold or more
(Additional file 8). Where more than one enzyme carries out a reaction the color reflects the gene elevated in most rhizospheres. Asterisks
indicate compounds imported by a transport system whose expression was elevated (Figure 1). aGenes are part of an induced operon and
elevated ≥ 1.3-fold; bgenes induced ≥ 3-fold, P ≤ 0.11; cgenes elevated ≥ 2.2-fold, P ≤ 0.05. Dotted lines and boxed genes show those downregulated (≤ 0.3-fold, P ≤ 0.05) relative to glucose-grown cells. Expression is considered to be down-regulated in all rhizospheres if ≤ 0.5-fold.
Reactions carried out by genes slightly down-regulated (0.4- to 0.8-fold; Additional file 8) are shown by a thin grey line. The dichloroethane
pathway shown in italics is speculative. Genes underlined have been mutated and results of their competitiveness in the rhizosphere are shown

performed in the pea rhizosphere between wild-type
Rlv3841 and 46 strains, each mutated in one of these upregulated genes (Additional file 8). These genes were
chosen after the initial screen of genes up-regulated in
the pea rhizosphere versus glucose grown laboratory cultures. Pea was used because it is the host plant for R.
leguminosarum. However, two mutants were also tested
in both pea and alfalfa rhizospheres because subsequent
gene expression analysis showed they are specifically upregulated in the pea rhizosphere. In these mutants it
would be expected that any impairment in competition
would be restricted to the pea rhizosphere. Mutants were
scored with a rhizosphere colonization index (RCI); as
described in Materials and methods, a RCI of 1 indicates
equal competitiveness with Rlv3841, and the lower the
RCI (down to 0.35), the less able the strain is to compete
with Rlv3841 (Additional file 8). Thus, a low RCI indicates that the mutation is in a gene that is important for
the strain to colonize the rhizosphere.
General adaptation to the rhizosphere: cellular factors

Genes induced in all three plant rhizospheres reflect
general life in the rhizosphere and we consider these

before examining responses specific to one plant
(Additional file 7). They include elevated expression of
rhiABC (pRL100169-171) and rhiI (pRL100164), previously described as rhizosphere-induced genes [7],
and the gene for autoinducer synthesis protein CinI
(RL3378), which is involved in coordinating quorumsensing regulation and biofilm formation (Figure 3).
Quorum sensing is likely to be important in rhizosphere biology, where bacterial attachment is a key
step in root colonization [7]. Expression of genes
encoding an alternative aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase
complex (RL3041-45) and a possibly associated cytochrome c (RL3046) were induced in the rhizosphere
(Figure 3). This rhizosphere-induced cytochrome pathway, which is distinct from both the normal cytochrome aa 3 complex found in laboratory cultured
bacteria and the high affinity cytochrome cbb3 complex
found in the N 2 -fixing nodule form of rhizobia [8],
suggests a distinct redox environment in the rhizosphere. It may be that in the rhizosphere the level of
available oxygen is lower than in shaken laboratory
culture but higher than in the microaerophilic conditions found inside legume nodules.

General adaptation to the rhizosphere: metabolism and
transport

Up-regulation of genes encoding C4-dicarboxylate transport protein, DctA (RL3424; Figure 1), and PEP carboxykinase, PckA (RL0037; Figure 2), reveals increased
organic acid metabolism in the rhizosphere. Induction
of pckA is required for gluconeogenesis and indicates
sugar synthesis. R. leguminosarum represses pckA when
grown on organic acids with added sugar [9] so while
sugars are present in the rhizosphere (that is, based on
induction of sugar transporters), central metabolism is
almost certainly dominated by catabolism of organic
acids. Soils are rich in organic acids and they are the
main carbon sources in the tomato rhizosphere [10].
Mutations in both dctA (RL3424) and pckA (RL0037)
decreased the ability of R. leguminosarum to compete in
the pea rhizosphere as shown by RCIs of 0.65 and 0.57,
respectively (Additional file 8).
The glyoxylate cycle was induced showing that short
chain (C2) organic acids are catabolized (Figure 2). C1
metabolism is important based on the induction of
NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (RL4391-3) in
all rhizospheres (Figure 2). Formate induced this operon
in a laboratory culture of Rlv3841 (Additional file 9) and
is a carbon source for autotrophic growth of S. meliloti

[11]. Formate dehydrogenase (RL4391-3) requires a Mo
cofactor and the gene encoding MoaA2 (RL2711),
involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, showed
elevated expression (Figure 2). Mutation of moaA2
(RL2711) resulted in a RCI of 0.73 in the pea rhizosphere (Additional file 8). In addition, in all the rhizospheres tested there was induction of an ABC
transporter solute binding protein (SBP; RL3040) from
the MolT (molybdate transporter) family (ABC families
are according to Saier [12]), which is likely to be part of
an uptake system for molybdate (Figure 1; Additional
file 10).
Aromatic compounds are important precursors or
breakdown products of many plant compounds and can
be used as a source of carbon by rhizosphere bacteria.
Their presence in the rhizosphere is illustrated by
induction of genes encoding transport systems for
uptake of shikimate and protocatechuate. Shikimate is
taken up by a multi-facilitator super-family (MFS) transporter (RL4709). Protocatechuate is imported by a
TRAP transporter (pRL120499-pRL120500; Figure 1),
which was identified by high level induction of
pRL120498-500 in microarrays of cells grown in the
presence of protocatechuate (Additional files 2 and 5).
In the pea rhizosphere, mutation of pRL120500 led to a
RCI of 0.72 (Additional file 8). Catabolism of aromatic
compounds has also been shown to be important for
Pseudomonas putida in the rhizosphere of Zea mays
[13].
One of the strongest general metabolic responses in
the rhizosphere was induction of genes encoding proteins involved in catabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine (RL1860-6; Figure 2). These genes were also
induced in free-living cells grown on phenylalanine
(Additional file 9). The presence of phenylalanine in the
rhizosphere probably results from its important role as a
precursor for lignin synthesis by roots. Mutation of two
genes encoding enzymes on this phenylalanine breakdown pathway (RL1860 and RL1863; Figure 2) led to
two of the largest reductions in pea rhizosphere competitiveness (RCIs of 0.42 and 0.45, respectively; Additional
file 8).
Common to all rhizospheres was induction of genes
for uptake systems for inositol (IntA, RL4655) [8,14]
and sorbitol/mannitol/dulcitol (MtlE, RL4218). Also elevated were genes encoding components of two previously uncharacterized systems. The first, RL3840,
encodes a CUT1 (carbohydrate uptake transporter 1)
family SBP likely to transport raffinose, melibiose and
lactose based on 91% identity to SMb20931 from S.
meliloti, whose expression was induced by these sugars
[5]. The second, pRL110281, which encodes a PepT
(peptide/opine/nickel transporter) family SBP, is clearly
important in the pea rhizosphere since mutation of the

Ramachandran et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R106
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R106

gene led to a RCI of 0.44 (Additional file 8). The contiguous gene, pRL110282, encodes a product with putative
a-N-arabinofuranosidase activity that could be responsible for removing arabinose subunits from arabinan.
Based on this proximity, pRL110281 may import the
arabinose polymer arabinan, or an oligosaccharide
derived from it. Indeed, pRL110281 is unlikely to transport arabinose as its gene was not induced in laboratory
cultures grown on arabinose (Additional file 9). Growth
on arabinose did cause induction of genes encoding
components of CUT2-family transporters, RL3615-6 and
RL2377-8 (Additional files 9 and 10), neither of which
was elevated in the rhizospheres tested.
Co-induction of transport systems and metabolic
pathways provides additional evidence of the presence
of a compound in the rhizosphere. The gene encoding
mannitol dehydrogenase (MalK, RL4214), which converts mannitol to fructose, was elevated (Figure 2) along
with those of a mannitol uptake system (MtlE, RL4218;
Figure 1). Although intA (RL4655), encoding the myoinositol transporter, was induced, genes for inositol catabolism were not. Induction of uptake genes may occur
at lower substrate concentrations than for catabolic
genes, and there are many examples in our data where
catabolic genes were less induced than corresponding
transport genes.
The genes encoding a CUT1 family ABC system
(RL3860-2) were induced in all rhizospheres and
although the solute specificity of this system is
unknown, it clearly has a role in the pea rhizosphere as
a mutation in RL3860 led to a RCI of 0.58 (Additional
file 8). The transporter genes are surrounded by genes
encoding predicted mandelate racemase/muconate lactonising proteins (RL3858, RL3864-66), a family of
enzymes involved in breakdown of lignin-derived aromatic compounds, protocatechuate and catechol to
intermediates of the citric acid cycle via the b-ketoadipate pathway. Although the transport genes were
induced in all rhizospheres, of the genes encoding lignin
breakdown enzymes only RL3864 was slightly elevated
in the alfalfa rhizosphere (1.5-fold, P ≤ 0.05) and
RL3866 in the pea rhizosphere (1.4-fold, P ≤ 0.05).
Examination of ABC transporters with unknown
solute-specificity shows that 11 genes encoding CUT1
transporters were induced in plant rhizospheres (Figure
1). An increase of expression of CUT1 systems, which
usually import oligosaccharides and their derivatives, is
consistent with the presence in the rhizosphere of many
different poly- and oligosaccharides. In addition, some
members of the PepT class also transport oligosaccharides - for example, the a-galactoside (Agp) transporter
(pRL110243; Figure 1) [15]. Genes for five PepT transporters were induced in these rhizospheres, with three
of unknown solute-specificity induced only in the alfalfa

rhizosphere (pRL90101, pRL120243 and pRL120609-10;
Figure 1). This work supports the hypothesis that the
large increase in the number of high-affinity ABC systems in rhizobia (and other a-proteobacteria) results
from selective adaptation to the oligotrophic nature of
soil and the rhizosphere.
General adaptation to the rhizosphere: dealing with
adversity

Plants produce antimicrobial agents (for example, phytoalexins) that bacteria must degrade or export. Plantmade antimicrobials such as halogenated hydrocarbons
(for example, dichloroethane) could be dealt with by
induction of RL4047 and RL4267, whose products may
catalyze conversion of dichloroethane via chloroacetic
acid to glycolate, with further degradation by the glyoxylate cycle (Figure 2). RL4267 shows 84% identity to a
Xanthobacter autotropicus enzyme involved in 1,2dichloroethane degradation [16]. Mutation of RL4267
resulted in a strain with reduced competitiveness in the
pea rhizosphere (RCI = 0.47; Additional file 8). There
have been descriptions of other haloalkanoate dehalogenases in Rhizobium sp. [17], suggesting halogenated
hydrocarbons may act as antimicrobials around roots.
In addition to metabolic detoxification, expression of
the multi-drug resistance (MDR) family efflux pump
encoded by rmrA (pRL90059) was elevated (Figure 1).
RmrA is a membrane fusion protein whose role is typically to dock an inner membrane exporter to a TolClike protein that spans the periplasm and outer membrane. An R. etli rmrA mutant produced 40% less
nodules on bean roots and had increased sensitivity to
phytoalexins, flavonoids and salicylic acid [18]. Another
membrane fusion protein elevated in all rhizospheres is
encoded by RL4274, a RND (resistance-nodulation-cell
division) multi-drug exporter (Figure 1). The importance
of this system in the pea rhizosphere is demonstrated by
a mutant of RL4274 having a RCI of 0.57 (Additional
file 8).
Maintaining the correct osmotic environment is
important for bacteria in any situation. In all rhizospheres there was elevated expression of ndvA (RL4640).
NdvA is responsible for export of cyclic b-1-2-glucan to
the bacterial periplasm and important in rhizobia for
hypoosmotic regulation [19] (Figure 1). Expression of
RL1908, encoding a small-conductance mechanosensitive ion channel (MscS), was also elevated in the rhizospheres examined (Figure 1) and is important in
osmotic homeostasis. This suggests that the test microcosm was mildly hypoosmotic.
Elevation of expression of genes involved in response
to stress occurred in all rhizospheres (Figure 3). Mutation of RL3982 and RL4265 (msrB), which encode general- and oxidative-stress proteins, reduced pea

Ramachandran et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R106
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R106

rhizosphere competitiveness (RCIs of 0.52 and 0.55,
respectively; Additional file 8). Some of the largest
effects on ability to compete in rhizospheres were
shown by mutation of genes encoding proteins of
unknown function; the photo reaction centre (PRC)
family protein RL0913 and flavoprotein RL3366 had
RCIs of 0.42 and 0.43, respectively, in the pea rhizosphere (Additional file 8). Mutation of RL2946, encoding
part of a two-component sensor regulator (Figure 3), led
to a RCI of 0.59 in the pea rhizosphere (Additional file
8).
Specific adaptation to legume rhizospheres

The largest class of genes induced only in legume rhizospheres were the nod genes (nodABCEFIJLMNO),
required for synthesis and export of nodulation factors
(Figure 3). This acts as an exquisite internal control
since nodulation factors are specifically induced in
response to secretion of flavonoids by legumes [3].
There is also a legume rhizosphere-specific transporter
encoded by pRL90085 (Figure 1) shown to be important
in the pea rhizosphere as mutation led to a RCI of 0.52
(Additional file 8). Although the solute is unknown, it is
probably a monosaccharide, as pRL90085 is in the
CUT2 family.
Specific adaptation to the pea rhizosphere

Fold elevation of expression

Increased expression of genes encoding enzymes of the
glyoxylate cycle (RL0054, RL0866) only occurred in the
pea rhizosphere. RL0054 (malate synthase) forms malate
from glyoxylate and acetyl CoA while GlcF (RL0866)
probably converts glycolate to glyoxylate (Figure 2).
Thus, while C2 metabolism is elevated in all

Page 7 of 12

rhizospheres, it is particularly important in that of pea.
Curiously, although the gene for isocitrate lyase
(RL0761, aceA) was up-regulated in both alfalfa and
sugar beet rhizospheres, indicating elevated C2 metabolism, expression of RL0054, encoding malate synthase,
was only elevated in that of pea (Figure 2).
The gene for MFS transporter of tartrate (RL0996)
was induced by three-fold or more in the pea rhizosphere (Figure 1; Additional file 7) while that for tartrate
dehydrogenase (RL0995), which converts tartrate to oxaloglycolate for metabolism by the glyoxylate cycle, was
only induced by legumes [20] (Figure 2). Mutation of
RL0996, encoding the tartrate transporter, led to the largest effect on ability to compete in the pea rhizosphere
(RCI = 0.35; Additional file 8). RL0996 was also induced
1.5-fold in the alfalfa rhizosphere, so although this falls
below our two-fold cutoff, it suggests tartrate utilization
may be important in legume rhizospheres (Additional
file 8). However, tartrate may be more generally important as in Agrobacterium vitis the ability to utilize tartrate offered a selective advantage for growth on
grapevine [21].
The importance of pRL8 in the pea rhizosphere

R. leguminosarum Rlv3841 has a chromosome and six
plasmids designated pRL7-pRL12, with pRL10 containing most nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes [22].
Although pea rhizosphere-induced genes from different
parts of the genome have been discussed above, many
genes on pRL8 are specifically up-regulated in the pea
rhizosphere (Figure 4; Additional file 6). Indeed, 37%
(11 genes) of the 30 genes elevated by three-fold or
more specifically in the pea rhizosphere (using both

http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R106

direct and indirect comparisons (Additional file 7)) are
encoded on pRL8. With a threshold of up-regulation of
two-fold or more (P ≤ 0.05), then 21 genes on pRL8 are
pea rhizosphere-specific (15% of all genes on pRL8). By
comparison, only three and two genes on pRL8 were
up-regulated in alfalfa and sugar beet rhizospheres,
respectively, and two genes were up-regulated in the
legume rhizosphere. Since plasmid pRL8 is conjugative
[22], it can easily transfer between rhizobia. Consistent
with its heavy bias to genes important in the pea rhizosphere, pRL8 shows little colinearity (< 5%) with other
sequenced rhizobial genomes [23]. BLAST analysis
shows that of its 142 genes, 25% are found only in R.
leguminosarum bv viciae and a further 42% are specific
to rhizobia or related a-proteobacteria.
Genes on pRL8 that are pea rhizosphere-specific
include a molybdenum-containing xanthine dehydrogenase-like carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, CoxMSL
(pRL80023-25), together with accessory protein CoxG
(pRL80021). Nearby are genes for proteins that may be
involved in maturation of this complex: proteins
involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis (pRL80034 and
pRL80033 encode MoaA and MoeA-like proteins,
respectively) and CoxI (pRL80038), which is needed for
insertion of a molydopterin cofactor into a xanthine
dehydrogenase. However, while CoxMSL (pRL80023-25)
may be able to catalyze CO conversion to CO2 (Figure
2), in phylogenetic clustering these proteins form a
separate clade from the biochemically characterized CO
dehydrogenases, including one from Bradyrhizobium
japonicum [24]. Mutation of pRL80021 (coxG) and
pRL80023 (coxM) resulted in reduced competitiveness
in the pea rhizosphere (RCIs of 0.44 and 0.73, respectively; Additional file 8). Since pRL80021 is up-regulated
only in the pea rhizosphere, its mutation did not result
in reduced competitiveness in the alfalfa rhizosphere
(RCI = 0.97; Additional file 8).
Homoserine is abundant in pea root mucilage and can
be utilized as a carbon source by R. leguminosarum [25].
Although the genes involved in catabolism of homoserine
are uncharacterized in Rlv3841, pRL80071, which
encodes a putative homoserine dehydrogenase (which
catalyses conversion of homoserine to L-aspartate-semialdehyde), was specifically up-regulated in the pea rhizosphere (Figure 2).
Tryptophan is probably available in the rhizosphere
[26]. The gene encoding N-formylkynurenine formidase
(pRL80036) was six- to ten-fold elevated in the pea rhizosphere (Figure 4). It catalyzes release of formate and
kynurenine from N-formylkynurenine, formed after the
first step in tryptophan catabolism. The formate produced might be further metabolized to CO2 by a NAD
+
-containing short-chain dehydrogenase encoded by

Page 8 of 12

pRL80037, whose expression is 2.5- to 3.5-fold elevated
(Figure 4).
Mimosine (b-3-hydroxy-4 pyridone amino acid), a
toxic amino acid related to tyrosine, is produced by the
tree-legume leucaena, which is nodulated by Rhizobium
sp. TAL1145. Rhizobium sp. TAL1145 has a specific
ABC importer for mimosine (MidABC) and an aminotransferase responsible for its degradation (MidD) [27].
An ABC importer (encoded by pRL80060/pRL80063-4;
Figure 1), which shows 44 to 79% identity to MidABC
[27], was induced in the pea rhizosphere. However,
there is no protein in Rlv3841 with > 27% identity to
the aminotransferase required for mimosine degradation.
While the transporter encoded by pRL80060/pRL800634 is unlikely to transport mimosine, it may transport a
similar amino acid. Expression of this system was also
elevated in 7-day-old pea bacteroids [8]; thus, it may
have a role in the symbiotic interaction between
Rlv3841 and pea.
Also elevated specifically in pea rhizospheres were
pRL80026-30, which encode proteins belonging to the
HAAT (hydrophobic amino acid transporter) ABC family
(Figure 1). Despite the fact that this transporter has been
annotated as a LIV (leucine, isoleucine, valine) system, it
could transport one or more aromatic amino acid(s) or
homoserine. Mutation of pRL80026 resulted in a RCI of
0.69 in the pea rhizosphere (Additional file 8).
Dealing with adversity in the pea rhizosphere

Export of plant toxins is likely to be important for successful growth in the rhizosphere. The gene encoding the
RND family exporter RL4274 was induced 3.5- to 2.8fold in the rhizospheres of alfalfa and sugar beet and 135fold (P ≤ 0.05) in pea (Figure 1). In addition, secDF2
(RL0680) encodes a membrane protein specifically
induced to a very high level only in the pea rhizosphere
(> 100-fold, P ≤ 0.05; Figure 1). SecDF homologues
belong to the RND exporter superfamily and RL0680
may participate in metabolite rather than protein export.
It is clear that SecDF2 has a key role affecting competitiveness in the pea rhizosphere since a mutant in this
gene had a RCI of 0.45 (Additional file 8). In contrast, in
the alfalfa rhizosphere the same mutant had a RCI of
0.97 (Additional file 8), showing that mutation of secDF2
has no significant effect on its ability to compete with
Rlv3841in the alfalfa rhizosphere.
The mildly hypoosmotic nature of the general rhizosphere microcosm was revealed by the induction of genes
encoding cyclic b-1-2-glucan exporter (NdvA, RL4640)
and a mechanosensitive ion channel (MscS, RL1908)
(Figure 1). In addition, the gene for a second MscS
(RL1522) was specifically induced in the pea rhizosphere
(Figure 1), presumably fine-tuning the osmotic response.

Ramachandran et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R106
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R106

Specific adaptation to the alfalfa rhizosphere

A dicarboxylate may be a key carbon source in the
alfalfa rhizosphere since genes for the malonate transporter (MatC, RL0992; Figure 1) and enzymes for malonate metabolism to acetyl CoA (MatA, RL0990, and
MatB, RL0991; Figure 2) were induced. Alternatively,
the malonate present in the alfalfa rhizosphere may
need to be detoxified as it can act as an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase.
Canavanine is a toxic amino acid analogue of arginine
found in seeds and exudates of leguminous plants [28].
The canavanine exporter MsiA from Mesorhizobium
tianshanense shows 97% identity with RL2856. In
Rlv3841, expression of RL2856 was specifically elevated
in the alfalfa rhizosphere (Figure 1). Canavanine comprises 0.6 to 1.6% of the dry weight of alfalfa seeds and
restricts growth of bacteria [28]. MsiA (RL2856) was
slightly induced in vetch bacteroids (3.2-fold, P = 0.07)
[8], suggesting that vetch releases some canavanine.
MsiA is important for attachment to root hairs and survival in rhizospheres of canavanine-producing legumes
[29]. The ability to deal with toxic canavanine may
enable selection of MsiA-producing bacteria by these
leguminous plants.
RL2720 encodes a CUT2 family SBP specifically
induced in the alfalfa rhizosphere (Figure 1). From the
up-regulation of expression of RL2720-2 (4- to 25-fold)
in microarrays of cells grown in the presence of arabinogalactan (Additional file 9), this cluster of genes may
encode an arabinogalactan transporter (Additional file
10). In addition, this gene cluster encodes two transketolases (RL2718-19). Expression of RL2719 was elevated
(12-fold) in the alfalfa rhizosphere (Additional file 7), as
was that of a short chain dehydrogenase (RL2725). The
proteins encoded by these genes may have a role in arabinogalactan metabolism. These genes were not elevated
in microarrays of cells grown on galactose or arabinose
(Additional file 9), indicating a response only to the
polysaccharide or to oligosaccharide break-down products (and not the monosaccharide constituents) of
arabinogalactan.
Specific adaptation to the sugar beet rhizosphere

Comparative analysis reveals that the sugar beet rhizosphere is N-limited. Expression of genes encoding glutamine synthetase II (GlnII, RL3549), the NH 4 +
transporter AmtB (RL4564) (Figure 1) and PAAT (polar
amino acid transporter) family importer pRL120079
(Figure 1) was elevated, as they were in all N-limited
microarrays (Additional files 7 and 9). As these experiments were deliberately conducted in N-free plant
growth medium, it is not surprising that the sugar beet
rhizosphere was N-limited. However, legume rhizospheres were not N-limited, indicating release of

Page 9 of 12

nitrogen into the rhizosphere, possibly specifically
because rhizobia were present.
Response to root secretions compared with growth in the
rhizosphere

As useful information about how micro-organisms
respond to the rhizosphere can be obtained by incubating bacteria in root secretions [6], bacterial responses to
constituent components were measured (Table 1). Pea
root exudate was added to liquid-grown cells and microarray analysis showed 21 genes elevated by ≥ 3-fold (P ≤
0.05), 18 of which were also elevated by growth in medium containing the flavonoid hesperetin (27 genes elevated ≥ 3-fold, P ≤ 0.05) (Additional file 6). Common
induced genes, in addition to the nod and rhi gene clusters on pRL10 (nodABCEFIJLMNO and rhiIABC),
include RL2418, encoding a CUT1 ABC transporter
(and also induced three-fold or more in all rhizospheres
and in the presence of acetoacetate, hydroxybenzoate
and protocatechuate) (Additional files 6 and 9). Expression of RL2418 is clearly important for pea rhizosphere
growth as a mutant showed much reduced competitiveness with Rlv3841 in the pea rhizosphere (RCI 0.43;
Additional file 8).
Genes elevated under these two conditions (root exudate and hesperetin) form only a small proportion of
those elevated in plant rhizospheres. One reason is that
root secretions are very dilute and only induce genes
responsive to low concentrations of bioactive compounds (for example, nod genes). Furthermore, growth
in the rhizosphere involves a far more complex series of
interactions, including attachment to roots, biofilm formation, contact with a complex array of plant macromolecules and cell-cell competition.

Conclusions
Overall, the comparative transcriptome approach used
here has revealed bacterial responses common to different plant rhizospheres, as well as mapping key general
responses such as organic acid, C1-C2 and aromatic
amino acid metabolism. In addition, it has highlighted
specific bacterial adaptations to individual plants species
and enabled identification of specific detoxification systems, such as that for canavanine in the alfalfa rhizosphere. Mutation of two genes (RL0680 and pRL80021)
specifically induced in the pea rhizosphere only reduced
competitiveness in the pea and not the alfalfa rhizosphere. A dramatic observation is the large number of
genes located on plasmid pRL8 that are specifically
induced in the pea rhizosphere. This is particularly
exciting and suggests there may be a wealth of plant rhizosphere-specific plasmids or chromosomal islands to be
revealed by emerging high-throughput sequencing
projects.

Materials and methods
Bacterial and plant growth

R. leguminosarum strains were grown either in tryptone
yeast [30] or acid minimal salts as described [31].
Strains, plasmids and oligonucleotide primers are
described in Additional file 11. Seeds of pea (Pisum
sativa cv Avola), alfalfa (Medicago sativa) or sugar beet
(Beta vulgaris) were surface sterilized and grown in 50
ml Falcon tubes containing autoclaved washed vermiculite and N-free rooting solution [32]. Growth was at 23°
C with a 16-h/8-h light/dark cycle for 7, 14 or 21 days
before inoculation with Rlv3841 (103 or 108 CFU). After
1, 3 and 7 days shoots were removed and roots vortexed
(5 minutes) in 6 ml sterile water and 12 ml RNA Protect
(Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK). Insoluble material
was removed by filtration through four layers of sterile
muslin and centrifugation (160 × g, 1 minute, 4°C). Bacteria were recovered by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10
minutes, 4°C) and re-suspended (200 μL 10 mM TrisHCl, pH 8).
RNA isolation and microarray analysis

Total RNA was extracted, quantified, amplified and
hybridized to microarrays as described previously [8].
Results were analyzed using GeneSpring 7.2. (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as described previously [8]. In brief, labeling, hybridization and scanning
were as previously described, spot recognition was performed with Bluefuse (BlueGnome Limited, Cambridge,
UK) and data were imported into GeneSpring 7.2 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood, CA, USA). The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each
spot and a Lowess normalization applied to the slide.
Log ratios of expression and P-values were determined
in GeneSpring 7.2. To establish a standard technique for
sampling (that is, pea plant age on inoculation, harvest
time dpi, inoculum size) preliminary experiments were
performed (Table 1). Pea plant age was varied over 7, 14
and 21 days with bacterial harvest at 1 dpi (Additional
file 1). Following inoculation of 7-day-old peas, the bacterial harvest was assessed at 1, 3 and 7 dpi (Additional
file 2). The effect of Rlv3841 inoculum size (103 versus
108 CFU) was analyzed at 7 dpi of 7-day-old peas (EMEXP-2854) (Table 1; Additional file 3). Standard conditions established were inoculation of 7-day-old plants
with 108 CFU followed by bacterial harvest at 7 dpi.
Using the standard assay conditions, the first method
used to compare rhizospheres was microarray analysis
of bacteria grown in a rhizosphere (that of pea, alfalfa or
sugar beet) against glucose-grown laboratory cultures
(leading to an indirect comparison between rhizospheres). Five independent biological replicates were
used for pea and three for alfalfa and sugar beet

Page 10 of 12

(Table 1). A second method of analysis was comparison
of samples isolated from two different rhizospheres
(direct comparison) each with four independent biological replicates taken at 7 dpi of 7-day-old plants (Table 1;
Additional files 4 and 5).
Gene expression for selected genes was confirmed by
quantitative RT-PCR performed in triplicate using the
QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) on an MJ
Mini cycler MiniOpticon Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK) as
previously described [33]. Primers are given in Additional file 11. The data were analyzed by the relative
quantification method (comparative CT method (ΔΔCT))
to calculate the fold expression [34,35]. Expression levels
were normalized against mdh and analyzed with REST
[34]. The results from the two normalization procedures
were not significantly different (Additional file 12).
Isolation of integration mutants and competition studies

R. leguminosarum bv viciae 300 (Rlv300, Strs) is the parent of streptomycin-resistant (Strr) derivative Rlv3841.
Mutations were made in 46 up-regulated genes in Rlv300
using plasmid integration (leading to neomycin-resistant
(Neor) mutant colonies) as described [8] (Additional file
8). To assess bacterial competiveness, 7-day-old pea or
alfalfa seedlings (n = 8) were inoculated with a Neo r
mutant (104 CFU) and wild-type Strr Rlv3841 (103 CFU).
The 10:1 ratio of mutant to wild type was used as the
wild type increases its frequency very effectively against
strains with attenuated competitiveness [33], enabling
detection of subtle decreases in competitiveness. After 7
days growth, recovered bacteria were serially diluted and
CFU scored on tryptone yeast agar with trimethoprim
(10 μg ml -1 ) and nystatin (50 μg ml -1 ) with either Str
(500 μg ml-1; selects Rlv3841) or Neo (80 μg ml-1; selects
mutant in Rlv300 background) as described [33]. A nifH
mutant was used as a negative control as it is only
expressed in nodules and is unaffected in its ability to
compete in the rhizosphere, while a thiM mutant (thiamine auxotroph) was used as a positive control because
it is severely attenuated for competitiveness in the pea
rhizosphere [33]. To establish a baseline competition
between wild-type strains, where no selective advantage
is expected, Rlv300 was inoculated at ten-fold excess over
Rlv3841. Rlv3841 was recovered at 9.7 ± 0.28% (mean ±
standard error of the mean, n = 51; Additional file 8),
close to the theoretical 9.1%. Similarly, for the positive
(thiM) and negative (nifH) controls, Rlv3841 was recovered from the rhizosphere at 71.6 ± 1.6% and 10.0 ± 0.9%
(mean ± standard error of the mean), respectively. These
data have been expressed as RCI = 1/[(Percentage
Rlv3841 recovered versus mutant)/(Percentage Rlv3841
recovered versus Rlv300)]. The RCI for the thiM mutant

Ramachandran et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R106
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R106

was 0.14 (1/(71.7%/9.7%)) and for nifH was 0.97 (1/
(10.0%/9.7%)). RCIs for all mutants are shown in Additional file 8 and range from 0.35 to 1.1. As the RCIs for
even the most affected mutants were not as low as that
for the thiamine auxotroph (thiM), it was concluded that
although no mutant strain was crippled for growth in the
rhizosphere, several were significantly reduced in ability
to colonize the rhizosphere in competition with wild-type
bacteria.

rhizospheres (a(i); Additional file 7), 66% are annotated as hypothetical
and 15% are membrane proteins or concerned with cell surface. The 184
genes down-regulated in all rhizospheres (a(ii); Additional file 7) include
those for proteins involved in general cellular functions of bacterial
motility and chemotaxis (6%), tRNA and DNA synthesis, chromosome
and plasmid replication, cell division, protein export by the Sec system,
electron transport and formation of ATP. In addition, 12% are annotated
as hypothetical, 13% are membrane proteins or concerned with cell
surface and 16% are ribosomal proteins. Components of two ABC
transport systems that import glucose (RL3624-5, RL4252) [8] are downregulated in all rhizospheres in comparison with glucose-grown cells
(Additional file 7). From direct comparison of the pea rhizosphere with
those of alfalfa and sugar beet (b(i)) there are 30 pea rhizosphere-specific
genes (listed in Additional file 7). There are 9 legume rhizosphere-specific
genes up-regulated in both the pea and alfalfa rhizosphere compared to
that of sugar beet (b(ii)). Abbreviations: SB, sugar beet.
