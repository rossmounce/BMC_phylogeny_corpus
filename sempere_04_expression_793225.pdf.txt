Results: In order to identify mammalian miRNAs that might function in development, we
characterized the expression of 119 previously reported miRNAs in adult organs from mouse and
human using northern blot analysis. Of these, 30 miRNAs were specifically expressed or greatly
enriched in a particular organ (brain, lung, liver or skeletal muscle). This suggests organ- or tissuespecific functions for miRNAs. To test if any of the 66 brain-expressed miRNAs were present in
neurons, embryonal carcinoma cells were treated with all-trans-retinoic acid to promote neuronal
differentiation. A total of 19 brain-expressed miRNAs (including lin-4 and let-7 orthologs) were
coordinately upregulated in both human and mouse embryonal carcinoma cells during neuronal
differentiation. The mammalian ortholog of C. elegans lin-28, which is downregulated by lin-4 in
worms via 3' untranslated region binding, was also repressed during neuronal differentiation of
mammalian embryonal carcinoma cells. Mammalian lin-28 messenger RNAs contain conserved
predicted binding sites in their 3' untranslated regions for neuron-expressed miR-125b (a lin-4
ortholog), let-7a, and miR-218.

25 nucleotides) with probable roles in the regulation of gene expression. In Caenorhabditis elegans,
lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs control the timing of fate specification of neuronal and hypodermal cells

Abstract

Sempere et al.

Background

The microRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of small
non-coding RNAs with mature transcripts of 18 to 25 nucleotides [1-12]. The enzymatic machinery involved in the biogenesis of miRNAs in plants and animals is well conserved.
RNAse type III-like Dicer, together with Argonaute proteins,
cleaves a miRNA hairpin precursor (70 to 75 nucleotides) to
yield a stable, ~22 nucleotides miRNA from one arm of the
hairpin [13]. Some miRNA genes are often organized into
clusters [1-3,14,15], and in some cases clustered miRNAs are
co-expressed [14,15]. Coordinate transcription is the first of
multiple levels for regulation of miRNA expression, including
miRNA maturation, transport, and stability [15-17]. This
gives plants and animals a great flexibility to modulate the
levels of miRNAs in different cell types and tissues and at different stages of their development.
The biological functions of a handful of miRNAs have been
identified in plants and animals [13,18]. The most apparent
difference between plant and animal miRNAs is the way they
interact with target genes. Animal miRNAs are generally
thought to recognize their messenger RNA (mRNA) targets
by incomplete base-pairing, leading to translational inhibition of the target. Plant miRNAs apparently also inhibit translation [19], but many plant miRNAs are precisely
complementary to their targets, and in these cases they act as
guides to trigger transcript degradation through RNA interference (RNAi) [20-22]. In Caenorhabditis elegans, upregulation of lin-4 and let-7 RNAs during the first and fourth
larval stage, respectively, triggers an ordered downregulation
of target genes that is required for the sequential expression
of stage-specific developmental programs [23-26]. lin-4 RNA
binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of lin-14 and lin-28
mRNAs and inhibits their translation [27,28]. Similarly, let-7
RNA binds to 3' UTR of lin-41 and lin-57 mRNAs and inhibits
their expression at a post-transcriptional level [29-31]. In
Drosophila melanogaster, the mRNAs of the pro-apoptotic
gene hid and the apoptotic effector gene drice possess binding
sites for bantam and miR-14, respectively [32,33]. The phenotypes of bantam and mir-14 loss-of-function suggest that
these miRNAs regulate apoptosis by inhibiting translation of
these apoptosis-promoting genes [32,33].
In mammals, certain miRNAs have been implicated in the
maintenance of pluripotent cell state during early embryogenesis [34], and roles have been suggested for other miRNAs
in tissue-specific or organ-specific development [2]. However, hundreds of miRNAs have been cloned from mouse and
human organs and cell lines [1-3,9,10], and numerous additional miRNAs have been predicted with computational algorithms [8]. To begin to explore the possible roles for these
numerous miRNAs in mammalian development, we used
northern analysis to characterize the expression of 119 previously reported miRNAs in adult organs from mouse and
human. Of these, 30 miRNAs were specifically expressed or
greatly enriched in a particular organ, suggesting an organ- or

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/3/R13

tissue-specific function. A small subset of brain-expressed
miRNAs was induced in mouse and human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA).
This induction coincided closely with the time of terminal
neuronal differentiation. The evolutionary conserved expression of these miRNAs suggests that they may play a role in the
specification and/or progression of neuronal lineage. The
orthologous protein of C. elegans LIN-28 was repressed in
these EC cells treated with RA. In addition, mammalian Lin28 mRNAs contain conserved predicted binding sites in their
3' UTRs for neuron-expressed miR-125b (a lin-4 ortholog),
let-7a, and miR-218. Thus, Lin-28 may also be subjected to
miRNA regulation in mammalian cells.

Results and discussion
Diverse miRNA expression patterns in mammalian
organs
Using northern analysis, we characterized the expression pattern of 92 previously cloned miRNAs [1-3,9,10] and 27 computationally predicted miRNAs [8] in adult organs from
mouse and human (Figure 1). This study confirms the expression of previously cloned miRNAs [1-3,9,10], and validates
the existence of computationally predicted miRNAs [8].
Although a wide range of expression profiles was represented
among these miRNAs, in general those miRNAs that had
been efficiently cloned from a particular organ in previous
studies [2,3], were also detected in those same organ(s) by
northern blot hybridization in this study. We detected 21 out
of 27 computationally predicted miRNAs by northern blot
hybridization. This result indicates that computational predictions are an appealing method for miRNA gene discovery
[8], but one should be cautious not to take computer predictions as proof of existence until newly predicted miRNAs are
validated experimentally. The inability to detect some of the
cloned and predicted miRNAs might be due to low levels of
expression, expression limited to a small number of cells or in
a narrow window of time during development, or simply that
these miRNAs are not expressed in organs examined in this
study.
A total of 17 of the expressed miRNAs were detected exclusively in a particular mouse organ; these included: seven
brain-specific miRNAs (miR-9, -124a, -124b, -135, -153, -183,
-219), six lung-specific miRNAs (miR-18, -19a, -24, -32, -130,
-213), two spleen-specific miRNAs (miR-189, -212), one liverspecific miRNA (miR-122a), and one heart-specific miRNA
(miR-208) (Figure 2). All of the indicated mouse brain-, liverand heart-specific miRNAs were also detected in the human
counterpart organs (miRNA expression was not examined in
human kidney, lung or spleen), with the exception of miR-183
in the human brain. Among the 75 miRNAs that were
detected in two or more mouse organs, the levels of 14 of these
were detected in a particular mouse organ at levels at least
two-fold higher than in any other organ; these included:
seven brain-enriched miRNAs (miR-9*, -125a, -125b, -128,

information

To identify additional classes of miRNAs with similar expression profiles, all 119 miRNAs were hierarchically clustered on
the basis of their expression profiles in our experiments,
applying Pearson's distribution. From this analysis, at least
six major groups of miRNAs with similar expression profiles
were discerned (Figure 2c). A group of six miRNAs was
expressed primarily in mouse spleen (miR-127, -142-a, -142s, -151, -189, -212). A group of five miRNAs was expressed in
mouse and human liver (miR-122a, -152, -194, -199, -215)
with some scattered expression in other organs including

-132, -137, -139), three skeletal muscle-enriched miRNAs
(miR-1d, -133, -206), two kidney-enriched miRNAs (miR30b, -30c), and one spleen-enriched miRNA (miR-99a) (Figure 2). All brain-enriched and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNAs had similar elevated levels in the human counterpart
organs. The high conservation of expression of these organspecific and organ-enriched miRNAs between mouse and
human suggests that they may play a conserved role in the
establishment and/or maintenance of a cell or tissue type of
that particular organ.

background, as described in Materials and methods. The intensity of the yellow scale corresponds to the intensity of miRNA expression; black indicates no
signal was detected over background, either by quantification or by visual inspection of the phosphoimager image. White indicates cases that were not
tested. The stringency of hybridization was not sufficient to distinguish single nucleotide mismatches; very similar expression profiles were observed for
members of closely related miRNA families, and so these profiles may reflect a composite of expression profiles from each member.

mouse lung and kidney (miR-18, -20, -24, -32, -141, -193, 200b). Together, the last two groups might reflect a role of
miRNAs in an epithelial cell type since liver, lung, and kidney

are organs containing epithelial tissues. A group of 17

mouse neonate head (gi|26096865) and eyeball
(gi|26094816), respectively. Where the miRNA transcriptional unit starts is an important consideration since regulatory regions for miRNA transcription may reside kilobases
upstream of the predicted hairpin precursor. In other cases, a
miRNA may be regulated by a cryptic or nearby promoter. For
example, mir-208, which is expressed in the mouse and
human heart, resides in an intron of human cardiac α-myosin
heavy chain. Perhaps mir-208 is co-transcribed with αmyosin and then processed out.

Some miRNAs reside in genomic regions that have been associated with a disease state. mir-15 and mir-16 reside on chromosome 13q14, a region associated with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) (Figure 3b). Calin et al. reported that miR-15
and miR-16 were expressed at reduced levels or unexpressed
at all in patients with CLL [36]. Notably, mir-142s/mir-142as
are located in the junction of the t(8;17) chromosomal rearrangement. This translocation fuses Bcl3 and Myc genes, thus
resulting in an aggressive B-cell leukemia [2,37]. mir-29
resides on chromosome 7q31. This FRA7G region is frequently altered in different tumor types including prostate,
breast, and ovarian cancer [38]. It has also been hypothesized
that FRA7G region contains a tumor suppressor gene, which
is mutated during the development of these cancers or an
oncogene that is amplified [38]. It will be interesting to see if
miR-142s/miR-142as and miR-29 expression is altered in
patients with a t(8;17) chromosomal rearrangement or
mutated FRA7G region, respectively.

Closely linked miRNAs that are arranged in tandem often
exhibit similar expression profiles, consistent with shared cisregulatory elements, and possibly a polycistronic precursor
transcript. We observed similar expression profiles for the
pair of linked miRNAs, mir-194 and mir-215, and also for
both members of the mir-1d~mir-133 cluster (Figure 3). The
miR-1d~miR-133 hairpin precursors were found contained
within the same human cDNA clone (gi|34367728), suggesting that miR-1d and miR-133 were expressed from the same
di-cistronic transcript.

Coordinate expression of closely linked miRNAs

We have also found several cases were closely linked miRNAs
are not tightly coexpressed. Closely linked miRNAs such as
mir-23b~mir-27b~mir-24/mir-189 exhibited more loosely
correlated expression patterns (Figure 3). However, a transcript containing miR-23b~miR-27b~miR-24/miR-189 was
detected by northern analysis in humans (gi|4105182), which
suggests that these clustered miRNAs probably belong to the
same transcriptional unit, but accumulate differentially in
vivo as a result of differences in post-transcriptional processing or stability. Other cases of clustered miRNAs with different expression profiles, such as mir-132 and mir-212, could
represent closely linked but independent transcription units.

reviews

The majority of miRNAs presented here were previously
cloned by Lagos-Quintana and colleagues [2,3]. Our characterization of organ expression of miRNAs correlates with the
organ(s) from which these miRNAS were originally cloned
[2,3]. miRNAs that were abundantly cloned in a particular
organ, such as miR-135 and miR-153 from brain [2], were
exclusively detected by northern analysis in mouse and
human brain. However, we observed some discrepancies
between our expression profiling by northern analysis and
expression profiling by cloning [2,3]. This is particularly so
for certain less-abundant miRNAs - those that were represented in size-selected RNA libraries by three or fewer copies.
We believe that northern analysis is a more statistically
robust method for expression profiling of less abundant miRNAs than cloning frequency is. The panel of organs that we
tested in our study did not include all the organs and tissues
that miRNAs were cloned from [1-3,9,10], and thus some
organ-specific or organ-enriched miRNAs may be expressed
in additional organs or tissues.

organs. This group included all seven brain-specific and
seven brain-enriched miRNAs described above. The brain is a
complex organ with several cell types, among which neurons
and glial cells are predominant. Future work will determine
the specific neuronal cells in which these miRNAs are
expressed. A group of six miRNAs was expressed in mouse
and human skeletal muscle and heart: miR-1b, -1d, -133 and 206 had elevated expression in heart and skeletal muscle with
low expression in other organs and miR-143 and -208 were
almost exclusively detected in heart and skeletal muscle.
Skeletal muscle and heart derive from the mesodermal
embryonic layer and possess similar striated muscle cells.
Thus, these miRNAs could be developmentally expressed in
muscle cells of both organs. A group of five miRNAs showed
abundant expression across organs (let-7a, -7b, miR-30b, 30c). let-7 family members have been suggested to play a role
in terminal differentiation during development in invertebrates and vertebrates [16]. Overall, about 50% of the
expressed miRNAs were assigned to a specific or restricted set
of organs. Other miRNAs had a more complex pattern of
expression and these were not readily assigned to a particular
group.

to other organs (14 out of 30 miRNAs in mouse), and an overall prevalence of miRNAs expressed in the brain (66 out of 90
miRNAs in mouse). This suggested that miRNA-based
regulation of gene activity might be engaged during nervous
system development and neuronal differentiation. To determine which of brain-expressed miRNAs were associated with
neuronal differentiation, we examined their expression during neuronal differentiation of EC cells. Mouse P19 and
human NTera-2 clone D1 (NT2/D1) are EC cells that differentiate into neurons upon RA-treatment [39-41]. P19 and NT2/
D1 have similar programs of neuronal differentiation, though
the differentiation of P19 cells progresses more rapidly than
that of NT2/D1 cells [42,43]. An early phase of commitment
to neuronal fate occurs within two days after RA-treatment

for P19 and NT2/D1 cells. A later phase of terminal differentiation takes place between days five to eight in P19 cells and
is delayed for more than three weeks in NT2/D1 cells [42,43].
We reasoned that miRNAs with evolutionarily conserved
roles in neurons should be induced during neuronal differentiation of both mouse and human EC cells. P19 and NT2/D1
cells were treated with 1 µM and 10 µM of RA, respectively, to
induce neuronal differentiation. Cells were collected at key
days during differentiation and total RNA was analyzed by
northern blotting (Figures 1, 4). Remarkably, 19 miRNAs
were induced in both P19 and NT2/D1 cell lines (Figure 5).
They included four of the brain-specific (miR-9, -124a, -124b,
-135), four of the brain-enriched (miR-9*, -125a, -125b, -128),

information

Only a subset of the brain-expressed miRNAs were detected
in neurons derived from RA-treated EC cells suggesting that
other brain-expressed miRNAs are present primarily in nonneuronal cell types such as glia. Alternatively, these other

brain-expressed miRNAs may be present in neuronal subtypes not represented in differentiated neurons derived from
EC cells. In a recent study, Krichevsky et al. described a series
of miRNAs that were developmentally regulated in rat brain
during corticogenesis [17]. We observed that the same series
of miRNAs was upregulated in EC cells upon RA-treatment.
Krichevsky et al. also showed that miR-9/miR-9* were
expressed at lower levels in the presenillin-1 knockout mouse,
which had an abnormal forebrain development [17]. We
observed a strong induction of miR-9/miR-9* expression in
P19 cells. Together, these results suggest that miR-9/miR-9*
may play an important role during neurogenesis in rodents.

of all 19 miRNAs was induced in P19 cells typically by day four
after RA-treatment and progressively accumulated to higher
levels thereafter. This time corresponds to a second wave of
transcriptional activation of protein-encoding genes that are
involved in terminal differentiation [44]. Thus, miRNA could
collaborate with or fine-tune the regulation mediated by neurogenic proteins that specify neuronal identity. Since we did
not directly examine expression of miRNAs in glial cells, we
could not eliminate the possibility that RA-induced miRNAs
were also expressed in glial cells.

these miRNAs constitute unlinked loci. This contrasts with
the localized repression exerted by RA upon embryonic stem
cell-specific miRNAs (miR-290 to miR-295) arranged in two
tightly linked loci [34].

LIN-28 could be a potential target for miRNA
regulation in embryonal carcinomas
The mir-125 and let-7 family members were among the brainexpressed miRNAs induced during neuronal differentiation.
In C. elegans, lin-4 (the ortholog of mir-125) and let-7 are
engaged in a genetic pathway that controls temporal cell fates
during larval development [25,26]. Upregulation of lin-4
RNA during the first larval stage (L1) triggers the progression
from early (L1) to late (L2-L3) fate programs [24]. lin-4 RNA
binds to the 3' UTR of target mRNAs, including lin-28, and
inhibits their translation [27,45]. LIN-28 is expressed at early
stages in neuronal, hypodermal, and intestinal lineages
before it is developmentally downregulated by lin-4 RNA. In
mammals, LIN-28 protein is downregulated as embryonic
development progresses, consistent with a possible conserved role in developmental timing [46]. Interestingly, LIN28 is present in undifferentiated P19 and NT2/D1 cells, but it
is not detected in neuronal or liver tissues [46]. To test if
downregulation of LIN-28 could occur in conjunction with
neuronal differentiation, western analysis of total protein

from lysates of P19 and NT2/D1 cells was performed at various times after RA-treatment. LIN-28 levels began to
decrease on about day five after RA-treatment, and almost
disappeared by day eight, when cells reached their final state
of neuronal differentiation. A similar result was observed in
NT2/D1 cells; LIN-28 levels decreased slightly, typically by
day 14, and were still detectable at day 21. The kinetics of LIN28 downregulation in P19 and NT2/D1 cells during RAinduced differentiation parallels the upregulation of miR125b, let-7a, and miR-218 in these EC cells. The 3' UTRs of the
mouse and human Lin-28 mRNAs contain conserved
sequences complementary to miR-125b, let-7a, and miR-218
(Figure 5) [46], consistent with a role for these miRNAs in the
downregulation of LIN-28 in NT2/D1 and P19 cells. Yet, we
did not detect downregulation, in differentiating P19 cells, of
a luciferase reporter gene fused to the mouse Lin-28 3' UTR
and driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) or thymidine kinase
(TK) promoter (data not shown). We also noticed a decrease
in endogenous Lin-28 mRNA levels in differentiated neurons
derived from P19 cells (data not shown), suggesting that
repression of the native Lin-28 gene in this system may be
largely transcriptional. These results therefore suggest that,
unlike C. elegans larval development, where lin-28 downregulation is primarily caused by translational repression by lin4 RNA, the decline of Lin-28 during neuronal differentiation

controlled on the translational level, miRNAs could play a primary regulatory role; in other cases, such as mammalian Lin28, where the primary mode of regulation is transcriptional,
translational repression by miRNAs could play an auxiliary,
or supplementary regulatory role.

Materials and methods
Cell culture and retinoic acid treatment
P19 cells were cultured in αMEM with 7.5% fetal calf serum
and 2.5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with streptomycin and penicillin; NT2/D1 cells were cultured in high glucose
DME with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine under humidified 5%
CO2. P19 cells were treated with 1 µM RA solution as
described in [40]; NT2/D1 were treated with 10 µM RA solution as described in [49]. Control cells were treated with an
equal amount of the vehicle dimethyl-sulfoxide.

Data clustering

interactions

Radioactivity contained in northern blot bands was quantified with the ImageQuant software package, and was
expressed as a ratio of signal in the band of hybridization to
signal in the background adjacent to the band. Hybridization/
background ratios of ≤ 1.1 were not reported as positive signals, except when the band was readily detectable by eye (Figures 2, 5). Northern hybridization data were clustered with
GeneTraffic 6.2 software package, applying Pearson's hierarchical clustering.

miRNA::target mRNA predictions
Potential RNA::RNA interactions between miRNAs and 3'
UTR sequences were assessed by testing 20-nts segments of
3' UTR sequence for their predicted capacity to form RNA
secondary structure with a candidate miRNA. Each miRNA
sequence was appended to each 20-nucleotide 3' UTR segment by a poly-(N)10 linker, and analyzed for predicted RNA

information

Hundreds of miRNAs have recently been discovered in mammalian genomes. To begin to explore the potential roles of
these miRNAs in mammalian development and physiology,
we characterized the expression profiles of 119 miRNAs in
mouse and human organs (Figure 1). We found that many of
these miRNAs exhibit phylogenetically conserved organenriched or organ-specific expression. In both mouse and
human examined organs, seven miRNAs were expressed specifically in a particular organ and ten miRNAs were greatly
enriched in a particular organ over all others (Figure 2).
These data associate miRNAs to particular organs and suggest their participation in conserved developmental or physiological pathways within these spatial domains in mouse and
human. Interestingly, 13 of these 17 miRNAs were enriched or
specifically expressed in brain of both mouse and human. Of
these, eight brain miRNAs were also induced during differentiation of neurons derived from human and mouse EC cells
treated with RA (Figure 4). These data strongly suggest a conserved role for these miRNAs in the specification and/or progression of neuronal fate in mammals. At least one gene
whose protein product decreases during neuronal differentiation, Lin-28, contains potential sites in its 3' UTR for complementary base-pairing by the RA-induced miRNAs let-7a,
miR-125b, and miR-218 (Figure 5). However, not only the
protein levels but also the RNA levels of Lin-28 decreased
upon RA treatment suggesting that other factors must also
mediate this process. Unlike C. elegans lin-28 whose translational inhibition by lin-4 RNA is the primary mechanism for
its downregulation, miRNAs may provide an auxiliary or reinforcing layer of regulation to completely shut down Lin-28
expression in EC cells. miRNA loss-of-function experiments
in these EC cells could prove useful in understanding their
regulatory contribution during the process of neuronal differentiation. In the case of targets whose expression is primarily

were a gift from Nathan Watson (Norris Cotton Cancer
Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center). Total RNA
was extracted from pooled organs of two to four mice or from
cell lines with Trizol Reagent following the vendor's recommendations. Total RNA, 5 or 10 µg, was routinely loaded onto
12% urea-polyacrylamide gels as described in [50]. Total RNA
from human organs was acquired from the Biochain Institute.

Myc and Cyclin D1 are well-characterized cases of genes
repressed by RA-treatment at the levels of transcription and
translation in differentiating neurons [47,48]. We subjected
the conserved blocks between mouse and human Myc and
Cyclin D1 3' UTRs to the same computer algorithm applied to
Lin-28 3' UTR to identify potential binding sites for RAinduced miRNAs. Potential sites for let-7 and miR-30 family
members were found on Myc and Cyclin D1 3' UTRs (data not
shown). These findings suggest that translational repression
by miRNAs, in combination with transcriptional repression
and mRNA turnover, could contribute to the downregulation
of growth and cell cycle regulators during neuronal
differentiation.

of P19 cells involves primarily transcriptional repression.
However, the phylogenetic conservation of miRNA sites suggests that translational repression of Lin-28 by let-7a, miR125b, and/or miR-218 may contribute secondarily to Lin-28
downregulation in the mammalian system.

secondary structure using the RNAfold program of the
Vienna RNA package [51]. The full length of a 3' UTR
sequence was queried by extracting successive 20-nucleotide
test segments, tiling along in two-nucleotide steps. RNA folding output generated by ViennaRNA was analyzed using the
following software filters to evaluate the strength of the predicted target::miRNA interaction: at least two out of the three
first and last bases of the miRNA had to be bound to the target
sequence; at least 65% of the miRNA sequence had to be
bound to the target sequence; the free energy (∆G) of the
binding had to be greater than -7 Kcal/mole; and the
target::miRNA interaction site had to lie within regions of at
least 76% identity between mouse and human target 3' UTRs.

The scoring scheme was modeled based on the experimentally confirmed interaction between lin-4 RNA::lin-28 3' UTR
in C. elegans. Those predicted miRNA::UTR structures that
passed the above filters were further assigned a numerical
score based on the following parameters: total number of
miRNA bases bound to a target sequence - points for binding
were weighed, having a less impact on the score of a mismatch
in the central region of the miRNA, which tends to bulge out
in documented miRNA/mRNA interactions [23,45] (denoted
(a)); number of consecutive miRNA bases bound to target
sequence (denoted (b)); overall ∆G of RNA-RNA interaction
(denoted (c)); and additional emphasis for miRNA with the
first three and last three bases bound to target sequence
(denoted (d)). This is the formula of the overall score = 8a +
2b + 84c + 6d.
