Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic conservation at the DNA level is routinely used as evidence of
molecular function, under the assumption that locations and sequences of functional DNA
segments remain invariant in evolution. In particular, short DNA segments participating in initiation
and regulation of transcription are often conserved between related species. However,
transcription of a gene can evolve, and this evolution may involve changes of even such conservative
DNA segments. Genes of yeast Saccharomyces have promoters of two classes, class 1 (TATAcontaining) and class 2 (non-TATA-containing).
Results: Comparison of upstream non-coding regions of orthologous genes from the five species
of Saccharomyces sensu stricto group shows that among 212 genes which very likely have class 1
promoters in S. cerevisiae, 17 probably have class 2 promoters in one or more other species.
Conversely, among 322 genes which very likely have class 2 promoters in S. cerevisiae, 44 probably
have class 1 promoters in one or more other species. Also, for at least 2 genes from the set of 212
S. cerevisiae genes with class 1 promoters, the locations of the TATA consensus sequences are
substantially different between the species.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that, in the course of yeast evolution, a promoter switches its
class with the probability at least ~0.1 per time required for the accumulation of one nucleotide
substitution at a non-coding site. Thus, key sequences involved in initiation of transcription evolve
with substantial rates in yeast.

Background
Comparison of long, orthologous DNA sequences usually
reveals patterns consisting of alternating segments of
higher and lower interspecies similarity [1]. Many slowly
evolving segments are under selective constraint, due to
their function as protein-coding exons, UTRs, transcription factor binding sites, etc. In particular, numerous relatively short conservative segments of untranscribed
intergenic regions have recently been discovered, and phy-

logenetic footprinting has been used to study the molecular mechanisms of transcription [2-7].
However, functionally important DNA segments are not
always strictly conserved, and can evolve due to a variety
of factors, including positive selection [8-11]. This evolution leads to intraspecies polymorphism, often having significant impacts on function and fitness (reviewed in
[12]), and to interspecies divergence. The known cases of
such divergence usually involve presence of a functional

Yeast Saccharomyces provides a particularly good opportunity to study evolution of functional segments of untranscribed DNA. In S. cerevisiae, and almost certainly in other
related species, the promoter of a gene belongs to one of
the two distinct classes: class 1 (TATA-containing) or class
2 (non-TATA-containing), with ~13% of all promoters
containing a TATA box and belonging to class 1 [18].
Transcription from promoters of the two classes involves
recruitment of different complexes of transcription factors
[19], and the corresponding genes have rather different
expression patterns. Expression of class 1 genes tends to
change in response to selective pressure and environmental stress more than expression of class 2 genes [18,20].
Expression of class 1 genes is sensitive to mutations in
binding surface of TBP, and their promoters often contain
one of the eight variants of the 8 nucleotide-long TATA
box consensus sequence [18]. TATA boxes are usually
located in the region between 40 and 120 bp upstream of
transcription start site [21,22]. Expression of class 2 genes
is insensitive to mutations in binding surface of TBP, and
their promoters usually lack TATA box consensus
sequence [18].
Thus, evolution of a particular key transcription-related
sequence, the TATA box, can be studied at the level of the
whole yeast genome. Here, we will address the simplest,
qualitative aspect of this evolution, the dynamics of
switches of the promoter class in the course of interspecies
divergence of orthologous genes within Saccharomyces
sensu stricto group.

Results
Class 1 and class 2 promoters in S. cerevisiae genes
In order to study evolutionary switches of the promoter
class, we first need to determine the class of individual
genes. Let us start from considering S. cerevisiae genes
where, in contrast to other yeast species, this task is facilitated by the available data on gene expression. Our goal is
to establish two sets of genes, which unambiguously have
class 1 or class 2 promoters in S. cerevisiae.

Although all genes apparently require TBP for expression,
only a fraction of genes is sensitive to mutations in DNA
binding surface of TBP [23], and these genes are inferred
to have functional TATA boxes [18]. We assume that an
ORF has a class 1 promoter in S. cerevisiae if it meets all of
the following stringent criteria: (i) the upstream region (-

binding site for a particular transcription factor in one
species and its disruption or total absence in the orthologous sequence segment in the other species. Nucleotide
substitutions, as well as short insertions and deletions
involving a binding site, can be correlated with interspecies differences in the expression profiles of the corresponding genes [13-17].

least one TATA box consensus sequence, TATA(A/T)A(A/
T)(A/G) [18], (ii) expression of the gene declined substantially (log2 ratio < -0.35) after 45 min exposure to at least
one of the TATA binding defective TBP mutants V71E and
V161E [18,23], and (iii) the location of the ORF on the
chromosome does not overlap with that of any other ORF
sensitive to TATA binding defective TBP mutants. These
criteria define class 1 promoters with the highest possible
certainty, as long as only S. cerevisiae sequence is used.
Since we are interested in interspecies evolution of TATA
box, our criteria must use exclusively the data from a single species (S. cerevisiae) and must not depend on interspecies sequence conservation [18]. A total of 212 (3.2%)
S. cerevisiae ORFs meet these criteria; these are the genes
that have class 1 promoters with the highest certainty.
Conversely, we assume that an ORF has a class 2 promoter
in S. cerevisiae if it meets both of the following criteria: (i)
the extended upstream region (-310 to -70, relative to the
ATG start codon) does not contain any of the 8 TATA box
consensus sequences, and (ii) expression of the gene was
not affected (|log2 ratio| < 0.05) by 45 min exposure to
both TATA binding defective TBP mutants V71E and
V161E [18,23]. Among 397 genes that lack sensitivity to
TBP mutations, 34 (8.6%) have a consensus TATA box
sequence in their upstream regions (-180, -70) and
another 41 have a consensus TATA box sequence in the (-

that have class 2 promoters with the highest certainty.

Class 1 and class 2 promoters in non-cerevisiae yeast
genes
For the remaining 4 species of Saccharomyces sensu stricto
group, there are no data on gene expression. Thus, we
have to rely on sequences alone. We attribute to class 1 all
the non-cerevisiae genes which carry at least one of the 8
TATA box consensus sequences in the (-180 to -70)
region.

We concentrate on these two extreme classes of genes
which very likely have class 1 or class 2 promoters and
ignore the rest of the S. cerevisiae genes. Indeed, we have
to focus on the extremes because they provide the strongest data sets.

Dealing with class 2, we need to take into account that in
S. cerevisiae a large fraction of genes sensitive to TBP binding defective mutations (198 out of 469, 42.2%) do not
carry any of the 8 variants of the consensus TATA box
sequences even in the extended upstream region (-310, 70). However, most of such genes (151 out of 198,
76.3%) carry a sequence differing by just one nucleotide
from one of the variants. Therefore, some non-cerevisiae
octanucleotides which are orthologous to a S. cerevisiae
TATA box sequence but deviate at a single nucleotide site
from the consensus still may function as TATA boxes, and
the corresponding promoters may belong to class 1. Conversely, we assume that octanucleotides differing from
each of the 8 TATA box consensus variants at two or more
nucleotide sites do not function as TATA boxes, and
attribute non-cerevisiae genes carrying only such
sequences in their (-310, -70) regions to class 2.
Promoter class switches between S. cerevisiae and other
four species
Generally, within the 212 sets of orthologous genes which
very likely have class 1 promoters in S. cerevisiae, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/14

putative TATA sites are strongly conserved, well above the
level of conservation of surrounding sequence (chisquare, P < 0.0001; fig. 1). However, 17 (8.0%) of these
genes lack a TATA box sequence (consensus or 1-nucleotide deviation) in one or more of the other four species
from Saccharomyces sensu stricto group (Table 1). In
these 17 genes, S. cerevisiae TATA box was aligned, in at
least one of the non-cerevisiae species, either to an octanucleotide differing in more than one nucleotide from the
consensus TATA box sequence, or to a gap (fig. 2). Promoters of 2 genes lack TATA box sequence in two or more
non-cerevisiae species. The fraction of genes with missing
TATA boxes is the lowest in S. paradoxus, the species most
closely related to S. cerevisiae (Table 2). In 2 genes
(0.9%), TATA box is present in S. bayanus, but its position
differs from that in S. cerevisiae, and octanucleotides
orthologous, in the cerevisiae-bayanus alignment, to both
TATA boxes species differ by more than one nucleotide
from the 8 consensus variants (fig. 3).
Among the 322 genes which very likely have class 2 promoters in S. cerevisiae, in 44 (13.7%) the consensus TATA

a The minimal distance from TATA consensus is the minimal number of nucleotides different from the consensus sequence (TATA(A/T)A(A/T)(A/
G)) in the octanucleotide of S. cerevisiae which is orthologous to the TATA box in the non-cerevisiae species. "Gap" indicates an alignment gap at the
site of the TATA box; "GA" means that ORF was not conserved in the given species.
b Parsimonious number of switch events in sensu stricto group; i.e., the minimum number of mutations within sensu stricto group necessary to
produce this pattern.
c Inferred state in last common ancestor. In cases when more than one equally parsimonious ancestral state was possible, it could not be inferred
reliably (marked as '?').

sequence is present in (-180, -70) in one or more of the
four non-cerevisiae yeast species. In 7 of these genes, it is
present in two or more species (Tables 2, 3), and in 2
genes, it is present in all four species, providing strong
support for its function as a TATA box in non-cerevisiae
species.

point, we can regard class 1 genes as TATA-containing,
and class 2 genes as non-TATA-containing, only with
some degree of uncertainty. In the absence of the experimental data on gene expression in non-cerevisiae yeasts,
our conclusions must be treated with caution, especially
when applied to individual genes.

The known yeast phylogeny makes it possible to infer the
promoter class of a gene in the last common ancestor of
the S. sensu stricto group from the observed pattern of
TATA box presence/absence in the five orthologs. Also, it
is possible to use parsimony to infer the minimum
number of promoter class switches (TATA box gain or
loss) during the evolution of S. sensu stricto group species
from their last common ancestor. In at least 7 of the 61
genes (11.5%) which underwent switches of the promoter
class, there was more than one switch (Tables 1, 3).

Our results suggest that even within the relatively short
evolutionary times separating Saccharomyces species, a
substantial fraction of genes underwent as major a transition as switching of the class of their promoters. At least
0.9% of all genes went through a switch of the promoter
between the classes 1 and 2 at least once during the evolution of Saccharomyces sensu stricto group. This figure takes
into account only the small fraction of genes for which we
can determine the promoter class with the highest certainty. Extrapolated to the whole genome, this figure suggests that ~11% of genes change the class of their
promoters in the course of sensu stricto group divergence.

Genes with promoters which switched their class between
species are to some extent different from other genes of
the corresponding class. The 44 class 2 (in S.cerevisiae)
genes that switched class are generally expressed weaker in
S.cerevisiae (Mann-Whitney U-test, U = 4991, P < 0.05)
than the remaining class 2 genes. The 17 class 1 (in S. cerevisiae) genes that switched class are less sensitive to TBP
mutations in S. cerevisiae (Mann-Whitney U-test, U = 826,
P < 0.001) than the remaining class 1 genes.
Since 34 (out of 397) genes that lack sensitivity to TBP
mutations in S. cerevisiae, have a consensus TATA box
sequence in their (-180, -70) regions, even a perfect TATA
box consensus may, nevertheless, fail to function as a
TATA box, perhaps due to its broader sequence context.
Conservation of such "spurious" TATA boxes between S.
cerevisiae and other yeast species was substantially lower
than for functional TATA boxes (chi-square, P < 0.0001;
Table 2, fig. 1), and only slightly exceeded conservation of
neighboring sequences (0.74 vs. 0.70, averaged over all
four genomes; chi-square, P = 0.02; the slight excess of
conservation was limited to the first four nucleotides of
the TATA box (TATA)). The upstream regions of these 34
genes tend to be less conserved than that of the TBP-mutation-sensitive genes (chi-square, P < 0.0001; Table 2).

Discussion
The sequence of the upstream region of a gene is not sufficient to determine the class of its promoter with perfect
certainty. Some genes with expression profiles of class 1
genes nevertheless lack precise TATA boxes, and some
genes with expression profiles of class 2 genes contain precise TATA boxes. Perhaps, sequences which deviate substantially from the TATA box consensus may act as TATA
boxes in some class 1 genes, and TATA boxes in some class
2 genes are spurious. Alternatively, data on expression
profiles of some genes might be problematic. Thus, at this

Among genes belonging to class 1 in S. cerevisiae, the
switch between promoter classes (either loss of TATA box
in another species or gain of TATA box in S. cerevisiae)
occurred at the rate of one per time during which eight to
twenty substitutions occurred at a non-coding nucleotide
site (Table 2). Conversely, among class 2 genes in S. cerevisiae, switches between promoter classes (either gain of
TATA box in another species or loss of TATA box in cerevisiae) occur at the rate of one per time during which three
to ten substitutions occurred at a non-coding nucleotide
site (Table 2). Finally, at the rate of less than one per 50
nucleotide substitutions, the position of a TATA box
shifted within the upstream region of a class 1 gene (Table
2).
The observed switches of promoter class cannot be due to
sequencing errors. For example, a switch from class 1 in S.
cerevisiae to class 2 in a non-cerevisiae yeast involves at
least two nucleotide substitutions within the 8 nucleotide-long TATA box. Such switches were observed for 8%
of TATA boxes, which would require a clearly impossible
sequencing error rate >10-2.
Our estimates of the frequency of promoter class switches
may be too low, for several reasons. First, we used very
conservative definitions of class 1 and class 2 promoters.
For the former, we required the presence of a TATA box
within a narrow segment of the gene upstream region, and
a significant reduction of the gene expression in TBP
mutants. In reality, functional TATA boxes may be present
in a broader region [24], and may be less sensitive to TBP
mutations [18]; the latter is in fact the case for two of the
genes experimentally known to contain a functional TATA
box – GAL1 and ADH1 [19]. By limiting ourselves to the
genes with the strongest response to mutation in TBP, we

may be choosing a slowly evolving subset of TATA-containing genes. However, expression of genes with class 1
promoters can evolve rapidly in experiments [18], so that
the real pattern may be more complex.
Second, for a fraction of the analyzed genes, we were unable to find the ortholog in another species. Since the five
species considered are closely related, this can be due to
the quality of the draft sequence. In reality, some of these
yet undiscovered orthologous genes could have switched
the classes of their promoters as well, and the rate of promoter type evolution inferred from better-quality genome
sequences might be higher. Finally, our requirement of a
change of two nucleotides in the ortholog of a TATA box
may sometimes be too stringent, since a single nucleotide
substitution is often sufficient to disrupt a functional
TATA box [18,19] Therefore, the higher rate of promoter
class switches inferred for the genes insensitive to TBP
mutations with class 2 promoters in S. cerevisiae may
reflect the actual rate of evolution better than the reciprocal rate.
The abundance of genes showing multiple events of promoter class switching during the evolution of Saccharomyces suggests heterogeneity of intrinsic switch rates among
genes. In the genes with elevated rate of promoter class
switching, TATA box can be under reduced selective constraint, or subject to fluctuating positive selection [25].

Conclusion
By combining expression data on S. cerevisiae genes with
sequence data from four closely related yeast species, we
were able to ascertain the set of genes that probably
changed the class of their promoters, and several genes in
which the functional TATA box changed its position in the
upstream region of the gene. Experimental data on noncerevisiae genes are necessary to confirm our analysis for
each individual gene. However, our results suggest that a
substantial number of genes underwent promoter class
switching between the closely related species of Saccharomyces genus.

Methods
We used yeast genome annotation extracted from SGD
database [26] to map 6578 ORFs on the finished genome
of S. cerevisiae [27]. The genome of S. cerevisiae was
aligned to draft genomes of another four species of Saccharomyces sensu stricto group (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S.
bayanus [5] and S. kudriavtsevii [6]) using MLAGAN program [28] as described in [29]. To improve the quality of
local alignments, each upstream region was re-aligned
using ClustalW [30]. The alignments of the upstream
regions for all the considered ORFs are available at [31].
For comparison with a non-cerevisiae species, we use only
those S. cerevisiae ORFs which were aligned to an unam-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/14

biguous ortholog in this species. Orthology was established according to the reciprocal best hits approach,
using gapped BLAST [32]. In order to avoid possible complications due to large-scale genome rearrangements, we
also required that the orthologs reside in syntenic region
in the two genomes. For this purpose, we manually
curated each region of alignment using OWEN program
[33] and used only those pairs of orthologous ORFs which
are embedded into long, continuous alignment which
include, in particular, the ORF upstream to the considered
pair of genes.
For each ORF in S. cerevisiae, we also check if its orthologs
in another species remain functional, using the reading
frame conservation test described in [5]. We assume that
a reading frame was conserved in a given species if the
maximum (for each of the three reading frames) percentage of in-frame nucleotides exceeds the threshold of 80%
in S. paradoxus, 75% in S. mikatae, 70% in S. kudriavtsevii
and 65% in S. bayanus [5]. We remove from further analysis those ORFs that were conserved in less than two noncerevisiae species according to these criteria, since these are
likely to be spurious ORFs [5]. In order to ensure that our
position criteria for non-cerevisiae species are meaningful,
we also require conservation of starting ATG codon in
alignment in each considered species.
For the remaining pairs of unambiguous conserved
orthologous ORFs, we analyze evolution of TATA box
consensus sequences in their upstream regions. For 212
genes that certainly have TATA-containing class 1 promoters in S. cerevisiae, we analyze the fate of the TATA box in
the other four species. We assume that a TATA box is conserved and its position remains invariant in a given noncerevisiae species if the TATA box in S. cerevisiae sequence
was aligned to the segment of the non-cerevisiae sequence
which coincided with one of the 8 variants of the TATAbox consensus (nucleotide substitutions which kept the
segment within the set of 8 variants of the TATA box consensus were allowed), or deviated from one of these 8 variants by no more than one nucleotide substitution.
Conversely, a fraction of non-cerevisiae sequence segments
aligns to a consensus TATA box sequence in S. cerevisiae,
but deviates from any of the consensus sequences by two
or more nucleotides. In such cases, we assumed that the
non-cerevisiae gene has a shifted TATA-box if one of the
eight consensus variants was found elsewhere in the
upstream region (-310 to -70). Alternatively, we assumed
that a TATA box was missing if there was no TATA consensus sequence in this region.
Analogously, we analyze the evolution of certainly nonTATA-containing promoters in S. cerevisiae. If one or more
of the eight exact TATA box sequences was present within

the region (-180 to -70) in non-cerevisiae species, we
assumed the promoter to be class 1 in this species.
In a few cases of ambiguous alignments of upstream
regions, we were unable to tell with confidence which octanucleotide in one species was orthologous to TATA box
in another. In such cases, we selected the octanucleotide
with closest resemblance to TATA-box (i.e., with fewest
nucleotides different from consensus TATA sequence)
between two framing regions of unambiguous alignment,
and considered it to be the ortholog of the TATA box. This
approach was conservative in that it could only increase
the actual conservation of the TATA box.
