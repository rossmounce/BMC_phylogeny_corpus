Abstract
Background: Vitellogenin is a well established biomarker for estrogenic exposure in fish.
However, effects on gonadal differentiation at concentrations of estrogen not sufficient to give rise
to a measurable vitellogenin response suggest that more sensitive biomarkers would be useful.
Induction of zona pellucida genes may be more sensitive but their specificities are not as clear. The
objective of this study was to find additional sensitive and robust candidate biomarkers of
estrogenic exposure.
Results: Hepatic mRNA expression profiles were characterized in juvenile rainbow trout exposed
to a measured concentration of 0.87 and 10 ng ethinylestradiol/L using a salmonid cDNA
microarray. The higher concentration was used to guide the subsequent identification of generally
more subtle responses at the low concentration not sufficient to induce vitellogenin. A metaanalysis was performed with data from the present study and three similar microarray studies using
different fish species and platforms. Within the generated list of presumably robust responses,
several well-known estrogen-regulated genes were identified. Two genes, confirmed by
quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR), fulfilled both the criteria of high sensitivity and robustness; the
induction of the genes encoding zona pellucida protein 3 and a nucleoside diphosphate kinase
(nm23).
Conclusion: The cross-species, cross-platform meta-analysis correctly identified several robust
responses. This adds confidence to our approach used for identifying candidate biomarkers.
Specifically, we propose that analyses of an nm23 gene together with zona pellucida genes may
increase the possibilities to detect an exposure to low levels of estrogenic compounds in fish.

Background
The contraceptive estrogen, ethinylestradiol (EE2) is an
important contributor to the feminization of fish downstream from sewage treatment works [1-5]. This discovery

was greatly facilitated by the use of vitellogenin (VTG) as
a biomarker. VTG is produced in the liver of sexually
maturing female fish under the influence of endogenous
estrogen. Normally, VTG is not expressed in males or juvePage 1 of 9

niles, unless they are exposed to estrogens via water or
food. Both VTG mRNA and protein in male and juvenile
fish have thus become established biomarkers for exposure to environmental estrogens [6]. However, estrogens
can effect gonadal sex differentiation of fish at concentration not sufficient to give rise to a measurable VTG
response [7]. It has also been shown that life cycle exposure of fathead minnow to an inordinately low concentration of EE2 (0.32 ng/L) was sufficient to decrease the egg
fertilisation and to skew the sex ratios towards female[8].
This suggests that more sensitive biomarkers would be
useful. Zona pellucida (ZP) genes may be more sensitive
than VTG [9] but their specificity for estrogens is not as
clear [10-12]. Additional, sensitive biomarkers would
thus increase our possibilities to identify exposure to low,
but biologically important concentrations of estrogens.
Rapidly accumulating data on genomes and proteomes
have increased the possibilities to use different types of
discovery-driven methods in ecotoxicology [13,14]. The
large number of potential responses that can be studied
with microarrays renders the method suitable for identifying candidate biomarkers of exposure [15-20]. Such candidates may then be further evaluated to find if they are
useful as biomarkers. In general, a good biomarker should
be sensitive, specific and robust. A robust response
implies for example that it should be measurable at complex exposure situations, at different exposure concentrations, at different temperatures, after different exposure
times, by different analytical approaches, in different labs
and preferably also in different species.
The main objective of the present study was to use microarrays to find novel, sensitive and robust biomarkers of
estrogenic exposure in fish. We have used a salmonid
cDNA microarray from cGRASP [21] to analyze hepatic
expression profiles in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to EE2 in vivo. The responses identified at a high concentration of EE2 were used to guide the
subsequent identification of generally more subtle
responses at a low concentration of estrogen. We also
identified estrogen-responses shared between fish species,
experimental conditions and analytical platforms. This
was achieved by a meta-analysis using our dataset
together with results from three recently published articles
describing hepatic gene expression profiles in fish exposed
to estrogens [16,20,22].

Results
Sensitive gene-expression changes
Both male and female juvenile fish exposed to 0.87 ng
EE2/L were analyzed with microarray. The microarray
analysis of female fish suggested that only three out of
four females had an induced expression of the known
estrogen-responsive gene ZP3. In contrast, an induction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/149

was present in all eight males. This observation suggested
that some juvenile females may have sufficient endogenous estrogen to induce sensitive estrogen-responsive
genes. Thus, in our search for genes responding to low
concentrations of estrogens only the microarray results
from male fish were used.
Thirty-six sets of cDNAs (presumably corresponding to 29
genes) were regulated in male fish both by the low and the
high concentration of EE2 (Table 1). All of the cDNAs
responded in a dose-dependent manner. ZP3 was the
most differentially expressed gene in fish exposed to both
high and low concentrations with a fold change of 84 and
3.5 respectively. VTG was not affected by the low concentration while it was up-regulated 537 times by 10 ng EE2/
L as measured by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) (Figure 1).
Robust gene-expression changes
A meta-analysis was performed with the aim to identify
robust estrogen-responsive genes. The microarray data
from fish (both sexes) exposed to 10 ng/L from the
present study and available microarray data from three
other exposure studies with fish and estradiol (E2) or EE2
were used in the meta-analysis [16,20,22]. Information
about the different studies is shown in Table 2. Transcripts
(360) presumably corresponding to 55 genes or groups of
paralog genes were identified as differentially expressed in
at least two of the four different studies (see Additional
file 1). VTG and ZP3 were differentially expressed in all
four studies and nine genes had an altered expression in
at least three studies (Figure 2). It should be noted that
ZP1 and the estrogen receptor-α, which are well-know
estrogen-responsive genes in fish, have poor sequence representation on the cGRASP microarrays and are therefore
not present in Figure 2.
Confirmation of microarray data with quantitative RTPCR
Genes that were likely to be both sensitive (Table 1) and
robust (Figure 2) were chosen for subsequent qPCR analysis. Three genes fulfilled these criteria: ZP3, a nucleoside
diphosphate kinase (nm23) and fatty acid binding protein 3 (fabp3 or H-FABP). In addition, VTG was subjected
to the qPCR analysis as well as the reference gene ubiquitin. In accordance with the microarray results the expression of VTG, ZP3 and nm23 were significantly induced in
fish exposed to the high concentration. Also, as suggested
by the microarrays, ZP3 and nm23 were significantly
induced by the low concentration as well, whereas VTG
expression was not induced (Figure 1). In stark contrast to
the microarray results fabp3 had no tendency to any regulation caused by the treatment but showed a large variation within each treatment group (data not shown). The
fabp3 and nm23 qPCR products were sequenced in order
to confirm the amplification of the right products and

Our meta-analysis correctly identified some of the most
well known estrogen-responsive genes (VTG, ZP3, ZP2).
This suggests that the approach has a good potential to
identify other robust, less well known estrogen-regulated
genes. We also showed that ZP3 and a hepatic nucleoside
diphosphate kinase nm23 are more sensitive to estrogenic
exposure than the widely used biomarker VTG. As far as
we know, no other microarray study has identified the
effects of as low concentrations of estrogen as used here.
The recognition of nm23 induction as a highly sensitive
response is therefore a novel finding. Thus we propose
that analyses of nm23 together with ZP genes may
increase the possibilities to detect an exposure to low levels of estrogenic compounds in fish. However, more studies are required in order to fully assess the potential of
nm23 as a biomarker.

Gene expression changes of VTG, ZP3 and nm23 measured by qPCR and microarray. Hepatic gene expression in
rainbow trout of vitellogenin (VTG), zona pellucida protein 3
(ZP3) and a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (nm23) after EE2 exposure measured with qPCR (green bars, male fish) or microarray
(blue bars, male fish: red bars, female fish). Values are expressed
as fold change (log2) compared to control fish. Paired student's ttests (single sided) were performed on the qPCR data to confirm/
test the putative regulation suggested from microarray data. VTG,
ZP3 and nm23 were confirmed to be significantly up-regulated in
fish exposed to 10 ng/L (p = 0.001, 0.001 and 0.007 respectively,
four biological replicates in each group). ZP3 and nm23, but not
VTG were up-regulated in fish exposed to 0.87 ng/L (p = 0.0004,
0.006 and 0.5 respectively, eight biological replicates in each
group) in accordance with the microarray data.

Sensitive biomarkers can be used as early warning signals
to indicate exposure and thus potential risk of adverse
effects. It has been suggested that the induction of ZP
mRNAs are more sensitive than induction of VTG [9,23].
However expression of ZP genes can, as most genes, be
affected by other environmental factors, for example cortisol exposure [10-12]. The regulation of a single gene is
rarely sufficient to conclusively demonstrate a specific
exposure, but a combination of responses would together
potentially increase the degree of evidence.
We identified nine genes (or groups of paralog genes) that
were affected by estrogen in at least three out of the four
studies included in the meta-analysis. The known estrogen-responsive genes VTG and ZP3 were up-regulated in
all four studies. The robust gene expression changes of
ZP3, nm23 and fabp3 were also tentatively identified to
be sensitive. However, the induction of fabp3 was not
confirmed by qPCR. The incorrect identification from
microarray data might be explained by cross hybridization to related mRNAs, a known problem for cDNA
microarrays. Nm23, on the other hand, was confirmed
with qPCR to be significantly induced both by a low and
a high water concentration of EE2. In addition, microarray
results from the other studies of rainbow trout exposed to
50 ng EE2/L and dietary exposed to 5 µg/g of E2 further
supports an estrogen-induction of nm23 in rainbow trout
during different exposure conditions [20,22]. The study of
estrogen-exposed medaka did not report nm23 as an
estrogen-responsive gene but it is unclear if nm23 was represented on the medaka microarray [16]. Whether nm23
is regulated by estrogen in other fish species is still an
open question, although mammalian studies suggest a
conserved induction mechanism [24].

ogenetic analysis suggests that nm23-H1 and H2 have
arisen by gene duplication after the speciation event that
gave rise to modern teleost fish and tetrapods [25]. Therefore it is assumed that the salmonid genome would only
have one gene homologue to the nm23 -H1 and -H2
genes. In mammals the nm23-H2 gene encodes the cMYC transcription factor and the nm23-H1 gene has been
shown to be metastasis associated [24]. Moreover, the
nm23-H1 gene and protein is up-regulated by E2-treatment in human breast carcinoma cell lines. This induction seems to be mediated, at least in part, at the
transcriptional level via the estrogen receptor α binding to
an estrogen responsive element in the promoter region of
the human nm23-H1 [24]. The physiological function of
nm23 in fish remains to be determined as well as the possibilities of a regulation by other factors than estrogen
(specificity) and the robustness of the response during
more complex exposure scenarios.

To be useful as a biomarker, a response should ideally be
as robust as possible. In the meta-analysis we tested gene
responses for robustness between species, exposure conditions and analytical platforms. Combining microarray
data from different species and platforms is a challenging
task, particularly when sequence information and good
annotations are limited. We have addressed the cross platform/cross species comparison by using the zebrafish
transcriptome as a reference. In contrast to most other fish

species zebrafish has the advantage of being both well
sequenced and well annotated. However, using zebrafish
as a reference also has limitations, e.g. a lack of identified
homologes for some genes. The results in the meta-analysis were also influenced by the shortage of available
microarray raw data and therefore we had to accept the
different statistical approaches used for selecting estrogenresponsive genes in the different studies.
It is certainly possible that more than nine hepatic genes
are robustly regulated by estrogen in the analyzed species/
conditions. We have only included comprehensive fish
arrays in the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, many genes are
still likely to be represented on only one or a few of the
array platforms which limits the possibility of identifying
robust responses. The choice of microarray platform also
affects the possibilities to accurately identify differentially
expressed genes. Amplicon arrays (cDNA arrays) show less
concordance with other platforms, for example qPCR and
commercially produced high density arrays with oligonucleotide probes or cDNA arrays with synthetic oligonucleotides [26]. Although, it has been shown that when two
independent platforms give consistent results, the outcome of qPCR analysis will most often also be in agreement [27,28]. This adds confidence that several of the
differentially expressed genes identified by the meta-analysis indeed are relatively robust responses.
By making the data on putative sensitive and/or robust
gene responses public, it can be used as a base for further
investigations on the effects of environmental estrogens in
fish in order to develop biomarkers or to increase the
understanding of the physiological impact of environmental estrogens.

Conclusion
We have used microarrays to identify a range of potentially sensitive and/or robust gene expression changes in
fish exposed to estrogen. We have identified the induction
of ZP3 and a hepatic nm23 mRNA as being both sensitive
and presumably robust responses. After further evaluation, nm23 induction would therefore be a good candidate biomarker together with ZP genes to reveal exposure
to low levels of estrogens not sufficient to induce VTG but
still with potential to affect gonadal differentiation of fish.

Methods
Experimental animals, exposure and preparation of
hepatic total RNA
Fish from a previously published study were analysed
[29]. The experimental setup was in short: 15, 14 and 14
juvenile rainbow trout (weighing around 100 g) were
divided into three aquaria and exposed for two weeks to
measured concentrations of 0, 0.87 and 10 ng/L respectively of EE2 in a flow-through system. Water samples were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/149

taken from the low and high EE2 concentration aquaria,
before the transfer of the fish, on day 8 and on day 13.
One sample was collected from the control aquaria on day
8. Solid phase columns were used to extract and purify EE2
from the water followed by derivatization (pentafluorobenzoylester) and further purification. EE2-concentrations were determined using GC/MS. The limit of
detection (signal-to-noise set to 5) was 0.01 ng/L. Samuelsson et al showed that the fish exposed to 10 ng/L EE2
had significantly increased plasma levels of VTG,
increased hepatosomatic index and the plasma metabolite profile were affected by the treatment. However, in the
fish exposed to 0.87 ng/L neither induction of plasma
VTG protein nor an altered metabolite pattern could be
demonstrated using a specific VTG-ELISA and NMR
respectively [29]. Gene responses in liver are widely used
as biomarkers for environmental pollutants, i.e. estrogens, and the hepatic responses to estrogens are not
restricted to a short developmental period. A prerequisite
for our meta-analysis was availability of additional arraydata from the same tissue in estrogen-exposed fish. Only
hepatic microarray data was available in the literature,
which therefore also contributed to our choice of tissue.
Livers were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Total hepatic RNA was isolated from individual trout liver
using TRI reagent (Sigma chemicals Co, St Louis, MO,
USA). RNA quality and quantity were assessed by agarose
gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric measurements (Nanodrop 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, USA
and Spectra MAXplus, Molecular Devices, CA, USA).
Microarray chip, hybridisation and wash
Salmonid cDNA microarrays (GRASP16k v1) were purchased from cGRASP, Univerity of Victoria, BC, Canada
[21]. Microarray fabrication and quality control have previously been described in von Schalburg et al. [30]. The
array contains 13,421 Atlantic salmon (Salmon salar)
cDNAs and 2,576 rainbow trout cDNAs that together with
a few more expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from other salmonid fish results in 16 006 spotted cDNAs in total. It has
previously been shown that the sequence similarity
between the Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout is sufficiently high for cross species use of the array [31].

Several cDNAs on the array correspond to the same gene
and to reduce redundancy, a sequence based clustering
was made as follows. Each cDNA sequence was compared
to all other sequences on the array using BLAST [32]. A
stringent cut-off value of at least 98% sequence similarity
over 250 base-pairs or more was used to define equality.
Single-link clustering was then applied which resulted in
13853 sets of cDNAs.
Slide preparation have been described in detail in von
Schalburg et al. [30]. Briefly, 8 µg of total RNA was reverse

transcribed and labelled using SuperScript Indirect cDNA
labelling System kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
fluorescent dyes Cy5 and Cy3 (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). cDNA from one control fish and one
exposed fish were labelled and hybridised to the same
array. Every other pair was dye swapped to compensate for
cyanine flour effects. Eight male control fish were paired
with male fish exposed to 0.87 ng EE2/L matching individual weights and lengths as closely as possible. Four of
the same male control fish were also paired to fish
exposed to 10 ng EE2/L. In the same way, four female control fish were paired both to females exposed to the low
dose and the high dose. Hybridisation and wash were performed as described before by von Schalburg et al. [30]
with the exception of the prehybridization that was preformed for 1.5 h in 5xSSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% BSA at 49°C.
In total 20 microarrays were analysed.
Microarray analyses
Fluorescent images of hybridized arrays were acquired
using an Agilent MicroArray Scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Intensity data were extracted
from TIFF images using Imagene version 6.0 (BioDiscovery, CA, USA). The statistical analysis was performed using
the R package [33] LIMMA [34], which is available at the
Bioconductor repository [35,36]. For each cDNA on the
chip, M-values (log2 fold change) and A-values (average
log2 intensity) were calculated. Loess normalization was
applied to each array to remove intensity dependent
trends [37]. For each set of cDNAs (defined above), an Mvalue was calculated by taking the average of the M-values
of all the cDNAs in the set. Next, each set was annotated
based on the cDNA with highest A-value (i.e. the spot with
best hybridization). Finally, the sets of cDNAs were
ranked by moderated t-statistic [34] to reduce the proportion of false positives. Data from the complete microarray
experiment is available according to the MIAME guidelines at Array Express [38].
Meta-analysis
Microarray data from four different studies on estrogenexposed fish were subjected to a meta-analysis with the
aim to identify robust estrogen responsive genes
[16,20,22]. Another study with estrogen-exposed adult
female zebrafish was excluded since the control fish presumable had high levels of endogenuous estrogen (neither VTG nor ZP3 was regulated in this study) [39]. To our
knowledge, no other relevant microarray studies covering
more than 3000 cDNAs/transcripts were publicly available (i.e. open access to transcript sequences) in October
2006 when we performed the meta-analyses. The studies
included are summarized in Table 2.

The meta-analysis was done as follows. For each study, a
list of the reported estrogen-regulated genes and the corre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/149

sponding transcripts/cDNA-sequences was created. Note
that the studies used different statistical methods to find
the regulated genes (Table 2).
From the present study, the topmost 250 sets of cDNA
from fish (both female and male) exposed to 10 ng EE2/L
were chosen. To compare the platforms, zebrafish was
used as a reference species. It was chosen since it is almost
fully sequenced and well annotated compared to the
other species involved. All transcripts/cDNAs were compared to the zebrafish transcriptome available through
Ensembl release 40 (26,679 in total) using tblastx [32]. A
cut-off E-value of 10-25 was used to define a match. This
resulted in a list of 360 zebrafish transcripts that had a
match to transcripts/cDNAs from at least two studies (the
transcripts should be regulated in the same direction). The
list of zebrafish transcripts contained both multiple transcripts from the same gene (different splice variants) and
paralogs and therefore the list was clustered into groups of
transcripts. A similarity indicator matrix was created by
comparing all transcripts in the list to each other using
tblastx. Pairs of transcripts with an E-value of 10-50 or less
were defined to be equal. Otherwise the distance was set
to zero. Single link clustering was then applied to create
the groups of transcripts. Finally, all transcripts were
annotated using Ensembl. The complete list of transcripts
is available in Additional file 1.
Quantitative RT-PCR
To confirm regulation of four selected genes, the abundances of the mRNAs were analysed with qPCR. The qPCR
was performed on isolated total RNA from the same fish
used in the microarray analysis. Total RNA (0.5 µg) was
reverse transcribed in duplicate with a mixture of random
hexamers and oligo(dT) primers, using the iScript™ cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The cDNA
synthesis was performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions, except for a scale-down of the reaction volume to 10 µl. Pooled RNA samples were used as no
reverse transcriptase controls to control for genomic contamination. It was discovered that three samples might
have been contaminated with DNA. These samples were
treated with DNase and new qPCR analyses were done.
PCR primers for ZP3 [EMBL:AF231708], nm23
[EMBL:AF350241],
fabp3
[EMBL:U95296],
VTG
[EMBL:X92804], β-actin [EMBL:AJ438158] and ubiquitin
[EMBL:AB036060] were designed using Primer3 software
[40]. Primer sequences were as follows: 5'-ccctgcgtatctttgtgga-3' and 5'-gtgggaacctgtcattttgg-3' for ZP3; 5'-ccttcttccctggtctcgt-3' and 5'-gatgatgttcctgcccactt-3' for nm23 ; 5'ctttccctgtttcccctcct-3' and 5'-tgctgtgtgcttcttgctactc-3' for
VTG; 5'-ggggcagtatggcttgtatg-3' and 5'-ctggcaccctaatcacctct-3' for beta actin; 5'-cgatagacggtggtaagatgg-3' and 5'aggtgtggcaaagggtagtg-3' for fabp3 ; 5'- atgtcaaggccaagatccag -3' and 5'-ataatgcctccacgaagacg -3' for ubiquitin. For

all genes except the reference gene, ubiquitin (for which
the qPCR was performed according to a previously published protocol [41]), the qPCR reactions contained 1×
Real Time PCR Buffer, 3 mM MgCl2, 400 µM dNTP, 300
nM of each primer, 1 U TaKaRa Ex Taq™ R-PCR Version
2.1 (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), 0.25× SYBR Green I
(Molecular Probes Eugene, OR, USA) and cDNA corresponding to 20 ng total RNA, in a final reaction volume of
20 µl. Real-time qPCR was performed on a Stratagene
Mx3005p with 30 sec initial denaturation at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 20s, 60°C for 20s and
72°C for 20s. A melting curve analysis was performed
after each run to verify specific amplification. In addition
the qPCR products were subjected to an agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the expected size of the product.
Both beta actin and ubiquitin were chosen as potential
reference genes. Beta actin had a high variance and also a
tendency to be regulated in the high dose group and therefore only ubiquitin was used. All signals were normalized
against ubiquitin and ratios were calculated for exposed
fish compared to control fish paired in the same manner
as in the microarray analysis. Paired single-sided student's
t-test were performed to test for significantly regulated
genes. Since all samples could not be run at the same occasion, two standard samples were run at all occasions in
order to enable a compensation for a possible run to run
variation. Applying a run to run factor made little difference and the differently expressed genes VTG, ZP3 and
nm23 were significant up-regulated both with and without applying the factor. The presented qPCR results are
calculated without this factor.
