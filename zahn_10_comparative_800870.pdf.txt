Abstract
Background: Molecular genetic studies of floral development have concentrated on several core eudicots and
grasses (monocots), which have canalized floral forms. Basal eudicots possess a wider range of floral morphologies
than the core eudicots and grasses and can serve as an evolutionary link between core eudicots and monocots,
and provide a reference for studies of other basal angiosperms. Recent advances in genomics have enabled
researchers to profile gene activities during floral development, primarily in the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana and
the monocots rice and maize. However, our understanding of floral developmental processes among the basal
eudicots remains limited.
Results: Using a recently generated expressed sequence tag (EST) set, we have designed an oligonucleotide
microarray for the basal eudicot Eschscholzia californica (California poppy). We performed microarray experiments
with an interwoven-loop design in order to characterize the E. californica floral transcriptome and to identify
differentially expressed genes in flower buds with pre-meiotic and meiotic cells, four floral organs at pre-anthesis
stages (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), developing fruits, and leaves.
Conclusions: Our results provide a foundation for comparative gene expression studies between eudicots and
basal angiosperms. We identified whorl-specific gene expression patterns in E. californica and examined the floral
expression of several gene families. Interestingly, most E. californica homologs of Arabidopsis genes important for
flower development, except for genes encoding MADS-box transcription factors, show different expression patterns
between the two species. Our comparative transcriptomics study highlights the unique evolutionary position of E.
californica compared with basal angiosperms and core eudicots.

Background
The eudicots are believed to have originated approximately 130 million years ago [1]. They include about
70% of all flowering plant species and consist of core
eudicots [2-4], which include the groups containing Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus, and species
that branched earlier from these groups and are at basal
positions within the eudicot clade. The earliest

branching lineage of the eudicots, the Ranunculales,
contains the Papaveraceae (poppy) family, of which
Eschscholzia californica (California poppy) is a member
[3]. The core eudicots commonly have stable (that is,
canalized) flower architecture (Figure 1a); by contrast,
the basal eudicots exhibit a wider range of floral patterns [5] (see examples in Figure 1a). Comparing the
morphology and the underlying mechanisms of flower
development between the core and basal eudicots may
help us better understand the evolution of flower structures and development.
Molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis, Antirrhinum
and other core eudicots have uncovered the functions of

many genes involved in regulating flowering time and
floral organ identity and development [6-8]. In particular, it is known that several MADS-box genes are
required to control flowering time and floral organ identities, as well as anther, ovule and fruit development.
These include the well-known ABC genes APETALA1
(A function), APETALA3 and PISTILLATA (B function),
and AGAMOUS (C function) from Arabidopsis, and
their respective functional homologs from Antirrhinum
(SQUAMOSA, DEFICIENS, GLOBOSA, and PLENA)
[9-11]. Comparative studies of core eudicots suggest
that homologs of B- and C-function genes have relatively conserved functions, although some divergences
have also been observed. Putative orthologs of these
MADS-box genes may have diverged expression patterns in different species and the expression difference
between recent duplicates is often associated with subfunctionalization [10,11]. In addition, several MADS-box
genes have been found to be important for floral organ
identities in the monocots [12-15]. However, both the
long evolutionary distance and the highly diverged
flower architectures between monocots and core eudicots have made it difficult to study the evolution of
floral gene function.
The investigation of floral gene function in the basal
eudicots serves to bridge the gap between core eudicots
and monocots. Molecular and expression studies of
floral genes have been reported for some basal eudicots,
providing informative initial knowledge on the conservation and divergence of floral gene activities among eudicots [16-18]. Molecular evolutionary studies of several
MADS-box subfamilies, complemented by expression
analyses, support that some of the MADS-box genes
have maintained conserved functions throughout angiosperm evolution [10,19-22]. For example, expression studies of floral MADS-box genes in E. californica
demonstrated that genes in the AGAMOUS, GLOBOSA
and SEPALLATA subfamilies are highly conserved
between basal and core eudicots [10,11,20]. Additionally,
in other ranunculids, expression divergences have also
been observed between recently duplicated MADS-box
genes [10,11].
High-throughput technologies, including microarrays,
can be used to analyze transcriptomes of individual
floral organs at specific developmental stages. Transcriptome studies have been performed extensively for Arabidopsis and, to a lesser extent, several other highly
derived core eudicots [18,23-28]. Among basal eudicots,
such studies have only been carried out recently in the
basal eudicot Aquilegia, which represents a different
ranunculid lineage than E. californica [29]. E. californica
is a potential model organism because it has a relatively
small plant size, many seeds per fruit and a short generation time, which facilitate genetic studies; because it

Page 3 of 21

does not have determinate flowering and produces multiple flowers over its lifespan, providing easy access to
floral materials [30]; because it has a relatively small
genome; and because it both has an efficient system for
virally induced gene silencing and is transformable
[20,31-34]. Previous gene expression studies in E. californica showed that there is very good correlation
between regions of gene expression and domains of
gene function [18,33,35,36]. An E. californica EST collection of over 6,000 unigenes was constructed from a
pre-meiotic floral cDNA library [20], which provides
gene sequence information for microarray analysis of E.
californica leaf and floral transcriptomes. A transcriptome-level analysis facilitates our understanding of floral
development in basal eudicots and sheds light on potential floral regulatory genes in E. californica.
In this study, we used microarray technology to investigate transcriptomes in E. californica and to identify
differentially expressed genes in developing leaves and
floral buds at pre-meiotic (small buds) and meiotic
(medium buds) stages. Additionally, we examined the
transcriptomes of developing fruits and four types of
floral organs (sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels) at the
pre-anthesis stage. We identified genes that are significantly differentially expressed in different floral organs
or at different floral stages, in comparison with developing fruit and leaf tissues. We also analyzed the expression of genes in several regulatory gene families, some
of which contain homologs of known floral genes from
other organisms. Finally, we compared our results with
similar studies in Arabidopsis and recent studies [29,37]
in Aquilegia and Persea (avocado), a basal angiosperm
related to magnolia, to assess conservation and divergence in gene expression and discuss their implications
for evolution of floral development in the eudicots.

Results and discussion
Construction and use of a microarray chip for E.
californica

To investigate the leaf and reproductive transcriptomes
of E. californica, we generated a custom Agilent microarray chip with features for 6,446 unigenes from the E.
californica EST collection [20] (see Materials and methods for additional information). The oligonucleotide
sequences for the probes were selected using available
sequence information from E. californica ESTs, as well
as other public sequence information, avoiding non-specific hybridization as much as possible. Additional criteria were used to consider potential secondary
structure and hybridization temperature (see Materials
and methods).
A primary objective was to obtain expression profiles
with the power to detect differential expression between
vegetative (leaves) and reproductive organs, between

Zahn et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R101
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R101

different floral stages, and between different floral
organs. Therefore, we sampled the E. californica plants
for the following eight representative organs and stages
(for convenience, referred to generally as tissues hereafter): leaves, early floral buds, medium floral buds, four
floral organs (sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels) at
pre-anthesis, and young fruits. Four sets of plants were
sampled at the same time daily (8:30 to 10:30 am) to
minimize variation due to circadian rhythms, yielding
four biological replicates. RNAs from these 32 samples
were used to generate cDNAs and labeled with Cy3 and
Cy5 dyes for two-channel microarray experiments.
Finally, we used an interwoven loop design (Figure 1b)
to maximize the comparative statistical power using a
limited number of hybridizations [38].
In an interwoven loop design, differences in gene
expression can be estimated for all pairs of tissues with a
relatively small number of hybridizations [39]. Each of
the eight tissues was directly compared on the same slide
with one of four other tissues, with one biological replicate for each comparison, resulting in a total of 16 hybridizations. The comparison of the two tissues on the same
arrays allowed more precise results than those compared
indirectly via other tissues. The specific pairings on the
same array were chosen to optimize precision of comparisons for biologically important comparisons, while keeping the precision of different comparisons as similar as
possible. Because our EST library was constructed with
floral bud mRNAs, we compared developing floral buds
at different stages with each of the four floral organs, and
compared each of these tissues with leaves, the only vegetative organ in this study, and developing fruits. The
comparison between small buds and leaves was aimed at
identifying differentially expressed genes at early reproductive stages. We hypothesized that the sepal should be
the most leaf-like tissue among all floral organs; whereas
previous studies [24] suggest that the stamens might
have the most complex transcriptome among the four
major floral organs [26]. In this study, the fruit tissue
represents the only post-anthesis tissue. We also considered the ABC model, which posits that sepals and petals
both require A-function genes, petals and stamens both
need B-function genes, and stamens and carpels both
depend on C-function genes. In addition, carpels and
fruits were developmentally related tissues, with small
and medium buds representing two consecutive stages in
floral development.
After microarray hybridizations, we tested the quality
of the microarray experiments. We assessed the reproducibility of the microarray hybridizations by determining the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the
biological replicates for each of the eight tissues (see
Figure 2 for an example; the plots for the remaining
seven tissues can be found in Figure S1 in Additional

Page 4 of 21

file 1). As shown in Figure 2, the Pearson’s correlation
coefficients between any pair of the four biological replicates of small buds, one of the most complex tissues in
this study, ranged from 0.94 to 0.97. The high correlation values indicate that our results were highly
reproducible.
In addition, we examined signal intensities. Because
the EST library used for the probe design was constructed from mRNAs of flower buds, we assumed that
expression of most genes should be detected in our
microarray experiments from mostly flower-related tissues. The value of 5.41 for log2 of hybridization intensity (10% quantile of all genes on the chip) was
selected as a cutoff to identify ‘present’ signal (Table 1;
for alternative cutoffs, see Additional file 2 for gene
numbers with 5% or 15% quantiles) similar to previous
microarray experiments in Arabidopsis [28]. For the
10% quantile, we identified the number of genes
detected in leaves (5,905), small buds (5,906), medium
buds (5,876), sepals (5,876), petals (5,870), stamens
(5,877), carpels (5,851) and fruits (5,881). These results
were not surprising because the unigenes were derived
from EST data, which tend to favor genes that are
expressed at relatively high levels. Therefore, our
microarray chip and hybridization experiments were
able to detect the expression of several thousand genes
in eight major tissues of E. californica. Of the genes
examined, the majority of genes present in leaf were
also observed in small buds and medium buds (Figure
3a). In addition, most genes expressed in sepal were
also expressed in petal (Figure 3b), suggesting similar
gene expression levels between these two tissues.
There was significant overlap of genes expressed in
petal and/or sepal with genes expressed in carpel and
stamen (Figure 3c). Similarly, there was considerable
overlap of expressed genes between the carpel and
fruit (Figure 3d); this is not surprising since fruit is
derived from the ovary containing large carpel tissues.
Using the same cutoff for detection of expression,
5,554 genes were expressed in all 8 tissues (Table S1
in Additional file 2). We then examined Gene Ontology (GO) categorization of all 5,554 genes and found
that the ‘unknown’ genes (homolog of genes annotated
as unknown in Arabidopsis) were under-represented
while some specific functional categories were slightly
over-represented, including transferase and protein
binding group (Additional file 3 and Figure S2 in
Additional file 1). The observation that most of the
genes in this study were expressed in all tissues might
be because our EST collection represented relatively
abundant genes, including most house-keeping genes.
This might also explain why the ‘unknown’ category
was under-represented because widely expressed genes
tend to have known annotations.

Figure 2 Correlation coefficients between signal intensities from four biological replicates of the small floral buds. Pearson’s correlation
coefficients were between 0.94 and 0.97 between any pair of the four biological replicates, indicating that the results were highly reproducible.

To verify our microarray results, real-time reversetranscription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using
RNAs from the same eight tissues as those in microarray experiments. Nine representative genes were examined relative to our reference gene (Figure S3 in
Additional file 1), including three MADS-box genes,
EScaAGL2 (87251), EScaAGL6 (86583), and EScaDEF1
(83744) [10]. The other genes were homologs of a transcription factor MYB35 (86850), a gamma-tip protein

(84392), a putative ferrodoxin (85140), a transducin
family/WD-40 repeat family protein (84618), and homologs (86386 and 88941) of two Arabidopsis genes
encoding different ‘expressed proteins’ without a known
function. The real time RT-PCR results indicate that
the gene expression patterns were generally supportive
of the microarray results, and were also consistent with
previous RNA in situ hybridization experiments
[10,11,40,41].

An overview of differential expression profiling of floral
development

Although the E. californica ESTs were obtained from a
cDNA library that was constructed with mRNAs from
multiple stages of floral development [20], many of
the corresponding genes were also expressed in leaves,
different stages and various organs of the flower, as
well as fruits. To determine additional transcriptome
characteristics, we investigated whether specific genes
were expressed similarly or differentially in the tissues
tested. Of the 6,446 unigenes examined, most genes
(4,513 of 6,446) were not significantly differentially
expressed with more than a two-fold change between
any two of the eight tissues (with P-value < 0.05).
Nevertheless, 1,933 genes were found to be differentially expressed between at least two tissues (Table S2 in
Additional file 4); however, most of these 1,933 genes
showed similar expression levels in the other tissues
(Figure 4a). Not surprisingly, carpel and fruit, as well as
small and medium buds, showed the most similar
expression patterns at sequential development stages.
Leaf, the only vegetative organ in our study, had similar

expression patterns to those of the green organs (carpel
and fruit), which may be due to shared high expression
of photosynthesis-related genes (see below). Interestingly, stamen had the most different expression profile,
suggesting a distinct developmental process relative to
the other floral organs.
To obtain additional insights into functions of those
differentially expressed genes, we examined the GO
categorization for the most similar Arabidopsis homologs of each poppy gene using functions within The
Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) website [42]
(Additional file 3). Genes encoding proteins categorized as ‘other enzyme activity’ (chi-square test with
P-value < 0.01) and ‘structural molecule’ (P-value <
0.001) were enriched among those genes differentially
expressed between at least two tissues (Figure 4c) relative to the control group of all genes on the microarray chip (Figure 4b). These results suggested that
variation in the expression of metabolic genes across
those tissues might be responsible, in part, for their
morphological and/or physiological differences in
E. californica.

Similar expression pattern of vegetative preferential
genes in E. californica and in Arabidopsis

To identify genes with greater expression in either vegetative or reproductive tissues, we performed pairwise
comparisons among all tissues as well as groups of floral
organs and/or stages. Only one gene, 90036 (with no

significant BLASTX hits to Arabidopsis predicted proteome, nor the NCBI NR database), was significantly
twofold greater in all reproductive tissues and through
all stages, including fruit, compared to leaf tissue. However, 65 genes were expressed significantly higher in
leaves compared to all floral tissues and stages (Table

S2 in Additional file 4). To obtain overall expression
patterns of vegetative genes, we constructed a heat-map
(Figure 5a) resulting in two main clusters. In the first
cluster, most genes that were highly expressed in leaves
were also highly expressed in floral tissues except stamens. In the second cluster, most genes were highly
expressed in leaves but not in the other tissues.
To compare gene expression pattern of leaf-preferential genes in E. californica and their homologs in Arabidopsis, we used BLAST to search the E. californica EST
sequences against the Arabidopsis genome. Our BLAST
results (with 10E-10 as cutoff) indicate that 58 out of the
65 leaf-preferential genes have identifiable homologs in
Arabidopsis. On the basis of previous microarray data,
of these 58 genes all but one (RBCS1A) of their Arabidopsis homologs were also preferentially expressed in
leaves (Table S4 in Additional file 5) [43]. According to
TAIR9 annotation, most of these genes encode proteins
that are localized in the chloroplast. GO categorization
on the basis of gene function (methods) indicate that
most of these genes are likely to be involved in photosynthesis, encoding homologs of protochlorophyllide
reductases, photosystem I reaction center subunits and
oxygen-evolving enhancer proteins.
Comparing transcriptome profiles at crucial stages of
floral development in E. californica and in Arabidopsis

To identify developmental stage-specific genes in E. californica flowers, we examined the expression patterns of
genes in the pre-meiotic (small buds), meiotic (medium
buds) and pre-anthesis stages (four floral organs: sepals,
petals, stamens and carpels). Pre-meiotic buds (small
buds < 5 mm) had 49 differentially expressed genes in
comparison with any other tissues examined (P-value <
0.05 and two-fold cutoff; Table S2 in Additional file 4).
Among these genes, 30 had identifiable Arabidopsis
homologs, 24 of which have expression data available
(Table S4 in Additional file 5). Unlike leaf-preferential
genes, only 7 of these 24 genes showed expression peaks
in early Arabidopsis flower buds while the rest were predominately expressed in specific floral organs at higher
levels than in leaves. The proteins encoded by these
seven genes include two transcription factors, one oxidoreductase, two peroxidases, one electron carrier and
one gene of unknown function (Table 1, genes and
annotations with peak expression in small floral buds;
information obtained from Markus Schmid’s results
[43]. The Arabidopsis homologs for two transcription
factors, MYB35, which regulates anther cell layer formation at early stages, and a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
gene that has not been fully studied [44,45], were also
preferentially expressed in anthers (X Ma and B Feng,
unpublished data). However, the corresponding E. californica genes were expressed at low levels in the pre-

Page 10 of 21

anthesis stamens, possibly because either these genes are
not highly expressed in E. californica stamens or our
stamen expression data from pre-anthesis stamens were
too late relative to the stages of highest expression in
Arabidopsis, which may be during earlier anther developmental stages.
In medium buds (which span the meiotic stage), we
found eight genes that were expressed twofold significantly higher and none that were significantly downregulated compared with any of the other tissues
examined (Table 1). All of these genes have homologs
in Arabidopsis and most encode proteins that may have
enzymatic activities (Table 1). However, none of the
Arabidopsis homologs of these genes show expression
peaks in the equivalent stages to our medium buds in
Arabidopsis [43] (Table 1; Table S4 in Additional file 5).
Interestingly, the homolog of E. californica gene 88096
in Arabidopsis (AT3G11450) encodes a DnaJ heat shock
protein proposed to be involved in either mitosis or
meiosis. The expression pattern of these homologs differs in that it is highly expressed in both vegetative and
reproductive tissues in Arabidopsis. It is possible that
the gene function might have diverged after the separation of basal eudicots from core eudicots.
In fruits, nine genes were expressed significantly twofold higher than the other tissues in E. californica
(Table 1). None of their homologs showed an expression
peak in the Arabidopsis fruit. Among the genes of particular interest, the Arabidopsis homolog of 86118
(At5g62200, MMI9) plays an important role in embryo
development [46], and its high expression in the fruits
suggests that its E. californica homolog might have a
similar function.
Identification of putative genes under control of certain
genes in the ABC model

According to the ABC model, A-function genes are
transcription factors that are required to properly specify the sepal (alone) and petal (along with B-function
genes) identities, with B-function genes specifying the
stamen (along with C-function genes), and C function
specifying the carpel. Thus, genes expressed in sepals
and petals (regions encompassing the A domain) are
called A-domain genes, genes expressed in petals and
stamens are called B-domain genes, and genes expressed
in stamens and carpels are called C-domain genes.
Although the homologs of Arabidopsis A-function genes
(such as AP1 and AP2) might not have conserved functions in other eudicots [45-47], because of the distinct
sepals and petals in E. californica, we tried to identify
putative A-function genes on the basis of regulatory
genes expressed in the A domain, hypothesizing that
they may function in specifying the sepal and petal identities in E. californica.

expression of their closest Arabidopsis homologs, AGL2/
SEP1 and AGL6, is not sepal-, petal- or even floral-specific (Figure 6d,f). SEP1 is an E-function gene [47,48],
and is involved in the development of all floral organs
in Arabidopsis. A homolog of SEP1 in soybean
(GmSEP1) is expressed in reproductive development,
especially in petals and seed coats [49]. AGL6 and its
homologs have been shown to function in flower development not only in eudicots, like Arabidopsis and Petunia, but also in orchid, rice, and other monocots. In the
grasses, AGL6 has high expression in paleas, lodicules,
carpels and ovule integuments, as well as the receptacle
[50-54]. We hypothesize that other MADS genes, possibly SEP homologs, may serve as A-function genes in
E. californica instead of AP1 and AP2 in Arabidopsis, in
part because the AP1 subfamily is closely related to the
AGL6 and SEP subfamilies [55].
B-function genes, such as the Arabidopsis APETALA3
and PISTILLATA genes, are required for the identities
of petals and stamens [9,11,56]. In monocots like tulip,

From our hypothesis that A-domain genes should be
more highly expressed in sepals, and possibly in petals,
than in the other floral organs, we compared them with
three tissues: leaf, stamen and carpel collected approximately 1 day pre-anthesis. We found significantly
greater expression of 64 genes in sepals over each of the
above 3 tissues and 49 genes in petals over each of the
3 tissues, respectively (Table S5 in Additional file 6).
When compared with all 7 other tissues, 34 genes in
sepals and 29 genes in petals were significantly preferentially expressed (Table S2 in Additional file 4). Whereas
genes highly expressed in sepals or petals tended to be
expressed in all tissues at moderately high levels (Figure
5b,c), genes with lower expression in sepals and/or
petals were scarcely expressed in other tissues. On the
basis of comparisons of petals and sepals with leaves,
stamens and carpels, only five genes were expressed
twofold greater in tissues controlled by A-function
genes (Table 2). Interestingly, two of these genes are
members of the MADS-box family. However, the

Figure 6 The expression levels of MADS transcription factor families. (a-f) Expression of E. californica homologs of B function genes AP3 (a)
and PI (b), C function gene AG (c), E function genes, SEP1 (d) and SEP3 (e), and AGL6 (f) in eight tissues compared with their counterparts in
Arabidopsis. All the expression values are log2 ratio. The y-axis is the log2 ratio of gene expression levels. C, carpel; F, fruit; L, leaf; MB, medium

homologs of AP3 and PI are expressed in the tepals
(petal-like organs found in the outer two whorls). We
searched for putative B-domain genes on the basis of
their expression patterns in E. californica and found
that 60 genes in petals and 180 genes in stamens were
expressed significantly higher in these organs than in
sepals, carpels and leaves (Table S5 in Additional file 6).
And 94 genes were expressed twofold significantly
greater in stamens than all the other organs (Table S2
in Additional file 4). The large number of genes with
stamen-preferential expression patterns suggests that the
development of stamen requires more specialized genes.
Alternatively, the larger number of stamen-preferential

genes identified here may be explained by the fact that
stamens comprise much of the biomass of developing E.
californica buds, relative to other developing floral
organs (Figure 5d).
We combined the expression data from petals and stamens to represent the B-domain group and compared
their expression levels with those of leaves, sepals, carpels and fruits (Table 2), identifying 13 genes as preferentially expressed in the B-domain organs. A homolog
of PI (87167) and two homologs of AP3 (83744 and
87005) were identified in this group [11] (Table S5 in
Additional file 6). Since PI and AP3 are B-function
genes in Arabidopsis and other species, such as lily

Zahn et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R101
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R101

[57-59], it is possible that their homologs in E. californica function in a similar manner. It should also be
noted that in situ analysis showed that the AP3 homologs are also expressed in ovules in E. californica [11],
suggesting that they may have roles outside of Bfunction.
Of the genes preferentially expressed in the B-domain,
one is a homolog of the AtbZIP61 gene, which encodes
a putative transcription factor and is expressed in Arabidopsis flowers, with especially high expression in petals.
It is not known whether AtbZIP61 regulates floral development in Arabidopsis. However, on the basis of its
expression pattern and that of its homolog in E. californica, we speculate that it functions to regulate petal
development and is downstream of the B-function
genes.
In Arabidopsis, C function is controlled by AGAMOUS, which specifies stamens and carpels. When
compared with leaves, sepals and petals, 26 genes were
preferentially expressed in carpels (compared to 168
genes in stamens; Table S5 in Additional file 6). We
searched for C-domain genes and found that seven
genes (Table S5 in Additional file 6) were expressed
twofold significantly greater in stamens and carpels than
in leaves, sepals and petals. Among them was a homolog
of the Arabidopsis C-function gene AG [59]. Since both
monocots (rice) and other eudicots have AG homologs
functioning in stamen and carpel development, we
hypothesize that the AG homolog in E. californica has
similar functions [10,60,61]. It has been proposed that
D-domain genes are required for ovule development,
but only one E. californica gene (88769) was expressed
in carpels twofold significantly higher over all other tissues. This EST did not have an identifiable Arabidopsis
homolog.
To uncover additional candidates of A-, B- or Cdomain genes, we used less stringent criteria and
selected genes with expression levels at least twofold
higher in each pre-anthesis reproductive tissue than in
leaves (with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05; Figure
3e,f; Table S6 in Additional file 7). We found that
most of these genes were expressed in a whorl-specific
manner and only a small numbers of genes were coupregulated in sepals and petals, in petals and stamens,
or in stamens and carpels. Furthermore, the overlap of
A/B-domain and that of B/C-domain genes were even
smaller (Figure 3e,f). Unlike studies in Persea and
Aquilegia, whose floral transcriptomes were interpreted
as support for a ‘fading borders’ model of floral organ
identity [29,62], the E. californica floral transcriptomes
were rather distinctive, providing a molecular explanation for the morphologically different sepals and petals.
Therefore, E. californica might have adopted an ABC
model with relatively sharp borders, similar to those

Page 13 of 21

found in core eudicots. Because E. californica is basal
to Aquilegia within the Ranunculales, as determined by
phylogenetic analyses [37], it may be that sharply
defined floral organ borders represent an ancestral
state for all eudicots, but has been lost in some more
derived lineages.
Expression profiles of members of regulatory gene
families

To gain further insights into the transcriptional activities
of putative regulatory genes in floral development, we
focused on gene families that are homologous to known
regulators of plant development, particularly those
encoding known or putative transcription factors. For
convenience, we will refer to their predicted functions
without using the words putative or predicted.
MADS-box genes

Genes encoding proteins containing a MADS-box DNA
binding domain represent the best-studied floral gene
family, of which multiple members are crucial for floral
development. In E. californica the expression of
EscaAG1 (84248), EscaAG2 (86612), EScaAGL2 (87251),
EScaAGL9 (87125), EScaAGL11 (89484), EScaGLO
(87167), EScaDEF1 (83744) and EScaDEF2 (87005) have
been studied with in situ hybridization [10,11,40,41].
Additionally, MADS-box genes homologous to those
lacking characterized functions in Arabidopsis were
included on our array, such as EScaAGL54 (87912).
Expression of EScaAGL54 was highest in small buds,
but showed similar levels in all the other tissues, suggesting a putative function in early floral stages.
To further understand the expression of the E. californica MADS-box genes, we plotted E. californica unigene
expression profiles in comparison to the closest Arabidopsis homologs [11]. Expression patterns were largely
similar between the two species, but there were some
interesting differences (Figure 6). Both of the E. californica AP3 homologs showed similar expression patterns
to AP3, differing only in that 87005 (EscaDEF2) showed
lower expression in all tissues relative to 83744 (EscaDEF1) or AP3 in Arabidopsis (Figure 6a). At the same
time, 87167 (EscaGLO), a homolog of PI, showed similar
expression to PI in Arabidopsis (Figure 6b). Additionally,
an E. californica homolog of the Arabidopsis C-function
gene AG showed similar expression to that of AG (Figure
6c). Besides those key MADS-box genes regulating floral
development, we found that E. californica homologs of
E-function genes also have similar expression patterns to
E-function genes in Arabidopsis (Figure 6d,e).
Homologs of other MADS-box genes demonstrated
different expression patterns. Unigene 84248 (EscaAG1,
an AG homolog [63]) was highly expressed in stamens
and carpels as expected, while 86612 (EscaAG2, a

Zahn et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R101
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R101

second AG homolog [63]) exhibited similar levels of
expression in all floral tissues, suggesting a divergent
function for this gene in E. californica flower development (Figure 6c). Also, the homolog of AGL6 (86583)
also showed higher expression in sepals and petals (Figure 6f), in contrast to the low expression of the Arabidopsis AGL6 gene in sepals on the basis of microarray
expression [43]. Since a homolog of A-function gene has
not been found in E. californica, it is possible that 86583
may function in the outer two whorls as an A-function
gene (Figure 6f).

AGO

The ARGONAUTE (AGO) family is involved in RNA
post-transcriptional regulation [64]. In Arabidopsis,
members of the AGO family are involved in floral development, most likely through microRNA and small interfering RNA silencing. Our microarray included ten
members of the AGO family, all of which were differentially expressed in at least one tissue (Figure 7a,b;
expression data of family members are listed in Additional file 8). Among those genes, there was an interesting pattern, which identified three genes that were

family and (g) The bHLH gene family in eight tissues. All the expression values are log2 ratio. The same abbreviations of different tissues were
used as in figure 5.

Zahn et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R101
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R101

generally highly expressed in all organs while the
remaining seven genes were expressed at moderate to
low levels.
Among the genes examined in this study, three AGO1
homologs (one in the high expression group and two in
the low expression group) shared similar expression patterns: twofold higher expression in petals, pre-meiotic and
meiotic buds than in sepals. The AGO genes in Arabidopsis encode proteins with a PAZ domain (with nucleic acid
binding activity [65]) and are expressed at similar levels in
different tissues, except for PAZ-1, which was preferentially expressed in carpel, pre-meiotic and meiotic buds
compared with sepal with more than twofold changes.
MYB

MYB transcription factors contain DNA binding
domains and some have been identified as flower developmental regulators [66,67]. Eleven E. californica MYB
genes were included on our microarray. Most MYB
genes showed dramatic differential expression among
tissues, but two were not differentially expressed among
any of the tissues tested (Figure 7c; Additional file 8).
One homolog of At4g32730 (MYB1) was expressed at
higher levels in mature petals and stamens, suggesting
that this gene may have a role in B function. A homolog
of At4g32730 (AtMYB3R1) was significantly preferentially expressed (more than twofold higher) in the premeiotic bud in comparison with sepals, petals, and stamens and carpels. A homolog of At3g28470 (AtMYB35)
was also preferentially expressed in pre-meiotic buds
compared with all seven other tissues. A homolog of
At4g01680 (AtMYB55) was significantly preferentially
expressed in fruit in comparison with leaves, pre-meiotic
and meiotic buds, petals, sepals and stamens. An
At2g37630 (AtMYB91/AS1) homolog was more varied
in expression but generally showed lower expression in
stamens than in carpels, fruits, leaves, pre-meiotic and
meiotic buds and lesser down-regulation in petals relative to carpels, leaves and pre-meiotic buds. Last but not
least, a homolog of At3g61250 (AtMYB17) was
expressed twofold significantly higher in meiotic buds
compared with fruits.
Zinc Finger Homeodomain genes

Zinc Finger Homeodomain (ZHD) genes are expressed
during floral development in Arabidopsis [68]. Our
microarray contained four genes in this family. Two
homologs of At1g75240 (ATHB33) were expressed without significant difference across all tissues. Of these two
genes, one (88691) was expressed highly in both vegetative and reproductive organs while the other was barely
expressed in all tissues, suggesting a functional divergence between these two paralogs (Figure 7d).
ARF

Auxin-response factors (ARFs) are believed to regulate
auxin responsive genes [69,70]. This family contains

Page 15 of 21

ETTIN (At2G33860), a developmental regulatory gene
that acts on regional identity in the perianth, stamens
and carpels [71]. Most of the poppy ARF genes that
were included on our microarray showed no differential
expression among the tissues examined (Figure 7e).
Only one gene, a homolog of At5g62000 (ARF2, 84471),
showed twofold significantly different expression: twofold lower in stamens when compared with all tissues
but sepal; and twofold lower in sepals compared with
carpels, fruits and pre-meiotic buds.
bZIP

The bZIP (basic-leucine zipper) protein family contains
the Arabidopsis FD (At4G35900, FD-1) and PERIANTHIA (At1G68640) genes, which are involved in
flower development and the HY5 (At5G11260) gene
involved in root development. Our array contained 12
members of this family, one of which was not differentially expressed among all tissues examined (Figure 7f;
Additional file 8). From our microarray results, most of
these genes showed only slightly different expression
levels except the homologs of bZIP7 (83748) and bZIP8
(87035), both of which were expressed highly in stamens, with bZIP8 also highly expressed in petals. Previous studies of genes of the bZIP family suggested that
some of them may act downstream of B-function genes
to regulate floral development [72-74]. Because the
homolog of bZIP8 was co-expressed with B-function
genes, we speculate that this gene might have a function
similar to that of the Arabidopsis homolog. In addition,
a homolog of At4g38900 is expressed at a level twofold
higher in sepals than in stamens.
bHLH

The basic helix-loop-helix family contains several Arabidopsis genes regulating flower development, including
SPATULA, which controls the development of the carpel margins [75]. Eleven members of this family were
included on our microarray, seven of which showed no
significant differential expression (Figure 7g; Additional
file 8). The other four genes demonstrated twofold differential expression among tissues examined. A homolog
of At2g31210 (bHLH91, 89282) was most highly
expressed in pre-meiotic buds and the expression level
was at least twofold higher than in all the other tissues;
also, its expression level in meiotic buds was at least
twofold higher than any other floral organs. Since
At2g31210 has an important role in anther development
in Arabidopsis [45], its homolog in E. californica may
function in a similar manner. Another gene, a homolog
of At5g09460 (bHLH143), was also expressed at a higher
level in the pre-meiotic buds than in sepals, petals and
stamens and in meiotic buds. Additionally, this gene
was expressed twofold higher in carpels and fruits than
in stamens. A homolog of At1g26260 (bHLH76, CIB5)
was expressed in pre-meiotic buds significantly twofold

Zahn et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R101
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R101

higher than in fruits and stamens. A homolog of
At3g26744 (bHLH116/ICE1) was significantly downregulated by twofold in stamens relative to carpels,
fruits, leaves, meiotic buds and petals. This gene was
also significantly more highly expressed by twofold in
petals over sepals. The expression patterns of bHLH
genes suggest that they might regulate several aspects of
floral development and/or physiology, but are not necessarily associated with ABC functions. Further study of
bHLH genes, and indeed many of the floral gene
families examined here, in Arabidopsis and other species, including E. californica, may uncover their functions and reveal possible functional conservation among
the eudicots.

Conclusions
We examined transcriptome landscapes from eight tissues of the basal eudicot E. californica and identified
preferentially expressed genes within and among floral
developmental tissues, fruits and leaves. By comparing
genes showing tissue-preferential expression patterns in
E. californica, we found that genes preferentially
expressed in specific reproductive organs or at certain
stages tended to have less conserved expression levels
compared with Arabidopsis than those preferentially
expressed in leaves (Tables 1 and 2; Table S4 in Additional file 5). One possible explanation is that most of
the leaf-preferential genes encode highly conserved
chloroplast proteins.
We also identified the co-expressed and tissue-specific
floral genes and characterized the signature of ABC
domain genes. Our comparison of the gene expression
patterns in E. californica, Aquilegia, Persea and Arabidopsis showed that the E. californica results support a
‘sharp border’ model, similar to that for core eudicots
such as Arabidopsis, rather than the ‘fading border’
model in other basal angiosperms [29,62]. This is consistent with the clear morphological distinction of sepals
and petals, and the lack of intermediate floral organs
such as staminodes in E. californica flowers. In contrast,
Aquilegia flowers have similar outer perianth organs
and a distinct type of floral organ between stamens and
the carpels, which is in good agreement with the microarray results of the floral organs [29]. Therefore,
although both E. californica and Aquilegia are basal
eudicots, the morphological and expression characteristics strongly suggested that they have divergent developmental programs, with E. californica more similar to
core eudicots and Aquilegia resembling basal angiosperms. Our analysis of E. californica further suggested
that flowers with distinct perianth organs might have
originated at an earlier time than the ancestor of core
eudicots. This study along with other works [21,29]

highlight the importance of careful analysis of basal
eudicots as an intermediate group of flowering plants to
provide crucial information to bridge the gap between
highly canalized core eudicots and morphological flexible basal angiosperms.
Our data also provide an overview of divergence and
conservation between different species. The highly similar expression patterns of B- and C-function genes compared with the varied expression levels of other MADSbox genes in Arabidopsis and E. californica suggest that
the conserved expression of only a few key genes may
result in the high similarity of flower morphology
between Arabidopsis and E. californica. The transcriptome analysis of other families with known functions in
floral development indicates their possible roles in E.
californica. Recent study of protein-protein interactions
in basal eudicots (Euptelea pleiospermum, Akebia trifoliata and Pachysandra terminalis) suggested that
MADS-box genes that interact with each other have coevolved. This is most likely due to the fact that the
majority of the protein-protein interactions are expected
to be conserved to some extent to orchestrate floral
architecture [76]. However, Zhao et al. [70] showed the
AP1 lineage had a distinct interaction pattern; this,
together with our results that AGL6 and SEP homologs
are expressed in the A-domain, supports that A-function
genes show less conservation [56]. In Arabidopsis, AP1
not only regulates the development of sepal and petal,
but also integrates growth, patterning and hormonal
pathways [77]. This dual function of AP1 observed in
the core eudicots might be a more recent innovation
that evolved since the divergence of the core from the
basal eudicots.
Many of the genes showing tissue-specific expression
noted in this study have homologs in Arabidopsis that
are currently lacking in functional analyses. This study,
when compared with similar studies in Arabidopsis and
other species, should help us identify genes of interest
that may play important, conserved roles in floral development [26,28,29]. We have identified a number of candidate genes that share similar expression patterns
between E. californica and Arabidopsis but have not
been functionally characterized. Our results suggest that
E. californica has a similar floral program to the core
eudicots, despite a mostly divergent set of genes outside
of the MADS-box family. These results not only indicate
that different regulatory machinery may operate among
basal eudicots, but that canalized floral development
might have originated prior to the core eudicots. Our
findings also allow for informative comparisons with
other species, allowing hypothesis formulation and stimulating further experimentation in model organisms,
which now includes E. californica.

Materials and methods
Tissue collection and RNA isolation

Sixteen E. californica cv. ‘Aurantica Orange’ (JL Hudson
Seedsman, La Honda, California, USA) plants were
grown from seeds in a controlled greenhouse environment at the Pennsylvania State University (University
Park, PA) under 16 hours light and watered and fertilized as needed. To avoid potential expression differences among collections due to circadian rhythms,
leaves and floral tissues were only collected from individual plants between 8:30 and 10:30 am. Developing
leaves of less than 5 mm length, developing fruits, premeiotic (small) buds less than 5 mm long, meiotic (medium) buds of 5 to 10 mm length and pre-anthesis sepals,
petals, stamens and carpels were collected from 16
plants, immediately placed in liquid nitrogen and stored
in a -80°C freezer until RNA extraction. Tissues from a
group of four plants were then pooled to create one biological replicate, for a total of four replicates.
Probe design for the E. californica transcriptome

To design oligonucleotide probes for E. californica, a
two-stage pipeline for oligonucleotide probe design,
Microarray Oligonucleotide Design and Integration Tool
(MODIT) was used (probe information provided in
Additional file 9). Briefly, MODIT integrates two existing programs: Array Oligo Selector (v.6; AOS) and OligoArray (v.8; OA), with subsequent independent
evaluation and optimization steps. The pipeline enables
one to design a set of probes having well-defined
sequence and thermodynamic properties by first taking
advantage of the strict thermodynamic criteria of OA to
produce a partial set of optimized probes, and then filling in the set from among the large number of probes
selected by AOS, after screening them for thermodynamic compatibility.
The MODIT pipeline screens candidate probes based
on three parameters: high sequence specificity, appropriate melting temperature Tm, and lack of stable secondary structure. The first criterion, sequence specificity,
was determined using BLAST and Smith-Waterman
local alignment tools to eliminate probes having a
match to any non-target sequences of more than 15
consecutive nucleotides, or an overall match of more
than 30 nucleotides [78-80]. The second criterion was
that the probe set should have very similar T m . The
MODIT user is informed of probes with Tm outside a
recommended range by flagging in the database, and
she/he can decide whether to use such probes. A third
criterion was the lack of stable secondary structure.
MODIT allows values of probe ΔG SS above -0.5 kcal.
mol -1 , less than the energy of one hydrogen bond
between bases [81]. We use melting temperature to
independently recalculate a consistent set of

Page 17 of 21

thermodynamic properties for the probes and check for
consistency [82]. The pipeline stores comprehensive
information about probe thermodynamic properties and
potential cross-reactions in a MySQL database, so that
they can subsequently be used in array data analysis.
The MODIT pipeline was used to generate one 60base probe for each gene in the 6,846 E. californica
Unigene set [83,84], after masking regions that were
conserved in multigene families in Arabidopsis, rice
(Oryza) and Populus. Unigenes were sorted into gene
families using PlantTribes [85] and conserved sites in
the multiple sequence alignment were identified using
the column score metric calculated by CLUSTAL [86].
A sodium concentration of 0.5 M was used in modeling of thermodynamic properties, following hybridization conditions recommended by Agilent for their
60-mer Arabidopsis Oligo Microarray Kit, and the
conditions modeled by Lee et al. [87]. The probe concentration range that was used in the thermodynamics
calculations is 2.44 mM following the calculations of
Riccelli et al. [88] and assuming the default 1 nM target recommended in [89]. In the OA run, duplex
melting temperature T m was constrained above 70°C,
and the duplex T m for predicted cross-reactions and
stable secondary structures was constrained below 60°
C. For the AOS run, the constraint on GC content
was maintained around 52%. Duplex melting temperature was constrained to keep 20°C separation between
the upper and lower T m limits, to allow for selection
of more candidate probes. The probe maximum and
minimum match for non-target sequences were maintained at 15 and 10 nucleotides, respectively. When
the two sets of probes were merged, the constraints
applied to the merged set were: 80°C ≤ T m ≤ 90°C,
overall match with non-target as well as with consensus sequences should be less than 30 nucleotides and
ΔG SS above -0.5 kcal.mol -1 . Since one goal of this
design was to obtain complete coverage of all target
sequences, a selection of known suboptimal probes
was added back to the final design (Additional file 9,
column 5), and their sequence and thermodynamic
properties tracked in the MODIT database. The
design results obtained using MODIT for the target
sequences from E. californica are summarized in
Additional file 9. No application, including MODIT,
could provide 100% target coverage while satisfying all
of the design criteria for each probe. However,
MODIT improved on target coverage and significantly
limited potential cross-reactions relative to OA, while
nearly eliminating probes that were predicted to form
stable secondary structure.
Oligonucleotides of 60-bp length were designed from
6,446 E. californica unigenes obtained from a floral EST
library [20] and cell culture suspension library [90].

Zahn et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R101
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R101

Unigene builds were performed as described by Carlson
et al. [20] and then sorted into putative gene families
using the PlantTribes database [85]. Because the complete genome of E. californica is not yet sequenced, oligos were designed to specifically exclude conserved
regions, when identified, so that expression analyses
putatively represent single genes (see above). Oligonucleotide probes were arrayed on glass slides by Agilent
(La Jolla, CA, USA).
RNA extraction, microarray hybridization and scanning

RNA was isolated from eight tissues examined each with
four biological replicate pools and cleaned using the
RNeasy plant mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California,
USA) following Agilent’s instructions. RNA concentrations were quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
and stored at -80°C before use, with yields of 20 to 35
micrograms of total RNAs from approximately 100 mg of
tissues. Approximately 400 ng of total RNAs were used
for cRNA synthesis with Cyanine 3-dCTP and Cyanine5dCTP (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Inc., Downers Grove,
Illinois, USA) incorporation, using the Agilent Low RNA
Input Kit (Agilent), according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Qiagen’s RNeasy mini-spin columns were used to
purify amplified cRNA samples. Sample concentrations
were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, Delaware, USA). Hybridization was performed using the In situ Hybridization
Kit (Agilent) with 35 ng of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cRNA
following the manufacturer’s instructions at 65°C for 17
hours. Prior to scanning, each slide was washed, rinsed
and dried in Agilent’s Stabilization and Drying Solution,
as directed. Scanning was performed using a Gene Pix
4000A scanner and the Gene Pix Pro 3.0.6 Software
(Axon Instruments (now Molecular Devices), Union City,
California, USA) to produce two TIFF images at 532 nm
and 635 nm. The microarray data have been submitted
to the Gene Expression Omnibus database, with accession number [GEO:GSE24237].
Statistical analyses of genes differentially expressed
among tissues and developmental stages

Analyses were performed with the R programming language [91] and the limma package Bioconductor [92].
Arrays were background corrected and loess normalized
within arrays and Aq normalized between arrays [93].
Agilent controls and other control probes were removed
from the data. For the 93 E. californica oligos with multiple probes, we chose the probe with the highest 75%
quantile value among the normalized ‘A’ intensities of
all 16 arrays. A one-way single-channel empirical Bayes
ANOVA was used to identify those genes [94,95] that
were significantly differentially expressed among the
seven floral RNAs and one leaf RNA examined, with an

Page 18 of 21

FDR of 0.05. Additionally, significant differences
between combinations of more than one floral organ
and leaf were also identified under the same parameters.
In order to identify those genes that were most likely
to be organ/stage-specific in E. californica, we examined
those genes with a significantly (FDR = 0.05) twofold
greater expression in a single organ/stage relative to all
other tissue stages examined. The expression of these
genes was then compared to the expression, as determined by Affymetrix arrays [28], to their closest identified Arabidopsis homolog based on a tribe-MCL
analysis, when available, to determine which genes may
have conserved expression profiles. We were able to
directly compare expression in pre-meiotic and meiotic
buds in E. californica versus inflorescences containing
stage 1 to 9 flowers in Arabidopsis (developing inflorescences), the E. californica fruit, capsules, versus the Arabidopsis fruit, siliques, Arabidopsis flowers at stage 12
nearing pre-anthesis versus sepals, petals stamens and
carpels at anthesis in E. californica and genes preferentially expressed in leaves in both organisms.
Real-time PCR experiments

To test the reliability of our microarray hybridizations,
nine genes and one reference were investigated using
quantitative RT-PCR. RNA (1 μg) of each tissue was treated with DNase (Invitrogen, Eugene, Oregon, USA), followed by reverse transcription using the Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). We then performed real
time PCR using DyNAmo SYBR Green qPCR Kit from
New England Biolabs (Ipswitch, Massachusetts, USA)
under the following parameters: 95°C for 10 minutes, 40
cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1 minute. Fluorescence
intensity was measured using Applied Biosystems’ 7300
Sequence Detection System (Carlsbad, California, USA).
Eca_2514 (Unigene84142) was chosen as the reference
gene as it was not significantly differentially expressed
among any of our examined tissues in the microarray
experiments and it was expressed at a moderate level in all
our tissues compared to all other genes. The relative
amounts of cRNA converted from a messenger RNA was
calculated using intensities corresponding to ‘experimental’ genes relative to the reference gene. We performed triplicate reactions for all tissues with samples containing no
reverse transcriptase and no RNA as negative controls. All
primer information is provided in Additional file 9.
