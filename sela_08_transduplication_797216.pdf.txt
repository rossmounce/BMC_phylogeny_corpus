Abstract
: Transposable elements may acquire unrelated gene fragments into their sequences in a process
called transduplication. Transduplication of protein-coding genes is common in plants, but is
unknown of in animals. Here, we report that the Turmoil-1 transposable element in C. elegans has
incorporated two protein-coding sequences into its inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences. The
ITRs of Turmoil-1 contain a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM) that originated from the rsp2 gene and a fragment from the protein-coding region of the cpg-3 gene. We further report that
an open reading frame specific to C. elegans may have been created as a result of a Turmoil-1
insertion. Mutations at the 5' splice site of this open reading frame may have reactivated the
transduplicated RRM motif.

Findings
The possible contribution of transposable elements to the
proteome has been discussed in several publications [1-7]
and has provoked much debate [8]. Many mechanisms
are known to increase the protein-domain repertoire, e.g.,
domain duplication, substitution mutations, insertions,
deletions, and domain rearrangements [9]. In metazoans,
a transposable element may result in transduction, in
which a DNA segment downstream of transposable elements is mobilized as part of an aberrant transposition.
This may result in gene duplication or exon shuffling, subsequently enriching the protein repertoire [10-13]. How-

ever, in the process of transduction, the transposable
element does not acquire gene fragments as part of its
sequence.
In plants, on the other hand, thousands of transposable
elements contain duplicated gene fragments, captured in
a process termed transduplication. Transduplication is a
potentially rich source of novel coding sequences within
rice and Arabidopsis thaliana [14-16]. Recently, transduplications of small nucleolar (sno) RNA by retroposon-like
non-LTR transposable elements were found in the C. elegans [17] and platypus genomes [18].

The Harbinger superfamily of "cut-and-paste" DNA transposons was discovered through in silico studies [19]. This
superfamily is characterized by Harbinger-specific transposases that are distantly related to the transposases
encoded by the IS5-like group of bacterial transposons,
such as IS5, IS112, and ISL2. Harbinger transposons are
not as widespread as the eukaryotic hAT and mariner/Tc1
transposons; they are found in plants and nematodes [1923] but not in mammals. Usually, Harbinger transposons
are flanked by 3-bp target site duplications and 25- to 50bp inverted terminal repeats (ITRs).
Turmoil-1 is a 5,024-bp long DNA transposon with 760bp long ITRs and a Harbinger-specific transposase (Figure
1A). These ITRs are unique to Turmoil-1 and are not found
in other members of the Harbinger superfamily of DNA
transposons [24]. One complete copy of the Turmoil-1 was
found on chromosome II of C. elegans; eight Turmoil-1
fragments exist in the genome (for detailed information,
see Table 1). An analysis of C. elegans transposable elements [25,26] revealed that a 205-bp ITR sequence within
Turmoil-1 is highly similar to a region of two exons separated by an intron of the rsp-2 gene (see pairwise alignment using bl2seq [27] Figure 1B). These two exons
encode the RNA Recognition Motif (RRM), which is
found in many eukaryal and bacterial proteins. Specifically, the type of RRM domain present in the rsp-2 (called
RRM1) gene is highly conserved evolutionarily [28]. The
high similarity between the ITR sequence and the fragment of the rsp-2 gene implies that one originated from
the other. The antiquity of this domain and a phyloge-

netic analysis (Figure 2) indicate that Turmoil-1 has
recently acquired a portion of the rsp-2 gene sequence into
its ITR. Tree reconstruction was performed with the
PhyML program version 2.4.5 [29] using among-site rate
variation with four discrete rate categories, and the JTT
model [30] of sequence evolution.
A comparative analysis of the rsp-2 gene and the 205-bp
region of the gene found in the ITR sequence, revealed
that the Turmoil-1 sequence has accumulated several point
mutations within the 5' splice site that make it non-functional, whereas the 3' splice site of the intron remains
intact (the mutations in the 5' splice site region are
marked in red in Figure 1B). Since the RRM domain
within the Turmoil-1 DNA transposon is not under purifying selection to maintain the reading frame or the functionality of the splice sites, these mutations are not
unexpected.
Within the same ITR domain of Turmoil-1, and very close
to the site of insertion of the RRM domain of rsp-2 gene,
there is evidence of another "DNA kidnapping" event. A
131-bp fragment from the coding region of C. elegans gene
cpg-3, which is unique to nematodes, was inserted into the
ITR (Figure 1C). No sequences homologous to Turmoil-1
flank the cpg-3 gene. Thus, similar to the rsp-2 case, a gene
fragment from the cpg-3 most likely was acquired by Turmoil-1, and not vice-versa. As the gene fragments are
present on both sides of the ITR, capture may have
occurred through non-homologous recombination.

One of the Turmoil-1 copies (number 1 in Table 1) contains within it an open reading frame (ORF) with the
accession number Y48G1BL.4. It contains two putative
exons and an intron (Figure 3), which are similar to the
RRM domain. The 5' splice site that corresponds to that in
the rsp-2 transcript has been mutated. A novel 5' splice site
is most likely located nine nucleotides downstream from
the original one. At this site, a point mutation changed an
AT into a GT dinucleotide (marked in red in Figure 3).
Usage of this 5' splice site maintains the ORF equivalent
to that of the RRM domain of rsp-2 with the exception of
the addition of three amino acids. These additional residues should have a negligible effect on the three-dimensional structure of the RRM domain (Figure 3C). This
ORF, however, may not be transcriptionally active as its
sequence is only found in the UNIPROT database (accession number Q9N3P9), and there is no EST or cDNA supporting evidence. If this is the case, it would be consistent
with reports that indicate that all known transduplicates
in rice, in spite of their genomic abundance, are pseudogenes [16].

avalanche in animals, we'll see. I think the paper is fine for
publication with the exception of "open read [ing] frame"
in the abstract.

Our analysis indicates that Turmoil-1 of C. elegans has captured two unrelated coding sequences within its ITRs at
proximate locations. The presence of a transduplication
"hotspot" in this region may be tentatively inferred. This
analysis reveals a transduplication of protein-coding
regions in C. elegans and strengthens the hypothesis that
protein domains may be mobilized by transposable elements.

This is an interesting and straightforward paper reporting
the presence of transduplication in Caenorhabditis. The
report of transduplication in animals would appear to be
novel and certainly of sufficient interest to warrant publication. It might be the seed of a larger transduplication
