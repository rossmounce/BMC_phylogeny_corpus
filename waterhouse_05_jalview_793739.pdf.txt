Jalview is a Java application for editing and viewing
sequence alignments, originally developed by Michele
Clamp in 1997. It has facilities for assessing alignment
quality, visualizing residue property conservation, and
constructing and viewing sequence clusters through tree
and principle components based algorithms. After eight
years, it now has over 15,000 hits on Google, indicating
wide usage as both a stand alone application, and applet
based viewer for alignments derived from SRS, PFAM, and
Interpro.

molecular structure developed by the EBI's Macomolecular Structure Database group, and TOPAli – a tool for phylogenetic and recombination analysis which is developed
at the Scottish Crop Research Institute. More information
can be found at http://www.jalview.org.

Jalview is now being redesigned to take advantage of the
many new analysis and alignment tools available, and circumvent the technical obstacles presented by complex
sequence analysis tasks. Improvements have been made
to the user interface and display for handling many alignments with large number of sequences, and generate fully
annotated diagrams for publication.
Jalview is also able to access web based alignment, secondary structure prediction and sequence database services provided by the the European Bioinformatics
Institute (EBI), and the University of Dundee. Web services employed by Jalview are being developed as part of
the Visualization and Analysis of Molecular Sequences,
Alignments, and Structures (VAMSAS) project, funded by
the BBSRC.
VAMSAS is an open framework that facilitates the interoperation of advanced tools for phylogenetics, sequence
analysis, and structural bioinformatics, by providing a
common model for bioinformatic data exchange, web
service discovery and interaction. The other tools in this
project are AV@EBI – a version of the Astex Viewertm for
