Abstract
Background: While the genomic era is accumulating a tremendous amount of data, the question of how
genomics can describe a bacterial species remains to be fully addressed. The recent sequencing of the genome of
the Mycoplasma agalactiae type strain has challenged our general view on mycoplasmas by suggesting that these
simple bacteria are able to exchange significant amount of genetic material via horizontal gene transfer. Yet,
events that are shaping mycoplasma genomes and that are underlining diversity within this species have to be
fully evaluated. For this purpose, we compared two strains that are representative of the genetic spectrum
encountered in this species: the type strain PG2 which genome is already available and a field strain, 5632, which
was fully sequenced and annotated in this study.
Results: The two genomes differ by ca. 130 kbp with that of 5632 being the largest (1006 kbp). The make up of
this additional genetic material mainly corresponds (i) to mobile genetic elements and (ii) to expanded repertoire
of gene families that encode putative surface proteins and display features of highly-variable systems. More
specifically, three entire copies of a previously described integrative conjugative element are found in 5632 that
accounts for ca. 80 kbp. Other mobile genetic elements, found in 5632 but not in PG2, are the more classical
insertion sequences which are related to those found in two other ruminant pathogens, M. bovis and M. mycoides
subsp. mycoides SC. In 5632, repertoires of gene families encoding surface proteins are larger due to gene
duplication. Comparative proteomic analyses of the two strains indicate that the additional coding capacity of 5632
affects the overall architecture of the surface and suggests the occurrence of new phase variable systems based on
single nucleotide polymorphisms.
Conclusion: Overall, comparative analyses of two M. agalactiae strains revealed a very dynamic genome which
structure has been shaped by gene flow among ruminant mycoplasmas and expansion-reduction of gene
repertoires encoding surface proteins, the expression of which is driven by localized genetic micro-events.

Background
Over the last decade, it has become clear that a single
bacterial strain is not always representative of the whole
species. Moreover, the range of physiological and virulence properties of a given bacterial pathogen most
often relies on a particular subset of genes which are
responsible for strain-specific lifestyles and may not be
equally distributed within the species [1]. Comparative
genomics provide a powerful approach to understanding
what makes a pathogen but the question of how it can
describe a bacterial species is still debated [2]. Within a
single bacterial species, mathematical models are predicting the discovery of new genes even after sequencing
hundreds of different genomes [3].
The genus Mycoplasma includes the smallest selfreplicative bacterium, M. genitalium, which genome was
among the first sequenced [4]. It belongs to the class
Mollicutes which regressive evolution from Gram-positive ancestors has been marked by drastic genome
downsizing. As a result, contemporary mycoplasmas
have limited metabolic capacities and are among the
most evolved prokaryotes as they localised on some of
the longest branch of the phylogenetic tree of fully
sequenced organisms [5]. While our genomic era is
accumulating a tremendous amount of data with more
than 900 microbial genomes currently available in public
databases (Microbial Genome Resource, NCIB), only 15
other mycoplasma genomes have been completed [6-8],
including 3 strains of the M. hyopneumoniae species
[9,10]. This number is surprising low owing the small
size of mycoplasma genomes and the several species
that are relevant for public and animal health because
they are known as pathogenic for man or for a wide
range of animals [11].
Recently, genome sequencing of the M. agalactiae
type strain has shown that a significant portion of its
genome (ca. 18%) has undergone horizontal gene transfer (HGT) with members of the phylogenetically distant
“mycoides” cluster [12]. This cluster includes a number
of mycoplasma species which are, like M. agalactiae,
important ruminant pathogens and the nature of the
exchanged genes suggests that some may play a role in
mycoplasma-host interactions. While this first evidence
for large HGT in mycoplasmas is offering possible new
means for host-adaptation, it has changed our view on
the evolution of these minimal bacteria, which is not
only driven by gene loss but also by gene flow between
organisms sharing a same host [6]. Based on previous
studies on M. agalactiae genetic diversity, the species
appears to be fairly homogeneous with little intra-species genetic variation and most of the isolates resembling the type strain PG2 [13-15]. One of these studies
however pointed toward a subset of strains having

particular genetic features also found in M. bovis, a cattle pathogen closely related to the ovine-caprine M. agalactiae, but not in PG2 or in PG2-like strains [14]. One
of these particular strains, namely 5632, turned out to
harbour (i) a putative Integrative Conjugative Element,
ICE, of 27 kpb which occurrence is low in the M. agalactiae species but high in M. bovis [16], (ii) a different
repertoire of genes encoding surface lipoproteins known
as the Vpmas [17], and (iii) other genetic elements yet
to be characterized [14,18]. While the 5632 and PG2
strains have both been isolated from Spain, data accumulated so far tend to indicate that each stands at one
end of the genetic spectrum encountered in the M. agalactiae species.
Inter-strain whole genome comparison within a
Mycoplasma species has been carried once for an
important pathogen of swine, M. hyopneumoniae. This
study has provided evidence of intraspecific rearrangements resulting in strain-specific gene clusters as well
as clues to factors related to pathogenicity [10]. To
further comprehend the genome plasticity and the
mechanisms responsible in mycoplasmas for intra-species genetic diversity, the genome of M. agalactiae
strain 5632 was fully sequenced and compared in this
study with that of the PG2 type strain [12]. Although
M. agalactiae is an important pathogen of small ruminants [19,20], little is known regarding its virulence or
pathogenicity factors. Since all mycoplasmas lack a cell
wall, the surface of their membrane acts as the primary
interface in the interaction with the host and the
environment. For instance, a number of M. agalactiae
surface components has been shown to stimulate the
host humoral response and includes lipoproteins such
as the P80 [21], P40 [22], P48 [23], P30 [24] and the
Vpma family [25]. Except for P80, all displayed a certain degree of variability in expression either in clonal
population as for the phase-variable Vpmas [17,25,26]
or among strains as shown for the P30 which promoter is mutated in the P30-negative 5632 strain [24]. In
this study, high-throughput identification of proteins
expressed under laboratory conditions in M. agalactiae
strain PG2 and 5632 was performed by a shotgun
approach based on 1D SDS-PAGE protein fractionation followed by proteolyses and nanoLC-MS/MS.
These proteomic data sets were used to validate genome annotation and, by comparative analyses, to
further detect rare events that may be responsible for
surface diversification. The combination of comparative genomics with comparative proteomics revealed
that both large and localized events are shaping the M.
agalactiae population structure which one might be
much more dynamic than first expected from their
reduced genomes.

Results
Whole genome and proteome comparison

Whole genome sequencing of the M. agalactiae strain
5632 revealed that it is composed of 1,006.7 kbp and
thus, is ca.130 kpb larger than the genome of the PG2
type strain [12] (see Table 1 for general features). The
annotated genome of 5632 displays a total of 826 CDS
for only 752 in PG2 and whole proteome analyses of
both strains identified a global set of 507 as being
expressed under laboratory conditions in complex, axenic media (see additional file 1: Table S1). Of these
expressed CDS, 184 were detected in only one strain
(140 in 5632 and 44 in PG2) and 313 in both. Among
these, 139 were annotated as hypothetical, 41 were
related to hypothetical ABC transporter while most of
the remaining corresponded to house keeping genes.
These data indicate that ca. 60% of the M. agalactiae
predicted CDS products were confirmed by the global
proteomic approach. In a recent study by Demina et al.

[27], a same proportion of the M. gallisepticum annotated proteins was found to be expressed using similar
approaches. Whether the remaining annotated CDS of
M. agalactiae would be expressed or detected under different conditions is not known but it is unlikely that
they all correspond to false ORF. Comparison of the
two genomes using the MolliGen dot plot, the VISTA
and the ACT softwares revealed an almost perfect synteny with no major genome rearrangement but with a
number of regions being prominently different (Figure
1). These correspond to (i) mobile genetic elements, (ii)
restriction modification systems, and (iii) families of
gene encoding surface proteins. As described below,
these regions account for most of the difference in CDS
content observed in between PG2 and 5632.
Role of the mobilome in M. agalactiae genetic diversity
and genome plasticity

Analyses of the 5632 genome revealed the presence of
three large regions (ca. 27 kb) that correspond to an ICE
element previously identified in this strain [16]. The
three ICE copies were designated ICEA5632-I, -II and -III,
with ICE-I corresponding to that previously published,
and represented a total of about 80 kbp. In addition, two
smaller regions designated ICEA 5632 -IV and -V were
detected that relate to the degenerated, single ICE form
found in strain PG2 [12] and that appear to be ICEs vestiges as suggested by their reduced size and the presence
of insertion sequences and pseudogenes. Predicted proteins encoded by these vestiges were designated according to our previous nomenclature (Figure 2).
Interestingly, while phylogenetic and BLAST analyses
indicate that ICEA5632-I to-III are related to the ICEF of
Mycoplasma fermentans strain PG18 [28], the ICEA5632IV and -V vestiges and the degenerated ICEA PG2 are
somewhat similar to the ICEC of M. capricolum; in particular, they all contain a CDS with no predicted function,
CDSZ, that is not found in ICEA 5632 -I to -III nor in
ICEF. ICEA5632-IV also contains a CDS, CDS3, which is
present as a pseudogene in both the ICEAPG2 and ICEC
but is absent from the large copies ICEA5632-I to III. The
ICEA copies I to IV also contain two CDS widely conserved in mycoplasma ICEs, CDS22 and CDS5 (the copy
-V appear to have a degenerated version of CDS22).
ICEA left and right borders of the ICEA have been
experimentally defined as GGAA-[ICEA]-TTCC for
copy-I [16] and an identical inverted repeat also flanked
copies-II and -III. The high level of sequence conservation between the two M. agalactiae genomes allowed
defining the insertion points of the 3 large ICE copies in
the 5632 chromosome which correspond to intergenic
regions in PG2. Although ICE insertions do not result in
apparent gene disruption, the targeted regions seem to
be prone to instability: the copy -I is located next to a

conserved insertion sequence (IS) present as a pseudogene in both strains but showing some sequence divergence; the copy -III is also in the vicinity of an IS present
only in strain 5632 and which is inserted next to a conserved tRNA gene. The copy -II is inserted next to a predicted lipoprotein gene (MAG2840 or MAGa2970)
showing clear sequence divergence as the two predicted
proteins have only 66.4% identities. The three ICE copies
I-III are flanked by an almost perfect 9 bp direct repeat
which is most likely generated during the integration
process. Alignment of ICEA-I, -II and -III DNA
sequences from the first G of the GGAA repeat to the
last C of the TTCC repeat showed that there are highly
similar, presenting only 7 to 8 SNPs. This suggests that
the copies originated from subsequent excision and integration events, possibly during chromosomal replication
or by exchange within the population. SNPs resulted in
generating (i) two pseudogenes corresponding to CDS16
of copy II and CDS27 of copy III, (ii) truncation of
CDS22 in copy II and (iii) insertion of an Asn codon in a
stretch of repeated AAT (poly Asn) in CDS14 of copy I.
Overall, 5632 ICEAs account for 21 different CDS that
are not present in PG2, with the products of two detected
by MS/MS in the Triton-X114 fraction of 5632 (CDS14
and 17).
Other mobile elements were found in the 5632 genome
but not in PG2 and correspond to multiple copies of two
IS elements that both belong to the IS30 family. The
location of these elements relative to their flanking CDS
is shown in Figure 3. The IS element, ISMag1, has previously been described in some M. agalactiae strains [29]
and an isoform was also described in M. bovis (named
ISMbov1) [30]. In 5632, this element occurs in 12 copies
with 10 that localized either next to genomic islands
encoding a repertoire of variable surface lipoproteins (see
MAGa5890, MAGa5800 and MAGa8230) or to regions
associated with HGT (see circles 1 and 2 in Figure 1C).
The second type of IS, ISMag2, resembles ISMbov6
recently described [31] and is found only in three copies,
none of which seems to truncate or disrupt a CDS.
In silico analyses further indicate that ISMag1 occurrence most likely disrupts gene expression in only three
cases. In the first case, the insertion has taken place in
between a dcm gene encoding a Cytosine-specific DNAmethyltransferase Sau96I (MAGa3950) and a Type II
specific
deoxyribonuclease
sau96I-like
gene
(MAGa3970). Both genes are absent from PG2 but are
found next to each other in M. mycoides subsp.
mycoides SC in which they most likely occur as an
operon. These genes are highly similar to those found in
5632 with ca. 85% and 78% similarity, respectively, with
higher divergence in the N-terminal of 5632 sau96I-like
gene. Interestingly, a global proteomic approach (see
below and additional file 1: Table S1) detected several

Page 5 of 19

specific peptides of the cytosine-specific methyl transferase encoded by MAGa3950 but none corresponding to
the sau96I-like gene supporting the hypothesis that the
IS occurrence at its 5’end may affect its expression. In
the second case, IS insertion at the 3’ end of MAGa4040
would result in truncating the product by more than
50% when compared to the situation found in PG2. The
third case relates to MAGa5320 and MAGa5350 which
are separated by an IS and which have been annotated
as two distinct pseudogenes because they are highly
similar to either the N- or the C-terminal part of the
Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum glycosyl
transferase (MCAP0063). In PG2, homologs to
MAGa5320 and MAGa5350 also exist as pseudogenes
although no IS is involved.
Finally, two vestiges of transposase having similarities
with that of ISMmy1 of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC
were detected in the 5632 genome; one located next to
an ICE element while the other was found next to a
truncated hypothetical protein that displays a DUF285
motif (see below) and that is predicted to have undergone HGT with member of the “mycoides” cluster
species.
In most cases, IS elements were flanked by direct
repeated sequences of 14 nt for ISMag1 and of 25 nt
for ISMag2 that indicated a single IS insertion event.
Exceptions were found for IS elements (MAGa5800
and MAGa5890) located next to the vpma gene family
as previously described [17] and was also observed
here for the IS insertion located at the 3’ end of
MAGa4040 suggesting that further genomic rearrangements have occurred in this area. Indeed, this region
has been described above as a putative vestige of ICE
integration. Finally, a single transposase gene which
product was detected by proteomic analyses
(MAG3410; see also Figure 4) is found in PG2 but not
in 5632. This transposase has some similarities (46.7%)
with an ISMmy1 transposase of M. mycoides subsp.
mycoides SC, but no flanking repeated sequence could
be readily identified.
These data indicate that ca. 76% of the additional
genomic material of 5632 is composed of mobile genetic
elements when compared to PG2. This represents 10%
of the genome, yet these do not lead to major genome
rearrangement. Overall, 5632 has 95 additional CDS, 72
of which correspond to CDS of ICE or transposase.
Among the remaining, 8 relate to the spma family (see
below), 11 to hypothetical products (including 4
detected by LC-MS/MS) and 4 to restriction modification systems (RM) (Table 2).

become a standard protocol in our laboratory, attempts

5632 (A) and in PG2 type strain (B). Large arrows represent CDSs, with homologous CDSs labelled with the same color. CDS nomenclature
indicated below arrows is based on the first ICE study in 5632 [16]. ICEA5632-I, -II, -III, -IV, -V extend from MAGa7100 to 6880, MAGa2980 to 3220,
MAGa4850 to 5060, MAGa4050 to 4010, MAGa3690 to 3670, respectively. ICEAPG2 extend from MAG4060 to 3860. Red crosses indicate SNPs or

to transform 5632 in the same or modified conditions
repeatedly failed. As well, 5632 chromosomal DNA is
resistant to two type II restriction enzymes, Alw 1
(GGATCNNNN↓N) and Dpn II (↓GATC), that are sensitive to Dam methylation and restrict DNA extracted
from PG2. Conversely, 5632 DNA is digested by Dpn I
(GA↓TC) which cleaves only when the adenine of its
recognition site is methylated (data not shown). This
suggests that the two strains contain a different set of
restriction-modification (RM) systems and, indeed, 5632
contains four additional CDS that encode two type II
RM systems, each composed of a putative restriction
enzyme and its corresponding methylase. The first one
is similar to the Bacillus sp. Bsp61I RM system while
the other resembles that of the Sau96I-like found in M.

mycoides subps. mycoides SC as mentioned above.
Indeed, phylogenetic tree reconstructions, although not
fully demonstrative, suggested that the Bsp61I RM system has most likely been acquired by HGT from Firmicutes other than Mollicutes while the Sau96I-like system
has probably been exchanged with members of the
“mycoides” cluster. Further detailed comparative analyses revealed that 5632 is better equipped than PG2 in
terms of RM systems and more specifically in DNA
methylases. As indicated in Table 2, 5632 encodes for
11 putative DNA methylases of which 9 are expressed
under laboratory conditions while for PG2 this number
is only 8 with the expression of 3 being detected. Interestingly, one methylase gene seems to have been duplicated in 5632 (MAGa1570 and MAGa1580) when

other and from their PG2 ortholog mostly in their central part (ca. aa205-aa400) which is known to contain
the N6_N4_Mtase domain (PF01555 in Pfam). Whether
this provides the corresponding enzymes with different
specificity is not known. Both strains display a locus of
six genes (MAGa6280 to MAGa6350, MAG5640 to
MAG5730) with homology to type I RM systems that
were designated hsd and are composed of (i) two hsdM
genes coding for two almost identical modification

enzymes which would methylate specific adenine residues, (ii) three hsdS genes each coding for a distinct RM
specificity subunit (HsdS) that shares homologies with
each other (between 50 to 97% similarities) and (iii) one
hsdR gene encoding a site-specific endonuclease (HsdR).
Interestingly, in PG2, the hsdR gene is disrupted by the
insertion of two nucleotides in a polyA tract localised in
the middle of the gene that results in a premature stop
codon. This is in agreement with the detection in 5632
but not in PG2 of peptides specific of the HsdR enzyme.

In mycoplasma, such polyA tracts have often been
involved in high-frequency variation in expression [33].
Finally, the hsd locus also contains a hypothetical CDS
whose product is highly similar to a phage family integrase of Bifidobacterium longum [34] and motifs found
in molecules involved in DNA recombination and integration. In M. pulmonis, the hsd locus has been shown
to undergo frequent DNA rearrangements but the gene
encoding the putative recombinase is located elsewhere

in the genome [35,36]. If the hsd locus of M. agalactiae
is functional then it is worth noting that its hsdS
sequences diverge between the two strains suggesting
that recombinase-mediated DNA rearrangements could
modulate the specificity of the system. Attempts to
demonstrate DNA rearrangements of the hsd using
basic molecular approaches failed. Whether this is due
to the difficulties in finding specific sequence signatures
that would demonstrate recombination is not known.

The flexible gene pool: towards a highly dynamic surface
architecture

Comparison of the two M. agalactiae genomes
further revealed that strains 5632 and PG2 contain
103 and 67 CDS predicted to encode lipoproteins,
respectively. Proteomic analyses further confirmed the
expression of more than 50% of these CDS for both
strains, with at least 56 being expressed in 5632 and
43 in PG2, all but one (MAGa5190) being detected in
Triton X-114 (see Table 3 for a detailed list). In most
cases, these differences are linked to genes present in
one strain but not in the other (i.e. genes belonging
to 5632-ICE and encoding lipoproteins such as
CDS14) and to a previously well-characterised gene
family, the vpma. This family encodes related, phasevariable, lipoproteins [25] and account for 23 CDS in
5632 but only 6 in PG2. As previously reported, all
vpma genes except two (vpmaK and vpmaL) were
shown to be expressed at one point during in vitro
propagation of 5632 [17].
Hypothetical related surface lipoproteins are encoded
by two other gene families: the so-called drp (for
DUF285 related proteins) and the spma (surface protein
of M. agalactiae). Unlike the vpma, CDS encoding products with DUF285 motifs are scattered on the chromosome, with both strains having a similar size-repertoire
composed of 12 CDS identified as Drp (and one pseudogene) in PG2 and 13 in 5632. One particularity of this
family is that it belongs to the gene pool that underwent
HGT with members of the “mycoides” cluster. Comparison of 5632 with PG2 revealed that they often localized
in regions that vary the most between the two strains
(Figure 4). Except for one (MAGa2580 to MAGa2630),
all 5632 drp loci present a different organization when
compared to PG2 that reflects the occurrence of complex DNA rearrangements (i.e. locus MAGa3630 to
MAGa3780), of additional IS elements or CDS in 5632
(i.e. locus MAGa7410 to MAGa7490), and/or of pseudogenes in PG2 (i.e. MAG4200 and 4210). Interestingly,
only two Drp proteins were detected by proteomic LCMS/MS. One was expressed in both strains (MAG2430
and MAGa2600) and is encoded at the same locus (Figure 4) while the other corresponded to MAG4220 in
PG2 or to MAGa7470 in 5632 that are located at two
different loci. Interestingly, the homolog MAGa7470
occurs as a pseudogene in PG2 because of a difference
in the length of polyA tract that creates by frameshifting
a premature stop codon. Concerning MAG4220 and its
counterpart in 5632, MAGa4450, there is no apparent
molecular feature that could account for their difference
in expression. These two products differ slightly from
the rest of the family in that they both lack the sequence
needed for prolipoprotein recognition and lipid

Page 10 of 19

modification, known as the lipobox and usually located
at the C-terminal of their signal peptide.
Comparison of the 5632 and PG2 genomes revealed
one particular locus composed of several putative CDS
encoding (i) a similar N-terminal signal peptide followed
by a highly conserved lipobox and (ii) particular aminoacid motifs that are repeated within a particular product.
This gene family was further designated as spma for
“surface protein of M. agalactiae“ and is larger in 5632
with 8 spma genes and only 4 in PG2. Analyses of the
two spma loci indicate that spma genes present in 5632
but not in PG2 have orthologs in the “mycoides” cluster
only. More specifically, M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC
strain GM12 [37,38] and M. capricolum subsp. capricolum contain 5 and 1 genes, respectively, that encode
putative lipoproteins resembling 5632-Spmas and carrying the motif 3. Although this question cannot be formally addressed by phylogenetic tree reconstruction, the
spma sequence comparison suggests that these genes
are part of the gene pool which has been exchanged
between M. agalactiae and members of the “mycoides”
cluster. The proteomic approach taken in this study
failed to detect any of the Spma products in one or the
other M. agalactiae strains. Whether these proteins
have been missed by this approach or whether they are
not expressed or expressed under different conditions
remains to be assessed. A stretch of polyG was found at
the 5’ untranslated region of each putative spma gene
(Figure 5). This last feature is unusual in mycoplasmas
that have a low G+C content and is particularly striking
in the 5632 spma locus which displays 8 polyG tracts
with one containing up to 13 G residues. Whether these
control or affect the transcription of downstream genes
is not known but homopolymeric tracts of residues have
often been associated with products whose expression is
phase variable in mycoplasmas.
Interestingly, polyG tracts were found elsewhere in the
genome of 5632, again at the 5’ end of gene encoding
putative surface protein. For instance, the conserved
hypothetical P48-like product encoded by MAGa1620
displays a high similarity with the P48 lipoprotein and is
detected by MS/MS in the triton detergent phase
although its gene does not contain a proper signal peptide followed by a lipobox. Careful examination of the 5’
end of the P48-like coding sequence revealed a stretch
of 10 Gs and a ribosomal frameshift at this position
where the deletion of one G would generate an in-frame
signal peptide followed by a lipobox (Figure 6). These
data suggested that a mechanism based on polyG (or C)
being prone to ribosomal shifting or to mutation could
also account in several cases for the difference between
the two strains in lipoproteins detected in Triton-X114
by proteomic analyses (see Table 3).

Discussion
Whole genome sequencing of M. agalactiae strain 5632
revealed that it contains an additional 95 genes representing an extra-130 kbps when compared to the PG2
type strain. For organisms that have a small genome size
such as mycoplasmas, this is a rather significant feature.
The additional material is mostly composed of repeated
elements, so that our knowledge of the M. agalactiae
pan-genome has been enriched by 39 new genes. A
large portion of those, more specifically 23, is present in
ICEs or corresponds to IS. Recent mathematical models
by Tettelin et al. [39] show that the pan-genome of the
mollicute Ureaplasma urealyticum is limited, based on
the draft sequences of nine strains. This implies that the
sequencing of additional strains might not significantly
increase our knowledge of this species unless it is targeting a specific biological question [40]. Although U. urealyticum is a human pathogen and has a genome slightly
smaller (ca. 750 kbp), the same observation may apply
to the M. agalactiae species as indicated by the low
number of new genes discovered in our study. Thus,
sequencing additional M. agalactiae strains might bring
little more information on the global coding capacity of
this organism.
Overall, data obtained here and elsewhere indicate
that about 10% of the 5632 genome is highly dynamic
in that large regions corresponding to ICE can excise
[16] and, theoretically, relocate elsewhere or be transferred to a recipient cell during conjugation, if such
event is further shown to occur in this species. The two

ICE’s vestiges, ICE IV and V, represent scars of past
ICE insertions followed by a progressive decay. Interestingly, these more resemble the larger ICE vestige of
PG2 or the ICE of M. capricolum subsp. capricolum
than the three entire ICE copies of 5632 suggesting that
this strain may have, at one point, hosted two types of
ICEs. These data indicate that the circulation of ICEs in
some strains might not be such a rare event. The presence of ICE circular forms in 5632 [16] together with
the low number of SNPs detected between the three
copies indicate that multiple ICE insertions are recent.
The mechanisms underlying ICE insertion, excision and
putative transfer in mycoplasmas have yet to be investigated, but recent studies on ICE elements in Grampositive bacteria suggest that these events can be under
the control of sophisticated regulation systems in
response to changing environmental conditions such as
stress or population density [41]. The finding of ICE in
M. agalactiae and members of the “mycoides” cluster
together with evidence of HGT in between these species
further raised the prospect that these simple bacteria
could conjugate. So far, a single report has supported
the occurrence of conjugation in mycoplasmas by showing the exchange of genetic material in between M. pulmonis cells via a mechanism resistant to DNAse [42].
The idea that this phenomenon might be more common among mycoplasmas than first expected is very
exciting because, if occurring, it would change the way
we see the evolution of these so called “minimal
organisms”.

Figure 5 The M. agalactiae 5632 strain contains an extended spma repertoire. Schematics representing the genomic organization of the
spma loci in strains PG2 and 5632 (A) and the structural features of the corresponding spma gene products in both strains (B). In panel A, CDS
corresponding to spma genes are filled in green. The S letter represents sequence corresponding to a signal peptide. Other CDSs conserved
between PG2 and 5632 are filled by light yellow. Tracks of repeated nucleotides (Gn, where n is the number of residues) found before spma
coding sequences are also indicated above the line. In panel B, predicted Spma proteins are represented schematically by large arrows
beginning generally with a homologous amino-acid leader sequence (black boxes labelled S) followed by regions that have homology between
spma gene products or that are repeated within the same product (blue dotted and grey boxes).

Although smaller in size than ICE, IS elements as a
whole represent a dynamic potential for the genome
because of their copy number. In other bacteria, their
contribution to genome plasticity and dynamics is well
known [43]. Here, no major DNA inversion or rearrangement was detected between the two M. agalactiae
genomes that could be associated to IS except for two
cases. As previously shown by our group, the first one
refers to the duplication in 5632 of the single vpma
cluster of PG2 that has been most likely driven by IS
elements and that resulted in 5632 having extended possibilities for surface diversification when compared to
PG2 [17]. The second case refers to a region which
organization significantly differs in between PG2 and
5632 (see Figure 4d) and which contains several IS
related elements (i.e. IS, transposases or pseudogenes of
transposase). Events underlying rearrangements in this

region cannot be exactly retraced but most likely they
are ancient and have resulted in duplication of the ptsG
gene in PG2 (MAG3250 and MAG3320). Interestingly,
this region, like many others associated with IS, contains
several genes or pseudogenes that have undergone HGT
suggesting that IS may directly contribute to this phenomenon as suggested for other bacteria [43]. Finally,
we showed that IS insertions may have an impact on
gene expression, thus modifying some of the strain
properties such as those associated with restrictionmodification in 5632.
Compared to the PG2 type strain, 5632 seems better
equipped for DNA exchange. Besides harbouring an
impressive “mobilome”, some of which may be tailored
for conjugative transfer, it contains a number of operating RM systems. On one hand, these may act as a barrier to DNA invasion [44] and explain why 5632 DNA

Figure 6 Analysis of the p48-like sequence of M. agalactiae 5632 suggests a mechanism for phase variation. Schematic represents the
p48-like genomic region (A). CDSs are represented by large arrows with MAGa1620 corresponding to p48-like gene filled in blue. Translation of
the DNA region flanking the polyG track is given in the three frames (B). The polyG tract suspected to vary in length (G10 +/-1) is underlined by
a bold red bar. The putative beginning of a P48-like lipoprotein with an entire signal peptide sequence is shaded in red while the current
annotated MAGa1620 open reading frame is in blue. Global amino-acid alignment results obtained with Needle (program available at http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/align/) between the P48-like of M. agalactiae 5632 and the P68 lipoprotein of M. bovis PG45 for which a similar
polyG tract was previously described [48], are of 89.3% (identity) and 92.1% (similarity).

is resistant to several methylase-sensitive restriction
enzymes and to DNA transformation (data not shown).
On the other hand, while methylated DNA is protected
against degradation, it might be more likely accepted by
a recipient cell displaying similar RM systems, regardless
of the DNA transfer or uptake mechanisms. Indeed,
some of the 5632 specific RM systems not present in
PG2 have homologs in members of the “mycoides” cluster (Table 2). Whether the structure of the M. agalactiae population is made of a majority of PG2-like strains
that are deficient in mobile elements as well as in RM
systems with only some strains such as 5632 being more
prone to gene exchange with selected partners, is not
yet known. Finally, DNA methylases, whether they
belong or not to RM systems, could play a number of
functions related to fitness or virulence, including the
regulation of various physiological processes such as
chromosome replication, mismatch repair, transposition,
and transcription as described in other bacteria [45].
They may also be involved in the epigenetic switch of
some key factors such as in the Pap of the uropathogenic E. coli [46].
Interestingly, a fairly good portion of the flexible gene
pool of M. agalactiae is dedicated to producing surface
proteins, many of which are lipoproteins. Based on in
silico analysis, 5632 contains ca. 100 lipoproteins with at

least 56 expressed under laboratory conditions. These
include the Vpma family composed of 16 different lipoproteins that are encoded by 23 genes in 5632 and 6 in
PG2 and that are phase variable in expression and probably in size [17]. Phase variation of surface molecules is
a common mechanism in mycoplasma species [33] and
is probably a major adaptive strategy for these minimal
pathogens. Vpma phase variants are produced at high
frequencies and in a reversible manner by site-specific
recombination [26,47] but comparative proteogenomics
conducted here suggest that other variable systems may
co-exist. For instance, expression of the P48-like protein
as a lipoprotein that is soluble in Triton-X114 may
depend on a riboshifting mechanism or on reversible
hypermutation in a polyG tract localised at the 5’ coding
sequence (Figure 6). Indeed, data obtained by Lynyansky
et al. [48] showed that translation of a full length P68
lipoprotein in M. bovis is associated with the length of a
similar polyG tract. The length of this homopolymer
varies from 8 to 10 residues when comparing four M.
bovis strains, with nine G allowing translation of a complete P68. Indeed, expression of the two homologs, the
M. agalactiae P48-like and the M. bovis P68, is most
likely phase variable in the two ruminant pathogens.
Several other polyG tracts, some containing up to 13
residues, were found in the study that are associated

Nouvel et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:86
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/86

with the 5’ end of genes encoding surface lipoproteins
suggesting that this may be a common slippage mechanism in M. agalactiae. Finally, the drp family involves
genes that circulate by HGT between M. agalactiae and
members of the “mycoides” cluster. Based on comparative proteogenomics, 5632 and PG2 have a same size
repertoire each composed of a different set with only 2
out of 12 or 13 drp products being expressed, one common to the two strains and one specific. Whether this
reflects a mechanism of phase variation is unlikely, but
silent drp genes may act as a sequence reservoir for the
emergence of new Drp expression patterns. Taken
together these results suggest that the two M. agalactiae
strains might display very different surface architectures
with highly dynamic compositions during clonal
propagation.
The strain 5632 was initially chosen because of its
particular genetic features, several of which were found
in its close relative M. bovis. This was further confirmed
in this study which shows that 5632, unlike PG2, possesses (i) mobile elements such ICE and IS in multiple
copies, (ii) a P48-like gene that is expressed, and (iii)
two genes related to phage immunity that are also present in M. bovis PG45 [17]. The ovine/caprine pathogen
M. agalactiae and the cattle pathogen M. bovis were
first classified as the same species and our findings indicate that a continuum of strains might exist in between
these two species. The genome sequence of M. bovis has
been achieved (Craig Venter Institute, unpublished data
and [31]) and its analysis may unravel even more common traits as well as some specificities that may explain
their respective host-specificity.

genes present only in limited number of genomes across
bacteria. For minimal genomes, this mobile gene set
may provide a vehicle for the accessory as well as for
the character genes to disseminate throughout population. Moreover, large mobile elements such as ICE may
expand the genomic space, facilitating the emergence of
new genes. This dynamic genome scheme may be crucial for mycoplasmas to counterbalance their reductive
evolution so far marked by genome downsizing.
Ultra-high throughput genome sequencing is becoming more and more accessible so that wide and affordable studies will soon expand our knowledge of the
mycoplasma pan-genome. Because several mycoplasma
species are of importance for the medical and veterinary
fields as well as excellent models for studying the minimal cell concept, this research area will undoubtly have
a beneficial impact for both applied and theoretical
mycoplasmology as well as for general microbiology.

Methods
Bacterial strains, culture conditions and DNA isolation

M. agalactiae type strain PG2, clone 55.5 [47] and strain
5632, clonal variant C1 [18] used in this study have been
previously described. These strains have been independently isolated from goat in Spain. Experiments reported
in this manuscript have all been performed with these
clonal variants but for simplicity, we will further refer to
them as PG2 and 5632. Mycoplasmas were propagated
in complex Aluotto [50] or SP4 liquid medium [51] at
37°C and genomic DNA was extracted as described elsewhere [52,53].
M. agalactiae strain 5632 sequencing and annotation

Conclusions
Multiple genome sequencing of closely related bacterial
species can address various significant issues which
range from a better understanding of forces driving
microbial evolution to the design of novel vaccines.
Recent pan-genome studies using genome [3] or gene
centred [49] approaches, strongly suggest that microbial
genomes are continuously sampling and/or shuffling
their genetic information rather than undergoing slow,
progressive changes. By introducing the means for variability in the population, this dynamic process increases
the chances for rapid adaptation and survival to changing environments.
Mycoplasma species have limited coding capacity yet
our comparative study shows that two strains of the
same species may display significant differences in the
size of their mobile gene set, which one is marginal in
the type strain but may represent up to 13% of a field
strain. As observed for E. coli, these genes that relate to
IS, phages or plasmids, are often associated with an
accessory gene pool, usually represented by ORFans or

Whole genome sequencing of strain 5632 was performed
as follows. A library of 3 kb inserts (A) was generated by
mechanical shearing of the DNA followed by cloning of
fragments into the pcDNA2.1 (Invitrogen) E. coli vector.
Two libraries of 25 kb (B) and 80 kb (C) inserts also were
generated by Hin dIII partial digestion and cloning of the
resulting DNA fragments into the pBeloBAC11 (CALTECH) modified E. coli vector. The plasmid inserts of
10752, 3072 and 768 clones picked from the A, B and C
libraries respectively were end-sequenced by dye-terminator chemistry on ABI3730 sequencer. The PHRED/
PHRAP/CONSED software package was used for
sequence assemblies. Gap closure and quality assessment
were made according to the Bermuda rules with 10307
additional sequences. Annotation was performed as previously described using the CAAT-Box platform [54]
with an automatic pre-annotation for CDS having a high
similarity to PG2 followed by expert validation. Criteria
used for the automatic pre-annotation step were: CDS
considered as Probable IF %similarity >= 60 OR (IF %
similary >= 35 AND START at identical position);

Nouvel et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:86
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/86

Putative IF NOT Probable AND IF %similarity >= 35.
Annotation fields were transposed IF (status = Probable
OR Putative). The BLAST program suite was used for
homology searches in non-redundant databases http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi. In order to determine the extent of sequence similarity, alignments
between sequences were performed using the Needle
(Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm) or the
Water (Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm)
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/align/ software.
Lipoproteins were detected as previously described
[12] based on the presence (i) of the PROSITE Prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site motif
(PROKAR_LIPOPROTEIN, Acc. Numb. PS00013)
[DERK](6)-[LIVMFWSTAG](2)-[LIVMFYSTAGCQ][AGS]-C and/or (ii) of two motifs previously defined by
MEME-MAST that correspond to a charged N-terminal
followed by a specific lipobox. After manual confirmation, a total of 105 CDSs were annotated as predicted
lipoproteins.
The tRNA genes were located on the chromosome
using the tRNAscan-SE software [55]; the rRNA genes
and the rnpB gene from the RNAseP system were
searched using BLASTN by homology with M. agalactiae strain PG2 [12]; the tmRNA involved in translational surveillance and ribosome rescue was predicted
using the ARAGORN software http://130.235.46.10/
ARAGORN/[56].
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA
4.0 [57] and the Neighbor-Joining tree method. The
reliability of the tree nodes was tested by performing
500 bootstrap replicates.

overnight at -70°C after addition of 9 volumes of cold
MeOH and centrifugated 10 min at 12,000 × g and
resuspended in loading buffer. The gel was sliced into
about 15 sections which were subjected to trypsin digestion. Peptides were further analyzed by nano liquid
chromatography coupled to a MS/MS ion-trap mass
spectrometer (LC-MS/MS).
Peptides were identified with SEQUEST through the
Bioworks 3.3.1 interface (Thermo-Finnigan, Torrence,
CA, USA) against a database consisting of both direct
and reverse sense Mycoplasma agalactiae strain PG2 or
5632 entries. Using the following criteria (DeltaCN ≥
0.1, Xcorr vs Charge State ≥ 1.5 (+1), 2.0 (+2), 2.5 (+3),
Peptide Probability ≤ 0.001 and Number of Different
Peptides ≥ 2) as validation filters, the False Positive rate
is null. Additional file 1: Table S1 summarizes the CDS
which at least two specific peptides were detected in at
least one of the fractions.
Database submission and web-accessible database

The genome sequence from M. agalactiae strain 5632,
as well as related features were submitted to the EMBL/
GenBank/DDBJ databases under accession number
FP671138. All data were also loaded into the MolliGen
database http://cbi.labri.fr/outils/molligen/[58].

Comparative genome analysis

Comparative genomic analyses involving Mollicutes genomes were performed using a combination of tools
available in the MolliGen public database [58] after
incorporating the 5632 genome into a private section.
Other bioinformatics softwares were used that include
(i) Artemis [59], (ii) Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)
[60], (iii) mVISTA [61].
Proteomic analyses

After propagation of the two M. agalactiae strains
respectively grown in the complex Aluotto media at 37°
C, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed
three times in PBS before being re-suspended in this
buffer. One aliquot was used for defining the total protein content (PG2) while the remaining was subjected to
protein partitioning using Triton-Tx114 as previously
described [62]. Partitioning resulted in three fractions
corresponding to hydrophobic (suspended in TritonTX114), hydrophilic and insoluble proteins that were
further subjected to 1D SDS-PAGE as such except for
