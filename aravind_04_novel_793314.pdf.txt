Conclusions: We predict that KAP family NTPases function principally in the NTP-dependent dynamics
of protein complexes, especially those associated with the intracellular surface of cell membranes. Animal
KAP NTPases, including Kidins220/ARMS, are likely to function as NTP-dependent regulators of the
assembly of membrane-associated signaling complexes involved in neurite growth and development. One
possible function of the prokaryotic KAP NTPases might be in the exclusion of selfish replicons, such as
viruses, from the host cells. Phylogenetic analysis and phyletic patterns suggest that the common ancestor
of the animals acquired a KAP NTPase via lateral transfer from bacteria. However, an earlier transfer into
eukaryotes followed by multiple losses in several eukaryotic lineages cannot be ruled out.

Results: Using sequence profile searches and homology-based structure prediction, we have identified a
previously uncharacterized family of P-loop NTPases, which includes the neuronal membrane protein and
receptor tyrosine kinase substrate Kidins220/ARMS, which is conserved in animals, the F-plasmid PifA
protein involved in phage T7 exclusion, and several uncharacterized bacterial proteins. We refer to these
(predicted) NTPases as the KAP family, after Kidins220/ARMS and PifA. The KAP family NTPases are
sporadically distributed across a wide phylogenetic range in bacteria but among the eukaryotes are
represented only in animals. Many of the prokaryotic KAP NTPases are encoded in plasmids and tend to
undergo disruption to form pseudogenes. A unique feature of all eukaryotic and certain bacterial KAP
NTPases is the presence of two or four transmembrane helices inserted into the P-loop NTPase domain.
These transmembrane helices anchor KAP NTPases in the membrane such that the P-loop domain is
located on the intracellular side. We show that the KAP family belongs to the same major division of the
P-loop NTPase fold with the AAA+, ABC, RecA-like, VirD4-like, PilT-like, and AP/NACHT-like NTPase
classes. In addition to the KAP family, we identified another small family of predicted bacterial NTPases,
with two transmembrane helices inserted into the P-loop domain. This family is not specifically related to
the KAP NTPases, suggesting independent acquisition of the transmembrane helices.

Background

The P-loop NTPase domains constitute one of the largest
apparently monophyletic groups of globular protein domains
in the proteomes of most cellular organisms [1,2]. These
domains are implicated in nearly all biochemical and
mechanical processes in the cell, including translation, transcription, replication and repair, intracellular trafficking,
membrane transport, and activation of various metabolites
[1,3]. At the sequence level, most of the P-loop domains are
characterized by two conserved motifs, termed the Walker A
and B motifs [4]. Structurally, P-loop domains adopt a globular fold with at least 5 α/β units (the P-loop NTPase fold), with
the strands typically forming a core parallel sheet [5,6]. The
Walker A motif (typically, Gx4GK[T/S], where x is any residue) encompasses the first strand and helix, and is involved
in binding the triphosphate moiety of the substrate NTP. The
Walker B motif (typically, hhhhD, where h is a hydrophobic
residue) encompasses the third universally conserved strand
in the P-loop NTPase fold and coordinates a Mg2+ ion which
directs an attack on the bond between the β and γ phosphates
of the NTP [1,3,4].
A series of recent comparative studies on the sequences and
structures of P-loop NTPases defined the probable major evolutionary events in the diversification of these domains [612]. In particular, these studies delineated two major divisions of P-loop NTPases, the KG (kinase-GTPase) division
and the ASCE division (for additional strand, catalytic E). The
KG division includes kinases and GTPases that share many
structural similarities, such as the adjacent placement of the
P-loop and Walker B strands [9,10]. The ASCE division is
characterized by an additional strand in the core sheet, which
is located between the P-loop strand and the Walker B strand
(Figure 1) [10]. As opposed to kinases and GTPases, ATP
hydrolysis by the ASCE proteins typically depends on a conserved catalytic (proton-abstracting) acidic residue (usually
glutamate) that primes a water molecule for the nucleophilic
attack on the γ-phosphate group of ATP ([10] and references
therein). As a consequence, ASCE division proteins typically
are more active NTPases than those of the KG division and do
not require accessory factors, such as GTPase-activating and

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/5/R30

GDP-exchange proteins [9]. In addition, most of the ASCE
division NTPases possess a conserved polar residue at the
carboxy terminus of strand 4, which is inserted between the
strands associated with the Walker A and B motifs [10]. The
ASCE division includes AAA+, ABC, PilT, superfamily 1/2
(SF1/2) helicases, and RecA/F1/F0 classes of ATPases, and a
large assemblage of NTPases related to the AP(apoptotic) and
NACHT families [6-8,11,13,14].
Recognition of these distinctive sequence and structural features allows classification of uncharacterized P-loop NTPase
families into one of the principal divisions and facilitates predictions of their potential catalytic capacity. Systematic analysis of the P-loop NTPases further demonstrated that most of
the conserved families of the ASCE division ATPases could be
confidently placed within one of the six large classes mentioned above [11]. However, several families of ASCE NTPases
remained outside this classification scheme. Here, we apply
sequence and structural analysis to characterize one such previously unexplored family, which includes animal proteins
participating in neural development and receptor tyrosine
kinase signaling, and prokaryotic plasmid-encoded proteins
that confer resistance to bacteriophages. We investigate the
evolutionary implications of their unusual phyletic distribution and their unique structural feature, namely the insertion
of multiple transmembrane helices into the P-loop NTPase
fold. We also present predictions regarding their potential
biochemical roles in eukaryotes and bacteria.

Results and discussion
Identification and classification of the KAP family of
predicted ATPases
During our systematic analysis of the P-loop NTPase fold, we
detected the mammalian neuronal membrane protein named
kinase D-interacting substance of 220 kDa (Kidins220) or
ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning protein (ARMS)
[15,16] in various searches initiated with position-specific
scoring matrices (PSSMs) for different ASCE division
ATPases, such as the AAA+ class. The alignments produced in
these searches indicated that the ARMS protein contained the

characteristic sequence signatures of the Walker A and B
motifs. However, examination of these alignments also
showed that ARMS contained one or more long inserts (>100
amino acid residues) within the potential P-loop NTPase
domain.
To further investigate the structure and evolutionary connections of this protein, we performed PSI-BLAST searches
(expectation value of 0.01 for inclusion of sequences into the
PSSM, with the statistical correction for compositional bias)
using as the query the sequence of the putative P-loop NTPase
domain of ARMS (GenBank identifier gi: 14133247, residues
433-959). The first iteration of this search retrieved apparent
orthologs of ARMS from other animals, such as Danio, Drosophila, Anopheles and Caenorhabditis, and a homolog from
the cyanobacterium Anabaena. The subsequent iterations
also detected, with significant E-values (e < 10-5) apparent
divergent homologs from bacteria spanning a broad phyletic
range (Figure 1). A possible pseudogene belonging to this
family was also detected in the genomes of the archaea Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanosarcina (see below). The
prokaryotic proteins detected in these searches included the
PifA protein, which is encoded in the enterobacterial F plasmid and is required for exclusion of bacteriophage T7 [17,18].
All these proteins contain the typical Walker A and B signatures, suggesting that they are functional P-loop NTPases. In
contrast to the animal ARMS orthologs, most of the bacterial
proteins, except for those from Anabaena species, Geobacter
sulfurreducens and Microbulbifer degradans, lacked the
large inserts within the P-loop NTPase domain. Reciprocal
PSI-BLAST searches initiated with these bacterial proteins as
queries first retrieved a consistent set of proteins that
included the animal ARMS orthologs before the retrieval of
other ASCE NTPases, such as the AP/NACHT-NTPases,
AAA+ and ABC classes. These observations suggested that
ARMS homologs define a novel group of P-loop NTPases that
is distinct from all the previously described classes of P-loop
domains. Hereinafter, we refer to them as the KAP family of
(predicted) NTPases (after Kidins220/ARMS and PifA). In
addition, the above searches retrieved a vertebrate paralog of
the ARMS protein (for example, Rattus norvegicus protein
LOC308414), in which Walker A and B motifs are disrupted
(Figure 1), indicating that, unlike other ARMS homologs, it
might lack NTPase activity.
To further explore the functional features and evolutionary
relationships of the KAP family, we constructed a multiple
alignment of the KAP proteins and compared its sequence
conservation pattern and predicted secondary structure with
those of other P-loop NTPases (Figure 1). The Walker B motif
in the KAP family sequences typically has the form hhhhD[D/
G]hD (where h is any hydrophobic residue). The second
aspartate (D) immediately after the Walker B aspartate (first
aspartate) is present in most of the bacterial KAP domains but
is replaced by a glycine or an alanine in the animal sequences
(Figure 1). An acidic residue in this position is an ancestral

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/5/R30

feature of the ASCE division of ATPases, and the presence of
an aspartate is specifically characteristic of the AP/NACHTNTPases as opposed to the glutamate, which is most common
in the SFI/II helicase and AAA+ ATPases [7,13,14,19,20].
Furthermore, the third aspartate located three positions
downstream of the Walker B aspartate is a shared feature of
the KAP and NACHT families [13]. In the KAP family proteins, one of these aspartates might function as the protonabstracting negative charge in NTP hydrolysis. The KAP family proteins contain another conserved polar residue (typically, D) at the end of strand 4 (Figure 1). This feature is also
characteristic of the ASCE NTPases and corresponds to the
sensor I motif of the AAA+ domains and its counterparts in
other proteins of the ASCE division [7,11,14]. These conserved
features, together with the consistent detection of various
ASCE NTPases in database searches with the profiles of KAP
family PSSM, strongly suggest that this family belongs to the
ASCE division.
The conserved core of the P-loop NTPase domain of the KAP
family contains an α-helix amino-terminal of the Walker A
strand and an α-helical extension with three to four predicted
helical segments occurring carboxy-terminal of strand 5 (Figures 1, 2). Similar structural features are also seen in the
AAA+ ATPases and the NACHT/AP-NTPases, suggesting that
the KAP family might form a higher-order group with these
classes of NTPase domains within the ASCE division [11,13].
However, the specific extended sequence signatures associated with the Walker B motif, strand 5 of the core P-loop
NTPase domain, and the carboxy-terminal helical module
(Figure 1) clearly distinguish KAP ATPases from all other
ASCE NTPases. Although most proteins of the KAP family
have a conserved lysine at the beginning of strand 5, this residue does not appear to be equivalent to the arginine finger,
which is found in ring-forming ASCE NTPases, such as the
AAA+ and VirD4-like ATPases [6,7,11,14]. This suggests that
KAP ATPases do not have an arginine finger and are unlikely
to function as oligomeric rings. However, the KAP family proteins contain a conserved arginine in the carboxy-terminal
helical segment, which could potentially function similarly to
the sensor-2 arginine of the AAA+ ATPases (Figure 1). Examination of the multiple alignment suggests that, in addition to
the five conserved strands of the core P-loop domain, the KAP
family NTPase domain contains an additional strand after the
core strand 2 (Figure 1). By analogy with the RecA and VirD4/
PilT classes, this additional extended segment might stack
externally on the β-sheet alongside strand 2 (Figure 2) [6,8].
Most of the NTPases of the KAP family have a variable α-helical insert amino-terminal to the Walker B motif. Remarkably, all animal KAP NTPases and three bacterial ones, those
from Anabaena, G. sulfurreducens and Microbulbifer, contain two membrane-spanning helices inserted in this region
(Figures 1, 2). The animal proteins additionally contain two
more transmembrane helices inserted in the region between
helix 1 (associated with the Walker A motif) and strand 2 of

The bacterial KAP proteins without the transmembrane
regions contain a variable helical insert (Figure 1), which
could function as a site for interactions with other proteins.
The prokaryotic KAP family members have not been characterized biochemically, but potential leads to their functions
are suggested by the available data on the PifA protein, which
is encoded in enterobacterial F plasmids and is required for
exclusion of bacteriophage T7 from plasmid-containing cells
[17,18]. The exclusion process involves interactions between
PifA and the products of T7 genes 1.2 and 10, which code for
the major phage capsid proteins, and is accompanied by an
increase in membrane permeability [17,25]. These observations imply that PifA might reorganize certain membraneassociated complexes in an ATP-dependent manner and
thereby disrupt the T7 life cycle. While it is not clear whether
the principal function of PifA is in bacteriophage exclusion,

the core NTPase domain. Insertion of membrane-spanning
helices into globular domains is extremely rare in proteins
[21], and, to our knowledge, the KAP family is the first such
instance among P-loop NTPase domains. In the NTPase
domains that do not form ring structures, most residues
involved in NTP-binding and hydrolysis are located at the
carboxy termini of the strands forming the core parallel βsheet (Figures 1, 2). This causes a polarity in the structure of
the NTPase domain with respect to the location of catalytic
surface, thus allowing it to accrete inserts in regions that are
spatially disjointed from this catalytic surface. This might
explain the ability of the KAP NTPase domain to retain its
structural and functional integrity despite the insertion of
transmembrane helices. Superposition of the multiple alignment of the KAP family onto known structures of the P-loop
NTPase domains suggests that the membrane-spanning
inserts project outward from the conserved intracellular globular core, probably from the surface opposite to the NTPbinding surface (Figure 2).

In mammals, Kidins220/ARMS localizes to the tips of neurites and is abundantly expressed in the neural tissues in
regions that are enriched in receptors for ephrins and ligands
of the neurotrophin family. Furthermore, Kidins220/ARMS
physically interacts with TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptors and is phosphorylated upon activation of the neutrophin
and ephrin receptors [15,16]. Kidins220/ARMS also appears
to be a physiological substrate for protein kinase D, suggesting that it might be a key target for multiple neuronal signaling cascades [15,16]. Kidins220/ARMS and all its animal
orthologs contain 10 or more amino-terminal ankyrin repeats
[22], while the Anabaena homolog with transmembrane segments contains approximately 40 TPR repeats amino-terminal to the P-loop NTPase domain [23]. Similarly, the
membrane-associated KAP proteins from Microbulbifer and
G. sulfurreducens contain a large amino-terminal segment
with predicted coiled-coil structure. Phosphorylation of
Kidins220/ARMS by various kinases suggests that this protein might function as a signaling nexus associated with the
cell membrane. The α-superhelical structure domains
present in animal (and some bacterial) KAP NTPases, such as
ankyrin and TPR repeats, could provide extended surfaces to
mediate interactions with various protein complexes. The
likely function for the KAP NTPase domain is the regulation
of assembly/disassembly of these complexes in an NTPdependent manner. In particular, Kidins220/ARMS and the
orthologous KAP NTPases in other animals might regulate
the assembly of neurite-membrane-associated signaling complexes that are positioned downstream of different receptor
tyrosine kinases in the respective signaling pathways. Consistent with this proposal, the high-throughput screens for
protein-protein interactions in Drosophila recovered the
PDZ-domain protein Dlg, which binds the carboxy-terminal
tails of neural membrane proteins, as an interacting partner
for the Kidins220/ARMS ortholog [24]. The vertebrate paralogs of Kidins220/ARMS with apparently inactive NTPase
domains lack the ankyrin repeats and might function as dominant-negative regulators of active KAP NTPases.

some other lines of circumstantial evidence support this
possibility.
The sporadic distribution of the KAP family in prokaryotes
and its presence on plasmids (and a filamentous phage in
Vibrio) in various species (Figure 3) suggests that it was
widely disseminated by these laterally mobile replicons. Protection of bacterial cells from phages could be one of the functions of KAP NTPases in prokaryotes, a role that is conducive
to rapid horizontal spread, by analogy with the dissemination
of antibiotic-resistance determinants. In at least six prokaryotes, including both occurrences in archaea, the genes for
KAP NTPases were disrupted by frameshifts. Although some
sequencing errors cannot be ruled out, it seems extremely
unlikely that such errors occurred independently in

homologous genes in several species. Furthermore, on several
occasions, species or strains closely related to those that harbor a frameshift in the KAP gene have an intact counterpart,
suggesting multiple recent pseudogene formation events in
the KAP family. Inactivation of KAP NTPases might be driven
by phages acquiring resistance to the KAP-mediated pathways, thereby rendering KAP genes superfluous. Coexpression of PifA with plasmids encoding genes 1.2 and 10 of T7
resulted in lethality in Escherichia coli [26]. Such deleterious
effects of KAP NTPases under certain circumstances, such as
expression of high levels of certain phage proteins, could be
an alternative selective pressure for their inactivation.
In prokaryotic genomes, genes coding for functionally interacting proteins often co-occur in conserved operons or form

NTPase evolved on a bacterial plasmid and had a role in the
modification of the bacterial membrane that results in exclusion of bacteriophages from the plasmid-carrying bacteria.
Subsequently, the KAP NTPase in one of the bacterial lineages acquired the pair of transmembrane helices inserted into
the P-loop domain, which made it an integral membrane protein. The apparent preponderance of horizontal gene transfer
in the evolution of the KAP family and the phylogenetic affinities of the animal KAP NTPases suggest that the gene for a
membrane-spanning KAP NTPase was laterally transferred
to eukaryotes before the divergence of the major animal lineages, probably from a bacterial plasmid or chromosome. As
no eukaryotes other than animals are currently known to
have a KAP NTPase, it seems likely that this gene transfer
occurred relatively late in evolution - that is, after the separation of the lineage leading to the animals from other crowngroup eukaryotes. However, given the sparse sampling of
large eukaryotic genomes from different crown-group lineages, the possibility remains that the transfer occurred earlier, but KAP genes have been lost in the currently sampled
taxa.

We describe here a previously unnoticed family of P-loop
NTPases that displays unusual structural features and
phyletic patterns. The P-loop NTPase domain of this family,
designated the KAP family, belongs to the ASCE division of

Conclusions

interactions

In search of other possible instances of insertion of transmembrane segments into P-loop NTPase domains we analyzed all uncharacterized NTPase domains detected in our
searches using the TMHMM program for transmembrane
helix prediction. As a result, we identified another small family of predicted NTPases containing transmembrane helices
inserted into the P-loop domain. This family is present in several bacteria and includes the yobI gene of Bacillus subtilis
and its orthologs from Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron and Streptococcus mutans (Figure 4). All
these proteins contain a pair of predicted transmembrane
helices inserted after the second conserved strand-helix unit
of the NTPase core. The location of this insert thus differs
from that seen in the ARMS subfamily of the KAP family,
where the transmembrane helices are inserted immediately
after the Walker A associated strand-helix unit (Figures 1, 4).
The P-loop domain of these proteins shows the hallmarks of
the ASCE division but no specific affinity with the KAP family,
suggesting an independent origin of the inserts. In addition,
these proteins contain a large conserved carboxy-terminal
extension that is predicted to adopt an α-superhelical structure. The presence of these predicted NTPases in a taxonomically disjointed set of bacteria suggest a horizontal mode of
dissemination similar to that discussed above for the KAP
family.

refereed research

Thus, on more than one occasion, the phylogenetic tree of the
KAP family brings together phylogenetically distant bacteria
(for example, Deinococcus, Agrobacterium and E. coli) in
well-supported clades, strongly suggesting a major role of
plasmid-mediated horizontal transfer in the evolution of this
family (Figure 3). The most striking feature of the tree is the
nesting of the animal ARMS homologs within a clade containing bacterial members. Among the currently available members of the KAP family, the greatest diversity is seen in
bacteria, and almost all subfamilies contain multiple plasmid-borne members. It seems likely that the original KAP

Phylogenetic trees of the conserved NTPase domain of the
KAP family were constructed using the maximum likelihood,
neighbor-joining, and minimum evolution methods (see
Materials and methods for details). The trees constructed
with each of these methods had similar topologies and suggested existence of several subfamilies within the KAP family.
One of these, the ARMS subfamily, includes all animal KAP
proteins and three bacterial members, those from M.
degradans, G. sulfurreducens and Anabaena (Figure 3). In
this case, phylogenetic analysis strongly supported monophyly of this group, which was independently suggested by
their shared derived character, the insertion of transmembrane helices into the P-loop domain. A second subfamily
consists of proteins from phylogenetically diverse bacteria,
such as E. coli (strain cft073), D. radiodurans plasmid CP1, A.
tumefaciens plasmid AT, Ralstonia and Magnetococcus, and
is also supported by an apparent shared derived character, a
carboxy-terminal globular domain that is unique to this subfamily. This bacterial subfamily groups with the ARMS subfamily, to the exclusion of homologs from all other
prokaryotes (Figure 3). The third major subfamily includes
the F-plasmid-borne PifA and its homologs from plasmids
and chromosomes of Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Nostoc, Thermotoga, Clostridium and Leuconostoc.
The validity of this family is supported by the presence of a
unique carboxy-terminal domain that shows no obvious relationships with any previously conserved globular domains.

gene fusions to give rise to a single gene. Consequently, evolutionarily conserved juxtaposition of functionally uncharacterized genes with genes whose functions are known has the
potential to throw light on the functions of the former [2729]. In the case of KAP NTPases, a conserved gene neighborhood was detected in E. coli (strain cft073), Deinococcus
radiodurans plasmid CP1, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens
plasmid AT, in which the gene for the KAP NTPase is located
next to genes encoding a TIM barrel DNase of the TatD family
[30] and an ATP pyrophosphohydrolase of the PP-loop fold
[31]. Although the exact functional implications of this linkage are unclear, it seems likely that these enzymes cooperate
with the KAP NTPases in the inhibition of phage reproduction; the DNase, in particular, is a candidate for a role in degradation of phage DNA.

P-loop NTPases and might be distantly related to the AAA+
and AP/NACHT NTPases [10,11,13]. All eukaryotic and several bacterial members of the KAP family contain two or four
transmembrane segments inserted into the P-loop NTPase
domain and, accordingly, are predicted to be integral membrane proteins, with the P-loop domain attached to the intracellular side of the membrane. In addition, we identified
another small family of predicted bacterial NTPases, which
do not seem to be specifically related to the KAP family, but
also contain two transmembrane helices inserted into the Ploop domain. Insertion of transmembrane helices into globular domains is generally rare and, to our knowledge, has not
been described in P-loop NTPases so far. It is well known,
however, that the P-loop domain tolerates extremely long
inserts of hydrophilic domains, such as the coiled-coil
domains in the SMC family ATPases involved in chromatin
dynamics and repair [32,33]. Furthermore, many P-loop
NTPases are involved in membrane transport and secretion.
In particular, these are the principal functions of the ABCclass ATPases, and some of these, such as the CFTR protein in
animals, contain multiple transmembrane helices, which,
however, are located outside the P-loop domain [34]. The discovery of two families of predicted P-loop NTPases with
transmembrane helices inserted into the P-loop domain itself
unifies these two structural themes and further expands our
notion of the enormous structural and functional plasticity of
this widespread domain.
Among eukaryotes, the KAP family is so far represented only
in animals and is typified by the neuronal membrane protein
Kidins220/ARMS and its paralog, which seems to have a

catalytically inactive NTPase domain. In prokaryotes, KAP
NTPases are often encoded by plasmids and might function in
exclusion of bacteriophages from the plasmid-bearing bacterial cells. We predict that both eukaryotic and bacterial KAP
NTPases regulate NTP-dependent assembly or disassembly
of membrane-associated protein complexes. Phyletic pattern
and phylogenetic analysis suggest that lateral transfer from
bacteria to the animal lineage (or an earlier ancestral form)
before the diversification of the latter gave rise to the ancestor
of the eukaryotic KAP NTPases. However, given the evidence
of rampant gene loss in diverse eukaryotes [35,36], it is conceivable that the KAP NTPases were acquired early in eukaryotic evolution and subsequently lost in several non-animal
lineages. Regardless of the exact origin scenario, these
NTPases provide a remarkable example of recruitment of a
protein originally acquired from bacteria for animal-specific
functions, such as receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling in neural growth and development.

Materials and methods

The non-redundant (NR) database of protein sequences
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH,
Bethesda) was searched using BLASTP [37]. Iterative database searches were conducted using PSI-BLAST with either a
single sequence or an alignment used as the query, with the
PSSM inclusion expectation (E) value threshold of 0.01
(unless specified otherwise); the searches were iterated until
convergence [37]. For all searches with compositionally
biased proteins, the statistical correction for this bias was
used [38,39]. Multiple alignments were constructed using the

reports

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the maximumlikelihood, neighbor-joining, and minimum evolution (least
squares) methods. Maximum-likelihood distance matrices
were constructed with the TreePuzzle 5 program using 1,000
replicates generated from the input alignment and used as the
input for construction of neighbor-joining trees with the
Weighbor program [50,51]. Weighbor uses a weighted neighbor-joining tree construction procedure that has been shown
to correct effectively for long-branch effects [51]. The minimal
evolution trees were constructed using the FITCH program of
the Phylip package, [52] followed by local rearrangement
using the Protml program of the Molphy package [53] to produce the maximum likelihood (ML) tree. The statistical significance of the internal nodes of the ML tree was assessed
using the relative estimate of logarithmic likelihood bootstrap
(Protml RELL-BP), with 10,000 replicates [53]. A full ML tree
was constructed using the Proml program of the Phylip package [52]. This tree was used as the input tree to generate further full ML trees using the PhyML program with 100
bootstrap replicates generated from the input alignment [54].
The consensus of these trees was derived using the Consense
program of the Phylip package to obtain the bootstrapped ML
tree [52]. A gamma distribution with one invariant and eight
variable sites with different rates was used in the ML analysis.
Gene neighborhoods were determined by searching the NCBI
PTT tables with a custom-written script. These tables can be
accessed from the genomes division of the Entrez retrieval
system.
