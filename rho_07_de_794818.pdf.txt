Abstract
Background: LTR retrotransposons are a class of mobile genetic elements containing two similar
long terminal repeats (LTRs). Currently, LTR retrotransposons are annotated in eukaryotic
genomes mainly through the conventional homology searching approach. Hence, it is limited to
annotating known elements.
Results: In this paper, we report a de novo computational method that can identify new LTR
retrotransposons without relying on a library of known elements. Specifically, our method
identifies intact LTR retrotransposons by using an approximate string matching technique and
protein domain analysis. In addition, it identifies partially deleted or solo LTRs using profile Hidden
Markov Models (pHMMs). As a result, this method can de novo identify all types of LTR
retrotransposons. We tested this method on the two pairs of eukaryotic genomes, C. elegans vs.
C. briggsae and D. melanogaster vs. D. pseudoobscura. LTR retrotransposons in C. elegans and D.
melanogaster have been intensively studied using conventional annotation methods. Comparing
with previous work, we identified new intact LTR retroelements and new putative families, which
may imply that there may still be new retroelements that are left to be discovered even in wellstudied organisms. To assess the sensitivity and accuracy of our method, we compared our results
with a previously published method, LTR_STRUC, which predominantly identifies full-length LTR
retrotransposons. In summary, both methods identified comparable number of intact LTR
retroelements. But our method can identify nearly all known elements in C. elegans, while
LTR_STRUCT missed about 1/3 of them. Our method also identified more known LTR
retroelements than LTR_STRUCT in the D. melanogaster genome. We also identified some LTR
retroelements in the other two genomes, C. briggsae and D. pseudoobscura, which have not been
completely finished. In contrast, the conventional method failed to identify those elements. Finally,
the phylogenetic and chromosomal distributions of the identified elements are discussed.
Conclusion: We report a novel method for de novo identification of LTR retrotransposons in
eukaryotic genomes with favorable performance over the existing methods.

Background
Mobile genetic elements (MGEs, also called transposable
elements, TEs), which can transpose from one location to
another within the genome, are known to be one of the
causes of large scale genome reorganization [1]. According
to the mechanism of their transposition, MGEs are usually
classified into two broad categories: retroelements (or class
I elements), which are transposed through the reverse
transcription of an RNA template (retrotransposition), and
DNA transposons (or class II elements), which are transposed through a classical DNA "cut-and-paste" transposition model. MGEs have attracted the attention of
evolutionary biologists in studying their interactions with
the host species [2], especially in the post-genome era
when more and more eukaryotic genomes are sequenced.
The conventional approach to annotating MGEs in
genomic sequences is based upon homology searching
against a well-updated library of known MGEs, e.g. Repbase [3], using a fast searching program, e.g. RepeatMasker [4]. This approach, however, is limited to annotating
those known MGE families, and thus cannot identify new
elements. Furthermore, it sometimes even overlooks
known elements, because the repetitive nature of MGE
elements may confuse the statistical methods (e.g. E-values) that are commonly used in genome annotation [5].
In a pioneer paper, Bao and Eddy described a de novo
approach to automated annotation of repeat elements in
a genome [6]. Their program RECON clustered BLAST hits
from self-comparison of a single genome and reported the
repeat elements that appear many times in similar copies
in the genome. Since then, several software tools have
been developed with improved speed and performance
over RECON, e.g. RepeatScout [7], PILER [8], and a combined method [9]. All these methods described above,
however, attempted to identify repeat elements based on
their copy numbers in a genome, thus facilitating identification of general repeat elements. Many MGEs indeed
appear high copies in the host genome because of their
transposition activity. But some MGE families have low
copy numbers in some genomes. Furthermore, there exist
other types of repeat elements than MGEs. For example,
many low copy repeats (LCRs) in mammalian genomes
are induced by segmental duplications [10]. Although
these LCRs follow a completely different duplication
mechanism from MGEs, there is often no clear distinction
in copy numbers between these two classes of repeats. As
a result, successful identification of new MGEs by these
bioinformatics approaches requires subsequent manual
inspection and experimental validation [11]. Recently, a
new computational method was proposed that identified
genome-specifically inserted sequences using multiple
alignment of closely related genomes [12]. This new
method does not rely on the copy number of the repeat

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/90

elements to identify them, but does not attempt to distinguish different classes of repeats either.
In this paper, we adopt a different de novo approach to
identifying mobile genetic elements, which is based on
common structural models of specific MGE families,
rather than their copy numbers in a genome. As an initial
step of this approach, we concentrate on one class of
mobile genetic elements, LTR-retrotransposons, which
share a unique structural feature, two long terminal
repeats (LTRs) that are longer than 100 bp and play a key
role in their transposition. LTR retrotransposons and
endogenous retroviruses have partially overlapping gene
organizations, and thus are thought to have the same origin. Since two LTRs of a single LTR retrotransposon have
identical sequences at the time of integration, dating the
transposition event of a LTR retrotransposon can be
achieved reliably by computing the sequence similarity of
its two LTRs [13]. Therefore, LTR retrotransposons
become an ideal subject for phylogenetic analysis. Computational screening of LTR retrotransposons has been
done extensively in several eukaryotic genomes, e.g. C. elegans [14], D. melanogaster [15,16], mouse [17] and rice
[18]. Software tools, such as LTR_STRUC [19], and a
newly developed one [20] were developed to speed up the
screening process. However, they were based on sequence
characteristics derived from known LTR retroelements.
Because of the high divergence of LTR retrotransposons
[21], there are likely new elements still to be identified,
even in these well-studied model organisms.
We propose here a de novo computational method for LTR
retrotransposon identification that consists of three steps.
In the first step, we identify only young and intact LTR retrotransposons, i.e. those elements associated with pairs of
LTRs with high identity (e.g. > 80%). This problem can be
formulated as finding two highly similar subsequences
with a distance ranging typically from 1000 to 20000
bases in a given genomic sequence. We used an approximate string matching technique, based on the suffix array
data structure, to solve this problem. In addition, the
structure of retroelements is inspected by the occurrences
of common protein domains. In the second step, we identify solo LTRs, i.e. the unpaired LTRs resulting from
recombination between LTR retrotransposons, by first
applying the BAG sequence clustering algorithm [22] to
cluster LTRs identified in the previous step, and then
searching against the whole genome using sequence profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) built from these
LTR sequence clusters. Finally, we identify old and intact
LTR retrotransposons with LTR pairs of low identities (e.g.
< 80%) by a phylogenetic analysis of identified LTR elements.

We implemented our method in a software package using
C++ and perl, and tested it on two eukaryotic genomes, C.
elegans and D. melanogaster. We chose these genomes for
initial testing because they have been well studied so that
we can compare our results with the previous known ones
and those identified by LTR_STRUC [19]. It turns out that
our de novo method identified almost all of the previously
known elements, whereas LTR_STRUC missed about 1/3
of them, although both methods report comparable
number of retroelements. This indicates our method has a
higher sensitivity over the existing method. In addition to
known elements, our method identified some new intact
LTR retrotransposons and several putative new families of
LTR retrotransposons. These are particularly encouraging
results, for these two genomes have been well studied. In
order to obtain a larger evolutionary picture of their transpositions, we also analyzed two additional genomes, C.
briggsae and D. pseudoobscura, each closely related to one
of the two model genomes. From the phylogenetic analysis of the identified elements, we find clear evidence that
some LTR retrotransposon families are specific to single
species within a genus, whereas some others are active
across both genomes. We also analyzed the distribution of
chromosomal locations of identified LTR retrotransposons. Consistent with previous reports, we observed
that there were more LTR retrotransposons existing in heterochromatic regions than in euchromatic regions, implying that active mobile genetic elements might contribute
significantly to the formation of heterochromatin.

Results and discussion
Identification of intact and solo LTR retroelements
Following the algorithms described in the Methods section, we implemented a program package for de novo LTR
retrotransposon identification. We then applied our program to identify LTR retrotransposons in four genomes.
Totals of 58, 33, 686, and 65 intact LTR retrotransposons
were found in the C. elegans, C. briggsae, D. melanogaster,
and D. pseudoobscura genomes, which were classified into
37, 19, 113, and 41 clusters, respectively (Table 1). We
note that these clusters represent putative families of retroelements. Below we discuss the details of our findings in
each of these four genomes.

Comparison with existing methods
We first compared the results of our method with
LTR_STRUC [19], a widely applied program for LTR retroelements. Figure 1(a) shows Venn diagram of the known
intact LTR retroelements [14], and the intact retroelements identified by LTR_STRUC and our method in the C.
elegans genome, respectively. The results show that both
our method and LTR_STRUC report comparable number
of retroelements (58 for our method and 68 for
LTR_STRUC). Our method identified almost all (23/24)
known intact LTR retroelements, whereas LTR_STRUC
identified only 14 of them. The only missed known element, which is also missed by LTR_STRUC, is reported as
two solo LTRs by our method. There are 6 common new
elements identified by both methods. In contrast, each
method identified a considerable number of new elements that are not identified by the other one (29 for our
method and 48 for LTR_STRUC), indicating that these
two methods may be complementary in identifying new
LTR retroelements. Similar results are obtained when
comparing both methods on the D. melanogaster genome.
We constructed a reference set of putative intact retroelements in euchromatic regions based on the latest annotation in Flybase [9]. Since the intact and fragment elements
are not distinguished in the annotation, we consider only
639 ones that are longer than 1000 bp as putative intact
elements. Using only intact LTR retrotransposons in comparison, our method identified 418 elements in the reference set, whereas LTR_STRUCT identified 331
retroelements, and 320 of them are in the reference set
(Figure 1(b)). When comparison was made using both
intact and solo LTR retrotransposons, our method identified 569 elements in the reference set. These results show
that our method has higher sensitivity than LTR_STRUC.
The missed elements by our method may not contain any
LTR.
LTR retrotransposons in the C. elegans genome
A total of 45 pairs of young intact LTRs were found in the
C. elegans genome after step 1 (see Methods for details).
The pairs of LTR sequences were then grouped into 37
clusters. A profile HMM was built for each cluster and subsequently searched against the whole genome and 323

solo LTRs were found at this step. Next we applied the
phylogenetic approach to identify old intact LTR retrotransposons. 26 (out of 323) solo LTRs were paired at this
step, which added 13 old intact LTR retrotransposons to
the final result. In summary, we identified 58 intact LTR
retrotransposons and 297 solo LTRs. The sequence identities between a pair of LTRs from intact retroelements were
above 89.0% with an average value of 98.5%. The locations of these elements identified in the latest release
(release 2) of the C. elegans genome sequence can be
found in our complementary website. Previous studies
based on homology searching have identified 24 intact
LTR retrotransposons in 19 families from the C. elegans
genome [14]. These families were defined according to the
similarity of common protein domains such as reverse
transcriptase (RT) or envelope protein (ENV). We success-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/90

fully recovered 23 out of these 24 known intact LTR retrotransposons, and 17 out of 19 these known families (see
Table 2). We note that our method is a de novo method
that does not rely on a library of known elements. Therefore, the recovery of known retroelements is encouraging,
indicating our method has a satisfactory false negative
rate. Some of the previously known families correspond
to one cluster in our findings, whereas in the other cases,
two families are merged into a single cluster (i.e. Cer8/
Cer9 and Cer12/Cer16). This shows that our automatic
sequence clustering algorithm can define families of LTR
retroelements similarly to the previous phylogenetic analyses. Nevertheless, through the rest of the paper, we still
call the groups of LTR retroelements identified by our
method clusters instead of families, implying that additional verification is required before some of them can be
determined new LTR retrotransposon families. The only
intact LTR retroelement that we missed is known to be an
intact LTR retroelement of the family Cer20 (denoted as
the cluster LTR_CE15 in our results) that does not have
either common protein domains or long ORFs inside the
element, which remains a hard case for any automatic
identification method. Our program reported this pair of
LTRs as two solo LTRs in cluster LTR_CE15, again because
their sequences are not the most similar in the phylogenetic tree (see details on our complementary website).
Two retrotransposon families that we missed (Cer11 and
Cer14) do not contain intact elements (called solo-only
families). We stress that as any other de nov method, our
method focuses on the identification of intact elements
and can identify solo elements only if there are intact elements from the same family present in the genome. Soloonly families, however, may be discovered through a
homology-based method using LTR sequences identified
from intact elements in other genomes (e.g., family
Cer20).
Table 2 summarizes all clusters, including 22 new clusters,
identified in this work. We note that these findings need
to be validated by additional inspection. In addition to
the new clusters, we also identified several new elements
in some previously classified families [14]. For example,
in our results, cluster LTR_CE8 is a mixture of two previously identified families (Cer8 and Cer 9). Previous study
identified, in total, 5 retroelements (2 and 3 respectively)
in these two families, whereas our method identified 8
retroelements. One of the three new retroelements in this
cluster (element 5) was identified in step 1 and the other
two (element 6 and element 8) were identified in step 3.
The similarities between the new elements and previously
known elements in this cluster were significant, e.g.
45.6% (element 1 vs. 5), 44.3% (element 1 vs. 6) and
53.0% (element 2 vs. 8). We stress that all these new elements are not identified by LTR_STRUC in our test, indicating these missed elements are probably not caused by

different versions of the C. elegans genome used in this
study than in the previous one.
LTR retrotransposons in the C. briggsae vs. C. elegans genomes
A total of 24 pairs of intact LTRs were found in the C.
briggsae genome after step 1. The LTRs were clustered into
19 clusters, from which pHMM searching identified 277
solo LTRs. Using phylogenetic analyses in step 3, two
additional intact LTRs were redefined from 4 (out of 277)
solo LTRs. Hence, in total, our method identified 26 intact
elements and 273 solo LTRs (see Additional file 1). We
emphasize that we identified more elements than the conventional method in the C. briggsae genome. The UCSC
genome browser[23] has annotated the MGEs for the C.
briggsae genome based on RepeatMasker searching against
updated Repbase. There are only 9 fragmentary sequences
from the previously known LTR retrotransposon family

(Cer1). However, all of them are shorter than the halflength of the known intact elements in this family. This
result is also consistent with a similar cross-species analysis that we performed. When we used RepeatMasker to
annotate retroelements in C. briggsae based on a library of
LTR elements in C. elegans, we got 74 hits, but most of
them were short partial matching and no significant hit
was found. This suggests that the conventional homology
searching methods may fail to identify new LTR retroelements, even when a library of LTR retroelements from a
closely related organism is used. In contrast, our method
has identified many more elements, including several
putative new families, again demonstrating the advantages of our de novo method. Among these new elements,
the largest cluster (LTR_CB16) contains five intact elements, in which the average identity between LTRs in the
elements is above 98%. Three other clusters contain two

intact elements and the remaining clusters contain only
one intact element. The predicted RT domains in retroelements from the C. briggsae genome were aligned with
those from the C. elegans genome in order to verify these
identified elements (Figure 2). Based on the groups by
phylogenetic analysis (described below), seven RT
domains from clusters LTR_CB8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and
19 in the C. briggsae genome were aligned along with RT
domains from the known elements, LTR_CE1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 6, in the C. elegans genome (Figure 2(a)). RT domain

briggsae genome were aligned along with the known elements, LTR_CE7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, in the C. elegans genome, which also belong to the same group in the
phylogenetic tree (see Figure 2(b)). The aligned RT
sequences from both genomes are well conserved, in particular in those OSM regions, implying that these elements identified by our methods are likely true LTR
retroelements.
The sequence-based LTR finding method, as described
previously [24] or used in step 1 in our program, may miss

some old retroelements, i.e. those elements containing
pairs of LTRs with lower identities. Our phylogenetic analysis (step 3) may overcome this disadvantage and identify
additional intact retroelements. For example, the intact
LTR retroelements (full-7) in cluster LTR_CE8 from C. elegans (see our companion website), which was also identified by an homology searching method in previous
studies [14], was missed by step 1 in our method. However, this intact LTR was identified in step 3 of our program by phylogenetic analysis, because in this case the
pair of LTRs was the closest neighbors on the phylogenetic
tree of the entire LTR family (Figure 3(a), highlighted in
gray box). Another example is an intact LTR retroelement
(full-2) in cluster LTR_CE15 in the C. elegans genome (see
our complementary website). In this cluster, one intact
element (full-1) was identified in step 1, whereas the
other one (full-2) was missed in step 1, but identified in
step 3 since its pair of LTRs were the closest in the phylogenetic tree of the entire LTR family (Figure 3(b), highlighted in grey box).
We note that the number of elements identified in the C.
briggsae genome is significantly less than in the C. elegans
genome, even though these two genomes have similar
genome size and gene content [25]. We hypothesize that
this difference may be due to the fact that the C. briggsae
genome is not fully finished. We used the following simulation experiment to test this hypothesis. We randomly
shredded the sequence of the C. elegans genome into the
same number (577) of scaffolds with identical lengths to
those of the C. briggsae genome. We repeated this procedure 100 times and each time we determined how many
identified intact elements in the C elegans genome were
broken. We found that on average 31 (out of 58) intact
elements were retained (with standard deviation about 9),
which is comparable to the number of intact elements
identified in the C. briggsae genome (24). Hence, we concluded that the C. briggsae genome may not contain significantly fewer intact LTR retroelements than the C. elegans
genome, and that many elements may still be missing
from the current analysis because of the incompleteness
of its genomic sequence.
LTR retrotransposons in D. melanogaster genome
A total of 601 pairs of LTRs from young intact retroelements were identified in the D. melanogaster genome after
step 1. The pairs of LTR sequences were grouped into 113
clusters. Searching against the whole genome based on
the profile HMM of intact LTRs for each cluster, we identified 5595 solo LTRs. In step 3, the phylogenetic
approach was applied and identified 85 old intact LTR retroelements from 170 (out of 5595) solo LTRs. Hence, in
summary, we identified 686 (= 601+85) intact LTRs and
5425 (= 5595-170) solo LTRs. These LTR retroelements
were compared with previously identified families. A total

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/90

of 22 LTR retrotransposon families in common were
reported in four independent studies [15,26-29]. Among
113 clusters that we identified, 22 clusters are equivalent
to these 22 families. Table 3 summarizes these 22 clusters
together with some other clusters containing more than
four intact retroelements. The cluster LTR_DM17 contains
the largest number (98) of intact LTR elements. The average identity of LTR pairs from intact retroelements was
99.7%. The cluster LTR_DM2 (equivalent to the known
family 17.6 [15,26]), contains 16 intact LTR retroelements. The identities between 15 (out of 16) LTR pairs are
above 99% and the average is 99.5%.
LTR retrotransposons in the D. pseudoobscura vs. D.
melanogaster genomes
A total of 43 pairs of intact LTR retrotransposons were
identified after step 1 in the D. pseudoobscura genome. The
LTRs thus obtained were clustered into 41 clusters, from
which 983 solo LTRs were found. After phylogenetic analysis, 5 additional old intact LTR retroelements were identified from 10 (out of 983) solo LTRs. In summary, we
identified 48 (= 43+5) intact retrotransposons and 973 (=
983-10) solo LTRs (see Additional file 2). We identified
far fewer LTR retroelements in the D. pseudoobscura
genome than in the D. melanogaster genome. This is also
understandable since the D. pseudoobscura genome is not
as well finished as the D. melanogaster genome. In particular, almost no heterochromatic DNA has been sequenced
in this genome. In contrast, there is a well-progressed finishing effort for the D. melanogaster genome, particularly
in heterochromatic regions. As we show below, in the D.
melanogaster genome, a major fraction of the LTR retroelements were identified in heterochromatic regions. Nevertheless, we can still identify many putative LTR
retroelements in euchromatic regions of the D. pseudoobscura genome. For example, in cluster LTR_DP30, two
intact LTR retroelements were identified in step 1. The
identities between the pairs of LTRs are 96.3% and 98.0%,
respectively. The identity between these two elements is
62.6%.
Chromosomal distribution of LTR retroelements
The analysis of chromosomal distributions of the identified LTR retroelements was performed on the C. elegans
and D. melanogaster genomes. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test was used to determine whether the LTRs are distributed uniformly in terms of their chromosomal location.
With the significance level of 0.05, the hypothesis of a
uniform distribution was clearly rejected in chromosomes
I, II, V, and X of the C. elegans genome (see Additional file
3); whereas the significance level on chromosomes III and
IV were p = 0.4586 and p = 0.1420, respectively. These
results were consistent with the previous observations on
the same genome [14] and the DNA replication model for
the C. elegans genome [30].

The same test was performed for four chromosomes
(chromosome 2, 3, 4, and X) in the D. melanogaster
genome. The results showed that the hypothesis was
rejected in all four chromosomes. As shown in Figure 4,
LTRs are more densely distributed in the pericentromeric
regions of the chromosomes 2 and 3 (at the end of the
chromosome arms 2L and 3L and at the beginning of the
chromosome arms 2R and 3R) which are also considered
to be highly heterochromatic regions. The chromosome X
has more LTRs on one end. It was determined that 47%
and 39% of the LTRs (intact elements and solos) are

located in the proximal 6 Mb of the pericentromeric
regions of chromosomes 2 and 3, respectively. Similarly,
44% of the LTRs are located in the proximal 3 Mb of the
pericentromeric regions of chromosome X. In order to see
whether LTR retroelements are distributed uniformly in
euchromatic regions, the test was carried out with the
same hypothesis after excluding 6 Mb of the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 2 and 3. The result showed
that the hypothesis was still rejected in these two chromosomes, indicating that there might be regions for more
LTR retroelement insertions even in euchromatic regions.

Phylogenetic analysis of RT domains
We used the RT domains in LTR retroelements to analyze
the phylogenetic relationships of the LTR retroelements
from two close species, C. elegans and C. briggsae. The elements that were identified by our method can be divided
into two groups. One group has a known RT domain
whereas the other one has long ORFs (>700 bp) that may
represent novel RT domains. From the elements identified
in the first group of the C. elegans and the C. briggsae
genomes, the RT protein sequences were extracted. Their
neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstraps
was generated (Figure 5). The tree contains three major
groups, of which two groups contain known elements.
Group A in Figure 5 contains elements in clusters
LTR_CE1-6, which are compatible with Cer 1–7 in gypsy/
Ty1 group from the previous study [14] and the new elements in clusters LTR_CB8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 19 of
the C. briggsae genome. Group B in Figure 5 contains elements in clusters LTR_CE 7–14, which are compatible
with Cer 8–20 in Bel group from the previous study [14]
and the new elements in clusters LTR_CB1 and 9 of the C.
briggsae genome. The third group C contains new elements in the C. elegans genome and C. briggsae genome.
We note that this preliminary analysis needs to be analyzed further based on retroelements identified in multiple genomes.

A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was also generated
for the RT domains identified by our method in LTR retroelements from D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura
(Figure 6). Interestingly, the bootstrap support value is
greater than 50% in most of the branches except those in
the bottom. The clusters (DP28, DP35, DP40, and DP41,
highlighted in red) are located in the group of clusters
from D. melanogaster. One group (a) contains clusters only
from the D. pseudoobscura genome while two other groups
(b and c) are mixed of clusters from both genomes.

Conclusion
We proposed a novel computational method for de novo
identification of LTR retrotransposons in eukaryotic
genomes. It has been applied to several complete eukaryotic genomes and identified many new putative intact LTR
retroelements, among which a few new potential families
were discovered.

Methods
Our de novo approach to identifying LTR retrotransposons
consists of three steps, each using different algorithms
(Figure 7): (1) identification of young intact LTR retrotransposons; (2) identification of solo LTRs; (3) identification of old intact LTR retrotransposons. We also
developed several computer programs to analyze the
identified LTR retrotransposons.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/90

Genomic sequences
The genomic sequences of C. elegans, C. briggsae, D. melanogaster, and D. pseudoobscura were obtained from public
domains. The complete genomic sequence of C. elegans
(WS120) and a draft genomic sequence of C. briggsae
(cb25.agp8) were downloaded from Wormbase at the
Sanger Institute[31]. The complete genomic sequence of
D. melanogaster (Release 4.0) was downloaded from the
website of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project [32].
The draft genomic sequence of D. pseudoobscura (Release
1.0) was downloaded from FlyBase [33].
De novo identification of young intact LTR retroelements
Given a genomic sequence, we first try to identify young
intact LTR retrotransposons. Each intact LTR retroelement
contains a pair of LTRs at each end (5' and 3'). It is generally known that the length of LTRs ranges from 100 to
1000 bp and their distance (including the length of the
two LTRs, or the entire length of the intact element) ranges
from 1000 to 20000 bp. The age of intact LTR retrotransposons may be dated by the identity between their two
LTRs, because these two LTRs are identical at the time of
transposition. Many of the intact LTR retroelements are
young, i.e. they were transposed into their current locations in recent evolutionary history, and hence, the identities between their LTRs are high. Our approach to
finding these young intact LTR retroelements is equivalent
to finding pairs of highly similar short subsequences
(LTRs, between 100 and 1000 bps long) located within a
range of distance (between 1000 to 20000) from the given
genome sequence. We adopted a fast approximate string
matching algorithm similar to that previously reported
[24]. The entire procedure consists of three heuristic steps
(Figure 8). The first step is to find pairs of maximal exact
direct repeats that are longer than 40 bp and located
within a range of distances (between 1000 bp and 20000
bp). This step can be done in linear time using a suffix
array data structure [34]. We modified a module of GAME
[35], which rapidly aligned microbial genomic sequences
based on MEM (Maximal Exact Match) detection using
suffix array and bottom-up traversal of suffix trees [36].
While traversing in a bottom-up fashion, each node in the
suffix array utilizes a hash structure to map a character to
a position list, which indexes all substrings and their leftmost characters. When visiting a leaf node, the corresponding suffix string is added to the position list of its
leftmost character. MEMs then can be detected by a self
cross-product of the array. In the second step, these
(short) exact direct repeats were merged into longer fragments by combining multiple direct repeats if two consecutive repeats are in close proximity with intervening
lengths less than 20 bp. Pairs of merged fragment (potential pairs of LTRs) within a range of lengths (between 100
and 2000 bp) and with identities greater than 80% were
retained. We stress that using the criteria described above,

Identification of intact LTR retroelements (Step 1 in Figure 7)
Identification of intact LTR retroelements (Step 1 in Figure 7)
consists of three steps. (a) Pairs of maximal exact direct
repeats (> 40 bp) were found; (b) Repeats were merged if
they were proximal in the genome locations, if the length of
the merged repeats is greater than 100 bp and the identity is
greater than 80%; (c) If the segment capped by repeats contain frequent protein domains (RT, RNaseH, or IN), or an
ORF (>700 bp), they were retained.

we can only identify those pairs of subsequences (fragments) that are very similar to each other (i.e. containing
at least a 40 bp long identical subsequences and with an
overall identity higher than 80%). As a result, we may
miss some relatively old intact LTR retroelements, of
which some can be recovered by the next steps of our
methods. In the third step, we scan open reading frames
(ORFs) within the sequence in the middle of each pair of
fragments (potential LTR retroelements) using Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs) of protein domains that are
often observed in LTR retrotransposons, including groupspecific antigen (gag), protease (prt), reverse transcriptase
(RT), RNaseH, and integrase (IN), all taken from Pfam
database (version 19) [37]. The scan was conducted using
HMMSearch from profile HMM package HMMER,
obtained from Washington University [38]. We retained
only those pairs of fragments containing a set of protein
domains having a combined E-value less than a threshold
(1.0e-10); or containing a long enough ORF (> 700 bp).
We retained the candidate LTR retroelements containing
no known frequent protein domains, but with a long
ORF, to avoid missing completely new elements. In the
last step, we eliminated those pairs of fragments (potential LTRs) matching with known repeats defined as DNA
transposons in Repbase [3], which are likely false positives (i.e. two transposons that were inserted into proxi-

mal locations instead of a single LTR retrotransposon).
The locations of these RNA transposons in these four
genomes were obtained from UCSC Genome Browser
[23].
Identification of Solo LTRs
Solo LTRs are created by recombination between two
intact LTRs during evolution. In order to identify solo
LTRs, LTRs from intact retroelements identified in the previous step were first clustered based on their sequence
similarity, using a BAG clustering algorithm [22]. The
BAG clustering algorithm represented all LTRs from intact
retroelements by an undirected graph, in which each node
represented a LTR sequence and a weighted edge between
two LTR were created if the sequence similarity between
corresponding LTRs was above a preset cutoff threshold.
Smith-Waterman alignment score from FASTA comparison of two LTRs was used as a similarity measure. BAG
generated clusters of LTRs by iteratively splitting a graph
into biconnected components with an increased cutoff
score at each iteration while forcing two LTRs from the
same intact element to be grouped into the same cluster.
Next, for each cluster of LTR sequences, we aligned them
using CLUSTALW and the resulting multiple alignment
was used to generate a profile HMM using HMMBuild
from the HMMER package. Finally, HMMSearch from the
same package was used to search for HMMs from all the
LTR clusters against the entire genome to identify potential LTRs, including solos. The threshold of E-value for the
search was set up as 1.0e-9, which was determined based
on the best recovery of known solo LTRs.

Identification of old intact LTR retroelements
In the previous sections, we have shown how we identified young LTR retroelements that contain highly similar
pairs of LTRs. However, this approach may miss those relatively old LTR retrotransposons that contain two LTRs
that are no longer highly similar to each other. To address
this issue, a phylogenetic analysis was carried out. We
built a phylogenetic tree for all solo LTRs in the same cluster. Some LTRs among them may not be true solos;
instead they may be located within certain distance ranges
and the sequence between them may actually be an intact
retroelement. The reason why they are classified as "solo
LTRs" is simply because they are not highly similar to each
other to be identified based on the criteria used in the first
step. We classified a pair of "solo" LTRs into a single (old)
intact retroelement, if they are (1) located within certain
distance range in the genome; and (2) closest neighbors in
the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1).
Software implementation
We implemented the method described above in a software package, using C++ and Perl. The source code of the
major part of program can be downloaded from the supplementary website [39]. The typical running time for
analyzing a eukaryotic genome ranges from several hours
to tens of hours.
Phylogenetic analysis
Throughout the paper, all phylogenetic analysis was done
in two steps. The sequences were first aligned using CLUSTALW [40] and then the neighbor-joining tree was built
using PHYLIP [41] with 1000 bootstraps.
Analysis of the distribution of the genomic locations of LTR
retroelements
The chromosomal distribution of LTRs was analyzed by a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The null hypothesis
based on a uniform distribution was used to determine
whether the chromosomal distribution of LTRs is random. The pre-defined function for KS test in MATLAB was
used for this purpose. For further analyses, the chromosomal distribution of the ratios between the number of
intact LTR retroelements and solo LTRs in the D. melanogaster genome was computed and plotted along coordinate bins of chromosomes 2, 3, and X.
