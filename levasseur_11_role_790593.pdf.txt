The role of duplications in the evolution of
genomes highlights the need for evolutionarybased approaches in comparative genomics
Anthony Levasseur1,2*, Pierre Pontarotti3*

Abstract: Understanding the evolutionary plasticity of the genome requires a global, comparative approach in
which genetic events are considered both in a phylogenetic framework and with regard to population genetics
and environmental variables. In the mechanisms that generate adaptive and non-adaptive changes in genomes,
segmental duplications (duplication of individual genes or genomic regions) and polyploidization (whole genome
duplications) are well-known driving forces. The probability of fixation and maintenance of duplicates depends on
many variables, including population sizes and selection regimes experienced by the corresponding genes: a
combination of stochastic and adaptive mechanisms has shaped all genomes. A survey of experimental work
shows that the distinction made between fixation and maintenance of duplicates still needs to be conceptualized
and mathematically modeled. Here we review the mechanisms that increase or decrease the probability of fixation
or maintenance of duplicated genes, and examine the outcome of these events on the adaptation of the
organisms.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Dr. Etienne Joly, Dr. Lutz Walter and Dr. W. Ford Doolittle.

Background
Genomes are shaped by a series of processes involving
substitutions, insertions, deletions, transpositions, shuffling of exons or chromosomes, lateral gene transfer,
gene fusion or fission, de novo origination, and gene and
genome duplications. The fate of the modified genes
depends closely on the mutation type. For example, exon
shuffling and substitutions are likely to have different
outcomes on gene function and the subsequent putative
fixation or maintenance of the new gene. Since the work
of Ohno (1970) [1] gene and genome duplication has
been considered as a primary driving force in the adaptive evolution of genomes and genetic systems. Duplication may even be considered as a “master mutation”, as it
promotes the accumulation of subsequent mutations on
duplicates, as described below (substitutions, indels, etc.).

A duplication can be segmental (from a few nucleotides to several thousand kilobases) or may cover the
whole genome (an event also called polyploidization).
Segmental duplication (or small-scale duplication) and
polyploidization correspond to distinct evolutionary processes with widely different impacts. Segmental duplication is a frequent event that occurs in all eukaryote
lineages as part of a “continuous” process [2].
By contrast, polyploidization is a much more infrequent and spectacular mutation event that leads to
either extinction or re-diploidization. The diploidization
process, involving non-homologous recombination
events together with deletions and pseudogenizations of
genes, generates duplicated chromosomes that differ in
large segments, but still exhibit paralogous regions.
Three polyploidization events have occurred in the
last 150 million years in the Arabidopsis thaliana lineage. By contrast, no detectable polyploidization event
has occurred in the Drosophila lineage for the last
600 million years. Segmental duplication of functional
genes generates two copies, one of which generally loses
its function rapidly through pseudogenization. Empirical
data suggests that the majority of duplicates become

pseudogenized in vertebrates. In the remaining cases,
both duplicates are fixed either because one of the
duplicates shifts toward a new function (neofunctionalization) or because the two copies subfunctionalize (e.g.,
the copies differentiate their expression patterns through
the evolution of different cis-regulatory modules).
The nature of the duplication event (segmental or
whole-genome) will influence the likelihood of specific
genes being lost or fixed. For instance, local duplication
of a gene whose product is involved in a large interacting network will generate supernumerary duplicates that
will disturb the network stoichiometry (gene dosage
principle). In this case, the duplication event will be
counter-selected. On the other hand, if the same gene is
duplicated through a polyploidization event, all the
members of the network will likewise be duplicated,
retaining the network stoichiometry and reducing the
likelihood of the duplicate being counter-selected.
In this review, the mechanisms of duplication, the processes of fixation or maintenance of duplicates and their
impact in evolutionary history are discussed. We go on to
describe experimental works that shed light on the fates of
duplicates through classical events (such as neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization). Conceptual approaches
are discussed that take into account evolutionary biology
at the scale of gene, genome and population.

Mechanisms of duplication
Segmental duplication

The best-described mechanism causing segmental duplications from a few base pairs to several thousand kilobases is unequal crossing-over [3,4]. One of the most
famous examples of large segmental duplication is the
primate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) [5].
Other mechanisms that generate segmental duplications
are transposition and retrotransposition events. As
transposition is a “cut-and-paste” process, it is not likely
that transposition results in a duplication events unless
it is associated with lateral gene transfer (LGT). In specific cases, “cut-and-paste” transposition can result in
duplication i.e. if it occurs in germ cells prior to meiosis
and moves DNA from one chromosomal set to the
other. LGT seems to be frequent only in bacteria and
archebacteria [6], in which it can generate duplication.
On the other hand, retrotransposition seems a frequent
event in many eukaryote lineages. In metazoa, the maximum size of the duplicated segment corresponds to a
transcript messenger (with the exclusion of C. elegans,
in which co-transcription of multiple genes is possible).
Whole genome duplication: polyploidization

This event is recurrent in eukaryotes (especially plants)
and has also been described in bacteria [7-9]. In eukaryotes, documented polyploidization events comprise both

Page 2 of 12

autopolyploidy (polyploidization within a species) and
allopolyploidy (hybridization between closely-related species). Polyploidization events that occurred long ago in
the history of various lineages are difficult to detect
because of subsequent remodeling of the genome
through gene losses and recombinations. Ancient genome polyploidization (termed paleopolyploidization) has,
for example, occurred in yeasts, angiosperms and teleost
fishes [10]. Polyploidization can occur via various
mechanisms, such as genomic doubling, gametic nonreduction and polyspermy. Genome doubling and
gametic non-reduction involve failure of cell division
during mitosis and meiosis, respectively. Unreduced eggs
seem common in both animals and plants, whereas unreduced spermatozoa seem to be common only in plants.
An obstacle facing newly-formed tetraploid individuals
is the fact that crossing with diploid relatives generates
triploids, generally considered to be an evolutionary
dead-end as they tend to produce aneuploid gametes
owing to problems of chromosomal pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, it has been demonstrated
that triploids can generate euploid (haploid, diploid, triploid) gametes at a low rate [11]. These euploid gametes
can then produce triploid or tetraploid offspring. Thus
triploids seem to be important, as they may facilitate the
transition from diploidy to tetraploidy, and successful
establishment of polyploidy appears to be facilitated by
perenniality (because overlapping generations allow mating between triploids and their parents). Finally, selfing
greatly facilitates polyploidization because it allows triploids to be maintained for several generations until
stable polyploidy is generated. Interestingly, studies in
plants have shown that the rate of polyploidy formation
varies with environmental conditions and parental origin
[12,13]. For instance, a sudden freeze during egg development causes more frequent production of unreduced
gametes. High rates of hybridization (e.g., in hybrid
zones) may facilitate polyploidization, which in turn facilitates the generation of isolated lineages, as polyploids
tend to be reproductively isolated from diploid ancestors.
Studies in plants have shown that the mean frequency of
diploid gametes found in hybrids (28%) is about 50 times
greater that in non-hybrids (around 0.5%). Interspecific
hybrids often experience severe meiotic disorders
because of homologous chromosome miss-pairing.

Mechanisms involved in the fixation and
maintenance of duplicates
Conceptual distinction between fixation and maintenance
of duplicates

Before going further, we need to make a conceptual distinction between fixation and maintenance of duplicates
in order to decipher step-by-step the fates of duplicates
in the genome. Numerous studies of gene duplication

Levasseur and Pontarotti Biology Direct 2011, 6:11
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/11

have focused on the mechanisms and functional consequences of duplicated genes at the molecular or organism scale. A biased interpretation of the role of
duplication is carried out whether the process of duplication itself is not clearly unravelled. Three steps are
responsible for leading to the generation of preserved
gene duplicates: i) mutational events (duplication),
ii) fixation of duplicates, and iii) maintenance or preservation. In this review, we define fixation rate as the
probability that a duplicate, regardless of its functionality, spreads into a population (i.e., becomes fixed), and
maintenance rate as the probability that a duplicate is
stabilized in a population (preservation). We can propose the following theoretical classification for gene
duplicates:
Cat 1. Spreading difficult, maintenance difficult
Cat 2. Spreading difficult, maintenance easy
Cat 3. Spreading easy, maintenance difficult
Cat 4. Spreading easy, maintenance easy.
In the literature, duplication rate is a combination of
the duplicating mutation and fixation rates. Most studies
have used an empirical value for duplicating mutations
(depending on specific lineages) and so the fixation rate
is considered equal to the duplication rate. However, the
rate of fixation of duplications cannot be used a priori
to estimate rate of mutational origin [14]. Conceptual
distinction between mutational generation (duplication),
fixation and maintenance has critical implications for
genome-scale studies as highlighted by experimental
works. For instance, Davis and Petrov [15] investigated
which types of genes are likely to generate functional
and persistent duplicates and proposed that slowly evolving genes have a tendency to generate duplicates.
Indeed, duplicated genes in the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans have much
slower rates of amino acid substitution, insertion and
deletion than single copy genes. However, authors concluded that it is still unclear whether fixation, maintenance, or both of these steps together cause the bias
towards the preferential duplication and highlighted that
the relative importance of these two steps depends largely on the frequency with which duplicate genes are
fixed by positive selection [15].
Duplication rate is also hard to estimate because of
the difficulty in distinguishing true newly born duplicates from old ones that appear young because of gene
conversion. Gene conversion is a homogenizing process
between two homologous DNA fragments occurring
during recombination. The divergence between two
DNA fragments is biased and decreases dramatically following gene conversion. New models have been studied;
for instance, Pan and Zhang propose an interesting
strategy using unequal crossover and retrotransposition,
to estimate rate that involves separate quantification of

Page 3 of 12

the rates of two different mechanisms of gene duplication and subsequent combination of the two rates,
weighted according to their respective contributions to
the overall gene duplication rate [16].
Conceptually, rate of duplication has to be considered
as the resultant of a three-step process: duplicating
mutations, fixation of duplicates, and finally maintenance of duplicates (long-term survival).
Fates of genes after segmental duplication

Segmental duplication occurs in one individual within a
breeding population, and the fixation of duplicates is
constrained by classical variables of population genetics.
Models of population genetics predict that an entirely
redundant duplicate copy cannot be maintained in the
genome for long, as harmful mutations will accumulate.
Conversely, functional divergence will favor long-term
retention of duplicates. Two major processes of divergence are possible; (i) neofunctionalization, where one
copy retains the ancestral function while the other
acquires a novel function ([1,17], and (ii) subfunctionalization, where the ancestral functions of the progenitor
gene are partitioned between the duplicates, so that the
union of activities and expression patterns of the duplicates are equivalent to those of the progenitor gene
[18,19]. Modeling of the process predicts that subfunctionalization will be complex in populations with large
effective sizes [20,21]. He and Zhang [22] broadened the
concept of neofunctionalization by considering that a
duplicate may retain all, none, or part of the ancestral
functions. We note that different authors emphasize different meanings of ‘gene function’ [23]. For example,
Hughes [18] refers to subfunctionalization of protein
biochemical function, whereas Force et al. [19] emphasize subfunctionalized patterns of gene expression.
One model, the duplication-degeneration-complementation model (DDC) describing the fate of duplicates
was proposed by Force et al. [19] and illustrated in the
works of van Hoof [24]. It involves complementary
degenerative mutations in cis-regulatory modules: a
fixed degenerative mutation in a regulatory module of
duplicate A is followed by (i) accumulation of additional
fixed degenerative mutations in the same copy, leading
to its pseudogenization, or (ii) mutations, in copy B, of a
complementary regulatory module (this second mutation occurs in a module that remains intact in copy A
so that the two copies become essential for complete
gene expression, preventing pseudogenization of either
one), or (iii) by acquisition of a new function in copy B,
through mutation in a complementary regulatory module (copy A is retained because it exhibits the original
function associated with the non-mutated regulatory
module). Obviously, probabilities of fixation of duplicates will also depend on the size of the population, and

Levasseur and Pontarotti Biology Direct 2011, 6:11
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/11

the selective pressures associated with the mutations in
the corresponding cis-regulatory modules.
Fate of genes after polyploidization

One striking result concerning polyploids is that despite
unstable genomes and rapid re-patterning, the addition
to the genome of a complete set of chromosomes is
remarkably well-tolerated in eukaryotes (and many current species descend from polyploid ancestors). Why is
whole genome duplication more likely to generate
lineages that persist over evolutionary time? Although
the fate of genes after whole genome duplication
depends on mechanisms similar to those discussed
above for local duplication (pseudogenization, neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization), fixation of polyploidy cannot be discussed solely in the same terms as
fixation of segmental duplicates, because polyploids tend
to be at least partially isolated from the ancestral (nonpolyploid) population by reproductive incompatibility.
Furthermore, in the case of plants, polyploids can often
be maintained through selfing and vegetative
reproduction.
We might expect the offspring of polyploid individuals
to be necessarily polyploid. However, experiments on
synthetic polyploids show that gene inactivation or subfunctionalization occur as early as the first generation
via genome imprinting and genomic changes [25]. This
process has been evidenced for both allo- and autopolyploids [26]. Song et al. [25] observed extensive genomic
rearrangements and fragment losses within five generations of plant hybrids in the genus Brassica. Other studies report genomic changes soon after formation of
wheat and Arabidopsis allopolyploids but not in cotton
or cordgrass Spartina (a natural polyploid) [27]. In most
of the examples studied, rapid genomic re-patterning
has been observed in allopolyploids but not in autopolyploids. There are several reasons to suppose that hybridization may be responsible for re-patterning. For
instance, transposable elements that are repressed within
each parent lineage, but that can be activated in hybrids,
could facilitate gene translocation and unequal crossingovers. Josefsson et al. [28] found that maternally-derived
siRNAs of hybrids were not sufficient to repress the retrotransposons originating from the parental genomes in
Arabidopsis thaliana X Arabidopsis arenosa hybrids.
Furthermore, divergence between centromeric histones
from parental species may lead to chromosome segregation distortion and non-disjunction in hybrids. In addition, non-homologous recombination and nonreciprocal exchanges are particularly likely among
homologous chromosomes with structural differences.
Nevertheless, genomic re-patterning in polyploidy is not
driven exclusively by hybridization. In autotetraploids of
both Candida albicans [29] and S. cerevisiae [30],

Page 4 of 12

genome size reduction through chromosome losses has
been observed. In the second study, haploid and tetraploid lines reverted to diploidy in 1800 generations.
These experiments show that entire sets of chromosomes can be lost, although the exact mechanisms
involved remain unknown.
Genomic re-patterning may also increase the genetic
variability of newly formed polyploid populations. This
variability can be beneficial for the generated polyploid lineage as it can counteract the reduction of
variability due to drastic reduction of population size,
which is generally associated with polyploidization
events. Surviving polyploids therefore probably form a
biased subset of those that have been generated; we
witness only lineages that have evolved towards particularly fit and stable genomic configurations soon
after polyploidization.
Besides drastic structural changes in their genomes,
polyploids also often exhibit tissue-specific changes in
gene expression (for review see [27]). This is especially so
for allopolyploids, which can experience (i) changes in
methylation [31], (ii) disruption of heterochromatin leading to retrotransposon activation [28] and (iii) alteration
in imprinting and biased expression of homologs [32].
For example, Adams et al. [26] found that cotton allopolyploids differed from parental individuals in tissuespecific expression patterns for 11 out of 18 genes
analyzed.
As is the case for genome rearrangement, most
changes in gene expression seem to be due to hybridization rather than to polyploidy per se [31,33] and are correlated with divergence between the parental species
[28]. Much smaller effects on gene expression were
found in autopolyploids than in allopolyploids. Proteomic analyses in autopolyploid cabbage have shown very
few expression changes [34]. Song et al. [25] also
observed that less extensive genomic rearrangements
occurred in allopolyploids when formed from more closely related species.
Mechanisms favoring or opposing fixation or
maintenance of duplicates
Neofunctionalization

Neofunctionalization is context-dependent and may
require multiple mutations. This process is better
known as the ‘Dykhuisen-Hartl’ effect [35,36]: as one
copy of a duplicated gene can freely mutate (a single
copy must remain under pre-existing selective constraints), these mutations can lead to either pseudogenization or neofunctionalization. Mutations that are
neutral in a particular environment can be positively
selected by new environments or by epistatic interactions with subsequent mutations. The coefficient of
selection can therefore vary in time.

Levasseur and Pontarotti Biology Direct 2011, 6:11
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/11

Neofunctionalization can be classified into two
types: “stricto sensu” neofunctionalization and microneofunctionalization. The first type involves a radical
shift in biochemical function or expression pattern, giving rise to a new function at high levels of organization
[37,38]. Examples in the literature include the crystalline
proteins, the antifreeze proteins and many proteins from
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (for a
review, see [23,37].
The second type, namely micro-neofunctionalization,
involves a shift in the specificity of a metabolic activity,
or in affinity for a given ligand, etc. [39]. Genes involved
in recognition of the environment (such as olfactory
receptors or MHC genes) probably originated through
micro-neofunctionalization.
Micro-neofunctionalization may be responsible for the
surprising observation that bacterial strains can be recovered at higher-than-expected frequencies when they are
plated on specific media in which mutations are advantageous. Hendrickson et al. [40] showed that increased
mutation frequency was the direct consequence of an
increase in the target gene copy number. For example,
bacteria carrying a defective, but leaky, lacZ- allele produced more lacZ+ revertants than expected when cultures
were plated on lactose minimal medium. Most of these
mutants appeared not during growth in liquid medium
(i.e., before plating), but after a period of very slow growth
on the lactose plates. The mechanisms responsible for this
effect are as follows: first, the lacZ - allele is strongly
expressed, allowing bacteria to survive on lactose by producing very large amounts of the defective enzyme; this
increase in gene expression is selectively advantageous, as
it amplifies the minimal activity of the lacZ- allele to a
level that permits cell survival. Second, the presence of
multiple copies of the lacZ- allele makes more likely the
chance occurrence of a mutation restoring the wild type
(LacZ+) activity, and thus optimal growth on lactose. Once
a gene copy reverts to the wild type allele, it spreads
throughout the bacterial population and overruns the
other gene copies, which rapidly disappear. This model
proposed by Francino [41] is called ‘adaptive radiation’. It
postulates an initial period of positive selection for gene
amplification, followed by positive selection on the paralog
copies for the acquisition of an advantageous phenotype.
As proposed in the lacZ system, gene amplification could
initially provide the means to reach biologically relevant
levels of protein functionality, before neofunctionalization
occurs. The evolution or expansion of multigenic families
involved in sensory perception (e.g., olfactory receptor
families) may be partly explained by this process.
Subfunctionalization via specialization

Several authors have shown that neither neofunctionalization nor subfunctionalization alone can adequately
account for retention. Analysis of the genome-wide

Page 5 of 12

patterns of yeast protein interaction and human gene
expression for duplicate genes has revealed rapid subfunctionalization accompanied by prolonged, substantial
“stricto sensu“ neofunctionalization in a large proportion
of duplicate genes, suggesting a new model, termed
“sub-neofunctionalization“. A possible biological explanation is that subfunctionalization could be followed by
neofunctionalization with positive selection because of
the pleiotropic constraint release [18,22,42]. However,
we could also consider that the term “specialization”
would be more appropriate in this particular case.
Gene duplications and genetic robustness

Genetic robustness can be defined as (i) the ability of a
biological system to withstand mutations due to redundancy, here the ability of duplicates to balance loss of
function in other copies and (ii) participation in a biological network, e.g., alternative metabolic pathways and
regulatory networks. Duplicate genes undergo relaxed
selection shortly after their duplication, which enables
them to tolerate more nucleotide changes than their single-copy counterparts. Similar scenarios take place for
whole genome duplication (WGD), where gene duplicates can tolerate up to 10 times more amino acid
changes than old duplicates in vertebrates [43,44].
Robustness is therefore essential in evolutionary innovation and phenotypic diversity.
Dominant negative mutations

Dominant negative mutations are mutations whose gene
product adversely affects the function of the normal
wild-type gene product within the same cell. Dominant
negative mutations are therefore often more damaging
than null mutations. The probability of gene loss will
therefore be correlated with the proportion of possible
dominant negative mutations. Cooke et al. [45] has
hypothesized that partial protein damage has a stronger
phenotype than null mutants caused by loss of gene
expression. It has been stated above that duplicated
genes with full redundancy can be expected to reduce to
a single copy over time through the stochastic accumulation of mutations that harm one of the genes. In some
genes, point mutations damaging protein integrity could
also cause a defective phenotype. Thus the genetic
redundancy cannot easily decay away through the accumulation of point mutations. The corollary of this is
seen in knock-out studies showing that many genes can
be removed in a single step that abolishes the expression
of the protein-encoding gene, although point mutations
of these proteins often have phenotypes. Cooke argued
that naturally-occurring deletions are rarer than point
mutations and to be viable must avoid damaging neighboring genes. Hence only a few deletion events suffice
to knock out a gene. This effect will increase according
to the interactiveness of the protein. Therefore, highly
connected protein duplicates are retained because of

Levasseur and Pontarotti Biology Direct 2011, 6:11

gene dosage sensitivity and dominant negative countereffect.
Dosage sensitivity: dual consequences

If the product of a duplicated gene belongs to a large
protein complex, the duplication event can be counterselected because it may generate imbalance among
members of the protein complex. The gene dosage balance hypothesis (GDBH) proposes that such stoichiometric imbalances in macromolecular complexes are a
source of dominant negative phenotypes [46,47]. General evidence supporting the GDBH has been found for
example in yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana: focusing on
essential genes, Papp et al. [48] have shown that dosagesensitive genes are at least twice as likely to encode proteins involved in complexes as genes with low dosage
sensitivity. Furthermore, a statistically significant higher
proportion of genes whose overexpression is lethal
encode proteins involved in complexes [48]. Three
predictions, largely confirmed by experimental work,
can be made: (i) artificial overexpression of one subunit
should be harmful, (ii) the strength of transcriptional
co-regulation of subunits can be expected to reflect
dosage sensitivity, and (iii) duplication of a single gene
whose product is involved in a protein complex is likely
to be harmful. Besides protein interaction stoichiometry,
gene balance is believed to be governed by regulatory
effects. Relative numbers of regulatory genes modify the
expression of the target genes. Whenever there is competition between different offspring, dosage-sensitive
gene losses will be counter-selected. Dosage sensitivity
can be qualified by a dosage compensation effect.
A trans-acting dosage effect can negatively affect the
expression not only of genes located elsewhere in the
genome, but also of the genes present on the same
chromosome, yielding a compensation result. By contrast, duplication by WGD increases the dosage of all
genes and so should not affect the balance. Analysis of
duplicate genes arising from paleopolyploidization
events in angiosperm, vertebrate, teleost, yeast and
Paramecium phyla [49] support this prediction: the
transcription factors along with proteins involved in
protein binding, protein modification, and protein
degradation, were more strongly retained than other
protein functional classes [46-48].
Putative role of hitchhiking in gene duplication

Local duplication can involve large genomic regions
encompassing several genes. The probabilities of neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization or pseudogenization of each gene in the duplicon are unchanged, but
positive or negative selection on a gene within the duplicon will influence the fate of the linked genes [50].
Intrinsic genome evolution

Lynch and Conery [2] suggested an inverse correlation
between population size and genome size (the difference

Page 6 of 12

in genome sizes among species being due to intron size,
the presence of different repetitive elements, and the
presence of duplicates). They suggested that purifying
selection was intense in large populations, essentially
precluding fixation of significantly damaging mutations,
whereas mutation with substantial damaging effects
could be fixed by random drift in small populations.
Hence duplications might be fixed despite their potentially damaging nature. For instance, a newly inserted
intron requires a critical mass of nucleotides (n = 20-40
nucleotides in range) to be accurately recognized and
removed. Understanding the origins of eukaryotic genome complexity in adaptive terms is rendered difficult
by the fact that each length increase of a gene raises its
vulnerability to mutational inactivation, thereby favoring
its elimination from the population.

Relative contributions of polyploidization versus
local duplication to genome evolution
If duplications are considered as a major source of
genomic novelty, then the frequency of such events will
be crucial to the evolution of species. Participation in
the creation of new genetic materials from whole genome duplication and local duplication will depend on
the phylum. Some phyla show greater propensity than
others to be polyploidized. For instance, the angiosperms contain 30 to 80 percent of species in a neopolyploid state, unlike the Drosophila lineages, which do not
seem to have polyploidized for at least 600 million
years. Regional duplication processes will probably have
a deeper impact in species that do not polyploidize than
in those that do. Around 15% of the genes in the
human genome are believed to arise from duplication
events, whereas gene duplicates account for 8-20% of
the Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans,
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes. However, these
estimates are highly dependent on the sensitivity
required to determine when a duplicate is detectable
and others works hypothesized that almost all human
genes resulted from ancient duplication [51].
Examples in vertebrates

Genomic comparative analyses have revealed unexpected dynamics concerning family size, and once again
underline the importance of gene and genome duplication in the history of evolution. In vertebrates, two
rounds of whole genome duplications are thought to
have played an essential role in the establishment of
gene repertoires [52]. These events occurred during
chordate evolution after the split of the urochordate and
cephalochordate lineages, before the radiation of extant
gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). The rate of local
duplication is estimated at between 1 gene per 100 and
1 gene per 1000 per million years [44,53].

Levasseur and Pontarotti Biology Direct 2011, 6:11
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/11

Calculations were performed as described below.
Lynch and Conery assumed that the number of silent
substitutions per site increased approximately linearly
with time. The relative age distribution of gene duplicates within a genome can therefore be inferred indirectly from the distribution of silent substitutions. For all
the species tested the highest density of duplicates
tended to be contained within the youngest age classes,
with the density dropping off rapidly with increasing
silent substitution. A smooth decay was seen with species that had probably not recently polyploidized, such
as Homo sapiens. This observation is explained by the
birth and death process [54]; the youngest age category
represents newly arisen duplicates, and the subsequent
decline in frequency results from mutational processes
that eliminate complete open reading frames (deletions
or frameshift mutations). The rates of birth and loss of
such genes can be derived directly from the observed
age distribution, assuming that these rates have
remained essentially constant within the age class
employed in the analysis. From this analysis Lynch and
Conery found that the average probability of duplication
of a eukaryotic gene was 1 percent per million years.
Cotton and Page also showed that a constant birth
and death rate model was appropriate for gene duplication data, allowing the estimation of the rate of gene
duplication and loss in vertebrates over the last 200 Myr
(0.115 percent duplication, 0.74 percent losses). In this
case, they used estimated times from fossils and molecular clock data. We must bear in mind that the aim of
such analyses is to evaluate the average evolutionary
properties of the members of duplicate gene pairs, and
that some of the gene pairs will survive longer than
average owing to positive selection (via neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization) or be shorter-lived than
average owing to negative selection against the duplicate
(see above).
Dynamics of gene family size

The comparison of whole genomes reveals changes in
the size of specific gene families among organisms [55],
and several authors have found it possible to infer
ancestral state and deduce which lineages in gene
families have contracted or expanded. This approach
enables us to classify gene families into the conceptual
categories listed in III.1. The authors used a model of
stochastic birth and death for the gene family that could
be applied to multispecies genome comparisons. This
model takes into account the branch length of phylogenetic trees, together with duplication and deletion rates,
and so provides expectations for divergence in gene
family size among lineages. This affords an estimate for
the rate of fixation and loss for a given family. The analysis of Hahn et al. [55] is based on birth and death

Page 7 of 12

processes, but it might be more usefully considered as a
fixation index and maintenance index. They analyzed
gene families contained within the whole human genome, chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog, and found that
more than half of the 9990 families present in the mammalian common ancestor had either expanded or contracted along at least one lineage. They also found 164
families to be evolving non-randomly at P < 10-5. With
this cut-off threshold, they expected no family to be significant by chance. The most common biological functions assigned to these gene families included immune
defense gene, neuron developments and intercellular
communication and transport. Interestingly, comparisons of both synonymous to non-synonymous nucleotide divergence and regulatory sequence divergence also
showed gene categories with these biological functions.
The authors concluded that natural selection could act
at many levels during adaptive molecular evolution. The
real situation could probably be more complex, as a
duplicate that is not important for the function will
tend to be less constrained (some proteins are more
constrained than others; environmental proteins may
have less constrained sites). Specific functional studies
on these families would thus be informative.

Experimental work
Non-evolutionary-biology-based analyses

Numerous analyses based on non-evolutionary
approaches have been published. Below we describe two
interesting examples that demonstrate the need to integrate evolutionary history into experimental work.
Interactome analyses

He and Zhang [22] analyzed the high confidence interaction data compiled by Von Mering and those annotated in the MIPS database. A total of 331 gene pairs
and 745 singleton genes underwent the following analysis: the authors looked for duplicate pairs, numbers of
specific partners and numbers of shared partners. After
gene duplication the two duplicates have the same interaction partners. In the subfunctionalization model, each
duplicate gradually loses partners, but the number of
total partners remains constant over time. The mean
number of total partners for duplicate genes was about
8.6. This was more than for a singleton gene, where a
value of 4.7 was found (the difference was statistically
tested). The authors concluded that the model that best
explained their results was the neofunctionalization
model. However, it is still possible that genes staying in
single copy and duplicating genes have different number
of partners, and evolutionary-based analysis should be
performed to conclude.
Expression analyses

He and Zhang also analyzed human gene expression
including the expression levels of 7565 human genes in

Levasseur and Pontarotti Biology Direct 2011, 6:11
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/11

25 independent and non-redundant tissues [56]. They
transformed the quantitative expression levels into discrete expression patterns (expressed or unexpressed).
They analyzed expression patterns of 515 singletons and
1230 pairs of duplicate genes and found that the number of expression sites per duplicate pair was significantly greater than that per singleton gene. This refutes
the pure subfunctionalization model. Using the synonymous mutation distance between duplicates as a clock,
they examined how the number of expression sites had
increased over time since duplication. To reduce random fluctuations, they put duplicates into seven bins
depending on their divergence times and found that the
number of expression sites and the times of duplication
were positively correlated.
Evolutionary-biology-based analyses

Ideally, all studies concerning the function of duplicates
should be integrated into evolutionary-based approaches
where the history of a gene and the corresponding function have to be sought. Phylogenetic methods, for example, have been developed for inferring ancestral
expression profiles or ancestral functions of homologs.
In this case, the whole family history has to be integrated using the information at each branch of the tree
in order to deduce the ancestral pattern or ancestral
function at each node. Thus inferences about nodal
values permit the estimation of evolutionary changes
along each branch segment of an evolutionary tree
[57,58]. Because information is scant, authors use “trio
information”, i.e., between one ortholog and two coorthologs. In this case, the authors assume that orthologs retain the ancestral expression or function.
Gene-centred analyses

Subfunctionalization Hittinger and Caroll [59] investigated the evolution of one pair of duplicates in S. cerevisiae: GAL1 and GAL3. GAL1 encodes the
galactokinase enzyme and the GAL3 gene encodes a coinducer of galactokinase, able to sequester a repressor
of the gene transcription factor activating the galactose
use pathway. GAL1 and GAL3 have a co-ortholog in
Kluyveromyces lactis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
GAL1/GAL3 duplicated in the S. cerevisiae lineage after
the K. lactis and S. cerevisiae split. Compared with the
K. lactis co-ortholog, GAL3 has lost its enzymatic activity, whereas GAL1 has changed its regulatory requirements. The outcome is a more tightly controlled and
more highly inducible GAL1. The authors tested
whether GAL1 and GAL3 duplication and subfunctionalization could have been fixed via positive selection and
tested fitness differences in genetically manipulated
K. lactis. Increased expression of the gene module providing galactokinase activity enhanced fitness, whereas overexpression of the module equivalent to GAL3 reduced fitness.

Page 8 of 12

In S. cerevisiae, there is no such conflict, and therefore the
subfunctionalization could have been positively selected.
Subfunctionalization and genetic robustness Hickman
and Rusche [60] studied the duplicated histone deacetylases Sir2p and Hst1p in S. cerevisiae and found that
these paralogs with non-overlapping functions could
confer genetic robustness against null mutations
through a substitution mechanism. Hst1p is a NAD
(+)-dependent histone deacetylase that acts with Sum1p
to repress a subset of mid-sporulation genes. However,
the mutant deleted for hst1 showed much weaker derepression of target loci than the mutants deleted for
sum1. The authors showed that this weak derepression
of target loci in hst1Delta strains occurs partly because
Sir2p substitutes for Hst1p. Sir2p helps to repress the
mid-sporulation genes only in the absence of Hst1p and
is recruited to target promoters by a physical interaction
with the Sum1 complex. Also, when Sir2p associates
with the Sum1 complex, the complex continues to
repress in a promoter-specific manner and does not
spread. In addition, SIR2/HST1 gene from Kluyveromyces lactis, a closely related species that diverged prior
to the duplication, can suppress an hst1D mutation in
S. cerevisiae as well as interact with Sir4p. These results
suggest that the evolutionary path of duplicate gene preservation may be an important indicator for the ability
of duplicated genes to contribute to genetic robustness.
Subfunctionalization deduced from protein architecture Cusack and Wolfe describe how a bifunctional
gene, encoding two proteins by alternative splicing,
arose when the chloroplast gene RPL32 integrated into
an intron of the nuclear gene SODcp in an ancestor of
mangrove and poplar trees [61]. Mangrove retained the
alternatively spliced chimeric gene, but in the poplar
lineage, it underwent duplication and subfunctionalization, through complementary structural degeneration, to
re-form separate RPL32 and SODcp genes. The partitioning process is considered to be a subfunctionalization because structural changes in the poplar genes
indicated that after duplication a complementary loss of
subfunctions of the ancestral chimeric gene occurred in
its two daughter genes. The losses of exon X (encoding
the RPL32 subfunction) in the Poplar2 and Poplar3 lineage, and of exons 4, 7 and 8 (encoding the SOD subfunction) in Poplar1, were caused by degenerative
mutations that were probably selectively neutral because
in each case the subfunction lost by one gene copy was
maintained by the other.
Neofunctionalization with functional evidence Zhang
[62] reports that the gene encoding pancreatic ribonuclease was duplicated independently in Asian and African
leaf-eating monkeys. Statistical analyses of DNA
sequences, functional assays of reconstructed ancestral
proteins and site-directed mutagenesis showed that the

Levasseur and Pontarotti Biology Direct 2011, 6:11
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/11

new genes acquired enhanced digestive efficiencies
through parallel amino acid replacements driven by positive selection. They also lost a non-digestive function
independently, under a relaxed selective constraint.
These results demonstrate that despite the overall stochasticity, even molecular evolution has a certain degree
of repeatability and predictability under the pressures of
natural selection.
Large scale analyses

Growing information resulting from DNA sequence data
enable us to carry out large-scale comparative analyses.
Indirect information about biochemical function
Scannell and Wolfe [63] studied genes for which either
a single copy ortholog or double copy co-orthologs were
available in eight yeast species (four of which diverged
post-WGD while the four others diverged from an
ancestor pre-WGD). They showed that, on average, proteins encoded by duplicate pairs evolved at least three
times faster immediately post-WGD than single copy
genes, to which they behave identically in non-WGD
lineages. Although the high rate of duplicated genes
subsequently declined rapidly, it has not yet reverted to
the typical rate for single copy genes. They also showed
that although duplicate gene pairs often have highly
asymmetric rates of evolution, even the slower members
of pairs showed evidence of bursts of evolution after
duplication. Asymmetry after duplication was also evidenced in teleosts [64]. Kellis et al. demonstrate that the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arose from ancient
WGD, by sequencing and analysing a close specie Kluyveromyces waltii. Their results provide the first comparison across an ancient WGD event and offer the
opportunity to study the long-term fate of a genome
after duplication. In the majority of cases (95%), accelerated evolution concerned only one of the two paralogues. These results strongly support the model in which
one of the paralogues retained an ancestral function
while the other, relieved of this selective constraint, was
free to evolve more rapidly [65]. This asymmetry could
reflect positive selection or relaxation leading to neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization.
Expression and functional shift analyses Tirosh and
Barkai [66] developed a method to compare expression
profiles from different organisms and applied it to analyze
the expression divergence of yeast duplicated genes.
Expression profiles of S. cerevisae duplicate pairs were
compared with those of their co-orthologs in C. albicans.
Duplicate pairs were divided into two classes: symmetric
versus asymmetric rates of expression divergence. The
expression of many of these duplicate pairs is highly correlated, suggesting that they were retained by selection for
high protein dosage or evolved through other functional
aspects such as protein structure or interaction. The asymmetric class includes 43 duplicate gene pairs in which only

Page 9 of 12

one copy showed a significant expression similarity to the
C. albicans ortholog. Some of these cases may involve neutral evolution of gene expression of no functional significance, or they may involve regulatory neofunctionalization.
Wapinski et al. [49] developed a procedure to resolve
the evolutionary history of all genes in a large group of
species. Their procedures were applied to 17 fungal genomes to create a genome-wide catalog of gene trees to
determine precise orthology and paralogy relationships
across these species. Gene duplication and loss are
highly constrained by the functional properties and
interaction partners of genes. Annotations were performed with the well-annotated S. cerevisiae. In particular, stress-related genes exhibited many duplications and
losses, whereas growth-related genes showed selection
against such changes. Whole genome duplication circumvents these constraints and relaxes the dichotomy,
resulting in an expanded functional scope of gene duplication. By characterizing the functional fate of duplicate
genes, they showed that duplicated genes rarely diverged
with respect to the biochemical function, but typically
diverged with respect to regulatory control. Gene duplication may drive the modularization of functional network through specialization, thereby disentangling
cellular systems. Earlier observations suggested that
paralogous modules were formed in massive duplication
events. Wapinski et al. found that paralogous modules
were rare even post-WGD and suggested an alternative
mechanism. Many paralogous pairs genetically interact
with each other despite having no shared physical interactions, which may induce a partial division of labor
(subfunctionalization) between two paralogous proteins
that become physically or temporally separated. Such
specialization could modularize a molecular network by
separating links within a network when duplicating a
node. Thus increasing gene copy number may simplify a
system rather than making it more complex. Modularization could relax opposing constraints on a single component and thus set in motion further specialization and
refinement [49]. This report compares functional behaviour at different levels between duplicated genes, and
shows that gene duplication innovates through regulatory divergence.
After duplication of several genes, these can either
migrate in a coordinated manner, resulting in two paralogous classes, or be dispersed into different classes. The
authors expected coordinated migrations after simultaneous duplications. To test this hypothesis, they counted
the number of paralogous gene pairs connecting each
pair of gene classes (transcriptional classes, biochemical
classes, etc.) and found that coordinated migration was
rare. Gene classes (functional regulatory or transcriptional) rarely shared more than one or two paralogous
relations regardless of the overall proportion of retained

Levasseur and Pontarotti Biology Direct 2011, 6:11
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/11

paralogs. The few observed paralog classes are very
small and were formed gradually (from independent
duplications). Thus paralogs dispersed individually.
Subcellular localization shift Marques et al. [67] analyzed the possibility of neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization in subcellular localization. In their studies,
the authors used first a non-evolutionary-based
approach, and then an evolutionary-based one. The first
non evolutionary-based approach hypothesized that
divergent subcellular localization between duplicates was
a consequence of sublocalization (subfunctionalization)
alone. The joint number of different compartments per
protein pair (combining both duplicates) would be
expected to be the same as that of the common ancestral protein. Conversely, the number of compartments
per pair should be higher than that of the progenitor if
neo-localization contributed to sub-cellular diversification. However, sublocalization data for ancestral protein
or for an outgroup were lacking. Thus to assess the contribution of neo- and sublocalization to the functional
diversification of duplicates, the authors used the “He
and Zhang” strategy. They used the average number of
subcellular compartments of yeast singleton gene products as a proxy for the subcellular representation of
WGD duplicate progenitors of yeast duplicates. They
observed that the joint number of distinct compartments per WGD-derived duplicate with distinct cellular
localization was significantly higher than that observed
for singleton proteins. By contrast, there was no difference between the distributions of the number of subcellular compartments for WGD duplicates with the same
subcellular distribution. This suggests that the increase
in the number of compartments observed for the WGDderived pair with distinct cellular localization was due to
neolocalization events among these duplicates. The
authors underline that their conclusions require a
caveat: the types of proteins represented in the WGDderived pair with distinct cellular localization may generally and a priori be present in a larger number of
compartments. To check this, they compared the number of distinct compartments per WGD-derived pair
with distinct cellular localization and singletons for proteins within the same Gene Ontology (GO) classes. This
analysis showed that for all the GO classes tested, the
joint number of compartments per WGD-derived pair
with distinct cellular localization was significantly higher
than that observed for singletons. This suggests that the
elevated number of compartments for D-pairs (WGDderived duplicates with distinct cellular localization)
could be the result of neolocalization and not of a wide
cellular representation of ancestral progenitor proteins,
prior to duplication. They also used an evolutionarybased approach on a few families where the functional
information was available in sister species (K. waltii).

Page 10 of 12

They then constructed the phylogeny for 45 yeast
families, mapped the subcellular localizations of these
onto the phylogenies and finally used a parsimony-based
analysis to deduce the ancestral and derived states
(function). In 16 families, the subcellular localization has
remained fully preserved among members. For the
remaining 29 families, they analyzed changes in protein
location, assuming that the scenario requiring the smallest number of subcellular changes, given the observed
data (parsimony principle), reflected the true pattern of
events. For 16 of the 29 families, they inferred the most
likely scenario of subcellular diversification. Eight
families showed instances of neolocalization. For example, members of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
family, involved in protein degradation, are generally
located in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

Conclusion
In the present review, we have discussed genome evolution via duplication and the mechanisms involved in the
fixation and maintenance of the duplicates. The forces
driving the fates of duplicate genes rely not only on
duplication type (i.e., segmental duplication or whole
genome duplication), but also on several phenomena
(opposing or compensatory) linked to population size,
gene function and gene balance. Commonly, local duplication may be eliminated by passive losses following the
genetic population laws, whereas in the case of whole
genome duplication, duplicates or chromosome losses
are an active, complex biological process resulting from
an equilibrium disturbance in the cell.
To decipher the role and impact of duplication in genome evolution, future works could be usefully reinforced
in the following main directions:
a) The distinction between fixation and maintenance
of duplicates needs to be biologically conceptualized
and mathematically modeled in future studies.
The birth and death process is described as a common mechanism to explain the dynamic of gene
families [54]. Here we propose considering the birth
and death process as a fixation and maintenance
index, fixation being the probability that a duplicate
will spread in a population, and maintenance being
the probability that a duplicate is preserved in the
long term. This distinction enables us to take into
account essential variables such as population size
along with functionality of genes.
b) We are tempted to consider duplication as a primary driving force in the adaptive evolution of genomes, but this “master” mutation still has to be
integrated into an evolutionary context to assess its
importance in genome evolution. Single correlations
between duplicate numbers between families or their

Levasseur and Pontarotti Biology Direct 2011, 6:11
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/11

respective similarities are too scarce to unravel genome evolution, and history of the duplicates has to
be clearly integrated into phylogenetic comparative
methods [68].
In future studies, phylogenetic comparative methods
should be considered as paradigm.

Reviewer’s report 2
Dr. Lutz Walter, German Primate Center, Goettingen,
Germany

This informative review discusses mechanisms and consequences of genome evolution through duplications.
The authors considered both whole genome and segmental duplications. The evolutionary consequences are
discussed and the authors consider favouring as well as
opposing mechanisms to fix and maintain such duplications. I have only a minor point concerning the fixation
and maintenance of duplicates. This is a central point of
the manuscript and, therefore, should deserve more
description than just a few sentences. Examples maybe
helpful for the readers.
Author’s response

We completely agree with the comment of Dr. Walter
about the conceptual distinction between fixation and
maintenance of duplicates. In our opinion, this is an
essential and critical point to be considered in all modern and future studies based on the fates of duplicates
and their role on genomes evolution. In line with the
reviewer’s suggestion, we now describe more deeply the
theoretical and conceptual distinction between each of
the steps leading to the generation of preserved gene
duplicates. In addition, we discuss one example in
which such a distinction is crucial to avoid several
potential sources of error and bias in the estimates of
evolutionary rates of duplication.
