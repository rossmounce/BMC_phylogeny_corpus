Abstract
Background: The aquaporins are a family of integral membrane proteins composed of two
subfamilies: the orthodox aquaporins, which transport only water, and the aquaglyceroporins,
which transport glycerol, urea, or other small solutes. Two recently described aquaporins,
numbers 11 and 12, appear to be more distantly related to the other mammalian aquaporins and
aquaglyceroporins.
Results: We report on the characterization of Aquaporin-11 (AQP11). AQP11 RNA and protein
is found in multiple rat tissues, including kidney, liver, testes and brain. AQP11 has a unique
distribution in brain, appearing in Purkinje cell dendrites, hippocampal neurons of CA1 and CA2,
and cerebral cortical neurons. Immunofluorescent staining of Purkinje cells indicates that AQP11
is intracellular. Unlike other aquaporins, Xenopus oocytes expressing AQP11 in the plasma
membrane failed to transport water, glycerol, urea, or ions.
Conclusion: AQP11 is functionally distinct from other proteins of the aquaporin superfamily and
could represent a new aquaporin subfamily. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of
AQP11 in the brain.

Background
The aquaporins (AQP), also known as the major intrinsic
protein superfamily (MIP), are a family of integral membrane proteins. In mammals, 13 aquaporins were
described (AQP0 – AQP12). There are two subfamilies:
the aquaporins, which transport only water, and the
aquaglyceroporins, which transport glycerol, urea, and
other small solutes in addition to water [1]. An exception
is AQP6, which is permeated by anions [2]. Aquaporins

and aquaglyceroporins are present throughout the body,
including in the plasma membrane of renal epithelia,
brain astrocytes, and red blood cells [3].
Here we focus on AQP11, a protein with lower homology
to previously characterized aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. AQP11 was previously described in mice [4],
although the authors were unable to measure solute transport. We aimed to establish the tissue distribution of rat

human AQP11.

Results and discussion
Cloning and sequence analysis of AQP11
Searching the human genome using Psi-BLAST, we found
two genes with sequences related to members of the
aquaporin gene family (also known as the MIP superfamily). Both were also present in rat and mouse

genomes. These genes were previously annotated as
AQP11 and AQP12 (GenBank: NP_766627 and GenBank: NP_945349). A search for conserved domains [5]
revealed a significant alignment with MIP domain, a feature of all aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. Mouse
AQP12 is expressed in pancreas; transport studies were
inconclusive because tagged AQP12 failed to traffic to the
surface of Xenopus oocytes [6]. During preparation of this
manuscript, Morishita and colleagues published a report

TIP1.1 is a water-selective channel, but TIP5.1 has not been characterized; human and rat AQP6 are ion and water channels,
but mouse AQP6 has not been characterized.

AQP11, and 92% similar and 83% identical to mouse
AQP11 (mouse and rat AQP11 are 98% similar and 93%
identical). AQP11 is 24–33% similar (28% on average),
and approximately 10% identical, to the previously characterized mammalian aquaporins (AQP0 – 10), but 41%
similar and 23% identical to AQP12. AQP11 is most similar to AQP12, and least similar to AQP4 and AQP7
(24%). AQP11 and AQP12 are similar to non-mammalian aquaporins present in plant Arabidopsis thaliana (SIPs,
~28%), puffer-fish Tetraodon nigroviridis (44%), mosquito
Anopheles gambiae and fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster
(40%), and nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and C.
briggsae (~37%). In addition to mouse and rat, human
AQP11 has homologous putative genes in the dingo Canis
familiaris (gene LOC476798) and in the chicken Gallus
gallus (gene LOC426725). Sequence alignments and analysis of the phylogenetic tree suggest that AQP11 and 12
are distinct from the known mammalian aquaporins and
aquaglyceroporins (Figure 1) and may comprise a new
MIP subfamily (Figure 2).
Compared to other mammalian aquaporins, AQP11 has
several unique attributes (Figure 3). The two Asn-Pro-Ala
motifs of the aquaporin superfamily are present, although

the first contains a cysteine instead of an alanine. Following the second Asn-Pro-Ala, AQP11 has a leucine, where
all other mammalian aquaporins have an arginine. Based
on the high-resolution structures of AQP0, AQP1, GlpF,
and AQPZ [7-10], this leucine is one of four residues
which form the selectivity filter, the narrowest region of
the monomeric pore. In the region of the pore leading
from the constriction point to the cytoplasm, the other
aquaporins have Ser-Gly-(Ala/Gly)-His. AQP11 has ValGly-Thr-Ser. The histidine (serine in AQP11) is conserved
in all other mammalian aquaporins. Similarly, the region
of the pore leading to the outside of the membrane is not
conserved in AQP11. AQP11 contains a bulky, aromatic
phenylalanine, where the other aquaporins have a
methionine, isoleucine, leucine, or valine. These changes
may have a significant impact on solute transport. Based
on this sequence alignment, the polarity and size of the
constriction region of AQP11 is quite different from the
other aquaporins. In addition, the change in amino acids
lining the pore could greatly limit the size and/or charge
of solutes transported by AQP11. Because the similarity to
other aquaporins for which there is a high-resolution
structure is so low, we were unable to use homology modeling to predict the 3-dimensional structure of AQP11.

and treated with membrane impermeable biotin, then precipitated with streptavidin. Surface proteins eluted from the streptavidin (S) and cytosolic proteins from the supernatant (C) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against AQP11 and actin. As a control, cells transfected with AQP11 were precipitated with streptavidin but not
incubated with biotin. (E) Western blot of multiple rat tissue probed with AQP11 antibody (upper panel). The bottom panel
was probed with the same antibody preincubated with antigenic peptide. (F) Sucrose density sedimentation of AQP11 from rat

by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for either AQP4 or AQP11. Fraction 1 corresponds to the lightest fraction, 23 to
the heaviest. Molecular size in kDa is shown.

AQP11 mRNA expression in rat tissues
We probed a rat multiple-tissue Northern blot for AQP11
(Figure 4A). The rat AQP11 predicted open reading frame
is 816 nucleotides, coding for 271 amino acids. We found
prominent bands, between 1.5 and 2 kilobases (kb), in
testes, liver, kidney and brain. The bands in kidney and
liver were slightly smaller than the bands in testes and
brain. These tissues also had bands above 4.5 kb, as did
spleen and heart.

RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of mRNA encoding AQP11 in a range of rat tissues (Figure 4B). In agree-

ment with our Northern blot, we found AQP11 message
in brain cerebrum, in the renal cortex, and in testis. We
also detected AQP11 in the intestinal tract from duodenum to ileum, and weaker expression in choroid plexus,
cerebellum, colon and liver. Since this RT-PCR was not
quantitative, it is impossible to infer relative message
abundance. In microisolated renal structures, we found
mRNA only in proximal tubules and not in glomeruli,
thin limbs of the medulla, thick ascending limbs of the
medulla and cortex, distal convoluted tubules, or in collecting ducts (Figure 4B, bottom panel). This is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating AQP11

but not in distal tubule [4].
Characterization of anti-AQP11 antibodies in cultured
cells
To elucidate AQP11 protein distribution, we generated
antibodies against the C-terminus and N-terminus of rat
AQP11. We transiently transfected cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO) with rat AQP11 and stained them
with our C-term antibody (Figure 5A–C). We saw predominantly intracellular staining and some staining at the
plasma membrane, and no staining in cells transfected
with empty vector. AQP11 immunoblots of surface biotinylated CHO cell lysates confirmed that AQP11 is present
at both the plasma membrane and in the cytosol in transfected CHO cells (Figure 5D). We saw no bands in cells
transfected with empty vector or in cells transfected with
Aquaporin-4, demonstrating the specificity of our C-term
antibody. We obtained similar results in transiently transfected MDCK and HEK293 cells using both N-term and Cterm antibodies (not shown).
AQP11 protein expression in rat tissues
Based on amino acid composition, the estimated molecular weight of rat AQP11 is 30 kDa. An anti-AQP11 C-term

immunoblot of multiple rat tissue membrane proteins
revealed two prominent bands: an approximately 32 kDa
band in brain, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle; and an
approximately 25 kDa band in testes, kidney, and liver
(Figure 5E upper panel, calculated based on migration
distance vs. markers of known size; similar results were
obtained with the N-term antibody, not shown). De-glycosylation (PNGase treatment) or de-phosphorylation
(lambda protein phosphatase treatment) assays did not
produce changes in protein migration patterns (not
shown). As a control, we also probed total protein lysate
from cultured HEK293 cells transfected with rat AQP11.
This produced only the 25 kDa band. Both bands disappeared when the antibody was preadsorbed to the antigenic peptide (Figure 5E, lower panel). There appears to
be no correlation between the transcript size (Northern
blot) and the protein size (immunoblot), as the testes
contain a larger band in the Northern blot (2 kb) but a
smaller band in the Western blot.
Our results demonstrate rat AQP11 RNA and protein are
found in testis, kidney, liver, and brain. We failed to detect
AQP11 RNA in skeletal muscle and heart (Northern blot,
Figure 4A), although Western blot of these tissues was
positive (Figure 5E). Since RNA loading was normalized

Expression
Expression of AQP11 in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were injected with rat AQP11 cRNA (A, B), myc-tagged human
AQP11 (D), or water (C, E) and stained with an antibody against rat AQP11 (A, C), with the antibody preadsorbed to antigenic
peptide (B), or with an antibody against myc (D, E). Scale bars represent 100 µm. (F) Immunoblots of total protein from
oocytes injected with rat AQP11 (AQP11), myc-tagged human AQP11 (myc-AQP11) or water (control). Blots were probed

against β-actin hybridization signal (not shown), this discrepancy could be due to low levels of AQP11 RNA in
these tissues.
Biochemical and structural evidence shows that many
mammalian aquaporins form tetramers [7-9,11]. We subjected rat brain hemisphere membrane proteins to sucrose
density ultra-centrifugation and found that AQP11 sediments in similar fractions as AQP4, a water channel
known to form tetramers (Figure 5F). In agreement with
previous work, we detected AQP4 in fractions 10–23, with
a peak in fractions 13–15 [11]. AQP11 was found in fractions 8–19, with a peak in fractions 11–13. This distribution overlaps significantly, though not perfectly.
Regardless, the first several fractions lack AQP11, and it is
in these fractions where we would expect to find an
AQP11 monomer. We conclude that AQP11, like AQP4,

exists in rat brain as a multi-subunit oligomer – presumably a tetramer like AQP4 and other aquaporins.
Functional expression of AQP11 in xenopus Oocytes
We injected oocytes with human AQP11, myc-tagged
human AQP11, or rat AQP11 and confirmed surface
expression of the second two proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy and by immunoblot (Figure 6). Using
an oocyte swelling assay, we tested AQP11-injected
oocytes for transport of water, glycerol, or urea (Table 1).
Compared to controls, oocytes injected with 5 ng or 25 ng
of human wildtype or myc-tagged AQP11 cRNA showed
no increase in the rate of water transport. Rate of water
transport was significantly less than in oocytes expressing
an orthodox water channel, such as human AQP1 or rat
AQP2 (control = 16.88 ± 6.65; myc-human AQP11 =
15.32 ± 5.64; AQP1 = 263.92 ± 42.22). Additionally, we

failed to detect transport of glycerol or urea in AQP11injected oocytes. Rate of glycerol and urea transport was
similar to control oocytes, and significantly less than in
oocytes expressing rat AQP9, an aquaglyceroporin that
transports glycerol and urea (glycerol: human AQP11 =
0.79 ± 1.27, AQP9 = 11.84 ± 4.69; urea: human AQP11 =
0.03 ± 0.24, AQP9 = 11.14 ± 5.17).
Solute transport through other aquaporins, such as AQP3
and AQP6, is affected by pH [2,12]. Lack of solute transport by AQP11-injected oocytes, however, was unaffected
by raising the pH to 8.5, or by lowering the pH to 6 or 4.5
(Table 2). Incubating the oocytes with HgCl2 did not alter
the water, glycerol, or urea permeability of AQP11injected oocytes, although it did inhibit water transport in
AQP2-injected oocytes and glycerol and urea transport in
AQP9-injected oocytes (Table 1). We also failed to see a
change in ion conductance in oocytes expressing AQP11
(Table 1). Oocytes injected with AQP6, however, showed
an appreciable increase in conductance compared to
water injected oocytes. At pH 4.5, AQP11 injected oocytes
showed no significant difference in ion conductance versus water injected control oocytes (Table 2). Similar
results occurred at pH 8.5 (Table 2), whereas AQP6
injected oocytes displayed conductance values almost five
times higher than oocytes injected with rat or human
AQP11 or with water (control = 4.7 ± 1.4, human AQP11
= 5.7 ± 2.8, rat AQP11 = 5.1 ± 1.1, AQP6 = 23 ± 2.6).

Based on these oocyte studies, we conclude that under
these conditions AQP11 does not transport water, glycerol, urea, or ions. It is possible that a putative AQP11
channel is closed unless a ligand or other regulatory molecule is present. It is also possible that AQP11 does not act
as a solute channel in vivo. Like AQP0, a poor water channel that forms membrane junctions in the lens of the eye
[9,13], the role of AQP11 may be primarily structural. It is
also possible that AQP11 transports a different, untested
solute, such as ammonium, CO2, or NO2. Finally, it is
possible that AQP11 is not functional when expressed in
oocytes. If true, this would be the first aquaporin that fails
to function when expressed in oocytes.
A previous study reported that exogenous mouse AQP11
was not targeted to the plasma membrane in oocytes [4].
This conflicts with our observations using rat AQP11. This
discrepancy could be due to the amino acid differences
between rat and mouse AQP11. Alternatively, it could be
because the previous study utilized AQP11 tagged with
GFP or V5. These tags may alter AQP11 localization in
oocytes.
AQP11 in rat brain
To further elucidate the location of AQP11 in rat brain, we
stained rat brain sections with AQP11 N-term antibody.
We found staining primarily in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (Figure 7). In the cerebellum,

AQP11 immunoreactivity was associated with the dendrites of Purkinje cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy
revealed punctate labeling, indicative of intracellular
localization (Figure 7E). In the hippocampus, AQP11
positive neurons were found in the CA1 and CA2. In cerebral cortex, staining was absent in cortical layer I, but
present in layers II-VI. We failed to see strong staining in
other areas of the brain, such as in the thalamus or near
the ventricles. Similar staining was obtained with anti-Cterminal AQP11 antibodies (not shown). Future studies
using electron miscroscopy are necessary to more definitively assess the cellular localization of AQP11.
A previous study demonstrated AQP11 protein expression
in mouse kidney [4]; using our AQP11 antibodies we were
unable to see staining in rat kidney (not shown). The
authors of the previous study did not stain brain sections,
but they did note that mice lacking AQP11 began dying
15 days after birth, with renal failure and polycystic kidneys [4]. One explanation for the discrepancy might be
due to differences in AQP11 localization in mouse versus
rat kidney. In rat kidney, perhaps the termini of AQP11
are not accessible for antibody interaction.
AQP11 localization in the brain is different from the other
brain aquaporins. AQP4 is restricted to astrocytes
throughout the brain, while AQP1 is present in the
choroid plexus [14]. AQP9 is present in astrocytes [15] as
well as in a population of catecholaminergic neurons
[16]. The apparent intracellular localization of AQP11 in
Purkinje cells is unusual. Only AQP6 is predominantly
intracellular in vivo. The unique distribution and the
apparent lack of water/solute transport by AQP11 may
predict a unique function.

Conclusion
We describe rat AQP11, an aquaporin with lower similarity to known mammalian aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. AQP11, along with AQP12, may comprise a new
aquaporin subfamily. Unlike other aquaporins, we were
unable to demonstrate transport of water, glycerol, urea,
or ions by AQP11. This is likely due to putative pore-lining residues that are not conserved between AQP11 and
other mammalian aquaporins. AQP11 is expressed in a
variety of rat tissues. In the brain, AQP11 is found in
Purkinje cells, hippocampal neurons of CA1 and CA2,
and cerebral cortical neurons. Future studies are necessary
to elucidate the physiological role of AQP11 in the brain.

Methods
Cloning and sequence alignment
AQP11 was found using a Psi-BLAST search of GenBank
with the BLOSUM62 matrix. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree generation was performed
using ClustalX 1.81 and the Gonnett series matrix [17].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/14

The open reading frame of human AQP11 was amplified
from human colon cDNA library (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) using primers 5'AQP11A (5'-GGCGACGAATTCATGTCGCCGCTGCTGGGGCTC-3') and 3'AQP11 (5'TCTTTGTCTAGATTATTCCTTTTTATTAATTGTATG-3').
The open reading frame of rat AQP11 was cloned from
testicle poly(A) RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) using OneStep
RT-PCR (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and primers rQ11EcoRI
(5'-ATGCGAATTCATGTCCGCGCTACTGGGGCT-3') and
rQ11XbaI
(5'-ATCGTCTAGATCATTCCTTCTTGTTACTCA-3'). Rat AQP11 was cloned into pcDNA3.1Zeo
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or pcDNA3.1Zeo-myc for
expression in mammalian cells, and into pXBG for transcription of cRNA [18], using standard PCR cloning techniques. All cloning was performed by introducing EcoRI
and XbaI restriction enzyme sites (underlined) into the
primers. All clones were verified by both restriction digest
and sequencing from both ends of the multiple cloning
site.
RNA purification and RT-PCR
Adult male Wistar rats (250–400 g) from M&B (Eiby,
Denmark) had free access to water and pelleted food. The
animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation before
removing various organs and sacrificing the animals.
Organs were rinsed in a 4°C saline solution, and kidneys
were further divided into samples of cortex (Ctx, with
outer stripe of outer medulla), inner stripe of outer
medulla (ISOM), and inner medulla (IM). The different
segments of the renal tubular system were isolated by an
enzymatic method. After perfusing the renal artery with
cold saline, kidneys were removed and cut into thin slices.
Ctx and IM were separated from ISOM using fine razor
blades and each incubated separately 30 min at 37°C, in
conical flasks containing 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) and 2 mg/ml Dispase (Invitrogen, Taastrup, DK) in oxygenated K+/gluconate solution (in mM:
10.0 Na+, 140.0 K+, 10.0 Ca2+, 1.0 Mg2+, 32.0 Cl-, 140.0
Gluconate-, 10.0 HEPES, 10.0 Sucrose, pH 7.4) while gently shaking at 80 RPM. After wash, the tissues were agitated mildly in enzyme-free chilled buffer, and individual
tubules collected by suction into loading-pipettes under a
dissection microscope. For inclusion into the study, proximal convoluted tubules (PCT), proximal straight tubules
(PST), and thin descending limbs of the outer medulla
(OMThL) were all AQP1 positive and PCT was NBCe1
positive, inner medullary thin limbs (IMThL) were AQP1
and CLC-2 positive, medullary thick ascending limbs
(mTAL) and cortical thick ascending limbs (cTAL) were
NKCC2 positive, distal convoluted tulbules (DCT) were
TSC positive, and collecting ducts from the cortex (CCD),
outer medulla (OMCD), and the inner medulla (IMCD)
were all AQP2 positive by RT-PCR.

Total RNA was purified from rat tissues using RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen). After DNAse treatment (RQ DNaseI,
Promega, Ramcon, Denmark), total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Tåstrup,
Denmark). PCR was performed for 30 cycles using
sequence specific sense (5'-ATCCCTAGCGGTGAGGGAAC-3') and antisense oligonucleotide primers (5'CACTGACTTCGTTTGAGTCTTTGG-3') with HotStarTaq
Master Mix (Qiagen). Negative PCR controls included
omission of reverse transcriptase or omission of cDNA.
PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (2% agarose) and photographed under ultraviolet illumination. Kidney cortex PCR products were sequenced to
confirm specificity (Lark Technologies, Essex, UK).
Northern blot
Using PCR, base pairs 224–615 of the rat AQP11 open
reading frame was subcloned into pSPT19 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Vector was linearized using EcoRI (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and transcription was performed using the Strip EZ RNA kit (Ambion) using T7
Polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England) according to the manufacterer's protocol.
Rat Multi-Tissue Northern Blot (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA) was prehybridized for 1.5 hours at 68° in ULTRAhyb, then probed using 106 cpm/ml probe at 68° overnight in a rotating oven. Blot was washed twice for 20
minutes at room temperature using low stringency wash
solution, and twice for 20 minutes at 68° using high stringency wash solution. Hybridization and wash solutions
were from NorthernMax kit (Ambion).
Aquaporin-11 antibodies
Polyclonal AQP11 antibodies were raised in rabbit (Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA) against a peptide corresponding to
amino acids 259 – 271 (C-term) or amino acids 1 to 14
(N-term) of rat AQP11 (NH2-(C)PWLHNNQLSNKKECOOH or NH2-MSALLGLPPEVQDT(C)-COOH, synthesized by Lofstrand, Gaithersburg, MD). Cysteines (in
brackets) were added to ease the affinity purification using
a column bound antigenic peptide (Pierce, Rockford, IL).
Western blot
Rat tissue
Protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee. 6
month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by
asphyxiation using CO2. Tissues were harvested and
placed in PBS plus Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche)
on ice, homogenized for 20 strokes in a drill press, then
spun at 1000 g for 10 minutes. All centrifugation steps
were performed at 4°. Supernatant was spun at 200,000 g
for 1 hour. Membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 3% SDS and solubilized at 37° for 1
hour. Protein concentration was determined using BCA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/14

Protein Assay (Pierce). Protein was diluted to contain
10% glycerol, 1% bromophenol blue and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. 30 µg membrane protein was run on 12% SDSPAGE, transferred to Immun-Blot PVDF membrane (BioRad), and probed overnight at 4° with rabbit anti-rat
AQP11 antibody diluted 1:1000 in 4% BSA, 0.05%
Tween-20, 1 mM NaN3 in PBS. Blots were washed and
probed with donkey anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham) for 1 hour at room temperature
and visualized using ECL Plus (Amersham). When noted,
blots were stripped in 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2%
SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.7 at 50° for 30 minutes.
Cultured cells
Transient tranfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Invitrogen). Two days following transfection, cells were
homogenized in PBS with protease inhibitor as above.
Membrane proteins were harvested, solubilized, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as
above.
Xenopus Oocytes
Three days after injection 10 oocytes per condition were
mixed with 150 µl of 7.5 mM sodium phosphate and
Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche). Oocytes were lysed
by vigorous pipetting, then spun at 3000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge for 5 minutes at 4°. Supernatant was combined with sample buffer such that the final concentration
was 3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH
6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% bromophenol blue and incubated
for 30 minutes at 37°. 10 µl was subjected to SDS-PAGE
followed by immunoblotting as above.
Sucrose density ultracentrifugation
One rat brain hemisphere (from 7–8 week old SpragueDawley rat, Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) membrane
protein preparation was solubilized in 1 ml 4% deoxycholate (DOC) in PBS for 1 hour at 37°. 300 µl was combined
with 100 µl 20% sucrose and layered onto a 5–20% linear
sucrose gradient in 0.2% DOC in PBS. Sample was spun
at 139000 g for 16 hours at 10°. 200 µl fractions were
carefully aspirated from top to bottom, subjected to SDSPAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to AQP4
(Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) or to
AQP11 C-term.
Solute Transport and ion conductance of Oocytes
Oocytes from Xenopus laevis frogs were harvested as
described [18]. cRNA was transcribed as described [18].
Water, glycerol, and urea transport was measured as
described, 2–3 days after injection [19].

Whole-cell currents of oocytes were measured two days
after injection using a standard two-electrode voltage

clamp amplifier (OC-725, Warner Instruments, Hamden,
CT) with micropipettes of 0.5-3-MΩ resistance filled with
3 M KCl. The recordings were performed in solution containing 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM
Na-HEPES (pH 7.5). Current and voltage data were
acquired and analyzed with DIGIDATA 1200 and pClamp
6 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The
membrane potential was held at -50 mV and stepped to
values between -100 mV to +60 mV for 300 ms. Conductances were calculated from slopes of Current-Voltage
curves between -80 mV and +20 mV. Only healthy oocytes
with resting potentials of ≤-20 mV were used.
Immunocytochemistry
Oocytes
2–3 days after injection, Xenopus oocytes were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Oocytes
were washed several times in PBS, then fixed in methanol
overnight at -20°. Oocytes were washed in PBS, then incubated in 100 mM NaBH4 for 2 hours or overnight at room
temperature. Oocytes were bisected using a razor blade,
washed in PBS, then incubated overnight at 4° with rabbit
anti-rat AQP11 antibody diluted 1:200 in 2% BSA in PBS.
For peptide control, antibody was pre-incubated with 25
µg antigenic peptide in 1 ml for 30 minutes on ice.
Oocytes were washed in PBS, then incubated overnight at
4° with donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 secondary antibody
(Invitrogen) diluted 1:1000 in 2% BSA in PBS. Oocytes
were washed in PBS, then mounted on medium thick
hanging drop slides (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH)
using Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham,
Alabama). All slides were examined using an LSM510
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NJ).
MDCK, HEK293 and CHO cells
Culture cells were split onto culture slides (poly-D-lysine
coated for HEK293 cells) and transfected as above. Two
days after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10–20 minutes
at room temperature. Cells were blocked and permeabilized in 3% BSA, 1% donkey serum (Sigma), 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature, and incubated
overnight at 4° with rabbit anti-rat AQP11 antibody. After
wash, cells were incubated at room temperature with donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 secondary antibody, washed
extensively in PBS, and mounted with anti-fade reagent.
All antibodies were diluted in blocking solution lacking
Triton X-100.
Immunohistochemistry
Rat brains were fixed by perfusion via the left heart ventricle, with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer, pH 7.4. The tissues were dehydrated, embedded in
paraffin, and 2-µm sections were cut using a rotary micro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/14

tome (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). The sections were
dewaxed, rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase was
blocked by 0.5% H2O2 in absolute methanol. The sections
were boiled in 10 mM Tris, pH 9, supplemented with 0.5
mM EGTA, and then incubated with 50 mM NH4Cl and
blocked in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA, 0.05%
saponin, and 0.2% gelatin. The sections were incubated
overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies diluted in
PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100.
For brightfield microscopy, the sections were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) in PBS with BSA and Triton X-100. The staining was visualized by 0.05%
3,3'diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dissolved in
PBS with 0.1% H2O2. Mayer's hematoxylin was used for
counterstaining, and the sections were dehydrated in
graded alcohol and xylene and mounted in hydrophobic
Eukitt mounting medium (O. Kindler, Freiburg, Germany). For fluorescence microscopy, AQP11 labeling was
visualized using an Alexa 488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Sections were mounted
with a coverslip in Glycergel Antifade Medium (Dako).
