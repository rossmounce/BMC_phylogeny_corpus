Abstract
Background: HIV-1 is one of the fastest evolving pathogens, and is distinguished by geographic and genetic
variants that have been classified into different subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). Early in
infection the primary coreceptor is CCR5, but during disease course CXCR4-using HIV-1 populations may emerge.
This has been correlated with accelerated disease progression in HIV-1 subtype B. Basic knowledge of HIV-1
coreceptor tropism is important due to the recent introduction of coreceptor antagonists in antiretroviral therapy,
and subtype-specific differences regarding how frequently HIV-1 CXCR4-using populations appear in late-stage
disease need to be further investigated. To study how frequently CXCR4-using populations appear in late-stage
disease among HIV-1 subtype A and CRF02_AG, we evaluated the accuracy of a recombinant virus phenotypic
assay for these subtypes, and used it to determine the HIV-1 coreceptor tropism of plasma samples collected
during late-stage disease in Guinea-Bissau. We also performed a genotypic analysis and investigated subtypespecific differences in the appearance of CXCR4 tropism late in disease.
Results: We found that the recombinant virus phenotypic assay accurately predicted HIV-1 coreceptor tropism of
subtype A and CRF02_AG. Over the study period (1997-2007), we found an increasing and generally high
frequency of CXCR4 tropism (86%) in CRF02_AG. By sequence analysis of the V3 region of our samples we
developed a novel genotypic rule for predicting CXCR4 tropism in CRF02_AG, based on the combined criteria of
the total number of charged amino acids and net charge. This rule had higher sensitivity than previously described
genotypic rules and may be useful for development of future genotypic tools for this CRF. Finally, we conducted a
literature analysis, combining data of 498 individuals in late-stage disease, and found high amounts of CXCR4
tropism for all major HIV-1 subtypes (60-77%), except for subtype C (15%).
Conclusions: The increase in CXCR4 tropism over time suggests an evolving epidemic of CRF02_AG. The results of
the literature analysis demonstrate the need for further studies investigating subtype-specific emergence for
CXCR4-tropism; this may be particularly important due to the introduction of CCR5-antagonists in HIV treatment
regimens.

Background
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolves
at an extremely high rate, primarily due to a combination of high viral turn-over, an error prone viral reverse
transcriptase and frequent recombination. This high
level of molecular evolution has led to diversification of

HIV-1 into genetically distinct subtypes (A-D, F-H, J-K),
subsubtypes (A1-A3, F1-F2) and circulating recombinants forms (CRFs), usually defined by geographical
location [1]. The most common subtypes are subtype A
(12.3% of the global prevalence), B (10.2%), C (49.9%)
and G (6.3%), and the CRF01_AE (4.7%) and
CRF02_AG (4.8%) [1].
HIV-1 enters target cells via interactions with CD4
and a coreceptor, usually one of the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4. Different HIV strains have been

classified based on coreceptor tropism: CCR5-tropic
strains are referred to as R5, CXCR4-tropic strains as
X4, and dual tropic strains as R5X4 [2]. Coreceptor use
has been studied extensively in HIV-1 subtype B and C,
but needs further investigation for other subtypes
[3-13]. In subtype B, R5 populations are generally present over the entire course of infection whereas R5X4
or X4 populations emerge late in infection. This coreceptor switch has been associated with faster CD4+ T
cell decline and the development of AIDS, although studies describing the opposite, or no difference in CD4+
T cell decline have also been observed [5,6].
Little is known about subtype-specific differences
regarding how frequently CXCR4-using populations
appear in late-stage disease. Most studies investigating
HIV-1 subtype B coreceptor tropism have focused on
either the relation between the detection of X4 viruses
and disease progression rate, or molecular properties
that differ between the R5 and X4 viruses [5,6,14,15].
HIV-1 CXCR4-using populations are thought to appear
in approximately 50% of the patients infected with subtype B [16-18]. The fraction of subtype C-infected individuals that have CXCR4-using populations appear to
be less frequent (0-30%) [8,9,11,19]. Moreover, a study
of HIV-1 CRF01_AE in 22 AIDS patients showed that
16 subjects (73%) had X4 populations [12]. Comparing
the A and D subtypes, Kaleebu et al. found no significant difference in patients with low CD4 counts (≤ 200)
[3]. When a comparison was done at an earlier stage of
HIV-1 infection (CD4 counts > 200), CXCR4 use was
more frequent among patients with subtype D infection,
probably due to an earlier coreceptor switch than in
patients infected with subtype A [3]. Other cross-sectional studies do not allow estimation of the emergence
of HIV-1 with X4 phenotype since CD4 counts or clinical statuses were not considered together [20-22].
The viral envelope glycoprotein (gp) 120 is organized
in five hypervariable regions (V1-V5), interspersed
within five conserved regions (C1-C5). The major viral
determinants of the interaction between gp120 and the
coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 are located in the V3
region, even though other regions, such as the V1/V2
and the C4 regions have been shown to influence coreceptor use [23,24]. To date, most studies have focused
on HIV-1 subtype B and C, and there is no clear evidence that the V3 region has the same impact on coreceptor interaction among other subtypes.
Basic knowledge of HIV-1 coreceptor evolution has
become increasingly important due to the recent introduction of CCR5 antagonists as part of antiretroviral
therapy against HIV-1 [25,26]. Since these drugs have
no effect on X4 populations, HIV-1 coreceptor tropism
must be identified before the initiation of treatment
[27,28]. The gold standard for clinical samples is

coreceptor determination by recombinant phenotypic
entry assays [29,30]. Reliable bioinformatic tools based
on viral genotype may be a faster and more cost-effective way to predict coreceptor tropism. Present genotypic predictors are based on V3 sequences from subtype
B or C, and have been shown to perform poorly on
other subtypes, especially in detecting CXCR4-using variants [31,32]. This indicates that molecular differences
connected to coreceptor use may be subtype-specific,
and that specific predictors likely have to be constructed
for each major subtype and CRF.
In view of this, we set out to determine the frequency
of emergence of X4 phenotype in HIV-1 subtype A or
CRF02_AG infected individuals in late-stage disease by
evaluating the performance of a recombinant virus phenotypic assay for subtype A and CRF02_AG. Using this
tool, we found an increasing and generally high frequency of CXCR4 tropism (86%) in CRF02_AG, and
developed a novel genotypic rule for predicting CXCR4
tropism, based on combined criteria of the total number
of charged amino acids and net charge of the V3 region.
Finally, we compared our results to other HIV-1 subtypes by analyzing HIV-1 coreceptor phenotype in individuals in late-stage disease and found high amounts of
CXCR4 tropism for all major HIV-1 subtypes (60-77%),
except for subtype C (15%).

Methods
Sample sets

Two sample sets were used in the present study. The first
sample set consisted of a control panel of 11 HIV-1 isolates with predetermined subtype and coreceptor tropism.
Subtype was determined by sequencing of the env V3
region, and coreceptor tropism was determined using a
phenotypic infection assay with either the U87.CD4CCR5/U87.CD4-CXCR4 cell system or the MT-2 cell system [22]. Data were generously provided by Professor Jan
Albert, Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control,
Stockholm, Sweden. All isolates were amplified,
sequenced, and used for evaluation of the recombinant
virus phenotypic assay. Three isolates (22480, 22627, and
30405) were also used in the genotypic analysis of HIV-1
CRF02_AG. Details of the control panel can be found in
Table 1. The second sample set consisted of 33 plasma
samples from 33 HIV-1 infected individuals and was
selected from a cohort of police officers from Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, based on sample availability and disease
status. The cohort has been described in detail elsewhere
[33-35]. Twenty-nine of the samples were successfully
amplified and subjected to further analyses. All of the individuals were treatment naïve and classified to be in latestage disease, as defined by CD4+ T cell count (≤ 200
cells/μl or ≤ 14%) or clinical AIDS (CDC: C or WHO: 4)
[36,37]. In cases where more than one sample from

late-stage disease was available, the last sample was chosen. Individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis and clinically
categorized as CDC: C, but without other AIDS-defining
symptoms, were not included in the study. For patient
samples DL2713H, DL2846I and DL3018H, there were no
recorded CD4+ T cell counts. These samples were
included in the study based on previous observations of
CD4+ T cell counts of the same patient, according to the
described criterions. Details of the plasma samples from
Guinea-Bissau can be found in Table 2.
Amplification and sequencing

Viral RNA was extracted and purified from blood
plasma samples, using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Stockholm, Sweden) with minor modifications
from the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 200 μl of
blood plasma were disrupted in 2000 μl Qiazol and
10 μg Carrier RNA (Qiagen). The aqueous phase was
loaded onto a spin column by multiple loading steps.
RNA was eluted in 40 μl of RNase-free water and treated with DNase I (Fermentas, Helsingborg, Sweden).
Viral RNA was reverse transcribed using gene-specific
primers, and the V1-V3 region amplified using a nested
PCR approach (The SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR
System with Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase and Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity, Invitrogen,
Copenhagen, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using primers JE12F (5’-AAAGAGCAGAAGATAGTGGCAATGA-3’) and V3A_R2 (5’-TTACAATAGAAAAATTCTCCTCYACA-3’) for one-step
RT-PCR and E20A_F (5’-GGGCTACACATGCCTGTGTACCYACAG-3’) and JA169 for nested PCR [38]. The
V3 region with flanking regions (nucleotides 6847 to
7374 in HXB2; GenBank accession number K03455)
were then directly sequenced using BigDye Terminator

v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Stockholm, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using primers JA167 and JA169 [38]. The V3
region was chosen for sequencing due to prevalence of
length variations in the V1-V2 region. Sequences were
determined using ABI Prism 3100 (Applied Biosystems).
Sample DL2846I had to be cloned as a result of too
mixed chromatograms. The amplified V1-V3 region of
approximately 940 base pairs (nucleotides 6430 to 7374
in HXB2; GenBank accession number K03455) were
cloned using the InsTAclone cloning system (Fermentas) and TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). Twelve colonies were
picked and the cloned fragments were amplified with
Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) using conventional M13 primers (-20 and -24). The
amplifications were successful for eight colonies, and
clones were named with the patient identification number and a clone number. Individual clones were purified
and sequenced as described.
Phylogenetic analysis

Sequences were assembled, and contigs were analyzed
with CodonCode Aligner version 1.5.2 (CodonCode
Corporation, Dedham, USA) blinded to the phenotype.
True permutated positions were detected by the software, and manually inspected. All sequences had open
reading frames and were subjected for further analysis.
A multiple alignment of our sequences with a reference
sequence data set of all major subtypes, sub-subtypes
and CRFs (downloaded from Los Alamos Sequence
Database) was performed in MEGA4 using the Clustal
algorithm [39-41]. Nucleotide sequences were aligned
via protein sequences and major gap positions were
removed to a final sequence length of 463 base pairs. A
neighbor-joining (N-J) tree was constructed in MEGA4
using pair-wise deletion in a maximum composite likelihood substitution model with heterogeneous pattern
among lineages with a gamma distribution of 0.8338
(Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), calculated by
Modeltest [42]). The phylogenetic reconstruction was
bootstrapped 1000 times to separate sequences of different subtypes. The gp120 V3 region of CRF02_AG is
subtype A-derived, and separation of subclusters belonging to either CRF02_AG or subtype A were not possible
in this tree. To further characterize these sequences, we
constructed a reference data set consisting of sequences
characterized as subtype A or CRF02_AG. To avoid any
bias of previously incorrect subtyping due to similarities
in the V3 region between subtype A and CRF02_AG,
only HIV-1 full genome (> 8000 bp) sequences were
allowed. We reconstructed an N-J tree with our GuineaBissau-derived sequences and the described reference
sequences as outlined above. Reference sequences that
formed separate monophyletic clusters were removed

Since Felsenstein’s bootstrap test can be too conservative, we used the bootstrap interior branch test, with
1000 bootstraps, which is a mathematically more rigorous statistical method for phylogenetic reconstructions
of closely related sequences [43-45]. Details and accession numbers of the constructed reference sequence
data set can be found in Additional file 1.
Determination of coreceptor tropism and evaluation of
phenotypic method

Human kidney embryonic 293T cells and human glioma
U87.CD4 cells, stably expressing CD4 and one of the

chemokine receptors (CCR5 or CXCR4) were maintained as previously described [46,47]. Chimeric viruses
with patient-specific V1-V3 regions were generated
based on the protocol from the Tropism Recombinant
Test (TRT) with minor modifications [15,29]. Briefly,
500 ng of amplified V1-V3 fragments from each plasma
sample and 3 μg of 43XCΔV, a NheI-linearized vector
containing a full-length pNL4-3 genome with the V1-V3
region deleted, were transfected into 293T cells using
the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Chimeric
viruses were harvested and stored at -80°C. Twenty-four
hours before infection, 10 5 U87.CD4 cells/well were
seeded in 48 well plates. For infection, 500 μl of chimeric viruses were added in duplicate wells. Cells were
washed three times with Dulbecco Modified Eagle

Esbjörnsson et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:23

To confirm the phenotype results, we used 200 μl of each
isolate for infection of U87.CD4-CCR5 and U87.CD4CXCR4 in duplicate wells. The cells were washed 16 hours
post infection and then analyzed for p24 production as
described. From each isolate the V1-V3 region was amplified and used to produce recombinant viruses for infection
and analysis according to the described procedure. Infections of U87.CD4-CXCR4 with chimeric viruses derived
from R5 isolates were used as negative controls to calculate the p24 background value of the assay. Infections with
a significant increase (mean value +/- 3 S.D.) in p24 antigen production over time, compared to day one of the
infection, were considered as positive infections.

Medium 16 hours post infection. Cultures were analyzed
at day one, seven and nine for p24 antigen production
by ELISA (Biomérieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands).
To evaluate the performance of the TRT on subtype A
and CRF02_AG (which is A-like in the V1-V3 region of
gp120), we used a panel of selected isolates (generously
provided by Professor Jan Albert, Swedish Institute for
Infectious Disease Control) (Table 1). Subtype and phenotype of the isolates had been determined previously [21].

The aim was to characterize genetic properties in HIV-1
V3 env distinguishing CRF02_AG with different coreceptor tropism. Only two sequences of the control panel
(22480 and 22627) and three sequences of the plasma
samples (DL4477D, DL2391G and DL22853E) were of
HIV-1 CRF02_AG with pure CCR5 tropism. Since this
number was too low for an appropriate comparison
between the R5 and R5/X4 groups, we added all available V3 sequences, with known coreceptor tropism,
from Los Alamos sequence data base, to a final dataset
of 111 sequences (Additional files 2, 3, 4) [39]. Only one
sequence per patient was subjected for analyses. Multiple alignments of CRF02_AG V3 amino acid sequences
were performed as described, and positively [K and R]
and negatively [D and E] charged amino acids were
counted. In codons with amino acid mixtures, all possible permutations were assessed (Additional files 3 and
4). The combination resulting in the highest net charge
was used for phenotype prediction. The performance of
different sequence motif-based rules was measured in
terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). The sensitivity was determined as the fraction of predicted X4
sequences among the sequences from viruses phenotyped as CXCR4-using, the specificity as the fraction of
predicted R5 sequences among the sequences from
viruses phenotyped as CCR5-using only, the PPV as the
fraction of correctly predicted X4 sequences among all
predicted X4 sequences, and the NPV as the fraction of
correctly predicted R5 sequences among all predicted
R5 sequences.
Statistics

All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0.
Ethics

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, and the
Ministries of Health and the Interior in Guinea-Bissau.

Results
Subtype determination

The HIV-1 V3 region from 29 plasma samples, collected
during late-stage disease from 29 treatment-naïve individuals, was amplified and sequenced. A phylogenetic tree
with these sequences and reference sequences of different subtypes was reconstructed. Sequences were well
separated with long branches in the phylogeny, indicating patient-specific origin of sequences (Fig. 1). Twentyeight sequences formed a subtype A cluster together
with reference sequences of A1, A2 and CRF02_AG.
The non-subtype A sequence clustered with reference
strains of subtype C. The V3 region of CRF02_AG is
subtype A-derived, and to further characterize these
sequences we made a BLAST-search using each sample
sequence as query sequence. The three most similar full
genome (> 8000 bp) hits were used as reference
sequences to distinguish subtype A from CRF02_AG.
Among the 28 patients with subtype A-like sequences,
22 clustered with CRF02_AG reference sequences, and
six with the previously described subsubtype A3 (Fig. 1,
Table 2) [48].
Accuracy of the phenotypic method for subtype A and
CRF02_AG

Construction of chimeric viruses is a commonly used
method for coreceptor tropism analysis, and both commercial and in-house variants can be found in the literature [29,30,49]. Here, we used for subtype B the
well-established Tropism Recombinant Test (TRT)
[29,50]. To confirm that the TRT assay performs
equally well for HIV-1 subtype A and CRF02_AG as
for HIV-1 subtype B, we used a control panel of
HIV-1 subtype A and CRF02_AG isolates with known
coreceptor tropism. We reanalyzed and confirmed previous results of the isolates by infecting the cell lines
U87.CD4-CCR5 and U87.CD4-CXCR4, and by direct
sequencing of the V3 region with flanking regions
(Table 1). The V1-V3 region of each isolate was amplified and used for production of chimeric viruses. Tropism results of infections with chimeric viruses were in
concordance with results from isolate infections, showing that the TRT assay can be used for determination
of coreceptor tropism of HIV-1 subtype A and
CRF02_AG (Table 1). The high concordance also suggests that the major determinants for coreceptor use
are located within the V1-V3 region.

To investigate the prevalence of CXCR4-using populations in the 28 individuals from Guinea-Bissau infected
with HIV-1 subtype A or CRF02_AG, we constructed
infectious chimeric viruses with patient-specific gp120
V1-V3 regions. All chimeric viruses that were tested
established productive infections with a significant
increase in p24 antigen production over time (1-9 days)
in U87.CD4-CCR5 and/or U87.CD4-CXCR4 cells.
Twenty-one (75%) of the individuals studied had viruses
that used both CCR5 and CXCR4 for cellular entry,
whereas one (4%) and six (21%) individuals had pure X4
or R5 populations, respectively (Table 2). In subtype A
infected individuals, three of six had CXCR4-using
populations, whereas the corresponding number in
CRF02_AG infected individuals were 19 of 22 (86%).
Recently, an evolving epidemic with increasing frequency of CXCR4 tropism among subtype C-infected
individuals was suggested [11]. To determine if a similar
pattern could be seen in our HIV-1 CRF02_AG material
from Guinea-Bissau, we divided the data set in one early
group (samples collected from 1997 to 2001), and one
late group (samples collected from 2003 to 2007). In the
early group, five out of eight samples had viruses that
were CXCR4-tropic, whereas all samples in the late
group were of this phenotype (14 out of 14) (p = 0.036,
two-tailed Fisher’s exact test). The two groups were well
balanced with no significant differences in CD4+ T cell
counts (p = 0.646 and p = 0.220 for CD4tot and CD4%,
respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). To investigate if
this difference could be found in a larger material of
HIV-1 CRF02_AG we added all available data from the
literature and in The Los Alamos Sequence Data Base
where we could couple patient-specific disease status
with coreceptor tropism and sampling year (Additional
file 5). We found data of 43 different individuals
sampled during 1997-2001 or 2003-2007 with defined
late-stage disease and with known coreceptor tropism
(42 from Cameroon and 1 from Ghana). When analyzed
together with our samples from Guinea-Bissau, 28 out
of 50 had viruses that were CXCR4-tropic in the early
group, whereas 14 out of 15 were of this phenotype in
the late group (p = 0.012, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test)
(Additional file 5).
Molecular characterization of the V3 region coupled to
coreceptor tropism

To create a data set that would allow for comparison
between the R5 and R5X4/X4 groups, we combined the
22 CRF02_AG plasma-derived sequences with the three
CRF02_AG sequences from the control panel and the

86 CRF02_AG sequences available in Los Alamos
sequence data base with known phenotype resulting in a
final dataset of 111 sequences (75 R5 and 36 R5X4 or
X4 sequences) (Additional files 3 and 4). Sequences of
subsubtype A3 were too few, and therefore not subjected for further analysis. Several sequence motif-based
rules and bioinformatic tools have been developed to
predict coreceptor tropism based on V3 sequences of
HIV-1. These have mainly been based on subtype B,
and the most common are the 11/25 rule (positively
charged amino acids in V3 position 11 and/or 25 predicts CXCR4 tropism) and the net charge rule (a net
charge of ≥+5 predicts CXCR4 tropism) [51]. Raymond
et al. used the 11/25 rule in combination with the net
charge rule to develop a genotypic rule specific for
CRF02_AG (Table 3) [52]. Here, we used these rules
and two widely used bioinformatic tools, WebPSSM and
Geno2Pheno to predict the HIV-1 tropism based on the
V3 sequence [32,53] (Table 3). The sensitivity reflects
how many sequences of the true CXCR4-using viruses
that the genotypic rule or bioinformatic tool identifies
as CXCR4-using, whereas the specificity reflects how
many sequences of the true CCR5-using viruses that the
genotypic rule or bioinformatic tool identifies as CCR5using. The PPV (R5X4/X4) and the NPV (R5) reflect

how many of the predictions that are accurate. Of existing rules and tools, Geno2Pheno had the highest sensitivity, whereas the combined rule by Raymond et al. had
the highest specificity (Table 3).
The sensitivity is of particular interest in clinical settings since it reflects the likelihood of detecting true
CXCR4-tropism, and patients having HIV-1 of this
tropism may not be suitable for treatment with coreceptor antagonists. Due to the low sensitivity of previous rules for HIV-1 of CRF02_AG, we used our data
set to develop new rules. The mean net charges of V3
in the R5 and R5X4/X4 groups were 3.45 (95% CI:
3.27-3.64), and 4.47 (95% CI: 4.01-4.94), respectively.
Modifying the net charge rule by setting the cutoff for
prediction of CXCR4 tropism to ≥+4, we improved the
sensitivity to 72%, although to a cost of both specificity
(47%) and PPV (46%) (Table 3). We then examined
another approach by counting the total number of
charged amino acids. The mean numbers of charged
amino acids were 6.60 (95% CI: 6.36-6.84) and 7.58
(95% CI: 7.16-8.01) for the R5 and R5X4/X4 group,
respectively. Setting the cutoff to ≥ 8 charged amino
acids for prediction of CXCR4 tropism resulted in a
sensitivity equal to the one obtained by Geno2Pheno
(50%) (Table 3).

Finally, we tested all possible combinations of previous
genotypic rules analyzed in this study, and the net
charge rule of ≥+4 and/or the total charge rule of ≥ 8
for prediction of CXCR4 use (data not shown). Of all
combinations tested, the combination of the net charge
rule of ≥+5 and total charge rule of ≥ 8 resulted in the
best improvement in sensitivity (64%), without losing
too much in specificity (73%) (Table 3).

Discussion
In this study, we show that the V1-V3 region of the
HIV-1 envelope is the major determinant for coreceptor
tropism also for subtype A and CRF02_AG, and that the
TRT assay accurately determines coreceptor tropism for
these subtypes [29]. In our samples, we found a high
prevalence of X4 populations (79%) during late-stage
disease and an increasing frequency of HIV-1 with
CXCR4 tropism in CRF02_AG-infected patients over
time. We also demonstrate that the total number of
charged amino acids may contribute to the development
of genotypic rules and bioinformatic tools for prediction
of coreceptor tropism of HIV-1 CRF02_AG.
HIV-1 subtype determination was done by amplifying
and sequencing the envelope gp120 V3 region of 29
infected individuals in late-stage disease from GuineaBissau, West Africa. Twenty-eight of the individuals had
HIV-1 of subtype A or CRF02_AG, confirming previous
results that these are the dominating HIV-1 forms in
Guinea-Bissau [54]. The remaining study subject was
infected with HIV-1 subtype C, a subtype that has never
been described in Guinea-Bissau before, even though it
has been shown to circulate to some extent in West
Africa [55]. A detailed analysis of the six patients
infected with subtype A showed close genetic relationship to the previously described sub-subtype A3 (Fig. 1).
This sub-subtype was first described in Senegal, but has
been shown to be prevalent in several West African
countries, including Guinea-Bissau [48,56].
A control panel of 11 HIV-1 subtype A and
CRF02_AG isolates was used to show that the, for subtype B, well-characterized TRT assay is accurate also for
subtype A and CRF02_AG. This finding suggests that
the gp120 V1-V3 region is the major determinant of
coreceptor phenotype also for subtype A and
CRF02_AG. This conclusion is in line with the general
concept previously established for subtype B that coreceptor phenotype is determined by the V1-V3 region of
gp120, in particular the V3 region [23]. Our results
show that the TRT can be used as a reliable alternative
to the commercially available Trofile assay (Monogram
Biosciences, San Francisco, USA), at least for the tested
subtypes. The Trofile assay require amplification of the
entire gp160 (2,500 bp), and it has been proposed that
use of V1-V3 (940 bp) can be a more sensitive approach

Page 8 of 13

as it could reduce the risk of losing minority populations seen when amplifying a larger fragment [50].
Since we had a reliable phenotypic assay, we were able
to analyze genetic traits that would best predict coreceptor phenotype for viruses from our HIV-1 CRF02_AG
samples. Applying the 11/25 rule (positively charged
amino acids in V3 position 11 and/or 25 predicts
CXCR4 tropism) we found a sensitivity of 31%, and a
specificity 95%. This is similar to a previous study of
113 CRF02_AG isolates, where the 11/25 rule had a sensitivity of 33%, and a specificity of 96% [13]. In another
study the authors used the combined criteria of the 11/
25 and the net charge rule of V3 sequences of 52
CRF02_AG isolates and found both high sensitivity
(70%) and high specificity (98%) [52]. The results of the
combined criteria could, however, not be verified by our
data. A reason for the poor performance of this rule on
our dataset may be that it relies on the 11/25 rule. In
sequences from viruses with CXCR4 tropism from Guinea-Bissau we found in general negatively charged or
non-charged amino acids in positions 11 and 25,
whereas at least one of these positions in most cases
were positively charged in the sequences used in the
study by Raymond et al. (Additional files 3 and 4). We
also observed many charged (both positive and negative)
amino acids as a profound characteristic of sequences
derived from CXCR4-using viruses (in the complete
dataset). Therefore, we counted the total number of
charged amino acids in the V3 region and combined it
with the net charge rule. Due to sensitivity, this rule
performed better than all of the analyzed rules and
bioinformatic tools, without losing too much in specificity. This rule is also different to those rules that are
used for subtype B, suggesting that molecular differences
at the level of virus-cell receptor interaction may exist
among HIV-1 subtypes. Further studies are needed to
investigate subtype-specific genotypic differences
involved in HIV-1 coreceptor tropism, and the sensitivity of existing genotypic rules and bioinformatic tools
have to be increased before they can be used in a clinical setting.
Next, we examined the coreceptor phenotype of HIV1 in 28 subtype A or CRF02_AG infected individuals in
late-stage disease. CXCR4-using viral populations were
found in as much as 79% of the analyzed samples,
demonstrating the importance of analyzing samples
from patients in late-stage disease when investigating
HIV-1 subtype-specific predisposal for CXCR4 tropism.
For HIV-1 subtype B, it is well known that CCR5 is the
dominant coreceptor early in infection. Switch or broadening of coreceptor use from CCR5 to CXCR4 occurs
late in disease [6]. To our knowledge, only one previous
study has reported on CRF02_AG coreceptor tropism in
late-stage disease [13]. Vergne et al. found that 56% of

Esbjörnsson et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:23
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/23

the studied isolates were positive for MT-2 cell tropism,
to be compared to our result of CXCR4 use of 86%.
Although, it is important to note that the viruses in the
study by Vergne et al. were isolated from samples collected between 1996 and 2001, and the corresponding
number of CXCR4-tropism among our samples during
this time-frame was 63%.
Connell et al. (2008) analyzed the results of 19 subtype C isolates, isolated in 2005, and found a higher prevalence (30%) of CXCR4 tropism than has been shown
in earlier studies [11]. They suggested that HIV-1 subtype C might be an evolving epidemic, showing an
increasing prevalence of CXCR4 phenotype over time in
South Africa. In the present study, we performed a
direct comparison by dividing our 22 CRF02_AG samples into two groups: Samples from 1997 to 2001, and
samples from 2003 to 2007. The CD4+ T cell counts
and clinical data were similar between the two groups,
excluding any bias due to differences in disease status.
In addition, all of the investigated individuals were treatment naïve. We found a significant difference between
the groups, suggesting a similar kind of evolving epidemic for CRF02_AG in Guinea-Bissau that has been
suggested for subtype C in South Africa. We also analyzed our data together with available data of HIV-1
CRF02_AG infected patients with known clinical parameters and coreceptor tropism and found that the trend
of an evolving epidemic was consistent. Competition
assays between HIV-1 R5 and X4 viruses have shown
that X4 viruses in general out-compete R5 viruses due
to both higher replication kinetics and higher CXCR4
than CCR5 expression in PBMC [57]. Moreover, it has
been shown that sequence change occur at a rate of 1%
per year in HIV-1 env, illustrating the constant evolution of HIV-1 on the genetic level [58]. Further studies
(based on larger sample sizes than studied here and by
Connell et al.) are needed to investigate if HIV-1 is
evolving towards a more predisposed state of changing
into CXCR4 phenotype on a population level, and a
confirmation of this finding in larger cohorts may have
implications for viral transmission, pathogenesis and disease progression.
To further the view of our results, we performed a literature review of published results regarding subtypespecific coreceptor tropism in late-stage disease, which,
to our knowledge, has not been presented before. The
analysis included 498 patient-specific HIV-1 samples of
six different subtypes, sampled over more than 20 years
(1988-2008). Data of CD4+ T cell counts and/or clinical
status for all patients were examined, and only samples
from individuals diagnosed with AIDS or having CD4+
T cell counts ≤ 200 cells/μl were included in the analysis. In cases were both CD4+ T cell counts and clinical
status could be found, the criterion of CD4+ T cell

Page 9 of 13

count was used. The vast majority of patients were
included based on CD4+ T cell counts. Moreover, only
one sample per patient was allowed, and in cases where
the same patients appeared in several studies the patient
data were only used once (for details about the analysis,
see Additional file 6). HIV-1 coreceptor tropism determined as MT-2 non-syncytium or syncytium inducing
was regarded as CCR5 or CXCR4 tropism, respectively
[22]. If HIV-1 subtype and coreceptor tropism were not
specified, this data were confirmed by personal communication with the authors (Additional file 6, and
Acknowledgement). Our analysis revealed a high frequency of HIV-1 R5X4 or X4 populations in late stage
disease among all analyzed subtypes, except for subtype
C (Fig. 2). Only 15% of the individuals infected with
HIV-1 subtype C had CXCR4-using populations, compared to 66% (60%-77%) in individuals infected with
HIV-1 of non-subtype C (p < 0.001, two-tailed Fisher’s
exact test).
The data from the literature review also allowed us to
investigate if we could confirm the results of Connell et
al. of an evolving epidemic in South Africa, and if this
could be seen for subtype C in general [11]. We divided
the subtype C data set (208 patients, samples collected
in Cameroon, Ethiopia, India, Malawi, South Africa,
Sweden and Zimbabwe) into an early group (samples
before the year of 2000) and a late group (samples after
2000) (Additional file 7). In the early group from South
Africa eight of 46 patients (17%) had CXCR4-using
viruses, whereas the corresponding number in the late
group was 11 of 36 (31%) (p = 0.19, two-tailed Fisher’s
exact test). Connell et al. reported that 30% of their isolates were able to use CXCR4 and compared this to previous studies from South Africa showing no syncytiuminducing (SI) capacity of HIV-1 isolates collected during
the 1980s, whereas 10-17% of the studied isolates had SI
capacity during the 1990s. No statistical evaluation was
performed in their study. In the early group of our complete subtype C data set, 11 of 145 patients (8%) had
CXCR4-using viruses, whereas the corresponding number in the late group was 21 of 63 (33%) (p < 0.001,
two-tailed Fisher’s exact test). Our results confirms the
numbers presented by Connell et al. in South Africa
(even though the difference between the early and the
late group was not statistically significant), and further
strengthens the concern of an evolving HIV-1 subtype
C-epidemic on the population level.
Understanding subtype-specific differences regarding
coreceptor tropism is important for several reasons.
First, these studies may help us understanding differences in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Several studies have indicated differences in relative pathogenicity between
different subtypes, where subtype D appears to be more
pathogenic compared to other subtypes [59]. Moreover,

Esbjörnsson et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:23
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/23

Page 10 of 13

it has been shown that HIV-1 subtype D has a preference for CXCR4 tropism early in infection, and a connection with the faster disease progression seen in this
subtype has been suggested [3]. Second, understanding
HIV-1 subtype-specific differences regarding the ability
to develop CXCR4-using populations may be of great
importance for future treatment guidelines for coreceptor antagonists. Fätkenheuer et al. (2008) reported a
striking difference in the appearance of X4 populations
among patients with experienced treatment failure, after
receiving either the CCR5-antagonist Maraviroc or a
placebo treatment [60]. Despite a short follow-up period
of only 48-weeks, as many as 57% of patients receiving
Maraviroc developed X4 viruses (76 of 133 patients),
compared to only 6% (6 of 95 patients) in the placebo
group. This finding strengthens the concerns that CCR5
antagonists could increase the risk of HIV-1 populations
to shift away from CCR5 to CXCR4 use, potentially
leading to treatment failure and faster disease progression [61,62]. Most of the participants in the above study
were infected with HIV-1 subtype B, and more studies
are needed to determine if the outgrowth of R5X4 or
X4 populations will be as distinct also for other subtypes, such as subtype C.
Based on the accumulated knowledge on subtype C
infections, it is tempting to speculate that subtype Cinfected patients in general may be more suitable for
treatment with CCR5 antagonists than patients infected
with other subtypes, at least in late-stage disease. Taken
these thoughts further, different subtypes and CRFs may
be more or less predisposed for the emergence of R5X4
or X4 populations, although it seems that CXCR4-using
HIV-1 populations likely will arise in most HIV-1 nonsubtype C infections (Fig. 2). The comparative picture of
subtype-dependent HIV-1 coreceptor tropism in latestage disease underlines the importance of further studies on HIV-1 subtype-dependent coreceptor tropism,
an issue of direct clinical importance for the development of treatment guidelines of the recently introduced
coreceptor antagonists in HIV treatment regimens.

Conclusion
In summary, we show that the TRT assay accurately
determines the HIV-1 coreceptor tropism of subtype A
and CRF02_AG. Using this assay we found a high
amount of HIV-1 CXCR4-using populations (79%) in
our plasma samples and an increasing frequency of
CXCR4 tropism in CRF02_AG-infected patients over
time. The emergence of CXCR4 use may have implications for viral transmission, pathogenesis and disease
progression. We also demonstrate that the combined
criteria of the total number of charged amino acids and

Esbjörnsson et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:23
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/23

net charge of the V3 region is a more sensitive predictor
of CXCR4 tropism for HIV-1 CRF02_AG compared to
the analyzed genotypic rules and bioinformatic tools.
Finally, we conducted an extensive literature analysis of
498 individuals which, to our knowledge, is the most
extensive comparison of subtype-specific coreceptor
tropism in late-stage disease. We found a generally high
frequency of CXCR4 tropism among all major subtypes
and CRFs, except for subtype C. These results demonstrate the need for further studies investigating subtypespecific emergence for CXCR4-tropism, this may be
particularly important due to the introduction of CCR5antagonists in HIV treatment regimens.
