Genomic within theHaemophilus

Abstract
Background: A major part of horizontal gene transfer that contributes to the diversification and
adaptation of bacteria is facilitated by genomic islands. The evolution of these islands is poorly
understood. Some progress was made with the identification of a set of phylogenetically related
genomic islands among the Proteobacteria, recognized from the investigation of the evolutionary
origins of a Haemophilus influenzae antibiotic resistance island, namely ICEHin1056. More clarity
comes from this comparative analysis of seven complete sequences of the ICEHin1056 genomic
island subfamily.
Results: These genomic islands have core and accessory genes in approximately equal proportion,
with none demonstrating recent acquisition from other islands. The number of variable sites within
core genes is similar to that found in the host bacteria. Furthermore, the GC content of the core
genes is similar to that of the host bacteria (38% to 40%). Most of the core gene content is formed
by the syntenic type IV secretion system dependent conjugative module and replicative module. GC
content and lack of variable sites indicate that the antibiotic resistance genes were acquired
relatively recently. An analysis of conjugation efficiency and antibiotic susceptibility demonstrates
that phenotypic expression of genomic island-borne genes differs between different hosts.
Conclusion: Genomic islands of the ICEHin1056 subfamily have a longstanding relationship with
H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae and are co-evolving as semi-autonomous genomes within the
'supragenomes' of their host species. They have promoted bacterial diversity and adaptation
through becoming efficient vectors of antibiotic resistance by the recent acquisition of antibiotic
resistance transposons.

Background

autonomous existence for species-specific subfamilies of
these genomic islands; however, further evidence is needed.

Horizontal gene transfer contributes to the diversification
and adaptation of micro-organisms. Apart from the core
genes that are present in all strains of the same species and
are the minimum necessary for survival under optimal
growth conditions, bacterial genomes also harbor a variable
number of accessory genes that are acquired by horizontal
gene transfer, many of which are crucial for bacterial adaptation and survival. The sum of the core genes and accessory
genes across the species represent what is regarded as the
'supragenome'. The accessory genes are frequently aggregated into heterogeneous sets of hitherto ill-defined structures called genomic islands, the origins of which are
unknown. We recently reported on a set of genomic islands
found among Proteobacteria that shared a common ancestor
and were coherently structured [1]. This study suggested for
the first time that a family of genomic islands had a deep evolutionary history. However, further evidence indicated they
were also capable of propagation by self-directed transfer
through conjugation and replication [2,3]. The relationships
between species-specific subfamilies of this family of genomic
islands found among Proteobacteria have not been
determined.
In general, genomic islands, although poorly defined, have
been regarded as segments of DNA acquired by horizontal
gene transfer, with major features that include the following:
GC content that is usually different from the rest of the
genome; common insertion in tRNA genes; direct repeated
DNA sequences at the ends; and the presence of genes such as
integrases, transposases, or insertion sequences. Genomic
islands often offer selective advantages; thus, according to
their gene content, they can be described as pathogenicity,
symbiosis, metabolic, fitness, or resistance islands [4].
Whether all genomic islands will be classified into related
families remains to be seen.
The family of genomic islands we previously reported was
identified through investigations into the origins of antibiotic
resistance that emerged in Haemophilus influenzae in the
early 1970s [5,6]. Determining the origins of antibiotic resistance focused on the sequence of an exemplar genomic island
named ICEHin1056. ICEHin1056 was shown to belong to a
family of genomic islands with deep evolutionary origins
found among Proteobacteria, including Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Ralstonia metallidurans, Pseudomonas sp. B13, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1,7-9]. These islands functioned
as integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Conjugation,
the process for self-directed transfer of elements between
bacteria, is facilitated in this family of genomic islands by a
process involving a novel type IV secretion system (T4SS) [2].
Furthermore, replication, transfer, and integration of these
genomic islands into recipient strains of the host species has
been demonstrated [2,3]. These limited data indicate a semi-

Despite an unknown potential for horizontal transfer
between species, the islands we have studied [1,2] show striking evidence of a phylogeny shaped by descent within the
deep evolutionary history of their host bacterial species. In
particular, a single common ancestor can be recognized for
genomic islands carried by H. influenzae, Haemophilus
ducreyi, and Haemophilus somnus. The contrast between
evidence for phylogenetic descent on the one hand [1] and for
potential horizontal spread by conjugation on the other [2]
raised questions about the factors both promoting and limiting conjugative spread of these genomic islands. A more thorough understanding of how these genomic islands are
evolving and functionally behaving may explain the spread of
antibiotic resistance in H. influenzae. Accordingly, a detailed
comparative investigation of multiple examples of the
ICEHin1056 subfamily was undertaken.
To address the questions raised above, we report on sequence
and functional analyses of seven genomic islands identified in
H. influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. A set of
shared core genes predicted to encode proteins involved in
replication and T4SS-dependent transfer is described, and we
show that these islands also carry a variety of accessory genes
that contribute to genetic diversity. The extent and distribution of accessory gene content of this subfamily of genomic
islands is similar to that reported for the overall supragenome
of the bacterial host H. influenzae. The findings suggest substantial variation in sequence and gene content that is inconsistent with a historically recent acquisition and clonal
expansion of these islands. However, the transposons containing antibiotic resistance genes exhibit features indicating
that they have more recently been acquired. The conjugative
and antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes are compared
between islands and the observed variation is attributed to
associated background diversity in the bacterial host
genomes.

Results and discussion
General features of H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae
genomic islands
At the time of analysis seven genomic islands were available
for study. Three were individually sequenced, whereas the
others were identified from completed bacterial genomic
sequences (Table 1). The islands were found among H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae as follows: ICEHin1056 in H.
influenzae 1056, ICEHin299 in H. influenzae 299,
ICEHin2866 in H. influenzae 2866, ICEHin028 in H. influenzae 028, ICEHinB in H. influenzae B, ICEHpa8f in H.
parainfluenzae 8f, and ICEHpaT3T1 in H. parainfluenzae
T3T1 (Table 1). General features of these Haemophilus spp.
genomic islands and their gene content are shown in Table 2
and Figure 1, respectively. Among these, the H. influenzae

Genomic islands are horizontally acquired segments of DNA, with major features that include: GC content different from the rest of the genome,
insertion in tRNA genes, direct repeated DNA sequences at the ends, and the presence of mobility genes. Genomic islands that are capable of
integration into the chromosome of the host, excision, and self-transfer to a new host and reintegration are usually called Integrative and
Conjugative Elements (ICEs).

island ICEHin1056 and the H. parainfluenzae island
ICEHpaT3T1 are the largest and have the most open reading
frames. Only a single copy of the genomic island was identified per chromosome of the respective host strain (data not
shown).

All seven genomic islands exhibited extensive DNA sequence
homologies and preserved gene order in most cases (Figure
1). The only major difference in gene order is represented by
the region containing Tn10, in which the orientation is
reversed between ICEHin1056 and ICEHpaT3T1 (Figure 2).

Whereas high sequence similarities (some of 100%) were
observed, especially in the putative replication and T4SS
modules (Figures 1 and 2), the degree of sequence conservation between pairs of genomic islands varied more widely in

the putative integration module (right-hand side of Figure 2).
For example, we observed 74% to 99% nucleotide sequence

As shown in Figure 1, a total of 84 open reading frames were
identified in the seven genomic islands surveyed. The putative replication module and the putative transfer module
(including T4SS) comprised the majority of the 43 genes conserved across all genomic islands. These 43 genes were
defined to constitute the essential core set of genes of an
ICEHin1056-based subfamily of genomic islands. The
remaining 41 genes, including the transposon-based genes,
are likely to be accessory genes. A majority of the accessory
genes, whether they were part of transposons (transposon
[Tn]3 in ICEHin1056 or Tn10 in ICEHpaT3T1) or not, were
located 3' of traC and 5' to the putative traI. Many of these
accessory genes have unknown functions. This localized site
of accessory gene presence suggests that this is a region that
is particularly permissive for their insertion. Curiously, this
region in the larger family of related proteobacterial genomic
islands is also a nidus for accessory gene insertion [1], suggesting that this area is a 'hot spot' for recombination for the
entire family. No explanation for this phenomenon is apparent, although this region is just 5' to the putative oriT of
ICEHin1056.

genomic islands having recently been acquired and disseminated by clonal expansion. Furthermore, the similarity of GC
content of the genomic island core genes (38%) to the GC content of the host genomes (Table 2) suggests that this ratio for
the island has ameliorated to that of the host bacteria, which
is time dependent. All these features are consistent with this
subfamily of genomic islands having a longstanding association with its Haemophilus host species.

The observed distribution between core genes and accessory
genes in this subfamily of genomic islands indicates that 50%
are accessory. This is remarkably similar to the distribution
found in the complete H. influenzae genomes analyzed by
Hogg and coworkers [10]. Furthermore, excluding the antibiotic resistance transposons, the GC content of the other
accessory genes is similar to that of the H. influenzae genome
and to that of these genomic islands' core genes. These features suggest that this subfamily of genomic islands conforms
to the distributed genome hypothesis in the same way that the
host genome does. This hypothesis proposes that the full
complement of genes available to a pathogenic bacterial species exists in a supragenome pool, which is not contained by
any particular strain. Although individual strains carry only a
subset of genes, a diverse range of genes can be available to
naturally transformable bacterial strains [10]. Evidence for
the distributed genome hypothesis has thus far been demonstrated for several bacterial pathogens, including H.
influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa
[10-12].

Diversity and co-evolution of the ICEHin1056 subfamily of genomic islands with the host
The divergence in gene content between the seven genomic
islands described here is clearly illustrated in Figure 1. No two
islands were identical and they differed by many genes. Even
the core genes of conserved modules exhibited many variable
sites, with the nucleotide sequences between several core
genes differing by up to 10% or more (Figure 1). A similar level
of variation is seen in the housekeeping genes of the bacterial
host H. influenzae [13]. These accumulations of mutations
must have taken substantial time. Both the divergence in gene
content between the genomic islands and the variation in
nucleotide sequence of their core genes are contrary to these

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R237

Juhas et al. R237.6

None of these genomic islands contained nucleotide
sequences indicating recent acquisition from other subfamilies present in H. somnus and H. ducreyi, nor from more
distantly related members of this family of islands. This
observation provides evidence that the ICEHin1056 subfamily is evolving by descent within its host species without
recombination with other species-specific subfamilies. However, it is curious that the two genomic islands present in H.
parainfluenzae had no features to distinguish them specifically from the five genomic islands present in H. influenzae.
From other recent work, this ICEHin1056 subfamily of
genomic islands appears to be shared only by these two
human Haemophilus spp. [14]. The factors that limit this
genomic island to two species to the exclusion of the many
other closely related human Haemophilus spp. are unclear
and await further investigation.

Highly conserved putative replication module
The putative replication module of the genomic islands surveyed is composed of between 15 and 18 genes, mostly of
hypothetical function, that share extensive sequence
homology and are arranged in the same order. Fourteen of
these genes, including homologs of parA, dnaB, ssb, topB,
inrR, and radC, were present in all islands tested and would
be predicted to be involved in DNA replication. The gene
parA encodes the chromosome partitioning protein that
divides and distributes plasmid copies upon cell division;
dnaB encodes a helicase that unwinds DNA strands; ssb
encodes a single-strand protein that binds the lagging DNA
strand thus preventing re-annealing; topB encodes a topoisomerase that protects free DNA strands from random ligation; and radC encodes a DNA repair protein involved in the
recombination repair associated with a DNA replication fork
[15-17]. One of the other encoded conserved hypothetical proteins exhibited low similarity to the carboxyl-terminal region
of Shigella flexneri OSA protein, which is known to suppress
the oncogenicity activity in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, but
its function in H. influenzae is unclear [18].
The most notable variation in the putative replication module
was found in the H. parainfluenzae genomic island
ICEHpaT3T1, where the osa homolog, which is present in all
of the other islands, was missing and substituted by four
ICEHpaT3T1-specific genes. Out of these four genes, two
encode hypothetical proteins, whereas the others encode an
ATP-binding protein that is highly conserved in variety of
bacterial species and a possible filamentous phage CTX-

RtsR-like repressor. The fact that ICEHpaT3T1 is missing the
OSA homolog and that the four ICEHpaT3T1-specific genes
are not present in other islands would suggest that only the
remaining 14 genes are essential for the replication of this
subfamily of genomic islands.

to detect because of their lower conjugation transfer frequencies (see below). This hypothesis was tested by an experiment
in which different genomic islands were transferred into the
same host background (H. influenzae strain Rd). The characterized H. influenzae fimbrial gene cluster (hif) is absent in
strain Rd, which has not been demonstrated to produce either
fimbriae or type IV pili [24,25]. However, electron microscopic examination of strain Rd harboring genomic islands
ICEHin1056, ICEHin299, ICEHin2866, ICEHpa8f, and
ICEHpaT3T1 revealed T4SS pili (Figure 3d-h), thus providing
experimental evidence on the activity of T4SS encoded by
these genomic islands.

The putative origin of replication oriV has been identified in
the replication module, based on the presence of iteron-like
(multiple direct repeats of DNA bases) sequences and
multiple indirect repeats in an AT-rich region [19]. These features are consistent with the oriVs of the larger family of
genomic islands found in a variety of other Proteobacteria,
including pKLC102 of P. aeruginosa C [20], SPI-7 of S. enterica serovar Typhi [7], and PAPI of P. aeruginosa PA14 [21].

Highly conserved type IV secretion module
Apart from the putative replication module, the T4SS module
was the most conserved part of the ICEHin1056 subfamily of
genomic islands, with DNA similarity ranging from 95% to
100% between islands. T4SSs are multi-subunit cell envelope
spanning structures that comprise a secretion channel and
often a pilus or other surface filament or protein [22]. Conjugation systems, assembled by a subfamily of the T4SSs, are
usually used in the process of conjugative transfer of DNA
from donor to recipient cells [23]. In our previous work we
showed that this conserved cluster of genes encodes a novel
T4SS that is responsible for formation of the conjugative pilus
and the resulting conjugative transfer of the H. influenzae
genomic island ICEHin1056 [2].
Of the Haemophilus spp. strains harboring islands, only
those that exhibited the highest conjugation transfer
frequencies (ICEHin1056, ICEHin299, and ICEHpaT3T1)
were shown to produce the T4SS pilus (Figure 3a-c and Table
3). It is reasonable to assume that this pilus is produced also
by other genomic islands surveyed, but its presence is harder

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R237

Juhas et al. R237.7

Further experimental proof of the activity of the T4SS
encoded by the genomic islands tested was provided by the
analysis of the conjugation transfer frequencies. As shown in
Table 3, genomic islands were transferred from the donors to
a rec- streptomycin-resistant recipient H. influenzae strain
(Rd) by conjugation, albeit with different efficiencies ranging
from 10-5 (ICEHin1056 and ICEHin299) to 10-9 (ICEHpa8f).
Any contribution of natural transformation and homologous
recombination to transfer of genomic island-borne genes is
remote because the recipient was recombination deficient
and previous work did not demonstrate such a process [26].
Transconjugants were selected on the plates containing either
streptomycin plus ampicillin or streptomycin plus tetracycline, and recipients were selected on plates containing streptomycin. The conjugation frequency of the island ICEHinB
was assumed to be lower than could be detected using our
method. To test whether the differences in the conjugal transfer frequencies of the ICEHin1056 subfamily of genomic
islands were due either to the respective host strain or to the
gene content of the island, five genomic islands (ICEHin1056,
ICEHin299, ICEHin2866, ICEHpa8f, and ICEHpaT3T1)
present in the streptomycin-resistant H. influenzae strain Rd
background were each transferred to the same recipient: a

nalidixic acid-resistant strain Rd. Although recombination
proficient, previous unpublished work does not demonstrate
any transfer of genomic island borne genes by transformation
and homologous recombination in this setting. Transconjugants were selected on plates containing either nalidixic acid
plus ampicillin or nalidixic acid plus tetracycline, and recipients were selected on plates containing nalidixic acid. As
shown in Table 3, the conjugal transfer frequencies were
almost constant when H. influenzae strain Rd was used as a
donor, which is indicative of the different host strains introducing variations in conjugation efficiency in the initial
experiment. This observation is consistent with the very high
sequence homology of the T4SS module between the genomic
islands tested.

ICEHpaT3T1 being the exception. The complete copy of Tn3
revealed a gene organization identical to the Escherichia coli
derived Tn3 transposon [28] and was present in ICEHin299,
ICEHin2866, ICEHin028, ICEHinB, and ICEHpa8f (Figure
5). Correspondingly, the host strains harboring genomic
islands ICEHin299, ICEHin2866, ICEHinB, and ICEHpa8f
were resistant to ampicillin (Table 4). Moreover, when these
islands were transferred into the ampicillin-sensitive H.
influenzae strain Rd, they also expressed ampicillin resistance; however, most exhibited much greater resistance than
the parent strains (Table 4). A truncated Tn3 present in
ICEHin1056 did not contain the transposase tnpA (Figure 5).
As shown in Table 4, truncation of Tn3 in ICEHin1056 did not
abolish the ampicillin resistance activity of the host strain.
The reason for the truncation of Tn3 in ICEHin1056 is
unknown, although such modified transposons have frequently been identified in other bacteria. Tn3 is inserted in
the same specific site, between genes tfc20 and tfc21, in the
five genomic islands that harbor the complete copy. Moreover, the nucleotide sequences of tnpA, tnpR, and bla genes of
these genomic islands were identical. ICEHin1056 shares an
identical bla gene, but it has a single variable site in its tnpR
nucleotide sequence. The Tn3 found in E. coli [28] contained
approximately 300 variable sites (1% to 6% difference
depending on the gene) compared with those complete Tn3s
found in the five Haemophilus spp. genomic islands. In
addition the GC content of the Tn3 genes (50%) differed substantially from the core genes of this subfamily of the genomic
islands (38%).

The only exception to similar conjugation frequencies in
strain Rd was genomic island ICEHpaT3T1, which demonstrated a significantly reduced conjugation efficiency (Table
3). An explanation for the lower frequency of transfer of
ICEHpaT3T1 from strain Rd donor, when compared with the
others of the ICEHin1056 subfamily, may be found in the
sequence diversity of the genetfc20 in ICEHpaT3T1. The
tfc20 gene constitutes the only variation in the otherwise
homogenous block of genes of the conserved T4SS module.
The tfc20 gene encodes a hypothetical protein with unknown
function that is conserved in six genomic islands surveyed. As
shown in Figure 4, the second half of tfc20 in ICEHpaT3T1
differs substantially from tfc20 identified in the rest of the
genomic islands surveyed. This may be a consequence of the
insertion and subsequent excision of a transposon into and
out of the ancestor of ICEHpaT3T1. Because Tn3 was found
to be localized between genes tfc20 and tfc21 in five genomic
islands, namely ICEHin299, ICEHin2866, ICEHin028, ICEHinB, and ICEHpa8f, the sequence between genes tfc20 and
tfc21 may identify a 'hot spot' for transposon insertion.

Variable antibiotic resistance genes
The genomic islands tested contain a range of antibiotic
resistance genes, which is a crucial feature that contributes
both to bacterial adaptation and to its clinical significance.
Genes that confer resistance to three different antibiotics,
namely ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol, were
identified. In each case, the antibiotic resistance gene determinants are carried on transposons, with ampicillin on Tn3
and tetracycline and chloramphenicol on Tn10 variants. The
homologies of the transposon sequences were investigated in
detail.
Tn3 is one of the most extensively studied and best understood of prokaryotic transposable elements. It consists of
three genes: tnpA, which encodes a transposase that is essential for all transpositional recombination; tnpR, which
encodes a resolvase that acts both as a site-specific recombinational enzyme and as a repressor of tnpA and tnpR expression; and bla, which encodes a β-lactamase precursor [27].
Tn3 was identified in six of the genomic islands tested,

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R237

Juhas et al. R237.9

Tn10 is a composite bacterial transposon, consisting of indirectly repeating insertion sequences (ISs) IS10-right and
IS10-left flanking genes, which are involved in tetracycline
resistance [29]. Tn10 was identified in only two genomic
islands, ICEHin1056 and ICEHpaT3T1. In ICEHin1056 Tn10
was a variant containing additional sequences incorporating
IS5-right and IS5-left, which flank a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and IS30. Correspondingly,
ICEHin1056 confers resistance to both chloramphenicol and
tetracycline (Table 4). Moreover, ICEHin1056 Tn10 was
missing the jemA/gltS homolog, encoding sodium-dependent glutamate permease [30]. Absence of the jemA/gltS
homolog suggests that ICEHin1056 depends on tetB as the
only transport system for tetracycline. This observation may
also explain the quantitative difference in the level of tetracycline resistance conferred by ICEHin1056 and jemA/gltS
homolog-containing ICEHpaT3T1 (Table 4). Not only did the
structure of the two Tn10 structures differ, but so did their
sites of insertion and orientation. Furthermore, the GC content of the genes within Tn10 were as follows: 45% for IS10L,
52% for IS5L, 42% for cat, 55% for IS30, 51% for IS5R, 41%
for ybdA, 40% for tetR, 43% for tetB, and 45% IS10R. These
differed substantially from the GC content of the genomic
island core genes (38%).

These data suggest that these genomic islands acquired Tn3
and Tn10 a number of times, both independently and
recently. It is not possible to estimate the dates of these
events. At the latest it was approximately 1972 when antibiotic resistance was first detected in H. influenzae. Additional lines of evidence indicating recent acquisition are as
follows: first, the lack of sequence diversity between complete
Tn3 sequences found in five genomic islands tested; and second, the different GC content compared with that for the
genomic island core genes and for the host chromosome,
indicating a lack of time dependent amelioration. Although
only two examples of Tn10 were available for study, their distinct and higher GC content is also consistent with relatively
recent acquisition. The lack of sequence diversity among the
complete Tn3 sequences and their identical point of insertion
are curious, because they are from bacterial isolates obtained
from points separated markedly in time and geography
(Table 1). This may suggest that the same variant of Tn3 is
being repeatedly acquired from an independent source and
inserting at a 'hot spot' in this subfamily of genomic islands.
Alternatively, it may be that Tn3 was acquired as a rare event
and has disseminated rapidly worldwide by conjugative
transfer of the host genomic island. We are currently actively
investigating this possibility. Whichever interpretation is
confirmed, it can be inferred that the ICEHin1056 subfamily
of genomic islands are small self-perpetuating genomes that
are dependent both on a set of highly conserved core genes
and on their host bacterial species. However, this subfamily is
also the nidus for the accumulation of antibiotic resistance
genes, making these islands vectors for the dissemination of
antibiotic resistance and thus promoting survival of the bacterial host species in the presence of antibiotic selective
pressures.

Conclusion

Our analysis clearly shows that the ICEHin1056 subfamily of
genomic islands is diverse and has not recently emerged in
Haemophilus spp., for example in association with the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Gene content and distribution
between core and accessory genes of the seven genomic
islands surveyed is remarkably similar to the host H. influenzae 'supragenome' and conforms to the distributed genome
hypothesis. From analysis of individual members' core genes,
it can be concluded that this subfamily of semi-autonomous
structures is co-evolving with the supragenomes of two highly
related host species: H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae.
Although mobile between host bacterial strains, the observation of host specificity for the subfamily of genomic islands
investigated is likely to be the case also for other subfamilies
found in Proteobacteria.
The core genes are organized in modules with conserved gene
order that encode functions that are crucial to the propagation and survival of this subfamily of genomic islands. Almost
identical gene organization is consistently preserved for these
modules in the larger family of genomic islands distributed
among many different Proteobacteria. This conservation
suggests that these genes are functionally constrained and,
acting in concert, they play a major role in the successful
propagation and survival of these genomic islands within
their bacterial hosts' supragenomes. Their importance is
overtly manifested by the rapid dissemination of antibiotic
resistance worldwide among H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae. The recent acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes
and the rapid global spread of antibiotic resistance over the
past 30 to 40 years is a good illustration of how genomic
islands contribute to bacterial diversification and adaptation.
Furthermore, results presented here show that variations in

the conjugative and antibiotic resistance phenotypes can be
influenced by genomic differences in the host bacteria. These
results suggest that host bacterial genes modify phenotypic
expression of genomic island-borne genes. This work is likely
to represent a paradigm for a much broader spectrum of
genomic islands than the subfamily described here.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains, genomic islands, and growth
conditions
All bacterial strains and genomic islands used in this study
are listed in Table 1. Unless stated otherwise, H. influenzae
and H. parainfluenzae strains were grown on heart infusion

broth (HIB) medium (Columbia agar containing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [15 μg/ml] and hemin [15 μg/ml]).
When required, the media was supplemented with kanamycin (10 μg/ml), tetracycline (2 μg/ml), ampicillin (4 μg/ml),
streptomycin (20 μg/ml), or nalidixic acid (10 μg/ml). All
Haemophilus spp. plate cultures were grown for 24 to 48
hours at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. For liquid culture, Haemophilus spp. were grown in brain
heart infusion broth (BHI) supplemented with nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (10 μg/ml), hemin (15 μg/ml) and,
where necessary, with antibiotics in the concentrations
described above and incubated at 200 rpm on a rotatory
shaker at 37°C.

Electron microscopy

Antimicrobial susceptibility
Minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline were determined using E-test. The
E-tests were performed using E-strips (AB Biodisk, Solna,
Sweden), following the manufacturer's instructions and
interpreted according to the manufacturer's guidelines.

Conjugal transfer of the Haemophilus spp. genomic
islands
The transfer efficiency of each genomic island was determined following a modification of the method proposed by
Stuy [31]. Donor or recipient cells were grown for 48 hours on
HIB agar and approximately 108 cells were scraped off the
plate and re-suspended in 1 ml BHI broth. Ten microliters of
the suspension of donor cells and 100 μl of the suspension of
recipient cells were gently mixed, achieving a ratio of donor to
recipient cells of approximately 1:10. This mixture was subsequently spread in the centre of antibiotic-free HIB agar
plates, allowed to dry, and then incubated for 6 hours. The
cells were then harvested by flooding the plate with 1 ml BHI
broth and re-suspending using a spreading paddle. Serial
dilutions were plated to determine the viable counts and the
number of transconjugants, donors, and recipients using agar
containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. In the first
step (transfer of genomic islands from original host strains to
a streptomycin-resistant recipient rec-H. influenzae strain
Rd, using a method previously described [26]), transconjugants were selected on the plates containing either streptomycin plus ampicillin or streptomycin plus tetracycline, and
recipients were selected on plates containing streptomycin.
In the second step (transfer of genomic islands from streptomycin-resistant donor H. influenzae strain Rd to a nalidixic
acid-resistant recipient H. influenzae strain Rd), transconjugants were selected on plates containing either nalidixic acid
plus ampicillin or nalidixic acid plus tetracycline, and recipients were selected on plates containing nalidixic acid. Experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the mean values for
conjugation frequency and its standard error for each strain
were calculated. Conjugation frequencies were calculated as
number of transconjugants divided by the number of
recipients.

To visualize the T4SS-dependent pilus, Haemophilus spp.
were grown overnight and then allowed to conjugate on antibiotic-free HIB agar plates for 6 hours. The conjugating cells
were harvested by flooding the plate with 1 ml distilled water
and subsequently re-suspended using a spreading paddle. A
copper grid coated with formvar and carbon was floated in
this suspension for 2 minutes. Excess fluid from the copper
grid was removed, prior to negative staining with 1% methyl
tungstate. The cells were examined for the presence of a pilus
by transmission electron microscopy.

DNA sequence analysis
H. influenzae strain 299 and H. parainfluenzae strain 8f were
sequenced by the method described earlier [1]. DNA sequence
similarity searches for genomic islands related to
ICEHin1056 using the BLASTN and BLASTX algorithms
[32], and position-specific iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) [33]
were performed by interrogating databases available through
the National Center for Biotechnology Information website.
Haemophilus spp. genomic islands were annotated and visualized with Artemis [34], a sequence viewer and annotation
tool that allows visualization of sequence features as well as
the results of analyses within the context of the sequence, and
its six-frame translation. Complete host genome sequences
and sequences of genomic islands were compared using the
TBLASTX algorithm of the Artemis comparison tool [34] to
identify regions of homology. Comparison of both the nucleotide and translated protein sequences of the seven genomic
islands included several different pair-wise combinations of
sequences to ensure fair and unbiased comparison. Pair-wise
alignment for the percentage of sequence homology between
genomic islands tested was carried out using BLAST2 [35].
