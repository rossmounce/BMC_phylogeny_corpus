Abstract
Background: The rate at which neutral (non-functional) bases undergo substitution is highly
dependent on their location within a genome. However, it is not clear how fast these locationdependent rates change, or to what extent the substitution rate patterns are conserved between
lineages. To address this question, which is critical not only for understanding the substitution
process but also for evaluating phylogenetic footprinting algorithms, we examine ancestral repeats:
a predominantly neutral dataset with a significantly higher genomic density than other datasets
commonly used to study substitution rate variation. Using this repeat data, we measure the extent
to which orthologous ancestral repeat sequences exhibit similar substitution patterns in separate
mammalian lineages, allowing us to ascertain how well local substitution rates have been preserved
across species.
Results: We calculated substitution rates for each ancestral repeat in each of three independent
mammalian lineages (primate – from human/macaque alignments, rodent – from mouse/rat
alignments, and laurasiatheria – from dog/cow alignments). We then measured the correlation of
local substitution rates among these lineages. Overall we found the correlations between lineages
to be statistically significant, but too weak to have much predictive power (r2 <5%). These
correlations were found to be primarily driven by regional effects at the scale of several hundred
kb or larger. A few repeat classes (e.g. 7SK, Charlie8, and MER121) also exhibited stronger
conservation of rate patterns, likely due to the effect of repeat-specific purifying selection. These
classes should be excluded when estimating local neutral substitution rates.
Conclusion: Although local neutral substitution rates have some correlations among mammalian
species, these correlations have little predictive power on the scale of individual repeats. This
indicates that local substitution rates have changed significantly among the lineages we have studied,
and are likely to have changed even more for more diverged lineages. The correlations that do
persist are too weak to be responsible for many of the highly conserved elements found by
phylogenetic footprinting algorithms, leading us to conclude that such elements must be conserved
due to selective forces.

Background
Understanding neutral substitution rates is of fundamental importance in understanding the evolutionary process,
as these rates define how the individual nucleotides and
organization of genomes change [1,2]. Neutral substitution rates also have an important practical relevance for
functional genomics, since they provide a threshold for
inferring selective pressure from cross-species sequence
conservation [3]. But because these rates vary by location
along mammalian genomes, estimation of local rates is
difficult and has been the subject of much study [4-7].
One approach towards a better understanding of neutral
substitution rates is to measure how well these local rates
are conserved across species [1,8-14]. A lack of rate conservation would imply that rates are dominated by lineagespecific (short-term) behavior. On the other hand, the
presence of rate conservation would imply that substitution rates are determined by shared local features that
might be retained in the orthologous loci of each species
(e.g. base composition, recombination rate, pattern of
nearby gene expression, etc.; see review by [15]). Furthermore, if local neutral substitution rates in one species
were similar to the orthologous rates in another, this
could result in cross-species sequence conservation at a
locus resulting from neutral effects. Accounting for such
effects would be important in evaluating phylogenetic
footprinting calculations, which use sequence conservation to identify functional sequences[16].
Previous studies of neutral substitution rate conservation
have focused on the rate of change of synonymous coding
sites – presumed to undergo substitution at approximately the local neutral rate [1,9-13,17]. Synonymous
substitution rates have been found to be correlated among
several mammalian species, including mouse, rat, human,
and dog. However, these correlations stem largely from
genes associated with gene regulation, and much of the
previously observed correlations are likely due to selection on the synonymous sites of such genes [1]. Because
some synonymous sites are known to be under selection
[18], as evidenced by studies of mRNA structure, splice
sites, transcription level, and silent substitution fixation
probabilities, decomposing the selective and neutral
aspects of such sites can be difficult. These considerations,
taken with the low density of such sites in the genome
(0.4% of the human genome, separated by intergenic distances of 100–200 kb), suggest the value in measuring the
neutral substitution rate through the use of other datasets.
An alternative source of data is provided by ancestral
repeats (ARs), the dead remnants of transposable elements [2-5,7,19,20]. ARs are typically nonfunctional and
occupy more than 40% of many mammalian genomes.
This dense genomic coverage allows one to discern finer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/89

details of the neutral rate structure than is possible
through the use of sparsely distributed synonymous sites.
However, the use of ARs has some caveats. Fast evolving
repeats may be too diverged to be recognized as ancient
repeat elements. Repeats older than approximately 200
Myr cannot be identified [21], and younger repeats may
also be missed in lineages that have a higher overall substitution rate (e.g. rodent [22]). RepeatMasker, the standard program for identifying repeats [23], fails to identify
degenerated elements having more than 30–35% mismatches at typical repeat lengths [22]. And while ARs are
frequently non-functional, they are not always non-functional [24]. Such effects have the potential to bias conclusions built on AR-based substitution rate calculations,
thus must be understood and accounted for.
Outline of the paper
In this work, we analyze the correlations of local neutral
substitution rates in three independent mammalian lineages using a stringent set of ancestral repeat sequences
obtained from UCSC mammalian alignments. We first
examine the correlation of substitution rates from all
orthologous repeats. From this we find that, although
local neutral substitution rates exhibit statistically significant correlations across these lineages, these effects are too
weak to have much practical predictive power (r2 < 5%).
We then resolve contributions from different length scales
in the genome – determining whether the correlations are
due to broad regional similarities, or just the singular
behavior of individual repeat elements. We find that there
are substantial regional effects on the scale of 10–500 kb,
as well as additional effects at shorter length scales. Following this, we investigate the behavior of individual AR
families, finding that although most families exhibit weak
correlations, a few appear to be more strongly correlated
due to the influence of purifying selection. Finally, we
demonstrate the robustness of our observations to variations in methodology, such as CpG corrections, different
substitution rate models, and dataset choice.

Results
Here we briefly summarize our Methods. Our calculations
are based on the alignment of ARs in the 17-way multiple
alignment blocks from the UCSC Genome database [25].
We calculated the rate for a particular lineage from the
alignments of pairs of species within that lineage (specifically: human against macaque for the primate lineage,
mouse against rat for the rodent lineage, and dog against
cow for the laurasiatheria lineage). We used only repeats
that have been annotated by RepeatMasker in both of the
species relevant to each calculation [6] – a more stringent
filtering method than other approaches. Simple and low
complexity repeats were excluded. To correct for uncertainty in the multiple alignment, we discarded blocks
whose synteny was inconsistent with local orthologous

genes. We restricted our analysis to autosomes in order to
avoid the biases potentially introduced by sex chromosome recombination rate [26]. Using these aligned repeat
elements, we measured the raw fraction of differing sites
and normalized these rates with a finite size correction,
yielding a z-score substitution rate for each repeat in each
lineage [1]. Hence each z-score rate quantifies the deviation of the given repeat's substitution rate from the
genomic mean.
Rate Correlations Across Species
We first measured substitution rates in ancestral repeats
from three lineages on a whole-genome scale. The resulting dataset has: ~740,000 repeats from the human/
macaque alignment, covering 92.8 Mb; ~120,000 repeats
from the mouse/rat alignment, covering 12.6 Mb; and
~620,000 repeats from the dog/cow alignment covering
63 Mb. Calculating raw substitution rates (fraction of differing sites), we find rates of 0.0570, 0.1277 and 0.2416
for human/macaque, mouse/rat and dog/cow respectively
(Table 1).

We then measured the correlation of ancestral repeat substitution rates for orthologous loci in the three lineages.
Overall, the Pearson correlations of orthologous local
substitution rates (z-score normalized) are small for all
three lineage comparisons: (r = 0.098 for primate vs.
rodent, 0.124 for primate vs. laurasiatheria, and 0.216 for
laurasiatheria vs. rodent), though they are significantly
different from zero (details are given in Additional file 1).
In Figure 1 we show scatter plots of the z-score rates in
pairs of lineages. None of the plots show any strong linear
trend, visually supporting the low correlation values.
These correlations are quite similar on each chromosome
as well (data not shown).
These small correlation coefficients are robust to the substitution rate model – other rate inference models yield
correlation coefficients which are either comparable in
value or weaker. Using the raw substitution rate , we
found slightly weaker correlations: primate – rodent
0.092, primate – laurasiatheria 0.083, laurasiatheria –
rodent 0.155. Also, application of the Jukes-Cantor model
to correct for the effect of multiple substitutions per site
resulted in even weaker correlations (primate – rodent: r =

0.058; primate – laurasiatheria: r = 0.083; laurasiatheria –
rodent; r = 0.135).
Although these correlations have statistically significant pvalues, they have relatively little predictive power. The r2
values, which indicate the fraction of the variance in the
rates in one lineage explained by the rates in another lineage, are extremely weak: primate – rodent 0.96%, primate – laurasiatheria 1.24%, and laurasiatheria – rodent
4.6% for z-score rates, and even less for other rate measures. For raw substitution rates, the standard deviations of
rates are each only a fraction of the genome-wide mean
values (40% of the mean for primate, 32% for rodent, and
21% for laurasiatheria). Consequently, the low r2 values
indicate that even a repeat with a substitution rate that is
multiple standard deviations away from the mean in one
lineage would not be expected to have a raw substitution
rate much different from the mean in another lineage.
The Scale of Correlation
While we have observed correlations between local rates,
it is not yet clear whether this is due to broad regional
effects or to outlying rate values of just a few repeats. Substitution rates in any given genome are known to vary by
region (in blocks as large as 10 Mb [17,27]), and if this
regional structure is consistent across genomes it could
explain the observed correlations. However, if the
regional structure is not consistent across genomes, correlations might instead be explained by a few intermittent
repeats that are unusually correlated due to selective pressures.

To determine the importance of regional effects on the
correlations, we employed a procedure that corrects for
potential regional effects. In the original method, we normalized the substitution rate of each repeat with respect to
the genome wide average substitution rate. In the modified procedure, we instead normalized the substitution
rate of each repeat with respect to the average substitution
rate of all repeats within a local bin (see Methods for
details). We used 12 different bin sizes, ranging from 25
Mb down to 2.5 kb. Our expectation was that for large bin
sizes, correlations would behave in a manner similar to
the original genome-wide correlations. As bin sizes
decreased, we expected that local regional effects would be

subsumed by the local normalization, causing correlations to decrease.
The results of this procedure are shown in Figure 2.
Indeed, we found that the correlation decreased as the size
of the local normalizing bin decreased. For bin sizes of 1
Mb–5 Mb, the correlations have a value about 90% of the
genome-wide correlations. At ~10–50 kb, the correlations
are one half of their full correlation values. Correlations
decrease monotonically with decreasing bin size.

Comparisons of substitution rates in orthologous ancestral
Comparisons of substitution rates in orthologous
ancestral repeat sequences from separate mammalian lineages. Z-score normalized rates for each repeat
were calculated in the three lineages: primate, rodent and
laurasiatheria. In each pair-wise comparison of lineages (the
three graphs), rates are shown for every ancestral repeat
having well-defined orthology among the four species. Pearson correlations r for each pair of lineages were found to be
significant but with low predictive power (r2 < 5%) in each of
the three comparisons.

These results, together with Figure 2, indicate that much of
the correlation is due to regional effects on the order of
~10–500 kb, thus acting on a more limited scale than the
factors dictating substitution rates (there are blocks of up
to ~10 Mb in which the observed substitution rate is relatively consistent[17]). Why do these scales differ? It
appears that lineage-specific evolution has altered the
regional pattern of substitution over time, causing the
longest blocks to differ from one species to the next.
Repeat Classes and Selection
We next examined the substitution rate correlation in specific repeat classes and subclasses (Figure 3). We noticed

Scaling behavior of rate correlations

the substitution rate of each repeat with respect to the average substitution rate in its local neighborhood, varying the bin size
and hence the scope of the neighborhood. We then recalculated the correlations as a function of bin size. While the correlations are stable for bin sizes larger than 500 kb, they decrease in all three comparisons as the bin size becomes smaller. These
results indicate that much of the correlations are due to regional effects on the scale of ~10–500 kb.

that of the four major repeat classes (LINEs, SINEs, LTRs
and DNA), LINEs have a slightly higher correlation than
do the other classes. This effect is particularly apparent in
the rodent – laurasiatheria comparison. Nevertheless, the
r2 value for LINEs in this comparison is still less than 11%;
the actual substitution rates of LINEs do not differ noticeably from the other classes. (For details see Additional file
2.)

correlations appear to have been influenced by natural
selection. For example, the most correlated repeat subclasses for primate – laurasiatheria, regardless of abundance, are listed in Table 2 (with data for the other two
comparisons given in Additional file 4). These have been
sorted by z-score, where a positive z-score indicates that
the subclass has a stronger correlation than the genomewide correlation (see Methods). In addition, repeat sub-

Subclasses within each of these main classes show substantial diversity in their correlations. Most subclasses
exhibit correlations smaller than the genome wide correlation (Additional File 3). Thus low r2 values are the norm,
in spite of the varying base compositions and dinucleotide contents in each repeat subclass. However, a few
have higher correlations. For example, among the 20 most
abundant repeat subclasses (Additional File 3), those with
above average correlations are MIR3, L3, L4, L1M5, and
L1MEc in primate – rodent; L3 and L1ME4a in primate –
laurasiatheria; and L3, L2, L4 and MIR3 in rodent – laurasiatheria. So multiple LINE subclasses contribute to the
strong overall correlation for LINEs in Figure 3.

Repeat subclasses with high rate correlations
Repeat subclasses with high rate correlations. The repeats shown are those having correlation of ≥ 0.35 in at least one
of the three lineage comparisons. Several of these (7SK, Charlie8, MER103, Charlie11, MER121, and MARNA), are likely to
have been influenced by purifying selection, as they also exhibit lower than average substitution rates in all three lineages.

classes with the very strongest correlations (r > 0.35 in at
least one of the three lineage comparisons) are shown in
Figure 4. Notably, the repeat subclasses 7SK, Charlie8,
MER103, Charlie11, MER121, and MARNA in Figure 4, as
well as L3b from Table 2, all exhibit lower than average
substitution rates in all three lineages (Additional File 5).
This strongly suggests the influence of selective pressure
on these families. Several of these repeat subclasses have
been previously suggested to be functional as well [2830]. The highest correlation for any repeat subclass is for
the RNA repeat subclass 7SK, in the primate – rodent comparison. 7SK is known to mediate the inhibition of general transcription elongation factor P-TEFb by the
HEXIM1 protein [31].
Robustness of Correlations
Robustness to CpG removal
It is well-known that CpG dinucleotides are subjected to
higher substitution rates because of the hypermutability
of methlated cytosine in a CpG dinucleotide [32]. To
account for this effect, we masked out the CpG dinucleotides in our alignments and recalculated the rates. As
expected, the overall raw substitution rates after masking
were lower (0.0494, 0.117 and 0.232 for primate, rodent
and laurasiatheria, respectively – Table 1). The correlations of the substitution rates were, however, not noticeably affected. The r2 values remained < 5% in all cases

(primate – rodent: r = 0.103, primate – laurasiatheria: r =
0.105, laurasiatheria – rodent: r = 0.223. Details are in
Additional file 6).
Robustness to orthology constraint
Our method of defining the dataset for each lineage comparison (i.e. using those aligned repeats with identical
RepeatMasker annotation in the four species in question)
is subject to a sampling bias that depends on species divergence. For more diverged species pairs (e.g. cow-dog) the
orthologous sequences will differ more and alignable
sequences may tend to be more conserved [33]. This could
introduce a slight distortion into the dataset, which would
explain the stronger correlations for comparisons involving cow-dog.

To test the strength of this effect, we modified our procedure to treat all lineages equally. In the altered procedure,
we identified all orthologous repeats with consistent
RepeatMasker annotations in all six species and then
measured correlations in pairs of lineages using only data
from this set. This resulted in correlation values of primate
– rodent: r = 0.111, primate – laurasiatheria: r = 0.190,
and laurasiatheria – rodent: r = 0.212. These correlations
are only slightly stronger than those for the original calculations, and r2 remains less than 4.5% in all cases. This
indicates that sampling bias is not a serious complication.

Robustness to reference genome
When computing substitution rates for a particular lineage comparison, we implicitly required that the ARs be
orthologous in all four species as well as human (if human
is not one of the four). This additional requirement is an
implicit effect of using the UCSC MultiZ alignments,
which uses the human genome as a reference, but has the
potential to introduce a bias into our results.

To test the impact of using human as the reference
genome on the correlations, we recalculated them from a
17-way multiple alignment with mouse as the reference
(one of the alternative MultiZ alignments available from
UCSC). Once again, all r2 values were small (< 0.06). The
observed Pearson correlations were primate – rodent:
0.111, primate – laurasiatheria: 0.166, and laurasiatheria
– rodent: 0.231, which are similar to the results when
using human as the reference. Repeat subclasses that
showed strong correlation when calculated from the
human reference also did so when using the mouse reference – despite the considerably smaller dataset resulting
from use of the mouse reference. We conclude that our
results do not significantly depend on which reference
genome is used for the alignments.

Discussion
Weak correlations
Overall we have found that correlation effects are weak (r2
d 5%), implying that knowledge of the local substitution
rate in one lineage has little impact on predicting substitution rates in another lineage. This result is robust in
comparisons involving primate, rodent, and laurasiatheria, and it is not sensitive to CpG effects, orthology constraints, or the choice of reference genome. How general is
this conclusion throughout the mammals? We chose the
six species in this paper because they are in independent
lineages at varying phylogenetic distances, are among the
best sequenced genomes, and have high fractions of
aligned sequence that includes several thousand repeats
per chromosome even in the genomes with the least data
available. These characteristics suggest that our findings
are representative of the mammalian phylogeny. However, it is possible the species we have analyzed contain
some lineage-specific behaviors. For example, it is known
that the rodent lineage has more lineage-specific repeats
and fewer ancestral repeats than other mammals, as well
as a higher overall substitution rate [22]. The relatively
low divergence between human and macaque could also
be a concern, though this is in principle accounted for by
the z-score rate normalizations.

To further test the robustness of the results, we analyzed
the correlation of ancestral repeat substitution rates in the
laurasiatheria lineage vs. the independent afrotheria lineage (represented by tenrec and elephant). This analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/89

was motivated by a recent work of Prakash and Tompa
[34], who reported that the tenrec/elephant tracks of the
UCSC 17-way alignments are comparable in quality to
dog/cow, and in coverage to mouse/rat. The laurasiatheria
normalized rates correlate with the afrotheria rates at r =
0.27 (r2 = 7.3%), which is only modestly larger than the
largest correlation we had previously observed. This supports the general conclusion of weak correlations. For the
variety of evolutionary distances between various mammalian lineages[17,35], our intuitive expectation is that
lineages separated by greater distances should have
weaker correlations.
Are substitution rates correlated in species that are more
closely related than the lineages we have examined here?
Orthologous human and chimp repeats are so closely
related that stochastic effects can make it difficult to infer
the local substitution rate (the raw 4-fold site substitution
rate is ~5× larger in human-macaque than in humanchimpanzee) [12]. However, Hodgkinson et al. recently
found orthologous repeats exhibiting similar SNP patterns in human and chimp, suggesting that, at least for
some loci, substitution rates can be preserved for a few
million years[36].
One potential concern about the use of repetitive
sequences is that their substitution rates may have been
more influenced by gene conversion than other neutral
segments. Our data show that virtually all repeat families,
regardless of their susceptibility to gene conversion,
exhibit weak rate correlations. If gene conversion were relevant to our findings, we would expect the magnitude of
its influence on a particular family to be proportional to
the copy number of that family. However, for the top 20
most abundant repeat families, every family has a primate-rodent correlation < 0.16, despite a 25-fold range in
copy numbers (details and other lineage comparisons in
Additional File 3). Gene conversion is also known to
engender higher substitution rates, as well as increased
GC content resulting from biased conversion[37]. Though
among the 20 most abundant families, rate correlations
show little sign of association with either GC content (primate-rodent association p-value = 0.6) or with substitution rate (p-value = 0.2).
Our results shed light on previous observations of the correlations of synonymous substitution rate between lineages[1]. Synonymous substitution rates are more difficult
to analyze than substitution rates in repeats, as synonymous rates are noticeably influenced by sites subject to
selection. While synonymous rate correlations are larger
than for repeats (r2~9% between the human-dog lineage
and the rat-mouse lineage), the correlations are still relatively small. This suggests that our observations for
repeats are representative of how neutral substitution

rates change over time, rather than some peculiarity of
repeat sequences.
Relevance for Phylogenetic Footprinting
While the correlations we observe both here and in previous analysis of synonymous substitution rates [1] are all
statistically significant, the correlations are too weak to
provide much predictive power between lineages. This
low predictive power is of crucial importance in the context of phylogenetic footprinting – the detection of functional sequences based on their conservation beyond
neutral expectations [38-40]. The implicit assumption in
phylogenetic footprinting is that sequences detected by
the method have strong conservation because they are
under natural selection.

Theoretically, if local neutral rates are correlated across
species, a conserved block could arise from the persistence
of orthologous neutral substitution cold spots without
involving selection. However, the low r2 values we report
here show that persistent substitution cold spots are
unlikely to be responsible for more than a small fraction
of sequences which have been identified by phylogenetic
footprinting. Furthermore, we have found that much of
the preserved rate structure occurs at scales of several hundred kb or longer (a related study by Tykucheva et al. also
found rate correlations across species in a study of 1 Mb
blocks using a different methodology and dataset [3]).
This is a scale much larger than the elements identified by
phylogenetic footprinting, which are typically only a few
hundred bp long. This discordance in length scales further
limits persistent substitution coldspots as an explanation
for elements detected by phylogenetic footprinting.
Selective Pressure
Although our intent in analyzing this ancestral repeat data
was to study neutral effects, selection still appears to be a
factor. The repeats with the lowest substitution rates –
those most likely to be under negative selective pressure –
contribute more strongly to the correlations than other
repeats. On the other hand, lineage specific selection
could also cause divergent substitution rates in some
repeats. But given the neutrality of a majority of repeats[24,19], this should on the whole be a minor effect.

Overall, repeats with strong phastCons scores – a measure
of selective pressure via phylogenetic footprinting [40] –
have correlations substantially greater than those of the
remaining repeats. For repeats with phastCons score > 0.9
(~10% of our data) we see r = 0.113 for primate – rodent,
0.173 for primate – laurasiatheria, and 0.247 for laurasiatheria – rodent. For the remaining repeats, we have r =
0.045, 0.090 and 0.064 respectively (details in Additional
file 7). Such results confirm that purifying selection is
responsible for much of the substitution rate correlations.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/89

We find similar results when we compare correlations in
the repeats with the top 10% vs those with the lowest 10%
of substitution rates. These results imply that the r2 d 7%
correlations are an upper bound on the contributions from
persistent neutral substitution rates. The true neutral component should be even weaker.
The influence of selection is consistent with recent studies
that have found evidence of the functionality of certain
repeats or repeat classes. For example, Siepel et al. have
estimated that about 3.7% of all elements with high
phastCons scores are ancestral repeats [40]. Some of these
functions may be cis-regulatory [28] or the result of
regaining of transposon activity, known as domestication
[24,41-46]. It has been estimated that about 0.05 of
human transposons are currently active [47].
A number of repeat classes with strong substitution rate
correlations are likely to be under selection. For example,
Kamal et al. reported that MER121, L3b, L3, MARNA,
MER103, MER102b, Charlie8, L1ME4a are highly conserved in human, dog, rat, and mouse [28]. These groups
have some of the highest correlations in our data set. Lowe
et al. found functional elements with strong sequence
conservation derived from repeats close to developmental
genes, notably MER121, L3b and L3 (CR1), L4(RTE) and
MARNA(Mariner)[29], which also exhibit strong correlations in our data. Additionally, we found a few repeat subclasses with high rate correlation that have not been
previously discussed; these include 7Sk, MER54A,
Charlie11 and MLT2B2. It would be worthwhile to further
investigate their possible functionality. Jurka examined
the overlap of the repetitive families with the evolutionarily conserved, potential cis-regulatory regions. Unfortunately, with the exception of MER1232, repeat elements
discussed in his paper are not significantly present in our
data [30].
What do these repeats elements under strong selection tell
us about phylogenetic footprinting? These elements can
artificially suppress the "neutral" substitution rate if there
are a large number of them in a given block. In such a case,
removing such repeats will improve the estimation of the
background model used in the phylogenetic footprinting.

Conclusion
In this work we have shown that mammalian local neutral
substitution rates are largely lineage-specific, suggesting
that it is best to estimate substitution rates from singlespecies data whenever possible [2,5,7,19]. Some correlations in substitution rates in repeat sequences exist, but, as
for silent sites, these have been influenced by nucleotides
under purifying selection. Much of the remaining neutral
correlations are due to effects at large length scales from
10–500 kb. These findings indicate that most highly con-

served mammalian sequences detected are indeed under
natural selection, rather than the result of persistent local
neutral substitution rates.

Methods
Dataset
We obtained multiple alignments of 17 vertebrates, calculated both from a human reference and a mouse reference,
from the UCSC genome browser (hg18/multiz17way and
mm8/multiz17way). From that data we extracted the
alignments of human, macaque, mouse, rat, cow and dog.
Additionally we obtained the RepeatMasker repeat annotations for each of these genomes from the UCSC genome
browser. These annotations were generated using the
"sensitive" option. We excluded simple and low complexity repeats, satellites, and primate specific Alu repeat families. We used Perl scripts and Berkeley DB to store and
process repeat annotation data in each species.

To improve the quality of our dataset, we restricted our
analysis to repeats having synteny consistent with nearby
genes. We constructed a synteny map from one-to-one
orthologous genes between both human/dog and
human/mouse, which we downloaded from Biomart [48]
in Ensembl [49]. 0.5% of total alignment blocks were discarded because they were non-syntenic. We also used
AutoGRAPH [50], a web based synteny visualization tool,
to inspect synteny structures.
When comparing two lineages we chose members of our
repeat dataset using the following conditions: 1) Each
repeat has an orthologous sequence in all four of the species in the two lineages, 2) Each repeat has an orthologous
sequence in the reference sequence (human or mouse,
depending on the run), and 3) Each repeat has an identical RepeatMasker classification in the reference sequence
and all four alignment species. The first condition influences the background substitution rate, since the average
rate obtained from 2-way ortholog alignments is typically
higher than those of 4-way ortholog alignments. The second condition allows us to derive a consistent syntenic set
in each comparison of lineages. The third condition provides stringency in the dataset, a feature which distinguishes our study from previous investigations [3]. The
stringency of our conditions may bias the data set toward
conserved repeat elements. However, without stringency
we risk being adversely influenced by the large fraction of
repeats with questionable orthology (~60% of human
repeats are aligned to non-repeats in mouse and rat in the
UCSC alignments). Our conditions are overall similar to
those of prior studies of orthologous repeat elements
[28,33,51,52].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/89

Normalized substitution rates
We characterized local substitution rates and measured
cross species correlations using a z-score model which has
been described previously [1], for several reasons. The zscore approach has the advantage of correcting for finite
size effects in each block. To calculate the z-score, we first
measured the fraction of non-matching sites (the raw substitution rate) for a given aligned orthologous pair. We
then normalized based on the expected standard deviation given the repeat length. The expected standard deviation of a repeat containing N bases was calculated from
that
expected
of
a
binomial
distribution,

s (N ) =

m (1 − m ) / N where the bar indicates a genome

wide average. This standard deviation was then used to
rescale the raw substitution rate i to a normalized rate

r i ≡ (m i − m ) / s (N ) for a locus i, where the bar indicates
a genome wide average. This yields a rate distribution that
is zero-centered and whose standard deviation is of order
1. This zero-centering makes the rates insensitive to features that influence absolute substitution rates, such as the
generation times in each lineage[53].
The scale of correlation
We first calculated the average raw substitution rate in
bins (of variable size s) along the genome. We then used
these local average substitution rates to calculate normal-

ized rates , as an alternative to the rates calculated using
the genome-wide rate m for the normalization. Correlations of across lineages were then calculated as a function
of the bin size s. Let the raw substitution rate at repeat i be
i,

and let m st indicate the average raw substitution rate of

all repeats in a bin of size s around locus i. A binned normalized substitution rate can be then written as

r i ≡ (m i − m st ) / m st (1 − m st ) / N . By changing the bin
size, we are able to measure how important different
length scales are to the rate correlation.
Correlation z-scores for repeat subclasses
The z-score for a repeat subclass is defined as z = (rsc - r)/
(rsc) where rsc is the correlation of the repeat subclass (sc),
r is the genome wide rate correlation, and (rsc) the standard deviation among the rate correlations over all repeat
subclasses. This z-score is used to rank the strength of correlations among different classes. Positive z-scores indicate an above-average correlation and negative z-scores
indicate below-average.
