Abstract
Background: While numerous studies revealed the major role of environmental changes of the
Quaternary on the evolution of biodiversity, research on the influence of that period on current
South-American fauna is scarce and have usually focused on lowland regions. In this study, the
genetic structure of the pampas cat (Leopardus colocolo), a widely distributed felid, was determined
and linked to ancient climate fluctuations on the Andean region.
Results: Using both mitochondrial sequences and nuclear microsatellites, we inferred the
existence of at least four groups of populations in the central Andes, while other three localities,
with little sample sizes (n = 3), presented differences in only one of these markers. The distribution
of these groups is correlated to latitude, with a central area characterized by admixture of
numerous mitochondrial clades. This suggests colonization from at least three glacial refuges and a
contact zone between 20 degrees and 23 degrees S following a glaciation event. The similar
coalescence times of the mitochondrial haplotypes indicated that the major clades split
approximately one million years ago, likely during the Pre-Pastonian glacial period (0.80 – 1.30
MYA), followed by a demographic expansion in every clade during the Aftonian interglacial period
(0.45 – 0.62 MYA). Interestingly, this structure roughly corresponds to the current recognised
distribution of morphological subspecies.
Conclusion: The four groups of populations identified here must be considered different
management units, and we propose the three localities showing differences in only mtDNA or
ncDNA as provisional management units. The results revealed the influence of ancient climate
fluctuations on the evolutionary history of this species. It is expected that the other species of land
vertebrates with a smaller or similar mobility have been affected in the same manner by the glacial
and interglacial periods in the central Andes

Background
Previous bio- and phylogeographic studies in the northern hemisphere revealed the major role of the Quaternary
in the evolution of biodiversity. Important climatic fluctuations resulted in alternations of glacial and interglacial
periods that profoundly influenced the distribution of
habitats, dispersal and isolation among populations [e.g.
[1-4]]. In South America, climate fluctuation periods were
equivalent to those known for the northern hemisphere
[5,6]. During the glacial periods, glacier boundaries
descended hundreds of meters, and advanced dramatically in the southern part of the continent [5,7,8]. In the
central Andes, although late Quaternary glaciations eliminated the material evidence of glacier advances older
than 200 000 years [5], research has shown that the distribution of plant species and habitats cycled with climatic
changes, descending to lower elevations during periods of
reduced temperature [9,10]. However, studies on the
influence of the Quaternary on current South-American
biodiversity are scarce and have usually focused on lowland regions [11,12].
Species with broad ranges of distribution can be informative regarding glacial refugia, dispersal pathways and contact zones [13,14] and, then, provide useful insights about
the role of climatic changes on biodiversity. The pampas
cat (Leopardus colocolo) displays a large distribution in
South America, from Central Ecuador to Patagonia, in a
variety of habitats [15,16]. Based on morphological characteristics, between 8 and 11 subspecies are currently recognized [15,17,18] and the scission of this taxon into
three different species was proposed by García-Perea [17]:
L. colocolo for populations distributed on the western
slope of the southern Andes; L. pajeros distributed along
the Andes; and L. braccatus found to the east of the Andes,
in Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Previous studies performed on mitochondrial genome [19,20] also revealed
that the Andean pampas cat populations are genetically
structured and may have experienced significant and
lengthy periods of isolation and reduced gene flow.
In spite of its wide distribution, the pampas cat is one of
the less known felids [21] and its status is affected by a
variety of threats, comprising habitat loss and fragmentation, hunting for traditional reasons and decline of prey
populations [22,23]. Lack of evaluation of its conservation status through its range causes the pampas cat to be
considered as vulnerable [24] and to be included in the
IUCN Near Threatened (NT) category [25].
The aim of the present study was to link the genetic diversity of the pampas cat throughout the central Andes to
ancient climate fluctuations. To address this objective, the
genetic structure of the pampas cat in 19 localities over a
distance of more than 4000 km was inferred with both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/68

mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, using non-invasive
sampling.

Results
Species identification and mtDNA variability
A total of 39 skin samples and 532 faecal samples from 19
localities were analyzed (Figure 1; Table 1). Of the faecal
samples, 406 were unambiguously assigned to pampas
cats according to the mtDNA 16S region. The remaining
samples were assigned to Andean cats Leopardus jacobita
(40), domestic cats (11) or canid species (32). A small
number of faecal samples (43) failed to be amplified and
could not be identified. All skins were assigned to pampas
cats.

The length of two mitochondrial control region segments
combined varied between 336 and 351 bp. Two variable
mononucleotide repeats (T)3–7 (C)3–11 were identified but
not considered for the analyses. Without considering the
RS2 region composed of a variable number of large tandem repeats, the pampas cat HVS-I region contains
between 178 and 190 bp (Figure 2). The range known for
other felid species is 231–245 bp [26-28].
SSCP analyses revealed a single allele per sample, excluding the presence of mtDNA sequences transferred into the
nuclear genome (Numts) [28]. The SSCP survey of the
406 samples and the sequencing revealed a total of 41
HVS-I haplotypes and 94 variable sites. Phylogenetic relationships inferred among these haplotypes were consistent for both NJ and ML methods. The haplotypes
clustered into four major clades, named hereafter A to D,
strongly supported by bootstrap values (Figure 3). However, relationships among clades were not completely
resolved.
Sequencing of the NADH-5 and ATP-8 genes revealed 29
sites of additional variation for the 19 individuals selected
from our sample. These individuals were selected randomly, with the constraints of choosing individuals with
different HVS-I haplotypes and covering all the major
HVS-I clades. The phylogenetic tree inferred using both
the NADH-5 and ATP-8 genes was fully congruent with
the one performed with HVS-I and allowed the four major
clades to be recovered, while the resolution was lower.
When individuals from previous studies [20,29] were
included into the present dataset, a total of 41 variable
sites was detected for NADH-5 and ATP-8 genes. Most of
these additional individuals clustered within clade B (15)
and D (3) (Figure 4) while individuals geographically distant from the Andean region, located in central Chile and
Brazil, formed two additional clades. Interestingly, individuals presenting HVS-I haplotypes of the clades A and C
formed two clusters not identified by previous studies.

After the total number of pampas cat samples, number of skin samples is indicated in parentheses. Number of individuals as identified from
microsatellite data.

Individual identification and population diversity
Microsatellite amplifications provided results for 290
(71%) of the 406 pampas cat faecal samples and for the
39 skin samples (100%) for a total of 329 samples. The
microsatellites were highly variable, with 10–21 alleles
per locus (Table 2) and the probability of sampling two
different individuals with the same genotype ranged
between 4.80 × 10-3 and 2.88 × 10-16. Unique multilocus
genotypes were recorded for 99 faecal samples (30%).
However, in several cases, two or more samples displayed
the very same multilocus genotype indicating that the
same individual had been sampled several times. According to the low probability of obtaining the same genotype
in different individuals, samples with the same genotype
were assigned to a unique individual, providing a final
sample size of 199 pampas cat individuals. The number of
individuals per locality varied from 5 to 30, except for 6
localities that had a sample size of 4 individuals or less
(Table 1). Localities with sampling size lower than four
individuals were not included in the following analyses,
unless mentioned in the text.

The total number of alleles per population ranged from
17 to 48 (Table 2), but was correlated to sampling size
(Pearson's r = 0.915, P < 0.0001). The total number of
alleles estimated for 5 individuals per population (allelic
richness, FSTAT 2.9.3) [30] ranged from 17.16 to 24.85,
showing little variation between populations. The

expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.35 to 0.93 (Table
2) and was not correlated to sampling size (r = 0.013, P =
0.960). None of the localities displayed deviation from
HW expectations, indicating that no more than one population was sampled per locality.
For the mtDNA control region, the number of haplotypes
per population ranged from 2 to 14 (Table 2) and was also
correlated to sampling size (r = 0.884, P < 0.0001). Haplotype diversity values ranged from 0.60 to 0.93 between
the sampled localities, and nucleotide diversity varied by
one order of magnitude between 0.0059 and 0.0519.
Population structure
The best value of the ln Pr(X|K) obtained with the program STRUCTURE on microsatellite data corresponded to
K = 3 population groups. These groups included the localities (2–6, 8, 9), (11, 14) and (15–18). Relationships
among populations inferred from the microsatellite data
supported this grouping, although bootstrap values
between populations 2–6, 8 and 9 were low (Figure 5A).
AMOVA analysis also supported this structure as the one
displaying the highest variation among groups on either
mitochondrial or microsatellite data (Table 3).

The distribution of the groups of populations appeared to
be clearly correlated to latitude (Figure 6). The first group
occupies the area north to 18°S and is formed almost

Evolutionary and demographic history
Based on the HVS-I sequences, the coalescence times of
the clades [A, B, C and D], [A – B], and [C – D] were estimated to 1.52 MY ago (with a confidence interval from
1.05 to 2.21 MYA), 1.37 MY ago (0.95 – 2) and 1.17 (0.81
– 1.7) MY ago respectively. Interestingly, the radiation of
the clades A, B, C and D occurred almost simultaneously,
with coalescence times of 0.43, 0.39, 0.54 and 0.44 MY
ago, respectively. The results for Tamura-Nei distances
between clades, coalescence times and confidence intervals are presented in Figure 7.

Discussion
Genetic diversity
Previous research has shown that pampas cats present a
large genetic diversity at the species level [19]. Results of
the present study indicate that a large diversity is also
present at populations level and that it is comparable to
other non-endangered felid species, like the ocelot and
margay [27]. Although we reported a higher HVS-I genetic
diversity for some pampas cat populations (P = 2.35 –
19.70; Table 2) than for those species (P = 3.71 – 14.73)
[27] this can be explained by bigger samples and the presence of highly divergent clades in the most diverse pampas cat populations (Figure 6).

exclusively by individuals of the clade A. The second
group, distributed between 20° and 23°S, presents a great
proportion of individuals of clade C, although clades B
and D are present too. The third group, distributed south
to 25°S, contains principally clade D individuals, with
some clade B and C individuals in its northern region. The
northernmost and the southernmost sampled localities
are represented by private haplotypes of the clades A and
D, respectively.
Including all localities did not modify the results provided
by STRUCTURE: (1–10), (11, 13–14) and (12, 15–19)
(Figure 5B) and the population structure remains strongly
correlated to geography except for population 12. While
geography and mtDNA data suggested including this population in the group (11–13–14), the microsatellite data
suggested a closer affiliation with the southernmost group
(15–19).

Genetic structure and geographic distribution
Along the Andean region, analysis of mitochondrial and
nuclear genomes revealed the presence of three groups of
populations. These groups show a strong geographical
structure, with latitudinal separations at 18°–20°S and
23°–25°S. Including results of previous studies based
strictly on mitochondrial DNA indicated the existence of
a fourth group in northern Chile [20], as well as the two
groups out of the Andean region, in Brazil and central
Chile [19]. This genetic structure roughly corresponds to
the distribution of morphological subspecies described by
García Perea [17]. Two of the museum samples, both from
locality number 8, were identified as L. c. garleppi using
the descriptions done by García-Perea [17], although it
was not possible to directly assign a genotype to a morphotype for other localities due to the nature of the samples. However, according to the type localities of the
described subspecies, the pampas cat groups can be equivalent to garleppi (Clade A, 9°–18°S), budini (20°–23°S),
pajeros (25°–38°S) and wolffshoni (Clade B northern
Chile) subspecies (Figure 8).

The geographical location of populations 12 and 19 coincides with the subspecies steinbachi and crucinus, respectively, while population 1 is located between the
supposed distribution ranges of thomasi and garleppi (Figure 8). These three localities are characterized by private
HVS-I haplotypes or ncDNA that differs from that of adjacent populations, and had samples of only 3 individuals.

Pampas 2 hypervariable sequence I (HVS-I)
Pampas cat hypervariable sequence I (HVS-I). The position of the primers used in this study is shown. In this example,
the repeated sequence 2 (RS2) contains three tandem repeats named here a, b and c. Although the primer H1rev anneals on
the a, b and c repetitions and the primer H2for anneals on the a and b repetitions, only their positions on the sequences used
in this research are shown.

Since a small sample size per locality can affect the results
of the STUCTURE program [31] and other analyses, the
correspondence between these localities and subspecies
needs to be validated by further investigations. The further
assignation of these localities to subspecies can be of conservation value since many authors [i.e. [18,19]] do not
recognise steinbachi and crucinus as valid taxa. As this
research focused in the central Andean region, further
research must be made to describe the genetic structure of
the entire species.
The Andean area between 18° and 23°S, approximately,
corresponds to an extremely arid belt that separates a
northern area, with summer rains, from a southern one,
with winter rains [32,33]. This zone is considered to be a
barrier between subspecies of other land mammals such
as the vicuna Vicugna vicugna [34] and the lesser grison
Galictis cuja [35], and represents a distribution limit for
other species, like the long-tailed weasel Mustela frenata
[36]. In contrast, the genetic structure of the puma Puma
concolor from the high Andes is not affected by this barrier
[37], probably due to a higher dispersal capacity. The
pampas cat populations distributed between 18°S and
25°S display three different phenotypes [17] and an
important admixture of the clades typical of adjacent
areas, suggesting the arid belt as a contact zone.
Influence of Pleistocene
The topology of the mtDNA trees enabled us to infer two
periods of prime importance for the demographic history
of the pampas cat. The lack of resolution for the relationships between pampas cat clades (as well as among haplotypes within clades) suggests a rapid radiation.

A first episode comprised the split of the clades A, B, C and
D and occurred between the end of the Bramertonian
Interglacial (1.30 – 1.55 MYA) and the beginning of the

Pre-Pastonian glacial period (0.80 – 1.30 MYA; Figure 7).
The Pre-Pastonian corresponds with the most extensive
glaciations in southern South America [38]. This period
also coincides with the estimated date of the divergence
between the major clades of the Andean bird genus Muscisaxicola [39], suggesting this period as an important
phase in the diversification of the Andean fauna.
The very similar coalescence times of the current haplotypes of the clades A, B, C and D suggest these events took
place simultaneously, during a second demographic episode. These splits were likely to be the result of demographic expansions caused by geographically extended
phenomena associated with climate change. The calculated mean time for these events overlapped the end of the
Kansan glacial period (0.30 – 0.45 MYA) and the Aftonian
interglacial (0.45 – 0.62 MYA), the interglacial period
being the more likely moment of occurrence for these
demographic events (Figure 7).
Interestingly, the divergence time between clades A, B, C
and D is similar or longer than between some felid species, such as the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus, Canadian lynx
Lynx canadensis and Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx (between 1.18
and 1.61 MY), kodkod Leopardus guigna, little spotted cat
Leopardus tigrinus andGeoffroy's cat Leopardus geoffroyi
(0.74–0.93 MY) and ocelot and margay (1.58 MY) [40].
High diversity within clades, times of divergence and
monophyletic origin in most of the regions indicated
long-term isolation into distinct refuges (glacial)/regions
(interglacial) rather than dispersal from a unique refuge.
No Pleistocene refugia were previously identified in the
central Andes for medium-sized mammals. However,
considering the current distribution of the clades and the
zones apparently less affected by the glaciations [5], clade
A refuge probably existed in central Peru, while clade B

and clade D refuges were possibly located in northern
Chile and eastern Argentina, respectively. Clade C refuge
was probably placed in eastern Bolivia. Individuals with
haplotypes of clades B, C and D would subsequently
migrate to a contact zone between 20 and 23°S during an
interglacial
period.
Implications for conservation

servation below the species level. Although the use of the
ESUs concept and its importance for prioritising conservation efforts is currently well accepted, its definition was
strongly debated [43]. Many authors consider reciprocal
monophyly as mandatory for the recognition of ESUs, as
proposed by Moritz [42], or subspecies, while for other
definitions a different evolutionary history between populations is sufficient [41,44-46]. MUs, in the other hand,
are defined as population units with statistically significant differences of allelic frequencies at nuclear or mitochondrial level [42].

The locality numbers correspond to those on the Table 1. Mean values were calculated with the localities with more than 4 individuals only. Total
values were calculated for the entire sample. n = sample size; H = number of haplotypes; hd = haplotype diversity; S = number of polymorphic sites;
P = percentage of variable sites; π = nucleotid diversity; k = number of alleles; HE = expected heterozygosity.

The long divergence time among clades, as well as the differentiation at the ncDNA level, highlight the importance
of recognizing the four pampas cat population groups
identified here (localities 2–10/11, 13–14/15–18/northern Chile) as different units for conservation in the
Andean region. Since they have different allelic frequencies at both, mtDNA and ncDNA levels, all of these groups
must to be recognised as MUs. In addition, we recommend the recognition of the localities 1, 12 and 19 as pro-

visional MUs, since only private haplotypes were found
for them (localities 1 and 19) or they differ at ncDNA level
from adjacent MUs (locality 12; Figure 8).
The existence of an admixture zone in the central Andean
region results in a lack of reciprocal monophyly between
all the four population groups and makes their recognition as subspecies or ESUs controversial. However, cases
of hybridization between subspecies or species are com-

with a smaller or similar mobility have been affected in
the same manner by the glacial and interglacial periods in
the central Andes and, hence, they show similar population structures at present, that should be considered for
the future study and conservation of the Andean fauna.

Methods
Study localities and sampling
A total of 39 skin samples and 532 faecal samples from 19
localities were analysed (Figure 1; Table 1). Samples were
collected in the Andes of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru, cov-

mon in nature [47], of particular interest being the identification of hybridization areas for tigrinas, Geoffroy's cats
and pampas cats [19,48]. In this sense, pampas cats from
central Andes can be regarded as a complex of at least four
ESUs/subspecies, one of them being the result of a past
hybridization event.

Conclusion
Through the analyses of both mitochondrial and nuclear
DNA, we inferred the population structure of the pampas
cat in a broad portion of the Andean region, showing the
existence of at least four groups of populations that must
be considered different management units, and three
other localities proposed here as provisional management
units. The results revealed the influence of ancient climate
fluctuations on the evolutionary history of this species,
suggesting the split of four mtDNA clades during the PrePastonian glacial period, long term isolation and further
population expansions during the Aftonian interglacial.
The pampas cat is a species with a relatively high mobility.
It is expected that the other species of land vertebrates

mately 0.5–1 cm2 was cut from the ear or, if that was not
possible, from other areas, and kept in individual paper
bags, in dry and cool conditions [50].
DNA extraction
DNA from skin samples was isolated by the standard
method of proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform
extraction and precipitation with ethanol [51]. DNA from
faeces was isolated with the QIAamp® DNA Stool Mini Kit
(QIAGEN, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the following two modifications:
i) instead of 180–220 mg, from 200 to 500 mg of the
superficial faecal material was used per sample, and ii) the
ASL buffer was heated to 70°C before being added to the
samples. To prevent and monitor the contamination of
the samples during the laboratory processes, pre-PCR and
post-PCR activities were carried out in different laboratories and negative controls were included in each batch of
extraction and amplification [52,53].
Species identification
Faecal samples were identified to the species level by a
PCR-RFLP method [54]. Briefly, a segment of 257–263 bp
of the 16S mitochondrial gene was amplified by PCR and
the product was exposed to the action of several restriction
enzymes, resulting in species-specific fragment profiles
which can be visualised on agarose gel.

ering more than 4350 km from 06°13'S to 41°07'S, with
the exception of 5 tissue samples collected in the Argentine Pampas lowland of Buenos Aires province. Faecal
samples were collected opportunistically in the field and
kept in paper bags surrounded by silica gel in excess or in
vials with ethanol for their transportation to the laboratory [49]. Once in the laboratory, samples were kept at 20°C, without silica gel, until DNA extraction. Skin samples were taken from stuffed animals owned by villagers
or from museum specimens. For skin samples, approxi-

MtDNA
The hypervariable domain 1 (HVS-I) of the mtDNA control region was selected because it is a non-coding
sequence that is expected to display high polymorphism
within felid species [27,55-57]. Because DNA from faeces
and ancient tissues is often degraded [58,59] and prevents
the amplification of the complete HVS-I, primers were
designed to amplify two short segments on the HVS-I. In
order to design these primers, the complete HVS-I region
was amplified using fresh tissues from four Peruvian pampas cats with the primers CH3F and CH3R developed by
Freeman et al. [56]. Both strands were sequenced with a
CEQ 8000XL DNA Analysis System (Beckman Coulter
Inc., Fullerton, Calif.). These sequences were aligned with
the HVS-I region of domestic cat (Gene Bank accession
number NC_001700), cheetah Acinonyx jubatus
(NC_00512), margay Leopardus wiedii (AF129663S1-2)
and ocelot Leopardus pardalis (AF129645S1-2) using the
program Clustal W [60]. Finally, sequences conserved
among species were used to design the felid-specific primers H1rev (5'-CCTGTACATGCTTAATATTC-3') and H2for
(5'-ACATAYTATGTATATCGTGC-3') which provide PCR
products smaller than 300 bp when used with CH3F and
CH3R primers, respectively (Figure 2).

Amplification reactions were carried out in a volume of
12.5 μl containing a final concentration of 20 mM Tris-

HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM of
each dNTP and 0.8 pM of each primer, 0.8 mg/ml of BSA,
0.2 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, and approximately 20
ng of template DNA. PCR conditions included an initial
denaturing step at 92°C for 2 min, 45 cycles of 92°C for
15 s, 52°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 30 s, and a final extension step at 68°C for 5 min. Mitochondrial DNA variation
was detected using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) [61]. The amplified products were electrophoresed on a 6% nondenaturing gel for 11 h 30' at 20 W
in 0.5× TBE [62] and visualized using silver nitrate staining [63]. A band was sliced from the gel for each of the different observed conformers and placed in a volume of 35
μl of HPLC-grade water overnight. 2 μl of the dissolved
DNA were used for amplification, and the products were
sequenced. Because H1rev and H2for primers fit on a
sequence of repeated tandems, called RS2 [28] (Figure 2),
the product amplified with the CH3F-H1rev pair of primers was sequenced only in the forward direction, while
that amplified with the H2for-CH3R primers was
sequenced only in reverse. When possible, at least two
individuals from different populations were sequenced
for each observed conformer, to confirm the reliability of
the SSCP protocol.
The mitochondrial genes NADH-5 (318 bp) and ATP-8
(191 bp) were sequenced for a sub-sample of 19 individuals, using the primers developed by Johnson et al. [29],
to compare the phylogenetic relationships of the sampled
individuals with pampas cats from other regions [20,29].
HVS-I, NADH-5 and ATP-8 sequences have been deposited in GeneBank (accession numbers FJ648644–
FJ648684, FJ664428–FJ664446 and FJ664409–FJ664427,
respectively).
Microsatellites
Five microsatellite loci isolated from domestic cats
(Fca24, Fca31, Fca45, Fca96 and Fca294) [64] were amplified and screened on acrylamide gels. Amplification reactions were carried out for all the pampas cat samples, with
the same PCR conditions indicated above for the mtDNA.
For the faecal samples, amplification and screening was
made three times, following the multiple tube approach
[65] and only the samples showing concordant results
were used for data analysis.
Data analysis
Measures of population genetic diversity, including nucleotide diversity (π) and haplotype diversity (hd) [66] were
estimated from mtDNA sequences using the computer
program ARLEQUIN 2.00 [67]. Exact tests of population
differentiation [68] with a 10000 Markov chain, and estimations of FST between pairs of localities [69] were performed with the same software.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/68

The phylogenetic relationships of the aligned sequences
were analysed by distance (neighbour joining, NJ) [70]
and maximum likelihood (ML) methods using the program PAUP 4.01b [71]. Gaps were treated as single haplotype variants. After an election using MODELTEST 3.7
[72], the Tamura-Nei model [73] was used for NJ and ML
analyses, assuming a gamma distribution for substitution
rates across sites (AIC = 2534.70283). Node support was
assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Sequences of the
equivalent control region segment from two ocelots and
two margays were used as outgroups. To assess the extent
of differentiation among regions and sampled localities,
we performed an analysis of molecular variance
(AMOVA) [74], with Φ-statistics, using ARLEQUIN 2.00
[67], with statistical significance tested using 10000 permutations. Several groupings were tested with AMOVA,
and the grouping that maximized differentiation among
regions and minimized differentiation among localities
within regions was assumed to represent to the most parsimonious geographical subdivisions.
To estimate the divergence times between different
groups, we considered the HVS-I region, a divergence time
of 2.91 MY between the pampas cat and the ocelot and the
margay, with a confidence interval between 2.02 and 4.25
MY [40], and the mean Tamura-Nei molecular distances
between haplotypes of the identified clades as calculated
in ARLEQUIN 2.00. All the identified haplotypes were
used for each clade. Regions corresponding to deletions or
insertions in different species were not considered for this
analysis.
For each microsatellite genotype, the probability that two
samples with the same genotype represent two different
individuals was calculated from the allele frequencies in
each sampled locality [75]. To obtain the value for the
complete genotype, probabilities for each locus were multiplied, assuming independence of loci, as supported by
the linkage map of microsatellite loci in the domestic cat
[64].
Measures of expected heterozygosity (HE) and number of
alleles (k) were estimated using the computer program
ARLEQUIN 2.00 [67]. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was
tested for each sampled locality with the method developed by Guo & Thompson [76] using GENEPOP 3.4 [77].
The population structure was examined for the microsatellite data by a Bayesian clustering method, using STRUCTURE 2.2 [78], with a 100000 burn-in period and 50000
MCMC repetitions, to infer the number of populations
(K) and to assign individuals to inferred population clusters. Additionally, a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree
of the sampled localities with five or more individuals was
constructed with the program POPULATIONS 1.2.28 [79]
with the microsatellite data, using Dce distances [80] and

200 bootstraps on locus. As for the mtDNA data, AMOVA
was performed on several groupings to test the population
structure.
