Abstract
Background: This study was conducted to characterize Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates
obtained from waterfowl from the Upper Midwest region of the United States. A total of 43 NDVs
were isolated by inoculation of cloacal samples in embryonated chicken eggs. These isolates were
obtained from 24 mallards, seven American green-winged teals, six northern pintails, four bluewinged teals, and two wood ducks. Partial sequences of fusion gene were analyzed to determine
the pathotypes and genotypes involved.
Results: Deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of fusion (F) protein revealed that all
isolates had avirulent motifs. Of the 43 isolates, 23 exhibited sequence motif of 111GGKQGRL117
at the cleavage site, 19 exhibited 111GEKQGRL117 while one isolate showed 111GERQGRL117.
Phylogenetic analysis based on comparison with different classes of NDVs revealed that all 43
isolates clustered with class II NDVs and none with class I NDVs. Within class II, five isolates were
phylogenetically close to genotype I NDVs while the remaining 38 were close to genotype II.
Conclusion: We conclude that more than one genotype of NDV circulates in waterfowl in the
Upper Midwest region of the US. Continuous surveillance may help better understand the
epidemiology of NDVs maintained in wild bird populations and their relationship to NDVs in
domestic poultry, if any.

Background
Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) belong to genus Avulavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. The genome of APMV is
an approximately 15 kb long, negative-sense, singlestranded RNA molecule. It has six genes that encode for a
nucleoprotein (N), a phosphoprotein (P), a matrix protein (M), a fusion protein (F), an attachment protein
called hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and a large

polymerase protein (L) [1]. Nine serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses (APMV-1 to APMV-9) have been identified.
Of these, APMV-1, also called the Newcastle disease virus
(NDV), is the causative agent of Newcastle disease (ND)
in poultry. Based on genetic and antigenic analyses of
NDV isolates, two major classes (class I and class II) are
identified [2,3] and each class has nine genotypes (1-9
genotypes in class I and I-IX in class II) [4,5].

The NDV can cause clinical signs varying from subclinical
infections to 100% mortality, depending on the susceptibility of the host and the virulence of the virus. The virus
is categorized into velogenic (velogenic neurotropic or
velogenic viscerotropic), mesogenic, lentogenic, and
asymptomatic enteric strains on the basis of their pathogenesis and virulence. The velogenic strains cause acute
fatal infection of chickens of all age groups with clinical
findings of nervous signs or extensive hemorrhagic lesions
in the gastrointestinal tract. The mesogenic strains are of
intermediate virulence and cause moderate respiratory
signs with occasional nervous signs while the lentogenic
strains cause mild to inapparent infections [1]. The lentogenic strains have been detected in both domestic poultry [6-8] and wild bird populations [4,8,9]. Though
velogenic strains are considered exotic (exotic Newcastle
disease, END) to US poultry, these strains have been isolated occasionally from different avian species in the US
[10,11]. During 2002-2003, California outbreak of END
in backyard fowl and commercial poultry resulted in the
destruction of about 3.3 million birds and cost $200 million dollars to control the disease [11,12]. Outbreaks of
ND have been reported in many countries with considerable economic losses [1]. Such outbreaks warrant continuous surveillance for END in commercial poultry and
wild birds.
The surveillance of NDVs in waterfowl is sporadic and
often occurs with other monitoring programs such as
those for avian influenza viruses (AIV) [13,14]. Wild birds
are considered the natural reservoirs of NDVs and mostly
harbor lentogenic strains. Studies on genetic diversity
among lentogenic strains of NDVs revealed that some of
the NDVs from waterfowl and shorebirds were phylogenetically related with NDVs isolated from live-bird markets in the US [4]. It is recommended that epidemiological
studies should be continued to determine the prevalence
of lentogenic NDVs in wild bird populations [4]. An epidemiological link between isolates recovered from outbreaks in domestic poultry with those obtained from wild
bird populations has also been suggested [8,9,15,16].
Therefore, continuous surveillance of wild bird populations may help better understand the NDVs circulating in
the environment. This study was conducted to characterize NDV isolates obtained from waterfowl samples. In this
study, the cloacal samples from waterfowl from Upper
Midwest region of the US were initially screened for AIV
by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR); the AIV positive samples by rRT-PCR were
inoculated on to the embryonated eggs for virus isolation
that yielded NDV in some of them. The NDV isolates were
characterized by sequencing to determine the pathotypes
and genotypes involved and the changes at the nucleotide
and amino acid levels.

Results
Altogether, 159 viral isolations from cloacal samples of
AIV rRT-PCR-positive waterfowl (n = 890) were obtained,
as shown by hemagglutinating (HA) activity of allantoic
fluid in embryonated eggs. Of these, 43 were positive for
NDV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). BLAST analysis of partial sequences of F gene of
NDV isolates confirmed their identity. These isolates were
obtained from 24 mallards (MALL; Anas platyrhynchos),
seven American green-winged teals (AGWT; Anas crecca),
six northern pintails (NOPI; Anas acuta), four bluewinged teals (BWTE; Anas discors), and two wood ducks
(WODU; Aix sponsa). Spatial distribution revealed that 28
isolates were obtained from South Dakota, 14 from Minnesota, and 1 from North Dakota.
Cleavage site analysis
The F gene portion (333 base pairs) corresponding to
nucleotide positions 170-502 of GenBank accession
number AF217084 was sequenced. Deduced amino acid
sequences of the F gene cleavage site were used to determine the pathotypes involved and are shown in Table 1.
The fusion gene of virulent NDVs is characterized by the
presence of a pair of dibasic amino acids at the cleavage
site while in lentogenic strains it is characterized by the
presence of monobasic amino acids. None of the isolates
had the sequence motif of 111GR/KRQRK/RF117, a characteristic of the virulent strains. All 43 NDVs had an avirulent motif of monobasic amino acids at their F gene
cleavage sites. Of the 43 isolates, 23 exhibited sequence
motif of 111GGKQGRL117, 19 exhibited the sequence
motif of 111GEKQGRL117, and one isolate exhibited the
sequence motif of 111GERQGRL117 at the cleavage site of F
gene.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of partial F gene nucleotide
sequences of NDV isolates was done by comparing them
with already published F gene sequences of both class I
and class II NDVs. None of the isolates clustered with class
I NDVs (Figure 1); all isolates clustered with class II NDVs
(Figure 1). Within class II, all isolates clustered with genotype I or II. Five of the 43 isolates clustered with NDV
sequences of genotype I/Ia suggesting them to belong to
genotype I (Figure 1). Four of the five isolates clustered
together with genotype I NDVs from the US [Mallard/
US(MD)/04-483/2004, EF564942; Mallard/US(MD)/04204/2004, EF564821; and Mallard/US(MD)/04-235/
and

[KR/duck/05/07,

EU547755]. The sequence homology among these four
isolates was 99.6% to 100% at the nucleotide level. The
remaining one isolate was in a different group from these
four isolates and was phylogenetically closer to genotype
I NDVs from China [Heb02, AY427817], the US [AV 80/
97 D813-2, AY175736] and Ireland [AV 963/98 NZ5/97,

90.9% to 90.4% at nucleotide level with the other four
isolates of genotype I of this study. All five genotype I isolates had sequence homology of 87.9% to 100% with
class II genotype I NDVs used for comparison.
The remaining 38 isolates clustered with genotype II
NDVs. These isolates clustered into two groups with 19
isolates in each group. For ease of understanding, we have
named these two groups as X and Y (Figure 1). The isolates

in group X were phylogenetically close to genotype IIa
NDVs from wild birds from different regions of the US
[Mallard/US(MD)/03-152/2003, EF564972; Mallard/
US(MD)/01-618/2001, EF565012; Mallard/US(MN)/99397/1999, EF565032; Mallard/US(MN)/98-350/1998,

were phylogenetically close to already reported genotype
IIa NDVs from wild birds in the US [Blue winged teal/

this study. All already published sequences of velogenic
strains with in class II were phylogenetically distinct from
NDVs of this study (Figure 1). The sequence homology of
genotype II isolates of this study ranged from 95.5% to
100% at the nucleotide level, and the homology as compared to already published sequences of class II genotype
II ranged from 90.4% to 100%.

Discussion
This study was conducted to characterize NDVs isolated
from waterfowl in the Upper Midwest region of the US.
The initial aim of this study was to isolate and characterize
AIV from waterfowl. During the study period, 7458 cloacal samples were collected and of these, 11.9% samples
were AIV positive by rRT-PCR. Inoculation of these AIV
positive samples in embryonated chicken eggs yielded
hemagglutinating viruses and of these, 43 were identified
as NDVs by RT-PCR using primer specific for F gene. We
were expecting the isolation of AIV rather than NDV on
inoculation in embryonated eggs as the samples were initially positive for AIV by rRT-PCR. The possibility of the
presence of other hemagglutinating virus(es) in HA positive-AIV negative (by RT-PCR for matrix gene)-NDV negative (by RT-PCR for F gene) allantoic fluid cannot be ruled
out and testing of such allantoic fluid is underway in our
laboratory. The isolation of NDV from samples that were
rRT-PCR positive for AIV indicates that the cloacal sample
may have mixed infection with NDV and AIV with concentration of NDV being higher than that of AIV. Hence,
the NDV probably overgrew AIV upon inoculation in
embryonated chicken eggs. It is to be noted that we tested
only AI rRT-PCR positive samples by inoculation in
embryonated eggs; testing of more samples might have
led to isolation of more NDVs. The isolation of NDV from
AIV positive samples indicates the presence of both
viruses (AIV and NDV) in waterfowl. The AIV positive
allantoic fluid by RT-PCR was not tested for NDV; this
testing might provide a better picture of mixed infection
of both NDV and AIV. Mixed infection of AIV and NDV in
waterfowl has been reported earlier [17,18].
A large amount of sequence data on NDVs isolated
throughout the world has been published over the years
and is now available for sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis which can be used to predict the pathotypes and to determine the origin of NDV outbreaks. It has

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/191

been well established that cleavage of NDV fusion protein
is a major determinant for viral virulence. In this study,
the F gene sequence of NDVs was used for pathotyping as
well as their characterization into different classes and
genotypes. None of the isolates was found to be velogenic
on the basis of sequence motif of F gene cleavage site. It
has been reported that virulent virus has at least one pair
of basic amino acids at residues 115 and 116 plus a phenylalanine at residue 117 and a basic amino acid (R) at
113 at the cleavage site whereas lentogenic strains lack
dibasic amino acids [19]. All NDV isolates of this study
had lentogenic motif at the cleavage site. These results are
in agreement with previous studies reporting the detection of lentogenic NDVs in wild birds and domestic ducks
[4,9,15,20,21]. None of the isolates had the sequence
motif of 111GERQE/DRL117 of class I isolates, although the
latter have been reported in wild birds and domestic
ducks [4,21]. For example, [4] reported seven of the nine
genotypes of class I NDVs in waterfowl and shore birds in
the US while [21] reported the presence of class I genotype
2 NDVs in domestic ducks in Korea.
Of the 43 isolates, 42 had the sequence motif of 111GG/
EKQGRL117 at the cleavage site and were phylogenetically
similar to either genotype I or genotype II within class II.
This sequence motif has been reported earlier in genotypes I and II of class II NDVs [4]. However, a different
sequence motif (111GRRQRRF117) was reported in the lentogenic strains from Australia [22]. One of the isolates had
the sequence motif of 111GERQGRL117 and this isolate
also clustered with class II genotype I strains. This isolate
differed from other 42 isolates in the sense that the amino
acid lysine was replaced by arginine at position 113.
Overall genotype II viruses were more predominant than
genotype I viruses in this study. This finding has the support of [4] who also observed more genotype IIa viruses
than genotype I viruses within class II. The NDV isolates
in this study were derived only from rRT-PCR AIV positive
samples, the possibility of presence of genotypes of both
classes (that were not detected in this study) in rRT-PCR
AIV negative samples cannot be ruled out. Within class II,
the NDV sequences clustered into two different groups.
None of the isolates was phylogenetically close to vaccine
strains used for comparison. This indicates that in spite of
the regular use of live vaccines in poultry throughout the
world, their transmission to wild birds may not be a common phenomenon. In an earlier study, [4] also did not
detect any vaccine strains in wild birds in the US. Since
wild birds have been reported to be a reservoir of NDV
[16,23], the mixing of different species at stop-overs during migration and the sharing of common wintering and
breeding areas may provide opportunity for virus spread
within and between countries and may help perpetuate
different genotypes and classes of NDVs in these birds.

The phylogenetic proximity of our isolates with those
from the US, China, Korea, and Ireland points to this likelihood.
The presence of class II viruses in wild birds is of concern
because this class of viruses has been responsible for several panzootics of Newcastle disease in poultry [24,25].
There are reports suggesting that velogenic NDVs might
arise from lentogenic NDVs in nature [23,26]. Further,
studies have also suggested that point mutation, and not
gene recombination, may be responsible for generating
virulent and avirulent strains. For example, the NDV outbreak in Australian poultry during 1998-2000 was caused
by a virulent NDV that originated due to mutation in a
class II genotype I virus [26]. These authors were of the
opinion that lentogenic viruses have the potential to
become virulent with the passage of time. Even passaging
of NDVs from one host to another has been reported to
increase their virulence [16,27]. In addition, the selective
forces imposed by a new host environment may also play
a role in acquisition of virulence [28]. These findings suggest that the lentogenic strains from wild birds may
acquire virulence by waterfowl-to-domestic poultry transmission in nature. In such a scenario we may encounter an
NDV outbreak in domestic poultry.
Similar to low pathogenic AIV, the lentogenic NDVs in
wild bird populations invariably do not cause obvious
disease. Even virulent strains of NDVs that are lethal to
chickens, have been isolated from apparently healthy

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/191

domestic ducks [14,29,30]. Though virulent strains of
NDVs were not detected in this study, their presence in the
population cannot be ruled out in view of the potential
created by the comingling nature and migration patterns
of wild birds within and across continents. Thus, continuous surveillance for NDV in wild birds is essential for better understanding of its epidemiology. In conclusion, the
present study reveals the circulation of class II (genotypes
I and II) lentogenic strains of NDVs in wild birds in the
Upper Midwest region of the US. Further studies are
needed to determine the true prevalence and implications
of various genotypes of NDV within wild bird population.

Conclusion
This study indicates the circulation of class II genotypes I
and II NDVs in waterfowl in the Upper Midwest region of
the US with an avirulent motif of monobasic amino acids
at their F gene cleavage sites. Phylogenetically distant relationship of NDVs of this study with vaccine strains indicates that in spite of the regular use of live vaccines in
poultry, their transmission to wild birds may not be a
common phenomenon.

sion broth containing antibiotics (penicillin 500 IU/mL,
streptomycin 500 Î¼g/mL, neomycin 0.15 mg/mL, fungizone 1.5 Î¼g/mL, and gentamicin 50 Î¼g/mL) and were
transported on ice to the laboratory. The initial aim of the
project was to test cloacal samples (n = 7458) from waterfowl species for the detection of AIV for which five samples each were pooled and the pools were tested for AIV
using rRT-PCR [31]. Individual samples in positive pools
were then tested for the detection of AIV by rRT-PCR.
Virus isolation
Individual samples positive for AIV by rRT-PCR (n = 890)
were inoculated in 9-day-old specific pathogen free
embryonated chicken eggs for virus isolation (VI). Allantoic fluid from inoculated eggs was harvested four days
post inoculation and subsequently tested for hemagglutination (HA) using 0.5% turkey erythrocytes. The HA pos-

itive allantoic fluids (n = 159) were tested by RT-PCR for
the confirmation of AIV as described below.
Total RNA extraction and RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from allantoic fluids and a
known AIV isolate using QIAamp Viral RNA extraction kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Extracted RNAs were subjected to
RT-PCR using primers targeting the matrix gene of AIV
[32]. A band of 1027 base pairs was observed in 52 cases
indicating them to be AIV. The HA positive allantoic fluids
that were negative for AIV (n = 107) were then tested for
NDV by RT-PCR. Total RNA extracted from a known
APMV-1 was used as a positive control. The RNA was
amplified using primers specific to the F gene of NDV
[33]. PCR amplification was carried out using Qiagen
OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Amplified
PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel.

Virology Journal 2009, 6:191

A band of 356 base pairs was observed in 43 cases indicating them to be NDVs. Further studies are underway to
determine the identity of the remaining HA positive allantoic fluids (n = 64). The NDV positive PCR products were
purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) and were then sequenced in both directions at the
BioMedical Genomic Center, University of Minnesota.
Phylogenetic analysis
The forward and reverse nucleotide sequences of all 43
isolates were curated, edited and aligned using a
"Sequencher" software http://www.msi.umn.edu. The
aligned sequences were analyzed on NCBI website http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov using BLAST to confirm their
identity. The nucleotide sequences were then aligned
using MEGA 4.0 software by Clustal W method. The evolutionary distances were computed by Pairwise Distance
method using the Maximum Composite Likelihood
Model. A phylogenetic tree of aligned sequences was constructed by Neighbor-Joining method (500 replicates for
bootstrap). The F gene nucleotide sequences [corresponding to nucleotide positions 170-502 of GenBank:
AF217084] were translated to deduced amino acid
sequences to determine the pathotype involved. The
nucleotide sequences were also compared with NDV
sequences available in the GenBank. The virus types and
their GenBank accession numbers used for comparison
are given in Tables 2 and 3. These included F gene
sequences of different genotypes of class I and class II
NDVs. To maintain uniformity and consistency, class I
genotypes are indicated using Arabic numerals (1-9)
while class II genotypes are indicated using Roman
numerals (I-IX).
GenBank accession numbers
The NDV sequence data were submitted to the GenBank
database; the accession numbers and other details are
