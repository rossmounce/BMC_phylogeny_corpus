<p>Analysis of the
Balancing selectionhuman beta defensin 1 promoter region in six human populations reveals a signature of balancing selection.</p>

Abstract
Background: Defensins, small endogenous peptides with antimicrobial activity, are pivotal
components of the innate immune response. A large cluster of defensin genes is located on human
chromosome 8p; among them the beta defensin 1 (DEFB1) promoterhas been extensively studied
since discovery that specific polymorphisms and haplotypes associate with asthma and atopy,
susceptibility to severe sepsis, as well as HIV and Candida infection predisposition.
Results: Here, we characterize the sequence variation and haplotype structure of the DEFB1
promoter region in six human populations. In all of them, we observed high levels of nucleotide
variation, an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles, reduced population differentiation and a
genealogy with common haplotypes separated by deep branches. Indeed, a significant departure
from the expectation of evolutionary neutrality was observed in all populations and the possibility
that this is due to demographic history alone was ruled out. Also, we verified that the selection
signature is restricted to the promoter region and not due to a linked balanced polymorphism. A
phylogeny-based estimation indicated that the two major haplotype clades separated around 4.5
million years ago, approximately the time when the human and chimpanzee lineages split.
Conclusion: Altogether, these features represent strong molecular signatures of long-term
balancing selection, a process that is thought to be extremely rare outside major histocompatibility
complex genes. Our data indicate that the DEFB1 promoter region carries functional variants and
support previous hypotheses whereby alleles predisposing to atopic disorders are widespread in
modern societies because they conferred resistance to pathogens in ancient settings.

Background

Defensins comprise a large family of small endogenous peptides with antimicrobial activity against a wide range of
microorganisms [1,2]. Although initially regarded as pivotal

components of the innate immune system, recent evidence
has indicated that defensins also play roles in the recruitment
of adaptive immune cells [3] and in promoting antigen-specific immune responses [4].

Genome Biology 2008,

In humans two defensin subfamilies have been described (α
and β), the structural difference residing in the linear spacing
and pairing of their six conserved cysteine residues. While αdefensins are expressed by neutrophils and intestinal Paneth
cells, β-defensins are mainly produced by epithelia [5].
In mammals, defensins represent large multigene families
and a major defensin cluster localizes to human chromosome
8p22-23, where several α- and β-defensin genes are located.
Recent evidence [6] has indicated that β-defensin genes on
chromosome 8p originated by successive rounds of duplication followed by a complex evolutionary history involving
both negative and positive selection with variable pressures
among mammalian lineages [7]. Given the relevance of
defensins in antimicrobial response and the conundrum
whereby increased protein sequence diversity in the immune
system enhances the spectrum of pathogen recognition,
defensin coding exons have attracted much more interest in
evolutionary studies compared to noncoding sequences. Yet,
growing evidence suggests that 5' cis regulatory regions of
genes such as CCR5 [8], HLA-G [9], HLA-DQA1 [10] and
HLA-DPA1/DPB1 [11] have been subjected to balancing selection during recent primate history.
Among defensins, the human β-defensin 1 (DEFB1 [OMIM
*602056]) promoter has been extensively studied since specific polymorphisms and haplotypes of it have been associated with asthma and atopy [12], susceptibility to severe
sepsis [13], as well as HIV [14,15] and Candida [16] infection
predisposition. Moreover, recent evidence [17] has indicated
that reduced expression of DEFB1 is found in a high percentage of renal and prostate cancers, therefore suggesting that
DEFB1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. These findings,
together with the demonstrated functional significance of
polymorphisms within DEFB1 5' regulatory sequence, indicate that this region might represent a target of natural
selection.

of other innate immunity genes genotyped for AA and EA
were retrieved only if the initial ATG was located in the first
exon (as it is for DEFB1) and if it could be unequivocally identified. Also, promoter regions were discarded if located in
recombination hotspots or in resequencing gaps. A total of 20
promoter regions finally constituted the control dataset. Data
concerning the number of segregating sites and nucleotide
diversity at the DEFB1 promoter region are summarized in
Table 1 and indicate that both θW [22] and π [23] are definitely
higher for DEFB1 compared to maximum values calculated
for IIPGA gene promoters.
We excluded that the high degree of polymorphisms at the
DEFB1 promoter is due to non-allelic gene conversion with
other paralogous defensin genes on chromosome 8 by applying Sawyer's gene conversion algorithm [24].

Neutrality tests
Under neutral evolution, the amount of within-species diversity is predicted to correlate with levels of between-species
divergence, since both depend on the neutral mutation rate
[25]. The HKA test [26] is commonly used to verify whether
this expectation is verified. We performed both pairwise and
maximum-likelihood (MLHKA) [27] tests with Rhesus
macaque as an outgroup (instead of chimpanzee) so that
greater divergence time results in more fixed differences and
improves power to detect selection. For pairwise HKA tests
we compared polymorphism and divergence level at the promoter region of DEFB1 with the 20 IIPGA genes; we consider
these comparisons to be well-suited since lower sequence
conservation and faster evolutionary rates are though to be a
widespread feature of immune response genes [28,29]. Since
IIPGA data refer to AA and EA, only these populations were
used in the comparison; pairwise HKA tests (Table 2) yielded
significant results (p < 0.05) in 11 out of 20 cases (with 5 additional tests yielding a p < 0.10), suggesting increased diversity
at the DEFB1 promoter compared to most loci. For further
confirmation, we performed a MLHKA test by comparing the
DEFB1 5' region to all 20 promoter regions: a significant
result was obtained (k = 3.31, p = 0.0018).

Nucleotide diversity at the DEFB1 promoter region
We sequenced the 1,400 bp region immediately upstream of
the DEFB1 translation start site (Figure 1) in 83 individuals
with different ethnic origins (Yoruba from Nigeria [18] (YRI),
Asians (AS), South American Indians (SAI), Australian Aborigines (AUA)); additional data derived from full gene resequencing of 47 subjects (24 African Americans (AA) and 23
European Americans (EA)) were retrieved from the Innate
Immunity PGA (IIPGA) web site [19]. A total of 27 single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were identified and haplotypes (Additional data file 1) were inferred using PHASE
[20,21]. The analyzed region encompasses all polymorphic
variants previously shown to modulate DEFB1 expression
levels. As a control for the AA and EA populations, data for 20
promoter regions were retrieved for 20 genes in the IIPGA. In
particular, the 2 kb upstream of the translation initiation site

Another expectation for neutrally evolving genes is that values of θW and π are roughly equal; this is the case for the maximum values of innate immunity gene promoters but not for
DEFB1, which shows greater π than θW, a finding consistent
with an excess of intermediate frequency variants as a result
of balancing selection [30]. The statistics Tajima's D [31] and
Fu and Li's D* and F* [32] are commonly used to evaluate the
difference between θW and π and, therefore, to test departure
from neutrality. As shown in Table 1, significantly positive
values for the DEFB1 promoter of one or more statistics were
obtained for all analyzed populations.
It should be noted that population history, in addition to
selective processes, is known [31] to affect frequency spectra
and, therefore, all related statistics such as Tajima's D and Fu

and Li's D* and F*. In particular, positive values of the statistics are expected under a scenario of population contraction,
while negative values are consistent with an increase in population size [31,33]. We performed all tests under the standard assumption of constant population size, which is
unrealistic for human populations. Still, this approach is conservative when applied to African populations since they are
thought to have undergone moderate but uninterrupted population expansion [34]; in the case of non-African populations the effects of demography are more difficult to
disentangle from balancing selection signatures since bottlenecks possibly occurred following migration out of Africa
[34]. One possibility to circumvent this problem is to exploit
the fact that selection acts on a single locus while demography
affects the whole genome. As shown in Table 1, Tajima's D, as
well as Fu and Li's F* and D*, displays far higher values in the
case of DEFB1 compared to the maximum values of innate
immunity gene promoters in EA. In order to obtain a more
extensive comparison, by including YRI and subjects of Asiatic ancestry we retrieved information concerning 231 genes
resequenced in AA, EA, AS and YRI from the NIEHS SNPs
Program (NIEHS panel 2) [35]. In particular, for each gene a

5 kb region was randomly selected; the only requirement was
that it did not contain any long (>500 bp) resequencing gaps,
and if the gene did not fulfill this requirement it was discarded, as were 5 kb regions displaying less than six SNPs.
The number of analyzed regions for AA, YRI, EA and AS were
209, 203, 177 and 172, respectively. We calculated the percentile rank of DEFB1 values in the distributions of Tajima's D
and Fu and Li's F* and D* for this set of loci. In analogy to the
results obtained above, values for DEFB1 ranked above the
95th percentile in all populations (except for Tajima's D in
YRI, which ranked 93rd). It is worth mentioning that, as
already noticed by other authors [36], resequenced genes in
SNP discovery programs probably represent a sample biased
toward non-neutrally evolving loci (in the case of the NIEHS
SNPs Program, genes are selected on the basis of their having
a role in organism-environment interactions), making comparison with their distribution a conservative test.
A second possibility to disentangle the effect of demographic
history from selection is to apply calibrated population genetics models. In particular, one such model that has been proposed recently, cosi [37], is based on the ability to generate

particular, lower FST values are expected at loci under balancing selection compared to neutrally evolving ones [39,40]. FST
among AA, EA and AS was 0.0057, much lower than the
genome average of 0.123 [40] and not significantly different
from 0 (p = 0.25).
We next wished to verify that the evolution of the DEFB1 promoter is not influenced by the presence of a linked balanced
polymorphism within, for example, the gene coding region.
We exploited the availability of full resequencing data for the
whole gene and calculated human-macaque divergence,
nucleotide diversity, Tajima's D and FST in sliding windows
for AA and EA. As shown in Figure 1, while inter-specific
divergence is quite homogeneous along DEFB1, a peak in
nucleotide diversity (expecially π) is observed at the promoter; consistently, in both AA and EA, the same region displays the maximum Tajima's D value and the minimum FST,
with no other region showing evidence suggestive of balancing selection.

cosi package [37] and its best-fit population parameters for
YRI, AA, EA and AS. Data are reported in Table 1 and indicate
that for Tajima's D, as well as for Fu and Li's D* and F*, application of a calibrated model allows rejection of neutrality for
the four populations at the DEFB1 promoter region.
Population genetic differentiation, quantified by FST [38], can
also be used to detect the signature of balancing selection. In

It should be noted that several defensin genes on 8p23.1, but
not DEFB1, exhibit copy number variation (CNV) in humans
[41]; a more recent [42] genome-wide analysis of CNVs indicated that the 5' gene region of DEFB1 might be encompassed
by a CNV, although the authors indicate that, since the breakpoints are difficult to establish, involved loci might flank
rather than be encompassed by the CNVs. The authors studied HapMap subjects and reported a frequency for the CNV
ranging from 6% to 14% in different populations. Since our
YRI samples comprise a subset of HapMap YRI subjects, we
checked whether any of them were reported to display a CNV
in this region: two subject were retrieved, accounting for one
gain and one loss. Electropherograms of these two subjects
(as well as all other subjects in this study) revealed no evidence of unbalanced peaks at heterozygous SNPs and their
removal from the sample did not affect the results for YRI.
Previous [43] work had studied CNVs in the defensin cluster
on chromosome 8 using real-time PCR assays and found that
24 American subjects with different ethnic origin had 2 copies
of DEFB1. Taking these observations together, we consider
that either DEFB1 lies outside the CNV or, in any case, that
CNVs encompassing DEFB1 are very rare and do not affect
the results reported here.

Haplotype analysis
One effect of balancing selection is to preserve two or more
lineages over an extended period of time, resulting in clades
separated by long branch lengths. To examine the genealogy
of DEFB1 promoter haplotypes, we built a median-joining
network. The topology of this network (Figure 2) is unambiguous with no reticulations, a pattern consistent with the low
level of recombination observed in this gene region (not
shown). Two major clades (haplogroups 1 and 2) separated by
long branch lengths are evident, each containing one common haplotype. We next wished to estimate the time to the
most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the two haplotype

clades, applying a phylogeny-based method [44] based on the
measure ρ, the average distance of descendant haplotypes
from a specified root. By using root 1 (Figure 2), ρ was equal
to 9.45 so that, with a mutation rate based on 21 fixed differences between chimpanzee and humans and a separation
time of 5 million years ago, we estimated a TMRCA of
4,489,791 years (standard deviation ±1,018,128).

Comparison with other primates
In order to gain further insight into the evolutionary history
of the DEFB1 promoter region, we resequenced those from
three chimpanzees and one orangutan. These samples were
obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and
the Pongo sequence was used in the median-joining network
in order to root the phylogeny (Figure 2). A total of 5 polymorphic sites were identified in chimpanzees; one of them (-913
C/T in the human sequence) was shared with humans and,
therefore, represents a trans-specific polymorphism. Transspecific polymorphisms are an effect of long-term balancing
selection, while they are highly unlikely under neutrality.
Indeed, a neutral polymorphism is expected to persist for 4Ne
generations (where Ne is the effective population size, estimated to be around 10,000 for humans) [45] and, therefore,
the probability of observing a polymorphism shared between
humans and chimpanzees, two species that diverged about 5

HKA p-value

million years ago (around 20Ne generations), is extremely low
[46,47]. Although the identification of a human/chimpanzee
trans-specific SNP is consistent with the estimated TMRCA
of the haplotype clusters (suggesting that balancing selection
was established around the same time when the human and
Pan lineages split), the possibility exists that the shared SNP
is due to a coincidental mutation that occurred after speciation. Indeed, the location of the substitution at a CpG site
makes the possibility of a recurrent mutation more likely and,
therefore, taking into account the lack of functional data on
this SNP, it is difficult to discriminate between the two
possibilities.

Discussion

Haldane's hypothesis [48] as formulated in 1932 posits that
infectious diseases have been a major threat to human populations and have, therefore, exerted strong selective pressures
throughout human history. As a result, a number of human
loci are thought to have evolved in response to such pressures. Up to now, most evolutionary studies have focused on
adaptive immunity, yet the ancient innate immune system,
with the production of antimicrobial peptides, provides a critical line of defense in vertebrates [5]. Following Haldane's
idea, it is conceivable, therefore, that innate immunity genes

have undergone similar selective pressures as their adaptive
counterparts. Indeed, in analogy to immunoglobulins [49]
and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
[50], the paradigm whereby gene duplication followed by
rapid divergence has been a powerful adaptive strategy in
immune response genes has been verified for defensin loci
[6,7,51]. Recent studies [7] demonstrated that, after gene
duplication in an ancestral mammalian genome, the mature
peptide-coding exons of β-defensins have been subjected to
positive selection, while sites within the pre-propeptide
region have undergone negative selection in primate lineages.
The data we report add further complexity to the evolutionary
history of defensin genes by showing that balancing selection
has shaped variability at the promoter region of human

DEFB1. Indeed, we have documented here that the DEFB1
promoter region displays elevated nucleotide diversity,
excess of polymorphism to divergence levels and reduced
population differentiation. In line with these findings, the
analysis of DEFB1 haplotypes revealed the presence of two
clades separated by long branches approximately dating back
to the time when the human and chimpanzee lineages split.
Altogether, these features represent strong molecular signatures of long-term balancing selection, a process that is
thought to be extremely rare outside MHC genes [47].
β-Defensin 1, the first human β-defensin to be discovered,
shows anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of Gramnegative bacteria (for example, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), as well as

different Candida species [52-54]. β-defensin 1 is constitutively expressed by most epithelia with higher levels being
detectable in kidney, pancreas, the urogenital and respiratory
tracts [54-56]. Consistently, targeted disruption of the mouse
β-defensin 1 gene resulted in animals deficient in the clearance of Haemophilus influenzae from the lung [57] or containing a greater number of bacteria (Staphylococci, in
particular) in urine collected from the bladder [58]. Also,
DEFB1 expression has been demonstrated [59-61] in the
human epidermis, gingival epithelium, oral mucosa and
saliva, suggesting that it contributes to host defenses in areas
exposed to a variety of microbial challenges. Moreover, recent
evidences indicated that the protein product of DEFB1 is
detectable in human milk [62] and the mammary epithelium
[63]; in particular, pregnant women display higher levels of
β-defensin 1 and concentrations comparable to those
observed in milk were effective in killing E. coli [62], suggesting that this antimicrobial peptide might have a fundamental
role in protecting breast-fed infants from infectious diarrhea
and mothers from lactational mastitis [62,63].
The promoter region of DEFB1 has recently been subjected to
extensive study; in particular, three SNPs have been reported
to affect gene expression [17,64], although contrasting results
on transcriptional activity have been obtained by different
research groups, possibly reflecting either non-trivial interactions among polymorphic alleles at multiple positions or celltype specific SNP effects [65]. In SNP typing studies, the 20A/-44C/-52G haplotype has been independently associated with protection against severe sepsis [13], susceptibility
to asthma and atopy [12] and, in cystic fibrosis patients, with
chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection [66]. Also, the -44C
allele was shown to predispose to HIV [14,15] and Candida
[16] infection, while an association with HIV infection in
Brazilian children was also reported for SNPs -20G and -52A
[15]. Although the biological bases for these associations are
presently unknown, their description allows interesting speculations concerning the selective pressures possibly shaping
nucleotide diversity at the DEFB1 promoter region. Sepsis is
a leading cause of death in infants and children throughout
the world [67]; its incidence and fatal outcome were conceivably higher before the advent of modern sanitation and,
therefore, it might have represented a powerful selective force
during human history. Indeed, signatures of natural selection
have been reported at another human locus, namely CASP12
[68], as a possible adaptive response to sepsis. Variants in the
DEFB1 promoter that protect against sepsis might, therefore,
have conferred a selective advantage to carriers, although one
or more of these same SNP alleles have been associated with
predisposition to candidiasis [16], as well as to susceptibility
to HIV and P. aeruginosa infection (at least in cystic fibrosis
patients) [14,15,66]. In this respect, it is interesting to notice
that early hunter-gatherer societies, due to their small population sizes, were likely to support a parasite fauna constituted of pathogens with high transmission rates and inducing
little or no immunity [69]. In such a scenario, the role of

Volume 9, Issue 9, Article R143

innate response might have been extremely relevant to
ensure protection from infectious agents. The increase in
population size that occurred at some time during human history is thought to have allowed maintenance of a different and
wider range of pathogen species, including major infectious
agents responsible for sepsis. Variable environmental conditions are regarded as a possible explanation underlying the
maintenance of balanced polymorphisms [70]; in a simplistic
situation whereby a variant (or haplotype) protects against
sepsis while predisposing to other infectious agents, changes
in pathogen prevalence, with particular reference to microbes
leading to fatal sepsis, might modulate the fitness of subjects
carrying either allele.
Unfortunately, little information is available concerning the
early epidemiological history of our predecessors; indeed, the
timing of human population expansion has been matter of
debate [71-73] and some uncertainty concerns the time of origin of major human pathogens, for example, tuberculosis
[74,75]. Further studies concerning these issues, as well as
better understanding of the role of DEFB1 polymorphisms,
will therefore be required before a direct link can be established between pathogen-driven selective pressure and the
maintenance of DEFB1 variants.
An additional, non-mutually exclusive possibility to explain
the action of balancing selection at the DEFB1 promoter
implies heterozygote advantage. This phenomenon is deemed
responsible for maintenance of polymorphisms at MHC class
II promoters [10,76] and is thought to enhance immune
response flexibility by modulating allele-specific gene expression in different cell-types [77] and in response to diverse
stimuli/cytokines [78]. DEFB1 is considered a constitutive
defensin, in that, unlike β-defensin 2, it shows limited inducibility by inflammatory stimuli (reviewed in [5]); however,
previous reports have indicated that DEFB1 shows marked
inter-individual variability in expression levels in urine,
saliva, gingival epithelium and epidermis [56,59-61]. Similarly, the ability of lipopolysaccharide to induce DEFB1
expression varied among the blood samples obtained from 51
healthy individuals [53]. These data, together with the functional data indicating allele-dependent promoter activity in
different cell types [64,65], suggest that DEFB1 variants
might exert different effects in diverse tissues, possibly
accounting both for inter-individual variation of expression
levels and for maintenance of divergent clades.
It might also be worth mentioning that evidence, albeit preliminary, indicates that DEFB1 expression is up-regulated
during pregnancy [56,62], suggesting hormone-regulated
gene expression. No data have ever been reported concerning
the response of different DEFB1 promoter haplotypes to hormone treatment; were any difference identified, the adaptive
significance of variants increasing expression in human milk,
for example, would be evident.

Finally, it might be interesting to note that, given its high
expression in urogenital tissues, DEFB1 has been regarded as
a possible innate defense against sexually transmitted pathogens [56]. In line with this view, induction of an antiviral
response in cultured uterine epithelial cells resulted in a sixfold increase in DEFB1 expression [79]. Since sexually transmitted diseases are thought to have affected early hominid
societies, due to their sustainability in low-density host population [69], these observation might help to explain the
ancient origin of DEFB1 haplotype clades.
As discussed in the introduction, two recent reports indicated
that balancing selection has shaped variability at the promoter region of other loci involved in immune response. In
the case of CCR5, available evidence indicates that heterozygosity at this gene region delays HIV-1 disease progression
[80]. However, as the authors note, the introduction of HIV1 in human populations is relatively recent and cannot, therefore, account for the maintenance of balanced polymorphisms in the region; therefore, CCR5 possibly evolved to
respond to older pathogens, providing a clue to the difficult
task of inferring the origin of selective pressures exerted by
human pathogens over long evolutionary times.
Whatever the reason for the maintenance of a balanced variant, it is interesting to note that variation at DEFB1 might fit
a previously proposed hypothesis [81] whereby alleles that
conferred resistance to pathogens in ancient settings are now
associated with susceptibility to atopic disorders; DEFB1 haplotypes associated with protection against sepsis seem to predispose to asthma and atopy. A similar link between past
selection and present disease predisposition has been suggested [82] in the case of polymorphic variants in the IL4RA
gene and might help to explain the high prevalence of atopic
conditions in modern societies.

Conclusion

Association studies of DEFB1 variants have focused on a
small number of SNPs to be genotyped; it is possible, therefore, that additional variants in this gene region play a role in
the above described (or still unknown) conditions. In this
regard, it is worth mentioning that the availability of full gene
resequencing data allowed us to define a specific DEFB1 gene
region as the target of balancing selection and, therefore, as
the location of functional variants. This information might be
valuable in future association studies, suggesting that DEFB1
promoter SNPs, rather than linked variants, associate with
specific phenotypes.
This report represents an example of how population genetics
approaches may benefit from association studies by gaining
cues about possible selective pressures acting on target gene
regions; we hope it also illustrates the possible contribution of
evolutionary models to classic SNP-disease association

approaches by providing information about the localization
of candidate functional variants.

Materials and methods
DNA samples and sequencing
Human genomic DNA was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Ethnic Diversity DNA Panel plus
additional samples for Australian Aborigine derived from
HLA defined panels). From the same source we obtained the
genomic DNA of three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and
one orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus). Additional DNA samples
from South American Indians and Yoruba individuals were
derived from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research.
The 1.4 kb region covering the promoter region of DEFB1 was
PCR amplified (primer sequences are reported in Table 3).
PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA), directly sequenced on both
strands with a Big Dye Terminator sequencing Kit (v3.1
Applied Biosystems, Monza, Italy) and run on an Applied Biosystems ABI 3130 XL Genetic Analyzer. All sequences were
assembled using AutoAssembler version 1.4.0 (Applied Biosystems), inspected manually by two distinct operators, and
singletons were re-amplified and resequenced.

Data retrieval and haplotype construction
DEFB1 genotype data for American subjects of either African
or European descent were retrieved from the IIPGA website
[19]. From the same source, we derived resequencing data
referring to promoter regions (2 kb upstream of the translation initiation site) of other innate immunity genes genotyped
for AA and EA. Promoter regions were not selected if the initial ATG was not located in the first exon (as it is for DEFB1)
or if it could not be unequivocally identified due to the presence of multiple 5' isoforms, which were identified through
manual inspection of UCSC annotation tracks [83]. Also, promoter regions were discarded if located in recombination
hotspots (these were manually identified through the UCSC
genome annotation tables snpRecombHotspotHapmap and
snpRecombHotspotPerlegen [83]) or in resequencing gaps. A
total of 20 promoter regions finally constituted the control
dataset.
Genotype data for 231 resequenced human genes were
derived from the NIEHS SNPs Program web site [35]. In particular, we selected genes that had been resequenced in populations of defined ethnicity, including Asians (NIEHS panel
2).
Haplotypes were inferred using PHASE version 2.1 [20,21], a
program for reconstructing haplotypes from unrelated genotype data through a Bayesian statistical method. Haplotypes
for AS, AUA, SAI and YRI individuals are available as supporting information (Additional data file 1).

Statistical analysis
Tajima's D [31], Fu and Li's D* and F* [32] statistics, as well
as diversity parameters θW [22] and π [23] were calculated
using libsequence [84], a C++ class library providing an
object-oriented framework for the analysis of molecular population genetic data. Departure from neutrality was tested
from coalescent simulations computed with ms software [85]
fixing the mutation parameter, assuming no intra-locus
recombination and a constant population size with 100,000
iterations. Calibrated coalescent simulations were performed
using the cosi package [37] and its best-fit parameters for
YRI, AA, EA and AS populations with 10,000 iterations. The
FST statistic [38] estimates genetic differentiation among populations and was calculated as proposed by Hudson et al.
[86]. Significance was assessed by permuting 10,000 times
the haplotype distribution among populations [87].
Pairwise HKA tests were performed using libsequence. The
maximum-likelihood-ratio HKA test was performed using the
MLHKA software [27] with multilocus data of 20 selected
IIPGA promoter regions and Rhesus macaque (NCBI
rheMac2) as an outgroup. In particular, we evaluated the likelihood of the model under two different assumptions: that all
loci evolved neutrally and that only the DEFB1 promoter
region was subjected to natural selection; statistical significance was assessed by a likelihood ratio test. We used a chain
length (the number of cycles of the Markov chain) of 500,000
and, as suggested by the authors, we ran the program several
times with different seeds to ensure stability of results.
In order to test for gene conversion events, we applied Sawyer's gene conversion algorithm [24] implemented in the
GENECONV program. GENECONV assesses significance
using two methods: permutations and an approximate pvalue [88,89]. We performed several tests by varying the mismatch penalty from 0 to larger positive values and using
10,000 permutations. For all these runs and both methods,
no pairwise or global p-value involving DEFB1 was significant, suggesting no inner or outer fragments showing past
gene conversion.

The median-joining network to infer haplotype genealogy
was constructed using NETWORK 4.2 [44]. The time to the
most common ancestor (TMRCA) was estimated using a phylogeny based approach implemented in NETWORK 4.2 using
a mutation rate based on 21 fixed differences between chimpanzee and humans in the 1.4 kb DEFB1 region.
All calculations were performed in the R environment [90].
