Abstract
Background: A number of the deeper divergences in the placental mammal tree are still
inconclusively resolved despite extensive phylogenomic analyses. A recent analysis of 200 kbp of
protein coding sequences yielded only limited support for the relationships among Laurasiatheria
(cow, dog, bat and shrew), probably because the divergences occurred only within a few million
years from each other. It is generally expected that increasing the amount of data and improving
the taxon sampling enhance the resolution of narrow divergences. Therefore these and other
difficult splits were examined by phylogenomic analysis of the hitherto largest sequence alignment.
The increasingly complete genome data of placental mammals also allowed developing a novel and
stringent data search method.
Results: The rigorous data handling, recursive BLAST, successfully removed the sequences from
gene families, including those from well-known families hemoglobin, olfactory, myosin and HOX
genes, thus avoiding alignment of possibly paralogous sequences. The current phylogenomic
analysis of 3,012 genes (2,844,615 nucleotides) from a total of 22 species yielded statistically
significant support for most relationships. While some major clades were confirmed using genomic
sequence data, the placement of the treeshrew, bat and the relationship between Boreoeutheria,
Xenarthra and Afrotheria remained problematic to resolve despite the size of the alignment.
Phylogenomic analysis of divergence times dated the basal placental mammal splits at 95–100
million years ago. Many of the following divergences occurred only a few (2–4) million years later.
Relationships with narrow divergence time intervals received unexpectedly limited support even
from the phylogenomic analyses.
Conclusion: The narrow temporal window within which some placental divergences took place
suggests that inconsistencies and limited resolution of the mammalian tree may have their natural
explanation in speciation processes such as lineage sorting, introgression from species hybridization
or hybrid speciation. These processes obscure phylogenetic analysis, making some parts of the tree
difficult to resolve even with genome data.

Background
Recently the resolution of the mammalian tree made a
quantum leap forward with the analysis of protein coding
sequences of whole genome data [1-4]. The genome data
allowed collecting the protein coding sequences from
some 3000 genes, which is equivalent to 2.2 million
nucleotides (Mnt), representing ≈10% of all coding
sequences [2]. During the last 15 years since the influential review of Novacek [5] on the mammalian evolution,
many previously uncertain relationships are now becoming consistently resolved by different data sets and analytical approaches. However, lately released mammal
genome data have not been investigated by phylogenomic
analyses.
Presently the monophyly of each of the four major clades,
Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, Xenarthra, and Afrotheria is supported by most analyses based on sequence data
[2,6] and genome level data such as LINE and LTR elements [7]. The smallest clade, Xenarthra, consists of only
two orders, Cingulata (armadillos) and Pilosa (sloths and
anteaters) [8]. The Afrotheria [9] comprises the traditional
orders Sirenia, Proboscidea, Hyracoidea, and Tubulidentata plus the members from the paraphyletic Lipotyphla
(Insectivora): the Tenrecidae, Macroscelidea and Chrysochloridea. The Afrotheria and Xenarthra are grouped in
the clade named Xenafrotheria [10], a clade that is supported by phylogenomic analyses [2] and retroposon and
indel analysis [11]. Other studies, however, find support
for a basal Xenarthra clade from retroposon data [7], or a
basal Afrotheria clade from some sequence data analyses
[3,12]. The two remaining clades, Euarchontoglires (Primates, Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Scandentia, Dermoptera)
and Laurasiatheria (all remaining orders) together comprise the species rich taxon Boreoplacentalia, which is
supported by all current analyses. The new name Boreoplacentalia has been suggested for this clade for being
more consistent and specific than the previous name
Boreoeutheria [13].
Many branches of the mammalian tree remained difficult
to resolve, even with the analysis of several 100 thousand
nt (knt) of sequence data. The most basal placental mammal divergences were inconclusive even with the analysis
of some 200 knt of coding sequence data [3]. The analysis
of a ten-fold larger dataset, 2.2 Mnt of protein coding
sequence data supported the grouping of Xenarthra with
the Afrotheria in the higher order clade Xenafrotheria [2].
Jackknife analysis showed that at least 600 knt sites of protein coding data were needed to significantly resolve this
relationship [2]. The notoriously difficult to resolve split
between Xenafrotheria and Boreoplacentalia took place at
≈100 million years ago (Mya). However, the two clades
diverged into Xenarthra and Afrotheria, and Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires respectively only 3–4 million

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/162

years (Myr) later [2]. The resolution of these narrow temporal occurrences required more data than available to the
study of Nikolaev et al. [3], however the placement of
Xenarthra and Afrotheria remains challenged [12]. In
comparison, more distant branching events such as that of
monotreme, marsupial and placental mammals can be
significantly resolved with as little as 8000 aa sites of
nuclear coding genes [14]. Molecular dating on phylogenomic data estimated that 30–40 Myr separated the splits
among the three mammalian infra-classes [14]. This
leaves enough time to accumulate phylogenetically relevant sequence differences and to reduce the effects of lineage sorting and prevents introgression.
While the monophyly of the clade Laurasiatheria is well
established, phylogenomic analysis did not yet resolve the
relationships within this clade. The internal branches of
dog, cow, bat, and shrew received only 86% and 93%
bootstrap support, respectively, in a recent phylogenomic
analyses [3]. This non-significant support may be due to
the "insufficient" amount of 200 knt of coding sequence
that was available at the time of the analysis. However, the
splits may also have occurred at a very narrow time window of a few millions years or less, and more data than
expected may be required to resolve such tight divergences.
It is noteworthy that the few million years between mammal ordinal divergences are in the order of the average
duration of mammalian species and their typical speciation times [15,16]. The fact that the splits between the
extant orders occurred several tens of million years ago
does not diminish the problem that these splits represent
divergences among species or even lineages that were at
the brink of becoming genetically separated species.
Therefore, speciation adds an additional level of complication for resolving such narrow divergences. Not only is
the time for such divergences relatively short to accumulate sufficient sequence differences that are needed to
resolve these splits, but lineage sorting [17], species
hybridization [18] and hybrid speciation [19] can make
the resolution of significant parts of the mammalian tree
all but impossible.
The continuously increasing amount of sequence data
from protein coding genes now makes it possible to provide a phylogenomic analysis of placental mammals for
19 species on the basis of several million characters long
alignments. The quantity of new genome data also allows
using a new and more stringent assembly of the data,
which aims at avoiding data from gene families and thus
paralogous sequences in the alignment. We investigate if
the resolution of the basal split among placental mammals [2] prevails with the increased taxon sampling and if
other difficult to resolve divergences such as those within

the Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires can be resolved
with statistical confidence with an increased amount of
phylogenomic data and new analytical approaches [12].

Results
The first step in the data collection, searching for human
protein-coding genes that do not have obviously closely
related members of a gene family resulted in a set of
14,302 human sequences, from the original 24,108
unique genes. These sequences were used for identifying
related sequences from the remaining 21 species. After
selecting against genes from multi-gene families in any of
the species (step two) and using only alignments in which
more than 16 species are represented, 8,813 multiple
sequence alignments remained. From this data set
sequence alignments that were shorter than 300 bp or
observed aa distances (p) larger than 30% for any species
pair were removed. This left a data set of 3,012 multiple
sequence alignments. The total size of this alignment was
2,844,615 nucleotides for 22 species. The average length
of the individual sequences is 944 ± 748 nt and the average p distance between human and platypus is 18.6 ±
4.32%, with a maximum of 30% (Figure 1), which is
expected from the filtering constraints.
The rigorous filtering by recursive BLAST search removed
sequences that are part of gene families notably reduced
the amount of data. The filtering was rather effective, even
though there is no formal proof for its efficiency yet.
Already after the first filtering step (human sequence
against human genome) sequences of the hemoglobin,
myosin, olfactory receptor, HOX gene and other
sequences that are part of known gene families were eliminated from the data set. It is conceivable that by this
approach data from other, less known gene families were
also excluded from the analysis. The recursive BLAST
search with a cutoff value of 10-12 identified genes in gene

families that had more than 75% sequence similarity and
eliminated these. It can be argued that more distant
sequences will not be found when searching for such
sequences in other species with the same cutoff value of
10-12.
When inspected by eye the base and amino acid frequencies appear to be very similar among the species. However,
due to the large size of the dataset the chi-square test may
become overly strict. Compositional homogeneity was
rejected for many species both for nucleotide and amino
acid data (see Table 1). The compositional heterogeneity
remained even when the data were R/Y-coded.
The evolutionary model and the number of rate heterogeneity classes were estimated from previous phylogenomic
analyses [2]. Exact tests such as implemented in MODELTEST [20] could not be performed due to computational
constraints and the inability of most programs to analyze
a data set of this magnitude. A manual analysis would
have been prohibitively time consuming to perform and
we suspect would have resulted in the same model selection.
The phylogenetic analyses of the data produced an unambiguous picture of most placental mammals relationships. The ML tree in Figure 2 was constructed from first
and second codon positions (NT12) and analyzed under
a GTR 8Γ+I model of sequence evolution for the
2,844,615 nt long sequences in TF. Although in this and
most other analyses the bat groups with the cow, the
branch is shown as unresolved in Figure 2, because the
placement of the bat on the mammalian tree is indefinite
in some analyses. Bayesian analysis of the same data set,
on first plus second codon positions or on aa sequence
data reconstructed the same topology. Also R/Y coded
sequences that were analyzed using a two-state [21] ML
4Γ+I model reconstructed the topology shown in Figure 2.
ML analysis with a non-stationary model in PAML [22]
confirmed the topology in Figure 2. Finally, the same tree
was also reconstructed after removing sites with more
than three different amino acids across all species.
Placing the treeshrew on the mammalian tree by sequence
analysis was somewhat problematic. ML reconstructed an
alternative position of the treeshrew, outside the primates
plus Glires clade, when the nt data were not partitioned by
codon position. An extended ML analysis on aa and first
and second codon position sequences (NT12) could,
however, differentiate between alternative placements of
the treeshrew on the tree (Table 2a, Figure 3, tree 1–3) for
the different datasets. A sister group position to the primates is the best ML option for most analyses. The treeshrew as sister group to primates plus Glires can be
rejected by other datasets with statistical confidence. Also

The highly unconventional phylogenetic position of the
bat as sister group to the cow and thus probably to all Artiodactyla and Cetacea is recovered by most analyses and
datasets (Table 2c, Figure 3, tree 7–11). The only alternative position is as sister group to the lipotyphla (hedgehog
plus shrew) which cannot be rejected by the SH test on aa
or codon sequence data. It is the favored topology for separate aa analysis of individual genes. Albeit, the support is
very limited. Varied results were obtained from ML analyses on data that were partitioned according to the average
aa distance. Without following logic the bat grouped
either with the cow or the shrew plus hedgehog. Analyses
of partitions with over 10% aa distance grouped the bat
indistinguishably by ML on any of the neighboring
branches. Although most analyses favor a grouping of bat
plus cow, the branch leading to the bat, cow and carnivores is shown as unresolved in Figure 2.

a split between Xenafrotheria and the remaining placentals (Table 2d, tree 12). However, analysis of aa sequences
ever so slightly favor a split between Afrotheria and the
remaining placentals (Table 2d, tree 13), but cannot reject
alternative hypothesis. Partitioned ML analysis of codon
positions and separate analysis of aa sequences support a
split between Xenarthra and the remaining placentals
(Table 2d, tree 14).
ML bootstrap support values for the branches that do not
receive maximum support are shown in Figure 2. Thus,
bootstrap analysis unambiguously supports the relationships among Xenafrotheria, Glires and primates. As
expected, nt sequences find only limited support for the
treeshrew as sister group to the primates, but even the
analysis of aa sequences does not provide maximal bootstrap support for this relationship. While nt sequences
provide the strongest bootstrap support (91%) for placing
the cow and bat on a common branch, ML bootstrap analysis of aa sequences data support the bat plus cow group-

ing only by 31% and instead favors to group the bat with
the shrew plus hedgehog on a common branch. This relationship receives 64% bootstrap support.
Divergence times were calculated for the tree topology as
shown in Figure 1. Estimated ages for all divergences are
depicted in a chronogram in Figure 4. The exact values for
different methods and their standard deviations for the
r8s dates based on aa and nt sequences are shown in Table
3. Virtually the same divergence times among Boreoplacentalia were calculated for the two alternatively rooted
trees (Table 4). For some dates the r8s program tend to
provide 4–5 Myr younger time estimates than TF. However, the dates provided by TF generally conform within a
few 100,000 years to those previously published on phylogenomic analyses [2], and most importantly, only marginal differences are observed for the relative dates. The
standard deviations appear to be unrealistically small, but
reflect the amount of data that was used for the analysis.
Most divergence time estimates are only negligibly differ-

ent from analysis of much smaller nuclear or mitogenomic alignments [23]. A notable exception is the age of
the lagomorph and rodent divergence, which has previously been estimated 5–20 Myr younger by phylogenomic
analysis [2]. It should be observed that many of the difficult to resolve divergences are splits that are separated by
only a few Myr. These involve e.g. the treeshrew, bat, primate, Glires, and the Boreoplacentalia and Xenafrotheria
divergence.

expressed sequence tag data [14,30], and now phylogenomic analyses, which cover 10% of the coding region of
the genome. The use of rare genomic characters such as
retroposed elements [7] or indels [11] as cladistic markers
has become an important addition to the analysis of
sequence data.

Discussion
The study of placental mammal relationships has drawn
the attention of generations of scientists. However, the
resolution of the mammalian tree has been problematic
and many relationships remained unresolved or only
poorly supported. Initially phylogenetic studies were
made on morphological data from recent and fossil spe-

The steadily increasing amount of genomic sequence data
from placental mammals does not only allow an everdeeper insight into their evolution, but it also allows
development of rigorous data handling procedures. A central aim in all phylogenomic analyses is selecting orthologous sequences for data analysis. The lack of complete

most phylogenetic analyses orthology is determined by a
sequence similarity criterion [6,32] or choosing from a
pre-determined database of orthologous sequences, such
as COG [33] and the orthologs matrix project, OMA [34].
These databases usually use similarity criteria too and are
sometimes combined with manual curation for increasing
the confidence in the orthology of the sequences.
In the mammalian genome, the ratio of gene to gene family is about two and the size of about half of the gene families have changed during mammalian evolution [35]. The
globin genes are a textbook example of such gene families
[36]. The human beta hemoglobin family has six members that have been duplicated at different times during
evolution of mammals and they fulfill different functions.
Other mammals, such as goat and sheep, which have different history of gene duplications, have as many as 13
members of the beta hemoglobin family [37]. Thus, there
is a considerable risk that the orthology of sequences from
gene families cannot be securely established, unless by
laborious case-to-case studies for each gene and each species involved. Such an approach is prohibitive for largescale phylogenetic analyses.
The rigorous approach of the data assembly, recursive
BLAST, in our analysis excludes the vast majority of
sequences from multi-gene families, which are the source
of paralogous sequences, from the analysis. Already the
first filtering step successfully removed sequences from
typical gene families. While this is no formal proof that all
genes from gene families were removed, it is conceivable

that other, less thoroughly studied, gene families were
also eliminated from the analysis during this process.
Thus, the risk for including paralogous sequences in the
current analysis was greatly reduced by the recursive
BLAST approach.
The data collection and filtering produced a 2.8 Mbp long
dataset composed of 3012 alignments of inferred transcripts from genes for 21 mammalian and one avian species with a moderate evolutionary rate. This alignment is
well suited for studying deep phylogenetic divergences in
the placental tree. The compositional bias of the data
remained to be a major obstacle in the analysis, which
could not be overcome for most sequences by recoding
the sequences to R/Y. However, congruency of the reconstructed trees with analyses using a non-stationary model,
indicate that compositional bias does not influence the
tree topology to a greater extend. Further and less welldefined systematic errors are a general threat to phylogenetic analysis [38] and are the source for strong support
for erroneous relationships. Removing sites with more
than three different aa, i.e relatively variable sites, or analyzing different data partitions according to evolutionary

The reconstructed phylogeny is largely congruent with
that of previous studies. Most analyses favor a basal divergence of Xenafrotheria and Boreoplacentalia. This split is
supported by phylogenomic sequence analyses, two retroposon insertions and indels [2,4,11]. The revised naming
of the Boreoeutheria clade is preferable to the previously
used term, because of the improved consistency and logic.
Recent naming of new clades were largely based on molecular phylogenetics, which by definition exclude the stem
group members of a clade. Thus, the term "eutheria" in
the formerly used Boreoeutheria encompasses also stem
group eutherians only known from the fossil record. In
comparison "placentalia" describes the respective clade
more accurately, referring only to crown group members,
which are accessible for molecular studies [13].
The elephant and tenrec group, as expected, in the Afrotheria clade [9]. The Boreoplacentalia are split into Laurasiatheria and Eurchontoglires, the latter with a wellsupported Glires clade. Within the rodents the guinea pig
fell between Myomorpha (rat and mouse) and Sciuromorpha (squirrel), which is consistent with some previous
findings of partially constraint tree analyses [6], but
inconsistent with some mitogenomic studies, which find
the squirrel (Sciuridae) closer to the muroid mouse and
rat to the exclusion of the guinea pig [39].
The phylogenetic position of the treeshrew (Scandentia)
within the Euarchontoglires was problematic even when
analyzing nearly 3 Mnt of protein coding data. The uncertainty of placing the treeshrews among placental mammals is evident from the numerous positions it had been
placed on the tree in previous studies. The treeshrews have
been placed as the first divergence among Euarchontaglires [40,41], as sister group to Lagomorpha or rodents
[42], sister group to Dermoptera [6], sister group to primates [5] or part of the traditional Archonta clade outside
a ((Primates, Dermoptera), Chiroptera) clade [43]. Two
recent studies on rare genomic changes, found support for
a grouping the treeshrew with primates, from four indels
[40] and five retroposed elements [41] respectively. This
conforms with our sequence analysis based findings.
The placement of the bat as sister group to the cow in most
ML analyses is highly unexpected and has not been proposed in any other analyses. Currently the result can only
be regarded as peculiar. The only alternative place of the
bat that cannot be rejected by ML analysis of aa sequences
is on a common branch to the Lipotyphla (hedge-

hog+shrew). This grouping receives inconclusive 64%
bootstrap support. Mitogenomic and nuclear gene data
generally find the bat (Chiroptera) as the sister group to
Cetferungulata [3,6,44], which is the currently preferred
hypothesis. The notable exception to the general consensus came from a recent retroposon analysis that found
support for a sister group relationship of Chiroptera to
Perissodactyla plus Carnivora [45]. If this particular relationship was supported by our sequence data, the bat
would have been placed on the carnivore branch, because
there is no species from Perissodactyla present in our data
set. However, ML analyses can exclude a relationship of
the bat and carnivores and most alternative positions with
high statistical confidence.

pool of another. It has been estimated that such hybridization can occur up to 7–17 Myr after separation in birds
[47] and thus probably also in mammals. Cattle-zebu (Bos
taurus – Bos indicus) hybrids are common and fully fertile
despite that the respective lineages have been separated
for 1–2 Myr [48]. There are surprisingly many examples
where viable, fertile and even well adapted offspring form
by species hybridization in mammals [18,49,50]. It has
been estimated that 10% of all animals (6% of European
mammals), actually hybridize with at least one other species [47]. Many more may have gone through a phase of
hybridization that remains undetected, because the species that now are observed to hybridize are usually the
evolutionarily youngest.

Systematic errors can never be formally excluded as a
cause for reconstructing inaccurate relationships. Therefore we have investigated the effect of two major sources
of systematic error, namely highly variable sites and
highly variable sequences [38]. The exclusion or separate
analyses of these had no clear consequence on the reconstructed topology. Until genome data from further species
become available for analysis, we regard the phylogenetic
position of the bat as unsettled by genomic sequence data.

Another process that can obscure phylogenetic analysis is
lineage sorting. Lineage sorting is the result of an ancestral
polymorphism that survives a speciation event, succeeded
by fixation of different alleles in the descendant lineages.
This gives rise to a gene history that is incongruent with
the species' history [17]. The extent to which lineage sorting jumbles the genome of closely related species has
recently been investigated for the anthropoid genomes,
i.e. the genomes of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and
orangutan. For about one quarter of the human genome
gorilla and not chimpanzee is the closest genetic relative
[51]. In 0.04% of the studied genes the human sequence
share closest ancestry even with the orangutan. Lineage
sorting is currently the favored hypothesis to explain the
mosaic of the primate genomes [51,52]. However, other
natural processes such as hybridization have been used to
explain the fact that some parts of the genome are more
similar between human and gorilla than between human
and chimpanzee [53,54].

The divergences among the placental mammal orders in
this study occurred between ≈100 and ≈80 Mya, thus well
inside the Cretaceous (140–65 Mya) and agrees with previous molecular based estimates on mitogenomic and
phylogenomic data [2,11,23] but is in steep contrast with
some recent interpretations of the fossil record [46]. Many
ordinal and higher level divergences occur within a few
Myr from each other. TF estimates the Xenafrotheria and
Boreoplacentalia divergence ≈100 Mya and the first split
within these clades is estimated to ≈98 Mya and ≈95 Mya.
The r8s estimates are somewhat younger, but present the
same picture. Similarly, the Euarchontoglires clade
diverges at ≈87 Mya into Glires and Euarchonta, and at
≈85 Mya into treeshrew (Scandentia) and the primate lineage. These splits are remarkably close to each other and
would prove problematic to resolve even from recent species. One major problem of resolving short divergence
time intervals is that an insufficient amount of phylogenetic information accumulates in these short intervals.
This obstacle can usually be overcome simply by increasing the amount of data, which is the current strategy in
phylogenomic analyses.
The other, more severe, problem that cannot as easily be
solved is connected to genomic processes around speciation. Before closely related species become completely
genetically isolated they can hybridize with each other.
This poses a problem for phylogenetic analysis, because
the species history can be obscured by introgression, the
incorporation of genes from one species into the gene

Finally, a process with a similar effect on the genome as
species hybridization is hybrid speciation [19], which
may be a new and radical explanation for the concoction
of the mammalian genome. In this process two previously
isolated sister-species hybridize and give offspring to a
new and possibly better-adapted species [19]. While such
a process is common in plants, there is growing evidence
that this also occurs in animals, including vertebrates
[50,55].
Which of these processes, lineage sorting or hybridization,
has the dominating effect on the mammalian genome
cannot be determined yet and needs to be studied in more
detail. In any case, these processes seem to have a sizeable
impact on the resolution of short internal branches of the
mammalian tree and phylogenetic reconstruction in general. The studies of the jumbled anthropoid genomes
[51,53,54] are the first to put some exact values on the
amount of gene trees that are incongruent with the species
tree.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:162

It must be recognized that there is a non-negligible chance
that a fair amount of single loci have a history that is not
compatible with the species history. Therefore introgression or linage sorting are problematic especially to supertree analyses [56] and analyses from rare genomic events
[57]. In these approaches of phylogenetic reconstruction
many branches are only supported by single or at most a
few genes or loci. Incompatibilities in the support from
the analysis of retroposon insertion for basal and ordinal
mammalian divergences [7,11,45] probably document
introgression or linage sorting events that confound the
genome history. Probably the only solution is the collection of large amounts of information as in phylogenomic
analyses in the hope that the massive amount of data
evens out events that lead to a genome history that is
inconsistent with the species history. Large phylogenomic
analyses produce a tree that, at least on average, reflects
the species history.
Completely or nearly completely sequenced genome data
are becoming available for phylogenomic analysis of
mammalian relationships at an increasing rate. This
allows ever more detailed reconstruction of their history
and their major branches are becoming with time more
consistently recovered. However, some mammalian relationships will require more detailed studies of their history, taking into account that the genome is not a fixed
entity but malleable by speciation events.

Conclusion
Phylogenomic analysis of 3,012 genes (2,844,615 nucleotides) from 19 placental mammal species could significantly resolve most relationships and date their basal
divergences in the Cretaceous at 100 – 90 Mya. However,
the mammalian divergences that occurred in very narrow
time windows of 2–4 Myr remain surprisingly difficult to
resolve, even by the huge amount of genomic data. Divergences of lineages that are now considered to be orders,
started as speciation events even if they occurred millions
of years ago. Recent species that have been separated for
about the same amount of time can still hybridize and
have fully fertile offspring, leading to introgression, or
may be affected by lineage sorting that results in a gene
history that is different from the species history. Thus,
some deep mammalian divergences that are separated by
only a few Myr appear to be affected by speciation processes that obscure the phylogenetic reconstruction.

europaeus (western european hedgehog), Loxodonta africana (African elephant), Echinops telfairi (tenrec), Dasypus
novemcinctus (armadillo), Monodelphis domestica (opossum), Ornithorhynchus anatinus (platypus) and Gallus gallus (chicken). These species represent 12 of the 21 extant
eutherian orders. One species from each of Metatheria
(marsupials) and Prototheria (monotremes), and finally
Aves (bird) served as outgroups to the placental mammals.
In order to avoid including paralogous sequences in the
alignment we developed a new search strategy that aims at
excluding sequences that stem from recent gene duplications. This approach can identify and eliminate duplicated sequences that exist in several rather similar copies
within each genome. This decreases the risk of including
paralogous sequences in the analysis.
The first step of the data collection process is a "recursive
BLAST search". It was conducted by searching each human
sequence against all human sequences using BLAST [58]
with a cutoff E-value of 10-12. Sequences that had identified transcripts originating from more than one gene were
excluded from further investigation. In cases where several
transcripts of different lengths from the same gene were
found, supposedly representing different splicing variants, only the longest sequence was retained.
In the second step, human sequences that passed the criteria of the first step were used for searching for similar
genes in other species. The human sequences were used in
a BLAST search against each of the species' databases with
a cutoff E-value of 10-12. The sequence with the highest Evalue score was kept for further examination. In the third
step, the sequence from step two was used for a recursive
BLAST search with a cutoff E-value of 10-12 against the
same species. Similar to step one, only sequences with a
single hit were kept for further analysis.
Finally, genes for which sequences could be found for
fewer than 16 of the 22 species were removed. Sequences
shorter than 300 bp were also removed. The remaining
sequences were translated to amino acids and multiple
sequence alignments were created using MUSCLE [59].
Sequences with more than 30% observed (p) distance at
the aa level for any species pair were removed. The aa
alignments were then used as a template for creating
nucleotide sequence alignments using the original,
untranslated sequences.

Prior to the phylogenetic reconstruction the data set was
analyzed for identifying compositional biases and other
anomalies that could possibly influence the tree reconstruction. A chi-square test on compositional homogeneity was performed on the base frequencies, R/Y recoded
nucleotide sequences, (A and G sites were coded R
(purine) and T and C were coded to Y (pyrimidine)) and
aa sequences. In addition the sequence data were analyzed by maximum likelihood (ML) using the PAML
v.3.15 program baseml [22] with a non-stationary model
(nhomo = 3), that allows for different base composition
on different branches [60]. The R/Y recoding and ML analysis with a non-stationary model was done for detecting
reconstruction artifacts that may be caused by compositional biases, but did not replace the standard ML analysis.
The alignment was also inspected for any grossly deviating
distances between human and platypus that might have
escaped detection during the data collection process. The
p distances between human and platypus were calculated
in a sliding window of 800 amino acids, that was moved
400 steps for each calculation until the end of the concatenated alignment was reached. These two species were arbitrarily chosen to represent one of the most distant
mammal species pairs in this analysis and for one
(human) of which the most complete genomic data are
available.
Due to the size of the data set most programs were apparently not able to analyze the fully concatenated data properly. ML analyses could be performed on the full
alignment with Treefinder version June 2007 [61] only.
Other programs such as TREE-PUZZLE [62], PHYML [63]
or PAML either crashed or required a seemingly infinite
amount time to finish a single analysis. For the ML analysis with PAML the data were randomly partitioned into
manageable data packages and the results combined with
the "totalml" program from PHYML. The nt tree was
reconstructed by TF with the GTR model [64] with rate
heterogeneity assuming eight classes of gamma distributed rate categories [65] and one class of invariable sites
(8Γ + I). The analyses of aa sequences were performed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/162

using the WAG2000 model [66] applying rate heterogeneity (8Γ + I). Uncertain or controversial relationships were
further analyzed by an extended ML analysis where different possible topologies were statistically evaluated in TF
using Shimodaira-Hasegawa probabilities, pSH [67]. For
these comparative analyses an additional analysis with a
codon substitution model was performed in PAML with
rate heterogeneity (8Γ). ML Bootstrap support values were
calculated from 100 replicates of aa and nt sequences. The
analysis was done on the Bioportal cluster on University
of Oslo running TF for 28 days.
The data were randomly divided into several partitions of
approximately 300,000 nt (100 kaa) for Bayesian inference using MrBayes 3.1.2 [68], running for 1,000,000
Markov chain Monte Carlo generations with one cold and
three heated chains, discarding the first 100,000 generations as burn-in and then sampling each 100th tree. R/Y
coded sequences that were analyzed using a two-state ML
model [21] with (4Γ+I). Partitioned analysis was performed in TF and MrBayes with data partition according
to codon positions. The data were also partitioned into
alignments with an overall aa distance of 2%, 4%, 6%,
8%, 10% and >12% and analyzed separately by ML.
Finally the data were also analyzed by ML after removing
sites with more than three different aa sites.
In addition to the analysis of the concatenated data we
analyzed alignments from individual genes with full
taxon sampling (402 alignments, 501,012 bp) separately
with PAML, both for nt and aa sequence data. The likelihood values were then combined with totalml [63] and
the bootstrap probabilities were recorded.
Divergence times were estimated from both aa and nt
sequence data using the nonparametric rate smoothing
method on a logarithmic scale (NPRS-LOG) implemented in TF and using the r8s program [69] applying the
NPRS method and the POWELL algorithm. The eight fossil-based age constraints that were used to calibrate the
tree were taken from Benton & Donoghue [70] and are
listed in Table 5. Mean values and their standard devia-
