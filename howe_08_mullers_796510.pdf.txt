Abstract
Background: The theory of Muller' Ratchet predicts that small asexual populations are doomed
to accumulate ever-increasing deleterious mutation loads as a consequence of the magnified power
of genetic drift and mutation that accompanies small population size. Evidence for Muller's Ratchet
and knowledge on its underlying molecular mechanisms, however, are lacking for natural
populations.
Results: We characterized mitochondrial genome evolutionary processes in Caenorhabditis
briggsae natural isolates to show that numerous lineages experience a high incidence of
nonsynonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes and accumulate unusual deleterious
noncoding DNA stretches with associated heteroplasmic function-disrupting genome deletions.
Isolate-specific deletion proportions correlated negatively with nematode fecundity, suggesting that
these deletions might negatively affect C. briggsae fitness. However, putative compensatory
mutations were also observed that are predicted to reduce heteroplasmy levels of deleterious
deletions. Paradoxically, compensatory mutations were observed in one major intraspecific C.
briggsae clade where population sizes are estimated to be very small (and selection is predicted to
be relatively weak), but not in a second major clade where population size estimates are much
larger and selection is expected to be more efficient.
Conclusion: This study provides evidence that the mitochondrial genomes of animals evolving in
nature are susceptible to Muller's Ratchet, suggests that context-dependent compensatory
mutations can accumulate in small populations, and predicts that Muller's Ratchet can affect
fundamental evolutionary forces such as the rate of mutation.

Background
Evolutionary theory predicts that mutational decay is
inevitable for small asexual populations, provided deleterious mutation rates are high enough. Such populations
are expected to experience the effects of Muller's Ratchet
[1,2] where the most-fit class of individuals is lost at some
rate due to chance alone, leaving the second-best class to
ultimately suffer the same fate, and so on, leading to a

gradual decline in mean fitness. The mutational meltdown theory [3,4] built upon Muller's Ratchet to predict a
synergism between mutation and genetic drift in promoting the extinction of small asexual populations that are at
the end of a long genomic decay process. Regardless of
reproductive mode, mitochondrial genomes from most
animal species are expected to be particularly sensitive to
Muller's Ratchet due to their uniparental inheritance, high

mutation rates and lack of effective recombination
[3,5,6]. The genomic decay effects of Muller's Ratchet have
been observed in laboratory evolution experiments with
abiotic RNA molecules [7], biotic RNA viruses [8], bacteria [9] and yeast [10]. Indirect evidence for the effects of
Muller's Ratchet in nature has resulted from studies on the
long-term effects of reduced population sizes on genetic
diversity and fitness in amphibians [11], greater prairie
chickens [12,13] and New Zealand avifauna [14]. Molecular evidence for Muller's Ratchet has resulted from analyses of deleterious tRNA gene structures encoded by
mitochondrial genomes [15] and analyses of Drosophila
sex chromosome evolution [16]. However, direct knowledge on the susceptibilities of natural populations to
Muller's Ratchet and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain enigmatic.
Caenorhabditis briggsae, like Caenorhabditis elegans, is a selfreproducing hermaphroditic nematode species that also
produces males capable of outcrossing with hermaphrodites. Analyses of linkage disequilibrium patterns in C.
briggsae natural isolates suggest a very low outcrossing rate
of ~3.9 × 10-5 [17]. The same study reported population
subdivision between C. briggsae strains collected in temperate localities versus those from tropical regions and
nuclear silent-site nucleotide diversity (πS) for the tropical
isolates was estimated at 2.7 × 10-3 – a number highly similar to global estimates for C. elegans [18]. The C. briggsae
isolates from temperate localities, however, showed a
remarkably lower mean πS value of 4.0 × 10-5. A direct estimate of the neutral base substitution mutation rate (9.0 ×
10-9 per site per generation) is available from C. elegans
mutation-accumulation lines [19] that can be used along
with πS data to estimate the effective population size (Ne)
[20]. Assuming a common mutation rate between C. elegans and C. briggsae, Ne is estimated to be ~63,000 for C.
briggsae tropical isolates. For the C. briggsae temperate isolates, a much smaller Ne of ~1,000 is estimated. Based on
these and other observations, it is hypothesized that C.
briggsae only recently (in the last few hundred years) colonized temperate latitudes from small founding populations [17]. Furthermore, there is evidence for a ~2-fold
elevated mutation rate in C. briggsae as compared to C. elegans [21] that leads to correspondingly lower Ne estimates
for C. briggsae: ~31,500 for tropical populations and ~500
for temperate populations. The combination of very low
outcrossing rates, small Ne and high mutation rates are
expected to render C. briggsae natural mitochondrial lineages susceptible to the effects of Muller's Ratchet-associated deleterious mutation accumulation.
To probe for the effects of Muller's Ratchet in C. briggsae
natural populations, we sequenced nearly complete mitochondrial genomes from multiple geographically diverse
C. briggsae natural isolates and characterized molecular

evolutionary processes by comparing nucleotide diversity
patterns in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) protein-coding
genes between the temperate- and tropical-clade C.
briggsae isolates, characterizing heteroplasmic genome
deletions using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
approaches and evaluating correlations of various natural
mitochondrial genome haplotypes with nematode fecundity and fitness.

Results and Discussion
Noncoding DNA accumulation in Caenorhabditis
mitochondrial genomes
To search for natural mutational decay in C. briggsae, we
analyzed nearly complete mitochondrial genome
sequences (13,430/14,420 total bp) from 24 geographically diverse C. briggsae natural isolates (Table 1). mtDNA
sequences were amplified as four overlapping long PCR
products (3–5 kb in size each) that were directly
sequenced using a combination of PCR and internal
sequencing primers (see Methods). A complete mitochondrial genome sequence for C. briggsae isolate AF16 is available from Genbank (accession # NC_009885) and was
used as a reference for primer design. The mitochondrial
genome AT-region constituted the only mtDNA segment
not analyzed in the C. briggsae natural isolates – as with C.
elegans [22], efforts to sequence through this highly ATrich region proved unsuccessful. Each isolate was found to
encode a unique mitochondrial genome haplotype.

We discovered that most C. briggsae mitochondrial
genomes harbor two presumed noncoding regions that
are homologous to and likely derive from the NADH
dehydrogenase 5 (ND5) protein-coding gene. The first
ND5-like element (named ψND5-1) was identified
between two tRNA genes, whereas the second larger element (ψND5-2) resides between the ND3 and ND5 protein-coding genes (Figure 1). ψND5-1 and ψND5-2
display 89.3% and 88.0% sequence identity, respectively,
to homologous regions of the C. briggsae ND5 gene. There
is 94.1% sequence identity between ψND5-1 and ψND52. We subjected the ψND5-1 and ψND5-2 sequences to
conceptual translation using the appropriate genetic code
in MEGA4 [23] to discover the presence of numerous
internal stop codons, suggesting that these elements do
not encode functional protein products. Whereas all 24 C.
briggsae mtDNA sequences analyzed were found to harbor
ψND5-1, only 22/24 isolates harbored ψND5-2 – this element was missing from the two Kenya isolate (ED3092,
ED3101) mitochondrial genomes [24]. Although the
mitochondrial genomes of C. elegans and C. remanei were
found not to encode ψND5 elements, that of Caenorhabditis sp. n. 5 (isolate JU727), a recently-identified gonochoristic sister species to C. briggsae [25], was discovered to
encode a divergent form of ψND5-1 (see Additional file
1).

Strain BW287 (identified by asterisk) has historically been known as a
nematode in the genus Panagrolaimus; nuclear ribosomal DNA and
mtDNA sequencing carried out in the Denver lab, involving strains
obtained from three different sources, agree that this isolate is instead
a strain of C. briggsae. EG4207A was established from a single
nematode picked from EG4207 that constituted a C. briggsae lab
population initially established from many nematodes. For Clade, TE
indicates the temperate intraspecific clade, TR the tropical clade and
KE the Kenya clade. Fecundity shows the mean numbers of progeny
produced for each isolate (four worms assayed per strain) and the S.
E. M. is shown in parentheses.

To investigate the evolutionary relationships of C. briggsae
natural isolate hermaphrodite lineages and the origins of
ψND5-1 and ψND5-2, we subjected the mtDNA
sequences to phylogenetic analyses using MEGA4 [23].
Mitochondrial genome sequences from C. elegans (accession # NC_001328), Caenorhabditis remanei (W. K. Thomas, unpublished data) and Caenorhabditis sp. n. 5 (a
recently-discovered gonochoristic sister species to C.
briggsae – sequences collected here for isolate JU727) were
used as outgroups. All mtDNA sequences were used for
phylogenetic analyses, with the exception of ψND5-1 and
ψND5-2 regions since determining their origins was one
aim of the phylogenetic studies. Maximum parsimony
and neighbor-joining analyses yielded trees with identical
topologies. The phylogenies revealed the presence of three
major, well-supported intraspecific C. briggsae clades that
we refer to as the temperate, tropical and Kenya clades
(Figure 2). The temperate and tropical clades form a
monophyletic superclade, referred to as the global superclade, to the exclusion of the divergent Kenya clade. The

phylogenetic distributions of isolates into these clades are
highly congruent with previous phylogenetic analyses
based on nuclear intron and protein-coding gene
sequences [17]. The absence of ψND5-2 in the mitochondrial genomes of the two Kenya clade C. briggsae isolates
and other Caenorhabditis species suggests that this element
originated in the lineage leading to the C. briggsae global
superclade. The presence of ψND5-1 in all C. briggsae isolates and Caenorhabditis sp. n. 5, but not other Caenorhabditis species, suggests that this element originated in the
common ancestor of C. briggsae and Caenorhabditis sp. n.
5 (Figure 2).
With the exception of the AT-region, the vast majority of
other animal mitochondrial genomes examined are
devoid of similar extensive stretches of noncoding DNA
[26]. Based on a recent population-genetic theory on the
evolution of genome complexity [27] that predicts higher
noncoding DNA accumulation probabilities in species of
small population size due to a magnified power of genetic
drift, the accumulation and persistence of ψND5 elements
in C. briggsae mitochondrial genomes is consistent with
the hypothesis that natural C. briggsae lineages experience
very small population sizes that are essential for genomic
decay associated with Muller's Ratchet. ψND5-1, however,
occurs in both C. briggsae and the obligately outcrossing
species Caenorhabditis sp. n. 5. The ψND5-1 element
might have accumulated in the (presumably gonochoristic) ancestor of C. briggsae and Caenorhabditis sp. n. 5 as a
consequence of Muller's Ratchet since nematode mtDNA
is inherited through the hermaphrodite/female lineage
and is not known to undergo intergenomic recombination. Only two natural isolates from China are presently
known and available Caenorhabditis sp. n. 5 [28]; thus, we
are presently unable to effectively characterize the population-genetic environment in which Caenorhabditis sp. n. 5
evolves. Future comparative analyses of ψND5-1 molecular evolution between these two species, however, might
provide important insights into the role of outcrossing in
eliminating deleterious mutations from natural populations.
Heteroplasmic mitochondrial genome deletions
Upon further analyzing the ψND5-2 region in the C.
briggsae natural isolates, we found that some strains harbor a large heteroplasmic mitochondrial genome deletion
(871–887 bp, depending on isolate) that eliminated the
3' end of ψND5-2 and the 5' end (first 786 bp) of the ND5
protein-coding gene (Figure 1 and 3A). Directly repeated
DNA sequence tracts in ND5 and the upstream ψND5-2
element flank the heteroplasmic ND5 deletion allele and
are likely to play a causative role in promoting the deletions as direct repeats are also associated with heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA deletions in C. elegans mutationaccumulations lines [6] and aging nematodes [29]. The

observed deletion is expected to strongly and negatively
affect ND5 protein-coding function as the deleted
sequences encode more than 200 ND5 amino acids, 34 of
which are conserved in C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster
and humans. The ψND5-2 region and associated heteroplasmic ND5 gene deletion was initially discovered in
long PCR amplifications of C. briggsae natural isolate
mitochondrial genome segments. The observation of the
heteroplasmic deletion allele across multiple independent long PCR reactions (3 to 5 kb amplicons) that span
many mtDNA genes provides strong evidence that the
deletion is not a nuclear sequence of mitochondrial origin
(numt), but rather a heteroplasmic mtDNA allelic variant.
Furthermore, we have searched for the deletion-bearing
sequences in the published C. briggsae nuclear genome
sequence and found no evidence for the presence of a candidate numt. We also found no evidence for heteroplasmic deletions associated with ψND5-1.
To better understand the relative abundances of ND5
deletion-bearing and intact mitochondrial genomes
among C. briggsae natural isolates, we applied both conventional PCR and qPCR approaches. Although initial
exploratory studies used bulk DNA extracts from large
mixed-stage cultures, our assays were ultimately applied

to genomic DNA samples derived from individual L1stage (first larval stage) nematodes – four independent
individuals were assayed per isolate. Initial conventional
PCR assays employed a forward primer in the ND3 gene
(upstream of ψND5-2) and a reverse primer in ND5
sequences downstream of the heteroplasmic deletion –
genomic DNA samples from most global superclade C.
briggsae isolates yielded one or two PCR products, one
being ~1700 bp (intact genomes) and a second that is
~800 bp (deletion-bearing genomes) – see Figure 3A.
DNA samples from the two isolates from Kenya (lack
ψND5-2) produced single amplicons of intermediate size,
as expected. This PCR reaction was carried out for four
independent single-worm genomic DNA samples from
each of the 22 global-clade C. briggsae natural isolates analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis; gel banding patterns were scored to evaluate heteroplasmy patterns in
their mitochondrial genomes. In particular, gels were
scored on the basis of whether amplified products
resulted from intact genomes only, deletion-bearing
genomes only, or from both intact and deletion-bearing
genomes. Substantial PCR product banding pattern variation was observed (see Additional file 2) – among the 88
individual worms assayed, 65 produced only amplicons
from intact genomes, 23 yielded amplicons from both

loci [17].

intact and deletion-bearing genomes and 3 (all from isolate HK105) exclusively produced amplicons from deletion-bearing genomes.
Although the conventional PCR approach suggested
extensive among-isolate variation in deletion heteroplasmy levels, a qPCR approach was applied to provide a
more quantitative characterization of variation in the proportion of ND5 deletion-bearing genomes to the total
among the isolates. qPCRs were carried out using the
same genomic DNA samples that were used for the conventional PCR assays (four individuals per isolate). One
set of qPCR primers amplified a ND5 region present only
in intact genomes (5' end of the gene) and a second
amplified a 16S rRNA region present in both deletionbearing and intact genomes for which there is no evidence
of heteroplasmy (see Methods). The nematode-specific
proportions of genomes bearing ND5 deletions were calculated by dividing the estimated abundance of intact
genomes by that of the total mitochondrial genomes, and
then subtracting that number from one. Estimated deletion-bearing genome proportions from qPCR results correlated positively with conventional PCR band scoring
data (Spearman rank correlation = 0.74, P < 10-15) and
revealed substantial among-isolate variation in ND5 deletion heteroplasmy levels (Figure 3B). ND5 deletion-bearing genomes were observed to accumulate in both the
temperate and tropical intraspecific C. briggsae clades.
Two isolates (HK105, VT847) showed remarkably high
deletion genotype proportions greater than 40%. Interestingly, these two isolates were collected from islands
(Table 1) where populations might have been recently
established from very small populations where drift is
expected to play a particularly dominant role [20]. However, other island isolates (e.g. HK104, JU439) displayed
low deletion proportions. Although it cannot be ruled out
that changes in heteroplasmy levels occurred while nematodes were maintained in laboratory culture after collection from nature, most (at least 19/24) of the C. briggsae
isolates considered here constitute strains recently collected from the wild [17] that did not spend substantial
time in laboratory culture before being stored as cryogenically-preserved frozen stocks. Although similar heteroplasmic mitochondrial genome deletions have been
observed in laboratory-bottlenecked C. elegans mutationaccumulation lines [6] and are associated with rare mitochondrial myopathies in humans [30], the widespread
occurrence and persistence of such deleterious mitochondrial gene deletions in natural populations is unprecedented.
To investigate the potential effects of deletion-bearing
molecules on organismal fitness, we next assayed variation in lifetime fecundity in the C. briggsae natural isolates. The mean fecundity observed across all 24 C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/62

briggsae isolates assayed was 138.6 progeny, a number
remarkably smaller than that for C. elegans (273.6 progeny [31]), but consistent with previously-reported fitness
disparities between these two species [21]. A significantly
negative correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.41, P < 0.05) was observed for isolate-specific deletion
genotype proportions and nematode fecundities. Furthermore, the two isolates with the highest mean fecundity
values were the two from the Kenya clade (ED3092,
ED3101 – see Table 1) that do not encode ψND5-2 or
experience associated ND5 deletion events. These observations suggest that the accumulation of deletion-bearing
mitochondrial genomes might strongly and negatively
affect fitness in C. briggsae natural populations. The
present study, however, is unable to disentangle the fitness effects of mitochondrial and nuclear loci – it is possible that there exist deleterious nuclear loci that are
responsible for reduced fitness in these lines rather than
the high deletion levels. We expected to observe higher
ND5 deletion proportions in the temperate-clade C.
briggsae isolates as compared to those of the tropical clade
as a consequence of reduced efficiency of natural selection
associated with smaller Ne estimates in the former group.
However, no significant differences in ND5 deletion heteroplasmy levels were observed between these two groups
(P > 0.9, two-tailed t-test).
Accumulation of putative ψND5-2 compensatory
mutations
The heteroplasmic ND5 deletion observed in the C.
briggsae natural isolates is flanked by directly repeated
DNA sequence stretches in homologous regions of
ψND5-2 and ND5 – one repeat copy remains in deletionbearing genomes. We characterized patterns of sequence
divergence at the 21 bp of directly repeated DNA sequence
in the C. briggsae isolates and discovered the presence of
three different haplotype sequences for the repeat unit
present in ψND5-2 (Figure 4A); all isolates had identical
sequences at the ND5 repeat unit. For the ψND5-2 repeat
unit, the majority of isolates encoded an ancestral
sequence (named DRSeq1 – see Figure 4A) that was identical to that present downstream in ND5. In the temperate
clade, however, two divergent derived haplotype
sequences were observed in the ψND5-2 direct repeat
(DRSeq2 and DRSeq3), each containing two sequence differences relative to the downstream ND5 repeat, that are
expected to render the isolates encoding these divergent
sequences less susceptible to direct repeat-associated
intragenomic deletion events as compared to the DRSeq1
repeat unit. Consistent with this expectation, isolates that
encode DRSeq2 display significantly lower ND5 deletion
proportions as compared to those that encode DRSeq1 (P
< 0.05, two-tailed t-test) – see Figure 4B. Isolates encoding
DRSeq3 also show lower ND5 deletion levels, though the
difference as compared to those that encode DRSeq1 is

not significant (P > 0.10, two-tailed t-test). When considered as groups, mean heteroplasmic deletion levels were
higher in tropical-clade isolates (12.1%) as compared to
temperate-clade isolates (7.3%), though the difference
was not significant (P > 0.9, two-tailed t-test). We also
analyzed fecundity variation with respect to the three
sequence motifs and found that isolates encoding DRSeq2
displayed significantly elevated fecundity as compared to
those encoding DRSeq1 (P < 0.001, two-tailed t-test) – see
Figure 4C. Fecundities in isolates encoding DRSeq3 and
DRSeq1, however, were highly similar and not significantly different (P > 0.1, two-tailed t-test). The relatively
low ND5 deletion proportions and high fecundities asso-

ciated with isolates encoding DRSeq2 are suggestive of
compensatory mutation – in particular, the ψND5-2 substitutions are expected to result in reduced interactions of
directly repeated sequences in ψND5-2 and ND5, thereby
resulting in lower ND5 deletion incidences and higher fitness. However, we are again unable to account for the
potential effects of nuclear loci.
These ψND5-2 substitutions that likely promote reduced
ND5 deletion proportions (DRSeq2, DRSeq3) are
observed in the C. briggsae intraspecific temperate clade
where Ne estimates are much lower than that of the tropical clade [17] and, thus, natural selection for compensa-

tory mutations is expected to be less efficient. All tropical
clade isolates analyzed encode DRSeq1. However, recent
work in phage mutation-accumulation experiments suggests an increase in the relative incidence of beneficial
mutations as fitness decreases in association with deleterious mutation accumulation [32]. Our results provide
empirical support for this hypothesis in natural animal
populations – any mutations in ψND5-2 that result in
reduced incidences of direct repeat-induced ND5 deletion
events are expected to be advantageous. We propose that
the occurrence of one highly deleterious mutational event
(i.e. the ψND5-2 insertion and associated ND5 deletion
events) presents a novel mutational target in the mitochondrial genome where most all new mutations are
expected to reduce homology between ψND5-2 and ND5,
thus reducing the likelihood of deleterious mitochondrial
genome deletions. Consequently, such new mutations
that result in increased divergence between ψND5-2 and
ND5 can be characterized as advantageous compensatory
mutations. The fact that these candidate compensatory
mutations were observed in the temperate clade (where
Ne estimates are relatively small and natural selection is
expected to be relatively inefficient) and not the tropical
clade (where Ne estimates are relatively large and natural
selection is expected to be relatively more efficient) is puzzling. Although the evolutionary causes of these putative
compensatory mutations in the temperate clade remains
mysterious, it is possible that the heteroplasmic deletions
are more deleterious in the temperate clade as compared
to the tropical clade and that there is a corresponding difference in the selection coefficients associated with the
candidate compensatory changes observed in the temperate isolates. Another (probably unlikely) possibility is that
the increased fixation probability of these mutations in
smaller populations (i.e. temperate-clade isolates) outweighs the higher population mutation rate experienced
by larger populations (i.e. tropical-clade isolates). Finally,
it is possible that the Ne estimates based on nuclear nucleotide diversity data do not accurately reflect the current
population-genetic environments experienced by these
two intraspecific clades.
After discovery of these putative compensatory mutations,
we again searched for elevated ND5 deletion levels in the
temperate as compared to the tropical isolates, this time
including only those temperate-clade isolates that encode
DRSeq1. Although the estimated ND5 deletion levels
were on average greater in DRSeq1-encoding temperate
isolates (23.0%) versus that of the tropical isolates
(13.1%), the difference was not significant (P > 0.1, twotailed t-test). Fecundities were also highly similar (Table
1) and not significantly different (P > 0.5, two-tailed ttest). Unfortunately, only three of the analyzed temperateclade isolates encode DRSeq1 (Figure 4), thereby severely
limiting our power to detect differences in the propensi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/62

ties of these two intraspecific clades of different Ne estimates to accumulate deleterious ND5 deletions. Future
efforts surveying a greater number of C. briggsae natural
isolates will be required to further probe for the differential effects of Muller's Ratchet between these two clades at
this locus.
Nonsynonymous substitution accumulation in proteincoding genes
In addition to investigating the evolutionary dynamics of
the unusual ψND5 elements, the nearly complete C.
briggsae mitochondrial genome sequences also offer the
opportunity to analyze molecular evolution in the rest of
the genome and, in particular, the twelve mtDNA proteincoding genes. The relative efficiency of natural selection in
preventing the accumulation of deleterious mutations is
often quantified by considering the relative rates of fixed
nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes [20,33]. We applied a similar approach
to probe for differences between the temperate- (small Ne)
and tropical-clade (large Ne) C. briggsae isolates in their
propensities for accumulating nonsynonymous substitutions. However, because we are comparing non-fixed
nucleotide polymorphism patterns between two intraspecific lineages, we applied the ratio of nucleotide diversity
at nonsynonymous sites (πN) to that at synonymous sites
(πS) as a measure of relative susceptibilities to (presumed)
deleterious nonsynonymous mutation accumulation,
using DnaSP [34]. For ten individual mtDNA protein-coding genes, πN/πS values were compared between isolates of
the C. briggsae temperate clade to those of the C. briggsae
tropical clade. A concatenated data set including codons
from all mtDNA protein-coding genes was also analyzed
and further compared to a comparable data set from 17 C.
elegans natural isolates where there is no evidence of global phylogeographic population structure [22].

We found that the πN/πS ratio was greater in the temperate-clade isolates as compared to the tropical-clade isolates for 8/10 genes (Figure 5). For the concatenated gene
datasets, the πN/πS ratio was higher in the temperate-clade
C. briggsae isolates than that of the tropical-clade C.
briggsae and C. elegans datasets. We attempted to apply
meaningful confidence intervals on the πN and πS estimates using coalescent simulations in DnaSP, however
the small numbers of compared sequences (n = 11 for
each of the temperate and tropical datasets) and low levels
of nucleotide diversity (see Additional file 3) precluded
our ability to do so. Nonetheless, we observed dramatic
magnitudinal differences in πN/πS ratios between the temperate- and tropical-clade C. briggsae isolates that suggest
an increased susceptibility of temperate isolates to the
accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions. The πN/
πS ratio was remarkably high for ND3 in the temperate isolates, being nearly equal to one. These observations sug-

ate (small Ne estimate) versus tropical (larger Ne estimate)
isolates, we were unable to detect a role for Muller's
Ratchet in promoting higher deleterious ND5 deletion
levels in the temperate clade. However, we also observed
the accumulation of putative compensatory mutations
(DRSeq2) in temperate-clade C. briggsae lineages (Figure
4) that likely reduce ND5 deletion levels. The DRSeq2
mutations can only be considered beneficial, however, in
the context of the preexisting deleterious ψND5-2 insertion mutation – in fact, virtually any mutation in ψND52 that reduces its homology to ND5 is likely to be beneficial to some extent.

Figure 5
πN/πS ratios for mtDNA protein-coding genes
πN/πS ratios for mtDNA protein-coding genes. The πN/
πS ratios for ten mtDNA protein-coding genes were calculated for the temperate-clade (black bars, n = 11) and tropical-clade (white bars, n = 11) C. briggsae isolates. Ratios were
not calculated for two mtDNA genes because no nonsynonymous substitutions were observed for ND4L and COII in the
temperate and tropical isolates, respectively. Concatenated
protein-coding gene data files (12 genes) were also analyzed
in the temperate and tropical-clade isolates, as well as in a set
of C. elegans (dashed bar, n = 17) isolates.

gest that C. briggsae temperate isolates are particularly
susceptible to the accumulation of deleterious mutations
throughout the mitochondrial genome, consistent with
expectations based on low Ne in this intraspecific clade.
The specific fitness effects of these nonsynonymous substitutions, however, remain enigmatic and it is possible
that some fraction of them (particularly those encoding
NADH dehydrogenase complex subunits) might be
advantageous in the context of the heteroplasmic ND5
deletion products.

Conclusion
The findings presented here show that in nature C.
briggsae mitochondrial genomes are susceptible to the
accumulation of unusual deleterious mutations that
include the insertion of large noncoding DNA stretches
(Figures 1 and 2), function-disrupting heteroplasmic
genome deletions (Figure 3) and nonsynonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes (Figure 5). This pattern of
molecular evolution is consistent with strong roles for
mutation and random genetic drift in shaping mitochondrial genome evolution in natural populations of this species. These observations, coupled with the strong
potential negative impact of heteroplasmic ND5 deletions
on organismal fitness, also suggest that C. briggsae mitochondrial genomes evolving in nature are vulnerable to
the effects of Muller's Ratchet. Although we did observe
higher πN/πS ratios for protein-coding genes in the temper-

Comparative nematode mutation-accumulation studies
show a significantly elevated deleterious genomic mutation rate in bottlenecked lines derived from C. briggsae
versus C. elegans progenitors [18]. Furthermore, an elevated deleterious mutation rate was estimated for C.
briggsae HK104-derived lines (encode DRSeq1) as compared to MA lines derived from the PB800 isolate that
encodes DRSeq2, the candidate compensatory mutation
that likely reduced ND5 deletion product levels [21]. The
protein product encoded by the ND5 gene, predicted to be
highly impaired in ND5 deletion-bearing genome products, is a central core subunit of Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain [35]. Complex Icompromised organisms in well-studied animal systemsmammals, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans [36-38] – all
produce elevated levels of mutagenic reactive oxygen species. Thus, we predict that C. briggsae ND5 deletion products are mutagenic, and that expression of truncated ND5
protein products results in elevated reactive oxygen species levels. One intriguing hypothesis for the mutational
disparities observed between C. elegans and C. briggsae,
and between HK104 and PB800 (note the close evolutionary relationships between these isolates in Figure 2), is
that the elevated rates are due to increased mutagenic reactive oxygen species levels resulting from ND5 deletion
products (Figure 6). This hypothesis also predicts that
Muller's Ratchet can affect fundamental evolutionary
parameters such as the mutation rate.

Methods
PCR, DNA sequencing and phylogenetics
mtDNA sequencing and PCR were performed as previously described [6,22], with the exception that mitochondrial genome sequences were initially amplified as four
overlapping PCR products 3–5 kb in size each using the
Expand Long Range PCR kit (Roche). e2TAK (Takara)
proofreading DNA polymerase was used for all conventional PCRs. For single-worm DNA extractions, individual
worms were picked at the L1 larval stage and digested in
18 μL of lysis buffer [6,22]. 1 μL was then used for each
PCR. In C. elegans, L1-stage nematodes are estimated to
harbor ~25,000 mitochondrial genomes [39]. MEGA4

Figure 6 of proposed molecular evolutionary causes and consequences of heteroplasmic ND5 deletions
Summary
Summary of proposed molecular evolutionary causes and consequences of heteroplasmic ND5 deletions. The
insertion of ψND5-2 (arrow 1) in the ancestor to the global C. briggsae clade (see Figure 2) is hypothesized to result in direct
repeat-induced intragenomic recombination events (arrow 2) that in turn lead to heteroplasmic ND5 gene deletions (arrow 3).
Expression of truncated ND5 gene products is hypothesized to promote elevated reactive oxygen species levels (arrow 4) that
in turn promote higher mutation rates (arrow 5). Accumulation of substitutions (e.g. DRSeq2) in ψND5-2 direct repeats
(arrow 2a) are hypothesized to cause reduced intragenomic recombination rates, thereby preventing the elevation of reactive
oxygen species levels and associated mutation rate increases.
was used for sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses (both neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony
approaches were applied) [23]. The maximum-composite
likelihood molecular evolution model was used for neighbor-joining analysis. 1,000 bootstrap replicates were performed for all phylogenetic statistical testing. Primer
sequences used for PCR and DNA sequencing are available upon request. DNA sequences generated for this study
were submitted to Genbank under accession numbers
EU407780–EU407805.
qPCR heteroplasmy analysis
qPCR was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real
Time PCR machine using iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with
ROX (Bio-Rad). 1 uL of genomic DNA (diluted 1:5 in
water) was used for each qPCR analysis. To estimate the
total amount of mtDNA in a sample (both intact and deletion-bearing), control primers were designed to amplify a
102 bp region of the small ribosomal RNA subunit that
displayed no evidence of heteroplasmy. A second set of

primers was designed to amplify 101 bp in the 5' end of
the ND5 gene, within the deleted region. This product is
not expected to amplify only in intact genomes. qPCR
data were analyzed to estimate the abundances of the two
genome types using the linear regression approach offered
by the LinRegPCR software [40]. ND5 locus products were
found to amplify more efficiently than ribosomal RNA
products; thus, all ND5 qPCR values were normalized to
account for this disparity. Individual deletion genotype
proportions were calculated by dividing the estimated
abundance of intact genomes by that of the total mitochondrial genomes, and then subtracting that number
from one. Four individual L1-stage nematodes were analyzed per natural isolate – the same nematode genomic
DNA samples used for conventional PCR assays.
Fecundity assay
C. briggsae isolate-specific fecundities were estimated by
counting the numbers of progeny produced by individual
hermaphrodite worms using standard methods involving

Toluidine dye-stained plates [21]. The fecundity assay was
carried out on standard OP50 Escherichia coli-seeded NGM
agar plates at 20°C. Progeny production was measured for
four independent nematodes per isolate. Prior to testing
for relationships between fecundity and qPCR data using
the Pearson's correlation approach, both data sets were
confirmed to fit a normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for continuous variables.

Nucleotide diversity analysis
Aligned mtDNA protein-coding gene sequences were subjected to nucleotide diversity analyses (πN/πS) using
DnaSP v4.0 [34]. The genetic code in DnaSP was set to
that for flatworm mtDNA which is identical to that for
nematode mtDNA [41]. πN and πS were individually calculated for each of the twelve mtDNA protein-coding genes
in addition to a concatenated data file that contained all
mtDNA protein-coding gene codons – 3,414 total. A C.
elegans concatenated mtDNA file (n = 2,785 codons) was
also analyzed – data derived from a previous study [22]
and two newly-sequenced genomes from strain JU258
(Madeira Islands, Portugal) and PS2025 (Altadena, CA,
USA). Estimates of nucleotide diversity based on theta
and the Jukes-Cantor method of calculating π [34] each
yielded highly similar results to those presented in Figure
5. Additional file 3 reports individual πN and πS values.
