Background
Despite ongoing - and in some regions escalating morbidity and mortality associated with malaria parasites, evolutionary epidemiology of Plasmodium is not
well characterized. Recent studies using molecular
approaches demonstrated that wild and captive gorillas
and captive bonobos and chimpanzees are infected with
P. falciparum and that these apes harbor parasites
broadly related to P. falciparum[1]. Captive chimpanzees
and bonobos had malaria parasites related to human
P. ovale and P. malariae and various monkeys and one
semi-wild chimpanzee had P. vivax[2]. It is not clear
whether these apes harbor naturally these parasites or
whether they are transmitted from humans. Most of the
examined animals had close contact with humans, comparable studies in wild living apes are missing. We provide the first survey of Plasmodium diversity in wild
chimpanzees living in an undisturbed tropical rainforest
in Africa.
Methods
We examined tissue from 16 wild West African chimpanzees that lived in the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast,
where human contact with animals is limited to
researchers who access the territory only during the day.
Samples were collected from animals that died primarily
from anthrax or respiratory disease. Generic real time
PCR assay was used to detect all known Plasmodium
species.
Results
11/16 (68%) animals tested positive. Sequence analyses
of cytB and 18S rRNA genes identified P. malariae,

P. ovale, P. vivax, P. gaboni, P. reichenowi, P. billcollinsi
and P. billbraii.

Discussion
Previous examination of the role of our closest phylogenetic relatives, the great apes, in the evolution and
persistence of human malarias has been limited by a lack
of data from wild ape populations. Interpretation of
patterns of malaria infection in captive ape populations
must consider ample opportunities for human to ape
transmission, negating the opportunity to investigate the
evolutionary origins and public health-related risks of
these parasites. Our examination of malaria parasites in
wild chimpanzees demonstrates that these apes are most
likely naturally infected with Plasmodium species homologous to P. malariae, P. vivax and P. ovale as well as
P. falciparum. Whether wild great apes are the origin of
these malaria types requires further investigation but they
may act as reservoir of infection. These results have
important implications for global efforts underway to eradicate malaria in humans including vaccine development
based on animal variants of human parasites.
