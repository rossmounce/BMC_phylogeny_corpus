Abstract
Background: Microarray technology makes it possible to identify changes in gene expression of
an organism, under various conditions. Data mining is thus essential for deducing significant
biological information such as the identification of new biological mechanisms or putative drug
targets. While many algorithms and software have been developed for analysing gene expression,
the extraction of relevant information from experimental data is still a substantial challenge,
requiring significant time and skill.
Description: MADIBA (MicroArray Data Interface for Biological Annotation) facilitates the
assignment of biological meaning to gene expression clusters by automating the post-processing
stage. A relational database has been designed to store the data from gene to pathway for
Plasmodium, rice and Arabidopsis. Tools within the web interface allow rapid analyses for the
identification of the Gene Ontology terms relevant to each cluster; visualising the metabolic
pathways where the genes are implicated, their genomic localisations, putative common
transcriptional regulatory elements in the upstream sequences, and an analysis specific to the
organism being studied.
Conclusion: MADIBA is an integrated, online tool that will assist researchers in interpreting their
results and understand the meaning of the co-expression of a cluster of genes. Functionality of
MADIBA was validated by analysing a number of gene clusters from several published experiments
– expression profiling of the Plasmodium life cycle, and salt stress treatments of Arabidopsis and rice.
In most of the cases, the same conclusions found by the authors were quickly and easily obtained
after analysing the gene clusters with MADIBA.

Background
A greater understanding of the biological mechanisms
within organisms becomes possible with the availability

of complete genome data, in combination with highthroughput screening methodologies such as microarrays.
In addition, numerous databases provide annotation at

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:105

different biological levels. These include databases on the
annotation of genes according to the Gene Ontology
(GO) nomenclature [1], metabolic pathways as in KEGG
[2], or Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) in
TRANSFAC [3] to annotate promoters.
Generally, gene expression data are normalised, filtered
and finally genes with similar expression profiles are clustered into groups. The biological hypothesis behind this is
that similarly expressed genes have a common biological
characteristic, for example participation in the same biological process, or regulation by a common transcription
factor.
Several currently available tools provide an interpretation
of gene clusters but are often specialised in their analyses.
For example, FatiGO [4], GeneLynx [5] and Gostat [6] are
powerful tools for GO term identification; GoMiner [7],
MAPPFinder [8] and DAVID [9] propose GO and metabolic pathway interpretation; MiCoViTo [10] proposes
metabolic pathways and incorporates transcription regulation visualisation; metaSHARK [11] predicts enzymecoding genes from unannotated genome data and places
them on generic metabolic pathways; and WebGestalt
[12] uses data obtained from different public resources
and offers an integrated platform to perform various analyses such as a GO analysis, metabolic pathways and chromosomal distributions.
To facilitate the analysis of gene expression experiments,
we have developed MADIBA (MicroArray Data Interface
for Biological Annotation), a web based interface with a
relational database that currently provides five analytical
modules to assist researchers in the identification of possible reasons for the common expression of a cluster of
genes. These modules are: (1) a search of over-represented
GO terms in the cluster; (2) mapping of the cluster's gene
products onto metabolic pathways using the KEGG representation; (3) visualisation of the chromosomal localisation; (4) a search of over-represented motifs in the
upstream sequences of the genes and (5) an organism specific analysis.
MADIBA has currently been implemented for Plasmodium
falciparum, Oryza sativa (rice) and Arabidopsis thaliana.
Malaria is a devastating disease, particularly in Africa, so
understanding how its causative agent, Plasmodium, functions is essential. Rice and Arabidopsis are model species
for monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants respectively [13], and plant analyses are useful particularly for
gaining insights into improving crops in both developed
and developing countries, for example orphan crops such
as cassava, cowpea and pearl millet, which are important
for food security in Africa. In addition, Plasmodium is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/105

related to plants as the apicoplast (apicomplexan plastid)
is reminiscent of the chloroplast [14,15].

Construction and content
User interface
MADIBA is accessible through a simple and user friendly
web interface [see Additional file 1]. Once a set of
sequences or gene identifiers has been submitted, the user
is provided with links to the five analysis modules and the
output module. Each analysis module is independent of
the others and is accessed individually. In addition, the
genes that are to be used in subsequent analyses are listed.
Data submission
A cluster of genes is submitted to MADIBA, either by
uploading a file, or directly pasting a set of nucleotide
sequences, in FASTA format. Alternatively, a list of gene
identifiers can be submitted. The gene clusters are
obtained from any clustering algorithm, such as hierarchical or k-means, since MADIBA does not perform any clustering.

For Plasmodium and Arabidopsis sequences, a BLASTN
search is performed, and a BLASTX search of the rice
sequences is performed to allow the possibility of entering
gene clusters from the indica, as well as the japonica, subspecies. In addition, this will potentially allow orthologous gene clusters from other cereals to be analysed, such
as pearl millet. Users select which of the BLAST hits they
wish to continue the analyses with, and this list of genes
is stored.
The gene list is stored for one week on the server, and a
unique identifier is provided to allow users to later access
and retrieve their data. As each analysis module is
accessed, the gene list is used to retrieve the necessary
information required by that module from the database.
Figure 1 illustrates the architecture and basic data flow of
an analysis in MADIBA as described in the next section.
MADIBA modules to analyse gene clusters
Gene Ontology module
This analysis module extracts the GO annotations according to the molecular function, biological process and cellular component ontologies. For a given ontology, a
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is drawn in a single view to
show the genes from the cluster, and the GO terms that
they are annotated to. Each GO term that is found in the
cluster is drawn to show its position in the GO hierarchy,
in a manner similar to AmiGO's graphical representation
[16] and GO::Termfinder [17]. The user is able to select
which genes should be visualised, to prevent overly complex graphs.

A schematic representation of the flow of data through MADIBA
A schematic representation of the flow of data through MADIBA. After a microarray experiment, data are normalised and then clustered, since it is hypothesised that the genes in a cluster have common biological implications. A cluster of
genes is submitted to MADIBA, either as nucleotide sequences, or gene identifiers. This list of genes can then be subjected to
five analysis modules – Gene Ontology Analysis, Metabolic Pathways Analysis, Transcription Regulation Analysis, Chromosomal
Localisation Analysis and an Organism Specific Analysis. Also shown are the data that are required by each of the analysis modules. The results from the analyses can be exported as a PDF file, or as plain text.

An adjusted hypergeometric p-value for each annotation is
also calculated to evaluate the significance of the annotation. The adjustment methods used are a False Discovery
Rate (FDR) adjustment [18], and a Holm adjustment [19],
which works under the same assumptions as a Bonferroni
correction, but is statistically more powerful [20]. Nodes
on the DAG are coloured according to its FDR corrected pvalue, where red indicates p-value ≤ 10-10; orange, 10-10 <pvalue ≤ 10-8; yellow, 10-8 <p-value ≤ 10-6; green, 10-6 <pvalue ≤ 10-4; blue, 10-4 <p-value ≤ 10-2; purple, p-value >
10-2. Other statistical tests will be implemented in the
future to provide greater flexibility to the user in calculating the enrichment of the GO terms. A tab delimited text
file with each gene and the GO terms associated is provided should users wish to perform their own analyses.
Metabolic Pathways module
When this module is accessed, a list of all the KEGG metabolic pathways is presented, along with an indication of
how many enzymes encoded by genes from the input
cluster were found in each pathway. Each pathway in the
list is linked to its diagram where the protein products of
the genes in the cluster are highlighted. This module compares the enzymatic annotation from three different
annotation sources, namely the curated annotation from
the original data source (PlasmoDB, TIGR or TAIR); the
semi-automatic KEGG annotation and the automatic
PRIAM annotation [21]. The use of these diverse and independent annotations increases the robustness of the analysis. Different colours are used to indicate the agreement
between the three annotation methods, where yellow
indicates that the enzyme was annotated by all three
annotation sources; red, by any two annotations; blue, by
KEGG only; purple, by PRIAM only; and green, by the
original annotators only. In addition, any enzyme found
in the genome annotation, but not in the cluster is coloured grey. All elements on the pathways are linked to the
KEGG website to provide more information on the particular enzyme or compound. Clicking on an enzyme that is
present in the cluster also provides information as to
which annotations were used to describe it, and which
genes from the cluster encode it.

A p-value is calculated for each pathway using Fisher's
exact test [22] to indicate the significance of the pathways,
using a 2 × 2 contingency table where the rows indicate
pathway membership and the columns indicate cluster
membership [23].
Chromosomal Localisation
This module permits the identification of co-expressed
genes on the same chromosomal region. It provides a bar
chart showing the distribution of the genes in the cluster
across the chromosomes, that is, the number of genes on
each chromosome. In addition, a schematic visualisation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/105

of the genes along the chromosomes is provided, where
each chromosome is drawn as a horizontal bar, and each
gene is represented by a vertical blue line. The size of the
bar is relative to the size of the chromosomes, and the
genes are drawn in a location with respect to its actual
position on the chromosome. Localisation data was
obtained from the original annotation source (PlasmoDB,
TIGR or TAIR). A mouse-over effect was included to this
diagram to allow easier identification of a gene at a particular position.
Transcription Regulation module
This module presents an approach of motif identification
without any prior knowledge, by automatically detecting
potential Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) in the
promoter sequences of co-regulated genes, using Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT) [24], specifically
using the oligo-analysis and dyad-analysis programs.
Oligo-analysis calculates the occurrence of words (oligonucleotides) in a set of sequences, and determines which
are overrepresented based on a background model. Dyadanalysis detects overrepresented spaced dyads (oligonucleotide pairs which are separated by a variable spacer
region) in a set of sequences. For both analyses, the five
most significant motifs are reported, with the option to
view all results.

The upstream regions are also searched for known TFBS in
the TRANSFAC database (Professional version 11.1) using
the built-in Patch and Match programs [25]. Patch uses
predefined binding site entries and performs a patternbased binding site search, while Match uses positional
weight matrices derived from alignments of binding sites
(i.e. matrix-based search). The ten most common motifs
found by each tool are presented. For each identified
binding site, a link is provided to additional information
in TRANSFAC about the binding factor.
Organism Specific Characteristics module
In the Plasmodium cluster analyses, a component of the
aim for this module is to identify putative new drug targets. Thus, a list of the genes without human homologues,
with their respective annotations is generated. Also, if any
genes similar to the apicoplast are present, its closest
homologue to Arabidopsis is identified. Due to its vegetal
nature, the apicoplast may provide a target for herbicidelike drugs which will not affect the human host [14,15].

For the plant analyses, the closest Arabidopsis orthologue
of each rice gene, and vice versa, is given, in an effort to
identify similar genes. This was accomplished by implementing a reciprocal BLASTP search, with a stringent evalue cut-off of 10-15 to identify highly probable orthologous proteins. In addition, a list of all similar genes, based
on sequence similarity is returned, representing the para-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:105

logues, or protein 'families', for each gene. These results
are determined by performing a self BLAST, and the user
is able to determine the most relevant results by choosing
their own e-value cut-off, minimum percent coverage
(how much of the query matched the subject) and minimum percent identity (how much of the match corresponded).
Output
Results from MADIBA can be exported in either plain text
or PDF formats. The user selects the required set of results
which is then generated for immediate download.
Implementation
The MADIBA interface was written in PHP and PythonCGI, and the graphical outputs are dynamically generated
using the GD library [26]. A central PostgreSQL database
is used to store the downloaded and pre-calculated data.

The downloaded data currently consists of data from the
PlasmoDB [27] database for Plasmodium falciparum
(release 5.2), TIGR [28] for rice (Oryza sativa ssp japonica
cv Nipponbare) (Osa1 database release 5) and TAIR [29] for
Arabidopsis thaliana data (TAIR7). We store the gene name,
functional annotation, GO identifiers, chromosomal
localisations, and the enzymatic annotations (EC identifiers) from the above data sources, as well as the EC numbers proposed by the KEGG Orthology results.
Data pre-calculated by programs before being stored in
the database, include putative metabolic enzyme predictions using PRIAM [21]. These predictions are calculated
based on enzyme profiles from position specific weight
matrices. Also stored are the 1500 nucleotides upstream
of the start codon (ATG) based on previous experimental
research on Plasmodium promoters [30-33], and 1000
nucleotides upstream of the rice and Arabidopsis genes, as
made available by TIGR and TAIR respectively. We also
identify putative orthologues between Plasmodium falciparum and human proteins, and rice and Arabidopsis proteins, by performing a reciprocal BLASTP search, with an
e-value cut-off of 10-15. In addition, for rice and Arabidopsis, a BLASTP of all expressed proteins was performed
against the proteome of the organism in question (a self
BLAST), in order to determine paralogues, or protein 'families', for each gene. The BLAST results with an e-value less
than 10-3 were stored in the database. Sequence information was obtained from the original data source, and
BLASTs were performed using a local version of NCBIBLAST.
The DAGs from the GO analysis are drawn using the dot
program in Graphviz [34], and visualised using the
ZGRViewer applet [35]. All statistical calculations (hypergeometric and Fisher's tests, and multiple hypothesis cor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/105

rections) were computed by the R statistics package [36],
which was accessed using the RPy package [37], a Python
interface to R. The KEGG maps are coloured using the
Python Imaging Library [38], using the co-ordinates provided by KEGG. The chromosomal distribution bar chart
and chromosomal schematic are drawn using the PHP GD
library. Both RSAT and TRANSFAC are accessed using system calls. The PDF output files are created using ReportLab [39].

Utility
Plasmodium data analysis
The results of an oligonucleotide array profiling the
expression of human and mosquito stages of the malaria
parasite's life cycle [40] were chosen to demonstrate the
functionalities of MADIBA. After a robust k-means clustering algorithm, 15 clusters were proposed, and these clusters were analysed with MADIBA.

After applying MADIBA, an improvement in the number
of annotated genes is apparent compared with the original results. The mean fraction of known genes by cluster
was 37.5% compared with 41% when using MADIBA. The
Gene Ontology module automatically allocated annotations to the gene clusters with terms including immune
evasion, in cluster 1, and cell invasion in cluster 15. In
addition, the genes in cluster 2 were correctly identified as
involved in gametogenesis and having over-represented
protein kinase cascade activity. The metabolic pathways
module successfully showed that six of the nine enzymes
in the glycolysis pathway were found in cluster 6, with a pvalue of 0.04, as calculated by using Fisher's exact test (Figure 2). This result is further supported by the indication
that all the enzymes in the pathway were identified by all
three annotation sources, as indicated by the yellow
boxes, and by using the GO analysis, it was shown that the
anaerobic glycolysis term had a highly significant p-value
(Figure 3 and Table 1). Using the module specific for Plasmodium characteristics allowed the identification of genes
in cluster 3 as interesting drug or vaccine targets, such as
PF10_0303, an ookinete surface antigen.
Young et al. [41] performed an analysis on the transcriptome of Plasmodium in an attempt to identify hypothetical genes that are likely to be involved in the sexual
development of the parasite. Using an algorithm called
ontology-based pattern identification (OPI) on the data, a
set of 246 genes were grouped as interesting. Applying
RSAT from the Transcriptional Regulation module on this
data set identified several overrepresented motifs in the
upstream regions of the genes. In particular, oligo-analysis
identified the motif GATGAA, which had an expected
occurrence of 96.6 based on the background model, but
occurred 228 times (E-value for occurrence 10-26). Similarly with dyad analysis, the motif ATCN{7}TCA was

noticeably involved in glycolysis. In the KEGG map for glycolysis, it could be seen that almost all of the enzymes involved are
present in the cluster. Additionally, all of the enzymes were annotated by all the three annotation sources – the curated annotation from the original data source (PlasmoDB); the semi-automatic KEGG annotation and the automatic PRIAM annotation,
as indicated by the yellow boxes.

found to occur 154 times, as opposed to its expected
occurrence of 41.3 (E-value for occurrence 3.5 × 10-32).
Arabidopsis data analysis
MADIBA was used to analyse data from a study of the
response of Arabidopsis to salt stress [42]. The genes were
clustered using a "fuzzy k-means clustering" into 10 major
clusters. After analysing individual clusters with MADIBA,
it was found that the analyses supported the authors' con-

clusions. An example is cluster 0 that had genes responding to osmotic stress in leaves and salt stress in roots, and
meta-analysis with other array data by the authors led
them to conclude that it contained many biotic stress
response genes. Analysis with the Metabolic Pathways
module of MADIBA showed over-representation of several enzymes involved with lignin biosynthesis in cluster
0 (p = 0.001) (Figure 4a), which is indicative of a defence
response. The Gene Ontology analysis showed enrich-

ment of terms in dihydrocamalexic acid decarboxylase
activity, an enzyme responsible for the production of
camalexin, a phytoalexin in Arabidopsis produced in
response to pathogen infection [43]. Other enriched
terms included chitinase activity, ion channel activity, and
terms involved in calcium ion activity including ion binding terms and calmodulin binding. The calcium ion
responsive terms are most likely related to the effect of
salinity on the plant. In the molecular process ontology,
terms included regulation of cellular defence responses,
hypersensitive response, as well as several biotic stress
indicators including responses to ethylene stimulus, jasmonic acid stimulus, salicylic stimulus and abscisic acid
stimulus. These hormones are known to be involved in
plant defences as well as playing roles in salt-stress signalling, again suggesting cross-talk between the various signalling responses. Cluster 8 was annotated as immediate
response genes, and contained members of the WRKY
transcription factor family and disease-resistance protein
genes. Analysis by the oligo-analysis program of RSAT
showed that on the reverse complement, the TTGACT and
TTTGAC motifs were overrepresented in the cluster (E-values 1.1 × 10-7 and 2 × 10-7 respectively), which is similar
to the WRKY binding site ((C/T)TGAC(T/C) [44]) (Figure
4b). In addition, analysis by the TRANSFAC subsection of
the Transcription Regulation module showed that a large
proportion of the genes (110 out of a total of 142 genes in
the cluster) contained a motif (ATTTAC) that is functionally important in the promoter of PR-1a, a well characterised pathogenesis related protein [45] (Figure 4c).
Rice data analysis
For a rice analysis, the results from a cDNA microarray of
cultured rice cells in response to flagellin [46] were used.
Using k-means clustering, 9 clusters were distinguished.
The Gene Ontology analysis detected several genes
involved in wounding and defence responses. Although
the experiment was conducted using the indica subspecies
of rice, the results still show an improvement in the annotation and illustrates the ability of the BLASTX search to
find orthologous genes.

Additionally, a set of stress-induced rice genes from a transcriptome study on cold, drought, salinity and abscisic
acid treatments were tested [47]. While the authors did
not perform a statistical clustering, several sets of genes
were identified as stress induced and grouped together.
After analysing the complete gene set of 73 stress-induced
genes with MADIBA, the Gene Ontology analysis identified terms such as responses to stress, cold acclimation,
iron ion transport and water deprivation, as being significant, confirming the gene set to be stress responsive. Interestingly, several genes in the set were also annotated as
responses to jasmonic- and salicylic-acid, which are usually considered to be signalling molecules in a plant's
defence response. This suggests that there is some crosstalk between biotic and abiotic stress responses.

Discussion
While other tools similar to MADIBA, such as WebGestalt,
FatiGO and GoMiner exist, MADIBA differs in that it has
a wider range of analyses which can be performed in an
integrated fashion, for example, it performs a GO analysis
as well as a Transcription Regulation analysis. Of the previously mentioned tools, MADIBA is most similar to WebGestalt [12], which also obtains information from
different data sources and provides an integrated set of
analysis tools to assist researchers in mining this gene set.
WebGestalt, however, does not provide information on
transcription regulation, and currently only works for
human and mouse data. MADIBA is unique in the organisms it is able to analyse – Plasmodium falciparum, Oryza
sativa (rice) and Arabidopsis thaliana. ClutrFree [48] is a
desktop-based tool that uses a different approach to facilitate interpretation of microarray data. It is a flexible and
generic platform that allows the user to compare different
annotation and analysis approaches to a microarray data
set. Pattern recognition allows visualisation of the relationships in a directed graph (tree) that assists the user in
deriving biological conclusions.
Due to its modular nature, any new analysis can easily be
added to MADIBA at a later stage. In addition, the current

analysis modules are continually being improved to assist
the user in identifying the reasons for the co-expression of
a set of genes. Since it is a web application, this makes
MADIBA platform-independent and can be accessed from
anywhere in the world. Furthermore, the database can be
updated, so that the latest information is available to the
user. MADIBA is highly dependent on the quality of the
genomes' annotations, so as the annotations are
improved, so will the results returned by MADIBA.
Future prospects
All the statistics performed on the data are analysed in
terms of the entire genome. However, since whole
genome microarray slides are not always used, a proposed
improvement is to analyse the data in terms of only the
genes that were on the slide.

discussed above.

Additional material

MADIBA has been designed to be generic and easily
expandable, so that any new organisms that are required
by the community can readily be incorporated into the
database, with only a fully annotated genome necessary.
In addition, as the genome annotations are revised, it is
important to update the data within MADIBA, and this
will be done in a semi-automated manner using pre-built
Python scripts.
With the increased number of statistical methods being
adopted, we aim to widen the variety of statistical analyses
available, such as by including GSEA [49] (through R) or
rank tests, to provide a greater level of flexibility for the
user.
In the Organism Specific module, orthology was inferred
using reciprocal best BLAST hit. We recognise that this is
not the most accurate or reliable method for determining
orthology, so we are working to implement tools such as
Ortholuge [50] and GreenPhyl [51], which take into
account phylogenetic information in addition to
sequence similarity.

Conclusion
With the advent of whole genome microarray chips and
an increasing number of organisms being sequenced,
tools such as MADIBA will become even more significant
in understanding the underlying biology. MADIBA provides access to several genomic data sources and analyses,
allowing users to quickly annotate and visualise the
results. Moreover, this tool can contribute information
about Plasmodium as gene regulation in this parasite is
poorly understood [52].
