Abstract
Background: Alternative splicing has been reported in various eukaryotic groups including plants,
apicomplexans, diatoms, amoebae, animals and fungi. However, whether widespread alternative
splicing has evolved independently in the different eukaryotic groups or was inherited from their
last common ancestor, and may therefore predate multicellularity, is still unknown. To better
understand the origin and evolution of alternative splicing and its usage in diverse organisms, we
studied alternative splicing in 12 eukaryotic species, comparing rates of alternative splicing across
genes of different functional classes, cellular locations, intron/exon structures and evolutionary
origins.
Results: For each species, we find that genes from most functional categories are alternatively
spliced. Ancient genes (shared between animals, fungi and plants) show high levels of alternative
splicing. Genes with products expressed in the nucleus or plasma membrane are generally more
alternatively spliced while those expressed in extracellular location show less alternative splicing.
We find a clear correspondence between incidence of alternative splicing and intron number per
gene both within and between genomes. In general, we find several similarities in patterns of
alternative splicing across these diverse eukaryotes.
Conclusion: Along with previous studies indicating intron-rich genes with weak intron boundary
consensus and complex spliceosomes in ancestral organisms, our results suggest that at least a
simple form of alternative splicing may already have been present in the unicellular ancestor of
plants, fungi and animals. A role for alternative splicing in the evolution of multicellularity then
would largely have arisen by co-opting the preexisting process.

Background
Alternative splicing (AS) of transcripts is common in
diverse eukaryotic lineages. By this mechanism, a variety
of transcripts and proteins are produced from a single

gene, contributing to increased transcriptome and proteome diversity. AS has been reported in a wide range of
eukaryotic groups including plants, apicomplexans, diatoms, amoebae, animals and fungi [1-5]. However, it is

unclear and hard to assess whether this process has arisen
independently in the different lineages (as suggested by
some authors, e.g. [6]) or whether it was already present
in their last common ancestor. The spliceosome, the
machinery responsible for the splicing of introns in
eukaryotic genes, is ancestral to all extant eukaryotic
groups with the last common ancestor possessing a complex machinery, similar to that found in most modern
organisms [7]. In addition, we recently argued that
eukaryotic ancestors had weak 5' splice site boundary consensus sequences [8], a characteristic that is linked to the
presence of AS in modern organisms [6]. These ancestral
traits thus allow for the possibility that AS arose early in
eukaryotic evolution.

and functionality. Our major findings include: (i) ancient
genes (conserved in both plants and animals/fungi) are
equally likely to have known AS as 'newer' genes; (ii)
ancient functions are carried by genes that show relatively
high levels of AS; (iii) genes found across all lineages (suggesting that they are essential for eukaryotic life) are no
more likely to show AS than are genes that have been lost
in one or more lineages; and (iv) there is a strong relationship between intron number and the existence of known
AS across genes. We interpret our results to support the
notion that a potentially widespread AS may have been
present at least as early as the unicellular ancestor of animals, fungi and plants.

Results
How can we begin to address this issue? If AS arose independently in different lineages, we might expect that different classes of genes would show varying levels of AS in
separate lineages, reflecting differential evolutionary histories. In particular, genes with regulatory functions, such
as transcription factors [9,10] or signal transducers [11],
exhibit high levels of alternative splicing in mammals,
consistent with a central role for AS in generating the complexity of mammalian ontology [9], while basic enzymatic functions show less splice variation [9]. By the same
reasoning, if AS arose along with the rise of organismal
complexity in different multicellular lineages, genes central to this complexity would likely have high AS frequencies, while conserved ancient eukaryotic gene functions
might have lower AS frequencies.
Notably, the finding of significant AS in the intron-rich
pathogenic unicellular fungus Cryptococcus neoformans [3]
demonstrates that widespread AS is not restricted to multicellular or highly-differentiated organisms. Indeed, from
an evolutionary viewpoint, it is not likely that AS would
evolve "in order for" multicellularity to develop; rather, it
is possible that AS already existed (in at least a simple
form) and was then later co-opted for multicellular development.
Intron/exon structure may be an important determinant
for evolution of AS. Genes with more introns have more
opportunities for AS. This would be consistent with vertebrates' higher intron numbers and AS frequencies [12].
However, recent results have shown that vertebrate intron
number is not particularly high by historical metazoan
standards [13-17], and that early eukaryotic ancestors
likely harbored relatively high intron numbers [15,1822].
We studied patterns of AS in 12 well-annotated genomes
from plants, fungi and animals. We compared frequencies
of AS of genes of different classes according to their gene
structure, evolutionary origins, phylogenetic distribution

Intron/exon structure and AS frequency
We found a clear positive relationship between average
intron number per gene and occurrence of AS across 12
animal, fungus, and plant species (Figure 1A). This relationship is also seen across genes within each of the eight
species with significant frequencies of AS: higher intron
number is associated with higher AS levels within each
genome (Figure 1B). In particular, there is a steady
increase in incidence of AS among genes with up to 6–10
introns. Given estimates of high intron densities in the
plant animal ancestor (at least as high as modern
Caenorhabditis species [15,18,23]), this finding is consistent with frequent ancestral AS.
Age of alternatively spliced genes
The KOG database [24] includes groups of orthologous
genes for seven animal, fungus, and plant species. For
each of the four species with significant AS levels in the
KOG database (H. sapiens, C. elegans, D. melanogaster and
A. thaliana) we divided gene families into four groups: 1)
common (and thus presumably ancestral) to plants, animals, and fungi (PAF); 2) common to fungi and animals
(AF); 3) specific to animals (A); 4) specific to a single lineage (LSE) (Figure 2A).

Figure 2B shows the percentage of genes in each group
with known alternative splicing for each species. AS was
found in all groups. LSE genes showed the lowest frequency of AS in each species (significantly lower than the
whole set of genes in fly, worm and Arabidopsis, p < 0.0001
by Fisher exact tests), and AF and A genes showing the
highest frequency. Interestingly, the most ancient group
(PAF) showed relatively high levels of AS (significantly
higher than the whole set of genes in worms and Arabidopsis, p < 0.0001 by Fisher exact test, and not significantly
different to this set in humans and flies), indicating no
constraints against evolution of AS in ancient eukaryotic
genes. In particular, we identified 36 KOGs whose genes
are highly alternatively spliced in all four species, which
could reflect that these gene functions have been alterna-

ure of a gene's likelihood to be lost in evolution [25]) and
AS in any species (data not shown).
Thus, genes encoding basic and highly conserved cellular
functions are no less likely to be alternatively spliced than
are other genes (for instance those involved in multicellularity or other complex functions).

Functional profiling of alternatively spliced genes thus
shows that most genes encoding most cellular functions
exhibit AS. Some functions seem to be especially amenable to AS, perhaps due to these gene functions being particularly improved by the production of multiple
products. AS is particularly prevalent in genes associated
with regulation and signaling, consistent with previous
observations [9,11]. Interestingly, the overrepresentation
of AS in genes with regulatory functions previously
observed in mammals is observed across lineages.

least one of the animal or fungal species included in KOG
database. Indispensable genes (grey): KOG's present in the
seven studied species.

Cellular location of alternatively spliced genes
The level of AS by cellular location for 6 eukaryotes is
shown in Figure 4 and in detail in Additional file 2. Genes
for proteins in most cellular locations showed AS. In particular, we were interested in the level of AS of genes
encoding extracellular proteins, since many of these genes
are likely to be important in the intercellular structures
and communication vital to multicellularity (consistent
with this notion, genes encoding extracellular products
are much less frequent in the unicellular fungus C. neoformans (4/4578, 0.09%) than in the multicellular species
(ranging from 0.32–3.19% across species)). Such extracellular-associated genes did not show elevated AS rates.
Instead, genes encoding proteins located in the nucleus
and plasma membrane generally have higher proportions
of AS.
Functional profile of alternatively spliced genes
AS levels across species for molecular function (F) and
biological process (P) GO categories are shown in Figures
5 and 6, respectively, and in detail in Additional files 3
and 4, respectively. Again, gene categories generally associated with multicellularity (development, sensoryrelated functions) did not show elevated AS rates. Among
molecular functions, protein kinase activity, RNA binding
and calcium ion binding generally had high AS frequencies while monooxygenase activity, receptor activity,
transporter activity and heme binding had much lower AS
across all species. Biological processes showed greater variation across species

Discussion
Patterns of genome-wide AS usage are similar in different
eukaryotic lineages
We studied patterns of genome-wide AS in 12 eukaryotic
genomes. Our major findings include:

1) a correspondence between intron number and frequency of known AS, both within and between species;
2) evidence that ancient genes show relatively high levels
of known AS.
3) no evidence for elevated AS in recently evolved genes –
in fact, the most recently evolved genes are less likely to
have known AS;
4) no clear evidence for elevated AS in classes of genes
thought to be important in the rise of multicellularity;
5) a variety of similarities in the patterns of AS across
diverse species, which could reflect patterns inherited
from a putative AS-rich plant-animal ancestor.
Alternatively spliced genes in animals, plants and fungi
have several common features. In all studied species, AS is
widely found across genes with different functions,
although those associated with regulation (i.e. protein
kinase activity or RNA binding) show consistently higher
AS levels. Also, the species studied showed similar patterns of AS usage in genes of different evolutionary age.
Finally, intron number per gene was related with AS frequency in a similar manner in all species.
The simplest hypothesis to explain these similarities is
that AS is homologous in these groups, inherited from
their common ancestor, and that AS patterns in the common ancestor might have been similar. However, caution
is necessary in interpreting this result. Given the high rates
of gains and losses of AS events, the alternative hypothesis
of convergent evolution of AS patterns in the different lineages, although less parsimonious, cannot be excluded.

Ancient genes and functions show relatively high levels of
AS
Also consistent with a relatively early origin of AS is our
finding that recently evolved gene families (LSE) showed
the lowest frequency of AS in all species (Figure 2B). Many
of these genes are likely associated with newly evolved
and complex lineage-specific traits in plants and animals.
On the other hand, ancient gene families (PAF), which
were already present in the ancestor, are highly alternatively spliced in modern organisms (Figure 2B) and a wide
range of fundamental ancient functions are currently performed in eukaryotic cells by alternatively spliced genes
(Figures 5 and 6), indicating no constraints for ancient
genes to be alternatively spliced. Finally, gene functions
that show consistently higher (e.g. RNA binding and protein kinase activity) or lower (e.g. mono-oxygenase activity) levels of AS across eukaryotes could have also had
similar relative levels in the common ancestor.
Alternatively splicing and proteomic networks
We found no clear relationship between incidence of AS
and gene dispensability (Figure 3). Indispensable genes
tend to have large numbers of interaction partners, occu-

pying central positions in proteomic networks, while dispensable genes usually occupy external positions in the
interacting networks [25]. These results thus suggest that
AS may be integrated across all levels of eukaryotic proteomic networks.
Intron-rich gene structures is the main requirement for AS
We show that intron/exon number correlates strongly
with the frequency of AS within and between genomes
(Figure 1). In accordance, most intron-reduced genomes,
such as those of most microsporidia and ascomycetes,
show no AS [6] and other relatively reduced genomes,
such as amoebas [26] or apicomplexans [27] do not
exhibit high frequencies of AS. Interestingly, LSE genes,
found to have significantly lower levels of AS, show lower
average intron numbers than the other groups.

Our and others' previous work has shown that the plantanimal ancestor was at least moderately intron-rich (with
at least as many introns as modern Caenorhabditis species), and that lower modern densities in some lineages
reflect widespread intron loss [15,19,21,23,28-30]. Taken
with present results, there are two important potential

implications. First, retention of ancestral intron densities
was likely an important condition for modern AS. Thus, if
in fact AS played an important role in the emergence of
organismal complexity [31,32], differential retention of
ancestral introns would have profound consequences for
morphological evolution across lineages.
Second, intron-rich ancestors are likely to have had significant AS. All thoroughly studied intron-rich genomes
show relatively high frequencies of AS, suggesting both
that a complex gene structure favors AS and that AS could
have an important role in most non-reduced genomes,
with high numbers of introns per gene. As we mention
above, this is especially interesting in light of accumulating evidence that the last common ancestor of plants and
opisthokonts was at least moderately intron rich [15,1822] (with an estimated intron density between ~3.5 [18]
and ~7.0 [15] introns per gene) and that it had weak consensus 5' splice site boundaries [8]. Among modern
eukaryotes, both high intron number and weak 5'ss are
characteristic of diverse species with widespread alternative splicing [8]. Therefore, these studies together strongly
suggest the presence of AS in plant-animal ancestor
Intron numbers, spliceosomal errors, functionality and
origin of AS
It is important to note that our present results do not
address the functionality of alternative splice variants
(and thus of AS) either in early eukaryotes or in modern
organisms, a topic currently under debate [33,34]. Alternative transcripts produced from the same gene might: (i)
encode different functions, (ii) reflect nonfunctional (but
common) variants or (iii) represent rare spliceosomal
errors, which will all appear in EST databases and thus in
EST-based AS annotations. It seems likely that all three
cases contribute to modern transcriptome variability. If in
fact our argument is correct (that early eukaryotes already
utilized extensive AS), it would be interesting to know
how levels of AS functionality have changed through
time. Increased requirements on proteome and regulatory
flexibility could have driven an increase in functional AS.
In tandem, refinements in the spliceosomal machinery
could have increased splicing fidelity through eukaryotic
evolution, disproportionately decreasing nonfunctional
AS variants.

Interestingly, the evolutionary origin of functional AS is
likely related to mis-splicing (splicing errors). AS might
have evolved from mis-splicing as the early eukaryotic
cells evolved to use and benefit from multiple splicing
outputs. Therefore, the widespread production of multiple splice forms could be a main requirement for the origin of functional AS. Thus, our results along with the
likely existence of weak splice sites in early eukaryotes [8]
do not prove that early eukaryotes had functional AS, but

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/188

they strongly suggest that the last plant-animal ancestor
had at least such additional splice variants available for
potential participation and recruitment in biological
processes.
AS in unicellular organisms and the origin of
multicellularity
A striking potential implication of our results is that AS
already existed in the plant-animal ancestor, a rather
ancient and "primitive" unicellular eukaryote. As seen in
some modern unicellular organisms (e.g. Cryptococcus),
AS could have played an extensive role in the biology and
evolution of these ancestral unicellular eukaryotes.

In this case, AS would have predated multicellularity and
could perhaps have been recruited to allow the rise of
multicellular complexity. This would resemble other biological processes, like apoptosis, whose origin precedes
the rise of multicellular organisms, although the cooption of this ability was crucial for the advent of multicellularity [35].
Reliability of AS databases to answer evolutionary
questions
Though we restricted our analysis to well-annotated
genomes from long- and deeply-studied species with wide
cDNA/EST coverage [36], it is likely that many alternative
transcripts are not represented in current annotations,
introducing the possibility of sampling biases. For
instance, some gene types have been more thoroughly
studied, and therefore may show higher proportions of
annotated AS. However, such differences are unlikely to
explain our central conclusions, since they are largely
based on shared similarities, not differences (similar incidence of alternative splicing in old and new genes, dispensable and indispensable genes, genes of different
functional classes), and clear associations across large
numbers of genes. Indeed, EST coverage in C. elegans does
not correlate with fractions of predicted alternatively
spliced genes across different GO categories or gene ages,
suggesting that the observed patterns are not due to EST
sampling (Additional file 5).

Another potential problem associated with EST based
annotation is the source of these data, especially in the
case of humans. Many human EST libraries derive from
cancerous or abnormal cell lineages, thought to contain
aberrant, disease related alternative splice variants [37]. If
these variants are more frequent among some groups of
genes, this could introduce a bias in our results. However,
our results for functional ontologies are based on data
from a variety of species and the patterns presented here
are consistent among all the species despite this potential
source of noise in human databases.

We used genome annotation databases for this analysis
because they are constructed using very similar
approaches and so they might be more suitable for comparing these species. Supporting the quality of the studies
databases, we found in the thorough analysis of the C. elegans Wormbase dataset that the vast majority of alternatively spliced isoforms included are well supported by
experimental evidence, and only very few cases represent
annotation mistakes.
Finally, it should be noted that the current results concern
only presence/absence of AS, rather than number of alternative transcripts. Since alternatively spliced genes may
produce from 2 to hundreds of isoforms, the effects on the
transcriptome output will be quite different across genes,
and further studies should address this important issue.
Instead, we have concentrated on known AS presence/
absence in a gene, which is likely to be less sensitive to differences in EST sampling. Similarly, different positions of
the AS events in each gene may produce very different outputs with different effects on the organism's fitness. Our
analysis does not take differences in function between
splice variants into account. However, these considerations are unlikely to affect our conclusions about AS in
early eukaryotes.
To verify our hypotheses on the emergence of AS, further
studies of conservation of AS mechanisms (i.e. use of
splicing regulators), splicing boundaries, and expression
patterns will be necessary. Characterization of levels and
patterns of AS in diverse additional eukaryotes, particularly unicellular intron-rich species, will also be important. Species of apicomplexans [4] and diatoms [5] have
already been shown to have AS. EST and genome sequencing projects will provide data to assess whether AS was an
ancestral feature of eukaryotic organisms, playing another
important role in the complex RNA processing of early
eukaryotes [7,38].

Conclusion
We find similar patterns of genome-wide AS usage in different eukaryotic lineages. We show that ancient genes
and functions (present in the common ancestor of plants
and opisthokonts) have high levels of AS in modern
organisms indicating no bias against AS of these genes.
These genes were also likely intron-rich in the common
ancestor [15,18-22], which we find to be the main
requirement for AS. Since the spliceosomal machinery is
widely conserved throughout eukaryotes [7,38], our
results favor the hypothesis that some form of AS
appeared relatively early in eukaryotic evolution, at least
in the unicellular common ancestor of plants, animals
and fungi (around 1300 million years ago [39,40], quite
early in the evolution of extant eukaryotes [41]). This
implies AS appeared before the rise of multicellular organ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/188

isms, and could therefore have an important role in the
biology of ancient unicellular organisms.

(AL391737.1, AL590442-50.1); one plant: Arabidopsis
thaliana (NC_003070.5, NC_003071.3, NC_003074.4,
NC_003075.3, NC_003076.4, based on TAIR genome
annotations); and one apicomplexan: Plasmodium falciparum HB3 (AANS00000000.1).
Quality of the databases
For many species, there are currently various genomic
databases available having information on AS. In each
such case, we used the richest and most up-to-date database, containing the largest number of described alternatively spliced isoforms. Each of the databases was
constructed by automatic predictions of gene structures,
generally combining different software, and then confirmed by mapping ESTs and cDNAs onto genomic
sequences and usually manually curated. Described alternatively spliced isoforms are based on alignments of ESTs
and cDNAs onto these gene models. For each genome,
some subsets of genes are manually annotated and thoroughly studied. Detailed explanations of the methods
using in deriving these databases are available from the
primary references [3,44-46] and from the Ensembl, TAIR
and NCBI web pages.

To better understand these genome annotations we further explored one of them, the Wormbase annotation of
C. elegans. We studied each gene that was annotated to be
alternatively spliced. We found that 97.8% of the isoforms
had one or more kinds of experimental support (RNA,
ORF sequence tags (OSTs) and/or ESTs), described as
"confirmed by cDNA(s)" or "partially confirmed by
cDNA(s)", thus only ~2.2% of isoforms are predictions. In
addition, for each case we aligned the different isoforms
against the genomic sequence. In only 2.4% of cases, we
found that slight errors, generally one or two base indels,
were responsible for the annotation of alternative splicing.

To test the effects of sampling biases we analyzed the coverage of ESTs per Kb for each gene and for each category
of gene. For each gene we counted the number of matching ESTs per gene available in Wormbase and divided it by
the length of the longest transcript. Importantly, no correlation was found between EST coverage and percentage of
genes that were alternatively spliced for any of the GO
classifications (cellular location, molecular function, or
biological process), or for age of gene (Additional file 4).
Evolutionary analyses
For evolutionary analyses we used the Eukaryotic Clusters
of Orthologous Groups (KOGs), which includes putative
ortholog sets for seven species: Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana,
Saccharomyces cerevisae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and
Encephalitozoon cuniculi. This database is suitable for the
study of protein functions from an evolutionary perspective, addressing issues such as origin of gene functions or
their dispensability during eukaryotic evolution [47].
Data were downloaded from the corresponding NCBI
webpage [48] and linked to current genome annotation
databases. Data was carefully filtered for repetitions
resulting from database linking and from the updating of
annotations of the genes included in the KOG database.
Gene Ontology analyses
Gene Ontology annotations for cellular location (C),
molecular function (F) and biological process (P) for
genes from H. sapiens, M. musculus, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, C. neoformans and A. thaliana were obtained from
Gene Ontology Consortium website [49]. This database
was linked to Ensembl or NCBI gene ID's, using UniProt
ID's [50], if necessary. Data was carefully filtered to avoid
redundancies due to database linking. We analyzed in H.
sapiens a total of 18589 entries in 458 C-GO categories,
36653 entries in 2063 F-GO categories and 29162 in 1867
P-GO categories; in M. musculus, 19002 entries in 450 CGO categories, 33461 entries in 1898 F-GO categories and
24793 in 2119 P-GO categories; in D. melanogaster, 5811
entries in 411 C-GO categories, 11916 in 1571 F-GO categories and 20307 in 1657 P-GO categories; in C. elegans,
7151 entries in 174 C-GO categories, 21627 in 837 F-GO
categories and 9579 in 562 P-GO categories; in C. neoformans 4578 entries in 279 C-GO categories, 3298 in 969 FGO categories and 5564 in 884 P-GO categories; in A.
thaliana, 26592 entries in 281 C-GO categories, 34959 in
1255 F-GO categories and 27845 in 1210 P-GO categories.
Statistical analysis
Percentages of alternatively spliced genes were calculated
for each category under study. The correspondent 95%
confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each percent-

, where

a is the fraction of alternatively spliced genes in a given
group and N the total number of genes in that group.
age using the standard formula: a ± 1.96

To assess statistical under/overrepresentation of AS in
each studied category, we used Fisher exact tests (assuming the one-sided probability for similarity of samples).
For each of the three blocks of GO terms presented in Figures 4, 5 and 6 (cellular location, molecular function and
biologcial process, respectively), we corrected for multiple
testing using full Bonferroni correction.
In the Additional files 2, 3 and 4, we excluded groups of
genes that contained less than 35 genes.
Analysis of alternative isoforms
Gene, intron and exon information was extracted from
their annotation using a PERL script "Intron_finder.pl" as
previously described [36]. For each gene, custom PERL
scripts assessed intron number and alternative splicing
(i.e. the position or length of any alignable intron or internal exon is different in at least two different isoforms). AS
events in P. falciparum were extracted from [51].
