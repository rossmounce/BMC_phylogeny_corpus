Abstract
Background: Viral envelope proteins have been proposed to play significant roles in the process of viral infection.
Results: In this study, an envelope protein gene, gC (NCBI GenBank accession no. EU076811), was expressed and
characterized from duck plague virus (DPV), a member of the family herpesviridae. The gene encodes a protein of
432 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 45 kDa. Sequence comparisons, multiple alignments and
phylogenetic analysis showed that DPV gC has several features common to other identified herpesvirus gC, and
was genetically close to the gallid herpervirus.
Antibodies raised in rabbits against the pET32a-gC recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)
recognized a 45-KDa DPV-specific protein from infected duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells. Transcriptional and
expression analysis, using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) and Western blot detection, revealed that
the transcripts encoding DPV gC and the protein itself appeared late during infection of DEF cells. Immunofluorescence localization further demonstrated that the gC protein exhibited substantial cytoplasm fluorescence in DPVinfected DEF cells.
Conclusions: In this work, the DPV gC protein was successfully expressed in a prokaryotic expression system, and
we presented the basic properties of the DPV gC product for the first time. These properties of the gC protein
provided a prerequisite for further functional analysis of this gene.

Background
Duck plague virus (DPV), or duck enteritis virus (DEV),
is an important pathogen of ducks, which has caused
serious losses in commercial duck production in domestic and wild waterfowl as a result of mortality, condemnations, and decreased egg production[1]. DPV is
classified as the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae of the
family herpesviridae based on the report of the Eighth
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV), but has not been grouped into any genus[2].
The genome of DPV is composed of a linear, doublestranded DNA, with 64.3% G+C content which is higher
than any other reported avian herpesvirus in the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae[3]. To date, more and more
DPV genes have been identified, such as UL24[4-6],

UL31[7,8], UL35[9,10], UL51[11,12], dUTPase[13], and
gE[14] gene. However, the key genes and their functions
remain to be elucidated, especially the viral envelope
protein genes. Viral envelope proteins are particularly
important because of their role in the virus-host relationship, including recognition, attachment and penetration of the virus into susceptible cells. In 2006, the DPV
genomic library was successfully constructed in our
laboratory, and one envelope protein gene, gC (NCBI
GenBank accession no. EU076811) was characterized
[15-18], but the basic properties and biological functions
of this envelope protein are not known.
gC is a major component of the virion envelope and is
proved to be a multifunctional protein. gC homologues
of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), pseudorabies
virus (PRV), and bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), is
the primary attachment protein, interacting with cell
surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), thus
mediating efficient virus attachment to the cells[19-24].

[25-28] is also a major determinant for virulence. In
case of Marek’s disease virus (MDV), gC is required for
horizontal transmission, together with US2, UL13 in
combination[29]. Furthermore, gC has been demonstrated to be a critical immune evasion molecule, and
the two glycoproteins, gC and gE, have a synergistic
effect on mediating immune evasion[30,31]. And gC of
HSV-1 and -2, BHV-1, PRV, and Equine herpes virus
types 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and -4) has been reported to bind
complement component C3[32-34], thus modulating
complement activation. Although nonessential for virus
infectivity of cultured cells, gC is a highly antigenic glycoprotein, of which the importance in eliciting immune
responses has been well documented for many herpesviruses[35-39]. However, whether the product of DPV
gC gene shares these functions remains to be
determined.
To begin addressing questions regarding gC properties
or functions, we cloned and expressed the gC gene from
DPV in the prokaryotic expression system, raised antiserum that recognizes the gC protein and revealed its
temporal transcription course and subcellular localization in DPV-infected DEF cells. This work might provide a foundation for further studies on the function of
DPV gC.

Transcriptional analysis of DPV gC gene

FQ-PCRs were used to detect the expression of the DPV gC
gene during viral infection. Total RNA was isolated from
mock-or DPV-infected cells at indicated times, and then
cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase. Aliquots
of cDNA at each time point were used as template for realtime PCR reactions containing primers either for gC gene
or for b-actin. Table 1 presents data from experiments
where the target (gC) and reference (b-actin) were amplified
in separate wells. The 2-ΔΔCt method was used to calculate
relative changes in the gene expression determined from
quantitative real-time PCR experiments. As shown in Figure
5 the level of gC mRNA had been increasing since 4 hpi,
peaked between 28 and 36 hpi, and then declined.
Time course expression of DPV gC protein

In this experiment, DEF cells were mock infected or
infected with DPV, and at 4, 16, 32, 48, 60, 72 hpi, cell
suspensions were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer.
Equal amounts of cell lysates were resolved by SDSPAGE, and proteins on the gel were electrophoretically
transferred to PVDF membrane and subjected to Western blot analysis with rabbit anti-DPV gC serum. The
result, shown in Figure 6 revealed that a 45 kDa protein
was readily detected as early as 4 hpi and seemed to be
present at increased levels at 48 hpi.

Results
Cloning, prokaryotic expression and antigenicity analysis
of the recombinant protein

DPV gC gene from the genomic DNA was amplified
and cloned into a T/A cloning vector pMD18-T, generating a recombinant cloning plasmid pMD18-T/gC
(Figure 1). The recombinant plasmid was confirmed by
DNA sequencing, PCR and restriction digestion (Figure
2a). The gC gene fragment, which was obtained by
digestion of pMD18-T/gC with EcoRI and XhoI, was
ligated into the fusion expression vector pET32a(+)
(Figure 3) and identified by PCR and restriction digestion (Figure 2b). After confirmation, a positive clone
was submitted to DNA sequencing and the result confirmed that the gC gene was in frame with the N-terminal His6 tag within the pET32a(+) multiple cloning
sites (data not shown). Then this recombinant plasmid,
pET32a-gC, was transformed into Escherichia coli
BL21 (DE3) which, following induction with IPTG,
expressed large quantities of the pET32a-gC recombinant protein (Figure 4a), and this recombinant protein
was purified by gel and electric elution (Figure 4b). In
order to examine the reactivity and specificity of the
recombinant fusion protein, Western blot analysis was
carried out. As shown in Figure 4b, the anti-DPV
serum specifically recognized a 65 kDa band, which
corresponded to the theoretical molecular mass of
pET32a-gC.

Subcellular localization

The subcellular localization of gC protein was examined
by indirect immunofluorescence staining. At various
times after infection, DEF cells infected with DPV were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) to block nonspecific binding and
reacted with the DPV gC antiserum. Specific fluorescence became detectable only in the cytoplasm of
infected cells as early as 4 hpi. At later times of infection, the protein converged at the perinuclear region of
the cytoplasm. And after 60 hr, fluorescence was gently
dispersed (Figure 7).

Discussion
In this study we expand our initial observations, in
which we identified and characterized the DPV gC gene
and found that it has homologues in some herpesviruses
sequenced to date. Analysis of the predicted 432 amino
acid DPV gC protein indicates that it has several features common to other herpesvirus glycoproteins. There
is a hydrophobic sequence of about 22 amino acids at
the amino terminus that corresponds to a signal peptide
and a 23-amino-acid hydrophobic sequence near the
carboxy terminus that is predicted to span the membrane of the virus envelope. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that DPV gC gene displayed similarities
of 29.9%, 29.5%, 31.7% to this gene from MeHV-1,

MDV1, MDV2, respectively. Further detailed analysis
showed that it possessed a Marek’s disease glycoprotein
A conserved structural domain between the residues
170 and 425, indicating that the DPV gC and its counterpart in MDV may have similar functions.

As a first step toward the study of the gC protein, rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific to this protein were
raised using an Escherichia coli BL21-produced recombinant gC fusion protein as antigen. For this purpose
the plasmid pET32a-gC was constructed. When

expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, this plasmid
expresses the gC gene fragment along with a His6 tag
attached to the N terminus. High levels of the resulting
65 kDa fusion protein were expressed in Escherichia coli
BL21 following induction by IPTG. The induced fusion
protein was purified as described in Methods.
To examine the reactivity and specificity of DPV gC
protein, Western blot experiments were performed. The
result showed that the fusion pET32a-gC protein was
recognized by the rabbit anti-DPV IgG, indicating that
the protein had good immunogenicity. Then the fusion
pET32a-gC protein was used as antigen to produce the
rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for gC. The fusion
pET32a-gC protein was recognized with the pET32a-gC
antiserum by Western blot and the antiserum specifically reacted with a protein of approximately 45 kDa
protein in DPV-infected DEF cells. These results indicated that the antiserum had a high level of reactivity
and specificity. Therefore, we used this polyclonal antiserum for further experiments to characterize the gC
protein of DPV.
During a productive infection of cultured cells, genes
of herpesvirus have been found to be expressed in a
temporally regulated cascade, in which immediate-early
(IE) genes are expressed first, followed by early (E)
genes and finally by late (L) genes[40]. Late genes are
subdivided into two categories as leaky-late (g 1 ) or
strict-late (g 2 ). The g 1 genes can be suboptimally
expressed in the absence of viral DNA synthesis,
whereas the g2, have a strict requirement for viral DNA
synthesis. gC gene of many herpesviruses has been

identified as a g2 gene, which is highly dependent upon
the IE protein ICP27 during viral infection[41-47]. In
HeLa cells infected with HSV-1 (5 PFU/cell), the transcript for the g2 gC was present from 2 to 8 hpi and the
relative increase in gC transcript was detected by 8-h
RNA hybridization[48]. Levine M[49] reported that gC
protein was expressed at high levels within a single HSV
replication cycle of about 10 to 14 h. From our data, the
level of DPV gC mRNA had been increasing since 4 hpi,
with maximal amounts between 28 and 36 hpi and the
maximum gC expression was achieved by 48 hpi. These
results demonstrated that the expression of this gene
occurred at the late stage of infection, which was to
some extent consistent with the results from the previous observations. In this report, DPV gC mRNA and
protein peak levels were detected much later compared
to HSV-1 gC gene, probably because of the difference in
the cell type and the dose of infection.
Currently, little is known about the subcellular localization of the herpesviruses gC. To assemble clues to the
function of the gene product, we investigated the subcellular localization of DPV gC in infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence experiments. The presented
results showed that cytoplasm fluorescence first
appeared in DPV-infected cells at 4 hpi. At later times
of infection, the specific fluorescence was localized predominantly intracellularly in a perinuclear region which
probably corresponds to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus of the infected cells, in
which viral glycoproteins were synthesized and/or
modificated.

Conclusions
In this work, we characterized the gC gene of DPV,
including the prokaryotic expression, antibody preparation, gene temporal transcription/translation course and
subcellular localization. We found that the expression of

this gene appeared at the late stage of viral infection
and the gC protein showed a pronounced cytoplasmic
staining in infected cells. These properties of the gC
protein provide a foundation for further functional analysis of this gene.

Methods
Cells and virus

Duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF) were cultured at 37°C
with 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan,
Utah, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin.
DPV CH virulent strain was obtained from the Avian
Disease Research Center of Sichuan Agricultural University. For infection, DPV of 2.2 × 10 7 TCID50/ml was
employed.

After DPV inoculation, the DEF were incubated in
MEM containing 3% FBS. Usually, the maximum virus
titers could be obtained 72 h postinfection (hpi) when
the cytopathic effect (CPE) was over 75%.
PCR amplification and plasmid construction

A pair of primers (5’-CGGAATTCCAAAACGCCGCACAGATGAC-3’ and 5’-CCCTCGAGGTATTCAAATAATATTGTCTGC-3’) was designed and used to
amplify DPV gC gene from the genomic DNA. The
amplified PCR product was cloned into a T/A cloning

cloning plasmid pMD18-T/gC (Figure 1). After verified
by PCR, restriction analysis and DNA sequencing
(TaKaRa), the gC gene fragment, which was obtained by
digestion of pMD18-T/gC with EcoRI and XhoI, was
ligated into prokaryotic vector pET32a(+) (Novagen)
(Figure 3), which was digested previously with the same
restriction enzymes. The recombinant plasmid, named
pET32a-gC, was confirmed by PCR, restriction enzyme
digestion and DNA sequencing (TaKaRa).
Prokaryotic expression, protein purification and antibody
preparation

pET32a-gC was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21
(DE3) and the bacteria were induced for 4 h with 0.6
mM IPTG at 37°C to express the fusion protein. The
fusion protein was purified from inclusion bodies by gel
and electric elution. To test the antigenicity of the
recombinant fusion protein, proteins separated by 12%
SDS-PAGE were subsequently subjected to Western blot
analysis with rabbit anti-DPV serum. The purified
recombinant protein was then mixed with an equal
volume of Freund’s complete adjuvant (Sigma) and used
to immunize rabbits by intradermal injection, followed

by two additional intradermal inoculations with Freund’s
incomplete adjuvant once every 7 days and the last
inoculation with the purified recombinant protein. After
the fourth immunization, anti-DPV gC serum was collected. Then, the purified IgG polyclonal antibodies
were obtained by purification using caprylic acid and
ammonium sulfate precipitation and High-Q anion
exchange chromatography.
FQ-PCR

Total RNA was isolated from mock-or DPV-infected cells
at different times (1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 36, 54, 72 hpi)
and was reverse transcribed at 37°C for 120 min using
random primer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The real-time PCR assays were performed using an
iCycler iQ™ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad
Lab., Hercules, CA, USA). The primers used for PCR
amplification were as follows: forward primer 5’-GAAGGACGGAATGGTGGAAG-3’ and reverse primer
5’-AGCGGGTAACGAGATCTAATATTGA-3’, which
amplify a 78-base pair (bp) fragment of DPV gC gene,
and for the endogenous control gene b-actin, forward
primer 5’-CCGGGCATCGCTGACA-3’ and reverse primer 5’-GGATTCATCATACTCCTGCTTGCT-3’. The

was confirmed by melt curve analysis. Analysis of the
real-time PCR data was carried out using the comparative
