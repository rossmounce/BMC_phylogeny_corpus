Abstract
Background: Earth history events such as climate change are believed to have played a major role in shaping
patterns of genetic structure and diversity in species. However, there is a lag between the time of historical events
and the collection of present-day samples that are used to infer contemporary population structure. During this lag
phase contemporary processes such as dispersal or non-random mating can erase or reinforce population
differences generated by historical events. In this study we evaluate the role of both historical and contemporary
processes on the phylogeography of a widespread North American songbird, the Northern Cardinal, Cardinalis
cardinalis.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed deep mtDNA structure with six lineages across the species’ range.
Ecological niche models supported the same geographic breaks revealed by the mtDNA. A paleoecological niche
model for the Last Glacial Maximum indicated that cardinals underwent a dramatic range reduction in eastern
North America, whereas their ranges were more stable in México. In eastern North America cardinals expanded out
of glacial refugia, but we found no signature of decreased genetic diversity in areas colonized after the Last Glacial
Maximum. Present-day demographic data suggested that population growth across the expansion cline is
positively correlated with latitude. We propose that there was no loss of genetic diversity in areas colonized after
the Last Glacial Maximum because recent high-levels of gene flow across the region have homogenized genetic
diversity in eastern North America.
Conclusion: We show that both deep historical events as well as demographic processes that occurred following
these events are critical in shaping genetic pattern and diversity in C. cardinalis. The general implication of our
results is that patterns of genetic diversity are best understood when information on species history, ecology, and
demography are considered simultaneously.

Background
A multitude of studies of various North American taxa
have shown that historical events, such as Pleistocene
climatic changes coupled with topographic, hydrologic
and ecological barriers, were instrumental in generating
phylogeographic structure within species [1-4]. From the
extensive body of phylogeographic work on North

American species, two generalizations have emerged 1)
taxa were isolated into independently evolving lineages
(i.e. species, subspecies, phylogroups) during the Pleistocene [5] and 2) genetic diversity within species is highest
in areas that remained stable (refugia) through glacial
cycles [6]. Ultimately, these hypothesized predictions
seek to link the phylogeographic structure in species to
historical events.
A recent and critical historical event was the Last Glacial Maximum, a time when ice sheets covered much of
present-day temperate North America. Entire biotas

were fragmented and displaced to more southern latitudes [6]. After the glaciers receded certain species colonized these newly available areas by rapid long-distance
dispersal, a phenomenon referred to as the leading edge
or pioneer model [7]. A major prediction of the leading
edge model is that genetic diversity will be lower in the
recently colonized areas. This idea is supported by the
observation that many species have higher genetic diversity in European refugial areas [6]. Additionally, genetic
data indicate that historical population expansions
occurred in many species, a finding consistent with species colonizing newly available areas with suitable habitat.
A goal of phylogeography is to recover evidence of population expansions; however, the lag between earlier population expansions and the present represents a time when
ongoing demographic processes can either erase earlier
genetic signatures of population structure or expansions
or prevent such signatures from developing at all.
Contemporary processes can affect the spatial distribution of genetic diversity in various ways. High levels
of gene flow may homogenize haplotype diversity
throughout a population that once showed genetic
structure. Conversely, nonrandom mating with individuals in close geographic proximity can generate genetic
structuring within a continuous population [8]. Autecology also plays a critical role in how species maintain
genetic connectivity across the landscape [9,10]. Vagile
species with high ecological thresholds will be able
spread haplotypes across an area more readily than poor
dispersers with narrow ecological requirements. Interpretations of genetic diversity patterns are further confounded by changes in gene flow due to oscillations in
population densities and by shifts in the connectivity of
habitats. These points highlight the complexity of population-level processes and emphasize that genetic patterns of diversity may become so tightly coupled to ongoing processes that signatures of historical differences
or similarities may be erased.
To examine the impact of historical and contemporary
processes on genetic pattern and diversity, we investigated a broadly distributed North American songbird,
the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis). Cardinals
are distributed from southeastern Canada, throughout
the eastern United States, and in the southwestern states
south through the Mexican lowlands to northern Central America [11]. Cardinalis cardinalis is currently
divided into 18 subspecies representing four subspecies
groups [11]. The species inhabits multiple biomes which
include deserts, dry and humid tropical forests, and
deciduous temperate forests. In all regions it prefers
similar habitats of shrubs, small trees, forest-edge, or
secondary growth [11].
In this study we use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
sequences, ecological niche models, and demographic

data to test the impacts of historical and contemporary
processes on pattern of present-day genetic differentiation and diversity in C. cardinalis. First, we evaluated
whether historical events had generated deep phylogeographic structure or monophyletic groups in mtDNA
across the range of cardinals. Second, we tested for the
signature of historical demographic expansions that
should have been generated in populations that
expanded following glacial retreat. Third, we used present-day and paleoecological niche models to explore if
clades had geographically stable ranges since the Last
Glacial Maximum. Finally, we evaluate if genetic diversity patterns can be explained by contemporary demographic processes.

Results
Genetic Diversity and Pattern

The best-fit models of sequence evolution were GTR + I
+ G for the complete ND2 gene, GTR + I for the 1 st
and 2 nd codons and GTR + I +G for the 3 rd codon.
Both the partitioned and unpartitioned analyses yielded
trees with similar topologies but with different likelihoods. The partitioned dataset (lnL -5082.52) was a better fit to the data than the unpartitioned data (lnL
-5354.79) with a ln Bayes factor of 272.27. Although the
harmonic mean method can be sensitive to a high
degree of variance [12-14], the Bayes factors reported
here are informative because the likelihoods of the two
mtDNA gene trees are well separated [15]. The mtDNA
tree strongly indicated deep genetic structure across the
range of C. cardinalis with no mtDNA haplotype sharing among regions except potentially in the Mexican
Gulf coast region (Figure 1). Most major nodes in the
tree had posterior probabilities greater than 0.95. Exceptions were the node for the cardinalis clade (pp < 0.50)
and the lack of reciprocal monophyly between the coccineus and saturatus clades. Uncorrected node to internode genetic distance for each clade ranged from 0.35 2.60% (Table 1).

Summary of genetic diversity indices and range sizes for the six Cardinalis cardinalis clades. Number of individuals (n). Number of unique haplotypes (Hap).
Metric on the proportion of unique haplotypes in a clade (Hap diversity). Nucleotide diversity with complete clade sampling (Nuc Diversity). Nucleotide diversity
with equal sampling per clade (Nuc Diversity*). Node to internode genetic distance based uncorrected p-distances (Genetic Dist).

The genetic breaks are largely concordant with the
four long-recognized morphological groups: carneus,
igneus, coccineus, and cardinalis [11] with the addition
of two monophyletic island lineages, saturatus within
coccineus and mariae within igneus (Figure 1, Figure 2).
Molecular dating from mtDNA indicated that C. cardinalis diverged from the Miocene to Late Pleistocene.
The basal split in the mtDNA tree separates the carneus
clade from all other cardinals occurred 3.41 million
years ago (95% HPD: 0.99-6.78). The remaining cardinals split into western and eastern clades approximately
2.39 million years ago (95% HPD: 0.66-4.87). The western clade is comprised of a monophyletic igneus, distributed throughout the Baja California Peninsula,
Sonoran and southern Mojave deserts and a monophyletic mariae on the Tres Marías Islands. Mariae
diverged from the mainland 1.42 million years ago (95%
HPD: 0.31-2.86). The eastern clade is comprised of
three groups (Figure 1). Coccineus occurs on the Yucatán Peninsula and is paraphyletic with respect to the
monophyletic saturatus group that occurs only on
Cozumel Island. Haplotypes in northeastern México
belong to cardinalis, although traditional taxonomy had
placed specimens from this region in coccineus. The

cardinalis clade is geographically widespread, distributed
throughout eastern North America and potentially as far
south as Veracruz, México. The first divergence in the
eastern clade occurred approximately 1.2 million years
ago (95% HPD: 0.27-0.27) and the second, the divergence of the Cozumel Island cardinals occurred 0.46
million years ago (95% HPD: 0.07-1.06)
Population genetic analyses revealed differing levels of
genetic structure for the two more widespread clades,
igneus of northwest México and the southwestern US
and cardinalis of eastern North America. In igneus
20.3% of the genetic variation was among and 79.7%
was within populations (AMOVA, Table 2). There is
very little structure in cardinalis with 97.8% of variation
within and 2.2% among populations (Table 2). Nucleotide diversity within clades ranged from 0.00024 0.00434 (complete clade sampling) and 0.00032 0.00397 (equal sampling; Table 1). Nucleotide diversity
within the cardinalis clade ranged from 0.00278 0.00511 and haplotype diversity was high across all geographic localities 0.900 - 1.000 (Table 3). The igneus
clade had lower nucleotide diversity (0.00017 - 0.00368)
with the lowest diversity in northern part of the range

(Arizona and New México). The pattern of haplotype
distributions was low haplotype diversity (0.182) and no
private haplotypes in the north (Table 3).
For the historical demographic tests, the best-fit substitution model was the same for all three clades (cardinalis, igneus, and coccineus); HKY for 1st and 2nd codon
positions and GTR for 3 rd codon position. Because
igneus shows geographic structure (Table 2), the analysis
was run without the Tiburon Island samples (igneus A,
Table 4) and a second time without both the Tiburón
Island and Baja California samples (igneus B, Table 4).
Historical demographic tests for igneus (A and B) and
coccineus did not yield robust results because the likelihood values between the constant and expansion growth
models were not well-differentiated (Table 4). Lack of
evidence for population expansion was further seen in
Bayesian skyline plots for igneus and coccineus (Figure
3A and 3B), which were flat across time. In contrast, the
Bayesian skyline plot for the cardinalis clade indicated
population expansion over time (Figure 3C). The Bayes
factors favored the expansion growth model for the cardinalis clade, but given the problems with estimating
Bayes factors from the harmonic mean [12-14], the
result must be interpreted with caution.
Ecological Niche Models

Locality records obtained from museum specimens
(ORNIS) and field observations (Avian Knowledge Network) indicated that the range of C. cardinalis is not continuous (Figure 4A). We constructed separate models

igneus A - Tiburón Island samples were removed.
igneus B - Baja California and Tiburón Island samples removed

from the four clades with the following number of
records; cardinalis (n = 232), carneus (n = 86), igneus (n
= 195), and coccineus (n = 151). The ecological niche
models produced by MAXENT performed better than
random predictions and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was close to one (AUC >
0.91) for the four mainland clades. Ecological niche models performed well for the two island populations based
on the MAXENT diagnostics but the models did not
accurately predict the small distributions of the island
populations; therefore these models are not presented.
The distributions generated from the present-day ecological niche models (Figure 4B) were consistent with the
genetic breaks observed in our mtDNA gene tree (Figure
1). There was no suitable climatic conditions connecting
cardinalis and igneus across west Texas and New Mexico, but the model predicted areas with suitable climatic
conditions for cardinalis into the range of igneus. There
was a predicted continuous range across the Gulf Coast
connecting the cardinalis and coccineus groups, but only
with the lowest suitable values projected onto the map
(Figure 4B). The northern extent of the pre-19th century
ecological niche models for igneus and cardinalis tightly
follows the northern limits of the locaily records specified
in the model (Figure 4C).
The paleoecological niche model showed a pronounced reduction in the current range of the cardinalis
clade in the eastern half of the U. S. A., which suggested
that our samples in Louisiana, the Southeast, eastern
México and possibly Texas are from areas that were a

Maximum. The Last Glacial Maximum model also indicated that there were suitable conditions for the cardinalis clade across the Chihuahuan Desert into the
Sonoran Desert and east of the Sierra Madre Oriental
(Figure 4D). There appears to have been a reduction in
suitable climatic conditions for cardinals in México,
such as on Baja California and the Mexican Pacific
coast, but there was not the extreme range reduction
seen in the cardinals of eastern North America.

were stable and colonized in the post-glacial period currently have a density of 30 - 100 individuals per area,
while areas colonized in the 19th century have 10 - 30
individuals per area (Figure 6A).

Discussion
Historical Signal - Phylogeographic Structure

Recent historical events, particularly Pleistocene glacialinterglacial cycles, have had a critical impact on generating phylogeographic structure in species [4]. Typically,
phylogeographic studies have examined how species
responded to these events within a single biome or biogeographic region [16-18]. Here, we report how a

latitudes that had genetic samples included in the study. The
colored portions represent latitudes that were inferred from the

species distributed across multiple biomes and biogeographic regions of North America responded to the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene. In the Northern
Cardinal, we found six lineages that have been likely differentiating since the Pliocene. Each of the four continental clades is found in a well-established
biogeographic area: the Mexican Pacific coast, the
Sonoran and Peninsular deserts, eastern North America
and the Yucatán Peninsula. Additionally, two insular
lineages on Cozumel and the Tres Marías Islands were
monophyletic.
Major geological and climatic barriers appear to define
the ranges of the mainland clades. The distribution of
carneus is constrained by the Sierra Madre del Sur to
the east and habitat turnover to the north and south.
Igenus shares a range with many co-distributed desert
species that border the Sierra Madre Occidental to the
east and extend to the northern and southern limits of
the Sonoran Desert. This clade does not exhibit the
deep genetic structure between the Sonoran and Peninsular desert populations found in other co-distributed

species [19]. However, low-levels of genetic structure
were detected in igneus, which is likely due to recent
differentiation of the putative subspecies found in the
Sonoran Desert, Baja California Peninsula, and Tiburón
Island [20]. Present-day gene flow among cardinals in
these areas is likely limited by their geographic isolation
or by ecological constraints [21], but gene exchange
among these groups could have been more regular during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were
lower [22] and populations were in closer proximity.
Igneus is replaced in the Chihuahuan Desert by cardinalis and haplotypes of both clades are found east and
west of the Chihuahuan-Sonoran transition zone. This
region has been identified as an area where many species exhibit genetic breaks and phylogroups often come
into secondary contact [4]. Although our sampling was
limited in the transition zone, we found no evidence of
geographic overlap in these haplotypes and our genetic
data and ecological niche model support an earlier conclusion that these forms do not hybridize [20]. The present-day ecological niche model found the geographic
area between these clades unsuitable for either group,
but the paleoecological niche model indicated a more
continuous distribution across this gap during the Last
Glacial Maximum.
The evolution of the cardinalis clade in eastern North
America has been a history of population connectivity.
Remarkably, cardinalis, with a range of over 3,000,000
km 2 , has no appreciable geographic structure in
mtDNA, an unexpected pattern for a widely distributed
clade that has several described subspecies. Comparative
phylogeographic work on other widely distributed avian
species has shown a similar pattern of unstructured
mtDNA in eastern North American birds [23]. Alternatively, a diverse array of taxa including birds distributed
in the southeast U.S.A. exhibit distinct phylogeographic
structure that was shaped by a diverse array of historical
factors [1].
The range limits of cardinalis and coccineus in eastern
México are not well understood, but the mtDNA break
coincides with the biogeographic barrier separating the
Yucatán Peninsula biotic province from surrounding
regions [24]. Morphological work has identified an area
of turnover where cardinalis grades into coccineus in
Tamaulipas [25]. Based on genetic data presented, however, specimens from Tamaulipas and areas farther
south in Querétaro and Veracruz, México all possessed
cardinalis haplotypes. Much of the Gulf Coast along
México is unsuitable for cardinals because it has been
converted to agriculture or encompasses low-lying areas
that periodically flood. The ecological niche model also
showed that habitat along the Gulf Coast to be sub-optimal. Additionally, coccineus appears to be a recently
diverged lineage and is paraphyletic with respect to the

Page 7 of 12

monophyletic saturatus, a pattern consistent with
incomplete lineage sorting between young groups [26].
The two island lineages, mariae and saturatus, are
currently classified as subspecies in the igneus and coccineus groups, respectively, and both are monophyletic,
suggesting that they are independently evolving lineages.
Despite Cozumel being only 20 kms from the mainland
and remerging 120,000 years ago [27], its biota has
become distinct, with eight endemic bird and mammal
species. Mariae occurs on the Tres Marías Islands, a
small island chain 100 km off the Pacific coast of México that was likely submerged in the Late Pleistocene
[28] and has several endemic subspecies [29]. Molecular
dating indicated that the mean mtDNA estimates of
these island lineages are “older” than the islands. The
divergence of the Tres Marías Islands lineage from the
mainland was not congruent with the island’s geology;
the 95% HPD (0.31-2.86 million years ago) covers a
time period before the island was presumably under
water. But, the low end of 95% HPD for the divergence
of the Cozumel Island (0.07-1.06 million years ago) is
consistent with geology. The incongruence between the
ND2 gene tree and geology may be due to an elevated
island substitution rate [30], an undetected time-dependent substitution rate [31], or coalescent variance [32].
Understanding the age of theses island lineages will
require more thorough molecular dating using multilocus data.
Mitochondrial DNA as a Phylogeographic Marker

Mitochondrial DNA is a powerful marker for identifying
independently evolving populations within species
because of its fast mutation rate and maternal inheritance [33]. However, incomplete lineage sorting [34],
rate variation [35], and selection [36] can limit the utility
of mtDNA as an evolutionary marker. Overall, the phylogeographic structure presented in this study is largely
congruent with the morphological groups previously
described for the species. These mtDNA lineages reflect
a long history of isolation and independent evolutionary
trajectories that merit further evaluation using multilocus coalescent methods [37].
Genetic diversity estimated from mtDNA is impacted
by a number of factors, such as population size, age,
genetic drift and mutation rate [38]. By using range size
and genetic distances as proxies for population size and
time of isolation, we were able to show that nucleotide
diversity in C. cardinalis was more strongly coupled to
range size than genetic distance. This relationship
between range size and genetic diversity was expected
because larger ranges have the potential for larger populations and thus are able to accrue higher levels of
genetic diversity [39]. But, this finding is important
because it suggests that mtDNA genetic diversity is at

Smith et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:136
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/136

least partially coupled with cardinal population size, and
indicates that the estimates provided here have not been
strongly affected by selection and linkage to the W sex
chromosome [40] or genetic draft [41].
Post-glacial Expansion: Historical to Contemporary
Demography

The leading edge model of post-glacial expansion predicts there will be lower genetic diversity in recently
colonized regions [7]. Despite strong evidence for this
model in some taxa and some geographic areas, there
has not been compelling evidence for this pattern in
North American birds [[17], [42], [43]; but see [44]].
These results are often attributed to other factors such
as mixing of separate refugial populations, un-sampled
populations, or rapid expansions. Both our genetic data
and our ecological niche modeling suggest a population
expansion for the cardinalis.
Given that the cardinalis clade likely expanded out of a
glacial refugium, it is surprising that we found nucleotide
diversity, haplotype diversity and the frequency of private
haplotypes to be uniform across cardinalis sampling localities. Intuitively, homogeneous genetic diversity would seem
attributable to birds being more vagile than other vertebrates, but this is unlikely the case here. Many birds are
constrained by the same ecological barriers as non-volant
organisms [45]. This ecological limitation of dispersal is evident in igneus, which has also undergone a recorded northern range expansion. Our igneus samples from Arizona/
New Mexico had lower haplotype and genetic diversity
than samples from Sinaloa. A critical difference between
cardinalis and igneus is the amount of habitat connectivity
across their ranges. There are few major dispersal barriers
for cardinals in eastern North America, allowing the species
to freely disperse in any direction. On the other hand, in
the areas of the arid Sonoran Desert where cardinals have
recently colonized, they are more restricted to habitats with
suitable vegetation such as riparian zones.
The high genetic diversity in recently established
populations of the eastern cardinalis contradicts the
leading edge model and begs explanation. One suggested alternative is the Phalanx model, which posits
that large populations expanded slowly into newly available habitats with no loss of genetic diversity in newly
colonized areas [7]. Although the Phalanx predicts
homogenous genetic diversity as seen in cardinalis, we
see no reason for cardinals to have expanded their range
slowly. Indeed, the rapid northward range expansion
documented in the last 150 years suggests cardinals
have high dispersal rates and can rapidly populate suitable habitat. Why may this be the case?
We suggest that cardinals in eastern North America
were held at low numbers by a shortage of suitable
habitat prior to the European settlement of North

Page 8 of 12

America. Throughout their range cardinals inhabit
brushy open habitat, and prior to European settlement
this ecotonal species lived in a sea of eastern hardwood
forest where suitable habitat was patchy and ephemeral,
created by water courses, tree falls, and fires. Throughout most of the evolutionary history of eastern cardinals,
suitable habitat must have been ephemeral, leading to
selection for high dispersal ability. Once European settlement converted most of Eastern North America into
a vast ecotone of excellent cardinal habitat, their evolved
propensity for high dispersal would homogenize genetic
diversity across vast areas.
The hypothesis that cardinals exhibit high dispersal
abilities is borne out by an analysis of banding records
for cardinals [46]. Although conducted before root
mean square dispersal was being estimated, Dow and
Scott [46] found that 190 of 1523 recovered cardinals
were found outside the 10-minute block of latitude and
longitude where they were banded; among those that
moved beyond their block, first years moved an average
distance of 60 km and adults moved an average of 130
km [11]. These are large distances for a resident bird
[47], and comparing them with results for North American blackbirds analyzed in modern ways [48] suggests
that root mean square dispersal for Northern Cardinals
is very high, possibly exceeding 100 km. Dispersal distances of this magnitude would be sufficient to homogenize genetic variation in a short period of time.
What these data suggest is that during the lag between
historical expansion and the present-day, contemporary
demography has played a role in shaping the observed
genetic diversity pattern. Population densities are lowest
at higher latitudes and population growth increases with
latitude. We suggest that this population growth is not
just from offspring staying in one area and increasing
the density of individuals. Instead, populations are also
growing as new individuals with different haplotypes are
moving into new areas. Given that genetic diversity is
uniform even in the youngest cardinal populations, at
the highest latitudes, the lag between expansion and
genetic homogenization may be on the order of decades
instead of hundreds or thousands of years. As new areas
became inhabitable, dispersal would likely not have been
just in a northern and linear fashion, but east and west.
If cardinals expanded out of southern glacial refuges
rapidly and in large numbers, the signature of decreased
genetic diversity may have been rapidly erased or alternatively, potentially never existed at all.

Conclusions
In this study we used a widely distributed songbird, the
Northern Cardinal, Cardinalis cardinalis, as a model to
test historical predictions for how species evolved in
response to Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. We

Smith et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:136
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/136

found evidence in the mitochondrial DNA and from our
modeled distribution of the species that there is deep
phylogeographic structure in C. cardinalis, which is consistent with fragmentation caused by historical climate
change. This structure likely began developing well
before the Late Pleistocene and is supported by the
results of both contemporary and paleoecological niche
models. A modeled paleodistribution along with historical demographic hypothesis tests indicated that cardinals
expanded out of refugia in eastern North America since
the Last Glacial Maximum. However, there is no signature of decreased genetic diversity in areas colonized
after the expansion. We suggest on-going gene flow
across eastern North America has likely homogenized
genetic diversity across the region. These results demonstrate that both Earth history events and cotemporary
processes are important in determining the geography
of genetic diversity observed within species.

Methods
We obtained samples from 163 individuals of Cardinalis
cardinalis that includes representatives from 14 of the
18 recognized subspecies and the four subspecies
groups: carneus, igneus, coccineus, and cardinalis (Additional file 1). We included six closely related species
[49] in our dataset; C. sinuatus, C. phoeniceus, Rhodothraupis celaeno, Periporphyrus eyrthromelas, Caryothraustes poliogaster, and C. canadensis) and the more
distantly related Molothrus ater as the outgroup. We
extracted total genomic DNA from tissues and toe-pads
from voucher specimens using the DNeasy tissue extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). We amplified the mitochondrial gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit II (ND2)
via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers
L5215 [50] and HTrpc (STRI). We used 12.5 μl reactions using the following protocol: denaturation at 94°C
for 10 min, 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 45 s,
and 72°C for 2 min, followed by a final 10 min elongation at 72°C. PCR products were sent to High-Throughput Genomics Unit (University of Washington, Seattle)
for all subsequent sequencing steps. PCR products were
purified using ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cambridge, MA), run through cycle-sequencing reactions
and final products were sequenced using BigDye
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a highthroughput capillary sequencer. We aligned chromatograms of the forward and reverse strands in Sequencher
4.9 (GeneCodes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) and
sequences were translated into amino acids to check for
premature stop codons.
Genetic Pattern

We used several approaches to get an understanding of
the distribution of genetic diversity within C. cardinalis.

Page 9 of 12

Aligned sequences were run through the program Mr.
Modeltest v. 2.3 [51] to estimate an appropriate model
of sequence evolution. We determined the sequence
evolution model for the complete ND2 gene as well as
data partitioned by codon position (1st and 2nd codon
positions and 3rd codon position). The best fit sequence
model was determined by use of the Akiake Information
Criterion (AIC). We constructed a gene tree using the
program, MrBayes v. 3.1.2 [52]. We constructed gene
trees with the non-partitioned data and partitioned by
codon positions. The branch length prior was set to
unconstrained with an exponential distribution with the
parameter set to 100.0 to avoid artificially long branches
[53]. All priors were unlinked for the partitioned data
and we ran this analysis for seven million generations
and sampled every 1000. We performed diagnostic tests
to evaluate mixing and convergence of MCMC chains
and the burn-in was determined from visual inspection
of the likelihood plots in the program Tracer v 1.5 [54].
To determine which approach was the best fit to the
data, we used Bayes factors, computed from the harmonic mean of the non-partitioned and partitioned posterior likelihoods. We estimated divergence times using the
program BEAST v. 1. 6. 1 [55] and ran the analyses with
a fixed substitution rate of 1.23 × 10-2 subs/site/lineage/
million years, a rate estimated relative to the avian “2%
rule” [56] used for the gene cytochrome-b [see [45]].
We unlinked ND2 codon positions, and used a Yule
speciation tree prior and a relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock (lognormal distribution, mean 0.0123, SD =
0.45). The analysis was run for 50 million generations
and the posterior output was examined in Tracer v 1.5
[54] to assess mixing and convergence of MCMC
chains.
Genetic Diversity

Clades identified from our gene tree were used to estimate the genetic distance (internode to clade node distance) using an uncorrected p-distance for each clade in
the program MEGA 4 [57]. Two of the clades, igneus
and cardinalis have relatively large ranges and are comprised of several subspecies; therefore we examined the
amount of genetic structure within and among subpopulations for each of these clades by performing an
AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) in the program Arlequin v. 3.11 [58]. For the group designation
for the AMOVA, we used U. S. states for cardinalis and
for igneus we used the regions Baja California Sur,
Tiburón Island, Arizona/New Mexico and Sinaloa. We
calculated genetic diversity (the average number of
nucleotide differences per site between two sequences),
haplotype diversity [59], and the frequency of private
haplotypes in the program DNAsp v. 5.10.01 [60] for
each clade and for subpopulations that had adequate

Smith et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:136
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/136

sample sizes (n ≥ 8). Sample sizes among clades were
skewed; therefore we estimated nucleotide diversity with
all available samples in a clade and with equal samples
(n = 6).

Page 10 of 12

To perform hypothesis tests on cardinal historical
demography, we re-estimated sequence models for each
individual clade that had adequate sampling (cardinalis,
coccineus, and igneus). We evaluated demographic history in the program BEAST v. 1. 5.4 [55] by comparing
the likelihood of three different models for the coalescent tree prior - constant population size, expansion
growth, and Bayesian skyline. This approach allowed us
to use Bayes factors to test whether a population expansion was more likely than a constant population size
[61]. Given that the approach used to estimate Bayes
factors in Tracer has been shown to be yield unstable
results [12-14], we additionally evaluated demographic
history by examining Bayesian skyline plots, which
shows a visual representation of population change over
time. We used the same parameter settings (except we
used a strict molecular clock for this analysis) and
MCMC diagnostics as our BEAST divergence time analysis. Bayes factors were calculated by manually summing the tree likelihood and coalescent/skyline columns
in the BEAST log file.

conservative and rough estimate of cardinal’s pre-19th
century range (post-glacial) in eastern North America
and 33° N in the southwest U. S. A. All records above
these latitudes were not included in the analysis in the
post-glacial ecological niche models.
We used the Bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim dataset (v. 1.4) with a resolution of 2.5 min [63].
Eight of the variables were correlated with other variables (R> 0.90); therefore, we used 11 of the 19 temperature and precipitation variables (BIO1, BIO2, BIO5,
BIO6, BIO8, BIO9, BIO10, BIO12, BIO13, BIO15 and
BIO18). We generated five replicate models for each
separate clade identified from our phylogenetic analysis
using the maximum entropy algorithm in MAXENT
3.3.3 [64]. The model was then applied to the Model for
Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) layers
to estimate suitable climatic conditions for C. cardinalis
during the Last Glacial Maximum. We visualized models
in the program ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA).
Because the distribution of C. cardinalis is well known
we used a digital range map [65] to set the logistic
threshold values for the climatic suitability for each
clade and applied these same threshold values to the
paleoecological niche models. To calculate range size of
each clade, we converted the model raster files into
polygons in ArcGIS 9.3 and recorded polygon area in
square kilometers.

Ecological Niche Models

Contemporary Demography

We downloaded locality records from two online databases, ORNIS (museum records only http://ornisnet.org)
and observation records from the Avian Knowledge Network http://www.avianknowledge.net/content and
plotted all records to get an estimate of the C. cardinalis
distribution. To build an ecological niche model for C.
cardinalis, we used only records from observations and
specimens collected for this study. We assumed that
these locality records are the most precise because they
have been collected in the last ten years. The number of
observation records for C. cardinalis was heavily skewed
towards records in eastern North America where it is a
common “backyard” bird. Therefore, we randomly
sampled a subset of the records in order to have a more
even sampling scheme. In total we compiled 664 records
for C. cardinalis.
Beginning in the late 1800 s a well-documented northward range expansion has been recorded for C. cardinalis in the northern U. S. A. and the Colorado River
Basin [11,62]. We built additional ecological niche models that attempted to approximate the pre-expansion
distribution by making an estimate of their pre-19th century range. The specific limits of the species’ range prior
to expansion are not precisely known. Therefore, based
on distribution records [11], we used 40° N as a

To evaluate the impact of contemporary demography on
genetic diversity, we used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, a long-term demographic
study on breeding birds in the USA and Canada [66].
Breeding Bird Survey data is based on mean counts of
species along specified routes from these data density
and population growth estimates are approximated. The
datasets we used were population growth (% change
over time) and population density estimates. We used
population growth based on estimates of demographic
trends of this species in a U. S. state over 40 years
(1966-2007). For population densities, we directly
extracted values from the Summer Distribution Map
1994-2003 using the average latitude from our genetic
samples.
