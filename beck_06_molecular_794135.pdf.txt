Abstract
Background: Inguinal hernias are usually caused by a congenital defect, which occurs as a
weakness of the inguinal canal. Porcine β-glucuronidase gene (GUSB) was chosen as functional
candidate gene because of its involvement in degradation of hyaluronan within gubernacular tissue
during descent of testes. Since a genome-wide linkage analysis approach has shown evidence that
two regions on porcine chromosome 3 (SSC 3) are involved in the inheritance of hernia inguinalis/
scrotalis in German pig breeds, GUSB also attained status as a positional candidate gene by its
localization within a hernia-associated chromosomal region.
Results: A contig spanning 17,157 bp, which contains the entire GUSB, was assembled.
Comparative sequence analyses were conducted for the GUSB gene locus. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the coding region of GUSB were genotyped in 512 animals.
Results of transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) for two out of a total of five detected SNPs gave
no significant association with the outcome of hernia in pigs.
Conclusion: On the basis of our studies we are able to exclude the two analyzed SNPs within the
porcine GUSB gene as causative for the transmission of inguinal hernia.

Background
Inguinal and scrotal hernias are usually caused by a congenital defect, which occurs as a weakness of the inguinal
canal. About 1 % of all litters in German pig breeds are
affected [1]. In several studies the estimated values of heritability for inguinal hernias in pigs range from h2 = 0.2 [2]
to h2 > 0.6 [3,4]. The inguinal/scrotal hernia condition in
pigs and in humans is affected by both environmental and
genetic factors, with the involvement of multiple genes
and likely incomplete penetrance, although the mode of

inheritance has not been clarified so far and is still controversially discussed in literature [3,5-7]. In humans a high
segregation ratio suggesting an autosomal dominant
inheritance with incomplete penetrance and sex influence
was reported. Additionally, the authors of this study noted
a preferential paternal transmission of the disease gene
and suggested a possible role of genomic imprinting in
the aetiology of the hernia condition in man [8]. Anatomical factors such as an abnormal wide inguinal canal or a
not obliterated processus vaginalis are regarded as predis-

posing for inguinal and scrotal hernia. Thus a predisposition takes place during and shortly after testicular descent.
The gubernaculum or genitofemoral ligament is emerging as
the key anatomical structure in the control of testicular
descent. The first phase of testicular migration [9] is characterized by rapid growth of the gubernaculum, which
serves to dilate the inguinal canal prior to descent of the
testes. This is accomplished through a rapid swelling of
the gubernaculum due to formation of hydrated space,
mediated mainly by the formation and deposition of
hyaluronan (HA) within the gubernacular tissue [10,11].

or several of the genes coding for the HA degrading
enzymes.

During the second phase of testicular descent the gubernaculum involutes, presumably due to the removal of HA,
thus allowing the testes to descend into the scrotum [12].
Enzymes that act in the biodegradation of HA feature the
second phase of testicular descent, these are hyaluronidase, β-hexosaminidase and β-glucuronidase.

Here we report the isolation and complete genomic characterization of the porcine GUSB gene, its status as a positional candidate gene for congenital inguinal and scrotal
hernia in combination with results obtained from linkage
and association analysis of SSC3. Further, an association
study of two SNPs within the GUSB coding sequence was
conducted to elucidate their relevance for the phenotype
hernia inguinalis/scrotalis.

Our hypothesis is that the swelling of the gubernaculum
exceeds through accumulation of HA due to a diminished
degradation. The inguinal ring is thus extended in an
unphysiological way and may remain open predisposing
the male pigs for inguinal and scrotal hernia. The limitation of HA degradation may be based on mutations in one

A genome-wide linkage scan was conducted to identify
chromosomal regions involved in the inheritance of hernia in pigs [13,14]. GUSB first considered as functional
candidate was mapped within a region on porcine chromosome 3 (SSC3) [15] that was found to be associated
with congenital inguinal and scrotal hernia. Therefore, the
gene was considered as a positional candidate in addition
to its functional relevance.

Results and discussion
Linkage and association analysis on SSC3
Linkage analysis on SSC3 was conducted using 13 microsatellites. Table 1 shows the 13 microsatellite markers

their position on the chromosome and the location of the
significant nonparametric LOD scores (NPL) obtained in
single- and multipoint analyses. The information content
was 0.62 on average. Two regions on chromosome 3
(region I: between 12.4 cM and 19 cM; region II between
98.2 cM and 102.2 cM) showed significant NPL. The singlepoint analysis revealed a significant NPL for markers
SW72 (region I, p = 0.0125) and S0002 (region II, p =
0.0119), while multipoint linkage analysis gave significant NPL values for the five region I markers SW2021 (p =
0.0074), SW2429 (p = 0.0177), SW833 (p = 0.0137),
SW72 (p = 0.0022), SE51018 (p = 0.0057), and for the
two region II markers SW2408 (p = 0.0318) and S0002 (p
= 0.0097).
The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was applied
to all markers on SSC3 the resulting p-values are given in
Table 1. TDT confirmed the results of the nonparametric
linkage analysis within region I for the markers SW2429,
SW833, SW72 (p ≤ 0.05) and within region II for marker
S0002 (p ≤ 0.1). A significant TDT score (p ≤ 0.1) was also
found for marker SW1327 located at position 109.6 cM,
about 6 cM distal of region II.
Physical distances between GUSB and microsatellite
markers
GUSB was mapped by analyses of a whole-genome radiation hybrid panel [16] and fluorescence in situ hybridization, the most significantly linked markers were SW251
and SW72 [15]. Twopoint analyses gave a distance of 61
cR to SW72 and one of 54 cR to SW251. Hawken and colleagues estimated a conversion ratio (kb to cR) for the
panel of 50.4 kb/cR on SSC3 [17]. Therefore, the distances
in cR correspond to a distance of 3.07 Mb between GUSB

locus and SW72 and one of 2.72 Mb between GUSB locus
and SW251 at 42.3 cM [18].
These results confirmed GUSB as a positional candidate
gene for congenital inguinal and scrotal hernia in addition to its previously proposed functional relevance.
Structural characterization of clone TAIGP714N09100Q
Pulsed field electrophoresis after NotI digestion of the isolated PAC clone TAIGP714N09100Q revealed an insert
size of 80 kb. Subsequent partial sequence characterization confirmed that the clone contained the whole porcine functional GUSB gene as well as at least one exon of
the so far uncharacterized porcine VKORC1L1 (vitamin-K
epoxide reductase paralog) gene.
Characterization of genomic sequence and comparative
sequence analyses
A contig spanning 17,157 bp, which contained the entire
GUSB gene and 2.7 kb of its 5' and 3' flanking regions was
assembled [GenBank:DQ095863] by a combination of
subcloning, primerwalking and sequencing of long range
PCR-products. The porcine GUSB gene spans over 14,436
bp (from start to stop codon) and consists of 12 exons
ranging in length from 85 bp to 213 bp, which are separated by introns ranging in length from 84 bp to 3,928 bp.
While the length of the exons is highly conserved between
humans and pig, the size of the introns varies considerably, thus accounting for the larger size (21,521 bp) of the
human GUSB compared to its porcine ortholog.

A comparison of the porcine GUSB protein-encoding
region (1,959 bp) with mammalian orthologs revealed
nucleotide sequence identities of 88% with the feline

GUSB [GenBank:NM_001009310], 87% with the canine
GUSB [GenBank:NM_001003191], 84% with the human
GUSB [GenBank:NM_000181], and 81% with the murine
Gusb [GenBank:J02836]. The observed identities between
the known mammalian GUSB coding sequences are consistent with the molecular phylogenetic relationships
between the different species. PiPMaker program [19] was
further used to align the porcine sequence DQ095836 to
a human BAC clone [GenBank:AC073261] on chromosome 7, that contains the human GUSB gene. Based on
this alignment (data not shown) a region of 25 kb from
position 35,000 to position 60,000 of the human BAC
clone was used for further comparative sequence analyses.
The murine sequence was taken from GenBank entry
J02836. The results of screening for CpG islands and
repetitive elements are shown in Table 2. DQ095863
reveals a high GC content of 54.7% compared to the mean
GC content recently estimated at 49.6% and 40.7% for
porcine coding sequences and introns respectively [20].
The high GC content is consistent with the GC content of
51.8% of the human GUSB gene. Contrary to that the GC
content in the murine Gusb sequence is below 50%
although five CpG islands were detected. Like many other
housekeeping genes, human, murine, and porcine GUSB
genes contain a CpG island that spans the promoter
region, exon 1, and parts of intron 1. Only this promoterassociated CpG island is present in the three species,
although the human (650 bp) and the murine (327 bp)
promoter-associated CpG islands are significantly shorter
than their porcine counterpart (1144 bp). Moreover, the
porcine sequence contains three CpG islands in total the
mouse ortholog five regions, whereas human GUSB contains only two CpG islands. These differences in amount
and length of CpG rich regions contribute to the difference in the total GC content between the human, murine
and porcine sequences. The CpG islands annotated in
Table 2 matched the commonly defined criteria for a CpG
island: 1) regions of DNA of at least 200 bp in length; and
2) a CG content above 50% and a ratio of observed versus
expected CpGs above 0.6 [21].

The human, murine and porcine GUSB sequences were
also screened for repetitive elements using the RepeatMasker database. The total content of repetitive sequences in
human GUSB accounts 57.6%. Contrary, the porcine
GUSB contains only 20.2% repetitive elements. An intermediate repeat content of 34.2% was found in the murine
Gusb gene. In all three species the vast majority among the
repetitive elements are species-specific SINE repeats, with
51.7% in the human and 31.9% in the murine but only
14.7% in the porcine GUSB sequence. This discrepancy
can be explained by the fact that pig-specific SINE repeats
(PREs) [22] are less characterized than human-specific
Alus or murine B1-B4 elements. It is, however, most likely
that this discrepancy primarily reflects a true difference
rather than a biased detection in the species-specific
repeat content, since all human GUSB introns are longer
than their porcine counterparts and should therefore contain more SINE repeats.
Furthermore, 97.9% of the human SINEs are Alu elements, which are specific for primates. Recently, the
human GUSB gene has been described to show an
extremely high percentage of Alu repeats compared to the
human genome average of 6-12%. The authors postulated
that the Alu elements serve a vital function that precedes
pseudogene proliferation within the human genome.
Therefore, the authors concluded that most of the human
GUSB pseudogenes have arisen from involvement of AluAlu recombination [23]. As the porcine GUSB contains
only few SINEs in its 5' region and since we found no evidence for unprocessed GUSB pseudogenes within the pig
genome during screening of the genomic PAC library our
results support their hypothesis.
SNP analysis
After screening all of the 12 GUSB exons with the adjacent
intron junctions a total of five SNPs located in exons 5, 6,
and 7 as well as in introns 3 and 8 were discovered. At
positions 1,044 (exon 6) and 1,227 (exon 7) each (numbering refers to predicted CDS) thymine is substituted by

cytosine, but both substitutions do not lead to an
exchange of the encoded amino acid. The transition of
guanine to adenine at position 805 (exon 5), however,
changes the encoded amino acid from valine to methionine. Additionally two SNPs in intron 3 (T → C) and in
intron 8 (C → T) were detected, but both of them do not
alter splice motifs.
The 512 animals of the half-sib pedigree were genotyped
for the three SNPs in exons 5, 6, and 7. Test assays used for
genotyping and resulting allele frequencies for each of the
SNPs are given in Table 3. The SNP in exon 7 was excluded
from further analyses, because of the uneven allele frequency distribution with a minor allele frequency of
0.0013.
Association analysis for GUSB-SNPs
TDT was applied to the SNPs in exons 5 and 6 to test
simultaneously for association and linkage with congenital inguinal hernia. TDT analyses gave p-values of 0.229
and 0.195 for the SNPs in exon 5 and exon 6, respectively.
Therefore, no significant association between the allelic
variants and the disease outcome was detected.

Conclusion
All twelve exons of the porcine GUSB gene were screened
for SNPs to evaluate a possible contribution of the gene in
the inheritance of hernia. No structural mutation that significantly alters structure of the protein has been detected.
In order to evaluate if so far undetected causative mutations that lie in linkage disequilibrium with one of the
detected SNPs may contribute to the disease outcome a
straightforward SNP-based association analyses was conducted. No association was found for the two tested SNPs.
Nevertheless it is well recognized that especially for complex diseases common association analyses in which only
one gene is tested at a time might reduce the chance to
identify disease susceptibility genes with relatively small

effect sizes [24]. Therefore, continued finemapping and
combined association analysis of candidate genes within
all disease-linked chromosomal regions should shed further light on the contribution of single genes to the outcome of inguinal and scrotal hernia in pigs.

Methods
Animals and sampling
Blood, tissue and sperm specimen were collected on pig
farms selected by different German pig breeding organisations. Before sampling, farmers reported affected animals
and the hernia phenotype was proven with palpation
done by veterinarians. Several additional data were
recorded like position of hernia (left-sided or right-sided),
number of the respective litter, date of birth. Collection of
affected animals including their non-affected parents is
still continuing and up to now a total of 1710 animals
have been collected for the DNA repository. The affected
piglets are crossbreds of the founder breeds Pietrain, Large
White, Hampshire, and German Landrace. For this study,
275 affected piglets and their non-affected parents (84
boars and 153 sows) were taken. The pedigree consisted
therefore of 84 boar families, each of them contains at
least one affected sib pair which, if available, were completed with affected half sibs. Unaffected sibs of herniated
pigs have not been collected. The size of a family ranged
from a minimum of four individuals (an affected sib pair
plus parents) up to a complex design with 22 individuals
(five affected sib pairs and eight affected half sibs including the parents) for the largest family.
Linkage analyses
The pedigree was genotyped for 13 microsatellite markers
distributed evenly across chromosome 3. Markers and the
genetic distances were taken from the published MARC
U.S. Department of Agriculture map [25]. Primers used
for genotyping of the 13 microsatellites on SSC3 are given
in Table 4. PCR was done using puReTaq Ready-To-Go

PCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany), reactions contained 100 ng genomic DNA and 1050 pmol of each primer. For each reaction one of the
primers was end-labelled with 6-FAM, JOE, NED or HEX
and analysis of PCR-fragments was performed on an ABI
Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Results of fragment analysis were evaluated using Genescan version 3.7 and Genotyper version
3.6 (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany).
Information content of markers, singlepoint and
multipoint nonparametric linkage scores (NPL) were calculated using the program package Allegro 1.0 [26]. NPL
≥ 1.96 and p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as significant.
TDT analyses
Transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) [27] was conducted using the program GASSOC [28]. A p-value of 0.05
was considered as significance limit.
PAC clone isolation and characterization
Isolation of a porcine PAC clone containing the GUSB
gene from the library TAIGP714Q [29] was performed as
described elsewhere [15]. The insert-size of the PAC clone
(TAIGP714N09100Q) was determined by cleavage with
NotI and separation of the fragments by pulsed field gel
electrophoresis (CHEF-DR II; Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) on a 0.8% agarose gel.
Subcloning and sequencing
The PAC clone was digested by appropriate restriction
endonucleases, and the positive fragments were subcloned into pGEM-4Z (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany)
polylinker after southern blotting and hybridization with
a GUSB gene specific probe. Recombinant plasmids were
used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue (Promega, Mannheim,
Germany). If necessary the obtained fragments were further subcloned after enzymatic digestion. Purified plasmid DNA were bidirectionally sequenced using the ABI
Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) and M13fw/M13rv
(5'-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3'/5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3') primers. Remaining sequence
gaps were closed by either primerwalking or by subcloning and sequencing of PCR fragments after long range
PCR. Primerwalking was performed using 800 ng of PACDNA as template. Primers used for primerwalking are
specified in Table 5a. Long range PCR was conducted
using the Expand 20 kbPlus PCR System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 50 ng of PAC-DNA and 10 pmol of
each primer specified in Table 5b. Cycling conditions
were 92°C for 2 min as initial denaturation, 11 cycles with
92°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 68°C for 8 min followed by additional 21 cycles with the same profile but
with a time-increment of 10 sec per cycle, final elongation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/2/14

was 4 min at 68°C. All fragments were purified using
QIAquick PCR purification columns (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany) and cloned in the pGEM-T Vector System
(Promega, Mannheim, Germany) for sequencing and further subcloning. All sequencing reactions were analyzed
using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Sequence data were evaluated and overlapping contigs were generated using the
software Sequencher™ 4.1 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, USA).
Contigs were generated out of at least two independent
subclones and/or PCR-products. The consensus sequence
is build of plus and minus strand information.
Bioinformatical sequence analysis
BLAST searches were conducted to identify orthologous
sequence regions between species [30]. Repetitive
sequences were identified, masked, and annotated with
RepeatMasker [31] CpG islands were detected with CpG
plot [32] using a 200-bp window and a minimum length
of 200 bp. The threshold values for CpG islands were
CpGobs/CpGexp > 0.6 and GC > 0.5.
PCR conditions
All applied PCR reactions were done in compliance with
the following set-up unless otherwise indicated: 50 ng of
template DNA, 200 µM of each dNTP, 0.4 µM of each
primer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1.5 U of Taq-polymerase in
1x buffer as recommended by the manufacturer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) in a total reaction volume of 25
µl.
SNP discovery
To screen the GUSB exons and adjacent intron sequences
(Table 5c) for the existence of SNPs, a direct sequencing
approach was conducted. DNA from 15 unrelated herniated piglets from the pedigree described before and from
10 unrelated artificial insemination boars of different
breeds (7x Pietrain, 2x German Landrace and 1x Large
White) without any known herniated progeny was used in
the comparative sequencing approach. The primer pairs
specified in Table 5c were generated to amplify each exon
separately. PCR amplifications were done with an initial
denaturation step at 94°C for 4 min, followed by 30
cycles with 30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at the primer specific
annealing temperature and 30 sec at 72°C, followed by a
final elongation for 4 min at 72°C. PCR products were
sequenced directly as described above. Multiple sequence
comparisons to evaluate SNPs were done with Sequencher
4.1 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, USA).
SNP genotyping by PCR-RFLP
For SNP genotyping PCR-RFLP tests were developed for
the two SNPs located in exon 6 and 7. RFLP reactions were
performed on 10 µl of PCR-sample using 1.5 U of the
respective restriction enzyme (Table 3) in a total reaction

Biozym, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany) in a total reaction
volume of 25 µl. The primers EX5outer.f and EX5outer.r
were end-labelled with 6-FAM and analysis of PCR-fragments was performed on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Results of fragment analysis were evaluated using
Genotyper version 3.6 (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt,
Germany).
