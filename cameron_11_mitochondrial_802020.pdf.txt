Mitochondrial genome deletions and minicircles
are common in lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera)

Abstract
Background: The gene composition, gene order and structure of the mitochondrial genome are remarkably stable
across bilaterian animals. Lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) are a major exception to this genomic stability in that the
canonical single chromosome with 37 genes found in almost all other bilaterians has been lost in multiple lineages
in favour of multiple, minicircular chromosomes with less than 37 genes on each chromosome.
Results: Minicircular mt genomes are found in six of the ten louse species examined to date and three types of
minicircles were identified: heteroplasmic minicircles which coexist with full sized mt genomes (type 1); multigene
chromosomes with short, simple control regions, we infer that the genome consists of several such chromosomes
(type 2); and multiple, single to three gene chromosomes with large, complex control regions (type 3). Mapping
minicircle types onto a phylogenetic tree of lice fails to show a pattern of their occurrence consistent with an
evolutionary series of minicircle types. Analysis of the nuclear-encoded, mitochondrially-targetted genes inferred
from the body louse, Pediculus, suggests that the loss of mitochondrial single-stranded binding protein (mtSSB)
may be responsible for the presence of minicircles in at least species with the most derived type 3 minicircles
(Pediculus, Damalinia).
Conclusions: Minicircular mt genomes are common in lice and appear to have arisen multiple times within the
group. Life history adaptive explanations which attribute minicircular mt genomes in lice to the adoption of bloodfeeding in the Anoplura are not supported by this expanded data set as minicircles are found in multiple nonblood feeding louse groups but are not found in the blood-feeding genus Heterodoxus. In contrast, a mechanist
explanation based on the loss of mtSSB suggests that minicircles may be selectively favoured due to the incapacity
of the mt replisome to synthesize long replicative products without mtSSB and thus the loss of this gene lead to
the formation of minicircles in lice.

Background
The gene content, order and structure of bilaterian mitochondrial (mt) genomes are amongst the most stable
genomic systems known. Gene content within bilaterians,
with few exceptions, consists of 37 genes, 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and 22
transfer RNAs (tRNAs). This gene content is stable
across 32 phyla, representing 78% of life and 555 million
years of evolution. The exceptions such as the loss of the
smallest PCG in higher nematodes [1] and of tRNAs in
some mites (e.g. [2]), affect only genes which are physically small and these losses are confined to groups

representing a small portion of the bilaterian diversity
[3]. Gene order is variable but in several instances an
ancestral arrangement is shared by the majority of
species in enormous groups such as the Superphylum
Ecdysozoa (arthropods, velvet worms and priapulids) and
for the chordates including most vertebrates [4-7]. Again
exceptions such as the highly rearranged mt genomes of
lice [8] and wasps [9] within arthropods or those of
plethodontid salamanders within vertebrates [10] are
comparatively rare and confined to relatively derived portions of each group. Mt genome structure within bilateria
is almost universally a single circular genome although it
is more variable in lower metazoa and protists [11-13].
This great stability of gene content, arrangement and
structure across such an enormous age and diversity of
life suggests strong stabilizing selection for an optimal

bilaterian mt genome. The few animal groups which
diverge from this pattern are thus of particular utility for
investigating the potential causes of this near-universal
genomic stability.
Recently, two studies have independently reported the
most marked departures from this general pattern of mt
genomic stability within bilateria found to date: the break
up of the canonical single chromosome mt genome into
multi-chromosome, minicircular mt genomes. Gibson
et al. [14,15] reported that the mt genome of the root
parasitic nematode Globodera and near relatives was
spread over six minicircular chromosomes. Each chromosome had between 2 and 19 genes, with several of the
PCGs occurring on multiple chromosomes with evidence
for modest nucleotide divergences between these different
chromosome copies. Collectively the canonical set of
37 mt genes was present although no single chromosome
contained all of the genes. Thus Gibson et al. [14]
described the mt genome of Globodera to be a mosaic
spread across the different chromosomes. A more extreme
example was reported by Shao et al. [16] from the human
body louse, Pediculus in which the mt genome was spread
over at least 18 minicircular chromosomes, each containing one to three genes plus a large non-coding region containing sequence blocks that were highly conserved
between different chromosomes. Again the canonical
37 mt genes were collectively present across the set of
18 mt chromosomes; however there was no evidence for a
full-sized chromosome which contained all 37 genes in
Pediculus or its close relatives.
The finding of multi-chromosomal, minicircular mt
genomes in these groups is even more remarkable when
compared against our growing knowledge of mt diseases
in humans [17]. A wide range of human diseases have
been found to result from the deletion of portions of
the mt genome a state termed ΔmtDNA. ΔmtDNA is
caused by either mutations within the mt genome itself
or defective versions of the nuclear encoded mtgenome
maintenance genes [18-21]. The progressive loss of mt
function due to ΔmtDNA mutations has also been
hypothesized as the ultimate cause of aging: the mitochondrial theory of aging [22,23]. However, whether
these mutations are sufficiently severe to cause the
range of aging effects has been questioned [24]. Models
of human mt disorders have been identified from
screens of Drosophila mutants lacking or differing in the
same replication and nucleotide transport proteins [25],
highlighting the fact that these systems have been maintained over large evolutionary distances and are likely
shared across bilaterians. The replacement of the canonical mt genome structure in Pediculus and Globodera
with a putatively “pathological” structure as their standard suggests a major departure from these common mt
genome maintenance pathways. Accordingly, further

investigation of mt genome evolution within these
groups could well shed light on the forces shaping stabilizing selection on animal mt genome structure in
general.
The mt genomes of lice (Insecta: Psocodea: Phthiraptera) are known to be highly rearranged [8,26,27] and the
finding of multi-chromosomal, minicircular mt genomes
within Pediculus thus must be considered within this
context. Recent phylogenetic analyses of lice suggest that
the sucking lice (Suborder Anoplura), of which Pediculus
is a representative, may be derived from within the
largest of the three chewing louse suborders, the Ischnocera [28-31]. To date mt genomes are available for just
two ischnoceran lice, Campanulotes [27] and Bothriometopus [8] and neither study reports evidence for multichromosomal or minicircular genomes. This study thus
had three aims:
1) conduct a broader survey of ischnoceran lice for the
presence of minicircular mt genomes;
2) compare genome structure to the evolutionary history of lice; and,
3) mine the recently published nuclear genome of
Pediculus for nuclear-encoded, mitochondrially-targeted
(ne-mt) genes to test if intrinsic factors in their genetic
background might be responsible for the minicircularisation of louse mt genomes.

Results
Mini-circles are common in lice

Mt genomes from representatives of six ischnoceran genera were sequenced for this study representing the three
most widely accepted ischnoceran families: Philopteridae
(Ibidoecus, Anaticola, Philopterus and Quadraceps),
Goniodidae (Coloceras) and Trichodectidae (Damalinia).
Complete mt genome sequences including all protein-coding, rRNA and tRNA genes were determined for Ibidoecus
(14,908 bp, GenBank accession number: JN122005) and
Coloceras (14,868 bp; JN122000) (Figure 1). Multigene,
minicircular genomes including only a subset of the canonical 37 mt genes were sequenced from Anaticola (8118
bp, 18 full length genes; JN121999), Philopterus (3721 bp,
six genes; JN122006), Quadraceps (2553bp, six genes;
JN21998) and Coloceras (7649 bp, 22 full and two partial
genes; JN122001) in addition to the full sized mt genome
found in Coloceras (Figure 2). Three minicircular genomes
each including only a single protein coding or rRNA gene
plus one tRNA gene were found in Damalinia (2079,
2083, 2306 bp; JN122002, JN122003, JN122004) (Figure 2).
Complete details of the sequencing strategies followed
to sequence each mt genome are provided in Additional
File 1.
The minicircular genomes found in this study fall into
three different categories. The Coloceras minicircle is one
of two heteroplasmic genome types present in this

individual louse and has been generated by the deletion of
approximately half the mt genome (7218bp covering seven
tRNAs, six full length PCGs and portions of two additional
PCGs). Heteroplasmy here is used to describe the existence of multiple genome types, not sequence divergences
between homologous genes found on different chromosomes as this was not observed in Coloceras. The deletion
occurs between two poly-T regions, a stretch of 28 T’s
from bases 710 to 737 in cob and of 19 T’s from bases
1256 to 1274 in nad4. Similar deletions within protein
coding genes were detected from Pediculus due to recombination between regions of sequence homology however
the recombination sites were not homopolymer stretches
[32]. The deletion in the Coloceras mt genome was

consistently detected by amplifications spanning the
deleted region; multiple independent primer pairs producing the same result with the shortest using primers 325
bp upstream and 73 bp downstream respectively of the
deletion producing a 398 bp product in place of the
expected 7600 bp product. Long poly-T stretches are common in the Coloceras mt genome. In addition to the two
poly-T stretches associated with the deletion there are 23
other poly-T stretches of 10+ bases occurring in eight of
the 13 PCGs, in trnT and in the major non-coding region
(= putative control region). Such long mononucleotide
repeats are uncommon in the coding regions of other
insects where they are largely confined to the control
region. Given this large number of repeats between which

deletions could potentially occur, it is perhaps surprising
that only a single minicircle type was found. That this single type was found from multiple different PCR primer
combinations with varying conditions also argues against
it being a PCR artifact caused by polymerase slippage
between poly-T regions.

A second minicircle type is found in Anaticola,
Philopterus and Quadraceps. In each of these species
we were unable to find a full sized mt genome which
included all 37 genes. Unlike in the Coloceras minicircle, all genes found on these genomes are full length
and there are no mononucleotide stretches of more

Cameron et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:394
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/394

than eight bases. Anaticola and Philopterus each have
a large non-coding region, 232 and 138 bp respectively,
which may function as a control region however the
identification of such regions in lice has been problematic as they lack the conserved regions found in
most other insects. It thus seems likely that these
minicircles are not the result of recent, in evolutionary
timescales, deletions from a full sized mt genome as in
Coloceras. We were able to amplify two additional mt
genes from two of these species, Philopterus and
Quadraceps, but unable to link them by long PCR to
any of the genes on the minicircles suggesting that the
mt genome of these species is now functionally multichromosomal. We have, however, not been able to
successfully amplify the mt chromosomes on which
these genes occur and so we can only infer, rather
than demonstrate, a multi-chromosomal mt genome
for these species. Multiple primer combinations were
used to attempt to amplify the missing genes from
each of the species both within individual genes by
short PCRs and between genes by long PCRs however
we were not able to amplify additional chromosomes
from these three species. Next-generation sequencing
methods which are not reliant on PCR amplification
hold promise in completing these genomes; however,
we were not in a position to attempt this as part of
the current study. Indeed, next-gen sequencing was the
key to completing the sequencing of the multi-partite
Pediculus mt genome [16] as prior to the nuclear genome sequencing project [33], only two mt genes had
been successfully sequenced from this species [27].
The third minicircle type was found in Damalinia and
is very similar to that previously reported from Pediculus by Shao et al. [16]. Each of the three minicircles
found in Damalinia consists of a single PCG or rRNA,
a single tRNA and a large non-coding region which displays shared motifs between copies on different minicircles. The non-coding regions are 694bp (cox1 containing
minicircle), 846bp (rrnL containing minicircle) and
1089bp (rrnS containing minicircle) long; most of the
length differences are due to macrorepeats which vary
in number between different chromosomes. The noncoding portion of the genome consists of conserved
regions broken up by macrorepeats (Figure 3). The first
conserved region, immediately downstream of the coding regions, consists of approx. 150 bp and includes a
large hair-pin loop which may function as an origin of
replication. This is followed by a less conserved region
of 250 bp which is repeated in the rrnS minicircle. The
third region is another conserved sequence block 142
bp long in the rrnS minicircle but longer in the rrnL
and cox1 minicircles due to the presence of two different repeats 53 and 67bp long respectively. The fourth
region of 75 bp in the cox1 minicircle is also conserved

Page 5 of 15

however there are additional highly divergent regions of
171 and 220 bp each in the rrnL and rrnS minicircles
respectively. The overall minicircle structure in Damalinia, a small number of genes plus a very large noncoding region composed of regions highly conserved
between different minicircles, is very similar to that previously reported for Pediculus. If the remainder of the
Damalinia mt genome has the same structure there
could be 12 or more additional minicircles each with a
single protein-coding gene and one or more tRNAs.
Genome Annotations & Evolutionary Trends

Gene order maps for the six ischnoceran species in this
study are included in Figures 1 & 2. Gene order within
the full sized Coloceras mt genome is almost identical to
that of Campanulotes in that they differ by a single
tRNA translocation of trnQ; these are the first two louse
genera to be examined which share more than a handful
of plesiomorphic gene boundaries that are common
across all insect orders. Additionally, Coloceras and
Campanulotes share the derived arrangement trnN-trnE
with Pediculus but no other louse genera. Ibidoecus
shares none of the plesiomorphic gene boundaries
found in other insects and lacks even the four identified
in other lice: atp8-atp6 found in Heterodoxus, Campanulotes, Coloceras and Bothriometopus; trnG-nad3 found
in Campanulotes, Coloceras and Bothriometopus; nad4trnH-nad5 found in Bothriometopus; and nad4L-nad4
found in Heterodoxus. In contrast Ibidoecus shares several derived gene boundaries with other lice: trnY-cox2
is shared with Heterodoxus, Bothriometopus and Pediculus; trnA-trnG are shared with Campanulotes and Coloceras; trnF-nad6 is shared with Campanulotes, Coloceras
and Pediculus and with slight modification with Bothriometopus (trnF-trnD-nad6) and Anaticola (trnF-trnGnad6); trnS-trnW is shared with Bothriometopus and
Pediculus; trnL-cob are shared with Bothriometopus and
trnI-cox1 is shared with all ischnoceran lice except
Bothriometopus.
The number of missing genes creates some uncertainty
about the rearrangement patterns within the partial,
minicircular mt genomes. However, none of the four species included here possess any of the plesiomorphic gene
boundaries found across insects. Three of these species,
Anaticola, Philopterus, and Damalinia, share the widespread derived gene boundary trnI-cox1. Anaticola shares
the derived boundary trnK-nad4 with Bothriometopus
and Pediculus although it has three copies of trnK and it
is unclear which of these copies is homologous and
which are duplicates. Philopterus shares trnM-rrnS and
rrnL-trnW with Campanulotes, Coloceras and Quadraceps and rrnS-rrnL with Quadraceps and Heterodoxus.
This rearrangement is, however, sufficiently similar to
the insect plesiomorphic arrangement rrnS-trnV-rrnL as

to be conceivably the product of convergent translocations of trnV out of this position occurring independently
in each lineage.
Shared, derived gene boundaries were mapped onto a
phylogenetic tree of the louse genera for which mtgenome data is available, either parsimoniously (Figure 4A),
i.e. minimum number of inferred gene translocations
even if that infers multiple independent origins of a given
gene boundary, or with a single origin for each derived
boundary and multiple losses (Figure 4B) (Figure 4 is a
pruned copy of the tree in Additional file 2, and is
reduced to just taxa for which mt genome data is available). The very closely related goniodid genera Coloceras
and Campanulotes which have almost identical mt genome arrangements share 34 derived boundaries, however
27 of these are not present in any other genus and aren’t
considered further. There are 11 derived gene boundaries
which are shared by at least two louse genera or the

goniodids plus at least one other louse (marked A - K,
Figures 1, 2 & 4). Two of these, rrnl-trnW (derived gene
boundary F) and trnM-rrnS (boundary H) are synapomorphic for the clade ((Coloceras + Campanulotes) +
(Quadraceps + Philopterus)) and are present in all members of that clade without secondary modification or loss.
Five derived boundaries (A, C, E, I, J) are interpreted as
synapomorphic for various clades under both character
mapping schemes, but have been secondarily lost or are
unknown in some members of that clade because the
partial genomes available for some genera lack both
genes. Another four derived boundaries (B, D, G, K) are
most parsimoniously interpreted as having evolved convergently in two different genera or clades. However, a
single origin optimization for these boundaries requires
respectively, one loss and two unknown states (K), or two
independent losses (B, D and G, with zero, two and three
unknown states respectively).

Mapping genome reductions onto the same tree (Figure
4B) suggests that there is limited evolutionary pattern to
the presence of mtgenome minicircles in different louse
groups. Type 1 minicircles, heteroplasmic genome reductions from a full sized mtgenome, are confined to the
Goniodidae. Type 2 minicircular mtgenomes were found
in two different lineages, Quadraceps+Philopterus and
Anaticola. Due to the polytomy between Bothriometopus,
Damalinia and Pediculus, type 3 multichromosomal mtgenomes were not inferred to have a single evolutionary origin despite previous louse phylogenies strongly supporting
the monophyly of Damalinia+Pediculus [31] which would
suggest a single origin for type 3 minicircles.
Nuclear Encoded - Mitochondria Targeted Genes of Lice

We initially conducted an annotation of the Pediculus
humanus ne-mt genes for the Human Body Louse Genome consortium [33] but a fuller discussion of these
results follows here. The set of nuclear-encoded, mitochondrially targeted (ne-mt) genes identified from Drosophila consists of 315 genes. Reciprocal best blast matches
were identified in the Pediculus nuclear genome for 295
(93.6%) of these genes with 68 of the 74 (91.9%) oxydative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, 86/87 (98.9%) other
metabolic genes, 108/113 (95.6%) protein synthesis genes,
12/15 (80%) DNA synthesis genes, 19/22 (86.4%) transport
and cell rescue genes and 2/4 (50%) of the miscellaneous
function genes. A table of the annotated genes, their blast

and alignment similarity statistics are included in Additional File 3. The numbers of OXPHOS [34-37] and
protein synthesis homologues [38] identified from Pediculus are comparable to those identified in other insect genome projects. These two subsets are the best studied of
the ne-mt genes and represent 59.4% of the mitochondrial
gene set. In contrast the DNA synthesis set of Pediculus
apparently lacks mitochondrial single stranded binding
protein (mtSSB), a core member of the mtDNA replisome
and has a reduced set of mitochondrial transcription termination factors with only two of the four genes found in
Drosophila.
Studies of human mt diseases have demonstrated that
two classes of disorders will result in mt genome deletions
causing minicircles similar to those found in Pediculus
and Damalinia: 1) defects in nucleotide translocator proteins; and 2) defects in any of the mtDNA replicative
enzymes [39-41]. Defects in the nucleotide translocator
proteins cause imbalances in the intramitochondrial
nucleotide pool and so result in a reduction in the rate
and accuracy of mtDNA replication. Each of the three
nucleotide translocator genes implicated in mtDNA deletions, ADP/ATP carrier protein (= adenine nucleotide
translocator 1), deoxynucleoside kinase and ADP-forming
succinyl-CoA synthetase, had homologues in Pediculus
with very high to almost perfect levels of amino acid conservation across insects. There is thus no reason to suppose that the nucleotide translocators are functioning

Cameron et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:394
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/394

abnormally in Pediculus, suggesting that nucleotide imbalances are not the cause of mtDNA minicircles. Of the four
core enzymes responsible for mtDNA replication, the
replicative helicase Twinkle and DNA polymerase gA
(POLGA) are similar to homologues in Drosophila, DNA
polymerase gB (POLGB) is quite divergent and mitochondrial-specific single-stranded binding protein (mtSSB) is
apparently absent. Twinkle in Pediculus is moderately
divergent from that found in Drosophila with limited
amino-acid identity through the N-terminal primase
domain; of the six conserved motifs only motifs 1 (zinc
finger motif), 4 (b-sheet 10, a-helix 3), 5 (b12, a6), and 6
(b13, a7) are conserved. There is much greater similarity
in the central linker and C-terminal helicase domains; all
of the five conserved motifs in the helicase domain are
extremely conserved with the majority of residues identical
and most of the remaining ones structurally similar (the
structural model of Twinkle follows [19] and [42]).
POLGA in Pediculus has a similar structure as in other
metazoans; the N-terminal exonuclease (exo) domain has
moderate similarity to other insects; the C-terminal polymerase (pol) and central linker domains are highly conserved and each of three active sites in both the exo and
pol domains are highly conserved across insects (model
following [43]). In contrast POLGB in Pediculus is highly
divergent from that of other insects, lacking much of the
N-terminal domain including the helix-loop-helix and leucine-zipper motifs, the central M-domain has limited similar to other insects however the C-terminal domain is
highly conserved (model following [44]). This suggests
that a minimal mt replisome consisting of a DNA-polymerase (POLG holoenzyme) plus a helicase (Twinkle) is
present in Pediculus, however, the absence of mtSSB is
unique amongst sequenced insects.

Discussion
Mt genome rearrangements in Lice

As in all previous studies of lice [8,26,27] all of the mt genomes sequenced for the present study were highly rearranged relative to the inferred ancestral mt genome of
insects. Mt genomes from different louse species are also
highly rearranged relative to each other. One hundred and
seventy two derived gene boundaries are found in the six
complete and four minicircular mt genomes sequenced
from lice to date (see Additional file 4 for complete list),
dwarfing the 12 plesiomorphic gene boundaries which
have been retained from the ancestral insect. This pattern
is also reflected in every louse species examined where the
numbers of derived boundaries is high compared to the
number of plesiomorphic boundaries which range from a
maximum of five plesiomorphic boundaries in Bothriometopus down to a minimum of none in Ibidoecus. This confirms earlier claims that lice possess the most rearranged
mt genomes amongst the arthropods and are amongst the

Page 8 of 15

most rearranged of all animals [26]. The 172 derived gene
boundaries are made up of 161 unique gene boundaries
found only in a single species, plus 11 shared derived
boundaries which occur a total of 31 times across the
examined louse species. These ratios are comparable to
those found for rearrangements within Hymenoptera
where of 67 rearrangements found in the order, 60 were
unique to a single wasp species [9].
The present study is the first to find derived gene
arrangements that are shared between distantly related
louse species. The conserved rearrangements between
the two goniodid genera, Coloceras and Campanulotes
confirms the finding of Covacin et al. [27], based on partial genome sequences, that derived gene arrangements
are shared at shallow phylogenetic levels within lice.
More interestingly, we find the first evidence for shared,
derived rearrangements which delimit much higher level
groups within the lice e.g. trnI-cox1 which appears to be
synapomorphic for the Ischnocera although it has been
lost in Bothriometopus and in the Anoplura; or rrnLtrnW and trnM-rrnS which define a clade consisting of
the Goniodidae + (Quadraceps+Philopterus). Our finding
of synapomorphic gene rearrangements within lice is in
line with data from other insect orders including Hymenoptera [9,45], Neuroptera [46], Lepidoptera [47],
Orthoptera [48,49] and Hemiptera [50], suggesting that
rearrangements, when present, are often synapomorphic
for major groups within each order. Lice however differ
from all other insect orders in the almost complete
absence of plesiomorphic gene boundaries as noted
above. In contrast, all of the other insect orders cited
above except Hymenoptera have only a single derived
rearrangement with the remainder of the genome sharing
the arrangement of the ancestral insect. Even the most
rearranged hymenopteran mt genomes, those of Bombus
and Apis, have only seven derived rearrangements with
the rest of the genome in the ancestral arrangement
[9,51].
Minicircles in Lice

The present study shows that mitochondrial minicircles
are common in lice being found in six of the ten louse
species which have been studied to date. Furthermore,
they are evolutionarily widespread within lice with representatives of all three ischonceran families plus the Anoplura possessing minicircular mt genomes. Minicircles
have yet to be reported from the other major louse suborder, Amblycera. However little effort has yet been
directed towards this group with just one genome
sequenced (Heterodoxus) versus nine from Ischnocera.
We have also identified two additional types of minicircles that could represent intermediate steps between the
canonical single chromosome mt genomes found in
almost all bilaterians and the small, multichromosomal

Cameron et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:394
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/394

mt genomes found in sucking lice [16]. While it is tempting to see these two additional minicircles types as an
evolutionary series leading to the multichromosomal type
3 minicircle, phylogenetic mapping of the minicircle
types simply doesn’t support such an interpretation
(Figure 4a). The three minicircle types do not form a
nested series within the tree and the plesiomorphic, full
sized genome is found throughout the tree rather than
being confined to some paraphyletic assemblage including the outgroup.
The type 1 minicircles, heteroplasmic genome reductions from a full sized mt genome, are confined to the
Goniodidae but however likely represent the first step
towards mt genome size reduction. This minicircle type
is similar to the ΔmtDNA state found widely in animals
and similar mechanisms of DNA deletion could generate
the heteroplasmic mt genome variants seen within the
Goniodidae. As noted by Shao et al. [16], it is highly unlikely that the much more derived minicircle type seen in
Pediculus evolved from a “big bang” which fragmented a
full-sized mt genome into 18 minicircular chromosomes
in a single event. A first intermediate step resembling the
heteroplasmic mt genomes seen in Coloceras is much
more likely even though it is clear that goniodids are not
the ancestors of all other ischnoceran lice. Such heteroplasmic genome reductions, however, could not lead to
the other minicircles types described here unless multiple
independent deletions from the full sized mt genome
resulted in a set of mt chromosomes which collectively
covered all 37 mt genes, similar to the set of mt chromosomes found in Globodera [14,15]. Our available data
suggests that there is just one ΔmtDNA chromosome
within the Coloceras specimens examined. It is also
unknown whether the smaller mt genome type found in
Coloceras is part of the germ line or if the deletion has
occurred within the life span of the louse. Examination of
additional specimens could shed light on how widely this
particular minicircle is found within this species. Human,
nematode and Drosophila examples of ΔmtDNA, while
not germline, are however, generated in a consistent fashion by deletions between repetitive regions [52-55], suggesting that testing between germline and age-related mt
degeneration in goniodids will require targeted sequencing of eggs or early instar nymphs. In addition, further
study is required to verify if louse species from which full
sized genomes have been reported such as Bothriometopus and Ibidoecus do not also possess type 1 minicircles
and if so what the relative balance of genomes types are
within different species. The mt genome of Bothriometopus possesses multiple repetitive elements including both
duplicated tRNAs and non-coding regions which could
delimit deletion regions [8].
Type 2 minicircles, genomes with several full length
major genes (PCGs or rRNA) but no evidence of a full

Page 9 of 15

sized genome, would form the logical missing link
between the heteroplasmic type 1 minicircles and the
fully reduced type 3 minicircles. The type 2 minicircles
that we found most closely resembled the minicircles
reported from the nematode Globodera [14,15]; however, they differ in several respects. Unlike in Globodera
we were unable to demonstrate multiple chromosomes.
However, our failure to link other mt genes to the finished minicircles suggests the presence of other chromosomes. We also did not find evidence for a mosaic
genome with the same gene being found on multiple
chromosomes as slight sequence variants as was found
in Globodera. Type 2 minicircles were also the most
widespread minicircle type found in lice occurring in
two different clades within the Ischnocera (Figure 4a)
which would explain the difficulties which we have
encountered trying to amplify louse mt genomes via the
traditional long PCR approach. It is our prediction that
further surveys will find type 2 minicircles to occur
widely within the Ischnocera. However, experimental
efforts must be made in each instance to exclude the
possibility of apparently type 2 minicircles actually being
type 1 minicircles i.e. that a full size mt genome is also
present.
The type 3 minicircles (multichromosomal mt genomes
with one major gene and a large, conserved non-coding
region on each chromosome) are confined to the Anoplura and the Trichodectidae, which are now strongly
supported on both morphological and molecular grounds
to form a sister-group [31]. The difference between type
2 and type 3 minicircles is largely one of scale: several
major genes are present in type 2 but not more than one
major gene in type 3 minicircles; the number of tRNAs
present in each type is variable but usually more are present in type 2 minicircles (three+ in each studied type 2
minicircle, not more than three in type 3 minicircles);
and short non-coding regions without conserved
sequence blocks in type 2 versus longer non-coding
regions with several conserved sequence blocks in type 3.
Additional studies may reveal that type 2 and type 3
minicircles are simply arbitrary points on a continuum of
reduced mt chromosome sizes, but given available data,
it is convenient to treat them separately at this time. The
high degree of sequence conservation within the noncoding regions of each species is likely due to concerted
evolution mediated by intramitochondrial recombination
[56], and indeed Shao & Barker [32] report chimeric
mitochondrial genomes in Pediculus composed of the
fusion of two minicircles at the non-coding regions. The
conserved sequence blocks mediate homologous recombination between different mitochondrial chromosomes
[32]. The non-coding regions of Pediculus and Damalinia mt minicircles show a high degree of structural similarity. There are moderate differences in the sequence of

Cameron et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:394
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/394

the non-coding region cloned from different chromosomes in each species, however, the entire non-coding
region is readily alignable within each species. In both
species, the non-coding region has three conserved
sequence blocks located at the beginning, middle, and
end of the non-coding region. There are also differences
between non-coding regions from the two species. Unlike
Pediculus, the non-coding regions of Damalinia mt minicircles are much smaller, ranging in length from 694 to
1098 bp vs 1643 to 2050 bp long in Pediculus. The location of a putative stem-loop structure differs in being
located within conserved block 1 of Damalinia as contrasted to conserved block 2 of Pediculus. Pediculus lacks
the macro-repeat regions that account for much of the
variability between the non-conserved regions from different Damalinia chromosomes. Finally, there is very
limited sequence conservation between the two species,
even between the corresponding conserved regions. The
other remarkable characteristic of the non-coding regions
of these two species is that they are substantially larger
than any of the non-coding regions reported from other
louse mt genomes. These range in size from 48 bp in
Coloceras to 284bp in Bothriometopus, whereas the smallest non-coding region in Damalinia is 694 bp from the
trnI-cox1 chromosome and in Pediculus is 1643 bp for
one of the nad5 chromosomes. The non-coding regions
of Damalinia and Pediculus mt genomes are much closer
in size to those found in many other insect orders which
retain both the insect ancestral genome arrangements
and the canonical single mt chromosome structure. The
nine clones of non-coding regions from Pediculus minicircles that were fully sequenced are all larger than the
coding regions on their respective chromosomes [16].
While the size of the non-coding region has not been
determined for all 18 mt chromosomes identified in Pediculus, the sequence conservation between non-coding
regions suggests that they will all be 1600bp plus in size
and potentially many times larger than many of the coding regions, which were as small as 65bp for one chromosome that contains only a single tRNA gene. It seems
counter intuitive that whatever evolutionary forces may
have been driving lice towards smaller, minicircular mt
genomes has also driven a large expansion in the size of
the non-coding regions. Many additional mt genomes
from this group will need to be investigated to determine
if there truly is a trend toward size increases in the noncoding regions of lice with type 3 minicircular mt genomes and what, if any, function these bloated non-coding
regions serve in genome maintenance, replication, or
transcription.
Factors Leading to Mitochondrial Minicircles in Lice

Given that minicircularized mitochondrial chromosomes
are very rare across the diversity of life, it is interesting

Page 10 of 15

to consider what factors may have given rise to their
evolution. Shao et al. [16] proposed that the evolution
of minicircular mt genomes coevolved with blood-feeding in the sucking lice (Anoplura). However this hypothesis is contradicted by the available mt genome data.
Minicircular mt genomes within lice are not confined to
blood-feeding taxa being also found in four of the seven
philopterid genera studied which are all feather-feeding
[57] and in the trichodectid Damalinia which is skinfeeding [58]. Furthermore, minicircular mt genomes are
not found in other blood-feeding lice such as the boopiid Heterodoxus [26], or in other blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes [59], reduviid bugs [60], or
ticks [61], or in other blood-feeding animals such as
leeches (Wu et al. unpublished data). Within insects,
minicircular mt genomes are confined to lice and the
specific minicircular mt genome type documented in
[16] is confined to a clade minimally consisting of Anoplura + Trichodectidae [31]. Rather than an extrinsic,
life-history related explanation relating minicircles in
lice to their parasitism, an explanation based on a
genetic factor, loss of mtSSB, seems more plausible.
Of the subset of genes which have been related to mt
genome deletions, annotation of the Pediculus genome
found that the only one that was absent, or highly divergent from homologues in other insects, was mtSSB.
While it is possible that mtSSB is present in Pediculus
but so highly modified that our BLAST approach to
gene identification did not detect it, the high degree of
conservation of this gene in other insects (Additional
File 5) suggests that even if it were present it is so
highly modified in Pediculus as to be non-functional in
which case an argument based on its absence is still
valid (c.f. [62]).
Functionally mtSSB has five major roles in the upkeep
of mt genomes:
1. Binding to single-stranded mtDNA during replication, protecting it from mutation [63,64].
2. Preventing DNA-slippage at stalled replication
forks [65].
3. Increasing the processivity of the replisome thus
increasing the rate of DNA synthesis [66,67].
4. Stabilizing the triple-stranded D-loop replicative
intermediate in vertebrates [68].
5. A major component of mitochondrial nucleoids
[64,69,70].
All single-stranded binding proteins have a function in
protecting DNA during the single stranded phase of
replication [63] and the absence of mtSSB may be
responsible for heightened rates of substitution observed
within lice [71,72]. The second and third of these functions suggest that in the absence of mtSSB, formation of

Cameron et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:394
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/394

minicircles would be favored and possibly even evolutionarily adaptive. Viguera et al. [65] have demonstrated
that re-initiation of stalled replication forks requires dissociation of the polymerase from the template. In such
circumstances, the single-stranded nascent DNA strand
can reassociate with other regions of the template strand
resulting in replication slippage as the intervening
region between the original and new template sites is
not replicated. SSBs stabilize the nascent strand while
the polymerases are detached and prevent the illicit
pairings which result in slippage in a dose dependent
manner. That is, low concentrations of SSB result in a
mixed population of full length and partial genomes
whereas high concentrations can prevent the formation
of slipped genome altogether [65]. This model of slippage depends on the presence of repetitive DNA
stretches such that the nascent strand could anneal to
both locations. This is enhanced by the formation of
hairpin-loop secondary structures that bring the repetitive regions into close physical proximity and can cause
replication to stall within the repeat region. Just such a
deletion between repetitive elements was identified in
the Coloceras mt genome resulting in the heteroplasmic
mix of full length and minicircular mt genomes.
The absence of mtSSB would also have favoured the
retention of minicircles once formed. mtSSB stabilizes the
single-stranded conformation of the lagging replication
strand which increases the rate of replication (processivity
of the replisome) and the maximum size of templates
which can be replicated. Korhonen et al. [66] have demonstrated that mtSSB increases the size of replication products in a dose dependent manner from around 2000 bp
in its absence to over 15000 bp at high concentrations. In
the absence of mtSSB complete replication of a full sized
mt genome may be impossible. However, the minicircle
sized genomes might be sufficiently small to be replicated
by polymerase and helicase alone. The minicircles found
in Pediculus and Damalinia are 3-4 and 2-2.5 kb in size
respectively, comparable to the replicable sizes found by
experimental knock out of mtSSB. It is thus possible to
propose that loss of mtSSB would favour both the formation of minicircles through replicative slippage and their
intergenerational retention due to an impaired ability to
replicate larger mt genomes.
The effect of loss of mtSSB on the final two roles - Dloop stabilization and nucleoid formation - are difficult
to assess owing to a complete lack of research on these
phenomena in insect models. In mammals mtSSB stabilizes D-loops by reducing the capacity of transcription
factor A (TFAM) to remove the RNA priming region
and resolve triple-stranded, DNA/RNA hybrid D-loops
into double-stranded non-replicative DNA [68]. D-loops
have not been directly demonstrated within insects [73];

Page 11 of 15

however, the conserved sequence box (CSB) regions
which are critical to D-loop formation in mammals have
[74,75]. CSB regions are binding sites for transcription
termination factors and the premature termination of
transcription at these sites generates the short RNA primers that form the D-loop [76]. It is unknown what, if
any, interactions between mtSSB and TFAM are responsible for D-loop persistence in insects and accordingly
the impact of the loss of mtSSB on replication initiation
cannot be predicted. TFAM has also been shown in
mammals to control mtDNA copy number, possibly due
to its role in nucleoid formation [77]. TFAM, however,
can be excluded as a cause of minicircle formation in
Pediculus as its structure is very similar to that of
TFAMs from vertebrates and other insects in that it
possesses two conserved high mobility group (HMG)
motifs (the third, C-terminal HMG found in Drosophila
and Anopheles is however absent but is probably Diptera
specific). Mitochondrial nucleoids are one of the most
poorly understood facets of mtDNA maintenance, composed of multiple mtDNA molecules complexed with
protein and have been proposed as the units of mt
inheritance [78]. Nucleoids have, however, yet to be studied in an insect model. Most available data on nucleoid
composition is from yeast or vertebrate model species
and the protein complement of the nucleoid varies
widely between different species [66,70,79]. mtSSB is
one of the few consistently recovered components of the
vertebrate mt nucleoid; however, its function within the
nucleoid is unknown and accordingly it is unclear what
effect its absence would have.

Conclusion
Genome deletions and minicircles are common in louse
evolution, not being confined to any particular louse subgroup. Three types of minicircles, which do not appear to
form an evolutionary series, were identified within lice,
however Type 3 minicircles (multichromosomal minicircles with few genes) are likely synapomorphic for the
group Trichodectidae+Anoplura. Annotation of the ne-mt
genes from the Pediculus nuclear genome, suggests that
mitochondrial function is largely intact, as the majority of
genes are present, despite the extreme divergence of its
multichromosomal mt genome from the single chromosomal mt genome found in almost all other bilaterian animals. The absence of one ne-mt gene, mtSSB, could
explain the fragmentation of the mt genome into multiple
chromosomes. This mechanistic explanation for the
occurrence of minicircles in lice is more likely than ones
based on a blood-feeding life-history (see [16]). The
absence of mtSSB may also have favoured the retention of
minicircles once formed due to an incapacity of the mt
replisome to replicate full sized mt genomes. The effect of

Cameron et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:394
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/394

lacking mtSSB would have on other mt functions such as
D-loop stabilization and nucleoid formation requires additional research.

Methods
PCR amplification and sequencing

Collecting records for louse specimens are given in
Additional File 1. All specimens were collected into
100% ethanol and stored at -80°C prior to extraction.
DNA was extracted using the DNEasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from a single louse and a single
DNA extract was used for all PCRs in this study.
Sequence and location of all amplification primers used
in this study are in Additional file 6. Initial PCRs for Ibidoecus amplified three intragenic regions: 383 bp of cox1
(primers: L6225/H7005 from [80]); 550 bp of rrnL
(16Sar/16Sbr from [81]); and 350 bp of rrnS (12Sai/
12Sbi from [81]) amplified using reaction conditions as
described in [82]. These initial sequences where used to
design specific long PCR primers which where combined in all possible forward and reverse combinations
of attempted long PCRs between the three genes (standard long PCR protocol below). Initial PCRs for Coloceras, Anaticola, Philopterus and Quadraceps consisted
of two long PCRs rrnL to rrnS (CAM10/CAM7 from
[27]) and rrnS to rrnL (GON1/GON2 from [27]). Long
PCRs for bird lice were performed using Elongase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) with the following cycling
conditions: 92°C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 92°C for 30 sec,
50°C for 30 sec, 68°C for 12 min; and a final extension
step of 68° for 20 min. Sequencing was performed using
ABI BigDye ver. 3 dye terminator sequencing technology
and run on ABI 3770 or ABI 3740 capillary sequencers.
Cycle sequencing conditions were 28 cycles of 94°C/10
sec, 50°C/5 sec, 60°C/4 min. Within each long PCR product the full, double stranded sequence was determined
by primer walking (primer sequences available from
SLC on request). Initial PCRs for Damalinia were generated for cox1 (L6225/H7005), rrnL (16Sar/16Sbr) and
rrnS (12Sai/12Sbi) using ExTaq (TaKaRa, Otsu, Shiga)
with the following cycling conditions: 94°C for 2 min,
40 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 45°C for 30 sec, 65°C for 5
min. Long PCRs for Damalinia were generated using
LA-Taq (TaKaRa, Otsu, Shiga) with the following
cycling conditions: 98°C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 98°C for
30 sec, and 68°C for 15 min (combined annealing/extension step). Due to sequence variability, the non-coding
regions of Damalinia were cloned prior to sequencing
using the pGem-T Easy Vector system (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) following manufacturer protocols.
Sequencing of short PCR, long PCR and cloned fragments from Damalinia was performed using the CEQ
DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California) following manufacturer protocols.

Analysis and Annotation

Raw sequence files were proof read and assembled into
contigs in Sequencher ver. 4 (GeneCodes Corporation,
Ann Arbor, Michigan). Transfer RNA analysis was conducted using tRNAscan-SE [83] with invertebrate mitochondrial codon predictors and a cove score cut off of 1.
Reading frames between tRNAs were found in Sequencher
and identified using translated BLAST searches (blastx)
[84] as implemented at the NCBI website (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Annotations of ribosomal RNA gene
boundaries were performed by comparison with published
models of rRNA secondary structure (e.g. [85]). Evolution
of genome structure and rearrangements was assessed by
comparison with phylogenetic trees inferred by adding
sequences for cox1, lsu-rRNA and wingless to the alignment used in [31] for the five species included in the present study but not included, Ibidoecus, Bothriometopus,
Coloceras, Quadraceps and Philopterus. Trees were
inferred using MrBayes ver3.1.1 [86] using two independent runs, each with 4 chains and unlinked data partitions
for 10,000,000 generations and trees were sampled every
1000 generations. The first 1000 trees were discarded as
burnin following determination of stationarity in the Bayesian analyses using Tracer ver. 1.4 [87]. Substitution models were estimated for each gene partition using AIC as
implemented in MrModeltest 2.3 [88]. Genome rearrangements were coded as binary states or unknown for species
from which only partial mtgenomes are available. Character evolution was traced using MacClade ver 4.06 [89]
treating character states as unordered. The tree has been
uploaded to TreeBASE (accession: http://purl.org/phylo/
treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S11666)
Annotation of the nuclear-encoded, mitochondriatargeted (ne-mt) genes within the Pediculus humanus genome were conducted using genome assembly phumU1,
hosted on the VectorBase website [90]. The most up to
date list of ne-mt genes identified from Drosophila was
compiled from [38,91]. Pediculus orthologues of the Drosophila ne-mt genes were identified by the best bidirection
hit (BBH) approach [92]. Amino acid sequences for the
Drosophila melanogaster copies of each gene were taken
from GenBank and blasted against the predicted peptide
set for Pediculus (Phum_pep_ver1.1 gene build) using
blastP [84] as implemented on VectorBase. Best blast
matches within the Pediculus genome were confirmed by
reciprocal blasting of the inferred peptide against the Drosophila genome on GenBank. Only reciprocal best blast
pairs are considered orthologous genes and treated further
within this study.
