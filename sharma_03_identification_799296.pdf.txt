Abstract
Background: Tuberculosis (TB) surveillance programs in Canada have established that TB in
Canada is becoming a disease of geographically and demographically distinct groups. In 1995, treaty
status aboriginals from the province of Manitoba accounted for 46% of the disease burden of this
sub-group in Canada. The TB incidence rates are dramatically high in certain reserves of Manitoba
and are equivalent to rates in African countries. The objective of our study was to identify prevalent
isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the patient population of Manitoba using molecular
epidemiology tools, studying the patient demographics associated with the prevalent strain and
studying the in vitro cytokine profiles post-infection with the predominant strain.
Methods: Molecular typing was performed on all isolates available between 1992 to1997. A clinical
database was generated using patient information from Manitoba. THP-1 cells were infected using
strains of M. tuberculosis and cytokine profiles were determined using immunoassays for cytokines
IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ and TNF-α.
Results: In Manitoba, 24% of the disease burden is due to a particular M. tuberculosis strain (Type1).
The strain is common in patients of aboriginal decent and is responsible for at least 87% of these
cases. Cytokine assays indicate that the Type1 strain induces comparatively lower titers of IL-1β,
IFN-γ and TNF-α in infected THP-1 cells as compared to H37Ra and H37Rv strains.
Conclusion: In Manitoba, Type1 strain is predominant in TB patients. The majority of the cases
infected with this particular strain are newly active with a high incidence of respiratory disease,
positive chest radiographs and pulmonary cavities. In vitro secretion of IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α is
suppressed in Type1 infected culture samples when compared to H37Ra and H37Rv infected cells.

Background
Epidemiology of tuberculosis

Tuberculosis (TB) infects one-third of the world population and causes approximately 3 million deaths annually

[1–4]. The average incidence rate for tuberculosis is 5.9
per 100,000 population in Canada and 9.2 per 100,000
population in the Canadian province of Manitoba [3,5].
In Canada, the majority of TB cases in most provinces are
attributed to immigration. Of all the TB cases in each of
the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec,
foreign born cases represent majority of the cases (81%,
60% and 48% of the cases, respectively) while foreign
born cases represent only 29% of the total TB cases in
Manitoba [3]. In Manitoba, the composition of TB patients is distinctly different from that of other Canadian
provinces as the majority of TB cases are among Canadian-born individuals, with the highest incidence among
treaty (registered) aboriginals (48.4 per 100,000 overall,
with rates as high as 496.3 per 100,000 in select communities) [3]. 'Aboriginals' or 'first nations' describe the indigenous
Canadians
and
their
descendants,
encompassing those registered as status aboriginals,
Métis, Innu and Intuit individuals that may live on or off
reserves. In the past few decades, incidence rates of TB
have declined in every sub-population, however rates
among Canadian-born treaty individuals in Manitoba
(48.4 per 100,000) are still more than ten times higher
than for non-treaty subgroup (3.3 per 100,000) and more
than two times higher than for the foreign-born subgroup
(22.0 per 100,000) [3–6]. Canadian surveillance studies
have shown that TB is prevalent in geographically and demographically distinct groups, such as, foreign-born and
aboriginal individuals [5]. These groups have sustained a
steady level of incidence and are in need of targeted TB
control measures, with treaty status sub-population contributing to the majority of the current burden of incident
cases [5]. The incidence rate of TB among treaty status aboriginals (48.4 per 100,000) was five times higher than
the overall provincial rate (9.2 per 100,000) and eight
times higher than the national rate of TB (5.9 per
100,000). The incidence rate of TB in treaty status aboriginals is probably an underestimate as the number of aboriginal individuals that have not claimed treaty status is
unknown.

Currently available molecular diagnostic techniques such
as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) using the insertion sequence IS6110, secondary probes
(pTBN12), and spoligotyping, permit strain identification
within species with a higher degree of specificity compared to traditional methods [7–11]. These techniques
help to confirm or identify the chain of transmission and
the distribution of strain clusters, allowing insight into the
molecular evolution of the species [7,12–14]. The most
widely used method is IS6110-RFLP typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) which relies on repetitive
DNA insertion sequence with a length of 1361 bp and is
specific to the M. tuberculosis complex [7,10]. In our laboratory, IS6110-RFLPtyping was performed on 479 patient
isolates and we analyzed the predominant RFLP patterns
among these isolates.

Manitoba has a population of 1.15 million of which
78.1% are Canadian-born (CB) non-treaty, 8.9% are treaty aboriginals, and the remainder (13%) are foreign-born
(Statistics Canada census, 2002). The majority of Manitoba residents live in the capital city of Winnipeg (685,500).
There are 139 reserves in Manitoba; reserves are tracts of
land whose legal title is held by the Federal Crown and
which has been set apart for use and benefit of a particular
First Nation community (Statistics Canada census, 2002,
Province of Manitoba, 2000). All of the TB cases in the
province are reported to TB control program that monitors provincial TB patient registry, hospitals, clinics and
diagnostic TB laboratories in Manitoba [5].

Methods

Host responses to tuberculosis
TB infection is a competitive balance between the bacterium, M. tuberculosis trying to establish itself within the host
tissues and host cellular defense mechanisms striving to
overcome the infection. The progression of the disease is
governed by both host genetic factors and interactions between the host and parasite [15–18]. Host defenses depend mostly on cell mediated immunity, primarily T
lymphocytes and macrophages [16]. Macrophages are the
first cells to encounter M. tuberculosis in lungs of the host
and they react to the parasite by producing a distinct pattern of cytokines including; Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) [16,19]. The pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ as well as
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were analyzed in this
study [19–21]. In this study, the patient demographic and
geographic factors associated with the prevalent clinical
isolates were studied. To investigate whether this prevalent M. tuberculosis strain was virulent, we examined the in
vitro growth rate of these bacilli and the cytokine responses in THP-1 cells following infection with M. tuberculosis
strains.

DNA Fingerprinting
479 isolates were available from 610 TB patients (1992–
1997) at The Mycobacteriology Laboratory, Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg. The mycobacterial genomic DNA
was extracted and purified using conventional methods
[11,22]. The digestion of genomic mycobacterial DNA using PvuII was carried out as described by Van Embden et al
[22] with a few modifications [10,12]. The digested DNA
was transferred onto the nylon membrane, probed overnight with DIG-labeled IS6110 probe at 65°C and exposed to X-ray film for 15–20 minutes. Fingerprint
pattern images were captured using GelDoc (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) and analyzed using Molecular Analyst

Software-fingerprinting version 1.1 (Bio-Rad). Computer
assisted phylogenetic analysis was employed to characterize strains and assess banding pattern similarities. Numerical designations were arbitrarily assigned to strains
according to their prevalence in the population under
study.
Data collection
A total of 115 TB patient records were screened for this
study between 1992–1997 and were obtained from the
Provincial TB Registry, Manitoba. The data fields such as
age, sex, race, origin, disease diagnosis, chest X-ray, the
presence of cavitary disease and residential location were
extracted from the patient records and the information
was entered into a database. This data was blinded, allowing data analysis while maintaining the patient
confidentiality.
Immunology
Bacterial strains
M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra (ATCC 25177), H37Rv
(ATCC 25618) and Type1 were cultured for 6 weeks on
Middlebrook 7H10 agar media [23]. Bacilli were harvested at mid-log phase and adjusted to 1 × 107 cells per ml in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Colony counts and purity checks were performed on these cultures [24].
Culture of macrophages
Human mononuclear cell line, THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202),
was used in our experiments. THP-1 cells are phagocytic in
nature and can be induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells [25]. The cells were cultured in RPMI1640 media (Sigma, ON, Canada) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) and 1% streptomycin-penicillin antibiotic (Sigma). Cells were stained with
trypan blue (Sigma) and the number of viable cells were
determined using a hemacytometer [23,25].
Monocyte stimulation
THP-1 cells (2 × 106 cells) grown in RPMI media supplemented with 5% FBS and without antibiotic, were infected with 2 × 107 colony forming units of either of H37Ra,
H37Rv and Type1 M. tuberculosis strains. Uninfected PBS
was used as a negative control. Colony counts of mycobacteria were determined at each time point post-infection by subculturing serial dilutions of the cultures onto
Middlebrook 7H10 plates. Supernatants were collected at
different time intervals i.e., 0.25, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72
hours post-infection by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20
minutes at 15°C and were then aliquoted and stored at 20°C until used [20,24].
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was carried out in triplicate for each infection using commercially

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/3

available antibody pairs for cytokines IL-12, IL-1β, IFN-γ,
TNF-α and IL-10 in accordance to manufacturer's instructions® & D Systems, Minneapolis). Each assay was run
with a negative control (PBS) and blank samples (according to manufacturer's instructions). The average zero
standard optical density was subtracted from different
standard and sample optical densities. Sample concentrations were calculated using a standard curve. The results
were expressed as amounts of cytokine in picograms per
milliliter (pg/ml). The average values were calculated
from six independent trials which were each analyzed in
triplicate.
Statistical analysis
Data was statistically analyzed using SAS software (version 7.0, Cary, North Carolina). Results were derived from
six independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate. Cytokine results were correlated at each time point
using a non-parametric correlation coefficient. Each immunological (cytokine) variable was analyzed using a
two-way ANOVA correlating group and time interaction,
followed by least square means multiple comparisons
with bonferroni corrections.

Results
Type1 Epidemiology
Between 1992 and 1997, there were 610 TB positive patients in Manitoba. There are 194 M. tuberculosis strains
isolated from 479 patients from Manitoba and the top 5
strains are Type1, Type5, Type2, Type72, Type71 that are
responsible for 24%, 5%, 4.6%, 4.2% and 2% of the total
TB cases, respectively. The predominant group of isolates
(115/479 cases; 24%) showed a similar banding pattern,
which we referred to as fingerprint 'Type1'. As 1 in 4 patients were infected with Type1, we screened patient
records for cases which depicted this fingerprint pattern.
Of all Type1 cases reported in the province of Manitoba,
Winnipeg, the capital city of Manitoba alone accounted
for 70/115 cases (60.8%) of the cases. Among Type1 patients residing in cities, 98.5% of the individuals lived in
the city of Winnipeg. In areas other than cities, 93% of the
Type1 patients lived on aboriginal reserves. Winnipeg and
aboriginal reserves appear to be reservoirs of Type1 strain.
The majority of the Type1 cases were newly active (91/115
cases; 79%). This strain causes disease in the younger
groups with an age range of 21–50 years (84/115 cases;
73%). Within this group, patients with an age range of
31–40 yrs (31/115 cases; 26.9%) are at the most risk of
developing disease due to this strain. Infection from this
strain appears to be more prevalent among males (73/115
cases; 63%). The majority of treaty and non-treaty status
aboriginal people (100/115 cases; 87%) had this Type1
strain isolated from their cultures. Of a total of 100 aboriginal cases, 85 (85%) had treaty status and 15 (15%)
were non-treaty status aboriginals. Radiograms of the

patients show that many of Type1 cases exhibited respiratory disease (104/115 cases; 90%) and some (22/115 cases; 19%) had developed pulmonary cavities.
In vitro cytokine production post-infection
We examined the in vitro response of human THP-1
monocytes to infection with M. tuberculosis H37Rv,
H37Ra and the Type1 strain (See methods). Colony
counts (measured in cfu) were obtained post-infection at
0.25, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hrs to determine the log difference in colony forming units over time. Differences in
the cfu log10 values [log10(max)-log10(min)] of M. tuberculosis strains at 0.25, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hrs postinfection were 0.2 for H37Ra, 0.15 for H37Rv and 0.16 for
Type1 strain. At any time point, differences in the cfu

log10 values between H37Ra, H37Rv and Type1 were also
insignificant (Difference in log10 values ≤ 0.15).
Levels of IL-12, IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 were measured in M. tuberculosis infected cell cultures. The levels of
the forementioned cytokines were determined at 0.25, 2,
4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hrs post-infection in order to observe any change of profile during this time period.
IFN-γ
Secretion of IFN-γ was highest in supernatants of H37Rv
infected cells (p < 0.05) in comparison to cells infected
with H37Ra or Type1 strains (Fig. 1). IFN-γ secretion was
consistently low in Type1 infected cultures, compared to
the control (6–72 hrs post-infection; p < 0.033), H37Ra
infected cells (0.25–72 hrs post infection; p < 0.02) and

Discussion
Epidemiology
Different M. tuberculosis strains have different rates of
transmission in a population. IS6110-RFLP analysis has
shown that some strains of M. tuberculosis are more capable of causing disease outbreaks than other strains
[11,26]. Our epidemiological investigations have shown
that the Type1 strain causes cluster outbreaks with a high
rate of active infection and accounts for 24% of all TB cases in Manitoba. This strain is prevalent among infected individuals of aboriginal decent (87%) [3]. Until recently, it
was believed that the high prevalence of this strain was
secondary to socioeconomic factors. However, these fac-

tors alone do not account for the high prevalence of Type1
strain and the high incidence of patients displaying newly
active disease, respiratory disease, positive radiograms
and pulmonary cavities. A study by our collaborators has
also demonstrated the occurrence of central nervous system (CNS) TB may be strain dependent and that Type1
strain was significantly associated with the number of
CNS TB positive cases [27]. A recent study conducted by
Manca et al has shown that different clinical isolates may
elicit different responses in vivo and may be designated as
virulent or hypervirulent [28,29]. We were interested in
studying Type1 strain as it is responsible for approximately one in four cases of TB in Manitoba and 9 of 10 TB cases
in the aboriginals of Manitoba. The probability that this
strain has a higher potential to cause disease in infected
subjects must be explored further using different methods
such as in vitro and in vivo host responses and in vivo sur-

vival studies. In this study, we studied in vitro host response in cells infected with Type1 by estimating the
secretion levels of four pro-inflammatory and an anti-inflammatory cytokines over a period of time (0.25–72 hrs).
Mycobacterial Growth
The colony count data shows that the growth of all M. tuberculosis strains was similar throughout the experiment.
The doubling time for M. tuberculosis varies from 20–30
hrs, and since our THP1 infection experiments were carried out over a total of 72 hrs, the bacilli could only have
gone through 2–3 cycles of replication. In addition, M. tuberculosis requires specialized growth media (Lowenstein
Jensen, Middlebrook 7H10, 7H9, BACTEC 12B etc.) and
since our infection experiments were carried out using a
non-specific M. tuberculosis growth media (RPMI), it may

explain the insignificant difference in the growth (log10
values) of M. tuberculosis strains.
Cytokine responses
Cytokines play a key role in the success of the host immune response against mycobacterial infection and in the
pathogenesis of TB. In TB, the host responses are provided
by T cells and macrophages [16,19,20]. Indeed, macrophages are the first cells of the immune system that are exposed to M. tuberculosis. They act by engulfing the bacilli,
producing proteolytic enzymes, presenting mycobacterial
antigens to T cells and producing a characteristic pattern
of cytokines that regulate the immune system and mediate many of clinical manifestations of TB [16]. We used a
human THP-1 monocytic cell line in vitro and carried out
mycobacterial infections with H37Ra, H37Rv, Type1
strains and PBS control. THP-1 cells are phagocytic in naPage 7 of 10

ture and can differentiate into mature cells that function
as macrophages that are capable of producing cytokines
such as IL-1, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40 and TNF-α [25].
Our results demonstrate that there is a specific pattern of
cytokines secreted by infected THP-1cells. Titers for most
of the pro-inflammatory cytokines as IFN-γ, IL-1β and
TNF-α were highest in cells infected with H37Rv strain.
Type1 infected cells expressed lower amounts of these cytokines as compared to H37Ra and H37Rv infected cells.
Although IL-12 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine that favors Th1 host immune responses and is directly responsible for the outcome of the TB infection, it
was not detected in sufficient amounts in our system
[30,31]. There are several possible explanations for this
observation. Firstly, perhaps M. tuberculosis organism itself
is unable to induce sufficient amounts of IL-12 in THP-1
cells [30,31]. Secondly, negative stimulators of IL-12 production such as IL-10 and IL-4 may counteract pro-inflammatory effects of IL-12 [31]. Finally, we cannot
exclude the possibility that IL-12 secretion may be mycobacterial dose dependent. Other methods such as RT-PCR
may be used to detect IL-12 levels more effectively than
the method used in this study.
It is known that IFN-γ enhances the antimicrobial activity
of macrophages through increased production of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide metabolites, while inhibiting the proliferation of Th2 cells and the secretion of Type
2 cytokines [32–34]. IFN-γ secretion was depressed in cells
infected with the Type1 and hence these low levels were
insufficient to induce the macrophages to secrete IL-12
(Fig. 1). Both IFN-γ and TNF-α are required for protective
host immunity to TB infection [34–38] and the production of [30,31] low expression levels of IFN-γ are likely responsible for the impaired protective immune cascade to
a greater extent in Type1 infected cells than H37Rv infected cells. Furthermore, mixed cell culture experiments containing T-lymphocytes may be a more favourable model
to study IFN-γ production as T-lymphocytes are a more
important cellular source of IFN-γ than monocytes. Studies using animal models may provide a better experimental model to study this cytokine.
IL-1 is produced upon stimulation by M. tuberculosis cell
wall components and mycobacterial proteins [16]. IL-1
secretion upregulates T-cell expression of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors, induces macrophages to produce other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α and may
contribute to development of fever [16,36]. The comparatively lower concentrations of IL-1β in Type1 infected cells
may have resulted in lesser TNF-α secretion (Fig. 2), thus
providing a more stable environment for the strain to
propagate or reside within the host cell.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/3

TNF-α secretion was detected for all the strains from 0.25–
8 hrs but thereafter was higher in H37Rv and Type1 infected cells (Fig. 3). Similar titers of TNF-α at 0.25–8 hrs. postinfection with all M. tuberculosis strain can be attributed to
M. tuberculosis as well as its cell wall components and proteins. In vitro and in vivo studies from other laboratories
have shown that mycobacterial components induce higher amounts of TNF-α in virulent M. tuberculosis strains as
compared to avirulent strains [16,26]. This phenomenon
was evident in our experiments from cells infected with
virulent strains (24–72 hrs of post infection). However,
TNF-α secretion does not complement secretion pattern
of other pro-inflammatory cytokines under investigation
in Type1 infected cultures. As TNF-α exhibits both protective immunity, in terms of anti-mycobacterial activity and
development of granulomas and pathological effects, including symptoms such as fever and wasting. It is perhaps
best to study this cytokine in vivo using animal models
whereby a distinction could be made as to which effect is
predominant [16,21].
Anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, suppress production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12.
This process of downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines could prove to be deleterious to the host [19]. IL10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis by monocytes and macrophages [20,39]. Following infection, IL-10 levels in Type1
infected cells were high and subsequently were the similar
for H37Ra and H37Rv infected cells (Fig. 4). Similar findings have been demonstrated with other M. tuberculosis
strains in both in vitro and in vivo studies using animal
models as well as in clinical studies [20,35,40].
Upon infection, host cells come into contact with mycobacterial components such as LAM and mycobacterial
proteins of molecular weight 20 and 46 kDa and secrete
IL-1 and TNF-α. TNF-α is also produced by other mycobacterial proteins of molecular weight 44, 58, 65 kDa
[15,21,30,37]. Compared to other strains under investigation, Type1 infected cells produced lower levels of IL-1
which may have lead to the ineffective host immune response, also resulting in lesser bacillary elimination in
these cells. On the other hand, high levels of TNF-α are secreted in host cells infected with virulent strains of M. tuberculosis and this data is consistent with TNF-α secretion
in Type1 infected cells [15,26]. TNF-α along with other
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ, activates the
macrophages to produce inducible nitric oxide synthase
and reactive nitrogen intermediates, which cause reduction of mycobacterial growth but fails to eliminate the
pathogen [21,30,33,37]. Contrary to pro-inflammatory
cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines act by downregulating host immune response and limiting host tissue injury and are primarily produced upon infection by M.

tuberculosis [16,20,41]. Excessive IL-10 production at
0.25–4 hrs post-infection may have contributed towards
loss of control of infection [20,35,40]. Supportive evidence has shown that elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-10
have been detected in patients with lung TB
[20,35,39,40]. TB disease is better controlled when the
host rapidly develops pro-inflammatory cytokine response in infected cells. On the other hand, disruption of
the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by absence or suppression of pro-inflammatory
cytokine response and predominance of immuno-suppressive cytokines, as depicted by Type1 infected cells,
may be associated with early development of disease. If
these results are replicated in vivo and are correlated with
disease progression, they may better explain the predominance and virulence of Type1 strain in the Manitoba.

Conclusion
The pathogenesis of TB depends on a combination of M.
tuberculosis virulence factors and host factors. Results from
this study indicate that Type1 strain has a unique epidemiology as well as a specific cytokine profile, which confers
it the ability to modulate host immune response in its favour. These factors may explain the propensity of the
Type1 strain in Manitoba, especially among its aboriginals. These findings must be confirmed in vivo using
mouse models which will help us to better understand the
pathogenesis of the M. tuberculosis Type1 strain. We are
currently studying the in vivo survival rate, clearance or
non clearance of infection and immunological responses
of mice infected with Type1 and other clinical strains. This
would not only provide evidence of strain related virulence but the immunological profiles could also be used
to modulate host immune response to enhance therapy of
TB.
