Abstract
Background: Streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis,
mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species.
Two of these species, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the
normal human oral microflora whereas the third, Streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk.
Given that S. salivarius and S. vestibularis share several physiological characteristics, in addition to
inhabiting the same ecosystem, one would assume that they would be more closely related to each
other than to S. thermophilus. However, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that S.
vestibularis is more closely related to S. thermophilus. To determine whether this phylogenetic
relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from secA and secY, the
general secretion housekeeping genes, recA, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a
major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16S rRNA-encoding gene
sequences using other streptococcal species as outgroups.
Results: The maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic inferences
derived from the secA and recA gene sequences provided strong support for the S. vestibularis/S.
thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16S rRNA-encoding and secY-based analyses could not
discriminate between alternate topologies. Phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of
these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus.
Conclusion: Our results corroborated the sister-relationship between S. vestibularis and S.
thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of S. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

Background
The Streptococcus genus comprises ninety-two recognized
species that are present in a wide variety of habitats [1]. In

humans and animals, a number of streptococcal species
are important pathogens (e.g., S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes,
S. suis, and S. mutans), while others are members of mutuPage 1 of 9

alistic microflora (e.g., S. oralis, S. downei, S. dentirousetti,
and S. salivarius). The species of the Streptococcus genus
have been divided into six groups (anginosus, bovis,
mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius) based on 16S
rDNA phylogenetic inferences [2]. According to these
authors, the salivarius group is composed of three species:
(1) S. salivarius, a pioneer colonizer of the human oral
mucosa that is isolated mainly from the dorsum of the
tongue, the cheeks, and the palate [3], (2) S. vestibularis, a
mutualistic bacterium that is present on the vestibulum of
the human oral mucosa [4], and (3) S. thermophilus, a
thermophilic species [5] that is part of starter cultures used
in the production of yogurt and Swiss- or Italian-type
cooked cheeses. Unlike S. salivarius and S. vestibularis, S.
thermophilus is not a natural inhabitant of the human oral
mucosa and is commonly found on the mammary
mucosa of bovines, its natural ecosystem, as inferred from
its presence and that of thermophilus-specific bacteriophages in raw milk isolates [6-8].
The common ecosystem is not the only feature shared by
S. salivarius and S. vestibularis. Biochemical investigations
of functional metabolic pathways have revealed that these
two species share a high level of physiological resemblance. For example, S. salivarius and S. vestibularis are
capable of hydrolyzing esculin and generating acidic compounds from maltose and N-acetyl-glucosamine, while S.
thermophilus is not ([9] and references therein). Both S. salivarius and S. vestibularis are also opportunistic pathogens
that can cause mild to severe infective endocarditis [1012], whereas S. thermophilus has never been implicated in
such infections. Given the home environments of the
organisms, the high level of metabolic similarity between
S. salivarius and S. vestibularis, and the more restricted
spectrum of carbon sources that can be used by S. thermophilus [13], one would assume that S. salivarius and S.
vestibularis would be more related to each other than to S.
thermophilus. However the few phylogenetic trees published so far that include all three species, as inferred from
16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences [2] and the housekeeping gene sodA that encodes the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase [14], suggest that a schism
generated S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus subsequent to
the early divergence of S. salivarius. However, since these
two phylogenetic studies [2,14] were limited to only one
taxon for each species, the inferred relationships between
these three species might be inaccurate.
To investigate the evolutionary relationships between the
three species making up the salivarius group, we performed phylogenetic inferences based on the 16S rRNAencoding, secA and secY housekeeping genes and the
important yet non-essential recA gene using an identical
distribution of streptococcal strains among the various
markers to facilitate direct comparisons and allow the
concatenation of the individual sequences into a single

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/232

matrix. These four ubiquitous genes are widely distributed
and have homologues in all three kingdoms, i.e., Bacteria,
Archaea, and Eukarya (for reviews see [15-17]). The 16S
rRNA-encoding gene, which codes for the major ribonucleic constituent of the bacterial small ribosomal subunit
[18], is one the most frequently used housekeeping phylogenetic markers [19], while the secA and secY genes code
for components of the general protein-secretion pathway,
which is essential for several cell functions [20]. The
fourth gene, recA, codes for a product that initiates the formation of Holliday junction intermediates during homologous recombination [21]. Our ML and MP phylogenetic
inferences based of these four gene sequences are in agreement with earlier findings by Kawamura et al. [2] and
Poyart et al. [14] and corroborate the S. thermophilus/S.
vestibularis sister-relationship.

Results
Phylogenetic analyses of secA gene sequences
We began our investigation of the branching order of the
streptococci of the salivarius group by looking at phylogenetic trees inferred from the secA gene (Figure 1). As
expected, the salivarius group comprising S. salivarius, S.
thermophilus, and S. vestibularis was monophyletic in all
the ML and MP bootstrap replicates. The S. thermophilus
and S. vestibularis species monophylies were strongly supported by the ML and MP analyses, while support for the
S. salivarius monophyly ranged from weak to moderate in
the ML analyses and strong in the MP analyses. Our phylogenetic analyses based on secA gene sequences strongly
support the notion that S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus
are closely related species. The node comprising these two
species was retrieved in all the ML and MP bootstrap replicates, while the other two possible alternate topologies,
i.e., the S. salivarius/S. vestibularis and S. salivarius/S. thermophilus relationships, were not recovered in any of the
replicates.
Phylogenetic analyses of secY gene sequences
The ML and MP phylogenetic inferences derived from the
secY gene were not as conclusive (Figure 2). Although the
monophyly of the salivarius group was again recovered in
all the bootstrap replicates, together with the unambiguous delineation of the S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus
species, the S. salivarius species was paraphyletic, with S.
salivarius strain CCRI 17393 branching out at the base of
the three S. thermophilus strains. However, given the differences in branch lengths between S. salivarius strain CCRI
17393 and the other S. salivarius strains, the positioning of
this strain at the base of the S. thermophilus strains appears
dubious and may result from artifactual attraction
between locally long branches, an effect that might have
been exacerbated by the scarcity of informative characters
in this dataset. Of the 1287 positions constituting the secY
dataset, 135 displayed variations between members of the
salivarius group, with only 98 being phylogenetically

raffinose as the sole carbon source. This contradicts Whiley

informative (Table 1). In contrast, the secA dataset featured 266 variable sites, with 222 phylogenetically
informative characters among members of the salivarius
group, i.e., more than twice the amount of potentially discriminating information. On the other hand, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the branching of S. salivarius
strain CCRI 17393 at the base of the S. thermophilus strains
in our secY-based analyses resulted from a genuine phylogenetic signal. If this is true, then the secA and secY gene
sequences from S. salivarius strain CCRI 17393 have
evolved in different directions. In any event, the phylogenetic resolution of the secY dataset was not sufficient to
unambiguously infer the branching order between the
three species making up the salivarius group.

Phylogenetic analyses of recA partial gene sequences
Our phylogenetic inferences based on recA partial gene
sequences yielded clearer insights into the branching
order of the members of the salivarius group (Figure 3),
which were clustered together in all the ML and MP bootstrap replicates, while the two S. vestibularis strains formed
a united clade in all the replicates, and the three S. thermophilus strains branched together in the vast majority of
the bootstrap replicates. The monophyly of the S. salivarius species was recovered in 98% of the MP bootstrap replicates, although ML-based phylogenetic inferences could
not discriminate between paraphyletic and monophyletic
S. salivarius clades (52% vs. 48% of the bootstrap replicates, respectively). Like the secA-based phylogenetic
inferences, the analyses derived from the recA gene
sequences strongly supported a sister-relationship
between the S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus species. The
node comprising these two species was robust and was
recovered in all the ML and MP bootstrap replicates.
Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA-encoding gene
sequences
Building on the phylogeny published by Kawamura et al.
[2], we reinvestigated the branching order among the salivarius streptococci using 16S rRNA-encoding gene
sequences and expanded taxon sampling within the salivarius group. As can be seen in Figure 4, even though the
salivarius group was recovered in all the bootstrap replicates, the branching order within this taxonomic entity
was not well defined. Of the three species, only S. thermophilus composed a monophyletic assemblage. The
other two, S. vestibularis and S. salivarius, were not
resolved. This contrasted with the results obtained by
Kawamura et al. [2], who reported that the S. vestibularis
and S. thermophilus species branched together with strong
bootstrap support. It should be noted, however, that the
16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences exhibited almost no
variability among salivarius streptococci. Of the 1374
positions making up our 16S rRNA-encoding gene dataset, only 14 were variable, with a mere eight positions giving tangible phylogenetic information for the three
salivarius species (Table 1). The topologies inferred from
the 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences should thus be
treated with caution with respect to the branching order of
salivarius streptococci.
Phylogenetic analyses of concatenated gene sequences
To increase the resolving power of our phylogenetic analyses, we concatenated the four previous datasets into a
single matrix to pool their phylogenetic signals. As anticipated, our ML and MP analyses based on the concatenated
secA, secY, recA, and 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences
yielded superior resolved topologies (Figure 5). While the
clade constituting the salivarius group and the monophylies of the S. thermophilus and S. vestibularis species
were once again recovered in all of the bootstrap replicates, support for the monophyly of the S. salivarius spePage 3 of 9

Discussion
When we began our study, we expected that the S. salivarius and S. vestibularis species would be more closely related
to each other given their level of physiological resemblance and that the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sisterrelationship inferred in previous phylogenetic studies
[2,14] would not be robustly supported. Obviously, this
was not the case. Our results were in complete agreement
with earlier neighbor-joining phylogenies based on partial 16S rRNA-encoding and sodA gene sequences [2,14]
and corroborated the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sisterrelationship. This sister-relationship was not dependent
on the method of phylogenetic reconstruction and was
strongly supported by both our ML and MP analyses. Furthermore, while the 16S-rRNA-encoding and secY gene
sequences were unable to discriminate between the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus and the alternate S. vestibularis/S.
salivarius and S. salivarius/S. thermophilus sister-relationships, we observed no serious incongruities between the

topologies inferred from these molecular markers and
those inferred from the recA and secA gene sequences.
The S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sister-relationship
inferred from our phylogenetic analyses is not necessarily
incompatible with the observation that S. vestibularis
share more phenotypic similarities with S. salivarius than
with S. thermophilus. Following speciation from a putative
common ancestor physiologically similar to S. salivarius,
the two newly formed species could have evolved differently, with S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus independently retaining and discarding a number of ancestral
features. Many of the phenotypic losses observed in the S.
thermophilus species could have been induced by its adaptation to its new ecosystem, i.e., the bovine mammary
mucosa. In particular, because this species has access to a
wealth of nutrients within bovine milk, polyvalence for
sugar metabolism-related genes might not be as important for this species as for its relatives inhabiting the

study

human oral mucosa [13]. Further losses could have been
caused by additional selective pressure applied on S. thermophilus commercial strains ([22] and references therein)
that are used in the manufacture of various dairy products.
The relationships inferred among the three salivarius
streptococci raise interesting questions regarding their
establishment in their respective ecosystems. Because the
S. salivarius/S. vestibularis sister-relationship is not supported by phylogenetic analyses, the colonization of the
human oral cavity by an ancestor of S. thermophilus
present in bovine milk, which would have then speciated
over time into S. salivarius and S. vestibularis, is not plausible. Furthermore, the independent colonization of bovine
mammary and human oral mucosae by a putative ancestor originating from a third environment is not compatible with these phylogenies unless we assume two distinct
yet closely related streptococcal ancestors; one that independently colonized the two ecosystems yielding S. thermophilus and S. vestibularis on the one hand, and S.
salivarius on the other. Alternatively, the direct or indirect
invasion of the bovine mammary mucosa by an ancestor
of S. vestibularis originating from the human oral cavity
would also be compatible with the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sister-relationship.

Conclusion
The phylogenetic analyses presented in the present paper
strongly support the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sisterrelationship and the concomitant early divergence of S.
salivarius at the base of the salivarius clade, which is in
agreement with previous 16S rDNA/sodA-based phylogenetic inferences [2,14]. One of the main reasons for conducting the present study was the paucity of phylogenetic
studies involving all three species making up the salivarius
group. Although a number of studies that included S. salivarius and S. vestibularis have been published, S. thermophilus has been omitted more often than not since it is
not retrieved from human clinical isolates. Since the complete genome sequences of three S. thermophilus strains are
now available, it would be interesting to revisit phylogenetic studies that involve different phylogenetic markers
and S. salivarius/S. vestibularis but not S. thermophilus to
verify whether the addition of S. thermophilus would result
in a similar branching order among salivarius streptococci.

Methods
Source organisms
Streptococcus salivarius strains ATCC 7073 and 25975 and
Streptococcus vestibularis strain ATCC 49124 were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA, USA). Streptococcus salivarius strain K12 was obtained
from BLIS Technologies Ltd. (Dunedin, New Zealand).
Streptococcus salivarius strains CCUG 32452 and 25922
and Streptococcus vestibularis strains CCUG 7215 and
27306 (renamed S. salivarius strains CCUG 7215 and
27306 herein) were obtained from the University of Göteborg Culture Collection (Göteborg, Sweden). Streptococcus
salivarius clinical isolates CCRI 17344 and CCRI 17393
and Streptococcus vestibularis clinical isolate CCRI 17387
were obtained from the Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec
(CHUQ), CHUL Pavilion (Quebec City, QC, Canada).
The identity of the S. vestibularis strains was confirmed by
comparative growth on TYE medium containing either
raffinose or glucose as the sole carbon source.
DNA isolation and sequencing
Streptococcal strains were grown in TYE-glucose liquid
medium as described in Lévesque et al. [23] or on sheepblood agar medium overnight at 35°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. Their 16S rRNA-encoding, recA, secA, and
secY genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) from either (A) purified chromosomal DNA, (B)
DNA released from boiled bacterial colonies, or (C) bacterial lysates. Purified chromosomal DNA was obtained as
follows. Streptococcal cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were washed for 30 min at 37°C in 50
mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 6.7% (w/v)
sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, and 40 U/ml of mutanolysin. SDS
(final concentration 1%) was then added and the cells
were lysed for 10 min at 60°C. Proteinase K (final concentration 0.14 mg/ml) was added and the incubation was
continued for an additional 20 min. Chromosomal DNA
was isolated from the cellular debris using the standard
phenol/ChCl3 extraction protocol described by Sambrook
et al. [24]. DNA released from boiled cells was obtained as
follows. Streptococcal colonies grown on TYE-glucose
agar or blood agar medium were suspended in 100 μl of
distilled water and then boiled at 94°C for 3 min. This
suspension was then used instead of sterile distilled water
in the PCR protocols. Bacterial lysates were obtained with

the BD GeneOhm™ Lysis Kit (BD Diagnostics-GeneOhm,
Quebec City, QC, Canada). The 16S rRNA-encoding, recA,
secA and secY genes were amplified by PCR using primers
16S_F
(5'-AGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAGGACG-3')
and
16S_R (5'-ATCCAGCCGCACCTTCCGATAC-3'), SSU27
(5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3') and SSU1492 (5'TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3'), RStrGseq81 (5'GAAAWWIATYGARAAAGAITTTGGTAA-3')
and
RStrGseq937 (5'-TTYTCAGAWCCTTGICCAATYTTYTC3'), SecAAMON (5'-CAGGCCTTTGAAAATCTCTTAC-3')
and SecAAVAL (5'-CTCTTTATCACGAGCTTGCTTC-3'), or
SecYAMON (5'-CTGCTGAAGCAGCTATCACTGC-3') and
SecYAVAL (5'-CTTTACCAGCACCTGGTAGACC-3'). The
PCR templates were sequenced using Sanger dideoxynucleotide chemistry as described in Pombert et al. [25]. The
sequences were edited and assembled using STADEN
package version 1.7.0 http://staden.sourceforge.net/ or
SEQUENCHER 4.8 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Dataset preparation
The sequences we used were either retrieved from GenBank or sequenced by the authors. Sequences showing
ambiguous base calling in databases were not selected for
phylogenetic analyses. The 16S rRNA-encoding gene
sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX 2.0.7 [26],
whereas the recA, secA, and secY gene sequences were
aligned by positioning their codons on the corresponding
protein alignments. To do so, the amino acid sequences
from the corresponding gene sequences were first
deduced using the bacterial translation table from GETORF in EMBOSS 6.0.1 [27]. They were then aligned using
CLUSTALX 2.0.7, and the codons were positioned according to the amino acid alignments. Ambiguous regions in
the alignments were filtered out with GBLOCKS 0.91b
[28]. A fifth dataset was produced by concatenating the
resulting filtered sequences. Bootstrap replicates for the
ML analyses were generated with SEQBOOT from the
PHYLIP 3.67 package [29].

Phylogenetic analyses
Computations and analyses were performed on a cluster
of four AMD64 Opteron 875 Dual Core 2.2 Ghz/2 MB L2
cache CPUs with 16 GB of RAM running on Debian 4.0
(kernel 2.6.16.21), a MacBook Pro laptop with a Core 2
Duo 2.4 Ghz/4 MB L2 cache CPU and 2 GB of RAM running on MacOS X 10.5.4, or on an ASUS M6NBe laptop
with a 1.6 G Hz/2 MB L2 cache Dothan CPU and 1 GB of
RAM running on MS Windows XP SP3. Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were computed using PHYML 3.0
[30] under the GTR + Γ4 +I nucleotide substitution
model. This model was selected using the Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike 1973), as implemented using
jModelTest 3.7 [31]. One hundred bootstrap replicates
were performed for each ML analysis. Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses were performed with PAUP* 4.0b10
[32], each using a thousand bootstrap replicates.
