Molecular Phylodynamics and Protein Modeling
of Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV)

Abstract
Background: ISAV is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family that affects salmonids with disastrous results. It was
first detected in 1984 in Norway and from then on it has been reported in Canada, United States, Scotland and the
Faroe Islands. Recently, an outbreak was recorded in Chile with negative consequences for the local fishing
industry. However, few studies have examined available data to test hypotheses associated with the
phylogeographic partitioning of the infecting viral population, the population dynamics, or the evolutionary rates
and demographic history of ISAV. To explore these issues, we collected relevant sequences of genes coding for
both surface proteins from Chile, Canada, and Norway. We addressed questions regarding their phylogenetic
relationships, evolutionary rates, and demographic history using modern phylogenetic methods.
Results: A recombination breakpoint was consistently detected in the Hemagglutinin-Esterase (he) gene at either
side of the Highly Polymorphic Region (HPR), whereas no recombination breakpoints were detected in Fusion
protein (f) gene. Evolutionary relationships of ISAV revealed the 2007 Chilean outbreak group as a monophyletic
clade for f that has a sister relationship to the Norwegian isolates. Their tMRCA is consistent with epidemiological
data and demographic history was successfully recovered showing a profound bottleneck with further population
expansion. Finally, selection analyses detected ongoing diversifying selection in f and he codons associated with
protease processing and the HPR region, respectively.
Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the Norwegian origin hypothesis for the Chilean outbreak clade. In
particular, ISAV HPR0 genotype is not the ancestor of all ISAV strains, although SK779/06 (HPR0) shares a common
ancestor with the Chilean outbreak clade. Our analyses suggest that ISAV shows hallmarks typical of RNA viruses that
can be exploited in epidemiological and surveillance settings. In addition, we hypothesized that genetic diversity of
the HPR region is governed by recombination, probably due to template switching and that novel fusion gene
proteolytic sites confer a selective advantage for the isolates that carry them. Additionally, protein modeling allowed
us to relate the results of phylogenetic studies with the predicted structures. This study demonstrates that
phylogenetic methods are important tools to predict future outbreaks of ISAV and other salmon pathogens.

Background
Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is a pathogen that
has been associated with high fish mortality in the aquaculture industry [1]. The cumulative mortality associated
with each outbreak of ISAV in Norway and other countries is very high, reaching up to 100% of fish stock in
some cases [2-6]. ISAV has been classified as the only
member of Isavirus genus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family, which includes Influenza viruses [7].

Virions consist mainly of a membranous envelope with
two surface glycoproteins and a matrix protein surrounding a ribonucleoprotein complex. Association of nucleoprotein, three polymerase subunits and the genomic
RNA, in turn, forms the ribonucleoprotein complex.
Virion morphology varies from spherical to pleiomorphic. The enveloped virus particles are of 45-140 nm
in diameter, however, highly pleiomorphic particles up to
700 nm in the longest dimension are occasionally
observed. The genome organization is consistent with
other members of the Orthomyxoviridae; comprising of 8
segments of single stranded negative sense RNA ((-)
ssRNA), in which each segment encodes one protein

except segments 7 and 8, which encode two (European
strains)/three (Canadian strains) and two proteins,
respectively [8]. Four major structural proteins have been
identified, including a 68 kDa nucleoprotein, a 22 kDa
matrix protein, a 42 kDa surface glycoprotein named
haemagglutinin-esterase protein with receptor-binding
and receptor-destroying activity, and a 50 kDa surface
glycoprotein with fusion activity, coded by genome segments 3, 8, 6, and 5, respectively. Segments 1, 2, and 4
encode the putative viral polymerase subunits PB1, PB2,
and PA. The ORF1 of segment 7 encodes a nonstructural
protein with interferon antagonistic properties, while
ORF2 encodes a nuclear export protein. The smaller
ORF1 of segment 8 encodes the matrix protein, while the
larger ORF2 encodes an RNA-binding structural protein
also with interferon antagonistic properties [4,9-11].
Regarding the genes coding for surface proteins, he
genes exhibit a length polymorphism close to the 3’ end
called highly polymorphic region (HPR) that has been
related to virulence, although this is not entirely clear
[12-14]. In turn, f genes seem to be more conserved in
length, with the exception of the region next to the
putative protease-processing site (PPPS) [15,16]. The
fusion protein in ISAV is synthesized as a precursor
protein designated as F0. In order to exert its biological
function, F0 must be cleaved by cellular proteases to
generate F1 and F2 [17]. Several insertions of 10-12
amino acids (IN1-4), identical to sequences from other
genomic segments, have been suggested to confer novel
protease cleavage sites [15], and thus they could be subjected to positive selection.
Unlike other members of the Orthomyxoviridae family
that commonly infect mammals or birds, ISAV naturally
infects fishes of the Salmonidae family. Although natural
outbreaks of ISA have only been recorded in farmed
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), the virus has been isolated
also from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) [3] and
Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in Chile [18]. The
disease was first reported in Norway and the virus was
associated with the disease in 1984. At present, ISAV has
been reported in Canada (New Brunswick in 1996 and
Nova Scotia in 2000), USA (Maine in 2001), Scotland
(1998), The Faroe Islands (2000; Denmark), and recently
in Chile [6,19,20]. Because of the worldwide distribution
and the potential for serious economical losses, ISAV has
been listed as a non-exotic disease for the European
Union (EU) and is therefore monitored closely by the
European Community Reference Laboratory for Fish
Diseases http://www.crl-fish.eu/.
In general, phylogenetic studies of infectious diseases
have been centered on human and zoonotic diseases
with little attention to enzootic pathogens, although
with few exceptions, for example, in plant viruses’ croprelated diseases [21-24]. Given the human health impact,

phylogenetic studies of Orthomyxoviruses have been
largely devoted to influenza viruses in particular to
influenza A [25,26]. To date, questions related to global
distributions, molecular evolution and adaptations,
sources of genetic diversity and emergence of new isolates have been extensively addressed in the influenza
literature. However, little has been done with its relatives, e.g., ISAV, even when the same genetic structure,
and presumably, similar evolutionary forces might be
acting on ISAV populations.
In 1999 an ISAV belonging to the North American
(NA) genotype was isolated from Coho salmon in Chile
and the first outbreak of ISAV in marine-farmed Atlantic salmon in the Southern hemisphere occurred in the
same country starting in June 2007. Given that there are
no known natural hosts for ISAV in Chile, only a few
studies have investigated whether the outbreak source
came from North America or Europe by using basic
phylogenetic methods [6,15,19,20].
In this study, we apply more sophisticated phylogenetic and population genetic methods to currently available sequence data to address questions regarding the
2007 Chilean ISAV outbreak. In particular, we asked (i)
whether recombination is a relevant force acting on f
and he genes, (ii) whether the age estimates of the Chilean clade agree with epidemiological data, and (iii)
whether population processes leave marks in ISAV genomes that allow us to reconstruct its demographic history. Finally, we developed new improved structural
homology models with which positively selected sites
were mapped to relate them with functional traits.

Results and discussion
We included 70 isolates from Canada, Chile and Norway for which both genes, f and he, were available along
with their sampling dates. The length of the final alignments was 1365 and 1269 bp, respectively (additional
file 1). We selected TVM as the best-fit nucleotide substitution model for both genes based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [27]. Rate heterogeneity was
estimated as the gamma distributed shape parameter a
= 0.5740 and 0.6570 for f and he, respectively. We also
tested for whether the data were best explained by a
strict or relaxed molecular clock. Bayes Factor hypothesis testing favored the relaxed model in both cases
(10.44 and 21.82 log BF for f and he, respectively). This
was further supported by the Coefficient of Variation
and ucld.stdv parameters.
Genetic diversity and recombination

In order to explore the data and to see whether recombination plays a recognizable role in ISAV evolution, we
estimated the population genetic parameter Theta (θ)
and recombination rate (r) for each population. When

Castro-Nallar et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/349

calculated under the infinite-sites assumption, the Canadian and Chilean populations were more diverse than
the older Norwegian population (0.08579, 0.06247 and
0.01809, respectively). In turn, when using a coalescent
sampler estimator, the Norwegian population turned out
to be, as expected, more than three times more diverse
0.04774 (95% CI 0.0198-0.08448) than the young Chilean population 0.0142 (95% CI 0.008368-0.020745), and
than the Canadian population 0.03523 (95% CI
0.021083-0.051501) as well. Although at first this seems
contradictory, coalescent-based estimators of genetic
diversity are far more reliable than those based on segregating sites [28]. By taking into account evolutionary
history, coalescent-based estimates are more robust to
model assumptions and allow us to determine factors
influencing the observed patterns (see below). This overall result has practical implications as less diverse populations, i.e., genetically homogeneous, would be more
susceptible to vaccines and antiviral treatments whereas
more structured populations, i.e., individuals genetically
similar within populations but different among populations, make effective vaccine and antiviral deliveries
more difficult. So, population genetic inferences can be
instrumental in fish health surveillance programs as
demonstrated in human health settings [29-32].
Antisense (-) ssRNA viruses are less prone to recombination than their (+) sense counterparts [33,34]. In principle this would arise from the impossibility of (-) ssRNA
viruses to serve as templates for negative sense strand
synthesis once the genome is uncoated, in turn rendering
copy choice recombination less likely. In addition, (-)
ssRNA genomes are generally protected by viral nucleoproteins that prevent genome exposure to the cytoplasm
(and cell machinery) and to come in close contact with
other genome copies, thus rendering copy-choice recombination also unlikely. Also, the segmented genome structure of some (-) ssRNA relaxes even more the occurrence
of recombination by yielding the same outcome when
shuffling segments (reassortment). In agreement with this
hypothesis, our results showed a low overall recombination force (r) of (1.173 × 10-3 (1.90 × 10-4 - 3.50 × 10-3))
expressed as the ratio of recombination rate per site over
substitution rate per site. However, recombination does
happen in human [35-37] and avian [38] strains of influenza viruses as well as in some segments in ISAV, namely
segments 6 and 5 [12-14]. In this sense, we tested our
dataset to see whether or not it is possible to detect
recombination breakpoints. Using a suite of methods [39],
we consistently detected one possible recombination
breakpoint in the vicinity of the he HPR region. This result
was confirmed by substitution and phylogenetic algorithms and was further corroborated by phylogenetic
topological incongruence using a genetic algorithm
(GARD; Figure 1B). Since full-length HPR (HPR0) has

Page 3 of 11

been detected only in natural populations (not virulent)
and different HPR alleles co-occur in the same fishfarming location, these results support the hypothesis that
the HPR region is the product of template switching during replication (unequal recombination), and opens the
possibility of testing it in controlled experimental settings.
Early indications of recombination in the he gene were
reported in 2001, when researchers looked for topological
incongruence and possible recombination patterns ‘by eye’
within he Norwegian sequences [40]. Interestingly, they
found that recombination was associated with the geographic location of the isolates and that it occurred at
either side of the HPR region. Our results provide statistical support for this initial observation as we detected a
topological incongruence at nucleotide 900 (KH-adjusted
p-value = 2 × 10-4; Figure 1B). We also detected recombination breakpoint signals at either side of the HPR; however, it was not possible to detect parental sequences with
confidence (Rdp, maxchi, chimera and Genconv; Figure
1B). This evidence contradicts the hypothesis of Cunningham et al. [41] that the most plausible mechanism of
recombination is that each HPR comes from partial deletions of precursor HPR0.
Regarding the f gene, we do not detect any recombination breakpoints. At first this was surprising since small
non-homologous fragments have been observed at around
266-276, which might confer novel protease cleavage sites
(IN1-4) and therefore have a fitness impact. We think
there are at least two potential reasons for our inability to
detect recombination in this gene region. First, small fragments are hard to detect with current methods because of
the low information they contain. Second, methods are
not designed to explicitly look for non-homologous
recombination. Also, it would be hard to detect if the INs
are evolutionarily linked to the f gene and/or have similar
substitution rates.
Phylogenetic inference and past population dynamics

In order to estimate phylogenetic relationships, we used
Bayesian phylogenetic methods to test the Chilean outbreak isolates for monophyly, to estimate rates of molecular evolution across the genomes, and estimate divergence
times for clades of particular interest (e.g., geographically
isolated outbreaks). Recombination has detrimental effects
on phylogeny estimation and phylogeny-based analyses
[34,42,43] and thus the recombinant portion of the he
gene was not included in these analyses. Segmented
viruses have the potential to re-assort their segments in
novel combinations, which in phylogenetic terms has the
same effect as recombination. Therefore, we estimated
phylogenies and molecular evolution parameters separately for each gene since concatenating both datasets
would render inaccurate inferences as ISAV might exhibit
reassortment between segments.

In the case of the f gene, the Chilean outbreak clade
was inferred as monophyletic suggesting that ISAV was
introduced once in Chilean fish farming (Figure 2).
However, the he gene tree (additional file 2) shows that
outbreak isolates spread in two clades, i.e., paraphyletic;
one composed of most of the outbreak isolates and the
other composed of three isolates that are also closely
related to isolates from Norway (VT11282007-38/-39
and 2006B13364 in additional file 2). For both genes,
posterior probability support was close or equal to 1,
either for f monophyletic outbreak clade or he paraphyletic outbreak clades. We speculate that this might be
the consequence of reassortment as he genes from Chile
exhibit two evolutionary pathways. Interestingly, the
HPR0 allele (SK779/06HPR0 in Figure 2) is suggested to
be the precursor of all HPR alleles by differential deletion of the polymorphic region [12]. However, in both
gene trees, SK779/06HPR0 (not virulent) does not share
a most recent common ancestor with all the alleles, but
it does for the Chilean outbreak alleles. This result suggests that the ancestor of the HPR0 allele is not necessarily the precursor of all modern HPRs. Nevertheless, this
result agrees with the hypothesis that the ISAV that
finally led to the Chilean outbreak was not virulent [20].
Overall, these results are in rough agreement with previously published phylogenies using other methods.
However, our analysis fully resolved relationships in
crown nodes and allowed us to estimate molecular evolutionary parameters taking into account phylogenetic
and parameter uncertainty. We focused in two events in
the evolutionary history of the virus, the time in which
Norwegian and Chilean isolates diverged, and the time
in which the Chilean epidemic clade expanded. Whether
it was in Norway or in Chile, the most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) between Norwegian and Chilean isolates was estimated to have occurred in 1995 [19921996 95% Highest Probability Density (HPD)] and the
Chilean clade expansion in 2003 (2001-2005 95% HPD)
for the f gene. For the he gene, in turn, the MRCA was
1989 (1982-1994 95% HPD) and 2001 (1996-2004 95%
HPD). This is in agreement with reported distancebased analyses for the f gene but not for the he gene
[20]. However, those methodologies do not provide confidence estimates in a probabilistic framework, which, in
turn, could allow for meaningful comparisons. For
instance, our estimates show that both segments have
different evolutionary histories since they coalesce at
significantly different points back in time (0.83 and 0.94
posterior probabilities for he and f Chilean clades,
respectively). Together with the paraphyly of the he outbreak clade, the results suggest that the ancestor
between Norwegian and Chilean isolates underwent
reassortment of at least both surface protein genes.
Ancestral State Reconstruction (ASR) clearly shows that

Page 5 of 11

Chilean isolates came from Norway as previously
hypothesized and this result is consistent across both
genes (color-coded in Figure 2 and additional file 2).
As other (-) ssRNA viruses, ISAV exhibited extremely
high substitution rates. Similar to influenza viruses, ISAV
replication machinery lacks proofreading activity, which
has been proposed as the increased source of variability
in RNA viruses [33,44]. Accordingly, substitution rates
were estimated at 7.83 × 10-4 substitutions per site per
year (s/s/y) (4.31 × 10-4 - 1.18 × 10-3 95% HPD) for the f
gene and 1.039 × 10 -3 (s/s/y) (3.87 × 10 -4 - 1.86 × 10-3
95% HPD) for the he gene (Figure 2).
An interesting aspect of phylogenetic analyses is to infer
processes from patterns in the time coordinate. We
hypothesized that if ISAV is such a fast-evolving entity, its
genome must contain information that could be used to
infer ecological and/or population processes. For ISAV, we
inferred a population level process of a bottleneck, i.e., a
population going through one or more generations of
small size followed by subsequent population growth, perhaps associated with the outbreak it recently experienced
around 2007 when it was first officially reported in Chile
http://www.sernapesca.cl. We reconstructed generation
time-scaled effective population size (Nef*τ) through time
to see whether or not it is possible to recover that bottleneck using the Bayesian Skyline non-parametric model
(BSP) [45] (Figure 3). Interestingly, the analysis shows a
strong reduction in population size around 2007 followed
by a nearly exponential growth. In particular, the greatest
reduction in population size was inferred from the f gene
and occurred in 2006.42 and 2006.02 for the he gene
(Figure 3). One assumption of analyses based on the coalescent and thus the BSP is that the dataset comprises one
non-structured population. Although not explored in
depth in the literature, population structure, in principle,
could lead to biased estimates of substitution rates and
associated parameters. This, in turn, can produce patterns
in the BSP that reflect changes in the degree of structure
instead of changes in the overall population size, especially
when using a single marker [46,47]. To address this potential problem, we calculated Parsimony Score (PS) and
Association Index (AI) for both genes under study. These
statistics aim to assert the degree of association of a discrete character, geographic location in this case, with a
posterior distribution of trees. Both PS and AI statistics
were significant (p-value < 0.05), suggesting that it is possible to reject the null hypothesis of one non-structured
population. Considering that two independent genes
showed similar patterns, and that the BSP correlates well
with surveillance data, plus the agreement of substitution
rate estimates with others [20,48], we think is safe to
assume that these results reflect a population bottleneck.
Certainly, simulation studies will aid to assert how robust
BSP estimates are to structured populations.

Although controversial, Vike et al. [19] suggested that
the source of ISAV in the Chilean outbreak were infected
eggs brought from Norway, which could be explained by
the fact that until 2008 this country was the main provider
of embryonated eggs http://www.sernapesca.cl. It is clear
that the Chilean outbreak clade has a sister relationship
with Norwegian isolates (closely related to ISAV8 (97/09/
615); see Figure 2), that the basal clades and ancestral
nodes in the phylogeny are from Norway, and that the
tMRCA is around 1989-1996, which matches the date
when egg importation grew from less than 20 million to
50 million imported units http://www.sernapesca.cl. In
addition, the BSP analysis shows that the ISAV population
increased exponentially since 2006, suggesting that the
virus population remained constant since 2001 (tMRCA of
Chilean outbreak clade) and that the outbreak was publicly
reported one year after this predicted population expansion. These results constitute valuable information for fish
health officials to make informed future decisions based
on what contingency measures were implemented at the
time of transmission from Norway to Chile. For instance,
it is very interesting to note that in 2011 the main ISAV
genotype detected in Chile corresponded to HPR0 http://

www.sernapesca.cl. Conversely, HPR7b was nearly 80%
prevalent between epidemic years 2007 and 2008 [20].
This could be attributed to the change of source material
from Norway to Iceland in 2009. For a future study it
would be interesting to address the origin of newly
detected avirulent HPR0 strains that would come from a
country other than Norway.
Selection analysis and structure models

In order to find potentially relevant sites in the primary
sequence of both surface genes and to determine possible
structure-function relations, we used a two-rate FixedEffects likelihood (two-rate FEL) approach to find positively selected sites (dN/dS rate ratio >1). In a gene-based
approach, we found that both genes are evolving under
purifying selection (dN/dS rate ratio <1) as expected for
fast-evolving entities with relatively small genomes
(0.2038 and 0.1382 for he and f genes, respectively).
Using a site-by-site approach, we found that the he
gene has two sites under positive selection within
codons in positions 134 and 340 (Figure 1B; numbering
according to ISAV752 isolate). In the he gene, amino
acid Val/Leu134 is located specifically on the globular

Castro-Nallar et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/349

distal domain (Figure 1A), which is related to HE protein main function, i.e., cell receptor recognition [49].
Amino acid Ser/Arg/Gly/Ala340 lies upstream the HPR
region, located in the stalk of the protein (Figure 1A),
which prompted us to hypothesize that it might be
involved in recombination. Interestingly, the expression
of recombinant ISAV HEΔ 339-351 results in decreased
expression levels, impaired salmon serum recognition,
and hema-adsorption activity. In contrast, HEΔ 349-351
shows normal parameters [49], suggesting that positively
selected amino acid in position 340 is due to its great
importance for HE activity.
We also found three sites under positive selection in
the f gene within codons that code for amino acid residues 130, 170, and 279 (Figure 1F). It was not possible
to reliably model the f gene protein product structure.
However, we were able to map amino acid Ala/Gly/
Thr279, which lies immediately downstream of insertions
(INs) [6]. This constitutes an interesting finding given
that insertions in this region have been reported to confer novel PPPS [15], as outlined in Figure 1F. In addition, Ala/Gly/Thr 279 lies immediately downstream to
Arg 278 (Arg 267 in ISAV fusion without insertion), a
putative cleavage site [17] that has been suggested as a
virulence factor [50]. Conversely, a recent study suggested that substitution of Gln/His 266 to Leu 266 (two
positions upstream to our predicted site) in ISAV fusion
protein without insertion is in association with an
increase of virulence behavior, as seen in Chilean ISAV
901 strain [13,15]. This has epidemiological implications
as isolates carrying these elements would have an advantage compared to those that do not. This finding predicts that the frequency of these alleles will increase in
the populations where they are present, e.g., IN4, which
is only found in Chile with almost 80% prevalence. It
has been suggested that INs close to the cleavage site
exposes this region to the solvent probably helping in
recognition and processing. Our improved model shows
that insertions lie inside the alpha helix structure that is
enlarged with subsequent addition of residues, which
leads to the consequent exposure of PPPSs (Figure 1D
and 1E), in comparison with ISAV901 fusion protein
without insertion (Figure 1C). These findings also support the notion that IN’s serve as virulence determinants. For instance, the unique insertion, IN4, provides
a cleavage site for Asp-N endopeptidase metalloprotease,
which has been detected in the skin mucosa of salmonids [15]. Since the HPR in he as well as the INs in f
are associated with virulence and are also under natural
selection pressure, we think that experimental confirmation of these results will lead to a better understanding
of molecular determinants of pathogenicity for both surface proteins.

Conclusions
In summary, this study investigated the evolutionary history of ISAV, an important economic infection for salmon
culture worldwide. Although less exploited in non-human
diseases, phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses characterize pathogens in space and time, which is perfectly suited for surveillance programs. For instance, identification
of the origin of an outbreak could aid officials in formulating management policies. Though not pursued in this
study, phylogeographic analyses could help identify virus
sources and venues from which pathogens are spreading
into different populations or fisheries. Reconstructing past
population dynamics could help monitor how an infectious agent is changing or reacting to sanitary interventions in terms of its effective population size. Also,
examining molecular sequences for positive selection, all
in a structural context, can identify determinants of virulence or other molecular adaptations.
In this study we found that ISAV, as its relatives, (i)
exhibit a low recombination rate, though recombination
is present in the he surface gene. We hypothesized that
HPR region diversity is governed by recombination probably due to template switching. (ii) We also provided
more evidence in favor of the Norwegian origin hypothesis in a coherent phylogenetic and statistical framework.
Contrary to the widely accepted view [41], (ii) ISAV
HPR0 genotype is not the precursor of all ISAV he genotypes, but appears to share a common ancestor with the
Chilean outbreak clade. Finally, (iv) we identified potential determinants of fitness as identified by being under
positive selection in a structural context; the protein
models allowed us to relate the results of phylogenetic
studies with the predicted structures, which suggest an
important structural function for the predicted positively
selected sites. Our analysis shows that the ISAV outbreak
remained undetected in Chile since 2001 and that the
population started to increase prior to the identification
of the outbreak. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of evolutionary analyses in characterizing temporal, spatial, and
mechanistic aspects of ISAV outbreaks, as well as their
use in predicting future outbreaks of ISAV and other
pathogens. Undoubtedly, collaboration between basic
experimental research and phylogenetic fields will help
understand the dynamics of ISAV spread in space and
time as it has proven fruitful in human health and emerging infectious diseases studies.
Methods
Sequences and alignment

For this study, we focused on the two most abundant
genes available, which also have been linked to virulence
and used extensively for genotyping, namely the Fusion (f)
and Hemagglutinin-esterase (he) genes. Sequences ranging

Castro-Nallar et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:349
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/349

from 1989-2009 were obtained from GenBank according
to several criteria. First, in order to implement a molecular
clock, we selected only full-length sequences with reported
isolation dates. Second, we only used isolates for which
both target genes were sequenced. After these criteria
were applied, seventy full-length sequences from each
gene were retrieved from GenBank (accession numbers in
additional file 3) from strains isolated in Canada, Norway,
and Chile (alignment in additional file 1). To avoid alignment artifacts and to come up with an optimal statement
of homology, nucleotide sequences were visualized in Seaview 4.2.7 [51] and then converted to amino acid
sequences for alignment with MAFFT [52] under L-INS-i
algorithm, thereby preserving the open reading frame for
these protein coding sequences. Amino acid sequences
were then back translated into their original nucleotide
sequences for further analyses.

and the trace itself. Strict molecular clock was rejected
on the basis of Bayes Factor hypothesis testing between
uncorrelated lognormal clock (H1) and strict clock (H0)
as implemented in Tracer [62]. A lognormal prior with a
mean centered on the reported Influenza A HA gene substitution rate [26] and tip dates were used to calibrate the
clock. The same analysis was run ‘on empty’ to assess the
influence of the selected priors. Estimating Association
Index (AI), Parsimony Score (PS), and Maximum Clade
number (MC) statistics tested the extent of geographic
structure in BaTS [63]. Past population dynamics of both
genes were inferred using the Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP)
model as a tree prior [45]. Ancestral State Reconstruction
(ASR) was estimated used the method of Lemey et al. [64]
implemented in BEAST as described online http://beast.
bio.ed.ac.uk/Tutorials#Phylogeography_tutorials
Selection analyses and structure models

Genetic diversity and recombination

Genetic diversity (θ) within populations was estimated
both by the traditional segregating sites approach of Watterson [53] (implemented in DnaSP5 [54]) and by a coalescent Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method
(BMCMC [55]; implemented in Lamarc 2.1.3 [56]).
Recombination breakpoint analysis was performed under a
suit of methods looking for different types of recombination evidence (Rdp, Genconv, MaxChi, Chimaera as primary methods and Bootscanning and Siscan as secondary
(summarized in [57]) as implemented in Rdp3 [39]. Windows and step sizes were varied to refine primary evidence
of recombination as suggested in the user manual. In addition, recombination detection was performed on both
genes by using a genetic algorithm approach looking at
topological incongruence (GARD) [58] as implemented in
the http://datamonkey.org[59] server.
Phylogenetic inference, molecular clock, substitution rates
and demographic history

The best-fit model of evolution was selected under
Akaike information Criterion [27] (AIC) and parameter
values using model averaging as implemented in jModelTest 1.0.1 [60]. The best-fit model was used for subsequent analyses; nevertheless, base frequencies and rates
were co-estimated with the phylogeny. A phylogenetic
tree was inferred using Bayesian Inference (BI) as optimality criterion as implemented in the Beast 1.6.1 package
[61]. Posterior probabilities (PP) were approximated by
running four independent analyses of 1 × 10 8 steps
sampled every 1 × 10 5 each. A burn-in period was
defined using Tracer [57] by testing for convergence on
likelihood scores. Burn-in was defined as the period
before convergence and those runs were discarded
accordingly. Also, we assessed convergence and mixing
by checking the effective sample size statistic (ESS > 500)

Both genes, he and f, were investigated for evidence of
positive selection. First, a global analysis was performed
using a counting method (SLAC). Then, a site-by-site
analysis was performed using Fixed-Effects likelihood
method as implemented in HyPhy 2.0 [65,66]. Differences
in selective pressures between the Chilean clade and the
rest of the tree were estimated with SelectionLRT.bf
script also within the HyPhy 2.0 package.
To assess whether selected sites lay on structural and
functionally relevant regions of proteins, f and he 3D
structure models were build using the following protocol.
The sequences of the he and the f genes were obtained
from GenBank (ADF36510.1; ABG65799.1; AAX46277.1;
AAX46259.1; ADF36509.1 and ADF36499.1). Alignments
for HE protein were obtained by modeler 9v9 [67], and for
F the server CLUSTALW was used [68]. To verify that the
alignments were suitable, we used the secondary structure
prediction server PSIPRED http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/
psipred/[69]. In order to generate the F protein model, we
used two templates: hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein structure of influenza C virus (PDB ID: 1FLC)
(3.20Å) and hemagglutinin-fusion glycoprotein structure
of influenza A virus (PDB ID: 3EYJ) (2.60 Å), with identities of 21% and 20%, respectively. For the HE protein
model, we used hemagglutinin-esterase fusion glycoprotein structure of influenza C virus (PDB ID: 1FLC) with
19% identity as template. Finally, both models were minimized (50,000 steps) and a trajectory of 1 ns was obtained
by molecular dynamics using the CHARMM force field
[70] in NAMD program [71]. The quality of the models
was tested by the Anolea server [72].
