Abstract
Background: The TRIM family is composed of multi-domain proteins that display the Tripartite
Motif (RING, B-box and Coiled-coil) that can be associated with a C-terminal domain. TRIM genes
are involved in ubiquitylation and are implicated in a variety of human pathologies, from Mendelian
inherited disorders to cancer, and are also involved in cellular response to viral infection.
Results: Here we defined the entire human TRIM family and also identified the TRIM sets of other
vertebrate (mouse, rat, dog, cow, chicken, tetraodon, and zebrafish) and invertebrate species
(fruitfly, worm, and ciona). By means of comparative analyses we found that, after assembly of the
tripartite motif in an early metazoan ancestor, few types of C-terminal domains have been
associated with this module during evolution and that an important increase in TRIM number
occurred in vertebrate species concomitantly with the addition of the SPRY domain. We showed
that the human TRIM family is split into two groups that differ in domain structure, genomic
organization and evolutionary properties. Group 1 members present a variety of C-terminal
domains, are highly conserved among vertebrate species, and are represented in invertebrates.
Conversely, group 2 is absent in invertebrates, is characterized by the presence of a C-terminal
SPRY domain and presents unique sets of genes in each mammal examined. The generation of
independent sets of group 2 genes is also evident in the other vertebrate species. Comparing the
murine and human TRIM sets, we found that group 1 and 2 genes evolve at different speeds and
are subject to different selective pressures.
Conclusion: We found that the TRIM family is composed of two groups of genes with distinct
evolutionary properties. Group 2 is younger, highly dynamic, and might act as a reservoir to develop
novel TRIM functions. Since some group 2 genes are implicated in innate immune response, their
evolutionary features may account for species-specific battles against viral infection.

Background
The TRIM gene family encodes proteins involved in a
broad range of biological processes and characterized by
the presence of the tripartite motif (hence the name
TRIM), which consists of a RING domain, one or two Bbox motifs and a Coiled-coil region (RBCC) [1,2]. The tripartite motif is always present at the N-terminus of the
TRIM proteins. The order of the domains that compose
the motif is also conserved: a RING finger domain precedes the B-box motif(s), and a Coiled-coil (CC) region
invariably follows. Even if one of the domains is missing,
the order of the remaining ones is maintained. Different
C-terminal domains are associated with the tripartite
motif in the TRIM family [1-4].
Both RING and B-boxes are cysteine-rich zinc-binding
domains. The RING finger domain is present, in combination with other domains, in hundreds of proteins and is
defined by a linear series of conserved cysteine and histidine residues that represent zinc coordination sites [5].
The B-boxes are the critical determinants of the TRIM family and can be present as B-box1 and B-box2, which share
a similar but distinct pattern of cysteine and histidine residues [1]. When both B-box domains are present, type 1
always precedes type 2; when only one B-box domain is
present, it is always type 2 [1]. While the tripartite motif is
restricted to this protein family, the C-terminal domains
are also found in unrelated proteins. A limited choice of
C-terminal domains is found in association with the tripartite motif and determined the recent classification of
the TRIM proteins in subfamilies [4]. This conserved
multi-domain structure appears to behave as an integrated
module, rather than a collection of separate motifs, suggesting a possible common function [1,6].

tively [15,16]. TRIM32 is involved in both a form of muscular dystrophy and a form of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome
(BBS11), and MURF-1 is implicated in muscular atrophy
[17-19]. Ro52 is the target antigen of auto-antibodies in
both Sjogren syndrome and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus [20]. Finally, TRIM5α has been identified as the major
factor restricting HIV-1 during the early phase of infection
in Old World monkey cells [3,21].
The TRIM family represents one of the largest classes of
putative single protein RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases,
strongly suggesting that the tripartite motif was selectively
maintained to carry out a specialized basic common function within the ubiquitylation process. We used a
genomic approach to complete the identification of all
human TRIM genes and to study their evolutionary relationships in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. We
observed a general paradigm for the evolution of this family and propose a possible relationship between the evolution of TRIM genes and that of their function.

Results

We previously classified 35 human RBCC-containing proteins as a gene-protein family and named it TRIM. We
observed that these proteins have strong self-association
ability, mainly mediated by their CC region, which results
in the formation of large protein complexes. In most cases
the TRIM proteins identify different discrete nuclear and/
or cytoplasmic sub-cellular structures [1].

Defining the complete set of TRIM genes in humans and
other mammals
To search for all TRIM genes in humans, mouse, rat, cow,
and dog, we screened their genomic sequences, using all
known mammalian TRIM sequences as queries, with the
BLAST and BLAT algorithms at the NCBI and UCSC
genome browsers. We also performed a Pattern-Hit Initiated-Blast (PHI-Blast) search against both redundant and
non-redundant databases using the sequence patterns that
we previously defined for the two B-box domains as query
[1]. In addition, we used representative B-box1 and Bbox2 sequences to perform TBLASTN genome screening
aimed at identifying all the potential loci encoding for Bbox-containing proteins. Each retrieved genomic
sequence was compared to available EST/cDNA sequences
to infer gene architecture. For those genes that lacked a
transcript counterpart, we performed a careful manual
examination of the genomic sequences by aligning them
to the most closely related TRIM of the same or other species to define exon boundaries.

The presence of the RING domain and recent experimental evidence indicate that these proteins can act as E3
ubiquitin ligases, the proteins responsible for mediating
the transfer of the ubiquitin moiety to the specific targets
[7-10]. Alteration of their activity within ubiquitylation
processes might be responsible for the clinical manifestation observed in human diseases caused by mutations in
TRIM genes [3,6]. PML, RFP, TIF, and EFP are implicated
in tumor insurgence and progression [11-14]. Other TRIM
genes are involved in Mendelian inherited disorders:
MID1 and MUL are altered in two developmental genetic
diseases, Opitz Syndrome and Mulibrey nanism, respec-

By combining these methods in several iterations, we
retrieved the entire set of human TRIM genes. While most
of these have been recently reported in the context of
other studies, we also report some novel TRIM genes
[3,4,22] (http://TRIMbase.tigem.it). Some of the genes we
found are present as perfect or almost perfect multiple
duplications in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 11 and it is difficult in these cases to establish
whether they represent expressed genes (see also below).
We also annotated the TRIM complement in mouse, rat,
cow, and dog. The inventory of these sets and their comparisons are available at (http://TRIMbase.tigem.it).

Domain composition of human TRIM proteins
The majority of the human proteins reported in http://
TRIMbase.tigem.it fulfill the TRIM rule of domain order
and composition (RING, B-box(es), CC, C-terminal
domain(s)). During our searches, we also found genes
encoding 'incomplete' TRIM proteins, i.e. lacking one of
the domains present within the tripartite motif (RING, Bbox, or CC). Differently from the RING and CC domains,
our analysis clearly indicated that B-box domains are virtually always present within the tripartite motif in metazoans. However, there are a few exceptions in which the Bbox(es) domain is associated with only one of the
domains belonging to the tripartite motif: in humans 6
proteins that possess B-box(es) lack the RING domain (Bbox and CC) and 2 have a very short sequence after the Bbox and almost entirely lack the CC region (RING and Bbox).

In the evolutionary analyses reported in this study we
included the 68 genes listed in Table 1: the 'orthodox'
TRIM genes and the 8 'incomplete' TRIM genes or TRIMlike genes (possessing the B-box domain associated with
either the CC or the RING domains). The 'incomplete'
TRIM-like genes are included in Table 1 and mentioned
within the text with their non-TRIM names to remark their
non full adherence to the strict definition of TRIM member; within the databases they are also annotated with a
TRIM name, which is reported (Table 1). Moreover, of the
chromosome 11 pericentromeric clusters we included in
the analyses only representative members.
With the identification of the entire complement of the
human TRIM and TRIM-like family, we confirmed and
extended the domain composition features of these proteins. Within the TRIM modular structure we found that
the spacing between adjacent domains is conserved. In
fact, the distance between the RING domain and the first
B-box, either type 1 or type 2, ranges from 35 to 55 residues; the distance between the two B-box domains ranges
from 13 to 20 amino acids; and the spacing, partly occupied by the CC region, between the B-box2 and the C-terminal domain is usually 170–220 residue-long. The
maintenance of the domain scaffold, order and spacing
clearly indicates that the TRIM structure is a functional
module.
The Tripartite Motif
We aligned the sequences of the RING finger domain of
all human TRIM proteins to define a general TRIM-specific RING pattern (Additional file 1). Besides the cysteine
and histidine residues, which coordinate the two zinc
atoms, we found clear preferences for specific residues in
positions that are probably required to maintain the
cross-brace structure of the RING domain [23]. The loop
delimited by the second and third Cys residues has a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/225

tighter length range within the TRIM family (on average
11 residues) than within other RING-containing proteins
[5]. The second loop, bounded by Cys6 and Cys7, is frequently longer than the 48 residues of the general RING
consensus [5]. The RING domain has been associated
with the ubiquitylation process and is mainly responsible
for the interaction with the ubiquitin conjugating
enzymes (E2) in the ubiquitylation cascade process [7].
The different length and composition of the intervening
sequences of the RING loops may underlie the binding
specificity towards the different E2 enzymes.
The comparison of the B-box domains from all TRIM and
TRIM-like sequences confirmed that the pattern of Cys
and His is similar, although clearly distinct, in the two
types of B-boxes (Additional file 1) [1,2]. The B-box1 has
a short and tight consensus in which, besides the Cys and
His that coordinate two atoms of zinc [24], only two positions show a clear preference for a limited choice of residues. B-box2 sequences are longer than type 1 and their
consensus is looser. The cysteine and histidine residues at
all 8 possible coordination positions are highly conserved
consistent with the recently reported B-box2 structure definition that revealed the coordination of 2 zinc atoms [25]
in contrast with previous data [26]. Moreover, additional
non-polar or hydrophobic residues are also maintained in
defined positions. Twenty-two out of 60 TRIM and 8
TRIM-like proteins possess both B-boxes, with B-box1
always preceding B-box2, whilst the remaining proteins
have a single type 2 B-box domain (Table 1).
We observed that the third component of the tripartite
motif, the Coiled-coil (CC) region, follows the B-box2 in
all bona fide human TRIM proteins as well as in six of the
eight TRIM-like proteins. Only RNF101/TRIM48* and
RNF102/TRIM52* do not possess this Coiled-coil region
as they are truncated immediately after the B-box2. In all
other cases, the CC region is always confined within 120
amino acids from the end of the B-box2 domain and in
approximately 50% of the human TRIM proteins is bipartite (Additional file 2).
TRIM C-terminal domains
The C-terminal domains found in the TRIM and TRIMlike family members are not an exclusive property of this
family but are also present in otherwise unrelated proteins
[1,4]. The definition of the full complement of human
TRIM and TRIM-like proteins allowed us to update the
occurrence of C-terminal domains displayed by these proteins (Table 1).

The majority of the human TRIM and TRIM-like proteins
(40 members) possess either the SPRY domain or the
association of PRY and SPRY domain, also known as
B30.2 or RFP-like domain. Table 1 reports the presence of

the PRY and SPRY domains that we found using the
domain detection tools described in Methods and
detailed in the legend but, due to the complicated and still
debated relationship between PRY-SPRY and B30.2
domains, we will herein simply refer to them as SPRY [2729]. The SPRY domain in turn can be associated with
Fibronectin type III repeat (FN3) [30] and COS microtubule binding domain in different combinations [4]. Five
TRIM proteins display NHL and IGFLMN domains, either
in association or alone [31,32]. TRIM56 C-terminal
region shares sequence similarity with this domain
although no clear NHL repeats are detected. Three TRIM
and one TRIM-like proteins contain a PHD associated
with a BROMO domain, a combination that was demonstrated to cooperate in nucleosome binding [33]. Other
domains are present in only one member of the TRIM
family: the MATH domain in TRIM37; the ARF domain in
TRIM23; and the EXOIII domain in TRIM19/PML
[16,34,35]. Fifteen TRIM and TRIM-like proteins do not
possess a defined C-terminal domain. In these cases,
either their coding region is limited to the tripartite motif
or the C-terminal portion is not similar to any other
known domains (Table 1).
This comprehensive review of TRIM and TRIM-like associated C-terminal domains confirmed that a discrete
number of motifs have been selected downstream of the
tripartite motif in humans.
The TRIM modular structure is metazoan-specific
To trace back in evolution the origin of the TRIM family,
we used human B-box1 and B-box2 sequences as queries
to investigate the occurrence of these domains in the
genomes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic representative species. We did not find any sequences similar to the B-box
domains in prokaryotes. B-box sequences are present in
plants with a consensus that is more similar to B-box1
than B-box2 (Fig. 1A). We examined 50 B-box containing
proteins from 4 plant species (A. thaliana, O. sativa, P. sativum, B. nigra): the B-box is found alone or associated with
a second B-box, with the CCT (CONSTANS, CO-like, and

TOC1) domain [36], or with both. Differently from mammals, proximal and distal plant B-boxes (we analyzed a
total of 60 B-box sequences) are very similar to each other
and, consistently, do not separate in distinct branches in
phylogenetic analysis (data not shown). No association
with RING or Coiled-coil domains was detected in all the
plant proteins analyzed.
Besides plants and metazoans, we found B-box domains
in some unicellular eukaryotes (unpublished observation). These protist species possess B-box domains that
resemble either the plant or metazoan consensi, but the
difficulty in attributing these lineages to specific clades
compounds the tracing of the evolution of their B-box
domain. In addition, since many of these protists are parasites of metazoans, we cannot rule out the possibility
that horizontal gene transfer might have occurred [37].
Among the metazoans we also searched the genomes of
two invertebrate species, Drosophila melanogaster and
Caenorhabditis elegans, for the presence of B-box domains.
Distinct proximal (B-box1) and distal (B-box2) domains
are found in these species, sharing with mammals the
same B-box1 pattern and a similar B-box2 consensus (Fig.
1A). The B-box domains in these species associate with a
RING domain and a Coiled-coil region in a tripartite
motif as in mammals. The tripartite motif is therefore
exclusive to metazoans, despite the fact that its constitutive elements are not.
However, these invertebrate organisms have TRIM complements that differ significantly from mammals: the
fruitfly has 7 TRIM genes and the worm 18, 12 of which
code only for a Tripartite motif (Fig. 1B). Fruitfly and
worm TRIM proteins share many of the C-terminal
domains found in humans, however, their proportion
varies among these species, highlighting lineage-specific
expansions, e.g. SPRY in humans (Fig. 1B).

TRIM domains in evolution
TRIM domains in evolution. A) Logo representation of the sequences of Plant B-box (60 B-box sequences; representative species: A. thaliana, O. sativa, P. sativum, B. nigra); Metazoan B-box1 (all the B-box1 sequences in representative species: H. sapiens,
D. melanogaster, and C. elegans); Mammalian B-box2 (all B-box2 sequences in representative species: H. sapiens) and Invertebrate B-box2 (all B-box2 sequences in representative species: D. melanogaster, and C. elegans). The overall height of each position is proportional to its information content and, within a given position, the conservation of each residue is represented as
the relative height of amino acid symbols. Shaded columns indicate the residues involved in the coordination of zinc atoms.
Blue bars represent amino acid segments of variable length; the mean value for each segment is reported. Red bars represent
segments of fixed amino acid length that are present only in a proportion (indicated in red above the bar) of proteins. B) TRIM
complements of humans, fruitfly (D. melanogaster) and worm (C. elegans). The total number of TRIM and TRIM-like genes in
each species is indicated (top). The presence of the TRIM associated C-terminal domains is indicated with the same color code
(bottom). The length of each bar in the bottom part is proportional to the number (also indicated) of the relative TRIM C-terminal domains found in each species.

The human TRIM family can be subdivided in two distinct
groups: group 1 and group 2
Given the numerical and structural complexity of TRIM
genes in humans, we sought to characterize the relatedness among members of the family. The presence of different combinations of domains characterized by spaced
cysteine and histidine residues rendered a global and reliable alignment of all TRIM and TRIM-like proteins along
their entire length difficult. We therefore performed an
initial alignment using the B-box2 and Coiled-coil portion. The unrooted phylogenetic tree generated from this
alignment supports a recent expansion of the genes that

contain the SPRY domain and suggests a preliminary separation of the human TRIM proteins in two main groups
based on domain composition and branch topology (Fig.
2). Group 1, composed of 34 proteins (29 TRIM and 5
TRIM-like proteins), includes a high proportion of members with a RING-B1-B2-CC module in combination with
all the C-terminal domains found in TRIM proteins.
Group 2 is composed of the remaining 34 proteins (31
TRIM and 3 TRIM-like proteins), which possess only the
B-box2 domain and are mostly organized as RING-B2CC-SPRY; the 5 proteins of this group that lack the SPRY
domain consist of the tripartite motif alone (Fig. 2).

The alignment of either single or combination of domains
that compose the tripartite motif produces similar tree
topologies (Additional file 3). This suggests that co-evolution of the domains present within the tripartite motif has

occurred, i. e. this module mainly evolved as a single
block, with no evidence of large rearrangements leading
to domain acquisition or swapping among different TRIM
family members; the only exceptions are the incomplete

TRIM proteins that have lost one of the tripartite motif
domain.
We investigated whether the two groups show differences
at the level of their genomic organization. Considering
solely the coding region, group 2 genes span on average
10.3 kbp split in 5.7 coding exons compared to the 45.4
kbp and 8.3 exons of the genes that belong to group 1, differences that are statistically significant (P < 0.01 for gene
length and exon number). Besides the average values, the
homogeneity of group 2 with respect to these two parameters is striking. In fact, group 2 gene lengths range from
1.4 to 27 kbp, with only 2 genes larger than 20 kbp,
whereas group 1 genes are distributed within a larger
range, 1.2 to 143 kbp. Homogeneity of group 2 is also
observed for the distribution of the number of coding
exons: about two thirds of group 2 TRIM genes are composed of 6 or 7 exons and only in one case they span over
10 exons; again the distribution for group 1 is broader,
ranging from 1 to 20 exons.
Taken together, group 2 genes are smaller and less complex than group 1. Interestingly, several group 2 genes are
clustered in small chromosomal regions, especially within
the Major Histocompatibilty Complex region in 6p21.33
(Table 1 and Additional file 4) [38,39]. The high homogeneity of group 2 genes and their organization in clusters
suggest a more recent origin of this group.
Group 2 TRIM genes evolve more rapidly than group 1
To investigate whether group 1 and 2 have different evolutionary dynamics, we compared the members of the
human TRIM and TRIM-like set to their mouse counterparts (see http://TRIMbase.tigem.it and below for the definition of orthologous pairs). Ten out of 60 human TRIM
and 8 TRIM-like genes (TRIM4, 5, 22, 43, 48*, 49, 52*, 64,
73, 74) do not have a murine ortholog, whereas TRIM31,
15, 20, and 61 are divergent at the level of entire domains
compared to the mouse. Interestingly, these 14 non-conserved or divergent genes fall within group 2 and represent
an important proportion of this group (41%). Conversely,
all human group 1 genes have a mouse ortholog.

The degree of conservation of the remaining 54 human/
mouse pairs is highly variable, ranging from 49% to more
than 99% amino acid identity (peptide comparisons are
available at http://TRIMbase.tigem.it). Group 2 pairs
present on average 78% amino acid identity versus 89.2%
of group 1 (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the majority of group
1 proteins show 90–100% amino acid identity against
50–90% of most group 2 proteins (Fig. 3A).
Fast-evolving genes tend to have a higher ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) to
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) than

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/225

the slow-evolving ones. The average Ka/Ks ratio between
human and rodent coding sequences is 0.18 [40]. We analyzed the Ka/Ks ratio in human-mouse TRIM and TRIMlike orthologous pairs and found that group 1 genes
present on average a ratio of 0.13 versus 0.29 of group 2
(P < 0.01). The Ka/Ks distribution is also significantly different (P = 0.01091) between the two groups: the majority
of group 1 genes display values below 0.1 while most of
group 2 show values above 0.1 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore,
only members of group 2 (TRIM38, 40, 60, 75) exceed a
Ka/Ks ratio value of 0.5 (Fig. 3B).
Taken together, our analyses indicate that group 2 genes
evolve more rapidly compared to group 1. This suggests
that the two groups may be subject to different evolutionary constraints, likely underlying species-specific adaptations.
Group 2 is absent in invertebrates and includes speciesspecific genes in mammals
Preliminary rounds of sequence alignment and evolutionary analyses allowed us to divide the TRIM and TRIM-like
family members into major classes and subsequently generate their phylogenetic trees separately using the fulllength protein sequences from man, mouse, fruitfly and
worm (see Methods for details). The results show that
these proteins are evolutionarily organized in two groups
that coincide with group 1 and group 2 (Fig. 4 and 5). The
only discrepancy with the previous subdivision is
TRIM62, which segregates with group 2 proteins in the
evolutionary analysis. Within group 1, TRIM37 did not
segregate with any subgroups in preliminary studies and
therefore it was used as an outgroup in all phylogenetic
analyses.

Group 1 is further divided into subgroups that grossly
match with the domains downstream of the tripartite
motif (Fig. 4). This analysis confirms that members of
group 1 are present in both human and mouse with a
strict 1:1 orthologous correspondence and are represented
in invertebrates (Fig. 4). By means of this phylogenetic
analysis we could appreciate better the mammals-invertebrates TRIM relationship and, since the worm and the
fruitfly possess many of the C-terminal domains present
in mammals, we could follow the late evolution of the
TRIM modular structure as discussed below. Interestingly,
no invertebrate sequences are found to be homologous to
members of group 1 subgroup E, which includes TRIM
and TRIM-like proteins with B1, B2, and SPRY in various
combinations (Fig. 4E and Table 1). Group 2 proteins are
not represented in invertebrate species as well, and have
either a complete or a truncated RING-B2-CC-SPRY
domain composition (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The major
structural difference between subgroup E and group 2 is
the presence of the B-box1, which indicates that group 2

Figure
proteins4
Phylogenetic analysis of human (h, blue), mouse (m, blue), fruitfly (CGs, red), and worm (green) group 1 TRIM and TRIM-like
proteins. Human and mouse TRIM proteins are indicated with their TRIM numbers; 'incomplete' TRIM proteins are indicated
with their alternative TRIM number with an asterisk (see Table 1); fruitfly and worm sequences are indicated with GenBank
accession numbers. Bootstrap support values above 50% based on 1000 replicates are shown. The main domain distal to the
tripartite motif is indicated on the right; ND indicates no known domain detected. Panels A-E show the evolutionary relationships among the members of TRIM subgroups that belong to group 1; the worm TRIM genes composed of the R-B2-CC motif
only (Figure 2B) represent a separate group related to group 1 and are not shown in the figure. TRIM37 (C-terminal domain:
MATH) did not segregated within any subgroups in preliminary analyses and was therefore used as an outgroup in all phylogenetic analyses. The trees were drawn to the scale of amino acid sequence divergence indicated at the bottom right corner. A)
Subgroup A includes FN3 and FN3-related TRIM sequences. Fruitfly CG31721 and its worm ortholog C39F7 are the only
invertebrate proteins present in the FN3 subgroup and segregate with mammalian TRIM9 and 67. B) Subgroup B includes ARFrelated TRIM sequences. Genes encoding a protein homologous to TRIM23 are found in worm and in the honeybee Apis mellifera (ENS10667 = ENSAPMT00000010667) but not in D. melanogaster, suggesting that the ARF domain has been acquired by a
tripartite-gene precursor before vertebrate-invertebrate lineage separation, and has occasionally been lost in some species. C)
Subgroup C includes PHD-BROMO and PHD-BROMO-related TRIM sequences. Fruitfly CG5206 behaves as an outgroup for
all human and mouse PHD-BROMO proteins, suggesting that it may be regarded as an ortholog of their protein ancestor. D)
Subgroup D includes IGFLMN-related TRIM sequences. This subgroup is the only example of TRIM expansion in invertebrates,
because it includes worm and fly genes that do not have any direct correspondent in mammals. E) Subgroup E includes TRIM
proteins with B1, B2, and SPRY in various combinations (see Table 1). No invertebrate sequences are found within this subgroup.
proteins could have derived from a subgroup E member
upon loss of B-box1.
Interestingly, the evolutionary analysis of group 2 proteins showed, in addition to 24 pairs of orthologs, the
presence of species-specific TRIM and TRIM-like proteins,
not only in humans (see above) but also in mouse (Fig.
5), indicating high dynamicity in the evolution of this
group compared to group 1.
The analysis of the TRIM and TRIM-like complements of
rat, cow, and dog showed that these species have the same
set of group 1 genes as humans and mouse. Conversely,
the sets of group 2 genes are different and specific to each
species, including closely related ones such as mouse and
rat, with only 17 genes (50–70% of group 2 genes) shared
among all species (http://TRIMbase.tigem.it). These differences are due to events of gene duplication, deletion, or
degeneration that likely occurred during the evolution of
each single lineage. Remarkably, in three cases the same
gene has undergone degeneration or deletion independently in different lineages: human TRIM38 orthologs,
found in mouse and cow, are pseudogenes in rat and dog;
human TRIM60 has orthologous loci in all the examined
mammals but has become pseudogenes in rat, cow, and
dog; human TRIM61 orthologs are found to be pseudogenes or absent in all organisms but mouse. Furthermore,
two TRIM genes are present in the five species in three different states: TRIM15 is intact in human and cow, presents
premature stop codons in mouse and rat, and is a pseudogene in dog; similarly, TRIM31 is intact in mouse and rat,
has distal frameshifts in humans and cow, and is absent in
dog. Both premature stop codons and frameshifts result in
truncated proteins that have lost the SPRY domain. These

losses may represent a degenerative step towards the complete inactivation of these genes.
Of note, massive gene duplications and rearrangements
had occurred at the level of several genes of group 2 that
cluster in the same chromosomal location (Table 1). A
thorough characterization of the TRIM-rich 6p21.33 locus
is reported in human and chicken [39,41,42]. Indeed, in
addition to the human genes here presented, extra-copies
of group 2 genes TRIM43, 48*, 49, and 64 are clustered at
2q11.1, 11q11.1, and 11q14.3 for a total of 11 predicted
genes and 14 pseudogenes. These clustered loci have paralogs, but not orthologs, in some of the other examined
mammalian species (http://TRIMbase.tigem.it).
A further example of recent gene evolution is the genomic
cluster at 11p15.4 containing TRIM5, a gene involved in
HIV-1 viral restriction in some primates [21]. This cluster
includes TRIM5 and 22, which are currently considered
primate-specific, in addition to TRIM6 and 34, which are
not [43,44]. By means of comparative and evolutionary
analyses (Additional file 5) we found that the entire cluster, including TRIM5 and 22, was present in the last common ancestor of humans, cow, and dog, supporting a
common origin for TRIM5 and its cow functional
ortholog LOC516599 rather than evolutionary convergence as previously proposed [43].
TRIM genes in other vertebrate species
Given the situation in mammals, we asked whether the
TRIM complements evolved likewise in other vertebrate
species. We searched the databases for TRIM and TRIMlike sequences in representative aves and fish species,

Phylogenetic analysis of human (h) and mouse (m) TRIM and TRIM-like proteins from Group 2
Phylogenetic analysis of human (h) and mouse (m) TRIM and TRIM-like proteins from Group 2. TRIM proteins are indicated
with their TRIM number ('incomplete' TRIM proteins are indicated with their alternative TRIM number with an asterisk, see
Table 1). No invertebrate TRIM proteins are represented in this group. Bootstrap support values above 50% based on 1000
replicates are shown. Group 1 TRIM37 sequences are used as outgroup. The scale of amino acid sequence divergence is indicated at the bottom right corner. Twenty-four pairs of orthologs can be identified (gray-shadowed branches). The remaining
proteins can be subdivided in three different types, based on the phylogenetic relationship with their neighbors: (i) Proteins
that are present only in one species and apparently started to diverge from their paralogs before human-mouse split (green
clades); (ii) Clades of paralogous proteins that are present only in human and share a single homologous counterpart in mouse
(red-shadowed branches); (iii) Clades of paralogous proteins that are present only in mouse and do not have any obvious
homologous counterpart in humans (blue-shadowed branches).
chick (Gallus gallus) and a pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), respectively. In addition, we included in our analysis the urochordata Ciona intestinalis, a representative of
the early chordate lineage from which the vertebrates originated. The searches were performed combining different
iterations of PHI-BLAST (using the B-box2 pattern) and
TBLASTN and BLASTP against nr protein and nucleotide
databases at NCBI, starting from both human TRIM proteins and TRIM sequences found in the above species. We
found 10 TRIM sequences in ciona, 37 in chick and 58 in
pufferfish; all the sequences we retrieved were present in
the databases as assessed or predicted genes and only
some of them (especially in chicken) were already annotated as TRIM genes (the sequences retrieved for these species are reported at http://TRIMbase.tigem.it). These novel
TRIM complements should not necessarily be regarded as
complete since in these species there are still regions not
yet sequenced or unequivocally assembled. We compared
these additional vertebrate sequences to the human
sequences using multiple protein alignments and phylogenetic tree constructions using as a paradigm the subdivision into groups and subgroups of Figure 4 and 5.
Detailed analyses of these novel genes, at the level of transcript, protein and genomic locus, are required and will be
addressed elsewhere, therefore the phylogenetic analyses
we present show relationships and are not intended to
represent precise evolutionary distances.
In all species analyzed, we found clear orthologs for
TRIM23 and TRIM37 (Fig. 6A). With respect to subgroup
C, there is one representative of this subgroup in ciona,
closely related to the fruitfly member. All the known
mammalian members of this subgroup are found in chick
with recognizable orthologous relationships (Fig. 6B).
This is not completely true for tetraodon in which 3 members belonging to this group have been found: one orthologous to TRIM33 and the others representing fish-specific
duplications related to the TRIM33-24 clade. Genes
strictly related to KIAA0298/TRIM66* and TRIM19 have
not been found in tetraodon (Fig. 6B). In ciona there are
5 representative members of subgroup A, 3 representing
the ancestors of different subclades (TRIM9-67; TRIM1-

18; TRIM54-55-63) and 2 apparently more ancestral
genes. DIBP/TRIM44* appears to be uniquely represented
in mammals. All the other members are present in chick
and fish although orthology is clear only for TRIM9, 67, 1,
18, and 36. TRIM46, if truly absent, may have been lost in
chick while of the MURF group (TRIM54, 55, 63) 2 orthologues are present in chick while 4 members with no
direct orthologous relationship are present in fish (Fig.
6C). An analogous situation is observed for subgroup D.
In fact, ciona has two representative members; orthologous relationship with human is observed for both chick
and fish for four members (TRIM2, 3, 45, 71). TRIM32
might have been lost in chick and TRIM56 in both chick
and fish (Fig. 6D). For the above group 1 subgroups, we
therefore found that most of the mammalian components
are present in chick often with clearly recognizable orthologous relationship. Although the number of members
within these subgroups is similar also in tetraodon, the
TRIM and TRIM-like genes in this species, consistent with
a larger evolutionary distance, have duplicated and
diverged more extensively, sometimes obscuring orthologies.
A different situation is observed with the group 1 subgroup E and, as expected, with group 2. As for the other
invertebrates, ciona genes are not represented in this subgroup and in group 2. Orthologous relationship among
mammals, chick and fish is observed only for two genes of
subgroup E (ATDC/TRIM29* and TRIM65). The other
genes within the subgroup are more conserved in chicken
while in tetraodon many independent duplication events
occurred (Fig. 6E). Even more extensive duplication
events and independent divergences are observed for
group 2 genes. In this case, close homology among the
three species is only recognizable for TRIM35 and 62. A
couple of other mammalian TRIM genes are conserved in
chick (TRIM7 and 41) but the remaining genes in the
three species have been subjected to independent duplications and evolution (Fig. 6F).
To confirm in fish the presence of so many TRIM
sequences poorly related to the human TRIM genes, we

search TRIM and TRIM-like genes also in zebrafish (Danio
rerio) using the same criteria and methods described for
the chick and tetraodon. Differently from tetraodon,
zebrafish presents an elevated number of TRIM and TRIMlike genes; we found 240 entries corresponding to independent genes (the list of zebrafish genes is reported at
http://TRIMbase.tigem.it). Also in this case, the number
of genes encoding for group 1 TRIM (excluding subgroup
E) is comparable to the number in mammals, chick and
pufferfish (1 subgroup B; 5 subgroup C; 16 subgroup A;
12 subgroup D) although in many cases clear duplication
events occurred. However, the great expansion of the
TRIM genes in the zebrafish is associated with members
belonging to the group 1 subgroup E and group 2 genes
(data not shown).
Analyses of TRIM complements in aves and fish corroborate the high conservation of group 1 genes during evolution and highlight the generation of unique sets of group
2 genes in each vertebrate species analyzed. Moreover, the
data in non-mammalian vertebrates, especially in tetraodon, confirm that members of the group 1 subgroup E
very likely gave rise to group 2 genes.
In conclusion, our study indicates the presence of two distinct TRIM gene groups. Group 1 is evolutionary more
ancient than group 2 and is likely to contain basic functions that are essential to both vertebrate and invertebrate
species. On the other hand, group 2 is younger and more
dynamic, possibly acting as a sort of TRIM genes "reservoir" to develop novel species-specific functions.

Discussion
Here, we report the identification and genomic characterization of the full complement of the human TRIM family
examined from an evolutionary perspective by comparison with several vertebrate and invertebrate species.
We definitively assessed that the B-box domain is only
present within the tripartite module in metazoans, with
the few exceptions mentioned above and discussed
below, and is therefore the defining domain of the TRIM
family. We redefined the B-box1 and B-box2 consensi as
well as the TRIM specific RING finger pattern using all
human sequences. Within these domains we found conservation not only of the residues putatively involved in
metal coordination, but also of other amino acids that
compose the novel consensi. It will be interesting to
model the RING, B-box1 and B-box2 sequences of the
TRIM proteins on these structures to study the possible
role of the conserved residues in relation to the ubiquitylation cascade [7-9,24,25].
Based on our analyses, we propose a general model of
TRIM structure evolution (Fig. 7). Our studies suggest that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/225

the origin of the B-box domain is quite ancient and probably dates back to a common ancestor of plants and metazoans. The plants maintained either one or two B-boxes
without apparent sequence differentiation into proximal
and distal. Conversely, metazoans differentiated a pair of
B-boxes into a proximal and a distal type. In an early step
of metazoan evolution, a RING domain and a Coiled-coil
region associated with the B-box(es) to generate a solid
tripartite module that has been maintained from invertebrates to mammals. From then onward, the tripartite
motif has evolved as a unique block and it is frequently
encoded by a single exon. Interestingly, we found different mammalian and invertebrate B-box2 patterns. This
may underlie functional coupling with specific interactors
in each lineage, which would have forced convergence at
specific sites. A similar species-specific evolutionary convergence was recently described for sulfatase enzymes and
their common post-translational modification factor [45].
Before invertebrate-vertebrate lineage split, the tripartite
module has been associated with a discrete number of Cterminal domains. Addition and loss of C-terminal
domains and structure remodeling have then occurred in
the various evolutionary lineages (Fig. 7). In at least one
case the same domain acquisition has occurred independently in primates and arthropods. In fact, in some species
of New World monkeys (Aoutus genus), Cyclophilin A
(CypA) is fused with the tripartite motif of TRIM5 [46].
TRIM5 confers a potent block to HIV-1 infection in Old
World primates, while Cyclophilin A (CypA) enhances
infection by direct interaction with the HIV capsid
[21,47]. HIV-1 blockage in Aoutus cells was explained by
the exclusive presence of the TRIM5-CypA chimeric gene
[46,48,49]. Interestingly, we found that a tripartite motif
is associated with a Cyclophilin domain also in fruitfly
CG5071 indicating evolutionary convergence. Independent events of gene fusion are considered a hallmark of
functional coupling that can be also present in those species in which a similar gene fusion is not observed [50].
Similar processes of fusion between functionally associated domains may have been one of the mechanisms
underlying the selection of C-terminal domains during
TRIM evolution.
The early association of the B-box modules with the RING
finger, a domain linked to the ubiquitylation process, has
eventually brought the proteins possessing a tripartite
motif to exert a common basic biochemical function, i.e.
ubiquitin ligase [6]. The large number of proteins belonging to this family in mammals highlights the success of
this module to undertake its task. Since the TRIM family
represents one of the largest RING finger classes, it is
tempting to speculate that, among the myriads of cellular
E3 substrates, a large proportion is demanding the unique
tripartite structure for reasons yet to be discovered.

Whereas the tripartite motif may provide the catalytic E3
activity and the ability to form the scaffold of the TRIMdefined sub-cellular compartments [1], the C-terminal
region may contribute to select the specific substrate and/
or direct the tagged substrate towards downstream pathways. The PHD-BROMO domain, for example, determines the association with chromatin, and the TRIM and
TRIM-like proteins containing the PHD-BROMO domain
are consistently involved in chromatin remodeling
[51,52]. Along the same way, MID1/TRIM18 and the
related TRIM proteins that possess a COS microtubulebinding domain exert their role on the cytoskeleton [4].
It should be reaffirmed that not all the proteins we
included in our study retain an entire tripartite motif. As
mentioned in the 'Results section', we decided to include
all the genes encoding for proteins with B-box motifs and
that in human correspond to the 'complete' TRIM proteins (with RING, B-box and CC) and few 'incomplete'
TRIM proteins (or TRIM-like) presenting only two of the
three tripartite motif composing domains (with either
'RING and B-box' or 'B-box and CC'). This might pose a
formal problem on what should be classified as a TRIM
protein. In the classic definition, a protein family is composed of proteins that have a common phylogenetic origin and share a degree of amino acid identity/similarity
above an established threshold. In the case of the TRIM
family, the initial definition of family was based on the
observation that most members of this protein family
share the tripartite arrangement at their N-terminal portion [1]. What was not clear was whether the TRIM proteins had a common origin or rather they were the result
of domain swapping from evolutionarily unrelated proteins. Our analyses demonstrate that all the proteins with
a RING-B-box-CC module actually have a common evolutionary origin. Therefore, what was raised as an 'operative'
definition is now demonstrated to be perfectly adherent
to the classic definition of a gene/protein family. Our data
allow the same conclusion to be drawn for the 'incomplete' TRIM proteins which possess the B-box motif and
which we found evolutionarily belonging to the TRIM
family. In support of that, some of the 'incomplete' TRIM
proteins also present C-terminal domains characteristic of
the 'complete' TRIM proteins. This parallel cannot be used
for other domains present within the tripartite motif, e.g.
the RING domain has been 'used' to build many different
protein families in association with several TRIM unrelated domains [22]. On the other hand, we think that a
strict definition of TRIM family based only on function is
not feasible at present. As discussed above, the presence of
the RING domain suggests a role as E3 ubiquitin ligases
for the TRIM proteins. Experimentally, this has been
proven for some TRIM proteins and we cannot exclude
that some of them, although containing the RING
domain in the proper tripartite motif, might have a differ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/225

ent biochemical role. What is the role of the 6 RING-less
proteins we included in our study? They may be involved
in ubiquitylation as well by, for example, acting as regulators of orthodox TRIM proteins through hetero-interaction. Given that the recent solution of the B-box1 and Bbox2 domains revealed a strong structural similarity with
the RING domain [24,25], it is tempting to speculate that
these domains may interact with components of the ubiquitylation machinery and attribute these RING-less proteins the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Coherently with
these observations, we propose to include within the
TRIM family all the proteins that are phylogenetically
related to established TRIM members and that have a tripartite motif at their N-terminus, including the few examples in which part of this motif has been lost.
The relatively small number of TRIM genes in lower
eukaryotes compared to mammals suggests rapid and
recent changes of the TRIM family. Our study revealed the
presence of two main groups of mammalian TRIM genes
that show distinct evolutionary features and that we
named group 1 and group 2. Group 1, that is in turn subdivided in several subgroups, is composed of genes that
are present in human, mouse, rat, dog, and cow with a one
to one relationship. Although orthology with mammals is
not always recognizable, this group of genes is highly conserved also in other vertebrates (chick and fish) in number
and structure. Our data on the Ka/Ks ratio of human and
mouse group 1 genes suggest that they are subject to purifying selection aimed at conserving their function. It is
conceivable that group 1 consists of diversified and essential TRIM and TRIM-like functions for which little or no
redundancy is present. Consistently, many group 1 genes
are involved in basic cellular processes, such as cell cycle
progression and transcriptional regulation, and result,
when mutated, in developmental disorders, muscular
phenotypes, cancer insurgence, etc. [2,6]. Some group 1
TRIM genes have also been found to be involved in viral
response, namely TRIM1 [53], TRIM19/PML [3,54,55]
and TRIM32 [56]. TRIM19/PML, besides its involvement
in acute promyelocytic leukemia, has been shown to
interfere with the replicative cycle of many DNA and RNA
viruses and evidence indicate that it may represent a
broad-spectrum cellular defence factor [3].
The important increase of TRIM number in vertebrates is
primarily due to the buildup of the genes that constitute
group 2. Group 2 is in fact evolutionarily more recent than
group 1, is not represented in invertebrates, and evolves at
a faster rate. Interestingly, many TRIM proteins that
belong to group 2 have been recently associated with cellular innate immunity towards viral infection. In addition
to TRIM5α, other members are being investigated as
potential retrovirus restriction factors. Among them,
TRIM21, 22 and 34 are regulated by interferons, a family

Page 17 of 22

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:225

of secreted proteins that exert antiviral and immunomodulatory activities [57]. Moreover, other group 2 genes,
PYRIN/TRIM20* and TRIM21 are involved in immunorelated diseases [20,58,59]. Interestingly, group 2 proteins
share the same C-terminal motif, the SPRY domain. In the
case of TRIM5α, this domain is responsible for the species-specific HIV-1 restriction and is subject to positive
selection in primates, underlying its possible role in
directing and specifying capsid recognition [44,60]. Of
note, the SPRY domain is also present in SOCS proteins,
involved in cytokine signaling and innate immunity, and
in the BTN family of lymphoid expressed proteins, possibly involved in immune regulation [28,61,62]. It has been
proposed that the sharing of the SPRY domain between
the TRIM and BTN family members located within the
MHC locus is somewhat linked to their immunological
function [41]. The SPRY domain might therefore confer to
group 2 proteins the ability to specifically recognize viral
capsids and interfere with early steps of viral infection.
Differently from anti-viral group 2 proteins, group 1
TRIM19/PML interferes with general mechanisms of viral
replication common to various viruses and consistently is
not subject to positive selection [35].
Our comparative analysis in five mammalian species
shows that subsets of group 2 TRIM and TRIM-like genes
are different and specific in each examined lineage. This is
more evident in the three non-mammalian vertebrates
analyzed, where large numbers of newly identified group
2 genes mainly lie on species-specific evolutionary clades.
This observation might underlie dispensability/redundancy of some group 2 genes, which could have provided
the basis for novel species-specific roles during evolution.
The presence of clusters composed of massively duplicated group 2 genes, in mammals but also in chick, suggests that they may be hot-spots for TRIM gene production
and remodeling. In the case of the teleost fish species
some of the duplications may be the remnants of the
whole genome duplication event early in the teleost lineage. Global duplication is not however enough to explain
the large and independent expansion of subgroup E and
group 2 genes in the teleosts and a different cause must
underlie these expansions. It is interesting to note that
similar to the Group 2 TRIM and TRIM-like genes, other
families of genes involved in innate immune response
and in particular the components that interact with pathogens have been subject to similar large lineage specific
expansions in the teleost fish [63]. Moreover, since we
observed that group 2 genes tend to have a human/mouse
Ka/Ks ratio higher than group 1 genes, it is tempting to
speculate that some group 2 genes other than TRIM5α
may be subject in some species to positive selection at specific sites to counteract species-specific battles against viral
infections, as it has been shown for other family of genes
involved in innate cellular immunity [64-66].

Conclusion
We found that the TRIM domain structure is an innovation of metazoans. The growing evidence for a common
biochemical function of the TRIM proteins as ubiquitin
ligases justifies the maintenance of their basic modular
structure throughout evolution. Our studies indicate the
presence of two distinct TRIM gene groups. Group 1 is
evolutionary more ancient than group 2 and is likely to
contain basic functions that are essential to both vertebrate and invertebrate species. On the other hand, group
2 is younger and more dynamic, possibly acting as a sort
of TRIM genes "reservoir" to develop novel functions.
Since some of the TRIM genes that belong to this group
are implicated in innate immune response, we propose
that the different selection we observed for this group of
genes underlies pressure towards rapid changes necessary
to counteract species-specific battles against viral infection.

Methods
Gene searching
Known mammalian TRIM and TRIM-like gene/protein
sequences were retrieved from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and re-defined by
searching against their respective genome assemblies
using BLAT at the UCSC genome browser (http://
genome.ucsc.edu). All the 'corrected' sequences were then
used as queries to search potential novel TRIM genes
within the human, mouse, rat, cow, and dog genomes,
using BLAT at UCSC and TBLASTN at NCBI [67] genome
browsers, respectively. All searches have been performed
in several iterations using default parameters. Human nr
and EST databases were screened using the PHI-BLAST in
several iterations using the patterns previously defined for
B-box1 and B-box2 [1]. We also searched the human,
mouse, rat, cow, and dog proteomes using the B-box2 as
a bait in five iterations of the PHI-BLAST program [67],
which provides a highly sensitive analysis, taking advantage of the fact that the B-box2 is a peculiar constituent of
TRIM proteins and does not produce a large amount of
background noise in this analysis. The retrieved amino
acid sequences were subsequently used to search the
respective genomes for identifying their encoding loci.
Representative B-box2 sequences were also used as queries for TBLASTN search of the five mammalian genomes
to identify all the potential loci encoding TRIM and TRIMlike proteins. All the retrieved genomic sequences were
aligned to the available cDNA/EST sequences to infer the
gene architectures. For genes that lacked a transcript counterpart in public databases, we performed a careful manual examination of the genomic sequences BLASTcomparing them to the putative more closely related
ortholog or paralog, looking for splicing donor and acceptor signals to define the exon-intron boundaries. Constructed open reading frames (ORFs) were conceptually

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:225

translated into amino acid sequences and checked against
their closest homologs. The original genome sequencing
traces (Traces-WGS), which are available at the NCBI web
site, were checked when the constructed coding sequences
presented either stop codons or ORF frame-shifts. When a
difference between WGS traces and the genomic assembly
was evident, the constructed sequence was properly corrected. Comparison of human, mouse, rat, cow, and dog
orthologous TRIM and TRIM-like genes showed that
>99% of splicing acceptor and donor sites were conserved
at the same relative position in the coding sequence in all
species, i.e. the gene structure of TRIM genes is identical
among different mammals. To retrieve TRIM genes form
ciona (Ciona intestinalis), chick (Gallus gallus), pufferfish
(Tetraodon nigroviridis) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) we used
a combination of PHI-BLAST and TBLASTN against nr
protein and nucleotide databases at NCBI, respectively.

Protein domain analyses
To identify and analyze the domain composition of the
TRIM and TRIM-like protein products we used the major
alternative splicing isoforms, if more than one was available, and utilized different domain prediction programs.
First, we submitted the TRIM amino acid sequences to the
SMART tool [68] where we analyzed the sequence against
contemporary the SMART and Pfam [69] domains databases. The denotation of the C-terminal domains found
within the TRIM sequences are the following: MATH,
SM00061; PHD, SM00249; BROMO, SM00297; IGFLMN,
SM00557; EXOIII, SM00479; FN3, SM00060; PRY,
SM00589; SPRY, SM00449; ARF, SM00177; NHL,
PF01436 (Pfam). The tripartite motif domains were additionally analyzed as described below. Besides the SMART
results, the RING and B-boxes domains were also defined
in each TRIM and TRIM-like protein by hand using the
previously published patterns [1]. In order to obtain a
new profiling, the sequences corresponding to each
domain were then aligned using the PRATT 2.1 program
[70] and the best scoring consensi were selected and integrated by hand. The order of the sequences in the alignment shown reflects their degree of sequence
conservation. The region of each TRIM and TRIM-like pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/225

tein immediately after the last Cys or His of the B-box2
domain was analyzed for Coiled-coil prediction with the
Coil 2.2 program [71]. Analysis was performed with
MTIDK and MTK matrices and both the weighted option,
which takes into account the polarity of the residue within
the predicted Coiled-coil heptad repeat, as well as the
unweighted option. When differences of around 20–30%
in Coiled-coil prediction were observed between the different methods utilized, the prediction was considered
bad and not indicated in the list of Additional file 2.
Moreover, only percentages of prediction higher than
50% were considered using two residue windows, 21 and
28 amino acids.
Plant B-box containing proteins (from A. thaliana, O.
sativa, P. sativum, B. nigra) were retrieved from the SMART
B-box database [68].
Evolutionary analyses
To perform phylogenetic analysis, TRIM and TRIM-like
protein sequences were aligned using MultAlin [72] in a
multi-step process. Only proteins containing the complete module R-B1-B2-CC were aligned in a first step,
eliminating from each sequence the portion downstream
of the coiled-coil domain and all segments that caused a
gap to interrupt the alignment. A first phylogenetic tree
was produced starting from this multi-alignment. In a successive step, each of the remaining protein sequences was
singularly added to the multi-alignment, edited for
exceeding amino acids, and assigned to a TRIM subgroup
after inspection of the topology of the resulting phylogenetic tree. Once all TRIM and TRIM-like protein sequences
were assigned to a subgroup, phylogenetic analyses were
performed independently for each subgroup. TRIM37 was
not included in any subgroup and therefore was used as
an outgroup in all final analyses. Nucleotide sequences of
TRIM5/6/22/34 and related non-human sequences were
also aligned using MultAlin [72], but in this case a gapremoval step was not necessary due to the high similarity
among all considered sequences. Neighbor-Joining and
bootstrap analyses were performed with Phylo_win [73],
computing the distances among sequences with all the
methods available in the package (protein analysis:
observed divergence with and without Poisson correction;
PAM distance. DNA analysis: observed divergence; Jukes
and Cantor distance; Kimura distance; Tajima and Nei distance; HKY distance; Galtier and Gouy distance; and LogDet distance) [73] (and references therein). Gap-removal
was set as pairwise rather than global to minimize information loss. Bootstrap values were computed over 1000
repetitions. All tree topologies resulted to coincide in the
different methods for branches with a bootstrap value
>50. Evaluation of Ka/Ks values for pairs of humanmouse TRIM- and TRIM-like-coding sequences was performed at the Norwegian bioinformatics platform [74].
