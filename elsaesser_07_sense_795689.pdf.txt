Abstract
Smell is often regarded as an ancillary perception in primates, who seem so dominated by their
sense of vision. In this paper, we will portray some aspects of the significance of olfaction to human
life and speculate on what evolutionary factors contribute to keeping it alive. We then outline the
functional architecture of olfactory sensory neurons and their signal transduction pathways, which
are the primary detectors that render olfactory perception possible. Throughout the phylogenetic
tree, olfactory neurons, at their apical tip, are either decorated with cilia or with microvilli. The
significance of this dichotomy is unknown. It is generally assumed that mammalian olfactory
neurons are of the ciliary type only. The existance of so-called olfactory microvillar cells in mammals,
however, is well documented, but their nature remains unclear and their function orphaned. This
paper discusses the possibility, that in the main olfactory epithelium of mammals ciliated and
microvillar sensory cells exist concurrently. We review evidence related to this hypothesis and ask,
what function olfactory microvillar cells might have and what signalling mechanisms they use.

The "scentimental" nose
Wine experts occasionally identify a broad variety of aromas such as »bacon fat, pain grillé, black raspberries, cassis, white flowers, and Provençal olives« when they taste,
for example, a vintage of Côte Rôtie [1]. Even an expert's
nose, however, can get surprisingly confused in the presence of misleading visual cues. In a noteworthy study performed at the University of Bordeaux, Gil Morrot and
collaborators asked 54 undergraduate students from the
Faculty of Oenology to compare a glass of white Bordeaux
wine (containing Sémillon and Sauvignon grapes) to a
glass of exactly the same wine, which had been coloured
by a mixture of red anthocyanins. Although the added
anthocyanins had no perceptible taste or odour, the subjects identified remarkably different sets of aromas in both
glasses [2]. Despite this surprising lack of discriminatory

skills, it seems our sense of smell has other proficiencies,
such as a remarkable power of attributing emotional qualities to objects that we see. The attributive nature of the
sense of smell is illustrated by the fact that we need socalled descriptors to communicate odours [3]. What alternatives do we have but to portray an olfactory perception
as »black raspberries-like«, or »Provençal olives-like«?
None of these scents can be addressed directly, without
reference to its respective source [4]. Other perceptual
qualities can often be named independently. We can
speak, for example, of »red« and »sweet« without employing metaphors and similes such as »anthocyanin-like« or
»sucrose-like«. Odours, on the other hand, can affect our
emotional state profoundly [5-7]. A gustatory stimulus,
such as »too salty«, effectively keeps us from drinking sea
water, but compared to bad odours, the aversion evoked

by the taste of salt is less affective. This is vividly illustrated
by an authentic report by the early Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who describes the fate of a shipwrecked sailor who
drifts on his raft through the Caribbean sea. After four
days of suffering the agonies of thirst, he decides to drink
salt water. "This water does not satisfy your thirst", the salvaged sailor later testifies, "but it refreshes" [8]. Apparently, the repulsion evoked by the salty taste is based on
reflex and rational thinking rather than on emotional disgust. By the same token, sweetness alone will rarely make
us long for artificial sweeteners and it is unlikely to evoke
a similar savouriness as the scent of freshly baked bread.
In contrast, the repulsiveness of the nauseating stench of
rotting meat is so effective that the use of this smell was
suggested as a powerful stimulus for therapeutical conditioning of sexual offenders [9,10].
It seems that an important role of the human sense of
smell is adding emotional qualities to situations and
objects that we see, and not so much to making an essential contribution to finding or identifying things. Of
course we can recognize typical odours even with our eyes
shut, but the scent of ripe bananas, for example, rather
influences our appetite than being necessary to distinguish bananas from pineapples. This observation raises
questions about the biological purpose of the olfactory
sense in a visually dominated species, such as man. What
is so important about watering our mouth that it exerts
sufficient selection pressure to sustain several hundreds of
functional olfactory receptor genes through evolution?
Why do we even maintain the ability to regenerate olfactory neurons from adult stem cells, just to make sure that
our sense of smell stays alive as long as we do?
The functional anatomy of the mammalian nose and its
close contact to the oral cavity point to possible answers
to these questions. Odour molecules approach the olfactory epithelium along two principle routes: When we sniff
or breathe with our mouth closed, the inhaled air enters
the lumen of the nasal cavity through external nostrils.
Food almost touches our nares before it enters the oral
cavity, and it is almost impossible not to stick our nose
into a glass of wine that we taste. When we chew, we break
down the food into a mush from which favours exhale.
These volatile odour molecules then travel up the retronasal passage and reach the olfactory epithelium through
internal nostrils, which connect the pharynx to the nasal
cavity [11]. The phylogenetic emergence of these internal
nostrils (or choanae) was an important step in the adaptation of the olfactory system to air breathing [12]. It now
enables us to employ olfactory perception in the assessment of nutrients at every level of uptake. We can now
even evaluate compounds in our food that are made
accessible only by mechanical exposure. This close
involvement of the olfactory system in the analysis of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S1

food along with the attributive nature of olfactory perception allow us to employ the sense of smell in aquiring
refined food preferences. In this respect, humans are
uniquely flexible. There might be some inherently aversive odours (such as the smell of rotting meat), but
depending on trends and cultural background, we can
enjoy almost everything, from fried locusts spiced with
salt and lime (as served in the Mexican region of Oaxaca)
to live oysters (which are perceived as a delicacy in a lot of
wealthy Western societies). We can even "learn to enjoy
things that we should not enjoy" [13]. Used as flavoring
agents, bitter compounds, including plant-derived phenols and polyphenols, flavonoids, catechins, and caffeine,
enhance the sensory appeal of beverages and food, such as
beer, coffee, chocolate, tea, and tonic water [14]. This flexibility effectively supports opening up new food
resources. In this context, olfactory conditioning helps us
to pass on approved food preferences to our infant offspring, while at the same time protecting them from
exploring potentially noxious material while unattended
(long before they understand the advise that we give).
Cooking-ambitious parents often experience how cautious and how annoyingly conservative their children can
be, when it comes to trying out unknown delicacies. The
juveniles may well obstinately insist on fish sticks with
mashed potatoes when served cod steaks cooked in an
»interesting spice mixture of ginger, cloves, chilies,
cilantro leaves, and lemon juice« [15]. Training pays out,
however, and we can learn to expand our pool of nutrients
to include surprisingly variable ingredients.
For free living rats, the importance of social learning of
food preferences has also been demonstrated [16], and
olfaction certainly plays an important role in this process
[17]. Mice prefer sweet over bitter, even if the sweet perception is triggered erroneously by a bitter compound
[18]. Humans, in contrast, are capable of expanding their
menu well beyond sweet and non-bitter aliments, and
they seem to do so by prioritizing hedonic odour qualities
over gustatory perception, and by dynamically adapting
their food preferences to changing age, resources, and
trends.
The production of aromas and scents has long been an
important economical factor [19] and an interesting perspective for biotechnological fabrication [20]. Olfactory
signals can act as mediator of social interactions [21] and
the potential of olfactory cues as marketing tools in social
and economical context has long been recognized [2224]. Nevertheless, empirical research in the field of how
we perceive odours is still fairly new, although we know
more today about our brain's strategy in computing odour
perception [25-28] than we did only a few years ago.
Innovative techniques such as genetic tracing of neural circuits [29-31] and functional magnetic resonance imaging

(fMRI) [32-36] produced exciting new results. It turns out,
that, even in insects, coding and representation of odours
is highly complex and dynamic [27,28,37-39], but significant progress is made, and, for example, we now begin to
understand why a typical white wine tastes like a typical
red wine, just because we added a tiny pinch of neutral
anthocyanins. In a striking fMRI study, Jay Gottfried and
Raymond Dolan recently found evidence of why "the
nose smells what the eye sees". Their data indicate that the
"human hippocampus mediates a reactivation of crossmodal semantic associations, even in the absence of
explicit memory processing" [32,33]. Apparently, »black
raspberries and Provençal olives« are imprinted in our
brain, while the nose just pulls the trigger to unfold them
in our mind.

Olfactory sensory neurons
The initial event in all these fascinating aspects of odour
sensation is the binding of odorant molecules [40] to
olfactory receptor proteins [41,42]. The released binding
energy is transduced by a complex chain of molecular
interactions into electrochemical membrane potentials,
which dynamically modulate neuronal odour representation [19,43-56]. How do these primary olfactory processes work and where do they occur?
A crux of this matter are the bipolar chemosensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium of the nose. Olfactory
neurons are based at the front line between the brain and
the odour-containing air that we breathe. Their surface
membrane can be divided into two major spatial compartments, which are separated by a belt of tight junctional proteins [57]. The basolateral surface membrane
lies well protected inside of the olfactory epithelial tissue.
It covers large part of the apical dendrite, the cell body,
and an unbranched axon that projects to the brain. On the
other hand, there is an apical surface membrane compartment, the size of which is comparable to that of the basal
compartment. It is located externally, directly exposed to
the air, and attached to the rest of the cell only through the
nexus of a thin apical dendrite, which reaches into the
lumen of the nasal cavity with its terminal knob. The apical surface membrane is embedded into mucus and airway surface fluid. These represent ionic and biochemical
compartments, which are important for olfactory signal
transduction [58,59], as well as for innate defense of all
airway epithelial surfaces [60]. Disturbances of the composition of these fluids, e.g. by mutation of ion transport
systems, can cause severe pathologies, including cystic
fibrosis [61].
Through their apical membrane compartment, olfactory
sensory neurons contact the ambient air. At this surface,
they collect information about volatile odour molecules,
and here odours are transduced into neuronal signals,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S1

which the brain can read and analyse [62-64]. The molecular machinery that mediates olfactory signal transduction has been thoroughly characterized. Briefly, volatile
odour molecules bind to odorant receptors [65] and trigger the activation of G-proteins (Gαolf) [47]. This in turn
stimulates adenylyl cyclase (type III) activity [66], and the
resulting rise of intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) opens cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG)
cation channels [67]. The elicited influx of Ca2+ from the
extracellular space depolarizes the ciliary membrane and
prompts a secondary opening of Ca2+-gated chloride
channels. These are responsible for large part of the depolarizing current across the olfactory ciliary membrane
[68,69]. The depolarizing nature of the induced chloride
current is based on an unusually high intracellular chloride concentration in the cytoplasm and cilia of olfactory
sensory neurons, which is replenished by sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporters (NKCC-1) in the basolateral surface membrane compartment [68,69]. Odourinduced signals are thought to be terminated as a result of
multiple factors and mechanisms [70], although recent
evidence indicates that the dwell-time of the receptorodorant complex might be too small for some inactivation processes to occur under physiological conditions
[71].
Beside this main stream model of olfactory signal transduction survived a scuff resistant hypothesis, proposing
InsP3 as an alternative second messenger in olfaction
[50,72,73]. The possibility of a supplementary signalling
pathway in olfactory neurons was initially raised by a
study, in which the authors found that in contrast to most
odours, some potent odorants failed to induce cAMP
when applied to isolated olfactory cilia in biochemical
assays [74]. It was later found that these "non cAMP
odours" induced InsP3 instead [75,76], and that odorant
receptors coupled to either cAMP or InsP3 when they were
functionally expressed in insect cells, depending on the
receptor's specificity for either "cAMP-" or "IP3-odours"
[77]. Despite these findings, the resulting speculation
around a possible duality of signalling pathways in olfactory neurons remained controversial [49,78]. The goose of
InsP3 as an alternative second messenger in olfactory neurons got cooked, when mutant mice that lacked functional expression of Gαolf [79], adenylyl cyclase (type III)
[80], and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels [81] came
out anosmic for both cAMP- and InsP3-odours. Consequently, many researchers began to accept that cAMP
might be the sole excitatory second messenger in olfaction
[82-84]. The evidence linking phosphoinositide-related
signalling to the mammalian olfactory epithelium, however, remained orphaned.

Cilia and microvilli
The apical surface membrane of olfactory sensory neurons
is a platform that links the physical world of odour molecules to the mental world of odour perception. At this
interface, the physiochemical properties of volatile compounds are transduced into the electrochemical membrane potentials, which modulate the information from
which the brain constructs, for example, the aromas of
»black raspberries« and »pain grillé«. The apical surface
membrane compartment therefore represents a most
important cell organelle. It is significantly enlarged by
cilia or microvilli, which emerge from the terminal knob
of the apical dendrite to protrude into the mucus [85].
What is the biological significance of this enlargement?
Why do some sensory neurons sustain this extension with
cilia, while others possess microvilli or both?
A requirement for high sensitivity is often regarded as a
sufficiently meaningful biological reason for the enlargement of the surface area of sensory membranes. In photoreceptor cells, this argument intuitively makes sense. A
photon on its path through a photoreceptor cell is either
captured by a photosensitive rhodopsin molecule or the
information it carries will be lost by absorption in non
sensory material. Therefore, photoreceptor cells increase
their quantum efficiency by forming multilayered stacks
of membranes that are tightly packed with photosensitive
rhodopsin molecules. This functional cytoarchitecture can
likewise be observed in vertebrate [86] and invertebrate
eyes [87], where stacks of membrane discs or rhabdomeric
microvilli ensure high quantum efficiency of each photosensitive cell. In the case of olfactory sensory neurons,
however, the situation is slightly different. Compared to
photons, odour molecules are stable and could theoretically be trapped and retained in a lipophilic environment
until receptor activation has occurred. Furthermore, the
physiological purpose of increasing sensitivity is also not
as obvious as a first glance might suggest. It has been
reported that olfactory neurons are sufficiently sensitive to
detect even single odour molecules [88], but the biological significance of this finding was challenged [49,89,90].
Extraordinary sensitivity has undoubtedly been observed
in the olfactory system of moths [91], but since only a few
mammals fly around in the dark with a need to smell their
food or mating partner from miles away, it remains
unclear how solitary odour molecules could carry meaningful information and why they should be detected at all.
Quantal sensitivity of olfactory neurons, similar to that
observed in photoreceptor cells [92,93], could also provide confusing sensory input to the brain. Olfactory neurons express only one or a few olfactory receptors [94,95]
and many olfactory receptors are broadly tuned to overlapping sets of qualitatively distinct odour molecules [6264]. Thus, two identical solitary odour molecules could
trigger different sensory input into the olfactory system,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S1

depending on which receptor they hit by chance. Such an
arrangement does not appear like a plausible approach to
ensure reliable and reproducible sensory input, particularly at extremely low levels of odorant concentration.
Accordingly, in contrast to phototransduction, olfactory
signal transduction lacks amplification at one of its very
basic levels, namely that of receptor-G-protein-activation.
The life-time of the receptor-odorant complex was found
to be so short, that the complex might often dissociate
even before a single G-protein was activated. Consequently, signal amplification by one active receptor triggering multiple downstream G-protein/effector enzyme
molecules seems unplausible [71].
Alternative explanations for the observed enlargement of
the apical membrane compartment of olfactory neurons
include the outstanding ability of these cells to provide
information that allows the detection of even minute differences between odour concentrations, or, equivalently,
differential affinities of odour molecules to distinct receptor populations.
Even humans are capable of extracting spatial information
from smell [96-98]. Dogs just need five footsteps to determine the direction of an odour trail [99] and a rat can
determine the location of an odour source by stereo-localisation in a single sniff [100]. To enable such impressing
performances, it will most likely be necessary to maximize
the dynamic sensitivity of olfactory neurons. The dynamic
sensitivity represents the ability of a signalling system to
respond to a small change of the input signal by modulating the output signal in a statistically significant manner.
The dynamic sensitivity of an olfactory neuron is directly
influenced by the size of its apical membrane surface compartment, because the latter is correlated to the number of
signalling proteins (i.e. receptor molecules, G-proteins,
and ion channels) and thus to the total number of elementary responses that can simultaneously be generated
in each cell.
The requirements to a high performance odorant detector
can be illustrated by comparing it to a light detecting
device, such as a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.
Here, each photosensitive element (analogous to an olfactory neuron in the nose) is characterized by its background noise, its quantum efficiency, and its full well
capacity [101]. In a high performance CCD camera, noise
reduction is achieved by cooling the sensor to low temperatures. Quantum efficiency of a photon detector describes
the ratio between the number of photons registered by the
detector to the number of photons entering the device.
Lastly, the full well capacity of the photon detector
describes the total number of photons that can be registered within a single readout cycle. To improve the
dynamic sensitivity of any charge-coupled device, it is nec-

BMC Neuroscience 2007, 8(Suppl 3):S1

essary to combine high quantum efficiency with a large
full well capacity. If the ratio between full well capacity
and quantum efficiency of the detector is low, the slope of
its response curve will be shallow. This, in turn, makes it
difficult to reliably detect minute differences in signal
amplitude, particularly when background noise is high.
Therefore, high performance light detectors require the
optimization of all three parameters combined: low background noise, high quantum sensitivity, and large full
well capacity.
For olfactory sensory neurons, similar requirements might
apply. In the olfactory sytem, noise reduction is a multi
level process [102]. It begins with a nonlinear signal
amplification by Ca2+-activated chloride currents
[103,104], continues by the convergence of dozens of cilia
onto the terminal knob of the sensory neuron's apical
dendrite, and is further sophisticated by the convergence
of hundreds of olfactory neurons on a single glomerulus
in the olfactory bulb [105-107]. This multilevel integration with the possibility of adjusting thresholds at each
level enables effective filtering of background noise,
which has been observed as an intrinsic feature of olfactory signal transduction [102,108-111]. To represent high
performance detectors for chemical constituents of the air,
olfactory neurons might also have to improve quantum
efficiency and full well capacity by enlarging their apical
membrane compartment. At a given odour concentration
and affinity of the odorant to its receptor, the quantum
efficiency of the olfactory neuron as a whole will directly
depend on the total number of receptors present. The
same holds true for the neuron's "full well capacity",
which represents its capacity to register odorant-to-receptor-docking-events within a single readout cycle (which in
this case might be equivalent to the duration of a sniff).
Since there is a limit to packaging density of receptors and
other signaling molecules within the surface membrane,
these parameters will also depend on the total apical surface membrane area. Olfactory neurons therefore enlarge
this area by the folding the apical membrane into cilia
and/or microvilli [85]. Interestingly, it seems that olfactory neurons further improve their physiological performance by additional measures. As mentioned above, the
receptor-odorant dwell-time is very short, enabling
repeated binding of odorant molecules to the same receptor. Furthermore, the quantal responses of olfactory neurons are very small. At the same time, the density of
receptors in the ciliary membrane is so high that their
response domains overlap, which causes non linear summation of the odour-induced unitary responses [71].
Since linearity is neither necessary for detecting differential activation patterns (i.e. specific odours), nor for sensing relative differences in odour concentration, this
strategy seems to improve the dynamic resolution of each
olfactory neuron over a broad range of odour concentra-

tion levels and thus perfectly serves to the needs of a biological high performance chemodetector.
Ciliary and microvillar (rhabdomeric) photoreceptor cells
For animal photoreceptor cells, two types of membrane
enlargement have been recognized. Rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells, as they occur in the compound eye of
arthropods, carry microvilli, while the rods and cones of
the mammalian retina and the light sensitive cells of the
pineal organ are of a ciliary type. The evolutionary origin
of both cell types was unclear [112], until Detlev Arendt
and his collaborators found a polychaete marine worm,
Platynereis dumerilii, which possesses both, rhabdomeric
and ciliary photoreceptors [113]. On the basis of these
findings, the authors proposed an attractive model for the
evolution of metazoan photoreceptor cells. Accordingly,
rhabdomeric and ciliary photoreceptors have emerged
from a common ancestor that used an ancestral opsin for
photodetection. The ancestral opsin gene then duplicated
into the paralogs rhabdomeric opsin (r-opsin) and ciliary
opsin (c-opsin), supporting the emergence of ciliated and
rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells and their functional
diversification. This dualism of light sensitive cells can
also be observed within the mammalian retina. Melanopsin, the vertebrate ortholog of invertebrate r-opsin, is
expressed in some light-sensitive retinal ganglion cells,
which are involved in synchronizing the primary circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the
light-dark cycle [114].

Light transduction in invertebrates is mediated by an eyespecific phospholipase C (norpA), phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), its downstream products InsP3
and diacylglycerol [115-117], and transient receptor
potential (TRP and TRPL) channels [118,119]. Interestingly, the vertebrate ortholog (PLC β4) of norpA is also
expressed in the mammalian retina [120] and melanopsin
signalling has been linked to InsP3 in cultured Xenopus
melanophores [121-124]. This raises the question,
whether cells expressing r-opsin and its orthologs generally utilize phosphoinositides as second messengers.
Although melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells do
neither appear to be normal retinal ganglion cells nor specialized rhabdomeric or microvillar sensory neurons
[125,126], this evidence nevertheless points towards a
possible phylogenetic link between rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells and phosphoinositide-mediated signalling
processes. In contrast, ciliary photoreceptors prefer phosphodiesterase-mediated signal transduction with cGMP as
a second messenger [121,122].
A functional reason for the possible allocation between
microvilli and InsP3 signalling has been proposed by
Klaus Lange [127]. He suggested that F-actin, which is a
major constituent of the cytoskeleton of microvilli, repre-

BMC Neuroscience 2007, 8(Suppl 3):S1

sents an InsP3-sensitive, non vesicular Ca2+-store. Accordingly, a stimulation of phospholipase C will release the
actin-binding proteins profilin and gelsolin from phospholipids, which in turn liberates Ca2+ from F-actin. InsP3
stabilizes the active state of profilin/gelsolin. Furthermore, PIP2, a substrate of phospholipase C, is preferentially localised to raft-like lipid domains, which are
typically observed in conjunction with microvilli
[128,129]. This raises the possibility that, for principle
reasons, signal transduction processes in cilia and microvilli preferentially utilize cyclic nucleotides and phosphoinositides as second messengers, respectively.
Ciliated and microvillar olfactory neurons
In mammals, the apical cell surface of typical olfactory
neurons is enlarged by a species-dependant number of
cilia. In microvillar olfactory neurons the enlargement
occurs by the folding of the membrane into microvilli.
Both types of olfactory sensory neurons have been
observed without perceivable phylogenetic boundaries
throughout the clade of vertebrates. In her excellent and
comprehensive review, Heather Eisthen pointed out that
sharks, rays, and ratfish have only microvillar olfactory
neurons, while lampreys, frogs, snakes, and turtles have
only ciliated ones. In hagfish, bony fishes, and salamanders, both types of olfactory neurons can be observed next
to each other, while in birds individual olfactory neurons
simultaneously carry cilia and microvilli [85]. The situation in mammals is not entirely clear. Many researchers
assume that only ciliated olfactory neurons are present,
but the occurrence of microvillar olfactory neurons has
also been proposed [130,131]. Surprisingly, this finding
has never attracted much attention.

Olfactory microvillar cells
The olfactory epithelium of mammals consists of a relatively small number of cell types [132]. A monolayer of
supporting or sustentacular cells separates the nasal cavity
from the sensory neuroepithelium. This palisade-like
monolayer covers a pseudostratified layer of bipolar sensory neurons, which basally project an axon to the olfactory bulb (Figure 1). Apically, the olfactory neurons
contact the lumen of the nasal cavity with the terminal
knob of their apical dendrite (Figure 2). Between the cell
bodies of the chemosensory neurons and the basal lamina
is a thin layer of so-called globose and horizontal basal
cells, which contains a population of adult neuronal stem
cells [133-136]. These stem cells are important to maintain function and histology of the olfactory epithelium,
because based on their exposed situation in contact to
ambient air, olfactory neurons are prone to damage and
infection. Consequently, olfactory neurons have a limited
lifetime before they are periodically replaced [137-141].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S1

In addition to these three well established major olfactory
epithelial cell types, i.e. ciliated olfactory sensory neurons,
microvillous supporting or sustentacular cells, and basal
cells, at least five classes of so-called olfactory microvillar
cells exist [132]. To prevent confusion, Bert Menco and
Edward Morrison suggested to systematically re-classify
olfactory microvillar cells, and to combine all olfactory
epithelial cells that have microvilli under the term "microvillous cells" [132]. The function of this peculiar type of
cells is totally unknown.
Some microvillous cells have been proposed to represent
a second class of bipolar sensory neurons. Based on an
electron microscopic study of the olfactory epithelium of
rat, François Jourdan first made this suggestion in 1975
[130]. In his thesis, he described a microvillar type of
bipolar olfactory cells (type B cells), the morphology of
which, in his view, was that of a typical bipolar receptor
neuron (Figure 3). Similar cells were later reexamined by
David Moran, Carter Rowley, and Bruce Jafek [131], who
also found evidence that supported the existence of a second morphologically distinct class of bipolar sensory neurons in the mammalian olfactory epithelium [142,143].
The authors injected horseradish peroxidase into the
olfactory bulb of rat and detected retrograde labelling of
olfactory epithelial microvillar cell bodies. They concluded that microvillar cells are connected by an axon to
the olfactory bulb, and that the rat olfactory system will
thus "need to be expanded to include two morphologically distinct classes of sensory receptors, ciliated olfactory
receptors and microvillar cells" [143]. This hypothesis
seemed plausible on the basis of the observation that ciliated and microvillar olfactory neurons occur in many
other species throughout the clade of vertebrates
[85,144]. However, the evidence that microvillar cells are
neuronal remained controversial. When Virginia Carr and
collaborators stained rat olfactory epithelia with monoclonal antibody 1A-6, they labelled microvillar cells that
were not immunoreactive with SUS-1 antibodies (which
is a marker for supporting cells). The 1A-6 immunoreactive cells, however, neither expressed olfactory marker
protein (OMP), nor did they possess an identifiable
axonal process. Since the cells also survived bulbectomyinduced degeneration of olfactory sensory neurons, the
authors concluded that olfactory microvillar cells are of
non-neuronal nature [145]. The absence of OMP in
microvillar cells was confirmed by Edward Johnson and
collaborators [146]. These authors also acknowledged
some arguments that speak for a non-neuronal function
of microvillar cells, but pointed out that the peroxidase
backfill experiments [143] and the expression of Spot-35
protein [147] are in favour of positioning microvillar cells
"in with known microvillar olfactory receptor cells of
other vertebrates". They carefully concluded, that the

The tissue has been fixed and immunoperoxidase-stained with antibodies against GABAA-receptor_1-subunit (brown) as described elsewhere [157]. Nissl staining was performed to counter stain (blue). Clearly visible are the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), to which chemosensory neurons from
the vomeronasal organ project, the intensely labelled layer of mitral cells (MC), and the glomeruli (G), which represent the first
relay station for sensory information transmitted from the nose to the brain (Jacques Paysan, unpublished).

function of the olfactory microvillar cell remains enigmatic [146].
Recently, we have examined the distribution of phosphoinositide-related signalling proteins in the mammalian
olfactory epithelium and found that some elements of
InsP3-mediated signal transduction were found exclusively in olfactory microvillar cells [19,148]. These cells
that we call "Jourdan cells", were labelled with antibodies
against phospholipase C beta-2 (PLC β2), type 3 InsP3receptors (InsP3R-III), type 6 transient receptor potential
channels (TRPC6), and other proteins, including neuronal marker protein MAP2b [148]. In contrast, no coexpression with OMP, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels,
or adenylyl cyclase could be detected. When dissociated
and exposed in vitro to depolarizing concentrations of
potassium chloride, Jourdan cells reacted with a transient
increase of their intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A similar
reaction was observed, when the cells were exposed to
odours. They also possessed a basal axon-like protrusion,
which raised the possibility that they in fact represent a

second class of olfactory sensory neurons. In contrast to
ciliated olfactory sensory neurons [149-151], however,
microvillar cells did not degenerated upon bulbectomy.
This has been interpreted as one argument for a non neuronal nature of olfactory microvillar cells [145,152].
Is there a duality of signalling pathways and sensory neurons in the mammalian olfactory epithelium, similar to
the existence of ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor
cells? Unfortunately, it is too early to submit such an
admittedly attractive proposal. At present, only a few arguments that can be brought in position to support any concept on what olfactory microvillar cells might do. First,
these cells look like sensory neurons [130]. They show a
strong bipolar asymmetry, with a distinctive array of
microvilli protruding towards the nasal cavity at their apical pole, and an axon-like process, the distal extension of
which often crosses the basal lamina and seems to join the
submucosal tracts of the olfactory nerve [148]. This bipolar architecture of microvillar cells would at least be tailor
made to enable the cells to collect signals at the olfactory

Olfactory epithelium
Olfactory epithelium. This image shows a vertical projection of a stack of confocal images taken from a transgenic mouse, in
which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed in all ciliated olfactory sensory neurons. GFP brightly labels the olfactory
neuronal cell bodies (OCB), their apical dendrites (AD), and terminal knobs (TK). Staining does not extend into the sensory
cilia, which remain invisible in this preparation. Basally to the olfactory neuronal cell bodies is the unstained layer of basal stem
cells (LBC), from which degenerating neurons are constantly regenerated. The olfactory axons grow in bundles (AB) through
the basal lamina (BL), and then fasciculate to form the tracts of the olfactory nerve, which projects into the brain. (Rebecca
Elsaesser and Jacques Paysan, unpublished).

mucosal surface and transmit this information across the
epithelium. This view is supported by the localization of
PLC β2 in the apical microvilli. PLC β2 is a G-protein-activated signal transduction enzyme and thus points towards
the presence of yet unidentified upstream G-protein-coupled receptors. Moreover, the cells express neuronal
marker protein MAP2b [148], Ca2+-binding protein
SPOT-35 [153], and they are depolarized by high potassium chloride [148]. All of these findings are compatible
with a role of olfactory sensory neurons, but none of them
is a persuasive argument. To determine, whether or not
olfactory microvillar cells in fact represent sensory neurons, it will be necessary to characterize them by electrophysiological recordings and to analyze their cell
morphology and gene expression profile in greater detail.
Albeit their (un)neuronal nature, we have now found evidence that points towards a possible function of olfactory
microvillar cells. As pointed out above, olfactory sensory
neurons periodically die by apoptosis, being constantly
regenerated from a distinct population of adult neuronal
stem cells. To avoid unproportional growth or degeneration of the olfactory epithelial tissue throughout life, both
processes – cell death and regeneration – must be precisely coordinated over many decades. It has been demonstrated by Donna Hansel, Betty Eipper, and Gabriele
Ronnett, that among the factors, which contribute to this
control, are amidated neuropeptides [154]. In the adult
olfactory neuroepithelium, neuropeptide Y is released
from an uncharacterized set of cells [155]. We were now
able to show that the NPY-expressing cells are identical to
the olfactory microvillar cells that we had previously characterized [156]. This finding raises the possibility, that
olfactory microvillar cells link signals on the surface of the
olfactory mucosa to proliferation and differentiation of
olfactory stem cells at the basis of the epithelium.
Whether or not olfactory microvillar cells indeed represent a second class of olfactory sensory neurons remains
elusive. In analogy to melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells, they could be derived from an ancient type of
microvillar olfactory neurons, which in the course of evolution have aquired a new physiological function. These
thoughts, however, are totally speculative. Our efforts to
understand their biological significance have just begun.
A first step must be to unravel their input specificity by
identifying the G-protein-coupled receptors, which act
upstream of PLC β2.
