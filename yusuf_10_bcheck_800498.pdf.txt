P RNA genes

Abstract
Background: Effective bioinformatics solutions are needed to tackle challenges posed by industrial-scale genome
annotation. We present Bcheck, a wrapper tool which predicts RNase P RNA genes by combining the speed of
pattern matching and sensitivity of covariance models. The core of Bcheck is a library of subfamily specific
descriptor models and covariance models.
Results: Scanning all microbial genomes in GenBank identifies RNase P RNA genes in 98% of 1024 microbial
chromosomal sequences within just 4 hours on single CPU. Comparing to existing annotations found in 387 of the
GenBank files, Bcheck predictions have more intact structure and are automatically classified by subfamily
membership. For eukaryotic chromosomes Bcheck could identify the known RNase P RNA genes in 84 out of 85
metazoan genomes and 19 out of 21 fungi genomes. Bcheck predicted 37 novel eukaryotic RNase P RNA genes,
32 of which are from fungi. Gene duplication events are observed in at least 20 metazoan organisms. Scanning of
meta-genomic data from the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition, comprising over 10 million sample sequences (18
Gigabases), predicted 2909 unique genes, 98% of which fall into ancestral bacteria A type of RNase P RNA and 66%
of which have no close homolog to known prokaryotic RNase P RNA.
Conclusions: The combination of efficient filtering by means of a descriptor-based search and subsequent
construction of a high-quality gene model by means of a covariance model provides an efficient method for the
detection of RNase P RNA genes in large-scale sequencing data.
Bcheck is implemented as webserver and can also be downloaded for local use from http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/

1 Background
In recent years, biological sequence databases have grown
exponentially. These data include a rapidly increasing
number of completely sequenced genomes as well as
large-scale metagenomic data sets that await annotation.
For instance, the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition
(GOS) deposited more than 18G metagenomic sequences
already [1]. The analysis of these data calls for new and
more efficient methods of data analysis [2].
Non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes are abundant in genomic sequences, playing diverse important
biological roles [3]. The genomic annotation of ncRNA
genes is attracting strong research focus, in particular in
the context of genome annotation [4,5] and metagenomics [6,7]. Methods for homology-based annotation

have dramatically improved over the last years. In particular, Infernal 1.0 [8] outperforms previous methods
by orders of magnitude in speed. Nevertheless, such
general purpose approaches do not reach the performance levels of customized class-specific tools, in particular tRNAscan-SE[9] in terms of both speed and
quality. Manual strategies in some cases [10] reach
superior results, but are too time-consuming for larger
projects and in most cases are hard to generalize.
tRNAscan-SE is not a single algorithm but rather a
wrapper tool that combines a series of increasingly complex and expensive filters. Similarly, the major searching
strategy of Rfam [11] is a combination of a blastbased filter followed by Infernal. The pre-filtering at
sequence level with blast, however, is not ideal in particular in applications to distant homologs [12]. Another
common approach is to apply a descriptor of sequence
and structural motif to predict ncRNA homologs. The

descriptor construction is a manual process requiring
expert knowledge. Several descriptor languages have
been developed, e.g. RNAmot [13], PatScan[14],
HyPaL[15], RNAMotif[16], and rnabob[17], which is
also used here.
RNase P RNA, possibly a remnant of the RNA world
[18], is an important ribozyme involved in the processing of pre-tRNAs [19]. Its gene is usually designated as
rnpB in bacteria. A variable number of protein components [20] facilitate substrate binding [21]. RNase P
RNA exists in almost all organisms, but is absent in
human mitochondrions [22]. So far, there is compelling
evidence for the loss of RNase P RNA only in a single
organism, the archaeon Nanoarchaeum equitans [18]. It
is not unlikely, however, that plants, red algae, and heterokonts [23], some bacteria (e.g. Aquifex aeolicus
[24,25]) and some additional archaea (e.g. Pyrobaculum
aerophilum [24]) have lost their RNase P RNA. The
archaeon Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus
may be a transition towards the loss of RNase P RNA,
which is catalytically inactive in this organism but can
be “repaired” by a few substitutions [26].
The length of most RNase P RNA lies between 250 nt
and 550 nt. It is divided into two structural domains:
The S-domain repsonsible for binding and the catalytically active C-domain [27], see Figure 1. The secondary
structure of RNase P RNA consists of up to 19 conserved stems, denoted P1 to P19, of which P7 to P14
form the S-domain, which is flanked by the C-domain
[28]. There are five regions with strong sequence conservation, designated CR-I to CR-V, including the P4
pseudoknot composed by CR-I and CR-V [29].
The RNase P RNA structures can be broadly assigned
to five subfamilies: the bacterial types A and B (bacA and
bacB), the archaeal types A and M (arcA and arcM), and
a single eukaryote group (nucA) [30]. In addition, two
eukaryotic subtypes in fungi (fugA & fugB) can be identified [31]. The types arcA and bacA, which have been
identified as ancestral states [32], cover the majority of
microbial rnpB genes, forming diverse sets in terms of
both sequence and structure variation. The derived types
arcM and bacB, in contrast, have more uniform members. The diversity is largest among eukaryotic RNase P
RNA genes. In eukaryotes, RNase P RNA is transcribed
by polymerase III [33]. The human promoter elements
were described recently [34] to contain TATA-box, PSE,
Oct and SP1/SPH elements within 100 nt upstream of
the transcription initiation site. A comparison of all
eukaryotic promoter elements showed weak similarities
only in the TATA box.
In this contribution we are concerned with the detection of RNase P RNA genes in genomic data from all
domains of life. In [29], a pattern matching based pipeline for efficient rnpB gene prediction has been proposed.

It is not applicable to large-scale database searches in
practice, however. Here, we present Bcheck, a wrapper,
to perform efficient rnpB gene prediction by combining
the fast filtering with rnabob[17] and the sensitive validation by Infernal. The construction of such a
method entails two tasks: the design of an efficient yet
sensitive descriptor model (DM) that acts as a filter, and
the derivation of a sensitive statistics covariance model
(CM). Both components are based on a careful analysis
of published RNase P RNA sequences and structures.
The success of Bcheck depends on the efficiency and
predictive power of both models, as well as a sensible
wrapping algorithm that optimizes the interplay of DM
and CM.

2 Results
2.1 Algorithm and models

The construction of effective models of RNase P RNA
genes is a non-trivial task because of the lack of strong
family-specific conservation. Our strategy was to first
classify the training sequences into the seven subfamilies identified in the literature: arcA, arcM, bacA,
bacB, nucA, fugA and fugB. The training set consists of
sequences from the RNase P RNA Database [35] with
intact secondary structures annotated, and additional
RNase P RNA sequences from the Rfam and from two
recent publications [23,36]. A set of randomized decoys
as well as randomized genomic sequences were constructed using ushuffle[37] in order to determine the
false positive rates.
The training of both DM and CM requires structural
alignments, whose quality is crucial for both the automatic learning procedures of the Infernal CMs and
the manual construction of the DMs. We adopted a
multi-step strategy: The RNase P RNA sequences were
first divided into structural elements, then base-pairing
regions were structure-aligned manually, and loop
regions were sequence-aligned by means of MUSCLE
[38]. Local alignments were then recombined into a
“raw” global alignment for each subfamily. These alignments contained errors, mainly caused by local foldings
which were not fitting to the conservation patterns
shared by the majority of members. We applied RNAfold [39,40] to check the thermodynamic plausibility
of local structure elements. Construction of DMs started
with these alignments. In the course of DM construction, outliers were temporarily removed from the alignments, searched with the preliminary DMs, which
provided additional information to guide the re-insertion
of the outlier into the alignment.
Since efficiency was the major focus of DM training, we
focused on selected features of local regions. To gain consensus sequence information, each alignment column was
summarized and assigned with standard, “ambiguous”

IUPAC nucleotides (taking into account every nucleotide
appearing in the column) or the gap character (whenever
the column contained at least one gap). The sequence was
edited to take established structural knowledge into
account. The resulting consensus sequence was then
annotated in the alignment.
The RALEE mode [41] in the emacs editor was used
for visually inspecting alignments, consensus structures
and conservation patterns. Regions with rich conservation in sequence and/or structure were selected for
inclusion in the descriptor. A simple example of constructing DM from alignment is shown in Figure 2. The
DM for RNase P RNA genes mainly consists of the Sdomain and its flanking conserved sequences. Once the
feature selection was completed, we carried out a interactive process between DM building and DM testing to
adjust the parameters of feature variables balancing

between false positive rate and efficiency. Among several
descriptor languages we chose rnabob as search engine
for our DMs because of its convenient syntax and its
speed.
For the subfamilies arcA, bacA, and nuc with strong
variation, we constructed two variants, “DM selective”
and “DM general”, with different parameter settings.
The selective DMs miss a few aberrant RNase P RNA
genes, while the “DM general” models have a larger
false positive rate. For each subfamily, only one CM is
needed and automatically generated based on global
structural alignment using the tools of the Infernal
package.
The Bcheck wrapping algorithm takes the strategy of
local to global and selective to general, Figure 3. At first,
subfamily-specific DMs locate candidate genes. If no
valid hit was produced by the “selective” model, the

corresponding “DM general” is applied. Then the CM is
applied in local alignment mode to validate the candidate. Valid hits, i.e., those recognized by the CM, are
extended by 150 nt and 300 nt at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and fed to the CM in global alignment to produce
better estimates of the ends. At both phases, an E-value
threshold of E ≤ 10-10 must be reached.
To distinguish functional copy and pseudogene of
eukaryotes, we analyzed their promoter regions. For this
purpose we aligned 100 nt upstream of Polymerase III
transcripts of the same organism and compared the

entire computation, which surveyed 3.1G of input
sequence, took approximately 4 hours to complete with
a single core of 2.4 GHz Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU.
Bcheck produced one hit per organism for 98% (1005)
of organisms, see Table 1. The default algorithm yielded
no prediction in 29 organisms, for 10 of which a direct
CM search was successful. These 10 RNase P RNA
genes are distributed over all 4 prokaryotic sub-families.
The main reason of failure is because of unusual local
variations, e.g. bulges or point mutations, which cannot
be captured by the present DMs. Bcheck predictions
for three members of the phylum Chloroflex (Roseiflexus
castenholzii, Roseiflexus RS-1, and Chloroflexus aggregans) are only partial rnpB regions including partial-P11,
P12 and junctions between two stems. After removing
duplicate sequences from closely related strains, we
obtained 777 unique rnpB genes of which 45 belong to
arcA, 10 to arcM, 621 to bacA, and 101 to bacB, see
Table 3 below.
The GenBank files contained annotated rnpB genes
for 365 bacteria and 22 archaea, all of which were
among the Bcheck predictions. We then compared
start-end positions of Bcheck predictions and GenBank annotations. Only 25% of the annotations agree
within a discrepancy of 5 nt or less at both ends.
Inspection of sequences and predicted secondary
structures shows that the published sequences are in
general incomplete, lacking nucleotides at the 5′ end of
P4 and 3′ end of P4: At the 5′ end, 66% known annotations miss flanking regions of P4, ranging from 30 to 90
nucleotides. At the 3′ end, 56% known annotations miss
flanking regions of P4’, ranging from 10 to 20 nucleotides. A few of the GenBank annotations, furthermore,
have promoter or terminator sequences included.
Bcheck thus provides a substantial improvement also
of the existing annotations in most cases.
The published annotation is more accurate than the
Bcheck prediction only in a single case: Roseiflexus RS
1. In five cases, the published annotations and the
Bcheck results differ dramatically. In order to evaluate
these cases further, we employed the CM model of the
Rfam, which supported the authenticity of the Bcheck
predictions, Table 2.

2.2.2 RNase P RNA genes in metagenomic sequences

The GOS metagenomic sequences were obtained from
the CAMERA project [42]. Due to the taxonomic uncertainty of the GOS data set, all models of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes were applied to search over 10
million sequences comprising about 18 G. No hit was
produced by any of the eukaryotic models.
In total, Bcheck predicted 4675 rnpB genes with
median E-values of 10-78. In 211 cases two models overlap. In these cases there is a clear difference in E-values,
so that the assignment to domains is unambiguous in all
positive cases. After duplication removal, 2909 rnpB
sequences are unique, 2857 of which belong to bacA, 49
to arcA, 3 to bacB, but none for arcM, see Table 3.
The ancestral types arcA and bacA are clearly predominant in both GenBank and GOS data set. In the
marine samples, the number of bacA rnpB genes
exceeds 95%. We compared rnpB sequences from two
datasets with respect to their GC content, Figure 4. Differences are particularly obvious in bacteria, where the
majority of GOS bacA sequences have low GC-content,
while the median GC content of GenBank rnpB is high,
with ≈ 0.6. The GC content of RNaseP RNA genes
seems to be influenced by the environment, which
agrees to the findings of Foerstner et al. [43], showing
the GC content of complex microbial communities
seems to be globally and actively influenced by the
environment.
Obtaining a view of the taxonomic distribution within
a microbial community is one central objective of metagenomic analysis. We used the detected rnpB genes as a
marker to infer the taxonomic distribution of GOS samples. We used blast to find the closest orthologs of
2909 unique GOS rnpB genes among the 777 GenBank

scoring orthologs are found for 1003 GOS rnpB genes.
914 of which have only one ortholog per gene making
species assignments possible, while 39 have multiple
orthologs, all coming from the same genus, making
genus assignments possbile. These species assignments
and genus assignments are shown in Figure 5. The identified organisms are mostly bacteria belonging to the

three phyla proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes. Only a single archaeon, Nitrosopumilus maritimus, is recognized. Among bacteria, most sequences
belong to Pelagibacter ubique (75%) and Prochlorococcus
marinus (13%). For 1906 GOS rnpBs (66%), no close
homologs are known, suggesting that they derive from
unknown species. Of these, 1859 (97.5%) belong to the
bacA subfamily, 44 (2.3%) to the arcA subfamily, and 3
(0.1%) to the bacB subfamily.

We investigated 237 eukaryotic genomes, Table 4. Of
the previously annotated genes, we recovered 84 of 85
metazoan and 19 of 21 fungal RNase P RNA genes. We
miss the Otolemur garnetti sequence because of a 3 nt
insertion within the highly conserved P4, which is used
as a block in most descriptors. For the two related fungi
Coprinus cinereus and Laccaria bicolor hypothetical
RNase P RNA genes have been reported [23]. However,
the E-values assigned by the Bcheck CM is mediocre,
and the insertions of several ‘U’s within the ‘GAA’ motif
of the P4 5’ region as well as point mutations cause failure of the Bcheck DM. On the other hand, compared
to [23,44]Bcheck made novel predictions for 32 fungi
and 4 metazoans (Meloidogyne hapla, Aedes aegypti,
Canis familiaris, and Taeniopygia guttata), as well as
the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis.
Strong promoter signals were identified for Meloidogyne
hapla and Monosiga brevicollis, supporting that these candidates are functional copies. For 36 metazoan genomes,
Bcheck made multiple predictions. In at least 16 cases,

additional predictions are highly similar to the functional
copy. In genome sequence assembly, the reads originating
from different copies of a repeat appear identical and
cause assembly errors.
Therefore these predictions seem to be due to assembly errors rather than constituting true paralogs. In the
other 20 cases differences in the flanking regions and
the RNase P RNA gene itself indicate that we see the
results of gene duplications. Even though the promoter
might be specific for an organism, it may differ from
other polymerase III transcripts within one species. In
each of these cases, a presumably functional RNase P
RNA like promoter structure was found for only one of
the copies. Similar duplication patterns are observed in
closely related primate, fish and rodent. For instance,
both Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes have functional
copies on chromosome 14 and a pseudogene on chromosome 4. Among teleosts, both Danio rerio and Gasterosteus aculeatus have their functional copies and
pseudogenes on the chromosome 2. In rodent family,
Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus have the pseudogenes spreading on at least 4 different chromosomes.
Novel RNase P RNA genes were detected by Bcheck
in many fungi, which had not been analyzed in much
detail so far. Only eight sequences which were reported
before were not recognized by Bcheck. In 119
sequences Bcheck found 37 novel RNase P RNA genes.
The remaining 82 genomes are either unfinished drafts,
so that the RNase P RNA is not contained in the data,
or they belong to clades where RNase P RNA may be
absent. In plants, red algae, and heterokonts RNase
MRP RNA, an ancient paralog of RNase P RNA, is well
described [23,34]. One may speculate that it substitutes
for RNase P RNA in these clades, in particular given
that multiple copies of RNase MRP RNA are present in
plant genomes. A recent, detailed overview of the evolution of RNase P RNA and its associated proteins can be
found in [23,44]. An incomplete genome assembly
explains e.g. the deviant RNase P RNA in the genome of
the elephant (Loxodonta africanus), which shows a

2.3 Software, webserver, and database

Bcheck was written in Python (version 2.5.2). Input
consists of DNA or RNA sequences in fasta format, predictions are output with fasta format or with secondary
structure annotated. Besides the default search algorithm, Bcheck also gives the option for searching with
CM only. However, CM-only search is at least 100
times slower.
We set up a Bcheck webserver to facilitate online
RNase P RNA gene prediction. A searchable rnpB database was developed, including genes for 1005 microbial
organisms, 147 eukaryote organisms and 4756 GOS
sample sequences. The predicted pseudogenes for eukaryote organisms are also included. The “rnpB database”
uses a hierarchical tree structure, consisting of 5 tables,
implementing preorder tree traversal algorithm to process the query efficiently. blast is also offered in the
server for homology search against the database compromising 777 unique rnpB genes. The server can be
accessed at http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/bcheck. The
Bcheck-pipeline can also be downloaded from the
same location for local use in a Linux environment.

3 Discussion and conclusions
The rapidly increasing size of sequence databases
requires efficient tools for data analysis. In particular,
homology annotation of small ncRNAs, with their short
and often poorly conserved sequences poses a severe
problem for large-scale annotation. Here, we describe
Bcheck, an efficient pipeline to determine RNase P
RNA genes across all three domains of life. In order to
deal with the high variability of the RNase P RNA
sequences and structures, we employ descriptor-based
models specific for sub-families instead of a single pattern to construct more efficient filters. In the second
step, improved covariance models are used to validate
the candidates from the DM step and to determine
nearly exact gene boundaries.
With Bcheck, we were able to determine the RNase
P RNA genes in 59 out of 68 archaea, 946 out of 956
bacteria, and 147 out of 237 eukaryotes. 61% of the prokaryotic sequences and 25% of eukaryotic results were
not annotated previously. The quality of the predicted
rnpB genes is much better than a large fraction of the usually blast-based - annotation available through
GenBank. The size and diversity of eukaryote genomes
brings with it a particular challenge in finding RNase P

aberrant features of the RNase P RNA itself. Using the
fungi-specific DMs, we uncovered 32 previously unannotated sequences, which are downloadable from the
Bcheck server. As in previous studies, we did not find
RNase P RNA candidates in plants and Heterokonta.
Since Bcheck is more than 100 times faster than the
direct application of Infernal (version 1.0), it is suitable in particular as a tool to screen large high-throughput sequencing data. With only a handful of false
negatives (10 out of 1005 prokaryotes), Bcheck provides a highly efficient way to annotate newly sequenced
genomes. A particular strength of Bcheck is its applicability to metagenomics data.
Among the 19 prokaryotic genomes for which
Bcheck failed to detect a candidate, 15 have a size
below 2.0 Mbp. One of them, Nanoarchaeum equitans,
is among three organisms having extremely condensed
genomes with length even below 0.5 Mbp. Nanoarchaeum equitans appears to have lost its RNase P RNA
through genomic rearrangement at tRNA genes under
the pressure of genome condensation [18]. In Figure 6
we summarize the correlations between genome size
and the size of prokaryotic RNase P RNA. Even though
there is no strong correlation indicated in arcA and
bacA subfamilies, the evolutionarily younger bacB and
arcM seem to be more strongly affected by changes in
genome size.
At present, Bcheck models were built on the conserved sequence and secondary structure features of a

large sample of RNase P RNA genes. Conceivably, the
predictive power of the pipeline could be improved
further by including additional information. For
instance, promoter and terminator regions might be utilized. A recent survey for 7SK RNAs capitalized largely
on the conserved features of the characteristic pol-III
promoter signals of this ncRNA class [45]. A similar
strategy might allow a further relaxation of the DM pattern in favor of a second filter utilizing the promoter
and terminator motifs.

Figure 6 Correlation of the size of RNase P RNA genes with
genome size. For bacA (r = 0.16), bacB (r = 0.66), and arcA (r =
0.47) there is a weak but significant positive correlation. The few
sequences of type arcM are significantly shorter and are restricted
to genomes in a very narrow size range.
