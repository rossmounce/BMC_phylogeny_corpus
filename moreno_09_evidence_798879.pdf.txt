Abstract
Background/Aim: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and
mortality in patients affected by hereditary bleeding disorders. HCV, as others RNA virus, exploit
all possible mechanisms of genetic variation to ensure their survival, such as recombination and
mutation. In order to gain insight into the genetic variability of HCV virus strains circulating in
hemophiliac patients, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of HCV strains isolated from 10
patients with this kind of pathology.
Methods: Putative recombinant sequence was identified with the use of GARD program.
Statistical support for the presence of a recombination event was done by the use of LARD
program.
Results: A new intragenotypic recombinant strain (1b/1a) was detected in 1 out of the 10
hemophiliac patient studied. The recombination event was located at position 387 of the HCV
genome (relative to strain AF009606, sub-type 1a) corresponding to the core gene region.
Conclusion: Although recombination may not appear to be common among natural populations
of HCV it should be considered as a possible mechanism for generating genetic diversity in
hemophiliacs patients.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is estimated to infect 170 million
people worldwide and is the major causative agent of post
transfusional hepatitis and parenterally transmitted sporadic non A non B Hepatitis [1]. Hemophiliacs and other
patients with inherited bleeding disorders treated with

non-inactivated clotting factor concentrates prior to the
mid 1980 are at particular risk for acquiring HCV infection. Each clotting factor concentrated were made from
plasma pools prepared from approximately 20000 blood
donors at a time and this provided a single unit risk of
infection of 5%. The introduction of inactivation procePage 1 of 9

dures and blood donor screening for HCV has dramatically improved the safety of pooled plasma products [2,3].
In Uruguay hemophiliac patients were treated with fresh
frozen plasma in the 60 s and with cryoprecipitate (VIII
factor and fibrinogen rich fraction plasma) since the 70 s,
these transfusions were responsible for most of hepatitis
C transmission in hemophiliac. Since the 70 s and mid 80
s, industrial non-inactivated clotting factor was available
in the world but this product was not used in Uruguay
until the 90 s [4].
HCV is a member of the family Flaviviridae. HCV is a single stranded, positive sense, RNA virus with a genome of
approximately 9400 bp [1,5]. Comparison of nucleotide
sequences of variants recovered from different individuals
around the world has revealed the existence of at least six
major genetic groups and an increasing number of subtypes [1,6-8]. Since hemophiliacs were infected by clotting
factors concentrates manufactured from many thousands
of blood donors, the HCV genotype distribution may
reflect that of the donor population. Besides, different
HCV genotypes may have infected the same patient
[3,9,10].
HCV as others RNA virus exploit all possible mechanisms
of genetic variation to ensure their survival. The high rate
of mutation generated by the polymerase and the high
rate of replication of this virus results in the circulation in
vivo of complex population of different but closely related
viral variants, commonly referred to as a quasispecies [1113]. It is known that recombination plays a significant
role in the evolution of RNA viruses by creating genetic
variation. Both inter and intragenotypic recombination
have been reported in HCV populations in different geographic locations like Russia (2 k/1b) [14,15], Peru (1a/
1b) [16], Vietnam (2/6) [17], Philippines (2b/1b) [18],
France (2/5) [19], Uzbekistan (2 k/1b) [20], Japan (1a/1c)
[21] and Ireland [22]. Intra-patient recombination has
also been reported [23,24].
In order to gain insight into the possible role of recombination in shaping the HCV evolution in hemophiliac
patients, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of
HCV strains circulating in Uruguayan patients with clinical diagnosis of this disease. The results of these studies
revealed for the first time the presence of a natural
intragenotypic HCV recombinant strain circulating in a
Uruguayan hemophiliac patient.

Results
To gain insight into the genetic variability of HCV strains
circulating in Uruguayan hemophiliac patients, we first
obtained nucleotide sequences from five different
genomic regions of the HCV genome from strains circulating in these patients. These sequences were aligned with

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/203

corresponding sequences from 35 HCV strains of all types
and sub-types isolated in different geographic regions of
the world, obtained using the HCV LANL database [25].
The origin of the sequences and the strains used are listed
in Table 1. Sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL W
program [26]. Once aligned, we first determined the evolutionary model that best fit our sequence data. Akaike
Information Criteria and Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio
Test showed that the General Time Reversible (GTR) plus
gamma model best fit our sequence data. Using this
model, maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were created for the 5'NCR and the core region. The results of these
studies are shown in Figure 1. All strains in the tree are
assigned according with their genotype. Each cluster is
supported by very high aLRT values (see Figure 1). Interestingly, Uruguayan strain H23, assigned to subtype 1b in
the 5'NCR region, is assigned to subtype 1a in the core
region (compare Figs. 1A and 1B) [GenBank: EU934902EU934907].
The same studies were done for the E2, NS5A and NS5B
regions of the HCV genome. The results of these studies
revealed that Uruguayan strain H23 is assigned to subtype
1a in these regions (data not shown).
To rule out that this results were the consequence of the
co-infection of the patient with two different HCV subtypes and not really a recombinant strain, we amplified by
PCR the 5'NCR-core region of HCV strain H23 (from
nucleotide 9 to 706, relative to the genome of HCV strain
AF009606). Once amplified, sequences from that region
of the genome of strain H23 were obtained by direct
sequencing of the PCR fragment using the same primers
used for amplification. Sequences from the 5'NCR-core
region of HCV H23 strain were aligned with corresponding sequences from the genotype 1 HCV strains shown in
Figure 1 using CLUSTAL W program [26] (see also Table
1). Once aligned, we used GARD to determine the presence of possible recombination break-points [27]. A
recombination break-point is observed at position 379 of
the alignment, representing position 387 of the HCV
genome which corresponds to position 46 of HCV core
gene (relative to strain AF009606) (see Figure 2). Two
putative parental-like strains D11355 (subtype 1b) and
AF009606 (subtype 1a) were identified.
In order to confirm the results obtained using the GARD
approach, sequence alignment between H23 and its putative parental-like strains D11355 (subtype 1b) and
AF009606 (subtype 1a) around the breakpoint were performed and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were
constructed for the sequence alignment before and after
the identified breakpoint. The results of these studies are
shown in Figure 3. As it can be seen in the figure 3B, Uruguayan H23 strain is assigned to subtype 1b using the

alignment from positions 9 to 386, and to subtype 1a
from positions 387 to 706. To confirm that the recombination model we obtained gave a significant better fit to
the data than the null hypothesis of no recombination, we
used LARD program [28] employing a different dataset of
putative parental-like HCV 1a and 1b strains. The results

of these studies are shown in Figure S1 (see Additional
File 1). Simulations of sequence evolution under the null
hypothesis (i.e., no recombination) gave strong statistical
support for the alternative hypothesis of recombination
(P < 0.001).

To further characterize the presence of the recombination
event in Uruguayan HCV H23 strain by other methods,
we employed the Genotyping Tool of NCBI server [29]. As
it can be seen in Figure S2 (see Additional File 2) and in
Table S3 (see Additional File 3), the BLAST scores
obtained in this analysis show the presence of a recombination event in HCV H23 strain.

Discussion
Previous results have consistently given congruent results
for HCV genotyping using different genomic regions [8].
In this study, incongruent results were found for one HCV
strain circulating in a hemophiliac patient when different
genomic regions were used (see Figure 1). This apparent

discrepancy was due to the fact of the presence of a recombination break-point in HCV Uruguayan strain H23 at
position 387 of HCV genome (relative to strain
AF009606) (see Figure 2). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree analysis were performed using partial alignments of the same sequences before and after the
identified break-point which support the presence of a
recombination event at this position (see Figure 3). Moreover, this recombination model has a better statistically
support against the null hypothesis of no recombination
(see Figure S1 in Additional File 1). Furthermore, using a
different set of putative parental-like strains, the Genotyping Tool results revealed BLAST scores that also support

the recombination event (see Figure S2 in Additional File
2 and Table S3 in Additional File 3).
Previous HCV phylogenetic studies have shown that
recombination breakpoints can be detected in non structural and structural regions of the HCV genome [14-22].
Interestingly, the recombination breakpoint identified in
Uruguayan strain H23 is located inside the core Region.
Although recombination does not seem to be a common
event in the evolution of the HCV populations, the results
of these studies reveal that recombination can be considered as an evolutionary mechanism for generating genetic
diversity in HCV populations circulating in Hemophiliac
patients. Due to the fact that these Hemophiliac patients
have been transfused many times, the possibility of being
infected by two different HCV genotypes and subtypes is
higher than in other kind of patients, increasing the possibility of a recombination event to take place.

Conclusion
Given the implications of recombination for virus evolution and the development of vaccines, virus control programs, patient management and antiviral therapies, it is
clearly important to determine the extent to which recombination plays a role in HCV evolution. This study demonstrates the presence of a recombinant 1b/1a HCV strain
circulating in a hemophilic patient. Further studies will be
needed in order to establish the role of recombination
events in shaping the HCV evolution in hemophiliac
patients.

Methods
Serum samples
Serum samples were obtained from 10 Hemophiliac
patients with serological markers for HCV from the Hospital de Clínicas (Montevideo, Uruguay). Patients were
screened using Riba-ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and amplification
HCV RNA was extracted from 140 μl serum samples with
the QIAamp viral RNA Kit (QIAgen) according to the
manufacturer's instruction. The extracted RNA was eluted
from the columns with 50 μl RNAse free water. cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification of the 5' non-coding region
(5'NCR), core, E2, NS5a and NS5b were carried out as previously described [30,31]. The 5'NCR-core PCR from
strain H23 (from nucleotide 9 to 706, relative to the
genome of HCV strain AF009606) was performed as previously described [32]. Amplicons were purified using the
DNA extraction Kit (Fermentas).

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/203

Sequencing
The same primers of the PCR were used for sequencing the
PCR fragments of each region. The sequencing reaction
was done in both strands, and was carried out using the
Big Dye DNA sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer) on a DNA
sequencing apparatus ABI3130 (Perkin Elmer).
Sequence analysis
5'NCR, core, E2, NS5a and NS5b sequences obtained from
Uruguayan hemophiliac patients were aligned with corresponding sequences from strains from all HCV genotypes
and sub-types, isolated in different geographic regions of
the world. Sequences were obtained using the HCV LANL
database (see Table 1) [25]. Sequences were aligned using
the CLUSTAL W program [26]. Once aligned, the best evolutionary model that describe our sequence data was
assessed using the Modelgenerator [33] (Akaike Information Criteria and Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio test indicated that the GTR plus gamma model was the most
appropriate model to represent the sequence data). Using
this model, maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were
constructed using the PhyML program [34,35]. As a measure of the robustness of each node, we employed an
approximate Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT), that assesses
that the branch being studied provides a significant likelihood gain, in comparison with the null hypothesis that
involves collapsing that branch but leaving the rest of the
tree topology identical [36].
Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection (GARD)
Analysis
To detect possible recombination events we used GARD
method (available at http://www.datamonkey.org/
GARD/) for detecting discordant phylogenetic signal in
sequence alignments, which provides estimates of the
number and location of break points and segment-specific phylogenetic trees [27].
Genotyping tool at NCBI
To detect possible HCV recombinant strain sequences, we
used Genotyping Tool at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information
(available
at:
http://
www.ncbi.nih.gov/projects/genotyping/formpage.cgi).
This approach uses BLAST to compare a query sequence to
a set of HCV reference sequences of known genotypes and
sub-types. The query sequence is broken into segments for
comparison to the reference so that the mosaic organization of recombinant sequences could be revealed [29].
LARD (Likelihood Analysis of Recombination in DNA)
analysis
To assess whether the recombination model we obtained
gave a significantly better fit to the data than the null
hypothesis of no recombination, we used LARD program
[28]. Briefly, for every possible breakpoint, the sequence

alignment was divided into two independent regions for
which the branch lengths of a tree of the putative recombinant and its two parent sequences were optimized. The
two results (likelihoods) obtained by using the separate
regions were then combined to give a likelihood score for
that breakpoint position and the breakpoint position that
yielded the highest likelihood then was compared, by
using a likelihood ratio test, to the likelihood obtained
from the same data under a model that permitted no
recombination. The likelihood ratio obtained by using
the real data were evaluated for significance against a null
distribution of likelihood ratios produced by using Monte
Carlo simulation of sequences generated without recombination. Sequences were simulated 1,000 times by using
the maximum likelihood model parameters and sequence
lengths from the real data using Seq-Gen [37].
