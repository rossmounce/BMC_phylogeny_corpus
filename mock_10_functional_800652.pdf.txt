channels

Abstract
Background: The zebrafish has been suggested as a model system for studying human diseases that affect
nervous system function and motor output. However, few of the ion channels that control neuronal activity in
zebrafish have been characterized. Here, we have identified zebrafish orthologs of voltage-dependent Kv3 (KCNC)
K+ channels. Kv3 channels have specialized gating properties that facilitate high-frequency, repetitive firing in fastspiking neurons. Mutations in human Kv3.3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13), an autosomal dominant
genetic disease that exists in distinct neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative forms. To assess the potential
usefulness of the zebrafish as a model system for SCA13, we have characterized the functional properties of
zebrafish Kv3.3 channels with and without mutations analogous to those that cause SCA13.
Results: The zebrafish genome (release Zv8) contains six Kv3 family members including two Kv3.1 genes (kcnc1a
and kcnc1b), one Kv3.2 gene (kcnc2), two Kv3.3 genes (kcnc3a and kcnc3b), and one Kv3.4 gene (kcnc4). Both Kv3.3
genes are expressed during early development. Zebrafish Kv3.3 channels exhibit strong functional and structural
homology with mammalian Kv3.3 channels. Zebrafish Kv3.3 activates over a depolarized voltage range and
deactivates rapidly. An amino-terminal extension mediates fast, N-type inactivation. The kcnc3a gene is alternatively
spliced, generating variant carboxyl-terminal sequences. The R335H mutation in the S4 transmembrane segment,
analogous to the SCA13 mutation R420H, eliminates functional expression. When co-expressed with wild type,
R335H subunits suppress Kv3.3 activity by a dominant negative mechanism. The F363L mutation in the S5
transmembrane segment, analogous to the SCA13 mutation F448L, alters channel gating. F363L shifts the voltage
range for activation in the hyperpolarized direction and dramatically slows deactivation.
Conclusions: The functional properties of zebrafish Kv3.3 channels are consistent with a role in facilitating fast,
repetitive firing of action potentials in neurons. The functional effects of SCA13 mutations are well conserved
between human and zebrafish Kv3.3 channels. The high degree of homology between human and zebrafish Kv3.3
channels suggests that the zebrafish will be a useful model system for studying pathogenic mechanisms in SCA13.

Background
Voltage-dependent Kv3 K + channels have specialized
gating properties, including a depolarized activation
range, fast activation, and very fast deactivation, that
facilitate rapid, repetitive firing in neurons [1,2]. In
mammals, there are four Kv3 genes, KCNC1-KCNC4,
which encode Kv3.1-Kv3.4 [3]. Each gene is alternatively

spliced, generating channel proteins with different carboxyl-terminal sequences [1]. Kv3.3 and Kv3.4 contain
amino-terminal extensions that mediate N-type balland-chain inactivation [1].
Recently, KCNC3, which encodes Kv3.3, was identified
as the gene mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 13
(SCA13) [4,5]. The spinocerebellar ataxias are a group
of 28 human autosomal dominant genetic diseases characterized by motor deficits, eye movement abnormalities, and degeneration of cerebellar neurons [6,7].
SCA13 is the first neurodegenerative disease known to
be caused by mutations in a K+ channel gene [4].

The two originally-identified SCA13 mutations lead to
distinct clinical manifestations that are likely caused by
their differential effects on Kv3.3 function [4]. The
R420H mutation is associated with adult onset, progressive ataxia accompanied by progressive cerebellar degeneration. R420H is located in the S4 transmembrane
segment, the main functional element of the voltage
sensor. This mutation suppresses the amplitude of Kv3
currents by a dominant negative mechanism [4]. In contrast, the F448L mutation is associated with persistent
motor deficits that emerge in infancy. In affected children, the cerebellum is severely shrunken and malformed [8]. F448L is located near the cytoplasmic end
of the S5 transmembrane segment, a region of the protein that couples voltage sensor conformational changes
to opening and closing of the pore [9]. This mutation
affects the unique gating properties of Kv3 channels,
shifting the voltage dependence of pore opening in the
hyperpolarized direction and dramatically slowing channel closure [4]. Interestingly, F448L changes a phenylalanine residue found only in Kv3 channels to leucine, the
residue found at the analogous position in all other Kv
channel subfamilies [3]. As a result, the mutation confers Shaker-like gating properties on Kv3.3 [4]. The distinct clinical manifestations of the R420H and F448L
mutations are not likely to result from differences in
genetic background because there is a strong genotype/
phenotype correlation for age of disease onset in unrelated SCA13 families [5].
Kv3.3 is prominently expressed in cerebellar neurons
[10,11]. Given the importance of Kv3 channels in controlling neuronal firing patterns, the locomotor deficits
and loss of cerebellar neurons seen in SCA13 may result
from changes in the excitability of Kv3.3-expressing
cells. Development of an animal model is essential to
investigate the mechanistic basis of SCA13 and to
explore the connections between electrical excitability,
control of locomotor behavior, and neuronal cell death.
In recent years, the zebrafish, Danio rerio, has been used
extensively to investigate neuronal development. In addition, work from a growing number of laboratories demonstrates that zebrafish has great potential for analyzing
nervous system function [12-16]. The zebrafish has been
suggested as a model system for studying diseases that
affect neuronal function and locomotion [17-19]. As the
first step in assessing the suitability of zebrafish as a model
system for SCA13, we have identified Kv3 family members
in zebrafish and characterized the functional properties of
wild type and mutant Kv3.3 channels.
We report that the zebrafish genome (Zv8) encodes
six Kv3 family members including two Kv3.3 genes,
kcnc3a and kcnc3b. Zebrafish and mammalian Kv3.3
channels exhibit strong functional homology and are
similarly affected by SCA13 mutations. These results

suggest that the zebrafish is a promising model system
for investigating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying
SCA13.

Results and discussion
The zebrafish genome contains six Kv3 family orthologs

To identify members of the KCNC gene family in zebrafish, the Zv8 genome release was queried with multiple
conserved segments of mammalian Kv3 protein sequences
using the program Tblastn. Sequences with the highest
scoring similarity to mammalian Kv3 channels consistently
mapped to six genomic locations (Table 1). In contrast,
lower scoring hits showed greater similarity to members
of other Kv subfamilies (data not shown).
To assemble putative sequences for Kv3 proteins in
zebrafish, predicted coding exons were identified directly
by sequence similarity to the mammalian Kv3 proteins.
Exons encoding the amino terminus, transmembrane
core domain, and proximal carboxyl terminus were
found at each of the six genomic locations (Table 1).
Many of these exons were also recognized by Ensembl
transcript identification algorithms. In addition, each
location contained one or more exons encoding the distal carboxyl terminus, a region that is alternatively
spliced in mammalian Kv3 genes (Table 1).
Phylogenetic identification of Kv3 orthologs in zebrafish

For phylogenetic analysis of the six putative Kv3 genes in
zebrafish, exon sequences encoding the amino terminus,
transmembrane core domain, and proximal carboxyl terminus were assembled and translated. Sequences encoding probable alternatively-spliced, distal carboxyl termini
were not included. The deduced protein sequences were
aligned with ten Kv3 sequences from mammalian,
amphibian, and teleost species using the program MUSCLE v3.7 and the alignment was manually adjusted
(Additional file 1, Fig. S1) [20,21]. The identities of zebrafish Kv3 genes were assigned by bootstrap analysis replicated 100 times using the program PhyML (Fig. 1)
[22,23]. The zebrafish genome contains two KCNC1
(Kv3.1) orthologs, designated kcnc1a and kcnc1b; two
KCNC3 (Kv3.3) orthologs, designated kcnc3a and kcnc3b;
and one ortholog each of KCNC2 (Kv3.2) and KCNC4
(Kv3.4) designated kcnc2 and kcnc4, respectively (Fig. 1,
Table 1). Zebrafish Kv3.3 and Kv3.4 sequences contained
N-terminal extensions as found in their mammalian
counterparts (Additional file 1, Fig. S1) [1]. Over the
aligned region, the amino acid identity between human
Kv3 sequences and their zebrafish orthologs ranged from
64 to 82% (Additional file 1, Fig. S1).
To verify the identity of mammalian KCNC orthologs
in zebrafish, we analyzed synteny between the zebrafish
and mouse genomes using the online program Synteny
Database [24,25]. The strongest syntenic clusters,

The identified exons encode the N-terminus, the S1-S6 membrane domain, the proximal portion of the C-terminus, and one or more putative sequences for the
distal C-terminus, which may be alternatively spliced. The numbers correspond to the chromosomal positions of each exon.

According to Zv8, there is an additional exon encoding a Kv3 N-terminus on chromosome 4 (minus strand) at position 2,762,001. Because previous genome
releases contained stray Kv3 exons that disappeared in subsequent releases, this exon is likely to reflect an assembly error (data not shown).

containing the greatest number of orthologous gene
pairs, were found between chromosomal segments containing the following pairs of zebrafish and mouse
genes: kcnc1b and Kcnc1; kcnc2 and Kcnc2; kcnc3a and
Kcnc3; and kcnc4 and Kcnc4 (Fig. 2 [kcnc3a/Kcnc3 pair]
or data not shown). These results confirm the evolutionary relationship between genes encoding Kv3 family
members in zebrafish and mammals.
To verify the existence of paralogous kcnc1 and kcnc3
genes in zebrafish, we used Synteny Database to identify
regions of conserved synteny on chromosomes 7 and
25 (kcnc1a and kcnc1b) and chromosomes 3 and
24 (kcnc3a and kcnc3b) (Fig. 3 [chromosome 3/24 pair]
or data not shown) [24,25]. As expected, the

chromosomal segments containing kcnc1a/kcnc1b and
kcnc3a/kcnc3b pairs showed the strongest synteny in the
zebrafish genome. The identification of two kcnc1 and
two kcnc3 paralogs in zebrafish reflects genome duplication that occurred early during teleost evolution, after
divergence of mammalian and teleost ancestors [26].
The zebrafish genome contains two functional Kv3.3
paralogs

According to the Zv8 genome release, plausible Kv3 genes
were located at five of the six identified genomic locations.
Putative coding exons were encoded on a single strand
and were located in the correct order along the chromosome (Table 1). In contrast, the Kv3.3 gene on

Figure 2 Synteny between kcnc3a on zebrafish chromosome 3 and Kcnc3 on mouse chromosome 7. Using Synteny Database, synteny in
the vicinity of Kv3.3 genes was analyzed using zebrafish (Zv8) as the source genome and mouse (m37) as the outgroup [24,25]. The strongest
synteny (greatest number of orthologous gene pairs) occurred between the segments of zebrafish chromosome 3 and mouse chromosome 7
that contain the kcnc3a and Kcnc3 genes, respectively. The approximate positions of kcnc3a and Kcnc3 are marked in red. Other orthologous
pairs of genes are connected by lines. Subclusters of genes identified during the same pass of the sliding window are indicated using lines of
the same color. Non-paired genes are not shown. The figure depicts the relative locations of genes but is not drawn to physical scale. Synteny
was also detected between the regions of zebrafish chromosome 24 and mouse chromosome 7 that contain kcnc3b and Kcnc3, respectively
(data not shown).

chromosome 24, kcnc3b, was rearranged (Table 1).
Because the genome assembly is preliminary, this does not
preclude the presence of an intact Kv3.3 gene on chromosome 24.
We used reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to
determine whether kcnc3a and kcnc3b are functional
genes that are transcribed and appropriately spliced in
zebrafish. RNA was extracted from embryos at 2 to 3
days post fertilization and amplified using gene-specific
primers located in different exons. Each primer set
yielded products of the expected size for a properly

transcribed and spliced mRNA (Fig. 4A-C; additional
file 2, Fig. S2). Using RT-PCR, we cloned and sequenced
cDNAs corresponding to kcnc3a and kcnc3b amplified
from embryonic cDNA or an adult retinal cDNA library.
Their nucleic acid and predicted protein sequences
matched the genomic sequences found on chromosomes
3 and 24, respectively (Additional file 1, Fig. S1; Fig. 5).
The Kv3.3 paralogs are closely related. From the amino
terminus through the proximal carboxyl terminus, the
predicted amino acid sequences of kcnc3a and kcnc3b
are 89% identical (Fig. 5). RT-PCR analysis indicated

Synteny was detected and has been depicted as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

that kcnc3a mRNA is alternatively spliced, leading to
protein variants with different carboxyl-terminal
sequences (Fig. 4D). We conclude that there are two
functional Kv3.3 genes in the zebrafish genome, despite
the fact that one of them is not co-linear in the Zv8
genome release.
Kv3 subfamily-specific gating properties are conserved in
zebrafish Kv3.3

To characterize the functional properties of zebrafish
Kv3.3 channels, cDNA sequences encoding the two

kcnc3a carboxyl-terminal splice variants were cloned
into the Bluescript vector for in vitro transcription of
RNA. RNA encoding each splice variant was separately
injected into Xenopus oocytes for voltage clamp analysis
(Fig. 6). Zebrafish Kv3.3 channels were robustly active
with properties expected for a member of the Kv3
family [1,4]. Significant activation was detected starting
at -20 mV (Fig. 6A). In contrast, in Shaker, a member of
the Kv1 family, currents are typically detected between
-50 and -40 mV. The probability of Kv3.3 channel opening, determined from normalized isochronal tail current

kcnc3b-specific primers. Lane 1: Product of kcnc3a-specific primers in exons 1 and 2 as indicated in cartoon below gel, which shows the
conserved genomic arrangement of Kv3 protein coding exons 1 (N terminus), 2 (S1-S6 membrane domain), 3 (proximal C terminus), and 4 (distal
C terminus) (Table 1). Cartoon is not drawn to scale. Lane 2: Product of kcnc3b-specific primers in exons 2 and 3. B), C) Mixed primers from
kcnc3a and kcnc3b fail to amplify products. Lanes 1: In B, product of kcnc3a-specific primers in exons 1 and 4 (specific for ‘PSIL’ carboxyl terminus
[see part D]); In C, product of kcnc3b-specific primers in exons 2 and 4. Lanes 2: In B, mixture of kcnc3a-specific primer in exon 1 and kcnc3bspecific primer in exon 4; In C, mixture of kcnc3b-specific primer in exon 2 and kcnc3a-specific primer in exon 4. Primer sequences are provided
in additional file 2, Fig. S2. D) Distal carboxyl termini generated by alternative splicing of kcnc3a have been aligned with orthologous sequences
from rat Kcnc3 gene. Identical residues are shown in caps. RT-PCR analysis indicates that both kcnc3a variants are expressed in embryonic
zebrafish (data not shown). Both kcnc3a variants, ending in ‘WIKP’ or ‘PSIL’, were cloned for functional analysis. Only one exon encoding the
distal carboxyl terminus of kcnc3b has been identified in Zv8. Accession numbers for rat splice variants: [GenBank:AY179603.1, GenBank:
AY179604.1].

amplitudes, increased steeply between -20 and 0 mV,
with a midpoint voltage (V 1/2 ) of -13.8 mV (Fig. 6B).
Upon repolarization to the holding voltage, channels
closed rapidly (see below). We conclude that the novel
gating properties of Kv3 channels from higher vertebrates are conserved in zebrafish Kv3.3, consistent with
a role in facilitating fast, repetitive firing in neurons.
Alternative splicing of the carboxyl terminus had no
significant effect on channel function (Fig. 6B, C). Similarly, alternative splicing of mammalian Kv3 genes does
not alter the functional properties of the channel [1,27].
Instead, different Kv3 carboxyl termini may be involved
in targeting channel proteins to different subcellular
compartments [27].
Zebrafish Kv3.3 currents showed prominent inactivation (Fig. 6A, C). Zebrafish channels inactivated more
quickly than human Kv3.3 (data not shown), presumably
because the amino terminal extension is shorter in the
fish protein (Additional file 1, Fig. S1; Fig. 5) [28]. Deleting the amino terminal extension removed fast inactivation, indicating that zebrafish Kv3.3, like mammalian
Kv3.3 channels, is subject to N-type ball and chain inactivation (Fig. 6D) [1,28]. Co-expression of the non-

inactivating zebrafish Kv3.3 with wild type human Kv3.3
produced currents with intermediate inactivation
kinetics, consistent with co-assembly of the human and
zebrafish subunits into functional tetrameric channels,
as expected (data not shown) [29].
Mammalian Kv3 channels are highly sensitive to the
pore blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) [1]. Unlike
most K+ channels, which have a lower affinity for TEA,
mammalian Kv3 channels are nearly completely blocked
by 1 mM TEA [1]. To investigate the TEA sensitivity of
zebrafish Kv3.3 channels, currents were recorded in the
presence and absence of 1 mM TEA (Fig. 7). At +80
mV, 1 mM TEA blocked 91% ± 1% of the Kv3.3 current
amplitude (mean ± SEM, n = 4). We conclude that high
sensitivity to TEA is conserved in zebrafish Kv3.3
channels.
SCA13 mutations have conserved functional effects in
human and zebrafish Kv3.3

To explore further the functional relationship between
zebrafish and mammalian Kv3.3 channels, we introduced into kcnc3a two SCA13 mutations corresponding
to R420H and F448L in human Kv3.3 (Fig. 8). Similarly

Figure 6 Conserved gating properties in zebrafish Kv3.3 channels. A) Wild type zebrafish Kv3.3 currents were evoked by pulsing from -90
mV to voltages ranging from -80 to +60 mV in 10 mV increments. The bath contained 4 mM K+. The -10 mV trace is labeled for comparison to
Fig. 10A. The traces were obtained using the kcnc3a WIKP splice variant (see Fig. 4D). B) Normalized amplitudes of isochronal tail currents have
been plotted versus voltage. Tail currents were recorded in an 89 mM Rb+ bath solution. The membrane was pulsed from -90 to +60 mV for 15
ms prior to repolarization to -90 mV. Data were fitted with a single Boltzmann function to obtain values for the midpoint voltage (V1/2) and
slope factor, which were -13.8 ± 0.3 mV and 6.6 ± 0.1 mV, respectively (n = 5). Black squares, kcnc3a WIKP splice variant; blue circles: kcnc3a PSIL
splice variant (see Fig. 4D). C) Currents were evoked by pulsing from -90 mV to +20 mV. Black trace: kcnc3a WIKP variant; blue trace: kcnc3a PSIL
variant (see Fig. 4D). Traces were scaled to the same amplitude and overlaid. D) The N-terminal extension of Kv3.3 between the first and second
methionine residues was removed by mutating the initial ATG. Current traces were evoked by pulsing from -90 mV to voltages ranging from -80
to +60 mV in 10 mV increments. Currents are shown on a compressed time scale. The traces were obtained using the kcnc3a WIKP splice variant
(see Fig. 4D).

to R420H, the corresponding mutation R335H was not
functional when expressed alone but exerted a dominant
negative effect on the activity of the zebrafish wild type
subunit (Fig. 9). Because SCA13 is an autosomal dominant disease, the dominant negative effect of R420H,
recapitulated in R335H, is likely essential to the etiology
of adult onset ataxia and neurodegeneration in affected
individuals [4].
F363L in kcnc3a corresponds to the human mutation
F448L, which alters channel gating and causes infant

onset motor problems and maldevelopment of the cerebellum [4]. F363L generated functional channels in
oocytes. Significant activation was detected at -40 to -30
mV, indicating that the voltage dependence of pore
opening was shifted in the hyperpolarized direction (Fig.
10A). The midpoint voltage for activation, determined
from the amplitudes of normalized isochronal tail currents, was -21.4 mV, corresponding to a shift of -7.6
mV compared to wild type Kv3.3 (Fig. 10B). For comparison, the analogous mutation in human Kv3.3

Figure 7 TEA sensitivity of zebrafish Kv3.3 channels. Zebrafish Kv3.3 currents were recorded in the absence (left) or presence (middle) of 1
mM TEA-Cl. TEA block is fully reversible (right, recorded after TEA washout). Currents were evoked by stepping from -90 mV to voltages ranging
from -60 to +80 mV in 20 mV increments. The traces were obtained using the kcnc3a WIKP splice variant (see Fig. 4D).

(F448L) shifts activation ~12 mV in the hyperpolarized
direction [4].
Similarly to the human mutation, F363L dramatically
slowed channel deactivation (Fig. 10C). Tail currents,
evoked in an 89 mM Rb+ bath solution by repolarizing
the membrane from +40 to -90 mV, were fitted with a
single exponential function to characterize deactivation
kinetics (Fig. 10D). Values of τdeact in wild type Kv3.3
and the F363L mutant were 1.8 ms and 23.3 ms, respectively. Thus, F363L slowed channel closing by ~13-fold
at -90 mV. For comparision, the analogous mutation in
human Kv3.3 (F448L) slowed channel closing by ~7-fold
at -90 mV [4]. Therefore, like its human counterpart,
the F363L mutation specifically affects the voltage
dependence of activation and the kinetics of channel
closing, converting the unique Kv3 gating properties to
more closely resemble those of a Shaker-type channel

[4]. Our results demonstrate that SCA13 mutations have
similar effects on human and zebrafish Kv3.3 channels,
confirming that there is strong functional homology
between Kv3.3 in teleost and mammalian species [30].

Conclusions
Genes encoding the voltage-dependent Kv3.1, Kv3.2,
Kv3.3, and Kv3.4 K + channels have been identified in
the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Two paralogous genes exist
for both Kv3.1 and Kv3.3, reflecting an ancient genome
duplication in the teleost line during evolution [26]. The
unique gating properties of Kv3 channels are conserved
in zebrafish Kv3.3, suggesting that Kv3 channels play an
essential role in facilitating fast spiking in zebrafish neurons. SCA13 mutations have very similar effects on the
activity of human and zebrafish Kv3.3 channels, indicating that the mutations affect fundamental channel

locations of the R335H and F363L mutations. The S1-S6 transmembrane segments, the re-entrant pore (P) loop, and the amino and carboxyl
termini are labeled. Brackets denote the voltage sensor domain (S1-S4) and pore region (S5-P-S6). Circled plus signs in S4 indicate positivelycharged arginine residues that sense voltage [35,36]. The third circle contains an H denoting the R335H mutation. Circled L in S5 indicates the
location of the F363L mutation.

properties that have been conserved during evolution.
Our results suggest that expressing SCA13 mutant subunits in zebrafish will provide an animal model useful
for investigating the cellular basis of SCA13.

Methods
Bioinformatic, phylogenetic, and syntenic analysis

The current Ensembl genome release (Zv8) was probed
with mammalian Kv3 sequences using Tblastn to identify coding exons, which were assembled and translated.
Sequences were aligned with the sequences of Kv3
family members from mammalian, amphibian, and teleost species using the program Muscle v3.7 and the
alignment was manually adjusted (Additional file 1, Fig.
S1) [20,21]. A phlyogenetic tree was constructed with
the program PhyML using 100 bootstrapping replicates
and the Jones, Taylor, Thornton amino acid substitution
model [22,23]. Synteny was evaluated for each Kv3
family member using the program Synteny Database
with zebrafish (release Zv8) as the source genome,
mouse (release m37) as the outgroup, and a sliding window size of 100 genes [24,25]. This program is designed
for analyzing genomes that have undergone complete
duplication during evolution. It identifies pairwise clusters of orthologs and paralogs simultaneously.
Cloning and mutagenesis

Full length kcnc3a cDNA clones with the WIKP or PSIL
alternatively spliced carboxyl termini were cloned by
RT-PCR using gene specific primers designed from Zv8
genomic sequences (Fig. 4D). Amplified sequences were
inserted into Bluescript. Mutations were generated in
the WIKP splice variant using the QuikChange method
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutations were verified by
sequencing. Linearized plasmid DNA was transcribed
using the mMessage mMachine T7 or T7 Ultra kit
(Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA for each splice variant was
separately injected into Xenopus oocytes using standard
methods [31,32].
Electrophysiology

One to two days after RNA injection, ionic currents
were recorded at room temperature (20-22°C) using a
Warner OC-725C two electrode voltage clamp [31,32].
Electrodes were filled with 3 M KCl and had resistances
of 0.3-1.0 MΩ. Oocytes were bathed in 85 mM NaCl,
4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. To
record tail currents, 85 mM NaCl +4 mM KCl was
replaced by 89 mM RbCl. Pulse protocols were generated and data were acquired using pClamp software
(Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were sampled
at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel

Page 11 of 12

filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA). Linear capacitive and leak currents were subtracted using a P/-4 protocol [33].
Currents were evoked by pulsing from a holding
potential of -90 mV to voltages ranging from -80 mV to
+60 mV in 10 mV increments. The probability of channel opening as a function of voltage was determined
from isochronal tail current amplitudes. Tail current
amplitudes were normalized by the maximum value
obtained in the experiment and plotted versus voltage.
Data were fitted with a single Boltzmann function to
determine values for the midpoint potential (V1/2) and
slope factor. Deactivation kinetics were measured from
tail currents evoked by pulsing to +40 mV before repolarizing to -90 mV. Tail currents were fitted with a single exponential function to obtain values for the
deactivation time constant (τdeact).
