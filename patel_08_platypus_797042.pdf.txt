Abstract
Background: Vertebrate alpha (α)- and beta (β)-globin gene families exemplify the way in which
genomes evolve to produce functional complexity. From tandem duplication of a single globin locus,
the α- and β-globin clusters expanded, and then were separated onto different chromosomes. The
previous finding of a fossil β-globin gene (ω) in the marsupial α-cluster, however, suggested that
duplication of the α-β cluster onto two chromosomes, followed by lineage-specific gene loss and
duplication, produced paralogous α- and β-globin clusters in birds and mammals. Here we analyse
genomic data from an egg-laying monotreme mammal, the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), to
explore haemoglobin evolution at the stem of the mammalian radiation.
Results: The platypus α-globin cluster (chromosome 21) contains embryonic and adult α- globin
genes, a β-like ω-globin gene, and the GBY globin gene with homology to cytoglobin, arranged as
5'-ζ-ζ'-αD-α3-α2-α1-ω-GBY-3'. The platypus β-globin cluster (chromosome 2) contains single
embryonic and adult globin genes arranged as 5'-ε-β-3'. Surprisingly, all of these globin genes were
expressed in some adult tissues. Comparison of flanking sequences revealed that all jawed
vertebrate α-globin clusters are flanked by MPG-C16orf35 and LUC7L, whereas all bird and mammal
β-globin clusters are embedded in olfactory genes. Thus, the mammalian α- and β-globin clusters
are orthologous to the bird α- and β-globin clusters respectively.
Conclusion: We propose that α- and β-globin clusters evolved from an ancient MPG-C16orf35-αβ-GBY-LUC7L arrangement 410 million years ago. A copy of the original β (represented by ω in
marsupials and monotremes) was inserted into an array of olfactory genes before the amniote
radiation (>315 million years ago), then duplicated and diverged to form orthologous clusters of βglobin genes with different expression profiles in different lineages.

Background
The evolution of the vertebrate globin superfamily has
been extensively studied for many decades by comparing
the structure and function of members of the gene families. These are principally haemoglobin, myoglobin,
cytoglobin and neuroglobin and, more recently, globin X
(in fish and amphibians [1]) and globin Y (specific to
amphibians [2]).
Haemoglobin genes (alpha- and beta-globin) are of particular interest because of their critical role in oxygen
transportation from the respiratory surfaces to the inner
organs, and because of the dire effects of mutations in
human globin genes that cause haemoglobinopathies [3].
The genes contained in the alpha (α)- and beta (β)-globin
clusters are expressed at different stages of development
and in different tissues. Together, gene products from
both clusters form the functional tetrameric haemoglobin
molecules needed to fulfil oxygen requirements.
The evolutionary history of α- and β-globin genes can be
traced back to the common ancestors of fish, amphibians
and amniotes (reptiles, birds and mammals), by comparing gene structure and composition of α- and β-globin
clusters across vertebrates. In the amphibians Xenopus laevis and X. tropicalis, α- and β-globin genes are tightly juxtaposed as 5'-α-β-3' [2,4-6]. In the Antarctic notothenioid
fish (Notothenia coriiceps, N. angustata, Trematomus hansoni, T. pennellii), there is also a single 5'-α-β-3' locus [7],
although in pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) there are two globin
clusters (one with α-globin genes and the other with both
α- and β-globin genes), which are located on different
chromosomes [8].
In amniotes, α- and β-globin clusters are located on different chromosomes. It was proposed that the ancestral αand β-globin genes were located together in the common
ancestor of amniotes, as they are in fish and amphibians,
but became separated, either by chromosome fission or
translocation between α- and β-genes, or by chromosome/genome or in trans duplication and gene loss [5].
Further duplications then occurred in amniote lineages.
The ancestral α-globin gene is thought to have duplicated
twice before the divergence of the bird-mammalian lineages, to produce progenitors of embryonic globin genes π/
ζ, and adult αD and αA, all of which are present in birds
(for example, the chicken Gallus gallus) [9-11] and mammals [12,13]. The order and timing of these duplications
is still debated, as is their origin: for instance, αD may have
evolved by duplication either of adult αA (see [12]), or of
an embryonic α-like gene [14]. After the avian and mammalian lineages diverged, there were further tandem
duplications of the π/ζ and αA lineages to produce more
complex marsupial and eutherian ('placental') mamma-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/34

lian α-globin clusters, 5'-ζ-ψζ'-αD-ψα3-α2-α1-θ-3' (see
[12,15-18]). The timing of these duplication events is also
uncertain, because we do not know whether these seven
α-like globin genes all existed at the stem of the mammalian radiation.
As for many other gene families [19], comparisons of
globin genes between distantly related mammals have
provided unique insight into the evolution and function
of the mammalian globins. Marsupials diverged from
eutherian mammals about 148 million years ago (MYA),
and mammalian Subclass Theria that contains these
groups diverged from monotremes (Subclass Prototheria)
about 166 MYA [20], so comparisons between these
major mammal groups provide depth for evolutionary
comparisons. Monotremes retain many anatomical and
developmental features shared with birds and reptiles.
Their small genome, too, and disjunct chromosome size
classes are reminiscent of reptile genomes, and the 10 sex
chromosomes in a karyotype of 52 chromosomes is
unique among mammals [21-23]. Their importance for
comparative studies is now increasingly recognised after
the sequencing of the genome of a monotreme, Ornithorhynchus anatinus (platypus), to a depth of six to eight
times by the Washington University Genome Centre, St
Louis [24].
Indeed, studies of marsupial globins have clarified the
timing of some of the duplications. The finding of single
ε- (embryonic) and β-globin (adult) genes together in the
marsupial β-globin cluster indicated that a two-gene cluster (ε-β) was present in the common therian ancestor [2528]. Genes in the cluster were further duplicated to produce the ancestral eutherian β-globin cluster of 5'-ε-γ-η-δβ-3' (see [29-32]), which then underwent further tandem
duplication events. In contrast, the bird (G. gallus) β-like
globin genes (ε-βH-βA-ρ) show very little homology to the
mammalian β-like globin genes [33,34].
The discovery of a β-like globin gene (ω -globin) adjacent
(3') to the α-globin cluster in marsupials led to a re-interpretation of globin evolution in birds and mammals
[35,36]. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis
suggested that the ω-globin gene was more closely related
to bird β-like globin genes than to other mammalian βlike globin genes. The specific function of the ω-globin
gene is not yet known, but it is expressed just before birth
and in the early stages of pouch young development [37].
In addition, the ω-globin product binds to α-like globin
chains to form functional haemoglobin, so it is likely to
be involved in oxygen transportation [35-37].
This finding of a remnant β-like globin gene (ω -globin)
beside the α-globin cluster in marsupials [35,36] provided
some support for the alternative hypothesis [5] that the α-

and β-globin clusters in birds and mammals arose by in
trans duplication of a chromosomal region, rather than
simply by separation of the ancestral α-β globin cluster by
chromosome fission or translocation. Wheeler et al.
[35,36] proposed that before the divergence of birds and
mammals (>315 MYA), the chromosome region bearing
the ancestral α-β clusters duplicated to form two clusters
(α1-β1 and α2-β2) on different chromosomes, and their
contents diverged independently in mammals and birds
by silencing of some genes within each cluster (Figure 1).
To account for the apparent orthology of the marsupial ωglobin gene and bird β-like globin genes, Wheeler et al.
[35,36] suggested that the α1 and β2 were silenced in the
eutherian lineage, but β2 was retained in marsupials as
the ω-globin. In contrast, α2 and β1 were silenced in the
bird lineage (Figure 1). On this hypothesis, then, both the
α clusters and the β clusters of birds and mammals are
paralogous (that is, evolved independently from ancient
duplicates in an amniote ancestor) rather than orthologous (that is, diverged from the same ancestral cluster in
an amniote ancestor).

This paralogy hypothesis (which rests on the rather weak
orthology between the chicken β and marsupial ω), as
well as the dates and types of other duplications, could be
further tested by studying globin genes of monotreme
mammals, and using comparative data to infer the ancestral globin gene arrangement of a mammal ancestor 166
MYA. The availability of platypus genomic sequences now
provides an efficient way to discover all of the globin
genes and regulatory signals, and to understand their
function and evolution. Studies of globin genes in
monotremes are also interesting because the specialized
features and lifestyle of these unique mammals may have
given rise to special adaptations of globin genes to fulfil
unusual oxygen requirements. These features include the
need for oxygen by diffusion through the egg membrane
to the embryo after birth and the physiological response
to hypoxic conditions during hibernation, burrowing and
diving [38-40].
Little is known about monotreme α- and β-globin families. More than 30 years ago, studies of adult blood
revealed a single adult α and β globin protein in the plat-

Current proposed model for the evolution of α- and β-globin clusters from paralogous clusters in different lineages. The unlinked α- and β-globin clusters in birds and mammals evolved from an ancient in trans duplication of the ancestral
linked α-β cluster, followed by differential gene silencing (marked with X). This resulted in bird β-like globin genes (β2) orthologous to the marsupial ω-globin gene (β2 beside the α-globin cluster) but paralogous to mammalian β-like globin genes (β1).

ypus [41,42] and echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus [43,44]).
Lee et al. [28] later isolated an adult β-globin gene in the
echidna that encoded a polypeptide identical to the previously isolated echidna β-globin [44]. To date, there is no
evidence of any monotreme embryonic ζ- or ε-globin
genes.
We used platypus genomic sequences from bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to characterise the α- and βglobin gene families of the platypus and investigate their
molecular evolution. In particular, we searched for embryonic and ω-globin genes and any novel globin genes that
might fulfil the requirements for oxygen transport under
hypoxic conditions. We investigated the genome context
in order to infer the structure and origin of the ancestral αand β-globin clusters at the stem of the mammalian radiation. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that the
mammalian α- and β-globin clusters are orthologous to
the avian α- and β-globin clusters, respectively, and that
the β cluster evolved by transposition of a copy of the
beta-like ω-globin gene in an amniote ancestor.

Results

Identification of BAC clones containing the α- and β-globin
clusters
The draft sequence assembly of platypus [24] is readily
available on the University of California Santa Cruz
(UCSC) Genome Browser [45]. However, currently the
assembly is incomplete for the α- and β-globin clusters, as
individual globin genes appear on different contigs. There
are also sequences of the platypus BAC clones available in
NCBI GenBank that are not yet annotated and assembled,
nor is part of the platypus genome assembly. Two of these
are Oa_Bb-2L7 [GenBank:AC195438] and Oa_Bb131M24 [AC203513], which were identified from the
Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements Project to contain parts
of the α-globin cluster (see Methods). The BAC clone
Oa_Bb-484F22 [GenBank: AC192436] containing the βglobin cluster was obtained by screening a male platypus
BAC library (Clemson University Genomic Institute,
USA) and was subsequently fully sequenced and assembled by the Washington University Genome Sequencing
Centre (St Louis, USA). These sequences were therefore
used in this study to characterise the whole α- and βglobin clusters in the platypus.

Genes in these sequenced BAC clones were predicted by
programs GENSCAN [46] and GenomeScan [47]. Many
genes were predicted, which were then used for BLAST
searches of nucleotide (BlastN) and amino acid (BlastP)
databases to help identify them (data not shown). Phylogenetic analyses were also conducted for the platypus αand β-like globin genes to further verify the identity of
each gene (see below and also Figures 2, 3 and 4 below).
With only one exception (platypus ε-globin, see below),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/34

the identities of all of the genes inferred by BLAST analyses
were supported by phylogenetic analyses with high posterior probabilities and bootstrap support values.
Predictions and characterisation of genes in the platypus
α-globin cluster
One BAC (Oa_Bb-2L7) contained two embryonic α-like
globin genes, and a second BAC (Oa_Bb-131M24) contained six α-like globin genes and a β-like globin gene (see
Additional file 1). These two BACs were found to overlap
by 10,066 base pairs (bp), resulting in a contig of 330,126
bp that contained the entire platypus α-globin cluster and
flanking genes.

The 330,126 bp α-globin contig was found to contain six
α-like globin genes, a β-like globin gene, and a gene that
bore little similarity to α- and β-like globin genes but
some similarity to cytoglobins (Figure 5A). These six αlike globin genes have a three-exon/two-intron structure
and conserved donor/acceptor splice sites (GT/AG) typical of all vertebrate α-like globin genes. They are separated
from each other by 2 to 6 kilobase pairs (kb). Full details
of the exon/intron lengths, location of the putative polyA addition site (AATAAA) and the lengths of the coding
domains with the predicted encoded polypeptide for each
predicted gene are given in Table 1. Figure 5B shows the
predictions for some of the well-characterised proteinbinding sites in the 5' promoter region (about 200 bp 5'
to the cap site of each gene). These include CACCC [48],
CAAT [49], TATA [50], GATA 1 [51], EKLF (Erythroid
Krüppel-like Factor; [52]) and have been experimentally
shown to control the stage- and tissue-specific expression
of α- and β-like globin genes in other mammals [50,5355].
Two genes at the 5' end of the α-globin cluster were both
identified as ζ-like (referred to here as ζ and ζ') and predicted to encode polypeptides of 142 amino acids (aa),
which are typical of known functional mammalian α-like
globin genes. The amino acid sequence alignment of ζ
and ζ' shows 95% identity. In the promoter region of both
genes, CACCC and CAAT consensus boxes are conserved
at similar positions, and in comparable order to that of
human ζ and ζ' (Figure 5B).
Adjoining the two ζ-like globin genes, four other α-like
globin genes were identified. One was an orthologue of
bird and reptilian αD, and the other three were orthologues of adult α genes (here called α3, α2 and α1). The
long and uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF) of αD
strongly suggests that it encodes a functional polypeptide
of 141 aa, typical of known functional αD globin genes.
The platypus αD globin gene contains introns of 1450 bp
(intron 1) and 1610 bp (intron 2) that are very large com-

For each predicted gene, the length of the exons and introns, position of poly-A addition site (AATAAA) from the stop codon, and the length of
their putative coding domain (CDS) and encoded polypeptide are shown. All genes contained consensus splice sites (GT/AG) in both introns.

pared with those of other α-like globins, which are usually
less than 1000 bp.
Analyses of the platypus adult α-like globin genes reveal
three adult (α3, α2 and α1) globin genes in the α-globin
cluster. The sequence of α3 (the most 5' gene, adjacent to
αD) was found to be almost identical to α1 (the most 3'
gene) in their exon and intron regions, as well as in flanking regions of about 130 bp on both sides. The coding
region was 100% identical, and just two sites in intron 1
were found to be different between the two genes. In order
to confirm that identification of these two identical genes
was not due to an error in the assembly of the original
sequence data, the boundaries of the region containing
the homology between α1 and α3 was further analysed by
a BLAST search of the platypus whole-genome shotgun
(WGS) database (data not shown). Two contigs were
identified with homology to α1 and α3; these had identical
sequences on one side of the boundary but different
sequences on the other, confirming the presence of two
separate genes. Further confirmation was obtained by performing a Southern blot on the α-globin-containing
BACs, digested with an enzyme (EcoRV) that does not cut
within the α1, α2and α3 (data not shown). Probing with
α1/α3 revealed two bright bands, corresponding to α1 and
α3, and one fainter band between them, corresponding to
α2. Probing with α2 produced the same three bands, but in
this case the middle one was brighter, corresponding to
α2, and the outer bands were fainter, corresponding to α1
and α3. These analyses confirmed the existence of separate
genes α1 and α3 in the platypus α-globin cluster. The α2
gene, located between α1 and α3, was distinct from both
genes in the coding sequence (with 83% homology), in
intron lengths (intron 1: 405 bp in α1/α3 and 720 bp in
α2; intron 2: 151 bp in α1/α3 and 155 bp in α2) and in the
promoter region (Figure 5B).

The amino acid sequence encoded by α1 and α3 was identical to the platypus adult α-chain previously identified by
Whittaker and Thompson [41], implying that at least one
of these genes is expressed in the adult platypus. The coding domain of α1 and α3 is shorter (426 bp) than that of
α2 (429 bp), because it lacks the first three nucleotides of
exon 1. The ORF of α2 gives a strong indication that it is
translated into a functional polypeptide of 142 aa, typical
of known functional mammalian α-like globin genes.
On the 3' side of the six α-like globin genes, a β-like globin
gene was predicted, which was identified as the orthologue of the marsupial ω-globin gene. This platypus ωglobin gene has a typical three-exon/two-intron structure,
conserved donor/acceptor splice sites, and encodes a
polypeptide of 146 aa, typical of all vertebrate β-like
globin genes (Table 1). The promoter region located 5' of
the ω-globin initiation codon contains conserved sites for
CAAT-EKLF-CACCC in an order identical to that of marsupial ω-globin gene.
Unexpectedly, GenomeScan predicted a gene based on the
protein similarities with the α- and β-polypeptide chains,
approximately 1.5 kb 3' of the ω-globin gene. Like other
α- and β-globins, this gene also has a three-exon/twointron structure and conserved donor/acceptor splice sites
(Table 1). The lengths of its exons 1, 2, and 3 are 98, 223
and 144 bp, respectively, compared with 92, 223 and 129
bp in other β-like globin genes. However, it has much
larger introns of 3364 bp (intron 1) and 3053 bp (intron
2). The long and uninterrupted ORF of this gene can be
translated into a polypeptide of 154 aa, which is atypical
of any known α- or β-like globin genes. A BLAST search of
the amino acid sequence of this gene obtained the best hit
with Globin Y (gby) of the amphibian X. laevis (identity
score of 39%), and weaker identity scores with Cytoglobins (cygb) of other species, such as the fish Danio rerio
(27%), X. tropicalis (26%), chicken (28%) and human

(25%) at the protein level. We designated this gene 'GBY'
based on similarities with X. laevis gby, and its similar
position adjoining the globin cluster [2]. The predicted
polypeptide of platypus GBY (154 aa) was shorter than X.
laevis gby (156 aa), and quite different from X. laevis cygb
(179 aa), D. rerio cygb1 (174 aa) and cygb2 (179 aa), and
human CYGB (190 aa). Using the Expressed Sequence Tag
(EST) database, a BLAST search of the platypus GBY also
obtained an identity score of 38% with X. tropicalis gby
that was expressed in both tadpoles and adults, but produced no significant matches with any other mammalian
genes. The present work was the first opportunity to analyse the promoter region of any GBY gene (Figure 5B).
Predictions and characterisation of genes in the platypus
β-globin cluster
In the platypus, only two β-like globin genes were predicted within the 129,521 bp BAC clone (Oa_Bb-484F22)
by GENSCAN and GenomeScan (see Additional file 1).
When the predicted amino acid sequences were subjected
to BLAST search, the 5' gene had best hits with mammalian embryonic ε-globin genes. Although the phylogenetic
analyses using Bayesian inference (BI; see below) indicated that this gene was more closely related to the platypus and echidna adult β-globin genes than to therian εglobin genes, the position of this gene on the 5' end of the
β-globin cluster and expression data (see below) supports
its orthology with mammalian embryonic ε-globin genes,
and is henceforth referred to as ε. The 3' gene encoded a
protein identical to the previously identified platypus
adult β-chain [42], and is henceforth referred to as β.

Both genes encode polypeptides of 146 aa, typical of
known functional mammalian β-like globin genes. The
promoter region of the platypus β has conserved sites of
CACCC and CAAT in all three extant of mammals. However, the promoter region of the platypus ε appears to be
quite different from other mammalian ε-globin genes and
even from the platypus β (Figure 5B). The promoter of
platypus ε contains only one predicted motif (CAAT),
whereas the promoters of other mammalian ε, β and the
platypus β contain many predicted motifs.
Expression studies of the platypus α- and β-like globin
genes
Transcription studies were performed to gain insight into
the expression and function of all of the predicted platypus globin genes. Adult liver, kidney, spleen, testis, lung
and brain were obtained for this project: no embryonic
samples were available (or are ever likely to be available)
for this vulnerable and iconic species. Observation of the
expression of any of the predicted genes would constitute
a good indication that the gene is transcriptionally active
and functional.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/34

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
of all predicted platypus genes showed that they are all
expressed in at least some of these adult platypus tissues
(Figure 6). Platypus genes α1/α3, α2 and β, whose orthologues are usually expressed in the bone marrow of an
adult human, were expressed in almost all platypus tissues
tested, suggesting a broader expression of these genes in
the monotreme lineage. Surprisingly, the genes ζ, ζ' and ε,
whose therian orthologues are expressed only at embryonic stages of development, were expressed in adult
spleen and testis, but not in the other tissues of adult platypus. This suggests that persistent expression of these
genes in some adult tissues was selected for in the platypus, perhaps in response to its aquatic lifestyle and the
hypoxic conditions of a confined burrow. Also, the
expression pattern of platypus ε is similar to embryonic αlike ζ and ζ' but different from that of adult globin genes
(α1/α3, α2 and β). The ω and αD globin genes, whose functions are unknown, were also expressed mainly in the
spleen. GBY was expressed in all adult platypus tissues,
most strongly in testis.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses of the α-like globin genes using BI
and maximum parsimony (MP) produced several noteworthy results. The platypus adult α globin genes (α1/α3
and α2) grouped closely together to the exclusion of eutherian and marsupial α- and θ-globin genes for all analyses,
although posterior probability (69%) and bootstrap support (66%) for this arrangement were relatively weak (Figure 2). This finding suggests that the duplication leading
to the marsupial and eutherian θ-globin lineage occurred
after the divergence of the monotreme and therian lineages. This is consistent with the absence of a θ-globin gene
from the region between platypus α1- and ω-globin, its
expected location based on its position in marsupial αglobin clusters [12,56].

Both platypus ζ-globin genes grouped closely together
and formed a sister group relationship with chicken π,
supported by a high posterior probability of 97% (Figure
2). A sister group relationship was also found in MP trees
for analyses of the entire platypus coding region (bootstrap support <50%), and when third positions in the
codon were excluded, was supported by 73% bootstrap
pseudoreplicates (data not shown). This differs from the
expectation that platypus ζ-globin genes would group
with other mammalian ζ-globin genes to the exclusion of
chicken π, suggesting that other factors (for example, purifying selection) operated to maintain a similar sequence
in birds and monotremes.
There is still considerable uncertainty in the phylogenetic
position of the αD-globin clade. It has recently been proposed that the αD globin lineage resulted from duplica-

Expression
Expression of all predicted α- and β-like globin genes including GBY in an adult platypus. For each of the platypus
predicted genes, expression was investigated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in adult liver, kidney, spleen,
testis, brain and lung. Primers for each gene were designed between two exons so that it would result in a product distinguishable from genomic contamination of cDNA. The negative control (last lane) contained no cDNA. All genes were expressed in
one or more tissues, indicating that they are transcriptionally active and might be functional.

tion of the embryonic α-globin lineage, with phylogenetic
analyses supporting a sister lineage relationship of these
lineages to the exclusion of the adult α-globin lineage
[14]. However, this arrangement was not supported in BI
analyses of the data set used here, and the position of the
αD lineage was different in the different analyses. Analyses
using BI (Figure 2) supported the sister lineage relationship of the αD and adult α-globin lineages (as proposed by
Cooper et al. [12]), with 87% posterior probability support. In contrast, all MP analyses supported the sister lineage status of αD and embryonic α-globin genes,
indicating an uncertainty in the phylogenetic position of
the αD-globin clade.
Phylogenetic analyses of the β-globin genes provided
results similar to recently reported phylogenetic analyses
[35,36], with one notable exception. The BI analyses of
coding sequence data (Figure 3) provided strong support
(99% posterior probability) for the sister relationship of

bird and mammalian β-like globin genes, contradicting
previously published phylogenies of mammalian βglobin genes showing a sister relationship of marsupial ωglobin and bird β-like globin genes [35,36]. MP analyses
(Figure 4), excluding third position in the codon, gave a
similar tree arrangement, albeit with very low bootstrap
support (<50%). In marked contrast to the BI analyses of
DNA sequence data, BI protein analyses (data not shown)
supported the sister relationship of bird β-like globin and
mammal ω-globin lineages with a high posterior probability (99%).
Lastly, phylogenetic analyses using BI indicated that the
platypus ε gene was more closely related to the platypus
and echidna adult β-globin genes than to therian ε-globin
genes, suggesting it may not be orthologous to marsupial
and eutherian ε-globin (Figure 3). BI analyses of β-globin
protein data and MP analyses of the coding sequence data,
with third codon positions excluded, grouped the gene as

Loci flanking vertebrate α-globin (A) and β-globin (B) clusters. The relative locations of flanking loci (A) MPG,
C16orf35, LUC7L and GBY and (B) RRM1, CCKBR, ILK and ORG genes were searched for beside the α-β globin cluster in
zebrafish (Danio rerio) and frog (Xenopus tropicalis), and beside the separate α-globin and β-globin clusters in chicken (Gallus gallus), opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and human (Homo sapiens) from Ensembl [57]. The pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) flanking loci
shown here were adapted from Gillemans et al. [8]. For the platypus, the α-globin flanking loci were characterised in this study,
and ORG genes surrounding the platypus β-globin cluster were discovered: however, the BAC clone (484F22) was too small to
cover the region containing the loci RRM1, CCKBR and ILK. In X. tropicalis LUC7L was found on another scaffold (466 from
Ensembl) but sequence analyses by Fuchs et al. [2] suggested that LUC7L resides 3' to the frog α-β-GBY cluster. The flanking loci
as well as the α- and β-globin clusters are differentiated by colour.

Location of the α- and β-globin clusters in the platypus
The location of the verified BAC clones containing the α(Oa_Bb-2L7) and β-globin (Oa_Bb-484F22) clusters in
the platypus was determined by fluorescence in situ
hybridisation (FISH) (Figure 7). The β-globin cluster
localised to one of the largest autosomes, giving unambiguous signals on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q5.1).
The α-globin cluster localised to the smallest autosome,
21, whose two arms are not distinguishable by size or
DAPI banding pattern [21]. This is the first gene that has
been localised on the platypus chromosome 21.
Loci flanking the α- and β-globin clusters in the platypus
and other vertebrates
To explore the genome context of the α- and β-globin
clusters in the platypus and other vertebrates, the platypus
BAC sequences and the genomes of other sequenced species were searched for loci residing beside the α- and βglobin clusters.

As well as globin genes, GENSCAN predicted within the
platypus α-globin 330,126 bp contig many genes that
flank the platypus α-globin cluster (Figure 5A), which
were identified by BLAST analyses. These include IL9RP3POLR3K-C16orf33-C16orf8-MPG-C16orf35 upstream (5')
of the α-globin cluster, and, LUC7L-ITFG3-RGS11-ARHGDIG-PDIA2-AXIN1 downstream (3') of the α-globin
cluster (Figure 5A).
To compare the α-globin flanking loci of the platypus and
other vertebrates, the genes closest to the α-globin cluster,
MPG, C16orf35 and LUC7L were searched for in the
human, opossum (Monodelphis domestica), chicken, frog
(X. tropicalis) and zebrafish (D. rerio) genomes that were
accessible from Ensembl [57]. Figure 8A shows that the
locations of MPG, C16orf35 and LUC7L are conserved
adjacent to the α-globin cluster of birds and mammals,
and in the same position adjacent to the α-β cluster of
amphibians, and all but LUC7L were also present in fish.
These results are consistent with the previous analyses of
Flint et al. [58] and Hughes et al. [59]. Thus the flanking
loci analyses reveal that the genome context of the platypus α-globin cluster is the same as the α-globin clusters in
therian mammals and birds, and this is the same as for the
α-β cluster of fish and frogs.
GENSCAN also predicted numerous genes other than
globin genes in the platypus β-globin BAC (484F22).
These were identified by a BLAST search as members of
the olfactory receptor gene (ORG) family that are responsible for odour detection. Three conserved ORG members
were identified at the 5' end of the platypus β-globin cluster and one conserved ORG member at the 3' end (Figure
5A).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/34

To compare β-globin flanking loci, ORG genes, as well as
other genes that are closest to the β-globin cluster in other
species, RRM1, CCKBR and ILK were searched for in the
human, opossum, chicken and zebrafish genomes that
were accessible from Ensembl [57]. Data from frog (X.
tropicalis) was not useful since all of these loci lie on different contigs or scaffolds due to assembly problems. The
locations of multiple ORG genes, RRM1, CCKBR and ILK
were found to be conserved adjacent to β-globin cluster of
birds and mammals [60,61], but not for the α-β cluster of
fish and frogs, nor beside the second α-β cluster of
zebrafish and pufferfish (Figure 8B). Thus the genome
context of the platypus β-globin cluster is the same as in
therian mammals and birds, but this is different from the
α-β cluster of fish and frogs.

Discussion
The phylogenetic position of monotremes makes comparisons with platypus of special value for exploring the
organization, function and evolution of mammalian
genes and genomes. The availability of platypus genome
sequence data now makes many such studies possible,
and have been used here to characterise the platypus αand β-globin gene clusters and explore their evolutionary
history.
The platypus α-globin gene cluster
The platypus α-globin cluster contains at least eight genes
within more than 40 kb, including six α-like globin genes
(including the identical α1 and α3), one β-like globin gene
(ω-globin) and a gene belonging to another member of
the globin super-family (GBY) arranged in the order 5'-ζζ'-αD-α3-α2-α1-ω-GBY-3' (Figure 5A). The cluster maps to
chromosome 21, the smallest autosome in platypus. All
eight genes are likely to be functional since their expression was detected in tissues of an adult platypus.

The platypus α-globin cluster is almost identical to the
arrangement of α-like globin genes in the ancestral therian cluster reported by Cooper et al. [12]. The one exception is the absence of a θ-globin gene from the platypus
cluster. Phylogenetic analyses support the basal position
of the monotreme adult α-globin lineage relative to marsupial and eutherian α- and θ-globin lineages, implying
that the duplication of an adult α-globin to produce θglobin occurred in the therian lineage after its divergence
from the monotreme lineage (Figure 9B). However,
although the numbers and arrangements of genes is so
similar in platypus and therians, the presence of three
adult α-globin genes and two embryonic ζ-globin genes
in their common ancestor was not supported by phylogenetic analyses, which showed independent groupings of
the three adult and embryonic genes within each separate
mammalian lineage (Figure 2 and see Cooper et al. [12]).
This result can be interpreted literally as resulting from

Figure 9
Proposed model for the evolution of the α- and β-globin clusters in vertebrate lineages
Proposed model for the evolution of the α- and β-globin clusters in vertebrate lineages. (A) A region containing
MPG-C16orf35-α-β-GBY-LUC7L represented the ancient α-β globin cluster of jawed vertebrates (>450 MYA), which is seen in
the amphibian lineage. This region further duplicated and underwent some gene silencing in teleost fish. In an amniote ancestor
of reptiles, birds and mammals (>315 MYA), a copy of an ancestral β-globin gene from this region was inserted into a different
chromosome within a region replete with multiple copies of ORG genes. The original amniote β-globin gene survives as the ωglobin gene (β1) in the α-globin cluster of marsupials and monotremes, whereas the transposed β-globin gene (β2) duplicated
several times to form different clusters in the different lineages. (B) Tandem duplications of the ancestral amniote α-globin
gene produced a three-gene (π-αD-αA) cluster in the avian lineage. In the mammalian lineage, further duplications gave rise to a
six-gene (ζ-ζ'-αD-α3-α2-α1) cluster with ongoing gene conversion events homogenising the embryonic and adult genes. In
monotremes, the ancestral ω (β1) and GBY are retained. After the divergence of monotreme and therian mammals, there was
an additional duplication of α2 to form θ, giving rise to the seven-gene cluster (ζ-ζ'-αD-α3-α2-α1-θ) in marsupials and eutherians. Marsupials also retain the ancestral ω but may have lost GBY gene; eutherians retain no identifiable remnant of either
gene. Furthermore, the ancestral transposed β2-globin gene duplicated independently in birds and mammals. Before the mammalian radiation, we propose that the ancestral β2 gene duplicated to form a two-gene β-globin cluster (ε-β) as seen in
monotremes and marsupials, except that ongoing gene conversion events homogenised platypus ε to group with monotreme β
genes. After the divergence of marsupial and eutherian mammals, there were further tandem duplications of these two genes
to produce complex β-globin cluster (ε-γ-η-δ-β) in eutherians.

independent duplications in each mammalian lineage to
produce three adult and two embryonic genes in each.
However, this seems unlikely to explain the convergence
in gene number of the α-globin cluster in these distantly
related mammalian lineages. We suggest that a more parsimonious explanation is that the common ancestor of
monotremes and therians contained three adult α-globin
genes and two ζ-globin genes, which were homogenised
by ongoing gene conversion events, leading to the gene
tree that does not match the duplication history of the
individual genes. The close similarity of the platypus α3
and α1 loci suggests a very recent gene conversion event
that homogenised their sequences. Therefore, we propose
that the platypus α-globin cluster of eight genes (ζ-ζ'-αDα3-α2-α1-ω-GBY) represents the ancestral mammalian αglobin cluster arrangement (Figure 9B), in which all genes
were transcriptionally active.
Importantly, the platypus α-globin cluster contains a copy
of the β-like ω-globin gene, also found in the marsupial αglobin cluster, but absent in humans, supporting the
hypothesis that ω-globin was present in the common
ancestor of all mammals. Phylogenetic analyses also confirm the ancient ancestry of the ω-globin gene, as concluded by Wheeler et al. [35,36]. Among adult platypus
tissues this gene was expressed only in the spleen. In marsupials, expression of the ω-globin gene was detected just
prior to birth and during early pouch young development
[37], although the site of expression was not studied, and
there was no evidence of adult expression in blood cells.
Discovery of a mammalian GBY globin gene adjoining the
α-globin cluster
We discovered a globin gene GBY in the platypus that is
adjacent (3') to ω in the α-globin cluster. It has a typical
three-exon/two-intron structure like other α/β-globin
genes, contains an ORF encoding a polypeptide chain of
154 aa, and is expressed in almost all adult tissues, most
strongly in testis. The amino acid sequence is unrelated to
any of the other globin genes in the cluster, so it is
unlikely to be derived by duplication of α- or ω-globin
within the monotreme lineage. Rather, it shows sequence
similarity to gby of X. tropicalis and X. laevis, a gene thought
to be related to cytoglobins [2].

Little is known of the function of amphibian gby, or its
relationship with other globins. Fuchs et al. [2] reported
that amphibian gby encodes a bona fide globin of 156 aa,
having all of the sequence features of a functional respiratory protein. gby was expressed in all adult tissues tested in
X. laevis, most strongly in ovary, kidney and eye, and was
present in 20 expressed sequence tag clones from different
stages of X. laevis and X. tropicalis embryonic and adult
development [2], suggesting that it is expressed in embryonic as well as adult stages. Phylogenetic analysis of all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/34

vertebrate globins [2] showed that the gby lineage
diverged at the base of two separate clades, one comprising all vertebrate cytoglobins, myoglobins, agnathan
globins and bird globin E, and the other comprising the
haemoglobin α- and β-chains.
The position of platypus GBY adjacent to the α-globin
cluster and flanked by LUC7L mirrors its position in X.
tropicalis between the main α-β cluster and LUC7L [2].
Another common feature of both was strong expression in
gonads (ovary in X. laevis [2] and testis in platypus), so
GBY has sex-related expression in both lineages. Thus GBY
is not specific to amphibians, as was thought, but was a
component of the cluster in an ancient tetrapod, and has
been lost, or has diverged beyond recognition, in birds
and therian mammals.
The platypus β-globin gene cluster
Characterisation of the platypus β-globin cluster revealed
two β-like globin genes over about 13.2 kb that are
arranged in the same order as marsupials, 5'-ε-β-3' (Figure
5A). This cluster is located on platypus chromosome
2q5.1. Both genes appear to be transcriptionally active
and are likely to be functional.

At the time of revising this paper, an independent paper
on monotreme β-like globin genes was published by
Opazo et al. [62] in which they reported the presence of
ω, εP and βP in the platypus. Largely on the basis of phylogenetic analyses of flanking and coding sequence data,
they proposed that platypus εP and βP were not 1:1 orthologues of therian ε and β, respectively, and arose by independent duplication of an ancestral β-globin gene in the
monotreme lineage, with a separate duplication event,
just prior to the divergence of therians, producing the progenitors of ε and β of therians. This hypothesis was
strongly supported by our BI phylogenetic (Figure 3) analyses, but not by MP analyses of coding sequence data,
with third codon sites excluded (Figure 4), or BI analyses
of protein sequence data (not shown). These contradictory analyses highlight the difficulty in resolving deep
relationships among globin genes, particularly when the
time periods between duplication and speciation events
are relatively small, the phylogenetic signal at third codon
positions is potentially saturated, and non-synonymous
sites may be subjected to purifying or positive selection.
Despite a very high posterior probability (100%) for the
grouping of platypus ε with monotreme β, this value is a
Bayesian probability and depends on the model adequately representing the evolution of the gene. Furthermore, although it was reported [62] that the 5' flanking
sequences of platypus ε and β were similar, we found no
evidence for similarity of the promoter signals of these
two genes (Figure 5B).

Page 16 of 22

BMC Biology 2008, 6:34

We consider that a more parsimonious explanation is that
the platypus ε is orthologous to the marsupial and eutherian embryonic β-like globin lineages (ε and γ), and arose
by duplication of an ancestral β-globin gene prior to the
mammalian radiation (166 MYA; Figure 9B). The
sequence of platypus ε may have been homogenised by
some gene conversion events, leading it to group with
other monotreme adult β-like globin genes. In addition to
the MP analyses reported above, this explanation is further supported by the conserved position of ε to the 5' side
of the adult β-globin gene in the platypus cluster, which is
similar to that found in other therian β-globin gene clusters [26]; see also [29]). Amino acid sequence analyses
(BlastP) also provided additional support for the orthology of platypus ε to other mammalian ε-globin genes.
Although we were unable to examine the expression of the
genes in embryonic tissues, it was found that the expression profile of the platypus ε was similar to the embryonic
α-like globins ζ and ζ' of the platypus, but not to the adult
β-globin gene, supporting its potential role as an embryonic β-like globin gene.
The ω-globin gene and the evolution of the β-globin cluster
The discovery of the marsupial ω-globin gene in the αglobin cluster [35,36] was critical in re-interpreting the
relationships of the α- and β-globin clusters in amniotes
(reptiles, birds and mammals) to favour the hypothesis
that these clusters in birds and mammals are paralogous,
having diverged independently from different ancestral
copies of the vertebrate α-β-globin locus [63].

Our observation of an ω-globin gene in the α-globin cluster in the platypus, as well as in the marsupials, confirms
that the ancestral mammal α-globin cluster contained a βlike globin gene that was lost in eutherians, as proposed
by Wheeler et al. [35,36]. However, the position of
monotreme and marsupial ω in the phylogeny (Figure 3)
is more consistent with the original hypothesis [5] that
mammal and bird β-globin are orthologous, having
descended from the same β-globin progenitor in an amniote ancestor, and this is strongly supported by flanking
sequence data (see below). Our data support the proposition that the ω -globin gene represents an ancient β-like
globin gene lineage that is ancestral to a group containing
both mammalian and bird β-globins with a high posterior
probability (99%). This arrangement, however, was not
supported by analyses of amino acid sequence data, indicating that there is uncertainty in the phylogenetic position of ω-globin relative to bird β-globins, or that
convergent evolution of bird β-globin genes and ω-globin
resulted in their similarity at the protein level. To further
resolve the key question of whether bird and mammal βglobin gene clusters are orthologous we carried out comparative analyses of flanking loci of the α- and β-globin
clusters.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/34

Genome context of vertebrate α- and β-globin clusters
We found that the platypus α-globin cluster is flanked by
MPG, C16orf35, GBY and LUC7L, and that the same genes
(except GBY) flank the α-globin cluster in mammals and
birds [58,59]. The same genes flank the α-β cluster of frog,
and even zebrafish and the α-cluster of pufferfish [8]
(except GBY and LUC7L), implying that a very ancient
region containing these genes (5'-MPG-C16orf35-α-βGBY-LUC7L-3'), or perhaps an even larger region, was
present in their common ancestor and has been conserved
since the evolution of jawed vertebrates more than 450
MYA.

In contrast, the amniote β-globin clusters reside in a very
different genome, sharing none of the flanking loci with
the mammal and bird α-globin clusters, or the α-β cluster
of frogs and fish. In platypus, as well as in therian mammals [60,61], the β-globin clusters are flanked by numerous ORG genes on both sides. In birds, also, the β-globin
cluster is embedded in ORG genes [60]. Even the outside
loci RRM1, CCKBR and ILK lie in the same orientation
with respect to the bird and mammalian β-globin clusters
[60], suggesting that the 5'-RRM1-ORG-β (cluster)-ORGCCKBR-ILK-3' arrangement has been conserved since
before the divergence of birds and mammals, more than
315 MYA. Therefore, the bird β-globin cluster is orthologous to the β-globin clusters of mammals.

Conclusion

New model for the evolution of α- and β-globin clusters in
amniotes
This analysis of flanking loci, in addition to the phylogenetic analyses reported above, refutes the prevailing
hypothesis that mammal and bird α- and β-globin clusters evolved from different (paralogous) copies of an
ancestral α-β-globin region containing MPG-C16orf35-α
(cluster)-β (cluster)-GBY-LUC7L. Rather, the context of βglobin clusters within olfactory receptor genes in birds as
well as mammals suggests that a copy of a β-globin locus
was moved into a region replete with ORG genes before
the divergence of birds and mammals 315 MYA. The precise mechanism for this translocation is unknown, but is
likely to be either by transposition of a tandem duplicate
of an ancestral β-globin gene, or retrotransposition of an
intron-containing primary transcript. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this ancestral β-globin gene within the αglobin cluster is represented by the platypus and marsupial ω-globin gene. The transposed β-globin gene then
independently duplicated several times within the avian
and mammalian lineages to form the different clusters of
differentially expressed β-globin genes. Full details of this
new model are given in Figure 9A and 9B.

This hypothesis could be further tested by investigating
the gene organization of the α- and β-globin clusters in

Page 17 of 22

reptiles such as lizards and snakes, which form a sister
group to birds. Our hypothesis predicts that reptiles
should possess a MPG-C16orf35-α (cluster)-β (cluster)GBY-LUC7L cluster, and an unlinked RRM1-ORG-β (cluster)-ORG-CCBKR-ILK cluster like birds and mammals.
The full genome sequence of the first reptilian species,Anolis carolinensis, will provide an opportunity to test
this hypothesis.

Methods
Isolation and purification of probes to screen for platypus
β-globins
At the start of this project there were no trace sequences
available for any globin genes in the platypus trace
archive. We therefore designed probes to screen the platypus male Oa_Bb BAC library (Clemson University
Genomic Institute, USA). The platypus β-globin-specific
primers OaBGF (5'-tggacccagaggttctttgac-3') and OaBGR
(5'-tgcaattcactcagcttggag-3') were designed from the reference tammar β-globin sequence [GenBank: AY450928]
using Primer3 [64]. Amplification by PCR was performed
in a final volume of 25 μl, with 40 ng genomic DNA, 1×
Buffer (Roche, Australia), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.05 U Taq
(Roche, Australia) and 1 μM each of forward and reverse
primers. PCR cycling conditions were: 94°C for 2 minutes, then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 50 to 60°C for
30 seconds, 72°C for 1 minute, followed by 72°C for 10
minutes. The PCR products were sub-cloned according to
the TOPO TA cloning® Kit Protocol (Invitrogen, Australia)
and the resulting plasmids were purified according to the
centrifugation protocol of Wizard® Plus SV Minipreps
DNA Purification System (Promega, Australia). The purified plasmids were confirmed to contain PCR products of
a partial platypus β-globin gene (167 bp) by sequencing
at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF, Brisbane, Australia) using M13 forward (5'-gtaaaacgacggccag3') and M13 reverse (5'-caggaaacagctatgac-3') primers.
Once confirmed, they were used as probes to screen the
platypus BAC library.
Screening the platypus BAC library for β-like globin genes
The platypus BAC library filters were pre-hybridised at
65°C with Church Buffer (1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M phosphate
buffer, 7% (w/v) SDS) including 1% BSA for 4 hours. The
platypus β-globin probes (25 ng) were labelled with 32PdATP using the Megaprime DNA labelling System (GE
Healthcare, Australia) following the manufacturer's
instructions. The probes were allowed to hybridise to the
filters at stringent conditions (65°C with the above
buffer) for 24 hours and then washed twice for 15 minutes
each in 2 × SSC/0.1%SDS and 1 × SSC/0.1%SDS. Autoradiography was carried out for 14 days at -80°C with an
intensifying cassette.

Identification of platypus BAC clones containing α-like
globin genes
Unlike β, BACs were not screened for α-like globin genes.
Instead they were identified directly from the Encyclopaedia Of DNA Elements Project [65], in which the α-globin
cluster is one of the targeted regions [12,66]. Two platypus
BAC clones (Oa_Bb-2L7 and Oa_Bb-131M24), which
were sequenced but not yet annotated, were identified by
computational analysis (below) to contain parts of the αglobin cluster and a ω-globin gene.
Isolation and purification of DNA from BAC clones
DNA from the identified BAC clones (including those that
were screened) was extracted using Wizard® Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega, Australia). The
purified BAC clones were then subjected to Dot or Southern Blot to confirm the presence of α- or β-globin genes
respectively.
Confirmation of BACs containing globin genes
Dot blot methods were used to verify the presence of the
α-like globin genes. In a plate containing Luria broth agar
with chloramphenicol, a Hybond N+ (GE Healthcare, Australia) filter was placed and multiple 1 μl of liquid culture
BAC clones were spotted onto the filter. The plate was
incubated at 37°C overnight and then the filter was
soaked in Denaturation Solution (0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M
NaCl) for 5 minutes, followed by soaking twice in Neutralisation Solution (0.5 M Tris-Cl pH 7.4 and 1.5 M
NaOH) for 5 minutes each. The filter was then rinsed in 2
× SSC, soaked in 0.4 M NaOH for 20 minutes and washed
with 6 × SSC to remove all cellular debris. The filters were
then screened with the platypus α-globin probes using the
standard library screening procedure (above).

Southern blotting was used to verify the presence of the βlike globin genes. In a 40 μl reaction, 20 to 40 ng BAC
DNA was digested with 10 U of restriction enzyme,HIND
III (Roche, Australia). The reaction was incubated at 37°C
for at least 4 hours and separated by electrophoresis on a
0.8% agarose gel overnight at 40 V. The DNA fragments
were transferred onto a Hybond N+ (GE Healthcare, Australia) nylon filter overnight by capillary action following
the manufacturer's instructions, and cross-linked in 0.4 M
NaOH for 20 minutes. These filters were then screened
with the platypus β-globin probes using the standard
library screening procedure (above).
Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)
Male platypus metaphase spreads were prepared and in
situ mapping was performed using two-colour FISH as
described previously by McMillan et al. [21]. The verified
BACs containing the α-like globin genes (ζ and ζ': Oa_Bb2L7) and β-like globin genes (ε and β: Oa_Bb-484F22)
were labelled with different fluorochromes and then

BMC Biology 2008, 6:34

hybridised to the chromosomes. The signals were detected
by fluorescent microscopy, where at least twenty metaphase images were captured and analysed.
Sequence data of the platypus BAC clones containing the
α- and β-globin clusters
Information about the platypus BAC clones containing
the α-like globin genes along with the ω-globin gene was
obtained directly from the ENCODE Project [66]. Their
sequence information was obtained from GenBank; accession numbers: AC195438 (Oa_Bb-2L7) and AC203513
(Oa_Bb-131M24).

The BAC clone containing the β-like globin genes that
were found from the library screening procedure were
sequenced at the Washington University Genome
Sequencing Centre (St Louis, USA). The sequence information for this BAC clone was obtained from GenBank:
AC192436 (Oa_Bb-484F22).
Computational characterisation of the α- and β-globin
clusters in the platypus
Using sequence information of AC195438, AC203513
and AC192436, genes were predicted by GENSCAN [46]
and GenomeScan [47] using default settings. All predicted
gene sequences were then subjected to a BLAST search of
the translated nucleotide acid (BlastX) and protein
(BlastP) databases to confirm their identities.
Promoter analyses
Transcription factor binding motifs were predicted in the
200 bp promoter region located 5' to the predicted platypus α- and β-like genes and GBY by rVista 2.0 [67] using
user-defined consensus sequences for 'CACCC', 'CAAT',
'TATA', GATA1 ('WGATAR' [51]) and EKLF ('NGNGTGGGN' [51]). The same criteria were used to predict the
same motifs in marsupials (Didelphis virginiana [ζ and ψζ':
AC139599] and Sminthopsis macroura [αD, ψα3, α2, α1, ω:
AC146781; and ε, β: AC148754]) and in humancs [ζ, ψζ',
αD, ψα3, α2, α1: NG_000006; and ε, β: NG_000007] for
consistency in comparison.
Confirmation of α1 and α3 by BLAST search and Southern
blot
To confirm that the presence of two almost identical genes
(α1 and α3) was real rather than an assembly error, the
boundaries (~300 bp) of the homologous regions were
investigated by a BLAST search against the platypus WGS
database. The raw sequences of best hits were extracted
from NCBI GenBank, cleaned and aligned in Sequencher
v4.8 (Gene Codes Corporation, Michigan) using default
settings.

Southern blotting was also used to verify the presence of
α1 and α3 genes. In a 30 μl reaction, 100 μg BAC DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/34

(Oa_Bb: 131M24, 130N2, 150K14 and 223I12) was
digested with 10 U of restriction enzyme,EcoRV (Roche,
Australia). The reaction was incubated at 37°C for at least
4 hours and separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel overnight at 40 V. The DNA fragments were transferred onto a Hybond N+ (GE Healthcare, Australia) nylon
filter overnight by capillary action following the manufacturer's instructions, and cross-linked in 0.4 M NaOH for
20 minutes. These filters were then screened with the platypus α1/α3 (test) and α2 (control) probes using the standard library screening procedure (above).
RT-PCR analyses
To remove DNA contamination, RNAs derived from adult
male platypus liver, kidney, spleen, testis, brain and lungs
were DNase treated using a DNA-free™ kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Australia). Treated RNAs were then reverse transcribed using
Superscript III (Invitrogen, Australia) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were designed against
predicted α- and β- like and GBY globin gene sequences
using Primer3 [64]. In each case, the region amplified
spanned an intron so that the origin of the template
(gDNA or cDNA) was immediately obvious. Primer
sequences and the expected sizes of amplified cDNA and
gDNA bands are shown in Table 2. PCR reactions and
cycling conditions were the same as for screening for the
platypus β-globin genes, above. The positive bands were
directly sequenced by AGRF (Brisbane, Australia) to confirm their identities. The blood contamination in the
tested samples had minimal effect on the observed expression pattern, as some tissues (for example, lung and liver)
showed no amplification despite containing large quantities of blood.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were employed to verify the identities of the platypus globin genes and study the evolutionary relationships of the different members of the α- and βglobin gene families. This study was restricted to the coding domains of the α- and β-globin members and the
accession numbers of the sequences used are given in the
legends of Figures 2 and 3. Phylogenetic analyses were
conducted using MP in PAUP* v.4.0b10 [68], and a BI
approach using MrBayes v.3.1.2 [69]. Concordance of
trees from each of the different methods, bootstrap proportions and posterior probability estimates were used to
examine the robustness of nodes.

MP analyses were conducted for the entire coding
sequence matrix and after excluding third codon positions
using a heuristic search option and default options (TBR
branch swapping), with the exception of using random
stepwise addition repeated 100 times. Character state
optimisation for MP trees used the DELTRAN option. MP

bootstrap analyses [70] were carried out using 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates, employing a heuristic search
option with random stepwise addition.
The program MODELTEST [71] and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) were used to assess the most appropriate model for BI analyses. The MODELTEST analyses were
facilitated using the program MrMTgui v1.0 [72]. The
MODELTEST analysis was carried out on separate codon
positions for α- and β-globin data sets. For α-globin
sequences, a general time reversible (GTR) model [73],
with a proportion of invariant sites (I) and unequal rates
among sites [74], modelled with a gamma distribution
(G) was found to be the most appropriate model to use
for first and second codon positions, and a GTR+G model
was appropriate for third codon positions under the AIC.
For β-globin sequences a GTR+I+G model was considered
appropriate for first positions, and a GTR+G model was
found to be appropriate for second and third codon positions. The MrBayes analysis was carried out applying these
different models to each codon position using an
unlinked analysis, with default uninformative priors. Four
chains were run simultaneously for 2 million generations
in two independent runs, sampling trees every 100 generations. The program TRACER (version 1.3; [75]) was used
to assess tree and parameter convergence. For both the αglobin and β-globin analyses all effective sample sizes for
all parameters were >1297, indicating a sufficient sample
of the parameter space had been taken. A burn-in of 2000
trees (equivalent to 200,000 generations) was chosen for
each independent run of MrBayes, with a >50% posterior
probability consensus tree constructed from the remaining 36,002 trees (18,001 trees each run).
A BI analysis using MrBayes (version 3.1.2) was also carried out using protein sequence data from β-globin genes.
A mixed protein model was used, allowing the optimum
model of protein evolution to be assessed from a selection
of nine fixed-rate models. The optimum model was found
to be the Dayhoff model with a posterior probability of
1.0. The analyses were conducted using two million gen-

erations in two independent runs, sampling trees every
100 generations. A burn-in of 2,000 trees was used for
each run with a 50% consensus tree constructed from the
remaining 36,002 trees.
