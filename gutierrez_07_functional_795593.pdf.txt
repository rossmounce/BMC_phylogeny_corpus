Abstract
Background: Several members of the Methyl-Binding Domain protein family link DNA
methylation with chromatin remodeling complexes in vertebrates. Amongst the four classes of
MBD proteins, MBD2/3 is the most highly conserved and widespread in metazoans. We have
previously reported that an mbd2/3 like gene (mbd-2) is encoded in the genomes of the nematodes
Pristionchus pacificus, Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. RNAi knock-down of mbd-2
in the two Caenorhabditis species results in varying percentages of lethality.
Results: Here, we report that a general feature of nematode MBD2/3 proteins seems to be the
lack of a bona fide methyl-binding domain. We isolated a null allele of mbd-2 in P. pacificus and show
that Ppa-mbd-2 mutants are viable, fertile and display a fully penetrant egg laying defect. This egg
laying defect is partially rescued by treatment with acetylcholine or nicotine suggesting a specific
function of this protein in vulval neurons. Using Yeast-two-hybrid screens, Ppa-MBD-2 was found
to associate with microtubule interacting and vesicle transfer proteins.
Conclusion: These results imply that MBD2/3 proteins in nematodes are more variable than their
relatives in insects and vertebrates both in structure and function. Moreover, nematode MBD2/3
proteins assume functions independent of DNA methylation ranging from the indispensable to the
non-essential.

Background
DNA methylation is a common regulatory mechanism
implicated in transcriptional silencing in vertebrates [1].
Methylated cytosines in DNA are recognized by a set of
proteins carrying a methyl-binding domain (MBD) [2,3].
These MBD proteins interpret the methylation signal by
recruiting components involved in transcriptional repression or heterochromatin formation [4,5].
In mammals, five members of the MBD family have been
identified [6]. MeCP2 forms part of the Sin3/HDAC com-

plex and, when mutated, causes a progressive neurological
disorder known as the Rett syndrome (RTT) [7,8]. MBD1
couples DNA methylation with histone H3-K9 methyltrasferase activity mediated by SETDB1 [2,9]. MBD2 and
MBD3 are core subunits of the Nucleosome Remodelling
and histone Deacetylation (NuRD) complex [5,10-12].
Interestingly, mammalian MBD3, in contrast to the
amphibian MBD3, is not able to bind methylated DNA
[6,13]. Finally, MBD4 is a DNA N-glycosidase implicated
in the repair of demethylated cytosines [14].

Outside the MBD, the five members of the family share no
similarity in their primary sequence, with the exception of
MBD2 and MBD3 [6,15-17]. Notably, invertebrates contain a smaller number of mbd-like genes. For example, in
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, only one gene with similarity to the
mammalian mbd2/mbd3 genes has been identified. In D.
melanogaster this gene is known as mbd-2/3, whereas in C.
elegans this gene is named mbd-2, given the nomenclature
rules of this organism [16,17]. In contrast, a recent report
of the genome of the honeybee Apis melifera describes the
presence of both mbd-2/3 and mbd-1 homologues [18].

penetrant defect in the egg laying system (egg laying defective, Egl). The Egl defect is partially rescued by treatment
with acetylcholine or nicotine, suggesting that Ppa-MBD2 functions in the neuronal innervations at the vulva muscles. A molecular approach using Yeast two hybrid (Y2H)
analyses reveals interaction with diverse cellular proteins
but fails to show interaction of any of the tested members
of the NuRD complex. On the basis of these results, we
propose that the absence of the MBD and the functional
diversification of the MBD2/3 proteins represent a derived
character in nematodes.

Results and discussion
In D. melanogaster, the mbd2/3 gene is alternatively spliced
to produce two isoforms. The long isoform is expressed
early in development and is able to bind specifically to
CpT/A methylated DNA, in contrast to vertebrate MBD
proteins which bind methylated CpG [19]. The short isoform, which is expressed in late embryogenesis, lacks part
of the MBD and therefore is unable to bind methylated
DNA [3,20]. A null allele of the gene mbd2/3 is viable and
fertile but the stability of pericentric heterochromatin is
considerably affected [19].
In contrast to D. melanogaster, no obvious DNA methylation system has been found in C. elegans and other tested
nematodes [16]. The unique MBD2/3 protein, Cel-MBD2, is characterized by the complete absence of a bona fide
MBD. Knock down analysis using RNA interference
(RNAi) showed variable phenotypes with different
degrees of penetrance, such as paralysis and death due to
rupture through the vulva [16]. In contrast, RNAi of the
homologous gene in C. briggsae reveals an essential function since the worms arrest early in development [16].
Previously, we initiated the analysis of genes related to
DNA methylation in another nematode, the diplogasterid
Pristionchus pacificus [16]. P. pacificus has been used as a
satellite organism to study the evolution of developmental processes and developmental mechanisms (for review
see [21]). We showed that the P. pacificus genome encodes
an mbd-2 gene. However, as in C. elegans, Ppa-MBD-2 also
lacks a recognizable MBD implying a function independent of DNA methylation. Remarkably, the genome of P.
pacificus also encodes a homolog of the D. melanogaster
DNA methyltransferase 2, dnmt-2, [16], but this protein
has been shown to function in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells as a tRNA methyltransferase [22,23].
Here, we report the presence of mbd-2 genes in nematodes
from different evolutionary clades. All encoded proteins
have in common the absence of a MBD. In order to extend
the functional analysis of mbd-2-like genes, we isolated a
deletion mutant in P. pacificus. Ppa-mbd-2 (tu365) mutant
animals are viable and fertile, but display a completely

Nematode genomes contain mbd-2-like genes
The only member of the MBD family found in C. elegans,
C. briggsae and P. pacificus belongs to the MBD2/3 group
[16]. A key determinant of the MBD-2 proteins in these
nematodes is the absence of a Methyl-Binding Domain
(Fig. 1A,B; SFig. 1, Additional file 1). To extend this observation to nematodes from different clades [24], we performed an extensive search of cDNAs in public genomic
databases. Complete cDNA sequences were obtained for
the filarial parasite Brugia malayi (clade III) and the rhabditid Haemonchus contortus (clade V). Partial 5' cDNA
sequences were obtained for the spirurid Onchocerca volvulus (clade III), the tylenchid Meloidogyne hapla (clade IVa)
and the rhabditid Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (clade V).
Sequence comparison of the aminoterminal regions of the
predicted MBD-2 proteins identified in different databases reveals a clear absence of an MBD (Fig. 1C). In addition, the highly conserved sequence motif SIFPQ, which is
characteristic of the MBD2/3 group from vertebrates to
nematodes, has changed substantially in the Caenorhabditis lineage and in M. hapla (Fig. 1C). We conclude that
MBD-2 proteins are present in all studied nematodes, but
that they lack a canonical methyl-binding domain.
A Ppa-mbd-2 deletion mutant is viable and egg laying
defective
The DNA methylation system encoded by members of the
DNA methyl transferase family is essential in mammals,
but is dispensable in lower vertebrates and invertebrates
[22,25]. In particular, no dnmt-like genes are found in the
genomes of C. elegans and C. briggsae. Because MBD proteins interpret methylation signals in insects and vertebrates, we hypothesized that the absence of an active
DNMT protein and the unusual structure of the MBD protein in Caenorhabditis correlates with a functional diversification. Our observations, together with the fact that no
DNA methylation system has been observed in any studied nematode, indicate that MBD-2 in nematodes evolved
functions independent of this modification.

To analyze the function of MBD-2 in nematodes other
than Caenorhabditis, we used the satellite organism P.

pacificus. This nematode is amenable to cellular and
genetic studies and the genome is almost completely
sequenced [21]. We applied a reverse genetics approach in
P. pacificus to obtain a deletion mutant of the Ppa-mbd-2
gene using TMP/UV mutagenesis. We screened approximately 840,000 gametes and found one allele, tu365. This
allele is likely to represent a null allele because four of the
six exons are removed (ca. 1.7 Kb) and exon 1 is joined to
exon 6 resulting in a frame-shift (Fig. 2A–C; SFig. 2, Additional file 1).

The Ppa-mbd-2(tu365) mutant is recessive, homozygous
viable and displays a fully penetrant Egl phenotype (Fig.
2D). Development proceeds normally until adulthood
and gravid animals can lay an average of 40 eggs before
eggs start to be retained by the mother. Eventually, egg
retention and hatching inside the mother generate a "bag
of worms" phenotype (Fig. 2D and Table 1). No paralyticuncoordinated or rupture phenotype is seen in Ppa-mbd2(tu365) mutants, as is the case in Cel-mbd-2(RNAi)
treated animals.

* Worms were synchronized by bleaching. Individual J2 were
allowed to grow on normal NGM plates. The eggs laid by each
worm were counted every 12 hours for a period of 48 hours. At
each time point, every individual worm was transferred to a new
plate. At 48 hours all the tu365 animals become egl. In both cases, 50
animals per strain were analyzed.

On the basis of these results, we argue that the function of
MBD-2 in nematodes has changed from an essential to a
dispensable gene. This argument is based on the observation that RNAi knock down of mbd-2 genes in the
Caenorhabditis lineage produced lethality, whereas the P.
pacificus null mutant is viable and fertile. It is important to
note that mbd-2 genes are present in single copy in the
genomes of C. elegans, C. briggsae and P. pacificus, as determined by Southern blot analysis (SFig. 3, Additional file
1). Moreover, the location and structure of the mbd-2 gene
differs in these nematodes. For example, in C. elegans and
C. briggsae, the mbd-2 gene is located in an intron of the
glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor synthesis protein,

C27A12.9, and is trans-spliced to the splice leader 1 (SL1).
In P. pacificus in contrast, mbd-2 is the second gene of an
operon and is trans-spliced to SL2, a key determinant of
genes in operons (Fig. 2A) [26,27]. This difference suggests the potential for changes in the transcriptional regulation of the mbd-2 genes in these species and might
represent a source for the acquisition of novel functions.
Ppa-MBD-2 functions in the egg laying system
In P. pacificus, as in C. elegans, an Egl phenotype can be
caused by many developmental or physiological defects.
For example, misspecification of the vulva, the gonad, the
sex musculature and several neurons innervating these
muscles can result in an Egl phenotype. DIC-microscopy
analysis of Ppa-mbd-2(tu365) mutant worms show that
vulval cell fate specification is normal (Fig. 3A, B). Also,
phalloidin staining, which stain actin fibers, revealed that
the sex muscles are also present and correctly shaped (Fig.
3C, D). Therefore, the Ppa-mbd-2 Egl phenotype might
result from defects in a neuronal function. As tu365 animals can initially lay eggs, we assumed that the neuronal
system working on the egg-laying apparatus is formed
properly and originally functional. Later on, neurodegeneration or failure in signal transmission might result in the
Egl phenotype.

In C. elegans, the hermaphrodite specific neuron (HSN)
and the ventral nerve cord neurons control the egg-laying
program through the secretion of serotonin, acetylcholine
and at least four neuropeptides [28]. Incubation of C. elegans with serotonin or nicotine stimulates egg laying
[29,30]. In contrast, treatment with acetylcholine has
opposing stimulatory and inhibitory roles in egg laying by
acting through different types of receptors [31,32]. To test
if the Egl phenotype of Ppa-mbd-2(tu365) can be rescued
by neurotransmitters reported to work on the C. elegans
egg-laying system, we incubated wild type and Ppa-mbd2(tu365) mutant worms in M9 buffer containing different
kinds of neurotransmitters or their agonists. It is important to note that wild type P. pacificus PS312 animals, in
contrast to C. elegans, retain no more than two to four eggs
under normal cultural conditions. However, when worms
were starved for about 12 hours, they retained on average
six to eight eggs (environmental Egl). In our egg-laying
assay, P. pacificus PS312 animals laid an average of 3.5 to
4.5 eggs per animal independent of the presence or
absence of any of the tested neurotransmitters except for
serotonin (5-HT). 5-HT has a negative effect on egg laying
since wild-type induced environmental Egl animals
resulted in a reduction of egg laying to an average of 1.5
eggs per animal (Fig. 4). Synchronized Ppa-mbd-2(tu365)
mutant animals showed no or very low egg-laying in M9
and GABA. In contrast, treatment with acetylcholine and
its agonist nicotine induced a potent (six-fold) increase in
egg-laying in Ppa-mbd-2(tu365) (Fig 3). 5-HT treatment

also increased egg-laying, but not as efficiently as acetylcholine and nicotine (Fig. 4). These results suggest that
Ppa-mbd-2 may be implicated in cholinergic neurostimulation. More generally, these initial studies suggest a neuronal wiring that differs from the corresponding process
in C. elegans, although we cannot completely rule out that
the wiring is the same and that only the pharmacological
features of the cells are different in both species. A more
detailed study of the nervous system in P. pacificus will
clarify these observations further. Interestingly, in a comparative approach using different nematode species, Loer
and Rivard have shown recently that P. pacificus appear to
have lost a serotonin-immunoreactive HSN [33]. Therefore, these results do not exclude the possibility that the
neuronal function of MBD-2 is conserved in both species.
One might speculate that MBD-2 could be required in a
wider set of cell types in C. elegans.
Ppa-MBD-2 interacts with diverse cellular proteins
Given that nematode MBD-2 proteins function independent of DNA methylation, they should have coevolved specific interaction partners. To test this hypothesis, we
performed an unbiased Y2H screen using Ppa-MBD-2 as
prey and a cDNA library of P. pacificus as bait (~1 × 107
clones). The protein does not show any auto-activation
when present as both, bait and prey (Table 2). We found
several different in frame interactors, such as first, a SPOPlike protein which is part of E3-ubiquitin ligase [34]; second, a myosin heavy chain homolog to the C. elegans
T07C4.10 predicted protein; third, a Huntingtin interacting protein; fourth, a dynein ligh chain; fifth, a protein
similar to C. elegans tag-260 and two proteins with no
homology in the database (Table 2, SFig. 4, Additional file
1). The fact that mdb-2 interacts with microtubule associated proteins such as dynein-light chain is interesting

since the first gene of the operon in which Ppa-mbd-2 is
placed encodes mapmodulin, a microtubule binding protein involved in vesicles transport from endosomes to
trans-Golgi [35]. In this context it is important to note that
genes arranged in operons have been suggested to display
similar functions [26]. As some of these interactions may
be physiological irrelevant, a final interpretation awaits a
more detailed biochemical analysis.
Interestingly, components of the NuRD complex were not
found in the Y2H screening. However, sequencing of randomly chosen clones of the Y2H cDNA library revealed
the presence of many in-frame components of the NuRD
complex (data not shown). Therefore, we speculate that
Ppa-MBD-2 is not involved in transcriptional repression
or chromatin remodeling. Taken together, Y2H screens
found Ppa-MBD-2 to associate with microtubule interacting and vesicle transfer proteins

Conclusion
MBD proteins play a crucial role in DNA methylation and
show an enormous multiplication and functional diversification in vertebrates. In insects, the number of genes
encoding MBD proteins is smaller than in vertebrates. Our
studies presented here indicate that in nematodes, only
MBD2-like proteins are observed, which evolve rapidly at
the sequence level. They show functions independent of
DNA methylation, a phenomenon that is absent in C. elegans, C. briggsae and P. pacificus. With the limited functional data on MBD proteins from only three phyla
(vertebrates, insects and nematodes) it remains currently
unknown if the role of these proteins in DNA methylation
represents the ancestral or derived function of the proteins. Importantly, MBD3 like proteins with a bona fide
MBD are found in other lower metazoa such as in the
platyhelminth Schistosoma japonicum [6]. Therefore, we
speculate that the observed structure of the MBD in the

MBD-2 proteins in the nematode lineage represents a secondary loss of a protein domain and similarly, that the
functional diversification of nematode MBD2-like proteins represents a derived character. Thus, MBD-2 is an
example of a protein that evolves rapidly and acquires
new functions, including a role in epigenetics in higher
metazoans.

Methods
Nematode strains
In the present study we used the strain PS312 of Pristionchus pacificus (Pasadena, CA) [36]. Worms were grown on
an E. coli OP50 bacterial lawn at 20°C as previously
described [36-38].
Sequence analysis
Complete predicted MBD-2 protein sequences from the
filarial parasite Brugia malayi and the rhabditid Haemonchus contortus, used for phylogenetic analysis, were derived
from cDNA sequences obtained from the B. malayi database at the The Institute of Genome Research (TIGR) and
Nematode.net, respectively. For alignments, partial cDNA
sequences from Onchocerca volvulus, Meloidogyne hapla and
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis were detected by TBlastn using
the aminoacid sequence of Ppa-MBD-2 in the public available non-redundant database Nematode.net.
TMP/UV mutagenesis and deletion library screening
TMP/UV mutagenesis and deletion screening were performed as described in Pires-daSilva, 2005 [39]. In short,

synchronized P. pacificus larvae were washed off NGM
plates with M9 and were incubated at 20°C for 15 min in
a fresh solution of 30 μg/ml of Tri-methyl psoralen (TMP)
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Next, worms were UV irradiated for
50 seconds under an intensity of 500 μW/cm2. Worms
were recovered in OP50-NGM plates at a density of 200
worms per plate. After bleaching, 1400 plates with
approximately 300 J2 stage larvae of the F1 generation
were generated, resulting in a total of 840.000 gametes.
After hatching of the F2 generation, 800 μl of distilled
water was added and 150 μl were used for lysis. The
remaining was left on the plates. Plates were stored at
12°C. For the deletion screen, 150 μl of worms suspension was combined with 1 volume worm lysis buffer to a
final concentration of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA,
100 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% Tween 20 and 100 μg/
ml proteinase K. Lysis was done at 60°C for 4 hours and
inactivated at 95°C for 15 minutes. DNA from14 plates
were pooled in each well of a 96-well plate. Five microliters of DNA was used for PCR with the primers AG10332
CGCTTCTCACATGATCTTTGTC and AG10333 GGGTAGATTTGGAAGGTTGTTG. For the second PCR round, a 1/
20 dilution of the first round reaction was amplified using
the primers AG10334 AGAAAGAGTCCGAGGGAAACAC
and AG10335 GGAGGGAAATGGTTATACTACAAGG.
Positive candidates were retested at the single plate level.
Sib selection was done using rounds of 100, 50 and 10
worms per plate/96-well plate. Finally, homozygous
mutants were backcrossed six times to the PS312 strain.

Behavioral assay
To characterize egg-laying response to different drugs, synchronized PS312 or mutant worms were grown in OP50
at 20°C until adult stage. Before starting the assay, PS312
worms were transferred to a NGM plate without food and
incubated 12 hours at 20°C. Wild type and mutant Egl
animals (that is, animals that retain in the uterus more
eggs than normal) were placed individually in 100 μl of
M9 buffer containing either 5 mg/ml 5-hydroxytriptamine, 3 mg/ml γ-aminobutiric acid (GABA), 5 mg/
ml acetylcholine or 0.05% nicotine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
[29-32,40]. All assays were performed with at least 100
animals/strain/drug at 20°C and eggs layed per worm
were counted after 2 hours.

SFig. 1: C. elegans and P. pacificus MBD-2 proteins lack the methylbinding-domain. Protein alignment showing the MBD2 and MBD3 proteins from mouse (Mus musculus), the two isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster MBD2/3, P. pacificus and C. elegans MBD-2. Color codes
refer to the methyl-binding-domain (red), the MBD2/3 SIFPQ conserved
motif (blue), coiled-coil domain (yellow) and an E-rich patch (pink)
found only in MBD3. SFig. 2: Gene structure of the P. pacificus mbd2 (tu365) mutant. A Ppa-mbd-2 gene structure showing the exons
deleted in the allele tu365. Blue arrows show the location of the primers
used to obtain this mutant. B DNA sequence of the mbd-2 transcript in
the mutant tu365. Note that the splicing of exon 1 and 6 creates an outof-frame fusion ending after the residue 43. SL is the splice leader 2, typical of genes found inside operons. Primers AG10334 and AG10335 were
used to do the RT-PCR shown in figure 2C. The red arrow below the
sequence means the original starts and stop codons of the wild type gene.
SFig. 3: The genome of Pristionchus pacificus contains a single
mbd-2 gene. Genomic DNA was isolated from a mixed population of P.
pacificus 312 worms. DNA was digested with the enzymes SalI (S), PstI
(P), XhoI (X), ClaI (C), XbaI (B) and XhoI-PstI (XP) for 4 hours at
37°C. The reactions were run in a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to
Nylon membranes. The hybridization was done overnight using a radiolabeled (32P) cDNA probe, representing the first 200 bp of the mbd-2 gene,
in a solution containing 0,25 M Sodium phosphate, pH 7.2/7% SDS at
50°C. The membrane was washed two times at 50°C in a solution 20
mM sodium phosphate/5% SDS and exposed 12 hours to a Kodak BioMax
XAR film. Increasing exposure times did not show additional bands above
background. Molecular sizes are shown at the left of the southern. SFig.
4: Yeast-two hybrid plaque assay. Candidate colonies growing in a -LTH
+3AT plates were transferred to a nitrocellulose filters. Filters were assayed
for lacZ expression as in ref 41. The identity and number of clones belonging to a particular gene are described on the right panel.

Yeast-two-hybrid assay
The complete coding sequence corresponding to the gene
Ppa-mbd-2 was amplified by reverse transcription PCR
using the primers AG10576 ATGGCAAAAGCAGATGCTCTG and AG10577 CATCCAAAGTACTTCATAAC and
cloned in pCR8-GW-Topo (Invitrogen, USA). Prey plasmid was done using LR-clonase into destination vector
pDEST-32 BD clones (Invitrogen, USA,). Standard techniques were used to transform the plasmids into MaV203
yeast (Invitrogen, USA). Autoactivation test with this plasmid was negative. The prey pDEST-22 AD library of P.
pacificus cDNA was prepared from poly(A) RNA using the
Cloneminer kit following manufactures instructions (Invitrogen, USA,). Y2H screen was performed on SD plates
lacking Leucine, Triptophan, Histidine plus 50 mM
3AminoThiazole. In total, 1 × 107 transformants were
screened. Positive colonies were tested for LacZ staining,
as reported [41]. In addition, positive clones were retransformed and retested.
