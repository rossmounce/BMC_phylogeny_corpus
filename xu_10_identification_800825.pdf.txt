Abstract
Background: Clonorchis sinensis is a zoonotic parasite causing clonorchiasis-associated human disease such as
biliary calculi, cholecystitis, liver cirrhosis, and it is currently classified as carcinogenic to humans for
cholangiocarcinoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding, regulating small RNA molecules which are essential for
the complex life cycles of parasites and are involved in parasitic infections. To identify and characterize miRNAs
expressed in adult C. sinensis residing chronically in the biliary tract, we developed an integrative approach
combining deep sequencing and bioinformatic predictions with stem-loop real-time PCR analysis.
Results: Here we report the use of this approach to identify and clone 6 new and 62,512 conserved C. sinensis
miRNAs which belonged to 284 families. There was strong bias on families, family members and sequence
nucleotides in C. sinensis. Uracil was the dominant nucleotide, particularly at positions 1, 14 and 22, which were
located approximately at the beginning, middle and end of conserved miRNAs. There was no significant “seed
region” at the first and ninth positions which were commonly found in human, animals and plants. Categorization
of conserved miRNAs indicated that miRNAs of C. sinensis were still innovated and concentrated along three
branches of the phylogenetic tree leading to bilaterians, insects and coelomates. There were two miRNA strategies
in C. sinensis for its parasitic life: keeping a large category of miRNA families of different animals and keeping
stringent conserved seed regions with high active innovation in other places of miRNAs mainly in the middle and
the end, which were perfect for the parasite to perform its complex life style and for host changes.
Conclusions: The present study represented the first large scale characterization of C. sinensis miRNAs, which have
implications for understanding the complex biology of this zoonotic parasite, as well as miRNA studies of other
related species such as Opisthorchis viverrini and Opisthorchis felineus of human and animal health significance.

Background
Fish-borne clonorchiasis, caused by the oriental liver
fluke Clonorchis sinensis, is endemic in many Asian
countries and over 35 million people globally are
infected with C. sinensis, including an estimated 15 million in China [1]. The parasite has major socioeconomic
impacts in other parts of Asia as well. In Korea, infection in humans is one of the most prevalent [2]. While
in Vietnam, the prevalence reaches 79% in the Haiphong

and Hanoi area [3]. This infection is also becoming
increasingly common in non-endemic regions and in
developed countries due to growing international markets, improved transportation systems, and demographic
changes such as population movements [2,3]. Epidemiological data suggested that clonorchiasis has an increasing human-health impact resulted from the greater
consumption of raw, frozen, dried, or pickled freshwater
fish imported from endemic areas [1,4].
Adult C. sinensis flukes reside chronically in the biliary
tract and cause periductal inflammation, fibrosis, pyogenic cholangitis, biliary calculi, cholecystitis, liver cirrhosis and pancreatitis [2,5]. Like Opistorchis viverrini,
C. sinensis is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the

International Agency for Research on Cancer for cholangiocarcinoma in 2009 [6]. The disease arises from
metaplastic changes of biliary epithelial cells and usually
occurs in the secondary intrahepatic bile duct, where
the fluke is preferentially situated. However, the exact
mechanisms of the carcinogenesis are not clearly elucidated [3,7].
The prevention and control strategies for this parasite
include fecal examination and treatment of individual
patients with praziquantel. The World Health Organization has also recommended mass chemotherapy in
humans in endemic areas as the most practical and
immediately effective control strategy [2]. Other efforts
to control the parasite include interrupting transmission
at the intermediate host level. However, there has been
little effect on the impact of snail populations (the first
intermediate host of the parasite) or on the practice of
eating raw fish [1].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18-22 nucleotide, noncoding, small RNA molecules found in diverse organisms from viruses [8], plants [9], flies [10] to mammals
[11,12], which regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They are essential for the complex life
cycle of pathogenic parasites for their ability to respond
to environmental and developmental signals and are
now considered as a key mechanism of gene regulation
[13]. The discovery of miRNA function sheds new light
on the control of these parasites. However, there was no
miRNAs being identified experimentally in C. sinensis.
In light of the probability that miRNA species are
involved in gene regulation in C. sinensis, here we investigated the expression profile of miRNAs and detected
potential novel miRNAs in C. sinensis adults. Due to the
similarity in morphology, life cycle and modes of transmission among members of the Opisthorchiidae [3],
miRNA profile research in C. sinensis will shed light on
the miRNA studies of other species such as O. felineus
and O. viverrini.

Results
Profile characteristics of short RNAs from C. sinensis

Deep sequencing yielded 14.8 million reads (Additional
file 1 for flowchart), and the raw sequencing data was
deposited in GEO of NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/ with accession number GSE22244. After 5’ and
3’ adaptors, contamination formed by adaptor-adaptor
ligation and low quality tags were removed, a total of
12.14 million reads with high quality were obtained.
Length distribution analysis showed that most reads
were distributed among 20-23 nt. The highest percentage was 18.73% with reads of 21 nt long, followed by
18.68% of 22 nt reads (Figure 1). In the next analysis
step, reads smaller than 18 nt (6.05%) were removed,
and a total of 11.19 million clean reads remained with

2.74 million (24.44%) unique sequences. Among the
11.19 million clean reads, a total of 2.18 million
(19.46%) were perfectly mapped to the Schistosoma
japonicum genome, including 30,558 (1.12%) unique
sequences; and 16.13% of these have only one location
on the genome.
Among the 11.19 million reads, 1,222,173 (10.92%) were
ncRNAs, including rRNA, tRNA, snRNA and snoRNA.
Repeat-associated small RNAs (1,909; 0.02%) coming
from high-repeat regions of genome or transposonregions were found to belong to the two types of repeat:
LINE/RTE:0 and LINE/RTE:1. The percentage of known
miRNAs was 18.71% with 2,093,879 reads which
includes 62,512 unique sequences (Additional file 2).
Except for the miRNA, rRNA and repeats mentioned
above, 7,875,451 (70.36%) sequences (2,610,289 unique
reads) had no match and were marked as un-annotated
(Table 1).
Identification of miRNA* and 6 novel miRNAs

A total of 17,535 un-annotated unique reads (out of
30,558 unique ones) that can match elements of the
S. japonicum genome were marked as potential novel
miRNA candidates. The secondary structure of the
inverted repeat predicted by Mfold and evaluated by
MirCheck showed that 6 conserved reads were found
(Additional files 3, 4). Many miRNAs were found in
multiple locations of the S. japonicum genome, for
example, a novel miRNA named cis-miR-001, corresponds to 14 different locations on different chains of
the genome (Additional file 5). Although we found the
homologs of known miRNA* of other organisms, we did
not obtain any miRNA* sequences of this 6 novel miRNAs in the C. sinensis data set. The sequences and locations of the 6 predicted novel reads are shown in Table
2 and the predicted stem-loop structures for their
miRNA precursors are shown in Figure 2.
Most miRNA* homologs had only one copy in the C.
sinensis dataset and the most abundant unique reads was
homologs of gga-miR-1627* with only 238 counts (Additional file 6). Although there were abundant miRNA*
sequences in Caenorhabditis elegans and other organisms
in Sanger miRBase [14] (Release 13), all these miRNA*
homologs belonged to different kinds of organisms
including vertebrates, insects, virus and some coelomates,
such as Amphimedon queenslandica, Schmidtea mediterranea, Locusta migratoria, Xenopus tropicalis, Mus musculus and Gallus gallus, with the exception of parasites
and nematodes including Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, C. elegans, C. briggsae and all kinds of mosquitoes
including Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti and Culex
quinquefasciatus, which were deposited in the database
(Additional file 6). It was reported that though the
miRNA: miRNA* duplex were complementary, their

base-pairing was imperfect and miRNA* was less stable
than the mature miRNA [15]. The phenomenon above
might indicate a fast degradation mature mechanism of
miRNA* in parasites, at least in C. sinensis.
The phylogenetic evolution of miRNAs

Some families included many members and showed distribution bias in the C. sinensis dataset. Totally, 284
conserved miRNAs families were found in C. sinensis
out of 2,093,879 reads (with 62,512 unique sequences).
These conserved families were presented in large category of vertebrates, insects and nematodes, and can be
sorted into 6 groups based on their phylogenetic distribution. Fifty conserved miRNA families are showed in
Figure 3a as examples. Four families were found to present among vertebrates, insects and nematodes, including let-7, miR-1, miR-34 and miR-124; Some families
were present in vertebrates and insects, but no nematodes; Some were restricted respectively to vertebrates,
insects, and invertebrates (insects and nematodes); while
some were nematode-specific. This phenomenon
showed that C. sinensis miRNAs were distributed widely,

some of which specifically belonged to other animals
and there might be a redundant miRNA expression in
C. siensis. It was reported that there were 50 conserved
families and 185 potential locust-specific miRNA
families in locust, and these families can only be divided
into 4 groups [15]. It was also reported that 16 miRNAs
belonged to 13 miRNA families in S. japonicum [16],
but no detailed information about miRNA families’ distribution was reported. Considering the complex parasitic life of C. sinensis and the key regulation function of
miRNAs, possessing miRNAs of different kinds of animals would be a perfect strategy for its parasitic life,
which could help them to adapt and modify the host
and parasitic environments quickly and conveniently.
On the other hand, for a large number and kinds of
miRNA expressed, nucleotides of miRNA* need to be
reused quickly, and this might be the reason why there
were so little miRNA* sequences found in this kind of
parasite. It is known that C. sinensis is parasitic in animal hosts such as snails, cats, dogs, fishes, mice and
human beings. However, due to the widely distribution
of its miRNA families, we believe that this parasite can
easily enlarge its host range when the parasitic situation
is convenient.
Categorization of conserved miRNAs indicated that
miRNAs of C. sinensis were still in the process of evolution. Some of the miRNAs belonged to ancient families,
such as miR-1 and miR-34; while some others appeared
to be much younger, such as C. sinensis specific miRNAs. The innovation was concentrated along three
branches of the phylogenetic tree leading to bilaterians,

insects and coelomates. Age differences indicated that
there was an ongoing process of miRNA evolution and
the birth and death of a kind of miRNA family was a
common phenomenon [15].
There might be two innovation approaches of miRNA
in C. sinensis, including evolution in the middle and tail.
We randomly elected 4 conserved families, miR-2, miR7, miR-133 and miR-87, and analyzed all of the members of each in miRBase. miR-7 and miR-133 belonged
to vertebrates, insects and nematodes, while miR-2 and
miR-87 were present in invertebrates only (Figure 3a). If
a miRNA family of C. sinensis had more than one of its
members, we chose the most abundant 2 or 3 ones, for
they were the main part of the family. Phylogenetic analysis of miR-2 family showed that the cis-miR-2 can be
easily found for its substitutions and insertions in the
middle of miRNA, just behind the “seed region” (Figure
3c); In contrast, the cis-miR-87 was conserved in the
middle, and mosquitoes (above red line) and some other
insects including B. mori and D. melanogaster innovated
at the position. However, it can be found that cis-miR87 evolved from the tail (Figure 3e). Different members
of the cis-miR family showed different innovation rate
indicated by phylogenetic trees (Figure 3b, d). The same
phenomenon can also be found in families of miR-7 and
miR-133 (Additional file 7). It was found that the seed
regions of all the species were conserved, while one
nucleotide right behind the seed region was changed
from U to G and another one was deleted in cis-miR-7
of miR-7 family. In miR-133, one nucleotide was changed from U to C in the middle which was the same as
sja-miR-133 (S. japonicum), and another one was changed from U to A which was the same as bma-miR-133
(B. malayi). We supposed that there might be a kind of
site-directed evolution and mutagenesis for parasitic life
in parasites, however, more miRNA information of
other kinds of parasites are needed, which are absent in
public databases at present.

Strong family member bias of miRNAs in C. sinensis

Almost one third of the reads belonged to miR-71
family with a total percentage of 33.24%, which included
miR-71 (26.79%), miR-71a (0.01%), miR-71b (0.03%) and
miR-71c (6.41%). It was followed by the family miR-2
with most of the reads focusing on miR-2b. This bias
phenomenon has also been found in other families, such
as miR-277 and miR-1. Except for miR-1 which was
common in different kinds of animals, miRNAs including miR-71, miR-2 and miR-277 all belonged to invertebrates (insects and nematodes).
Some families included more members than others.
let-7 was the second miRNA found in nematode C.
elegans in 2000 [17] and it was found that the let-7
family was the largest one among the conserved miRNAs of C. sinensis, including 15 members from let-7a
to let-7j and star sequences such as let-7b* and let-7g*.
The miR-1422 family was the second largest family
represented in the current dataset, which included 13
members. The reads in these families showed strong
bias. For example, 95.12% of the reads focused on let-7
in the let-7 family.
Expression predominance of some miRNAs in C. sinensis

Some kinds of miRNAs were expressed with high predominance. miR-71 had the most abundant reads accounting for 26.79% (597,871) of the total reads. It was
followed by miR-277b with a percentage of 7.97%
(98,845 reads). The third most abundant miRNA is
miR-71c with a percentage of 6.41% (Additional file 8).
The miRNA named lin-4, which was firstly found in the
nematode C. elegans in 1993 [18], was also found in C.
sinensis (with only 5 reads). Some other miRNAs were
not found in C. sinensis, including miR-40, miR-46,
miR-79, and miR-103.
There were 756 kinds of miRNA with copy numbers
(reads) fewer than 1,000, and 45 kinds of them with
only 1 copy. Seventy-eight kinds of miRNAs had reads

of between 1,000 and 10, 000, while there were only 30
kinds of miRNA with copy numbers between 10,000
and 100,000. When the copy numbers were higher
than 100,000, only 4 kinds of miRNA were represented
(miR-71, miR-277b, miR-71c and miR-215). This

expression predominance phenomenon was also found
in the 6 novel miRNAs. For example, there were
108 copies of cis-miR-006, while only 5 copies of cismiR-002 and cis-miR-019 were found, respectively
(Table 2).

Figure 4 Analysis of first nucleotide bias of miRNAs in Clonorchis sinensis.

Nucleotides bias of miRNAs in C. sinensis

The first nucleotide bias analysis of the 2,093,879 reads
revealed that nucleotide uracil (U) was the most frequently used first nucleotide in miRNAs of C. sinensis
(70.07% incidence), while G or C was seldom used as
the first nucleotide with only 10.31% and 3.32%, respectively (Figure 4). (A+U) was found most abundantly
with a percentage of 86.37% on average, reaching a percentage of 95.75% and 95.23% at the 22 and 23 nt positions, respectively (Figure 4).
Nucleotide bias analysis at each position showed that
A and U mainly appeared at the beginnings and the
ends of reads, while C and G occupied a very high percentage at the second position and the positions of
6-9th, which belonged to the “seed region” in other species [19,20]. Particularly at the beginning of seed region,
the G+C content reached as high as 80.06% (Additional
file 9). For a broad range of miRNA families which were
presented in C. sinensis (Figure 3a), the seed regions of
them might tend to be conserved. This speculation can
be proven by the phylogenetic analysis of the two
families of miR-2 and miR-87 (Figure 3). Although there
were innovations to the families of miR-2 and miR-87 in
C. sinensis, nucleotide change only happened in the
middle and the end. Considering the complex life history of the parasite, keeping steady seed region and flexible in other places of miRNA might be another strategy
for the parasite to adapt to different parasitic situations
in different tissues of different hosts.
The analysis showed that U had a high frequency in
the 1st, 14th and 22nd positions with percentages of
68.01%, 61.38% and 66.43% respectively, while it seldom

appeared at the 2nd and 24th positions with percentages
of 3.80% and 2.44%. (A+U) was distributed mainly in the
front of reads, at the first and 3-5th nucleotides (86.76%,
80.67%, 69.92%, and 79.84% respectively) but less at the
second position (19.94%). C had the lowest percentage
(1.73%) at 15th position. G showed high percentage incidence at the positions of almost every 3 nucleotides,
such as 6th, 12th and 18th with 69.54%, 50.77% and
58.61%, respectively, and it seldom appeared at the end
positions, such as the 22nd position (0.93%). The highest percentage of (G+C) was located at the second position with 80.06%, and it also predominated at the
positions of 6-9th and 16-18th. The phenomenon that
most A and U were distributed in the front of reads
with G and C being focused on the 6-18 positions
might be concerned with the mechanisms of miRNA
action, such as binding with the targets for gene
regulation.
Quantification of C. sinensis miRNA expression

Using the modified stem-loop RT-PCR, the relative
expression levels of the six novel miRNAs relative to the
actin gene were calculated (Additional file 10, Table 2,
expression level). Among them, cis-miR-019 showed a
high expression level while that of cis-miR-018 and
cis-miR-006 were very low.

Discussion
miRNAs are now considered as key regulators of gene
expression at the post-transcriptional level and perform
a variety of significant functions within cells such as regulation of growth, metabolism, development and cell

Xu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:521
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/521

differentiation [21-23]. Due to the complex life cycle of
parasites with several developmental stages in vertebrate
and invertebrate hosts, it is particularly important to
elucidate the roles of miRNAs in the growth and development of parasites and their abilities to regulate infection of mammalian hosts. miRNAs are involved not only
in the normal functioning of eukaryotic cells, but also
associated with dysregulation during disease. miRNAs
can be used as potential new tools for disease diagnostics and gene therapy [24] and a manually curated database (miR2Disease) is publicly available aiming at
documenting known relationships between miRNA dysregulation and human disease [25].
miRNAs in C. sinensis of zoonotic significance were
identified and characterized by deep sequencing in the
present study. We found that the percentage of reads
matching the S. japonicum genome was very low (19.46%)
and only 30,558 unique reads out of 2,735,479 were perfectly matched, whereas this figure can be as high as 70.5%
or higher in some other species [26]. The most likely reason for this phenomenon might be that the reference genome used for matching analysis was the S. japonicum
genome, rather than C. sinensis, for the C. sinensis genome
(or other species of Opisthorchiidae) was not available at
present. Although C. sinensis and S. japonicum belong to a
common phylogenetic group (Trematoda), there are some
significant differences between them, and some miRNAs
appeared to be species-specific [27].
The distinguishing characteristic of miRNAs from
other endogenous small RNAs is that miRNA precursors
have the inverted repeat sequence that can form hairpin
structures [28]. Six novel miRNAs were predicted from
17,535 un-annotated genome-matched unique reads. We
cannot exclude the possibility that there might be more
miRNA types in C. sinensis adults.
Amongst the conserved miRNAs of C. sinensis, bias was
found within both kinds of families and family members.
The miR-71 and its families possessed the highest proportion of total reads, and the miR-71 family was conserved
in S. mansoni, S. japonicum, Ixodes scapularis, and Anopheles gambiae being indexed by Sanger miRBase, which
indicated that miR-71 is essential for the life of this flatworm. Like miR-71, some miRNAs had particularly high
copies in C. sinensis, including miR-277b, miR-71c and
miR-215. Considering the living environment of the adult
parasites in the biliary tract of the hosts, as well as the normal function of miRNAs, we inferred that these families
might be mainly involved in metabolism of the worm.
Nucleotides A and U were distributed mainly in the
front of reads including the first and the 3-5th nucleotides with the exception of the second position (80.06%
of G+C). U was the dominant nucleotide in mature
miRNAs, especially in the first nucleotide position, and
it showed a high frequency in the 1st, 14th and 22nd

Page 8 of 10

position, almost at the beginning, the middle, and the
end of reads. It was reported by Zhang et al. (2009) that
the 1st, 9th and the terminal positions were enriched
with U and the 1st and 9th positions were the limits of
the “seed region” of a miRNA, which was responsible
for targeting mRNAs for gene regulation [20]. We
showed a similar result in C. sinensis miRNAs at the
first and the end positions, but there was only 20.13%
on average at the ninth position, while it was 50.66%
and 61.38% respectively at the 11th and the 14th positions. At the positions of 6-9th, G or C occupied a high
percentage. Because the previously analyzed miRNAs
were mainly derived from vertebrates including human,
rat, mouse and pig, and only a few parasites were
involved, we cannot exclude the possibility of speciesor even order-specific differences and there might be a
different or shifted “seed region” for miRNAs in C.
sinensis compared with other species [20].

Conclusions
The present study represented the first large scale characterization of C. sinensis miRNAs, which will help us
understand the complex life cycle of this zoonotic parasite, which in turn may have implications for the development of novel approaches for the effective control of this
parasite. These results will also assist the miRNA studies
of other related species such as Opisthorchis felineus and
O. viverrini of human and animal health significance.
Methods
Parasites

Adults of C. sinensis were collected from the bile ducts
of 8 wild cats obtained in the suburbs of Guangzhou,
China, with 20 worms in average from each cat. The
worms were immediately transferred to sterile physiological saline (37°C) in a sterile beaker, followed by washing five times with saline on a rotary shaker to remove
contamination from the hosts. Thereafter, the flukes
were transferred to Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) and incubated at 37°C with 10% CO2
for 3 h, allowing the flukes to regurgitate the gut contents until the flukes appeared pale and uniform. The
flukes were then transferred to RNase-free 1.5 ml screwtop cryotube containing RNAlater (Sigma) and kept at
4°C for overnight, followed by storage at -70°C.
The maintenance and care of animals used in this
study were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the relevant national and/or
local animal welfare bodies, and all animal work was
approved by the appropriate committee.
RNA preparation

Total RNA from flukes was prepared using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s

Xu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:521
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/521

protocol with some modifications. Briefly, at the step of
precipitation, 100% and 50% isopropanol were used to
gain a clear mix solution, followed by incubation for 1 h
at -70°C instead of 5 min at room temperature to
enhance the precipitation of low-molecular-weight
(LMW) RNAs. The purity and integrity of total RNA
were examined by standard agarose gel electrophoresis,
and the concentration was determined using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf). The purified total RNA was stored
at -70°C until use.
Small RNA isolation and high-throughput sequencing

The small RNA isolation was performed as described previously [29]. RNA fragments of 20-30 bases long were isolated and purified from 10 μg total RNA using a Novex
15% TBE-Urea gel. The 5’ and 3’ adaptors (Illumina) were
added to the ends of fragments. Reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR) was performed using a RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen).
The fragments were purified using a 6% TBE PAGE gel
and used for high-throughput sequencing with a Solexa
sequencer at Huada Genomics Institute Co. Ltd, China.
All the gels and kit for small RNA purification and amplification were bought from Invitrogen Co. Ltd.
Computational analysis

After masking of adaptor sequences and removal of
redundancy and reads smaller than 18 nt as well, the
cleans reads were screened against GenBank and Rfam
database (version 9.0) http://www.sanger.ac.uk/software/Rfam/mirna to remove non-coding RNA, such as
rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, and other ncRNA. The
sequences of candidate precursors were analyzed using
RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org to eliminate the repetitive sequences and then the left reads
were searched against the Sanger miRBase (version
13.0) to identify the conserved miRNAs. Based on the
nomenclature of miRNAs, reads showing high similarity to known miRNAs of other organisms (mismatches
≤ 2) were classified into the same miRNA family
[15,30]. The family distribution of conserved miRNA
and the nucleotide bias were gathered statistically to
analysis the expression and coding characters of miRNAs. Reads that cannot match any database above
were marked as unannotation. Cleans reads were then
mapped onto the genome of Schistosoma japonicum
http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/schistosoma/cn/genomeProject.
do using the program of Short Oligo nucleotide Analysis Package (SOAP) [31]. The perfectly matched unannotation reads were predicted with Mfold http://www.
bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold and then evaluated
by MirCheck. Thereafter, the precursors (hairpin) of
miRNAs were inspected manually in order to remove
false predictions. Predicted precursors that miRNAs
and miRNA* can be found in its both arms were

Page 9 of 10

deemed as high probability and stem-loop hairpins
were considered typical when the mature miRNAs present in one arm instead of loop of hairpin precursors
and with free energy hybridization lower than
-18 kcal/mol.
Analysis of novel miRNA expression

Stem-loop real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) with SYBR Green was used for
the analysis of novel miRNA expression in C. sinensis
adults. The stem-loop primers were used to quantify the
miRNA expression because it can provide more specificity and sensitivity than linear primers [32]. All of the
primers were synthesized by Shenggong Co, Ltd., China.
Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using an
ABI PRISM® 7300 Sequence Detection System and
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO) in a 20 μl
reaction. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. The
PCR mix included 5 μl cDNA for each miRNA (in 1:20
dilution), 5 μM forward and reverse primers, respectively, 10 μl 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. The C.
sinensis actin gene (EU109284) was used as the endogenous control. The primer pairs were as follows: forward 5’-ATGGGTGATGAGGACGTTGCAGCT-3’ and
reverse 5’-CATGATCGAGTTGTA CG TCGTCTC-3’
[33]. The cycle conditions were as follows: 95°C 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 65°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 30 s. The threshold cycle (Ct) was defined
as the cycle number at which the fluorescence intensity
passed a predetermined threshold. The quantification of
each miRNA relative to actin gene was calculated using
the equation: N = 2-ΔCt, ΔCt = CtmiRNA-Ctacin [34,35].
