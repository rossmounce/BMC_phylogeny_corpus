Abstract
Background: Two or more species are cryptic, if they are morphologically similar, biologically distinct, and misclassified
as a single species. Cryptic species complexes were recently discovered within many bat species and we suspect that
the bent-wing bat, Miniopterus schreibersii, found in Europe, northern Africa, and Asia Minor, could also form such a
complex. Populations of M. schreibersii decline in most of the European countries and the species is currently listed as
Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List. Finding that M. schreibersii is not a single species, but a species complex, would
have a considerable impact on its conservation strategies, as the abundance of each component taxon would be
much smaller than the one estimated for the nominal species.
Results: Miniopterus schreibersii in Asia Minor consists of two genetically diverged lineages, which are reciprocally
monophyletic on three mitochondrial DNA markers, have a diagnostic set of multilocus allele frequencies, and show a
marked difference in their population structures. The lineages differ slightly in their size, wing shape, and echolocation
call parameters. Although these differences are sufficient to discriminate between the lineages, they are not fully
diagnostic in reference to individuals. We suggest that the lineages endured the major Northern Hemisphere
glaciations in different glacial refugia and colonized Asia Minor after the last glacial maximum. The lineages are
allopatric, which is neither delineated by the presence of geographical barriers nor associated with the specific climatic
conditions, and which we link to competitive exclusion.
Conclusions: The distinctions between the lineages comply with most of the criteria required for species delineation
imposed by various species concepts. Accordingly, we conclude that M. schreibersii in Asia Minor is represented by two
cryptic species. Our results imply that the distributional range of the nominal species is almost exclusively limited to
Europe and the coastal zones of Asia Minor. As populations of M. schreibersii seem to be much smaller than currently
assumed, conservation strategies regarding this taxon need to be revised. The exact distributional range and the
vulnerability of the suggested sister species to M. schreibersii is yet to be assessed.
Background
Two or more species are cryptic, if they are morphologically similar, biologically distinct, and misclassified as a
single nominal species [1]. Identification of cryptic species is particularly important in terms of conservation
efforts and biodiversity assessments. Species that are
apparently in no need of protection may in fact consist of
several cryptic and vulnerable component taxa. Similarly,
the species richness of some habitats can be considerably

underestimated, lowering their conservation status,
because of unrecognized cryptic diversity. Identification
of cryptic species often starts with a discovery of diverged
matrilineal lineages and the typical sequence differences
between intra- and interspecific lineages have been quantified for the cytochrome-b gene (Cytb) [2]. To delineate
species, however, the evidence from mitochondrial DNA
has to be accompanied by the supportive data from
nuclear markers, detailed phenotypic examination, and
geographical distribution analyses.
Speciation without morphological divergence is usually
linked to selection promoting morphological invariance
or to the use of nonvisual mating signals [1]. Thus it is not

surprising that cryptic diversity is particularly common
among bats, which communicate their reproductive signals through acoustic calls [3]. Only over the recent few
years DNA sequence analyses revealed the presence of 14
previously unrecognized bat species in the western Palaearctic [4,5].
In this study we investigate the bent-wing bat, Miniopterus schreibersii (Kuhl, 1817). Up to recently, M.
schreibersii was considered to be a cosmopolitan species
with a near-global distribution [6]. A number of molecular studies, however, proved that M. schreibersii was a
species complex [7-9] and its presently recognized distributional range is limited to Europe, northern Africa, and
Asia Minor [10]. With stable populations in the Balkans
and Turkey, and declining in most of the European countries, M. schreibersii is listed as Near Threatened in the
IUCN Red List [10]. Yet, even within its constrained distributional range, M. schreibersii might not be a single
nominal species and, in consequence, its populations
might be much smaller than currently thought.
In Asia Minor, M. schreibersii consists of two morphologically similar but genetically diverged matrilineal lineages, which might be indicative of a cryptic species
complex. The lineages are reciprocally monophyletic and
differ by ca. 9% on the mitochondrial control region
[11,12], ca. 6% on the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2
(ND2) and ca. 4% on Cytb [9]. Calculations based on the
ND2 and Cytb data estimate that the lineages split ca. 2.0
to 0.5 Myr BP, implying separation in disjunct Pleistocene
glacial refugia. The lineages are allopatric and separated
along a zone passing through Central Anatolia [12].
To examine the hypothesis that M. schreibersii in Asia
Minor forms a cryptic species complex, we employ a multidisciplinary approach. We use molecular markers to
analyze the distribution of the lineages, their population
structure and reproductive isolation. We examine morphological and echolocation data to measure ecological
divergence of the lineages. Because allopatric populations
are per se reproductively isolated, we focus on the putative contact zone between the lineages in Central Anatolia, where the probability of finding mixed colonies or
interbreeding individuals is the highest. The sampled
roosts are located within different climatic regimes and
separated from each other by distances, which M.
schreibersii is able to cover in its migratory movements
[13,14]. The location of the roosts allows us to examine
the suggestion that the allopatric distribution of the lineages is caused by different climatic preferences [11].

Methods
Sampling

Samples were collected during summer in nine underground sites. The sites were located in the area of about
500 km by 400 km in the south of Turkey, which covered

Page 2 of 12

parts of the Central Anatolian Plateau and the Mediterranean Sea coast (Figure 1). In each site, ca. 20 bats were
caught by a hand net. Bats were sexed, measured, and
their right wing photographed. Some individuals had
their echolocation calls recorded. Tissue samples were
collected from the wing membrane by 3 mm biopsypunchers as outlined by Worthington Wilmer & Barratt
[15] and stored in 80% ethyl alcohol. After sampling, bats
were immediately released. Our research was approved
by the Boğaziçi University Ethics Committee on Animal
Research (BÜHADYEK).
Mitochondrial and Microsatellite Markers

Genomic DNA was extracted from biopsy punches following the Roche High Pure PCR Template Preparation
Kit protocol. The mitochondrial control region was
amplified with two primers, L15408 and E following the
procedures described in Irwin et al. [16] and Wilkinson &
Chapman [17]. PCR products were purified and
sequenced with primer E in Macrogen Inc. Korea. The
resulting 152 sequences were edited with Sequencher v.
4.9 (Genecodes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA); the percent
of quality bases for each of the sequences varied from
90.2 to 99.8% and the average quality score was 97.2%.
The sequences were aligned using Clustal × v. 1.8 [18]
and inspected visually. The sequences representing
unique haplotypes have been deposited to GenBank with
the accession numbers [HM044071-HM044103]. Our
data were analyzed together with 39 sequences reported
previously [11,12].
Microsatellite loci were amplified with ten pairs of
primers, Mschreib2, Mschreib4, CH37, CH85, CH87,
CHA14, CHB12, CHD2, CHD3, and NCAM following the
procedures described in Miller-Butterworth et al. [19],
Han et al. [20], and Moore et al. [21]. Four loci, CH85,
CHA14, CHD3, and NCAM, were monomorphic and
were excluded from further analyses. Microsatellite loci
were scored in Macrogen Inc. Korea. To detect the presence of possible errors in our data we used MicroChecker 2.2 [22]. No null alleles, large allelic dropout, or
other errors were identified.
Lineage Identification

We refer to the matrilineal lineages of M. schreibersii as
M. s. schreibersii (type locality: Kolumbacs cave, Romania; Kuhl, 1817) and M. s. pallidus (type locality: South
coast of Caspian Sea, Iran; Thomas, 1907). Our delineation of the lineages is not based on a difference in dorsal
coloration, which traditionally was used to distinguish
these subspecies but proved to be inconsistent with their
genetic identity [12]. Instead, we refer to the similarity of
the mitochondrial control region sequences of M.
schreibersii from Bulgaria (located near the type locality
of M. s. schreibersii) to one of the lineages and the

sequences of M. schreibersii from Iran and NagornoKarabakh (located near the type locality of M. s. pallidus)
to the second one. The lineages can be easily identified by
the ten-base fragment, which starts in the beginning of
mitochondrial control region (at the seventh position
after tRNA-Pro). The fragment 'C-TGTCAAGT' is typical for M. s. schreibersii and the fragment 'TATGCTGGAC' is typical for M. s. pallidus. These fragments have
been invariant in all sequences of the mitochondrial control region examined by us up to now.
Mitochondrial and Nuclear Data Analyses

DNA polymorphism of the mitochondrial control region
was assessed by nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity. Genetic divergence was measured by the average
number of pairwise nucleotide differences and the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site with the

Jukes and Cantor correction (JC) [23,24]. The relevant
statistics were computed with DnaSP v. 5.00.07 [25] and
Arlequin 3.11 [26]. We used the JC estimate, because the
number of nucleotide substitutions per site was less than
0.1, in which case all correction methods calculate about
the same distances as JC for closely related sequences
[27]. Genetic diversity in the microsatellite data was evaluated by the mean alleles number and the proportion of
heterozygotes; both calculated with GeneClass2 [28].
GeneClass2 was also used to implement an assignment
test with Bayesian computational criteria [29].
Population genetic structure was investigated by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) with F (microsatellites) or Φ statistics (mtDNA control region); significance
of the fixation indices was assessed with 50 000 permutations with Arlequin v. 3.11. Correlations between genetic
divergences and geographic distances were analyzed by

Furman et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:121
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/121

plotting pairwise Rousset's distance (ΦST/[1- ΦST] or FST/
[1- FST]) against the logarithm of geographical distance
[30]. Statistical significance of correlations was assessed
by a Mantel test with 10,000 randomizations as implemented in IBDWS v. 3.15 [31]. Genealogical relationships
among haplotypes based on the mitochondrial data were
estimated by a statistical parsimony network using 95%
connection limit [32] with TCS v. 1.21 [33].
Demographic history was inferred from a mismatch
distribution analysis [34] and raggedness statistics [35].
The models' goodness of fit and the population expansion
time parameters (τ) were assessed with 10,000 bootstrap
replicates using Arlequin v. 3.11. Approximate time to
population expansion events was estimated with the
assumption of a mutation rate of 20% per Myr [36] and a
generation time of five years [14]. Although the assumed
mutation rate was calibrated for D-loop in Nyctalus
noctula, it was also used to estimate population expansion times for M. schreibersii [11,12,14]. Additionally, the
approximation of 20% per Myr represents the average
mutation rate estimated for other mammals, which varies
from 10% per Myr for house mouse [37], through 12-17%
per Myr for humans [38], to 30% per Myr for steppe bison
[39].
Phylogenetic trees were constructed with Neighbour
Joining method (NJ) [40]. We used the NJ method as it
can easily accommodate short internal branches and is
recommended for constructing phylogenetic trees of
closely related species [41]. For the mitochondrial data,
the tree was generated with PAUP* v. 4.0b10 [42]. In the
mitochondrial control region analysis we included four
sequences from Bulgaria [GenBank: EU332359,
EU332360, EU332369, and EU332378], two sequences
from Iran [GenBank: FJ028638 and FJ028640], and two
sequences from Nagorno-Karabakh [GenBank: FJ028634
and FJ028635], which represent samples collected near
the type localities of M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus
[11,12]. For the microsatellite data, the tree was constructed with Poptree (N. Takezaki, Max-Planck Institut
für Biologie, Tuebingen, Germany) using the modified
Cavalli-Sforza distance [43]. The nodal support was
assessed from 10,000 nonparametric bootstrap replicates.
Morphometric and Echolocation Data

Morphometric measurements consisted of body mass
(precision: ± 0.5 g) and wing measurements (precision ±
0.1 mm). The wing measurements included forearm
length (FA) measured on captured bats and phalanges
length of the third, fourth, and fifth digit measured on
wing photographs. Juvenile bats were excluded from
analyses. We used wing measurements to compute tip
index, aspect ratio index, and area index as described in
Findley et al. [44]. Morphological wing data were ana-

lyzed with a t-test and a stepwise discriminant function
analysis.
Echolocation calls were recorded in a flight tent (5 m ×
1.5 m × 1.5 m) and/or from hand-released bats with a
time expansion bat detector (D240x, Pettersson Elektronik AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using a sampling frequency
of 44.1 kHz with 16 bits/sample. Only the search-phase
calls were recorded. The calls, after frequency transformation, were stored on a digital sound recorder (Edirol R09, Roland Corporation). The recordings were analyzed
with BatSound v. 3.31 (Pettersson Elektronik AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The analyzed echolocation call parameters
included starting frequency, terminal frequency, peak frequency, band width (a difference between starting and
terminal frequencies), and call duration. For each bat, the
echolocation call parameters were averaged from the five
best quality recordings. The echolocation parameters
were analyzed by a t-test and a stepwise discriminant
function analysis.

Results
Distribution

Miniopterus s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus were strictly
allopatric within their putative contact zone. The colonies of both lineages were found on the Central Anatolian
Plateau with the semiarid steppe climate and on the Mediterranean Sea coast with the wet Mediterranean climate.
Similarly, there was no distinction in the altitude of the
roost occupied by M. s. schreibersii or M. s. pallidus,
which in both cases were located on elevations varying
from ca. 200 m to 1600 m Above Sea Level.
Mitochondrial and Microsatellite Data

The 191 mitochondrial control region sequences (110 M.
s. schreibersii and 81 M. s. pallidus), were 418 or 419 bp
long. The sequences of M. s. pallidus were longer because
of a base insertion at the ninth position after Pro-tRNA
gene. The sequences yielded 43 unique haplotypes: 27 in
M. s. schreibersii and 16 in M. s. pallidus (Additional file
1). The average haplotype diversity within M. s. schreibersii was 0.84 ± 0.03 and 0.71 ± 0.05 within M. s. pallidus;
the average nucleotide diversities (JC) were 0.0067 ±
0.0004 and 0.0036 ± 0.0004, respectively. There were 19
fixed differences between M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus, 25 substitutions were polymorphic in M. s.
schreibersii, but monomorphic in M. s. pallidus, 9 substitutions were polymorphic in M. s. pallidus, but monomorphic in M. s. schreibersii, and 4 substitutions were
shared. The average number of nucleotide differences
was 29.77 and the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site (JC) between M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus was 0.075 ± 0.005.
The six polymorphic microsatellite loci scored for 174
individuals (95 M. s. schreibersii and 79 M. s. pallidus)

Furman et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:121
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/121

yielded 57 distinct alleles. The mean allele richness was
6.33 ± 3.67 in M. s. schreibersii and 8.00 ± 3.23 in M. s.
pallidus; the mean heterozygosities were 0.42 ± 0.31 and
0.63 ± 0.23, respectively. When only a single locus was
analyzed, an assignment test with the threshold of scores
set to 0.05 correctly identified from 80% (Mschreib4) to
98% (CH37) of individuals as M. s. schreibersii or M. s.
pallidus. With all six microsatellite loci, the test correctly
identified 100% of individuals (quality index = 99.92%),
indicating that each lineage had a diagnostic set of multilocus allele frequencies.
The unrooted NJ tree constructed from microsatellite
data clearly separated colonies of M. s. schreibersii and M.
s. pallidus with 100% bootstrap support (Figure 2). Similarly, the tree based on the mitochondrial data also recovered two distinct lineages of M. s. schreibersii and M. s.
pallidus with 100% bootstrap support (Figure 2). The M.
s. schreibersii clade included the sequences from Bulgaria
and the M. s. pallidus clade included the sequences from
Iran and Nagorno-Karabakh.
Population Genetic Structure

The average haplotype diversity within the colonies of M.
s. schreibersii varied from 0.58 to 0.77 and the average
nucleotide diversity varied from 0.0035 to 0.0069 (Table
1). The colonies showed only a moderate genetic differentiation with 74% of the molecular variance explained by
within colonies diversity (ΦST = 0.257, p < 0.001). Pair-

Page 5 of 12

wise fixation indices were larger between Karanlık and
other colonies (0.352 to 0.478) than between the remaining pairs (≤ 0.226) (Table 2). Rousset's distances calculated for pairs of the M. s. schreibersii colonies strongly
correlated with the logarithm of geographic distances
between them (r = 0.91; p < 0.001). Within the colonies of
M. s. pallidus, the average haplotype diversity varied
more and the average nucleotide diversity was lower (0.28
to 0.84 and 0.0014 to 0.0041, respectively). The colonies
of M. s. pallidus also revealed a much weaker population
structure; 92% of the molecular variance was assigned to
within colonies diversity (ΦST = 0.081, p = 0.003). All, but
one, fixation indices between the colonies of M. s. pallidus were smaller than 0.1. The only exception was the
Armutludelik-Asarini pair; the two farthest colonies (ΦST
= 0.257). Although there was a considerable correlation
between Rousset's distances and the logarithm of geographic separation between pairs of the M. s. pallidus colonies, the relation was not significant (r = 0.74; p = 0.084).
The mean number of microsatellite alleles within the
colonies of M. s. schreibersii varied from 3.33 to 4.50 and
the proportion of heterozygotes ranged from 0.38 to 0.50
(Table 1). There was only a slight genetic differentiation
among the colonies of M. s. schreibersii and 97% of the
molecular variation was explained by within colony
diversity (FST = 0.027, p < 0.001). Within the colonies of
M. s. pallidus both the mean number of alleles, and the
proportion of heterozygotes were higher than in M. s.
schreibersii: 5.50 to 6.50 and 0.58 to 0.67, respectively.
The colonies of M. s. pallidus did not show any indications of gene flow restrictions and almost 100% of molecular variance was explained by within colony diversity
(FST = 0.002, p = 0.307). Pairwise differences (FST)
between the colonies of M. s. schreibersii were very small,
signifying only weak population structure (Table 2).
Rousset's distances calculated for pairs of the colonies of
M. s. schreibersii strongly correlated with the logarithm of
geographic distances between them (r = 0.69; p = 0.020).
The colonies of M. s. pallidus showed no between-colony
differentiations as indicated by pairwise fixation indices
being about one order of magnitude smaller than those
observed in M. s. schreibersii. Similarly, there was no correlation between Rousset's distances and the logarithm of
geographic distances in M. s. pallidus (r = -0.06; p =
0.627).
Statistical Parsimony Network

(left) and microsatellite (right) data. Accession mark GenBank sequences of M. s. schreibersii from Bulgaria (EU332359, EU332360,

and FJ028635). The nodal support is shown only for the main lineages.

A statistical parsimony network of M. s. schreibersii was
built around the most common haplotype SX08 (38 individuals; 35%; absent in Karanlık) (Figure 3). Because of its
central position in the network, high number of connections, and a spacious distribution, SX08 was accepted to
be the most plausible candidate for the ancestral haplotype of M. s. schreibersii. Although SX03 and SX16 also

had many connections to other haplotypes, SX03 had a
marginal position in the network and SX16 was spatially
constrained to Karanlık. Additionally, SX16 was linked to
other colonies almost entirely through 'absent-haplotype'
connections. A statistical parsimony network of M. s. pallidus was constructed around the central haplotype PX12
(9 individuals; 10%; absent in Delikli). Although this haplotype was neither the most common nor the most widespread, its central position and connections to six other
haplotypes made it a likely candidate to be the ancestral
haplotype within the M. s. pallidus colonies. There was a
pronounced southward decrease in haplotype diversity

within the colonies of M. s. pallidus: the most common
hyplotype, PX03, was present in 7% of individuals in
Armutludelik, 55% in Epçik, 60% in Delikli, and 85% in
Asarini (Figure 1). Correspondingly, frequencies of private haplotypes were 45%, 30%, 10%, and 0%, respectively.
Mismatch Distribution

The mismatch distribution analysis suggested population
expansion models for demographic histories of M. s.
schreibersii and M. s. pallidus. Harpending's raggedness
indices were rM.s.s. = 0.065 and rM.s.p. = 0.044. In the demographic expansion models, the probabilities of observing

distributions with higher raggedness under a null hypothesis of population expansion were pM.s.s. = 0.11 and pM.s.p.
= 0.73. The sums of squared differences between the
observed and expected distributions were no significant
(pM.s.s. = 0.15; pM.s.p. = 0.45). The estimated time of the
demographic expansion was 21.5 kyr BP (95% C. I.: 36.5
to 6.6 kyr BP) for M. s. schreibersii (τ = 3.6) and 13.7 kyr
BP (95% C. I.: 29.2 to 0.4 kyr BP) for M. s. pallidus (τ =
2.3).
Morphometrics

The body mass was taken in 133 individuals (73 M. s.
schreibersii and 60 M. s. pallidus). Miniopterus s.
schreibersii was a lighter bat than M. s. pallidus (13.0 ±
1.1 g and 14.7 ± 1.2 g, respectively); the difference being
significant at the 0.001 level. There were not any significant differences in weight between sexes within each
group.
The wing measurements were analyzed for 150 individuals (78 M. s. schreibersii and 72 M. s. pallidus). The average forearm length of M. s. schreibersii (46 females and 32
males) was 45.7 ± 0.6 mm and that of M. s. pallidus (22
females and 50 males) was 46.8 ± 0.7 mm, the difference

being significant at the 0.001 level. The observed difference in forearm length was almost exactly the same as the
one based on much wider distributional sampling [12].
There was a slight sexual dimorphism within both lineages; females tended to have longer forearms than
males, but the differences were not statistically significant. Forearm lengths of M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus were normally distributed. Except for the 1st phalanx
of the 3rd digit (3c), the average lengths of phalanges
(Table 3) were consistently longer in M. s. pallidus (p <
0.001). The 3c phalanx length was approximately the
same in both groups (p = 0.323). All wing indices differed
significantly at the 0.001 level (tip index: TIM.s.s. = 1.99 ±
0.03 and TIM.s.p. = 1.96 ± 0.03; aspect ratio index: ARM.s.s. =
2.53 ± 0.06 and ARM.s.p. = 2.45 ± 0.04; area index AIM.s.s. =
14756 ± 554 and AIM.s.p. = 15567 ± 481). Stepwise discriminant analysis, using the phalanges and forearm measurements, found a canonical function that included
three variables: forearm length, length of the 2nd phalanx
of the 5th digit, and length of the metacarpal of the 4th
digit; the discriminant function correctly assigned the
group membership in 85% of the individuals.

Echolocation

The echolocation call parameters were analyzed in 33
individuals (13 M. s. schreibersii and 20 M. s. pallidus).
The starting frequency, the peak frequency, and the band
width differed significantly between the lineages at the
0.001 level (Table 4). The terminal frequency and the call
duration were similar in both groups (pduration = 0.294 and
pterminal = 0.270). A stepwise discriminant analysis found a
canonical function that included two variables, the starting frequency and the call duration; the discriminant
function assigned 88% of the individuals to the correct
groups.

Discussion
Cryptic species complexes, in which the component taxa
have not diverged morphologically too much, are very
difficult to identify and their discovery is frequently a
matter of chance. In a recent study investigating the contribution of the 28 Iberian bat species to the cryptic
diversity in Europe, almost 20% of the Iberian bats
showed considerable mitochondrial discontinuities either
within the Iberian or between Iberian and other European samples [4]. One of the very few species, which in
that study proved to be genetically very homogenous, was
M. schreibersii. In Asia Minor, however, M. schreibersii
consists of two genetic lineages, which differ considerably
on three mitochondrial markers (Cytb, ND2, and the control region) and which have the diagnostic set of multilocus allele frequencies [9,12, this study]. The
mitochondrial differentiation between the M. schreibersii
lineages is particularly striking in the light of the similar-

ity observed within each of them; there is only a shallow
differentiation in the control region and almost no differentiation in Cytb between colonies of M. s. schreibersii
sampled in Anatolia, Iberia, or Maghreb [4,9,45]. A similar homogeneity is observed within M. s. pallidus [9].
Population Genetic Structure

The extant colonies of M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus
in Anatolia show visible differences in their population
genetic structure. The colonies of M. s. schreibersii reveal
the moderate differentiation in the control region
sequences accompanied by the very strong correlation
between the genetic and geographic distances. At the
microsatellite level, the differentiation is weak but the
association between the genetic and geographic distances
is still strong. The results are in concordance with the
ones reported for M. s. schreibersii from Portugal, which
were linked to female philopatry and a mainly malemediated gene flow [14]. On the other hand, the colonies
of M. s. pallidus show only a weak differentiation in the
control region sequences and no significant correlation
between the genetic differentiation and geographic distance. The latter outcome, however, should be taken with
a caution as the small number of colonies could profoundly affect the significance of the correlation. At the
microsatellite level, the colonies of M. s. pallidus do not
reveal any indications of population structuring. Both the
differentiation between the colonies and the association
between the genetic and geographic distances are virtually zero, suggesting no constrains imposed on gene flow.
The colonies of M. s. schreibersii in Karanlık and M. s.
pallidus in Asarini and Delikli deserve a special attention

(Figure 1). The former one is distanced from the other
colonies of M. s. schreibersii by about 400-500 km and
interposed by the colonies in Asarini and Delikli, which
mark the south-most border of the Anatolian distribution
of M. s. pallidus. The colony in Karanlık accommodates
only private haplotypes, a signature of an isolated population. Although the intermediate haplotypes connecting
Karanlık to other colonies are mostly missing, Karanlık's
haplotypes occupy the central position in the statistical
parsimony network, suggesting a relatively recent demographic history shared with the other M. s. schreibersii
colonies. On the other hand, the colony in Asarini accommodates only 10% of private haplotypes and Delikli
accommodates none. The pattern of decrease in frequency of private haplotypes from the Central Anatolian
Plateau towards the Mediterranean, complemented by
the increase in frequency of one haplotype, PX03, is
observed in all of the M. s. pallidus colonies. This pattern
may indicate the recent southwards expansion from Central Anatolia. Such expansion would include many
founder/bottleneck episodes and the successful vanguards would dominate the new population genome, a
chain of events inevitably leading to a loss of haplotype
diversity [46,47].
Morphology

Morphologically, M. s. schreibersii is a smaller bat than M.
s. pallidus (shorter forearm length and lower wing area
index) and has narrower and more elongated wings
(higher tip and aspect ratio indices). There are also significant differences in echolocation call parameters between
the lineages. Although, in principle, higher aspect ratio
and tip indices are associated with swifter flight [44] and
variations in echolocation calls are related to utilization
of diverse foraging habitats [48], the differences found
between M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus are relatively
small and the ranges are overlapping. Indeed, even
though wing morphology and echolocation call parameters are sufficient to discriminate between the lineages,
they are not fully diagnostic in reference to a single individual. In consequence, the observed dissimilarities can
probably only minutely affect the foraging performance
of bats, resulting in a considerable overlap in their ecological niches and leaving them prone to an intensive interlineage competition. A similar situation is found in European Plecotus species: echolocation signals of P. macrobullaris are more similar to allopatrically occurring P.
austriacus than to co-occurring P. auritus, although P.
macrobullaris is genetically closer related to P. auritus
[49,50]. In fact, morphological similarity is typical for all
species historically comprising the M. schreibersii complex [7] and may indicate intrinsic deficiency in phenotypic plasticity within these taxa or selection promoting
morphological stasis.

Historical Scenario

According to the estimates based on the Cytb and ND2
data, M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus diverged after
the onset of the major Northern Hemisphere glaciations
in the Lower or Middle Pleistocene [9]. The lineages
probably remained isolated until the end of the last glacial
maximum. The best estimates imply that M. s. schreibersii
survived the major glaciations in a single glacial refugium
in the north-western Anatolia/Balkans and rapidly colonized Europe ca. 15 kyr BP [51]. Asia Minor was probably
colonized earlier by M. s. schreibersii and a few colonies
might have survived the last glacial maximum in one of
the south Anatolian refugia, located along the Mediterranean Sea coast. The latter hypothesis is supported by the
earlier expansion time estimated here for the south Anatolian population (ca. 21 kyr BP) than for the European
expansion. Considerably less can be conjectured about
the history M. s. pallidus; it probably survived the major
glaciations in refugia located somewhere on the southern
coast of the Caspian Sea, the eastern part of the Caucasian refugium. It is unlikely that M. s. pallidus endured
the glacial periods in Colchis, a western part of the Caucasian refugium, as this region is presently occupied by
M. s. schreibersii and it is dubious that the former
replaced the latter. Miniopterus s. pallidus possibly
expanded to Anatolia after the climatic change that followed the end of the last glacial maximum, ca. 13 kyr BP.
The late colonization of the Central Anatolian Plateau
may be a result of the high altitude of the region (and
more severe climatic conditions) and the scarcity of suitable underground habitats. The lineages came to contact
in the Central Anatolia. Probably, when they met, M. s.
schreibersii had already established colonies on the Central Anatolian Plateau and along the Mediterranean Sea
coast.
Distribution

Spatial separation of M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus is
neither delineated by the presence of geographical barriers nor associated with the specific climatic conditions.
Although most of the known colonies of M. s. schreibersii
are found in coastal, low altitude locations with the wet
Mediterranean or Black Sea climate [11,12], the colonies
in Obruk and Demirözü are located in the Central Anatolian Plateau with the semiarid steppe climate on the altitudes of ca. 1600 m and 900 m, respectively. Conversely,
even though M. s. pallidus mainly occupies semiarid
regions of higher altitude, the colonies in Asarini and
Delikli are located near, or on, the Mediterranean Sea
coast exhibiting the wet Mediterranean climate, on the
altitudes of ca. 1600 m and 200 m. Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that both lineages are fully capable of utilizing both inland and coastal habitats, and have similar
ecological niches.

Furman et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:121
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/121

We suggest that in its southwards expansion, M. s. pallidus possibly replaced some colonies of M. s. schreibersii.
The replacement rather than a sympatric coexistence of
the lineages could be caused by the morphological similarities between the lineages and resulting competitive
exclusion [52]. Accordingly, we presume that the extant
geographical distributions of M. s. schreibersii and M. s.
pallidus are the result of the historical and ongoing
expansion events, and interlineage competition rather
than the outcome of climatic preferences as suggested by
Bilgin et al. [11].
Taxonomical Implications

In the light of available evidence, M. s. schreibersii and M.
s. pallidus form two separately evolving lineages, making
them potentially different species [53]. The lineages are
reciprocally monophyletic on the three mitochondrial
DNA markers [9,12], have the diagnostic set of multilocus allele frequencies and their common ancestor is
apparently extinct, satisfying the main criteria imposed
by the phylogenetic species concept [54,55]. The genetic
differentiation between lineages in the mitochondrial
cytochrome-b gene is within the range recognized for sister taxa by the genetic species concept [2]. The lineages
are also phenetically distinguishable, in line with the phenetic species concept [56,57]. Furthermore, the lineages
seem to be reproductively isolated, as implied by the
divergence on nuclear microsatellites in the putative contact zone, despite the lack of any obvious geographic barriers, partly fulfilling requirements of the biological
species concept [58,59].

Conclusions
The distinctions between M. s. pallidus and M. s.
schreibersii seem to be sufficient to recognize M.
schreibersii in Asia Minor as a cryptic species complex
and to grant M. s. pallidus a full species status, a sister
taxon to M. schreibersii. Still, we do not know about the
mechanism of reproductive isolation between M. s.
schreibersii and M. s. pallidus, which probably includes a
difference in mating calls, and we know very little about
their ecological divergence. Further and more extensive
studies are needed to clarify these points.
The results of this study are particularly important for
the conservation of the M. schreibersii. The distributional
range of the nominal species, M. s. schreibersii, is mainly
limited to Europe and the coastal zones of Asia Minor; an
area much smaller than currently recognized by the
IUCN Red List of Threatened Species [10]. The rate of
population decline of M. schreibersii, including stable
populations in the Balkans and Turkey, is estimated to be
approaching 30% [10]. However, taking into consideration that many Turkish populations represent M. s. pallidus, the decline rate of M. s. schreibersii might already be

Page 10 of 12

much higher than estimated by the IUCN Red List.
Accordingly, a thoughtful revision of all conservation
strategies regarding M. s. schreibersii might be crucial to
preserve this taxon. The presence of M. s. pallidus in Asia
Minor requires a protection program, which would estimate abundance of its current populations, identify possible threats, and assess its conservation status.
Finally, the case of M. schreibersii may be indicative for
other bat species, which persisted through the major glaciations in the Anatolian refugia. Here, potential candidates are Rhinolophus euryale and R. ferrumequinum.
Both species consist of considerably diverged matrilineal
lineages [60,61] and each of them could be, in principle, a
cryptic species complex.
