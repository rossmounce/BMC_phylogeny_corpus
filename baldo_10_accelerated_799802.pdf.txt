Accelerated microevolution in an outer
membrane protein (OMP) of the intracellular
bacteria Wolbachia

Abstract
Background: Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Gram-negative bacteria are key players in the biology of
bacterial-host interactions. However, while considerable attention has been given to OMPs of vertebrate pathogens,
relatively little is known about the role of these proteins in bacteria that primarily infect invertebrates. One such
OMP is found in the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia, which are widespread symbionts of arthropods and filarial
nematodes. Recent experimental studies have shown that the Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) can trigger host
immune responses and control cell death programming in humans, suggesting a key role of WSP for
establishment and persistence of the symbiosis in arthropods.
Results: Here we performed an analysis of 515 unique alleles found in 831 Wolbachia isolates, to investigate WSP
structure, microevolution and population genetics. WSP shows an eight-strand transmembrane b-barrel structure
with four extracellular loops containing hypervariable regions (HVRs). A clustering approach based upon patterns of
HVR haplotype diversity was used to group similar WSP sequences and to estimate the relative contribution of
mutation and recombination during early stages of protein divergence. Results indicate that although point
mutations generate most of the new protein haplotypes, recombination is a predominant force triggering diversity
since the very first steps of protein evolution, causing at least 50% of the total amino acid variation observed in
recently diverged proteins. Analysis of synonymous variants indicates that individual WSP protein types are subject
to a very rapid turnover and that HVRs can accommodate a virtually unlimited repertoire of peptides. Overall
distribution of WSP across hosts supports a non-random association of WSP with the host genus, although
extensive horizontal transfer has occurred also in recent times.
Conclusions: In OMPs of vertebrate pathogens, large recombination impact, positive selection, reduced structural
and compositional constraints, and extensive lateral gene transfer are considered hallmarks of evolution in
response to the adaptive immune system. However, Wolbachia do not infect vertebrates. Here we predict that the
rapid turnover of WSP loop motifs could aid in evading or inhibiting the invertebrate innate immune response.
Overall, these features identify WSP as a strong candidate for future studies of host-Wolbachia interactions that
affect establishment and persistence of this widespread endosymbiosis.

Background
Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of pathogenic
bacteria are widely recognized as crucially involved in
bacterial interactions with eukaryotic hosts [1]. They
have thus been the subject of extensive studies aimed to
clarify how they evolve and whether their patterns of
divergence are informative about the biology of host* Correspondence: laura.baldo@unibas.ch

bacteria dynamics. OMPs are involved in a large repertoire of functions, including bacterial invasion and
defense, transportation of various molecules, adhesion
and signaling pathways [1,2]. OMPs of mammalian
pathogenic Proteobacteria often function as antigens [3],
and several of these proteins are currently targets for
vaccine development against important human pathogens, such as Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis [4,5].

OMPs are highly variable and among the fastest
evolving microbial proteins [6,7]. Despite a large diversity of composition and function, they do share genetic
and structural features that allow their identification as
surface proteins, primarily via bioinformatic prediction
[7]. OMPs show a characteristic transmembrane b-barrel structure, formed by an even number of antiparallel
sheets, connected to loops of variable length at the
extracellular side and to short turns containing both N
and C termini at the periplasmic side. Given the key
role of OMPs in the interactions with the host, a large
number of studies have been devoted to uncover
trends in the molecular evolution of these proteins
[4,8-10]. Typically, residues in the b-barrel show the
highest conservation, while variability mainly affects
the conformational domains located in the extracellular loops, which can function as receptors and can be
highly antigenic - e.g. P28 OMPs of Ehrlichia, Opa
proteins of Neisseria and MSP2 proteins of Anaplasma
[11-14].
While considerable attention has been given to OMPs
of vertebrate pathogens, the role and evolution of OMPs
in the establishment and persistence of both pathogenic
and non-pathogenic microbial associations found in
invertebrates remain largely unknown. Recent studies
have shown that both the vertebrate and invertebrate
immune systems can confer specific protection against
bacterial infections and share comparable defensive
solutions [15], making OMP of invertebrate pathogens
important candidates for investigating host/symbiont
interaction dynamics. In addition, for those vertebrate
pathogens that are vectored by arthropods, selection by
the invertebrate innate immune system could shape the
virulence of vertebrate pathogens vectored by invertebrates [16]. Therefore, studies of OMPs in bacteria that
infect invertebrates, but not vertebrates, could reveal to
what extent selection in invertebrates shapes OMP
diversity and evolution.
The Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) is an OMP
found in the intracellular bacteria of the genus Wolbachia [17], a very widespread and important group of
endosymbionts of arthropods and filarial nematodes.
Current estimates indicate that around 60% of arthropod species worldwide are infected with this intracellular bacterium [18]. Wolbachia belong to the
Rickettsiales and relatives are important vertebrate
pathogens within the genera Rickettsia, Ehrlichia and
Anaplasma [19]. However, in contrast to some notable
members of these related genera, Wolbachia are not
pathogens of vertebrates. Instead, theyare mostly known
to be “reproductive parasites” of arthropods [20-22],
while in filarial worms and some insects they are
required for their hosts’ survival and provide them with
some benefits [23-25].

The function of WSP in Wolbachia remains unknown,
although several lines of evidence suggest that it may be
an important mediator of the host/symbiont interaction.
First, WSP is a dominant protein constituent of infected
Drosophila eggs [17]. Experimental studies have shown
that WSP can activate the innate immune response in
humans via interaction with Toll-like receptors [26], and
trigger a potent inflammatory response in both human
and canine filariasis [27]. Recently, WSP has been
shown to delay apoptosis in human polymorphonuclear
cells (PMNs), typically involved in the innate immune
response against microbial pathogens [28]. Finally,
inoculation of WSP in BALB/mice induces the expression and production of nitric oxide, an important toxic
component used by the immune response against bacteria [29]. The above studies indicate that WSP can
induce host immune responses and recent hypothesis
predicts WSP as an important player in the establishment and persistence of the symbiosis via apoptosis
inhibition [30].
WSP shows a heterogeneous pattern of amino acid
diversity characteristic of other OMPs, marked by four
distinct hypervariable regions (HVRs) interspaced by
conserved strings of amino acids (CRs) [31]. Variants at
each HVR have been frequently exchanged across bacterial strains, generating highly chimeric proteins [31].
While shuffling of HVR motifs is apparent, the primary
source of such remarkable amino acid diversity at HVRs
remains unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether
this genetic diversity is adaptive; because arthropod
Wolbachia do not infect vertebrate hosts, selection acting on the protein is not due to a response to the vertebrate adaptive immunity (e.g. antibodies). Other forces,
therefore, are likely to be shaping the evolution of this
protein.
Here we investigated structure and molecular evolution of WSP using 515 distinct alleles found in 831 host
isolates, representing the largest sequence dataset available to date for Wolbachia. The first an in silico prediction of the three-dimensional structure of WSP is
presented. Using the predicted structure as framework,
we investigated the microevolutionary forces that drive
the early diversification of WSP proteins by means of
clusters of closely related proteins based upon haplotype
categories for individual HVRs. This approach eliminates the problems of alignment due to extensive divergence within the HVRs, and allows identification of
closely related HVRs (in different protein variants), thus
providing a ready classification of variation generated
via point mutation versus recombination in recently
divergent proteins. We found that WSP shows a rapid
turnover of amino acid sequences via both high rates of
recombination and positive selection typical of immune
antigens under strong selection for diversification. These

appear as hallmarks of an ongoing arms race between
the host and Wolbachia and identify WSP as a strong
candidate for future studies of host-Wolbachia
interactions.

they differed by locality information. Several alleles were
sequenced during this study and their host information
was combined with information collected from Genbank. Overall, 831 distinct records were collected (see
additional file 1).

Methods
In silico prediction of WSP structure

Sequence Typing

Discrimination of WSP among globular, inner and outer
membrane proteins was assessed based on a position
specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profiles approach, implemented in TMBETADISC-RBF [32]. Prediction was confirmed by querying the complete WSP sequence from
wMel to the HHomp database, available at http://toolkit.
tuebingen.mpg.de/, which detects sequence homology to
known outer membrane proteins (OMPs) based on
sequence-profiles identified with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The WSP two and three-dimensional
structures were then predicted using HHpred [33],
which uses structurally related proteins as template.
Results were inputted into MODELLER [34] using a
multiple alignment for modeling of the tertiary structure. The three-dimensional model was visualized in
cn3D version 4.1 [35]. HHpred has been shown to perform better over simpler approaches (BLAST and PSIBLAST) when template-target similarity is lower than
40% [36], as is the case with WSP and homologous proteins. To correct for diversity among WSP proteins, we
also generated three-dimensional models using a diverse
set of divergent WSP genotypes, besides WSP from
wMel. WSP topology with respect to the outer membrane lipid bilayer was predicted by the posterior decoding method using PRED-TMBB, software based on
Hidden Markov model [37]. Analysis of the hydrophobic
and hydrophilic indexes was performed using the Kyte
and Doolittle scale [38].

All 515 alleles were characterized according to the wsp
typing system previously developed [39]. Briefly, each
unique nucleotide sequence within a defined range of
nucleotides was assigned an allele number and translated into amino acids. The amino acid sequence was
partitioned in four consecutive peptides, each encompassing one of the four HVRs and a short portion of the
two flanking conserved regions. For convenience here
we refer to each of these four sections as HVR (see Fig.
1A for a schematic representation). Each unique HVR
peptide was assigned a number, thus a protein haplotype
is identified by a profile of four peptide numbers (i.e. a
WSP profile). Each wsp allele is always associated with a
single WSP profile; however, the same WSP profile can
be associated to different alleles (i.e. synonymous
alleles). This typing method was developed to overcome
the difficulty of managing wsp nucleotide sequences,
which are highly variable in length and show extremely
low homology at the four HVRs, thus making alignment
reconstructions impracticable (see example in Fig. 1B).
Moreover, the four HVRs of wsp undergo extensive
recombination, which results in mixing HVRs peptides
among proteins [31]. Such a typing system, therefore,
provides a useful means for spotting recombination
events involving divergent HVRs among otherwise
closely related WSP sequences (see also below). All 515
alleles and corresponding HVR haplotype profiles were
uploaded into the wsp database [40].
Analysis of nucleotide genetic diversity and GC content was performed using DNAsp version 4.50 [41,42].
GC content at the third (synonymous only) position was
calculated for each of the six largest WSP complexes
(C1-C6, see below for complex definition) and for the
five MLST genes. Amino acid divergence was calculated
in PAUP version 4.0b10 [43].
To explore whether additional intragenomic sources
might contribute to wsp variability (such as pseudogenes
or other noncoding sequences), complete wsp and single
HVR nucleotide sequences from Drosophila melanogaster and Culex pipiens were BLASTN against the
Wolbachia genomes from these two host species.

Sequence Mining

The nucleotide sequences were either generated during
this study or retrieved from Genbank. New sequences
were obtained using standard primers and protocols
available at http://pubmlst.org/wolbachia/wsp/info/protocol.shtml. The procedure for Genbank retrieval was as
follows: all nucleotide wsp sequences present in Genbank were downloaded and redundancy discarded. The
set of unique wsp sequences that met the length
requirement to be assigned to an allele (see below) and
that showed no ambiguous sites were retained. Together
with the sequences generated in this study a total of 515
distinct alleles were obtained. All sequences were then
compared against the NCBI nucleotide database with
BLASTN. For all exact matches (100% identity and coverage), all available host taxon and country of origin
information were collected. Multiple entries having the
same host species and same wsp allele were retained if

Identification of protein complexes

We identified complexes of closely related WSP proteins
using the clustering program eBURST V3 [44] and
employing the matrix of WSP profiles to depict evolutionary relationships among WSP genotypes. This

Figure 1 WSP gene structure. (A) Schematic representation of WSP structure depicting the signal peptide (SP), the four hypervariable regions
(HVRs), interspaced by four conserved regions (CRs). (B) Representatives of most diverse WSP sequences named by a corresponding allele.
Sections used for typing include HVR motifs plus short stretches of the two flanking CRs (bracketed below the two alignments).

approach is superior to conventional phylogenetic analyses, in this case, because it reveals localized recombination (i.e. involving short intragenic sequences) among
otherwise similar WSP sequences, without incorrectly
inferring such sequences as phylogenetically distant. The
program eBURST is typically used for analysis of MLST
allelic profiles (where each allele at each MLST locus is
given a number and an allelic profile is the combination
of allele numbers at the MLST loci) and assumes an epidemic model of population structure for building the
clusters: that is, it assumes that a founder genotype (an
allelic profile) initially rises in frequency and subsequently diversifies to produce minor variants (i.e. single
locus variants, SLV), hence producing a “clonal complex” of closely related genotypes. Given a matrix of
allelic profiles, eBURST predicts the ancestral genotype
to be the profile with the greatest number of single
locus variants. Often the founder is also the most
frequent profile in a complex (in terms of isolates in
which is found).
Here we applied the same clustering algorithm to a
single locus, thus using WSP profiles. WSP profiles were
clustered into “WSP complexes”, where a WSP complex
is a group of related WSP profiles that differ at a single

HVR peptide (here named single HVR variant, SHV)
with respect to the ancestral profile. The ancestral profile of each complex is predicted by eBURST to be the
WSP profile with the highest number of SHVs. Profiles
that could not be assigned to a group were named
singletons.
Recombination versus mutation estimates

We used the complexes identified by eBURST to estimate the relative contribution of recombination versus
mutation that give rise to new proteins. Within complexes, mutant profiles were discriminated from recombinant profiles (and associated alleles) by assessing
whether SHVs diverged by mutation or recombination.
The procedure was as follows. First, within each WSP
complex, all WSP profiles were compared to the ancestral profile and the number of amino acid changes at
their SHV was annotated. In case of complexes of two
profiles we performed a simple pairwise comparison.
This allowed a first screening for major recombinant
proteins, defined as the WSP profiles that showed 4 or
more amino acid polymorphic sites at their SHVs
(including both amino acid substitutions and indels)
with respect to the ancestral type. All other profiles

within a complex, which then showed 1 to 3 polymorphic sites at their SHVs, were compared to the
whole dataset and nucleotide substitution patterns
inspected. If a SHV peptide was shared among profiles
in different complexes, then mutation was assumed
when the nucleotide substitution patterns at their SHV
differed. In cases of matching substitution patterns, a) a
single nucleotide substitution (thus nonsynonymous)
was assumed to be arisen by convergence and the profiles retained as mutants, b) multiple shared nucleotide
substitutions were considered sign of recombination and
the recombinant profile was predicted to be the one
with highest number of amino acid changes with respect
to its ancestral profile. If equal, both profiles were
labeled as recombinants. The relative contribution of
recombination to mutation in generating protein diversity was measured as a ratio of recombination to mutation per protein and per HVR. We are aware that this
approximation does not take into account mutation and
recombination events that did not result in amino acid
changes (i.e. synonymous substitutions); indeed our goal
was to explore the contribution of the two forces in promoting protein diversity, and not synonymous allele
diversity. In addition, we have also examined recombination occurrence among distinct alleles carrying only
synonymous substitutions (see below). The recombination analyses were also expanded to profiles members of
subgroups and subgroup founders (coded as double
HVR variants, DHVs).
Prediction of the ancestral alleles

Ancestral proteins predicted by eBURST can be coded
by multiple alleles within a complex. To identify the
ancestral allele and confirm eBURST prediction we proceeded as follows. First, within a complex, all alleles
associated to mutant profiles, including synonymous
alleles, were further analyzed at the nucleotide level to
exclude recombination occurrence using the method of
Betran et al [45], implemented in the DNAsp. Second,
the ancestral allele of each complex was predicted using
a statistical parsimony method [46] carried out in TCS
software version 1.21 [47].
Analysis of selective pressures

Selection on mutant alleles was investigated using the
complexes previously detected. For complexes that
included at least four sequences (n = 25, including also
those coding for DHVs) all alleles were tested for neutrality, using the Tajima’s D [48]. For complexes of
three or more alleles for which the ancestral allele was
identified (n = 29), rates of non-synonymous substitutions (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) per
codon were estimated using the codeml program in
PAML package [49,50]. Specifically, for each complex

Page 5 of 18

we generated a simple star tree with a bifurcation at the
deepest node to assign the root (corresponding to the
ancestral allele) and used it as input file for codeml.
Four models were tested: the nearly neutral model (M1),
which assumes a proportion p0 of conserved sites with
ω0 < 1 and p1 = 1 - p0 of neutral sites with ω = 1; the
positive-selection model (M2), which includes an additional class of sites with frequency p2 = 1 - p0 - p1 and
with ω2 estimated from the data; the model M7, which
assumes that ω is b-distributed and provides a flexible
null hypothesis for testing positive selection; and the
model M8, which includes one additional ω class of
sites with respect to M7, estimated from the data. We
performed two likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) comparing
likelihood scores of M1 vs M2 and M7 vs M8. The presence of positively selected sites within each complex
was determined by concordance between the two bestselected models using the Bayes Empirical Bayes analysis
(BEB).
To explore selective pressures acting on partitions of
wsp, the nucleotide alignment including the 515 alleles
was divided into seven sections corresponding to hvr1,
CR2, hvr2, CR3, hvr3, CR4 and hvr4. For this particular
analysis, each hvr (here non capitalized to distinguish
them from sections used for typing) comprises only the
strings of hypervariable amino acids, thus excluding any
portions of the flanking conserved regions. Section
boundaries for hvrs were based on the alignment in
Baldo et al. [31], where a similar analysis was performed
using a much smaller dataset. Within each of the seven
sections, redundancy of nucleotide sequences was discarded and sequences were grouped using BlastClust,
available at http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/, based on
95% cutoff of nucleotide identity and 100% matching
length. This clustering approach considers related
regions of wsp even if inserted in a recombinant background. For each wsp section, dN/dS ratios were estimated at each cluster of three or more sequences using
the method of Nei and Gojobori (1986) [51], implemented in DNAsp. Average values across groups within each
section were then calculated. For few groups within
hvrs, dN/dS values were not available, as sequences
diverged only by nonsynonymous substitutions returning
no ratios; although suggestive of positive selection, these
groups were conventionally assigned dN/dS = 1 as a
conservative estimate.
Analysis of synonymous allele variants

For each of the 435 proteins in our dataset, number of
allele variants, average synonymous diversity and number and type of polymorphisms were estimated using
DNAsp. As a control, we compared these estimates to
those obtained for the five MLST housekeeping genes,
using a dataset of published and partly unpublished

Baldo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:48
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/48

data. Statistical significance of difference in values
between wsp and each of the five MLST genes was
inferred performing a Wilcoxon two-sample test.
Statistical association of WSP sequences with host taxa

The rarefaction curve was built using the online calculator available at http://www2.biology.ualberta.ca/jbrzusto/
rarefact.php. Curve fitting to predict the asymptotic
number of WSP proteins was performed using the online regression analysis at site http://www.xuru.org/rt/
NLR.asp#Manually. The 37 points along the curve were
used for curve fitting to formulae allowing for three
parameters.
We tested whether genetic distances between WSP
protein sequences that are found in hosts within the
same genus were more similar than they would be by
random chance. We choose to analyze proteins instead
of nucleotide sequences to facilitate generation of alignments and because WSP amino acid diversity largely
reflects the nucleotide diversity. The procedure was as
follows: the 515 wsp sequences were translated into
amino acids, aligned using ClustalX [52] and manually
curated in Bioedit vs7.0.4.1 [53]. The HVR4 was eliminated from the analyses as difficult to align and highly
recombinant. A distance matrix was generated based on
the amino acid alignment using PAUP version 4.0b10
[43].
To determine whether WSP sequences were significantly associated with host genera, we sub-sampled the
initial dataset to comprise only one host species per wsp
allele, that is, the dataset included multiple representatives of the same species only in case they carried
distinct wsp alleles. This avoids overrepresentation of a
single wsp sequence found in the same host species but
from different geographical regions. The final dataset
included 732 entries. In order to create a null distribution, we generated 1000 pseudoreplicates by randomly
resampling host taxa without replacement across all
WSP sequences. For each pseudoreplicate we calculated
the mean and median pairwise distances between WSP
sequences within the taxonomic group being tested. We
then compared the original mean and median values
with the resulting pseudoreplicate distribution in a onetailed test to determine p-values. For this association
study we first performed a global analysis resampling all
WSP pairwise distances within and between host genera
separately and averaging the two sets of values; we then
tested the association within individual genera.

Three-dimensional structure prediction of WSP: an eight
b-barrel OMP

WSP was identified as an OMP by the PSSM profiles
approach and by BLAST search against the HHomp

Page 6 of 18

database (P = 100%). The best BLAST match outside
Wolbachia was the major outer membrane protein
P28-14 of Ehrlichia muris (AccNo. ABD93654, 29%
identity, 43% of positives, 20% gaps), and second best
match was the surface antigen MSP4 of Ehrlichia canis
str. Jake (YP_303460, 29% identity, 43% of positives,
22% gaps). Among proteins with characterized threedimensional structure, HHpred search identified the
outer membrane protein NspA from Neisseria meningitidis as most resembling WSP (23% identity, P = 99.96,
E-value = 8.7e-27). Use of a set of divergent WSP
sequences also returned the same best hits. Based on a
concordance of structure prediction between the two
programs, WSP of the wMel strain was then modeled
based on NspA. Results of the modeling showed an
eight b-barrel structure with four extracellular loops
(Fig. 2A). Although overall identity between WSP and
NspA is only 23%, much of the variability between the
two proteins is associated to the hypervariable loops,
much longer in WSP, while secondary structure and
amino acid strings interspacing the hypervariable loops
are quite conserved. In general, hypervariable loops are
not conserved among predicted eight b-barrel OMPs
or among WSP sequences, signifying that loops do not
greatly contribute to the folding and stability of the
protein.
The analysis of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic pattern (Kyte & Doolittle scale) and prediction of WSP
position on the lipid bilayer (Fig. 2B) confirmed that
WSP shows a typical eight B-barrel structure with four
hydrophilic extracellular loops and periplasmic turns
connected to a b-barrel core containing predominantly
the neutral or polar residues valine, alanine, glycine and
tyrosine, in accordance to the typical composition of
b-barrel proteins [7].
This computationally based structural analysis provided a framework to compare the patterns of protein
evolution in different predicted functional domains.
Genetic diversity of WSP

Based on the 515 alleles analyzed, WSP proteins can differ by as much as 43% of their amino acid content and
13% in length (Table 1). This variability is largely associated to the HVR motifs, contained in the loops, which
show little homology and are rich in indels (see Fig. 1B
for an example). In particular, HVR4 sequences (located
in L4) can differ by up to 42% in length and are thus
responsible for a large part of this protein diversity. The
number of distinct peptides is similar across the four
HVRs, ranging from 182 to 207 (Table 1). In contrast,
the short regions interspacing HVRs (CRs) show an
average amino acid homology >90% and no indels, likely
due to structural constraints. The CRs largely form the
b-barrel scaffold in the predicted three-dimensional

Figure 2 Predicted folding and localization of WSP in the outer membrane. WSP shows an eight antiparallel stranded b-barrel structure
with four highly hydrophilic loops (L1-4) protruding into the extracellular side (OUT). C- and N-termini are in the periplasmic side (IN). Loop size
and amino acid content greatly vary among WSP sequences, thus exact folding and localization for these extracellular regions cannot be reliably
predicted.

To circumvent the problem of such extensive variation
among proteins and HVRs, we focused on recently

approach allowed us to identify recent events of recombination and mutation in evolving proteins.

Figure 3 Clusters of closely related WSP proteins (n = 252) estimated by eBURST. Circles correspond to distinct proteins; area of the circles
is proportional to the number of allele variants coding for a protein. Clusters of linked proteins (i.e. WSP complexes C1-57) are identified as
groups of proteins sharing three out of four HVR haplotypes (SHVs) with a primary founder (in blue); subgroup founders (yellow) connect to
double HVR variants (DHV). In red are recombinant proteins within a complex, labeled with the corresponding allele number or a representative
allele in case of multiple variants (*). For clarity only complexes with at least three proteins or recombinants were labeled (C1-19, C47, C51). 183
singletons were removed. Refer to Additional file 2 for profile and allele identification within complexes.

complexes identified were C1 to C10; complex C1 and
C2 were the largest, each comprising 23 distinct profiles/proteins.
Among identified complexes, 29 contained at least three
distinct but related proteins for which the putative founder protein could be predicted (Additional file 2). We
note that assignment of the founder genotype by
eBURST does not take into account the number of allele
variants coding for it, nor its genotype frequency across
isolates. Nevertheless, within each complex, typically the
predicted founder was also the protein with the highest
number of allele variants, and the one found in the largest host taxonomical range (see below). These lines of
evidence further support the accuracy of the founder
sequence assignment. We used these complexes and
predicted founders to assign directionality to the evolutionary changes and to estimate relative rates of mutation and recombination.

Recent evolution of WSP sequences: interplay of
mutation and recombination

Within complexes, examination of the number of amino
acid changes between single hypervariable region variants (SHVs) and the founder protein indicates that the
majority of new HVRs arose by point mutation
(Fig. 4A), and none by indels. This is true for all four
HVRs. Overall, 88.5% of the newly evolved proteins
arose by point mutations. Nevertheless recombination
was responsible for generating a substantial amount of
the new proteins (11.53%, see also Fig. 3 in red). Among
HVRs, HVR2 was the least recombinant, with no events
detected in our dataset (Fig. 4A). HVR4 showed the
highest number of both recombination (7.7%) and mutation (29.5%) events, suggesting it is either a hot spot for
both processes or variants in HVR4 are more often
selectively advantageous. It should be noted that we are
not observing the actual frequencies of recombination

and mutation, but rather those that have persisted long
enough to be detected. Therefore, these mostly represent variants that are either neutral or selectively
advantageous.
In terms of the relative contribution of recombination
versus mutation to WSP genetic diversity (Fig. 4B), it is
notable that in half of the recombinant cases detected
(9/18) recombination introduced more than 10 amino
acid changes. As a result, although mutation contributes
the most to generating new proteins/HVR peptides
(i.e. overall haplotype diversity: 88.46% mutation vs

11.53% recombination, Fig. 4A), the contribution of the
two forces to WSP amino acid diversity is almost equal
(50.56% vs 49.43%, Fig. 4B). As a striking example,
although the relative contribution of mutation and
recombination to HVR4 haplotype diversity is approximately 3:1 (Fig 4A), the relative contribution to
HVR4 amino acid diversity is 1: 2 (Fig. 4B): 75% of the
observed HVR4 amino acid diversity is in fact due to
recombination.
When analyses were expanded to include subgroups
within complexes (Fig. 3, subgroup founders in yellow),

Baldo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:48
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/48

the proportion of recombinants increased from 11.53%
to 28.6%: 10 out of 35 subgroup profiles were recombinants at one HVR at least, all 10 showing more than 10
amino acids changes with respect to the ancestral HVR.
A large impact of recombination among more divergent
WSP

Estimating recombination between complexes was more
challenging, as without a common founder genotype we
could not assign directionality to recombination events.
However, the sharing of identical HVRs among distinct
complexes with little similarity at the remaining portion
of the protein suggests that recombination is also fairly
common among more divergent proteins. Among
the most common HVRs in the dataset, for example,
peptide HVR1-1 is found in 35 distinct proteins
(46 alleles) spanning six WSP complexes (Table 2); the
average amino acid pairwise divergence among these
proteins, excluding HVR1, is 12.27%, suggestive that
HVR1-1 was acquired in different Wolbachia via recombination. The sharing of the same HVR among otherwise different proteins could also be due to it being an
ancestral conserved motif. To investigate this issue, we
examined synonymous diversity (Pi-syn) of the specific
hypervariable motif across all alleles in which it was present and comparing this to that of CRs for the same set
of alleles (Table 2). On average Pi-syn per hypervariable
motif was significantly lower than the average Pi-syn
values calculated for CRs (average 0.0145 vs.0.0484, Wilcoxon test W+ = 1, W- = 35, N = 8, p < 0.01562). This
argues against the hypothesis that common HVRs found
in diverse WSP proteins are ancestral and supports, in
several cases, their recent shuffling via recombination.

Page 10 of 18

Diversifying selection acting on HVRs

To further investigate whether WSP is target of positive
selection during early stages of diversification, we analyzed the selective pressures acting on a) the overall wsp
sequence during early divergence, and b) single partitions of the gene over longer evolutionary times. For the
first approach we identified the ancestral allele from the
sets of mutant alleles within each complex. In all but
three cases, the ancestor predicted by TCS corresponded
to the protein founder identified by eBURST, confirming
the above prediction (see Table 3). For the three cases
of incongruence, TCS prediction was considered the
most reliable because it is based on nucleotide substitutions. We used the ancestral alleles to assign directionality to the nucleotide substitutions and to investigate
selection on the alleles. For recently diverged alleles,
average dN/dS within complexes ranged from 0.03 to
17.38. The null hypothesis of neutral evolution could
not be significantly rejected for 20 out of 25 complexes
examined (Tajima’D, P > 0.05), indicating that recently
diverged alleles do not typically experience strong selection. To test for positive selection acting at specific sites,
we estimated dN/dS values per codon for 29 complexes
that each contained at least three sequences. Previously
identified allele founders were used for rooting the trees
input into codeml and for analysis of the mutational
pattern during early allele divergence (within complexes). For the majority of the complexes (17 out of
29) the LRTs between the two model comparisons were
not significant. Only five of 29 complexes showed evidence of positive selection at a few sites (see additional
file 3). These positively selected sites mostly fall within
HVR motifs and involved alleles coding for double

appears to be under strong purifying selection, with dN/
dS<<1 (average range across the three CRs is 0.07 0.14). Therefore, when comparing sequences among closely related WSPs (which have only recently diverged)
we find only a weak signature of diversifying selection.
However, when comparing similar HVR variants that
occur in different WSP proteins, we find a strong signature of selection for amino acid substitutions. This finding suggests that those HVR variants that spread via
recombination into different WSP proteins can become
targets of diversifying selection.

In the second approach, we considered HVRs and CRs
individually and identified sets of closely related
sequences within each of the seven sections of WSP,
separately (section borders are shown in Fig. 1A, excluding CR1 that was missing in our alignment). We then
estimated the average dN/dS for each group within single sections and averaged these values across groups.
This global analysis of dN/dS showed that the average
dN/dS values for each HVR is typically >1 (see additional file 4), implying diversifying selection. The exception was HVR3, for which the average falls below 1
(0.73) although several groups of related sequences
within HVR3 showed dN/dS >>1. In contrast, each CR

We finally tested whether protein genotypes are typically
stable over long evolutionary times by investigating the
diversity of nucleotide variants coding for a single protein sequence. The rationale is that, if a particular protein genotype is evolutionarily stable over time, it will
progressively accumulate synonymous substitutions
while discarding amino acid changes. Therefore, the
occurrence and genetic diversity of synonymous variants
should reflect how long a protein type has been around.
The analyses showed that the majority of WSP proteins exist as a single allele variant in our dataset (91%),
with only 8.7% having multiple allele variants (n = 38).
Of these proteins, most had only two variants (n = 27),
while six proteins had at least four allele variants. Interestingly, each of these six proteins corresponded to the
predicted ancestral protein of a complex, confirming
their ancestral status. On average WSP proteins are
coded by 1.19 allele variants, with an average synonymous diversity (Psyn) of 0.27% (Table 4). When compared to any of the five MLST gene datasets, WSP
showed the lowest number of allele variants per protein
variant and values of Psyn among them (Wilcoxon twosample test P < 0.001 for all comparisons, Table 4). Specifically, the average Psyn value among wsp variants is at
least half that of any of the MLST genes. Such a difference is even more striking considering that the WSP
dataset is much larger in terms of allele diversity than
any MLST locus dataset.
Analysis of the polymorphic pattern within groups
containing three or more allele variants per WSP protein type showed, in all cases, that all polymorphisms
are unique to a single allele, (i.e. without homoplasies)
indicating independent evolution through radiation from
the ancestral allele.
Host population structure of WSP

The 515 wsp alleles were found in overall 831 Wolbachia isolates, spanning all major arthropod host taxa
and continents (see additional files 5 and 1 for a summary and for the whole dataset, respectively). Specifically, the 515 were distributed in 23 orders, 126 families,

Average allele synonymous diversity per protein

(100 host genera show at least two distinct species in
our dataset) are, on average, significantly lower than
they would be by random chance (average Pi = 0.1937,
P < 0.000). We further explored this association for individual genera focusing on those that were highly represented in our dataset. Results indicated that within most
of the genera, the WSP sequences were significantly
more similar than expected based on a random sampling (Table 5). Among others, a significant association
was found within Drosophila hosts (43 entries in the
dataset), the spider mites Tetranychus, the wasps Trichogramma and Pegoscapus, and the mosquitos Culex. This
is the result of either the presence of a single wsp allele
across species within a genus, as in the case of Anastrepha, or more often the presence of several wsp alleles
sharing high similarity within a genus, as in the case of
Drosophila, Trichogramma, Tetranychus and Culex.
We also investigated whether there was any evidence
for some wsp sequences and thus potential strains to be
generalist, while others to have a more restricted range
of distribution. We thus looked at the most common
wsp alleles in the dataset and their distribution among

296 genera and 475 species. In terms of variety of wsp
alleles collected, a rarefaction curve indicated that we
are still far from saturation of global diversity of this
gene (see Fig. 5). Fitting the data to a nonlinear function
gave a best fit three-parameter curve that is continually
increasing, but with and asymptotic rate of increase of
approximately 0.74 new allele variants for every 10 additional sequenced strains, signifying that wsp variants in
nature are potentially infinite. The allele and protein
curves almost perfectly overlap (Fig. 5), supporting the
above evidence for shorter persistence of synonymous
variants due to accelerated microevolution of the protein (i.e. a persisting new allele is most likely to give rise
to a new protein haplotype than to a synonymous variant, leading to similar nucleotide and amino acid
diversity).
Based on the global analysis, there is a strong support
for a non-random association of WSP with host genus.
The results suggest that wsp as a gene or associated
Wolbachia strains are preferentially found in similar
hosts. Specifically, the amino acid pairwise distances
among WSP sequences found in the same host genus

Figure 6 Most widespread wsp alleles and relative host taxonomic distribution. Note that some of the most common alleles are predicted
founders of complexes (e.g. wsp-10, 23 and 18). wsp-10 is the most widespread in terms of diversity of host species, genera and families and
corresponds to the ancestral allele of C6 (see also Fig. 3 and Table 3).

hosts (Fig. 6). Among all alleles, wsp-10 was the most
widespread in the dataset, in terms of number of distinct host species (n = 27), genera (23), families (13) and
orders (6) in which it was found. Among the six orders,
wsp-10 is prevalently found in Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. Similarly wsp-23 occurs in 21 distinct species,

11 genera, 11 families, although it is restricted to two
orders, Diptera and Hymenoptera.
Of the 12 most common alleles in Fig. 6, 10 are predicted founders of WSP complexes (Table 3). Because of
the accelerated evolution of this gene, such a broad distribution of a single allele variant appears to be the

Baldo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:48

result of either a recent wsp lateral transfer coding for a
particularly adaptive WSP haplotype or the rapid hostrange expansion of a Wolbachia strain associated to
such wsp sequences, rather than the persistence of an
ancestral genotype.

Discussion
Surface proteins found in intracellular bacteria are
extremely interesting candidates for the study of symbiotic interactions, given their location at the interface
between the bacteria and the host cell environment.
Nevertheless functions and molecular processes driving
their evolution in invertebrate hosts have been poorly
investigated. Only recently, studies are providing examples of how adaptive immune response in insects can be
linked to specific OMP polymorphic variants found in
their bacterial symbionts [54], thus unveiling a largely
underestimated specificity of the invertebrate immunity
[15].
Here we investigated the molecular processes driving
diversification of the outer membrane protein WSP, one
of the most abundant Wolbachia proteins found in Drosophila eggs. Based on protein folding prediction, we
have shown that WSP presents a typical eight b-barrel
structure spanned through the outer membrane and
connected to four extracellular loops. The four loops
face on the same side of the barrel, and presumably
make contact with the host cytoplasm or the vacuole
intermembrane space that envelops Wolbachia. The lack
of strong compositional and conformational constraints
at the loops is consistent with their impressive diversification and putative function as receptors, as shown in
several OMPs [11,13,14]. On the other hand, the large
conservation of the WSP transmembrane core (up to
90% and no indels) likely reflects structural constraints,
providing the architectural anchor of the protein to the
membrane.
Microevolution of WSP is largely driven by recombination

WSP shows the most remarkable pattern of recombination seen among the Wolbachia proteins studied so far
[31]. While recombination involving shuffling of HVR
motifs across WSP sequences has been well documented
and explains the existence of a remarkable repertoire of
WSP protein variants, it remains unclear how this motif
diversity is generated and whether it is functional. Here
we attempted to reconstruct the microevolutionary steps
in WSP early diversification with the aim of uncovering
the major forces at the basis of this variation. The dataset used, which comprises 515 alleles found in more
than 831 isolates spanning a great taxonomical host
range, reflects a substantial sampling diversity of WSP
and allowed grouping of recently diverged WSP proteins
and HVR motifs.

Page 14 of 18

The reconstruction of WSP relationships presents several technical issues that are common to the analysis of
other recombinant OMPs (e.g. the multigene family of
P28 OMPs of Ehrlichia). In particular there are challenges to detecting true homology via straightforward
alignments, due to the high level of sequence and length
variation, and issues relating to correcting for the
recombination bias while attempting to detect and measure selection acting on the molecule [4,55]. Indeed,
most WSP and other OMPs-based studies have
excluded the HVRs to avoid alignment issues, although
this resulted in exclusion of crucial functional domains
of the protein. On the other hand, studies that have
relied on global alignments have faced extreme alignment problems, making assumptions on true homology
difficult or impossible. Here we approached these issues
using a profile-based method for proteins grouping,
which does not base on alignments. This clustering
method allowed the identification of several sets of
recently diverged WSP proteins and their ancestral genotypes, thus providing statistical power to investigate
sequence evolution on relative short-time scales. Specifically, by grouping similar haplotypes at HVRs we were
able to discriminate between amino acid changes introduced by mutational versus recombinational events and
analyze the contribution of the two forces to the actual
protein (thus functional) diversity, and not to allele
diversity. Results indicated that while mutation in WSP
occurred at a higher frequency than recombination, as
expected, recombination has had a remarkable impact
both on the emergence of novel protein types and on
the very rapid increase of genetic diversity among proteins, being responsible alone for about 50% of the total
amino acid variation observed among recently diverged
proteins. Shuffling of WSP portions among more divergent sequences is also frequent, as indicated by the sharing of identical HVRs among otherwise very divergent
alleles. Such a pattern strongly suggests that recombination is ongoing and largely contributed to both the
short- and long-term diversification and evolution of
WSP.
How did this WSP mosaicism generate? A similar pattern of diversification is observed in other OMPs of vertebrate pathogens, such as in Neisseria Opa proteins
[12,56] and MSP2 of Anaplasma [57]. Variability in
these proteins is typically generated via a process of
gene conversion involving modular cassettes of HVR
motifs located in pseudogenes within the same genome
[56,57]. Unlike these proteins, wsp occurs as single copy
in the genome, based on all published Wolbachia genomes and evidence from PCR amplifications using universal wsp primers, which typically return clear single
sequences. We searched for presence of additional single
HVR motifs in the published Wolbachia genomes from

Baldo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:48
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/48

Drosophila melanogaster and Culex pipiens, but failed to
detect any significant homology to full or partial HVR
motifs (data not shown). This suggests that WSP chimeric structure is primarily due to recombination events
involving foreign DNA rather than a modular exchange
of hypervariable regions within a single genome. Modes
of DNA transfer across Wolbachia strains remain
unknown, although the widespread occurrence of coinfections of a single host clearly provides a suitable arena
for DNA exchange.
Loop diversity is adaptive

The predicted four extracellular loops, which accommodate the HVR motifs, show an extreme plasticity and a
mutational pattern that appears largely unpredictable.
Indels, which represent one of the major sources of
diversity among WSP sequences and only occur at
HVRs, were absent among recently diverged proteins (i.
e. in SHVs) but numerous among recombinants, suggesting that they are normally introduced via recombination. Among the four loops, L4 presents the largest
variation, due to both mutation and recombination.
There is no apparent restriction in L4 size, which can
vary by as much as 19 amino acids in length. This loop
versatility does not disrupt the reading frame, which was
always conserved, and thus strongly suggests that this
diversification is adaptive. In contrast, L3 showed the
lowest variation in length (two amino acids difference)
and the lowest dN/dS ratio, which could be due to larger structural constraints or simply to a lower recombination impact. Regardless of length plasticity, it is,
however, interesting to note that all four loops show
similar haplotype diversity (Table 1), with a potential to
accommodate a very large repertoire of distinct peptides.
Nevertheless, some compositional constraints are
expected: 1) AT-biased codons are strongly favored, as
indicated by the high AT content at third (synonymous
only) codon positions of wsp (83%) as well as of Wolbachia housekeeping genes (76%), and 2) amino acid composition should account for a high percentage of
hydrophilic amino acids, given that these sites are extracellularly exposed.
What are the types of selective pressures acting during
the early diversification of WSP? Alleles appear to be
under neutrality during recent divergence, although
we cannot exclude statistical limits in detecting
positive selection in very closely related sequences. A
signature of selection becomes visible with increasing
sequence divergence. HVRs and CRs are clearly evolving
under very different selective pressures, as shown by
average dN/dS values typically >1 for HVRs, and <<1 at
the CRs. Although average dN/dS values for some
HVRs approximate 1, thus suggesting neutrality, we
note that these dN/dS values are averaged across codon

Page 15 of 18

sites, as well as across groups of sequences within single
HVRs. On the other hand, CRs are clear targets of
strong purifying selection, likely due to structural
constraints.
Concordant with a large impact of recombination and
diversifying selection, allele diversity per protein type
indicates that WSP is a highly unstable protein. WSP
shows the lowest number of synonymous variants per
protein type and the lowest synonymous diversity when
compared to any of the five MLST housekeeping genes,
despite the use of a much larger dataset for WSP. This
suggests that any single protein haplotype does not persist for long periods of time and that selection for
amino acid diversification is likely ongoing. Indeed, all
nucleotide substitutions observed among synonymous
allele variants are unique, with no homoplasic events,
supporting their recent and independent divergence.
Similarly, identical HVRs motifs found in distinct proteins typically show a very low synonymous divergence,
which suggests that either they have recombined quite
recently, or more likely that HVR synonymous variants
are particularly unstable after settling into a new allele
and are soon target of nonsynonymous substitutions.
This implies that those HVR variants that spread via
recombination into different WSP proteins can rapidly
become targets of diversifying selection and are thus
adaptive to some extent. Evidence that OMP genetic
diversity can play a crucial role in host-symbiont interaction comes from the native symbiont Sodalis of the
tsetse fly Glossina morsitans, where polymorphisms at
the exposed loop of the outer membrane protein OmpA
were shown to mediate host tolerance, determining the
host/symbiont type of interaction (pathogenic and not)
[54]. We speculate that the extensive variation at WSP
extracellular loops could also play a similar role in
escaping or down-regulating the immune system by
means of rapid turnover of exposed amino acids.
Population structure of WSP

Previous studies have shown that WSP-based relationships are typically incongruent with inferences based on
other Wolbachia housekeeping genes, suggesting that
WSP is often horizontally transferred as a single gene,
uncoupled from the rest of the genome [58]. While the
same or similar wsp alleles can often occur in otherwise
very divergent strains, and therefore reconstructions of
strain relationships based solely on wsp should not be
trusted, on average closely related host taxa tended to
harbor strains with significantly closer WSP sequences
than observed between strains from more phylogenetically distant hosts. This appears the result of a preferential transfer of the entire Wolbachia strain among
closely related hosts (or codivergence of strains) rather
than WSP alone, as supported by previous studies using

Baldo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:48
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/48

MLST data [59,60]. However, because wsp represents
the only genetic information for the majority of isolates
included in this study, the two scenarios cannot be discriminated at this time.
Despite an overall non-random association of WSP
with the host genus, few wsp haplotypes (e.g. wsp-23
and wsp-10) were widespread across a large host taxonomical range. It is noteworthy that wsp-23 and 10
alleles are typically found in two of the most widespread
Wolbachia strains identified by MLST (ST-13 and
ST-19 respectively, [57,61]), suggesting that wsp distribution in this case largely reflects the distribution of
these two Wolbachia strains.

Conclusions
Large recombination impact, diversifying selection, lack
of strong compositional and structural constraints in
WSP extracellular loops, and frequent horizontal gene
transfer are signature features of adaptive evolution.
These features are typically found in proteins targeted
by the adaptive immune system (such as OMPs of vertebrate pathogens) [3,13]; however, Wolbachia infect
invertebrates only. There is growing interest in understanding whether and how Wolbachia escape or downregulate the host immune responses so that they can
exist within host cells. By combining the structural analysis with the microevolutionary analysis of WSP, we
can speculate that the extracellular loops contain
peptide motifs that serve to evade or inhibit host detection, aiding in the early settlement and persistence of
Wolbachia into a new host. Biochemical investigations
exploring binding properties of WSP are currently
ongoing and will help elucidating the role of WSP in
the invertebrate hosts.
