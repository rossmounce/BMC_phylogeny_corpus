Abstract
Background: How gene duplication has influenced the evolution of gene networks is one of the
core problems in evolution. Current duplication-divergence theories generally suggested that
genes on the periphery of the networks were preferentially retained after gene duplication.
However, previous studies were mostly based on gene networks in invertebrate species, and they
had the inherent shortcoming of not being able to provide information on how the duplicationdivergence process proceeded along the time axis during major speciation events.
Results: In this study, we constructed a model system consisting of human G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) and their downstream genes in the GPCR pathways. These two groups of genes
offered a natural partition of genes in the peripheral and the backbone layers of the network.
Analysis of the age distributions of the duplication events in human GPCRs and "downstream
genes" gene families indicated that they both experienced an explosive expansion at the time of
early vertebrate emergence. However, we found only GPCR families saw a continued expansion
after early vertebrates, mostly prominently in several small subfamilies of GPCRs involved in
immune responses and sensory responses.
Conclusion: In general, in the human GPCR model system, we found that the position of a gene
in the gene networks has significant influences on the likelihood of fixation of its duplicates.
However, for a super gene family, the influence was not uniform among subfamilies. For super
families, such as GPCRs, whose gene basis of expression diversity was well established at early
vertebrates, continued expansions were mostly prominent in particular small subfamilies mainly
involved in lineage-specific functions.

Background
Gene duplications at genomic and local levels are believed

to have played important roles in the evolution of vertebrates [1-4]. Waves of gene duplication events were found

to have happened at approximately the time of the emergence of early vertebrates and mammals [2]. Massive gene
duplications would bring great disturbance to the gene
regulatory networks in the cell. How gene duplications
impacted and reshaped the gene networks was still not
well understood. Nevertheless, several recent theoretical
analyses have shed some light on the issue [5-8]. It was
shown that the scale-free properties of the gene networks
were necessary consequences under the assumption of
asymmetric retention of duplicated genes in favor of the
genes in the periphery of the network, which was supported by the family sizes of genes with different connectivity in genetic or protein-protein interaction (PPI)
networks in yeast and worm [5,7].
However, these studies did not provide information as to
how the duplication-divergence process [5] proceeded
along the time axis during major speciation events, such
as the emergence of vertebrates, as their model species
were all invertebrates. Meanwhile, the genetic or PPI networks offered only snapshot information about the relationship between family sizes and connectivity of genes,
which was often found to be inaccurate. Independent evidences not directly based on genetic or PPI networks were
needed for cross examination.
In view of these problems, in this study, we used human
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their downstream genes in the pathways ("downstream genes") as
the model system to examine the impact of gene duplication on the evolution of genes in different layers of the
network. It has been shown that the gene regulatory network roughly maps to the cellular organization, with the
genes on the periphery of the cell maps to the peripheral
layer of the gene network [9]. In this sense, GPCRs and
their "downstream genes" offered a natural partition of
the peripheral layer and the backbone layer of the gene
network. Meanwhile, GPCRs also form one of the largest
known groups of signaling proteins in mammalian
genomes [10], and GPCR pathways cover a good portion
of the gene network and influence a wide range of physiological activities such as neurotransmission, metabolism, secretion, differentiation and growth, learning and
memory, and immune responses [11-13]. The results
from the GPCR model system were thus highly representative of the general gene regulatory network in human
cells.
In this study, we estimated the ages of the duplication
events in human GPCRs and the "downstream genes"
gene families. Comparison of the age distributions of
GPCRs vs. the "downstream genes" provided a more
detailed view of the duplication-divergence process along
the time axis in the context of major speciation events in
vertebrates. Furthermore, GPCRs were partitioned accord-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S1/S14

ing to the GRAFS system [14] into subfamilies, and the age
distributions of major subfamilies of GPCRs were estimated and compared. We also examined the expression
profiles of GPCRs and downstream genes of different
duplication ages, for their contribution to the tissue complexity at different evolutionary stages. In general, we
found that most of the GPCR pathways, which cover a
substantial portion of the gene network, have been established at the time of early vertebrate emergence. Continued expansions in GPCR families were to a large extent
contributed by several small subfamilies involved in
immune responses and sensory responses. Our study of
the GPCR pathways suggested that the position of a gene
in the gene network has great influence on the likelihood
of fixation of its duplicates. However, the influence was
not uniform. Instead, expansion of a large gene family
may be attributed to strong expansions of some particular
subfamilies, when it was favorable in particular species, or
at particular evolutionary stages. The generality of these
principles could be further examined in other super gene
families when the data become available.

Results
Defining the model system of GPCRs and the "downstream
genes"
Our model system of human GPCRs and the "downstream genes" was based on the classical GPCR signal
pathways, which has been summarized in [15]. Typically,
a stimulated GPCR activates one or more types of G proteins (the transducers) which further activate specific
effectors of various downstream pathways. G Proteins are
composed of an α-subunit and a βγ-subunit (heterodimer
stable at physiological conditions). The specificity of the
cellular downstream pathways of GPCRs is largely determined by the type of Gα subunits it binds. There are four
major subfamilies for Gα, including Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11,
and Gα12/13, which define the corresponding GPCRrelated signaling pathways: Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11, G12/13 and Gβγ
pathways. We included the major genes in these pathways
from the summary [15] as the "downstream genes",
including the G proteins but excluding any genes that
were cross-talking receptors or ion-channels on the cell
membrane. The "downstream genes" in the pathways
were summarized in Figure 1. The Gβγ pathway was not
specifically shown as all its downstream genes were covered in the Gi/opathway already. Vertebrate and invertebrate homologues of the human "downstream genes"
were identified and added to the families in order to
reconstruct the phylogenetic trees and estimate of the ages
of the duplication events (see Methods).

We studied the human non-olfactory GPCRs in this study
which were classified based on the GRAFS classification
system [14]. The olfactory GPCRs were not included in
this study, as their evolutionary patterns in mammals was

T3 should satisfy (830-T3)/(T3-430) = d1/d2, where d1
was the distance from T3 to the vertebrate-fly split and d2
was the average distance from T3 to the two subordinate
tetrapod-teleost splits in the linearized tree. Distances d1
and d2 were directly measurable from the linearized tree.
T3 was thus estimated as 487.95 Myrs. The ages of other
duplication events were calculated likewise. The duplication ages of all the GPCRs in our dataset was summarized
in Additional file 1.
For the "downstream genes", the process was essentially
the same. The ages were estimated using the "nearest
neighbor clock" approach as well for each family and were
summarized in Additional file 2.

peculiar [16]. We also excluded 23 human non-olfactory
GPCRs that were not classified by the GRAFS system [14],
11 GPCRs in the delta group of Rhodopsin that were likely
misclassified, and several predicted GPCR genes that were
no longer supported by current genome annotations. In
total, our GPCR data set covered 52 human GPCR families
containing 302 human non-olfactory GPCRs. Vertebrate
and invertebrate homologues of the human GPCRs were
identified and linked to the families (see Methods).
Estimating the duplication ages of human GPCRs and the
"downstream genes"
We estimated the ages of the duplication events of human
GPCRs and "downstream genes" using the "nearest neighbor clock" approach we introduced in a previous work [2].
Briefly, a phylogenetic tree was constructed for each family. The age of a divergence event was estimated based on
its distances to the nearest bracketing species-split times in
the phylogenetic tree under the molecular clock hypothesis [17,18]. Shown in Figure 2 was an example of the process for the Adenosine Receptor A subfamily (ADORA),
which is a subfamily in the alpha group of the Rhodopsin
class. The ADORA subfamily has four human genes and
25 homologous sequences from other species as distant as
fly. We first reconstructed the phylogenetic tree (Neighbor-Joining) based on the protein sequences and calculated the linearized tree [18]. Among the four human
genes in the ADORA family, there were three duplication
events T1–T3 (always one less than the number of human
genes, in bifurcate trees), which were marked in the phylogenetic tree in Figure 2. For T3 as an example, the nearest
bracketing species-split times were 830 Myrs (million
years before present, same below) of the vertebrate-fly
split and 430 Myrs of the tetrapod-teleost split. The age of

Differences in age distribution between GPCRs and the
"downstream genes"
We first compared the age distributions of GPCRs and the
"downstream genes" in general. We focused on the divergence events happened after 1000 Myrs (before present,
same below), as we were mainly interested in the evolution of vertebrates. Single homologues in fly were identified in most of the families, suggesting most of the gene
families emerged early in evolution and stayed in single
copy in the genomes up at least to the fly. As was shown
in Figure 3A, however, both GPCRs and the "downstream
genes" families had an explosive increase in duplication
events which caused strong expansions of the families
during the period of about 400–800 Myrs, peaked at
around 600 Myrs. This was a time close to the emergence
of early vertebrates. This pattern recaptured the general
pattern of human gene families expansion that has been
shown in one of our previous studies [2]. We have suggested that this rapid increase in paralogous genes at the
early stage of vertebrate evolution were likely caused by
genome duplications. However, the age distributions of
GPCRs and the "downstream genes" differed greatly after
400 Myrs. Continued expansion of gene families was only
observed for the GPCRs, while few families of "downstream genes" saw expansion after 400 Myrs. We further
examined the age distributions of GPCRs and their direct
downstream partners, G proteins. As was shown in Figure
3B, the age distributions of G proteins were close to the
"downstream genes" in general, which also saw few duplication events after 400 Myrs. Taken together, we found
that GPCRs families did experience more expansion than
the "downstream genes" in more recent evolutionary
stages when most gene duplications have been shown to
be local small-scale duplication events [2]. However, at
the time of early vertebrate emergence, when large scale
genome duplication happened, both GPCRs and the
"downstream genes" experienced similar explosive expansions.

Figure 2
An example of how the ages of duplication events were estimated in the ADORA family
An example of how the ages of duplication events were estimated in the ADORA family. The neighbor-Joining
phylogenetic tree (A) was constructed based on the protein sequences, and the correspondent linearized tree (B) was also calculated. The protein sequence distances (mutation per amino acid residue) were marked on the graph as the scales. The duplication events, T1–T3, were marked on the trees, and the age of the duplication events were estimated based on the linearized
trees (see Methods).

We further examined the age distribution of duplication
events of different subclasses of GPCRs to see if they contributed equally to the age distribution of GPCRs. Shown
in Figure 3C were the age distributions of the GRAFS subclasses of GPCRs (and the "downstream genes (D)" in a
dashed line as reference). The densities were multiplied by
the number of genes in each class to reflect the differences
in sizes among classes. Different classes of GPCRs contributed differently to the overall distribution of GPCRs. Rhodopsins, which makes up the majority of GPCRs, had a
similar age distribution to GPCRs overall, with the peak
slightly moved right to over 600 Myrs. The Secretin and
Glutamate receptor classes had only an obvious expansion between 400 to 600 Myrs. In contrast, duplication
events in the Adhesion and Frizzled/Taste2 receptor
classes happened more recently and were mostly after 300
Myrs. Actually, the continued expansion of GPCR families
after 400 Myrs were largely contributed by several small
classes such as Adhesion and Frizzled/Taste2 receptors
and the chemokine receptors of the Rhodopsin class (see
Additional file 1 for the actually ages). This result showed
that within the GPCR superfamily, and even within the
Rhodopsin subclass, the expansion of different subfamilies was asymmetric.

In a recent report [19], GPCRs with non-peptide ligands
were reported to have a significantly higher retention rate
than GPCRs with peptide ligands after a lineage-specific
whole genome duplications in the pufferfish Tetraodon
nigroviridis more than 230 Myrs ago. We examined if the
same was true for GPCRs in general. Based on the report
[19], GPCRs that bind non-peptide ligands included
GPCRs in the Glutamate receptor class and A1-A4 subclasses of the Rhodopsin class (see Additional file 1),
while the rest GPCRs bind peptide ligands. As was shown
in Figure 3D, it was obvious that more duplication events
were found among the GPCRs that bind peptide ligands
than those bind non-peptide ligands in more recent evolutionary stages (after 400 Myrs). This was in direct contrast to the results of the lineage-specific GPCRs in
pufferfish by the report [19]. This may have reflected that
the selective pressure driving the fixation of different types
of duplicated GPCRs were different in different species
and at different evolutionary stages. Actually, it was also
shown in Figure 3D that, before 600 Myrs, more duplicated events were observed in GPCRs with non-peptide
ligands than GPCRS with peptide-ligands. This was not
anti-intuitive as many of the ancestor species emerged at
that evolutionary stage were simple marine invertebrates.

vs. G Proteins; C) Between different subclasses of GPCRs (The densities was multiplied by the number of genes in correspondent subclasses to reflect the differences in frequencies); D) GPCRs with peptide-ligands vs. non-peptide ligands.

In general, our results have shown that more duplication
events were found for the GPCRs than the "downstream
genes", particularly in more recent evolutionary stages
when the duplication events were mostly local. This was
consistent with the current theory of gene duplication and
gene network. However, we have found several aspects

that have not been covered in the current theory. First, at
the time of emergence of early vertebrate, both GPCRs and
the "downstream genes" families experienced explosive
expansion. The asymmetric duplication-divergence process may be a good model for gene duplication at normal
times, but more factors were likely to be in play at that

evolutionary stage when massive genomic duplications
and explosive increase in tissues complexity happened.
Second, the expansion of gene families in the peripheral
layer of the gene network may also be asymmetric. Certain
small branches of the big family may get disproportional
expansion in particular species at particular evolutionary
stages, as exemplified by the type 2 taste receptors in
human.
Tissue distribution of GPCRs and the "downstream genes"
of different duplication ages
Duplicated genes often have divergent expression patterns
in tissues. We further examined the expression profiles of
human GPCRs and the "downstream genes" with respect
to their duplication ages. The expression profiles were
based on the EST count information from UniGene [20].
For each human gene in the GPCR model system, we
identified the tissues where it was highly expressed (see
Methods for details). The duplication age of a human
gene was defined as the age of the most recent duplication
event leading to the gene. Due to the approximate nature
of age estimation, we divided the duplication time into
three broad intervals, including earlier than 800 Myrs,
800–400 Myrs and 400-0 Myrs, and focused on the last
two intervals. For genes that duplicated in each of the
intervals, and then for each of the 45 tissues covered by
UniGene, we calculated the number of genes with high
expression in that particular tissue. The result was summarized in Figure 4 for the top tissues in number of highly
expressed genes of the GPCR model system.

Shown in Figure 4A was the result for GPCRs. Genes
duplicated in the 400-0 Myrs interval were denoted as
group 400, and genes duplicated in the 800-400 Myrs
interval were denoted as group 800. The tissues were
ranked by the number of group 400 genes that were
highly expressed in a tissue. Our result showed that
expression of the more recently duplicated genes (group
400) was enriched in blood and spleen, both of which
important tissue for immune response. The chemokine
receptor family contributed greatly to these two tissues.
Enrichment of expression in the connective tissue was also
observed, which was connected to the adhesion receptor
family. On the other hand, group 800 genes were
expressed in a much wider range of tissues. Interesting,
most of the GPCRs expressed in the brain were in group
800. Relatively few GPCR genes expressed in brain or
nerve tissues were recently duplicated.
Shown in Figure 4B was the result for the "downstream
genes". The data series and the ranking of the tissues were
defined the same as in Figure 4A. As has been shown earlier, relatively fewer "downstream genes" were duplication after 400 Myrs, which was reflected in the small
number of genes in group 400 in Figure 4B. Similar to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S1/S14

GPCRs, the "downstream genes" in group 800 were
expressed in a wider range of tissues. Expression in brain
and nerve again was most enriched in group 800.
In general, these results of tissue distribution indicated
that a substantial enrichment of both GPCRs and the
"downstream genes" expressed in brain and nerve tissues
happened during the 800-400 Myrs interval. However,
similar surge were not observed during the 400-0 Myrs
interval. Instead, an enrichment of the GPCRs that
expressed in the immune-related tissues of blood and
spleen were observed, and this again was contributed
mostly by several small GPCRs subfamilies.

Discussion
Current theories of gene duplication and gene networks
suggest that genes on the periphery of the network are
preferentially retained after gene duplication, in comparison to the genes form the backbones of the network. This
is actually necessary for the gene network to remain scalefree after rounds of gene duplication. However, the data
supporting these theories were mostly based on the
genetic network or the PPI network in yeast and worm.
Similar data on gene networks in more advanced species,
including vertebrates, were not yet complete and reliable
enough. Our model system of GPCRs and the "downstream genes", took the advantage of the knowledge that
the gene network roughly maps to the cellular organization [9], offered an opportunity to get some insight into
the relationship of gene duplication and gene network in
the context of vertebrate evolution. Our result showed
that GPCRs families had significantly more continued
expansion after 400 Myrs, in comparison to the "downstream genes". Under the assumption that all genes have
equal opportunities for duplication, this result confirmed
that duplicated GPCR genes were preferentially fixed during the 400-0 Myrs interval, compared to the "downstream genes". However, this preferential retention was
time dependent, as during the 800-400 Myrs interval we
found both GPCR and "downstream gene" families experienced explosive expansion. One explanation for the
result of the 800-400 Myrs interval might be that tissue
complexity of the species might also experience an explosive increase during that interval, which might have
driven fixation of duplicated genes in all the layer of the
network. The expression profiles of the genes with duplication ages in the 800-400 Myrs interval offered partial
support for the explanation, as genes duplicated at that
stage were found to be expressed broadly in a wide range
of tissues in human, including brain and nerve. Our
results suggested that the gene basis of tissue diversity was
largely established by gene duplications in the 800-400
Myrs interval.

There may also be a species-dependence influencing the
preference of fixation of duplicated genes within GPCRs.
This was reflected in the difference in the preference of
retention of GPCRs of peptide ligands vs. non-peptide ligands in human vs. in fish [19]. In fish, the retention rate
of GPCRs of non-peptide ligands was higher than that of
GPCRs of peptide ligands after a whole genome duplication 230 Myrs ago. In contrast, our results showed that,
among human GPCRs, more GPCRs that bind peptide ligands were fixed after 400 Myrs than GPCRs of non-peptide ligands. In human, the subfamilies that contributed
most to the continued expansion of GPCRs after 400 Myrs
were those involved in immune responses and sensory
responses. This may have reflected differences in environmental influences between human and fish on the selective pressure that drove the fixation of GPCR duplicates.
In this study, we have kept the model system simple by
including only the downstream genes in the classical
GPCR pathways. Many other genes that were indirectly
influenced by GPCRs were not included in the study,
which are mostly kinases and transcription factors in the
signaling pathways. However, one of our previous studies
[21] on the human tyrosin kinase super family found similar patterns with the "downstream genes".

Conclusion
In general, using the human GPCR model system, our
results confirmed that the position of a gene in the gene
networks has great influences on the likelihood of expansion of its gene family in evolution. However, we also
found that the influence was asymmetric among subfamilies of GPCRs. We found that the gene basis of expression diversity of most GPCR pathways, which cover a
substantial portion of the gene network, have been established at the time of early vertebrate emergence. Continued expansions in human GPCR families were to a large
extent contributed by several small subfamilies involved
in immune responses and sensory responses in human.
Exactly which subfamilies may see extra expansion may be
contingent on environmental factors for different species
at different evolutionary stages, as was exemplified by our
comparison of the differences in retention preference of
GPCRs binding peptide or non-peptide ligands between
humans and fishes.
In the future, we shall further investigate the association
between gene family expansions and GPCR-related networks [22-27]. For instance, we may study the functional
divergence between the duplicated GPCR-related proteins
[22,23], the role of alternative splicing isoforms [24], as
well as the tissue-specific effects [25,26] on the gene evolution. Recently, Gu [27] proposed an evolutionary model
for the origin of modularity in a complex gene network,
suggesting that new (protein-protein) interactions after

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S1/S14

the gene duplication may be favored to link preexisted
backbone of signaling pathway, while loss of interactions
are at random. The vertebrate GPCR networks may be an
ideal model to study the design principle of signaling networks.

Materials and methods
Family and sequence data
The GPCR gene families analyzed in this study were classified based on the GRAFS classification system [14],
which covers 342 human non-olfactory GPCRs in five
major classes including Glutamate (15), Rhodopsin
(241), Adhesion (24), Frizzled/taste2 (24), Secretin (15).
The Rhodopsin class is further divided into four groups:
alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The sequences of vertebrate
GPCR genes were retrieved from the Hovergen database
[28]. In cases where the GRAFS families were further split
in Hovergen, the split families were used for age estimation separately. The invertebrate homologues, as well as
some vertebrate homologues missed by Hovergen, were
identified by extensive BLAST [29] searching of the Swissprot protein database [30]. Redundant sequences were
removed either based on UniGene annotations when
available, or based on chromosome positions otherwise.

The "downstream genes" families were constructed similarly. Families were constructed for each entry in Figure 1.
The vertebrate homologues in the gene families were
retrieved from Hovergen [28], the invertebrate homologues and the vertebrate homolgues missed by Hovergen
were identified by homology searching in the Swiss-prot
database. Redundant sequences were removed similarly
as for GPCRs.
Inference of duplication events and estimating their ages
In bifurcate trees, each new human homologue is created
by a duplication event. As a result, for a gene family with
n human genes, there will be n-1 duplication events. We
used the "nearest-neighbor clock" approach [2] to date
the duplication events. For a gene family, we first reconstructed the phylogenetic tree. We used Clustal W [31] to
carry out multiple sequence alignment of the protein
sequences of the genes in the family. Phylogenetic trees
(Neighbour-joining) were reconstructed using the MEGA
program [32]. Linearized trees [18] were also calculated
using MEGA. Next, the age of a duplication event was estimated based on its distances to the nearest bracketing species-split times in the phylogenetic tree under the
molecular clock hypothesis [17,18]. We used the widely
accepted species split times for calibration, including primate-rodent (80 Myrs ago), mammal-bird (310 Myrs
ago), mammal-amphibian (350 Myr ago), tetrapod-teleost (430 Myr ago) and vertebrate-fly splits (830 Myr ago)
[33]. In cases that a bracketing pair of species-split times
can be found for a duplication event, the age of the event

was just the linear interpolation based on the distances of
the event in the linearized tree to the species-split times.
In cases that no bracketing species-split times can be
found for a duplication event (usually for very ancient or
recent duplication events), linear extrapolation was used
to calculate the age.

Expression profiles of human genes by UniGene
We used the EST counts in UniGene [20] as the expression
profiles of the human genes in the tissues. The ratio of the
number of EST clones of a gene vs. the total number of
clone in the library in a tissue was treated as the expression
level of the gene in the tissues. For each gene, we calculated its mean expression level and the standard deviation
across the 45 tissues covered in UniGene. The distribution
of the expression levels of a gene across species generally
fit a gamma distribution with small mean and large variation. We defined a gene highly expressed in a tissue if its
expression level was one standard deviation greater than
the mean expression level.
