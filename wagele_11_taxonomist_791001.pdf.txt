The taxonomist - an endangered race. A practical
proposal for its survival

Abstract
Background: Taxonomy or biological systematics is the basic scientific discipline of biology, postulating
hypotheses of identity and relationships, on which all other natural sciences dealing with organisms relies.
However, the scientific contributions of taxonomists have been largely neglected when using species names in
scientific publications by not citing the authority on which they are based.
Discussion: Consequences of this neglect is reduced recognition of the importance of taxonomy, which in turn
results in diminished funding, lower interest from journals in publishing taxonomic research, and a reduced
number of young scientists entering the field. This has lead to the so-called taxonomic impediment at a time
when biodiversity studies are of critical importance.
Here we emphasize a practical and obvious solution to this dilemma. We propose that whenever a species name is
used, the author(s) of the species hypothesis be included and the original literature source cited, including
taxonomic revisions and identification literature - nothing more than what is done for every other hypothesis or
assumption included in a scientific publication. In addition, we postulate that journals primarily publishing
taxonomic studies should be indexed in ISISM.
Summary: The proposal outlined above would make visible the true contribution of taxonomists within the
scientific community, and would provide a more accurate assessment for funding agencies impact and importance
of taxonomy, and help in the recruitment of young scientists into the field, thus helping to alleviate the taxonomic
impediment. In addition, it would also make much of the biological literature more robust by reducing or
alleviating taxonomic uncertainty.
Keywords: Taxonomy crisis, taxonomic impediment, impact factor, original species description, citation index,
systematics

Background
Taxonomy or biological systematics is the science of discovering, describing, classifying and naming organisms
[1]. It dates from Aristotle, and thus is the oldest discipline in biology. It forms the basis for all other scientific
disciplines dealing with the study of life, its structure,
function and evolution. Taxonomic knowledge is paramount whether studying whole organisms, their organs,
their specific bio-molecules or biochemical pathways.
Unambiguously identified organisms in the sense of

referenced, unique taxonomy are essential to all biological studies, because they are a prerequisite to enable the
confirmation or refutation of any scientific study that
reports on these taxa or their components. Only if a
species’ identity is unambiguous, can the study be considered robust enough to discuss species-specific traits
or attributes with colleagues or convey them to the
scientific community and general public. Identification
of a species utilized in a study impacts all subsequent
comparisons, predictions, and possible replication of the
study. It might be argued that the identification of the
study organism is irrelevant when examining basic processes such as membrane transport mechanisms, photosynthetic cycles in plants, etc. However, this is not the

case as many pathways of physiological processes are
adapted in the organism to the specific environmental
conditions and this must be taken into consideration
whenever conclusions are generalized beyond the study
organism. For example, the eubacterium Thermus aquaticus Brock & Freeze, 1969 [2] is restricted to hot
springs and is the only species known (and famous for)
possessing the Taq-Polymerase [3]. In addition, medical
studies reporting on the leech Hirudo medicinalis Linnaeus, 1758 [4] have been shown to have actually studied several distinct yet morphologically cryptic leech
species [5,6]. Given the importance of this species in
neurobiology and the study of anticoagulants, it is critical that workers associate leech identifications with a
referenced, unique taxonomy rather than use a non-specific, general species name. The identification of the species is the first step in almost any biological or related
study.
In many cases species identifications are difficult, and
it is not surprising that a staggering number of species
remain undescribed [7-10]. Add to this the scarcity of
knowledgeable taxonomists [11] (particularly in third
world and developing countries [12]), often referred to
as the “taxonomic impediment” [1,13-16], and it is
understandable why certain biological disciplines have
chosen “taxonomy-free” research subjects. In particular,
many biodiversity and ecological research programs pursue directions that do not require estimates of the actual
(alpha) diversity of ecosystems. Instead proxies such as
biomass production, measurements of evaporation, CO2
storage, functional groups, or the focusing on a few
selected and well-known taxonomic groups (such as
“birds”, “bats”, or “trees’) are substitute for measurements of alpha biodiversity [17]. In addition, funding to
include alpha diversity studies across a wide variety of
groups making up the community or occurring in the
habitat is seldom allocated or made available.
Taxonomy is the discipline in biology where scientists assign to taxa unique identities, and these
research products are subsequently used by others to
identify further individuals that can be used with confidence by colleagues in other scientific disciplines.
Many of these other disciplines often include investigations of smaller components of diversity, such as proteins and genes and larger cell components, but they
also include population studies, habitat characterization, environmental monitoring and systemic modelling; investigations that include all types of organisms,
from bacteria and protists to vertebrates and plants the entire Tree of Life. The potential consequences of
flawed taxonomy leading to error-cascades affecting
scientific hypotheses and ideas are commonly underestimated or ignored, but may have serious ecological
and economic implications [18].

The availability of species identifications for life
science studies is often taken for granted. Currently,
about 1.7 Mio metazoan species have been described
and it is assumed that tenfold as many species inhabit
our world [8,10,19,20] (but see Castello et al. 2011[21]).
Studies of biodiversity are critical [10] and have been
mandated by many countries where conservation and
sustainable use of natural resources have become matters of scientific and public concern [22-24]. Taxonomy
is fundamentally important in ensuring the quality of
life of future human generations on the planet.

Discussion
There is no question that taxonomists provide insights
into alpha biodiversity, provide names for communication, and are at the forefront documenting the biological
richness of our planet. Consequently, they must be
recognized for their contributions and should be considered an important resource within biology and the associated life science, as well as by the general public.
Moreover, journals and other publication media that
convey this taxonomic knowledge should be considered
as valuable as journals dedicated to other scientific subjects and findings. However, today we are faced with
exactly the opposite scenario. Despite the increasing
importance of taxonomists in today’s biodiversity crisis,
most taxonomists are faced with decreasing funding, as
well as editorial resistance to publishing their work in
the high impact journals that will secure tenure and
promotion and allow them to continue their work and
contributions [18,25,26].
Taxonomists are often looked upon by colleagues as
bureaucratic accountants and their research programs
are not recognized as the intellectually challenging and
hypotheses-driven science that it has become [27-29].
Today’s taxonomist must have a thorough knowledge of
the literature, of theoretical species concepts, phylogenetic and analytical methodology, the application of various phenotypic visualization techniques (e.g., anatomy,
histology, fine-structure, imaging, 3-D reconstruction),
molecular staining, as well as molecular markers for
everything from barcoding to genomics. When taxonomic hypotheses are implemented as published
descriptions they are subject to future revisions (i.e.,
replication) with the possibility of either confirmation or
rejection just as any other scientific hypothesis [29]. All
this notwithstanding, the work done by the species’
author(s) is rarely accredited [26,30,31]. Sometimes the
author’s name is included with the scientific name, but
this citation is rarely included in the publication’s references or literature cited. The genetic model organisms
Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, 1830 [32] and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. [33], for instance, are among
the most prominent species cited in scientific

We compared hit results of online queries for species names used in publications listed by Google scholar and ISISM web of knowledge and those publications

We have altered the abbreviated botanical format of the original author into the zoological format, which provides the author name in full length with the year
of publication.
* Citations refer to the different spellings of the author’s name (i.e., Linné, von Linné, and Linnaeus) and the entire tenth edition.
** Citations refer to the whole series “Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien (...)”, which was published between 1887 and 1909 in numerous volumes.

publications (about 352.000 and 232.000 citations,
respectively). In sharp contrast, the original scientific
descriptions of both these species are cited 0 and 19
times, respectively. Other frequently studied and prominent examples, including more recently described species, are presented in Table 1.
Subsequent taxonomic revisions that consolidate taxa
(i.e., synonymization) or split species into different subclades are also usually neglected. Out of the 2270 citations found on Hirudo medicinalis in Google scholar for
the year 2010, only 41 mentioned the presence of cryptic species and former misidentifications of H. medicinalis and H. verbena Carena, 1820 [34]. Hence, more than
95% of the analyses published in 2010 that explicitly
dealt with H. medicinalis (covering a broad array of subjects, like genomes, proteomes, gene syntheses, medical
novelties, etc.) cannot be clearly assigned to this species,
nor to either of the two undescribed species within the
H. medicinalis species complex [5,6], nor to the frequently misidentified H. verbena. Citing the original
publication in which the cryptic species problem had
been unravelled would have immediately demonstrated
the authors’ awareness of this problem and its potential
consequences, and would have increased confidence in
the author’s publication.
Recently, several declarations and suggestions have
been published in favour of taxonomy, including arguments for more funding, better education, or recruiting
parataxonomists and amateurs [11,16,35]. While these
appeals are certainly justified, they will not be effective
as long as the work of taxonomists is neglected or
viewed as unimportant and self-evident (and therefore
not worthy of citation) by colleagues in other natural
science disciplines. We therefore here emphasize the
need for a fair practice mentioned by Werner in 2006
[30] and Seifert et al. in 2008 [36] that would help to
recognize the value of taxonomic work and thus to
place taxonomy back into mainstream biology and provide a measure of its impact. This accurate accounting
of the value of taxonomic studies will also provide familiar metrics for colleagues and administrators, and will be
invaluable in the allocation of funding and the long term
recruitment of young taxonomists. We therefore

propose the following guidelines:
1. Any study based on a formally named organism
should include the citation of the original author(s)
and date. We acknowledge that this is already practiced in many, but by no means all journals. In addition, this citation must be included in the literature
cited - a practice that is currently extremely rare
(e.g., Persoonia; Phytotaxa; Blumea; Organisms,
Diversity & Evolution [37], European Journal of Taxonomy) or not obligatory, but encouraged (e.g.,
Zootaxa).
2. All published taxonomic sources (monographs,
identification keys, primary taxonomic literature and
revisions) used for identification or as a source of
nomenclatural information (e.g., catalogues) should
be cited as any other methodological paper would
be. The lack of these citations precludes an assessment of quality and reliability of the identification(s)
and associated taxonomic information. Thus, independent verification of results and conclusions - the
fundament of science - is not possible.
3. Researchers are encouraged to include taxonomists as co-authors when they have made substantial
contributions to the research program or where the
conclusions of the paper are solely dependent on the
accurate identification of the study taxon.
One of the leading journals in ecology, Ecology Letters, follows the proposed guidelines, with the exception
of well-established species such as Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758 [38], Drosophila melanogaster and Escherichia coli (Migula, 1895) [39]. A most recent suggestion
[40] dealt with a solution for special citation of taxonomic work when used in wiki pages by combining
both the original non-wiki source and the respective
wiki page.
It might be argued that publications that are based on
studies of multiple species, such as large phylogenetic
analyses of an entire metazoan or plant group (e.g., a
phylogenetic analysis of beetles) or monitoring projects,
might lead to an inflation of certain citations or journals
[30,37]. However, this is no different than the long lists

Wägele et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:25
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/25

of GenBank entries for sequences or alignments that
have come to dominate our publications and associated
supplementary materials. Also, arguments that it is difficult to deal with the older literature are becoming
increasingly obsolete as the number of online taxonomic
databases (e.g., BHL, EoL, Gallica, AnimalBase, and
others) rapidly increases. Authors working on projects
involving large species data sets would also be more
likely to seek out taxonomists for assistance with subsequent co-authorship - already a common practice for
bioinformatical or mathematical problems in phylogenetic or statistical analyses. This will increase communication and collaboration as well as the accuracy and
usefulness of the vetted work.
It might also be argued that citing old literature is not
necessary and that taxonomic hypotheses should be
handled as in other disciplines: these hypotheses become
“general knowledge” and no longer require citation, such
as the seminal discoveries of natural selection published
by Wallace in 1855 [41] and Darwin in 1859 [42], or of
plate tectonics published by Wegener in 1912 [43].
However, as was shown with the example of Hirudo
medicinalis, even “well-established” species can become
imprecise, and refined hypotheses with new species
names must be formulated. Especially in the time of
molecular analyses, we can expect many more surprises
with broad implications for various fields, including
human welfare. The recent findings [44] of unknown
subgroups within the Anopheles gambiae Giles, 1902
[45] complex [46] that exhibit a high susceptibility to
infection with wild Plasmodium falciparum (Welch,
1897) [47] must be cited in future analyses to acknowledge one’s awareness of sympatric species with different
ecological and behavioral strategies within the same
strains. The finding of cryptic species in spitting cobras
[48], as well as the rearrangement of the large species
complex of the Asian pitvipers into distinct genera [49]
has a direct implication on categorization of their medical importance, as well as antivenin indication, prescription and research [50]. Results like these are not
restricted to small and cryptic living species but also
comprise large animals such as turtles, monitor lizards,
antelopes or bovids [51-53] with direct implications on
conservation biology and related fields [53,54]. Hence it
is more important than ever to include all means used
for identification, so that the authors’ awareness of taxonomic problems that can potentially confound their
study, including species concepts applied [10], is obvious
to the readers of their published results.
In addition, we would encourage all taxonomists, who
are in one way or another responsible for journal
administration to ensure that their publications are
indexed by ISISM. Based on the situation in molluscan
literature (pers. comm. P. Mikkelsen), we assume that

Page 5 of 7

more than 90 percent of all taxonomic journals are not
indexed so that the overwhelming numbers of taxonomic citations are simply not counted. The inclusion
in the ISISM data base will increase the awareness of the
journal and guarantee a more accurate calculation of
journal and author citation metrics. We estimate that
indexing half of all taxonomic journals available today
would increase citation indices (CIs) fivefold.

Summary
Taxonomic work has profound implications for all kinds
of scientific disciplines. Previous attempts of a few colleagues to encourage citation policies concerning taxonomic descriptions [30,36] have been largely ignored.
Therefore, we once again emphatically appeal to colleagues and editors of journals for a much broader
acknowledgement of the scientific work of taxonomists.
The citation protocol as outlined above would give fair
credit and recognition to those scientists who have dedicated their research careers to unveiling the earth’s biodiversity and to the journals who have specialized in
reporting these results. Currently, neither is recognized
for their important contributions irrespective of their
geographical location [1]. In addition, citation of species
and taxon authorities will validate the taxonomic names
used in scientific studies and will increase the robustness and usefulness of their results.
We are well aware of the severe shortcomings and weaknesses of CIs in systematics and taxonomy [16,26,55-57].
However, we cannot ignore the system and its impact;
instead we should fully participate to ensure fair and accurate representation of our colleagues and journals. The
citation protocol outlined above will require little additional investment by researchers and editors, but would be
an important acknowledgement of the vital contributions
of taxonomists and hopefully increase the survival rate of
this endangered group of scientists.
