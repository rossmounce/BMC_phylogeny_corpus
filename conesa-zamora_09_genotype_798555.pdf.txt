Abstract
Background: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution and co-infection occurrence
was studied in cervical cytologic specimens from Murcia Region, (southeast Spain), to obtain
information regarding the possible effect of the ongoing vaccination campaign against HPV16 and
HPV18.
Methods: A total of 458 cytologic specimens were obtained from two outpatient gynecological
clinics. These included 288 normal benign (N/B) specimens, 56 atypical squamous cell of
undetermined significance (ASC-US), 75 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and 39
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). HPV genotyping was performed using PCR and
tube array hybridization.
Results: The most frequent genotype found was HPV16 (14.9% in N/B; 17.9% in ASC-US; 29.3%
in LSIL and 33.3% HSIL). Distribution of other genotypes was heavily dependent on the cytologic
diagnoses. Co-infections were found in 15.3% of N/B, 10.7% of ASC-US, 48% of LSIL and 25.6% of
HSIL cases (significantly different at p < 0.001). Strikingly, in N/B diagnoses, genotypes from A5
species were found as coinfecting in all cases. Genotypes from A7 or A9 species appeared in coinfections in 56.5% and 54% respectively whereas genotypes from A6 species appeared in 25.1% of
cases.
Conclusion: HPV vaccination might prevent 34.6% and 35.8% of LSIL and HSIL, respectively. Coinfection rate is dependent on both cytologic diagnosis and HPV genotype. Moreover, genotypes
belonging to A5, A7 and A9 species are more often found as co-infections than genotype pertaining
to A6 species. This suggests that phylogenetically related genotypes might have in common similar
grades of dependency for cervical epithelium colonization.

Background
It is well established that human papilloma virus (HPV) is
necessary to develop cervical cancer [1]. There are more
than one hundred HPV genotypes that can be phylogenetically ordered in several genus, species and types according to sequence similarity [2,3]. Importantly, several HPVs
are known because they have strong oncogenic potential
and are classified as high-risk HPVs [4]. Amongst the highrisk genotypes, HPV16 and 18 account for nearly 70% of
cervical cancer cases worldwide [5,6]. In a substantial percentage of HPV infections, ranging from 20–30%, and
depending on the HPV typing assay used, two or more different HPV genotypes may be found [7-10]. These coinfections seem to have a higher rate of occurrence than
expected by chance [10,11] suggesting a synergy amongst
the coinfecting HPV genotypes. However, whether certain
types of HPV are more or less likely to be acquired
together still remains unknown [11].
In order to prevent cervical carcinoma, two types of prophylactic vaccines have been developed: a bivalent vaccine against the high-risk HPV16 and 18 [12], and a
tetravalent vaccine against HPV16/18, and HPV 6/11 two
low-risk genotypes that are prevalently responsible for
genital warts [13]. Both are based on virus-like particles
containing L1 capsid protein of HPV [14].
The HPV genotypes found in different regions of the
world vary both in type and relative incidence. There is
also evidence of the prevalence of specific variants of
defined genotypes in certain ethnic groups [15-17]. In
fact, some HPV variants correlate with human migration
flows [18], suggesting a degree of genotype fixation in certain populations. Therefore, the HPV vaccines could have
an impact on the particular HPV genotype distribution of
the region where the campaign is going to be launched.
Several studies have demonstrated that these vaccines
seem to protect against genotypes different from HPV16,
18, 6 and 11 [12,19-21], but the clinical relevance remains
to be determined. As well as the presumed cross-protection effect, the decreasing prevalence of the genotypes
included in the HPV vaccine may affect the prevalence of
other coinfecting genotypes due to the possible interplay
between them in the cervical epithelium. As suggested by
Woodman et al. if different HPV genotypes compete to
colonize the cervical epithelium the prevalence of the genotypes not targeted by the vaccines could increase, changing the genotype-associated risks [14]. These arguments
suggest that the impact of the vaccine could vary depending on the distribution of regional HPV types and the
coinfecting genotype patterns. The aim of the present
work is to assess the local prevalence of HPV genotypes as
single-type infection or as co-infection in female patients
followed-up because of abnormal Pap smears as a starting

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/124

point to understand the evolution of HPV types when vaccination becomes a mainstream health policy.
The Region of Murcia, located in the southeast of Spain,
has a population of 1.4 millon and is currently divided
into five administrative health areas. In the last ten years,
a high influx of immigrants from northern Africa and
Latin America has caused population increase of nearly
ten percent. Regional health authorities have launched a
campaign in 2008 to vaccinate all young females (aged 11
to 14 years old) against HPV16 and HPV18, thus making
the Region of Murcia a good model system to study the
effect of vaccination in HPV-related diseases.

Methods
Samples
Four hundred and fifty eight cytologic consecutive specimens collected from November 2006 to April 2009 were
included in this study. Cytologic specimens correspond to
single patients (median age 38 (SD = 10.0); range 19 to
68) referred to the outpatient gynecological clinics of Hospital Universitario Santa María del Rosell (HUSMR) and
Hospital Rafael Méndez (HRM) because of previous
abnormal Pap smears. These two hospitals provide
healthcare to a population of about 535.000 individuals
(38.1% of population of Murcia Region). The incidence of
cervical cancer in Murcia region is 9/100,000. Smears were
stained with Papanicolaou stain. A second sample was
taken by gynecologists either with cotton swab or with
cytobrush and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS for immediate DNA extraction and HPV genotyping. Papanicolaou
smears were reviewed by a pathologist trained in gynecologic pathology (SOR). The cytologic diagnoses of the
cases included in this study were as follows: 288 normal
or benign (N/B) cytologic diagnoses, 56 cases with atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 75 cases with low-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesions (LSIL), 39 cases with high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Informed consent was not
required for this study since the results presented here
come from HPV genotyping routinely performed as an
adjunct to Pap smears in pathology department. In any
case all identifiers were deleted in order to protect patient
confidentiality. The study was approved by the local ethical board.
Viral genotype determination
DNA extraction was performed from all samples using
Maxwell 16 Cell DNA Purification Kit (#AS1020 Promega,
Madison, USA) and Maxwell 16 automated DNA extraction station (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the
instruction manual. Average DNA concentration in these
samples was 60 ng/μl. Genotyping was performed with
Clart HPV 2 kit (ClonDiag, Jena, Germany) [22,23].

Amplification of L1 conserved region was performed
using biotin-labeled primers, and amplicons were denaturalized and hybridized on a low-density tube array containing HPV type-specific probes. HPV types genotyped
with the kit included high-risk (HR) genotypes 16, 18, 31,
33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73 and 82; low-risk
(LR) genotypes 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 66, 70, 72, 81
and 89 and genotypes with probable high-risk (PHR) 20,
53 and 66. This kit is CE labelled and has been validated
in several studies [22,24]. Its analytical sensitivity is
between 10–103 viral copies and diagnostic sensitivity and
specificity for each genotype were 98.2% and 100%,
respectively. A hybridization positive control containing
biotin, a CFRT human gene internal control and HPV negative and positive controls were included in each run.
Genotypes were classified according to their cervical carcinoma associated risk as high, low and probable high-risk
as reported by Muñoz et al [25]. The most frequent genotypes found in N/B cases were grouped in HPV species for
co-infection analysis according to the phylogenetic classification proposed by de Villiers et al. [2]. A5 (HPV51 and
82), A6 (HPV53, 66 and 56), A7 (HPV18, 39, 45 and 68)
and A9 (HPV16, 58, 31, 52, 33 and 35).
Statistical analysis
HPV genotype distribution analysis was performed using
SPSS.14.0 (Chicago, IL). χ2 was used to evaluate statistical
significance between grade of lesion (normal/benign,
ASC-US, LSIL and HSIL) and HPV genotypes found in the
study.

Results
Cytologic diagnoses and HPV presence
HPV genotyping was successfully achieved in all samples.
The percentage of samples positive for an HPV infection

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/124

increased with the severity of the lesion, from N/B
(49.7%) to LSIL (82.7%) and HSIL (87.2%) (p < 0.0001)
(Table 1). The occurrence of low versus high-risk HPV
genotypes also differed between the distinct diagnoses (p
< 0.05; Table 1).
HPV genotype distribution changes in cytologic diagnoses
The specific HPV genotypes changed depending on cytologic diagnoses (Figure 1). Independently of the diagnoses performed, HPV16 was the most frequent genotype.
The most frequent genotypes in N/B cases were HPV16
(14.9%), HPV53 (6.6%), low-risk HPV6 (6.6%) and
HPV58 (5.2%). In ASC-US the distribution was HPV16
(17.9%), HPV31 (4.5%) and three genotypes i.e HPV 18,
52 and 53 were detected in 5.2% to 5.4% of this lesion. In
LSIL specimens HPV16, 51, 31 and HPV33 were observed
in 29.3%, 14.7%, 12% and 12% of cases, respectively.
Finally, in HSIL HPV distribution was HPV16 (33.3%),
HPV45 (12.9%) and HPV51 (10.3%). HPV16 prevalence
was significantly associated with increased grade of lesion
(p < 0.005)
Genotypes found as co-infections
Significant differences in percentage of co-infection occurrence were found depending on cytologic diagnoses
(Table 2) (p < 0.0001). Most co-infections consisted of
two different genotypes, although in three samples up to
seven different genotypes were found (one in N/B and
two in LSIL; Table 2). The percentages of co-infections
encompassing most frequent genotypes found in N/B
cases are listed in table 3. Using the phylogenetic classification for HPV species we observed that in N/B specimens
HPV genotypes belonging to the A5 family (HPV51 and
82) were always present as co-infections. This percentage
was still high for A7 and A9 species where co-infection
percentages were 56.5% and 54% respectively (Figure 2).

Discussion
In the present study we have found an HPV detection rate
of 49.7% in N/B cases, 53.6% in ASCUS, 82.7% in LSIL
and 87.2% in HSIL. The N/B percentage is considerably
higher than that found in other studies with Spanish general population [26]. The reason for this finding might be
due to the fact that the specimens of our study come from
a group of females who attended an outpatient gynecologic clinic in the course of follow-up of healed or persistent cervical pathology. The assessment of HPV genotype
in relation to ab initio cytologic diagnoses is beyond the
scope of our study. The overall percentage (68.3%) of
HPV positivity is within the range of positivity found in a
Spanish study using linear arrays for genotyping in cytologic specimens from an outpatient gynecologic clinic
(49.5%) [7,27]. The percentage of HPV positivity in HSIL
found in our work (87.2%) is rather similar to that
(90.8%) reported by Gonzalez-Bosquet et al. in a Spanish
cohort of females with CIN2 and CIN3, the histologic
counterparts of HSIL [7].
There are some similarities in the HPV genotype distribution found in N/B cases from the cohort studied compared to that reported by Gomez-Roman et al. which
genotyped cytologic specimens from a cohort of females
from northern Spain attending an outpatient gynecologic
clinic; most frequent genotypes encountered were HPV16,
53 and 58. In our study HPV53 was also found to be the
second most common genotype and HPV58 the third
most prevalent high-risk genotype. HPV53, although considered as low-risk [28] or as probable high-risk genotype
by others [25] does not seem to belong to the most prevalent HPV types reported worldwide in cervical specimens
[25] though in some Italian studies HPV53 was found as
the second (2.7%) and the fifth (3.6%) most prevalent
genotype in the general female population and in females
with abnormal smears [29,30]. In the study by Ortiz et al.

HPV53 was found to be amongst the six most common
genotypes in the general population from Madrid and Alicante [26] suggesting a higher prevalence of this genotype
both in Spain and Italy. The combination of amplification
and hybridization used in our study for all samples may
overcome the lack of sensitivity of HPV53 detection found
in other studies in which amplification with GP5+/6+
primers has been used as screening for HPV positive samples. This system has been shown to under-represent
HPV53 as reported by Clifford et al. and Qu et al. [31,32].
Another reason for HPV53 under-representation in other
studies is that HPV53 is detected but not genotyped due to
lack of specific genotype probes when using the Hybrid
Capture II current high-risk probe cocktail [33].
HPV58 seems to be most frequently found than HPV18 in
N/B cases. A similar finding is reported elsewhere in other
regions of Spain [29,34]. This considerable high prevalence of HPV58 in N/B cases from our region is particularly relevant since, as preliminary results by the
PATRICIA study group have revealed that, unlike genotypes 31, 33, 52, vaccination against HPV16 and 18 does
not seem to cross-protect against HPV58 [12]. This genotype is not as frequently found as in similar cohorts of
females from Italy and France [29,30,35].
In LSIL cases HPV51 and HPV53 were, along with HPV31
and 33, the most frequent genotypes detected after
HPV16. Other studies from Spain and France have also
reported a high prevalence of HPV51 and 53 in LSIL cases
[7,34].
In our study the most common genotypes found in HSIL
were HPV16, 45, 51, 33 and 31. HPV16, 51, 33 and 31 are
amongst the five most frequent genotypes found in HSIL
specimens in previous studies from Spain and France
[7,36]. Surprisingly, HPV45 is the second most common
genotype in our HSIL cases, whilst its prevalence is lower
in N/B and LSIL cases. The aforementioned studies did
not find HPV45 to be one of the most prevalent types in
HSIL though this type has been associated with this
lesion. Though a possible overestimation of this genotype
might have occurred due to the limited number of HSIL,
HPV45 have been associated with HSIL in several studies
[37].
As seen in Figure 1 HPV16 prevalence is increasing with
the grade of lesion (p < 0.005). This finding underlines
the higher oncogenic potential of HPV16 genotype compared to the other frequent genotypes found in our study
such as 58, 31, 33 and 45. In fact, according to the seminal
epidemiologic study by Muñoz et al., women infected
with HPV16 have 434.5 fold higher risk to develop squamous cervical cancer than women HPV-negative. This risk
decreases to 373.5, 248.1, 200.0, 197.6, 123.6, 114.8,
66.5, 45.1 and 4.3 for the genotypes 33, 18, 52, 45, 31, 58,

from N/B cases (3%) to ASC-US (10%) and to LSIL (23%)
and a decreased frequency from LSIL to HSIL (7%) [8].
General lower prevalence of co-infection in the latter
study might be due to the fact that the population
included had not been selected for any type of gynaecologic pathology. The percentage of both HPV positivity
and co-infection found in ASC-US suggests an HPV profile
more similar to N/B than LSIL.

51, 56 and 6 respectively [25]. It is also worth mentioning
that based on our data 34.6% of LSIL and 35.8% of HSIL
would be prevented by HPV vaccination. However, these
lesions would not necessary lead to invasive cervical cancer and the real impact of these vaccines will have to be
evaluated in the future by the reduction of HPV16 and
HPV18 cases in terms of incidence and mortality. The
hypothetical protection provided by HPV vaccination in
our region would be similar to that reported by GonzálezBosquet et al. in Barcelona. However these estimations do
not consider a possible cross-protection effect that may
enhance the vaccine effectiveness [7].
In our work the presence of co-infection was observed in
15.3% of N/B cases, 10.7% of ASC-US, 48.0% of LSIL and
25.6% of HSIL. These differences in co-infection occurrence are statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Rousseau et
al. also reported an increased frequency of co-infection

Our results suggest that LSIL may constitute a permissive
state where the presence of certain genotypes as HPV16
may pave the way for other more co-infection-dependent
genotypes, but as the lesion progresses only highly oncogenic types (i.e. HPV16) may persist whereas less oncogenic genotypes (i.e. HPV58, HPV53 and HPV6) are
cleared off.
The greater number of coinfecting genotypes associated
with their lower frequency suggests that the acquisition of
two genotypes do not favour subsequent HPV types acquisition. According to our data it seems that genotypes from
certain species (A5, A7, A9) appear as coinfecting more
frequently than genotypes from other species (A6). This
finding might indicate that there are different grades of
dependency for each genotype or species to colonize cervical epithelium. The strength of the association and
whether this probable dependency is intra or interspecies
must be clarified in further studies. To the best of our
knowledge this observation has not been previously
reported. These results give support to the theory that the
elimination of certain genotypes by vaccination may
affect the distribution of other genotypes.
Therefore, based on our results we hypothesize that the
reason why HPV vaccine does not show cross-protection
against HPV58 as shown in the PATRICIA study [12] may
perhaps be caused by its lack of co-infection dependency,
whilst vaccine does show this cross-protection effect
against other genotypes from the same A9 species
(HPV31, 33, 52) which are more frequently found as
coinfecting. It is worth mentioning that results from
PATRICIA study concerning cross-protection aspects are

Conclusion
In this study we show that coinfecting genotype distribution and its prevalence in different grade of lesions suggests probable genotype interplay in the cervical
epithelium. Simultaneous synergy or competing relationship amongst them cannot be ruled out. Therefore the
vaccination-driven elimination of one HPV type would
affect the natural history of the rest of genotypes and subsequently that of cervical carcinoma and would reinforce
the necessity of a constant survey of genotypes in any geographical area where the HPV vaccination campaign is
being implemented.
