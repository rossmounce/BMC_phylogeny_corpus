Abstract
Background: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be degraded by many microorganisms using
intra- or extracellular PHA depolymerases. PHA depolymerases are very diverse in sequence and
substrate specificity, but share a common α/β-hydrolase fold and a catalytic triad, which is also
found in other α/β-hydrolases.
Results: The PHA Depolymerase Engineering Database (DED, http://www.ded.uni-stuttgart.de)
has been established as a tool for systematic analysis of this enzyme family. The DED contains
sequence entries of 587 PHA depolymerases, which were assigned to 8 superfamilies and 38
homologous families based on their sequence similarity. For each family, multiple sequence
alignments and profile hidden Markov models are provided, and functionally relevant residues are
annotated.
Conclusion: The DED is a valuable tool which can be applied to identify new PHA depolymerase
sequences from complete genomes in silico, to classify PHA depolymerases, to predict their
biochemical properties, and to design enzyme variants with improved properties.

Background
In the past decade, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) gained
industrial interest as biodegradable substitutes for nondegradable plastics. While poly (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid
(PHB) is the most widely studied and the best characterized PHA, a wide variety of PHAs with differences in flexibility and thermostability have been described. Many
bacteria accumulate PHAs as storage compounds of carbon and energy [1-3]. PHAs have been assigned to two

classes, depending on the number of carbon atoms of the
monomers: short chain length PHAs (PHASCL) with 3 to 5
carbon atoms per monomer and medium chain length
PHAs (PHAMCL) with 6 to 15 carbon atoms per monomer.
PHAs are degraded by intracellular and extracellular PHA
depolymerases. Intracellular PHA depolymerases hydrolyze an endogenous carbon reservoir, the native PHA
granules, consisting of the polymer with a surface layer of
proteins and phospholipids. Extracellular PHA

depolymerases degrade denatured extracellular granules
which are partially crystalline and are lacking a surface
layer [4,5]. Thus, depending on their substrate and its
physical state, PHA depolymerases are grouped generally
into four families: PHA depolymerases degrading the
native intracellular granules (nPHAMCL depolymerases
and nPHASCL depolymerases) and PHA depolymerases
degrading the denatured extracellular PHA granules
(dPHAMCL depolymerases and dPHASCL depolymerases).
One exception of this classification is an extracellular
nPHASCL depolymerase from Paucimonas lemoignei which
is active only against native PHA granules [6]. Additionally periplasmatic PHA depolymerases exist, as a PHA
depolymerase from Rhodospirillum rubrum has been
described recently to be located in the periplasm [7].
PHA depolymerases are carboxylesterases and belong to
the α/β-hydrolase fold family [5].
As member of the α/β-hydrolase fold, two families including PHA depolymerases have also been described in the
Pfam proteins families database [8]: the family of Esterase
PHB depolymerases (Pfam accession code: PF10503) and
the family describing the C-terminus of bacterial PHB
depolymerases (Pfam accession code: PF06850).
With exception of a few intracellular nPHASCL depolymerases, all PHA depolymerases have a catalytic triad (serine –
histidine – aspartic acid) as active site. The catalytic serine is
embedded in a GxSxG sequence motif (known as 'lipase
box') as found in other α/β-hydrolases. Additionally, a conserved non-catalytic histidine near the oxyanion hole is
found analogous to lipases [5,9]. The best studied PHA
depolymerases are dPHASCL depolymerases. They share a
common domain architecture consisting of a short signal
peptide, a catalytic domain (including the lipase box and
the oxyanion hole), a short linker domain, and a substrate
binding domain [10]. Depending on the location of the
lipase box on sequence level relative to the oxyanion hole,
two types of catalytic domains are known. Within the
sequences of type 1 catalytic domains, the oxyanion hole
can be found N-terminal to the lipase box, similar to
lipases. Within the sequences of type 2 catalytic domains,
the oxyanion hole is found C-terminal to the catalytic triad.
In contrast to dPHASCL depolymerases, dPHAMCL
depolymerases possess no substrate binding domain. In
these enzymes, the N-terminal region of the catalytic
domain is assumed to function as substrate binding site [5].
The PHA depolymerase from Rhodospirillum rubrum which
is described to be located in the periplasm [7] is a special
case, as it has a catalytic domain similar to extracellular
PHA depolymerases with a catalytic domain type 2.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/89

intracellular nPHASCL depolymerases have no lipase box,
but have a catalytic triad consisting of cysteine, histidine,
and aspartic acid. One member of this family is the
nPHASCL depolymerase of Ralstonia eutropha [11].
Only about 30 PHA depolymerases with experimentally
validated PHA depolymerase activity have been described
so far. The factors which mediate the capability of
depolymerases to degrade PHAs with high specificity are
not yet understood. Although the sequence similarity of
PHA depolymerases to other known α/β-hydrolases like
lipases and esterases is low and substrate specificity differs
considerably, they belong to the same fold family and possess a highly conserved active site. From a systematic comparison of the PHA depolymerase family to other α/βhydrolases, depolymerase-specific motifs can be derived.
However, a data resource is still lacking which integrates
sequence and structure information and provides tools for
a systematic analysis of the sequence-structure-function
relationship of PHA depolymerases. Therefore, the PHA
Depolymerase Engineering Database (DED, http://
www.ded.uni-stuttgart.de) has been designed to assist a
comprehensive analysis of sequences, the annotation of
new sequences and the design of mutants. For the analysis
of lipases and esterases, the Lipase Engineering Database
(LED, http://www.led.uni-stuttgart.de) has previously been
established and applied [12,13]. Comparison of the rules
derived from the LED to the DED will help to understand
differences of PHA depolymerases and other α/β-hydrolases, and will relate experimentally observed properties of
PHA depolymerases to their sequence.

Construction and content
To establish the PHA Depolymerase Engineering Database, the data warehouse system DWARF [14] has been
applied. The DWARF system provides an automated
retrieval tool to extract information on sequence, structure, or function from different source databases into a
local data warehouse system. As a first step, 28 seed
sequences of proteins with experimentally validated
depolymerase activity (Table 1[15-33]) were stored in the
database and annotated. These seed sequences were
assigned to 6 previously described superfamilies based on
their function [34]. Additionally the families of intracellular nPHASCL depolymerases (lipase box), of which one
family member has recently been described [35], and the
family of periplasmatic PHA depolymerases including the
PHA depolymerase from Rhodospirillum rubrum [7] were
introduced. Thus, a total of 8 superfamilies were introduced:
▪ intracellular nPHASCL depolymerases (no lipase box)
▪ intracellular nPHASCL depolymerases (lipase box)

For intracellular nPHA depolymerases no particular substrate binding domain has been described so far. A few

▪ intracellular nPHAMCL depolymerases

in the GenBank [36]. This was done by performing a
BLAST search [37] of each seed sequence in the database
against the selected sequence pool derived from the GenBank. As a final population step, BLAST searches against
the non-redundant sequence database at NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov were performed for each sequence
with an E-value cut-off of E = 10-50 to populate the database with more sequences. Superfamilies were subdivided
into homologous families, which were introduced based
on sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1).
New protein entries were assigned to homologous families and superfamilies by their sequence similarity.

which originate from the same source organism, were

assigned to a single protein entry. In case of multiple
sequence entries for one protein, the longest sequence was
set as reference sequence. For protein entries with available structure information, structural monomers were
downloaded from the Protein Data Bank [38] and stored
as structure entries. Secondary structure information was
calculated applying the program DSSP [39] and displayed
in the annotated multiple sequence alignments which are
generated using ClustalW (v1.83) with default parameters
[40]. Annotation information on structurally or functionally relevant residues (active site, disulfide bridges, signal
peptide) was extracted from the NCBI entries and annotated in the DED. Information on experimentally validated depolymerases was manually added. Residues of
the lipase box and the catalytic triad were manually annotated, which enables an easy identification of these residues for almost all PHA depolymerases based on multiple
sequence alignments.
The PHA Depolymerase Engineering Database consists of
735 sequence entries which code for 587 different proteins. The proteins have been assigned to 8 superfamilies
and 38 homologous families. The largest PHA depolymerase families are the intracellular nPHASCL depolymerases
(no lipase box) and the extracellular dPHASCL depolymerases (catalytic domain type 1) with 224 and 234 protein
entries, respectively, and account for 38% and 39% of all
protein entries. Only one member of the family of periplasmatic PHA depolymerases was found, the PHA
depolymerase of Rhodospirillum rubrum. For the families of
extracellular dPHASCL depolymerases (catalytic domain
type 2) and the family of extracellular nPHASCL
depolymerases, structure information is available. Interestingly, two proteins from Cupriavidus taiwanensis and
Ralstonia eutropha H16 which are annotated as "intracellular PHA depolymerase" in the GenBank were assigned to
the family of extracellular dPHASCL depolymerases (catalytic domain type 1) due to their sequence similarity (gi:
194292521, gi:74267419 [41]). The latter is reported to
be highly active against artificial amorphous PHB granules, and is lacking a signal peptide, a linker domain, and
a substrate binding domain. Another exception is the PHA
depolymerase from Pseudomonas sp. which is annotated as
"extracellular PHA depolymerase" in the GenBank but
was assigned to the family of intracellular nPHAMCL
depolymerases in the DED (gi:34452171).

Utility and discussion
The DWARF system is an integrative bioinformatics tool
to build up protein family databases into a local data
warehouse system. The DWARF system has previously
been successfully applied to build up the Lipase Engineering Database [12,13], the Cytochrome P450 Engineering
Database http://www.cyped.uni-stuttgart.de[42], and the
Medium-Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Engineering

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/89

Database http://www.mdred.uni-stuttgart.de[43]. A local
data warehouse has the advantage of a common and consistent data structure which enables systematic analysis of
complete protein families. The DED is the first data source
that integrates information on sequence, structure, and
function of PHA depolymerases in a systematic and consistent format.
Web accessibility
The database can be browsed on the level of sequence,
structure, or organism. All protein entries are linked to the
respective NCBI entries. Annotated multiple sequence
alignments and phylogenetic trees that are visualized
applying the program PHYLODENDRON http://
iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/molbio/java/apps are provided via the online accessible version of the DED at http:/
/www.ded.uni-stuttgart.de. For each family, information
of amino acid conservation is given as calculated by
PLOTCON [44]. For each homologous family and superfamily, family-specific profile hidden Markov models
were calculated by the HMMER program http://
hmmer.janelia.org/ to assist the classification of new PHA
depolymerase sequences and the identification of new
PHA depolymerase sequences from complete genomes in
silico. A local BLAST interface is available to perform a
BLAST search against the DED. A new dynamic user interface was developed which enables fast and easy integration of updated versions of the DED. The DED will be
regularly updated by an automated script. For new
sequence entries referring to a new structure in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB), structure information is updated as
well. New sequence and structure entries are classified
into the homologous families and superfamilies based on
their sequence identity.
Analysis
All PHA depolymerases in the DED possess a lipase box
around the catalytic serine with a Gx1Sx2G sequence motif
with the exception of the family of intracellular nPHASCL
depolymerases (no lipase box), which possess a catalytic
cysteine instead of the lipase box. For particular PHA
depolymerases it has been previously described that a
hydrophobic residue is found at position x1 within the
Gx1Sx2G motif [4,9,45]. This seems to be a common feature of almost all PHA depolymerases as seen from a systematic analysis of the DED family multiple sequence
alignments. Thus, compared to other α/β-hydrolases like
lipases and esterases, where a polar residue is most frequently found at position x1, this conserved residue of the
Gx1Sx2G motif might be relevant to differentiate between
lipases or esterases and PHA depolymerases on sequence
level. This hydrophobic residue is solvent exposed and
located near the catalytic serine at the bottom of a deep
cleft, as seen in the structure of the PHB depolymerase
from Penicillium funiculosum (PDB entry 2D80) [46] (Fig.

Page 5 of 8

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:89

2). The hydrophobic residue at position x1 is tryptophan
and isoleucine for the families of intracellular nPHASCL
depolymerases (lipase box) and periplasmatic PHA
depolymerases, respectively. For the family of intracellular
nPHAMCL depolymerases, the residue at position x1 is
valine for almost all proteins. Although not possessing a
lipase box, but utilizing a catalytic cysteine, all family
members of the family of intracellular nPHASCL
depolymerases (no lipase box) also have a hydrophobic
residue (almost all valine) at position cysteine-1. While
the hydrophobic residue at position x1 differs among the
families of intracellular PHA depolymerases, leucine and
isoleucine are the most frequent residues at this position
for extracellular PHA depolymerases. While all proteins of
the family of extracellular dPHASCL depolymerases (catalytic domain type 2) possess a hydrophobic residue at
position x1, only 81% of the proteins of the family of
extracellular dPHASCL depolymerases (catalytic domain
type 1) have a hydrophobic residue at position x1. All
extracellular dPHAMCL depolymerases have an isoleucine
at position x1. One exception is the family of extracellular
nPHASCL depolymerases, which neither possess a typical
Gx1Sx2G motif nor has a hydrophobic residue a position
x1. In this family, the Gx1Sx2G motif is altered to a
AHSMG motif which can also be found in the family of
Bacillus lipases (homologous family abH18.01 in the
LED, http://www.led.uni-stuttgart.de). One family member of this special family is the PHB depolymerase from
Paucimonas lemoignei, for which also structure information
is available (PDB entry: 2VTV) [6,47]. This PHB

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/89

depolymerase has also special biochemical properties, as
it is an extracellular nPHASCL depolymerase degrading
native granules, and is the only experimentally validated
extracellular PHASCL depolymerase not having a substrate
binding domain. Within lipases and esterases, a polar residue is typically found at position x1. However, a few
exception also exist among lipases and esterases, such as
the of Candida antarctica lipase like family (homologous
family abH37 in the LED) and the family of Bacillus carboxylesterases (abH11.1).

Conclusion
The PHA Depolymerase Engineering Database (DED) has
been designed to serve as a navigation and analysis tool of
PHA depolymerases. It serves as a platform to analyze
sequence-structure-function relationships and to classify
new sequences by providing multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, and family-specific profiles.
The DED hence provides a valuable source of information
to investigate the family of PHA depolymerases in a systematic way, to identify new proteins from genomes, and
to distinguish between PHA depolymerases and lipases.
Thus, it paves the way for a deeper understanding of biochemical properties of PHA depolymerases and to design
PHA depolymerases with improved properties.

Availability and requirements
The PHA Depolymerase Engineering Database (DED) is
online accessible at http://www.ded.uni-stuttgart.de. All
information on families of sequence and structure data, as
well as alignments, phylogenetic trees, and family-specific
profiles can be accessed by manual download.
