Abstract
Background: The kelch motif is an ancient and evolutionarily-widespread sequence motif of 44–
56 amino acids in length. It occurs as five to seven repeats that form a β-propeller tertiary
structure. Over 28 kelch-repeat proteins have been sequenced and functionally characterised from
diverse organisms spanning from viruses, plants and fungi to mammals and it is evident from
expressed sequence tag, domain and genome databases that many additional hypothetical proteins
contain kelch-repeats. In general, kelch-repeat β-propellers are involved in protein-protein
interactions, however the modest sequence identity between kelch motifs, the diversity of domain
architectures, and the partial information on this protein family in any single species, all present
difficulties to developing a coherent view of the kelch-repeat domain and the kelch-repeat protein
superfamily. To understand the complexity of this superfamily of proteins, we have analysed by
bioinformatics the complement of kelch-repeat proteins encoded in the human genome and have
made comparisons to the kelch-repeat proteins encoded in other sequenced genomes.
Results: We identified 71 kelch-repeat proteins encoded in the human genome, whereas 5 or 8
members were identified in yeasts and around 18 in C. elegans, D. melanogaster and A. gambiae.
Multiple domain architectures were identified in each organism, including previously unrecognised
forms. The vast majority of kelch-repeat domains are predicted to form six-bladed β-propellers.
The most prevalent domain architecture in the metazoan animal genomes studied was the BTB/
kelch domain organisation and we uncovered 3 subgroups of human BTB/kelch proteins. Sequence
analysis of the kelch-repeat domains of the most robustly-related subgroups identified differences
in β-propeller organisation that could provide direction for experimental study of protein-binding
characteristics.
Conclusion: The kelch-repeat superfamily constitutes a distinct and evolutionarily-widespread
family of β-propeller domain-containing proteins. Expansion of the family during the evolution of
multicellular animals is mainly accounted for by a major expansion of the BTB/kelch domain
architecture. BTB/kelch proteins constitute 72 % of the kelch-repeat superfamily of H. sapiens and
form three subgroups, one of which appears the most-conserved during evolution. Distinctions in
propeller blade organisation between subgroups 1 and 2 were identified that could provide new
direction for biochemical and functional studies of novel kelch-repeat proteins.

Background
The kelch motif is an ancient and evolutionarily-widespread sequence motif of 44–56 amino acids in length.
Eight residues within the motif are highly-conserved and
constitute a consensus sequence [1–3] (Fig. 1A). Kelch
motifs occur as groups of five to seven repeats and have
been identified in proteins of otherwise distinct molecular
architecture, termed the kelch-repeat superfamily. Currently, over 28 kelch-repeat proteins have been sequenced
and functionally characterised in diverse organisms
including viruses, plants, fungi and mammals [3]. Several
kelch repeat-containing proteins have been recognised in
Bacteria and Archaea (GenBank NP_713516, NP_639451
and Pfam01344 species distribution link), revealing the
universal nature of the repeats. On the basis of the crystal
structure determined for a single kelch-repeat protein,
Hypomyces rosellus galactose oxidase (PDB 1GOF), the sets
of repeated kelch motifs are predicated to form a β-propeller structure [2,4].
The β-propeller is a widespread and universal protein
domain fold, as revealed from crystal structures of diverse
proteins [5–7]. Many unrelated primary sequences can
adopt the stereotypical topology of a β-propeller; however, several sequence repeat motifs have been identified
in relation to known crystal structures that are predictors
of propeller domains. These include the WD motif, the
regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) motif
and the tachylectin-2 repeat, as well as the kelch motif
[3,5–9]. Each "blade" of a β-propeller structure is formed
from a four-stranded antiparallel twisted β-sheet fold, in
which each β-sheet packs onto the adjoining sheets
through hydrophobic contacts (Fig. 1B). Four to eight of
these β-sheet modules are radially arranged around a central axis to form the β-propeller domain, with the twist of
the β-sheets within each module producing the propellerblade appearance (Fig. 1C). Intra- and inter-blade loops of
varying lengths protrude above, below, or at the sides of
the β-sheets and contribute variability to the binding
properties of individual β-propellers [3,5,6] (Fig. 1B). The
whole structure is closed and stabilised by interactions
between the first and last blades. In the four-bladed β-propellers of hemopexin and collagenase this is achieved by
disulphide bonding between the first and last blades
[10,11]. In the other examples for which there is crystal
structural information, the last blade of the β-propeller is
assembled as a composite from sequences at the aminoand carboxy-terminal ends of the domain, that are held
together by hydrogen bonds [3,5,6,9] (example of galactose oxidase shown in Fig. 1C).
Kelch-repeat β-propellers undergo a variety of binding
interactions with other molecules. Several kelch proteins,
including D. melanogaster kelch and mammalian IPP,
bind and cross-link F-actin through the β-propeller

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/42

domain [12,13]. In contrast, the kelch repeats of other
proteins, such as gigaxonin, Keap1, or recombinationactivating gene 2, (RAG-2), have unique binding partner
proteins [14–16] and the β-propeller of fungal galactose
oxidase corresponds to the catalytic domain of the
enzyme [2,4]. The kelch-repeat β-propeller is thus considered to form a general protein-protein interaction module
that associates with diverse and specific binding partners
[3]. Several kelch-repeat proteins contain other protein
domains, of particular note being the Broad-Complex,
Tramtrack, and Bric-a-Brac/Poxvirus and Zincfinger (BTB/
POZ) domain (CDD6184, Pfam 00651, SMART0225)
[1,3,17]. The BTB/POZ domain was first identified as a
dimerisation domain of transcription factors and also
mediates homodimerisation of kelch and other BTB/kelch
domain proteins [10,17,18].
As summarised above, the current view of the kelch-repeat
superfamily has been compiled from studies of individual
kelch-repeat proteins from diverse organisms. The extent
and complexity of the kelch-repeat family within an individual species is unknown. An overview of this domain
family would be of value in order to make a rational
assignment of structural subgroups and to develop a
coherent perspective on the evolution of this protein
domain between modern organisms. A clear view of
kelch-repeat proteins could also open up new possibilities
for sequence analysis, prediction and experimental analysis of structure/function relationships, and a greater
understanding of the specific properties of kelch-repeat
proteins within the large β-propeller fold group. In modern life sciences, such molecular information provides a
fundamental context for well-targeted biochemical and
biological studies of individual proteins. Building on the
availability of complete genome sequence information
for H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and A. thaliana we have addressed these
questions through database mining and bioinformatic
sequence analyses.

Results
Identification and characterisation of kelch-repeat
proteins encoded in the human genome
To identify the kelch-repeat proteins encoded in the
human genome, BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches of the
human genome predicted protein database were carried
out with the kelch-motif consensus (CDD543,
Pfam01344, SMART 00612) as a query sequence. This
search identified 57 kelch-repeat proteins and hypothetical proteins. We noted that several of the known human
kelch-repeat proteins [3] were not identified by this
method, probably because there are relatively few consensus residues in each kelch motif, none of which is completely invariant across all examples of the motif, and also
because of variation in the lengths of the loops between

The kelch motif and the β-propeller fold. A, Consensus sequence of the kelch motif. Compiled from [2] and [3]. The
sequence motif is shown in relation to the four β-sheets of a propeller blade structure, as determined for the kelch motifs of
fungal galactose oxidase [4]. In the consensus, G= glycine, Y = tyrosine, W = tryptophan, s = small residue; l = large residue; h
= hydrophobic residue. B, Structure of a kelch-repeat propeller blade. A single blade from the crystal structure of fungal galactose oxidase (1GOF) is shown. β sheets 1–4 are colored as in panel A. The N- and C-termini join to adjacent blades. As indicated by the mapping of the consensus amino acids onto the blade, the most highly-conserved residues are located in the βsheets. In various examples of β-propeller proteins, the intra- and inter-blade loops have variable sequences and contribute to
protein-protein interactions [3]. C, Structure of the kelch-repeat β-propeller domain of fungal galactose oxidase (1GOF). βsheets 1–4 in each blade are colored as in panel A. As indicated, this β-propeller contains seven blades. The β-4 strand of blade

the β-strands [2,3,6]. Therefore further searches were
made with the kelch-repeats of all 28 known superfamily
members, as described in the Methods. These searches
identified 18 additional kelch-repeat proteins encoded in
the human genome. Cross referencing all 75 entries
against GenBank identified 9 of the entries as partial
sequences and/or duplicate entries for the same protein or

hypothetical ORF, and two of the entries as non-kelch
containing proteins. We also cross-referenced the search
results to the domain entries for kelch in the Pfam [19]
and SMART [20] domain databases. Many entries were
listed in both SMART and Pfam, however a number of the
proteins we had identified were not listed in these databases (indicated in Table 1), even though when we

kelch motifs were clearly identified. Furthermore, the
numbers of kelch repeat proteins assigned to H. sapiens in
the Species tree or Taxbreak links of Pfam and SMART
were over-estimated because of inclusion of incomplete
ORFs and multiple entries for the same polypeptide. We
also carried out additional searches of GenBank with single kelch motifs from the 28 known kelch-repeat proteins
that were distinctly longer than the CDD kelch-motif consensus, in order to search more extensively for proteins
containing more divergent repeats. From these multiple
evaluations and with exclusion of partial sequences (as
described in the Methods), we identified at least 71 kelchrepeat proteins encoded in the human genome (Table 1).

fication of kelch motifs. The number of kelch motifs
identified varied from two to seven. Four blades is the
minumum number that has been documented from crystal structures of β-propeller domains [5,6,8,9]. Thus, it
appeared unlikely that entries encoding two or three kelch
motifs corresponded to complete ORFs and these were
excluded from further analysis (entries NP-689579,
XP_209285, XP_058629). On this basis, 12.7 % (9/71) of
sequences were predicted to contain five-bladed β-propellers, 84.5 % (60/71) to be six-bladed, and 2.8 % (2/71) to
contain seven-bladed β-propellers (Table 1). To our
knowledge, only one seven-bladed kelch repeat protein
has been identified previously, fungal galactose oxidase
[2,4].

To determine the number of repeated kelch motifs in each

C-terminal sequence repeat and the β-four strand provided by sequence amino-terminal to the first full
sequence repeat, a mechanism referred to as "N-terminal
β-strand closure" [3,4], (Fig. 1C). We examined the the
human kelch-repeat proteins by secondary structure prediction of β-sheets and by manual analysis of the
sequence repeats, and found that for 77.5 % (55/71) of
the proteins the β-propeller structure was predicted to be
closed by a C-terminal β-strand. For five sequences, no
clear prediction could be made (Table 1).
Chromosomal localisation of Human kelch-repeat
proteins
The encoding sequences for human kelch-repeat proteins
are dispersed throughout the genome, being located on all
chromosomes except chromosome 21 and the Y chromosome (Table 1). Several instances of genes in physical
proximity were noticed, for example NP_006460 and
NP_067646 at 1q31.3 and NP_569713 and NP_060114
at 3q27.3 (Table 1). However, in the majority of cases
these did not correspond to the most closely-related protein sequences as would be expected for recently-duplicated genes. One exception was NP_055130 and NP751943 which were located at 14q21.3 and which were
the most closely-related to each other (46 % identity).
Overall, there was no evidence for physical grouping of
kelch-protein encoding sequences within the human
genome. In contrast, genes encoding the numerous F-box/
kelch proteins of A. thaliana are clustered such that some
of the most highly-related sequences are encoded from
physically close genomic locations [21,22].
Domain Architecture of Human Kelch-repeat proteins
Twenty-eight kelch-repeat proteins from various organisms were previously grouped into 5 structural categories
according to the positioning of the kelch repeats within
the polypeptide sequence and the presence of other conserved structural domains [3]. To evaluate the complexity
of domain architectures within a single organism, each
human kelch-repeat protein sequence was re-analysed by
searching against CDD, SMART and Pfam and then subgrouped according to domain architecture.

Strikingly, 72 % (51/71) of the human kelch-repeat proteins contained a BTB/POZ domain. In all but one of the
proteins, the BTB domain was amino-terminal to the
kelch domain (Table 1). This hypothetical protein, LZTR1, contained two tandem BTB domains. Four (5.6%)
kelch-repeat proteins contained a single additional conserved domain. Muskelin was the only kelch-repeat protein identified in the human genome to contain a
discoidin domain (CDD 7753, Pfam 00231, SMART
00231, also known as F5/F8 type C domain) (Prag, Collett
and Adams, in preparation). The discoidin domain acts as
a protein-protein interaction domain in a number of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/42

extracellular and intracellular proteins and, in clotting factors V and VIII, mediates phospholipid binding [23].
Another kelch-protein, XP_048774, contained a F-box
domain (CDD9197, Pfam 00646). The F-box is a domain
of about forty residues, first identified in cyclin A, that
interacts with Skp1 to anchor proteins to the ubiquitinligase assembly for ubiquitination and targeting to proteosome-mediated degradation [24]. The combination of Fbox and kelch-repeat domains has previously been
described in A. thaliana, where at least 67 F-box/kelch proteins and hypothetical proteins are encoded in the
genome [21,22]. Several of these function in lightdependent regulation of the circadian clock, but the function of many others is obscure [21,22,25]. To our knowledge, this is the first recognition of a F-box/kelch protein
in an animal genome. One predicted kelch-repeat protein,
NP_055608, contained a leucine carboxyl methyltansferase (LCM) domain (CDD9631, Pfam 04072) with 34%
identity to the LCM domain of protein phosphatase 2 leucine carboxyl methyltransferase [26]. Recombination-activating gene-2 (RAG-2) contains a plant homeodomain
(PHD) finger domain (Pfam00628) at the carboxy-terminus [16].
Six kelch-repeat proteins (11 %) were very large, multidomain proteins (Table 1). Attractin/mahogany (that are
splice variants from a single gene; 27–29) and MEGF8 are
each over 1000 amino acids long and contained a CUBdomain, kelch repeats, a C-type lectin domain and EGFlike domains. Diverse functions have been attributed to
attractin and mahogany that include a role in T-cell interactions (attractin, the secreted splice variant) [27] and
obesity regulation in mice (mahogany, the transmembrane splice variant) [28,29]. Host cell factor-1 and -2
(HCF-1 and HCF-2) are also large proteins which contain
amino-terminal kelch-repeats, two fibronectin type III
domains and, in the case of HCF-1, a series of unique HCF
repeats. These proteins function as transcriptional coactivators of herpes simplex virus immediate early gene
expression [30,31].
We identified three hypothetical kelch-repeat proteins as
containing unrelated unique sequences that did not correspond to recognised structural domains, positioned either
amino- or carboxy-terminal to the kelch repeats (Table 1).
Rab9 effector p40 [32] and six other kelch-repeat proteins
were short polypeptides, from 350–442 amino acids in
length, that consisted almost entirely of kelch repeats
(Table 1). Five of these proteins or hypothetical proteins,
including p40, contained six sequence repeats and thus
are predicted to form six-bladed β-propellers. Two hypothetical proteins, NP_060673 and XP_114323, consisted
of putative seven-bladed β-propellers. Together, these
structural distinctions form the basis for the novel

Relationships between human BTB/kelch proteins
Relationships between human BTB/kelch proteins. The amino acid sequences of the 38 full-length human BTB/kelch
proteins predicted to contain six-bladed β-propellers were aligned in CLUSTALW and are presented in Phylip Drawgram for
A) full-length sequences; B) kelch-repeat domains only; C) BTB domains only, with shade codes for the three identified subgroups as indicated. Asterisk in panel A indicate known actin-binding BTB/kelch proteins. Panel B shows the robust grouping of
a set of sequences from subgroup 2, termed subgroup 2A.

categorisation of human kelch-repeat proteins that is presented here (Table 1).
Structural relationships of human BTB/kelch proteins
The unexpectedly large number of BTB/kelch proteins
encoded in the human genome prompted us to study this
group in more detail, with the aim of identifying structural subgroups that might also represent functional subsets. The 38 full-length sequences that contained single
BTB domains and predicted six-bladed β-propellers were
aligned according to sequence similarity in CLUSTALW
and viewed as neighbourhood-joining trees. Alignment of
the full-length sequences revealed three subgroups of
approximately equal size, which we termed subgroups 1
to 3 (Fig. 2A). When the same analysis was performed
with the kelch domains alone, the same grouping was
apparent for subgroup 1 and a substantial proportion of
subgroup 2, termed subgroup 2A (Fig. 2B). In an alignment of the BTB domains only, subgroups 1 and 2 were
maintained for the majority of sequences (Fig. 2C).

Unrooted trees produced by a separate method for alignment based on maximum parsimony analysis of
sequences, PROTPARS, did not support subgroup 3 but
consistently demonstrated the relationship of the
sequences in subgroups 1 and 2A (data not shown). We
focused on these robustly-related kelch-repeat sequences
in subgroups 1 and 2A, for a closer analysis of the kelchrepeat domains.
CLUSTALW multiple sequence alignment of the kelchrepeat domains from each of subgroups 1 and 2A demonstrated distinctive features in terms of repeat organisation.
In both subgroups (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4), the intrablade loop
between β-strands 2 and 3 (the 2–3 loop, Fig. 5A) and the
interblade 4–1 loop were major sources of variation
within the repeats with regard to their length and primary
structure. In the context of an intact β-propeller domain,
the 1–2 and 3–4 loops protrude above one face of the βsheets and the 2–3 loop protrudes from the opposite face
(Fig. 5A). The 4–1 loop lies either on the same face as the

2–3 loop, or may be positioned more closely to the βsheet core of the propeller (Fig. 5). In subgroup 1, the
longest 2–3 loops were found in repeats 1, 5 and 6, with
shorter loops in blades 2, 3 and 4. The longest 4–1 loop
were that between repeats 5 and 6 (Fig. 3). In the context
of a β-propeller, this suggests that the side of the propeller
formed by repeats 5, 6 and 1 may be particularly involved
in protein interactions (see Fig. 1C). In subgroup 2A, the
longest 2–3 loops were those in repeats 1 and 2, repeats 4
and 5 had intermediate 2–3 loops and repeats 3 and 6
contained the shortest 2–3 loops. The longest 4–1 loops
were those between repeats 1 and 2, and repeats 3 and 4
(Fig. 4). This suggests that there is a different organisation
of binding sites in subgroup 2A β-propellers, with perhaps
two binding faces formed by repeats 1 and 2, and repeats
4 and 5. At the level of individual sequences, there were
also specific examples of variation from the standard
repeat organisation that could be of functional
importance for individual proteins. For example,
NP_695002 in subgroup 2A has an unusually long and
highly charged 3–4 loop in repeat 1 and XP_ 040383 has
a long 3–4 loop in repeat 4 (Fig. 4).
We also found that the consensus sequences for the fold
were distinctive between the two subgroups. The 50 %
identity consensus sequence from each subgroup was realigned against the kelch-repeat unit to derive mean 50 %
identity consensus sequences for subgroup 1 and subgroup 2A. These motifs were mapped against the known
blade structure of galactose oxidase (Fig. 5). The consensus motifs included both amino acids of importance to
the fold (located within the β-strands) and certain amino
acids within loops, that would be predicted to contribute
to binding interactions. Of note, the average length of the
motif was shorter in subgroup 1 than subgroup 2A. The
subgroup 2A consensus is predicted to contain a longer 2–
3 loop. The consensus motifs were distinct in the positioning of highly-conserved charged residues within the
loop regions (Fig. 5). The conservation of these charged
residues was most pronounced in subgroup 1, where
these positions were conserved in the motif to the 70 %
identity threshold level (data not shown). These distinctions in loop characteristics are also suggestive of different
modalities of protein-protein interactions for the β-propellers of subgroups 1 and 2A. With regard to previouslycharacterised protein-binding properties, we observed
that the BTB/kelch proteins that bind to actin were split
between subgroups 1 and 3; thus this function does not
have a simple relationship to the primary structure (Fig.
2A).
Kelch-repeat Proteins encoded in invertebrate genomes
We wished to compare the evolutionary development of
kelch-repeat proteins between humans and modern invertebrates, and so repeated the analysis of kelch-repeat pro-

teins and their structural subgroups encoded in the
genomes of D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and C. elegans
[33–35]. We identified 18 kelch-repeat proteins encoded
in the Drosophila and Anopheles genomes (Table 2). Seventeen of these were orthologues conserved between the two
species (the average identity between orthologous genes
of D. melanogaster and A. gambiae is 56 % [36]) and one
was unique to each species. Thus, an Actinfilin homologue was identified in A. gambiae but not in D. melanogaster and the D. melanogaster genome contained a
homologue of NP_116164 which was not present in A.
gambiae (Table 2). Only three kelch-repeat proteins were
previously characterised in D. melanogaster, namely Kelch
[1,37], Muskelin [38] and Drosophila host cell factor [39].
Two others, diablo and scruin-like at the midline (SLIM1), have been recognised as kelch-repeat proteins [33].
Within the group of 19 proteins and hypothetical proteins, 95 % contained six kelch-repeats. Only one protein
with five kelch-repeats was identified in either D. melanogaster or A. gambiae, which corresponded to an orthologue of the human F-box/kelch protein, XP_048774
(Table 2). 56 % of the kelch-repeat proteins of D. melanogaster and A. gambiae were BTB/kelch proteins. Both D.
melanogaster and A. gambiae contained one discoidin/
kelch protein orthologous to muskelin, one F-box/kelch
protein, three kelch and multidomain proteins, one kelch
and unique protein, and two propeller-only proteins.
Thus, all of the 19 kelch-repeat proteins identified had
homologues in the human genome and the BTB/kelch
domain architecture was the most prevalent (Table 2).
We identified 16 kelch-repeat proteins encoded within the
C. elegans genome (Table 3). Of these proteins, only kel-1,
spe-26 and CeHCF have been functionally characterised.
Kel-1 is an intracellular protein involved in the regulation
of feeding behavior during larval development [40]. Spe26 contributes to the cellular organisation of spermatocytes and mutations are associated with sterility [41].
CeHCF might be involved in the regulation of cell
proliferation [42–44]. 43.7 % (7/16) of the proteins had
the BTB/kelch domain architecture, two were homologues
of HCF and attractin with similar multidomain architectures, two contained unique sequences outside of the
kelch repeats and two were propeller-only proteins, both
of which were predicted to form six-bladed β-propellers.
A single F-box/kelch protein was identified, but no
muskelin-like protein was found (Table 3), [34]. Instead,
two hypothetical proteins with distinctive domain architectures were identified : NP_506605 which also contained a cyclin carboxy-terminal domain (CDD 7965,
Pfam 02984, SMART 00385) and NP_506602, that contained a RING domain (CDD 8941, Pfam 00097, SMART
00184). The cyclin carboxy-terminal domain forms an α-

to yeast, by analysing the complement of kelch-repeat
proteins encoded in the S. pombe and S. cerevisiae
genomes [49,50]. We found that each genome encoded a
small number of kelch-repeat proteins (five in S. pombe,
eight in S. cerevisiae), none of which corresponded to a
BTB/kelch protein (Table 4). Proteins and hypothetical
proteins consisting of an amino-terminal kelch β-propeller and an extended coiled-coil region [3,47,48] and a protein corresponding to a putative leucine carboxyl
methyltransferase [26] were common to S. pombe and S.
cerevisiae. The other encoded kelch-repeat proteins were
non-homologous (Table 4). Muskelin-like 1 protein and
Ral-2p were identified in S. pombe but not S. cerevisiae
[38,51]. Two proteins with distantly-related kelch repeats,
Gpb1/Krh1 and Gpb2/Krh2, have been characterised
functionally as G protein-coupled receptor-binding proteins in S. cerevisiae [52,53]. Homologous proteins were
not identified in S. pombe in the context of our study.
Thus, the BTB/kelch domain architecture was not identified in these yeasts.
Restriction of BTB/kelch proteins to metazoan animals
and poxviruses
Because the BTB/kelch domain architecture appeared
prevalent in animals but was not identified in yeast we
were interested to consider if any other organisms might
contain kelch-repeat proteins with this domain
architecture. A number of BTB/kelch proteins have been
reported as hypothetical open reading frames (ORFs) in
the poxvirus family of animal viruses [54]. The Conserved
Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART) database at
NCBI lists 333 entries for BTB/kelch proteins, all of which
originate from vertebrates, insects, C. elegans or poxviruses. To date, the BTB domain has only been identified in
eucaryotes (Pfam 00651 species tree). In addition to
reviewing the SMART and Pfam species trees for categorisation of the BTB/kelch domain architecture, we conducted our own BLASTP and TBLASTX searches of the A.
thaliana genome database [55] with the CDD kelch motif
consensus (this search tool identified 44 BTB/kelch proteins from the human genome and is thus very effective in
uncovering these proteins) and identified 72 protein
sequences, the majority of which were F-box/kelch proteins, some of which were serine-threonine phosphatase/
kelch proteins, [21,22,56], and none of which were BTB/
kelch proteins. Searches with the BTB domains of several
human or invertebrate kelch-repeat proteins also did not
identify BTB/kelch proteins in A. thaliana. BLAST genomes
searches of the databases of complete or partiallysequenced eucaryotic animal and plant genomes at NCBI
(Entrez/genome_tree, [57]), that included the fullysequenced genomes of the Apicomplexium Plasmodium
falciparum [58], the Microsporidium Encephalitozoon
cuniculi [59], the plant Oryza sativa (rice; [60]) and the
fungus Neurospora crassa [61] identified many predicted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/42

kelch-repeat-containing proteins, but no ORFs that had
the BTB/kelch domain architecture. Results for selected
domain architectures in five eucaryotic organisms are presented in Fig. 6. We did, however, note in Apicomplexia
species, two proteins with K Tetra /kelch domain architecture (NP_705330 and EAA22466). The K tetra domain
(Pfam 02214) is a distant structural relative of the BTB/
POZ domain [62]. Overall, these results provide a significant indication that protein-encoding sequences for the
BTB/kelch domain architecture have become expanded
during the evolution of multicellular animals, compared
to Apicomplexia, fungi, plants and other eucaryotes.

Discussion
Our analysis of the molecular organisation and phylogeny
of kelch-repeat proteins provides a new view on the evolution of the kelch-repeat domain and the proteins that
share this domain. Several features distinguish the kelchmotif and its domain superfamily from other sequence
motifs that fold as β-propeller structures. First, the consensus sequence of a kelch motif differs from that of other βpropeller motifs, such as the WD motif, RCC1 motif, tachylectin-2 repeat or YWTD motif [3,5,7]. Secondly, the
majority of the β-propeller domains that have been
crystallised are seven- or eight-bladed β-propeller structures [3,5,7,8]. A geometric preference for assembly of
seven-bladed β-propellers over six or eight bladed-forms
has been demonstrated by mathematical modelling [63]
and indeed the majority of WD motif proteins, a considerably more numerous domain family in metazoa than
the kelch-repeat proteins, are predicted to form sevenbladed β-propellers [7,64]. Our comprehensive evaluation of kelch-repeat domains in the proteomes of multiple
eucaryotic organisms clearly delineates a preponderance
of predicted six-bladed β-propellers in the kelch-repeat
superfamily. In addition, WD proteins have been identified as proteins of eucaryotic animals and plants [5,6,64],
whereas kelch-repeats are universally represented in
eucaryotes, bacteria and viruses.
The data also present new insights into the evolution of
domain organisation in kelch-repeat proteins. Kelchrepeat domains are found in proteins from all forms of
life, yet the diverse domain architectures of kelch-repeat
proteins and the significant differences in the relative
representation of domain architecture groups encoded in
the genomes of animals, fungi and plants attest to considerable functional diversification and biological
specialisation of the superfamily. The prevalence of the Fbox/kelch domain architecture in plants has been recognised [21,22]. We report clear evidence for the prevalence
of the BTB/kelch domain architecture in the kelch-repeat
proteins of metazoan animals from C. elegans to human
(Fig. 6). The expansion of this subgroup appears animalspecific, because although kelch repeats are found in all

eucaryotes and the BTB domain is present in fungi and
animals, the combination of the BTB/kelch domain
organisation was only identified in animals, where the
subgroup appears to have expanded as a gene family in
conjunction with multicellularity. Other domain
architectures, such as F-box/kelch or discoidin domain/
kelch, are present in a wider range of eucaryotic organisms, suggestive of an earlier evolutionary origin.
The other organisms in which BTB/kelch proteins have
been identified are members of the animal poxvirus family. In these viruses, which are thought to have acquired
these genes by horizontal transfer from animals, BTB/
kelch-encoding ORFs are found with the variable long terminal regions (LTR) of the genomes which determine the
species-trophism and strain-specific properties of each
virus. [54]. Cowpox virus, which has the broadest host
range, contains six BTB/kelch-encoding sequences,
whereas in variola virus (smallpox virus), that has a single
host, all the kelch/BTB sequences are disrupted by mutations that truncate the ORFs [54,65]. Therefore, it has
been suggested that the BTB/kelch proteins encoded in
poxviruses could detemine the host range and/or pathogenicity of a virus [54]. Alternatively, the proteins might
act to modulate host immune response to virus infection
or might be necessary for in vivo host/virus interactions,
for example subversion of host cell functions such as
cytoskeletal organisation or formation of cell signaling
protein complexes, that would affect the ability of the
virus to persist within the host. The three BTB/kelch proteins of vaccina virus are not necessary for viral replication
in culture and further targeted experiments are needed to
establish the function of BTB/kelch proteins in cowpox
and other poxviruses [66]. A greater understanding of the
normal functions of animal BTB/kelch proteins could
help reveal the roles of poxvirus BTB/kelch proteins.
In addition, the large numbers of BTB/kelch proteins
identified in metazoan animal genomes, particularly in
human, present an interesting enigma. Why do animals
need so many BTB/kelch proteins? Only eight out of the
51 human BTB/kelch proteins are of known function
(Table 1). Although there are multiple examples of BTB/
kelch proteins that bind actin [3], multiple sequence
alignment of the human BTB/kelch proteins showed that
the known actin-binding kelch-repeat proteins did not
belong to a specific sequence subgroup (Fig. 2A). This
result is not unexpected, given the low sequence
constraints for assembly of a β-propeller and the preference for a binding "supersite" on one propeller face [67].
Our studies of the two robust BTB/kelch subgroups indicate distinctions in specific secondary or tertiary structural
features of these β-propellers, with regard to loop and βpropeller organisation, that could be important for the
functions of these proteins. Although, for the reasons

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/42

stated above, it is unlikely that the these features specify a
common binding partner, we suggest that the differences
in positioning of the major loops in the kelch-repeats of
subgroups 1 and 2A could provide important indications
of the location and characteristics of putative proteinbinding sites. The studies identified general distinctions
between the two subgroups (the positioning of the longest 2–3 and 4–1 loops within the domain and the mean
length of 2–3 loops) and also unusual features of single
repeats in specific proteins. This information could be
important for the analysis of proteins within these groups,
to accelerate rational design of mutational and functional
studies. It would also be of obvious interest to have crystal
structure information for a representative β-propeller
from each BTB/kelch subgroup and for the other domain
architecture groups. Interestingly, the BTB/kelch proteins
of insects and C. elegans were all, with one exception, most
closely-related to the subgroup 1 human BTB/kelch proteins (Tables 2 and 3, Fig. 2). Thus, subgroup 1 may represent the BTB/kelch proteins of earliest origin from
which others have diversified during evolution, making
these proteins particularly significant for further study.
The majority of eucaryotic kelch-repeat proteins are predicted to be intracellular proteins. Many proteins in the βpropeller fold family function as enzymatic, scaffolding,
or transducer components of protein complexes [5,6,8].
We speculate that many of the currently uncharacterised
BTB/kelch-repeat proteins of animals will turn out to be
components of multiprotein complexes with roles in
reception of extracellular cues, cell signaling and transport, or cell organisation.

Conclusions
The kelch-repeat superfamily constitutes a distinct and
evolutionarily-widespread family of β-propeller domaincontaining proteins. Expansion of the family during the
evolution of multicellular animals is mainly accounted
for by a major expansion of the BTB/kelch domain architecture. BTB/kelch proteins constitute 72 % of the kelchrepeat superfamily of H. sapiens and form three subgroups, one of which appears the most-conserved during
evolution. Distinctions in propeller blade organisation
between subgroups 1 and 2, with respect to loop length
and charge distribution and the positioning of major
loops within the β-propeller domain were identified that
could provide new direction for biochemical and functional studies of novel kelch-repeat proteins.

Methods
BLAST Database searches and identification of Domain
Architectures
The whole human genome http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
genome/seq/HsBlast.html was searched with the 46 residue consensus sequence for the Kelch motif
(PRSGAGVVVVGGKIYVIGGFDGSQSLSSVEVYDPETNT-

WEKLPSMP; CDD543) by the basic local alignment
search tools BLASTP and PSI-BLAST [67,68] at standard
parameters, with a default expectation value of 10 and
reporting up to 500 protein sequences. The database was
also searched with the kelch repeats from human host cell
factor-1 (aa1-aa357; [30]), mouse leucine-zipper-like
transcriptional regulator (aa49-aa369; [69]), rat Actinfilin
(aa331-aa616; [70]), human Rag2 (aa1-aa348; [16]),
human muskelin (aa 249–636; [71]), the complete
sequences of all the previously-characterised kelch-repeat
proteins [3] and examples of single kelch-repeats that differ in length or sequence characteristics from the kelch
motif consensus (repeat 3 of mouse muskelin, repeats 3,
4, 5 of RAG-2, repeat 1 of NP_695002, repeat 4 of
NP_040383, repeat 1 of NP_071324). The listings of
kelch proteins in Pfam 9.0 [19] (Wellcome Trust-Sanger
Institute) and SMART [20] (EMBL) domain databases
were also analysed and any apparent additional human
kelch-repeat proteins searched against GenBank. From
these searches, we found that the species listings in Pfam
and SMART did not include all the kelch-repeat proteins
identified in our searches and contained multiple
redundant entries including partial ORFs for the same
protein. Each identified protein sequence was reciprocally
searched against the non-redundant protein database of
GenBank and Conserved Domain Database [72] (which
includes the Pfam and SMART databases) to confirm the
identification of kelch repeats and to identify additional
domains. Novel hypothetical ORFs within the human
genome were used to query the database of human
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to determine whether corresponding translation products could be identified. Hits
that appeared ambiguous as putative incomplete open
reading frames in the initial search were excluded from
further analysis, but were also searched against the mouse
and rat genome databases at NCBI. The same search methods were used to identify kelch-repeat proteins in the
genome databases of D. melanogaster [33], A. gambiae
[34], C. elegans [35], S. cerevisiae [50], S. pombe [49] and A.
thaliana [55] at NCBI. A. gambiae proteins were not listed
in the Pfam or SMART species trees. All these searches
were carried out in the period March 18 to April 20, 2003.
A second set of searches were carried out between 14th
June and 22nd July, 2003. Each identified sequence from
these species was used in BLAST searches of the human
genome to identify the closest human homologue (ie, an
ORF with significant identity to the entire protein
sequence, not only to the kelch repeats). Previously
unknown proteins identified in these searches were also
used to query the human genome database to determine
if additional human kelch-repeat proteins could be identified. Other eucaryotic genomes were searched through
the BLAST Genomes interface at NCBI [57]. At the time of
search, this database included complete or partial genome
sequence information for 48 eucaryotic genomes (12

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/42

complete), 222 eubacterial genomes and 18 archaebacterial genomes.
Entries in the human proteome which appeared to be partial sequences included GenBank XP_054631, which was
91 % identical to the C3IP1 Kelch-protein (Accession
NP_067646). Comparison of the two sequences at the
nucleotide level showed that a single nucleotide deletion
(ACAGTGG→ACATGG) in the XP_054631 entry generated an additional start-codon, in the equivalent position
to valine100 in C3IP1. Additionally, a single mutation in
XP_054631 (GTCCGACG→GTCTGACG) generates a
stopcodon and consequently a truncated open reading
frame. Thus, the XP_054631 and NP_067646 entries
appeared to be derived from the same gene and only
NP_067646 is included in Table 1. The entry XP_209285
encoded a open reading frame of 128 amino acids, containing 3 kelch-repeats with highest sequence identity to
rat actinfilin, NP_663704, length 640 amino acids [70].
Additional searches with rat actinfilin did not identify a
full-length human sequence. The entry NP_689579
encoded a 263 residue polypeptide containing 2 kelchrepeats. We identified orthologues in both Mus musculus
and Rattus norvegicus of 303 amino acids and 238 amino
acids, respectively. Alignments of all three orthologues
indicate a highly conserved segment identified in all three
orthologues, a segment only present in human, and a segment only present in mouse. These discrepancies may
arise from alternate predictions of intron-exon boundaries during genome annotation. All these entries were
excluded from Table 1 and from the further sequence
analyses at this time.
Prediction of β-propeller closure mechanisms
β-propeller closure mechanisms for the human kelchrepeat proteins were predicted by use of Jpred secondary
structure prediction, to identify beta-sheet secondary
structure either amino- or carboxy-terminal to the kelch
motifs in each polypeptide sequence http://www.comp
bio.dundee.ac.uk/~www-jpred. Each sequence was also
examined manually for the presence of a tryptophan residue amino-terminal to the first motif or carboxy-terminal
to the last motif, as a second predictor of amino-terminal
or carboxy-terminal β-propeller closure mechanisms,
respectively, [3].
Multiple sequence alignment and identification of human
BTB/kelch protein subgroups
All the full-length human BTB/kelch protein sequences
predicted to form six-bladed propellers (38 sequences)
were aligned by CLUSTALW [73] multiple sequence alignment at EMBnet http://www.ch.EMBnet.org, European
Bioinformatics Institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk and at the
San Diego Supercomputer Center Biology Workbench 3.2
http://workbench.sdsc.edu, with similar results. Align-

ments, bootstrap analysis and neighborhood-joining trees
were carried out at default parameters from the full-length
sequences, from the kelch-repeats alone, or from the BTB
domains alone, at the Biology Workbench and are presented as neighbourhood-joining trees (rooted dendrograms prepared by reference to the unrooted trees)
prepared in the Phylip Drawgram 3.5c software at Biology
Workbench [74], with annotation in Adobe Illustrator.
These analyses identified two major robustly-related subgroups within the kelch/BTB proteins. These groupings
were substantiated by a second method, PROTPARS
(Felsenstein, J. 1993. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) version 3.5c, distributed by the author, Department
of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle) for maximum parsimony analysis of sequence relationships, also
carried out at Biology Workbench. CLUSTALW multiple
sequence alignments of the kelch-repeats from the two
subgroups consistently identified by CLUSTALW and
PROTPARS were used to derive a 50 % identity consensus
sequence for each subgroup and are presented in Boxshade 3.2. The 50 % identity consensus sequence derived
from each set of six kelch motifs were re-aligned with each
other to prepare a averaged single motif consensus at 50
% identity for each subgroup in CLUSTALW. These averaged consensus motifs were mapped against the tertiary
structure of a kelch-repeat β-propeller blade using the
structure of fungal galactose oxidase (PDB 1GOF) as a
template and the Swiss-PDB viewer software http://
www.expasy.org/spdbv/.
