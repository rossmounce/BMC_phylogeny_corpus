Abstract
Background: Thiomonas strains are ubiquitous in arsenic-contaminated environments. Differences
between Thiomonas strains in the way they have adapted and respond to arsenic have never been
studied in detail. For this purpose, five Thiomonas strains, that are interesting in terms of arsenic
metabolism were selected: T. arsenivorans, Thiomonas spp. WJ68 and 3As are able to oxidise As(III),
while Thiomonas sp. Ynys1 and T. perometabolis are not. Moreover, T. arsenivorans and 3As present
interesting physiological traits, in particular that these strains are able to use As(III) as an electron
donor.
Results: The metabolism of carbon and arsenic was compared in the five Thiomonas strains
belonging to two distinct phylogenetic groups. Greater physiological differences were found
between these strains than might have been suggested by 16S rRNA/rpoA gene phylogeny,
especially regarding arsenic metabolism. Physiologically, T. perometabolis and Ynys1 were unable to
oxidise As(III) and were less arsenic-resistant than the other strains. Genetically, they appeared to
lack the aox arsenic-oxidising genes and carried only a single ars arsenic resistance operon.
Thiomonas arsenivorans belonged to a distinct phylogenetic group and increased its autotrophic
metabolism when arsenic concentration increased. Differential proteomic analysis revealed that in
T. arsenivorans, the rbc/cbb genes involved in the assimilation of inorganic carbon were induced in
the presence of arsenic, whereas these genes were repressed in Thiomonas sp. 3As.
Conclusion: Taken together, these results show that these closely related bacteria differ
substantially in their response to arsenic, amongst other factors, and suggest different relationships
between carbon assimilation and arsenic metabolism.

Background
Microorganisms play an essential role in shaping the natural environment. They have evolved specific metabolic
pathways allowing them to utilise a wide range of substrates, many of which are toxic to higher organisms.
Through the conversion of both anthropogenic and naturally occurring pollutants to less toxic products, such
microorganisms effect widespread natural bioremediation. An important toxic compound is arsenic, a metalloid
that can cause multiple health effects including diabetes,
hypertension, skin lesions and skin and internal cancers
[1]. Arsenic occurs in soils and water bodies both naturally and as a result of anthropogenic processes. A major
anthropogenic source is the mining industry, where the
processing of sulfide ores produces large quantities of
sulfidic wastes which may be rich in arsenic-bearing compounds such as arsenopyrite. The weathering of these
minerals leads to the formation of acid mine drainage
(AMD), generally characterised by elevated sulfate, iron
and other metal concentrations [2], and thus the transport
of many toxic elements such as inorganic forms of arsenic,
arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)). This often results
in chronic and severe pollution of the surrounding environment, with a substantial reduction of the indigenous
biota.
Numerous arsenic-oxidising microorganisms, especially
Proteobacteria, are able to oxidise As(III) to As(V) in order
to detoxify their immediate environment. This biological
As(III) oxidation is of particular importance, As(III) being
more soluble and more toxic than As(V) [3]. Additionally,
in acidic environments such as those impacted by AMD,
natural remediation can occur as a result of the concurrent
oxidation of ferrous iron and arsenite, leading to the
coprecipitation of both [4]. Therefore, understanding factors that influence the competitiveness, diversity and role
of these organisms is an essential step in the development
of bioremediation systems treating arsenic contaminated
environments.
Certain bacterial strains are able to use arsenite as an electron donor. By gaining energy, as well as removing the
more toxic arsenic species, such bacteria may gain an
advantage over other microorganisms [5]. Arsenite oxidase, the enzyme catalysing As(III)-oxidation, has been
well characterised in several bacterial strains [6-11]. An
important group of As(III)-oxidising bacteria belong to
the Thiomonas genus, and are ubiquitous in arsenic-contaminated environments [12-15]. Thiomonas strains are
able to gain energy from the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulphur compounds (RISCs) [16], and are defined
as facultative chemolithoautotrophs which grow optimally in mixotrophic media containing RISCs and
organic supplements. These bacteria are also capable of
organotrophic growth [17]. The original description com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/127

prised Thiomonas cuprina, T. intermedia, T. perometabolis
and T. Thermosulfata [17,18]. Thiomonas perometabolis was
isolated from soil at a building site in Los Angeles, U.S.A.,
as Thiobacillus perometabolis [19]. It was differentiated from
Thiobacillus intermedius (now T. intermedia, the type species of the genus) as it was apparently unable to grow
autotrophically. However, Katayama-Fujimura and Kuraishi [20] have since suggested that this is not true. Recently
described species include Thiomonas. arsenivorans [21] and
the Thiomonas strains 3As [12], Ynys1 [22] and WJ68 [14].
Thiomonas sp. 3As was obtained from the Carnoulès mine
tailings, Southern France [12]. It was shown that this bacterium could gain energy from the oxidation of arsenic.
The presence of carboxysomes and the detection of the
cbbSL genes encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, led the authors propose that this strain
may be able to fix CO2. T. arsenivorans was isolated from
another arsenic-rich mine residue at the Cheni former
gold mine, Limousin, France [21]. The Cheni site is not
very acidic (pH ~6.0), but is highly contaminated with
arsenic (6.0 mg g-1 in the solid phase and ~1.33 mM in the
liquid phase) [23]. T. arsenivorans has been shown to oxidise arsenic and ferrous iron, and is able to grow
autotrophically using arsenic as the sole energy source
[21]. Strain Ynys1 was isolated from ferruginous waters
which have been draining from an adit since the closure
of several coal mines near to the village of Ynysarwed,
Wales, U.K. [22]. The waters were of relatively neutral pH
(pH 6.3) with elevated iron loading (300 mg L-1) and have
led to significant pollution of the area [22]. Strain WJ68
was the dominant isolate obtained from effluent draining
all three of the compost bioreactors of a pilot-scale bioremediation plant receiving water from the Wheal Jane tin
mine, Cornwall, U.K. [14]. Both WJ68 and Ynys1 are
known to oxidise ferrous iron, while WJ68 has been
shown to oxidise arsenite [15].
These five strains are interesting in terms of arsenic metabolism: T. arsenivorans, WJ68 and 3As are able to oxidise
As(III), while Ynys1 and T. perometabolis are not. Moreover, T. arsenivorans and 3As present interesting physiological traits, in particular that these strains are able to use
As(III) as an electron donor. However, differences
between Thiomonas strains in the way they have adapted
and respond to arsenic have never been studied further.
The connection between carbon and arsenic metabolism
in these strains, particularly inorganic carbon assimilation
and arsenite as energy source, has never been compared.
Therefore, analysis was undertaken to examine these
physiological aspects in these five Thiomonas strains.

Results
Phylogenetic, phenotypic and genotypic analyses of the
five Thiomonas strains
Phylogenetic analyses of amplified 16S rRNA and rpoA
gene products confirmed the occurrence of two distinct
monophyletic groups as had been suggested previously
[15]. SuperGene analysis (Figure. 1A) was performed
using concatenated 16S rRNA and rpoA gene sequences of
each strain. These results placed T. perometabolis with
WJ68 and Ynys1. Along with Thiomonas sp. 3As, these
strains grouped together in Group I, while T. arsenivorans
was part of Group II.

Various tests were carried out to examine the physiological response of the five strains to arsenic. This was coupled
with a PCR-based approach to determine the presence of
genes involved in arsenic metabolism. In agreement with
previous data, strains 3As, WJ68 and T. arsenivorans oxidised arsenite to arsenate in liquid media whereas T. perometabolis and Ynys1 did not (Table 1). The aoxAB genes
encoding the arsenite oxidase large and small subunits of
Thiomonas sp. 3As and T. arsenivorans have previously
been characterised [12,24]. Positive PCR results using
primers which targeted a region of the aoxAB genes were
obtained with DNA from all strains except Ynys1 and T.

perometabolis. The aoxAB genes of WJ68 were much more
divergent than those of T. arsenivorans and 3As (data not
shown). This is in agreement with previous findings
showing that the aoxB gene of WJ68 groups neither with
T. arsenivorans nor the Group I thiomonads [10],
(Quéméneur, personal communication). The inability of
T. perometabolis and Ynys1 to oxidise arsenite further
implied that the aox operon was absent in these strains.
The MIC of As(III) for strains 3As, WJ68 and T. arsenivorans was 10 mM, higher than for strains Ynys1 and T. perometabolis (Table 1). Additionally, strain Ynys1 was more
sensitive to As(V) than the other strains. Arsenic resistance
in bacteria is in part due to the expression of aox genes but
also of the ars arsenic-resistance genes [8]. Among these,
arsC encodes an arsenate reductase and arsA and arsB
encode an arsenite efflux pump. Analysis of the Thiomonas
sp. 3As genome (Arsène-Ploetze & Bertin, unpublished)
revealed the presence of two copies of the arsB gene,
denoted arsB1 and arsB2. These genes were found to be
distantly related, sharing just 70.2% sequence identity. In
order to compare the occurrence, copy number and type
of ars genes present in the different Thiomonas strains, PCR
amplifications using generic arsB primers were performed.
As expected, RFLP and sequence analysis confirmed the

presence of the arsB1 and arsB2 genes in strain 3As (Table
1). In contrast, only the arsB1 gene could be detected
using DNA from T. perometabolis, Ynys1 and WJ68, even
when internal primers specific for the arsB2 gene were
used. Conversely, only the arsB2 gene was detected in T.
arsenivorans.
The phylogeny of the arsB1 and arsB2 genes was analysed,
excluding the sequences obtained using the arsB2 internal
primers that were too short. The arsB2 gene sequence for
strain 3As was taken directly from the annotated genome
(Arsène-Ploetze & Bertin, unpublished). The data showed
that while they are all related to the arsB genes of Leptospirillum spp. and Acidithiobacillus caldus, the type 1 and
type 2 genes formed two very distinct clades and have
clearly diverged at an evolutionarily distant point in time
(Figure. 1B).
The motility of Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans, an arsenicoxidising bacterium is greater in the presence of arsenite
[25]. Motility tests revealed that the five Thiomonas strains
reacted differently to the metalloid (Table 1). Strain T. perometabolis was found to be non-motile irrespective of
arsenite concentrations. Among the motile strains, three
distinct phenotypes were observed: those for whom
motility was not affected by arsenite concentration (strain
3As); those who showed increased motility with increasing arsenite concentrations (strains T. arsenivorans and
WJ68) and those who showed decreased motility with
increasing arsenite concentration (Ynys1). WJ68 was three
to four times more motile than all of the other strains. A
concentration of 2.67 mM arsenite appeared to have an
inhibitory effect on T. arsenivorans and WJ68 motility
(data not shown).

All the physiological and genetic analyses revealed that
the response to arsenic differed in the five Thiomonas
strains; some of these differences were correlated with differences in the genetic content.
As(III) as an energy source, and the fixation of carbon
dioxide
Only T. arsenivorans, 3As and WJ68 were able to grow in
basal media with yeast extract as the sole energy source
(Table 1). During these growth experiments, soluble sulfate concentrations remained the same or decreased
slightly (data not shown), indicating that energy was
gained from the oxidation of compounds other than any
trace RISCs in the yeast extract, most probably organic carbon. These observations suggest that all strains except
Ynys1 and T. perometabolis are organotrophic. All strains
were able to grow in the presence of YE and thiosulfate
(Table 1). In these thiosulfate-amended cultures, sulfate
concentrations increased following incubation (data not
shown), indicating that thiosulfate had been oxidised.
This suggests that all strains were able to use this RISC as
an energy source and are therefore chemolithotrophic. In
all cases, greater growth occurred in thiosulfate-amended
cultures, suggesting that mixotrophic conditions are optimal for the growth of these strains. It was however
observed that T. arsenivorans grew better in MCSM liquid
medium, whereas T. perometabolis and Ynys1 grew better
in m126 medium (3As and WJ68 grew equally well in
both; data not shown). MCSM contains 2 times less thiosulfate and suggests that the optimal thiosulfate concentration is lower in the case of T. arsenivorans.

Only T. arsenivorans was able to grow in basal media without yeast extract with either thiosulfate or arsenite as the
sole energy source (Table 1). Although direct cell enumeration of T. perometabolis cultures was not possible due to
its propensity to form flocs during growth, no growth,
flocular or otherwise, was observed in the YE-free media.
The growth of T. arsenivorans was stimulated by 1.33 mM
As(III) in presence of 0.1 g L-1 yeast extract, but this positive effect was no longer detected in presence of 0.2 g L-1
yeast extract. The ability of T. arsenivorans to grow
autotrophically using As(III) as the sole energy source was
confirmed by the observation of increasing quantities of
carbon fixed as more As(III) was oxidised (Figure. 2). This
demonstrated that T. arsenivorans was able to use energy
gained from the oxidation of As(III) to fix inorganic carbon. In contrast, strain 3As was unable to fix inorganic
carbon under the same conditions (in MCSM), as 1.33
mM As(III) was found to inhibit growth in presence of 0.1
or 0.2 g L-1 yeast extract (Table 1), and this strain was unable to grow in presence of As(III) as the sole energy source.
Figure 2 shows an essentially linear relationship between
carbon fixed and arsenic oxidised, corresponding to 3.9

mM-1 As(III). It requires 40 J to produce 1 mg of organic
carbon cellular material from CO2 [26]. The energy produced from the oxidation of As(III) with O2 is 189 J
mMol-1 [27]. As a consequence, if 100% of this energy was
used for carbon fixation, 4.73 mg C would be fixed for 1
mM As(III) oxidised. Thus, in this experiment, 6% of the
energy available from arsenic oxidation was used for carbon fixation. This result is in accordance with the 5 to
10% range of efficiency for carbon fixation by various
autotrophic bacteria [26].

each strain (Figure. 3, Table 2 and see Additional file 1).
In both strains, arsenic-specific enzymes (ArsA2 in T.
arsenivorans, ArsC1 in 3As) were more abundant in the
presence of As(III), suggesting that a typical arsenic-specific response occurred in both strains. ArsA2 is part of the
efflux pump with ArsB2 and is encoded by the ars2
operon. Moreover, expression of a putative oxidoreductase (THI3148-like protein) was induced in the presence of
arsenic. This protein is conserved in At. caldus, with 90%
amino-acid identity (Arsène-Ploetze & Bertin, unpublished). The At. caldus gene encoding this THI3148-like
protein is embedded within an ars operon. This protein is
also conserved in more than 56 other bacteria, for example in Mycobacterium abscessus (51% identity) and Lactobacillus plantarum (48% identity). In these two cases the
corresponding gene was also found in the vicinity of ars
genes.

Enzymes involved in carbon metabolism and energy

The expression of several proteins involved in other metabolic pathways changed, suggesting that in the presence
of arsenic, the general metabolism of T. arsenivorans and
3As was modified. Indeed, enzymes involved in glyoxylate metabolism were more abundant in the presence of
arsenic, suggesting that expression of such proteins is regulated in response to arsenic in both strains. However,
several changes observed were clearly different between
both strains. In T. arsenivorans, two proteins involved in
CO2 fixation (ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase
(RuBisCo) and fructose-1,6-biphosphatase) were more
abundant when cells were grown in the presence of
arsenic, whereas in Thiomonas sp. 3As, such proteins were
less abundant in the presence of As(III). In addition to
these proteins, it was observed that enzymes involved in
major carbon metabolism (glycolysis, neoglucogenesis)
or energy metabolism (thiosulfate oxidation, oxidative
phosphorylation) were less abundant in 3As in the presence of As(III). This observation correlated with the phenotypic observation that the strain 3As grew better in the
absence of arsenic (Table 1).

as sensitive to As(III) as the other strains. Moreover, the
inhibitory effect of arsenite on Ynys1 motility suggests a
greater susceptibility of this strain to the metalloid. This
could be due to the absence of aox or ars genes. Indeed,
these two strains are unable to oxidize As(III), probably as
they lack aox genes. Moreover, arsB2 genes were not
detected in Ynys1 and T. perometabolis. Therefore, it is
probable that these two strains have only a single set of
arsenic resistance genes that can be expressed. Interestingly, WJ68 was found to be equally resistant to arsenic as
these strains, yet no arsB2 gene could be amplified by
PCR. The same is true for T. arsenivorans, for which no
arsB1 gene was detected by PCR, yet it was again as resistant as those strains shown to possess both the ars1 and
ars2 operons. One possible explanation is that WJ68 possesses two copies of the ars1 operon and T. arsenivorans
has two copies of the ars2 operon. Alternatively, the
higher resistance capacities of T. arsenivorans, Thiomonas
sp. 3As, and WJ68, as compared to Ynys1 and T. perometabolis may be due to greater As(III) oxidation capacity of
these strains.

Discussion

The arsenic response observed in T. arsenivorans and 3As
revealed that the proteins involved in arsenic resistance
(ars genes) were more highly expressed in the presence of
arsenic, as shown previously for H. arsenicoxydans [25,28],
Pseudomonas aeruginosa [29] and Comamonas sp. [30].
Therefore, such a feature seems to be a common arsenic
response. In H. arsenicoxydans, other proteins that were
shown to be more abundant in the presence of arsenic
were involved in oxidative stress, DNA repair and motility. In this study, such proteins (hydroperoxide reductase,
methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, PilM) were induced
in Thiomonas sp. 3As whereas in T. arsenivorans, only general stress proteins were induced. These observations suggest that the response to the stress induced by arsenic
involves different regulatory mechanisms in 3As and T.
arsenivorans. Contrary to this arsenic-specific response, the
other arsenic-regulated proteins identified in the Thiomonas strains did not share a similar expression pattern
with other arsenic-resistant bacteria. Thus it appears that
while there may be a common arsenic response between
all the bacteria, the general metabolism may be differentially adapted to each environment from which these
strains originated. In particular, T. arsenivorans has unique
traits in terms of arsenic, carbon and energy metabolism
that distinguish it from the other strains examined.

Two groups could be distinguished within the Thiomonas
strains studied: Group I comprises all the strains in this
study except T. arsenivorans, which is part of a second
group, Group II. As described by Moreira and Amils [17],
all of the strains grew better in mixotrophic media containing both thiosulfate and organic supplements, and
used RISCs as an energy source. This suggests that lithotrophy is a general characteristic of the Thiomonas genus. In
contrast, neither strain Ynys1 nor T. perometabolis could
grow organotrophically in the absence of a reduced sulfur
compound, suggesting that, despite previous findings, facultative organotrophy is not a general property of the Thiomonas genus. To improve our understanding of these
important arsenic-resistant bacteria, several metabolic
and genetic properties were investigated. It appears that
much greater physiological differentiation regarding
arsenic response was possible between these Thiomonas
strains than may have been previously suggested. Clearly
organisms that are phylogenetically close can differ greatly
physiologically, in particular concerning specific metabolic traits such as the metabolism of arsenic. For example, the effects of arsenic on the motility of all strains
appeared to be somewhat random, and cannot easily be
related to any of the phylogenetic or physiological data
obtained. It is worth noting that both T. arsenivorans and
WJ68 strains exhibited increased motility in the presence
of arsenic. This may indicate a potential energetic role of
the element for these strains, as proposed for the arsenicoxidising bacterium, H. arsenicoxydans [25].
Other physiological divergences concern arsenic resistance. Ynys1 and T. perometabolis were approximately twice

Thiomonas arsenivorans can grow autotrophically using
either As(III) or thiosulfate as the sole energy source. Surprisingly, the differential protein expression analysis
revealed that even in the presence of yeast extract, proteins
involved in CO2 fixation through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and enzymes involved in the glycolysis/
neoglucogenesis were expressed. In addition, it was

shown in the present study that T. arsenivorans induces
expression of carbon fixation-specific enzymes in the presence of arsenic. This observation was correlated with an
increased CO2 fixation efficiency when arsenic concentration increased. This suggests that an increase in cbb genes
expression in the presence of arsenic improves its capacity
to fix CO2. On the other hand, the opposite observation
was seen with Thiomonas sp. 3As. Therefore, the proteomic
results obtained from the present study suggest that these
two Thiomonas strains react differently to their arseniccontaminated environments. The other differences
observed concern DNA metabolism, transcription and
protein synthesis. It appears that, in the presence of
arsenic, T. arsenivorans is still able to express proteins
required for optimal growth whereas 3As is not.

Conclusion
These observations revealed that carbon assimilation,
energy acquisition and arsenic metabolism of these strains
are linked. However, they do not share a common mechanism, since metabolisms required for growth and carbon
assimilation are stimulated in T. arsenivorans in the presence of arsenic, but repressed in Thiomonas sp. 3As. Further work is needed to test if a common mechanism
occurs to regulate carbon assimilation and arsenic
response in other Thiomonas strains. However, to our
knowledge, this is the first example of such a link between
arsenic metabolism and carbon assimilation.

Methods
Culture media
All strains except T. arsenivorans were routinely cultured
on m126 (modified 126 medium) gelled or liquid
medium. Medium m126 contains: (g L-1) yeast extract
(YE; 0.5); Na2S2O3 (5.0); KH2PO4 (1.5); Na2HPO4 (4.5);
MgSO4·7H2O (0.1); (NH4)Cl (0.3), adjusted to pH 5.0
with H2SO4 prior to sterilisation. T. arsenivorans was routinely cultured on a modified MCSM medium (MCSM)
[31] with vitamins and trace elements omitted, yeast
extract added to a final concentration of 0.5 g L-1 and
Na2S2O3 to a final concentration of 2.5 g L-1. Variations of
these media included omitting yeast extract and/or thiosulfate. Where no yeast extract was included, trace elements were added, as described previously [32]. Where
required, the media were gelled by the addition of 12 g L1 agar (final concentration). Arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)) were added to media to the desired concentration from sterile stocks of 667.4 mM of the metalloid
ion in ddH2O, from NaAsO2 (Prolabo) and
Na2HAsO4·7H20 (Prolabo) salts, respectively.
Physiological tests
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) experiments
were performed using gelled media, amended with a
range of concentrations of either arsenite or arsenate.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/127

Concentrations of 10, 5.0, 2.25, 1.25 and 0 mM As(III) or
100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.3 and 0 mM As(V) were tested at 30°C
for up to 10 days. The ability of each strain to oxidise
arsenite was tested in triplicate, in liquid media amended
with 0.67 mM arsenite. Detection of As(III) and As(V) was
performed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) as described by Weeger et al.
[33]. To test the ability of each strain to grow in the
absence of a reduced inorganic sulfur source or organic
carbon source, pre-cultures grown in standard media were
harvested by centrifugation at 10 K g for 10 min, washed
and resuspended in a basal medium (m126 medium with
no thiosulfate or yeast extract). These were then used to
inoculate the test liquid media and incubated at 30°C for
10 days. Soluble sulfate concentrations were determined
turbidimetrically by the formation of insoluble barium
sulfate, as described by Kolmert et al. [34]. Bacterial
growth in media containing YE was assessed using optical
density at 600 nm. Viable cell counts were used to measure growth in the media lacking YE, as described by Miles
and Misra [35] using appropriate gelled media, as the
autotrophic growth yield would be much lower. Where YE
was omitted, the media contained either the normal concentration of thiosulfate or 5.33 mM arsenite (or 2.67 mM
for those strains sensitive to arsenite) as an electron
donor. In the case of arsenite-amended media, pre-cultures were grown in the presence of 2.67 mM arsenite.
To determine autotrophic growth yield as a product of
As(III) oxidised, triplicate cultures were grown in liquid
MCSM without YE or thiosulfate containing either 0.66 or
1.33 mM As(III), at 25°C in static conditions. To test concentrations greater than 1.33 mM, initial cultures containing 1.33 mM As(III) were inoculated. As soon as the
As(III) had been oxidised, more As(III) was added from a
concentrated (0.13 M) stock solution to a final concentration of 1.33 mM. Once this had been oxidised, the process
was repeated until the desired total quantity of As(III) had
been added. The oxidation of As(III) to As(V) was analysed as described by Battaglia-Brunet et al. [31]. The pH
was adjusted to pH 6.0 using a sterile NaOH solution
before each As(III) addition. Once all of the As(III) had
been oxidised, each culture was centrifuged at 10 kg for 15
min and the pellet resuspended in 10 mL MCSM. The
total organic carbon concentration of this suspension was
analysed using an OI ANALYTICAL 1010 apparatus
according to the AFNOR NF EN 1484 method. The influence of As(III) on final cell concentration in the presence
of an organic substrate was determined with strains 3As
and T. arsenivorans in MCSM complemented with 0.1 or
0.2 g L-1 yeast extract. Final cell concentration was determined by measuring optical density at 620 nm.
Strain motility was assessed using growth media supplemented with 0.3% agar as described previously [36].

Three separate cell cultures of each strain were analysed in
triplicate.
Differential protein expression analysis
T. arsenivorans and Thiomonas sp. 3As strains were grown
in MCSM and m126, respectively, with or without 2.7
mM As(III). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (7 K g,
10 min, 4°C). Cell lysis was performed as described previously [37]. Proteins were precipitated using the 2-D
Clean-up kit (Amersham Biosciences) and resuspended in
rehydratation buffer (364 g L-1 thiourea, 1000 g L-1 urea,
25 g L-1 CHAPS, 0.6% (v/v) IPG buffer Pharmalyte, 10 g L1 DTT and 0.01% (w/v) bromophenol blue). Protein concentration was determined using the 2-D Quant kit
(Amersham Biosciences).

Three hundred μg of this extract were loaded onto an 18
cm pH 4–7 IPG strip using the cup-loading technique
(manifold, GE Healthcare Biosciences, Australia). IEF was
conducted using the IPGPhor system (10 min at 150 V, 10
min at 500 V, 10 min at 1,000 V, 1.5 h at 4,000 V, and 4
to 5 h at 8,000 V, total = 50 kVh; GE Healthcare Biosciences, Australia). The second dimension was performed on 11.5% SDS-PAGE, using the EttanDAlt system
(GE Healthcare Biosciences, Australia). Gels were stained
with Colloidal Brilliant Blue (CBB), and digitised using an
Image Scanner (Amersham Pharmacia) and the LabScan
software (v 3.0, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Differential protein expression analysis was performed using the
ImageMaster 2D platinum software (v. 6.01, GE Healthcare Biosciences, Australia), as previously described [37].
Only spots with a Student's-t value greater than 2 (P value
less than 0.05) and ratio greater than 2 were analysed. The
selected spots were cut from the 2D-gel. Destaining,
reduction/alkylation steps by the liquid handling robot
QuadZ215 (Gilson International, France) and analyses by
MALDI-TOF were performed as previously described [37].
Tryptic mass searches retained only data with up to one
missed tryptic cleavage and optional methionine oxidation, with mass accuracy limited to 50 ppm. If necessary,
unidentified proteins were subjected to Nano LC-MS/MS
analysis. The resulting digest solution was diluted 1:4 into
Nano HPLC solvent A (97.9% H2O, 2% ACN and 0.1%
(v/v) HCOOH). The digested proteins were analysed

using a CapLC capillary LC system (Waters, Altrincham,
UK) coupled to a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Q-TOF
Micro, Waters). Diluted sample (5 μL) was first loaded,
concentrated and cleaned up onto a C18 PepMap precolumn cartridge (LC Packings) and then separated on-line
by the analytical reversed-phase capillary column
(NanoEase C18, 75 μm i.d., 15 cm length; Waters) with a
200 μL min-1 flow rate. The gradient profile used consisted
of a linear gradient from 97% A (97.9% H2O, 2% ACN
and 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH) to 95% B (98% ACN, 1.9%
H2O and 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH) for 45 min followed by a
linear gradient to 95% B for 3 min. Internal calibration
was assumed by the Lockspray module (Waters) that
switches to a reference source (leucine enkephalin M2+ =
556.2551 m/z) every 10 seconds during the acquisition
run. The spray system (liquid junction) was used at 3.6
kV. Mass data acquisitions were piloted by MassLynx 4.0
software (Waters). Nano-LC-MS/MS data were collected
by data-dependent scanning, that is, automated MS to
MS/MS switching. Fragmentation was performed using
argon as the collision gas and with a collision energy profile optimised for various mass ranges of ion precursors.
Four ion precursors were allowed to be fragmented at the
same time. Mass data collected during a NanoLC-MS/MS
analysis were processed automatically with the ProteinLynx Process (Waters) module. Data analysis was performed with Mascot (Matrix Science Ltd., London, U.K.)
against the in-house Thiomonas sp. 3As protein database
with carbamidomethylation (Cys), oxidation (Met), 0.25
Da mass error and one miss cleavage. All identifications
were incorporated into the "InPact" proteomic database
developed previously http://inpact.u-strasbg.fr/~db/[38].
Molecular microbiology
DNA was extracted and purified from liquid cultures of
pure isolates using the Wizard genomic DNA extraction
kit (Promega, U.S.A.). The 16S rRNA genes were amplified
by PCR using the 27f:1492r primer pair [39]. A 743 ntlong fragment of the rpoA gene of each organism was
amplified using the rpoAf2a:rpoAr2a primer pair (GGBGTGSTCCACGARTAY and GCRAGSACTTCCTTRATYTC,
respectively). The aoxAf:aoxABr primer pair (TGYACCCAYATGGGMTGYCC and CSATGGCTTGTTCRGTSASGTA,

respectively) were used to amplify 1451 nt of the aoxA and
aoxB genes, including the short (~27 nt) intragenic region.
The generic arsBf:arsBr primer pair (GGTGTGGAACATCGTCTGGAAYGCNAC and CAGGCCGTACACCACCAGRTACATNCC, respectively) were designed to amplify
between 740 and 760 bp of both copies of the arsB gene
in all Thiomonas strains. Following subsequent analysis,
arsB1- and arsB2-specific internal forward and reverse
primers were designed. The arsB1i2f:arsB1i2r primer pair
(TGGCGTTCGTGATGGCNTGCGG
and
CACCGGAACACCAGCGSRTCYTTRAT, respectively) amplified
268 bp of the arsB1 gene, whereas the arsB2i2f:arsB2i1r
primer pair (TGGCCGTGGCCTGTTYGCNTTYYT and
ACCCAGCCAATACGAAAGGTNGCNGGRTC,
respectively) amplified 417 bp of the arsB2 gene. Virtual digestions of the arsB1 and arsB2 genes of strain 3As suggested
that the two genes should be differentiated by restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using the
restriction enzyme RsaI.
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned using the ClustalX alignment programme [40]. SuperGene analysis was performed by concatenating the 16S rRNA and rpoA gene sequences of each
organism, to improve the phylogenetic analysis as proposed recently [41]. Neighbour-Joining trees were constructed using ClustalX, with bootstrap values determined
from 1000 replications. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees
were constructed using the PhyML algorithm [42]. The
ModelGenerator programme [43] was used to select the
optimal nucleotide substitution model for ML analysis.
Bootstrap values were determined from 500 replications.
A list of sequences generated during this study and their
GenBank Accession IDs can be found in Table 3.
