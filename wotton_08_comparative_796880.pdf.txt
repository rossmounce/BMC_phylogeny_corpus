Abstract
Background: Lbx/ladybird genes originated as part of the metazoan cluster of Nk homeobox genes.
In all animals investigated so far, both the protostome genes and the vertebrate Lbx1 genes were
found to play crucial roles in neural and muscle development. Recently however, additional Lbx
genes with divergent expression patterns were discovered in amniotes. Early in the evolution of
vertebrates, two rounds of whole genome duplication are thought to have occurred, during which
4 Lbx genes were generated. Which of these genes were maintained in extant vertebrates, and how
these genes and their functions evolved, is not known.
Results: Here we searched vertebrate genomes for Lbx genes and discovered novel members of
this gene family. We also identified signature genes linked to particular Lbx loci and traced the
remnants of 4 Lbx paralogons (two of which retain Lbx genes) in amniotes. In teleosts, that have
undergone an additional genome duplication, 8 Lbx paralogons (three of which retain Lbx genes)
were found. Phylogenetic analyses of Lbx and Lbx-associated genes show that in extant, bony
vertebrates only Lbx1- and Lbx2-type genes are maintained. Of these, some Lbx2 sequences evolved
faster and were probably subject to neofunctionalisation, while Lbx1 genes may have retained more
features of the ancestral Lbx gene. Genes at Lbx1 and former Lbx4 loci are more closely related, as
are genes at Lbx2 and former Lbx3 loci. This suggests that during the second vertebrate genome
duplication, Lbx1/4 and Lbx2/3 paralogons were generated from the duplicated Lbx loci created
during the first duplication event.
Conclusion: Our study establishes for the first time the evolutionary history of Lbx genes in bony
vertebrates, including the order of gene duplication events, gene loss and phylogenetic
relationships. Moreover, we identified genetic hallmarks for each of the Lbx paralogons that can be
used to trace Lbx genes as other vertebrate genomes become available. Significantly, we show that
bony vertebrates only retained copies of Lbx1 and Lbx2 genes, with some Lbx2 genes being highly
divergent. Thus, we have established a base on which the evolution of Lbx gene function in
vertebrate development can be evaluated.

Background
Ladybird/Lbx proteins are part of a clustered set of Nk
transcription factors, which encompass the Nk4 protein
tinman/Nkx2, the Nk3 protein bagpipe/Nkx3, ladybird/
Lbx, C15/Tlx, and the Nk1 protein slouch/Nkx1 [1-4]. In
protostome genomes, NK genes are organised into a cluster, which, along with the molecular phylogeny of Nk
homeodomains, indicates that they originated via tandem
duplications [2]. Indeed, the NK gene cluster is believed to
be ancient, with aspects predating the divergence of
sponges, cnidarians and bilaterians [5]. In deuterostomes,
however, tight clustering has been lost with only Nkx4/
Nkx3 and Lbx/Tlx linkages remaining in the cephalochordate amphioxus and in vertebrates [3].
Lbx genes have essential roles in development, including
crucial functions in neural and mesodermal cell specification. In mammals and amphibians, Lbx1 controls the emigration of specialised, motile muscle precursors that give
rise to limb and hypoglossal/tongue muscles, respectively
[6-9]. In mouse embryos, Lbx1 is also required for the
specification of several populations of dorsal spinal cord
interneurons, which receive and process somatosensory
information from the body [10-13]. Moreover, Lbx genes
with a similar spinal cord expression pattern to mouse
have been described in chick, zebrafish and the spotted
dogfish and, in the case of zebrafish and chick, these genes
are also expressed in muscle [14-16]. Interestingly, in Drosophila melanogaster, a protostome whose ancestors split
from the deuterostome lineage over 500 million years
ago, two tandem-duplicated ladybird/Lbx family members
exist (ladybird early and ladybird late) that are also
expressed in developing muscle and neural tissue and are
required for the specification of subpopulations of myoblasts and neural cells [1,17]. Thus, Lbx genes may have
evolutionarily ancient functions in muscle and neural
development.
Despite the intriguing similarities of some ladybird/Lbx
genes, significant differences become apparent when considering all of the members of the Lbx family in different
vertebrates. For example, mammals, including humans,
have two Lbx genes [2] as does the chicken [15,18],
whereas Danio rerio has three Lbx genes (this report), and
the genome sequencing project for Xenopus tropicalis has
so far only revealed one Lbx gene (this report). In addition, the expression pattern of mammalian Lbx2 is distinct
from that of Lbx1 (Lbx2 is expressed in the urogenital system, eye and brain) [19], whereas the two chicken Lbx
genes and all zebrafish genes are co-expressed in migratory muscle precursors (K. R. Wotton and S. Dietrich,
unpublished data). Yet the second chicken Lbx gene is not
expressed in neural tissues [15,18] while all three of the
zebrafish genes are, albeit in distinct regions (K. E. Lewis,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/171

unpublished data). Consequently, the evolutionary and
functional relationship of ladybird/Lbx genes is not clear.
It is generally believed that at the base of the vertebrate
lineage, the entire genome was duplicated twice (2R
hypothesis; [20]). This was followed by a further genome
duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage at the base of the
teleost radiation [21-23]. In all chordate relatives of vertebrates investigated so far, such as the urochordates Oikopleura dioica and Ciona intestinalis and the cephalochordate
Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus), only a single lbx gene
has been found [3]. It is, therefore, safe to assume that
prior to the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication,
only a single Lbx gene existed.
One prediction of the 2R hypothesis is that a 4:1 ratio of
genes should have been present in an ancestral vertebrate
when compared to their invertebrate relatives. However,
with gene duplicates carrying redundant functions, many
of these four copies (called ohnologs to indicate that they
are paralogs that have originated by a process of wholegenome duplication – see [24,25]) were lost. Yet, despite
considerable interest in Lbx gene function in extant vertebrates, orthologies between Lbx genes have not been
established. Therefore, it is not known whether different
vertebrate lineages have lost the same, or different, Lbx
ohnologs. This raises two alternative hypotheses for the
differences that have been observed between vertebrate
Lbx genes.
1. Different vertebrate lineages have retained different Lbx
ohnologs with distinct expression patterns and/or functions
2. The same Lbx ohnologs have been maintained in all
vertebrates with differences in expression or function
being due to more recent neo- and/or sub- functionalisation.
To distinguish between these possibilities, we have used a
number of bioinformatics approaches to characterise the
organisation of Lbx loci in extant osteichthyan vertebrates
and to determine the relationship of Lbx genes and genes
associated with Lbx loci. Our studies identified non-NK
genes that were acquired by Lbx/Tlx region(s) prior to, or
during, the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication
and that hence, serve as signature genes for these loci.
With the help of these signature genes, the remnants of all
four Lbx/Tlx paralogons (eight in teleosts) were identified.
Phylogenetic analyses of Lbx, Tlx and the co-localising
non-Nk genes revealed that the first round of whole
genome duplication in vertebrates created the ancestor of
the Lbx1/Tlx1 and Lbx4/Tlx4 clusters plus the ancestor of
the Lbx2/Tlx2 and Lbx3/Tlx3 clusters. After the second
genome duplication, Lbx and Tlx genes were lost, such

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:171

that before the split of the ray-finned and lobe-finned fish
lineages only Lbx1/Tlx1, Lbx2/Tlx2 and Tlx3 genes were
maintained. Gene loss also occurred after the additional
genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage, leaving
teleosts (including zebrafish and pufferfish) with two
Lbx1 and Tlx3 genes but only one Lbx2, Tlx1 and Tlx2
gene. Since the amniote Lbx2 genes diverge much more in
their coding sequences than the Lbx1 genes and the
expression pattern of mouse Lbx2 is distinct from nonmammalian Lbx2 genes, we propose that amniote (or possibly sarcopterygian) Lbx2 genes have evolved at a faster
rate and were subject to neofunctionalisation. Lbx1 genes
on the other hand may have retained more features of the
original chordate lbx gene.

Results
Identification of Lbx genes in extant Osteichthyes
To reconstruct the phylogeny of vertebrate Lbx genes we
first attempted to identify the complete set of these genes
in representatives of extant Osteichthyes. For this, BLASTsearches of sequence databases were carried out, using the
known human and mouse Lbx1 and Lbx2, chicken Lbx1
and Lbx3, Xenopus laevis Lbx1 and zebrafish Lbx1
sequences as query sequences [1,2,4,9,14,15,18,19]. To
obtain outgroups for these phylogenetic analyses, we also
searched the databases for lbx/ladybird sequences in
invertebrate deuterostomes, including the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus), the urorchordates Oikopleura dioica and Ciona intestinalis, and the
echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea
urchin); moreover we included sequences from various
protostomes. Our search confirmed the presence of two
distinct Lbx genes in placental mammals and marsupials
(human, mouse, dog, cattle, opossum), one Lbx gene in
the still incompletely sequenced platypus and Anole lizard genomes, and two Lbx genes in the chicken. Only one
Lbx gene was found for the frog Xenopus tropicalis. On the
other hand, besides the gene so far known as zebrafish
lbx1 [14], two novel lbx genes were identified in this
organism. Three Lbx genes were also identified in the teleosts Takifugu rubripes (fugu), Tetraodon nigroviridis, Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback), and two genes in Oryzias
latipes (Medaka), while only one lbx/ladybird gene was
retrieved for the invertebrate deuterostomes.
Phylogenetic analysis of osteichthyan Lbx protein
sequences
To determine the evolutionary relationship between
osteichthyan Lbx genes, we first determined the phylogenetic relationship of Lbx proteins (Fig. 1). For this purpose, amino acid sequences were aligned and analysed,
using maximum likelihood methods. We found that the
vertebrate Lbx sequences were assigned to two distinct
groups. The first group encompassed the known human,
mouse, chicken and frog Lbx1 proteins. In addition, this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/171

group contained the two novel zebrafish Lbx proteins,
encoded by the genes located on chromosomes 13 and 1,
the fugu Lbx proteins whose genes are on scaffolds 52 and
62, the Tetraodon protein encoded by the Lbx gene on
chromosome 18, the stickleback proteins with genes on
groups VI and IX and the medaka protein encoded by the
gene on chromosome 1.
The second group contained all of the mammalian Lbx2
proteins, the chicken protein currently known as Lbx3, the
zebrafish protein so far named Lbx1 and encoded by the
gene on chromosome 14, together with the Lbx sequences
encoded by genes on fugu scaffold 70, Tetraodon chromosome 20, stickleback group IV and medaka scaffold 1066.
The division into two distinct groups of Lbx proteins was
supported by high bootstrap values. Our phylogenetic
analysis shows significantly longer branch lengths for the
amniote Lbx2 proteins, indicating that these Lbx2 genes
have probably evolved at a quicker rate than the Lbx1
genes. No evidence was found for distinct Lbx3/4 proteins.
Comparison of genomic Lbx loci in Osteichthyes
It is generally held that in the lineage leading to jawed vertebrates, two rounds of whole genome duplication
occurred, followed by a further genome duplication in the
lineage leading to teleosts [20-23,26]. Thus, theoretically,
if no gene loss has occurred, four Lbx genes should be
detectable in extant tetrapods and eight in teleost fish.
However, our phylogenetic analyses suggest that only two
Lbx genes were retained after the second vertebrate
genome duplication and before the genome duplication
in ray-finned fish. To confirm these results and to further
analyse the orthology of the various vertebrate Lbx genes,
we compared the organisation of genes associated with
the vertebrate Lbx loci, reasoning that orthologous Lbx
genes would share a similar chromosomal environment,
while paralogous genes would exhibit a distinct arrangement of the locus (see [27-29] for examples).

Since the human genome information is the most accurate and complete, we began by recording the genes that
according to the NCBI Map Viewer database are located in
the environment of human LBX1 and 2 genes (Fig. 2).
Subsequently, we looked for remnants of the LBX3 and 4
loci, initially by searching the human genome for paralogues of the genes co-localising with LBX1 and 2. We
then identified and determined the arrangement of genes
characteristic for each of these four paralogons in the
genomes of other mammals, the chicken, the frog Xenopus
tropicalis and the five teleosts (Fig. 3 and additional file 1).
Lbx loci in humans
Human LBX1 has previously been mapped to chromosome 10, 1.7 Mb distant from NKX2.3 [2,4]. LBX1 is

sequences. Dark grey boxes indicate orthologous groups while light grey boxes indicate gene linkage. Bootstrap values below
70 have been removed. Only two Tetraodon Lbx proteins are included as the third sequence (found on scaffold 8483) is incomplete. Note that the Lbx sequences separate into two clear groups, Lbx1 and Lbx2, which are supported by bootstrap values of
79 and 83 (boxed), respectively. The chicken protein previously denoted as Lbx3 [18], the zebrafish protein previously
denoted as Lbx1 [14] and one of the fugu, Tetraodon, stickleback and medaka sequences group with mammalian Lbx2

tightly linked to the related Nk-type homeobox gene TLX1
(Fig. 2 and Additional file 1). This is followed by the
Kazal-type serine peptidase inhibitor domain 1 gene
KAZALD1, the LOXL4 gene encoding a Lysyl oxidase like
protein and the SLIT1 gene encoding an axon guidance
molecule. Moving in the opposite direction, LBX1 is
linked to a Beta-transducin repeat containing gene
(BTRC1, a F-box and WD repeat domain 11 type gene),
the DNA polymerase lambda gene (POLL), the Deleted in
a mouse model of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia gene

(DPCD), the F-box and WD repeat domain containing 4
gene (FBXW4), the Fibroblast growth factor 8 gene
(FGF8), the Nucleophosmin 3 gene (NPM3), the Meningioma expressed antigen 5 gene (MGEA5), the gene
encoding a Kv channel interacting protein 2 (KCNIP2),
and further away, the gene encoding the Lim domain
binding protein LDB1 and the NKX1.2 gene (Figs 2 &3).
Human LBX2 has been mapped to chromosome 2, and is
linked to TLX2 ([2,4]; Fig. 2). Neither of these genes are

Human paralogons of the LBX/TLX cluster loci
Figure 2
Human paralogons of the LBX/TLX cluster loci. Schematic representation of the four human LBX/TLX paralogons plus
paralogous genes occurring at the NKX3.2 locus, deduced from analysis of the human genome using NCBI map viewer Homo
sapiens Build 36.2 (September 2006). Genes are represented by boxes with gene names appearing above and gene subfamilies
indicated by numbers inside. Letters on the far left indicate paralogon designation, while chromosomal locations are indicated
on the far right. Numbers between genes are approximate intergenic distances in Kb. Background shading indicates paralogous
genes. Blue and red dots indicate sites of inversions. Note that LOXL1, AUP1 and PCGF1 genes appear only at the LBX2 locus
and KAZALD1, POLL, DPCD, FBXW4 and MGEA5 appear only at the LBX1 locus. BTRC, FGF, NPM and KCNIP genes are linked
with LBX and TLX genes at more than one locus, suggesting that these genes were acquired by the LBX/TLX cluster during or
before the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication. Also note that a KCNIP4 and a SLIT2 gene are associated with
NKX3.2 on chromosome 4. A KCNIP3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome2, however at a distance to LBX2, suggesting that it is not an original component of the LBX2 paralogon.

associated with other NK genes, suggesting that they have
translocated from their original cluster [2,3]. LBX2 and
TLX2 are separated by the PCGF1 gene, which encodes a
polycomb group ring finger. Facing away from PCGF1 and
TLX2, LBX2 is linked to genes that encode Dynactin subunit 1 (DCTN1) and the Tetratricopeptide repeat protein
31 (TTC31). TLX2 on the other side is flanked by the
DEAQ box 1 (DQX1) gene which encodes for an ATPdependent RNA helicase, the gene encoding Ancient ubiquitous protein 1 (AUP1), the HTRA1 gene which encodes
for a high temperature requiring serine protease, the
LOXL3 gene, DOK1 which encodes for the Docking downstream of Tyrosine kinase 1 protein, and a gene encoding
the uncharacterised protein NP620159.2. Thus, the
human LBX1 and LBX2 loci are quite distinct (Fig. 2).
However, they both harbour TLX genes, in line with the
idea that Lbx and Tlx genes were linked in the original
bilaterian cluster of Nk-type homebox genes [2,3]. Moreover, both LBX loci include LOXL genes.
In humans, a further TLX gene exists 1.4 Mb distant from
NKX2.5 on chromosome 5, thought to be a remnant of
the third cluster of NK genes, which, after the second ver-

tebrate genome duplication, lost its cognate LBX gene
([3]; Fig. 2, Additional file 1). Investigating the organisation of this former LBX3/TLX3 locus, we found that TLX3
is on one side linked to the gene that encodes for Ranbinding protein 17 (RANBP17, a member of the Exportin
protein family), the gene encoding for the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABRP), a further KCNIP gene,
KCNIP1, the Lymphocyte cytosolic protein gene LCP2, the
Forkhead transcription factor gene FOXI1, the Dedicator
of cytokinesis gene DOCK2, the coil-coil domain encoding CCDC99 gene, followed by SLIT3. On the other side,
TLX3 is linked to NMP1, FGF18, FBXW11/BTRC2, and further away from the TLX3 gene, NKX2.5, MSX2 and DOK3.
The order of NMP1, FGF18 and FBXW11/BTRC2 is
reversed compared to the paralogous genes at the LBX1/
TLX1 locus. However, it is remarkable that for both the
LBX1/TLX1 and LBX3/TLX3 paralogons, the NPM and FGF
genes are closely linked, separated by sequences of only 5
and 9 kb, respectively. Taken together, our data suggests
that Kcnip, Fbxw11/Btrc2, Slit, Loxl, Dok and the closely
associated Fgf-Npm genes are hallmarks of Lbx/Tlx loci.

Genomic organisation of human LBX/TLX cluster paralogons and putative orthologous counterparts
Figure 3
Genomic organisation of human LBX/TLX cluster paralogons and putative orthologous counterparts. Genomic organisation of human (Hs)
Lbx/Tlx paralogons and the putative orthologous counterparts identified in Mus musculus (Mm), Xenopus tropicalis (Xt), Gallus gallus (Gg), Danio rerio (Dr),
Tetraodon nigroviridis (Tn) and Takifugu rubripes (Fr). For simplicity, only three teleosts are included in this figure: additional data for Oryzias latipes (medaka)
and Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback) can be found in additional file 1. The main genes characteristic of each paralogon are included in the figure; additional genes and linked genes found further away can be found in additional file 1. Schematic representations of the orthologous genomic regions are
depicted in panels 1–4, which correspond to human paralogons 1–4 in figure 2. Gene orthology is indicated by colour code and was inferred from molecular phylogenetics (see additional files). Genes appearing in more than one orthologous region are underlined. Numbers at the ends of each line indicate
chromosome (chr) or scaffold (s) numbers. A parallel red line marks gaps in the sequence, while triple black lines indicate large intergenic distances. Blue
dots mark sites of inversions, red arrows the end of a contig. Boxes off-line represent genes for which genomic sequences are incomplete; where no chromosome or scaffold number is given, no linkage data is available. In some cases, "missing" genes can be found on different scaffolds or chromosomes. This
data is shown in additional file 1. In addition, we do not show the dispersed 2nd teleost Lbx2 paralogon that no longer contains an Lbx or Tlx gene, but this
information is included in additional file 1. The genes our phylogenetic analysis identified as Lbx1 are found in a similar genomic environment, linked to
orthologs of the genes present at the human LBX1/TLX1 locus. In addition, non-mammalian Lbx1 genes are linked to the Slc2a15 gene not found at any
other Lbx locus. Lbx2 genes are linked to Loxl3, Aup1 and Pcgf1 genes (genomic information incomplete for chicken and frog), while Tlx3 genes are linked to
the orthologs of human KCNIP1, NMP1, FGF18 and BTRC2. In teleosts, Fgf24 and Npm4 are part of the Lbx2 locus, while in all species examined, Fgf17 and
Npm2 are no longer linked to Lbx/Tlx genes.

To identify remnants of the fourth LBX locus, we searched
the human genome for additional, linked KCNIP, BTRC/
FBXW11, SLIT, LOXL, DOK and FGF-NPM sequences. No
further homologues of BTRC/FBXW11 genes were identified. However, we found:
- FGF17 and NPM2 closely linked to DOK2 and about 1.8
Mb distant from LOXL2, NKX2.6 and NKX3.1 on chromosome 8, which also carries NKX6.3

- Linked KCNIP4-SLIT2 genes 7.7 Mb distant from
NKX3.2 on chromosome 4
- KCNIP3 on the long arm of chromosome 2, however
20.9 Mb distant from and hence probably not a genuine
part of the LBX2-TLX2 region.
A previous report suggested that LBX2/TLX2 may once
have belonged to the NKX2.6-NKX3.1 region on chromosome 8 [3]. However, the presence of LOXL and DOK

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:171

genes at both the LBX2 locus and the NKX2.6-NKX3 locus
is not consistent with this idea. KCNIP4-SLIT2 were found
linked to the Prominin gene PROM1, so far not associated
with LBX/TLX loci. However, as KCNIP3 is also linked to
PROM2, this suggests that Prom genes may once have
belonged to Lbx/Tlx containing regions. Taken together,
these observations suggest that the LBX2/TLX2 region may
have originated from the NKX3.2 containing cluster on
chromosome 4, while FGF17-NPM2 linked to LOXL2 and
DOK2 represent the remnants of the fourth LBX/TLX
region associated with NKX2.6 and 3.1 on chromosome
8.
Lbx loci in other mammals
Investigating the arrangement of genes at Lbx loci in additional placental mammals (mouse, dog and cattle), a marsupial (opossum) and a monotreme (platypus), we found
that the loci are arranged in the same fashion as in
humans (Fig. 3, Additional file 1 and data not shown).
The exception is the platypus Lbx2/Tlx2 locus, whose existence could not be confirmed as genes linked to this paralogon in other mammals were found on short, unlinked
and poorly characterised DNA fragments. Moreover, in
mouse and Monodelphis, Prom2-Kcnip3 are not on the
same chromosome as the Lbx2 locus, supporting the idea
that these genes secondarily intercalated into the Lbx2 carrying chromosome in the lineage leading to humans.
Lbx loci in the chicken
As the information on the chicken genome is still fragmentary, the localisation of chicken Lbx genes could not
be determined with certainty. However, chicken chromosome 6 contains a region that is syntenic with the LBX1
region on Human chromosome 10, encompassing
Kazald1, Tlx1, Btrc, Poll, Dpcd, Fbxw4, Fgf8, Nmp3, Mgea5
and Kcnip2 in the same order as the human genes (Fig. 3).
Loxl4, Slit1 and further genes located in the wider environment of the mammalian Lbx1 locus were also identified,
with gene groups displaying a similar arrangement in the
chicken and in mammals (Additional file 1). Furthermore, we identified sequences 300 bp upstream and 2.2
kb downstream of the two Lbx1 exons, which are conserved between the mammalian Lbx1 loci and the putative
chicken Lbx1 site; in the chicken these regions flank a
region that has not been fully sequenced yet (data not
shown). Thus, it is likely that this area on chromosome 6
indeed harbours the Lbx1 gene. As will become relevant
below, in the chicken the Btrc1 gene is separated from the
Poll gene by the Slc2a15 gene (our name) encoding a solute carrier (Fig. 3).

The Lbx2-type gene so far named Lbx3 [18] is situated on
a short contig not assigned to a chromosome (Fig. 3).
However, Aup1, Htra2, Loxl3, the gene encoding
NP620159.2, together with a further Mgea gene, were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/171

found on the so far poorly-characterised contig 242
assigned to chromosome 4; all genes are arranged in the
same order as the corresponding genes at the Lbx2/Tlx2
containing region of mammalian chromosomes (Fig. 3;
Additional file 1). Moreover, separated by sequence gaps,
these genes are linked to the Dctn1 gene, which is downstream of Lbx2 in mammals. Significantly, this chromosome also carries genes associated with the NKX3.2 locus
in humans, adding weight to the hypothesis that Lbx2
genes were once associated with this particular NK cluster.
Tlx3 was found on chicken chromosome 13 in a region
syntenic with the TLX3 containing region of human chromosome 5 and grouped with Fbxw11/Btrc2, Fgf18, Npm1,
Ranbp17, Gabrp, Kcnip1, Foxi1, Lcp2, Dock2, Ccdc99 and
Slit3 in the same fashion as mammalian Tlx3. In agreement with this being the third Lbx/Tlx paralogon, other
members of the NK cluster associated with this paralogon
are also found on chick chromosome 13 (Additional file
1).
Finally, a representative of Fgf17 could not be identified,
but Npm2, Dok2 and Loxl2 were found on chromosome
22, in a region syntenic to the FGF17-NPM2 region on
human chromosome 8 and linked to Nkx2.8 and 6.3 (Fig.
3 and Additional file 1). Notably, this region is also linked
to Prom2, a gene in mammals associated with Kcnip3
(Kcnip3 was not found in the chicken). This finding supports the idea that Kcnip3-Prom2 are not an original component of the Lbx2/Tlx2 paralagon but instead probably
belong to the fourth Lbx/Tlx paralagon.
Lbx loci in Xenopus tropicalis
In the frog, both Lbx1 and the Kazald1, Tlx1, Btrc, Poll,
Dpcd, Fbxw4, Fgf8, Nmp3, Mgea5 and Kcnip2 genes typical
for the amniote Lbx1 locus were found on scaffold 238
(Fig. 3 and Additional file 1). As in the chicken, the
Slc2a15 gene was located between Btrc and Poll, suggesting
that the solute carrier gene was present in the original Lbx1
locus and was lost from this location in the lineage leading to mammals.

A Tlx2 gene was found on the scaffold 2223, but this scaffold does not contain any further genes associated with
Lbx/Tlx paralagons (Fig. 3 and Additional files). Similarly,
an isolated Pcgf1 gene was found on scaffold 47. Searches
for Loxl3 and Aup genes were unsuccessful. Thus, the existence of a Lbx2/Tlx2 locus could not be determined. However, linked Tlx3, Gabrp, Kcnip1, Foxi, Dock2 and Ccdc99
genes were found on scaffold 313, suggesting that a Lbx3/
Tlx3 locus exists in frogs (Fig. 3).
As in chicken, we did not find a Xenopus tropicalis ortholog
of Fgf17, but we detected Npm2 and Dok2 on scaffold 34,
linked to each other and arranged in the same order as the

Page 7 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:171

corresponding genes surrounding human and chicken
Npm2. Notably, as in amniotes, these genes are also linked
to Nkx6.3 (Additional file 1). Moreover, scaffold 30 contains linked Loxl2, Nkx3.1, Nkx2.6, Prom2 and Kcnip3
genes, which in amniotes, with the exception of Prom2Kcnip3 that have translocated to a different chromosome
in placental mammals, are linked to Fgf17, Npm2, Dok2
and Nkx6.3 (Additional file 1). Taken together, this suggests that all of these genes belong to the same Nkx3.1, 2.6
and 6.3 containing cluster.
Lbx loci in teleost fish
For teleosts, we expected to find chromosomal arrangements corresponding to that of tetrapods, if, in line with
our analysis of Lbx proteins, only two Lbx bearing loci
were present prior to the genome duplication in the rayfinned fish lineage. Alternatively, if in teleosts Lbx3 and
Lbx4 genes were maintained, they should be embedded in
distinct loci, with Lbx3 next to Tlx3, Kcnip1, Npm1, Fgf18
and Btrc2 and/or Lbx4 near to Fgf17 and Npm2.

We found for the two novel Lbx1-type teleost genes that
the organisation of their gene loci fell into two classes. The
genes on zebrafish chromosome 13, Tetraodon scaffolds
8483 and 13770, fugu scaffold 52 and stickleback group
VI are surrounded by Tlx1 (sequence incomplete for
Tetraodon), Slc2a15, Fbxw4 and Fgf8, thus bearing the hallmarks of the tetrapod Lbx1/Tlx1 locus (Fig. 3 and additional files). The same arrangement of genes was found on
medaka chromosome 15, with a sequence gap at the place
where the lbx gene is expected to be. Significantly, in all of
these teleosts the order of genes is identical to that of the
equivalent tetrapod genes, with the exception of an inversion between the Tlx1 and Fgf8 region (Figure 3). The Lbx
genes on zebrafish chromosome 1, Tetraodon chromosome 18 (sequence incomplete), fugu scaffold 62, stickleback group IX and medaka chromosome 1 are linked to a
second Slc2a15 gene, and to Poll, Dpcd and a second Fgf8type gene (there is a sequence gap at the position of the
Fgf8 gene in Tetraodon), thus also bearing hallmarks of the
tetrapod Lbx1/Tlx1 locus (Fig. 3 and additional files). Both
stickleback and medaka loci are accompanied by Kcnip2
and Mgea5 genes; for stickleback group VI and medaka
chromosome 15, these genes are also associated with
Npm3 and Slit1, while linked Npm3-Mgea5 genes were
found on zebrafish chromosome 13. Moreover, all of the
teleost Lbx1-type loci are associated with gene groups
found in the wider environment of Lbx1 loci in amniotes
(Additional file 1). Taken together, these findings support
the idea that all of these fish have two Lbx1/Tlx1 paralogons, although in many cases there has been reciprocal
gene loss following the teleost-specific whole genome
duplication

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/171

For the third of the teleost Lbx genes, namely the gene currently known as zebrafish Lbx1 on chromosome 14 and
the Lbx genes on Tetraodon chromosome 20, fugu scaffold
70, stickleback group IV and medaka scaffold 1066, we
found an environment reminiscent of the mammalian
Lbx2 locus, with the Lbx genes being separated from a Tlx
gene by Pcgf1 (Fig. 3). The exception is the medaka scaffold 1066, which is a short fragment that only contains
the Lbx and Pcgf genes. Different from that of mammals,
an Fgf24-Npm4 gene set was found between the Lbx and
Tlx genes. In the wider environment of the Lbx-Pcgf1Fgf24-Npm4-Tlx gene set, we found two types of arrangement (Additional file 1). On zebrafish chromosome 14,
the genes are associated with Aup1 and Loxl3, reminiscent
of the mammalian Lbx2/Tlx2 paralagon. The genes on
fugu scaffold 70, Tetraodon chromosome 20 and stickleback group IV, are associated with Nanos1, Limch1,
Phox2b, Tmem33, Bbs7, Anxa5, Fgfbp, Prom1, Tapt1, Ldb2
(Lbx1 side) and Adad1, Spata5, Ankrd50, Leprot1, Srp72,
Arl9, Hop, Sec24B (Tlx side); the ultracontigs 115 and 117
and chromosome 10 of medaka harbour the same genes
in the same order. Notably, the genes surrounding the
Lbx-Pcgf-Fgf-Npm-Tlx group in fugu, Tetraodon, stickleback
and medaka are also found on zebrafish chromsome 14,
while Aup1 is found on stickleback group IV and medaka
chromosome 10 (Additional file 1), i.e. all of these genes
were located in the wider environment of the Lbx-Pcgf-FgfNpm-Tlx locus. Taken together, our data suggest that,
despite substantial gene rearrangements, these chromosomal regions in teleosts are Lbx2/Tlx2 paralogons. Interestingly, the genes closely associated with fugu, Tetraodon,
stickleback and medaka Lbx2, including the Fgfbp-Prom1Tapt1-Ldb2-Anxa5 genes, are linked with the Nkx3.2 locus
on human chromosome 4 and chicken chromosome 4,
consistent with our proposal that the mammalian Lbx2
genes were originally part of the Nkx3.2 cluster (additional file 1).
Searching for remnants of the second teleost Lbx2 paralagon, we found Loxl3, a further Nanos1 gene and Ttc31
on Tetraodon chromosome 10, fugu scaffold 338, stickleback group XV and medaka chromosome 22. Dok1NP620159.2-Sema4f genes were found on Tetraodon scaffold 7074, fugu scaffold 186, stickleback group VII and
medaka chromosome 18; in stickleback and medaka these
genes were also linked to Kcnip4-Gba3-Gpr125, which in
tetrapods co-localise with Nkx3.2 (Additional file 1; the
scaffolds were too short to determine whether this linkage
also exists for fugu and Tetraodon). Finally, at a distance
from the second Lbx1 locus on zebrafish chromosome 1,
Tetraodon chromosome 18, fugu scaffold 17, stickleback
group IX and medaka chromosome 1, we found Slit2 and
a second group of Fgfbp-Prom1-Tapt1-Anxa5 genes linked
to Fbxw7, which in humans are all associated with the
LBX2 locus. Thus, it seems that the second teleost Lbx2

Page 8 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:171

paralagon has dispersed, with parts having translocated to
one of the Lbx1 carrying chromosomes.
For Tlx3 genes, two types of arrangements were identified
(Additional file 1). On zebrafish chromosome 14, fugu
scaffold 160, Tetraodon chromosome 1, stickleback group
IV and medaka chromosome 10, i.e. inserted into the Lbx2
containing chromosome, Tlx3 is on one side linked to
Kcnip1, and on the other linked to the Hrh2 gene encoding
a Histamine receptor, Dock2 and, slightly more distant,
Fgf18 and Fbxw11. On zebrafish chromosome 10, fugu
scaffold 6, Tetraodon chromosome 7, stickleback group VII
and medaka chromosome 14, Hrh2 is linked with Kncip1,
Npm1 and in the case of zebrafish, Tlx3b, Fgf18 and
Fbxw11, suggesting that remnants of the two Tlx3 loci created by the teleost-specific genome duplication still exist.
Finally, searching for additional Btrc, Prom, Loxl, Slit, Dok,
Kcnip, and Fgf-Npm genes as indicators of other possible
Lbx/Tlx paralogons, we identified linked Npm2-Dok2Fgf17 genes on zebrafish chromosome 8, linked Fgf17Loxl2-Kcnip3 genes on stickleback group XIII, and linked
Kcnip3-Loxl2-Dok2 genes on Tetraodon chromosome 12
and medaka chromosome 9. A second set of linked
Kcnip3-Loxl2-Dok2 genes was identified on zebrafish chromosome 10 and a second set of Loxl2 and Kcnip3 genes in
a conserved environment but split between two chromosomes were also identified for the other four fish species.
Notably, additional genes were also identified that colocalise with Loxl2, Dok2, Kcnip3, Fgf17 and Npm2 genes
both in teleosts and tetrapods, including orthologs of
Nkx2.6 (Additional file 1 and data not shown), supporting the idea that all these genes once belonged to the same
locus, which in tetrapods still encompasses Nkx 2.6, 3.1
and 6.3.
Phylogenetic relationship of signature genes for Lbx/Tlx
paralogons
Characterising Lbx/Tlx loci in tetrapods, we found evidence for three distinct paralogons, with the possibility of
Fgf17-Npm2 representing the remnant of the fourth. In teleosts, the arrangement of Lbx1/Tlx1 and Tlx3 genes closely
follows the pattern observed in tetrapods. However, the
putative teleost Lbx2/Tlx2 paralogon (genes currently
named Lbx1 and Tlx3a in zebrafish) includes additional
Fgf-Npm genes. Moreover, all of the teleosts except
zebrafish show a somewhat divergent organisation of
genes in the chromosomal regions surrounding the Lbx2/
Tlx2 loci. Furthermore, the duplicate Lbx2 paralogon and
the two Fgf17-Npm2 paralogons are poorly preserved in
teleosts. Therefore, to further confirm the evolutionary
relationship of the Lbx loci and our assignment of genes to
specific paralogons, we carried out a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences encoded by the
genes in the various Lbx/Tlx regions. For this, we BLAST-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/171

searched sequence databases for related sequences and
built phylogenetic trees which included various invertebrate outgroups (Additional file 2).
Phylogenetic relationship of genes co-localising with
several Lbx paralogons
Btrc/Fbxw11, Mgea, Kazald, Ldb and Prom genes occurred at
two, Tlx, Loxl, Slit and Dok genes at three and Kcnip, and
the linked Fgf-Npm genes at four putative Lbx loci in tetrapods. If our assignment of Lbx/Tlx paralogons is correct,
then the genes that we have assigned to particular paralogons should group together. In addition, if the fundamental lay-out of Lbx/Tlx paralogons was established in
vertebrates before the divergence of lobe-finned and rayfinned fish and the additional genome duplication in the
ray-finned fish lineage, then the teleost protein sequences
should group with the tetrapod proteins. If, however, distinct Lbx/Tlx loci were maintained in the lineage leading to
lobe-finned fish/tetrapods and ray-finned fish/teleosts,
then our phylogenetic analysis should reveal additional
groups of genes.

With the exception of Dok2 sequences, which seem to
have become highly diverged, all of our analyses supported our assignment of the different Lbx/Tlx paralogons
(discussed in detail in Additional file 2). Notably, our
analyses of Ldb and Prom1 genes also support our model
that the tetrapod Lbx2 loci was originally located in the
Nkx3.2 containing cluster: the Ldb2 sequences, which are
associated with Lbx2 in teleosts and with the now Lbx-less
locus carrying Nkx3.2 in tetrapods group together, as do
the Prom1 genes which are linked to Ldb2-Tapt-Anxa5
genes and hence, to the current plus the dispersed Lbx2
and Nkx3.2 loci (Fig 3). In addition, our analyses of
Prom2, Tlx, Kcnip, Fgf and Npn genes shows that orthologues associated with the Lbx1 and Lbx4 paralogons are
more closely related to each other than to orthologues
associated with the Lbx2 and Lbx3 paralogons and vice
versa. This is most informative for the genes where four
paralogues are still linked to potential Lbx loci in extant
vertebrates (Fgf, Npm and Kcnip genes). In these cases, we
found that Kcnip1 and Kcnip4 genes are more closely
related to each other than to Kcnip2 and 3. Similarly, Fgf8
sequences are closely related to Fgf17 sequences, and
Fgf24 sequences are closely related to Fgf18. Finally, the
Npm3-Npm2 and Npm4-Npm1 sequences are more
closely related to each other, respectively (Additional file
2). Taken together, this suggests that the Lbx1/4 paralogons and the Lbx2/3 paralagons arose from different
ancestral Lbx loci generated during the first vertebrate
genome duplication.

Discussion
Ladybird/Lbx genes are crucial regulators of metazoan neural and muscle cell specification [6-9]. Yet before this

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:171

study, it was difficult to evaluate the basic role of Lbx genes
in vertebrate development and evolution, as it was unclear
exactly how many Lbx genes exist in different vertebrates
and how these genes are phylogenetically related to each
other. The 2R hypothesis predicts that early in the vertebrate lineage, four ohnologs were generated for each gene
in the genome; for teleosts, descendants of ray-finned fish,
a further genome duplication should have produced eight
gene copies [3,20-23,26,30-38]. However four ohnologs
are seldom found in vertebrate genomes, suggesting that
gene loss has played an important part in genome evolution. In recent years, two Lbx genes were identified in
amniotes, one in frogs and one in the teleost Danio rerio
[1,2,9,14,15,18,19]. One of the amniote Lbx genes and
the Lbx genes identified in frog and zebrafish had been
reported to be Lbx1 genes, while the second of the amniote Lbx genes had been suggested to represent distinct
Lbx2 (mammals) and Lbx3 genes (birds) with rather divergent expression and function [18,19]. This suggested that
Lbx1, 2 and 3 genes were retained in amniotes up to the
split of mammalian and avian lineages, while despite
their additional genome duplication ray-finned fish
seemed to have experienced a near-complete extinction of
Lbx genes. However, previous Lbx gene assignments were
sometimes based on limited sequence comparisons, and
neither a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis nor a comparative genomic analysis of vertebrate Lbx genes had
been carried out. Therefore, it remained unclear whether
more Lbx genes had yet to be found and whether these
genes were survivors of Lbx1, 2, 3 or 4 genes.
In this study, we searched vertebrate sequence databases
for Lbx genes and determined their phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, we investigated the organisation of Lbx
gene loci, identified signature genes linked to these loci
and established the phylogenetic relationships of these
genes. Our study confirms the existence of two Lbx genes
in amniotes, while only one Lbx gene was found, thus far,
in Xenopus tropicalis. However, we were able to detect
novel Lbx genes in teleosts. Yet, we found no species with
the predicted set of four (lobe-finned fish lineage) or eight
(ray-finned fish lineage) Lbx genes. Thus, in all bony vertebrates, some Lbx genes have been lost. Nevertheless,
tracing the signature genes linked to different Lbx loci, we
were able to identify remnants of all four Lbx paralogons
in tetrapods and all eight Lbx paralogons in teleosts. However, only Lbx1 and Lbx2-type loci retained Lbx genes; no
evidence for surviving Lbx3 or Lbx4 genes was found. With
cognate tetrapod and fish paralogons displaying a high
degree of similarity, this suggests that Lbx3 and 4 genes
were lost before the split of the lobe-finned and rayfinned fish lineages. Finally, our phylogenetic and synteny
analyses revealed that Lbx-associated genes in Lbx1-Lbx4
paralogons and in Lbx2-Lbx3 paralogons, respectively, are
more closely related. This suggests that Lbx1 and Lbx4 par-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/171

alogons originated from one, and Lbx2 and Lbx3 paralogons from the other, parental paralogon generated
during the first round of vertebrate genome duplication.
Two novel Lbx genes were identified in teleosts
Our searches of genomic databases identified two novel
Lbx genes in zebrafish, and three Lbx genes in Takifugu
rubripes (fugu), Tetraodon nigroviridis and Gasterosteus
aculeatus (stickleback). Oryzias latipes (medaka) carries
two Lbx genes, with a sequence gap at the expected position of the third. Taken together, this suggests that teleosts
share the same set of 3 Lbx genes.

Phylogenetic analyses grouped the two novel zebrafish
Lbx proteins, two of the three fugu, Tetraodon and stickleback proteins and one of the medaka proteins with the
tetrapod Lbx1 sequences. Conversely, the zebrafish protein currently known as Lbx1, the remaining fugu, Tetraodon, stickleback and medaka sequences and the chicken
protein so far called Lbx3 all grouped with the mammalian Lbx2 sequences. The bipartite separation of Lbx
sequences was supported by high bootstrap values, suggesting that in all extant Osteichthyes, only Lbx1 and Lbx2
type genes were maintained, with teleosts harbouring
duplicates of Lbx1.
Traces of four Lbx loci were identified in tetrapods
Prior to the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication,
the NK clusters broke up and non-NK genes were acquired
by these loci ([3] and this study). Our analysis shows that
tetrapod Lbx1 is invariantly linked to Tlx1, Kazald1, Btrc,
Slc2a15, Poll, Dpcd, Fbxw4, Fgf8, Npm3, Mgea5, Kcnip2,
Ldb, Loxl4 and Slit1 with Slc2a15 being lost in mammals.
The assignment of Lbx2-type genes was more problematic,
due to incomplete sequence information for chicken and
frog. For mammals however, Lbx2 was found linked to
Tlx2, Pcgf1, Aup1, Loxl3 and Dok1, and linked Loxl and Aup
genes were also identified for chicken (distribution of signature genes for Lbx loci shown in Table 1).

The linking of Lbx with Tlx genes was not unexpected,
given its maintenance in the otherwise fragmented
amphioxus nk cluster [3]. Yet tetrapods harbour a third Tlx
gene, suggesting that a third, previously Lbx3-containing
paralogon still exists [39-41]. Indeed, tetrapod Tlx3
sequences form a phylogenetic group distinct from Tlx1
and Tlx2 sequences, supporting the idea that this gene did
not arise from a single gene duplication event. Moreover,
Tlx3 loci share the same organisation amongst tetrapods
and encompass Btrc2, Fgf18, Npm1, Kcnip1, and Slit3,
which according to our phylogenetic analysis are paralogues of the genes found at the Lbx1 site. Thus, while
Lbx3 itself was lost from the Tlx3 locus, a number of genes
that must have been acquired by the Nk cluster prior to

tetrapods. Genes found associated with Lbx2 loci in fish match genes in amniotes distributed between the Lbx2 locus and the Lbx-free Nkx3.2 locus,
suggesting that the amniote Lbx2 locus once belonged to the Nkx3.2 containing Nk cluster. Genes in bold: genes that supported by high bootstrap
values are more related to each other than to other paralogues, suggesting that the Lbx1 and Lbx4 loci evolved from one and the Lbx2 and Lbx3 from
the other of the paralogons generated during the first round of vertebrate genome duplication.

the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication are still
present.
Using the previously identified signature genes linked to
the Lbx/Tlx loci as query sequences, we also identified
remnants of the fourth Lbx paralogon. Interestingly, both
the Lbx1/Tlx1 and the Tlx3 locus contain closely linked
Fgf-Npm genes, and an additional pair of tightly linked
Fgf-Npm genes, namely Fgf17 and Npm2, was found in
mammals, linked to Dok2, Loxl2, Nkx3.1 and 2.6. Linked
Loxl2-Dok2-Npm2 sequences were also found in the
chicken genome, and in the frog, linked Dok2-Npm2 genes
and Loxl2-Nkx3.1-Nkx2.6 genes were found on two, possibly neighbouring scaffolds. In some tetrapods the Loxl2Nkx3.1-Nkx2.6 genes were also linked to Prom2 and
Kcnip3. This suggests that Prom2-Kcnip3 initially belonged
to the fourth Lbx paralogon that contains Fgf17-Npm2 as
well as Dok2-Loxl2-Nkx3.1-Nkx2.6 genes, while the placement of Prom2-Kcnip3 on the same chromosome but at a
distance to Lbx2 in humans, cattle and dog (but not

mouse) is probably a result of a more recent transposition
event. In summary, presence of a number of signature
genes for Lbx loci linked to Nkx2.6 and Nkx3.1 suggests
that this region is the ancestral home of the lost Lbx4-Tlx4
genes.
Duplicates of the four tetrapod-type Lbx loci were
identified in teleosts, with two Lbx1 genes and one Lbx2
gene still present
In teleosts, the two novel, putative Lbx1 genes were found
in two types of genomic settings, both of which contained
signature genes for the tetrapod Lbx1 locus. Genes that
occurred at only one of the novel teleost Lbx sites formed
monophyletic groups with their tetrapod counterparts.
Importantly, Slc2a15 and Fgf8 genes, which were found at
both of the teleost loci as well as the tetrapod Lbx1 sites,
also formed single groups, indicating that the two novel
Lbx loci in teleosts arose from a common Lbx1-containing
ancestor. Consequently, tetrapod Lbx1 genes and the two
novel teleost Lbx genes are orthologs.

Similar to the Lbx1 paralogons, the relationship of the
now Lbx-less Tlx3 loci could readily be established. Teleosts harbour one locus containing Slit3, Kcnip1, Tlx3,
Fgf18 and Btrc2 genes in the same order as found at the
tetrapod Tlx3 site, with the exception of Tetraodon whose
Slit3 gene intercalated between Kcnip1 and Fgf18. Notably, this Tlx3 locus is found on the same chromosome, but
with different integration sites, as the gene we propose to
rename Lbx2, suggesting extensive transposition between
Lbx/Tlx loci in teleosts. The second Tlx3 locus contains
Kcnip1-Npm1 and in zebrafish also Tlx3b, plus a second
copy of Fgf18 and Btrc2. Further shared genes were found
in the environment of the tetrapod and teleost Tlx3 loci;
genes at these sites, including the Tlx genes themselves,
grouped together in our phylogenetic analyses. This suggests that teleost Tlx3 and Tlx3b are orthologs of the tetrapod Tlx3 genes. The high degree of locus conservation also
suggests that the basic lay out of this Tlx3 paralogon,
including the elimination of Lbx3, was established prior to
the teleost-specific genome duplication.
In the zebrafish, the gene currently known as lbx1 but
placed with mammalian Lbx2 in our phylogenetic analyses was found in a genomic environment bearing the hallmarks of the mammalian Lbx2 locus, being linked with
Pcgf1, a Tlx gene currently named Tlx3a, Aup1 and Loxl3.
These genes formed monophyletic groups with the cognate genes at the mammalian Lbx2 locus, with teleost
Tlx3a grouping with mammalian Tlx2. This suggests that
this locus is indeed a Lbx2 paralogon. In fugu, Tetraodon,
stickleback and medaka, the third Lbx gene was also
linked to Pcgf1 and a Tlx2-type gene, although Aup was
located at a distance or in case of Tetraodon, on a different
chromosome. The latter seems to be a result of a secondary rearrangement of the locus, as aup is linked to lbx in
amphioxus and hence, was part of lbx loci before the split
of cephalochordate-vertebrate lineages (aup and lbx are
both found on Scaffold 294 of the Branchiostoma floridae
v1.0 genome at the JGI. See Availability and requirements
section for URL). Nevertheless, all of the teleost Lbx2 loci
encompassed a Fgf24-Npm4 set between Pcgf1 and Tlx2.
Moreover, genes associated with Prom1 and directly
linked to fugu, Tetraodon, stickleback and medaka Lbx2
were found in the same order in the wider environment of
the zebrafish Lbx-Pcgf1-Tlx set. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these genes are orthologs, suggesting that the
teleost Lbx2 loci are variations on the same theme.
In fugu, Tetraodon, stickleback and medaka, the Lbx2 gene
was directly adjacent to Nanos1, which is not linked to the
mammalian Lbx2 gene. In mammals on the other side, the
Lbx2-Pcgf1-Tlx2 set was flanked by Ttc31 and Loxl3-Dok1Np620159.2-Sema4f. Yet in these four teleosts, a second
Nanos1 gene was identified, linked to Loxl3, Dok1,
Np620159.2, Sema4f and Ttc31. Moreover, a duplicate of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/171

the Prom1-linked gene set was found at the same site. A
similar arrangement of genes was also detected in the
zebrafish, distributed however between two chromosomes and with individual genes missing from the set.
Phylogenetic analyses grouped the genes with the cognate
genes at the mammalian and teleost Lbx2-bearing sites,
suggesting that this location is the second, now Lbx2/Tlx2less Lbx2 paralogon in teleosts. As will become relevant
below, this locus encompassed Slit2, Kcnip4 and Fbxw7,
associated with the Lbx-free Nkx3.2 locus in tetrapods.
Establishing whether teleosts carry duplicates of the possible fourth Lbx paralogon was more problematic as unfortunately, some of the genes suggestive of this paralogon
(namely Fgf17, Npm2, Dok2, Loxl2, Prom2, Kcnip3) reside
on rather small scaffolds and hence, linkage could not
always be established. However, all five teleosts harboured two sets of Loxl2-Kcnip3 genes. One of the sets was
associated with Dok2 and in stickleback, also with Fgf17.
Moreover, Npm2-Dok2-Fgf17 were found together on
zebrafish chromosome 8. Phylogenetic analyses grouped
Fgf17, Npm2, Loxl2, Kcnip3 genes with their namesakes
from tetrapod genomes. This suggests that, although less
well preserved, two copies of the putative fourth Lbx paralogon still exist in extant teleosts.
The mammalian Lbx2 locus has translocated from the NK
cluster containing Nkx3.2
Previous studies of human Nk genes showed that remnants of two Nk clusters have been preserved, with chromosome 10 carrying LBX1 and TLX1 linked to NKX2.3
and NKX1.2, and chromosome 5 carrying TLX3 linked to
NKX2.5 [3]. More partial remnants of two further Nk clusters have also been identified, one on chromosome 8 with
NKX2.6 and NKX3.1 and one on chromosome 4 with
NKX3.2 and NKX1.1. However, no LBX or TLX genes are
linked to these regions.

A previous study, based primarily on the human genome,
proposed that the Nkx2.6, 3.1 and 6.3 paralogon (located
on human chromosome 8) might be the ancestral location of Lbx2 and Tlx2 (now located on human chromosome 2) [3]. By a process of elimination, this would
further suggest that Lbx4 and Tlx4 were lost from the
NKX3.2 paralogon (currently located on human chromosome 4). Consistent with this hypothesis, paralogs of a
few genes (Kcnip, Prom, Add, Adra2) are represented at
both the Lbx2 and the Nk3.2 loci in mammals, suggesting
that these two loci have derived from separate Lbx/Tlx paralogons. However, phylogenetic analysis of these gene
families shows that the mammalian genes linked to the
Lbx2 loci group with frog, chicken and/or teleost genes
associated with Fgf17 and Npm2 loci (see phylogenetic
analysis and discussion in Additional file 2). This suggests
that these genes may have translocated to the mammalian

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:171

Lbx2 loci from the putative 4th Lbx/Tlx paralogon (e.g. the
genes now on human chromosome 2 may have originally
been linked to the Tlx/Lbx paralogon now on human chromosome 8).
Consistent with this second interpretation our data suggests that the ancestral location of the LBX2/TLX2 paralogon now located on human chromosome 2 was the
NKX3.2 paralogon on human chromosome 4 (as shown
in Fig. 3). The evidence for this is several fold. Firstly, we
have identified four distinct Fgf and Npm genes, with Fgf8Npm3 demarcating Lbx1/Tlx1 loci, Fgf18-Npm1 the Tlx3
loci, Fgf24-Npm4 the preserved teleost Lbx2/Tlx2 locus and
Fgf17-Npm2 genes associated with tetrapod and teleost
Nkx2.6-3.1-6.3 genes. Secondly, paralogous Loxl and Dok
genes are present at both the Lbx2 locus and the Nkx2.63.1-6.3 locus, suggesting that these two loci have evolved
from different paralogons. Thirdly, amniote orthologs of
genes associated with the two teleost Lbx2 loci such as
Fbxw7, Ldb2, Prom1, Slit1 and Kcnip4 co-localise with
Nkx3.2, and these amniote and teleost genes fall into the
same phylogenetic groups. Fourthly, the Lbx2 locus is still
associated with Nkx3.2 genes in teleosts, and possibly,
also in the chicken (the signature genes linked to the Lbx2
locus are assigned to chromosome 4, but their position is
not determined). All together, this strongly suggests that
the mammalian Lbx2-Tlx2 locus was once located in the
Nk cluster containing Nkx3.2 and that Lbx4 and Tlx4 were
lost from the Nkx2.6-3.1-6.3 paralogon that contains fgf17
and npm2.
Lbx4-Tlx4 were lost prior to the third genome duplication
in ray-finned fish
If the assignment of Lbx2-Tlx2 to the Nkx3.2 carrying Nk
cluster is correct then, as discussed above, the Nk cluster
containing Nkx2.6, 3.1 and 6.3 (and fgf17 and npm2) is
the former location of the Lbx4-Tlx4 paralogon. This idea
is supported by the presence of a number of signature
genes for Lbx loci at this site. Moreover, genes at this locus
do not group with paralogues accompanying other Lbx
loci; most notably, the Fgf-Npm and Kcnip genes located
here constitute distinct phylogenetic groups. Taken
together, this suggests that different to Lbx2-Tlx2 genes,
Lbx4-Tlx4 genes did not translocate to another chromosome. Rather, they were lost from this fourth NK cluster.
Significantly, both teleosts and tetrapods retained a similar set of genes from this locus. This indicates that the
basic lay-out of the paralogon, including the elimination
of its Lbx and Tlx genes, was probably established in an
ancestor of the Osteichthyes (i.e. prior to the split of the
lobe-finned and ray-finned fish lineages).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/171

Lbx loci in extant vertebrates arose from Lbx1/4 and
Lbx2/3 precursors
Our study shows that of the genes associated with Lbx-Tlx
loci, Fgf, Npm and Kcnip genes still exist in four copies,
inferring that indeed, the original chordate locus was
duplicated twice in the lineage leading to vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that Fgf8 genes found in the
Lbx1/Tlx1 paralogon and Fgf17, found in the Lbx4/Tlx4
paralogon, are more closely related than Fgf24 found in
the intact teleost Lbx2/Tlx2 paralogon and Fgf18 found in
the Lbx3/Tlx3 paralogon. Similarly, Npm4 (teleost Lbx2/
Tlx2 paralogon) and Npm1 (Lbx3/Tlx3 paralogon) are
closely related to each other, distinguished from Npm1
(Tlx3 paralogon) and Npm4 (teleost Lbx2 paralogon), A
similar grouping was found for Kcnip genes, with Kcnip1
(Tlx3 paralogon) and Kcnip4 (teleost Lbx2 and tetrapod
Nkx3.2 loci) being the most closely related. This pair-wise
grouping is supported by high bootstrap values and suggests that during the second vertebrate genome duplication, Lbx1 and Lbx4 paralogons arose from one of the LbxTlx loci generated by the initial duplication event and Lbx2
and Lbx3 paralogons arose from the other duplicated
locus. Consistent with this model, Tlx2 and Tlx3 genes are
rather similar and are easily distinguished from the Tlx1
genes associated with Lbx1.
Basic roles of Lbx1 genes and neofunctionalisation of
mammalian Lbx2 genes
Our analysis shows that the organisation of orthologous
Lbx/Tlx paralogons is very similar in extant bony vertebrates, suggesting that the main compositions of the paralogons were established before the divergence of lobefinned and ray-finned fish. This infers that Osteichthyes
had only two types of Lbx genes. Expression analyses and
functional studies on Lbx1 type genes suggest that they all
play a role in dorsal spinal cord and muscle development
[6-16]. Interestingly, the zebrafish and chicken Lbx2 genes
are still expressed in muscle precursors, and zebrafish lbx2
is also expressed in the spinal cord [14,18]. In contrast,
mouse Lbx2 is not expressed in these regions, rather labelling the urogenital system, eye and brain [19]. Amniote
Lbx2 proteins also show the most divergent sequences.
This suggests that amniote (or potentially sarcopterygian)
Lbx2 genes have evolved at a faster rate than their anamniote (or non-sarcopterygian) orthologs, and undergone
neofunctionalisation. Other Lbx2 genes, however, may
have retained aspects of ancestral Lbx expression and function, which seems to be tied to the formation of specific
neural and muscle cell types.

Conclusion
We have identified remnants of all four Lbx/Tlx paralogons in extant bony vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses of
Lbx, Tlx and non-NK genes at these loci revealed that the
first round of whole genome duplication in vertebrates

A model4of the evolution of the vertebrate Lbx/Tlx loci
A model of the evolution of the vertebrate Lbx/Tlx loci. Lbx loci in extant vertebrates arose from a region containing an
Lbx, Tlx, Fgf8/17/24/18 and an Npm gene. After one round of whole genome duplication (1R WGD) Lbx1/4 and Lbx2/3 precursors were produced linked to Fgf8/17 – Npm2/3 and Fgf24/18 – Npm4/1 precursors, respectively. During the second round of
whole genome duplication (2R WGD), four loci where produced. By the time of the divergence of the lobed-fined and rayfinned fish, the Lbx4, Tlx4 and Lbx3 genes (shown in grey) had been lost.

created the ancestor of the Lbx1/Tlx1 and Lbx4/Tlx4 paralogons and the ancestor of the Lbx2/Tlx2 and Lbx3/Tlx3
paralogons (Fig. 4). After the second genome duplication,
Lbx and Tlx genes were lost, such that before the split of
the ray-finned fish/teleost and lobe-finned fish/tetrapod
lineages only Lbx1/Tlx1, Lbx2/Tlx2 and Tlx3 genes were
maintained. In the ray-finned fish lineage, genome duplication and subsequent gene loss left teleosts with two
Lbx1, one Lbx2 and two Tlx3 loci. Since the amniote Lbx2
genes show divergent amino acid sequences and expression patterns, we propose that these Lbx2 genes have been
evolving at a faster rate and were subject to neofunctionalisation. Lbx1 genes on the other hand may have retained
more features of the original chordate lbx gene.

Methods
Regions surrounding the human LBX/TLX cluster loci
were searched using NCBI Map Viewer build 36.2. To
identify further paralagous genes, BLAST searches with
putative protein sequences were conducted against the
human genome, and putative positive targets were further
characterised by molecular phylogenetics to resolve
orthologous and paralagous relationships. Each of the
genes from the putative human paralogons was cross-referenced by BLAST against the following NCBI genome
assemblies; Mus musculus (build 37.1), Gallus gallus (build
2.1) and Danio rerio (Zv6) on NCBI map viewer. The Xenopus tropicalis (v4.1) and fugu rubripes (v4.0) genomes were
searched at the Joint Genome Institute genome portal,
and the Tetraodon nigroviridis (v8), Oryzias latipes
(MEDAKA1) and Gasterosteus aculeatus (BROAD S1)
genomes were searched via the Ensembl server. Putative
target sequences were further analysed by molecular phylogenetics, to establish orthologous and paralogous relationships and to reaffirm our original classification of
human sequences. For molecular phylogenetic analyses,
protein sequences were first aligned, (with invertebrate
outgroup sequences included where possible) using Clus-

talX and edited by eye [42]. Phylogenetic analyses were
then carried out using maximum likelihood implemented
by ClustalX [42], and by PHYML [43,44].
