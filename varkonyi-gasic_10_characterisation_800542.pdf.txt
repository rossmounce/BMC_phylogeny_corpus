Characterisation of microRNAs from apple (Malus
domestica ’Royal Gala’) vascular tissue and
phloem sap

Abstract
Background: Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that play an important role in
development and environmental responses. Hundreds of plant miRNAs have been identified to date, mainly from
the model species for which there are available genome sequences. The current challenge is to characterise
miRNAs from plant species with agricultural and horticultural importance, to aid our understanding of important
regulatory mechanisms in crop species and enable improvement of crops and rootstocks.
Results: Based on the knowledge that many miRNAs occur in large gene families and are highly conserved among
distantly related species, we analysed expression of twenty-one miRNA sequences in different tissues of apple
(Malus x domestica ’Royal Gala’). We identified eighteen sequences that are expressed in at least one of the tissues
tested. Some, but not all, miRNAs expressed in apple tissues including the phloem tissue were also detected in the
phloem sap sample derived from the stylets of woolly apple aphids. Most of the miRNAs detected in apple
phloem sap were also abundant in the phloem sap of herbaceous species. Potential targets for apple miRNAs were
identified that encode putative proteins shown to be targets of corresponding miRNAs in a number of plant
species. Expression patterns of potential targets were analysed and correlated with expression of corresponding
miRNAs.
Conclusions: This study validated tissue-specific expression of apple miRNAs that target genes responsible for
plant growth, development, and stress response. A subset of characterised miRNAs was also present in the apple
phloem translocation stream. A comparative analysis of phloem miRNAs in herbaceous species and woody
perennials will aid our understanding of non-cell autonomous roles of miRNAs in plants.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of endogenous, non-coding, short transcripts that play important regulatory roles in plants and animals [1-3]. They
often occur in large gene families conserved between
distantly related species [4-6]. Approximately 20 families
of plant miRNAs are moderately to highly conserved
and nearly as many fall into the lowly conserved category [7]. In addition, there are many lineage- and species-specific miRNA families [8-11].

In plants, miRNAs repress gene expression by pairing
with near-perfect complementary sequences primarily in
the mRNA coding region to guide cleavage and translational repression [12-18]. The majority of known plant
miRNA targets encode developmentally important transcription factors [19] or other regulatory and stressresponse proteins [20-25]. Mutants impaired in miRNA
biogenesis exhibit severe abnormalities, and plants
ectopically expressing particular miRNAs or miRNAresistant versions of their targets exhibit a wide range of
phenotypes [26-30].
Plant miRNAs have been detected in a range of organs
and tissues of model plants and crop species and often
show differential expression among different tissues
[31-33]. In addition, miRNAs were detected in the
phloem sap of cucurbits [34], lupin [35] and oilseed

rape [36,37]. The role of phloem miRNAs is not yet
clear. While some miRNAs have demonstrated cellautonomous expression and effects [38-40], miRNAs in
the phloem may have a role in establishing gradients of
gene expression necessary for developmental patterning
and stress responses [32,41-43]. At least one phloem
miRNA has a demonstrated long-distance signalling role
in the regulation of the plant nutrient status [44,45].
Identification and characterization of miRNAs in both
tissues and the phloem sap thus becomes an important
step in developing a complete understanding of the regulation of transcription factors and other key regulatory
and stress-response genes.
One of the difficulties of studying the long-distance
signalling in plants is access to a true representation of
phloem cell contents. Various methods have been used
in the past to collect exudate from woody and herbaceous plants. The most common method has been to collect exudate from incisions in the bark of woody plants
[46] or to cut stems or petioles of herbaceous plants
that lack the typical rapid response to vascular damage
[47]. These exudation methods allow the collection of
samples enriched for the sieve element (SE) contents;
however, there is a high likelihood of contamination
with the contents of other cells that are damaged by
cutting. In addition to contamination from other cells,
incision in the vasculature leads to a rapid fall of turgor
pressure, a decrease in local water potential, an influx of
water, and dilution of the exudate [48]. The decreased
water potential may also cause solute influx from associated cells, such as companion cells and neighbouring
phloem parenchyma cells. Finally, rapid changes in pressure may result in release of the SE structural components that are otherwise not translocated in the intact
vasculature. The standard practice to minimise contamination is to discard the first drop of exudate from a vascular incision, which will reduce but not completely
eliminate the contamination from damaged cells [49]. In
contrast to exudation methods that are prone to contamination, phloem-feeding insects, such as aphids,
enable sampling of SE sap that is often referred to as
the gold standard for phloem, being purest and least
subject to sampling artefacts. Aphid stylectomy has been
used to detect and characterise proteins and to detect
specific mRNAs in the SEs of various plant species
[50-54]. Because of the size of the aphid stylet, there is
no major change in the pressure and water potential,
which in turn minimises water and solute fluxes that are
inevitable with incision-based sampling.
The aim of this study was to characterise miRNAs
from apple (Malus x domestica) and to determine which
miRNAs potentially translocate over long distances in
apple sieve tubes. To date, only a handful of apple miRNAs have been identified and their expression in

different apple tissues validated [55]. In this study, we
validate expression in apple tissues for eighteen out of
twenty-one tested miRNA sequences, some of them
shown to be conserved between various plant species
[56]. In addition, we test for the presence of miRNAs in
the apple SE sap obtained by aphid stylectomy and confirm the presence of a subset of miRNAs in the apple
phloem translocation stream. Further, we analyse
expression of potential targets for apple miRNAs.

Results
Conserved miRNAs are differentially expressed in apple
tissues

To establish that the majority of conserved miRNAs are
expressed in apple, eighteen miRNAs previously
detected in a number of species including Arabidopsis,
rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa),
one detected in Arabidopsis and poplar but not in rice,
and two that were reported to be specific for poplar,
were chosen for expression analysis in apple tissues
[8,20,57-60] (Table 1). Some miRNAs chosen for this
study occur in large gene families with identical and
nearly identical sequences. Nearly identical miRNA
sequences are given the appropriate miRNA number
and a letter suffix that distinguishes between sequences
with slight differences [61]. For practical reasons,
miRNA sequences with letter suffix ‘a’ were chosen.
These are often the most conserved and most abundant
sequences within the miRNA family that were identified
in early and relatively small-scale sequencing projects.
RNA gel-blot analysis was used to examine the expression of miR156, miR159, miR166, miR167 and miR172
in shoot apex, leaf and stem tissues. Positive signals of
expression were detected for most of these miRNAs in
either some or all of the tissues (Figure 1A). The relative
levels of expression were higher for miR159, miR166
and miR167 than for miR156 and especially miR172,
which was barely detectable. miR156 and miR159 were
expressed in all tissues tested, with miR156 expressed to
similar levels in all tissues, while miR159 levels were
somewhat lower in xylem than in other tissues tested.
High levels of miR166 expression were detected in the
shoot apex and periderm and low levels of expression
were detected in leaf, stem and phloem; miR166 was
not detected in the xylem. miR167 was highly expressed
in the shoot apex and leaf, had low levels of expression
in the stem, periderm and xylem and was not detected in
the phloem tissue. To establish that stem-loop reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can
be confidently used instead of gel-blot analysis, the
expression of the same subset of miRNAs was examined
using reactions carried out in a semi-quantitative manner
(Figure 1B). The results were comparable to those
obtained by RNA gel-blot analysis. Increased sensitivity

of this method allowed for detection of low levels of
miR172 expression across all tissues analysed. This
method confirmed high miR166 expression in periderm,
but could not detect any miR166 expression in the xylem
tissue, even when the number of PCR cycles was
increased from 28 to 35 (data not shown). Further, the
stem-loop RT-PCR expression analysis was extended to a
larger subset of conserved and poplar-specific miRNAs
(Figure 1C). The number of amplification cycles performed ranged from 28 to 33, in order to maintain the
semi-quantitative nature of PCR but minimise nonspecific amplification. All conserved miRNAs with the
exception of miR397 were detectable in some or all
examined apple tissues with up to 33 cycles of PCR. At
this number of cycles, no amplification or a weak band
of primer-dimers was obtained in minus-RT control
and water control reactions (data not shown). miR475
and miR476 could not be detected in any of the apple
tissues. Several miRNAs were expressed to similar levels
in all tissues tested, e.g. miR396 was highly expressed in
all tissues and miR162 showed moderate to low levels
of expression in all tissues; miR164 and miR393 were
barely detectable in the shoot apex, whereas miR160,
miR169 and miR390 were more abundant in the shoot
apex than other tissues; miR398, miR403 and miR408
appeared up-regulated in leaf. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed across the stem tissues: miR160

showed higher expression in the phloem than xylem
and was barely detectable in periderm; miR394 showed
higher expression in the xylem than phloem and was
barely detectable in periderm; miR168 was more abundant in periderm than phloem and xylem; miR171 was
absent from phloem but was detected both in periderm
and xylem.
Some apple miRNAs are abundant in the phloem tissue

Periderm, phloem and xylem tissues used for RT-PCR
were obtained by peeling the layers of the stem and therefore might contain contamination from adjacent cell
layers. To distinguish between cell layers, spatial expression of a subset of miRNAs was further analysed using in
situ hybridisation. Antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to miR156 and miR167 but not miR171 produced a
hybridization signal in the phloem of apple seedling stems
(Figure 2A-C). Some expression could also be detected
around the xylem. To address the universality of phloemassociated expression across species, Arabidopsis stems
were analysed by in situ hybridization. Similar phloem
expression for the same subset of miRNAs was detected in
the Arabidopsis inflorescence stem. Both miR156 and
miR167 antisense probes produced a strong hybridization
signal in the phloem (Figure 2D-E), while no signal was
detected with miR171 antisense oligonucleotide probe
(Figure 2F), consistent with the RT-PCR results. In

Small RNAs, including short interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
and miRNAs, were previously detected in the phloem
sap of herbaceous species obtained by exudation methods. To establish if small RNAs are present in the
phloem sap of woody perennials, woolly apple aphid stylectomy was used to obtain the apple SE content.
Woolly apple aphids feed by inserting their stylets into
the phloem tissue and sucking up the sap (Figure 3A).

aphid was radioactively labelled and visualised after

To establish which miRNAs are present in apple phloem
translocation stream, RNA purified from the sap derived
by aphid stylectomy was used as a template in stem-loop
RT-PCR analysis. Because of the very small amounts of
sap collected (less than 1 μl per aphid), each RT reaction
was performed once per sap collection and repeated two
more times for a subset of ten miRNAs using RNA from
different sap samples as template. The results between
these biological replicates were reproducible. Using this
approach miR156, miR159, miR160, miR162, miR167,
miR169, miR396 and miR398 were clearly detectable;

species, but some miRNAs detected in the phloem sap of
herbaceous species were not detected in apple phloem sap
(Table 2). This might be the result of contamination during
exudation sampling used for herbaceous plants, which is
more likely to occur with miRNAs highly abundant in the
vascular tissue. To establish the ratio of miRNA accumulation in the phloem sap and vascular tissue, stem-loop RTPCR expression analysis was performed using RNA purified
from pumpkin vascular bundle tissue and phloem sap
obtained by the exudation method. A large proportion of
miRNAs detected in apple phloem sap were also present in
pumpkin phloem sap at significantly higher levels than in
the vascular bundles. In contrast, miR171, miR394 and
miR403, which were absent from apple phloem sap, were
detected in pumpkin phloem sap at a lower level than in
the pumpkin vascular bundle. miR168 and miR408 were
not detected in the apple SE sample but were enriched in
the pumpkin phloem sap sample (Table 2).
Identification of potential apple miRNA targets

The majority of miRNA molecules chosen for this study
and the complementary sites within their mRNA targets
display a high degree of conservation between species
[62,63]. Thus, the apple expressed sequence tag (EST)
database was interrogated for the presence of putative
miRNA targets. Gleave et al. [55] previously reported

putative orthologues of SPL encoding genes as apple
miR156 targets, an apple ARF16 as a miR167 target,
orthologues of AP2 and TOE1 as miR172 targets and a
copper superoxid dismutase, MdCSD as a miR398 target. In addition to these sequences, putative orthologues
of class III HD ZIP transcription factor family were
identified from the Malus EST database and named
MdPHV, MdREV, MdHB8, and MdHB15 (Figure 5A).
The miR166 target sites are identical between apple and
Arabidopsis orthologous genes (Figure 5B) and are
highly conserved within plants, with only two nucleotide
differences within the whole gene family. Further, a
putative orthologue of Arabidopsis F-box protein that
contains a conserved miR394 target site was identified
and named MdF- box1. The Arabidopsis F-box and
MdF-box1 transcripts share the predicted miR394 complementary site that is almost a perfect reverse complement of miR394 (one mismatch only, Figure 5C). A
candidate for apple auxin response factor was also identified and named MdARF16. While it seems more closely related to Arabidopsis ARF16 and ARF10 proteins
(Figure 5D), the miR160 complementary site is identical
to that of Arabidopsis ARF17 transcript and is a perfect
reverse complement of miR160 with a single G/U pair
(Figure 5E). An apple NAC-domain protein coding
sequence MdNAC1 was identified as a potential miR164

Expression of miRNAs and corresponding target mRNAs

To establish the correlation between expression of apple
miRNAs and their corresponding targets, RT-PCR and
stem-loop RT-PCR were performed using stem tissue
RNA. Expression of miRNAs that degrade their target
mRNAs shows negative correlation with the respective
target mRNAs; they are expressed in adjacent spatial
domains and the role of miRNAs is to clear cells of
their target gene activities [64] and to maintain sharp
gene expression boundaries. Positive correlation is also
observed for some miRNAs and a quantitative role for
miRNAs was proposed in the reduction of the target
mRNA accumulation in cells and tissues that co-express
both [65,66]. Accumulation that was over five fold different between tissues was detected for miR166, miR394
and miR164, including total absence of miR166 from
xylem. Accumulation of their targets was either not
detected in case of miR164 (data not shown) or opposite
to that of their corresponding miRNAs, with undetectable or barely detectable accumulation of the target in
the tissue with the highest miRNA accumulation (Figure

6A). Differential accumulation of miRNA was detected
among tissues for miR167, miR160 and miR398 and
their respective predicted targets MdARF6, MdARF16
and MdCSD, but the target fold change was low (Figure
6B). Accumulation of MdSPL target transcripts varied
among tissues and was not obviously related to differential accumulation of miR156, as was the case for
miR172 and MdTOE1 (Figure 6C).

Discussion
Evolutionary conservation of miRNAs in apple

Mature miRNAs previously detected in Arabidopsis,
poplar and rice were also detected in apple tissues, with
the exception of miR397. The absence of miR397 detection in this study may be due to the limited set of vegetative tissues used, or growth conditions that prevent
miR397 accumulation, such as ample copper supply
[67]. It is also possible that the apple variant of miR397
has several mismatches to the miR397a sequence chosen
for this study and was therefore more difficult to detect
using the stem-loop RT-PCR method. Interestingly, the
precursor for this sequence could not be identified in
the Malus EST dataset [55]. A mature miR403, previously detected in Arabidopsis and poplar but not in
rice, was detected in apple shoot tip, leaf and all stem
tissues, confirming conservation between Rosales and

Brassicales orders within the Rosid eudicot clade and
suggesting that miR403 evolved more recently, after the
divergence of monocots and dicots.
Previously described miR475 and miR476 were identified in poplar as miRNAs targeting members of the PPR
family and potentially implicated in tree-specific miRNA
functions [8]. These sequences were not detected in
apple stem tissues, suggesting that these miRNAs
evolved quite recently, after the divergence of Malpighiales and Rosales orders within the rosid clade. Indeed,
only four similar sequences for miR475 and three similar sequences for miR476 can be found in the miRBase
database [68], and they are all identified in poplar. Alternatively, it is possible that the expression of these miRNAs commences in older plants, after substantial
secondary growth.
Phloem tissue and phloem sap are highly enriched for
specific miRNAs

Of eighteen miRNA sequences detected in at least one
of the analysed apple tissues, all except miR171 were
detected in the phloem tissue. Almost half could be
detected with fewer than 30 cycles of PCR, suggesting
they were relatively abundant in that tissue. These high
expression levels are likely to be the result of the abundance of the enzyme responsible for miRNA biogenesis,
DCL-1, in the vascular tissue [69].
A number of miRNAs have been previously identified
in the phloem sap of several herbaceous plants [34-37]
and miR399 was identified as a long-distance signal for
the regulation of plant phosphate homeostasis [44,45].
To the best of our knowledge, no data on phloemmobility of miRNAs were available for woody perennials
before this study. Furthermore, all data obtained to date
on herbaceous species were derived from exudates collected from cuts, incisions or punctures [70-72]. Phloem
sap collected in this manner may contain contamination
from outside cells.
The exudate derived from the detached stylets of sap
sucking insects such as aphids has been considered the
purest form of isolated phloem sap. Stylet exudate is
regarded as least subject to artefacts, compared with
phloem sap collected by other methods. Therefore, we
chose aphid stylectomy as our preferred phloem sap collection method for this study, using woolly apple aphid.
Woolly apple aphids feed from apple phloem tissue [73]
and their long-term feeding habit at one location and
their long stylet bundles facilitate the technology of collecting pure phloem exudates from apple plants (Figure
3A). This study demonstrates that apple phloem sap
contains small RNAs that are major contributors to the
phloem sap RNA population. Thus, we were able to
analyse the sap sample and demonstrate the presence of
specific miRNAs in the phloem sap.

Page 10 of 15

To establish further if presence in the phloem sap of a
particular miRNA was conserved across species, RNA
samples isolated from pumpkin phloem sap and vascular
tissue were subjected to stem-loop RT-PCR analysis and
the levels of expression were compared. Those miRNAs
with significantly higher levels detected in the phloem
sap than in the surrounding vasculature are more likely
to be non cell-autonomous. Similarly, miRNAs with
higher levels detected in the vasculature are more likely
to be cell-autonomous. Based on this assumption, more
than half the analysed miRNAs showed higher levels of
accumulation in the phloem sap. In particular, accumulation of miR156, miR167, miR169, miR390, and
miR398 was more than ten-fold higher in the phloem
sap than in the vascular tissue, suggesting a possibility
of an active mechanism regulating their presence in the
phloem sap. All these miRNAs were also detected in the
apple SE sample, suggesting some conservation in
miRNA non cell-autonomy across plant species. Similarly, miR171, miR394 and miR403, which were not
detected in apple phloem sap, were also less abundant
in the pumpkin phloem sap sample and, with the
exception of miR171, were not cloned from Brassica
napus phloem sap [37], implying conservation of cellautonomy for these miRNAs. Some exceptions suggest
differences in phloem-mobility of specific miRNAs
among species or possibly between herbaceous and
woody plants; in particular, miR168 and miR408 accumulated in the phloem sap of pumpkin and Brassica napus,
but could not be amplified from the apple phloem sap.
The role of miRNAs in the phloem sap

The presence of small RNAs, including specific miRNAs, in the SE raises the question of their role in the
phloem sap. There are two reasons why RNA might be
present in the SE. Firstly, some RNA molecules have a
role in long-distance signalling. Experiments demonstrating long-distance movements of mRNA through
grafted tissue support this role [70,71,74]. It is therefore
possible that some miRNAs also acquired a long-distance signalling role. Indeed, a demonstration of shootto-root transport and biological activity of shoot-derived
miR399 in roots is consistent with the role as a longdistance signal for the regulation of plant phosphate
homeostasis [44,45] and the graft-transmissible induction of potato tuberisation by miR172 implies its longdistance signalling role [75]. Secondly, RNA may be
dragged by the bulk flow of solutes from companion cell
to SEs and therefore reflect the gene expression in the
companion cell; for example, the thioredoxin and actin
mRNAs were detected in the SEs of rice [52], and a
sucrose transporter, an aquaporin, and a proton ATPase
mRNA were detected in the SEs of barley [53]. Therefore, miRNAs in the phloem might be accidental

Varkonyi-Gasic et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:159
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/159

outflow from companion cells. However, this hypothesis
is not supported by microinjection experiments that
exclude diffusion of small RNAs through plasmodesmata
and indicate that specific proteins are required to enable
transport of a small RNAs through plasmodesmata [34],
suggesting a highly regulated mechanism for small RNA
transport. In addition, not all miRNAs that were
detected in apple phloem tissue were found in the
phloem sap, possibly because their movement into the
phloem sap is actively prevented. It remains to be determined definitively whether our finding of miRNAs in
the apple phloem sap is the result of directed export. At
present, the mechanism by which these miRNAs enter
the SE and their role in this type of cells cannot be
determined. It may be, for instance, that miRNAs in the
phloem tissue and sap act to prevent translation and
movement of their mRNA targets, the majority of which
encode transcription factors, which would have detrimental phenotypic and developmental effects if transported long distance in the phloem. This would be
consistent with the finding that phloem sap RNA interferes with translation [76]. Indeed, to date neither of the
identified and confirmed miRNA target mRNAs has
been shown to move with the phloem across the graft
union.

Conclusions
Conserved families of miRNAs that target genes responsible for plant growth, development, and stress response
are differentially expressed in apple tissues. Some of the
predicted miRNA target transcripts had low abundance
in tissues where miRNAs were detected. Predicted targets of miRNAs detected in the phloem sap usually
showed only minor differences in expression levels
between tissues. A large proportion of the studied miRNAs are abundant in the phloem tissue and in the
phloem sap of both apple and several herbaceous species, with some exceptions suggesting differences in
phloem-mobility of specific miRNAs between species.
Methods
miRNA sequences

Plant miRNA genes were selected from the Sanger Institute miRBase Sequence Database at http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/index.shtml[68].
Plant material

Malus x domestica ’Royal Gala’ (apple) plants were
grown at 25 ± 2°C in a greenhouse under natural daylight conditions. A subset of apple seedlings (six months
old) was infected with woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma
lanigerum) and aphid stylectomy was performed once
the aphid colonies were established. Arabidopsis thaliana ’Columbia’ plants were grown at 23°C in a

Page 11 of 15

greenhouse under natural daylight conditions. Cucurbita
maxima ’Crown’ (pumpkin) plants were grown at 23°C
in a greenhouse under natural daylight conditions.
Plant tissue collection

Apple shoot apex, leaf, whole stem, and tissue enriched
for epidermis and cortex (periderm), phloem and xylem
were collected from six-month-old healthy apple seedlings. Periderm, phloem and xylem tissues were obtained
by peeling layers from the apple seedling stem. Pumpkin
vascular bundle tissue was obtained by peeling of stem
vascular strands.
Sieve element (SE) sap sampling and handling

Apple SE sap was collected from the stems of intact
apple seedlings using micro-cautery techniques to cut
the stylets of aphids feeding within the phloem [77].
Seedlings were selected that had aphid colonies feeding
from the stem following colonisation over three to four
weeks. As aphids colonised fresh tissue other than the
stem, they were removed. Just prior to sap sampling,
some aphids were also removed from the stem colony
until there were approximately 10 feeding aphids on the
stem tissue. Removing aphids allowed easier access to
the aphid stylets when cauterizing and reduced the sink
load on the sieve tubes applied by the feeding aphids.
The aphid stylets were cut using a micro-cautery unit
http://aphidzapper.com/. Once a stylet had been cut and
was freely exuding sap, a droplet of paraffin oil was
placed over the stylet. Great care was taken to ensure
the exuding sap remained supported solely by the cut
stylet and did not come into contact with plant or other
aphid material. The sap exudation rate was approximately 3-4 nL s-1 . The sap collected over the first 20
minutes was discarded, and then sap was collected over
the subsequent 1 to 8 h. The SE sample was collected
using a glass micropipette constructed using glass capillaries (1 mm O.D; WPI Inc, Sarasota, Florida, USA) and
a horizontal tip puller (Cat. No. 2001, Scientific and
Research Instruments Ltd, England). The tips of the
micropipettes were broken to a diameter of approximately 1-5 μm before being baked at 200°C for 24
hours, cooled, and then back-filled with paraffin oil. An
aliquot of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was
taken up into the micropipette prior to sap collection
and again at the end of sap collection. The collection
micropipette was replaced with a fresh paraffin oil- and
RNaseOUT-filled micropipette every 45-60 min. All collected sap/RNaseOUT mixture was then pooled into
one micropipette and stored at -80°C.
Pumpkin SE sap was collected from well-watered
plants using the stem exudation method. Stems were
excised with a sterile razor blade and the cut surface
was blotted three times with sterile filter paper (3 MM;

Whatman, Maidstone, UK). Phloem sap exuded thereafter was collected into microcentrifuge tubes containing
500 μL phenol or TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), by gently
touching the inner wall of the tube. The tube was closed
and vortexed well. Several drops were collected in the
same tube. The volume of phloem sap collected per
tube ranged from 200-400 μL.

analysis, an equal volume of Loading Buffer II (Ambion,
Austin, TX) was added and the sample heated at 94°C
for 5 min, followed by electrophoresis on 7 M urea/15%
PAGE gel, using 1x TBE (90 mM Tris-borate and 2 mM
EDTA) as running buffer. Gels were dried and analysed
using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare).
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR)

Purification of RNA from solid tissue and RNA gel blot
analyses

Apple total RNA was isolated from solid tissue as
described by [78]. The concentration of RNA was determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).
RNA gel blot analyses of low molecular weight RNA
were performed as previously described [34], with the
exception that hybridisation was performed at 40°C. The
sequences of the antisense and sense probes used for
hybridisation are presented in Additional file 2.
Purification of RNA from phloem sap

Apple phloem sap samples, each containing 0.3-0.6 μL,
were diluted to 50 μL using nuclease-free water. An equal
amount of phenol-chloroform mix (1:1) was added, the
sample was then vortexed, and then centrifuged (16,000 g)
for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was carefully transferred to a fresh tube, an equal volume of chloroform was
added and the sample was vortexed and then centrifuged as
described above. RNA was then precipitated using 1 volume
of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate,
with the addition of 20 μg of glycogen (Invitrogen). The
samples were subjected to centrifugation (16,000 g) for 60
min at 4°C. The RNA pellet was washed with 70% (v/v)
ethanol and resuspended in 2 μL of nuclease-free water.
Pumpkin phloem sap sample collected in 500 μL phenol was vortexed, followed by centrifugation (16,000 g)
for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was carefully transferred to a fresh tube, extracted with phenol-chloroform
mix, followed by chloroform and then precipitated as
described above. The RNA pellet was re-suspended in 10
μL of nuclease-free water and the RNA was quantified
using the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.
RNA radio-labelling and visualisation

RNA was treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, and subsequently endlabelled using the 5’ exchange reaction for 30 min at 37°
C [79], using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) with the supplied buffer to which was added
100 mM ADP, 2.5 nM ATP, and 165 nM [g-32P]ATP
(10 μCi/μL). Unincorporated 32P-label was removed
using ProbeQuant G-50 microcolumns (GE Healthcare,
formerly Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For RNA

Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using RNA
treated with DNase I (Invitrogen), an oligo(dT) primer
and the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequent polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed using the Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix
(Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Products were visualised by agarose gel electrophoresis
or quantified using real-time PCR, performed with the
FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I reaction mix
(Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany) using the
Lightcycler 1.5 instrument and the LightCycler Software
version 4 (Roche Diagnostics). Reactions were performed in triplicates and a negative water control was
included in each run. Products were quantified against
the standard curve using dilutions of a sample with the
highest expression and the expression was normalised to
apple ACTIN (MdACT, accession number CN938023).
Error bars shown in the qPCR data represent the means
± SE of three replicate PCR reactions. Primer sequences
are presented in Additional file 3. Whenever possible,
primers were designed to span the predicted cleavage
site in target mRNAs.
Pulsed stem-loop RT and PCR for miRNA detection
was performed as described previously [80], using
SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and
Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix (Clontech). Primer
sequences were designed according to Chen et al. [81]
and are presented in Additional file 4. PCR products
were visualised on 4% agarose gels by ethidium bromide
staining. Quantifications using real-time PCR were performed following the miRNA SYBR Green I assay protocol [80], on the Lightcycler 1.5 instrument (Roche
Diagnostics), using the FastStart DNA Master SYBR
Green I reaction mix (Roche Diagnostics), followed by
analysis using the LightCycler software, version 4. Reactions were performed in triplicate and a negative water
control and minus RT controls were included in each
run. The expression was normalised to MdACT for
apple and PP16 transcript (CmPP16) for pumpkin. Error
bars shown in the qPCR data represent the means ± SE
of three replicate PCR reactions.
Histology

Apple stem tissue was collected from plants infected with
established woolly apple aphid colonies and processed

Varkonyi-Gasic et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:159
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/159

using standard histological methods. In brief, tissue was
fixed in formaldehyde-acetic acid-alcohol (FAA) and
embedded in wax. Sections 10 μm thick of wax-embedded
material were dried onto positively charged slides,
de-waxed and stained with safranin fast green [82]. Microscopy was carried out on an Olympus Vanox AHT3 compound microscope with image recording by a Roper
Scientific CoolSnap colour digital camera system.
In situ hybridization

Fresh apple seedling stem, shoot tip and Arabidopsis
inflorescence stem material was fixed in FAA overnight
at 4°C. Fixed tissues were dehydrated through an ethanol series and xylene and embedded in paraffin according to Cox et al. [83]. Sections (10 μm) were cut and
mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Biolab Scientific).
Sections were rehydrated, prepared for hybridization
according to Steel et al. [84], and hybridised overnight.
Antisense and sense oligonucleotide probes labelled
with digoxygenin (DIG)-11-dUTP were prepared using
the DIG Oligonucleotide Tailing Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Hybridisation was performed at 37°C in 30% (v/v)
formamide, 4x SSC, 50 μg mL-1 heparin and 100 μg
mL-1 polyA solution. After hybridization, the slides
were washed as described previously [33], and the
probes were visualised as described by Steel et al. [84].
Antisense and sense MdHB15 RNA probes labelled with
(DIG)-11-rUTP were transcribed from the full-length
cDNA clone with the T7 and SP6 polymerase (Roche
Diagnostics). Hybridisation was performed at 48°C in
50% (v/v) formamide, 5x SSC and 50 μg mL-1 heparin.
After hybridization, the slides were washed, and the
probes were visualised as described [84].
Phylogeny

Apple EST sequences were uploaded to Vector NTI version 9.0.0 http://www.invitrogen.com. Sequence alignment was performed using Vector NTI Clustal W
(opening 15, extension penalty 0.3). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA version 3.1 [85]
using a minimum evolution phylogeny test and 1000
bootstrap replicates.
