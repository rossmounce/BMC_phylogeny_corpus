The 5S rDNA family evolves through concerted
and birth-and-death evolution in fish genomes:
an example from freshwater stingrays
Danillo Pinhal, Tatiana S Yoshimura, Carlos S Araki and Cesar Martins*

Abstract
Background: Ribosomal 5S genes are well known for the critical role they play in ribosome folding and
functionality. These genes are thought to evolve in a concerted fashion, with high rates of homogenization of
gene copies. However, the majority of previous analyses regarding the evolutionary process of rDNA repeats were
conducted in invertebrates and plants. Studies have also been conducted on vertebrates, but these analyses were
usually restricted to the 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNA genes. The recent identification of divergent 5S rRNA gene
paralogs in the genomes of elasmobranches and teleost fishes indicate that the eukaryotic 5S rRNA gene family
has a more complex genomic organization than previously thought. The availability of new sequence data from
lower vertebrates such as teleosts and elasmobranches enables an enhanced evolutionary characterization of 5S
rDNA among vertebrates.
Results: We identified two variant classes of 5S rDNA sequences in the genomes of Potamotrygonidae stingrays,
similar to the genomes of other vertebrates. One class of 5S rRNA genes was shared only by elasmobranches. A
broad comparative survey among 100 vertebrate species suggests that the 5S rRNA gene variants in fishes
originated from rounds of genome duplication. These variants were then maintained or eliminated by birth-anddeath mechanisms, under intense purifying selection. Clustered multiple copies of 5S rDNA variants could have
arisen due to unequal crossing over mechanisms. Simultaneously, the distinct genome clusters were independently
homogenized, resulting in the maintenance of clusters of highly similar repeats through concerted evolution.
Conclusions: We believe that 5S rDNA molecular evolution in fish genomes is driven by a mixed mechanism that
integrates birth-and-death and concerted evolution.

Background
The nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is organized into
two distinct multigene families comprising the so-called
45S and 5S rDNA repeats. The 45S rDNA repeats contain the genes that are transcribed into 18S, 5.8S and
26S-28S rRNA and spacers (IGS, ITS1 and ITS2),
whereas 5S rDNA encodes the 5S rRNA transcribing
region (120 bp long and highly conserved) and a variable nontranscribed spacer (NTS) [for a review, see 1].
A common characteristic of 5S rDNA is multiple tandemly arrayed repeats, at one or several chromosomal
locations throughout the genome. Furthermore, the 5S

rDNA has been reported to be linked to other genes or
arranged as a spread of additional copies [2].
Based on the supposed homogeneity among 5S rDNA
repeats, several studies propose that 5S rDNA are subject to concerted evolution [3-5], where duplicated gene
family members evolve as a single unit that undergoes a
high degree of homogenization (as a unit in concert). A
combination of unequal exchange and gene conversion
within and between the same chromosome loci have
been suggested to explain how such evolution can occur
“in concert” [6,7]. A key difference between theses
mechanisms is that gene conversion maintains the copy
number of a gene, whereas unequal crossing over may
increase or decrease the gene copy number from generation to generation.

However, the diverse molecular features exhibited by
the 5S genes and spacers bring into question the
assumption that there is concerted evolution in 5S
rDNA. First of all, the majority of the findings on concerted evolution of rDNA were based on the major
ribosomal 18S, 28S and 5.8S units, which differ from
5S rDNA in number of repeats, genomic organization
and transcriptional machinery. Not all mechanisms
that affect major ribosomal genes may act on 5S rDNA
arrays. Moreover, molecular analyses have demonstrated the existence of remarkable 5S rDNA variants
[8-13] within individuals and species of plants [14,15],
fungi [16,17] and animals [18-21]. Generally, these 5S
rDNA variants correspond to paralogs copies that are
clustered or dispersed in the genome. In several vertebrate groups, the main difference between 5S rDNA
variants involves the length of the NTS, and are mostly
due to single mutations or indels, whereas the transcribed regions of 5S rRNA are not divergent. Conversely, in studies of marine and freshwater fish [22-28],
including members of the elasmobranch group such as
sharks and rays [29-31], significant variation has been
found in spacer sequences and even in the 5S rRNA
genes. An extensive analysis of nucleotide sequences
and chromosomal in situ hybridization, also in fish,
demonstrated that such variant forms correspond to
two classes of 5S rDNA repeats, each organized separately in the genome [see 30, for review]. Two classes
of 5S rDNA were also observed in Xenopus; the first
was expressed in somatic cells and the second, which
was derived from the somatic type by gene duplication,
was expressed in oocytes [21]. Together, these findings
suggest that, aside from the mechanisms of the classical Dover-Arnheim model of concerted evolution,
additional mechanisms are likely involved in the evolution of 5S rDNA.
Based on the evidence presented above, 5S rDNA
families also have been proposed to evolve according to
an evolutionary process known as birth-and-death
[16,32-34]. In the birth-and-death model of evolution,
new genes are created by repeated gene duplication at
different genomic locations, and some of the duplicated
genes are maintained in the genome for a long time,
while others are deleted or become nonfunctional. On
the other hand, homogeneity is maintained by the
effects of strong purifying selection, and as a result, the
DNA sequence of different members of the same gene
family can be very different, both within and between
species [33]. Consequently, high levels of intragenomic
repeat variation are expected in the 5S rDNA repeats
that evolve through birth-and-death process, leading to
the accumulation of numerous 5S ribosomal gene and
spacer variants [35]. To distinguish between concerted
evolution and evolution by gene birth-and-death,

knowledge about the level of repeat variation and the
phylogenetic patterns between species is critical.
Studies of the structure and organization of 5S rDNA
in the genome of chondrichthyans, a long-lived, welladapted vertebrate group, are limited to a few marine
families such as the Rajidae [29] and Carcharhinidae
[30-32]. Similar to bony fishes, the genomes of sharks
and rays also seems to harbor a dual 5S rDNA system
[29], although additional variant copies have been
detected in other species [36]. Furthermore, a distinctive
5S rRNA gene class shared only by elasmobranch species [30] suggests a group-specific evolutionary history
of 5S rDNA, making these organisms of special interest
for deciphering the genomic architecture of multigene
families.
In the present paper, we investigated the genomic
organization of 5S rDNA tandem repeats in members of
the Potamotrygonidae family, who comprise the only
group of rays that is totally restricted to freshwater systems [37,38]. These rays belong to the Myliobatiformes
order as well, a large group of predominantly marine
elasmobranches [39]. In our discussion, we focus on a
model for the ongoing evolution of the 5S rRNA genes
among elasmobranches. We also performed a comparative genomic analysis of 5S rRNA genes from several
fish orders, as well as from other, unrelated vertebrates,
in an attempt to measure the contribution of genomic
events to the diversification of the 5S rRNA multigene
family in long-term evolution.
Our results identified two types of 5S rDNA tandem
repeats in stingrays, as was previously observed in teleosts and other elasmobranches. Nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5S rDNA sequences were also valuable as
molecular markers to distinguish different genera and
species of Potamotrygonidae stingrays. Finally, the large
vertebrate dataset of 5S rDNA sequences examined support the idea that this multigene family evolves in the
fish genomes according to a mechanism integrating
both birth-and-death and concerted evolution.

Results
5S rDNA organization in Potamotrygonidae stingrays

Electrophoresis of PCR products from the 5S rDNA of
Potamotrygonidae stingrays on ethidium bromide
stained gels revealed the existence of two fragments of
different sizes. A shorter fragment of ~450 bp in
length was common to the three species, while larger
fragments of ~1,800 bp in length were found in the
congeners P. motoro and P. falkneri, and of ~1,700 bp
in length in P. aiereba (Figure 1). Using BLASTn,
sequences of several positive clones were confirmed to
be 5S rDNA repeat units, each consisting of a 5S
rRNA gene (120 bp) and an adjacent NTS of highly
variable length (Table 1) (Genbank accession numbers

bp. After removing the non-informative primer

annealing regions, we analyzed a 77 bp segment of the
5S rRNA gene (see additional file 1: Final alignment of
nucleotide sequences encompassing the class I and
class II 5S rRNA genes from the three Potamotrygonidae stingrays), plus a NTS segment of variable length
in several clones from three individuals of each species
(Table 1, see additional file 2: NTS class I and NTS
class II nucleotide sequences from the stingray species
included in this study), from both 5S rDNA classes. It
is worth noting that the 77 bp segment we analyzed
completely covers the internal control regions (ICRs),
which are considered key regions of 5S genes due to
their active role as transcriptional promoters. The A
box is a general ICR sequence for RNA polymerase III.
The intermediate element (IE) and the C box are specific to 5S rRNA transcription and work as binding
sites for the transcription factor TFIIIA [40].
The subsequent alignment of Potamotrigonidae 5S
rRNA genes allowed us to identify two types of
sequences that are somewhat distinct. These stingray
sequences probably correspond to functional genes
because they encompass the internal control regions
(ICR) within the coding segment (i.e., box A, internal
element and box C) and the poly-T motif at the end of
the coding region. We also found the 5S genes to be
GC-rich (53.3% to the class I and 58.4 to the class II).
Only two nucleotide polymorphisms, at positions 60 and
112 (a G-A transition, and a C-A transversion, respectively), characterized both sequences in the two classes
from the three species (Figure 2, see additional file 1:
Final alignment of nucleotide sequences encompassing
the class I and class II 5S rRNA genes from the three
Potamotrygonidae stingrays).
Numerous dispersed non-parsimony informative
mutations were also found in each 5S gene class. The
genetic variation was lower when comparing 5S gene
classes in Paratrygon. The overall genetic distance of
coding sequences among the three species was also low,
with a mean of 0.17 and 0.16 for class I and class II,
respectively (Tables 1 and 2). Among the ICRs, we
detected extensive nucleotide variation within the A and
C boxes and a unique polymorphism within the internal
element (Figure 2, Table 2, see additional file 1: Final
alignment of nucleotide sequences encompassing the
class I and class II 5S rRNA genes from the three Potamotrygonidae stingrays).
Southern blot hybridization experiments confirmed the
existence of two 5S rDNA classes in Potamotrygonidae
composed of tandem repeats of ~450 bp and ~1,700 to
1,800 bp. This finding is further supported by the PCR
products and the sequencing data obtained (Figure 1).
In contrast to the way the 5S rRNA genes within and
between 5S rDNA classes were conserved or only moderately variable, we discovered two very distinct NTS

types in the genomes of the three stingrays. Furthermore, data mining showed that NTS sequences isolated
from Potamotrygonidae do not match any nucleotide
sequence currently in the NCBI database.
We detected a high degree of sequence-length polymorphism within the two NTS classes. Class I spacers
had 12 nucleotides substitutions plus six extra bases (a
TCC repeat), which distinguishes P. aiereba from the
other Potamotrygon species, whereas the two congeners
had no species-specific nucleotides (see additional file 2:
NTS class I and NTS class II nucleotide sequences from
the stingray species included in this study). Despite partial sequencing, the large NTS class II had several interspecific polymorphisms, which allowed the congeners of
P. motoro and P. falkneri spacer sequences to be discriminated (see additional file 2: NTS class I and NTS class II

nucleotide sequences from the stingray species included
in this study). Both NTS classes had a high GC content
(class I = 56.3% and class II = 59.7%), comparable to the
5S gene. This was unexpected because GC-rich regions
are predominantly found inside coding sequences. Table
1 shows the analysis of several intraspecific parameters.
We detected low similarity between orthologs class II
NTS regions, which is in contrast to how highly conserved between Potamotrygon and Paratrygon genera the
class I regions are. The highly polymorphic class II
spacers contrast with the homogenous spacers of class I
(Table 1, Figure 2). Indels and nucleotide substitutions
further increase genetic distance within NTS type II
sequence (Figure 2, see additional file 2: NTS class I and
NTS class II nucleotide sequences from the stingray species included in this study). The estimates of average evolutionary divergence between all NTS sequence pairs
were much higher in the larger spacers (NTS I: 0.016 ±
0.003; NTS II: 0.081 ± 0.009).
We conducted intra- and interspecific analyses
between the two paralogs NTS classes independently.
Intraspecific nucleotide diversity in stingrays was always
less than 0.03; however, the percentage of polymorphisms was consistently beneath 7%. These data suggest
the occurrence of several variants that are different by

only one or a few nucleotides. Furthermore, simple
sequence repeats (SSRs) that represent highly mutable
DNA sequences were detected in the NTS II class and
significantly contributed to the observed intra- and
interspecies nucleotide variation (Figure 2). In a detailed
analysis of the NTS II, we identified several tri- and
dinucleotide SSRs composed of TGC and AC/GC
motifs, respectively, which may be responsible for the
high number polymorphisms observed. Finally, indel
blocks outside the SSRs ranging from 7 to 18 bp were
found to exist either in Potamotrygon or in Paratrygon
sequences (see additional file 2: NTS class I and NTS
class II nucleotide sequences from the stingray species
included in this study).
Phylogenetic inferences based on the 5S genes and NTSs
of Potamotrygonidae stingrays

We performed independent phylogenetic analyses of the
5S genes and the NTS sequences, between and within
each Potamotrygonidae species (Figures 3 and 4). Modeltest 3.6 [41] determined that the Transitional Model
with Equal Frequencies (TIMef) was the best model for
the evolution of 5S genes; however, for the NTS, Felsentein 81 (F81) was the best fitting model. Both models
incorporate rate variation among sites (+G).
Applying these parameters to all examined specimens
supports the existence of two classes of 5S rDNA that
are well separated into distinct clades in the phylogenetic trees for the 5S genes and the NTS (Figures 3 and
4, respectively). Phylogenetic data showed that variability
in the NTS is responsible for the separation of 5S rDNA
into two classes. However, the 5S rRNA genes also harbor polymorphisms that differentiate them into two
classes (classes I and II), as illustrated by the high probability values for the BI, ML and MP trees (Figure 3).
Analyzing the relationships in the 5S rRNA gene tree,
we determined that the class I genes from P. aiereba
branched from the Potamotrygon species class I genes
due to two transitions at positions 46 and 92 (Figure 2).
In the corresponding positions, P. aiereba carries the
same two nucleotides shared by its class II genes, as
well as by the class II genes of all Potamotrygon individuals (see additional File 1: Final alignment of the
nucleotide sequences of the 5S rRNA class II and class I
genes from three Potamotrygonidae stingrays). The class
II genes from all individuals do not cluster according to
species boundaries, with intermingling between classes
(Figure 3). This finding indicates that most of the phylogenetic relationships seen are likely not significant, and
therefore, only the differentiation between variant copies
of class I and II genes is well supported.
When evaluating NTS data, the P. aiereba spacers
always cluster in a separate branch from those of the
Potamotrygon species. The ML tree of NTS class I

(Figure 4). One clade was comprised of the P. aiereba
NTS I sequences, which branched out according to species boundaries. The other clade was composed of intermingled sequences from the two Potamotrygon species.

subclades comprising the shark and Potamotrygonidae
class I genes (65% posterior probability) as a sister
branch of the Rajidae and Potamotrygonidae class II
genes. Therefore, both 5S gene variants in Potamotrygonidae stingrays were placed in the elasmobranch clade,
joining either sharks or rays (Figure 5). In another clade,
the 5S genes of Ray-finned fishes, represented by Chondrostei (Acipenseriformes) and two Teleostei (Gasterosteiformes and Siluriformes), intermingled with
Tetrapoda (Reptilian, Amphibian, Avian and Mammal).
The remaining Teleostei fish 5S gene sequences clustered into a single clade with the 5S gene class genes
from Raja asterias, R. lalandii and R. porosus (Figure 5).

In contrast, the comparison of NTS class II sequences
produced a tree that was more informative in distinguishing the relationship between the three species
(Figure 4), as all branches obtained very high statistical
support.
Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate 5S genes

We verified several divergent vertebrate clades using a
Bayesian tree, and by examining the alignment of 5S
coding sequences (Figure 5, see additional file 3: Alignment of 5S rRNA gene sequences from several vertebrates). The most basal division we could detect was
between jawless fish such as lampreys (Agnathans) and
jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata). A consistent phylogenetic signal (83% posterior probability) supports a
clade containing only the Elasmobranchii, except for the
class II sequences from Raja asterias and the class I
sequences from Rhizoprionodon lalandii and R. porosus,
which clustered in a separate branch with Teleostei.
Moreover, the “elasmobranch clade” splits into two

The cause of the widespread appearance of distinct
classes of 5S rDNA repeats in the genomes of vertebrate
species is unknown. In fishes, distinct classes of 5S
rDNA have already been found in several Actinopterygii
and Elasmobranchii. Usually, the variation in 5S rDNA
is related to the high polymorphism in the NTS regions,
whereas the 5S coding region remained unchanged
[25,42]. However, in Merlucius fishes [28], Rajidae rays
[29] and Carcharhinidae sharks [30,31], 5S genes were
found to be quite divergent between variant classes and
still functional.
In this paper, we identified the characteristic 5S rDNA
dual system in the three freshwater stingray genomes (P.
motoro, P. falkneri and P. aiereba) as determined by PCR,
sequencing and Southern blotting. Interspecific examination of the two classes of 5S rDNA revealed notable dissimilarities between NTS I and II classes, in agreement
with previously published data [24-26]. By contrast, we
found a low quantity of intraspecific variation within
each NTS class, where sequence homogenization was
more intense. The notable genetic distances found in the
between-classes comparison (NTS I sequences had 0.016
and NTS II had 0.078 of overall genetic distance) suggest
that both NTS classes are under distinct genomic pressures. It is interesting to note that the shorter NTS (NTS
I) has been extensively homogenized when compared to
the longer NTS II. The low level of variation in the NTS
I could be related to selective pressure against major
changes that could disrupt essential regulatory elements
present on this NTS. It has been argued that a minimum
NTS size is necessary for the maintenance of 5S rDNA
repeats in the genome [43] because the NTSs could contain DNA elements involved in the regulation of 5S
rRNA gene expression [44,45]. On the other hand, the
variable levels of homogenization of NTSs I and II (and
consequently of both 5S rDNA classes) could be
explained by the clustering of each class in distinct

genomic environments under constraint from different
evolutionary forces.
In sharks, the ancestral 5S class I genes derive from
different duplicated genes that originated before the
separation of the Agnathans and the Gnathostomans

species [30]. In contrast, although there was a slight
variation in the 5S rRNA genes of stingrays, they still
corresponded to a single gene type, noticeably, the elasmobranch type. Stingrays do not appear to carry the
ancestral 5S gene class I in their genomes, indicating

Pinhal et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:151
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/151

that it may have been lost in the course of evolution due
to a lack of functional constraint. Within the Elasmobranchii group, stingrays can be considered a modern
division that irradiated approximately 19 mya from a
marine ray ancestor [46,47], 180 mya after the separation of Batoidea (rays) and neoselachians (sharks) in the
basal Jurassic or late Triassic periods [48]. Marine stingrays studied thus far have an ancestral class I gene;
therefore, the loss of this gene variant in freshwater stingrays may have occurred later, during the evolutionary
transitions from marine to freshwater habitats. Bearing
in mind that variant copies of 5S rRNA multigene
families are commonly found dispersed across vertebrate
genomes, the birth-and-death of genes following mutational events perhaps led to the loss of the ancestral
class I gene (Figure 6). Given that new gene clusters
arise mostly by chance, the initial evolution of classes
within multigene families may be casual. Moreover, considering the feasibility of transposition of the 5S rRNA
genes [49,50], new genes could arise by new fixation of
unfastened short number copies from pre-existent tandem arrays (e.g., the class II arrays). Afterward,

duplications would spread, and these genes would form
a new cluster, as can be observed in other multigene
families [51,52]. Thus, functional or even non-functional
sequences could be kept and homogenized by gene conversion and unequal crossing over via the process of
concerted evolution, leading to the current set of
observed variant gene classes. Similarly, non-functional
variant copies of 5S rDNA repeats could also spread
and give rise to several new clusters in the genome, as
observed in the Hoplias malabaricus fish [53].
It still remains unclear whether the two 5S rDNA
classes of vertebrates are both related to the canonical
role of ribosomal RNAs or represent a distinct biological
feature. The occurrence of 5S genes that are differentially regulated in somatic and oocyte cells [21] has been
explored as the reason for the dual 5S rDNA pattern
reported in fish. However, neither the somatic nor the
oocyte types are correlated with the divergent 5S rDNA
classes detected in diverse fish groups [30] as well as the
Potamotrygonidae stingrays.
Among fishes, chromosomal data support the idea
that the divergence of different classes of 5S rDNA

constitutes a widespread form of organization, and is
related to their presence in different chromosomal
regions [25]. Nevertheless, even divergent 5S rDNA
types that differ profoundly in their spacer sequences
and genomic environments may be situated on the same
chromosome [42,54]. Differently sized units may be
arranged in composite tandem arrays, as is seen in several species of plants [55], such as in Vitis vinifera,
where three different 5S rDNA units coexist within the
same tandem array [56]. The same arrangement has
been observed in six Mugilidae fishes of the genera Liza
and Chelon, where two types of 5S rDNA repeat units
were characterized by an intermixed arrangement within
a single chromosome locus [27].
In the Potamotrygonidae, although we do not have
direct evidence of how the two 5S rDNA tandem arrays
are clustered, we have some evidence that they are disconnected. First, we did not observe any evidence of an
intermixed arrangement of 5S rDNA classes I and II
from the PCR or Southern blot results. If 5S rDNA type
I and II were intermixed, we would obtain different
band patterns, rather than the classical tandem repeat
patterns observed. Furthermore, the intraspecific comparison of different classes revealed a high dissimilarity
between them, which suggests they occupy distinct
chromosome locations.
Data accumulated to date demonstrates that the presence of two distinct classes of 5S rDNA arrays in elasmobranches and teleost fishes is a general trend (Figure
6). Such variation may be a consequence of ancient
diversification of 5S rDNA repeat types and its fixation
in the main lineages of vertebrates. The intense genomic
dynamism that seems to guide the evolution of tandem
repeat elements may have generated the divergent
copies of 5S rDNA observed. Some authors [57] speculate that the newly generated duplicate genes or gene
families may evolve to interact with other existing gene
families and promote the adaptation of organisms to
new environments. However, there are no substantial
evidences for such a conclusive statement, and, therefore, the major biological reason for such a dual pattern
of 5S rDNA organization remains unknown.
5S rDNA as phylogenetic and phylogeographic tool and
its utility for the molecular identification of stingrays

The 5S rDNA polymorphisms were efficient markers for
the discrimination of genera and species of potamotrygonids. The two 5S rDNA classes characterized in P.
motoro, P. falkneri and P. aiereba represent paralogs
and should be treated as two different nuclear markers.
Nucleotide-level and sequence length variation generate
distinct profiles by PCR (Figure 1) and in phylogenetic
trees (Figure 4), which is useful for distinguishing
between Potamotrygon and Paratrygon species.

Page 9 of 14

Unfortunately, we were not able to identify the three
species using PCR alone, as can be done for a few shark
species [36].
Although the NTS I class sequences were highly uniform within the Potamotrygon genus, a few consistent
polymorphisms were enough to detach them from Paratrygon. By contrast, intraspecific nucleotide variability
was 5-fold higher in NTS II class than in NTS I; therefore, NTS I can be used to discriminate P. aiereba from
the Potamotrygon spp. Alternatively, NTS II discriminates all potamotrygonid species and represents an
excellent marker to access species identification within
this group.
5S rDNA sequences and the NTS segments in particular have been successfully applied to the identification
and inspection programs intended to assess the identity
of species and hybrids [36,58,59], as well as in fish phylogeography [60] and phylogenetic inference studies
[29,61]. In Potamotrygonidae, short and long repeats
may also correspond to informative markers at the
population level and may be used in combination with
mitochondrial markers in a more consistent dual analysis. Further independent characterization of each 5S
rDNA class in stingray populations from distinct areas
would provide a better basis for phylogeographic studies.
Hence, the development of new genetic markers is a
welcome contribution to the study of phylogeny, phylogeography and identification in potamotrygonids species.
A mixed model for the evolution of 5S rDNA

Several mechanisms are believed to act in the evolution
of multigene families and duplicated sequences, driving
their accumulation, divergence or even deletion from
the genome. The model of concerted evolution was originally thought to apply to gene families that are
responsible for producing a large quantity of the same
gene product, as in the case of rRNA genes [62].
Since the concerted evolution theory explains the
observed lack of genetic variability among rRNA gene
copies in many different species, it became a universal
accepted as the unique mode of evolution of rRNA multigene families [63-65].
Although concerted evolution explains sequence
homogenization among members of a repeated gene
family, a pair of paralog gene sequences can diverge fast
enough to escape gene conversion [66]. When this happens, the rate of homogenization may be too low to prevent significant levels of intraspecific rDNA
polymorphisms. If this is the case, the production and
maintenance of a large quantity of the same gene product can also be achieved by strong purifying selection,
without concerted evolution [57]. When concerted evolution takes place, it will homogenize the gene copies
that are arrayed in the same cluster, and this cluster can

Pinhal et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:151
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/151

differ significantly from paralogs copies of a second
cluster. Thus, new genes are created by gene duplication, and some duplicated genes are maintained in the
genome for a long time, but other genes are deleted or
become nonfunctional (e.g., pseudogenes) through deleterious mutations.
Most studies in teleost fish have shown that a majority
of 5S rRNA multigene families evolve in a rigorously
concerted fashion. However, the presence of several 5S
rDNA variants has been reported in such diverse taxa as
molluscs [8,12,13,67], echinoderms [68] and arthropods
[10]. Among fishes, highly variable paralogs have been
clearly documented in the 5S rDNA regions in species
of the Leporinus genus [25], in the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus [42], in Merlucius species [28], distinct
Actinopterygii fish orders [9,24] and in marine Elasmobranchii [29,30]. Our data advocate the hypothesis that
independent mechanisms guide the evolution of distinct
5S rDNA classes in the genome of stingrays, which are
likely maintained by both concerted and birth-and-death
evolution, as was reported for bitterling (Cyprinidae)
fish [69].
In fact, a variety of studies have shown that rDNA and
other multigene families can evolve through distinct
mechanisms, leading to evolutionary patterns other than
concerted evolution. Highly conserved histone and ubiquitin gene families are well-defined examples of birthand-death evolution [34,70-72]. For example, small gene
families with strong purifying selection, such as the heat
shock protein [73] and amylase gene families [74],
evolve through a mix of evolutionary processes.
The presence of pseudogenes in a multigene family
strongly suggests that the family evolves by a birth-anddeath process [16]. There are numerous reports of
rRNA pseudogenes where the coding regions do not
have functional constraints [10,75-77]. In fish, diverse
studies have reported the presence of 5S rDNA pseudogenes [24,28,42,69]. In Potamotrygonidae, no evidence
of pseudogenes was found, most likely because both primers anneal in the 5S rRNA gene, and the presence of
mutations in the gene would have considerably reduced
the likelihood that pseudogenes would have been amplified, cloned, and sequenced [35]. A larger genomic survey in the future could be useful to detect pseudogenes
in stingrays.
Under the concerted evolution model, genes cluster
according to species; however, they do not under the
birth-and-death model, except in cases of recent gene
duplication [16]. The variant sequences of 5S rDNA
from the three different stingray species clustered
according to classes but not to species. These findings
indicate that birth-and-death processes have been active
throughout Potamotrygonidae 5S rDNA evolution. Conversely, nucleotide diversity values calculated for species

Page 10 of 14

within each clade were relatively small, implying that
homogenizing forces diminished sequence divergence
locally within each separate cluster of 5S rDNA variants
in each species. Such a pattern fit in a mixture of concerted and birth-and-death evolution, where distinct
arrays tend to accumulate large amounts of variation
that is kept or lost due to purifying selection. However,
paralogs copies in the genome, representing distinct 5S
rDNA arrays, appear to undergo array-specific concerted
evolution rather than a single homogenization mechanism common to all arrays.
To understand the evolutionary dynamics of 5S rRNA
genes, we carried out a large cross-species survey. Figure
5 shows the phylogenetic tree of 5S genes from major
vertebrate lineages. The analyses performed showed a
between-species clustering of 5S ribosomal DNA variants. As expected from previous studies [30], despite
being distantly related, several organisms, including
sharks, frogs, mice and humans, share the widespread
ancestral forms of the 5S genes. Furthermore, the
majority of vertebrate lineages contain variant 5S rDNA
copies, which have differentiated from the original genes
by duplication and deletion events.
Studies suggesting the occurrence of birth-and-death
on rDNA arrays have been predominantly conducted
using lower eukaryotes, such as studies of the 18S
rDNA in Apicomplexans [78], fungi [16], plants [79]
and invertebrates [35], who theoretically differ from
higher eukaryotes in genome dynamics. Thus, our broad
survey in vertebrates can shed light on the evolution of
rDNA arrays.
In Potamotrygon and Paratrygon species, as well as in
sharks and teleost fish, we found several 5S rDNA variants within clusters, even in the 5S rRNA gene. Comparisons between variants demonstrated a lack of
homogenization in the Elasmobranchii and Teleostei,
whereas homogenizing mechanisms appeared to be
active within each variant in each species. These new
variants emerged sporadically during fish evolution in
the main vertebrate lineages and likely originated during
ancient rounds of genome duplications [80-82] acting
on polymorphic ancestral 5S rDNA arrays. This hypothesis is supported by phylogenetic analyses that revealed
a between-species clustering of Potamotrygonidae 5S
rDNA variants, which was also observed in the rDNA
sequences of sharks, marine rays and several teleost fish
5S [29,30,69,83]. Thus, the emergence of new variants
and their within-variant homogenization supports the
idea that both concerted and birth-and-death evolution
are responsible for the extant variation of this multigene
family in fish genomes. Recently, similar results were
found in invertebrates [13], suggesting that the longterm evolution of 5S rDNA is most likely mediated by a
mixed mechanism in which the generation of genetic

Pinhal et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:151
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/151

diversity is achieved through birth-and-death. This process is then followed by the local homogenization of the
paralogs units, which most likely occurs after their physical movement to independent chromosomal locations.

Conclusions
A complex combination of duplications, insertions, deletions, and general genome rearrangements has likely
been involved in the evolution of the 5S rRNA gene
family in vertebrates. The present work reveals that in
fishes, different classes of 5S rDNA are organized in distinct clusters that arose from duplications and are kept
or lost by purifying selection under birth-and-death evolution. Simultaneously, unequal crossing over and gene
conversion homogenize tandemly arrayed gene copies in
each cluster, leading to the observed pattern of concerted evolution. Therefore, we concluded that 5S
rDNA in fish genomes appears to evolve according to
the mixed effects of concerted and birth-and-death
evolution.
Methods
Sampling, cloning and sequencing protocols

Fresh samples of ten Potamotrygon falkneri, twelve Potamotrygon motoro (collected in Rio Paraná, Três Lagoas/
MS, Guaíra/PR and Foz do Iguaçu/PR, Brazil) and one
Paratrygon aiereba specimen (collected in Rio Purus,
Porto Velho/RO, Brazil) were subjected to genetic analysis. DNA was isolated from fins [84], and PCR amplifications of the 5S rDNA were performed using the
Cart5S1f (5’-CAC GCC CGA TCC CGT CCG ATC-3’)
and Cart5S1r (5’-CAG GCT AGT ATG GCC ATA
GGC-3’) primers. These oligonucleotides were designed
by [30] based on the 5S rRNA gene sequence of the
elasmobranches Scyliorhinus caniculus (GenBank entry
M24954) [85] and Taeniura lymma (GenBank entry
AY278251) [86].
PCR amplifications were performed using 150 pmol of
each primer, 20-80 ng of genomic template DNA, 1x
Taq buffer, 200 μM of dNTPs, and 1 U of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in a final reaction volume of 25 μl. The
cycling times were: 5 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of 1 min at
95°C (denaturation), 30 s at 55°C (annealing) and 45 s at
72°C (elongation); and a final 5 min extension at 72°C.
A negative control was always included to determine if
any contamination occurred. The PCR products were
resolved in 1% agarose gels and compared with a standard DNA marker (1Kb Plus Ladder - Invitrogen). Fragments were visualized after ethidium bromide staining,
and the gel image was recovered using the EDAS program (Electrophoresis Documentation and Analysis System 120 - Kodak Digital Science 1D).
The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T plasmids (Promega) and were used to transform DH5á

Escherichia coli competent cells. Positive recombinant
clones were recovered and stored in 75% glycerol at -80°
C. The positive clones were sequenced on an ABI Prism
3100 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems)
with a Dynamic Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Phylogenetic analysis

After remove vectors and primers sequences, we subjected nucleic acid sequences to BLASTn searches at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information website
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). Next, sequence
alignments were performed using MUSCLE [87], and
consensus sequences were produced manually using
BioEdit software [88].
Phylogenetic trees were generated by Bayesian Inference (BI), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum
Parsimony (MP) methods employing the best fitting
model of evolution, which was previously selected for
each dataset following the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) obtained with Modeltest 3.6 [41]. Maximim Likelihood trees were constructed with the PhyML program
[89,90] using a website version (http://hcv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/PHYML/interface.html). Gamma shape
parameters and the proportion of non-variant sites were
estimated by maximum likelihood from a neighbor-joining tree (BIONJ). Maximum Parsimony trees were
recovered in PAUP v4.0 [91] applying a branch-andbound search and treating insertions/deletions as missing data. The support for individual nodes in ML and
MP trees were assessed by bootstrap resampling [92]
using 1,000 replicates with random additions and TBR
branch swapping. Bayesian Inference trees [93] were
generated via the estimation of posterior probabilities
using MrBayes v.3.0 [94]. Two runs of four continuoustime Markov chains were performed simultaneously for
each dataset using default heating and sampling every
100 cycles. Each run was 1,000,000 steps long, and the
asymptote of the likelihood score was detected with the
SUMP command.
Genetic distances over all sequence pairs were
obtained in MEGA 4 [95], with bootstrap for 1,000
replicates. All positions containing gaps in the alignment
and missing data were eliminated in pairwise sequence
comparisons. Nucleotide diversity and divergence were
calculated with DnaSP v5 [96].
5S rDNA sequences representing the most important
live lineages of vertebrates were retrieved from GenBank/EMBL/DDJB (See additional file 4: Compilation of
information regarding 5S rDNA nucleotide sequence in
vertebrates) and were used in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. The majority-rule consensus (MRC)
sequences of several Tetrapoda and Actinopterygii taxa

Around 10 μg of genomic DNA from P. falknerii, P.
motoro and P. aiereba were completely digested with PstI,
HindIII, PvuII and SspI endonucleases. These enzymes
were selected based in their pattern of cut detected in the
5S rRNA gene sequences. The restriction products were
subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred
to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane by capillary blotting
[77]. DNA hybridization was performed using as probes
the 5S rDNA sequences from P. motoro and HindIII
digested DNA of the tree species. For the final labeling
and detection steps, we employed the ECL-Direct Nucleic
Acid Labeling and Detection System kit (GE Healthcare
