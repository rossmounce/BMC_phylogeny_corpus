Abstract
Background: Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) code for key functions in the
adaptive immune response of vertebrates and most of them show exceptionally high
polymorphism. This polymorphism has been associated with the selection by diverse and changing
parasite communities. We analysed MHC class IIB diversity, gastrointestinal parasite load and body
condition in the wild ranging tropical rat Leopoldamys sabanus (Thomas, 1887) under natural
selection conditions in a highly variable rainforest environment in Borneo to explore the
mechanisms that maintain these high levels of genetic polymorphism.
Results: Allelic diversity was determined via SSCP and sequencing, and parasite screening was
done through non-invasive faecal egg count. The detected alleles showed expected high levels of
polymorphism and balancing selection. Besides a clear advantage for more diverse MHC genotypes
in terms of number of alleles, reflected in better body condition and resistance against helminth
infection, our data also suggested a positive effect of MHC allele divergence within an individual on
these parameters.
Conclusion: In accordance with the heterozygote advantage hypothesis, this study provides
evidence for an advantage of more diverse MHC genotypes. More specifically, the potential
negative relation between individual allele divergence and number of parasite species is in line with
the 'divergent allele advantage' hypothesis.

Background
Genetic variation is the material for evolutionary processes. Its maintenance may to a large part be driven by the
exceptional dynamics of host-parasite co-evolution [1,2].
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) represents
a crucial part of the host side in these co-evolutionary
processes and is one of the most polymorphic systems in

the vertebrate genome. It has been studied extensively in
model species under laboratory conditions [3], but also
became the focus of an increasing number of studies on
natural populations because of its functional importance
for the immune system and mate choice [4-6]. Its genes
code for cell surface molecules that present self and nonself antigens to T-cells [7]. This function makes them a key

factor of the adaptive immune system as it triggers a
respective targeted response upon recognition of non-self
antigens and therefore plays a vital role in the recognition
of pathogens invading the body. The high polymorphism
in this system, which is composed of a high total number
of alleles as well as allelic divergence on the sequence
level, is thought to facilitate populations to persist in and
adapt to natural habitats [5,8].
A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain
the forces that counteract the effects of random genetic
drift and fixation [reviewed in [5,6,9-11]]. The 'negative
frequency-dependent selection' hypothesis [12-14] grounds
on the effects of host parasite co-evolution ['Red Queen
hypothesis', [15]], stating that frequencies of alleles constantly change with the frequency of adapted and nonadapted pathogens. Rare alleles are being preserved
within a population through such fluctuations or the
emergence of new pathogens. The prerequisite for this coevolution in terms of reciprocal adaptation is the direct
interaction of individual alleles and distinct pathogenic
morphotypes. Growing evidence comes from a variety of
taxa that such an interaction exists [16-23]. Another
hypothesis, the 'heterozygote advantage' has been proposed
as a general mechanism to maintain high allele numbers
in populations by an advantage for individuals carrying
more than one allele, enabling them to present a broader
range of antigens [24,25]. There is experimental evidence
that this is valid for animals exposed to multiple pathogens [[26], up to an optimum in [27]] but not to single
pathogens [28]. This seems plausible, as the advantage
would most likely result from a combined resistance of
individual alleles each presenting a certain range of parasites [29,30]. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms are still
a matter of debate [31,32]. De Boer et al. [33] used mathematical models to study the degree of MHC polymorphism arising when 'heterozygote advantage' is the only
selection pressure. The simulations revealed that the
advantage for an individual that simply carries two alleles
instead of one is not sufficient to explain the high population diversity of the MHC. Wakeland et al. [34] proposed a special case of the heterozygote advantage, the
'divergent allele advantage', which refers to the genetic distance between alleles and expects an advantage for more
divergent allele combinations, enabling the respective carrier to present more different antigens to its adaptive
immune system. This mechanism may potentially explain
a directional selection for both, a large number of alleles
at the population level and a high divergence of alleles at
the individual level.
Tropical rainforests are known for their exceptional species diversity [35] and this may also be true for the diversity of parasites an inhabitant has to face. Therefore
studying a species from such diverse environment could

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/269

provide a great opportunity to better understand the
ongoing evolution of the MHC, as selection mechanisms
should be pronounced. In this study we examine the variability in the exon 2 of MHC class IIB genes and its effect
on parasite infection of the Long-tailed giant rat (Leopoldamys sabanus) to unravel the mechanisms of selection in
a wild ranging species. This large nocturnal murid species
lives semi-arboreal in tropical forested habitats and
reaches an average body mass of 368 g [36], feeding on
plant material and arthropods [37]. This rodent was chosen, because it is a wide-spread species living in the diverse
and dynamic environment of dipterocarp rainforests
across Southeast Asia [38,39], presumably conferring the
need to constantly adapt to environmental changes such
as the encounter of new parasites, but also to persist
against ancient pathogen lines. The presumably high parasite pressure in these habitats could lead to pronounced
and therefore detectable signs of elsewhere more subtle
mechanisms of selection.

Results
MHC II gene variability
In total we determined the MHC class IIB genotype of 46
individuals from the two different subpopulations. Overall 28 different sequence variants (alleles) could be distinguished via SSCP and confirmed by sequencing. The
genomic origin of the alleles was investigated through a
protein BLAST search on the NCBI database [40]. Ten of
the detected alleles showed unique DRB origin, blasting
to different murid species, ten other alleles produced hits
with DRB as well as DQB alleles from different murid species and the last eight alleles produced mainly DQB hits
from several murid taxa. The same latter eight alleles
showed a deletion of two amino acids, leading to a shortened amino acid sequence, but not to a frame shift in
codon translation. One of the two deleted amino acid
sites (position 65) is thought to be involved in antigen
binding [41]. The same deletion can also be found in
some (but not all) published DQB alleles of the Brown rat
(Rattus norvegicus; e.g. [GenBank:AY626188]) and House
mouse (Mus musculus; e.g. [GenBank:AY740472]).

Due to the ambiguous information from other species, we
did not assign locus origin to any of the alleles. Instead we
labelled them in the order of discovery with the prefix
Lesa-MHCIIB and submitted them to GenBank [GenBank:EU543225 - EU543252]. Although several of the
alleles show ambiguities concerning their origin, we did
not find traces of gene conversion events between the
potential two loci using GENECONV (no inner or outer
fragments detected, global SimP-values p = 0.155 and p =
0.387 respectively). We produced a neighbour-joining
tree of all alleles, including published DRB and DQB alleles from rat, mouse and human (Maximum Composite
Likelihood model for nucleotides, 10000 iterations, start-

ing seed: 90572, excluding deletions and allowing for heterogeneous patterns among lineages). In contrast to the
included human DRB and DQB alleles, which showed
strong locus divergence, the murid alleles did not cluster
in a significant pattern (Fig. 1), suggesting that the DRB
and DQB lineages in murids are not as differentiated as
they are in primates. The same holds true when including
the deleted sites in a pair wise comparison (tree not
shown). Due to these results and because both potentially
amplified loci code for classical MHC class II molecules
which present extracellularly derived antigens, we combined all detected alleles for analysing possible relationships of MHCIIB diversity with parasite loads and body
condition.
The frequency of alleles differed strongly (Fig. 2). While
most (58%) of the alleles were rare and occurred only in
one or two individuals, the most common allele LesaMHCIIB*03 was found in one third of all screened animals. The two alleles Lesa-MHCIIB*14 and LesaMHCIIB*22 equalled the alleles Lesa-MHCIIB*16 and
Lesa-MHCIIB*21 respectively after translation into amino
acid sequence, due to only synonymous substitutions,
leaving 26 different alleles on the amino acid level. Synonymous alleles were pooled for subsequent analyses,
however, none of them occurred together in the same
individual.
The two populations shared 82% of those alleles, which
were present in more than two individuals (9 out of 11)
and none of the private alleles, i.e. unique to one of the
study sites, occurred in more than 3 individuals (Fig. 2).
Genotypes ranged from one to four alleles per individual.
We calculated the divergence of alleles for each individual,
which ranged from 0 to 0.404 and correlated strongly
with the number of alleles (nonparametric correlation,
Spearman's rho = 0.58, p < 0.001).
Evidence for selection
Within the alleles, 70% of the amino acid positions
appeared variable and non-synonymous substitutions
occurred in a significant higher magnitude than synonymous ones (dN/dS = 1.78, Z-test, p = 0.018; Table 1), especially in the regions that code for the antigen binding sites
(ABS; dN/dS = 7.6, Z-test, p < 0.001). The same increased
dN/dS ratio at the ABS was also found in a separate analysis
of only the eight alleles with a deletion (Z-test, p = 0.002;
Table 1). Such elevated dN/dS-ratios are a widely accepted
sign for balancing selection in polymorphic genes [42,43].
These results were confirmed by the maximum likelihood
approach in CODEML, showing a significantly higher
likelihood estimate for the model M8 which allows for
positive selection compared to the model M7 which
assumes no positive selection (2Δl = 76.69, df = 2, p <
0.0001). The site class under positive selection showed an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/269

ω (dN/dS ratio) of 4.91 and contained 13 (25%) of the
amino acid positions, 8 of which overlap with the antigen
binding sites defined by Brown et al. [41].
Effects of MHC diversity on body condition and parasite
load
Out of the 46 analysed individuals, 20 were categorized as
adults, while the rest was classified as subadults. Only 23
of the 46 individuals were mature enough for sexing. Body
condition was positively associated with individuals'
allele divergence, i.e. average amino acid distance between
alleles (ANCOVA, F1,46 = 5.09, p = 0.030, Fig. 3a), whereas
study site, cohort or age class did not have any effect on
body condition. ABS divergence, i.e. allele divergence at
antigen binding sites only, showed the same effect
(ANCOVA, F1,46 = 4.6, p = 0.039), while allele number
showed only a slight positive trend in this respect
(ANCOVA, F1,46 = 3.35, p = 0.075). However, the strongest
effect originated potentially from the difference between
individuals with a single allele and those with more than
one (t-test, t = 3.6, p = 0.001). Sex did not influence body
condition in the subsample (t-test, t = 1.4, p = 0.22).

In total 11 different helminth morphotypes were identified (8 nematodes and 3 cestodes) with zero to four morphotypes per individual. The number of helminth
morphotypes per individual did not differ between study
sites, age or sex (Mann-Whitney U, all p > 0.24; Fig. 4a).
The overall prevalence of nematodes was high with
91.3%, whereas cestodes were found in only 23.9% of the
screened individuals and trematodes could not be
detected at all. Cestodes were significantly more prevalent
in the unlogged site with 44% (Poring) than in the logged
site with 4.8% (Monggis, Yates corrected X21,43 = 8.79, p =
0.003), whereas neither nematode prevalence (Likelihood
ratio X2 1,43 = 1.36, p = 0.24) nor intensity (Mann-Whitney
U, p = 0.15; Fig. 4b) differed between the locations. We
pooled the individuals for further analysis of those
parameters that did not show any differences between
study sites.
We found a significant negative influence of allele divergence on the number of helminth morphotypes (parasite
species richness) within an individual (GLM; X21,38 = 2.42,
p = 0.042; Fig. 3b). ABS divergence showed a similar trend
(GLM; X21,38 = 2.16, p = 0.056), while neither the number
of alleles (GLM; X21,37 = 1.50, p = 0.11) nor body condition (GLM; X21,34 = 0.01, p = 0.97) had an effect on the
number of helminth morphotypes. Again, a part of the
association between allele divergence and parasite species
richness was potentially due to the difference between
individuals with one and those with more than one allele,
since the latter showed a lower parasite species richness
(Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.013). The models showed also
that the number of helminth morphotypes differed signif-

populations (28 distinct alleles in 46 individuals) as well
as in the high percentage (70%) of polymorphic amino
acid sites within the exon 2, the domain that is responsible for antigen binding [41].
The inconsistent BLAST results might indicate that MHC
IIB locus differentiation is less consolidated than sometimes assumed. Mammals are the only order where the
differentiation between DRB and DQB loci is actually
being made, while in other vertebrate orders the different
MHCIIB loci are usually indistinguishable. Most studies
use the NCBI BLAST search for identification of locus origin and this might be sometimes misleading, as locus
identification is commonly referred from distantly related
taxa if no species specific sequence data is available. The
so identified sequences then function again for later studies as reference and artificially reinforce locus determination. BLASTing for instance a published DRB1 allele of
Canis familiaris [GenBank:AF016910] to the dog genome
[44] brings as first hit the DLA DQB1 locus. Additionally
there is support for the occurrence of interlocus exchange
of sequence motifs [45,46], which could also lead to misleading BLAST results.

binomial GLM; both p < 0.05). For statistical reasons we
only tested the effect of those alleles that occurred at least
in six individuals (6 alleles). Individuals with the second
most common allele Lesa-MHCIIB*13 tended to show a
decreased intensity of nematode infection (negative binomial GLM, X21,41 = 5.076, p = 0.024; not significant with
Bonferroni corrected p = 0.008 for multiple testing). The
intensity of nematode infection was independent of the
sex (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.46).

Discussion
In this study, the variability of the MHC class IIB genes in
the Long-tailed giant rat (Leopoldamys sabanus) was investigated and its effect on the parasite infection analysed.
The aim was to further unravel the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to the observed high polymorphism in
MHC genes by investigating a natural population in the
diverse and dynamic environment of a tropical rainforest.
As expected from studies on other small mammals, the
MHC of the Long-tailed giant rat was highly polymorphic.
This was shown in the diverse allele pool of the two sub-

The range of one to four alleles per individual suggests
that the number of MHCIIB loci differs between haplotypes, albeit it is theoretically possible that the same allele
occurs on several loci. The variation in MHCIIB loci
number has already been resolved for several vertebrate
species, including mammals [47-51] and seems to occur
in the Long-tailed giant rat as well. Another explanation
would be the presence of null alleles, meaning that we did
not amplify all present alleles. However, the used primers
are rather conservative, have been established before in
several mammalian species and produced more than two
alleles in some of them, indicating duplicated MHCIIB
loci as well [22,52-56]. The puzzling deletion in some of
the alleles is not species specific and can be found in some
(but not all) DQB alleles of the Brown rat [57] and the
House mouse (e.g. [GenBank:AY740472]). However this
sequence characteristic alone is not enough to refer locus
origin, as it is not deterministic for one of the loci. The
Neighbour-joining tree does not solve the question of
locus origin either, as none of the Lesa allele groups gets
significant bootstrap support. These results suggest that
the divergence between the two detected MHC class II loci
is either hindered by frequent inter-locus recombination
or by the fact that both loci evolve under the same selective forces. Under these circumstances the apparent lack of
traces of inter- and intra-locus recombination events
therefore suggests that both loci code for molecules that
provide the same function and are shaped by the same
selective forces. As done in most studies that analyse MHC
diversity in natural populations, we amplified only the
exon 2 of MHC IIB genes, since this codes for the antigen

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:269

binding region of the MHC molecule. Despite high functional and structural similarity of the molecules and presumable paralogous origin, the different MHC IIB loci
might have diverged more strongly in other exons.
Restricting the comparison to the exon 2 sequence only
might therefore contribute to the dissatisfying locus resolution. However, a recent meta-analysis on MHC in several rodent taxa, some of them with duplicated loci,
confirmed that the overall combined number of alleles
from several class II loci is shaped by local parasite species
richness [58].
The observed high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions is a strong sign for balancing selection
and strengthens the assumption that both loci are functional and currently involved in antigen presentation,
which is not always the case as seen in a recent study on
MHC genes in bank voles [56]. This is supported by
CODEML, which showed that the positive selection
model M8 explained the obtained sequence data better
than the model for neutrality M7. Overall, our results do
not show any sign for non-functionality or pseudogenes
and indicate that the analysed genes in this tropical rodent
behave like classical MHC genes. We consequently
assume that they are actively involved in antigen presentation, providing resistance against pathogens and confer
a crucial adaptive trait for the Long-tailed giant rat. Therefore we analysed possible adaptive effects of the individual MHC-constitution on overall body condition as well
as helminth parasite infestation to shed more light onto
the selection mechanisms that lead to such high polymorphism.
Interestingly, the allele divergence (average genetic distance of alleles on the amino acid level within an individual) was correlated with a lower individual number of
parasite morphotypes and a better overall body condition.
This is in line with the 'divergent allele advantage' hypothesis [34], which assumes that individuals with more divergent alleles have an advantage, because their immune
system can counteract against more different pathogens
and therefore leads to 'overdominant selection' [29,30].
Other studies have found an unexpected high divergence
of MHC alleles in natural populations [59] and also signs
for 'divergent allele advantage' in the context of mate choice
[60-63]. Consuegra & Garcia de Leaniz [61] also found a
positive effect of MHC dissimilarity on the prevalence of
a single parasite. However, the current data set does not
provide enough statistical power to disentangle the effects
of allele divergence and pure heterozygote advantage.
The question remains whether the sequence divergence
between alleles is a better functional predictor for immunocompetence than the plain number of alleles. It makes
intuitively sense to give more importance to allele pairs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/269

that differ by 30 amino acids than to those that differ by
only one amino acid. Studies that experimentally support
the idea of overdominance in allele numbers [e.g. [26], up
to an optimum in [27]], may in fact show indirectly the
effect of allele divergence, which is supported by our
observation that the genetic divergence within an individual correlates strongly with the number of alleles.
The genetic divergence increases strongest with the step
from one allele to two alleles. Every additional allele
thereafter only adds a fraction of its antigen binding
potential, since alleles are known to overlap in their antigen repertoire [64] and each new allele only adds the fraction of antigens that are not yet bound by the already
present alleles. The observed correlation between MHC
allele divergence and parasite species richness might to a
significant part be due to the observed difference between
individuals with one allele and those with more alleles.
This is, however, not the only reason for the correlation,
since we would then also expect a stronger correlation of
parasite species richness and mere allele number, which
was not detected.
Our finding of a potential association between intensity
of nematode infection and a certain allele, which looses
significance after Bonferroni-correction, would support
the 'negative frequency-dependent selection' hypothesis,
which has already been shown in several other host parasite systems [16,18,20,54,65,66]. The fact that the potentially 'resistant' allele Lesa-MHCIIB*13 is the second most
common in our population, although a rather rare allele
would be expected by this hypothesis, could be due to the
sampling time point. The cycling pattern of frequencies of
both alleles and parasites due to host-parasite coevolution
can lead to a spread of an advantageous and formerly rare
allele until the parasite evolves to avoid it [67]. The 'negative frequency-dependent selection' hypothesis could also
explain the maintenance of the observed high number of
alleles that were found in one or two individuals only. It
expects a potential advantage for individuals carrying rare
alleles, which enable them to better resist new pathogen
threats and therefore keeps those rare alleles in the gene
pool instead of purging them.

Conclusion
The negative correlation of mean genetic distance between
MHC IIB alleles and the number of parasite morphotypes
could be interpreted in support of the 'divergent allele
advantage', which has to our knowledge not yet been fully
proven by empirical studies. However, the main effect
originates likely from the difference between individuals
with one and those with more alleles. In addition we
found a substantial number of rare alleles and hints for an
interaction between a specific allele and nematode infection intensity. We therefore conclude that both hypothe-

ses, the heterozygosity advantage (and potentially the
'divergent allele advantage' as a special case thereof) as well
as the 'negative frequency-dependent selection', work nonexclusively on the maintenance of a high variability in the
MHC allele pool, as it has already been proposed in theory by Apanius et al. [3]. More work has to be done on the
molecular level to discover and unravel the interrelations
of individual alleles and individual parasite genotypes to
finally resolve the mystery of balancing selection on the
MHC loci. A special focus should be put on the importance of individual allele divergence, e.g. by looking at a
broader parasite range.

plasma, and further distinguished into morphotypes by
size classes and shell thickness for strongyle nematodes
[68,74]. The overall number of helminth morphotypes
within each rat was then used as a measure of parasite species richness.

Methods
Study area and animal collection
The samples were collected in two lowland rainforest sites
near Mount Kinabalu in the federal state of Sabah in
Malaysia, North-western Borneo. While one site ('Poring')
was located in an old-growth forest area within the Kinabalu National Park (6°22'N, 116°42'E), the other site
('Monggis') was located in a distance of ca. 21 km beeline
in an adjacent logged forest area near the village Monggis
(6°13'N, 116°45'E), which has been logged about 20
years ago. Both forest areas comprised more than 1000
hectares. Animals were captured in four trapping sessions
(cohorts) between 2002 and 2004 with wire-mesh live
traps placed along transects of 380 meter length and additional traps as described in Wells et al. [68].

Traps were baited with ripe banana and checked every
morning. Captured individuals were weighed and firstcapture individuals were anaesthetised with diethyl ether
for further handling. We injected a subcutaneous transponder (AEG Identification Systems) for permanent identification. Then animals were aged, sexed and
morphological measurements (weight, body length) were
taken. We sampled ear tissue with a biopsy ear punch and
stored it immediately in 95% ethanol. Faeces were collected from the bottom of the trap and stored in 2-3% formalin. Animals were handled and immediately released at
the point of capture. The animal handling and sampling
protocol followed guidelines of the American society of
Mammalogists [69] and was approved by the Economic
Planning Unit Malaysia and the Sabah Parks authority.
Parasite screening
We focused on helminth parasite species because their
prevalence and the intensity of infestation can be assessed
non-invasively from faecal samples. We counted all eggs
from
nematodes,
cestodes
and
trematodes
(Plathelminthes) from faeces with a modified flotation
and McMaster method [19,68,70]. This non-invasive technique has been shown to be accurate for quantification of
helminth eggs (e.g. [71-73]). Samples of approximately
600 mg faeces were dissolved in 9 ml potassium iodide

Molecular techniques
DNA was extracted according to the mouse tail protocol
using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden). We aimed
at amplifying the highly variable exon 2 of the MHC class
IIB genes. As there was no sequence data available for the
Long-tailed giant rat, we used the well established primers
JS1: 5'-GTGTCATTTCTACAACGGGACG-3' [53] and
GH50:
5'-CTCCCCAACCCCGTAGTTGTGTCTGCA-3'
[52], which have been established for DRB loci in small
mammals. When BLASTed against the NCBI nr database,
the first 1000 hits for both primers deliver only MHC II
DRB genes from different species (searching for distant
homologies and adjusting for short sequence queries).
These primers lead to a fragment of 221 bp length, which
spans most of the exon 2, including the most polymorphic part of the MHC IIB gene. Reactions of 20 μl contained 2-4 μl template DNA, 2 μl 10× incubation buffer
incl. MgCl2, 0.175 mM of each dNTP, 1 unit taq polymerase (all QBioGene, Irvine) and 0.375 mM of each primer
(MWG Biotech, Ebersberg). PCR was performed on a
TGradient Thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen) with an
initial denaturing step of 96°C for 2 min, 34 cycles of
96°C for 30 s, 54.7°C for 60 s and 72°C for 60 s and a
final elongation step of 72°C for 10 min. We checked the
PCR product for quality and size on a 1.5% agarose gel
and then purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden) according to the manufacturers protocol, but eluting in dH2O. An additional ethanol precipitation was done to further purify the product.

Alleles were separated using Single Stranded Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP [75]). It is a sensitive method
to distinguish even minimal allele differences [76,77],
which has been widely used in human genetics and
became popular in population genetics and evolutionary
ecology as well [19,27,62,78-80].
Products were denatured at 95° for 5 min and immediately transferred to ice for snap-cooling to produce singlestrands and hinder reannealing. The ssDNA was then
mixed with loading dye and loaded on a non-denaturing

polyacrylamide gel (CleanGel HP-15 from ETC, Kirchentellinsfurth) according to the manufacturer's protocol and
with the following adaptations: 12°C running temperature, pre-run for 20 min at 200 V, 20 mA, 10 W and main
run for 4.5 h at 450 V, 30 mA, 20 W.
Gels were silver stained, scanned and processed with Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc, Beaverton) to align individual's band patterns. We counted bands with the same
mobility as same alleles and each of these alleles was
sequenced at least once from both directions, if possible
twice from different individuals, to confirm this assumption. Appropriate bands were cut from the polyacrylamide
gel, eluted in TBE buffer, amplified with the same protocol as above but only 30 cycles and using 1-2 μl of eluate.
The PCR product was gel purified, ethanol-precipitated as
above and then sequenced using the chain termination
method [81] and either the JS1 forward or the GH50
reverse primer.
Sequences were aligned manually and obvious PCR misincorporations (unreproducible SNPs) were omitted.
Alleles were only counted when they could be supported
by two independent sequences from one individual or, if
possible, from two different individuals. Primer
sequences were excluded from analysis.
Genetic analysis and statistical treatment
Sequence alignment was done manually with the
sequence analysis software BioEdit [82]. We used GENECONV [83], a powerful tool for the detection of sequence
recombination [84], to test for traces of gene conversion
events within and between loci. A phylogenetic tree was
built with MEGA 4 [85] based on neighbour-joining algorithm and nucleotide distance. The distance was estimated
in MEGA 4 with a maximum composite likelihood
method [86] based on a model by Tamura & Nei [87].
This model corrects for multiple hits, takes into account
the differences in substitution rates between nucleotides
and the inequality of nucleotide frequencies and also distinguishes between transitional and transversional substitution rates.

We used the software MEGA 4 to calculate dN/dS ratios
and the therein implemented Z-test to test for signs of
selection. This was done for the full sequence and separately for those sites only that are directly involved in antigen binding (ABS) [41]. To confirm this selection estimate
we also performed a model test with CODEML. This tool
is included in the PAML4 package [88] and calculates
maximum likelihood estimates for the fit of models with
different assumptions of selection patterns to the
sequence data. We tested the models M7 (neutral) against
M8 (positive selection). The models are described in
detail in Yang et al. [88] and can be compared using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/269

likelihood ratio test by calculating the likelihood difference 2Δl = 2(l1-l0) and compare it to a X2-distribution
with the degree of freedom equal to the difference in the
number of estimated parameters [89].
As a measure of MHC diversity besides the pure number
of allelic variants, we determined allele divergence, i.e. the
average genetic distance between all MHC IIB alleles of an
individual. This distance was calculated in MEGA 4 as the
sum of all pairwise amino acid p-distances between all
alleles of an individual, divided by the number of possible
pairings (2 alleles = 1, 3 alleles = 3, 4 alleles = 6). The pdistance was calculated according to the model of Tamura
& Nei [87]. The genetic distance for individuals with only
one allele is zero. The same estimate for allele divergence
was also calculated taking only the antigen binding sites
into account (ABS divergence). Correlation between allele
number and average distance was tested with Spearman
rank correlation because of non-normality of the data.
Body condition as a measure of physical fitness is difficult
to estimate in a living animal [90,91]. Therefore we used
an approximation index, taking the residuals from the
regression of body mass against body length [90]. To test
effects of study site, cohort (time of sampling), age and
MHC diversity on body condition, we used linear models
(ANCOVA) and the step function in the statistical software R, version 2.6 [92], which selects the most appropriate model based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC).
Three different estimates for MHC diversity were used
independently because of co-linearity: allele number,
allele divergence and ABS divergence. Normality of
response variable and independence of included factors
was verified. Sex could only be determined in a subsample
of the individuals and was therefore left out of the models. However, we tested the effect of sex on body condition
and parasite load (species richness and infection intensity) within this subsample using t-test or Mann-Whitney
U tests. For analysis of infection parameters we included
only parasitized individuals (n = 43). Since it is unlikely
to find individuals without a single parasite egg (lowest
EPG count in parasitized individuals = 50), we feared that
the egg count was confounded in those three individuals
and might deteriorate the results.
Parasite species richness within each individual, expressed
as number of different helminth morphotypes, was not
normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test, p < 0.001).
Therefore we used a generalized linear model (GLM,
quasipoisson distribution, log link). We analysed the
effect of study site, cohort, age and MHC diversity on parasite species richness. Again we tested allele number,
allele divergence and ABS divergence independently. The
model was optimised manually, because the step function
is not available for models with quasipoisson distribu-

tion. The effect of body condition was tested in a separate
model without MHC diversity because of co-linearity. The
validity of the chosen models was evaluated by testing the
distribution of the residuals.

8.

To analyse the infection intensity in more detail we
focussed on nematodes, because of their high prevalence.
Effects of study site, cohort, age and MHC diversity on
nematode infection intensity (EPG of all nematode morphotypes pooled) were tested with a negative binomial
GLM with log link (glm.nb function in the MASS package,
[93]), because of its distribution. Again the step function
was applied to find the best fitting model. The effect of
allele number, allele divergence and body condition on
infection intensity was tested in independent models
because of co-linearity. To analyse the effect of individual
alleles, they were included singly in the GLM with the
other factors. A Bonferroni correction had to be applied
for testing multiple alleles. All tests were performed twotailed using R 2.6 [92] or SPSS 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago) and
test assumptions were verified. All tests are also assigned
in the results section.
