Abstract
Background: Syncytins are envelope genes of retroviral origin that have been co-opted by the host to
mediate a specialized function in placentation. Two of these genes have already been identified in primates,
as well as two distinct, non orthologous genes in rodents.
Results: Here we identified within the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus-which belongs to the lagomorpha
order- an envelope (env) gene of retroviral origin with the characteristic features of a bona fide syncytin,
that we named syncytin-Ory1. An in silico search for full-length env genes with an uninterrupted open reading
frame within the rabbit genome first identified two candidate genes that were tested for their specific
expression in the placenta by quantitative RT-PCR of RNA isolated from a large set of tissues. This
resulted in the identification of an env gene with placenta-specific expression and belonging to a family of
endogenous retroelements present at a limited copy number in the rabbit genome. Functional
characterization of the identified placenta-expressed env gene after cloning in a CMV-driven expression
vector and transient transfection experiments, demonstrated both fusogenic activity in an ex vivo cell-cell
fusion assay and infectivity of pseudotypes. The receptor for the rabbit syncytin-Ory1 was found to be the
same as that for human syncytin-1, i.e. the previously identified ASCT2 transporter. This was
demonstrated by a co-culture fusion assay between hamster A23 cells transduced with an expression
vector for ASCT2 and A23 cells transduced with syncytin-Ory1. Finally, in situ hybridization of rabbit
placenta sections with a syncytin-Ory1 probe revealed specific expression at the level of the junctional zone
between the placental lobe and the maternal decidua, where the invading syncytial fetal tissue contacts the
maternal decidua to form the labyrinth, consistent with a role in the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast.
The syncytin-Ory1 gene is found in Leporidae but not in Ochotonidae, and should therefore have entered
the lagomorpha order 12-30 million years ago.
Conclusion: The identification of a novel syncytin gene within a third order of mammals displaying
syncytiotrophoblast formation during placentation strongly supports the notion that on several occasions
retroviral infections have resulted in the independent capture of genes that have been positively selected
for a convergent physiological role.

Background
Previous studies have identified two pairs of envelope
(env) genes of retroviral origin that have been independently captured by their host for a role in placentation. In
simians, syncytin-1 [1-3] and syncytin-2 [4,5] entered the
primate genome 25 and >40 million years (My) ago,
respectively. They retained their coding capacity in all the
subsequent branches; syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 display placenta-specific expression, are fusogenic in ex vivo cell-cell
fusion assays, and one of them displays immunosuppressive activity [6]. A pair of env genes from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) were then identified in the mouse,
named syncytin-A and -B, which share closely related functional properties although they have a completely distinct
origin, showing a divergent sequence and a different
genomic location compared to primate syncytins [7]. As
found for the latter, syncytin-A and -B have the status of
bona fide genes. They have been conserved since their
entry into the Muridae genome, approximately 20 million
years (My) ago; they display placenta-specific expression,
mediate cell-cell fusion in ex vivo assays [7], and one of
them is immunosuppressive [6]. Recently we have further
unambiguously demonstrated via the generation of syncytin-A knockout mice that these genes are indeed essential
for placentation, with a lack of cell-cell fusion observed in
vivo at the level of the placenta of the knockout embryos,
resulting in impaired maternal-fetal exchanges and death
of the embryos at mid-gestation [8]. Therefore, it appears
that on some occasions in the course of mammalian evolution, env genes from endogenous retroviruses have been
"co-opted" by their host to participate in the formation of
the syncytiotrophoblast layer, at the maternal-fetal interface, by mediating the fusion of mononucleated cytotrophoblasts.
A further question that we wanted to answer was whether
mammals belonging to orders other than rodents and primates but possessing a placenta with a related architecture, i.e. with a syncytiotrophoblast layer in direct contact
with maternal blood at the maternal-fetal interface, have
also "captured" retroviral env genes to generate, in a convergent manner, this specific placental structure. Among
mammals whose placenta displays such a structural
organization at the maternal-fetal interface, i.e. with a
haemochorial placenta, the lagomorpha order was
selected over the two other orders which also possess a
haemochorial placenta -i.e. the Insectivora (hedgehog)
and Chiroptera (bats) [9]; this was done because one of its
representatives, the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), has an
already sequenced genome, and can be reared and investigated easily at different stages of gestation, and has a placental physiology that has been appropriately described
[9-11].
Here, by combining in silico search for env genes within
the rabbit genome, RT-PCR assays for their in vivo tran-

scriptional activity in a large panel of tissues including the
placenta, cloning of the candidate genes, ex vivo assays for
their fusogenicity and, ultimately, in situ hybridization of
placenta sections, we identify a new fusogenic and placenta-specific endogenous env gene, displaying all the
characteristic features of a bona fide syncytin gene, that we
named syncytin-Ory1. Although we demonstrate that the
syncytin-Ory1 protein shares the same ASCT2 receptor in
common with human syncytin-1, it is divergent from all
four syncytins previously identified in rodents and primates and must therefore have been captured independently from a distinct ancestral retrovirus. The occurrence
in a third order of Mammals of a new syncytin gene that is
specifically expressed at the maternal-fetal interface
within the placental junctional zone provides strong support to the notion that ERVs have played a convergent role
in the recurrent emergence of syncytiotrophoblast-containing haemochorial placentae in the course of evolution.

Results and Discussion
In silico search for retroviral env genes within the rabbit
(Oryctolagus cuniculus) genome
To identify putative env-derived syncytin genes, we made
use of the available rabbit genome sequence (low coverage 2× assembly of the Oryctolagus cuniculus genome,
Ensembl May 2005 assembly, updated version 49) and of
the method that we previously devised to screen the
whole human and mouse genomes for such genes [7,12].
Basically, it makes use of the degenerate CKS17u consensus motif, associated with the immunosuppressive
domain of retroviral envelope proteins, and is designed to
match the majority of env genes of exogenous and endogenous origin [12]. Rabbit sequences from the Ensembl
database were screened with this motif using the BIOMOTIF program, and only sequences with open reading
frames (ORFs) longer than 1.5 kb were considered. Five
ORF-containing sequences were obtained, four of which
disclosed >98% nt identity. We named these four
sequences Env-Ory1. The fifth sequence that was obtained
was unrelated to Env-Ory1. We named this sequence EnvOry2 (Figure 1). Analysis of the scaffold database identified the former ORF as belonging to a low-copy family of
ERVs, most of which had an env gene that was interrupted
by stop codons, deletions and/or truncations. Due to the
low coverage of the available assembly, it could not be
determined whether the identified ORF corresponds to
distinct loci or to a single locus - in that case with distinct
alleles.
Transcription profile and identification of a placentaspecific envelope
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of transcript levels for the
two identified candidate syncytins was performed using
primers specific for each family of elements. As illustrated
in Figure 2, the Env-Ory1-encoding gene has the characPage 2 of 11

teristic profile of a bona fide syncytin gene, with high levels
of expression in the placenta and very limited expression
in other tissues. Expression in the placenta decreases with
gestational age, with a four-fold reduction from day 12 to
26 (i.e. 4 days before delivery). The other candidate gene
encoding Env-Ory2 is expressed only limitedly (at least
100-fold lower), with no specific expression in the placenta, and was not considered further.
Some of the sequence scaffolds reveal the Env-Ory1encoding gene to be part of a proviral structure with
degenerate but identifiable LTR, gag and pol gene
sequences. A phylogenetic tree based on the envelope TM
subunit (Figure 1) shows that this envelope protein is
related to that of type-D retroviruses such as MPMV, BaEV
and RD114, as similarly observed on the basis of a polbased tree (not shown). A putative donor and acceptor
splice site for the generation of a subgenomic env transcript can be identified according to http://

primers (see Methods and Figure 3).
Analysis of the amino-acid sequence of Env-Ory1 (consensus in Figure 3 of the four sequences in the database,
also corresponding to that PCR-amplified, see below) displays the characteristic features of retroviral envelope proteins, with a putative signal peptide at the N-terminus,
and a furin cleavage site (RQKR, consensus R/K-X-R/K-R)

used as a control in the following assays for receptor identification.

tin-1. It is rather unexpected for two independently
acquired - and distinct - retroviral envelopes to use the
same cellular receptor. ASCT2 seems, however, to be a
rather "successful" receptor being also the one used by a
series of type-D infectious retroviruses, such as the primate MPMV, feline RD114, and avian SNV viruses [14,15]
whose Env actually clusters with Env-Ory1 in phylogenic
trees (Figure 1 for the TM domain and data not shown for
SU). Finally, database screening indeed reveals the presence of an ASCT2 gene in the rabbit genome (mRNA
accession number NM_001082378; 85% amino-acid
identity with human ASCT2), and qRT-PCR demonstrates
its expression in the rabbit placenta (data not shown). In
conclusion, Env-Ory1 can be considered as a bona fide
syncytin owing to its fusogenic activity and specific
expression in the placenta, and be named Syncytin-Ory1.

Env-Ory1 can also form infectious pseudotypes, as
expected from its retroviral origin. As illustrated in Figure
4B, pseudotypes generated with an SIV core are able to
infect SH-SY5Y cells that are positive in the cell-cell fusion
assay above, but not A23 cells. The profile of cells positive
for infection was found to be similar to that observed for
human syncytin-1 (data not shown), thus suggesting that
Env-Ory1 could possibly use the same receptor (i.e. the
neutral amino acid trasporter ASCT2, [2]). This point was
investigated in the experiments illustrated in Figure 5 in
which distinct pools of A23 cells transfected with either an
ASCT2 or an Env-Ory1 expression vector (supplemented
with a β-galactosidase expression vector) were mixed and
assayed for cell-cell fusion. As shown in the figure, cell-cell
fusion (as revealed by the presence of large LacZ+ syncytia) could be observed with the Env-Ory1 and ASCT2 pair
(as well as with the ASCT2/syncytin-1 and MFSD2/syncytin-2 [13] pairs, used as positive controls) but not with
any of the other combinations. This strongly suggests that
Env-Ory1 uses the ASCT2 receptor, as does human syncy-

In situ hybridization of placenta sections
To further assess the physiological relevance of syncytinOry1 expression in the placenta, in situ hybridization
experiments were performed on paraffin sections of placenta at day 12 of gestation, i.e. the stage showing maximum expression of syncytin-Ory1 by qRT-PCR (Figure 2).
Figure 6A shows the representative architecture of rabbit
placenta at day 12. Three main zones can be distin-

guished. The maternal decidua results from the modification of the uterus after implantation, and the placental
lobe consists in a labyrinthine structure where fetal-maternal exchanges take place. In the labyrinth, fetal and maternal blood circulations are separated by 2 layers of
trophoblasts (haemodichorial placenta). Between the
decidua and placental lobe, a junctional zone can be
observed where fetal vessels surrounded by invading fetal
tissue contact the maternal decidua to form the labyrinth
(Figure 6A, B). The invading fetal tissue has been
described as a broad syncytial front toward the decidua,
backed by and presumably formed from cellular cytotrophoblasts [9]. Thus, as soon as the fetal processes reach
the maternal blood spaces, a haemodichorial structure is
formed, with both a cellular and a syncytial trophophoblast layer separating maternal and fetal blood spaces
(maternal lacuna, ml, and fetal vessels, fv). All of these
characterize the definitive labyrinthine placenta [9,11].

ORF. A 1900 bp specific amplicon could be obtained from
the 3 Lepus species, but neither from the Sylvilagus nor
from the Ochotona genus members tested. However, a pair
of primers internal to the ORF allowed the amplification
of a 1430 bp PCR product from the 2 Sylvilagus species
analyzed. Again, no specific amplification could be
obtained from the Ochotona princeps genomic DNA. The
PCR products obtained from Lepus and Sylvilagus were
cloned and sequenced and showed >88% nucleotide
identity with the Oryctolagus cuniculus syncytin-Ory1 gene
sequence, and therefore most probably correspond to
amplification of the same genes.

A specific digoxigenin-marked antisense probe was synthesized for syncytin-Ory1 transcript detection, as well as
the corresponding sense probe as a negative control. As
shown in Figure 6C, specific labeling was observed only
with the antisense probe (upper panels), but not with the
control probe (lower panels). Syncytin-Ory1 expression is
restricted to the junctional zone, where its expression (of
variable intensity depending on the area, even within the
same placental section) is limited to trophoblast cells surrounding the invading fetal vessels (brackets for heavily
marked zones and arrows for punctuated domains in Figure 6C). Although we cannot formally discriminate
between the syncytial trophoblast and the cellular cytotrophoblasts, the labeling profile is compatible with syncytinOry1 being expressed in the cytotrophoblast just before
fusion takes place and/or in the newly formed syncytiotrophoblast (no labeling was detected in the placental
lobe outside the junctional zone). These observations are
consistent with a role for syncytin-Ory1 in the formation of
the syncytiotrophoblast.

Conclusively, the identification of syncytin-Ory1 genes in
Lepus and Sylvilagus in addition to Oryctolagus indicates
that gene capture most probably occurred prior to the
divergence of the Lepus and Oryctolagus/Sylvilagus genera
~12 My ago [16]. The absence of a syncytin-Ory1 gene in
Ochotona princeps suggests that this integration took place
after the Leporidae and Ochotonidae divergence ~30 My
ago [16].

Syncytin-Ory1 sequences are present in Leporidae but
not in Ochotonidae
Phylogenetic relationships in the order of Lagomorpha
are illustrated in Figure 7 (adapted from [16]). The order
includes 2 families, Ochotonidae (pikas) and Leporidae
(hares and rabbits). We searched for syncytin-Ory1 genes
in lagomorph species belonging to the Ochotonidae family (Ochotona princeps) and the Leporidae family (genus
Lepus: Lepus americanus, Lepus europaeus and Lepus starcki;
genus Sylvilagus: Sylvilagus brasiliensis, Sylvilagus floridanus). The domestic rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, analyzed
in this study, belongs to the genus Oryctolagus within the
Leporidae.

Genomic DNA from these different species was PCRamplified using a pair of primers for the syncytin-Ory1

The absence of a syncytin-Ory1 gene in the Ochotona (as
well as in the more ancestrally diverged rodent (mouse)
and primate (human) orders) was confirmed by screening
(using the BLAST program) the corresponding Ensembl
databases.

Conclusion
Here we have shown that within a placental mammal that
has developed a haemochorial placenta with a syncytiotrophoblast layer at the maternal-fetal interface, such as
the rabbit, a gene of retroviral origin can be identified
which displays all the characteristic features of a bona fide
syncytin gene. The identified syncytin-Ory1 has a cell-cell
fusion activity and is expressed specifically in the placenta
at a location consistent with a direct role in syncytiotrophoblast formation. syncytin-Ory1 can be found in a series
of leporidae. Notably, the identified env gene is divergent
from any other previously described genes. Thus, for a
newly investigated mammalian order, we provide evidence that a retroviral env gene has been captured and has
gained the status of a "syncytin" according to a process similar to that previously observed in the two other major
orders where haemochorial placentae have emerged: the
primates (syncytin-1 and -2) and the rodents (syncytin-A
and -B).
It is therefore likely that such gene captures have arisen
recurrently during the evolution of placental mammals
and that syncytin genes will be found in other placental
mammals displaying a syncytiotrophoblast organization.
Ongoing investigations carried out on representative animals of the Carnivora order strongly support this hypothesis. An interesting question which remains to be
answered is to determine which specific properties of the

captured syncytins are responsible for the relative diversity
observed in the physiology of mammalian placentation.
Among species with hemochorial placentation in particular, most of the species (including human, rabbit and
most rodents) have a single layer of syncytiotrophoblast,
whereas a few others (Muridae) have a two-layered syncytiotrophoblast. Moreover, it will be of interest to determine whether placental mammals [such as Suidae (pig) or
Equidae (horse)] which do not possess a syncytiotrophoblast layer at their maternal-fetal interface, are
deprived of syncytins, or whether other functions of retroviral envelope proteins such as their immunosuppressive
activity have driven the capture of a non-fusogenic syncytin-like gene. In this case, retroviral envelope proteins
would be co-opted solely for an immunological role in
relation with maternal-fetal tolerance. Experiments in
progress with knock-in mice where syncytin genes have
been mutated for immunosuppressive activity without
impairment of fusogenicity may also help answer these
questions.

Methods
Database screening and sequence analyses
Retroviral env gene sequences were searched by using the
Biomotif program http://www.lpta.univ-montp2.fr/users/
menes/bioMotif_html_doc/ref_Run.html and the degenerate universal CKS17u consensus motif [12] as a query.
We made use of the available rabbit genome sequence
(low coverage 2× assembly of the Oryctolagus cuniculus
genome, Ensembl RABBIT May 2005 assembly, updated
version 49). ORF-containing scaffolds (scaffold number
and
ORF-coordinates

were:
131951(25124:26887), 15025(429:2192 reverse strand),
90528(17499:19256),
163359(7744:9486

strand) for Env-Ory2. Multiple alignments were carried
out by using the CLUSTALW program http://bio
info.hku.hk/services/analyseq/cgi-bin/clustalw_in.pl.
Phylogenic trees were constructed from alignments by
using the neighbor-joining program within CLUSTALW
and were viewed with the NJPLOT program.
The Ochotona princeps (Pika) genome low coverage 1.93×
assembly (Ensembl OchPri2.0 June 2007, updated version 53), as well as of the human and mouse assemblies
(from the Genome Reference Consortium) were also
screened for the presence of the identified rabbit EnvOry1 ORF sequence, using the BLAST programs at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST.
Real-time RT-PCR
Env-Ory1 and Env-Ory2 mRNA expression was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Pregnant New
Zealand white rabbit females obtained from INRA (Jouyen-Josas, France) at various stages of gestation were sacrificed, and dissected organs were stored in liquid nitrogen.
Total RNA was extracted from the frozen organs using the
RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription
was performed with 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA as in [17].
Real-time qPCR was with 5 μl of diluted (1:10) cDNA in a
final volume of 25 μl by using SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (or Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix for 18S rRNA
detection) (Applied Biosystems). PCR was carried out
using an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system.
Primer sequences were as follows: 5'-GCTGTTTTTATGCTAACAAGTCC and 5'-GATAAAGGTCATCAGC CT
ATTGA for Env-Ory1 and 5'-CCTCTAAATGTCATCTTCACCAG and 5'-CTATTGGGACAGCAGTTCTAGTC for EnvOry2,. The transcript levels were normalized relative to
the amount of 18S rRNA (as determined with the primers
and Taqman probe from Applied Biosystems). Samples
were assayed in duplicate.

Syncytin-Ory1 expression vector
The syncytin-Ory1 expression vector was constructed as follows: syncytin-Ory1 was PCR-amplified from genomic
DNA of New Zealand white rabbit using the Accuprime
DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) for 30 cycles. XhoI-containing primer sequences were: 5'-ATCACCTCGAGTGCTGGAATTGTTGTCATTGTTG and 5'-ATCACCTCGAGCG
TCATTGGCTTACTGCTCATTT. After restriction with XhoI,
the PCR product was cloned into the phCMV-G vector
(GenBank accession AJ318514, gift F.-L. Cosset) opened
with XhoI. Constructs were verified by sequencing.
Cell fusion assay
Cell lines described in [13,18] were grown in DMEM
medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen).

For the self-fusion assay, cells seeded at 104 - 5 × 104 cells
per well in 24-well plates were transfected by using the
Lipofectamine kit (Invitrogen) with 0.2 μg of either the
syncytin-Ory1 expressing or an empty vector, supplemented with 0.2 μg of a LacZ-expression vector (pCMV-β,
Clontech). Syncytia were visualized by X-Gal staining 24
to 48 h after coculture.
For cell-cell fusion by the coculture assay, A23 cells were
seeded at 5 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish. A set of dishes
were transfected by using the Lipofectamine LTX kit (Invitrogen) with 5 μg of either an ASCT2 or an MFSD2
expression vector [13] or an empty vector, and another set
were transfected with 2.5 μg of either a syncytin-Ory1 or a
syncytin-1 or a syncytin-2 expression vector or an empty
vector, each cotransfected with 2.5 μg of the nls-LacZ
expression vector (R9SA, [19]). One day after transfection,
3.5 × 105 cells from each group of transfected cells were
cocultured in 6-well plates. Syncytia were visualized by XGal staining 24 to 48 h after coculture.
Pseudotyping assay
SIV virions pseudotyped with syncytin-Ory1 were produced by cotransfecting 8 × 105 293T cells with: 2.25 μg
pSIV3+ (encoding SIV retroviral proteins except Env) [20];
2.25 μg R9SA (a LacZ-marked defective SIV retroviral vector) [19]; and 0.5 μg of syncytin-Ory1 expression vector,
using the Lipofectamine LTX transfection kit (Invitrogen).
Supernatants from the transfected cells were harvested 48
h after transfection, filtered through 0.45 μm pore-size
PVDF membranes, supplemented with Polybrene (4 μg/
ml), transferred to target cells seeded in 24-well plates (5
× 104 - 8 × 104 cells per well) the day before infection, followed by spinoculation at 1200 × g for 2 h 30 min at room
temperature. X-Gal staining was performed 3 days later.
In situ hybridization
Freshly collected rabbit placentae (at day 12 of gestation)
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C, embedded in
paraffin, and serial sections (4 μm) were either stained
with haematoxylin and eosin or used for in situ hybridization. A PCR-amplified 1135 bp syncytin-Ory1 fragment
(primers: 5'-AGACTGCGGAGATAAAACTGC and 5'GTGGACCGCGATTCCTAGTC) was cloned into pGEM-T
Easy (Promega) for in vitro synthesis of the antisense and
sense riboprobes, generated with SP6 RNA polymerase
and digoxygenin 11-UTP (Roche Applied Science). Sections were processed, hybridized at 42°C overnight with
the riboprobes and incubated further at room temperature for 2 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antidigoxygenin antibody Fab fragments (Roche Applied Science). Staining was revealed with NBT and BCIP phosphatase alkaline substrates as indicated by the
manufacturer (Roche Applied Science).

Search for syncytin-Ory1 in other lagomorphs
Genomic DNAs from Lepus americanus, Lepus europaeus,
Ochotona princeps, Sylvilagus brasiliensis and Sylvilagus floridanus were a gift from A. Surridge (Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, UK). Genomic DNA from
Lepus starcki was extracted from tissue given by F. Catzeflis
(Laboratoire de Paléontologie, Université de Montpellier
2, France). Genomic DNAs were digested by Not I, which
does not cut within the syncytin-Ory1 gene. PCRs were performed on 100 ng of DNA, using Accuprime Taq DNA
Polymerase (Invitrogen) for 40 cycles (30 sec at 94°C, 30
sec at 50°C, 2 min at 68°C). The primers used were: 5'TTCCTGAGGGCTCACTGATTAAC and 5'-GAAGGGGAGAGTCAGTTGTTGGAG (external to the ORF) or 5'AGACTGCGGAGATAAAACTGC and 5'-gataaaggtcatcagcctattga (internal to the ORF). PCR products were then
cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) for subsequent
sequencing. Primer sequences for splice site determination were: 5'-CTTGGGGTTCGAGCCTGT and 5'-TTGAGCACGGCCACGGCCAC, on each side of the putative
splice donor (SD) and acceptor (SA) sequences, respectively (see Figure 3A).
