Analysis of Canis mitochondrial DNA
demonstrates high concordance between
the control region and ATPase genes
Linda Y Rutledge1*, Brent R Patterson2, Bradley N White3

Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic studies of wild Canis species have relied heavily on the mitochondrial DNA control
region (mtDNA CR) to infer species relationships and evolutionary lineages. Previous analyses of the CR provided
evidence for a North American evolved eastern wolf (C. lycaon), that is more closely related to red wolves (C. rufus)
and coyotes (C. latrans) than grey wolves (C. lupus). Eastern wolf origins, however, continue to be questioned.
Therefore, we analyzed mtDNA from 89 wolves and coyotes across North America and Eurasia at 347 base pairs
(bp) of the CR and 1067 bp that included the ATPase6 and ATPase8 genes. Phylogenies and divergence estimates
were used to clarify the evolutionary history of eastern wolves, and regional comparisons of nonsynonomous to
synonomous substitutions (dN/dS) at the ATPase6 and ATPase8 genes were used to elucidate the potential role
of selection in shaping mtDNA geographic distribution.
Results: We found high concordance across analyses between the mtDNA regions studied. Both had a high
percentage of variable sites (CR = 14.6%; ATP = 9.7%) and both phylogenies clustered eastern wolf haplotypes
monophyletically within a North American evolved lineage apart from coyotes. Divergence estimates suggest the
putative red wolf sequence is more closely related to coyotes (DxyCR = 0.01982 ± 0.00494 SD; DxyATP = 0.00332 ±
0.00097 SD) than the eastern wolf sequences (DxyCR = 0.03047 ± 0.00664 SD; DxyATP = 0.00931 ± 0.00205 SD).
Neutrality tests on both genes were indicative of the population expansion of coyotes across eastern North
America, and dN/dS ratios suggest a possible role for purifying selection in the evolution of North American
lineages. dN/dS ratios were higher in European evolved lineages from northern climates compared to North
American evolved lineages from temperate regions, but these differences were not statistically significant.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate high concordance between coding and non-coding regions of mtDNA,
and provide further evidence that the eastern wolf possessed distinct mtDNA lineages prior to recent coyote
introgression. Purifying selection may have influenced North American evolved Canis lineages, but detection of
adaptive selection in response to climate is limited by the power of current statistical tests. Increased sampling and
development of alternative analytical tools will be necessary to disentangle demographic history from processes of
natural selection.

Background
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been widely used in
phylogenetic studies aimed at answering questions
related to ecology and evolution. Its maternal inheritance, lack of recombination, high copy number, variable
substitution rates across regions, high mutation rate
compared to nuclear DNA, and role in energy

production [1] make it an attractive genome for research
that aims to understand species relationships, evolutionary history, and demographic patterns within both contemporary and historic contexts. The control region of
the mitochondria can be particularly useful in understanding genetic relationships of recently diverged species because it contains hypervariable regions [2]. The
high variation can, however, be problematic for inferring
phylogenetic relationships due to mutation rate heterogeneity among nucleotide sites [3] and high rates of

homoplasy [4,5] that can lead to ambiguous phylogeographic patterns [6]. Although not without its own
peculiarities [1], coding regions of the mtDNA genome
may help clarify genetic and spatial relationships of species inferred from the control region alone. Although all
regions of mtDNA are linked and the entire mtDNA
genome is inherited as a single molecule without recombination, coding and non-coding sections exhibit different mutation rates due to higher selective forces acting
on genes that code for functional proteins [1]. Thus, different patterns of diversity, divergence, and phylogenetic
clustering may be evident when comparing regions
under divergent selective forces.
In addition to complementing control region phylogenies, analysis of mtDNA coding regions may help
resolve geographical distribution patterns because coding regions of the mtDNA are under strong selection
due to their fundamental role in energy and heat production [7,8]. There is growing evidence that purifying
selection on mtDNA coding regions has been important
in shaping the evolution and distribution of mtDNA
[8-11]. Additionally, adaptive selection may be important
[12] with climatic adaptation acting as an influential factor in mtDNA geographic distribution [13-15], although
some have disputed the climate hypothesis [8,16,17].
Despite this controversy, most agree that the evolution
of mtDNA is likely more complex than any single factor
could account for. Recent research, however, suggests
that the mtDNA ATPase genes in particular, may be
influenced by positive selection [8].
To date, studies of North American Canis phylogenetics have relied heavily on the mtDNA control region
to infer species relationships and evolutionary history
[18-27]. Phylogenetic analysis of the control region provided initial evidence for a North American-evolved
wolf, the eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), that shared an
evolutionary history with red wolves (C. rufus) and coyotes (C. latrans) independent of grey wolves (C. lupus)
that evolved in Eurasia and dispersed into North American approximately 300,000 years ago [19,20]. Since then,
various research has added to the growing evidence supporting the eastern wolf as a distinct species [28],
including genetic analysis of historic [20] and ancient
[25] samples. Despite this, the lineage of the eastern
wolf continues to be challenged, in part because evidence from coding regions that are under selection is
lacking [29]. Indeed, phylogenetic research on wild
canids has rarely ventured beyond the mtDNA control
region.
Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear Canis markers is
complicated by historic and recent hybridization
between coyotes, eastern wolves, and gray wolves
[24,25,27]. The advantage of studying a circular, nonrecombining marker like mtDNA is that patterns of

Page 2 of 12

evolutionarily independent lineages can be more easily
identified under complicated demographic histories.
Here, we use both the control region and the ATPase
coding region of the mtDNA genome to infer phylogenetic relationships of the eastern wolf to other Canis
species. High levels of hybridization and probable
incomplete lineage sorting in eastern North American
Canis species [24,25,27] also complicate species inferences from phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA. We, therefore, focus on divergence of phylogenetic clades to
provide an understanding of the evolutionary relationships and the role that selection has played in the geographic distribution of Canis mtDNA haplotypes. Our
study is the first to provide a substantial analysis of the
mtDNA ATPase region in wild Canis populations. For
clarity, a list of abbreviations is included at the end of
the manuscript.

Results & Discussion
Diversity and phylogenetic analysis

After combining sequences obtained from our study
with 9 from Genbank we analyzed 83 control region
sequences (347 bp; h = 29) and 89 ATPase sequences
(1067 bp; h = 26) (Table 1). Genbank accession numbers for sequences generated in this study are
HM755678-HM755718. Similar to other studies on the
control region [18], we found a higher proportion of
NW coyote clustering haplotypes per sample size at
both the control and ATPase region (0.38, 0.33) compared to OW haplotypes (0.29, 0.26). (Haplotype assignments to specific samples are shown in Additional File
1: Summary of sample locations and mtDNA control
region and ATPase region haplotypes). Overall, we
found high concordance between results from the control region and those from the ATPase region despite
the different selective forces acting on the two regions.
The control region had high variability but only 1.5
times more variable sites and 1.6 times higher nucleotide diversity per site (Pi) compared to the ATPase
region (Table 1). Within specific phylogenetic clades,
however, Pi was noticeably higher in the control region
than the ATPase region (Table 1). The higher diversity
in the control region is expected since it is not known
to code for functional proteins [30] and has been identified as a mutational hot spot [2]. Recent work, however,
suggests that mutational hotspots also occur in coding
regions of the mtDNA [31] making the high variation
reported here for ATPase genes somewhat less surprising. There were fewer ATPase8 than ATPase6 haplotypes, due to the shorter sequence length of ATPase8,
and grey wolves from Sweden, Russian, Spain, and
Canada all shared an ATPase8 haplotype (Additional
File 1), suggesting that ATPase8 is a highly conserved
gene region.

Analysis was conducted in DnaSP v. 5.10 with nucleotide diversity calculated according to [60]. Gaps were excluded in the analysis. The full 1067 bp of the
ATPase region is section 7729 - 8795 in the Canis complete mtDNA genome (Genbank Accession DQ480510) and includes gene regions ATPase8 (204 bp),
ATPase6 (681 bp), plus flanking regions that overlap with COX2 and COX3 genes. Subscripts refer to clade designations in Figures 2a and 2b. CR = control
region; SD=standard deviation.

There was a wide geographic distribution of NW
coyote-like ATPase haplotypes (Figure 1). Cladograms
from each genetic region had very similar topologies,
which is indicative of the haplotype association of the
linked regions. Eastern wolf sequences (Ccr13, Ccr12;
Catp13, Catp16) clustered monophyletically with high
(> 0.9) posterior probability within the NW clade, but
apart from coyotes, whereas the putative red wolf
sequence clustered among coyote sequences within the
NW CR2coyI /NW ATP2coyI clade (Figures 2a, b). Similar
clustering of the red wolf control region sequence
among coyote sequences has been reported [22], but the
haplotype is attributed to red wolves because it is not
known to occur in non-hybridizing coyotes from

western North America. A similar argument has been
made for coyote-like eastern wolf haplotypes [27,32].
These geographic distinctions of coyote-like sequences
in eastern and red wolves combined with evidence of
coyote-like sequences in eastern wolves prior to
European settlement in North America [25] provide
evidence for incomplete lineage sorting within the NW
lineages, although ancient (~11,000 years ago) hybridization during the Wisconsin glaciation is difficult to rule
out. This, combined with extensive hybridization in eastern Canis populations [23,24,26,27,33,34], makes species
designations of wild Canis difficult when based on
phylogenetic inference from mtDNA alone. For example,
a conspecific nature of eastern wolves and red wolves is

consistently lower for ATPase compared to the control
region (Figure 3), reflecting the lower observed mutation
rate in ATPase.
Based on the control region, divergence of eastern
wolves from coyotes was approximately 3.0%, that of the
red wolf sequence from coyotes was 2.0%, and eastern
wolves compared to red wolves was 2.7% (Figure 3).
These values are consistent with those reported for a
238 bp control region fragment (3.2%, 2.3%, 2.1%,
respectively) [19]. As expected, divergence estimates
from the ATPase region were lower (0.9%, 0.3%, and
0.8%, respectively) but were proportionally consistent
with that from the control region. These results complement the phylogenetic analysis and show further confirmation for the eastern wolf lineage. Differences between
OW evolved North American and Eurasian wolves were
1.8% for the control region and 0.6% at the ATPase
region, suggesting a closer relationship between these
lineages than between NW lineages.
TMRCA estimates from both genetic regions were
similar and suggest divergence of eastern wolf sequences
from other North American evolved sequences at
approximately 486,300 - 548,400 years ago (ya), and
North American grey wolves from Eurasian wolves at
465,600 - 518,100 ya, although the 95% highest posterior
densities (HPD) had wide intervals (Table 3). These
values for NW divergence are higher than previous
TMRCA estimates of 150,000 - 300,000 ya [19] but
results are not entirely inconsistent when HPD is considered. Our estimate of NW coalescence is closer to
that proposed for coyotes of 420,000 ya in [18], although
that study did not identify distinct eastern wolf

suggested by nuclear data [19], but is not demonstrated
by analysis of mtDNA. These differences are not unexpected and do not undermine the conspecific nature of
eastern wolves and red wolves because gene trees based
on mtDNA are not necessarily indicative of specific species relationships, and discordance is often found when
comparing mtDNA and nuclear genetic signatures [35].
Given the recent divergence of NW lineages (see below)
these issues are not unexpected [35]. New approaches to
phylogenetic analysis that utilize multiple loci, including
nuclear genes, may help reconcile inferred Canis species
relationships [35,36], although extensive hybridization
will likely continue to plague contemporary species designations based on nuclear markers. Regardless, the distinction of the two eastern wolf haplotypes shown in
both the control region and ATPase region is indisputable, providing clear evidence for the presence of a North
American evolved wolf lineage, distinct from coyotes
and grey wolves.
Divergence and TMRCA

Fixed differences occurred in all but one comparison
between groups (NWATP2coyI vs. NWATP3coyII) (Table 2).
Whereas comparisons of the percentage of nucleotide
differences were similar at both mtDNA regions when
comparing deep divergences (ie. NW vs. OW), differences were substantially lower for more recent divergence comparisons within NW or OW evolved
sequences (Table 2), indicative of possible homoplasy in
the hypervariable sections of the control region [4,5].
Overall patterns of divergence (DxyJC) were similar for
the control and ATPase regions, but estimates were

population subdivision or expansion [38], and Fu’s Fs is
a particularly powerful test of population growth
[39,40]. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle selection
from demographic history when interpreting neutrality
tests [1,41] and care should be taken not to over interpret results from a rejection of the neutrality hypothesis.
The known demographic history, however, suggests that
results from neutrality tests presented here are indicative of the population expansion of coyotes.

Over the past 100 years, grey wolves have experienced a
genetic bottleneck [37], whereas coyote populations
have expanded across North America [23,27], presenting
the two extremes of demographic history. Significantly

ATPase8

Sample size is the number of sequences analyzed based on haplotypes determined from the complete ATPase sequence (1067 bp). Dog sequence Catp04 was
excluded from analysis because it clustered independently and may have been influenced by breeding selection. OWATP4North includes haplotypes Catp03 and
Catp18 from the NWT, Canada, Catp08 from Sweden, and Catp09 from Russia; n/a indicates test not applicable because there were no polymorphic sites.
Significantly negative values are indicative of selection, population subdivision or expansion. ** indicates statistical significance.

dN/dS ratios were all < 0.3, indicate that purifying
selection has been influential in Canis mtDNA evolution, particularly in NW lineages (Table 5). This excess
of synonomous substitutions in mtDNA coding regions
is consistent with that previously found in wolves, coyotes and dogs [42] and in other mammals including
humans [17,43] and mice [11]. This pattern is thought
to mainly affect terminal branches of phylogenetic trees
suggesting recently diverged groups show a stronger
synonomous substitution signal [16], which is consistent
with the pattern observed in our dataset.
The ratio of nonsynonomous to synonomous substitutions (dN/dS ) was highest for OW lineages from northern climates in the ATPase6 region, but the same
pattern was not observed for ATPase8 (Table 5). The
difference in dN/dS ratios between OW and NW
lineages is not unusual given that mutations can be neutral in some lineages but non-neutral in others [44]. It
has been proposed that amino acid variation in the
ATPase genes may reduce the efficiency of oxidative
phosphorylation, thereby decreasing ATP production
while increasing heat production thus conferring a selective advantage for certain haplotypes in colder climates
[13-15], although this hypothesis is not without controversy [8,16,17]. The higher dN/dS ratios for ATPase6 in
OW evolved lineages in northern climates compared to
NW lineages from more temperate and subtropical climates (Table 5) hints at a possible role for adaptive
selection in response to climate for Canis mtDNA

Sample size is the number of sequences analyzed based on haplotypes
determined from the complete ATPase sequence (1067 bp). Dog sequence
Catp04 was excluded from the analysis because it clustered independently from
other Old World (OW) sequences. OWNorth includes haplotypes Catp03 and
Catp18 from the NWT, Canada, Catp08 from Sweden, and Catp09 from Russia.
The ratio of nonsynonomous to synonomous substitutions is calculated as dN/dS,
where dN is the number of nonsynonomous substitutions per nonsynonomous
site, and dS is the number of synonomous substitutions per synonomous site. All
calculations were done in DNAsp v. 5.10. Clades are those identified in Figure 2b.

evolution [13], but statistical tests of nonsynonomous
and synonomous substitutions did not support adaptive
selection in northern regions (Table 6). Although a wolf
poisoning campaign in the NWT during the 1950s [45]
may have decreased genetic diversity of NWT grey
wolves somewhat, it is unlikely to have impacted haplotype diversity to the extent that targeted extermination
efforts did in the US [37]. Further complicating interpretation is the recent suggestion that analysis of dN/dS
ratios and the McDonald-Kreitman test are ineffective at
detecting positive selection [46,47].
The discrepancies in our analysis and in the human
literature does not necessarily mean that climatic adaptation has not influenced the evolution of mtDNA
lineages, but suggests rather that mtDNA evolution is
more complex than climatic variation alone can explain
[8]. Although further investigation on a larger dataset
with an alternative approach [15] may help clarify the
role of climate in shaping the distribution of Canis
mtDNA, and could provide valuable insight into the
observed patterns of mtDNA introgression in eastern
North American populations, it will remain difficult to
separate a signal for adaptive selection from the dramatic and contrasting demographic histories of Canis
populations. The development of novel analytical tools
will be required to adequately disentangle natural selection from demographic processes.

Conclusions
Here, we provide important new data for phylogenetic
inference of wolves and coyotes in North America. We
know of no other study that reports as extensively on
the ATPase region in wild Canis species. Similar

Fisher’s exact test is based on raw numbers of nonsynonomous substitutions
(NSS) and synonomous substitutions (SS); McDonald-Kreitman test is based on
comparisons dN/dS for fixed differences between populations and
polymorphism within a population. n/a indicates the test was not applicable
because there were no substitutions observed for OWNorth at ATPase8. Dog
sequence Catp04 was excluded from analysis because it clustered
independently and may have been influenced by breeding selection. OWNorth
includes haplotypes Catp03 and Catp18 from the NWT, Canada, Catp08 from
Sweden, and Catp09 from Russia. Clades are those identified in Figure 2b.
Higher dN/dS values in samples from more northern climates suggest a
selective advantage at colder temperatures.

patterns of diversity and divergence between the control
region and ATPase regions suggest that evolutionary
patterns can be inferred from non-coding regions of
mtDNA. Overall phylogenetic concordance between the
control and ATPase regions suggests that the control
region can be an informative marker for inferring gene
trees when dealing with recent divergence. Of particular
importance is the monophyletic clustering of eastern
wolf sequences under a new Bayesian analytical
approach, thereby providing further evidence for a distinct North American evolved wolf, independent of coyotes and grey wolves, that inhabited the temperate
forests of eastern North America prior to colonization
by European settlers. In addition, eastern wolf sequences
are further diverged from coyotes than the red wolf
sequence. This does not necessarily imply that the red
wolf is not a distinct species but rather supports the
assignment of coyote-like sequences as eastern wolf
specific.
Understanding the role that selection has had on
mtDNA evolution and distribution is a more difficult
task. Although the high rate of synonomous substitutions provides evidence that purifying selection may
have influenced the evolution of Canis mtDNA, especially in NW lineages, the role of adaptive selection in
response to climate is more ambiguous. Adaptive selection may play a role in the geographic distribution of
OW mtDNA sequences in North America, but alternative analytical approaches will no doubt be required to
adequately test this hypothesis.
Based on the human literature, however, it seems
probable that climate is influential in adaptive selection
of mtDNA. Further research on adaptive selection of
Canis mtDNA is particularly important because it provides a mechanism by which eastern wolf and coyote
like mtDNA have introgressed extensively into greyeastern wolf hybrids in northern Ontario and the Great
Lakes region [24,26,27,32,48] and why eastern wolf
mtDNA is prevalent in eastern coyote populations
[23,27,33,34]. It is important to note that mtDNA introgression can occur with little or no obvious nuclear
introgression [49-51], and in some cases completely
replace mtDNA in the absence of apparent nuclear
introgression [50,52]. It is possible, therefore, that introgression of NW mtDNA lineages into grey-eastern wolf
hybrids in eastern North America, and introgression of
eastern wolf mtDNA into eastern coyotes, reflect chance
or rare events on which selection then acted creating
species discordance between mtDNA and the nuclear
genome [1]. Overall, this research provides a new and
important framework with which to study patterns of
mtDNA introgression and geographic distribution in
species where taxonomy has been blurred by incomplete
lineage sorting and/or hybridization.

Methods
Sequencing

Previously extracted DNA from 83 individuals from various North American Canis species (eastern wolves,
grey wolves, red wolves, and coyotes) were selected to
represent a broad spectrum of geographic regions and
mtDNA haplotypes. Extraction methods are provided
elsewhere [19,53]. Nine additional sequences analyzed in
[42] were obtained from GenBank (Accession Numbers:
DQ480499, DQ480503 - DQ480508, DQ480510, and
DQ480511). Locations for samples used in the present
analysis are listed in Additional File 1. All polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were conducted in a
20 μL reaction under the following conditions: approximately 1ng DNA, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM dNTPs,
0.2 μM forward primer, 0.2 μM reverse primer, 0.1 μg
bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 × PCR buffer, and
1 Unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Burlington,
Ontario). PCR cycles were run with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of
94°C for 30 seconds, 56°C, 58°C or 60°C (depending on
the region being amplified) annealing for 30 seconds,
and 72°C extension for 30 seconds with a final extension
at 72°C for 4 minutes. A ~425 bp fragment of the
mtDNA control region was amplified with primers
ThrL: 5′-GAA TTC CCC GGT CTT GTA AAC C-3′
and DLH-can: 5′-CCT GAG GTA AGA ACC AGA TG3′ [22] under a 60°C annealing temperature. Three primer pairs described in [42] were used to amplify a
region that contained the ATPase6 and ATPase8 region
of the mtDNA (For7651: 5′-CTT TAT ACC CAT TGT
TCT TG-3′ and Rev8248: 5′-GGC GTA AAT GAG
TGA GGT AAT-3′ (597 bp; 56°C annealing); For8049:
5′-CCA TTT TAT TCC CAA CAC CC-3′ and Rev8501:

annealing); For8255: 5′-CAA CTC TCT ATA AAC CTC
GG-3′ and Rev8891: 5′-CGT ATC GTA GTC CTT TTT
GTA-3′ (636 bp; 58°C annealing). We designed additional primer pairs for two of the regions because variation in the primer sites in coyotes led to inefficient
amplification. For7651B: 5′-CTT TAT GCC CAT TGT

TGG GGT AAT-3′; For8049B: 5′-CCA TTT TAT TCC

TCC AAT CAA G-3′. PCR products were cleaned with
ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Ohio) and analyzed on
either a MegaBace 1000 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences,
Baie d’Urfé, Quebec) or an AB 3730 (Applied Biosystems Canada, Streetsville, ON). Contigs from forward
and reverse sequences were assembled in Sequencher
4.9 (GeneCodes Corporation, Michigan) and edits were
made based on visual inspection of electropherograms.
Of the 83 samples, 74 full control region sequences of

Page 9 of 12

347 bp (72 had both forward and reverse, 2 from one
direction only) and 80 ATPase region sequences of 1067
bp were generated (base pairs 7729 - 8795 in the Canis
mtDNA complete genome sequence DQ480510; Region
1: 70 samples in both forward and reverse directions, 10
in one direction only; Region 2: 77 in both forward and
reverse directions, 3 in one direction only; Region 3: 79
in both forward and reverse directions, 1 in one direction only). These, plus the 9 sequences from GENBANK, were used in subsequent analyses. Sequence
alignment was done with ClustalW implemented in
Geneious 4.5 for Mac OSX (Biomatters Ltd., NZ, http://
www.geneious.com) followed by visual inspection.
Diversity and phylogenetic analysis

Measures of DNA sequence variation within and among
groups, including number of haplotypes (h), variable
sites, nucleotide diversity per site (Pi), and average number of nucleotide differences between groups were calculated for the control region, the full ATPase sequence,
ATPase6, and ATPase8 in the software program DnaSP
v5.10 [54]. Calculations for ATPase6 and ATPase8 were
limited to a subset of groups analyzed with the full 1067
bp sequence because the number of variable sites was
lower in the specific gene regions, especially in ATPase8,
due to the shorter fragment size. Phylogenetic analysis
was conducted under a Bayesian framework implemented in the program BEAST v. 1.4.8 [55]. We combined
3 independent runs, each with 10,000,000 MCMC iterations while sampling from the chain every 1000 steps.
We used a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular
clock [56] with a substitution rate of 3.8 × 10-8/year for
the control region [37,48] and 1.5 × 10-9 for the ATPase
region based on the median rate for substitution at the
cytochrome b region in carnivores [57]. Based on Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) generated in ModelGenerator [58] we used an HKY [59] with invariant sites
model with a transition/transversion rate ratio kappa of
45.04 and a 0.79 fraction of invariable sites. As we were
interested in putative species phylogenies, we used a
Yule tree prior as recommended in the BEAST manual.
For the ATPase region, we used an HKY model with a
gamma distribution and 4 rate categories, alpha of 0.21
and a transition/transversion rate ratio kappa of 42.96.
To ensure high performance and accuracy, the BEAST
output was scrutinized in the software TRACER v. 1.4.1
[60]. Raw traces for all parameters suggested the
MCMC had converged on a stationary distribution, and
all effective sample size (ESS) values were over 300
(most were over 1000). A burnin of 10% was used when
annotating output files. Maximum clade credibility trees
were visualized in FigTree v.1.2.3 http://tree.bio.ed.ac.
uk/software/figtree/.

Divergence and TMRCA

Divergence between clades was estimated by comparing
the number of fixed differences, the average number of
nucleotide differences, and the average number of
nucleotide substitutions per site with a Jukes and Cantor
correction (Dxy_JC) [61] calculated in DnaSP v5.10 [54].
We also compared divergence of the putative red wolf
sequence with the eastern wolf clade and other
sequences in the broader coyote clade.
Time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was
estimated in BEAST software with parameters described
above. Four sequences were selected at random to
represent the main clades: DQ480503 (Ccr15; Catp09)
represented the OW Eurasian lineage, CAN001806
(Ccr03; Catp03) represented the OW North American
lineage, CAN004377 (Ccr12; Catp16) represented the
eastern wolf lineage, and CAN000142 (Ccr26; Catp22)
represented the coyote lineage. Tree calibration was
done by setting the divergence distribution between
OW and NW lineages based on fossil evidence at 1.5
million years ago and a standard deviation of 0.5 million
years such that the 95% range would be 1 - 2 mya
[19,62].
Selection

For all the haplotypes identified in the ATPase phylogenetic tree (n = 25, dog excluded) we examined the
ATPase6 (681 bp) and ATPase8 (204 bp) regions to test
for selection. To test the hypothesis of neutral evolution,
we used DnaSP v 5.10 [54] to calculate Tajima’s D [63],
Fu and Li’s D*, Fu and Li’s F* [64], and Fu’s Fs [65]
overall and within clades. Significance values for each
test are based on the confidence limits of D, the critical
values of D* and F* [64], or with 1000 replicates in the
coalescent simulations approach of DnaSP v. 5.10 for
Fu’s Fs. We also tested for neutrality in a group of OW
sequences from northern climates (Russia, Sweden, and
Northwest Territories, Canada).
To determine whether purifying or adaptive selection
influenced the evolution of Canis mtDNA, we compared
the number of nonsynonomous substitutions (NSS) to
synonomous substitutions (SS), and the ratio of nonsynonomous substitutions per nonsynonomous site to
synonomous substitutions per synonomous site (dN/dS)
in ATPase6 and ATPase8 overall, within clades, and in
the group of OW sequences from northern climates. To
test whether climate may have influenced Canis mtDNA
distribution, we compared dN/dS at ATPase6 and
ATPase8 for all NW sequences compared to a) all OW
sequences and b) compared to OW sequences from
northern climates. If climate were a factor in the
adaptive selection of mtDNA, one would expect higher
dN/dS ratios in northern climates compared to more
temperate regions [13]. Significance of differences was

determined with a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test on the
raw data (NSS and SS) with the online calculator available at http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html
(accessed October 22, 2009) and a McDonald-Kreitman
test [66] conducted in DnaSP v. 5.10.
