Abstract
LIM and SH3 Protein 1 (LASP-1) was initially identified from a cDNA library of metastatic axillary
lymph nodes (MLN) more than a decade ago. It was found to be overexpressed in human breast
and ovarian cancer and became the first member of a newly defined LIM-protein subfamily of the
nebulin group characterized by the combined presence of LIM and SH3 domains. LASP2, a novel
LASP1-related gene was first identified and characterized in silico. Subsequently it proved to be a
splice variant of the Nebulin gene and therefore was also termed LIM/nebulette. LASP-1 and -2 are
highly conserved in their LIM, nebulin-like and SH3 domains but differ significantly at their linker
regions. Both proteins are ubiquitously expressed and involved in cytoskeletal architecture,
especially in the organization of focal adhesions. Here we present the first systematic review to
summarize all relevant data concerning their domain organization, expression profiles, regulating
factors and function. We compile evidence that both, LASP-1 and LASP-2, are important during
early embryo- and fetogenesis and are highly expressed in the central nervous system of the adult.
However, only LASP-1 seems to participate significantly in neuronal differentiation and plays an
important functional role in migration and proliferation of certain cancer cells while the role of
LASP-2 is more structural. The increased expression of LASP-1 in breast tumours correlates with
high rates of nodal-metastasis and refers to a possible relevance as a prognostic marker.

Domain organization and functional structure of
human LASP-1
The LASP1 gene was initially identified together with
three other genes from a cDNA library of metastatic axillary lymph nodes (MLN) from human breast cancer and
therefore called MLN50. All four genes were mapped to
chromosomal region 17q11-q21.3, a region known to
contain the c-erbB-2 and the BRCA1 oncogene and to be
altered in 20–30% of all breast cancers [1,2]. Northern
blot analysis revealed that the approximately 4.0 kb long
mRNA of MLN50 is ubiquitously expressed at basal levels

in normal tissue and overexpressed in 8% of all tested
human breast cancer tissues (5 of 61). Sequence analysis
showed that MLN50 encoded a putative protein of 261
residues containing a LIM motif at its amino terminus and
a src homology 3 (SH3) domain at its C-terminal part.
This domain organization defined a new LIM protein subfamily characterized by the combined presence of LIM
and SH3 domains [1]. MLN50 was termed accordingly:
LIM and SH3 Protein 1 – in short LASP-1.

The LIM domain is an arrangement of eight cysteine and
histidine residues (C-X2-C-X16/23-H-X2-C-X2-C-X2-C-X16/
21-C-X2/3-C/D/H), is found in a number of vertebrate and
invertebrate proteins and known to mediate protein-protein interactions as a modular binding interface [1,3-5].
Although no binding partner for the LIM-domain of
LASP-1 has been identified so far, the zinc-finger module
in the LIM-domain of LASP-1 is a morphologically and
perhaps functionally independent folding-unit of this
protein harbouring the possibility of direct binding to
DNA [6].
The N-terminal LIM domain is followed by two nebulinlike repeats called R1 and R2 each 35 residues long enabling the protein to bind to F-actin. The actin-binding
domains of LASP-1 mediate a direct interaction between
LASP-1 and actin at cell membrane extensions [7-12]. The
binding of LASP-1 to actin stress fibres is mediated
through its interaction with palladin that binds to the SH3
domain of LASP-1. siRNA knock-down of palladin leads
to loss of LASP-1 at actin stress fibres and redirection to
focal contacts without changing actin filaments. Thus palladin is necessary to recruit LASP-1 to actin stress fibres
but not to focal contacts [13].
Via its nebulin-like actin-binding repeats LASP-1 has an
additional interaction with kelch related protein 1 (Krp1),
a focal adhesion protein involved in pseudopodial elongation and cell migration [14]. The binding between
LASP-1 and Krp1 occurs in co-localization to the membrane-bound integrin CD44 and to the adaptor protein
Ezrin – both of which mediate the cellular contact to the
extracellular matrix and intracellular signal transduction
in benign and malign cells [14-16].
The exact cellular function of LASP-1 is not known yet, but
the protein has previously been reported to localize
within multiple sites of dynamic actin assembly such as
focal contacts, focal adhesions, lamellipodia, membrane
ruffles, and pseudopodia [1,8,17-19], suggesting that it
plays an essential role in actin cytoskeleton organisation
at leading edges of migrating cells.
The actin-binding-motifs are followed by a linker-region
with several characterized specific phosphorylation residues at serine/threonine and tyrosine that regulate function and localization of the protein. In fact, human LASP1 is phosphorylated by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA and PKG) at serine 146 [9]. In rabbit
parietal cells, elevation of intracellular cAMP by forskolin
induced a partial translocation of LASP-1 to the apically
directed F-actin rich intracellular canaliculus, which is the
site of active HCl secretion [17,18,20]. Lack of gastrin
stimulation led to decreased LASP-1 phosphorylation and
subsequent lack of HCl secretion without changing total

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/7/1/31

amount of LASP-1 protein [21]. In PTK2 cells, transfected
with LASP-1 mutant S146D, the pseudo-phosphorylation
resulted in a translocation of the protein from the membrane to the cytosol, followed by reduced cell migration
[9].
In contrast to human LASP-1, murine LASP-1 is phosphorylated at threonine 156 by PKA and PKG. Nevertheless,
exposure of human and murine mesangial cells to forskolin induced a translocation of both, human and murine
LASP-1, from the focal contacts to the cell interior without
affecting F-actin structure and a comparison of various
murine and human tissues revealed a similar prominent
LASP-1 expression (Figure 1) [22]. Altogether, the existing
data suggest no functional differences between human
and murine LASP-1 [10].
Additionally, human LASP-1 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 171 by Abelson tyrosine kinase [19]. Abelson tyrosine kinase is strongly involved in carcinogenesis of
hematopoetic tumours, such as B-cell lymphomas [23].
Phosphorylation at tyrosine 171 is also associated with
loss of LASP-1 from focal adhesions and furthermore with
the initiation of cell death, but without changes in the
dynamics of migratory processes [19].
The C-terminal SH3 motif is a small domain of 60 amino
acids, first identified as a conserved sequence in the noncatalytic amino-terminal part of the src protein tyrosine
kinase. SH3 domain proteins are usually located close to
the plasma membrane, suggesting that the SH3 domain
may be implicated in localizing the protein to this cell
compartment [24].
In fact, LASP-1 primarily localizes to focal contacts, but
confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis of
cytosolic and nuclear preparations of various breast cancer cell lines also confirmed its nuclear localization [25].
Thus, LASP-1 is not exclusively a cytosolic protein, but is
also detectable within the nucleus.
At focal adhesions the C-terminal SH3 domain of LASP-1
is involved in protein-protein interactions through binding to proline-rich sequences, specifically with palladin,
lipoma preferred partner (LPP), Prointerleukin-16 (ProIL-16), vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)
and zyxin [10,26,27,13]. Recent data have shown that
after photobleaching of cells and subsequent destruction
of cytoskeletal networks, the recovery of LASP-1 and
LASP-2 occurred from the anterograde direction while
actin recovered inwards from the bundle tips, consistent
with the retrograde flow by treadmilling. These results
suggest that LASP-1 and -2 participate in the stabilisation
of actin-bundles but not in their initiation [11].

Relative expression pattern of murine (black columns) and human (gray columns) LASP-1 of selected tissues
in part adapted from Su et al. 2002 [22]. The median of LASP-1 expression in all tissue types that have been originally
analyzed by Su et al. was set at 100% (blue line); two fold value of the median is indicated in red. As seen in the graph LASP-1 is
expressed in a wide variety of human and murine tissues. High to excessive expression is observed during early embryonic
development, in immunocompetent cells, fetal brains, muscle cells, entire blood and colorectal carcinomas. Interestingly, LASP1 is not expressed at high levels in benign tissues of the reproductive tract (ovary and mammary gland), but has been reported
to be overexpressed in metastases of malign tumours derived from these tissues.

Invasion assays with a ΔSH3 deletion mutant of LASP-1
invariably led to the conclusion that especially its SH3
domain is necessary for pseudopodial formation, extension and invasion [14,28].
In summary, these multilateral protein-protein interactions mediated by the LIM and SH3 domains can be
regarded as scaffolds for the formation of protein complexes of higher order and imply that LASP-1 is an important structural protein of the cytoskeleton (Figure 2 and
Table 1).

Domain organization and functional structure of
human LASP-2
A novel LASP1-related gene, LASP2, was identified and
characterized by using bioinformatics. The nucleotide
sequence of human LASP2 cDNA was determined in silico
and the protein (270 aa) showed 97.4% and 63.7% totalamino-acid identity with murine LASP-2 and human
LASP-1, respectively [29]. Apparent molecular weights of
LASP-1 and LASP-2 are 38 kDa and accordingly 34 kDa.

LASP2 was found to be a splice variant of the Nebulin gene
and was therefore also termed LIM-nebulette. LASP2 has a
chimeric gene locus, which might be generated through
homologous recombination between the ancestral
LASP2-tem7l-cacnb2 locus on chromosome 10q12 and the
ancestral nebl-arl8 locus on chromosome 2q23 displaying
a classical example for gene fusion during evolution as
one of the mechanisms to generate alternative splice variants [29]. In contrast to sarcomeric nebulette, LASP-2
(LIM-nebulette) is also expressed in non-muscle cells. It
displays a modular structure with an N-terminal LIM
domain, three nebulin-like repeats and a C-terminal SH3
domain and shows high similarity to LASP-1 (Figure 2)
[27,29]. However, the linker domains differ significantly
between LASP-2 and LASP-1 while all other domains are
highly conserved in chicken, mouse, and human [30].
Like LASP-1, LASP-2 is also predominantly located at focal
contacts via its nebulin like repeats mediating binding to
F-actin and targeting the protein to focal adhesions [12].

screen revealed the specific interaction with zyxin, in
which the SH3 domain of LASP-2 is both necessary and
sufficient for zyxin binding [27]. LASP-2 shows a subcellular distribution at focal adhesions similar to LASP-1.
Thus, both proteins may play an important role in the
organization of focal adhesions in cooperation with zyxin
[27] which is a key player for correct assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions [31].
The exact cellular function of LASP-2 has not been fully
elucidated yet, but the structural differences of LASP-2 in
comparison to LASP-1 imply that its function and binding
partners might be distinct from those of LASP-1 (Figure 2
and Table 1).
LASP-1 and LASP-2 in invertebrates
Genes encoding proteins homologous to LASP1 and
LASP2 were also found in gene-databases of invertebrates
such as sea urchin, nematodes and insects. Recently, Terasaki et al. described and characterized LASP in the ascidian
Ciona intestinalis [32]. Multiple alignments between vertebrate and invertebrate LASP-proteins demonstrated a high
homology of their domains and the strong expression of

putative ancestral LASP in neural lineage cells and the
nerve cord of Ciona intestinalis is similar to the high
expression of LASP-1 and -2 in the CNS of vertebrates
[32]. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that the LASP1
and LASP2 genes might have been generated during evolution from invertebrates to vertebrates.
LASP-1 and LASP-2 are ubiquitously expressed and crucial
for cellular development and differentiation in vertebrates
Human LASP1 and LASP2 are located on chromosome
17q12 and 10p12/2q23, respectively [2,29]. The murine
gene of LASP1 was mapped by in situ hybridization to the
11C-11D region on chromosome 11. The isolation and
characterization of murine LASP1 cDNA showed that it is
highly conserved with its human counterpart. Sequence
alignment revealed a high level of identity of LASP1 and
LASP2 genes across species barriers [33].

The murine gene is expressed at basal levels in almost all
adult tissues and at high levels during murine embryogenesis from blastocyste stage to day 17.5 as shown by Microarray and Northern blot analysis [22,34], indicating an

gesting a participation in stabilisation of actin bundles
[11].

Suitably, LASP1 was characterized as one gene out of six
inserted into a 185-kb contig sequence flanking a transgene on distal murine chromosome 11 that caused a
recessive phenotype with skeletal malformation [35]. A
comparison with the corresponding LASP1 region on
human chromosome 17q12 revealed several small-scale
rearrangements during evolutionary divergence within
this cluster of densely packed genes, hinting to a crucial
function of LASP-1 in embryo- and fetogenesis [35]. In
further support of this hypothesis it has been shown that
human mesenchymal stem cells start to express LASP-1 in
parallel to acquiring the capacity for osteogenic differentiation [36].

When expressed as a truncated form (LASP-1ΔSH3) LASP1 remains co-localized with F-actin at the tips of pseudopodia but pseudopodia elongation is suppressed demonstrating the important role of LASP-1 in cell motility
[14]. Whether this effect is solely dependent on LASP-1
dysfunction or the disrupted binding of the SH3 domain
interacting partners remains to be elucidated.

LASP-1 and -2: interaction with the cytoskeleton
LASP-1 and LASP-2 are actin-binding scaffolding proteins
[8]. LASP-1 has been reported to regulate cell migration,
proliferation and to localize at focal adhesions, along
stress fibres and leading edges like lamellipodia, filopodia
and pseudopodia [8,9]. LASP-2 co-localizes to actin filament bundles in neuronal cell lines [30] as well as in focal
adhesions and at intercalated discs in cardiac myocytes
[37].

During cell migration actin is supplied to the extending
lamellipodia tips to push the cell forward thereby producing a retrograde flow. This process was revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) with eGFPactin as well as eGFP-LASP-1 and -2. During the rapid
process of exchanging actin bundles LASP-1 and -2
recover from the anterograde direction over actin bundles
into the tips of lamellipodia. In addition, a lateral crosslinking of actin filaments by LASP-1 and -2 is visible sug-

In non-motile serum-starved cells, LASP-1 is localized to
the peripheral edge of the cell. Exposure of the cells to
growth factors that activate cell migration caused a rapid
(1–2 min) relocalisation of LASP-1 from the periphery to
focal adhesions and later on (>15 min) to actin-rich membrane ruffles on the cell surface [11]. Interestingly, depletion of LASP-1 did not cause differences in adhesion and
spreading of the cells but significantly reduced the ability
of the cells to migrate [19,38,39]. Phosphorylation of
LASP-1 at tyrosine 171 by Abl-kinase prevents translocation of LASP-1 to focal contacts [19] while phosphorylation at serine 146 by PKA renders the protein more
cytosolic [9].
In striated muscle cells LASP-1 localizes to A-bands and Zdiscs implying a role for LASP-1 as a structural protein in
contractile cells [12]. Consistently a high expression of
LASP-1 was observed in human vascular smooth muscle
cells and myoepithelial cells of mammary glands [38,39].
Recently, LASP-2 was detected in heart and skeletal muscle [37]. The protein crosslinks and organizes actin filaments into bundles and directly interacts with the Z-disc
protein α-actinin [12,37] suggesting a crucial role in myofilament assembly and stabilisation (Table 1). In contrast

Page 5 of 12

Molecular Cancer 2008, 7:31

to LASP-1, LASP-2 is not detectable at A-bands of striated
muscle cells. This disparity in localization might be due to
specific structural differences in the linker regions and
number of nebulin repeats of these proteins [12] (Figure
2).
LASP-1 and LASP-2 are highly expressed in the central
nervous system
Both, LASP-1 and -2 are highly present in the central nervous system as they are prominently expressed in the fetal
and adult brain. Compared to LASP-2, which additionally
is highly expressed in striated muscle cells, LASP-1 displays a broader expression pattern also among various
non-muscle tissues [30,37,40,41] (Figure 1).

As expected from its structural similarity to LASP-1, LASP2 possesses actin-binding activity and co-localizes with
actin filaments in filopodia of neuroblastoma cells [30].
LASP-1 is expressed in cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum
and densely concentrated at the postsynaptic membrane
of dendritic spines [40,41]. Although the exact function of
LASP-1 in CNS is still unclear a region on chromosome 17
has recently been highlighted in multiple studies as being
linked to autism (MIM [209850]). A dense panel of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was selected across the
linkage peak and analyzed in a trio-based study design.
Nominally significant single SNPs and/or haplotypebased association results were detected in 15 genes, of
which, MYO1D, ACCN1 and LASP1 stand out as genes
with autism risk alleles [42].
Moreover, analysis of the molecular signature in neurons
under homocysteic acid induced neuronal stress revealed,
that, together with several other proteins well known as
risk factors in schizophrenia and neurodegeneration,
LASP-1 was modified by phosphorylation. Homocysteic
acid induces calcium influx into neurons. On the molecular level this is correlated with fast modification of proteins like phosphorylation and proteolysis. Thus the
observed phosphorylation suggests a role of LASP-1 in
homocysteic acid induced neurotoxicity [43].
Furthermore, during early differentiation of cultured hippocampal cells LASP-1 initially localizes mainly at the
leading sites of growth cones but distributes immediately
along the dendritic membranes and subsequently clusters
at postsynaptic densities of dendritic spines [40]. Consistently, LASP1, but not LASP2, belongs to a group of several
strongly upregulated genes in response to nerve growth
factor (β-NGF) stimulation in phaeochromocytomal
PC12 cells, which are commonly used as a cell model for
neurite outgrowth [44]. These data indicate that in particular LASP-1 is involved in neuronal differentiation and
development (Table 1 and 2).

LASP-1 within gastric parietal cell HCl secretion
LASP-1 is widely distributed among various secretory tissues e.g. in epithelial cells of the kidney, in ductal cells of
the exocrine pancreas and in gastric parietal cells (Figure
1) [17]. The resting parietal cells contain membranous
tubules and vesicles that represent the storage depot of the
H+/K+-ATPase proton pump. Upon stimulation the tubulovesicles fuse with the apical membrane for HCl secretion [20]. In unstimulated gastric parietal cells LASP-1 is
localized at the cell cortex (basolateral region). Histamine
induced phosphorylation of LASP-1 by PKA induced a
partial redistribution of LASP-1 from the cortical membrane to the actin enriched apically-directed intracellular
tubuli, the site of active proton transport [8,18]. Movement of the vesicles is in part controlled by dynamin, a
large GTPase that regulates the fusion of vesicles with the
plasma membrane. In this context, LASP-1 has been identified as a dynamin binding protein implying a regulatory
function of LASP-1 in HCl secretion by linking the vesicular trafficking machinery with the cytoskeleton [20] (Table
1).
LASP-1 is over-expressed in human breast and ovarian
cancer
LASP-1 expression has been reported to be increased in
metastatic breast and ovarian cancer, suggesting that overexpression of LASP-1 may be involved in the migratory
process of cancer cells [1,25]. Knock-down of LASP-1 by
RNA-interference in metastatic breast and ovarian cancer
cell lines did not lead to induction of apoptosis or necrosis but to strong inhibition of migration and proliferation
with cell cycle arrest in G2-phase, while artificial overexpression of LASP-1 in non-neoplastic PTK2 cells
resulted in a dramatic acceleration of migration [38,39].
These observations are supported by a case-control study
correlating the histological scored expression level of
LASP-1, with standard clinicopathological parameters. In
this report, LASP-1 expression was significantly higher in
invasive human breast carcinomas compared to fibroadenomas with strong cytoplasmatic staining for LASP-1 in
55.4% of the invasive tumours. Although levels of LASP-1
expression did not correlate with histological tumour
grading, c-erbB2-, estrogen- or progesterone-expression
they did correlate significantly with increased tumour size
and rate of nodal-positivity. These data indicate an important role of LASP-1 in proliferation and migration of ovarian and breast cancer cells [25].

In a bovine mammary gland model system, microarray
experiments yielded many interesting genes exhibiting
differential expression in developing and/or lactating
mammary tissue, including oncogenes (VAV3, C-myc),
mediators of apoptosis (Caspase 8), and LASP-1 [45].
Thus we assume that LASP-1 might as well be necessary

ated through down regulation of LASP-1 and other
proteins enhancing anchorage independent migration.

During recent years LASP1 was identified in several microarray studies that analysed genes associated with tumour
development and cancer progression (overview given in
Table 2).

A recent study identified genes associated with insulinlike growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)-mediated cellular
transformation. In cells overexpressing the IGF-IR, LASP-1
is also overexpressed. MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated
with IGF-I exhibit upregulated expression of LASP-1 as
well. Expression induction required the activation of the
PI3-kinase signalling pathway, suggesting that LASP-1
may mediate IGF-IR function in cancer progression and
operates as a signal transducer [49].

LASP-1 is differentially up regulated in several breast cancer cell lines with E-cadherin-mutations and subsequent
accelerated migration. E-cadherin is a cell-cell adhesion
molecule and tumour invasion suppressor gene frequently altered in human cancers. Through its cytoplasmic domain it interacts with beta-catenin which in turn
interacts with the WNT (wingless) signalling pathway
affecting a number of target genes – among them LASP1
[46,47]. Anti-WNT1 monoclonal antibodies show promising in vitro effects in cancer treatment [48], maybe medi-

In a study, which established a prognostic index for nodalpositive breast cancer, all 20 patients were LASP1 positive
only differing in mRNA expression levels [50]. However,
in patients that died within 5 years after surgery LASP1

was found to be one out of five genes with decreased
expression levels.

cells but also has the ability to shuttle into the nucleus like
LPP [31,59].

Several additional observations underscore the important
role of LASP-1 in cancer: Altered LASP-1 expression was
associated with the MLL gene in acute myeloid leukemia
through forming a new translocation-gene of the LASP1
and MLL gene in a patient with a high risk of stratification.
In this patient two different versions of this new fusion
gene t(11;17)(q23;q12-21) were identified: a 5'MLL3'LASP1 and the reciprocal 5'LASP1-3'MLL translocationgene [51,52].

Silencing of zyxin in HeLa cells resulted in a significant
reduction of actin stress fibers [60] whereas under cyclic
stretch zyxin only dissociated from focal contacts and
accumulated in the nucleus, without affecting vinculin or
actin filaments [61]. In genetically zyxin-deficient fibroblasts, the cells display deficits in actin cytoskeleton remodeling [62].

LASP-1 is also transcriptionally upregulated in response to
the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog [53] (Table 2). Disruption of the Hedgehog signalling cascade leads to a number
of developmental disorders and plays a key role in the formation of a wide range of human cancers [54].
LASP-1 binds to LPP and zyxin and is localised in the
nucleus
In a recent paper variable expression of LASP-1 in breast
cancer was detected. In addition to the reported localization at focal contacts and in the tops of lamellipodia, the
authors observed a perinuclear and nuclear distribution of
the protein [25]. However, sequence analysis revealed no
nuclear localization signal for the classical nuclear import
pathway. On the other hand, the zinc-finger containing
LIM-domain of LASP-1 offers the possibility of direct
binding to DNA [6] and LASP-1 may even form heterodomains to become a nuclear transcription factor [55].
Therefore, LASP-1 binding partners might transport the
protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.

LASP-1 interacts with LPP, a shuttle protein and transcription factor that transduces signals from focal contacts to
the nucleus [10]. LPP is a known interaction partner of the
tumour suppressor protein Scrib and both proteins colocalize in cell-cell contacts. This interaction links Scrib to
a communication pathway between cell-cell contacts and
the nucleus, and implicates LPP in Scrib-associated functions. In various benign and malignant tumours, LPP is
present in a mutant form, which permanently resides in
the nucleus [56,57]. Although the role of this interaction
between LASP-1 and LPP is still unclear, LASP-1 might be
embedded into this novel signalling cascade for tumour
growth and migration.
In this context it is interesting to note that also the LASP1 binding partner zyxin has been identified as a differentially transcribed gene in several types of cancer by microarray technology [58].
Zyxin is localized primarily at focal adhesion plaques and
is crucial for actin filament polymerization in mammalian

LASP-1 silencing in human breast and ovarian cancer cells
led to a diffuse cytoplasmic localization of zyxin without
protein loss and without changes in neither vinculin distribution nor actin stress fiber organization, emphasizing
the importance of LASP-1 for binding and recruiting zyxin
to focal adhesions [38,39].
The loss of zyxin at the sites of focal contacts without
changing cellular zyxin protein levels is not restricted to
cancer cells but was also observed in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells [38]. Interestingly, in these cells
zyxin could still be detected along the actin stress fibres,
indicating the potential existence of another zyxin-recruiting protein along actin stress fibres [8,9].
In zyxin knock-down experiments neither changes in
LASP-1 localization, actin cytoskeleton nor vinculin distribution were detectable indicating that zyxin alone does
not change focal adhesion morphology [39]. This is concordant with the fact, that genetically zyxin-deficient
fibroblasts even show enhanced adhesion to surfaces and
increased integrin expression [62]. In synopsis, LASP-1
and zyxin silencing studies have demonstrated that LASP1 is necessary and sufficient for recruiting zyxin to focal
contacts [38,39] (Table 1).
The decreased cell motility after LASP-1 silencing can be
explained by the functional loss of zyxin as a scaffolding
protein that facilitates the formation of molecular complexes to promote site-specific actin assembly required for
cell migration. This is in agreement with previous findings
using a non-genetic approach by injecting a peptide
derived from the N-terminus of zyxin to displace zyxin
from its normal subcellular location and thus leading to
reduced cell migration [63]. On the other hand, the siRNA
mediated knock-down of zyxin in SKOV-3 cells had no
influence on cell migration [39] while genetically zyxindeficient fibroblasts displayed enhanced migration [62].
To date these disparate effects have not been fully elucidated but may be due to specific cellular features.
Zyxin also shuttles through the nucleus – most likely by
association with other LIM-proteins – and regulates gene
transcription [55,59,64]. During mitosis, a fraction of

Page 8 of 12

Molecular Cancer 2008, 7:31

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/7/1/31

zyxin associates with the tumour suppressor h-warts
(LATS1) at the mitotic apparatus [65]. H-warts (LATS1) is
a key player in mitosis in mammalian cells and loss of its
function disrupts normal cell cycle regulation possibly
leading to tumor development [66]. In BT-20, MCF-7 and
SKOV-3 cells transfected with LASP-1 specific siRNA,
zyxin has been shown to dissociate from focal adhesion
plaques and to distribute diffusely into the cytoplasm. It
is therefore likely that part of zyxin enters the nucleus,
binds to h-warts and leads to G2 cell cycle arrest and inhibition of proliferation as observed after LASP-1 silencing
[38,39].

The high degree of structural and amino acid identity
between LASP-1 and LASP-2 would suggest that both proteins are functionally redundant, particularly because
both proteins are strongly expressed during early embryoand fetogenesis. However, after expansive study of the literature we conclude that, despite their similarities, LASP1 and LASP-2 have distinct functions. Although both proteins are expressed in high levels in the CNS, only LASP-1
seems to be significantly involved in neuronal differentiation upon growth factor stimulation and appears to be of
importance in epithelial cancer development regarding
tumour cell migration and proliferation.

When located at focal contacts, zyxin enhances cell migration [63]. Therefore it is conceivable, that tumour cells
overexpressing LASP-1 could recruit more zyxin to focal
contacts and thereby contribute to accelerated proliferation and migration of these cells, as higher LASP-1 expression, indeed correlates with metastatic stage and tumour
size of human breast cancer [25]. A schematic illustration
of this hypothetical functional aspect of LASP-1 is
depicted in Figure 3.

Further studies will be necessary to define the exact physiological functions and to delineate more the differences
in function between these highly homologous proteins.

Interestingly, in Ewing tumor cells zyxin is only expressed
at very low levels and remains diffusely distributed
throughout the cytoplasm instead of concentrating in
actin-rich dynamic structures. Zyxin gene transfer into
EWS-FLI1-transformed fibroblasts leads to inhibition of
anchorage independent tumor growth, indicating that
zyxin has tumor suppressor activity in these cells [67].
Furthermore, LASP-1 interacts via its SH3-domain with
Prointerleukin-16 (Pro-IL-16) [26]. Pro-IL-16 is expressed
in both, nucleus and cytoplasm of T cells. Cytoplasmic
Pro-IL-16 serves as precursor for mature IL-16 while
nuclear pro-IL-16 is associated with G0/G1 cell cycle arrest
and with T lymphocyte cell cycle growth suppression [68]
indicating a potential role for LASP-1 in modifying T lymphocyte proliferation since it is highly expressed in T-lymphocytes as well [22] (Table 1 and Figure 1)

Conclusion
To date, an ensemble of more than 50 different structural
proteins have been identified that orchestrate the rate and
organization of actin polymerization and focal adhesion
turnover in protrusion. Moreover, there is a growing
number of proteins, that have a dual function in serving
as a structural and signalling protein [69]. There are several lines of evidence for LASP-1 being such a dual protein. On the one hand it binds to F-actin and is involved
in actin-bundle stabilization [7-9,11], but then shuttles to
the nucleus and interacts with LPP [10] and zyxin [27]
implying a function in modulating their signalling pathways.
