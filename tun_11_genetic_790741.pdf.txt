Abstract
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is prevalent in Thailand, causing a huge impact on
the country’s swine industry. Yet the diversity and origin of these Thai PRRSVs remained vague. In this context, we
collected all the Thai PRRSV sequences described earlier and incorporated them into the global diversity. The
results indicated that PRRSVs in Thailand were originated from multiple introductions involving both Type 1 and
Type 2 PRRSVs. Many of the introductions were followed by extensive geographic expansion, causing regional
co-circulation of diverse PRRSV variants in three major pig-producing provinces. Based on these results, we suggest
(1) to avoid blind vaccination and to apply vaccines tailor-made for target diversity, (2) to monitor pig importation
and transportation, and (3) to implement a better biosecurity to reduce horizontal transmissions as three
potentially effective strategies of controlling PRRS in Thailand.
1. Introduction
PRRSV is a major swine disease virus causing economic
losses in swine industry worldwide including Thailand.
This disease was first reported during almost concurrent
epidemics in the North American countries (late 1980s)
[1,2] and in the European countries (early 1990) [3].
The causative agent, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) belongs to the family
Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales [4]. It is an enveloped virus containing a positive-sense RNA genome of
approximately 15 kb in length, encoding at least nine
open reading frames (ORFs) including ORF1a, 1b, 2a,
2b, and 3-7 [5]. Among them, ORF5 encoding the major
envelope protein is often used for phylogenetic analysis
because of its high variability. PRRSV can be divided
into two major genotypes: Type 1 (European strains)
and Type 2 (North American strains). Both genotypes
are found to be genetically and antigenically heterogeneous [6,7]. According to the recent reports for PRRSV
classification, Type 1 PRRSV is divided into 3 subtypes.

Among them, the cosmopolitan Subtype I was further
divided into 12 different clades [8,9]. For Type 2
PRRSV, 9 well-defined lineages have been described
[8,10].
PRRSV has been circulating in Thailand for a long
time. Seropositive animals could be traced back to as
early as 1989, and seropositive rate increased annually
from 1991 to 2002 [11]. In 1996, the first Thai PRRSV
was isolated and was identified as Type 2 PRRSV [12].
A few years later, Type 1 PRRSV was also reported in
Thailand, and some was found to be co-circulating with
Type 2 PRRSV within the same herd [11]. Despite of
the effort on characterizing PRRSV diversity in Thailand, the origin and epidemiological history of the
viruses remain unknown. This study re-analyzes previously characterized Thai sequences in the context of
global PRRSV diversity, which helps shed lights on the
potential origin and prevalence of different variants of
PRRSVs in Thailand.

regions of Thailand during 2000 to 2008. All pig farms
are multi-site farms and practicing partial all in-all out
and mostly continuous-flow system. The infected pigs
or tissue samples or sera were submitted to the Chulalongkorn University-Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory
(CU-VDL). Virus isolation was performed by using
MARC-145 cells and PRRSV positive result was confirmed by PCR and Immunoperoxidase monolayer assay
(IPMA) using SDOW17 [11,13].
2.2 Data sets

Four hundred and twenty two complete Type 1 and five
hundred and eighty one complete Type 2 PRRSV ORF5
gene sequences were downloaded from Gene Bank and
PRRSV database http://prrsvdb.org/ as reference backbone. The sequences are comprised of sequences representative of diversity of Type 1 [8] and Type 2 [10] and
all available Thai PRRSV ORF5 sequences (Table 1). All
Thai PRRSVs were sequenced at CU-VDL during 2000
to 2008 [11,13].
Table 1 Thailand PRRSVs analyzed in this study

2.3 Phylogenetic reconstruction

The ORF5 nucleotide sequences were aligned in
MUSCLE v3.6 [14], using default settings with minor
manual adjustments. The alignments were then screened
for recombination using Recombination Detection Program v.2 [15]. No recombination was found in the alignment. Then, a phylogeny was constructed using a
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method
implemented in MrBayes v.3.2 [16]. A general timereversible nucleotide substitution model with 4 categories of gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity and a
proportion of invariant sites (GTR+ Γ4+I) were used.
The posterior distribution of trees and model parameters were summarized from Markov Chain Monte
Carlo sampling over 10 million generations, during
which trees were sampled every 1000 generations. We
adopted the classification system from the previous
report [8,10] for lineage diversity of Thai sequences.
Average pairwise genetic distances between two lineages
were calculated to evaluate the interlineage genetic
diversity.

Type 2 PRRSV in Thailand was originated from at least
three independent introductions, which is evidenced by
three monophyletic clusters: one (n = 9) within Lineage
1 while another one (n = 1) within Lineage 5 and the
other (n = 3) as an orphan cluster that is beyond the
description of current classification system by Shi et al
(2010b). The phylogenetic backbone suggested this
orphan cluster had closer relation to Lineage 6-9 forming a monophyl supported by high posterior probability
(0.93). Nevertheless, further classification for this cluster

* Thai PRRSV prototypes.

3.1 Type 1 PRRSV in Thailand

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were at least
four independent introductions of Type 1 PRRSV into
Thailand during 2000 to 2008. Among these introductions, three of them were from Clade A (Lelystad-like)
while the other from Clade H. The definite sources of
these introductions are difficult to identify due to complex geographic constituents for both clades (Figure
1A). Nevertheless, one Thai sequence (02CB12, 2002)
was found to be closely related to the prototype (LV)
with 98.5% of similarity as well as Porcilis® PRRS with
99.1% of similarity (Intervet, The Netherlands) in Clade
A (Figure 1A) indicating virus sample 02CB12 is probably a vaccine re-isolate or a vaccine descendant.
Despite multiple introductions, the prevalence and
diversity of Type 1 PRRSV in Thailand was quite limited
except for those within Clade H (n = 6), which had an
average genetic distance of 7% and a maximum pair of
genetic distance of 10%.

remains unattainable. Since this orphan cluster had larger than 10% average genetic distances with those established lineages, we suggest this cluster as an
independent lineage. Moreover, Thai prototype of Type
2 PRRSV (01NP1.2) has 100% nucleotide identity with
MLV vaccine in Lineage 5 indicating an apparent vaccine re-isolate or vaccine descendant.
The major proportion of Thai Type 2 PRRSVs formed
a single cluster within Lineage 1 (Figure 1B). This cluster had the largest diversity comparing to other Thai

clusters, with an average genetic distance of 9% and a
maximum pair of genetic distance of 14%. In addition,
our estimation of the tMRCA of this cluster suggested
an introduction time of around early 1990s if not earlier
(Tun, personal communication).
3.3 Geographic distribution of PRRSV in Thailand

In order to examine the distribution spread of PRRSVs
after their initial introduction into Thailand, geographical locations with different shapes were marked as

previously described (in section 3.1 and 3.2) as Type 1
and 2 Thai clusters. Each represented an independent
introduction event (Figure 2). For some provinces
(Chonburi, Ratchaburi and Nakhon Pathom) in central
Thailand, co-circulation of multiple clusters from the
two types of PRRSV was observed whereas others had
only one cluster of PRRSV. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the Thai cluster within Lineage 1 had the
widest distribution, spreading to at least 8 provinces in
Thailand (Figure 2).

4. Discussion
The appearance of the vaccine-related strains in Thailand is of interest since the Porcilis® PRRS is not commercially available in Thailand. One possibility is the
smuggling or unauthorized use of this modified live vaccine. Alternatively, it might originate from previous
introduction of vaccinated breeder animals. In Thailand,
most of the swine breeders and frozen semen have been
continuously imported from both European and North
American countries. Evidences of seropositivity have
been reported in the imported pigs and semen from
previous retrospective study [12]. Despite of the presence of vaccine-related PRRSVs in Thailand, their
impact to the swine industry was most likely insignificant. It is because for each vaccine-related variant, only
one sequence was identified in the phylogeny. And no
transmission chain has been identified to be seeded by
these vaccine strains..
Interestingly, three Type 2 PRRSV isolates collected
from 2007 and 2008 belong to an orphan lineage which
has limited diversity but is well isolated from any of the
established lineages. This is also supported by NSP2
phylogeny, where the Thai orphan lineage (08NP147) is
distantly related to other Type 2 PRRSV [17]. The missing diversity between the orphan lineage and other
lineages are most likely due to incomplete sampling in
Thailand. Indeed, the sampling in this study is limited
by not only quantity, but also time span, compared to
that of North America. Therefore, we suggest more
intensive sampling and characterization of PRRSV in
Thailand to fill in the diversity gaps.
Our recent biogeographic analyses on Type 2 PRRSV
suggest that Lineage 6-9 were mostly endemic in the
United States whereas Lineage 1 and 2 were originally
circulating in Canada and later emerged in the United
States due to intensive pig flow from Canada to the United States (Shi, unpublished data). Since the Thai
orphan lineage is clustered within Lineage 6-9, it was
most likely introduced from the United States. On the
other hand, the Thai cluster within Lineage 1 was
potentially introduced from Canada or United States.
The Canadian origin of this cluster is more favored,
because its common ancestor was estimated as early

introductions and extensive geographic expansion, causing regional

1990s, which is earlier than the emergences of Lineage 1
and 2 PRRSV in the United States. Yet this perspective
remains to be examined by incorporating earlier Canadian samples into the phylogenetic analyses.

Chonburi, Ratchaburi and Nakhon Pathom are three
major Thai swine producing provinces located in the central region. Evidence based on our phylogenetic analyses
show co-circulation of multiple clusters of both genotypes of PRRSV in these three provinces. This co-circulation of multiple PRRS viruses renders huge burden on
the swine industry in these areas, because it might cause
succession of PRRSV infection (due to lack of cross-protection for heterologous infection) and recombination.
Since our analyses are based on ORF5 sequence alignment, no recombination events were detected but potential recombination breakpoint may exist in other part of
the genome. In addition, we are able to identify a widely
distributed Thai cluster (Lineage 1 of Type 2) originated
from an introduction of approximately 20 years ago.
Additionally, it is likely the movement of the PRRSV
infected pigs between the herds that maintain the transmission chain of this particular cluster.
Our study demonstrates multiple introductions of
PRRSV strains into Thailand, which result in co-circulation of diverse PRRSV strains in some areas. This posts
difficulty on the vaccine selection since current monovalent vaccine has been shown to provide no or only partial protection against heterologous PRRSV strains
[6,18,19]. Therefore, correct choice of vaccine is essential for prevention and control of PRRSV in Thailand. In
addition to vaccination, the virus control measures
should also aim for pig importation and transportation.
First, an upgraded biosecurity system is required to prevent not only the introduction of new types of PRRSV
into Thailand, but also the subsequent dissemination of
the viruses among major pig-producing provinces. Second, it is necessary to establish a surveillance system
which monitors the pig flows. This helps provide timely
remedy in cases of outbreak.
