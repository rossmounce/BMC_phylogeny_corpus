Structural adaptation of extreme halophilic
proteins through decrease of conserved
hydrophobic contact surface
Alessandro Siglioccolo†, Alessandro Paiardini†, Maria Piscitelli and Stefano Pascarella*

Abstract
Background: Halophiles are extremophilic microorganisms growing optimally at high salt concentrations. There
are two strategies used by halophiles to maintain proper osmotic pressure in their cytoplasm: accumulation of
molar concentrations of potassium and chloride with extensive adaptation of the intracellular macromolecules
("salt-in” strategy) or biosynthesis and/or accumulation of organic osmotic solutes ("osmolyte” strategy). Our work
was aimed at contributing to the understanding of the shared molecular mechanisms of protein haloadaptation
through a detailed and systematic comparison of a sample of several three-dimensional structures of halophilic
and non-halophilic proteins. Structural differences observed between the “salt-in” and the mesophilic homologous
proteins were contrasted to those observed between the “osmolyte” and mesophilic pairs.
Results: The results suggest that haloadaptation strategy in the presence of molar salt concentration, but not of
osmolytes, necessitates a weakening of the hydrophobic interactions, in particular at the level of conserved
hydrophobic contacts. Weakening of these interactions counterbalances their strengthening by the presence of
salts in solution and may help the structure preventing aggregation and/or loss of function in hypersaline
environments.
Conclusions: Considering the significant increase of biotechnology applications of halophiles, the understanding
of halophilicity can provide the theoretical basis for the engineering of proteins of great interest because stable at
concentrations of salts that cause the denaturation or aggregation of the majority of macromolecules.

Background
Organisms thriving in “extreme environments”, such as
thermophiles, alkalophiles, acidophiles, halophiles, piezophiles and psychrophiles, have drawn much interest in
the scientific community because of the molecular adaptation they underwent during evolution and for their
biotechnological potential [1-4]. The environmental
challenges that extremophilic organisms have to face
necessitate, besides other physiological modifications,
biosynthesis of macromolecules stable and active at
environmental physical-chemical extreme conditions.
These macromolecules display clearly distinguished features when compared to the macromolecules from

microorganisms found in the “normal” (mesophilic)
environments [5].
Halophilic microorganisms are salt-loving extremophilic organisms that grow optimally at high salt concentrations. They were found [6] mainly in marine salterns
and hypersaline lakes, such as the Great Salt Lake and
the Dead Sea. A survey of the salt requirements in the
microbial world shows a continuum of properties which
makes it very difficult to define by sharp limits what a
halophilic microorganism is. The accepted view [6] distinguishes the halophilic organisms in: extreme halophiles (growing best in media containing 2.5-5.2 M salt),
borderline extreme halophiles (growing best is media
containing 1.5-4.0 M salt), moderate halophiles (growing
best in media containing 0.5-2.5 M salt), and halotolerant microorganisms that do not show an absolute
requirement for salt for growth but grow well up to
often very high salt concentrations (considered

extremely halotolerant if the growth range extends
above 2.5 M salt).
Distribution of halophilic microorganisms within the
tree of life shows that they are widespread in the bacterial and Archaea kingdoms. Eukaryotic halophilic microorganisms, such as fungi and algae, are also known [7].
All halophilic microorganisms share a basic property:
their cytoplasm must be at least isoosmotic with their
surrounding medium. There are two strategies used by
halophilic microorganisms to maintain proper osmotic
pressure in their cytoplasm. The first involves accumulation of molar concentrations of potassium and chloride.
This strategy requires extensive adaptation of the intracellular enzymatic machinery to the presence of salts, as
the proteins should maintain their proper conformation
and activity at near-saturating salt concentrations. The
proteome of such organisms is highly acidic, and most
proteins denature when suspended in low salt. Generally, the microorganisms relying on such “salt-in” strategy are obligate halophilic Archaea. The other strategy
of haloadaptation is based on the biosynthesis and/or
accumulation of organic osmotic solutes (osmolytes)
such as ectoin, glycine betaine or others [8]. Cells relying on this strategy exclude salts from their cytoplasm
as much as possible. The high concentrations of organic
“compatible” solutes do not greatly interfere with normal enzymatic activity. Fewer adaptations of the cells’
proteome are therefore needed. Such organisms can
often adapt to a broad salt concentration range [6].
Halophilic proteins from “salt-in” organisms are distinguished from their non-halophilic homologous proteins by exhibiting remarkable instability in low salt
concentration and by maintaining soluble and active
conformations in an environment generally detrimental
to other proteins. Indeed, hypersaline conditions favor
protein aggregation and collapse, interfere with the electrostatic interactions between protein residues, and are
responsible for a general decrease in the availability of
water molecules [9]. Halophilic proteins, rather than
being unfolded by these conditions, appear to be dependent on the presence of salts. In recent years, detailed
investigations have tried to unveil the relationships
between structure and stability in halophilic proteins
[10]. In particular, these studies suggested that the halophilic proteins bind significant amounts of salt and
water in solvent conditions similar to their physiological
environment. The peculiar ability of halophilic proteins
to bind large amount of salts is largely dependent on
the number of acidic amino acids on protein surface
[11-17]. The role of electrostatic interactions in the stability and folding of halophilic proteins has been investigated and recognized as a key determinant of
haloadaptation [18,19]. Moreover, it was observed that
halophilic proteins are characterized by a general

Page 2 of 12

decrease in hydrophobic amino acid frequency and a
greater propensity to form random-coil structures,
rather than a-helices [15]. Indeed, protein folding and
adequate stability of the native structure in a hypersaline
environment may require evolutionary modulation of
the hydrophobic interactions occurring at the protein
core. Most of the studies carried out to unveil the structural characteristics of halophilic proteins, were based
on sequence comparison at proteome and genome levels
or were focused onto single or few protein families.
These analyses provided undoubtedly valuable indications on the biophysical and biochemical properties of
the halophilic proteins. However, scrutiny of proteome
and genomic sequences may not unravel subtle differences at the three-dimensional structural level while
structural analysis of a single or few protein families
may lack sufficient generalization. For these reasons we
report in this work a systematic comparison between
the available three-dimensional structures of halophilic
enzymes deposited in the data banks and the structure
of one of their homologues, to investigate the differences possibly related to shared strategies of structural
adaptation to high salt environments. Use of threedimensional structure made it possible to investigate
subtle modifications of the surface and hydrophobic
core of the halophilic proteins especially at the level of
conserved hydrophobic contacts [20].

Results
Data set

A set of 15 halophilic enzymes, 9 of which from
“extreme” halophiles and 6 from “halotolerant” organisms, was collected along with their non-halophilic
structural homologues (Table 1). Among the halophilic
enzymes, 8 come from Archaea that adopt the “salt-in”
strategy (SALTIN), and 7 from Eubacteria that adopt
the “osmolytes” strategy (OSMOL). In this paper, the
entire analysis was carried out considering the two
groups separately.
Four pairs of halophilic enzymes (PDB ID: 2B5W,
2J5K, 1NML, 3IGN) have a quaternary structure different from their non-halophilic homologs (Table 1) and
therefore were excluded from the calculations involving
proteins in their quaternary structure, such as calculation of the electrostatic potential surface. The pair cytochrome c552 from Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus
(PDB ID: 1CNO) and from Pseudomonas stutzeri (PDB
ID: 1ETP) has been included in the analysis, for the reasons explained in Methods section.
Accessible surface area and electrostatic potential

To calculate the relative solvent accessibility (ASA) and
the magnitude of the relative polar and apolar components, protein structures were used in their quaternary

nitrogen atoms was calculated. The area subset formed
only by side-chain oxygen or nitrogen atoms (namely,
excluding atoms belonging to the polypeptide backbone)
was also considered.
In SALTIN enzymes, the fractional apolar component
of the relative solvent accessible surface is significantly
smaller than the corresponding area in non-halophilic
counterparts (ΔApA in Table 2). The polar area formed
by oxygen atoms is significantly larger in halophilic
enzymes; the same result is obtained when the analysis
is repeated excluding backbone oxygen atoms and
including only side-chain oxygen atoms. Likewise, the

polar area formed by nitrogen atoms is significantly
smaller than the corresponding area in non-halophilic
counterparts; the same result is obtained when the analysis is repeated without backbone nitrogen atoms and
including only side-chain nitrogen atoms. These differences are reflected in the surface electrostatic potential,
which is significantly more negative in halophilic
enzymes than in the non-halophilic counterparts (Table
3). In OSMOL sample, the apolar component of the
relative solvent accessibility was also significantly smaller
than the corresponding area in non-halophilic counterparts (Table 2); however, the decreased surface is caused
solely by the increase of the polar area formed by side-

the subset of residues identically conserved between the
halophilic and the corresponding non-halophilc homologue in the SALTIN and OSMOL samples. In this case,
no significant difference was seen in the exposed areas
(see additional file 1).
Surface electrostatic potential displays no significant
difference although, in 3 out of 5 pairs, it is more negative in the OSMOL halophilic proteins (Table 3).

Apolar contact area

The apolar contact area (ACA) between residues was
calculated for three different structural regions namely
the core, the interface between the monomers and the
protein surface. Residues were assigned to the various
structural regions according to the alternative accessibility thresholds described in the Methods section.
ACA in the core of SALTIN halophilic proteins is not
significantly different, according to the statistical tests,
from the ACA of their homologous counterparts. However, it is consistently smaller (Figure 1). This trend is

an ACA that is globally comparable with that of nonhalophilic counterparts (Figure 1), even at 0% accessibility threshold.
Likewise, ACA in the SALTIN monomer interface is
not significantly dissimilar from the ACA of their nonhalophilic counterparts. However, even in this case, all
the ΔACAs were negative except for the pair 3IFV1RWZ. The analysis at interface for OSMOL enzymes is
reduced to two pairs and is therefore of no statistical
interest, however, the ACA formed by interfacial residues in halophiles is comparable to that of non-halophilic organisms.
The surface ACA in SALTIN and OSMOL halophilic

Conserved hydrophobic contact area

All 15 structures collected from halophilic organisms
have been structurally aligned with the non-halophilic
counterparts, and the structurally conserved regions
(SCR) were calculated. The conserved contacts
between hydrophobic residues (CHC) were identified
for each pair of structures, and were selected only
those formed by evolutionary conserved residues. Then
for each CHC, the apolar contact area formed by the
pair of residues was calculated. The number of CHCs
selected varies for each enzymatic family depending on
the relative degree of conservation of residues in that
family (Table 4).

In SALTIN sample the average ACA in CHCs is significantly smaller in halophilic enzymes than non-halophilic counterparts (Table 4). At variance, OSMOL
sample displays no significant difference. It has been
also tested whether the differences of the CHC areas in
the halophilic and non-halophilic counterparts correlated with sequence identity. No correlation was found
(see additional file 3).
Statistics on the preferred amino acid exchanges at the
SALTIN CHCs indicate that Ile ® Val is the most frequent replacement found in the direction mesophile ®
halophile with a Z-score equal to 4.34. At variance, the
most frequent exchange in the OSMOL CHCs is Leu ®
Ile with Z-score 3.74.

Discussion
Halophilic proteins have been extensively studied since a
long time [10] and very much is known about their distinguishing characteristics, although several aspects not
sufficiently elucidated of their molecular adaptation
mechanisms still remain. Indeed, most of the published
studies relied on comparative analyses of the characteristics of halophilic proteome and genomic sequences
that provided general overview of the molecular signature of haloadaptation [15] but may not unravel subtle
differences at the three-dimensional structural level.
Likewise, three-dimensional structural comparisons were
generally carried out within a single or a few protein
families which may not be sufficiently representative of
the halophilic proteome. Therefore, our work was aimed
at contributing to the understanding of the shared molecular mechanisms of protein haloadaptation through a
detailed and systematic comparison of a larger sample
of several three-dimensional structures of halophilic and

non-halophilic proteins now available in the databanks.
This approach highlights the adaptation strategies
shared by the extreme halophilic proteins, besides the
variations related to the peculiarities of each single
family. Indeed, the extent to which individual proteins
adapt to halophilic conditions varies, presumably due to
their diverse characteristics and roles within the cell.
For example, the malate dehydrogenase from Salinibacter ruber recently characterized [21] shares characteristics of a haloadapted archaeal enzyme and of nonhaloadapted enzymes from other eubacterial species.
Moreover, a proliferating cell nuclear antigen from
Haloferax volcanii [16] displayed an unexpectedly low
number of ion pairs at the monomer-monomer
interface.
Proteins were taken both from microorganisms
(mostly extreme halophilic Archaea) that utilize the
“salt-in” strategy to cope with the strong environmental
osmotic pressure, and from halophilic microorganisms
using the intracellular accumulation of osmolytes and
low cytoplasmatic salt concentration to counterbalance
the external osmotic pressure. Proteins synthesized by
the “salt-in” organisms are surrounded by a high-salt
concentration environment and are in contact with it.
At variance, intracellular proteins from the “osmolyte”
cells are surrounded by a high concentration solution of
compatible solutes which apparently do not interfere
significantly with protein solubility, stability and activity
[22]. Structural differences observed between the “saltin” and the mesophilic homologous proteins (this set
was referred to as SALTIN sample) were contrasted to
those observed between the “osmolyte” and mesophilic
pairs (here called OSMOL sample). The reasons for this
comparative approach is twofold: the OSMOL sample

Siglioccolo et al. BMC Structural Biology 2011, 11:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/11/50

was the reference sample against which to test the structural differences observed in the SALTIN sample; at the
same time we verified the presence of possible molecular adaptations in the OSMOL proteins due to their
immersion into the osmolyte solution. As a further filter
to eliminate possible noise due to non-normality distribution or paucity of data, two statistical tests (the parametric t-test and the non-parametric Wilcoxon test)
were used to assess the significance of observed differences of structural parameters. Only differences defined
significant according to both tests were deemed bona
fide significant signals.
Starting from the surface features of the halophilic
proteins, we demonstrated a significant reduction of
apolar surface in the SALTIN sample and a parallel
increase of the polar area formed by the side chain oxygen atoms, while the nitrogen side chain atoms lessen
their contribution to the surface. These results reflect
the well-known increase of surficial aspartate and glutamate residue frequency combined to the decrease of
lysine residues [15,23]. It should be mentioned indeed
that a reduction of hydrophobic exposed surface in the
glucose dehydrogenase from Haloferax mediterranei has
been demonstrated [24]. In this case however, reduction
of apolar surface was caused by reduction of lysine residues. Thus, overall, the 2-fold reduction in the proportion of lysine residues in the sequence leads to a 4-fold
reduction in the exposed hydrophobic accessible surface
area contributed by the associated alkyl component of
the lysine side chain.
We noticed that a significant decrease of apolar surface area in the protein synthesized by the halophilic
organism can be observed in the OSMOL sample as
well, paralleled by an ostensible tendency to increase the
presence of side chain oxygen atoms (Table 2). Most of
the compatible osmolytes produced by halophilic prokaryotes are neutral species, which contain charged
groups (for example amino acid derivatives); therefore, it
is not surprising that maintenance of solubility and stability of proteins at decimolar osmolyte concentration,
required surface remodeling partly similar to that
observed in the SALTIN sample, implying decrease of
apolar surface. Indeed, several physical-chemical models
have been proposed in the literature, according to which
the charged sites of the stabilizing osmolytes interact
with the oppositely charged polar areas of the macromolecule surface [25]. On the contrary, stabilizing osmolytes avoid contact with the polypeptide backbone. This
property is called “osmophobic effect” [26] and it forces
protein to fold in vivo, complementing the well known
hydrophobic effect. However, the overall extent of surface modification is much smaller than that observed in
the extreme halophilic proteins. Indeed, the examination
of the surface atomic potential variations in the SALTIN

Page 7 of 12

sample (Table 3) confirms that the electrostatic potential
is significantly more negative in halophilic proteins
rather in their mesophilic counterparts. Negative surface
electrostatic potential has been demonstrated to be a
characteristic factor of haloadaptation like, for example,
in nucleoside diphosphate kinase from Halobacterium
salinarum [27] or in an esterase from Haloarcula marismortui [19]. Thermal stability of the former protein
indeed resulted to be strongly dependent on salt concentration, as predicted by theoretical studies [18]. The
picture is different in the case of the OSMOL sample:
the increase of the surface formed by side-chain oxygen
atoms is not coupled to the decrease of nitrogen atoms:
this account for the lack of an apparent modification of
surficial potential. Recently, it has been demonstrated
[17] by extensive site-directed mutagenesis on three protein domains (the halophilic 1A domain of the NADdependent DNA ligase N from Haloferax volcanii, the
homologous domain from E.coli, and the mesophilic IgG
binding domain of the protein L from Streptococcus
magnus) that halophilicity of these proteins is directly
related to a decrease in the solvent accessible surface.
Authors stated that reduction of the solvent accessible
area introduced upon mutation causes a progressive
destabilization of the molecule, probably due to a reduction in the protein’s hydrophobic effect. As a consequence, mutations increasing salt induced stabilization
also destabilize the protein in the absence of salt, converting a mesophilic protein into an obligate halophilic
form, a trend found in natural halophilic proteins.
However, we did not observe any significant reduction
of the accessibility surface (data not shown) in the
SALTIN and OSMOL halophilic proteins whereas we
noticed the tendency, in the halophilic proteins of the
SALTIN samples, to reduce the apolar contact area of
the residues exposing more than 25% of their surface.
Therefore one could argue that the reduction of hydrophobic effect be a key component of the haloadaptation
mechanisms of surfaces.
However, surface property variations are not the only
feature relevant to protein stability and solubility in high
salt environments. Indeed, proper folding of the protein
in these conditions requires the formation of appropriate hydrophobic interactions in the interior of the
macromolecule. This is supposedly even more important
during the early step of protein folding of the nascent
polypeptide chain. In this perspective view, we analyzed
the variations of apolar contact area in the hydrophobic
core of the halophilic SALTIN and OSMOL surface
compared to their mesophilic counterparts. No statistically significant difference could be found. Nonetheless,
it should be noted that a consistent decrease of the apolar contact area in the halophilic proteins of the
SALTIN sample can be observed for core residues at 0%

Siglioccolo et al. BMC Structural Biology 2011, 11:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/11/50

relative accessibility (Table 4). We believe this is indicative of a trend, absent in the OSMOL sample, related to
haloadaptation of the SALTIN proteins. Similar trend
can be observed at the subunit interfaces of extreme
halophilic proteins.
Differences in apolar area buried upon folding
(ΔΔApAU-F) between each halophilic and non-halophilic
pairs display overall no significant difference. This may
suggest that, globally, the fraction of apolar area lost
during folding is similar in the two cases (halophilic/
non-halophilic) although the apolar surface available to
the halophilic protein is smaller. This observation is
reflected and supported by the significant reduction of
exposed apolar area (Table 2) and apolar contact area
(Table 4). It should be mentioned however that the difficult definition of unfolded state of a protein [28] should
recommend caution in the interpretation of these
results. Moreover, in this specific problem, electrostatic
repulsion of all the negative charges can render the calculation of the solvent accessible surface area of
unfolded state even more inaccurate.
It is well known that high NaCl concentration
strengthens hydrophobic interactions [29] and recently
the thermodynamics of this effect has been analyzed in
synthetic polymers [30]. Hydrophobicity is the main
driving force of protein folding [31]; it must be finely
balanced to confer proteins proper flexibility and stability compatible with their function. To maintain the
magnitude of hydrophobic interactions within useful
intervals in a high salt environment, extent of protein
interior hydrophobic surface should be reduced in order
to lessen the change in solvated hydrophobic areas.
Interestingly, it was demonstrated [30] that a potent
osmolyte, trimethylamine oxide, have a negligible effect
on the strength of hydrophobic interactions. This finding suggests that hydrophobic interactions in proteins of
“osmolyte” microorganisms need not to be significantly
altered.
This picture is even clearer when inspecting and contrasting the conserved hydrophobic contacts in the proteins belonging to the SALTIN and OSMOL sample.
The CHCs [18] are sites in the interior of the protein in
correspondence of which there is a hydrophobic contact
conserved during divergent evolution. Evolutionary conservation suggests that the contact be essential for folding and/or stability of the protein. The average apolar
contact area at the CHCs is significantly smaller in halophilic proteins than in their mesophilic counterparts. As
expected, OSMOL sample display no difference (Table
4). Accordingly, the most frequent residue exchange in
the SALTIN CHCs is the replacement of Ile with Val in
halophilic proteins which reduces the hydrophobic
volume buried in the core. Indeed, the effect of such
substitution is the loss of a methyl group in the

Page 8 of 12

hydrophobic nucleus of the protein. This is expected to
reduce the hydrophobic interactions, although conformational strain can also compound the influence on the
stability of the protein [32]. As expected, the most frequent residue substitution of the OSMOL CHCs,
namely Leu® Ile, does not imply any reduction in the
number of side-chain carbon atoms. As an example, Figure 3 reports two cases taken from the dataset utilized
in the work in which a CHC Ile was replaced by Val in
the halophilic protein.

Conclusions
The present analysis suggests that a shared haloadaptation strategy of proteins in the presence of molar salt
concentration, but not in the presence of osmolytes,
necessitates a weakening of the hydrophobic interactions
in general, and in particular at the level of core and conserved hydrophobic contacts. Weakening of these interactions counterbalances their strengthening by the
presence of salts in solution and may help the structure
preventing aggregation and/or loss of function in hypersaline environments. Indeed, decreasing hydrophobicity
makes halophilic proteins unstable in low-concentration
salt solutions and may in part explain the request of the
halophilic proteins for high salt concentrations. To complete the picture, the destabilization of halophilic proteins at low-salt concentration due to the strong
electrostatic repulsion should be considered [18,33].
Shrinking of hydrophobic contacts must be even more
critical for the early stages of folding when intramolecular hydrophobic nuclei must correctly form to guide the
polypeptide through the folding funnel to the native
state.
Considering also the significant increase of biotechnology applications of halophiles, the comprehension of the
multifaceted etiology of halophilicity (including the electrostatic factors) can provide the theoretical basis for
the engineering of proteins of great interest because
stable at concentrations of salts that cause the denaturation or aggregation of the majority of macromolecules.
Methods
Selection of protein structures

The crystallographic structures of the available high salt
concentration active enzymes were found in PDB [34].
The search was carried out using the keywords: “halophil”, haloarc”, “halobacter” and the like. For each of the
obtained structures, it was verified that the source
organism was present in a previously compiled list of
halophilic organisms, based on the website XBASE [35]
http://www.xbase.ac.uk/ and in the literature. The
selected organisms have optimal growth conditions that
support the presence of genuine adaptation to high salt
concentration environments. In fact, those organisms

respectively.

requiring for optimum growth concentration of NaCl <
0.5 M and/or temperatures < 20°C or > 55°C, were
excluded from the data sample. Moreover, the organisms were divided into two groups corresponding to different survival strategies: in the first group are the
archaeal halophiles using the “salt-in” strategy (which
will be referred to as SALTIN sample); in the latter the
Eubacteria using the “osmolytes” strategy (OSMOL
sample) [36].
To select only halophilic structures matching specific
criteria and to eliminate redundancy, we used the
PISCES server http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/PISCES.php[37],
which enables the creation of a list of structures that
meet arbitrary thresholds, starting from an initial userdefined larger sample. The parameters used were: maximum percentage identity 90%, maximum resolution 2.5
Å, maximum R-value 0.3, minimum chain length 50
residues, and utmost chain length 1000 residues. Homologous structures from non-halophilic organisms were
retrieved from PDB by means of the program PSIBLAST [38]. To ensure structural homology, only
sequences sharing ≥ 30% and ≤ 90% residue identity to
the halophilic counterpart were considered. In cases
where more counterparts were available for each halophilic protein, only the homolog with the highest percentage identity to the protein of interest was
considered to minimize possible phylogenetic drift

effects on the statistics. At the end of the procedure, 15
pairs of halophilic and non-halophilic proteins were collected, 8 of which corresponded to organisms that adopt
the “salt-in” strategy and constitute the SALTIN sample,
and 7 that adopt the “osmolytes” strategy and compose
the OSMOL sample. In cases where the protein structures are used in their biological unit form, the pairs are
reduced to 11 because in 4 cases there is no correspondence between the quaternary structure of homologous
halophilic and non-halophilic proteins. Although Table
1 shows that the two proteins of the pair 1CNO-1ETP
have a different quaternary structure, this pair was
included in the analysis. In fact, since 1ETP is a fusion
protein of two polypeptide chains each equivalent to the
monomer of 1CNO, the two quaternary forms are overall similar.
Apolar contact area (ACA)

The apolar contact area is the area of contact between
coupled non-polar atoms in a protein. It was calculated
for different structural environments: nucleus, interface
between monomers and protein surface. The program
utilized was Pdb_np_cont [39], which calculates the area
of contact between coupled non-polar atoms starting
from a standard PDB file. Briefly, this method is based
on the classification of points located on a sphere of
interaction radius, surrounding each non-polar atom.

Siglioccolo et al. BMC Structural Biology 2011, 11:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/11/50

The interaction radius is the van der Waals radius of
each atom type, plus the radius of a water molecule.
The output of this program was utilized to calculate the
pairwise residue contact areas for every possible pair of
residues belonging to the structures analysed.
Individual protein chains were used for analysis of the
protein core, while analyses of the protein subunit interfaces were carried out with structures in their quaternary assembly. Only the 9 pairs of proteins possessing an
oligomeric biological unit were used in this case. Protein
interfaces consists of those residues making apolar contacts to another protein chain, as defined by
Pdb_np_cont [38].
A residue was assigned to the structural environment
“nucleus” if its relative solvent accessibility, calculated
with the program NACCESS [40], is less than four different alternative thresholds (0%, 3%, 5% and 9%). A
residue is instead assigned to the protein surface if its
relative solvent accessibility is greater than an arbitrarily
fixed threshold. To this end, four different alternative
thresholds (25%, 40%, 55% and 70%) were used.
For each structural environment considered the perresidue mean apolar contact area was calculated by
dividing the total apolar contact area by the number of
residues belonging to that structural environment.
Conserved hydrophobic contacts (CHCs) were identified in each pair of homologous enzymes through the
combined use of the web tools CE-MC [41] for calculating the structural alignment, SCR_FIND for identification of structurally conserved regions and CHC_FIND
for the detection of the CHCs and their apolar contact
area [42]. SCRs were defined as regions displaying a
similar local conformation, with a mean positional
RMSD of the equivalent a-carbon positions of the structures superposed ≤ 3.0 Å, lacking indels and composed
of at least three consecutive residues. A CHC is defined
as a conserved hydrophobic contact formed between
two residues belonging to an SCR, in members belonging to a family or superfamily of proteins [42]. We considered only those contacts that are formed between
residues distant at least three positions along the
sequence and residues that are evolutionarily conserved
according to the server CONSURF [43], i.e. belonging to
the classes 7, 8 and 9. These three classes contain the
most conserved amino acid positions from a total of
nine equally sized categories of relative degree of
conservation.

Page 10 of 12

belonging to a non-halophilic protein and involved in
making CHCs, aa X®Y was defined as the number of
times X is substituted by the residue Y of the halophilic
protein. Likewise, aaY®X is defined. Therefore, a substitution matrix can be obtained by computing the difference between aaX®Y and aaY®X over the whole dataset
of protein pairs k, according to:
CS =

(

aaX→Y −

aaY→X )

(1)

k

where CS is the element of the substitution matrix.
The mean and standard deviation of the overall
exchange matrix were determined; the significance RXY
of the exchange X®Y was then calculated by dividing
the difference between CS, and the overall matrix mean
¯
C by the standard deviation s:
RXY =

¯
CS − C
σ

(2)

RXY values ≥ 3.0 standard deviations (corresponding to
a probability P ≤ 0.01 that the observed difference was
obtained by chance) from the mean value were considered statistically significant [18].
Accessible surface area (ASA) analysis

The ASA is the area of the protein surface which can
be in contact with the solvent. The total apolar (and
the complementary polar) component of the entire
accessible surface area of each protein in its quaternary
form was calculated with the server GETAREA http://
curie.utmb.edu/getarea.html with default settings [44].
The contribution of different atomic types to the polar
area, namely oxygens, side-chain oxygens, nitrogens
and side-chain nitrogens was also investigated. To
compare the different surface areas of halophilic and
non-halophilic proteins, they were normalized by division by the total accessible surface area of the corresponding protein.
The differences between the fraction of apolar accessible surface area in the unfolded and folded form of each
protein considered (ΔApAU-F) were calculated through
the web server http://roselab.jhu.edu/utils/unfolded.html
[28]. The differences between the ΔApA U-F in each
halophilic protein and in its corresponding homolog
(ΔΔApAU-F) were calculated and statistically tested.
Electrostatic potential calculation

Preferred amino acid substitution in CHCs

Amino acid substitutions of residues involved in the formation of structurally and evolutionarily conserved
hydrophobic contacts between halophilic and non-halophilic proteins were determined by analysing the alignment of the SCRs of each pair. For each residue X,

The surface electrostatic potential of the proteins in
their quaternary form was calculated using the program
DELPHI [45]. Salt concentration was set equal to 0,
since identical environmental conditions can better
delineate differences between the electrostatic potential
of the halophilic and non-halophilic homolog. Internal

Siglioccolo et al. BMC Structural Biology 2011, 11:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/11/50

and solvent dielectric constants were set to 4.0 [46] and
80.0 respectively. The other parameters used were set to
the default values: grid scale = 1.2, box fill = 60%, probe
radius = 1.4 Å, and van der Waals surface. To compare
the potential of halophilic and non-halophilic proteins
of different lengths, the average atomic potential (AAP)
was calculated dividing the total electrostatic potential
by the total number of atoms.
Statistical tests

Whenever possible, differences between the structural
properties considered were calculated within the two
samples: the SALTIN halophilic and non-halophilic
homologs, and the OSMOL halophilic and non-halophilic pairs. Differences of structural properties are denoted
by Δ: for example, ΔACA indicates halophilic minus
non-halophilic apolar contact areas.
The Δs between the structural properties of halophilic
enzymes and their corresponding non-halophilic counterparts were tested within samples using two statistical
tests, a paired t-test and a non-parametric Wilcoxon
signed-rank test [47]. In the former case the null
hypothesis is that the average Δ was 0 at 0.05 p-value
while in the latter case the null hypothesis is that the
median of the Δs was 0 at 0.05 p-value. The parametric
t-test assumes that the tested data come from a normal
distribution, while the Wilcoxon test it is less restrictive
since it does not require such a condition. To enhance
robustness of the conclusions drawn from the structural
comparisons, only differences resulting significant from
both tests were deemed bona fide significant results.
