Abstract
Background: Weedy rice (red rice), a conspecific weed of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), is a significant problem
throughout the world and an emerging threat in regions where it was previously absent. Despite belonging to the
same species complex as domesticated rice and its wild relatives, the evolutionary origins of weedy rice remain unclear.
We use genome-wide patterns of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation in a broad geographic sample of
weedy, domesticated, and wild Oryza samples to infer the origin and demographic processes influencing U.S. weedy
rice evolution.
Results: We find greater population structure than has been previously reported for U.S. weedy rice, and that the
multiple, genetically divergent populations have separate origins. The two main U.S. weedy rice populations share
genetic backgrounds with cultivated O. sativa varietal groups not grown commercially in the U.S., suggesting weed
origins from domesticated ancestors. Hybridization between weedy groups and between weedy rice and local crops
has also led to the evolution of distinct U.S. weedy rice populations. Demographic simulations indicate differences
among the main weedy groups in the impact of bottlenecks on their establishment in the U.S., and in the timing of
divergence from their cultivated relatives.
Conclusions: Unlike prior research, we did not find unambiguous evidence for U.S. weedy rice originating via
hybridization between cultivated and wild Oryza species. Our results demonstrate the potential for weedy life-histories
to evolve directly from within domesticated lineages. The diverse origins of U.S. weedy rice populations demonstrate
the multiplicity of evolutionary forces that can influence the emergence of weeds from a single species complex.
Background
Among the most widespread and costly agricultural pests
are the numerous weeds that have evolved from within
the same complex of interfertile species as domesticated
plants [1-3]. The recent and rapid evolution of these conspecific weeds also presents unique opportunities to
study processes influencing adaptive population divergence and parallel evolution of weedy life-histories. Conspecific weeds are morphologically and ecologically
divergent from domesticated and wild congener species,
and are not simply transient "volunteers" of the previous
season's crop [4,5]. The evolutionary success of conspecific weeds is often attributed to acquisition of traits associated with wild plants (e.g. dormancy), presumably
selected against in crops. Conversely, these weeds also
often exhibit characteristics typical of domesticated

plants, (e.g. more selfing, rapid growth), which could promote invasiveness in the agroecosystem. There is great
interest in understanding the evolutionary mechanisms
that can lead to the emergence of weedy species from the
same species complexes that give rise to domesticated
plants.
The larger complex of interfertile species within which
conspecific weeds evolve includes the crop, wild relatives,
and other feral weeds [6]. Studies have shown that, in
many cases, hybridization between crops and wild species can facilitate weed evolution [reviewed in [7,8]].
Alternatively, conspecific weeds may evolve from standing genetic variation in wild relatives [7], or cultivated
germplasm [e.g. [9]], though examples of weeds evolving
directly from crops are rare. The short evolutionary time
scales involved make it less likely that novel mutations are
significant to weed evolution, however exceptions are
known [e.g. [10]].

Here we investigate the evolutionary origins of weedy
rice in the United States, which has been a subject of considerable debate for more than 150 years [11-16]. Weedy
or red rice (due to the frequent presence of a red pericarp), is found in cultivated rice fields worldwide, but is
most damaging in direct seeded (seeding directly into a
dry soil bed), highly mechanized agricultural systems typical of the U.S., Europe and Australia [17]. Although currently classified as the same species as Asian cultivated
rice, Oryza sativa L., weedy rice has morphological characteristics typical of wild species (e.g. dormancy, shattering) and of cultivated rice (e.g. high fecundity, high selfing
rate). The long term persistence of weedy rice throughout
the range of cultivated rice, suggests that it can adapt to
local changes in agronomic practices as well as different
biotic and abiotic conditions [18,19].
No Oryza is native to the U.S.; therefore, U.S. weedy
rice must have evolved elsewhere and/or endogenously
from introduced cultivated and/or wild germplasm. The
Oryza crop-wild complex, within which weedy rice
evolved, is composed of two domesticated and six wild
species that share the AA genome [20,21]. Evidence for
gene flow among members of this complex is extensive
[16,22-26], suggesting that any of these taxa could have
contributed to the origins of weedy rice in the U.S. The
earliest available reference to weedy rice in the U.S. dates
from 1846 [11], and describes a well-established and
troublesome pest. Considerable phenotypic diversity is
found within U.S. weedy rice populations [see references
in [17]]. Currently, two main morphological groups
include awnless straw-hulled types, which more closely
resemble cultivated rice varieties, and awned blackhulled forms, with other morphologies found less frequently (Figure 1). Several SSR and RAPD studies have
suggested that strawhull, awnless weedy rice is most
closely related to indica, O. sativa varieties typical of lowland tropical regions, and probably a product of hybridization with O. rufipogon/O. nivara, the wild ancestor of
domesticated Asian rice [13-15,27]. A recent microsatellite study suggests that some black hull, awned weedy rice
may be derived from O. sativa aus varieties [13], a group
most commonly grown in Bangladesh and Northeastern
India, or from O. rufipogon [14]. To date, however, patterns of DNA sequence diversity have not been explored
in U.S. weedy rice, and open questions remain about the
likelihood of weed origins from cultivated ancestors, and
the roles of demographic history and hybridization in the
evolution of weedy rice.
Taking advantage of the existing genomic resources for
domesticated rice [28,29], we use genome-wide patterns
of DNA sequence variation in a broad sample of the
Oryza crop-wild complex, to infer the origin and demographic history of U.S. weedy rice. Specifically we attempt
to address remaining uncertainties regarding 1) the

ancestral Oryza group(s), including other wild species,
that gave rise to U.S. weedy rice, 2) the timing of divergence between U.S. weedy rice and its progenitor(s), and,
3) the role of hybridization in the establishment of U.S.
weedy rice populations. We find considerable population
structure in U.S. weedy rice, with genetically divergent
populations having separate origins. Exotic cultivated O.
sativa varieties are the main contributors to weedy rice
genomes, and there is little evidence of contribution from
wild Oryza. Hybridization among weedy groups has also
influenced the emergence of novel weed phenotypes.
Assessments of demographic parameters suggest differences among divergent weedy groups in the effect of pop-

ulation bottlenecks upon U.S. colonization, and in the
timing of their origins. Our results demonstrate how similar weedy life histories can evolve from divergent genetic
backgrounds.

Methods
Plant material
Weedy rice

Weedy rice seed was obtained from collections made
over a period of 30 years in the Southern rice belt (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas) and
maintained by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) at the Dale Bumpers Rice Research Institute,
Stuttgart Arkansas (Additional file 1). We selected a subset of 58 accessions that maximized geographical diversity, but were otherwise chosen at random. We also
included a few samples representative of rare morphologies (i.e. brown hulls), to increase the probability of capturing all existing population structure. Accessions listed
in Additional file 1 as single seed descent are derived
from seeds collected at rice mills and have been selfed at
the USDA for four generations (D. Gealy personal communication). The remaining accessions were collected
directly from weedy plants occurring in cultivated rice
fields by the USDA.
Putative parental populations

For our analyses, we used data from 206 Oryza accessions, 95 of which were included in [30], and 111 which
were chosen specifically for this study. Our sample
broadly surveys AA genome Oryza species for potential
parental sources of U.S. weedy rice (Additional file 2). We
included Asian landraces and modern accessions from
the five main variety groups of O. sativa; this includes 22
indica, 7 aus, 18 tropical japonica (varieties grown in
tropical and subtropical regions), 22 temperate japonica
(varieties typical of northern latitudes), and 6 aromatic
(fragrant rice varieties). A plurality of evidence supports
the independent domestication of the indica and aus
groups from the japonica and aromatic groups beginning
~ 10,000 ybp from divergent populations of O. rufipogon
[see [31]] (for alternate views see [32,33]). An additional
12 tropical japonica cultivars were added that are representative of important U.S. founding lineages (i.e. Carolina Gold, Blue Rose; [34]) or have been extensively
grown in the southern U.S. We included 50 O. rufipogon
and 3 O. nivara (a species often considered an annual
form of O. rufipogon [35]) accessions, sampled across
their geographic range. More samples from India and
China were included as these regions are the possible
centers of origin for domesticated rice [20,36]. Four
accessions of African domesticated rice (O. glaberrima)
and three of its wild progenitor (O. barthii) were
included, as historical evidence suggests their introduction by early crop breeders and Africans brought to the

Page 3 of 16

U.S. as slaves [37]. Similarly, two accessions of O. glumaepatula were included, as it occurs in the Caribbean and
Central America, and may have contributed to the evolution of weedy rice. O. meridionalis, native to Australia
and Oceania, was included as an outgroup, as phylogenetic evidence indicates that it is ancestral to other AA
genome Oryza [38].
DNA extraction and sequencing

DNA was extracted from approximately 1 g of fresh leaf
material from one plant per accession using a modified
CTAB protocol [39,40]. DNA concentrations were gel
quantified and diluted to 2 ng/ul for sequencing. We
amplified and sequenced a total of 48, ~ 400-600 bp, gene
fragments, selected from a set of 111 randomly chosen
sequenced tagged loci (STS) developed by [30]. The 48
fragments were chosen to include ~4 loci per chromosome distributed on both chromosome arms (Additional
file 3), without referencing diversity data or estimates of
informativeness [41].
DNA sequencing was carried out in Cogenics sequencing facilities (Houston, TX) as described in [30,42]. Base
pair calls, quality score assignment and construction of
contigs were carried out as described in [30]. Newly constructed contigs were added to existing alignments [30],
and all subsequent analyses were based on the merged
alignments. Further sequence alignment and editing were
carried out with BioLign Version 2.09.1 (Tom Hall, NC
State Univ.) as described in [30]. New DNA sequences
obtained for this study were deposited in GenBank under
accession numbers GQ999668-GQ999777.
The cytoplasm genomes of O. sativa cultivars from
independent domestication events have been used to distinguish cultivar groups [15,43,44]. We assessed the origins of cytoplasm genomes in weedy rice using one
chloroplast [Orf100, [44]], and two mitochondrial
[SSV500 and SSV39, [45]] markers in all 58 weedy rice
accessions, and 82 Oryza samples from our panel and
those from [30] for which DNA was available. These
PCR-based markers amplify regions in the chloroplast or
mitochondria containing large indels (69 bp to 500 bp),
which can be visualized on a 1% agarose gel. Reaction
conditions were as in [44] and [45]. We assumed maternal
inheritance for cytoplasmic genomes, and combined the
three markers into a single cytotype for analysis.
Population structure

We assessed population structure using the Bayesian
clustering program InStruct [46], which is similar to the
commonly used STRUCTURE [47], but was developed
specifically for identifying population structure in
inbreeding species. Cultivated and weedy Oryza tend to
self-fertilize, while wild Oryza outcross more frequently
(10 to 60%) [20,26]. InStruct does not assume Hardy

Reagon et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:180

Weinberg equilibrium within populations, which can
result in over-splitting in populations with a history of
inbreeding [46,48]. We created genotype data from
phased haplotypes inferred for each STS fragment using
PHASE 2.1 [49].
We inferred population structure using two data sets:
one included only U.S. weedy rice accessions (N = 58) and
the second contained all individuals used in this study (N
= 209). To determine the number of populations (K) that
best approximates population structure, we tested a
range of purposefully extreme K: K = 2 to 20 for the complete data set, and K = 2 to 15 for the weedy rice dataset.
For each value of K, five replicates were carried out with
an initial burn-in of 100,000 followed by 500,000 iterations using the "infer population structure and the individual selfing rates" option for final simulations. Sizes of
burn-in and simulation number were found sufficient
based on the Gelman-Rubin estimate of chain convergence for preliminary trial runs of various lengths (data
not shown). All InStruct analyses were run on a computer
cluster freely available at the Computational Biology Service Unit of Cornell University http://cbsuapps.tc.cornell.edu/InStruct.aspx. We used the Deviance
Information Criterion (DIC) scores provided in the
InStruct output to determine the number of populations
that best fit our data. The K with the lowest average DIC
score of the five replicates was considered to best
describe population structure. For the model with the
lowest mean DIC score, we checked for consistency in
estimates of membership coefficients and split locations
by estimating the correlation between ancestry membership matrices of replicate model runs with the R package
simco [50]. InStruct results were plotted using R v2.6.2
[51].
Summary statistics

Summary statistics for each STS locus and population of
interest, including nucleotide diversity (Î¸W and Î¸Ï),
Tajima's D, polymorphic loci (P), number of segregating
sites (S), and population unique alleles/haplotypes were
calculated as described in [30]. Site type determination
was based on annotations of the O. sativa genome (TIGR
v. 5 January, 2008).
Levels of population differentiation were estimated
using Fst, calculated after [52], using modifications of
[53], which drops singleton SNPs. We calculated Fst for
each STS fragment by taking the mean Fst of all SNPs per
fragment, and then calculated the grand mean over all
STS fragments, counting non-polymorphic fragments as
zeros. Negative values of SNP Fst were changed to zero
before taking means of individual SNPs per STS fragment
[53].

Demographic models of weedy rice evolution

To infer the demographic history most consistent with
the observed patterns of polymorphism in U.S. weedy
rice, we used a full likelihood method, IMa (Isolation with
Migration analytic; [54,55]), and an approximate Bayesian
computation (ABC) method that relies on summary statistics [56].
A description of the demographic model and assumptions of the IMa analyses are provided in Additional File 4
and below we discuss details specific to our implementation. Three population pairs were considered, and each
IMa analysis used only STS polymorphic within each
population pair, as preliminary runs including invariant
loci would not converge in a reasonable time. All pairs
contained a similar number of polymorphic loci (27-32);
thus exclusion of invariant loci does not preferentially
affect parameter estimates in any group. We used a neutral mutation rate of 1 Ã 10-8 [57], derived from synonymous site divergence at the maize Adh loci [58] to convert
ML estimates to years and number of individuals. Both
cultivated and weedy rice are, on average, annual plants
under field conditions due to harvesting and cultivation
practices [17], and we assumed a generation time of one
year. Note that excluding monomorphic STS effectively
increases the baseline mutation rate by ~1.6 (48/30), but
this value is within error ranges of mutation range estimates, and does not affect scaling of parameters across
groups. For all runs, we assumed that migration between
populations was symmetrical, and set the maximum prior
for population sizes to be equal. For final runs, we used a
burn-in of 5,000,000 and recorded simulations for an
additional 5,000,000 iterations using 10 chains and a twostep geometric heating scheme. To check for convergence, we ran each parameter set three times with a different starting random seed. IMa command lines were:
ima -b 5000000 -l 50000 -m1 25 -m2 25 -f g -n 10 -g1 0.7 g2 0.8 -p345 -q1 5 -k 3 -t 5 -s12307.
The demographic model used in ABC analyses is
shown in Figure 2, and is similar to models used to assess
population divergence and crop domestication [e.g.
[35,54,59,60]]. We used this model to test which scenario
is most consistent with the demographic history of U.S.
weedy rice: i) prior to introduction to the U.S., from a
domesticated progenitor in Asia (~12,000 years before
present [ybp]); ii) de novo, from cultivated germplasm
introduced to the U.S.; and/or iii) from wild populations
prior to domestication (Figure 2, Additional file 4) All
simulations were performed using MS [61], and were
conditioned on the population mutation rate Î¸ = 4NÎ¼,
where 4N is the reference population size and Î¼ is the per
nucleotide per generation mutation rate (Î¼ = 1 Ã 10-8, as
above). We used the observed mean silent site Î¸w for O.
rufipogon from [30] to estimate Î¸ = 4NÎ¼, as the allele fre-

Figure 2 Demographic model for ABC analysis. This model assumes that the initial weedy rice founder (effective population size Î·p),
split from an Oryza group (effective population size Î·c) in Asia at time
Ïs generations in the past. At time Ïf, lineages from the founder population, Î·p, were introduced to the U.S. and experienced a bottleneck of
size Î·b before recovering to current population size Î·r, instantaneously
at time Ïg.

quency spectrum of O. rufipogon is consistent with a population evolving at a constant size. The population
recombination rate, Ï, was assumed to be identical to Î¸,
similar to other recent studies [30,62]. We considered
weedy rice to be effectively entirely selfing and scaled
timing parameters using 2N, rather than 4N.
We assumed that the population size of the progenitor
of weedy rice has remained constant and set Î·c equal to Î·p
for the duration of an individual simulation. Priors for Î·c
were based on the ratio Î·c/4N and ranged from 0.1 to 0.7.
These limits were based on the observed ratio of silent
site Î¸w, crop/Î¸w,O. rufipogon. Priors for the current and bottleneck population size of the weed were based on the ratios
Î·r/Î·c, and Î·b/Î·r, and ranged from 0 - 1 and 0-Î·r respectively. Priors for time of population expansion (Ïg), founding in the U.S. (Ïf), and time of divergence (Ïs) were based
on the known history of cultivated rice in the U.S. and
timing of domestication. The upper limit for Ïg was chosen to coincide with the rapid expansion of cultivated
rice, which began around 1870 in the southern rice belt.
Similarly, Ïf was assumed to have occurred after culti-

vated rice was introduced into the U.S. and was constrained to be less than 400 years ago. Priors for Ïs ranged
from Ïf to 50,000 ybp, and were chosen to be consistent
with divergence occurring prior to domestication (Ïs =
12,000-50,000), post domestication in Asia (Ïs â¤ 12,000),
and at the time of founding in the U.S. (Ïs = Ïf). A grid of
prior values for the three timing parameters and Î·c was
generated, and the MS command line and further details
on parameter ranges are given in Additional file 4.
Summary statistics and observed data were calculated
using data pooled from all 48 STS fragments [after 30].
We chose summary statistics shown to be sensitive (correlated) to changes in population growth and timing of
divergence [63]. These statistics also illustrate a key pattern observed in the data: that weedy rice groups contained a subset of genetic diversity present in putative
ancestral populations (see results). We used eight statistics: Î¸Ï for both populations combined, the number of
segregating, fixed, and private sites in weedy populations
and their putative cultivated progenitors, and the number
of shared sites between weeds and their putative progenitors. A similar set of summary statistics were used to
infer demographic history in Zea [64].
We employed a similar rejection approach as in [35,65]
and used the proportion of accepted simulations to calculate the approximate likelihood for a given demographic
scenario. For each of the scenarios described above, we
performed ~850,000 simulations. All processing and
analysis of MS output were performed using R.

Results
Marker data

The 48 sequenced STS ranged in aligned length from 400
to 921 base pairs (bp) over all accessions, for a total of
~24,145 bp aligned sequence per accession. We observed
827 SNPs in our entire dataset. Thirty-three SNPs had
more than two alleles, primarily (73%) due to alternative
states present in the outgroup species (O. barthii or O.
meridionalis). These SNPs were excluded from analyses
when occurring in targeted groups. Insertions and deletions (indels) were not used in haplotype determination
or calculation of summary statistics (unless segregating
sites occurred within an indel, which was rare). Heterozygotes were observed almost exclusively in O. rufipogon,
and only two weedy rice and four cultivated O. sativa
accessions had heterozygous sites.
Except for one weedy rice accession, the three-cytoplasm markers amplified in all individuals screened (n =
139). We observed the same sized length variants (i.e. the
size of deletion in base pairs) for each marker that were
found in [47,48] (Table 1). In general, we found that the
cytotypes had similar distributions within cultivated O.

U.S. weedy rice population structure

To determine the number of weedy rice populations
occurring within the U.S., we used InStruct and a data set
containing only weed accessions (Additional file 1; n =
58). Based on DIC scores (Additional file 5), we found
that population structure is most consistent with a model
containing six groups (K = 6) (Figure 3A). Individuals
belonging to the same cluster tend to have similar grain
morphologies. At K = 2, individuals with straw hulls that
lack awns (SH = straw hull) are differentiated from other
hull phenotypes. With increasing K, SH individuals
remained in a single cluster, while the non-SH group was
further subdivided into five subpopulations (Figure 3A).
Based on the predominant grain phenotype (i.e. hull
color and presence or absence of an awn) in each population, we designated these as: BHA1 (black hull awned 1),
BHA2 (black hull awned 2), BRH (brown hull awned),
MXSH (mixed straw hull), and MXBH (mixed black hull
awned). With one exception, all 24 weedy rice individuals
with straw-colored hulls and no awns in our panel clustered in the SH population. All other clusters, however,
contained multiple grain phenotypes (Additional file 1).
For example, ~73% of individuals in BHA1 and ~63% of
BHA2 had awns and a black hull, and ~60% of BRH individuals had brown hulls and awns. Similar results were
obtained when analyses were run with STRUCTURE
(data not shown).

Oryza population structure

To identify potential source(s) for U.S. weedy rice within
Oryza, we used InStruct and a dataset that included all
accessions in our panel (n = 209). The best fitting model
contained nine populations (K = 9) (Figure 3B, Additional
files 2 and 5). Cluster membership was generally consistent with previous research [30,66]. InStruct identified O.
sativa varieties aus, indica, tropical japonica and temperate japonica as distinct populations; however, our dataset
lacked resolution to differentiate tropical japonica and
aromatic accessions. The fourteen U.S. cultivars included
in this study clustered with tropical japonica, as expected,
and historic and modern cultivars were not differentiated.
Approximately four clusters were observed within the
wild ancestor of cultivated rice, O. rufipogon although
most individuals appeared to be admixtures (Figure 3B).
Many O. rufipogon individuals shared some ancestry with
indica, but only five had membership coefficients greater
than 50%. None of these were indicated as hybrids in the
passport data available, and admixture may be due to
shared ancestry, rather than recent hybridization. Consistent with previous research [20,67,68] no distinct O.
nivara cluster separate from O. rufipogon was observed.
African cultivated rice, O. glaberrima, and its progenitor,
O. barthii, formed a distinct cluster, as did the two O.
meridionalis samples. O. glumaepatula samples, on the
other hand, clustered with three O. rufipogon and one O.
nivara (Figure 3B, Additional file 2).
Origins of U.S. weedy rice populations

bined with the genotyping results for the three-cytoplasm
markers. All of the SH individuals identified by InStruct
(Figure 3A) cluster with indica when all samples are used
(Figure 3B). All SH accessions had the same cytotype,
which was also the most frequent in indica (60%) and O.
rufipogon (53%) (Table 1), and was found in all of the O.
rufipogon and O. nivara accessions that shared greater
than 50% membership with indica (Additional file 2).
Both black hulled weedy rice groups, BHA1 and BHA2,
cluster primarily with aus and are not differentiated in
the InStruct analysis that included all individuals (Figure
3B). Interestingly, the most frequent BHA1 (60%) and
BHA2 (71%) cytotype did not occur in our aus sample,
but is most common in tropical japonica (63%), and rare
in indica (20%) and O. rufipogon (7%) (Table 1). However,
two other cytotypes found in BHA1 and BHA2 were also
found at high frequency in aus. Two BHA1 individuals
and an O. rufipogon accession from India shared a cytotype that was absent in all other accessions (Additional
file 2).
The InStruct analyses suggest that the BRH population
is either the result of hybridization between indica and
aus, the SH and BHA weedy groups, indica and BHA, or
aus and SH (Figure 3A and 3B). The BRH group contained a subset of the diversity found in the SH and BHA
groups (10 of the most frequent STS haplotypes [MFH] in
BRH were exclusive to BHA1 and BHA2, and six to SH;
the remaining 32 were common to all weedy populations)
consistent with hybridization among weedy groups in the
U.S. All BRH individuals have the same cytotype as SH
weeds, suggesting a maternal SH lineage. No heterozygotes were observed, which would be expected from early
generation hybrids; however, heterozygosity may have
been affected by selfing at the USDA stock center.
InStruct results also indicate that hybridization
between tropical japonica varieties grown in the U.S. and
weedy rice has occurred. Population MXSH contains two
individuals that share genetic membership with both
indica/SH and tropical japonica (Figure 3B). The MXSH
population is also notable in that weedy rice is likely the
paternal rather than maternal parent, as observed cytotypes are absent from SH weeds, but occur in tropical
japonica (Additional files 1 and 2, Table 1). Individuals in
the MXBH group were identified as admixtures between
aus/BHA and tropical japonica (Figure 3B). Both accessions in MXBH have the same cytotype (Additional file
1), which is absent in aus, but found in BHA groups and
tropical japonica. Outside of the MXSH and MXBH populations, only one accession shared membership with
tropical japonica (Figure 3B).
Three of the five putative hybrids we identified were
listed as suspected crosses based on morphological
observations made at the time of collection (Additional
file 1). Three modern U.S. cultivars (M202, Bengal, and

Page 8 of 16

Palmyra) appear as admixtures of temperate and tropical
japonica in our analyses, in agreement with known pedigree data. This suggests our data is sufficient for identifying relatively advanced generation hybrids and supports
our designation of weedy hybrids.
Genetic diversity in weedy rice

Genetic diversity statistics were calculated for all 48 STS
for U.S. weedy rice groups and potential sources within
Oryza (Table 2, Additional file 3). For all measures of
genetic diversity, weedy rice, considered as a single group,
was genetically depauperate, with less than ~40% and
~70% of the diversity present in O. sativa and O. rufipogon respectively. Mean Î¸W and Î¸Ï are highest in O. rufipogon, intermediate for O. sativa groups and lowest in
U.S. weedy rice. We also found that the distribution of
nucleotide diversity is heterogeneous across loci for all
groups, but particularly in weedy and cultivated groups
where a few loci are atypically polymorphic (Figure 4,
Additional file 3).
In general, U.S. weedy rice groups contain a subset of
diversity observed in their most closely related cultivated
O. sativa populations. SH weedy rice contains only ~30%
of the silent site variation found in indica, while the
BHA1 and BHA2 groups harbor between 50-67% of the
variation found in aus. For a majority of the STS fragments, weedy rice groups and putative progenitor shared
the same MFH (83% of STS fragments in indica and 73%
of STS fragments in aus). We did not observe high frequency or specific haplotypes that would suggest weedy
rice is a product of recent hybridization with O. rufipogon.
We estimated differentiation between U.S. weedy rice
populations and their closely related Oryza groups using
mean and median values of STS Fst (Table 3). SH and
BHA1 were more diverged than indica from aus, and the
most highly differentiated population pair tested (Table
3). Populations BHA1 and BHA2 were not greatly differentiated but both were more diverged from aus than SH
from indica, consistent with a higher number of private
SNPs and presence of one fixed SNP in BHA/aus comparisons (Additional file 6). Low median Fst values
between weedy populations and their closest Oryza relatives show that estimates of population differentiation are
driven by a few loci (Additional file 6).
Estimates of demographic parameters

We used IMa and ABC to infer time of divergence and
population sizes for the two main weedy rice groups (SH
and BHA1) and their closest Oryza relatives. The results
of a single simulation for demographic parameters from
IMa analyses are shown in Table 4 and Additional file 7,
and posterior probability density curves for parameter
estimates are shown in Additional file 8. For all popula-

tion pair comparisons, differences in parameter estimates
among the three simulation runs were small (less than
5%) and the 90% posterior density intervals (HPD) overlapped, suggesting chain convergence. The maximum
likelihood (ML) estimates of current and ancestral effective population size (Ne) were consistent with expectations that U.S. weedy rice populations have experienced
population bottlenecks (Table 4, Additional file 7). ML
estimates of Ne for BHA1 (~2,472 individuals) and SH
(~1,000 individuals) are an order of magnitude smaller
than for their ancestral populations (77,148 and 74,397
respectively). ML estimates of current weedy rice Ne were
also smaller than estimates of current Ne for their relatives. Ne estimates for aus and indica across simulations

were similar, with HPD intervals covering similar ranges
in population size (Table 4, Additional file 7). The larger
estimates for indica are consistent with the limited geographical distribution of aus. To account for high rate of
selfing in cultivated rice, our analysis is based on a single
haplotype (i.e. chromosome) per individual, and, therefore, depending on the actual degree of selfing (exact values are unknown), population size estimates may be, at
most, twice as large [69].
IMa-based estimate of divergence time between aus
and indica was ~6,047 ybp, (Table 4, Additional file 6),
with a wide HPD interval (605 to 241,880 ybp). Divergence time estimates for SH from indica (~31,995 ybp)
and BHA1 from aus (~9,939 ybp) predate the introduction of cultivated rice to the U.S. (~1690's), and its establishment in the southern rice belt (>150 years). However,
confidence HPD intervals for all estimates are very large
and overlap (Table 4, Additional file 7).
Obtaining estimates of migration between populations
from our IMa runs was problematic. Initial runs of models that did not include migration, under the assumption
that gene flow between weeds in the U.S. and cultivars in
Asia is unlikely, did not converge. Including migration
improved estimates for remaining parameters. However,
for all population pairs, estimates of migration are not
reliable, as posterior distributions did not converge
within prior ranges (Additional file 8), suggesting that,
under short evolutionary time scales, with this dataset,
IMa may confound recent divergence with ongoing gene
flow.
To further explore the demographic history of U.S.
weedy rice, we carried out coalescent simulations under
four demographic scenarios, and compared obtained
summary statistics with those of the observed data (Table
5, Figure 5). For both weedy rice groups, divergence from
cultivated relatives prior to domestication was not sup-

ported (Table 5). However, divergence prior to arrival to
the U.S. was supported for BHA1 from aus (Table 5). For
SH weedy rice, recent divergence from indica, occurring
either in Asia or in the U.S. was found to be most likely
(Table 5). Similar to our IMa analyses, we found that population bottlenecks have played a role in the evolution of
U.S. weedy rice, but bottleneck intensity appears to have
impacted SH more than BHA1 (Figure 5C, D, and 5E).
For both weedy populations, the distribution of Ïg indicates recent and simultaneous population expansion (Figure 5A), consistent with the known history of expansion
of cultivated rice production in the past 100 years in the
Southern rice belt. Founding in the U.S. for both BHA1
and SH appears to have occurred within the past 200
years (Figure 5B).

Discussion
The evolutionary origins of U.S. weedy rice

Current weedy rice populations in the U.S. are morphologically diverse, and we find that population structure in
weedy rice is correlated with hull morphology. The two
major weedy rice groups occurring in the U.S. are most

closely related to the exotic cultivated rice varieties, aus
and indica. Our data thus provides strong evidence that
weedy con-generics can evolve directly from domesticated backgrounds, a result that has been little reported/
confirmed to date [5,9,18].
Similar to previous morphometric and molecular
marker studies [13,14,16], weedy rice individuals that
have straw hulls and no awns (SH) cluster primarily with
O. sativa indica (Figure 3). Other hull morphologies,
including black and straw hull with awns (BHA1, BHA2),
cluster primarily with O. sativa aus (Figure 3), a relationship also recently detected with microsatellites [13].
Unlike previous microsatellite based studies [13,14], we
did not find conclusive evidence for contribution of wild
Oryza species to U.S. weedy rice. Although some O. rufipogon and O. nivara accessions clustered with indica and
SH weedy rice (Figure 3), only two out of 51 accessions
had the same level of shared genetic membership (>80%)
with SH weedy rice as all indica accessions. Moreover,
accessions of O. rufipogon and O. nivara that clustered
with SH groups in our analysis do not share hull morphology or any unique alleles with weedy accessions,

unlike indica, supporting shared ancestry as the most
likely explanation for the clustering pattern. Black hulls
and awns are a common phenotype in O. rufipogon and
O. nivara, but no accessions from this group clustered
with BHA weedy rice. Aus cultivars, however, often have
dark hulls and awns. The results of our clustering analyses combined with morphological data suggest that the
main U.S. weedy rice groups evolved primarily from aus
and indica genetic backgrounds.
Although clustering of weedy rice groups with cultivated relatives could also be due to common descent
from a shared ancestral founding gene pool, the pattern
of shared polymorphisms among weedy and cultivated
groups is more consistent with direct descent from
domesticated ancestors. Most of the SNPs found in the
SH and BHA groups are a subset of those found in indica
and aus, respectively (Additional file 6). This is particularly striking for the SH group, which contains only one
non-singleton SNP not also found in indica, fewer than

what it has with respect to O. rufipogon (Additional file
6). Moreover, in each main weedy rice group (SH and
BHA1), the most frequent haplotype (MFH) at each STS
locus was most often the MFH observed in its putative
progenitor group (data not shown). The greater divergence and number of private SNPs seen in the BHA
groups with respect to aus, as well as differences in some
cytotypes, however, suggest that demographic histories
(e.g. magnitude of bottleneck, founding events, time of
introduction) differ between the BHA and SH groups.
The close relationship of weedy rice with cultivated
groups not grown in the U.S. suggests that both major
weed groups were introduced either as stock seed contaminants or escaped breeding material. Although the
majority of rice grown commercially in the U.S is tropical
japonica [27,39], extensive opportunities for the intentional and unintentional introduction of Oryza germplasm have occurred. During the establishment of rice
industry in the southern rice belt (~1860-1900), rice ger-

Reagon et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:180
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/180

mplasm collected by the USDA was given to farmers
directly for testing [70], potentially facilitating the spread
and escape of weedy rice. During this time, farmers also
commonly purchased seed from outside the U.S., which
likely included representatives of all major O. sativa varieties.
The timing of weed evolution

If U.S. weedy rice groups originated from cultivated
ancestors, it is of interest to determine whether divergence of the weeds occurred prior to or concurrent with
their introduction to the U.S., and how divergence is
related to the timing of domestication. We first estimated
divergence time between aus and indica cultivar groups,
which likely stem from the same domestication event.
The ML estimate of ~6,000 years (Table 4) is reasonable,
given that the commonly accepted time for domestication
is ~10,000 years ago; however, confidence intervals for
the estimate are large, consistent with the difficulty in
estimating population parameters for very recent events
[71]. In contrast, IMa estimates for divergence of weedy
groups from their cultivated relatives were surprisingly
ancient, although, again, confidence intervals were very
large. ABC coalescent simulations, on the other hand,
supported a very recent SH-indica divergence, within the
past 100 years, but divergence for BHA1 and aus occurring within the past 7,000 years (Table 5).
We considered two possible explanations to account for
the discrepancy between SH-indica divergence time estimates obtained in each of our analyses. First, contribution of other groups to the weedy rice gene pool or
unsampled variation in the putative progenitor could violate IMa assumptions that gene flow occurs only between
population pairs, inflating estimates of divergence time.
However, SH weedy rice contains a subset of the nuclear
and cytoplasmic genetic diversity in indica (Table 2,
Additional file 6); the only non-singleton private SNP in
SH occurs at low frequency (13%), and was not found in
any other Oryza group other than BHA weeds. Thus,
introgression or incomplete sampling of indica diversity
is an unlikely explanation of divergence estimates.
Alternatively, IMa divergence time estimates may be
affected by the combination of an extremely strong bottleneck coupled with very recent divergence between
indica and SH. Although, the IMa model is particularly
suited to recently separated populations that are not
under equilibrium [54], simulation studies to test sensitivity of IMa to extremely recent splits with no accumulation of divergent mutations have not been done (J. Hey,
personal comm.). Both demographic analyses and the low
levels of observed polymorphism support a very strong
bottleneck for SH weedy rice (Tables 2 and 4, Figure 5).
Since few lineages seem to have founded this weedy
group, the divergence times obtained may represent the

Page 13 of 16

coalescence of these founders with the entire indica gene
pool, and not the more recent split between weedy rice
and progenitor. Observed patterns of polymorphism support the more recent divergence time estimated by ABC:
SH either diverged from indica concurrent with its establishment in the U.S. (maximum of 400 ybp), or within
1000 ybp (Table 5).
Both demographic analyses suggested an older divergence of BHA1 from its putative aus progenitor, either
after domestication, or close to the timing of domestication (Tables 4 and 5). In addition to one fixed site, the
BHA1 group contains some private SNPs and cytotypes
not observed in our aus sample (Table 2, Additional file
6). These patterns of polymorphism may indicate introgression of other Oryza, or incomplete sampling of aus
diversity, which could have an effect on estimates of
divergence time. Nuclear SNPs observed in BHA1 but
not aus occurred at moderate frequencies (average 52%)
and were also relatively frequent in other groups such as
O. rufipogon, O. nivara, and tropical japonica, supporting
the possibility of introgression. However, our Instruct
analysis did not detect contribution of other Oryza
groups to BHA weedy rice, and we have no a priori reason to believe our aus sampling did not capture the
genetic diversity present in this geographically limited
group. Given the shared ancestry of all cultivars, weeds,
and O. rufipogon, BHA1 private alleles shared with other
groups could be a result of lineage sorting since divergence from aus. Interestingly, the single fixed SNP differentiating BHA groups from aus was not observed in any
other Oryza group, supporting longer divergence
between BHA weedy rice and its putative progenitor. Our
estimates suggest that the founders of the BHA1 weedy
rice group split from their cultivated relatives several
thousand years ago and therefore may have existed as
weeds prior to their introduction to the U.S. The ABC
analysis marginally supported the introduction of BHA
weeds before SH, which is contrary to expected based on
historical records; black hull awned plants were not
recorded until the 1920's, and anecdotal evidence attributes their origin to a cultivar introduced to Louisiana
and abandoned due to excessive shattering [17].
The role of hybridization in U.S. weedy rice

In addition to multiple introductions, our results suggest
that hybridization and introgression occurring postfounding have contributed to the development of morphological diversity in weedy rice populations. The BRH
population is most probably a product of hybridization
occurring in the U.S. between SH and BHA weedy rice
(Figure 3). No indica or aus are grown in the U.S., and
therefore, an additional introduction of a weedy or cultivated group to the country would be required if BRH
were the result of hybridization between indica-aus,

indica-BHA, or SH-aus. The high estimates of Fst
between SH and BHA1 (~0.32) indicates that gene flow is
relatively infrequent between weedy groups. Prior
research has suggested non-overlapping flowering time,
high selfing rates, and height differences as possible
mechanisms restricting gene flow between straw-hull and
black-hull awned weedy types [16].
Evidence that tropical japonica cultivars grown in the
U.S. have contributed to genomic backgrounds of weeds
in our sample set is limited to a few individuals in the MX
populations (Figure 3, Additional file 1). Several studies
have observed both pre- and post-zygotic reproductive
isolating barriers in experimental crosses between tropical japonica and weedy rice [16,25]. The existence of
some barrier to gene flow is supported by the lack of
more extensive hybridization in our sample. However, the
barrier is "leaky," as both BHA and SH-tropical japonica
hybrids are found (Figure 3B). Additionally, the maternal
lineage of at least one hybrid was consistent with weedy
rice being the paternal parent, and therefore, gene flow
from the weed to the crop could be an alternative pathway for weed evolution. Although infrequent, the fact
that hybridization occurs at all presents a challenge to the
management and continued use of cultivars containing
traits suspected to increase weed fitness, such as herbicide resistance.

Conclusions
Our characterization of genome-wide patterns of SNP
variation in U.S. weedy rice demonstrate that multiple
introductions, bottlenecks, and hybridization among
introduced lineages have been important in the evolution
of weedy rice, and that different evolutionary histories
can lead to similar weedy lifestyles. Contrary to previous
studies, we do not find evidence that wild Oryza contributed directly to the genetic background of U.S. weedy rice
groups. Together these results provide strong evidence
that agricultural weeds can evolve directly from domesticated backgrounds despite experiencing significant bottlenecks and loss of genetic diversity.
The absence of any tropical japonica weedy types in the
U.S. is puzzling, as these cultivars are considered better
adapted to the temperate conditions of the Southern U.S.
than indica and aus cultivars. Based on typical descriptions of aus and indica, it would seem that increased tolerance to cold, high dormancy, easy shattering, and lack
of photoperiod sensitivity (though this trait is found in
aus) may have evolved in U.S. weedy rice populations. It
will be interesting to determine whether trait evolution
supports pre-existence of the groups as weeds in Asia, or
evolution of weediness upon introduction to the U.S.
agroecosystem.
