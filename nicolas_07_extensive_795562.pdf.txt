Abstract
Background: While genes that are conserved between related bacterial species are usually
thought to have evolved along with the species, phylogenetic trees reconstructed for individual
genes may contradict this picture and indicate horizontal gene transfer. Individual trees are often
not resolved with high confidence, however, and in that case alternative trees are generally not
considered as contradicting the species tree, although not confirming it either. Here we conduct
an in-depth analysis of 401 protein phylogenetic trees inferred with varying levels of confidence for
three lactobacilli from the acidophilus complex. At present the relationship between these bacteria,
isolated from environments as diverse as the gastrointestinal tract (Lactobacillus acidophilus and
Lactobacillus johnsonii) and yogurt (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus), is ambiguous due to
contradictory phenotypical and 16S rRNA based classifications.
Results: Among the 401 phylogenetic trees, those that could be reconstructed with high
confidence support the 16S-rRNA tree or one alternative topology in an astonishing 3:2 ratio, while
the third possible topology is practically absent. Lowering the confidence threshold for trees to be
taken into consideration does not significantly affect this ratio, and therefore suggests that gene
transfer may have affected as much as 40% of the core genome genes. Gene function bias suggests
that the 16S rRNA phylogeny of the acidophilus complex, which indicates that L. acidophilus and L.
delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus are the closest related of these three species, is correct. A novel approach
of comparison of interspecies protein divergence data employed in this study allowed to determine
that gene transfer most likely took place between the lineages of the two species found in the
gastrointestinal tract.
Conclusion: This case-study reports an unprecedented level of phylogenetic incongruence,
presumably resulting from extensive horizontal gene transfer. The data give a first indication of the
large extent of gene transfer that may take place in the gastrointestinal tract and its accumulated
effect. For future studies, our results should encourage a careful weighing of data on phylogenetic
tree topology, confidence and distribution to conclude on the absence or presence and extent of
horizontal gene transfer.

Background
The rapidly growing wealth of genome sequence data
from closely related bacteria sheds a new light on bacterial
evolution and will become an increasingly important
source of knowledge in the near future. Comparative analyses open the way for the identification of factors acting
on sequence evolution such as neutral genetic drift, purifying selection or positive selection [1,2]. In addition,
comparative studies may use genome data for purposes as
diverse as inferring functional links between proteins
from phylogenetic occurrence profiles of the proteins
[3,4] or searching for functional motifs in non-coding
DNA by phylogenetic footprinting [5,6]. These analyses
will not reach their full potential, however, without first
understanding the genealogical history of the sequences
under study. Fundamental questions are: which is the
organismal phylogeny? do the histories of individual
genes conform to the organismal phylogeny and if not,
how do their histories deviate from this phylogeny? can
the organismal phylogeny even be recognized? Answers
likely depend on the organisms and the evolutionary distances between them. Multi-locus sequence typing data
[7,8] show that genetic exchanges can be frequent
between strains of a same species and may challenge the
idea of reconstructing the organismal phylogeny, defined
as the history of the cell lineages across rounds of cell division. At higher phylogenetic levels, the most widely
accepted point of view seems to be that a unique tree can
still describe the history of a large majority of the conserved sequences, and corresponds to the relationship by
descent between the bacterial species [9,10]. However,
confidence in phylogenetic tree reconstructions based on
individual genes is often weak, and gene transfer can not
be excluded [11]. It was also proposed that trees supported by a large number of genes may in some cases
reflect preferred routes of gene transfer rather than the
lines of descent of the species [12,13]. In this context, we
believe that answers could come from more in depth case
studies. Here, we present an analysis of the genome history of a particular group of bacteria among the firmicutes
that shows intriguing relationships and is of primary
importance for humans.
The Lactobacillus acidophilus group ("acidophilus complex") is a phylogenetically distinct group of closely
related lactobacilli [14], containing species isolated from
very diverse environments. Among the best known, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (hereafter referred to as L.
delbrueckii) is extensively used for the production of
yogurt and derived dairy products, whereas Lactobacillus
acidophilus and Lactobacillus johnsonii are isolated from the
human gut.
Although the contours of this group are clear, the exact
relationship between the species within the group is more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/141

ambiguous. This ambiguity is illustrated by the fact that
the group was originally referred to as the L. delbrueckii
group [15], a designation which was questioned when it
appeared that the GC content of the L. delbrueckii genome
strongly differed from that of the other genomes in the
group. Accordingly, the group was given the name of a
more representative member and has since been known as
the L. acidophilus group [14]. L. acidophilus itself has not
always been correctly identified. Due to a lack of resolving
power of phenotypic classification methods, L. johnsonii
and Lactobacillus gasseri have often been classified as L. acidophilus in the past [16].
More detailed knowledge on the phylogenetic relationships within the acidophilus complex will be of particular
interest because of the health claims that accompany several species in this group. Yogurt, containing live L. delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus, has long been
recognized for its health benefits and is at the basis of the
concept of probiotics [17,18], currently defined by the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
as "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host".
Today, L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii are both commercialized as probiotics, and are the subject of important
research activities aiming to identify the functions and
understand the mechanisms involved in probiotic effects.
In a more general way, resolution of interspecies relationships of closely related organisms is a prerequisite for an
improved comprehension of species evolution and factors
contributing in this process.
The genome sequences of L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus and L.
delbrueckii have recently become available [19-21] along
with the genome sequences of Lactobacillus plantarum and
Lactobacillus sakei [22,23], two more distantly related
lactobacilli that do not belong to the acidophilus complex. These data should allow a better understanding of
the evolutionary relationship between the lactobacilli of
the acidophilus complex. As a first element, van de Guchte
et al. [21] showed that the similarly sized genomes in this
group share a conserved structural backbone, evidenced
by a clear global synteny and indicative of their close relatedness. Here we present a more detailed analysis of this
relationship using rRNA and protein sequences based
phylogeny methods. Our results strongly suggest that
extensive horizontal gene transfer took place between the
L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii species lineages, possibly in
the gastrointestinal tract.

and annotation data now allows to study this discrepancy
in more detail by a breakdown in GC content at codon
positions 1, 2 and 3 in coding sequences (Table 1). The
calculated overall GC content of L. delbrueckii (49.7%)
confirms earlier estimations, largely deviating from the
values obtained for L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii (34.7
and 34.6%, respectively). The difference appears to be
much smaller, however, when considering the first codon
position only, and almost negligible for the second codon
position. In contrast, an extremely high difference is
found at the third codon position that shows a 65.0% GC
content for L. delbrueckii compared to 25.0% and 24.4%
for L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii, respectively.

mentioned above where L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii
look much more alike than L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii.

Protein family occurrence profiles
A measure of functional similarity between the five lactobacilli considered in this study is obtained from the occurrence profiles of protein families (cf Materials and
Methods) across the five species. The results shown in Fig.
1 demonstrate that protein content clearly distinguishes
the three lactobacilli of the acidophilus complex from L.
plantarum and L. sakei. After protein families found in only
one species and families that exist in all five species, the
two most frequent profiles correspond to families with
representatives in L. plantarum and L. sakei but not in the
three lactobacilli of the acidophilus complex (263 families), and families that are present in the latter three lactobacilli but not in L. plantarum and L. sakei (143 families).
Within the acidophilus complex, protein content separates L. delbrueckii from L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii. The
latter two lactobacilli share 130 families not found elsewhere, a figure that contrasts with the small number of
protein families specific to either L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii (34 families) or L. johnsonii and L. delbrueckii (13
families).

A first tree was constructed based on the average distances
between species in the 480 single copy protein families
(i.e. the protein families that contain exactly one representative in each of the five genomes considered) (Fig.
2b). Surprisingly, the topology of this tree differs from
that of the 16S rRNA tree in the branching order of the
three species of the acidophilus complex: L. acidophilus
and L. johnsonii group together while the L. delbrueckii lineage branches earlier.

Phylogeny of 16S rRNAs and orthologous proteins
The evolutionary tree inferred from 16S rRNA sequences
is often considered authoritative in bacterial phylogeny
reconstruction. In this tree, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii
group together while the L. johnsonii lineage branches earlier (Fig. 2a). This result may seem surprising, since in
apparent contradiction with both the difficulty to distinguish L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii on the basis of physi-

Other powerful approaches to investigate phylogenetic
relationships use sequence data of either concatenated
proteins [24], or a large number of individual proteins
[25,26]. The latter procedure is expected to produce the
same tree for the majority of proteins, while a tree with an
aberrant branching topology for a particular protein (phylogenetic incongruence) is interpreted as evidence for horizontal gene transfer [27].

Then, trees were reconstructed for individual protein families using the more powerful maximum-likelihood (ML)
method. According to this analysis, 401 of the 480 families strongly support the grouping of the three lactobacilli
of the acidophilus complex (confidence level ≥ 95% by
AU-test). Among these, the relationship between the three
members of the acidophilus complex was studied in
detail. Of the 79 ML trees that could be reconstructed with
≥ 95% confidence, 47 correspond to the 16S rRNA tree,
and 32 to the average protein distance reference tree. No
support was found for the third possible topology that
groups L. delbrueckii and L. johnsonii (Fig. 2c). Two aspects
of these results are remarkable. First, the 16S rRNA topology (hereafter referred as Ta) and the average protein tree
topology (Tb) are found in an astonishing ratio of approximately 3:2. Second, the absence of the third possible
topology (Tc) contrasts with the high proportion of proteins supporting the Tb topology.

Second, long branch attraction effects (reviewed in [30])
have been described in parsimony reconstruction and
may also affect ML reconstruction under some conditions.
Therefore, two replicate data-sets were simulated under
the hypothesis that either topology Ta or Tb applies to the
full set of genes using a parametric bootstrap approach
[31]. The results presented in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate
that the distribution pattern observed on the real data set
is incompatible with the patterns observed on sequences
simulated under a unique topology.
A last argument that seems to rule out the hypothesis of
artifacts in tree reconstruction as an explanation for the
observation of two major tree topologies is that potential

These results could theoretically have been affected by two
well-known sources of artifacts in tree reconstruction.
First, incorrect grouping of sequences with similar base
composition [28] could have biased tree reconstruction to
group L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii together because of a
similar GC content (34.7% and 34.6%, respectively),
while diminishing the distance between L. delbrueckii, L.
plantarum and L. sakei (49.7%, 45.9% and 41.3% GC,
respectively). Although at the protein sequence level this
effect would be alleviated, we verified whether L. delbrueckii genes supporting topology Ta or Tb (Fig. 3) differed in average GC content. This appeared not to be the
case, nor was it the case for the corresponding L. acidophilus or L. johnsonii genes (see Additional file 1: section
1). As a further check we also reconstructed the gene trees
on the basis of nucleotide sequences at the second codon
position that shows little differences in GC content
between species (Table 1), as suggested by Delsuc, Phillips
and Penny [29]. The results are similar to those obtained
from the protein sequences, although the confidence in
tree reconstruction is generally lower due to the loss of
information, and a strong correlation is observed between
the protein based trees and the second codon position
based trees (see Additional file 1: section 2).

number of protein families

A similar distribution is observed for ML trees at different
thresholds of confidence (Fig. 3). Of 181 trees reconstructed with ≥ 80% confidence, 104 correspond to topology Ta, 75 to topology Tb, and 2 to topology Tc. When the
confidence threshold is lowered to 50%, 209 proteins are
found to support Ta, 141 Tb and 22 Tc. These results are
essentially the same as those obtained when only using
trees with a confidence level ≥ 95%: a 3:2 ratio between
topologies Ta and Tb, and (near) absence of topology Tc.
Thus, although individual trees have a slightly higher
chance of being erroneous, the overall informational content remains the same. Therefore, proteins with tree confidence levels <95% can be exploited for further analysis,
offering the advantages linked to the use of larger datasets.

artifacts are unlikely to differentially affect tree reconstruction for different protein families.
Therefore, the highly remarkable fact that two almost
equally important evolutionary tree topologies are found
instead of one clearly dominant topology strongly suggests that horizontal gene transfer played an important
role in the evolution of the three species of the acidophilus complex considered in this study.
Gene function bias
In order to establish the original species tree we examined
whether tree topology was correlated to gene function.
Taking the functional classification established for L. delbrueckii [21] as a reference (39 categories), a statistically
significant overall correlation between topology and functional class was observed when considering protein families for which the tree topology was resolved at a
confidence level of 95% or 80%. For classes containing at
least 4 proteins with a resolved topology, a Fisher exact
test indicates p ~ 0.006 and p ~ 0.027 at the 95% and 80%
confidence level, respectively.

The bias in gene functions therefore both reinforces the

(a) dataset simulated under Ta

large majority of ribosomal proteins (17 versus 6) supports Ta. Other categories supporting preferentially Ta
include "membrane bioenergenetics" (8 vs. 0) and the
proteins involved in "translation initiation", "translation
elongation" and "translation termination" (16 vs. 2). On
the basis of current knowledge about gene transfer these
results indicate that Ta represents the species tree by
descent, and that Tb is the result of horizontal transfer:
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have often been described as
prone to horizontal transfer ([32] and references therein),
whereas proteins involved in translation such as ribosomal proteins are generally believed to be refractory to
transfer [33].

Remarkably though, a substantial number of genes that
are not usually thought of as subject to horizontal transfer
support topology Tb at the 80% confidence level (see
Additional file 2: Table A2). These include genes involved
in fundamental processes as DNA replication (polA, polC,
dnaE, dnaG), recombination (recD, recJ, recN, recQ) and
translation (ribosomal protein genes rpmE, rpsJ; fusA, tsf),
even if the large majority of proteins in these categories
support Ta.

Phylogenetic reconstruction from simulated datasets. Two
replicate datasets were simulated under the hypothesis of a
unique topology common to all proteins and used in phylogenetic reconstruction. Upper panel: the underlying topology is

Tb. The number of proteins supporting each of the three
possible tree topologies Ta, Tb, and Tc (cf Fig. 3) is indicated

This overall correlation is even more significant (p ~
0.003) for topologies resolved at the 50% confidence
level, which still show the 3:2 ratio between topologies Ta
and Tb (Fig. 3) and the near absence of topology Tc. In
this case, the strongest association between a topology
and a particular functional category is found for the category of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that support Tb
in a spectacular 15:4 (Tb:Ta) ratio. On the opposite, a

Pairwise evolutionary distances
Assuming that gene transfer is at the basis of topology Tb,
the question arises whether the lineages concerned by this
transfer can be identified. As illustrated in Fig. 5, two
hypotheses could explain Tb if Ta reflects the actual species tree: (i) Tb is a consequence of horizontal gene transfer between L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii or (ii) Tb reflects
the horizontal inflow of genes in L. delbrueckii from an
unidentified species whose lineage branches before the
point of divergence of L. delbrueckii and L. johnsonii. These
two hypotheses imply very different predictions about
pairwise distances between organisms for proteins supporting either Ta or Tb.

The main prediction of hypothesis (i) is that the distance
between L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii should be smaller
for proteins supporting Tb (group B) than for those supporting Ta (group A). Additional consequences for group
B proteins may include a smaller distance between L. johnsonii and L. delbrueckii and a larger distance between L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii (see Additional file 3: Fig. A3
and Table A3). The main prediction of hypothesis (ii) is
that the distance between L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii
should be the same for group A and group B proteins.
Additional consequences for group B proteins may

include larger distances between L. delbrueckii and L. johnsonii as well as between L. delbrueckii and L. acidophilus.
Comparing evolutionary distances between species for
different proteins is complicated by differential proteinspecific rates of evolution. This rate is known to vary by
more than one order of magnitude between proteins
[34,35]. The relative speed of evolution of each protein
compared to others has, however, been described as relatively well conserved across lineages [36]. Therefore, to
compare pairwise distances between the three lactobacilli
of the acidophilus complex for different proteins, the dis-

tances were normalized using the distance measured
between L. plantarum and L. sakei for the same protein.
The latter distance was verified not to depend on the tree
topology (Ta or Tb) supported by the protein (MannWhitney test p ~ 0.75).
The 179 protein families of groups A and B for which the
trees had been reconstructed with ≥ 80% confidence were
then plotted as a function of normalized pairwise evolutionary distances. The results shown in Fig. 6 are clearly in
favor of hypothesis (i) and reject hypothesis (ii). The most
pronounced difference between groups A and B is found

Normalized pairwise distances between the species of the acidophilus complex
Normalized pairwise distances between the species of the acidophilus complex. Single protein families supporting either topology Ta (closed blue dots) or Tb (open green circles) of Fig. 3 are plotted as a function of normalized pairwise evolutionary distances. Results are presented for protein tree topologies resolved at the 80% confidence level. Horizontal and vertical lines
indicate the median of these two groups of proteins on the vertical or horizontal distance axis, respectively (plain blue and
dashed green lines for Ta and Tb, respectively). Diagonal dotted lines are drawn to help visualization of the relation between
distances on the horizontal and vertical axes. *, the most pronounced difference between Ta and Tb proteins is found in the
normalized distances between L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii.

in the normalized distances between L. acidophilus and L.
johnsonii: within the set of 179 proteins, the median is
40% smaller for group B than for group A proteins (MannWhitney U-test p ~ 10e-13, Fig. 6bc). In addition, as
expected if horizontal transfers occurred relatively
recently, group B proteins are concentrated on the equidistance diagonal when plotted as a function of the distance between L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii and the
distance between L. johnsonii and L. delbrueckii (Fig. 6a).
Our results also suggest that horizontal gene transfer
between L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii took place in both
directions as the normalized distances between L. delbrueckii and L. johnsonii are smaller for group B proteins
than for group A proteins, while the inverse is found for
the distances between L. delbrueckii and L. acidophilus (Fig.
6a; see also Additional file 3: Fig. A3 and Table A3).
The results presented in Fig. 6 therefore converge to the
conclusion that gene transfer has taken place between L.
acidophilus and L. johnsonii. A detailed analysis of the interspecies distances in Fig. 6 and predictions concerning
these distances from 8 different scenarios (see Additional
file 3: Fig. A3 and Table A3) provides a second line of evidence to support Ta as the original species tree and Tb as

the result of bidirectional horizontal transfer between L.
acidophilus and L. johnsonii.
Distribution of horizontally transferred genes on the
chromosome
To gain more insight into the process of horizontal gene
transfer, we examined the relationship between supported
phylogeny and chromosomal position of the genes. In
particular, we were interested to know whether horizontal
transfer events changed the order of the genes on the
recipient chromosome and to describe the supported
topology in relation to the chromosomal distribution of
the genes.

Fig. 7 shows the chromosomal positions of the orthologous genes in the three genomes of the acidophilus group
together with the topology supported by the corresponding protein families. A global synteny between the three
genomes is clearly visible. Horizontal transfer between L.
acidophilus and L. johnsonii did generally not affect synteny. In addition, the limited number of gene order rearrangements that did occur do not preferentially involve
genes that support the topology that is characteristic of
horizontal gene transfer events (topology Tb).

The alternation of genes supporting either topology
strongly suggests that the large number of genes supporting topology Tb were not transferred in a single event, but
rather reflect the result of numerous small transfers
encompassing no more than a few genes at a time.

Discussion
In this study, the evolutionary relationship between three
lactobacilli of the acidophilus complex, L. acidophilus, L.
johnsonii and L. delbrueckii, is clarified. At first sight, L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii seem the closest related of these
three bacteria, sharing the highest number of orthologous
genes and a similar GC content largely different from that
of L. delbrueckii. A similar result was obtained on the basis
of fermentation profile grouping [37]. This conclusion is
contradicted by 16S rRNA phylogeny, however, which
indicates that L. acidophilus is more closely related to L.
delbrueckii than to L. johnsonii.
Whole genome sequence information provides two explanations for these paradoxical results. First, the aberrant
GC content of L. delbrueckii appears to concern GC3 essentially. Furthermore, the L. delbrueckii GC3 content sharply
deviates from the very strong correlation that is observed
between overall GC content and GC3 content in bacteria

[21]. As third codon positions are often informationaly
neutral in translation and, as a consequence of the resulting lack of selective pressure, evolve more rapidly than
first and second codon positions, this suggests that L. delbrueckii is in a phase of evolution towards a higher GC
content. The different GC content of L. delbrueckii thus
seems to reflect a recent development, and indicate a different future rather than a different history.
Second, the results of protein phylogenetic analyses suggest that extensive genetic exchange has taken place
between the L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii lineages, giving
rise to a closer apparent relationship than expected on the
basis of 16S rRNA phylogeny which depicts the historical
lines of descent of these species. Very little or no transfer
would on the contrary have taken place between L. delbrueckii and L. johnsonii, while possible transfer between L.
delbrueckii and L. acidophilus could not be detected because
this type of transfer would not affect the apparent tree
topology of the transferred gene. From the viewpoint of
present day knowledge on the habitats of these bacteria
these results may not seem surprising as L. acidophilus and
L. johnsonii are found in the same environment, the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, while L. delbrueckii is found in an isolated environment, yogurt.

It is worth mentioning that in theory topological discordance between gene trees could also result from the coexistence of multiple gene copies along internal branches of
the species tree. Differing gene copies may be present
within the same genome, as paralogous genes resulting
from gene duplication [38], or in different genomes as a
consequence of natural intra-species genetic diversity,
causing a phenomenon known as incomplete lineage
sorting [39,40]. If multiple gene copies were to explain the
existence of tree topologies other than that of the species
tree (Ta) in the present study, multiple gene copies would
need to have existed in the ancestral species lineage and
survived until the separation of the L. acidophilus and L.
delbrueckii lineages. In the case of paralogous copies, one
copy would subsequently need to have been lost in each
of the three terminal lineages as our analysis was restricted
to single copy genes. In contrast to horizontal gene transfer, these explanations have in common that gene divergence should always have occurred before species
divergence, leading to a longer interspecies distance for
the proteins with an alternative tree topology. This does
not match with our observation that the pairwise evolutionary distance between L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii is
substantially shorter for those genes that do not support
Ta, which instead suggests that the L. acidophilus and L.
johnsonii copies of those genes have a common ancestor in
a more recent past than the time of separation of the species lineages.
In addition, these alternative explanations would rather
predict the balanced coexistence of Tb and Tc topologies
instead of the observed overwhelming preponderance of
Tb (see [41] for a detailed mathematical treatment of the
possible consequences of incomplete lineage sorting).
Finally, the neutral incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis
could not explain the observed gene function bias.
Put in a wider perspective, the results presented here show
a number of remarkable aspects. The most surprising is
the apparent extent of gene transfer events having affected
the conserved core genome. Horizontal gene transfer is
recognized as a source of the great plasticity of the gene
repertoire at all taxonomic levels in the bacterial world
[9,13], but is commonly believed to have little or no
impact on the genealogy of the conserved core genome. In
our data set of 401 conserved protein families (representing about one fifth of the total number of proteins in each
of the acidophilus complex species) that fulfilled the
requirements to be analyzed, however, protein trees
where found to support either the rRNA topology or an
alternative topology in an astonishing ratio of about 3:2,
independent of the confidence threshold used in tree
reconstruction. This result suggests that orthologous gene
replacement between two lineages may have affected
about 40% of the conserved core genome, a level compa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/141

rable to that reported between strains of the same species
[42]. Although it is true that L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii
are closely related species, their present day DNA
sequences are only 51.5% identical, as computed across
our 481 alignments. The distribution of transferred genes
by L. acidophilus – L. johnsonii interspecies distance (Fig. 6)
suggests that a substantial fraction of the transfer events
has taken place relatively recently, at a stage where the
DNA sequences of the two species would be expected to
already have diverged considerably. To our knowledge,
indications for such an important impact of gene transfer
on gene genealogies in a group of closely related bacteria
were only reported for the Prochlorococcus/marine Synechococcus group of cyanobacteria where genetic
exchanges are suspected to have overwhelmed the species
genealogy [12].
Our study goes beyond the report of an important level of
topological discordance presumed to result from genetic
exchanges. The correlation between gene function and
topology strengthens the gene transfer hypothesis and
makes it possible to disentangle the species genealogy and
the gene transfer signal. Examination of the protein divergence data further allowed to locate the transfers between
the L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii lineages yielding a picture coherent with the (current) common ecological niche
of these bacteria. A systematic search for gross violations
of "clock-like" evolution has been proposed earlier as an
efficient screen to detect orthologous gene replacements
in large data sets [36]. Here we show that similar ideas can
be used to refine the interpretation of topological tree discordance.
The statistically significant correlation between gene function and gene transfer is per-se another important result in
the context of orthologous gene replacement between
closely related bacterial lineages. It also provides a second
indication that a substantial fraction of gene transfer has
taken place after L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii had
diverged to a degree that transfer between the two species
would not be selectively neutral. Either negative or positive selection could have shape this bias by preventing or
facilitating the fixation of transferred alleles. The fact that
most of the aminoacyl tRNA-synthetases appear as transferred between L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii and that
some variants of these genes are known to confer antibiotic resistance [32,43] may argue for a role of positive
selection. Although the benefit may simply rely in the
compensation of deleterious mutations fixed by chance,
our results could encourage the search for possible adaptive benefits associated with the other transferred genes.
As indicated above, gene transfer between the L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii lineages did most likely take place
in the gastrointestinal tract, the common habitat of these

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:141

bacteria. Although several studies demonstrated the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in the gastrointestinal
tract [44], this is to our knowledge the first report to give
an indication of the potentially large extent of natural
transfer of core genome genes between two bacterial species in this environment and its accumulated effect, a key
issue in the context of a growing interest for the metagenome of the human gastrointestinal tract [45].
Finally, our results demonstrate that gene trees even when
reconstructed at a relatively low confidence level can be
used to reveal horizontal gene transfer. To understand the
importance of this statement it is worth comparing our
study with those conducted by Daubin, Moran and Ochman [42], Lerat, Daubin and Moran [26] and Lerat et al.
[9] that used similar tools but concluded that the genealogy of the large majority of orthologous genes conforms
to the organismal phylogeny. These authors compared the
trees reconstructed from individual genes by evaluating
the proportion of genes that shows strong statistical support for a tree differing from a reference tree at a stringent
95% confidence level. This approach would identify only
32 genes as horizontally transferred within the acidophilus complex (i.e. supporting Tb, Fig. 3). However, this
does not imply that the large majority of gene genealogies
actually conform to the reference tree. In the present
study, only 47 of the proteins studied support the 16S
rRNA tree (Ta) with ≥ 95% confidence, and thus the
astonishing ratio between the two tree topologies
remains. The additional information contained in our
dataset where comparable proportions of proteins support two tree topologies while the third possible topology
is almost absent, independent of the confidence level
applied, prompted us thus to adopt another perspective
and to reason in terms of support for different topologies,
rather than rejection, to determine the extent of horizontal gene transfer. Thus, while our main conclusions are
based on phylogenetic tree reconstruction using stringent
criteria, the additional information contained in our dataset allowed the use of more data and, therefore, an
advanced analysis of our results and extrapolation of our
conclusions.

Conclusion
This case-study reports an unprecedented level of phylogenetic incongruence presumably resulting from extensive
horizontal gene transfer between two related bacterial lineages, and gives a first indication of the large extent of
gene transfer possibly taking place in the gastrointestinal
tract and its accumulated effect. For future studies, our
results should encourage a careful weighing of data on
phylogenetic tree topology, confidence and distribution
to conclude on the absence or presence and extent of horizontal gene transfer. In our particular case, trees resolved
with intermediate confidence levels allowed to extrapo-

late and refine conclusions from high confidence trees on
horizontal gene transfer.

Methods
Data
This study is based on the five complete Lactobacillus
genome sequences available by the end of 2005: L.
plantarum (accession number AL935263 [22]); L. johnsonii
(AE017198 [19]); L. acidophilus (CP000033 [20]); L. sakei
(CR936503 [23]); L. delbrueckii (CR954253 [21]).
Protein families
Protein families were constructed and only those that contained one representative per species were used for further
study. In order to do so, similar proteins were selected on
the basis of genome to genome BLASTP comparison with
alignments covering at least 80% of both protein
sequences and having E-values smaller than 10-5. Within
this set of proteins, protein families were then defined
using the procedure proposed by Lerat, Daubin and
Moran [26] where pairs of similar proteins are considered
as belonging to the same family when the pairwise similarity level exceeds a certain threshold. Pairwise similarity
is measured by the BLAST score ratio (BSR), here computed as the ratio between the raw BLAST score of the pairwise alignment and the maximal raw BLAST score of the
alignment of either of the two proteins against itself. Families constructed in this way may contain pairs of genes
whose BSR does not exceed the chosen threshold, but
which are indirectly connected through pairs that imply
other genes. BSR thresholds from 0 to 0.45 were evaluated
in steps of 0.05, and the threshold was finally set to 0.30.
This choice maximized the number of protein families
with exactly one representative in each of the five
genomes (480 single copy protein families) and corresponds to the threshold selected by Lerat, Daubin and
Moran [26] and Lerat et al. [9].
Phylogenetic analyses
Evolution of the DNA sequences of the small subunit of
the ribosome (16S rRNA) and of the proteins of the 480
single copy protein families described above was analyzed
using model based approaches. Each set of five sequences
was aligned using ClustalW v1.83 [46] with default
parameters. Aligned sequences were filtered to remove
positions with gaps as well as positions directly adjacent
to gaps. This resulted in a 1539 bp long alignment for the
16S rRNA sequences, and a total of 150387 aligned
amino-acids for the protein sequences. Parameters of the
evolution models for DNA and protein sequences were
automatically estimated on each alignment using TREEPUZZLE [47].

The 16S rRNA alignment served to construct a reference
tree by maximum-likelihood (ML) using TREE-PUZZLE

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:141

with a HKY nucleotide evolution model [48] and a
Gamma model [49] for evolution rate variation between
sites. Confidence was assessed in 1000 bootstrap replicates generated with the SEQBOOT program of the
PHYLIP package v3.6 [50].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/141

Pairwise distances
Pairwise distances between protein sequences were calculated under a JTT model with gamma correction using
TREE-PUZZLE.

Authors' contributions
A second reference tree was obtained from the protein
sequences of the 480 single copy protein families using
the neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in the
NEIGHBOR program of PHYLIP. For this reconstruction,
multiprotein organism pairwise distances were used that
account for gene-specific gamma parameters [51]. These
distances are obtained as the weighted average (alignments having weights proportional to their lengths) of the
pairwise distances computed separately for each protein
family using TREE-PUZZLE with a JTT protein evolution
model [52]. Confidence was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates created by sampling with replacement
from the set of 480 alignements.

PN and MvdG designed the study, interpreted the results
and wrote the manuscript. PN performed the analyses. PB,
SDE and EM contributed to the interpretation and the
presentation of the study.

Phylogenetic reconstructions were also performed separately for each of the 480 protein families using an ML
method without molecular clock assumption. For a 5 leaf
unrooted tree, 15 topologies are possible which were systematically examined. The site-wise log-likelihoods calculated by TREE-PUZZLE (with option-wsl) for each
topology served to evaluate the confidence of the reconstruction using the Approximately-Unbiased test (AUtest) implemented in CONSEL [53,54]. This test computes p-values that delineate embedded confidence subsets of trees among a set of candidates. The confidence
level that we report corresponds to one minus the p-value
threshold beyond which the confidence subset is not
restricted to the single best scoring tree. For those reconstructions that strongly supported the monophyly of the
acidophilus complex, a separate AU-test was performed to
compare the three possible topologies for the branching
of the L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii lineages.
Parametric bootstrap simulations
Replicate datasets of our 480 protein sequence alignments
were simulated with a JTT model using the evolver program included in PAML v3.15 [55] under the hypothesis
that the histories of the different genes are all compatible
with a unique topology. Branch lengths that served in the
simulation were optimized using TREE-PUZZLE for each
particular protein family and the simulated data preserved
original alignment lengths, amino-acid compositions and
variations of the rate of evolution among positions as
described by the Gamma parameter. Phylogenetic analyses carried out on replicate datasets conform to the protocol described for the original data.
