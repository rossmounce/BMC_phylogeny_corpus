Evidence for an early evolutionary emergence of
γ-type carbonic anhydrases as components of
mitochondrial respiratory complex I
Research article

Ryan MR Gawryluk and Michael W Gray*

Abstract
Background: The complexity of mitochondrial complex I (CI; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) has increased
considerably relative to the homologous complex in bacteria. Comparative analyses of CI composition in animals, fungi
and land plants/green algae suggest that novel components of mitochondrial CI include a set of 18 proteins common
to all eukaryotes and a variable number of lineage-specific subunits. In plants and green algae, several purportedly
plant-specific proteins homologous to γ-type carbonic anhydrases (γCA) have been identified as components of CI.
However, relatively little is known about CI composition in the unicellular protists, the characterizations of which are
essential to our understanding of CI evolution.
Results: We have performed a tandem mass spectrometric characterization of CI from the amoeboid protozoon
Acanthamoeba castellanii. Among the proteins identified were two γCA homologs, AcCa1 and AcCa2, demonstrating
that γCA proteins are not specific to plants/green algae. In fact, through bioinformatics searches we detected γCA
homologs in diverse protist lineages, and several of these homologs are predicted to possess N-terminal mitochondrial
targeting peptides.
Conclusions: The detection of γCAs in CI of Acanthamoeba, considered to be a closer relative of animals and fungi
than plants, suggests that γCA proteins may have been an ancestral feature of mitochondrial CI, rather than a novel,
plant-specific addition. This assertion is supported by the presence of genes encoding γCAs in the nuclear genomes of
a wide variety of eukaryotes. Together, these findings emphasize the importance of a phylogenetically broad
characterization of CI for elucidating CI evolution in eukaryotes.
Background
Mitochondrial complex I (CI; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is a multi-subunit and intricate proton
pump that is responsible for the first step in the canonical
respiratory chain - the oxidation of NADH and subsequent reduction of ubiquinone. Investigations of CI
structure in animals and fungi portray CI as an L-shaped
complex consisting of a hydrophobic domain integrated
into the inner mitochondrial membrane and a hydrophilic mitochondrial matrix domain that oxidizes NADH
and transfers electrons along 8-9 Fe-S clusters [1]. Mitochondrial CI comprises 35-45 proteins (~900-1000 kDa),

which are encoded in both the mitochondrial and nuclear
genomes. Conversely, the homologous ~550-kDa bacterial CI consists of only 14 subunits [2], suggesting a massive expansion of CI in eukaryotes.
The subunit composition of mitochondrial CI has been
intensively studied in animals [3], fungi [4,5] and land
plants/green algae [6,7]. Comparative proteomic and
genomic analyses of CI composition in these groups have
provided insight into the evolution of mitochondrial CI:
specifically, in all three groups, the 14-subunit 'bacterial
core' (corresponding to the subunits inherited from the
α-proteobacterial ancestor of mitochondria; [8]) has been
retained, while an additional 18-subunit 'eukaryotic core'
(made up of proteins shared by these eukaryotic lineages
but not by bacterial CI) along with a variable number of
lineage-specific proteins has been added [9]. Few of the
lineage-specific proteins are similar to other proteins of

known function in available databases; however, in plants
[7,10] and green algae [6], CI contains multiple proteins
with high similarity to γ-type carbonic anhydrases
(γCAs), first described as a homotrimeric complex (Cam)
in the methanogenic archaeon, Methanosarcina thermophila [11].
Carbonic anhydrases are ubiquitous metalloenzymes
that catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2 to HCO3-.
Five evolutionarily unrelated CA classes (α, β, γ, δ, and ζ)
are currently known, suggesting that this important enzymatic mechanism has been invented independently multiple times. The γCA class is among the most ancient,
with homologs widespread in Archaea and Bacteria [12];
however, in eukaryotes, γCA homologs have been
described from a phylogenetically narrow collection of
species, comprising almost exclusively green algae and
land plants, in association with CI. In this group, singleparticle electron microscopy studies have demonstrated
the presence of an additional CI domain [13,14]. This
novel structure, likely representing the γCA proteins, is
associated with the inner membrane portion of CI and
projects into the mitochondrial matrix. The function of
γCA proteins in CI remains enigmatic: thus far, carbonic
anhydrase activity has not been detected biochemically.
However, experiments in Arabidopsis have demonstrated
that expression of plant γCAs is affected by CO2 concentration (see [15]) and that plant γCA proteins bind inorganic carbon [16]. These functional observations,
coupled to the apparent restriction of γCAs to mitochondria of plant/green algal lineages, have prompted the proposal that CI γCA proteins may have plant-specific
functions; for instance, Braun & Zabaleta [17] have suggested that γCA proteins play an important role in chloroplast function via the generation of HCO3- in the
recycling of inorganic carbon for CO2 fixation.
Although γCA proteins are not components of CI in
animals and fungi (see [9]), little is known about the composition of CI in the predominantly unicellular protists.
Because protists comprise the bulk of eukaryotic diversity, it is important to characterize CI from diverse lineages in order to understand fully the evolution of this
protein complex. In particular, we cannot conclude that
supposedly lineage-specific CI subunits are truly lineagespecific without knowledge of CI composition in the
majority of eukaryotes. To this end, we have isolated an
enzymatically active, ~940-kDa native CI and an inactive,
~820-kDa CI subcomplex (CI*) from the amoeboid protist Acanthamoeba castellanii via blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and have carried
out a characterization of subunit composition via tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Here we describe the
detection of two γCA homologs, AcCa1 and AcCa2, in
both forms of Acanthamoeba CI. Acanthamoeba is a

member of the eukaryotic supergroup Amoebozoa and is
not a close relative of plants [18]; rather, available evidence indicates that Amoebozoa comprises the evolutionary sister group to the opisthokonts (animals, fungi
and their specific unicellular relatives). The unexpected
finding of γCA homologs in mitochondrial CI of Acanthamoeba demonstrates that these proteins are not limited to CI of plants/green algae, as was previously
suggested [10]. In fact, we provide evidence here that
γCA homologs having predicted mitochondrial targeting
peptides (mTPs) are widespread throughout the domain
Eucarya.

Results and Discussion
γ Carbonic anhydrase proteins in Acanthamoeba CI

An in-gel assay for NADH dehydrogenase activity was
performed on Acanthamoeba mitochondrial protein
complexes separated by BN-PAGE, yielding an insoluble
formazan precipitate at ~940 kDa (Figure 1A). This
molecular weight estimate is in agreement with the findings of Navet et al. [19] and corresponds to the general
size of CI across eukaryotes. Together, these observations
suggest that the identified NADH dehydrogenase activity
corresponds to the native, enzymatically active CI of
Acanthamoeba. Furthermore, analysis of Acanthamoeba
mitochondrial protein complexes by two-dimensional
BN/SDS-PAGE revealed another, more abundant com-

mitochondrial complexes (left) and in-gel assay of these complexes
(Acanthamoeba BN-PAGE lane from the same gel), identifying an
NADH dehydrogenase activity at ~940 kDa (right). This band is considered to represent intact CI from Acanthamoeba. Panel B shows the protein profile observed after two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE of
Acanthamoeba mitochondrial complexes resolved in panel A. A list of
proteins identified in CI and CI* isolated from BN-PAGE bands is presented in Additional File 1. CI, intact complex I (940 kDa); CI* = CI subcomplex (820 kDa); CIII, complex III; CV, complex V.

plex (CI*) of ~820 kDa that has a very similar protein profile to intact CI (Figure 1B). Based on the twodimensional BN/SDS-PAGE profile and lack of enzyme
activity following one-dimensional BN-PAGE, we infer
that this complex is likely a partially dissociated CI missing a portion of the NADH-oxidizing mitochondrial
matrix domain. The dissociation of CI into subcomplexes
during BN-PAGE is not uncommon, and the observed
breakdown into a slightly smaller, enzymatically inactive
subcomplex is reminiscent of the situation in the green
alga Polytomella [14].
Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of the 940-kDa
and 820-kDa bands demonstrated that both were
enriched in CI subunits known from other organisms,
supporting our conclusion that both represent CI (see
Additional File 1). A number of contaminating, highabundance mitochondrial proteins from other complexes
were also present; this is not unexpected, as the relative
abundance of CI is low in comparison with other complexes, and CI* appears to co-migrate with other abundant complexes (Figure 1B). Notably, two γCA homologs
were detected in both the 940-kDa and 820-kDa samples.
These proteins, here named AcCa1 and AcCa2, are 36%
identical to each other and are the only γCA homologs
represented in the Acanthamoeba TBestDB EST library
[20] and the ongoing Acanthamoeba nuclear genome
project (Baylor College of Medicine; http://
www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/microbialdetail.xsp?project_id=163). Between the two samples
analyzed by MS/MS, 31% and 47% of the AcCa1 and
AcCa2 protein sequences were covered, respectively (see
Additional File 2). These findings constitute the first
report of γCA homologs as CI components outside of the
plant/green algal lineage (see Figure 2 for multiple alignment). Based on these results, we suggest that AcCa1 and
AcCa2 are matrix-facing components of the inner membrane arm of CI in Acanthamoeba, as are their homologs
in plants/green algae [13,14].
Because not all expected CI subunits were detected in
the MS/MS analysis and because the main contaminants
of our CI proteins were ATP synthase proteins, we considered the possibility that the γCA proteins might actually be ATP synthase (CV) subunits. The enzymatically
active CI complex is present in very low abundance in A.
castellanii, so that detection of all CI subunits is proving
to be a challenge. Conversely, CV is extraordinarily abundant, as is evident in Figures 1a and 1b; as a result, MS/
MS data have revealed all CV subunits in A. castellanii,
whereas no γCA proteins were detected in this complex.
These considerations combined with the fact that γCA
proteins have been characterized as bona fide CI components in other organisms effectively eliminates the possibility that they might be CV subunits instead in
Acanthamoeba.

A small number of γCA homologs have been described
in eukaryotes outside of the plant supergroup. A cDNA
encoding a γCA homolog from the haptophyte alga Emiliania huxleyi was identified previously [21]; however the
authors did not investigate the subcellular localization of
the protein. We have previously identified three different
γCA homologs in a proteomic investigation of highly
purified mitochondria from the cilated protozoon, Tetrahymena thermophila [22]. Interestingly, two of these
three γCA homologs were detected in mass spectrometric analyses of a 1 MDa aggregate from Tetrahymena
mitochondrial membrane proteins separated by BNPAGE (Gawryluk et al., unpublished results). This aggregate is highly enriched in known protein components of
complexes I, III and V, suggesting that the identified γCA
homologs may be components of CI in Tetrahymena as
well.
From an evolutionary perspective, our findings are
somewhat surprising: the Amoebozoa supergroup (to
which Acanthamoeba belongs) is thought to be sister to
the opisthokonts (animals + fungi), and is not closely
related to the Plantae supergroup [18]. Since no authentic
γCA homologs were detected in opisthokont nuclear
genome or EST sequence databases (and no γCA
homologs are part of opisthokont CI), these results suggest that γCA proteins may have been specifically lost
from opisthokont CI, rather than recently added to the
plant/green algal lineage. Moreover, the finding that γCA
homologs may be components of CI in other eukaryotic
groups (ciliates) raises the possibility that γCA homologs
were an ancestral feature of mitochondrial CI (i.e., a component of the eukaryotic core of CI lost in animals and
fungi). We expected that if this were the case, γCA
homologs should be detected in other protist lineages.
γ Carbonic anhydrase proteins are found throughout
Eucarya

In order to better understand the distribution and evolution of γCA homologs across the domain Eucarya, we
employed a systematic bioinformatics approach to search
nuclear genomic and EST sequence databases from
diverse eukaryotes. In contrast to previous reports that
γCA proteins are largely limited to plants/green algae, we
detected (often multiple) homologs in the majority of
eukaryotic groups (Table 1; see also Additional Files 3, 4
and 5). γCA homologs are found in other major groups
within the Plantae supergroup, including one in the red
alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae and at least two in the
glaucophyte alga, Cyanophora paradoxa. Aside from the
opisthokonts, homologs could be detected in most
eukaryotic supergroups, including Amoebozoa (Acanthamoeba, Dictyostelium, Hartmannella, Hyperamoeba,
Polysphondylium), Chromalveolata (Tetrahymena, Phytophthora, Phaeodactylum, Blastocystis, Emiliania, Guil-

possibly Rhizaria (an EST homolog was idenitified in Bigelowiella natans; however, several stop codons interrupt
the reading frame, suggesting that the EST in question
may represent an incompletely spliced transcript).
Of the retrieved γCA protein sequences considered to
be complete at their N-termini (where mTPs would be
located; [23]), many are predicted to be mitochondrial by
the programs TargetP [24] and MitoProtII [25] above a
confidence level of 70%, suggesting that γCA proteins
may be targeted to mitochondria in a wide variety of
eukaryotes (see Additional File 6). Notably, several of the
known mitochondrial γCA proteins are not predicted to
have mTPs with a given program (e.g. CA3 and CAL2
from Arabidopsis, AcCa2 from Acanthamoeba and all
three γCAs from Tetrahymena with TargetP), so the lack
of an apparent mTP does not preclude a mitochondrial
localization. Genes encoding γCA proteins are absent
from the nuclear genome sequences of several eukaryotes
that do not have conventional mitochondria (e.g.
Trichomonas, Giardia) and are also absent from at least
one eukaryote (Plasmodium) that specifically lacks CI,
further suggesting that γCA proteins may be targeted to
mitochondria - and likely to CI - in most eukaryotes. Surprisingly, a γCA homolog was detected in the nuclear
genome of Entamoeba histolytica [26], an amoebozoon

that does not possess conventional mitochondria (i.e., it
lacks an electron transport chain). This homolog, however, does not appear to be closely related to other
eukaryotic γCAs, and may represent a lateral gene transfer from bacteria (data not shown).
To assess evolutionary relationships, we performed a
phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic and bacterial γCA
proteins, using the archaeal Cam sequence as outgroup.
In the resulting phylogenetic trees (not shown), virtually
all eukaryotic γCA proteins formed a large clade branching as a sister group to α-Proteobacteria (the B. natans
sequence branched within the latter clade whereas the E.
histolytica sequence mentioned above, as well as a G.
theta one, did not affiliate with the other eukaryotic γCA
sequences, but neither did they branch robustly with any
particular bacterial clade). However, these trees were
poorly resolved, with very little statistical (bootstrap)
support for most partitions, so the phylogenetic conclusions that can be drawn from them are limited. Although
the available data (Table 1) suggest an early γCA gene
duplication during eukaryotic evolution, phylogenetic
analysis was not able to delineate the point at which this
may have occurred. We can infer, however, that the duplication predated the divergence of the amoebozoan taxa
investigated here; moreover, we are able to identify the
amoebozoan sequences that are orthologous with either
AcCa1 or AcCa2 (Additional File 5).

Analysis of primary protein structure of γCA homologs

As earlier noted, plant and green algal γCA proteins constitute a CI domain that is associated with the matrix face
of the inner membrane-integrated arm [13,14]. Arabidopsis encodes five γCA homologs (CA1, CA2, CA3, CAL1
and CAL2), all of which interact with CI [27], while Chlamydomonas CI contains three different γCA homologs
[6]. Although Arabidopsis γCA1-3 (but not CAL1, CAL2)
have retained nearly all residues known to be structurally
or functionally important in the archetypal γCA (Cam)
from the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina thermophila [11], including the Zn2+- binding residues H81,
H117 and H122 [10], the function of γCA homologs in
plant mitochondria is still largely unknown. Plant γCA
proteins lack two Glu residues (D61, D84) critical to the
proton transfer mechanism of Cam and all previous
attempts to demonstrate carbonic anhydrase activity in
Arabidopsis mitochondrial extracts and in sucrose gradient-enriched plant CI [15] and recombinant γCA2
homotrimers [16] have been unsuccessful. Like the plant
homologs, Acanthamoeba γCAs lack D61 and D84;
moreover, Acanthamoeba γCAs conserve fewer of the
other residues critical to Cam function than do plant
γCAs. In terms of Zn2+-binding His residues, AcCa1 conserves only H117 whereas AcCa2 retains H81 and H122
(Figure 2). However, it should be noted that the three His
residues required to bind Zn2+ in Cam are not localized
within the same γCA monomer: rather, Zn2+ is coordinated by H81 and H122 of one monomer and H117 of a
second monomer within the trimeric Cam structure [28].
It is noteworthy that the three His residues are distrib-

uted between the two γCA homologs found in Acanthamoeba, so it may be that the latter are able to bind
Zn2+ in concert. However, in AcCa2, S and G replace N73
and Q75, respectively; in Cam, N73 and Q75 are proposed to be critical components of the catalytic mechanism [28]. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
γCA homologs of Acanthamoeba CI may not possess a
carbonic anhydrase activity. On the other hand, carbonic
anhydrase activity has been reported for a comparably
divergent, recombinant γCA from the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi [21].
As is the case with the Acanthamoeba proteins, the vast
majority of γCA proteins from eukaryotes outside of the
plant supergroup do not individually conserve all three
metal-binding His residues, although all three are often
found among different γCAs where multiple isoforms are
present. Thus, it is still unclear whether carbonic anhydrase activity or Zn2+ binding is likely to be a general feature of γCAs across eukaryotes. Interestingly, several
other positions in our phylogenetically broad multiple
alignment are fairly well conserved across eukaryotes
(and in some cases, bacteria), but not in Cam; it is possible that the conservation of these residues points to
novel, potentially important functional sites. For
instance, a His residue (corresponding to H42 of Arabidopsis γCA1) is present in 27 of the 40 eukaryotic
homologs with complete N-terminal sequence that we
identified in this study, but not in bacterial/archaeal γCA
homologs, while a Cys residue (Arabidopsis γCA1 C137)
is highly conserved in eukaryotes and bacteria (41/48),
but not in Cam (see Additional File 4). Additionally, many

Gawryluk and Gray BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:176
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/176

of the eukaryotic γCA homologs (including the Acanthamoeba ones) have C-terminal extensions relative to
their prokaryotic homologs. In land plants, these extensions have been implicated in integration into the inner
mitochondrial membrane [14], further supporting the
idea that γCA proteins may be components of CI in many
diverse eukaryotes.
Interestingly, inspection of the N-terminal portion of
γCAs from diverse eukaryotes demonstrates that there
may be, in general, at least two distinct classes of γCA
proteins. In particular, the N-terminal ~60 amino acids of
AcCa2, along with various protist γCAs, are highly similar to the corresponding region of Arabidopsis CA1-3,
whereas the N-termini of AcCa1 and Arabidopsis CAL12 are not highly conserved (Figure 3). This observation
suggests that there may be distinct roles or sub-localizations of the two classes of γCA within CI; specifically, the
high degree of conservation of the N-terminal region of
the AcCa2/CA1-3 class, but not AcCa1/CAL1-2 class,
implies that the functional constraints at protein N-termini are stronger in the former class.
Possible function(s) of γCA proteins in CI

Although in silico reconstructions of Arabidopsis γCA
proteins and comparisons to Cam suggest the possibility
of carbonic anhydrase activity, the biochemical function
of γCA homologs in plant/green algal CI is controversial
as there are currently no experimental data confirming
that plant/green algal γCA proteins are carbonic anhydrases. Recently, however, it has been shown that Arabidopsis γCA2 trimers are capable of binding inorganic
carbon [16], and microarray studies indicate that expression of Arabidopsis γCA1 and γCA2 is down-regulated
under high CO2 concentrations (see [15]). These results
suggest that γCA homologs might play an important role
in the metabolism or transport of one-carbon com-

pounds in land plants. Although these observations provide evidence that γCAs function in relation to inorganic
carbon metabolism in plants, it is still unclear whether
these observations can be generalized across eukaryotes.
As discussed above, most eukaryotes do not conserve all
three His residues required for Zn2+ coordination (and
therefore binding of CO2 and HCO3-). Consequently, it
may be that the function of γCA proteins is somewhat
different in plants and other eukaryotes, and that CI γCA
proteins in non-plant species serve a predominantly
structural role in the complex. Ultimately, in order to distinguish between these possibilities, it will be important
to determine whether or not non-plant γCA proteins are
capable of binding Zn2+.
Because CI γCA proteins were believed to be plant-specific, it has been proposed that they are involved in plantspecific processes, namely HCO3- formation (and possibly HCO3- transport across the inner mitochondrial
membrane), ultimately for CO2 fixation in chloroplasts
[17]. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that CI
γCAs play an active role in chloroplast metabolism in
plants, the presence of γCA homologs in CI of ancestrally
aplastidic eukaryotes (e.g. Acanthamoeba) demonstrates
that this could not have been the ancestral role of γCAs in
CI, and that these proteins must perform some role that
is not related to chloroplast function. Other data suggest
that γCA proteins in plants may play a role in expression
and assembly of mitochondrial CI. For instance, it was
demonstrated that total levels of CI, along with abundance of CI+CIII supercomplexes, are dramatically
decreased (>80%) in Arabidopsis γCA2 and γCA3 knockout lines grown in suspension culture [15]. A reduction in
total CI protein was detected (i.e., not just aberrant CI
assembly), suggesting that γCA proteins play an important role in the expression/stability of CI subunits.

Recently, Tripp et al. [29] demonstrated that the active
site of Cam contains Fe2+ instead of Zn2+ when the
enzyme is reconstituted under anaerobic conditions. As
noted by Parisi et al. [10], CI (along with the rest of the
respiratory chain) contains multiple iron centers, so the
Fe-binding ability of Cam may point to a role for γCA
proteins in mitochondrial respiratory control. Notably,
Arabidopsis γCA2, a physical component of CI, has been
annotated as a transcription factor involved in the
anther-specific expression of nucleus-encoded CI proteins (see GenBank accession no. AAK28403). The prospect that γCA proteins may function as CI-specific
transcription factors is quite intriguing, as it would suggest a novel mechanism of communication between the
mitochondrial electron transport chain and the nucleus,
and would indicate a function for CI γCA proteins that
could be applicable across all aerobic CI-containing
eukaryotes, and not just photosynthetic ones.

Conclusions
The number of subunits comprising CI in eukaryotes has
expanded markedly relative to the homologous bacterial
complex. Previous comparative genomic analyses have
suggested that 18 proteins were added to CI very early in
eukaryotic evolution, while a smaller proportion are specific to particular lineages within the eukaryotic domain
[9]. Although a number of the novel, 'lineage-specific'
proteins are likely to be encoded by a phylogenetically
restricted group of related organisms, others are currently deemed to be 'lineage-specific' only because our
knowledge of CI composition across the eukaryotes is
incomplete. We have detected two γCA homologs - previously thought to be plant/green algal CI proteins - as
components of CI in an amoeboid protozoon, Acanthamoeba castellanii, an organism not specifically related
to the plant/green algal lineage. The most parsimonious
interpretation of our observations is that γCA proteins
were part of the eukaryotic core of CI that was added
early in eukaryotic evolution, and that they were subsequently lost in certain groups, most notably the opisthokonts. Moreover, γCA proteins are known to be
mitochondrial in ciliates (and may be CI proteins as well)
and bioinformatics searches have revealed a large repertoire of γCA homologs in other major eukaryotic groups.
These observations underscore the importance of characterizing the composition of mitochondrial protein complexes from a wide variety of organisms in order to
understand fully and accurately their function and evolution.
Methods
Cell Growth and Isolation of Mitochondria

Mitochondria were prepared from two 500-ml cultures of
Acanthamoeba castellanii (strain Neff ) cells grown to an

Page 8 of 11

OD580 of ~1.0, essentially as reported by Lohan and Gray
[30]. The present method differed in that cells were not
washed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis, the
crude mitochondrial pellet was washed only once with
mitochondrial wash buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl, 10 mM
Na2EDTA, 0.35 M sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.1%
BSA) and mitochondria were purified in a SW27Ti rotor
centrifuged at 22,000 rpm. The protein concentration
was assayed with the BioRad DC Protein Assay kit and
whole mitochondria were diluted to a final protein concentration of 25 mg/ml.
Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)

BN-PAGE was carried out according to Schägger and von
Jagow [31]. A 4-μl aliquot of purified mitochondrial fraction (corresponding to 100 μg protein) was solubilized
with 40 μl of a solution containing 0.5% n-dodecyl-β-Dmaltoside in 750 mM 6-aminocaproic acid/50 mM bistris
[bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino-tris(hydroxymethyl)methane] for 15 min on ice. The solution was centrifuged
at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C in order to sediment insoluble material. The supernatant was supplemented with
1.5 μl 5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 in 750 mM 6aminocaproic acid/50 mM bis-tris and 5.0 μl 50% (v:v)
glycerol. Samples were loaded onto a 1.5-mm thick, 412% polyacrylamide linear gradient gel without a stacking
gel and electrophoresed for 2 hr at 150 V, 2 hr at 350 V
and ~5 hr at 500 V at 4°C. Gels were either a) stained with
a solution of 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, 40%
ethanol, 10% acetic acid or b) gel lanes were excised for
in-gel enzyme activity assays or two-dimensional BN/
SDS-PAGE. Molecular weights were estimated using the
NativeMark unstained protein standard (Invitrogen).
In-gel Enzyme Activity Assay

In order to identify enzymatically active CI, in-gel activity
assays were performed. A lane from a BN-PAGE experiment was excised and incubated overnight in 5 ml 50 mM
MOPS·NaOH, pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml
reduced β-NADH and 1 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium.
Active CI was identified by the formation of a purple-blue
formazan precipitate at approximately 940 kDa.
Two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE

After one-dimensional BN-PAGE, a gel strip was excised
and treated for 45 min with 10 ml of a 0.125 M Tris·HCl
buffer, pH 6.8 (1× SDS-PAGE stacking buffer), containing
2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The strip was incubated for 10 min in 10 ml of the
same solution, minus β-mercaptoethanol (a potent inhibitor of polymerization). The BN gel strip was encased in
4% SDS-PAGE stacking gel poured on top of a 15%
resolving gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at room
temperature at a constant current of 30 mA for approxi-

mately 6 hr. The gel was stained with the BioRad Silver
Stain Plus kit according to manufacturer's protocols.
Reversed-phase HPLC and MS/MS

The enzymatically active CI and inactive CI complexes
were excised and each was placed in a separate microcentrifuge tube. The proteins were reduced with 10 mM
dithiothreitol in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AB)
for 30 min at 56°C and alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM AB for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Proteins were incubated with trypsin overnight
(~16 hr) at 37°C with 12.5 ng/μl modified porcine trypsin
(Promega) in 100 mM AB. Peptides were extracted once
with 100 mM AB and twice with a 50:50 (v:v) acetonitrile:H2O solution containing 0.2% formic acid. All
samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an Agilent
1100 HPLC system equipped with a 15 cm × 100 mm
Onyx Monolythic C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance,
California). The separation was carried out using the following gradient: 2% B for 3 min increasing to 25% B over
45 min and 95% B over 10 min (A: 0.1% formic acid in
water; B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at 2 μl/min. The
HPLC was interfaced to an AB/MDS-SCIEX QTrap 4000
mass spectrometer via a nanoflow source. Data were
acquired in the information-dependent acquisition mode,
i.e., the m/z values of the tryptic peptides were measured
using an MS scan, followed by enhanced resolution scans
of the three most intense peaks and finally three tandem
MS scans. The tandem MS spectra were submitted to the
database search program MASCOT [32] in order to identify the proteins. Data files were searched against A. castellanii EST clusters from TBestDB [20], a collection of
Acanthamoeba ESTs generated by 454 pyrosequencing
(kindly made available by BJ Loftus, University College
Dublin), the current nuclear genome assembly (A. castellanii genome project), and the A. castellanii mitochondrial genome sequence [33]. The current A. castellanii
genome assembly and Loftus EST data set are both publicly available from the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine http://www.hgsc.
bcm.tmc.edu/projects/microbial/microbial-pubPreview.
xsp?project_id=163.
Homology searches, alignments, mTP prediction

The amino acid sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana γCA1
(AT1G5980) was used to query the nr protein database at
NCBI with BLASTp, as well as EST and nuclear genome
databases from a wide variety of eukaryotes with
tBLASTn [34]. Nucleic acid sequences were translated
using the transeq program of the EMBOSS package and
protein sequences were inferred manually. Protein
homologs were aligned with Muscle v3.6 [35] using
default parameters and edited with the BioEdit Sequence
Alignment Editor.

Page 9 of 11

TargetP [24] and MitoProt II [25] were used to assess
the probability of mitochondrial localization for eukaryotic γCA homologs. When TargetP was used, the 'Plant'
organism group was selected for organisms with primary
or secondary plastids in order to include the possibility of
plastid-targeted γCA proteins; for species lacking a plastid, the 'Animal' organism group was selected. MitoProt II
does not have an option for assessing plastid localization.
Phylogenetic analysis

The AcCa1 protein sequence was used to query the nr
database at NCBI via BLASTp. The best scoring
homologs (i.e., ones having the lowest E- values) from a
variety of major bacterial groups were retrieved and
aligned with eukaryotic γ-type CA homologs using Muscle v.3.6 [35]. The alignment was edited manually with
eBioX and was then used to reconstruct the maximum
likelihood phylogenetic tree using RAxML-HPC [36]
under the WAG + Γ model (using the PROTGAMMAWAGF option) with 25 categories of substitution rate
variation. One hundred bootstrap replicates were performed as a measure of statistical support for inferred
nodes.

List of abbreviations
CI: complex I of the respiratory chain; γCA: γ-type carbonic anhydrase; Cam: archetypal γCA from Methanosarcina thermophila; AcCa1 and AcCa2: names given
to γ-type carbonic anhydrases from Acanthamoeba;
NADH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced);
BN-PAGE: blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; mTP: mitochondrial targeting peptide; EST:
expressed sequence tag; ETC: electron transport chain
Additional material
Additional File 1 Table of CI and CI* proteins identified by tandem
mass spectrometry. The table lists proteins identified in the 940 kDa (CI)
and 820 kDa (CI*) complexes via MASCOT searches of a six-frame translation
of a 454 EST database (N) and predicted proteins from the Acanthamoeba
mitochondrial genome (M). Proteins with ion scores of 37 and above are
reported from the 454 EST database while ion scores of 29 or higher are
reported for inferred mtDNA-encoded proteins. Bolded entries highlighted
in color indicate that the protein in question was identified in both CI and
CI* complexes. The two categories designated 'Other Proteins' are assumed
to be contaminants; in particular, CV components (ATP synthase subunits)
appear to be exceptionally abundant mitochondrial proteins, as judged by
the results of MS/MS analysis of whole mitochondria.
Additional File 2 MS/MS peptide coverage. The peptides identified by
MS/MS analysis in AcCa1 and AcCa2 are mapped onto the corresponding
protein sequences. Each peptide is colour-coded according to whether it
was identified only in the 940 kDa CI, only the 820 kDa CI*, or in both samples.
Additional File 3 Sequences of γCA proteins. The inferred protein
sequences of γCA proteins are reported in fasta format. Proteins are designated as indicated in Additional File 5.
Additional File 4 Phylogenetically broad alignment of eukaryotic and
prokaryotic γCAs.: A multiple alignment of eukaryotic and prokaryotic
γCAs including complete and partial sequences from diverse eukaryotic
groups.
