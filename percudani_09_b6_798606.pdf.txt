Abstract
Background: Enzymes that depend on vitamin B6 (and in particular on its metabolically active
form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, PLP) are of great relevance to biology and medicine, as they catalyze
a wide variety of biochemical reactions mainly involving amino acid substrates. Although PLPdependent enzymes belong to a small number of independent evolutionary lineages, they
encompass more than 160 distinct catalytic functions, thus representing a striking example of
divergent evolution. The importance and remarkable versatility of these enzymes, as well as the
difficulties in their functional classification, create a need for an integrated source of information
about them.
Description: The B6 database http://bioinformatics.unipr.it/B6db contains documented B6dependent activities and the relevant protein families, defined as monophyletic groups of sequences
possessing the same enzymatic function. One or more families were associated to each of 121 PLPdependent activities with known sequences. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were built from family
alignments and incorporated in the database. These HMMs can be used for the functional
classification of PLP-dependent enzymes in genomic sets of predicted protein sequences. An
example of such analyses (a census of human genes coding for PLP-dependent enzymes) is provided
here, whereas many more are accessible through the database itself.
Conclusion: The B6 database is a curated repository of biochemical and molecular information
about an important group of enzymes. This information is logically organized and available for
computational analyses, providing a key resource for the identification, classification and
comparative analysis of B6-dependent enzymes.

Background
The term 'vitamin B6' refers to a collective of six biologically interconvertible 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine compounds: pyridoxal, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, and their
respective 5'-phosphates. Among these, pyridoxal 5'phosphate (PLP) is the main metabolically active form,

serving as a cofactor for a variety of enzymes in all organisms [1-7].
Nearly all PLP-dependent enzymes, with the exception of
glycogen phosphorylases, are associated with biochemical
pathways involving amino compounds - mostly amino
acids. The reactions catalyzed by the PLP-dependent

enzymes that act on amino acids include transamination,
decarboxylation, racemization, and eliminations or
replacements at the β- or γ-carbons. Such versatility arises
from the fact that PLP can covalently bind the substrate
and then act as an electrophilic catalyst, stabilizing different types of carbanionic reaction intermediates [7]
(Figure 1).

represents a remarkable example of divergent evolution,
meaning that proteins with similar structure and sequence
can perform different chemical reactions. Due to the
mechanistic similarities between PLP-dependent enzymes
and to their limited structural diversity, inferring the function of these catalysts solely based on sequence similarity
entails particular difficulties.

The
Enzyme
Commission
(EC;
http://
www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/) lists more than
140 PLP-dependent activities, corresponding to ~4% of all
classified activities [6]. Despite this wide functional variety, all structurally characterized PLP-dependent enzymes
have been classified into just five distinct structural groups
(also known as 'fold types') [4,8], which presumably correspond to independent evolutionary lineages [3,5]. This

To help the identification and classification of sequences
belonging to PLP-dependent enzymes, we have created
the B6 database. In addition to a wealth of links to other
Internet resources (including BRENDA [9] and the PLP
mutant enzyme database[10]), the B6 database contains
over 180 documented PLP-dependent activities that are
associated, when possible, to one or more protein families
(defined as monophyletic groups of homologous proteins
sharing the same function). The database also contains
hidden Markov models (HMMs) that were built from
family alignments and that can be employed for the identification and functional classification of PLP-dependent
enzymes in genomic sets of protein sequences. Indeed, we
have used these HMMs to scan a series of complete
genomes, obtaining a census of predicted PLP-dependent
enzymes in various organisms.

PLP-dependent enzymes that act reaction acids
A schematic view of the different reaction types catalyzed by PLP-dependent enzymes that act on amino
acids. In these enzymes, PLP is bound to the ε-amino group
of a catalytic lysine residue, forming a Schiff base (internal
aldimine). Covalent binding of the substrate amino acid
occurs through a transimination reaction, leading to formation of an external aldimine intermediate (structure on the
upper left corner). Subsequently, the protonated ring system
of PLP acts as an electron sink, to stabilize species carrying a
negative charge on the α-carbon (carbanions). Depending on
the enzyme (and hence on the specific arrangement of the
active site residues) such stabilized carbanions can be formed
upon cleavage of any of the three covalent bonds connecting
the α-carbon to its substituents. Removal of the carboxylate
group is typical of decarboxylases. Removal of the amino acid
side chain occurs for example in threonine aldolase. Finally,
removal of the α-proton may be the prequel to the formation of various further intermediates, leading to racemization,
cyclization, β- and γ-elimination, and transamination reactions [1,4,7].

Construction and content
Organization and statistics of the B6 database
Figure 2 summarizes the structure of the database, illustrating the types of information it includes and the ways
in which this information is linked together and can be
searched. As shown, the B6 database site actually accesses
and integrates four distinct databases, namely a list of
PLP-dependent activities, a collection of pertinent literature references, a large set of sequences of PLP-dependent
proteins (grouped into protein families) and the results of
our genomic searches.

The B6 database release 1.0 (as of 15/05/2009) includes
184 activities and over 2000 sequences of B6-dependent
enzymes, subdivided into 149 families. For each family,
the database provides a multiple sequence alignment and
the derived hidden Markov model.
Assembly of the databases: activities, sequences and
protein families
The B6 database was constructed based on an inventory of
documented B6-dependent activities, most but not all of
which have been catalogued by the Enzyme Commission
and are therefore associated to an official EC number. A
systematic examination of the literature showed that 121
of these activities could be associated to enzymes of
known sequences, and in these cases we proceeded to the
creation of protein families, that we define as monophyletic groups of sequences all possessing the same enzymatic activity. Each given activity was associated to one or
more families based on this criterion.

The number of sequences in individual families was then
increased by homology searches, i.e. by scanning the GenBank with BLAST [11] or with psi-BLAST [12], using as
query the functionally validated protein(s). Criteria for
inclusion of a sequence in a family were the following:
(1) Only sequences yielding an E value < 10-10 were generally considered (this limit could be somewhat lowered
for families composed of short sequences).
(2) Sequences showing a >90% identity to a protein of
known function were usually not included, to diminish
redundancy.
(3) Sequences being substantially (>30%) shorter than
the shortest functionally validated sequence in the family
were discarded. Sequences lacking the PLP-binding lysine
residue were also discarded (except for rare cases in which
the protein is known not to bind PLP via a lysine).
(4) Sequences showing a higher similarity to other characterized PLP-dependent enzymes (i.e., to some functionally validated protein belonging to another family) were
discarded.
(5) Finally, sequences from taxa in which the enzymatic
activity of the family was not documented, were also generally discarded.
Multiple alignments were constructed with ClustalW [13].
Given that the families were composed of closely related
sequences, these alignments did not need to be manually
adjusted or to be guided by structural information (even
when available).

Figure 2
The B6 database relational structure
The B6 database relational structure. This figure delineates the four modules composing the database and their relationships. The database of PLP-dependent enzyme families
was assembled based on the examination of the literature
and on a collection of functionally validated sequences, as
described in the text. These families, and in particular the
HMMs associated to them, have been used for the identification and functional classification of PLP-dependent enzymes
in sets of predicted protein sequences from whole genomes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/273

The ProDom program [14] was used for alignment inspection and phylogenetic analysis. Family alignments were
used to build Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with programs of the HMMER suite [15]. The scores of sequences
included or excluded from a given family were then calculated with respect to the family HMM. From this procedure, score cut-offs for each family were determined and
then used for sequence classification.
A family HMM is a probabilistic model, constructed from
a multiple alignment, which describes the sequence conservation within a protein family. In comparison to consensus sequences or similar regular expressions, HMMs
provide a more articulated modeling of the features of a
protein family. Such higher complexity is responsible for
the greater discriminatory power of the HMM methodology in the identification of other putative family members
[15]. Depending on family inclusion criteria and score
thresholds, HMMs can be used to identify homology at
different levels of granularity. The 'family' definition
adopted in the B6 database is similar to the 'equivalog
family' definition of TIGRFAM [16], while a single family
in PFAM [17] typically corresponds to many different
families in our database.
Cluster analysis of PLP-dependent enzyme families
To elucidate the relationships between the 149 enzyme
families defined as above, we performed an all versus all
comparison of the families in the database using an
HMM-HMM alignment software [18]. The results of this
comparison were analyzed with an interaction network
software [19] to build an homology-based network of
PLP-dependent families (Figure 3). By considering only
significant similarities (E < 10-5) between HMMs, the
analysis identified seven separated clusters of PLPdependent families (Figure 3). Five of these clusters corresponded to the traditional classification of PLP-dependent enzymes into five distinct structural groups (fold types
I to V). Of the two additional clusters, one included lysine
5,6-aminomutase (EC: 5.4.3.4) and the other lysine 2,3aminomutase (EC: 5.4.3.2) - two enzymes whose structures have been recently determined and found to be different from the known structures of PLP-dependent
enzymes [20,21]. In the database, the protein families
belonging to these two clusters were assigned, respectively, to fold types VI and VII.

Since HMM-HMM comparison is very sensitive to
sequence similarity, it can reveal faint evolutionary relationships between protein families. This information can
be particularly useful to identify relatives for PLP-dependent families that fail to reveal similarity with other families when analyzed by sequence-sequence (e.g., Blast) or
sequence-HMM (e.g. HMMPFAM) methods. The HMMHMM analysis, for example, indicates a significant similarity between Prosc (a family of proteins with unknown

function) and diaminopimelate decarboxylase (EC:
4.1.1.20) - a relationship that is not apparent through
Blast or HMMPFAM comparisons.
Inter-families distances deriving from HMM-HMM comparisons served as a guide to build alignments representative of the seven distinct structural groups. Distance
matrices among families were analyzed with an UPGMA
algorithm and a rapid multiple sequence alignment
method [22] was used to progressively align PLP-dependent families belonging to the same structural type. From
these alignments, we constructed HMMs (hereafter
named "fold-type HMMs") representative of the seven
structural groups of PLP-dependent enzymes.

Utility and discussion
The B6 database is a repository in which detailed (biochemical and genetic) information about an important
group of enzymes is concentrated, organized and made
available for computational analyses. We expect that the
B6 database will be a valuable tool for experimental
researchers in the PLP field, but also a reference point for
the design of theoretical studies by bioinformaticians.
In particular, the sequence information accumulated in
the database can be used to facilitate the identification
and functional assignment of B6-dependent enzymes. To
illustrate this point, we employed the family and fold-type
HMMs (constructed as described above) to search and
preliminarily classify PLP-dependent enzymes in genomic
sets of predicted proteins. The results of such analyses
have also been incorporated in the database.
Complete sets of protein sequences deduced from
genomic data were generally obtained from NCBI ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes or from similar ftp repositories.
The classification of protein sequences was achieved
through a two-step procedure. First, each sequence was
compared with our database of PLP-dependent sequences
by performing a HMM search with the seven fold-type
HMMs, using relaxed significance criteria (E ≤ 10-1; database size = 10000). This step served as a quick filter to sift
out genes that were likely to code for PLP-dependent
enzymes. Candidates were subsequently compared with
the library of family HMMs using HMMPFAM. This step
was more time-consuming and served for a preliminary
functional classification of the proteins.
A protein was considered to possess the same activity as its
best-hit family if it exhibited a significant similarity to the
family HMM (E ≤ 10-3) and a score above a 'trusted' cutoff established by the family curator. Sequences with a
score below this threshold were marked as 'low-score' to
indicate their modest similarity to the family model.
These sequences were not considered as possessing the
enzymatic function of the family, but were regarded as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/273

possessing an uncharacterized, possibly related, activity.
According to this analysis, very few sequences exhibited a
significant similarity to a fold-type HMM (E ≤ 10-3) but no
significant similarity to any family HMMs. In such cases,
sequences were considered as potential PLP-dependent
enzymes with an uncharacterized catalytic activity.
To further characterize the protein sequence under examination, the classification program searched for a putative
PLP-binding lysine residue (see legend of Figure 1). This
was achieved by aligning the sequence with validated family members in which the position of the catalytic lysine
had been previously mapped. This analysis can reveal proteins that are evolutionary related to PLP-dependent
enzymes, but have lost the ability to bind the PLP cofactor.
Example: a census of human genes that encode
PLP-dependent enzymes
By employing the approach outlined above, we searched
the latest draft of the human genome (NCBI 36 assembly,
downloaded at ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/) to obtain an
inventory of the human genes coding for PLP-dependent
enzymes. The initial output of the program (69 sequences
recognized as probable PLP-dependent proteins) was further analyzed to identify pseudogenes, false positives and
entries representing alternative protein isoforms.

The search identified 56 expressed genes coding for PLPdependent proteins (Table 1. Note that the products of
genes SPTLC1, ADC and AZIN1, albeit homologs of bona
fide PLP-dependent enzymes, appear to have acquired a
nonenzymic function during evolution). Thirteen more
proteins were recognized as isoforms deriving from some
of the genes above. To appreciate the rate of false negatives
in our analysis, we performed an extensive text search in
the GenBank database of human genes, to identify all
those genes annotated (directly or indirectly) to code for
B6-dependent proteins. However, we found no hits other
than the 56 genes listed in Table 1, which therefore represent, to the best of our current knowledge, the complement of human PLP-dependent genes.
We also compared the functional classification provided
by the B6 database with the manual annotation included
in the NCBI 36 release of the human genome, finding no
significant differences. This implies that the accuracy of
our automatic classification system can match that of a
manual expert annotation. It should be noted that only a
minority of complete genomes have been subjected to
accurate manual annotation. In genomes where proteins
have been mostly annotated through a general system of
automatic annotation, our specialized tool provides a
more complete and accurate classification of PLP-dependent enzymes.

The complete set of proteins from the NCBI 36 assembly of the human genome was searched as described in the text. The 'Family' column reports
the name of the family whose HMM scored best when compared to the query. When possible, the family name is constituted by, or includes, the
four-digits EC number of the corresponding activity. Note that the layout of the present table recapitulates the output provided by B6 database's
site, with some modifications. In particular, the occurrence of protein isoforms derived from some genes was obtained by analysis of the crude
program results. The official names of the genes corresponding to the transcripts and their chromosomal locations were obtained from NCBI.
(a) This gene encodes the subunit LCB1 of human serine palmitoyltransferase. This subunit is not itself a PLP-dependent enzyme, but is homologous
to a second subunit (LCB2) that is PLP-dependent [24].
(b) The products of genes AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 are homologs of the mitochondrial alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT2), but were
recently shown to lack this activity [25].
(c) The murine homolog of this gene was shown to encode an enzyme with phospho-lyase activity [26].
(d) This gene is homolog to the plant 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase, but the gene product was shown to lack this activity
[27].
(e) Genes ADC and AZIN1 encode ornithine decarboxylase antizyme inhibitors, i.e. proteins homologous to ornithine decarboxylase, but devoid of
ornithine decarboxylase activity, that are involved in regulation of polyamine biosynthesis [28,29]. The human ADC, contrary to its mouse ortholog,
retains a conserved lysine at the active site.

Of course, accuracy in the annotation of a gene product
does not always guarantee a precise functional assignment, as it can be gleaned by inspecting Table 1. For example, some of the human PLP-dependent proteins in our
inventory are homologs of enzymes (such as plant ACS
synthases or bacterial threonine synthases) that are not
expected to occur in mammals. In other cases, the proteins
are homologs of other (functionally validated) human
enzymes, but it is unclear whether they represent true isozymic forms, or rather possess distinct catalytic activities this latter possibility may be especially pertinent for those
sequences that were recognized as 'low-score' by our
search procedure. These uncharacterized gene products
represent therefore interesting subjects for functional
genomic studies.

cation but also helping to pinpoint gene products that are
the most interesting candidates to functional studies.
Due to the progresses of functional genomics, as well as to
classical biochemical and genetic approaches, the body of
information on PLP-dependent enzymes is necessarily
going to increase. Many activities that are currently
'orphan' (i.e., with no molecular details about the responsible enzymes) will be associated to specific sequences,
while many new activities are likely to be discovered [6].
Accordingly, we expect to periodically update and expand
the B6 database with the ensuing information, to maintain this database a serviceable tool and a reference point
for the scientific community.

Availability and requirements
Some genes encoding for PLP-dependent enzymes may be
missing from the list, possibly due to the limits of the current human genome assembly, even eight years after publication of the first genome draft [23]. For example, the
gene ACCSL has been recognized as protein-coding only
in the NCBI 36 assembly but was absent in the preceding
version (NCBI 35).

The B6 database, which is based on the web-oriented Perl
package Woda, is publicly available over the Internet
http://bioinformatics.unipr.it/B6db. Users are asked to

Conclusion
The increasing number of predicted protein sequences
generated by genomic sequencing projects require methods to predict details regarding functions. The B6 database
allows the comparison of newly sequenced PLP-dependent proteins with a curated collection of protein families,
making it more reliable a preliminary functional classifi-
