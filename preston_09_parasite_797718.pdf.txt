Abstract
Background: Sleep is a biological enigma. Despite occupying much of an animal's life, and having
been scrutinized by numerous experimental studies, there is still no consensus on its function.
Similarly, no hypothesis has yet explained why species have evolved such marked variation in their
sleep requirements (from 3 to 20 hours a day in mammals). One intriguing but untested idea is that
sleep has evolved by playing an important role in protecting animals from parasitic infection. This
theory stems, in part, from clinical observations of intimate physiological links between sleep and
the immune system. Here, we test this hypothesis by conducting comparative analyses of
mammalian sleep, immune system parameters, and parasitism.
Results: We found that evolutionary increases in mammalian sleep durations are strongly
associated with an enhancement of immune defences as measured by the number of immune cells
circulating in peripheral blood. This appeared to be a generalized relationship that could be
independently detected in 4 of the 5 immune cell types and in both of the main sleep phases.
Importantly, no comparable relationships occur in related physiological systems that do not serve
an immune function. Consistent with an influence of sleep on immune investment, mammalian
species that sleep for longer periods also had substantially reduced levels of parasitic infection.
Conclusion: These relationships suggest that parasite resistance has played an important role in
the evolution of mammalian sleep. Species that have evolved longer sleep durations appear to be
able to increase investment in their immune systems and be better protected from parasites. These
results are neither predicted nor explained by conventional theories of sleep evolution, and suggest
that sleep has a much wider role in disease resistance than is currently appreciated.

Background
All mammals studied exhibit some form of sleep, yet the
adaptive value of sleeping remains obscure [1]. When
viewed from this evolutionary perspective, the time spent
in this state of reduced environmental awareness and

behavioural quiescence is likely to be costly in terms of
predation risk [2-4], competition for resources [2,4,5],
and reproductive opportunities [6]. To outweigh these
costs, the benefits of sleep must be substantial.

A wide range of hypotheses have been proposed to
explain why this seemingly vulnerable and unproductive
state has evolved, including suggestions that sleep conserves energy when alternative activities would bring little
advantage [7], is required for the consolidation of memories and learning [8], or plays a role in brain development
or repair [9,10]. However, phylogenetically controlled
analyses investigating the evolution of mammalian sleep
durations have produced mixed support for these explanations [3-5], leaving the evolutionary significance of
mammalian sleep a mystery.
A further idea that has yet to be tested is that sleep evolved
through the need to augment immune defences and protect against disease [11-13]. It is increasingly recognized
that the immune system is energetically costly, as evidenced by its impairment under conditions of nutritional
stress and when resources are diverted to increased growth
or reproductive activity [14]. Since sleep is an enforced
period of inactivity and physiological down-regulation,
energy that will otherwise be expended during waking
activity would be available to meet the demands of the
immune system [7,13,15].
This immune theory of sleep is supported by clinical studies that provide evidence of an intimate physiological link
between sleep and the immune system. For example,
mammals spend more time asleep, and particularly in
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, when infected
with a range of parasitic agents (e.g. influenza [16],
Escherichia coli [13], and Candida albicans [13]). Immunomodulatory cytokines – the signalling molecules of the
immune system – play a role in both the normal regulation of sleep and its modulation during an immune
response [17]. Direct evidence of a role for sleep in immunocompetence is provided by studies showing that rabbits
that sleep more following infection have an increased
chance of recovery [18], and rats that are totally sleep
deprived die with a systemic invasion of bacteria [12].
Finally, the human antibody responses to vaccination can
be halved when subjects are deprived of sleep either
before or after vaccination [19,20]. While the numerous
other physiological changes accompanying sleep deprivation or infection make it impossible to isolate sleep per se
as a causal factor in experiments [17,21-23], when taken
together these studies highlight the potential importance
of disease resistance in the evolution of sleep.
Here, we assess the evolutionary relationship between
sleep and immunocompetence across a wide range of
mammalian species by examining the extensive variation
in sleep times (between 3 and 20 hours a day [1]; Figure
1), investment in immune defences, and parasitic infections.

Results and Discussion
We first assessed the influence of sleep on the immune
system. To do so we extracted data on sleeping times for
different mammalian species from the published literature and matched these data where possible with white
blood cell counts reported by the International Species
Information System (ISIS [24]; [see Additional File 1]).
We use white blood cells as a proxy for immune system
investment as they are central to all immune responses
and are a measure of immunocompetence [25,26]. White
blood cells originate in bone marrow and are derived
from the same hematopoietic stem cells that produce red
blood cells and platelets [25]. As these latter cells have no
direct immunological function, we use them as natural
controls to test the specificity of any relationship between
sleep and the immune system. If a key selective advantage
of sleep is that it allows greater investment in the immune
system, then species that sleep for longer should have
increased numbers of immune cells in circulation, but
there should be no similar relationship with control cells.
After matching species values from each database we were
able to analyze data for 26 mammalian species while controlling for confounding factors (body size and activity
period; see the Methods for details).
As expected if sleep enhances immune defences, species
that engaged in more sleep had higher numbers of white
blood cells circulating in peripheral blood (coefficient =
0.00976, s.e. = 0.00171, t22 = 5.71, P < 0.001; Figure 2a).
Across our dataset, a 14 hour increase in sleeping times
corresponded to an additional 30 million white blood
cells in each millilitre of blood (a 615% increase). Crucially, no similar patterns were evident with either red
blood cells or platelets (red blood cells: coefficient = 0.028, s.e. = 0.113, t24 = -0.24, P > 0.8, platelets: coefficient
= -0.00602, s.e. = 0.00576, t21 = -1.04, P > 0.3).
We also tested predictions using phylogenetically independent contrasts to account for the lack of statistical
independence in species data [27]. These analyses examine evolutionary change and showed that when lineages
evolved longer sleep durations, they also increased their
white blood cell counts (coefficient = 0.0153, s.e. =
0.00250, t23 = 6.11, P < 0.001). Again, this relationship
was specific to immune cells (for red blood cells: coefficient = -0.200, s.e. = 0.0123, t23 = -1.63, P > 0.11, for platelets: coefficient = -0.00463, s.e. = 0.00628, t21 = -0.74, P >
0.45), leading to an increase in the ratio of immune cells
to other blood cell types when species evolved longer
sleeping durations (coefficient = 0.0639, s.e. = 0.0108, t20
= 5.93, P < 0.001).
Total white blood cell counts are a compound measure of
the abundance of different cell types, each of which fulfils
specialized immunological roles [25]. We therefore also

investigated whether the correlated evolution of sleep and
white blood cell counts was limited to specific cell types.
Neutrophils constitute the largest component of the
innate immune system, representing 47% of white blood
cells in our sample, and are seen as a first line of defence

that responds rapidly upon detection of invading pathogens [25]. Analysis of independent contrasts indicated
that higher numbers of neutrophils in the bloodstream
have evolved in association with elevated sleep durations
(bootstrapped coefficient = 0.0948, s.e. = 0.0223, n = 25,

durations occurred (bootstrapped coefficient = 0.0103,
s.e. = 0.00385, n = 25, P = 0.004). Finally, eosinophils and
basophils, which are relatively minor components of the
white blood cell count (5% and 1%, respectively) and act
primarily against macroparasites [25], showed the predicted association with sleep (eosinophils: bootstrapped
coefficient = 0.0246, s.e. = 0.0125, n = 25, P < 0.035;
basophils: coefficient = 0.0676, s.e. = 0.0198, t24 = 3.42,
P = 0.002). Only monocytes, accounting for 5% of the
total white cell count [25], failed to show a significant
association with sleep durations (bootstrapped coefficient
= 0.0478, s.e. = 0.0323, n = 25, P > 0.14). Thus, evolutionary increases in the abundance of four of the five immune
cell types have occurred in association with longer sleep
times, suggesting that increased sleep may allow a generalized heightening of immune defences.
Next, we addressed hypotheses regarding the role of the
two main sleep stages (NREM and REM) in immune system investment. In clinical studies, increased duration
and intensity of NREM sleep during illness are associated
with an improved prognosis, but occur at the expense of
REM sleep [11,13,18]. From this, it is argued that immunological benefits of sleep occur while brain function is
down-regulated during the NREM phase [11,22]. Our
results did not support this suggestion, however, as we
found that evolutionary increases in both NREM and REM
sleep occur in parallel with elevated white blood cell
counts (NREM: coefficient = 0.0853, s.e. = 0.0249, t17 =
3.42; P = 0.003; REM: bootstrapped coefficient = 0.0633,
s.e. = 0.0112, n = 19, P < 0.001). Thus, evolutionary
increases in sleep are associated with increased investment
in the immune system regardless of its specific form.

P < 0.001). Lymphocytes, which account for 44% of the
white cell count in our sample and are mediators of the
acquired immune response [25], were also present in
greater numbers when evolutionary increases in sleeping

Finally, we assessed whether a role for sleep in enhancing
immune defences could translate into improved resistance against parasitic infections. We were able to match
sleep times with parasitism for 12 mammalian species
from the Global Mammal Parasite Database [28], which
details the diversity and prevalence of microparasites
(viruses, bacteria and fungi) and macroparasites
(helminths, protozoa and arthropods) that infect wild
populations of mammals [see Additional File 1]. If sleep
is effective in protecting against infection, then species
that engage in more sleep should have fewer parasites
(measured as a combination of species richness and prevalence, see Methods). After correcting for differences arising from sampling effort [29-31], we found this predicted
relationship (coefficient = -3.554, s.e. = 0.888, t10 = -4.00,
P = 0.003; Figure 2b). This analysis suggests that across the
10 hour range of sleep durations present in the dataset
there is a 24-fold decline in levels of parasitism. A significant negative relationship was also evident in analyses of
independent contrasts (bootstrapped coefficient = -3.48,
s.e. = 1.51, n = 11, P = 0.006). Thus, as species evolved

longer sleep durations and enhanced their immune systems, they become less parasitized.
Our results are consistent with parasite resistance having
played an important role in the evolution of sleep, and
suggest therefore that sleep is of greater immunological
significance than is currently recognized. It had been
noted that the physiological links between sleep and
immunity that have been highlighted by experimental
studies (e.g. in rats [12]) could arise from a negative
impact of sleep deprivation on the brain, leading to an
impaired coordination of immune system activity
[11,17]. However, our findings reveal strong relationships
between sleep and immune defences in the absence of
sleep deprivation, and thus point to a more direct constitutive role for sleep in promoting immunocompetence.
We suggest that sleep fuels the immune system. While
awake, animals must be ready to meet multiple demands
on a limited energy supply, including the need to search
for food, acquire mates, and provide parental care. When
asleep, animals largely avoid these energetic costs, and can
thus allocate resources to the immune system (sensu
[13,15]). Unlike the energy conservation hypothesis of
sleep [7], this reallocation hypothesis predicts little or no
overall energy savings during sleep. This appears to be
true: in humans, for example, energy savings from eight
hours of sleep would be expended within one hour of
waking (63 kilocalories [32]). Direct estimates of the energetic cost of maintaining immunity are not currently
available. However, numerous studies have suggested that
these costs are large enough to generate trade-offs with key
life history traits, such as growth and reproduction (e.g.
[33,34]). Increased energy requirements when the
immune system is upregulated also point toward a substantial metabolic cost associated with immune defence.
Even during mild antigenic challenge, basal metabolic
rate can be increased by as much as 15 to 30% [14,35-37].
Thus, a generalised elevation of immune defences may
come at considerable energetic cost.
The energetic costs of immune system maintenance and
routine functioning take multiple forms (see [14]). These
include the relatively short lifespan and so high turnover
rate of granulocytes (every 2 to 3 days [25]), the cost of
sustaining the hypermetabolic rate of immune cells [38],
and repairing the immunopathological damage that
results when cytotoxic compounds are released by
immune cells responding to antigens [39]. Thus, an influence of sleep need not be confined to investing in greater
numbers of immune cells. Indeed, both antibody
responses and natural killer cell activity are reduced following sleep deprivation [19,40], showing that sleep
could have a far broader influence on immunocompetence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/7

Our results and interpretation are consistent with experimental studies showing that animals sleep for extended
periods when mounting an immune response [13,16]. If
evolved increases in sleep allow animals to channel more
energy into their immune defences and so protect against
the development of acute infections, then short term
increases in sleep may help provide the additional energy
required for an acute phase response to an already established infection [13-15]. The possibility also exists that
evolutionary and facultative changes in sleep share a common underlying mechanism. Short term increases in sleep
appear to be triggered by immunomodulatory cytokines
that are released by white blood cells during immune
reactions [17]. If larger numbers of white blood cells produce a greater immune response to antigenic challenge,
and hence a greater release of sleep promoting cytokines,
this could potentially drive evolutionary increases in sleep
durations.
Our finding that both sleep phases are associated with
immune investment appears to be in conflict with observations that REM sleep is reduced during acute infection
(e.g. [13]). It should be noted, however, that the advantage gained through evolutionary increases in normal
sleep can also differ from the selective advantage of modulating sleep phases during the course of an infection. For
example, REM sleep is partly characterized by a loss of
thermoregulation [41], and thus it is argued that REM
sleep is inhibited during an acute phases response to
infection as it would prevent animals from maintaining
an elevated body temperature that impedes further microbial proliferation [42]. While this explanation is plausible,
it cannot be applied to evolutionary changes in normal
REM sleep durations and immune investment, which
occur in the absence of an acute phase response. As data
become available on sleep architecture during the acute
phase response of different species, comparative studies
may be able to assess the benefits of REM sleep suppression directly. Similarly, analysis of the increased intensity
of sleep that occurs during infection, as identified through
an elevation in slow wave activity [22], could reveal an
additional role of the 'quality' of sleep.
It is commonly suggested that sleep may serve multiple
functions (e.g. [1]). While our analyses yielded no evidence that sleep influenced cell production in the other
physiological systems we assessed, they do not eliminate
the possibility that sleep could have an additional function(s) elsewhere in the body. In particular, it has been
argued that sleep is 'primarily for the brain' [43], which is
a view that has both intuitive merit and considerable
experimental support (see review [44]). However, from an
evolutionary perspective, phylogenetically controlled
analyses have yet to produce support for a key expectation
of this hypothesis, namely that species with greater cogni-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:7

tive abilities should require more sleep. At best, a recent
study has suggested that REM sleep durations may
increase with the brain size of mammals ([3] but see [4]).
Since REM sleep usually accounts for less than 20% of
total sleep durations [our dataset; see Additional File 1],
these comparative findings cannot explain why different
mammalian species sleep for as long as they do. Instead,
it may be that sleep quality is of greater importance to
brain function than the overall duration of sleep per se,
which is a possibility that could be assessed when sufficient data have accumulated. In the absence of these data,
the presence of characteristic patterns of brain activity in
mammals during NREM and REM sleep, alongside the
cognitive 'black-out' that is experienced while sleeping,
imply that it does perform some important function for
the brain. The nature of this function remains hotly
debated [1]
An important implication of our findings is that ecological factors that impact sleep could indirectly affect
immune defences. By sleeping regularly in 'safe' sites such
as burrows or dens, for example, individuals may be better
protected from predators, and thus able to sleep for longer
durations [2-4,45]. Conversely, herbivorous species with
large foraging requirements could have less time available
for sleep than species living on an energy-rich carnivorous
diet [2,4,5]. Trade-offs between time invested in sleep and
alternative activities may occur at key life history stages,
such as during periods of reproductive competition [6] or
parental care [46]. Current evidence links these activities
to reduced immunocompetence [47], which could be due
to reductions in the time available for sleep. However,
field studies should also ascertain the relationship
between sleeping behaviour and an animal's exposure to
parasites, which could reveal important ecological relationships between sleep and parasitic infection that have
the potential to influence the analyses we report here [48].

Conclusion
Our results suggest mammalian species that spend more
time asleep are able to increase investment in their
immune systems, and thus are better protected from parasitic infection. These comparative findings are broadly
consistent with experimental evidence showing close
physiological links between sleep and the immune system, and point towards a major role for disease resistance
in the evolution of mammalian sleep. Given the declines
in human sleep durations that have occurred in recent
decades [49], there is a clear need for studies that further
clarify the immunological significance of sleep. In particular, studies using artificial selection regimes would allow
the evolutionary relationship between immunocompetence and sleep to be quantified under controlled experimental conditions, and without potential confounds that
are associated with sleep-deprivation studies [50] and the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/7

correlational analyses we present here. Similarly, further
studies assessing the selective advantages of modulating
sleep durations and its sub-phases during infection are
clearly warranted. There is also a need to further uncover
the physiological mechanisms underpinning the influence of sleep on the immune system, to examine how ecological factors might constrain sleeping durations, and to
investigate whether sleep deficits increase susceptibility to
disease at key stages of an animal's life history.

Methods
Data collection
Species specific sleep times were compiled from an
exhaustive search of the published literature [see Additional File 1 for details]. Data were screened for quality
and included in analyses if the study animals were sexually mature (according to reference [51]), and the study
was designed to capture the entire sleeping period. This
generally entailed observation periods of at least 24 hours,
though overnight observations on monophasic diurnal
primate species (lasting 12 to 14 hours) were included in
five cases. Where multiple estimates of sleep durations
were available for a given species, we calculated an average
value for use in analyses.

For marine mammals, estimates were for animals sleeping
on land and, following others (e.g. [10]), unihemispheric
sleep times for the left and right sides of the brain were
combined by averaging them. As the energetic cost of
maintaining half of the brain in a waking state is unclear,
we also tested alternative methods for the calculation of
unihemispheric sleeping times (combining or excluding
time spent in unihemispheric sleep), but this did not produce qualitative differences in our results (unpublished
analyses).
We use behavioural studies of sleep in our analyses of
total sleep durations (n = 7), but restrict our analyses of
NREM and REM sleep durations with haematological
parameters to studies that utilized electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of sleep [see Additional File 2
for an analysis of parasite counts and sleep that has been
similarly restricted to studies that used EEG measurement
of sleep durations]. The duck billed platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) was excluded from analyses of NREM
and REM sleep, as the validity of REM sleep times for this
species has been questioned [52].
The across-study repeatability of sleeping time estimates
using these criteria was high (0.82, F15,24 = 12.67, [53];
data are from a larger sleep dataset [see Additional File
1]), indicating that studies using our data selection criteria
recorded very similar sleep durations for a given species.
Thus, further restriction of the dataset (e.g. to EEG only
data [3,4]) would appear unnecessary for comparative

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:7

analyses, as any remaining measurement error is small relative to the wide variation in sleep durations between different species. Overall, this dataset compares favourably
with studies that have utilized all available sleep data (r =
0.42), and a previous analysis of ours that had used alternate restrictions to control data quality (r = 0.71 [4]).
There remains a possibility that data on captive animals
represent overestimates of sleeping times in the wild, as in
a more natural setting animals would seem likely to experience ecological constraints on the time available for
sleep (e.g. predator avoidance [3]). While behavioural
studies on shrews (Sorex araneus) that compared sleep
times in the wild and in the laboratory recorded similar
sleep durations [54], a more recent EEG based study on
the sloth (Bradypus tridactylus) suggested that this species
may sleep less in the wild than had been recorded in the
laboratory [55,56]. However, this comparison included
laboratory estimates from juvenile animals that are
known to sleep for longer durations, and is therefore
questionable [55-57]. More generally, the occurrence of
'sleep rebounds' in a laboratory setting, in which animals
sleep more following a period of sleep deprivation, suggest that the sleeping times that have been recorded are
homeostatically regulated and therefore representative of
an animal's daily sleep requirement [58].
Haematological data were extracted from the physiological reference values reported by ISIS [24], and are from
zoo animals that are judged to be in normal health. These
reference values are designed to be used in a diagnostic
capacity by veterinary professionals, and are screened for
anomalous data. On average, these data have arisen from
blood samples derived from 20 different zoological institutions (range: 1 to 52), with 76 animals contributing to
the reference value (range: 4 to 289). Insufficient data
were available in some species to separate cell counts by
age or sex; however, repeatability between sex and age
groups were high (for the white blood cell counts of species present in analyses: 0.88, F15,16 = 16.51, and 0.7, F15,29
= 7.76, respectively [53]). Thus, we included averaged values in analyses from animals of mixed sex and age class.
Data on parasitism were extracted from the Global Mammal Parasite Database [28]. This database summarizes
studies that describe patterns of parasite occurrence in
wild populations and includes both macro- and microparasites. The data were restricted to studies that provided
measures of prevalence. Relative infection status was calculated as the number of parasite species found in species
multiplied by the (mean) percentage of animals infected.
By taking account of the prevalence of parasite species,
this measure avoids giving undue weight to parasites that
rarely infect a particular host species successfully.

Data analysis
Phylogenetically independent contrasts were calculated
using the CRUNCH algorithm in the CAIC computer program [59], with branch lengths set to be equal. The
assumptions of independent contrasts were best met with
a combination of natural logarithm, square root, and
reciprocal square root transformations [see Additional
File 1 for specific details [60]]. Analyses were performed
using multiple or univariate regression, with the regression line forced through the origin [59,60]. Bootstrap estimates are presented when there was evidence of variance
heterogeneity or outlying data-points [61]. Regression
analyses were implemented in Genstat 8th edition and
controlled for an influence of body mass, activity period,
and sampling effort when appropriate (see next section).
Significance of variables is judged from the estimate of the
regression coefficient in association with its standard
error; the P values presented are calculated from the t statistic that is derived from these estimates and the sample
size of each analysis. For predictions and plots, activity
period was set to be diurnal, while body mass and sampling effort were held at average levels.
Statistical control for body mass
Previous comparative studies have identified allometric
scaling relationships in haematological parameters
[62,63]. We found a similar influence of body mass in our
analyses of white blood cell counts using the raw data
(coefficient = 0.0257, s.e. = 0.00564, t22 = 4.55, P < 0.001),
white blood cell counts using phylogenetically independent contrasts (coefficient = 0.0177, s.e. = 0.005, t23 = 3.55,
P = 0.002), and the relative abundance of white blood
cells (coefficient = 0.228, s.e. = 0.053, t20 = 4.29, P <
0.001). We also found a negative relationship between
body mass and red blood cell counts (contrast analysis,
coefficient = -1.793, s.e. = 0.566, t23 = -3.17, P = 0.004).
For white blood cell counts, these relationships appeared
to be driven by the allometric scaling of neutrophils and
monocytes (bootstrapped estimates for: neutrophils, coefficient = 0.1227, s.e. = 0.0503, P = 0.002; monocytes, coefficient = 0.1099, s.e. = 0.0557, P < 0.05; for all other cell
types P > 0.7). In each of these cases, the results we present
are therefore derived from multiple regressions in which
body mass was included as an explanatory variable.
Statistical control for activity period
White blood cell counts exhibit cyclical diurnal variation
[64,65] that is intimately linked to the sleep-wake cycle
[64]. We therefore examined whether the different activity
period of nocturnal species was reflected in their white
blood cell counts. We found that nocturnal species had
significantly reduced white blood cell counts (nocturnality: effect = -0.0300, s.e. = 0.0120, t22 = -2.50, P = 0.02),
which appeared to be driven solely by changes in neutrophil numbers (for log transformed neutrophil counts:

effect = -0.544, s.e. = 0.159, t22 = -3.42, P = 0.002; in analyses of all other cell types activity period was not significant, P > 0.33). This effect of nocturnality on neutrophil
numbers and total white blood cell count was statistically
corrected prior to the generation of independent contrasts; effect sizes were obtained from the parameter estimates in the corresponding multiple regression and are
listed above. Analyses of white blood cells that did not
account for differences in activity periods produced qualitatively similar results [see Additional File 2].
Statistical control for sampling effort
Estimates of the number of micro- and macroparasites
that infect host species are dependent upon the degree to
which the host species has been studied [29-31]. Thus, we
statistically corrected our estimates of infection status
prior to analysis by controlling for the highly significant
influence of sampling effort (estimated by the number of
studies that described the parasites of each host; raw species data: coefficient = 1.43, s.e. = 0.284, t10 = 4.03, P =
0.002; contrasts: coefficient = 1.275, s.e. = 0.286, t10 =
4.45, P = 0.001). Citation number explained 58% and
64% of the variance in species and contrast data on parasitism, respectively.
