Abstract
Background: Teleost fish have seven paralogous clusters of Hox genes stemming from two
complete genome duplications early in vertebrate evolution, and an additional genome duplication
during the evolution of ray-finned fish, followed by the secondary loss of one cluster. Gene
duplications on the one hand, and the evolution of regulatory sequences on the other, are thought
to be among the most important mechanisms for the evolution of new gene functions. Cichlid fish,
the largest family of vertebrates with about 2500 species, are famous examples of speciation and
morphological diversity. Since this diversity could be based on regulatory changes, we chose to
study the coding as well as putative regulatory regions of their Hox clusters within a comparative
genomic framework.
Results: We sequenced and characterized all seven Hox clusters of Astatotilapia burtoni, a
haplochromine cichlid fish. Comparative analyses with data from other teleost fish such as
zebrafish, two species of pufferfish, stickleback and medaka were performed. We traced losses of
genes and microRNAs of Hox clusters, the medaka lineage seems to have lost more microRNAs
than the other fish lineages. We found that each teleost genome studied so far has a unique set of
Hox genes. The hoxb7a gene was lost independently several times during teleost evolution, the
most recent event being within the radiation of East African cichlid fish. The conserved non-coding
sequences (CNS) encompass a surprisingly large part of the clusters, especially in the HoxAa,
HoxCa, and HoxDa clusters. Across all clusters, we observe a trend towards an increased content
of CNS towards the anterior end.
Conclusion: The gene content of Hox clusters in teleost fishes is more variable than expected,
with each species studied so far having a different set. Although the highest loss rate of Hox genes
occurred immediately after whole genome duplications, our analyses showed that gene loss
continued and is still ongoing in all teleost lineages. Along with the gene content, the CNS content
also varies across clusters. The excess of CNS at the anterior end of clusters could imply a stronger
conservation of anterior expression patters than those towards more posterior areas of the
embryo.

Background
Genome duplications [1,2] and regulatory evolution [3-5]
are thought to be two major genomic evolutionary mechanisms that are, at least partly, responsible for the
increased diversity of vertebrates compared to their chordate relatives. Genome and gene duplications can provide
the raw material on which evolution can act since they
lead to redundant gene copies that are freed up to evolve
novel gene functions [1,6].
Sequence data from complete genomes of tetrapods such
as mouse, frog and human as well as from invertebrates
such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster
show that many gene families tend to be larger in vertebrates [7-9]. Synteny data demonstrated that the most
likely scenario for the increased size of gene families are
two consecutive rounds of genome duplication, the socalled 2R-hypothesis [10-12]. Genomic data from
zebrafish and pufferfish showed that many genes were
duplicated before the divergence of those two species representing the major fish orders Neoteleostei and Ostariophysii [13-15]. More recently, syntenic data from
zebrafish, medaka and pufferfish further confirmed the
existence of an additional genome duplication event
within the ray-finned fish lineage, the fish-specific
genome duplication (FSGD) [16-18]. The most recent
comparative genomic analyses also support the FSGD and
found that the majority of genes was duplicated around
320–350 mya [19,20]. Moreover, studies on individual
nuclear genes and gene families propose a timing of the
duplication preceding the diversification of teleosts
[15,21-23].
One of the earliest and best-studied examples for duplicated chromosomal regions is the clusters of Hox genes
[21,24,25]. Hox genes are transcription factors, characterized by their DNA binding domain, the homeodomain.
They were first discovered in Drosophila as the target of
homeotic mutation, meaning the change of the segmental
identity, as in the bithorax phenotype [26]. One special
feature of Hox genes is their arrangement in genomic clusters. While invertebrates have a single cluster that can be
interrupted as in Drosophila species [27] or dispersed
through the genome as in urochrodates [28,29] and nematodes [30], tetrapods such as human or frogs all have
four clusters [reviewed in [31,32]], as do cartilaginous fish
[33]. Even invertebrates closely related to vertebrates, such
as the cephalochordate Branchiostoma [25,34] have a single cluster, which in the case of the sea urchin, is also rearranged [35]. Due to the fish-specific genome duplication,
extant fish have seven Hox clusters, with alternate cluster
loss in Ostariophysi (HoxDb in zebrafish) [36] and Acanthopterygii (HoxCb in pufferfish, medaka, cichlid)
[18,37-40]. The additional clusters, however, are not
exactly equivalent with the homologous genes of tetrap-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/317

ods, but have experienced independent losses of genes
[31], making the teleost clusters much more variable in
gene content than those of tetrapods. So far, all of the fish
that have been studied showed differences in gene content
among their Hox clusters [18,31,37,41].
Individual gene loss after gene or genome duplication
events is common and can occur even long after the duplication [42-44]. Interestingly, some functional categories
such as signal transducers and transcriptional regulators
tend to retain more members than most gene families created by duplication [45-47]. The reasons and mechanisms
for these differences in rate of gene loss among different
functional groups remain incompletely understood, but
current theories propose a link of equimolar amounts of
different regulatory genes (gene balance hypothesis) [48].
The other main genomic source for evolutionary change is
thought to be the evolution of regulatory sequences, so
called regulatory evolution [49]. Also for this major type
of evolutionary change, Hox genes are an often-studied
example [50-54]. The clustered nature of Hox genes facilitates comparison of orthologous and paralogous
sequences and the high degree of conservation allows for
identification and detailed analyses of evolutionary
events in regulatory sequences. Vertebrate Hox clusters are
almost free of repetitive elements [55] which adds further
tractability to the study of regulatory evolution. Hox genes
play an important role in the specification of the primary
body axis [56] as well as in later ontogenetic processes
demanding highly specific regulation such as limb development [57].
Conserved Non-coding Sequences (CNS) in Hox clusters
have been intensely studied previously, both in terms of
content and cluster identity [53,58,59] as well as their
evolutionary rates in duplicated clusters [50,54]. The
intergenic regions of Hox clusters are enriched for CNS
and it has been argued that this abundance of cis- and
trans-regulatory elements is the main reason for cluster
conservation since neighboring genes share regulatory elements. However, it is unclear how strong this "gluing
effect" of regulatory elements is for the cohesion of Hox
genes in clusters since Hox clusters in at least some invertebrates can be split without apparent loss of function
[27]. One possible source of the higher plasticity of the
invertebrate cluster is the presence of repetitive DNA
while in vertebrates, there is strong selection acting
against it [55].
Actinopterygian (ray-finned) fishes not only encompass
more than half of all vertebrate species (about 27,000)
[60], but also display a huge variety of body shapes. One
particular species-rich, monophyletic group of derived teleosts is the Euteleostei, currently ranked as one of the four

Page 2 of 16

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:317

subdivisions of the Teleostei, along with the more basal
groups, Osteoglossomorpha, Elopomorpha, and Clupeomorpha [61-65]. The Euteleostei comprise approximately
25,000 species, of which 17,000 are Neoteleosts (e.g.,
pufferfishes, medaka, cichlids, and stickleback) and 8,000
Ostariophysi (e.g. zebrafish)[60]. Among the Neoteleostei, most species are classified as Perciformes (about
10,000 species), this however is a polyphyletic assembly,
with at least five lineages [62]. One family of the Perciformes are cichlid fishes (Family Cichlidae), with more
than 2,500 species; almost ten percent of all fish species
are cichlids. Of particular interest is the immense species
richness of the adaptive radiations of the East African
Lakes Victoria, Malawi and Tanganyika which are made
up each of several hundred endemic species each [66,67].
The species flocks of Lake Victoria as well as of Lake
Malawi are monophyletic and hundreds of species arose
within less than 100,000 years in the case of the Lake Victoria species flock – the fastest known rates of speciation
[66,68].
One of the most intriguing questions now is, whether
there is a genetic basis for this astonishing speciation rate
and the enormous morphological diversity cichlids show.
Since these events occur very rapidly, changes involving
regulatory pathways are likely to be involved. Hox clusters
provide a good starting point for a genomic investigation
of this kind due to their clustered structure, which can be
easily homologized with other species, and because of
their known high content of CNS [59], combined with
their key role in early and later development.
During the last few years, complete genomic sequences
have become available for many species, including several
teleost fishes. Some species were selected either for their
small genome size (e.g., the pufferfishes Takifugu rubripes
and Tetraodon nigroviridis) [18,69] or because they are
model organisms of developmental research (Danio rerio,
Oryzias latipes) or speciation (Gasterosteus aculeatus)[70].
The construction of large insert libraries such as those in
BAC or fosmid vectors, make it possible to study genomic
regions also for species for which a genome project is (not
yet) available [23,51,71].
In this study, we sequenced the Hox-cluster containing
BAC clones from the East African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni [72]. We performed a phylogenetic analysis with concatenated coding sequences and investigated gene and
microRNA loss in the clusters as well as content of conserved non-coding sequences in the A. burtoni clusters in
comparison with all available teleost Hox gene clusters.
The clusters show a tendency to preserve a higher amount
of CNS towards the 'anterior' end of the cluster, the region
which is fundamentally involved in development of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/317

head [73,74], while the 'posterior' part contains more variation in regulatory elements.

Results
We screened the BAC library of Astatotilapia burtoni [72]
for clones containing Hox clusters using specific-probes.
Fragments spanning the intron were used as probes to
avoid non-specific cross-reactions. Positive clones
obtained by these screens were checked with specific
primers for the 5' and 3' most genes of a cluster (e.g. evx-2
and hoxd3a) to confirm that they contain complete clusters. Clones containing all Hox genes of a cluster were
shotgun sequenced. In this way, we obtained seven BAC
clones which contain complete HoxAa, HoxAb, HoxBb,
HoxCa, HoxDa and HoxDb clusters as well as the 5' part of
the HoxBa cluster spanning the region from hoxb13a to
hoxb5a (Figure 1).
The clone 116-M8 (149.6 kb) contained the complete
HoxAa cluster from hoxa13a to hoxa1a plus the related
evx1 gene. 5' to evx1 we also identified the complete coding sequence of Hibadha (3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase a). This is in agreement with the gene order in the
Takifugu rubripes genome. The complete Hox containing
region of the HoxAa cluster (including evx1) spans 86 kb.
For the HoxAb cluster, we selected clone 150-O18 (164.6
kb) for sequencing. The genes in this genomic region are
tightly packed; this is true for the Hox genes as well as the
surrounding genes. Also here the adjacent genes are
orthologous to pufferfish sequences (cpv1 (carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like), creb5b (cAMP responsive element
binding protein 5), jazf1b (juxtaposed with another zinc
finger protein 1), tax1bp1b (Tax1 binding protein 1),
hibadhb (3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase b), and
skap2 (Src family associated phosphoprotein 2)). The
HoxAb cluster is a small cluster both in terms of number
of genes as well as intergenic regions and has a size of only
27 kb.
The HoxBa cluster is the largest in the genome of A. burtoni
and we sequenced clone 170-E12 (160.1 kb), which contains the 5' part of the cluster from hoxb13a to hoxb5a.
Despite intense screening of the BAC library with probes
for the 3'genes (hoxb4a, hoxb3a, hoxb2a, hoxb1a), we could
not identify a BAC clone containing this region in our
library. We were able to amplify those genes from
genomic DNA however. Therefore, they are not lost from
the genome of Astatotilapia burtoni, but were apparently
not contained in our BAC library. Similar to Gasterosteus
aculeatus, Astatotilapia burtoni also has a large intergenic
region (63 kb) containing repetitive elements between
hoxb13a and hoxb9a. While this region looks "normal" in
both pufferfish species as well as in medaka and zebrafish,
this region in tetrapods also appears to be "decaying". So

genes are drawn in black. Abbreviations used are according to [38], the surrounding genes are identical to those found in Takifugu rubipes. The HoxBa cluster is incomplete, sequence data stops at 12 kb downstream of hoxb5a. Sequence data for the
remaining four Hox genes and the non-coding regions of remaining parts of the cluster have been gathered by PCR, indicating
that the clustered structure still exists.

far, no hoxb13 gene from frog could be identified [31,75]
and in the human cluster, two non-Hox genes are situated
between HoxB13 and HoxB9 (PRAC, LOC729146). The
increase in size of the HoxBa cluster relative to that of the
other Hox clusters also affects the size of its intergenic and
the intronic regions. Although the hoxb7a gene of Astatotilapia burtoni was identified and annotated without problems, the coding sequence contains a stop codon at the
beginning of the coding sequence, rendering it a pseudogene. However, in the other cichlid species studied so far,
Oreochromis niloticus, hoxb7a has a completely intact coding sequence indicating that the non-functionalization of
this gene in A. burtoni occurred within only the approximately last seven million years since the two species last
shared a common ancestor.
The paralogous cluster of the "giant" HoxBa, is the
"dwarf" HoxBb cluster, which was identified within BAC
clone 34-B18 (152.2 kb). It contains only four Hox genes
(hoxb6b, hoxb5b, hoxb3b, and hoxb1b) and spans only

about 20 kb. Apart from the Hox genes themselves, the
genes surrounding the HoxBb cluster are also densely
packed. The clone contains also a partial sequence of
ndp52 (nuclear domain 10 protein 52) and the complete
sequences of TTLL6 (tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family
member 6), scap1 (Src family associated phosphoprotein
1), snx11 (sorting nexin 11), cbx1 (chromobox-like 1),
nfe2l1 (nuclear factor erythroid derived 2-like 1), and
cdk5rap3 (CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 3)
(Figure 1).
Clone 103-K21 (182.8 kb) contains the complete HoxCa
cluster and three additional genes 3' of the cluster (cbx5
(chromobox-like 5), hnrpa1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1), and nfe2 (nuclear factor erythroidderived 2)). Also here the order of the neighbouring genes
is the same as in Takifugu rubripes. This also confirms that
there are no further Hox genes downstream of hoxc3a in
cichlids, while in zebrafish hoxc1a was retained. The com-

plete length of the HoxCa cluster in Astatotilapia burtoni
from hoxc13a to hoxc3a is 91 kb.
The HoxDa cluster was sequenced from clone 32-B18
(182.2 kb). This Hox cluster only spans 53 kb from evx2
to hoxd3a, and the surrounding sequences contain only
one more gene, lnpa (lunapark a).

From clone 19-E16 (186.2 kb), the sister cluster HoxDb
was sequenced. Two upstream genes (chrna1b (cholinergic
receptor nicotinic alpha polypeptide) and lnpb (lunapark
b)) confirm that there are only two Hox genes in this cluster, hoxd9b and hoxd4b, and that hoxd11b, which is present
in HoxDb clusters of stickleback and the two pufferfishes
was lost in cichlids. Downstream of hoxd4b, we identified
the complete coding region of mtx2 (metaxin 2).

In general, the neighboring genes that were identified
were orthologous to those in Takifugu rubripes. From other

teleost species.

Phylogenetic analyses
Since there is no prior phylogenetic study including all of
the model organisms that were part of our study, we performed a phylogenetic analysis in order to be able to trace
gene loss events and the evolutionary history of the Hox
clusters in an accurate phylogenetic framework. Based on
alignments of coding regions, we selected 24 Hox genes
(Table 1) for which orthologs had been identified both in
human and Xenopus tropicalis and the complete dataset for
seven teleost species: two cichlids (Astatotilapia burtoni,
Oreochromis niloticus), medaka (Oryzias latipes), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), two pufferfishes (Tetraodon
nigroviridis, Takifugu rubripes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio).
When two teleost paralogs were available, we were careful
to choose the more slowly evolving copy based on a preliminary tree to reduce the potentially detrimental effects
of introducing noise into the dataset. We excluded positions that could not be aligned and concatenated 24 genes
for a complete dataset of nine species and 20,009 basepairs. Modelgenerator [76] identified GTR + G (alpha =
0.53) as the best fitting model. With these parameters we
ran PhyML [77] with 500 bootstrap replicates and
MrBayes 3.1 for 1,000,000 generations, sampling every
10th generation and with a burn-in of 5000. We obtained
a fully resolved tree with maximal support for all nodes
using both methods (Figure 2).

Danio rerio, the only ostariophysian species for which a
complete set of Hox clusters is currently available, is the
sister group of the Neoteleosts, hence all other species
included in this study. Within the Neoteleosts, two clades

were recovered: firstly the pufferfishes, which form a
monophyletic group and secondly, a clade consisting of
stickleback, medaka and the cichlids, with a sister group
relationship of O. latipes and the two cichlid species. The
close relationship of cichlids with medaka has been previously described based on nuclear genes [78] and on ESTs
[79].
Gene loss and loss of microRNAs in the teleost Hox clusters
We identified 46 functional coding sequences for Hox
genes and one recent pseudogene in Astatotilapia burtoni.
Based on the tree obtained, we traced events of gene loss
and loss of microRNAs among these major fish model systems (Figure 3). The most salient gene losses that can be
traced with confidence without complete data on basal
teleosts and non-duplicated actinopterygians happened
after the divergence of the Ostariophysii and Neoteleostei
while most gene losses probably immediately followed

the FSGD. Based on Danio rerio, the Ostariophysii have
lost seven genes since the last hypothetical common
ancestor with the Neoteleosts. During the evolution of the
Neoteleosts eight Hox genes were lost. If we assume a
divergence time of 290–304 mya between Ostariophysii
and Neosteleostei [80,81] and an age of the genome
duplication of 320–350 mya [19,20], at least thirty-one
genes were lost within the 50 mya following the FSGD
[31] and only 7–8 during the last 300 mya. This corroborates previous findings of high initial gene loss rates
immediately following a large scale duplication event [8284].
The pufferfish lineage lost three genes in the common lineage leading to Takifugu and Tetraodon (Figure 3). Gasterosteus aculeatus has the most complete set Hox genes, only
the hoxb6b gene has not been identified so far, most likely
due to a large sequence gap in the genomic contig, leaving
open the possibility that it was not been lost. The loss of
hoxd11b in both medaka and cichlids supports their
monophyletic grouping in a parsimony framework. Both
species also lost the hoxb7a gene, but due to independent
events, as the existence of a functional hoxb7a gene in
another cichlid species (Oreochromis niloticus) implies.
The sets of microRNAs in ostariophysian and neoteleost
Hox clusters are similar but not identical. An equivalent to

the mir196-Cb could not be identified in neoteleosts,
which have lost the entire HoxCb cluster. So far, the
assembly of the D. rerio genome is still incomplete and the
HoxCb cluster is not contained in a single contig, therefore the identification of its neighboring genes and thus,
the corresponding regions in Neoteleosts is not yet possible. D. rerio retains the mir10-Db copy between the lunapark b and metaxin2 genes, even though the hox genes in
this genomic region have been lost [85]. In medaka, we
were not able to identify mir196-Ab, mir196-Ba and
mir10-Bb, even though sequences were complete and
without gaps in these intergenic regions. Therefore these
microRNAs might have been lost in the medaka lineage.
In contrast to a previous study, we were able to identify
mir196-Ab and mir196-Ba in the zebrafish clusters [86],
probably due to increased sequence quality of the
genomic sequence.
Analyses of Conserved Non-coding Sequences (CNS)
We performed analyses of CNS using the program Tracker
[52] with orthologous teleost Hox clusters. The datasets
analyzed included 3 kb of additional sequence on both
ends of the cluster. This rule was only changed for HoxCa
clusters of both pufferfishes, where we used the complete
genomic sequence up to the next downstream gene, cbx5,
in order to be able include the pseudogene hoxc3a in this
analysis. In the analysis of the HoxBb clusters we included

between cichlid and medaka except for HoxDb.

surround hoxb8b in Danio rerio and may still exist in other
fish, where this gene was lost. Also for HoxDb clusters in
Oryzias latipes and Astatotilapia burtoni, the 5' region was
extended until the beginning of the lnb gene, since we
were not able to find a gene or pseudogene of hoxd11b
with other methods in this species and we wanted to
include any possible CNSs. For the pufferfishes, the 3'
overlap had to be shortened because the intergenic region
between hoxd4b and mtx2 is shorter than 3 kb. For a visual
analysis, we also constructed mVista plots [87] based on
LAGAN alignments [88] that are provided in Additional
files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. MicroRNAs are marked in green.
For the HoxAa cluster, we obtained a total of 192 footprint cliques (FCs, clusters of conserved footprints forming a single alignment), which add up to a total length of
34.4 kb (37%) in A. burtoni (total cluster length 92.2 kb)
(Figure 4). The sequence included all hox genes plus evx1.

For the most part the identified CNS are teleost specific,
i.e. present in all fish species included, (14%) or neo-teleost specific (15%, present in all species except zebrafish)
(Figure 4). One of the teleost specific cliques contains
mir196-Aa [see Additional File 1]. However, we found
more CNS shared only between A. burtoni and Gasterosteus aculeatus than between A. burtoni and Oryzias latipes. This is in interesting disagreement with the
phylogenetic hypothesis (Figure 2). Comparisons of the
lengths of CNS relative to sequence length in intergenic
regions along one cluster show a tendency to increase
towards the anterior end of the cluster (Figure 5).
The HoxAb cluster is shorter (total length in A. burtoni:
33.2 kb) than the HoxAa cluster, contains only five genes
and 53 PFCs could be identified, which cover a total of 7.6
kb (23%) of the A. burtoni HoxAb cluster. The average content of cliques in intergenic regions is lower than in the
HoxAa cluster (Figure 4). While the proportion of coding
sequence of the entire Hox cluster is about the same as in

Page 9 of 16

the HoxAa cluster, the CNS make up a much smaller portion of the total cluster length (37% in the HoxAa cluster,
but only 23% in HoxAb cluster). Most of the CNSs are
evolutionarily conserved and shared between all teleosts
or at least between the neoteleosts. Also here we find more
similarities between cichlid and stickleback than between
cichlid and medaka. The footprint clique containing
mir196-Ab did not identify a orthologous sequence for
medaka, suggesting a lineage-specific loss of this microRNA in medaka [see Additional File 2].
For the HoxBa cluster, we included the partial cluster of A.
burtoni (total length 135.0 kb) that we obtained in this
study. For the statistical analyses we also compared data
from stickleback (total length 233.3 kb) since it showed
more similarities in terms of CNS to the cichlid than
medaka. For all species except A. burtoni, the compared
HoxBa cluster sequence included the sequence from
hoxb13a to hoxb1a. In total, the analyses identified 311
footprint cliques, adding up to a total length of 13.3 kb in
A. burtoni (10%) and 26.7 kb in G. aculeatus (11%). Comparing the relative proportions of coding sequences, CNS
and non-conserved non-coding sequences are similar
between G. aculeatus and A. burtoni, implying that the partial cluster is representative of the rest of this Hox gene
cluster. Also, the distributions of amounts of CNS in the
intergenic regions along the cluster are similar in both
species (Figure 4). In both species, there is a long stretch
of sequence between hoxb13a and hoxb9a that does not
contain any footprint but gives BLAST hits to repetitive
elements from the same species. The analyses revealed the
existence of mir196-Ba in all teleosts – except for medaka
– and mir10-Ba was found in all species but A. burtoni, due
to missing sequence data [see Additional File 3]. While in
terms of gene number the cluster is still complete, the CNS
content is low (in comparison to other clusters), which is
probably also an effect of the large intergenic regions.
The small HoxBb cluster had a total length of 29.2 kb,
Tracker identified 70 FC, and the CNSs covered a total of
8.7 kb in A. burtoni. In contrast to its big "sister" HoxBa
cluster, the CNSs make up a higher percentage of the cluster than the coding regions and the distribution of CNSs
in the intergenic regions display a high density of conserved sites. The extremely short intergenic region
between hoxb6b and hoxb5b results in the high peak seen
in Figure 5d. Interestingly, the mir10-Bb could be identified in all species except again for O. latipes [see Additional
File 4]. It is interesting to note that the medaka Hox clusters seems to lose microRNAs apparently more frequently
than other fish lineages.
The HoxCa cluster contains 10 genes and has a complete
length of 96.5 kb in A. burtoni. 38% of the clusters are CNS
(37.0 kb) identified in the Tracker analysis, and make up

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/317

more than the complete length of coding sequences
(22%). The CNSs were mainly teleost and neoteleost-specific, and we could identify two microRNAs in all species:
mir196-Ca and mir10-Ca [see Additional File 5]. In comparison with other clusters, the CNS density is high and
there is also a slight increase in CNS length towards the
anterior end of the cluster (Figure 5f).
For the HoxDa cluster, we also included the evx-2 gene
and we could identify 113 footprint cliques. The sequence
has a complete length of 53.9 kb in A. burtoni and the CNS
take up 18.2 kb (34%) of it. Most of these are teleost specific (21%). The distribution shows a peak 5' of evx-2,
where a highly conserved sequence has been described
before [89]. Otherwise there is a noticeable trend for more
CNS towards the anterior end of the HoxDa cluster [see
Additional File 6].
The HoxDb cluster fragment analyzed for A. burtoni
spanned 38.8 kb, reaching from the end of lnpb to 3 kb
downstream of hoxd4b. We obtained 60 footprint cliques,
the conserved sequences in A. burtoni have a total length
of 5.3 kb (14%). The CNS are mainly neoteleost specific,
due to the loss of the Danio rerio Hoxdb cluster, teleost
specific CNS could not be detected. Our analysis also
found the mir10-db in all species [see Additional File 7].
In order to be able to recognize general trends of sequence
conservation of CNS in Hox clusters, we calculated the
percentage of CNS for each intergenic region. Figure 5
shows the average of that percentage within the neoteleosts. We excluded zebrafish from this calculation, since
the values were much lower due to evolutionary distance
and the different gene setup of clusters made it difficult to
include these data. Based on our analyses, the clusters
with the highest percentage of CNS in their intergenic
regions are HoxAa, HoxBb, HoxCa, and HoxDa (Figure
5a,d–f). It might have been expected therefore that
HoxAa, HoxCa and HoxDa are also the clusters where
most of the genes are conserved, while HoxBb only has
retained four and yet, surprisingly, retained large sets of
conserved CNS. Here, the high percentage of CNS (Figure
5d) is most likely caused by the high "gene density" of the
cluster and the short intergenic regions. Whereas, the long
intergenic regions of the HoxBa cluster "dilute" the CNS
in this genomic region (Figure 5c). The anterior part of the
HoxCa gene is very heterogenic in terms of CNS content
due to gene loss in the pufferfishes (Figure 5e). HoxAb
and HoxDb have also lost genes (by comparison to their
paralogous clusters) and, correspondingly, CNS (Figure
5b,g). A general interesting trend that is observed in all
clusters (except HoxAb) is a maximal peak of CNS
towards the anterior end of the clusters (Figure 5).

Discussion
We screened the BAC library of A. burtoni for Hox-positive
clones and identified clones with complete clusters by
PCR of the 5' and 3' most genes. Since obtained sequence
data included surrounding genes for most clusters, we can
be certain that our analysis misses only maximally four
genes of the HoxBa cluster. Through PCR, sequence data
for those genes (hoxb4a, hoxb3a, hoxb2a and hoxb1a) and
partial non-coding data of this region were also obtained
and, therefore, we can safely assume that these genes are
clustered also in A. burtoni. Our analyses of the non-coding area of the partial HoxBa cluster of A. burtoni in comparison with the complete cluster of G. aculeatus shows
that the features of this Hox cluster of these two species are
similar. The Hox gene content is almost identical to that
of Oreochromis niloticus [40]. There are two exceptions: we
were not able to identify any trace of a hoxd11b gene in the
BAC library of A. burtoni. A previously described sequence,
which claimed to be from a cichlid [40] is almost identical
to Tetraodon nigroviridis (169 of 171 base pairs identical),
including a part of the additional intron this gene has
acquired. This suggests that this is not an Oreochromis
sequence (AY757355) as claimed by Santini and Bernardi
[40] but rather is indeed simply previously published
Tetraodon nigroviridis sequence instead. We strongly suspect that a large portion of the Oreochromis sequences of
that study [40] were taken from an unpublished data set
of the Meyer laboratory which was not collected by S. Santini but published fraudulently under her name. The proposed cichlid genome projects on Oreochromis and
Astatotilapia will also aid in the clarification of this matter.
The other difference between the cichlids is the existence
of a stop codon in the sequence of hoxb7a of A. burtoni
while the coding sequence of Oreochromis niloticus is still
intact [[40], Hoegg et al. unpublished data]. This implies
not only that hoxb7a was lost independently in different
lineages of fish such as in the lineages leading to pufferfish
or medaka, but also in at least part of the cichlid fish radiation, suggesting that it is not essential and can be lost easily and repeatedly. However, some selective forces
apparently did prevent it from being deleted for probably
hundreds of millions of years since the fish-specific
genome duplication [20]. More detailed analyses of its
expression, the exact phylogenetic timing of gene loss and
its possible implications for speciation in haplochromine
cichlids will be needed to investigate this further. Differences in gene content of the Hox gene clusters, the essential developmental toolkit, that differentiate two species
of closely related African cichlid fish species is a rather
unexpected finding.
We performed a phylogenetic analysis based on a dataset
of 24 Hox genes from seven fish species and two outgroup
species (human and frog) and obtained a single, highly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/317

supported tree (Figure 2), which shows a monophyletic
group of G. aculeatus, O. latipes and the cichlids A. burtoni
and O. niloticus. The close relationship of Beloniformes
(O. latipes) and Perciformes (A. burtoni/O. niloticus) is in
agreement with recent molecular phylogenies [78,79] and
rejects the monophyly of Smegmamorpha, a clade that
contains Beloniformes and Gasterosteiformes but not Perciformes. Even though the Order Perciformes is not
monophyletic itself [62], more data including more species will be required to resolve the complete phylogeny.
This will be necessary in the future to make assumptions
about genomic evolution in the neoteleost fishes within
the correct phylogenetic framework. A new phylogeny and
a new classification of the highly diverse clade Percomorpha is especially required. For our species set used, we are
confident in the tree, especially since it is also fully congruent with the inferred gene loss patterns (Figure 2).
Only the position of G. aculeatus cannot be determined
with certainty by the parsimony approach of gene losses.
Also the Hox phylogeny indicates a close relationship of
cichlids and medaka to the exclusion of other orders in
the Percomorpha such as the pufferfishes and the sticklebacks. Interestingly, the analyses of CNS, however, show
consistently a higher similarity between G. aculeatus and
A. burtoni than between O. latipes and A. burtoni (Figure 4).
CNS shared only between O. latipes and A. burtoni where
consistently too few to show, except for HoxDb. Also, of
nine miRNAs contained in the other neoteleostean species, three were lost in the O. latipes cluster (Figure 3). In
general, we find a high variability of gene content within
teleost fish, no two of the species examined so far had the
same gene content in their clusters. This might be due to
the redundancy that was created by the FSGD, and that
still permits gene loss without major consequences on the
bodyplan. In tetrapods, it is assumed that the Hox gene
setup is more conserved. However, data from the frog
Xenopus tropicalis [31] and from the coelacanth Latimeria
menadoensis [90] show that there is variation also among
sarcopterigians. When more tetrapod lineages are examined, it will become more clear if and how much more
variable fish clusters are.
The finding of greater similarity between sticklebacks and
cichlids in regulatory elements suggests however, that the
medaka genome evolves at a higher rate, at least in noncoding sequences. Why this should be so deserves further
attention. The coding sequences also show a slightly accelerated rate of evolution in comparison to other neoteleost
species (Figure 2). The increase in evolutionary rate rather
seems to be a Hox-specific trend; a study on differential
rates of duplicate genes more often identified slower evolutionary rates in medaka rather than accelerated ones
[44]. Since the sequences of the O. latipes Hox clusters are
not directly taken from a genome sequencing project but

Page 11 of 16

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:317

from sequenced BAC clones with only few, small gaps,
possible artifacts due to potential assembly problems of
the medaka genome can be excluded.
The analyses of CNS of A. burtoni showed as well that the
major part, or at least the longest part, of the potential regulatory elements is conserved between all teleost species
included in this study, or at least between neoteleost species. This can also be seen as an indication that the analysis parameters have been chosen correctly, are
conservative and do not tend to overestimate the number
of phylogenetic footprints. This also indicates that even
though the gene content in Hox clusters in fish is more
variable than previously thought, the main regulatory elements are highly conserved. That gene loss and gain even
in such important genes such as Hox genes, even among
relatively closely related species, might imply that the
putative paramount importance of regulatory evolution
in bringing about phenotypic change during evolution is
not as great as generally believed.
We could also show that there is a trend towards more
CNS in the anterior portion of the cluster (Figure 5) which
has been described before for the HoxAa cluster based on
a different analytical method [59]. Knockout studies on
other vertebrates showed that a complete knockdown for
paralogy group 1 in Xenopus results in serious developmental defects [91], and mutations in HoxA1 in humans
are linked with Bosley-Salih-Alorainy syndrome effecting
delayed development, eye movement and formation of
the cranial nerve VIII [92]. Several mutations for posterior
genes have been described in HoxA13 (Hand-foot-genital
syndrome [93]) and HoxD13 (Synpolydactyly [94]). This
might imply that anterior Hox genes are usually buffered
by functional redundancy of paralogs and any mutation
in the CNS in those anterior Hox-clusters would be
expected to be severe and most likely lethal. Therefore, the
regulation of anterior Hox genes would be expected to be
more important for the patterning and survival of an
embryo than those of posterior genes, which do not affect
the brain and head development to the same extent. Similar conclusions were drawn from the observation that
among the vertebrates, sequence divergence between posterior genes is higher than between more anterior genes,
an effect termed "laxitas terminalis" [95]. The authors of
this study suggest that posterior genes are not linked to
basal vertebrate functions but rather fulfill lineage specific
functions. In a comparison among all posterior Hox genes
among more distantly related phyla, it was found that
deuterostome posterior genes are evolving faster than
their protostome counterparts as well as the deuterostome
anterior genes [96]. This "posterior flexibility" also indicates a higher conservation of the anterior part of the clusters.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/317

Our study also shows that different Hox clusters are evolving with distinct patterns in different evolutionary lineages, even though an overall evolutionary trend can be
observed: that after duplication, one cluster retains more
genes and also the regulatory elements that go with them
while the paralogous cluster loses genes and conserved
elements concomitantly more rapidly and possibly more
easily due to relaxed constraints. Our data also demonstrate clearly that the loss of Hox genes in teleost clusters
is an ongoing process that occurred even within the last
seven million years within the cichlid family (hoxb7a). A
close comparison among different closely related genes
might also provide insight into species-specific differences
and the potential influence of regulatory evolution on different cichlid species.

Conclusion
Hox clusters in fish are more variable in gene content than
expected and also, each cluster has its own characteristics
in terms of absolute length and content of CNS. While
genes have continuously been lost, somewhat surprisingly
most microRNAs remained unchanged (with the notable
exception in the medaka lineage). The CNSs form a large
portion of Hox clusters, usually even more basepairs than
the coding regions and are, typically, conserved over very
long evolutionary time spans. Their distribution is not
constant along the cluster but the maximum frequency of
occurrence is usually towards the anterior end, implying
stronger selection on the anterior Hox gene expression
patterns, while the more posterior Hox genes are more
free to vary.

Methods
DNA extraction and PCR
DNA was extracted from muscle tissue or fins from specimens stored at -80°C following a standard phenol-chloroform protocol. PCRs were performed in 25 μl reactions
using 0.5–1 units of RedTaq (Genaxxon, Germany) and
the corresponding reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI (pH
9.0 at 25°C), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X100), 1 mM additional MgCl2, 0.6 mM dNTPs (Genaxxon,
Germany), 0.4 μM primers and for long fragments 0.1
unit of Pwo polymerase (Fermentas, Germany) was
added. PCR used an initial denaturation step at 94°C for
3 minutes, followed by 35 cycles with 20 sec at 94°C, 40
seconds at 58°C and 2.5 minutes at 68°C, and a final
extension step at 68°C for 7 minutes. PCR products were
checked on 1% agarose gels running in 1× TAE buffer containing 0.05% ethidium bromide. PCR fragments were
purified directly via spin columns (PEQLAB, Germany) or
were cut from preparative agarose gels (1%) using the gel
extraction kit (QIAGEN, Germany).

Primer design
Primers were designed in conserved regions of the coding
sequence, preferably the forward primer at the beginning
of the first exon and the reverse primer in the second exon
outside the homeodomain, so the PCR fragment would
cover the intron and yield specific fragments for screening
of the BAC library. (Primer sequences are provided in
Additional file 8).
Screening of the Astatotilapia burtoni BAC library and
plasmid preps
The BAC library was spotted on four filters containing
18,432 clones each. The screening using chemiluminescence was conducted according to Lang et al. (2006). Positive clones were picked from the library and grown
overnight in Luria Broth Base medium (Invitrogen™) containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Plasmids were isolated using a modification of a standard plasmid
miniprep protocol [97]. Gene content of the BAC clones
were confirmed by PCR for 5' and 3' most Hox/Evx genes.
For size estimation, BACs were digested with NotI and ran
on a pulse-field gel apparatus.
Shotgun sequencing of BAC clones
BAC clone DNA was isolated from each preparation, and
then sheared into random fragments of approximately 3
kb by repeated passage through a narrow aperture using a
Hydroshear device. These fragments were repaired to
blunt ends using T4 polymerase and Klenow fragment,
and then a narrow distribution of sizes was selected from
an agarose gel. These fragments were ligated into plasmid
vector, introduced into E. coli by electroporation and then
plated on nutrient agar. A random selection of these
clones was processed for sequencing reads from each end
using rolling circle amplification of the plasmids,
sequencing reactions using BigDye terminators (ABI),
cleanup using solid phase reversible immobilization
(SPRI), then sequence determination on an ABI 3730 × l
automated DNA sequencer.
Sequence assembly
Raw sequences were trimmed for vector sequences and
sequence quality was scored with Phred. Contigs were
assembled automatically using Sequencer™ using a minimal overlap of 17 nucleotides and a minimal identity of
85% and refined and corrected manually. Sequence gaps
were closed by PCR using sequence specific primers
designed with Primer3.
Annotation
Genes were annotated manually by pairwise BLAST and
based on alignments of available sequences from other
species. We also performed BLAST searches against the
EST sequences available for A. burtoni as well as two other
haplochromine cichlids (Haplochromis chilotes, Haplo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/317

chromis sp. 'red tail sheller') [98], especially for a better
annotation of adjacent non-Hox genes. BAC clone
sequences were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers EF594310–EF594316).
Database searches and phylogenetic analyses
Complete Hox cluster sequences were downloaded from
GenBank (Homo sapiens, Oryzias latipes, Takifugu rubripes)
[99], the Joint Genome Institute (Xenopus tropicalis) [100],
Ensembl (Danio rerio (Zv6), Gasterosteus aculeatus
(BROAD S1)) [101], and Genoscope (Tetrodon nigroviridis) [102] [for accession numbers see Additional file 9].
Coding sequences were aligned based on their amino acid
sequences with their respective orthologs using ClustalW
as implemented in Bioedit. Regions that could not be
aligned with confidence were omitted from the phylogenetic analyses [the final alignment is given in Additional
file 10]. For the concatenated datasets, only genes that
were available for both tetrapod outgroup species were
used (H. sapiens and X. tropicalis) as well as for all seven
fish species (A. burtoni, O. niloticus, O. latipes, G. aculeatus,
T. rubripes, T. nigroviridis, D. rerio). For genes with two paralogs in fish we selected the slower evolving copy to avoid
additional noise in the dataset. We performed a Maximum Likelihood analysis using PhyML [77]with 500
bootstrap replicates as well as an analysis based on Bayesian Inference with the MrBayes 3.1 [103] software for
1,000,000 generations and a burn-in of 5,000 with sampling every 10th generation.
Analyses of non-coding sequences
Genomic regions were prepared for analyses including 3
kb of sequence upstream of the first Hox gene and downstream of the 3'-most Hox gene. For HoxBb clusters,
sequences between ndp52 (5') and scap1 (3') were used
since D. rerio also has a Hoxb8b gene, which was lost in
all neoteleosts for which this genomic information is
available, since we wanted to avoid losing sequence information. In both pufferfish HoxCa clusters, sequences up
to the next downstream gene (cbx5) were used because
this lineage has lost hoxc3a. For species that had lost the
hoxd11b gene (Astatotilapia burtoni, Oryzias latipes)
sequence data until lnb (lunapark b) were included. For an
overview as well as for a visual display, we used mVISTA
[87] based on LAGAN multiple alignments [88]. For more
detailed analyses, we used the program Tracker [52], using
more stringent than default parameters (minimal BlastZ
score 2000, minimum identity 85%) since the sequences
analyzed here are more closely related than those used in
previous studies. Phylogenetic footprint cliques obtained
through Tracker were checked carefully for double hits of
the same alignments and microsatellites that were eliminated. Footprint cliques containing microRNAs were
identified.
