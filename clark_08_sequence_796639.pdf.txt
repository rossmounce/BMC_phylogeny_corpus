Abstract
Background: Prophages integrated within the chromosomes of Campylobacter jejuni isolates have
been demonstrated very recently. Prior work with Campylobacter temperate bacteriophages, as
well as evidence from prophages in other enteric bacteria, suggests these prophages might have a
role in the biology and virulence of the organism. However, very little is known about the genetic
variability of Campylobacter prophages which, if present, could lead to differential phenotypes in
isolates carrying the phages versus those that do not. As a first step in the characterization of C.
jejuni prophages, we investigated the distribution of prophage DNA within a C. jejuni population
assessed the DNA and protein sequence variability within a subset of the putative prophages found.
Results: Southern blotting of C. jejuni DNA using probes from genes within the three putative
prophages of the C. jejuni sequenced strain RM 1221 demonstrated the presence of at least one
prophage gene in a large proportion (27/35) of isolates tested. Of these, 15 were positive for 5 or
more of the 7 Campylobacter Mu-like phage 1 (CMLP 1, also designated Campylobacter jejuni
integrated element 1, or CJIE 1) genes tested. Twelve of these putative prophages were chosen for
further analysis. DNA sequencing of a 9,000 to 11,000 nucleotide region of each prophage
demonstrated a close homology with CMLP 1 in both gene order and nucleotide sequence.
Structural and sequence variability, including short insertions, deletions, and allele replacements,
were found within the prophage genomes, some of which would alter the protein products of the
ORFs involved. No insertions of novel genes were detected within the sequenced regions. The 12
prophages and RM 1221 had a % G+C very similar to C. jejuni sequenced strains, as well as
promoter regions characteristic of C. jejuni. None of the putative prophages were successfully
induced and propagated, so it is not known if they were functional or if they represented remnant
prophage DNA in the bacterial chromosomes.
Conclusion: These putative prophages form a family of phages with conserved sequences, and
appear to be adapted to Campylobacter. There was evidence for recombination among groups of
prophages, suggesting that the prophages had a mosaic structure. In many of these properties, the
Mu-like CMLP 1 homologs characterized in this study resemble temperate bacteriophages of
enteric bacteria that are responsible for contributions to virulence and host adaptation.

Background
Though Campylobacter spp., especially C. jejuni, have been
recognized as the most frequent cause of bacterial enteric
infection in many countries [1-3], there is a great deal yet
to learn about the ecology and pathogenesis of these
organisms. Several Campylobacter genomes have now been
fully or partially sequenced [4,5] and a number of microarray experiments have explored the genetic variability
within the genus [6-8]. However, to identify novel genes
within Campylobacter isolates of interest it will be necessary to either sequence more genomes or explore the roles
of mobile genetic elements such as transposons, plasmids,
and bacteriophages.
Lysogenic, or temperate, bacteriophages were first recovered from Campylobacter fetus (at the time known as Vibrio
fetus) in 1968 after induction with mitomycin C, induction in aging cultures, or induction using co-cultivation
methods [9]. Transduction of streptomycin resistance by
phage induced with UV light was demonstrated shortly
thereafter [10], indicating that Campylobacter temperate
bacteriophages are capable of horizontal DNA transfer.
Using co-cultivation techniques, Bryner and colleagues
[11] induced, isolated, and characterized temperate bacteriophages from 22 of 38 strains of Vibrio fetus (Campylobacter fetus). Four groups of bacteriophage from lysogenic
strains were defined on the basis of differential lysis of a
panel of test isolates [12], suggesting considerable heterogeneity in the temperate phage population. Early investigations into the role of C. jejuni in enteric disease of
children demonstrated the presence of temperate bacteriophages that mediated resistance to typing phages and
were capable of lysing a stock strain of C. jejuni [13]. These
phages caused spontaneous plaque formation of the host
bacterium. Spontaneous release of temperate bacteriophage was found to have a role in autoagglutination of
Campylobacter isolates [14].
Autoagglutinated bacteria appeared to be "leaky", and
phage tail-sheaths were associated with bacterial cells.
After this initial work there was a period in which temperate or lysogenic bacteriophages were not demonstrated in
Campylobacter spp. Several investigators attempted unsuccessfully to isolate and propagate temperate bacteriophages from C. jejuni [15,16]. However, DNA sequences
homologous to Mu and other bacteriophages were
detected in the genome of C. hyoilei [17]. The very recent
demonstration of three distinct bacteriophage integrated
into the genome of chicken isolate RM 1221 suggests that
such prophages may be common and important for the
biology of C. jejuni [4]. At least one of these three Campylobacter jejuni integrated elements (CJIEs) [6] is a Mu-like
phage inducible with mitomycin C designated either CJIE
1 or Campylobacter Mu-like phage 1 (CMLP 1). Elements

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/49

similar to these CJIEs were found quite frequently when a
large panel of isolates was tested using a DNA microarray,
and CMLP 1 appeared to integrate essentially randomly in
the genome [6]. Results from Southern blotting using
CMLP 1-homolog genes as probes also showed that this
phage appears to be capable of loss and insertion or reinsertion into different parts of the C. jejuni genome, producing changes in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
patterns [18]. Genome rearrangements in C. jejuni were
found to result from inter-genomic inversions between
Mu-like prophages; activation of dormant Mu-like
prophages subsequent to predation by virulent bacteriophage was also noted [19]. It appears that the prophages
of at least some isolates were therefore functional and
capable of lytic growth.
At the time this study was begun, there were no data available on the distribution or variability within C. jejuni of
prophages homologous to CJIE 1, 2, and 4 of RM 1221.
One of the questions we wanted to answer was whether
these Campylobacter Mu-like prophages were similar in
their heterogeneity to lambdoid prophages found, for
instance, in many of the Enterobacteraceae. In this study
we have therefore investigated the sequence diversity in
approximately 9 – 11 kb regions of twelve bacteriophages
homologous to CMLP 1 of C. jejuni strain RM 1221.
Sequence variability due to apparent insertions and deletions was detected, and results supported the concept that
these bacteriophages are modular in nature, with mosaic
genomes. There was no evidence for the presence of lambdoid prophages similar to those found in the Enterobacteriaceae.

Results
Distribution of Campylobacter CJIE ORFs
ORFs for the three CJIEs were distributed differentially
through the Campylobacter population tested (Figure 1,
Table 1). CMLP 1 homologs were detected for all genes
tested in 9 isolates, and the corresponding prophages were
presumed to be intact, though not necessarily functional.
Southern blots of 13 isolates showed no CMLP 1 gene
probe hybridization, suggesting the prophages were completely absent. One to six of the CMLP 1 genes tested were
missing in the remaining 13 isolates; some of these may
be mosaic prophages while others, especially those with
hybridization to only one or two probes, could be homologous genes from a source other than a CMLP 1-like
prophage.

There did not appear to be a strong association of CMLP 1
carriage with the source, the HS serotype, or the phylogenetic background of the isolate. CJIE 4 was found somewhat less frequently, as it was detected in 14/35 isolates.
One of the two CJIE 2 genes tested, cje0569, was also
found in 14 isolates; however, the second ORF (cje0544)

was detected in only 3 isolates. No sequences with homology to λ phage were found in any of the isolates tested in
Southern blotting experiments.
All CMLP 1 gene homologs used for Southern blot experiments were found in two isolates from bovine stools, but
were completely absent from other bovine isolates. The
single isolate from a chicken that carried a CMLP 1
homolog was either missing some of the genes found in
the RM 1221 prophage or had genes that were divergent
in at least two regions of its sequence. Both ovine isolates
did not appear to carry the phage, though one had a single
phage gene homolog.
Sequence analysis of CMLP 1 homologs
On the basis of the results of the Southern blot experiments described above, 12 isolates were chosen for
sequence analysis of putative prophages homologous to
CMLP 1. Our intent was to determine whether there was
any sequence variability among these prophages and char-

acterize the nature and extent of the changes present. If
warranted, a subset of the prophages would then be completely sequenced at a later date. Since virulence genes are
often inserted among the late genes of bacteriophage λ
[20-23], we decided to sequence the region of the
prophage containing genes for the prophage tail components, tail tape measure protein and virion morphogenesis protein.
Approximately 10 – 11 kb (~30%) of each prophage,
equivalent to a region from about cje0215 to cje0232 of
the RM 1221 genome, was sequenced by PCR amplification of approximately 1 – 3 kb fragments of the integrated
phage genomes followed by chromosomal walking to fill
in the complete sequence. In the case of isolate NC 13266
an amplicon was not obtained for the region adjacent to
the cje0220 homolog, so that the sequenced region is
shorter than those of the other CMLP 1 homologs. Different primer sets were used to obtain PCR amplicons from
this region for the two main groups of isolates. Primer sets

phs5 and phs6 proved capable of amplifying DNA from
the group containing NC 13255, NC 13265, and other
isolates, while the pcc1 primer set was used to amplify
product from members of the group containing the Walkerton outbreak strain 1 isolates. The % G+C of the
sequenced regions of the 12 prophages and the homologous region of RM 1221 CMLP 1 ranged from 30.66 to
31.93.
The phylogenetic relationships among the CMLP 1
homologs are shown in Figure 2. The figure shows the
relationships of the untrimmed sequences of all 12
prophages; a figure using all sequences (except that of NC
13266) trimmed to the same length was indistinguishable
except for the lack of NC 13266 (data not shown). Three
separate groupings were detected. One group contained
the sequences of CMLP 1 homologs from the three Walk-

93

erton outbreak strain 1 isolates 00–2425, 00–2538, and
00–2544, which were indistinguishable over the entire
length of the sequence tested. One of the MLST reference
isolates, NC 13256, was also included in this group, as
was isolate 00–3477. These latter two isolates had quite
different STs, flaA SVR sequence types, and HS serotypes
from the other isolates in this group. A second group of
related prophage sequences included all other isolates
except NC 13266, which constituted a group of its own.
The major structural features of the CMLP 1 homologs
from all 12 isolates are compared with CMLP 1 in Figure
3. Isolate NC 13265 showed the strongest homology with
CMLP 1 over its entire length. All other isolates had a 372
nucleotide region of divergent sequence in homologs to
cje0231, which encodes the phage tail fiber protein H. The
% G+C of the 372 bp insert was 37.94, much higher than

the % G+C of the sequenced part of these prophages or of
the Campylobacter chromosome as a whole. Isolates
00–2425, 00–2538, and 00–2544 had identical sequences
in this insert. Other isolates had slightly less identity for
this 372 bp insert: 98% in 00–3477, NC 13256, and NC
13266; 97% identity in 99–7046, 00–6470, and
NC13255; and 96% identity in isolates 00–0949 and
00–2828. There were no other sequences closely related to
this insert sequence found in BLAST (blastn) searches of
the nr/nt database. The next most closely related oligonucleotide was a 58 bp sequence from the Mus musculis chromosome (accession number gb/AC163020.9/) that had
88% identity with the Campylobacter sequence.
The group of sequences that included the three Walkerton
outbreak strain 1 isolates had a common 1068 nucleotide
region of divergent sequence within cje0222 (tail tape
measure protein). The % G+C of the insertion in isolate
00–2425 was 34.93, higher than the 31.66 % G+C of the
entire sequenced part of this putative prophage. This

insertion had an identical sequence over its entire length
in isolates 00–2525, 00–2544, 00–2538, and NC 13256,
and was 99% identical over its entire length with isolate
00–3477. These isolates were the only ones that had such
a high degree of homology in BLAST (blastn) searches of
the nr/nt database; the next most closely related sequence
was a 58 nt fragment from a 2043 bp phage-related tail
gene of a Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster (accession number gb/AF420275.1/AF420275).
Isolate NC 13266 had a different region of divergent
sequence (648 nucleotides) with a % G+C of 25.89 that
incorporated one end of cje0222 and adjacent genes.
While the first 335 bp of this showed moderate homology
with the homologous region in the other prophages,
including RM 1221, the final 310 bp had no homology to
any sequences in the nr/nt database and had a 22.58%
G+C. Finally, all sequences in the group containing Walkerton outbreak strain 1 isolates, plus NC 13255, had a
common divergent sequence of 43 nucleotides after the

ORF homologous to cje0231. This short sequence had no
homology to the consensus sequence of the other strains
and only low homology to any other sequences in the nr/
nt database.
Insertions of different sizes and at different locations were
detected in NC 13266 (48 nucleotides), in NC13255 (43
nucleotides in cje0228), and 00–2818 (24 nucleotides
near cje0229). Deletions were also found. A common
deletion of 98 nucleotides was found in CMLP 1
homologs from 00–2425, 00–2538, 00–2544, 00–3477,
NC 13255 and NC 13266. Isolate 00–2818 had a 120
nucleotide deletion within cje0220 and NC 13255 had an
88 nucleotide deletion near cje0229. In addition to the 98
nucleotide deletion described above, the CMLP 1
homolog of isolate NC 13266 had a 39 nucleotide deletion at the end of cje0230. It should be noted that, in addition to the insertions and deletions, all CMLP 1 homolog
sequences contained single nucleotide changes not apparent on the schematic diagram shown in Figure 3.
Consistent with these major structural features, split
decomposition analysis of the 12 partial prophage
genomes exhibited a reticulate structure suggestive of
extensive recombination among this population (data not
shown).
Presence of promoter elements upstream of open reading
frames (ORFs) homologous to ORFs from isolate RM 1221
CMLP 1 from RM 1221 appeared to produce functional
lytic phage particles [4] suggesting that the genes required
for both the lysogenic and lytic life cycle were functional.
However, we were unable to successfully induce and
propagate any of the putative prophages in our isolates;
these prophages may or may not be functional, and may
represent remnant phage DNA present in the bacterial
chromosome. Since there appeared to be a fair bit of DNA
sequence diversity within our CMLP 1 homologs, we were
interested in determining whether the predicted ORFs
within the partial sequences of these prophage homologs
included known Campylobacter promoter elements.

Most of the ORFs encoding genes with putative bacteriophage functions were preceded by the consensus ribosome binding sequence (AAGGA) for C. jejuni [24] in all
isolates. Prophage ORFs with this sequence at the appropriate position in the promoter included cje0231, cje230
(except in isolate NC 13265), cje0228, cje0227, cje0226,
cje0219, cje0217, and cje0216.
For the ORFs encoding the putative cje0220 homolog the
situation was a little more complicated. In isolates
99–7046, 00–0949, 00–2818, 00–6470, NC 132355, and
NC 13265 this ORF had four possible alternative start
sites with the start codons TTG (beginning with amino

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/49

acids LHSKEWSG...), GTG (beginning with amino acids
VAFSDAT...), and ATG (providing the start for two
sequence variants, one beginning with the amino acids
MARKTKA and the other encoding the sequence homologous to that of the RM 1221 ORF beginning with
MKNNT...). Only the GTG and latter ATG start codons
were preceded by the consensus ribosome binding
sequence. In the cje0220 homolog of isolates 00–2425,
00–2538, 00–2544, 00–3477, NC13256, and NC 13266
there were two predicted start sites; the first producing a
peptide beginning with "MARK..." and the second producing the RM 1221-like peptide beginning with
"MKNNT...". Both start sites were preceded by appropriate
ribosome binding sequences, though their placement relative to the start codon differed.
For some other ORFs the consensus ribosome binding
sequence was not present adjacent to the putative start
codon, and possible ribosome binding sites containing a
suitable combination of "A"s and "G"s – preferably containing a GG dinucleotide – were sought. The cje0229
homolog in each putative prophage was preceded by a
sequence consisting of GGGAGAG, while each cje0225
homolog was preceded by GGGCA, cje0224 by AGAGG,
cje0222 by AAAGGG in all isolates except NC 13266, and
cje0221 by ATGGA. Only the promoter regions of cje0218
homologs were devoid of a sequence resembling the consensus ribosome binding site or one of the potential ribosome binding sites proposed here.
The -10, -16, and -35 regions of Campylobacter promoters
are quite heterogeneous in both sequence and placement
[24]. For this reason, only sequences identical to one of
these 12 experimentally determined -10 sequences were
sought within 100 nucleotides of the (putative) start
codon(s). cje0231 homologs in all isolates were preceded
by the C. jejuni sodB -10 sequence, TAATATT. A 2A12,
proA-like -10 sequence was found preceding cje0226,
cje0222, and only the ATG start codon encoding the
"MKNNT..." start site of cje0220. The other two potential
start sites for this ORF were not preceded by any of the
known -10 promoter sequences.
cje0230 from all isolates except NC 13265 carried the
orf1-like -10 promoter sequence, TATCTTT. Isolate NC
13265 had three different -10 sequences in its promoter
region; these were identical to the sequences determined
for sodB (TAATATT), ileS (TAGAATT), and glyA (TATTGTT). All cje0225 ORFs were preceded by the lysS -10 oligonucleotide (TTTAAAC), while cje0221 was preceded by
the 23ES-like sequence (TACAATT) and cje0217 by the
1G9-like sequence (TATATTA). A large proportion of the
ORFs identified may therefore be expressed though, once
again, there is no evidence yet that these putative
prophages are capable of being induced. ORFs corre-

sponding to cje0229, cje0228, cje0227, cje0224, cje0219,
cje0218, and cje0216 did not have any of the experimentally determined -10 promoter sequences upstream of the
start codon. It is possible that many of these ORFs carry
alternative -10 sequences.
Variability of protein sequences and evidence for a
modular structure of CMLP 1 homologs
Translations were obtained using DNA sequences for each
ORF corresponding to a CMLP 1 gene, and the resulting
peptides were compared. Results of phylogenetic analysis
of these proteins are shown in Figure 4. Translation products from CMLP 1 in isolate RM 1221 were included in the
analysis, as were proteins from isolates 260.94 and CF936 that were identified in BLAST searches using the translated peptides from each CMLP 1 homolog, in each of the
12 isolates, as query sequences.

Most of the available prophage sequence was occupied
with open reading frames corresponding to the CMLP 1
genes identified previously [4]. As noted in the previous
section many, but not all, of the proteins homologous to
those from CMLP 1 had readily identified consensus
ribosome binding sequences [24]; fewer had clearly identifiable -10 consensus sequences. Full-length proteins
were present in all cases but one (see below), indicating
that there were no major errors in sequencing that
resulted in abnormally truncated proteins. It should be
noted that, because of the lack of variation in DNA
sequences, the protein sequences of CMLP 1 homologs
from isolates 00–2338 and 00–2544 are represented here
by the sequence from 00–2425, to which they were identical.
Differences noted in the DNA sequence were apparent as
differences in the translated protein products. The largest
possible open reading frame present in cje0216 of isolate
00–2818 was 28 amino acids longer at the N-terminus
than any of the cje0216 proteins from other isolates.
Interesting variations were found in cje0220, which produces a protein with homology to a DNA adenine methylase. The DNA insertion within this gene in NC 13266
produced a region of peptide homology with cje0220 of
strain 260.94, which was quite different from all other
cje0220 peptides. Only a partial protein sequence was
obtained for the cje0220 homolog in NC 13266. The 120nucleotide deletion within cje0220 of 00–2818 resulted
in an in-frame deletion within the C-terminal third of the
protein. Four possible start sites were evident in cje0220
proteins from isolates 00–0949, 00–2818, 00–3477, NC
132356, and NC 13265, especially when the alternative
start codons (UUG/TTG and GUG/GTG), known to be
functional in both C. jejuni and in Mu phages [24,25],
were used. The first site would produce proteins begin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/49

ning with a leucine, while the second would produce proteins beginning at the same site as in strain CF93-6, but
beginning with a valine. The third putative start site would
produce proteins beginning with a methionine (MARK...)
that were 20 amino acids shorter than the first site, while
the fourth start site would result in proteins beginning
with a methionine at the same start site as cje0220 in RM
1221, an additional 26 amino acids shorter than proteins
beginning at the second putative start site. Isolates other
than those noted above had only the third and fourth
putative start sites. It is not clear whether all these putative
start sites are actually functional, but they do suggest the
potential for additional variability based on fine sequence
variation.
Variability was also evident in the protein sequences of
cje0222, which was homologous to phage tail tape measure proteins. The C-terminal third of the protein was
highly conserved in all sequences. In isolate NC 13266 the
remaining sequence was very similar to that of strain
260.94 (see also Figure 4), consistent with the DNA
sequence divergence noted previously and shown in Figure 3. The DNA sequence divergence identified in the
group of isolates related to the Walkerton outbreak strain
1 isolates was apparent as a region of 336 amino acids that
was conserved among these isolates and different from
proteins in other strains. Interestingly, this 336 amino
acid region had frequent, regular, periodic stretches of
sequence identity with all the other proteins, perhaps necessary to maintain the overall structure and conserve the
function of the protein.
Most peptide sequences of cje0228 were very similar,
except that isolates 00–2425 (plus 00–2538 and
00–2544), 00–3477, NC 13255, and strain RM 1221
replaced the consensus C terminal peptide of KYKKM
with NTKVKK. Interestingly, the 43 nucleotide insertion
into cje0228 of NC 13255 translated into a C-terminal
peptide extension of QKIQKIQKIQKIQKIQKM, a change
one might expect would have some effect on protein function. Cje0229 of NC 13255 also had a C-terminal extension different from all the other proteins, which were
quite conserved overall. The cje0230 peptide sequence
was conserved except for the 13 amino acid deletion in
NC 13266 corresponding to the 39 nucleotide in-frame
deletion in the DNA of this isolate. The C-terminal third
of cje0231 from RM 1221 and NC 13265 was different
from the corresponding protein in all other isolates,
which were very similar.
Homologs of proteins cje0217, cje0218, cje0219,
cje0223, cje0224, cje0226, and cje0227 were remarkably
well conserved overall, suggesting that the complete peptide sequence was required for the proper function of at
least some of these proteins.

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:49

Phylogenetic comparisons for each protein (Figures 4, 5,
6) suggest that the CMLP 1-homologous prophages are
mosaics of proteins/genes from different sources. Further
evidence for the modularity of the CMLP 1 ORF homologs
characterized in this study was demonstrated by performing BLASTP searches with each protein from each CMLP 1
homolog. The closest match was determined by the smallest E value. The phages appear to be mosaics, with different putative proteins similar to those from RM 1221,
strain 93-6, and strain 260.94 (Table 2).
It should be noted that a number of additional potential
ORFs producing translation products between 3,000 and
10,000 Daltons were detected, especially when alternative
start codons were included in the analyses. For the most
part these overlapped the previously characterized proteins on the opposite strand and lacked clearly identifiable ribosome binding sites, and so are not discussed in
detail here. Examples include two ORFs that were found
in most or all prophage sequences, encoded in the
00–2425 prophage by nucleotides 1680 to1979 and by
nucleotides 2487 to 2729. If expressed, these ORFs would
produce proteins with molecular masses of 7,653 and
8,369, respectively, that have no homology with any
known peptide sequences. In contrast, an ORF encoded
by nucleotides 2928 to 3167 of isolate 00–2425 appeared
to be present only in 00–2425, 00–2538, 00–2544,
00–3477, and NC 13256. This ORF, if expressed and functional, could contribute to differences in biology among
the two groups of isolates.

Discussion
The finding of CJIEs 1, 2, and 4 in a number of Campylobacter isolates confirms the observation of Parker et al. [6]
that these elements appear to be quite widespread in the
population. These elements also appeared to be present in
similar proportions of the population in the present work
and that of Parker et al. [6].
Prophages homologous to CMLP 1 from strain RM 1221
were found in 4/6 isolates of Walkerton outbreak strain 1,
suggesting that the rate of loss or gain of this bacteriophage may be quite high, as previously suggested [18].
The fact that two of the Walkerton outbreak strain 1 isolates lacked prophage could mean that the prophage had
no effect on virulence of the isolates. However, it is not
know whether the prophage was lost from these isolates
before infecting humans or upon culture and subculture
in the laboratory; no firm conclusions on the association
of the presence of the prophage and the virulence of isolates can be drawn. The prophage was also not found in
the single human isolate of Walkerton outbreak strain 2
(00–2533) tested, and was not present in a number of
other isolates obtained from human stools. However, too
few animal isolates were tested to draw any conclusions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/49

about the association of CMLP 1 and its homologs with
particular hosts.
It was interesting that no lysogenic phage DNA homologous to phage λ was found in the genome of any isolate,
as this phage family plays the predominant role in the
pathogenesis of many members of the Enterobacteraceae.
C. jejuni and C. coli share environmental niches, including
the human intestinal environment, with Salmonella and E.
coli isolates carrying lambdoid prophages partially
responsible for the virulence of these organisms. The complete absence of lambdoid prophages from Campylobacter,
if proven true in the long term, could indicate that these
bacteria lack receptors for infection by lambdoid phages,
that there are effective barriers to lysogeny by these
phages, or that the genes carried by these phages do not
provide a sufficient selective advantage to the organism to
be stably maintained in the population.
If one assumes that the presence of genes from the beginning, middle, and end of CJIE 4 indicates the presence of
the whole element, it can be seen that this element is
present in a number of isolates from which CMLP 1 (CJIE
1) is absent. This in turn indicates that these elements can
be inherited independently, though the data do not allow
a distinction between the existence of CJIE 4 as a mobile
element versus the differential carriage of the two elements through gain or loss of CJIE 1. Results from Southern blots using probes to CJIE 2 are somewhat more
difficult to interpret due to the fact that the two genes
tested are present in different frequencies in the population. Future work will concentrate on this element alone.
Phages homologous to CMLP 1 were found in 4 of 13 reference isolates from the UK that represent much of the
variability within C. jejuni found by MLST [26]. The isolates carrying these genes were from different geographic
sources than either strain RM 1221 or the isolates analyzed in this work, suggesting that variants of this bacteriophage are widely distributed in C. jejuni populations and
that the phage may have been acquired early in the evolution of this organism. It was considered somewhat surprising, therefore, that only three major groups of CMLP
1 homologs were found when DNA sequences were analyzed phylogenetically. Sequence comparisons indicated
that the CMLP 1 homolog carried by isolate NC 13266
showed evidence of recombination with the other two
groups of phage as well as the acquisition and incorporation of novel DNA sequences. This was supported by our
inability to obtain sequence further upstream of the
cje0220 gene with primers that produced PCR amplicons
from other isolates, a finding that suggests that this region
contains unique DNA sequences in NC 13266. The NC
13266 CMLP 1 homolog appeared to be highly related to
strain 260.94 in all proteins for which sequence was avail-

sequencing further regions of NC 13266 using strain
260.94 sequences for developing PCR primers.
CMLP 1 homologs from isolates 00–2425, 00–2538,
00–2544, 00–3477, and NC 13256 had similar structural
features, including a 98 bp deletion and a 1068 bp
sequence quite distinct from the analogous sequence in
CMLP 1. This 1068 bp sequence, as well as a 372 bp
sequence replacement common to most prophages analyzed in this study, had a somewhat higher % G+C than
the overall prophage sequence and the C. jejuni genome as
a whole, suggesting that these sequences were acquired

from an organism other than C. jejuni. Recombination
appeared to have a major role in the diversification of the
prophages under study. Because the 372 bp replacement
sequence was found in all prophages except NC 13265
and RM 1221, we would speculate that this event may
have occurred first in the evolution of the prophages studied here. The 43 bp replacement was present in only a subset of these prophages, and would appear to have been
acquired later. Finally, the 1068 bp replacement was
found in only a small subgroup containing the three
Walkerton outbreak isolates, suggesting that it was
acquired last. Most of the insertions and deletions appear
to be strain-specific, and suggest fairly frequent changes in

the prophage DNA sequence. The finding of the 98 bp
deletion in both NC 13266 (in the absence of the 43 bp
replacement) and in the group containing the Walkerton
isolates (which all contained the 43 bp replacement) suggests that at least some of the prophage sequence changes
could be modified by additional recombination events.
This makes the construction of a tidy evolutionary tree difficult for these integrated bacteriophages.
The 100% sequence identity of isolates 00–2425,
00–2538, and 00–2544 supports the classification of
these isolates as clones of the Walkerton outbreak strain 1
[18,27]. The other Canadian isolate from this group,
00–3477, was recovered in Ontario but, in typing studies,
had different genetic and phenotypic characteristics from

the Walkerton outbreak strain 1 isolates. The final isolate
(NC 13256) with a DNA sequence similar to this group
was recovered in the UK in 1991, and so represents an isolate from quite a different geographic location and time. It
seems as though the different prophage families characterized in this work have become geographically widespread.
Though the sampling of putative prophages included here
is very small and only part of the phage genome was
sequenced in each case, it is reasonable to conclude that
there is a global distribution of Campylobacter temperate
phages with similar sequences. It is also possible that
there are more families of sequence variants yet to be discovered.

It was interesting that the start codons preceding ORFs in
most prophage genes, including those of CMLP 1 in RM
1221, were identical to consensus start codons for Campylobacter. Since CMLP 1 was previously induced from RM
1221 [4], this observation suggests that at least some of
the prophage homologs found in other isolates may also
be competent for induction and the subsequent produc-

tion of infectious phages. It also suggests that these Mulike prophages are well adapted to Campylobacter and that
Campylobacter may be the preferred or unique host of
these phages, an hypothesis supported by the fact that the
% G + C of the sequenced part of the prophages is very
close to that of previously sequenced C. jejuni genomes
(30.6% G+C for NCTC11168 [5] and 30.31% for RM

1221 [4]). At this time, however, we have no experimental
evidence to support this possibility, and the prophage
DNA in these isolates may be part of inactive prophage
remnants. Induction of prophages and infection of
Campylobacter spp. and other genera with the resulting
infectious bacteriophage particles will be the subject of
future work.
The effect of variations in phage DNA sequence on the
resulting protein sequence was readily apparent. Some
proteins had amino acid sequences quite different from
the corresponding RM 1221 sequence, so much so that
one would expect the function of the protein to be highly
modified or abrogated. Most insertions and deletions
were in-frame, so that a full-length protein was made. In
these cases, it is possible that the expressed proteins might
have modified function. Several proteins appeared to
have potential N-terminal extensions compared with the
RM 1221 homolog, though it is not clear whether these
would be included in the final protein product. Alternate
start codons were responsible for the possible presence of
some of these N-terminal peptide extensions. These data
confirm observations previously submitted by others to
GenBank for isolate CF93-6. Further proteomics and functional studies will be necessary to answer some of the
questions raised by the sequence analysis presented here
and elsewhere.

subset of the prophages discussed here. It would also be of
interest to determine, using expression DNA microarrays,
quantitative RT-PCR, and 2D-DIGE, whether prophage
genes are expressed and whether the presence of integrated Mu-like prophages affects the expression of Campylobacter chromosomal genes. Initial work can be done
using a naturally occurring strain pair with and without
the prophage [18], though ideally isogenic strains would
be created by phage transduction of a prophage-negative
isolate. The fact that these prophages appear to be fairly
common suggests that they confer biological properties
that can be advantageous to the bacterial host under some
circumstances. Determining what those circumstances are
may provide valuable insight into the biology and virulence of human-pathogenic Campylobacter.

Conclusion
CMLP 1 and its homologs appear to represent a temperate
bacteriophage family that is widely distributed and frequently carried within the Campylobacter jejuni population. Phages in this family appear to have undergone
some differentiation, and may be continuing to evolve.
Future studies are required to understand how these bacteriophages interact with their host bacteria, and what
implications this has for the pathogenesis, ecology, survival, and growth of these bacteria.

Methods
Bacteriophages have critically important roles in genome
diversification and the evolution of virulence and host
adaptation of other enteric bacteria [20,23,28,29]. Genes
encoding Shiga toxins (Stx) 1 and 2 are found on lambdoid phages in Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli, while similar Gifsy and Fels phages encode a number of virulence
factors in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [21].
Some of these prophage-encoded S. Typhimurium proteins are effectors translocated into eucaryotic cells by type
three secretion systems encoded at other locations in the
chromosome [30]. In addition to carrying genes encoding
virulence factors, integrated prophage can affect gene
expression of the host bacterium [31,32]. While much less
is known about the role(s) of Mu phages than lambdoid
phages in enteric bacteria, it is possible that Mu phages
also affect the biology and virulence of their host in similar ways. This work shows that the putative Campylobacter
prophages exhibit at least some of the properties, including a modular or mosaic structure, in common with
prophages from other enteric bacteria, thereby supporting
the possibility that they may also have similar functions in
virulence and the biology of the bacteria. No morons that
could be novel virulence genes were found during the partial sequencing of the CMLP 1 prophage homologs in C.
jejuni isolates. To address whether additional novel genes
might be present in other parts of the prophage, future
work will involve completion of the DNA sequences of a

previously characterized as part of investigations into a
large Canadian water-borne outbreak [27]. C. jejuni MLST
reference isolates representing most of the major clonal
complexes of this organism [26] were purchased from the
National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC; London,
U.K.) and are designated with "NC" before the isolate
number in Table 3. K. Rahn at the Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses, Guelph, Ontario, Canada provided the
genome sequenced-strain RM 1221 [4]. All isolates were
stored in glycerol peptone water (25% v/v glycerol, 10 g/
L neopeptone, 5 g/L NaCl) at -80°C. Cultures were grown
on Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid Inc., Nepean, Ontario,
Canada) containing 10% sheep erythrocytes at either
37°C or 42°C in a microaerobic atmosphere (10% CO2,
5% O2, and 85% N2).
PCR and DNA sequencing
Template DNA was prepared from bacteria using the PureGene™ Genomic DNA purification kit (Gentra Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA from strain RM 1221 was used as a
positive control in all reactions and strains NCTC 11168
and 81–176 were used as negative controls. A control in
which water was substituted for DNA template was

included in all runs. 100 μl PCR reaction mixtures consisted of 1× PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μM of each
primer, 0.2 mM dNTP mix, 200 to 1000 ng of template
DNA, and 5 U FastStart DNA polymerase (Roche, Laval,
PQ, Canada). PCR was performed using a Perkin Elmer
2400 thermocycler. Denaturation and annealing times
were 1 min each, while extension times were 1 min for
amplicons less than 1 kb and 3 min for products larger
than that. Products were electrophoresed on 1.5 % agarose gels then purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) or Montage™
PCR Centrifugal Filter Devices (Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Edmonton, AB, Canada) according to the manufacturers'
instructions. Sequencing reactions were run using Big Dye
Terminator 3.1 Cycle Sequencing kits (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sequencing was performed using
an ABI 3100 or 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Some investigators have had difficulties inducing Campylobacter prophages and keeping them in a form suitable
for transducing recipient strains [15,16]. We therefore
adopted a strategy of amplifying fragments of the
prophage of approximately one to three kb and sequencing the products. The primers used to amplify the PCR
products were also used for the initial sequencing reactions for that product; subsequent sequencing was based
on walking the chromosome using primers made to newly
sequenced regions of the phages. PCR primers and
annealing conditions can be found in Table 4.
Southern blotting
Southern blotting was done using bacteria embedded in
plugs essentially according to the methods for manual
ribotyping of Clark et al. [33]. Bacterial cultures were
grown for 48 at 37°C on Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid
Inc., Nepean, Ontario, Canada) containing 10% sheep
erythrocytes in a microaerobic atmosphere (10% CO2, 5%
O2, and 85% N2). Bacteria were embedded in 1.2%
Seakem Gold agarose (Mandel Scientific Co. Inc., Guelph,
Ontario, Canada) plugs and these plugs were digested to
lyse bacterial cells using the standardized CDC protocol
[34]. Three-quarters of each original plug was equilibrated
for 1 h with 1 × buffer H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals,
Laval, Quebec, Canada). Digestion of DNA was accomplished by adding 40 U Pst I and 1.0 μl of a 0.5 mg/ml
RNase solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval,
Quebec, Canada) in a total volume of 100 μl followed by
an incubation period of 4 h at 37°C. Finally, the intact
plugs containing digested DNA were equilibrated with 0.5
ml of 0.5X TBE (10 × TBE was obtained from SigmaAldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, Ontario, Canada) for 15
min at room temperature and placed into a 1% agarose
gel. Samples were electrophoresed for 18 h at 60 volts in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/49

0.5 × TBE. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and blotted using a Vacugene XL blotting
apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ltd., Baie
d'Urfé, Quebec, Canada). Blotting was performed according to protocol No.1 of the manufacturer's instructions.
Blots were cross-linked using UV and probed with 500 ng
of labelled probe and 100 ng of labelled λ DNA.
Probes were generated by PCR amplification of bacteriophage genes from either C. jejuni strains RM 1221 or isolate 00–2544 using the primers and conditions listed in
Table 4. Primers were designed based on the bacteriophage genes present in RM 1221 (GenBank accession
number NC_003912), amplified by PCR, and purified as
summarized above. Probes (amplification products) were
sent to the DNA Core Facility at the National Microbiology Laboratory for DNA sequence analysis to confirm the
identity of the product prior to use in hybridizations.
Probe preparation, hybridization and detection were performed using the AlkPhos direct labelling and CDP-Star
detection system (Amersham, GE Healthcare, Baie D'Urfe,
PQ, Canada) under low stringency conditions according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Strains RM 1221,
NCTC 11168, and 81–176 were included on blots as positive and negative controls; RM 1221 was included on
each blot analyzed, while NCTC 11168 and 81–176 were
present only on one set of blots. The size standard used
was DNA Molecular Weight Marker II (bacteriophage
lambda [λ] DNA cut with Hind III; Roche). All blots were
also developed using only λ DNA as a probe. This provided a test for the presence of λ prophages and further
served to ensure that no bands due to potentially lysogenic lambda phages were seen when blots were developed with probes for RM 1221 phage genes.
Analysis of DNA and protein sequences
Sequence assembly and editing were done using Seqman™
and EditSeq™ in the Lasergene DNASTAR™ version 5.06
software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, Wis). The sequences
obtained had at least two strands in opposite directions,
while some regions had four or five overlapping contigs.

Sequences were saved as FASTA (.fas) files. After entry into
MEGA™ 3.1 [35] the sequences were aligned using Clustal
W and dendrograms were constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method with Kimura 2 parameter. The
robustness of branches was tested with bootstrapping
using 1000 simulations. Protein sequences were similarly
entered into the software and analyzed. Blast searches of
database nr were carried out through the NCBI website
[36] and E values were used to determine the known peptide most closely matching the protein(s) of interest. Split
decomposition analysis was performed using the program
Splitstree™ 4.0 using only parsimony informative sites.

Prophages were searched for the presence of known ribosome binding sites and -10 promoter sequences [21]. Additional sequences were tentatively identified as possible
ribosome binding sites if they: 1) contained a mixture of
A and G residues; 2) were found no further than 10 nucleotides upstream of the putative start codon of each open
reading frame (ORF); and 3) were conserved in a majority
of promoters for each ORF. Each of the individual -10 promoter regions identified previously by Wösten et al. [24]
was considered to be present and potentially active if it
was located no further than 100 nucleotides upstream of
the putative start site. Several open reading frames had
more than one potential start codon, especially when the
alternate start codons UUG/TTG and GUG/GTG known to
be used by Campylobacter [24] and Mu [25] were included
in the analysis.
