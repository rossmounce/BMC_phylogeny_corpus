Strain-specific copy number variation in the
intelectin locus on the 129 mouse chromosome 1

Abstract
Background: C57BL/6J mice possess a single intelectin (Itln) gene on chromosome 1. The function of intelectins is
not well understood, but roles have been postulated in insulin sensitivity, bacterial recognition, intestinal lactoferrin
uptake and response to parasites and allergens. In contrast to C57BL/6J mice, there is evidence for expansion of
the Itln locus in other strains and at least one additional mouse Itln gene product has been described. The aim of
this study was to sequence and characterise the Itln locus in the 129S7 strain, to determine the nature of the
chromosomal expansion and to inform possible future gene deletion strategies.
Results: Six 129S7 BAC clones were sequenced and assembled to generate 600 kbp of chromosomal sequence,
including the entire Itln locus of approximately 500 kbp. The locus contained six distinct Itln genes, two CD244
genes and several Itln- and CD244-related pseudogenes. It was approximately 433 kbp larger than the
corresponding C57BL/6J locus. The expansion of the Itln locus appears to have occurred through multiple
duplications of a segment consisting of a full-length Itln gene, a CD244 (pseudo)gene and an Itln pseudogene
fragment. Strong evidence for tissue-specific distribution of Itln variants was found, indicating that Itln duplication
contributes more than a simple gene dosage effect.
Conclusions: We have characterised the Itln locus in 129S7 mice to reveal six Itln genes with distinct sequence
and expression characteristics. Since C57BL/6J mice possess only a single Itln gene, this is likely to contribute to
functional differences between C57BL/6J and other mouse strains.

Background
Intelectins are glycoproteins with an approximate subunit
size of 37 kDa, that have been described in mammals, fish
and amphibians. The genome sequence of the sea squirt
Ciona intestinalis [1] shows the presence of closelyrelated genes, indicating that intelectins arose early in
chordate evolution. In mammals, intelectins have so far
been described in humans [2-4], mice [5,6], sheep [7],
cattle [8] and pigs [9], although interestingly, the dog
genome [10] apparently lacks any intelectin genes.
The three-dimensional structures of intelectins have
not yet been elucidated. Much of the predicted protein
sequence is highly conserved across species, including
eight cysteine residues and a fibrinogen-like domain
[11]. There has been significant interest in the functions
of intelectins, which appear to be many and varied.
A Ca2+-dependent galactose-specific lectin activity was

first detected in Xenopus intelectins, such as XL35 [12],
which subsequently led to the naming of the family as
“intelectins” (intestinal lectins) following the detection of
a closely-related gene in mouse small intestinal Paneth
cells by Komiya et al. [5]. Due to the cellular localisation
of expression of this gene, currently denoted Itln1 or
Itlna, a role in innate immunity was postulated.
Human and mouse intelectins were shown to bind
lactoferrin [3,13], leading to the alternative nomenclature of “intestinal lactoferrin receptor” (Lfr). Additionally, transcripts identical to human intelectin-1 (Itln1)
were detected in omental fat tissue, and termed omentin
by Yang et al. [14]. These authors and others [15] have
investigated the metabolic significance of Itln1, which is
present in blood plasma and is thought to function as
an adipocytokine. Circulating levels are inversely correlated to body mass index [15] and to occurrence of
type-1 diabetes mellitus [16]. A single nucleotide polymorphism in Itln1 has also been implicated in susceptibility to Crohn’s disease [17], and a closely-linked

coding SNP was also found to be associated with incidence of asthma [18].
Intelectin expression in the gut and lung mucosa is
known to be highly up-regulated in the immune response
to parasitic infections and Th2-cytokine dominated allergic
responses [19-22]. Whilst Itln1 is expressed in Paneth cells
at a high level in normal mouse small intestine, infection of
BALB/c mice with the small intestinal dwelling helminth
Trichinella spiralis, induced de novo expression of an additional gene termed intelectin-2 (Itln2) in goblet cells, which
was secreted into the mucus layer [6]. This gene, alternatively termed Itlnb, is absent from the reference C57BL/6J
genome, and it was suggested that lack of Itln2/Itlnb may
be partially responsible for the delayed expulsion of
T. spiralis in C57BL/6J mice compared to BALB/c [6].
In a subsequent genome-wide screen for gene copy number variation (CNV), Graubert et al. [23] highlighted the
Itln locus on distal chromosome 1 as a hotspot of gene
duplication in most mouse strains analysed. Gene duplication [24] represents an evolutionary mechanism whereby
populations can adapt to increase the effective dosage of an
advantageous gene in the face of a particular selection pressure, such as the burden of intestinal parasites. Once fixed,
duplicated genes (paralogs) can evolve distinct functions. In
the context of responses to parasites, a notable example of
gene duplication in the mouse is at the mast cell proteinase
locus on chromosome 14 [25]. Mast cell proteinases contribute anti-parasite effector mechanisms, and the gene Mcpt1
has been shown to enhance expulsion of T. spiralis [26].
In this study, we aimed to sequence the Itln locus in a
non-C57BL/6J strain, in order to characterise the nature
and extent of duplication of mouse Itln genes. We
focussed on the 129S7 mouse, as a BAC library was
available for this strain [27], which is commonly used in
gene deletion studies, and this information would enable
the design of future specific Itln knockout strategies.

Results
Sequencing of 129S7 Itln locus

The Itln locus on chromosome 1 of the Celera mouse
assembly [28] shows multiple copies of Itln genes as

compared to that of the C57BL/6J reference genome.
However, it is an assembly consisting of a mix of 5 different mouse strains (129X1/SvJ, 129S1/SvImJ, DBA/2J,
A/J and C57BL/6J) and there are about 43 kbp of gaps
on this locus. To improve on the annotation and resolve
the exact structure of the 129S7 Itln copy number variations, 4 flanking bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
clones were sequenced to a depth of ~4.7× using the
conventional Sanger sequencing method while the
remaining middle two were sequenced to a much
greater depth of ~300× using the Illumina paired-end
sequencing method. In view of the expected repetitive
nature of the Itln locus, the use of this tiling path
sequencing strategy was necessary to minimise errors in
the assembly. Nevertheless, several gaps estimated
(based on the size of the individual BAC clones) to be
less than 10 kbp in total are yet to be bridged. Gap closure over repeat elements with high level of sequence
identity remains computationally challenging. The final
assembly of the 6 BAC clones yielded a scaffold of
about 603 kbp (Figure 1); adding approximately 16 kbp
of sequences to the corresponding Celera assembly. The
overall sequence identity between the two is about 97%.
However, there exist variable regions with sequence
identity as low as 60% (Additional file 1) suggesting
potential errors in the assembly using mixed strains of
mouse. The sequence and annotations of the scaffold
have been deposited in the GenBank with the accession
number HM370554 and a graphical representation is
also available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/
300085578?report=graph.
Analysis of the 129S7 Itln locus

A dotplot analysis (Figure 2) was first used to pinpoint
regions of high similarity where the Itln genes may be
located. Six complete or partial ~62 kbp tandemly or
invertedly duplicated segments could be identified on the
locus. Each of these segments is found to be flanked by
murine endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements which have
been known to mediate the host recombination [29].
These ERV elements may well serve as the breakpoint for

assembled as described in Materials and Methods to give a ~600 kbp final assembly. The locations of genes and pseudogenes are indicated.

the recombination and expansion of the Itln locus. It is
perhaps no coincidence that about 43% of the 129S7 Itln
locus is made up of repeat elements. This is significantly
denser than the average 37.5% observed for the whole genome in the C57BL/6J mouse [30].
In addition to the flanking genes (Refbp2, Ly9 and
Slamf7), the ~500 kbp Itln locus has been predicted to
be made up of 5 full-length Itln variants (Itln1-2,4-6),
one truncated Itln (Itln3), 6 pseudo-Itln, one CD244
variant CD244_SE, one full-length CD244 and 5 pseudoCD244 (Figure 1 & Additional file 2). The 6 Itln genes
can be further classified into two categories based on
their sizes of either ~11 or ~17 kbp; with Itln1 and Itln6
having additional LINE/L1 retrotransposable elements
inserted into their respective intron 7. In fact, variations
also exist in the organisation of the pseduogenes on
each of the duplicated segments; with some having different exons removed.
To further investigate the evolutionary basis of the
seemingly active segmental duplication, an unrooted
neighbour-joining tree (Figure 3) was constructed using
intron 5 and its equivalent in all the Itln genes and
pseudogenes, respectively. With less selection pressure
than the exons, introns are known to mutate more
rapidly and uniformly; making them an informative phylogenomic marker. The tree shows that the full-length
genes and pseudogenes are clearly separated into two
distinct clades. The clustering of the pseudogenes

phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the sequences of
Intron 5 (I5) which range from about 400 bp to 3.6 kbp. Numbers at
the beginning of nodes represent the percentage bootstrap
support. The full-length (Itln)- and pseudo-genes (pItln) separate

suggests that they probably propagate by serial duplication of an existing pseudogene which may already be
present within the duplicated segments together with its
full-length gene. Detailed sequence analysis of each of
the introns shows that the insertions of ERV and/or
LINE repeats probably account for the branching of
each genes and pseudogenes.
Although all 8 exons of the Itln genes can be mapped
onto the 6 variants and their predicted mRNA
sequences are highly conserved (94 to 97% sequence
identity), they are predicted to be expressed and probably regulated differently. Both Itln3 and Itln4 transcripts are found to contain an early stop codon. While
this is most likely to result in a truncated Itln3, the presence of potential ribosomal -1 frameshift sites identified
further upstream of the stop codon at positions 175 and
177 is predicted to allow the translation of the fulllength Itln4 protein to proceed. Sequence conservation
among the 5 predicted full-length Itln proteins ranges
from 91 to 96%. Not surprisingly, similar conservation is
also observed when comparing the variants with the
Itln1 [GenBank:NP_034714] of C57BL/6J; with the Itln1
from both strains being identical to each other on the
protein level. However, higher degrees of variation are
found among the 5 Itln variants and the predicted Celera homologues; with the protein sequence identity
ranges from 71 to 100% (Additional file 1). Two of Celera’s Itln variants may also contain sites for ribosomal
-1 frameshifting. The Itln1 and Itln2 genes of 129S7 are
found to be identical to Celera’s Itlna [GenBank:
NP_034714] and Itlnb [GenBank:NP_001007553] respectively. The observed variation in the remaining Itln

Lu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:110

variants is probably the result of a mixed Itln population
derived from the 5 mouse strains.
CD244_SE was initially predicted to be a CD244 pseudogene due the lack of the terminal exon 9. However, a
closer inspection has resulted in the identification of a
potential internal splicing site in the predicted exon 3.
Comparison of all the probable coding sequences
derived from this internal splicing site has led to the
prediction of a protein which shares 65% identity with
the soluble form of rat CD244 [31]. This novel protein
is made up of 4 exons which are highly similar (~90%
conservation) to that of CD244; with part of exon 3
spliced to exon 5. On the other hand, it is also interesting to note that the CD244 protein sequence of 129S7
and Celera [GenBank:XP_001003781] are almost identical with 99% sequence identity but they share only 89%
sequence identity with that of C57BL/6J [GenBank:
NP_061199].
All the pseudogenes contain exons that share at least
70% sequence identity with their full-length counterparts. None of them contains the full set of exons and
multiple stop codons are often spread across them.
Southern blot analysis

Southern blot analysis (Figure 4) was conducted to
experimentally verify both the assembly and the dotplot
analysis on the number of duplicated segments. Using
probes (Additional file 3) that hybridised to the 5’ and 3’
end of the Itln genes, fragments gave a banding pattern

Page 4 of 11

that was consistent with that predicted from the in silico
restriction analysis of the locus. In addition to the 129S7
strain, Southern blotting was also carried out on C57BL/
6J, 129X1, 129S1, DBA2/J and A/J mice (Figure 4). All
the 129 substrains also showed a banding pattern that
was consistent with restriction fragments predicted from
the sequenced 129S7 Itln locus. DBA2/J and A/J strains
showed a similar pattern, but with the appearance of a
prominent extra band with the 3’ probe. Although it is
highly likely that these four mouse strains share a similar genomic organisation at the Itln locus with the
129S7 substrains, differences observed in the Southern
analysis should further warrant a note of care when
using the mixed assembly of Celera’s mouse genome.
The C57BL/6J strain consistently gave a single band, as
expected.
Itln CNVs in mouse

To date, 5 genome-wide CNV studies of varying degrees
of resolution have been carried out in different mouse
strains [23,32-35]. However, none has specified the
exact copy number of the Itln genes. Recently, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute has sequenced 17 different
mouse strains using the Illumina next generation
sequencing technology. With the knowledge that there
are 6 Itln genes in the 129S7 mouse and that it has a
similar Southern pattern to the other 129 substrains, an
attempt to identify the Itln CNVs in these strains was
done by comparing the sequencing coverage across the

Figure 4 Southern blot detection of Itln locus in C57BL/6J and 129-related mouse strains. A combination of 5’ and 3’ external probes
enables the variants of different sizes to be detected and they were in agreement with that predicted (as indicated) computationally. Stu I
digestion also resulted in an unspecific ~8 kbp fragment which contained sequence that shared some homology with the 3’ probes.
Polymorphisms in other 129-related strains could potentially result in unspecific hybridisation of the probes.

Itln locus (Figure 5 & Additional file 4). During the
mapping of these reads against the C57BL/6J reference
genome, reads are expected to collapse together to
increase the mapping coverage at segments where copy
number gains are located. This gain can be quantified
by the log2 ratio of the coverage at a particular position;
with for example a single (heterozygous) copy gain
represented as log2(3/2) = 0.58. A locus duplicated once
in a homozygous inbred strain would be represented as
log2(4/2) = 1. Such a comparison is in fact analogous to
CNV detection using the array comparative genomic
hybridisation (aCGH) method [36].
Relative to the single Itln locus in the C57BL/6J reference mouse, an approximately 62 kbp segment containing the Itln gene has apparently been duplicated several
times in all the 16 strains investigated. Although the
log 2 ratio of the CAST/EiJ strain falls close to the
threshold (Additional file 4, Figure S3a), the consistently
higher than reference coverage across the Itln locus
(Figure 5) suggests that the segment may actually be
duplicated once. The log 2 ratio for the 129S1/SvImJ
strain vs C57BL/6J varies between 1.8 and 2.7 over the
Itln locus (Additional file 4, Figure S3a), well above the
threshold for calling gene amplication, and suggesting 4
to 6-fold gain of the locus compared to C57BL/6J. Similar gain is also observed in the other strains (result not
shown).

Evidence for expression of mouse Itln variants

Polymerase chain reaction analysis using common
primers which amplified the Itln cDNA from all mouse
tissues sampled, gave a product of the expected size
(301 bp). Restriction enzyme analysis (Additional file 5)
revealed variation in patterns across the different tissue
samples, indicating heterogeneity of Itln variant expression. PCR products were sequenced to confirm the identities of variants expressed in different tissues
(summarised in Table 1). Briefly, Itln2 was expressed in
trachea and Itln1 was the dominant form expressed in
small intestinal tissues, whereas Itln6 was dominant in
stomach and caecum. Since there was evidence for
expression of both Itln2 and Itln6 in colon, the PCR
product was cloned and 48 clone sequences were
obtained. Twenty six clones were consistent (>98% identity) with Itln2 and 12 were consistent with Itln6. The
remaining 10 sequences contained ambiguities and/or
were not consistent with any of the six known Itln
variants.
Detection of putative Nkx3.1 transcription factor binding
sites in Itln promoter regions

In C57BL/6J, the so-called “Int5” promoter region of
Itln1, which we have renamed Promoter Region 5 (Pr5)
to avoid confusion, has been found to harbour the binding site for the transcription factor Nkx3.1 [37] at

(red), CAST/EiJ (green) and 129S1/SvImJ (blue), were plotted along the Itln locus of the reference mouse genome and they were superimposed
on top of one another. The mean mapped coverage (horizontal line) of the three genomes is about 20x. Coverage of C57BL/6NJ’s Itln locus was
consistent with the mean mapped genome coverage while those of the other 2 strains were expanded to different degrees. Reads that were
mapped onto repeat elements were reported once and resulted in regions showing coverages similar to the mean mapped genome coverage.

Summary of the RT-PCR and sequencing of pan-Itln PCR products show tissue

presence of additional Itln variants in any tissue.

position -1348 to -1343. The cognate DNA binding
sequence for Nkx3.1 was determined by Steadman et al.
[38] to be TAAGT(A/G). This Pr5 promoter region is
found to be conserved in Itln1, Itln2, Itln3 and Itln6 of
the 129S7 mouse (Figure 6). Since Itln3 is predicted to be
a truncated protein, it was excluded in the subsequent
search for the Nkx3.1 binding site. Putative binding sites
on the promoter of Itln1, Itln2 and Itln6 are predicted to
be located at positions -1357 to -1351, -1379 to -1373,
and -3747 to -3741 respectively (Table 2).
However, the “TAAGTG” motif is only conserved
between the Itln1 promoter of C57BL/6J and 129S7.
A single bp variation results in a “TAAATG” binding
motif on the promoters of Itln2 and Itln6 which may in
turn affect the binding affinity for Nkx3.1.

Discussion
We present here the sequence of the Itln locus on
mouse chromosome 1 in a non-C57BL/6J mouse strain
(129S7). Multiple duplications of Itln and CD244 genes/
pseudogenes have resulted in the expansion of the locus
in comparison to that found in the reference C57BL/6J

Nkx3.1-binding promoter region 5 sequence, identified by Mogal
et al. [37], was detected in the promoters of Itln1 in C57BL/6J (Itlna)

mouse. Nearly half of this expanded Itln locus comprises
repeat sequence elements. It is likely that the presence
of flanking ERV and LINE elements was involved in the
duplications and inversion of the Itln locus; and that the
events may be relatively recent and active [29,39].
The present data allows us to unequivocally define the
genetic architecture of the Itln locus in the 129S7 genome. It bears considerable similarity to that obtained in
the Celera mouse genome but with reduced homology
over the coding regions. This is most likely due to the
Celera sequence being a composite of 5 different strains
and the difficulty in resolving repetitive sequences; and
hence not necessarily representative of any one strain. It
has been estimated that as much as 57% of highly identical segmental duplications in the mouse genome were
potentially misassembled and that segmental duplications/CNVs make up 1.7-2.0% of the mouse genome
[40]. We have overcome this pitfall by a combined
strategy of tiling path sequencing of BAC clones and
Southern verification.
Furthermore, our Southern blot data suggested that
other non-C57BL/6J strains also have a similar structure. In support of this, not only have a number of previous genome-wide studies on the structural variations
of the mouse genome identified this locus as a hotspot
of recombination and CNV, the ENSEMBL annotated
Itln protein family ENSFM00250000003313 also reports
variations in the copy number of the Itln gene in different animal species. The majority of the 17 mouse strains
show evidence of expansion at this locus too, raising the
question as to whether the Itln locus has been deleted
in the C57BL/6J and related strains, or alternatively
expanded in a common ancestor to the 129S7 and other
non-C57BL/6J strains.
It was not known whether CNV at the mouse Itln
locus confers a simple dosage effect, or alternatively,
whether each variant plays a different functional role.
We found that in contrast to the C57BL/6J mouse
strain, which expresses a single Itln1 gene [30], 129S2
and 129P2 mice exhibited site-specific expression of at
least three different Itln variants along the gastrointestinal tract. Such differential tissue expression of Itln variants has also been observed in the channel catfish [41].
This highly selective expression pattern and the minor

Lu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/110

amino acid sequence differences between the Itln variants
suggest that these duplicated genes may be of functional
significance at the different sites of expression. It has been
suggested that intelectins play a role in modifying mucus
properties, and therefore site-selective expression of variants may be important in the same way that mucosal trefoil factor variant expression tends to be co-ordinated with
specific mucin types in different regions of the gastrointestinal tract [42]. Similarly, sheep intelectin variants have
been found to exhibit site-specific expression differences
between airways, gastric stomach (abomasum) and small
intestine [7]. However, the consequences to C57BL/6J
mice, if any, of lack of expression of Itln2 and Itln6 in the
GI tract, remain to be established.
It has been shown that a functional Nkx3.1 transcription
factor binding site is located in the mouse Itln1 promoter
[37]. Nkx3.1 is highly expressed in the prostate, where it is
believed to function as a tumour repressor gene [43], and
regulates Itln1 expression in prostate epithelial cells [44].
Haploinsufficiency in Nkx3.1, where only a single functional allele of the gene is present, was found to result in
reduced expression of a range of dosage-sensitive genes in
the mouse prostate, including Itln1, expression of which
was essentially lost in Nkx3.1+/- mice [44]. Importantly,
Itln1 expression was itself shown to suppress prostate cell
growth [37], and thus Itln1 appears to be an effector of
prostate cancer repression. It was of interest therefore to
determine the occurrence of Nkx3.1 binding sites in all six
Itln genes described here. The Pr5 region which was
found to contain the Nkx3.1 binding sequence TAAGTG
[38] was present in the promoter regions of four of the six
Itln genes but the binding region was mutated to
TAAATG in all but Itln1, suggesting that although Itln1
probably remains under the transcriptional control of
Nkx3.1 in 129S7 mice, the same is not necessarily true for
the other Itln variants.
Importantly, an adipocytokine [14] role has been
ascribed to human Itln1 (omentin-1), which can be
detected in blood plasma and serum. Estimates for normal human serum Itln1 concentration vary from 20 ng/
ml [45] to over 100 ng/ml [14]. Recombinant Itln1 has
been shown to stimulate insulin-dependent glucose
uptake by adipocytes in vitro [14], and its expression in
visceral fat and in the circulation is negatively correlated
with body mass index and waist circumference [46].
Weight loss and aerobic exercise were associated with
significant increases in serum Itln1 levels [47] and a corresponding reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors.
With reference to the comparative metabolic significance of Itln expression in mice, Orozco et al. [48] investigated the influence of CNV on metabolic traits using a
combined genomic - metabolomic approach in the

chromosomes 1, 4 and 17 were associated with metabolic
traits, and specifically, CNV in Itln1 (Itlna) was linked
with weight, triglycerides, adiposity, glucose and insulin
level [48]. Itln mRNA expression level, as detected by Agilent microarray analysis [48], was significantly elevated in
the high copy number genotype (C3H), when assayed in
adipose, brain and liver tissue. The detailed characterisation of the Itln locus described here provides new specific
candidates for further investigation of the role of Itln
genes in mouse models of metabolic disorders.
In addition to Itln, the CD244 gene sequence is also
amplified within the 129S7 locus. Specifically, this study
has identified a putative CD244 variant, analogous to
the secreted CD244 variant previously described in the
rat [31]. However, we found no evidence of expression
of the corresponding transcript by RT-PCR in mouse
small intestine (data not shown), so it is not clear
whether it is actively transcribed in this mouse strain.
CD244 (also known as 2B4) is a member of the SLAM
family of cell surface receptors, which are present as a
gene cluster adjacent to the Itln locus on mouse and
human chromosome 1. A range of lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-cell subsets
have been shown to express CD244, which is the high
affinity counter-receptor for CD48 (for a review, see
[49]). While engagement of human NK cell CD244 with
CD48 results in enhanced killing of CD48-expressing
cells [50], the situation appears more complex in mice,
where both activating and inhibitory roles have been
demonstrated [51]. It is known that C57BL/6J mice possess a single CD244 gene, expressed as long and short
splice variants, which are distinct from CD244 cDNAs
amplified from other mouse strains [52]. The potential
expression of a soluble CD244 variant suggested by this
study, may introduce an additional level of regulation of
lymphocyte interactions in non- C57BL/6J -related
strains, and may therefore contribute to immunological
differences between C57BL/6J and other strains.

Conclusions
To conclude, we have determined the sequence for
essentially the complete Itln locus in the 129S7 mouse,
as a prototype for non-C57BL/6J mouse strains. This
has elucidated the nature of the copy number variation
occurring at this locus, arising from tandem duplication
of Itln and CD244 genes. Individual Itln genes showed
strong tissue expression specificity while most duplicated CD244 genes were non-functional.
Methods
Identification and sequencing of Itln-containing BAC
clones

The Itln locus of the 129/Sv mouse was characterised by
sequencing BAC clones derived from the AB2.2 ES cell

Lu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/110

of the 129S7/SvEvBrd-Hprtb-m2 substrain [27]. Since the
reference C57BL/6J mouse genome contains only a single copy of the Itln gene (Additional file 2), two BAC
clones flanking the gene were first identified from the
BAC end sequences aligned to the ENSEMBL Mouse
Assembly (ENSEMBL release 46, NCBI m36) [53]. A tiling path of candidate BAC clones moving towards each
other from the two ends of the locus (Figure 1) was
then built by selecting BAC clones with end sequences
that matched to the sequenced ones. Two iterations of
blast search were done to identify these matching
clones; an initial identity cut-off of 90% was applied, followed by quality trimming of the filtered sequences and
a final round of blast with 98% identity cut-off. PCRs to
check the presence of Itln were also performed to
further ensure the correct candidates were picked.
A total of six overlapping BAC clones (bMQ411i17,
bMQ453f04, bMQ285e14, bMQ_239m09, bMQ312m04
and bMQ302g15) spanning the entire Itln locus were
purchased from Geneservice (UK). BAC clones were
grown in LB broth containing chloramphenicol (12.5
μg/ml) and DNA was purified using a proprietary
kit (NucleoBond ® BAC 100, Macherey-Nagel). Four
shortgun libraries with insert size of about 2 kbp
were constructed from the four respective flanking
clones (bMQ411i17, bMQ453f04, bMQ312m04 and
bMQ302g15) and sequenced by GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany) using the ABI Big Dye Terminator Mix
v3.0 in a ABI 3730 sequencing machine. Gap closures
for these four clones were achieved by primer walking.
36 bp paired-end next-generation sequencing using the
Illumina Genome Analyzer II was carried out by ARKGenomics (Roslin, UK) on the two remaining middle
clones (bMQ_239m09 and bMQ312m04).
Sequence assembly

Sequences from each of the four shortgun libraries
were assembled using Phred (v 0.020425.c)/Phrap
(v1.080812)/Consed (v15.0) [54] into their respective
scaffolds. Parameters for the assembly were set to
high stringency: vector scanning, 32bp trimming of
all 5’ ends, minimum Phred score of 20, minimum
length of matching word increased to 30, and level of
contigs merging stringency set to the highest. Contaminating contigs from E. coli were removed by
blasting them against the NCBI’s E. coli genomes
[55]. All assembled contigs were also manually
inspected to correct for errors due to duplicated segments and repeats; with special attention paid to
regions having higher than 97% cross_match (v
1.080812) [54] identity. They were ordered into a single scaffold for each of the libraries with the aid of
the forward/reverse pairing data and locations of the
predicted coding sequences.

Page 8 of 11

A strategy involving three iterations of mapping
against reference sequences, de novo sequence assembly
and a final scaffold construction was employed to
assemble the remaining two BAC clones. The 4.8 million 36 bp Illumina paired-end reads were adaptor- and
quality-trimmed to 32 bp with the fastx toolkit (v0.0.11)
[56] to ensure only reads with phred scores higher than
15 were kept. These processed reads were first mapped
against the contaminating E. coli str. K-12 substr.
DH10B [GenBank:NC_010473] reference genome and
pBACe3.6 [GenBank:U80929] cloning vector using
MAQ (v0.7.1) [57]. The 2.4 million clean unmapped
reads next underwent a second round of mapping, again
with MAQ, to remove sequences overlapping with the
known flanking upstream BAC clones. Reads which
were unmapped, containing indels or more than one
mismatch and mapping quality score less than 20
amounted to about 1.2 million. They were finally MAQ
mapped, allowing 2 mismatches, against the corresponding Itln locus of Celera’s mouse assembly. Again the
unmapped reads were extracted and input into the de
novo assembly program, Velvet (v0.7.54) [58] to obtain a
set of contigs that should cover the gaps in the MAQ
mapped consensus sequence. In addition, de novo
assembly using Velvet on the 2.4 million reads extracted
from the first mapping exercise was also done to facilitate the resolution of errors in the MAQ consensus
sequence. The Velvet optimiser script was used and no
scaffolding was done. Contigs with exceptionally high or
low k-mer coverage values were also discarded. The
scaffold for these two BAC clones was constructed by
merging together the final MAQ consensus sequence
and the two sets of Velvet contigs using the SeqMan
module of Lasergene (v8.1). Merging was only allowed
where end sequences overlapped for at least 15 bp with
99% identity. Where necessary manual correction was
always performed. The final single scaffold of the six
BAC clones was also assembled with the SeqMan.
Annotation

Spidey (v1.40) [59] and Blast2seq (v2.2.20) [60] were used
initially to search and predict the gene organisation of
the 6 known genes, namely Refbp2, Itln1, Itln2, CD244,
Ly9 and Slamf7, on the new 129S7 Itln locus. The reference mRNA sequences and the intron/exon boundaries
used were obtained from both NCBI Refseq and
ENSEMBL gene transcripts (Additional file 2). Splicing
junctions were manually corrected to reflect the exact
acceptor/donor sites. Pseudogenes were only annotated
when their exons share at least 70% identity to the coding
sequences. In addition, the exon-exon junctions of the
predicted transcripts were predicted with the RNASPL
program of the Softberry web server [61] to check for
alternative splicing. Potential frame-shifting in the

Lu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/110

transcripts were checked with the web tool KnotInFrame
[62]. Repeat elements on the locus were identified using
the program RepeatMasker (v3.2.7) [63].

between C57BL/6J and 129S7. Where no such region
exists between C57BL/6J and 129S7, sites with the highest similarity to the C57BL/6J’s TAAGTG motif were
picked.

Comparative genomics

Dotplot and blastz analyses between the Itln locus of the
129S7 strain and itself and that of the Celera mouse
assembly were carried out using dotter (v3.1) [64]
and zPicture [65] to gain insights into the structural
organisation of the locus. Intelectins of other animals
were obtained from the ENSEMBL protein family
ENSFM00250000003313. ClustalW (v1.83) [66] was used
to align the mRNA and the translated protein sequences
of the different intelectins while MUSCLE [67] was the
program of choice for the multiple sequence alignment
of the genomic and the intronic sequences. For the phylogenetic analysis, the alignment of intron 5 sequences of
the full length and pseudo-Itln genes from 129S7,
C57BL/6J and rat was manually adjusted before being
analysed with the MEGA (v5.0 beta) software suite [68].
The tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining
methodology with the branch distances computed based
on the Kimura-2-parameter model. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair. The final
consensus tree was inferred from 1000 bootstrap replicates. The presence of the Itln CNV in 17 other mouse
strains (129P2/OlaHsd, 129S1/SvImJ, 129S5/SvEvBrd, A/
J, AKR/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6NJ, CAST/EiJ,
CBA/J, DBA/2J, LP/J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HiLtJ, PWK/
PhJ, Spret/EiJ and WSB/EiJ) was detected by using CNVseq [36] with the threshold of the log2 ratio set to 0.6.
Furthermore, the relatively high sequencing coverage,
averaging 20.1 fold, of the 17 genomes allows the use of a
small sliding window size of about 4 kb and a p-value of
10-5 to increase the CNV resolution (results not shown).
The zoom-in coverage plots of the identified Itln CNV
were drawn by the plotrix library of R [69]. Sequencing
data of these mice were obtained from the Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/mouse_genomes/.
Nkx3.1 transcription factor binding sites

The potential binding sites for the Nkx3.1 transcription
factor on the 5 kbp (upstream of the transcription start
site) promoters of the six 129S7 Itln variants and that of
the C57BL/6J were predicted using three different web
tools, namely JASPAR scan of individual promoters
applying 75% relative profile score threshold [70]; zPicture pairwise alignment between C57BL/6J and 129S7
promoters followed by rVista [71] search for conserved
TAA[G/A]T[A/G][A/C/T] binding sites; and MEME
motif discovery [72]. Results from the three predictions
were next compared to identify conserved binding sites
that fall on the evolutionary conserved regions conserved

Southern blotting

Two probes (Additional file 3) were designed to sit on
the 5’ and 3’ end of the Itln genes. The probe
sequences were selected based on the conserved
regions of the 6 Itln variants. There were blasted
against the reference mouse genome to make sure that
they do not hybridise to other parts of the genome.
Southern blots were done according to the standard
protocols of Southern [73]. Briefly, genomic DNA from
7 mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129P2, 129S1/SvImJ, A/J,
DBA/2J, 129X1/SvJ and 129S7) were digested over
night at 37°C with either Nco I or Stu I for hybridising
with either the 5’ or 3’ probe respectively. DNAs were
then separated on 0.8% agarose gel overnight at 20 V
before being transferred to the nylon membrane for
hybridisation with the radioactive probes.
Evidence for expression of Itln variants

Samples of the following tissues were collected from
healthy uninfected mice of the 129S2 and 129P2 strains:
trachea, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum
and colon. The samples were collected into RNAlater
and subsequently RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed
and then amplified by PCR using common primers for all
six Itln variants (ITLN_all_F: TCAGCTAGCAACTCT
CAGCTCCT; ITLN_all_R ACACTAGCCACCAGGGT
CCA; 35 cycles, annealing temp: 57°C). PCR products
were sequenced and results analysed for evidence of a
predominant Itln variant, or evidence of a mixture. Additionally, PCR products were digested with restriction
enzymes Hha I, Mbo II and Hae III (see Additional file 5
for specificities). The PCR products from 129S2 colon
and 129P2 trachea were subjected to TOPO cloning.
Positive clones from 129S2 colon (48) and 129P2 trachea
(4) were individually sequenced.
