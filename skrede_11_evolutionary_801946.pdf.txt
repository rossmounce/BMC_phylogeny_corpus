Evolutionary history of Serpulaceae
(Basidiomycota): molecular phylogeny, historical
biogeography and evidence for a single transition
of nutritional mode

Abstract
Background: The fungal genus Serpula (Serpulaceae, Boletales) comprises several saprotrophic (brown rot) taxa,
including the aggressive house-infecting dry rot fungus Serpula lacrymans. Recent phylogenetic analyses have
indicated that the ectomycorrhiza forming genera Austropaxillus and Gymnopaxillus cluster within Serpula. In this
study we use DNA sequence data to investigate phylogenetic relationships, historical biogeography of, and
nutritional mode transitions in Serpulaceae.
Results: Our results corroborate that the two ectomycorrhiza-forming genera, Austropaxillus and Gymnopaxillus,
form a monophyletic group nested within the saprotrophic genus Serpula, and that the Serpula species
S. lacrymans and S. himantioides constitute the sister group to the Austropaxillus-Gymnopaxillus clade. We found
that both vicariance (Beringian) and long distance dispersal events are needed to explain the phylogeny and
current distributions of taxa within Serpulaceae. Our results also show that the transition from brown rot to
mycorrhiza has happened only once in a monophyletic Serpulaceae, probably between 50 and 22 million years
before present.
Conclusions: This study supports the growing understanding that the same geographical barriers that limit plantand animal dispersal also limit the spread of fungi, as a combination of vicariance and long distance dispersal
events are needed to explain the present patterns of distribution in Serpulaceae. Our results verify the transition
from brown rot to ECM within Serpulaceae between 50 and 22 MyBP.

Background
Studying fungal distributions in an evolutionary context
is relatively new, mainly due to the long-standing perception that fungi are more or less free from dispersal
barriers, and that fungal distributions are primarily controlled by the distribution of hosts and substrata (see
[1]). However, this notion of “cosmopolitan species” has
recently been challenged by molecularly based studies
[2-4]. Fungal distributional patterns can be complicated
by the fact that cryptic species and polyphyly often are
revealed in molecular based fungal studies. Thus, molecular phylogenetic approaches have proven important

for the identification of unique lineages with restricted
distributions [3]. Although it is obvious that hosts
impose some restriction on the distribution of their
parasite or symbiont (e.g. [5]), Taylor et al. [3] argue
that very few (if any) organisms can be considered free
of entanglement with other organisms. In fact, Parrent
et al. [6] suggested that high levels of host specificity
increase the effect of isolation-by-distance.
Vicariance versus long distance dispersal are two alternative explanations to widely disjunct distributions, and
have been identified to operate in most groups of organisms [7,8]. It is becoming increasingly accepted that the
same barriers to dispersal operate in fungi as in other
groups of organisms [1,2]. Vicariance has given explanatory power for disjunct distributions in some extomycorrhizal fungi such as pacific boletes [9] and truffle-formin

fungi in the Hysterangiales [10], while dispersal
best explains the distribution of the wood-rot fungi
Ganoderma [11].
Molecular dating makes it possible to relate organismal evolution to major ecological and geological events.
The combination of fossils that correlate to divergence
events in organismal phylogenies with increasingly realistic models of molecular evolution has increased the
accuracy of molecular dating [12]. Reliable fossils are
preferred for calibration of molecular clocks. However,
dated geographic and ecological events as well as age
estimates of symbiotic or parasitic partners have also
been used [13-15], either in combination with fossil calibration or as the best available alternative when no reliably determined and correctly assigned fossils exist.
Unfortunately, the fossil record of fungi is sparse [12],
and several studies have attempted to date evolutionary
splits of fungi using various calibration strategies (e.g.
[15-20]). An additional complicating factor in molecular
dating is between-lineage rate heterogeneity of molecular evolution, which has been extensively documented in
fungi (see [12] and references therein). However, methods have been developed that account for rate heterogeneity by various sophisticated relaxed clock models (e.g.
BEAST [21]).
In recent times, the fungal tree of life has been largely
redrawn by molecular phylogenetics. This has in turn
improved our understanding of how different nutritional
modes have evolved [22-24]. The Agaricomycetes is a
class in the fungal kingdom that contains most of the forest floor mushroom-forming fungi [25]. Currently saprotrophy (possibly white rot) is suggested to be the
plesiomorphic state of the Agaricomycetes [26], while
brown rot and ectomycorrhiza have evolved several times
independently from the ancient white rot state. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi form mutualistic interactions
between plant roots and fungal mycelia. The symbiosis
provides the plant with important nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen, and the fungi receive photosynthetic products in return [27,28]. Mycorrhizal symbioses
are ubiquitous in natural plant environments [29-31].
Saprotrophy by white rot decomposes lignocellulose and
utilize all parts of the wood. Brown rot, on the other
hand, only deforms the lignin to get access to the cellulose and hemicelluose, which are then efficiently depolymerized and absorbed by the fungus [32,33].
Recent work shows that ECM is a nutritional mode that
has evolved several times independently in both plants
and fungi (both Basidiomycota and Ascomycota) [28,34].
Hibbett and Matheny [26] concluded that there have been
many independent origins of ECM associations of Agaricomycetes with both Angiosperms (at least 8) and Gymnosperms (at least 6-8). The monophyletic basidiomycete
order Boletales comprises various nutritional modes,

including ECM, saprotrophy and parasitism [35,36].
Brown rot has been suggested as the plesiomorphic state
for the Boletales [37].
The genus Serpula (Pers.) Gray in the Boletales consists
of saprotrophic taxa that mainly degrade conifer substrates [37]. Serpula species produce annual, brownish,
and resupinate fruitbodies (flat structures adhered to a
woody or soil substrate with a morphological cariable
sexual spore-producing surface; in the case of Serupla
this spore producing surface is wrinkled or merulioid)
[38,39]. Many Serpula species appear frequently on structural timbers in buildings, including S. himantioides (Fr.)
P. Karst., S. incrassata (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Donk and
S. lacrymans (Wulfen) J. Schröt [40]. Serpula lacrymans
is very aggressive in buildings and produces what is commonly known as dry rot (ref). The taxonomic circumscriptions of Serpula himantioides and S. lacrymans have
varied through time: they are lumped as one based on
morphology [41] or recognized as two separate species
based on mating experiments [42]. The morphotaxon
S. lacrymans includes two varieties. One of them (var.
shastensis Harmsen) seems to have a natural distribution
in the Cascade Range in western North America, while
the other (var. lacrymans [Wulfen] J. Schröt.) has a natural distribution in northeast Asia from where it has
spread to most continents and colonised buildings (see
[43] and references therein). The morphotaxon S. himantioides includes multiple (at least five) cryptic species
[44,45], most of them with a primary affinity to southern
South America and North America. Serpula incrassata
seems to have a strictly North American distribution
[41]. A less studied species, Serpula puverulenta (Fr.)
Bondartsev, which also appears in houses, has at least a
European and probably also a North American distribution [46,47]. Serpula similis (Berk. & Broome) Ginns is
known from tropical regions in Africa and southeast
Asia, where it is sampled on bamboo and hardwoods
[48,49].
Molecular phylogenetic analyses have indicated that the
ECM-forming genera Austropaxillus Bresinsky & Jarosch
and Gymnopaxillus E. Horak are nested within Serpula,
and the family Serpulaceae Jarosch & Bresinsky was
described comprising these three genera [50]. Austropaxillus species have fruiting bodies with a stipe (stem) and
pileus (cap), and a bear a gilled hymenophore (spore-producing surface). In contrast, Gymnopaxillus encompasses
truffle-like hypogeous (under ground) fruit bodies [51].
Due to morphological and ecological similarities, these genera were earlier included in Paxillus Fr. [52]. Austropaxillus
and Gymnopaxillus form ECM with roots of Nothofagus
and Eucalyptus trees and are known only from the temperate Southern Hemisphere.
The aim of the present study was threefold. First, we
wanted to further investigate phylogenetic relationships

Skrede et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:230
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/230

within Serpulaceae (previously described in [37,52]), in
particular the relationship between the saprotrophic
Serpula and the mycorrhiza-forming Austropaxillus and
Gymnopaxillus. Secondly, we wanted to relate major
Serpulaceae divergence events and ecological transitions
to geologic and climatic conditions of the past. Finally,
we wanted to reveal how many times the transition
from brown rot to mycorrhizal symbiosis has occurred
in Serpulaceae including reconstructing its ancestral biographical range within a historical geological context.
We addressed these issues using a molecular phylogenetic approach, including Bayesian age estimation and
various ancestral area analyses, on a multi-locus dataset.

Methods
Taxon sampling

We generated DNA sequence data from 30 accessions of
five Serpula species and six accessions representing six
species of Austropaxillus (Additional file 1: Specimens
included in this study). In the phylogenetic analysis, we
included an extensive set of outgroups from both the
Boletales (41 accessions) and its sister group the Atheliales, the latter used for rooting purposes (Dataset1). For
the purpose of dating, we reduced the boletalean outgroup to 24 accessions, expanded the athelialean outgroup to seven accessions, and included 1-24 accessions
from each of nine additional fungal orders (Dataset2).
Sequences not generated for the present study were
taken from Binder et al. [53] and Jarosch and Bresinsky
[50]. We used a total of 79 accessions for the phylogenetic analyses (Dataset1) and 109 accessions in the dating
analysis (Dataset2). A separate phylogenetic analysis was
performed on a reduced dataset of 39 accessions (Serpulaceae and a single outgroup taxon; Dataset3) to depict
the phylogenetic position of Gymnopaxillus, for which
only sequences of a single genetic region are available.
All included accessions are listed in Additional file 1.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and DNA sequencing

A small amount of fungal tissue was homogenized on
a Mixer Mill (MM301, Retsch GmbH & Co., Haan,
Germany) before we extracted total DNA following the 2%
CTAB miniprep method described by Murray and Thompson [54] with minor modifications from Gardes and Bruns
[55]. We dissolved the dried DNA pellet in 100 μL milli-Q
H2O, and used further dilutions for the molecular work.
We have deposited the DNA aliquots in the fungal DNA
collection at the Institute of Biology, UoO, Norway.
Five nuclear DNA regions were amplified: the nuclear
ribosomal large subunit (LSU) using the primers LR0R/
LR5 [56], the nuclear ribosomal small subunit (SSU) using
the primers PNS1/NS41 [57], the nuclear ribosomal 5.8S
using the primers ITS5 and ITS4 [58], a fragment of the
gene that encodes the second largest subunit of the RNA

polymerase II (rpb2) using the primers b3.1F and b6R2
[59], and the translation elongation factor 1a (tef 1) using
the primers EF595F and EF1160R [60].
We generated amplicons using the following PCR protocol: 4 min at 94°C; followed by 35 cycles of 25 s at 94°C,
30 s at 56°C (rpb2 53°C; ITS and tef 154°C), and 60 s (30 s
ITS and tef 1) at 72°C; followed by a 10 min extension at
72°C and an indefinite hold at 4°C. For all PCR reactions
we used the PuReTaq Ready-To-Go™ PCR Beads
(GEhealthcare, Waukesha, WI) in a 25 μl reaction on an
Eppendorf thermocycler (Mastercycler, Hamburg,
Germany). We purified the PCR-products using 2 μl
10 times diluted ExoSAP-IT (GEhealthcare) to 8 μl PCR
product, incubated at 37°C for 45 minutes followed by
15 minutes at 80°C. Cycle sequencing was performed by
the CEES ABI-laboratory http://www.mn.uio.no/bio/english/research/about/infrastructure/abi-lab/index.html
using the ABI BigDye Terminator sequencing buffer and
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA). Sequences were processed on an ABI 3730 DNA
analyser (Life Technologies). Sequences were assembled
and edited using BioEdit 7 [61]. All sequences have been
deposited in GenBank, and accession numbers are given
in Additional file 1.
Datasets

We aligned the sequences manually using BioEdit 7. We
assembled three datasets: Dataset1, consisting of a 2856
basepair (bp) long alignment that includes five genetic
regions (nuclear ribosomal LSU, SSU and 5.8S, rpb2 and
tef 1), available as Additional file 2; Dataset2, consisting
of a 6172 bp long alignment including longer stretches of
the above-mentioned markers, available as Additional file
3; Dataset3, consisting of a 918 bp long alignment including LSU only and a total of 38 Serpulaceae accessions
(incl. Gymnopaxillus) and Bondarcevomyces for rooting,
available as Additional file 4. Due to restricted sequence
data, we did not include Gymnopaxillus in the final analyses, but Dataset3 was analyzed to confirm the phylogenetic position of Gymnopaxillus within Serpulaceae and
together with Austropaxillus.
Phylogenetic analyses

Dataset1 and 2 were analyzed using both Maximum
Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian Inference (BI) phylogentic
methods. Dataset3 was analyzed using MP only. We performed preliminary MP phylogenetic analyses on each
DNA region separately to control visually for betweenregion incongruence prior to concatenation and final
phylogenetic analyses. For the MP analyses of the concatenated datasets and Dataset3 we used TNT [62]. We
performed heuristic searches with 2000 random addition
sequences and TBR branch swapping, saving ten trees
per replication. The resulting trees were swapped with

Skrede et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:230
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/230

TBR saving up to 10 000 trees. We set the collapsing rule
to minimum length = 0 and random seed was set to
“time”. Jackknife [63] resampling was performed with
2000 replicates (10 random entry orders and 10 trees
saved each repetition), 36% deletion, absolute frequencies
as output, and a cut-off value of 50%.
The best-fit evolutionary models were estimated using
the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the software
MrModeltest 2.3 [64] at the Bioportal http://www.bioportal.uio.no. We divided the datasets (Dataset1 and
Dataset2) into three partitions: (1) the ribosomal regions
(SSU, LSU and 5.8S; collectively nrDNA), (2) rpb2, and
(3) tef 1. The best-fit models for these three parts were:
GTR+I+G for the ribosomal regions, HKY+I+G for
rpb2, and SYM+I+G for tef 1.
For the BI analyses, we analyzed a partitioned (according to the above established parts) concatenated alignment of all five nuclear regions using MrBayes 3.1.2
[65,66] at the Bioportal. Bayesian posterior probabilities
were determined twice by running one cold and three
heated chains for six million generations, saving trees
every 1000th generation. To test whether the Markov
Chain converged, we monitored the standard deviation
of split frequencies (SDSF), and discarded as burn-in the
generations prior to the point when the SDSF fell below
0.01 when comparing two independent runs. A 50%
majority rule consensus tree was used to calculate posterior probabilities.
Divergence time estimation

We used Dataset2 (five DNA regions and 109 accessions) and the computer program Bayesian Evolutionary
Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) 1.6.1 [21] for estimating the posterior probability distribution of divergence
times in Serpulaceae. BEAST co-estimates phylogeny
and divergence times [67]. Details about the Bayesian
approach used in BEAST have been described by others
[12].
Xml-files for the BEAST analyses were constructed
using BEAUti 1.6.1 (BEAST package). We analyzed the
data under four different treatments; different clock
models (strict versus uncorrelated lognormal relaxed
[UCLD]), and different prior distributions for the calibrations (exponential versus lognormal). The xml-files of
uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock with exponential
and lognormal prior distributions are available as Additional file 5 and Additional file 6, respectively. Because
among branch rate heterogeneity within the data was
high, we also performed estimations without long-branch
taxa (indicated by arrows in Figure 1). However, as divergence time estimates from the analyses with and without
long-branch taxa were highly similar, only results from
the analysis including the long-branch taxa is presented
(see Results). We partitioned the data according to

Page 4 of 13

marker and codon position (only the two coding genes;
[1+2],3). Partitioning of data into markers and appropriate codon usage has been shown to produce shorter node
heights than unpartitioned analyses [68]. A Yule tree
prior was employed in all runs, which assumes a constant
speciation rate for each branch in the tree. A lognormal
distribution was used for the priors for all calibrated
nodes because it fixes the minimum age and allows the
maximum age to be sampled following a lognormal distribution with no hard upper limit.
Since there are no known fossils of Serpulaceae we used
an extensive outgroup for which fossils are available.
We included three primary calibration points (corresponding to the numbered nodes in Figure 2): (1) Quatsinoporites cranhamii Smith, Currah and Stockey from
the Early Creatceous (Barremian) [69]; (2) Archeomarasmius leggetti Hibbett, Grimaldi and Donoghue from the
early Late Cretaceous [70,71]; and, (3) a permineralized
“sulloid” ECM associated with Pinus roots of at least 50
million years [72]. We used the following lognormal settings (Mean in Real Space): (1) logmean = 2.0, logstdev
= 0.5, and offset = 125.0; (2) logmean = 2.5, logstdev =
0.5, and offset = 90.0; and, (3) logmean = 1.5, logstdev =
0.5, and offset = 50.0. The exponential settings were: (1)
mean = 3.0 and offset = 130.0; (2) mean = 3.2 and offset
= 90.0; and, (3) mean = 2.0 and offset = 50.0. These lognormal/exponential settings correspond approximately
to the following median and 95% HPD (squarebracketed; numbers rounded off to nearest million): (1)
127 [126-129]/132 [130-139]; (2) 92 (2) 92 [91-95]/92
[90-99]; and (3) 51 [50-53]/51 [50-56]. BEAST may get
stuck on local optima because it does not employ a
coupled MCMC. Thus, ten additional monophyletic sets
of taxa (indicated with black dots on Figure 2) were predefined in order to obtain a topology that corresponds
to the phylogeny obtained from a previous study [53]
that used a more robust phylogenetic method (e.g.
MrBayes) and more taxa. The Markov chains were run
for ten million generations, sampling and saving every
1000th tree. Convergence of the chain to stationary distributions was controlled by inspection of the MCMC
samples (Trace) in each analysis using the program Tracer 1.5 (BEAST package), and 1000 trees (i.e. 10%) were
discarded as burn-in prior to summarizing the posterior
distribution of trees and indentifying the maximum
clade credibility (MCC) tree using TreeAnnotator 1.6.1
(BEAST package). Each treatment was analyzed five
times to determine if the independent runs converged
on the same posterior distribution. In order to obtain
effective sample sizes (ESS) of more than 100 for all
parameters, we combined the log output files from separate runs with the same treatment using LogCombiner
1.6.1 (BEAST package). To compare the different clock
treatments, we monitored the “CoefficientOfVariation”

range as defined in this study. However, this observation
has not been confirmed by other studies.
We used two alternative event-based ancestral area
methods: (1) a Bayesian approach to dispersal-vicariance
analysis (DIVA [73]) as implemented in the computer
software Reconstruct Ancestral States in Phylogenies
(RASP [74]) and, (2) the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis
analysis (DEC [75]) implemented in the computer program LAGRANGE. The Bayesian approach in RASP is
built on the source code of MrBayes 3.1.2, and is a generalization of the methods used in Olsson et al. [76] and
Sanmartin et al. [77]. We chose the F81 model for the
Bayesian MCMC analyses, allowing for different rates of
change among ancestral areas. The Bayesian posterior
probabilities were determined twice by running 10 chains
fifty thousand generations, saving reconstructions every
100th generations.
The ancestral area analyses were conducted on the
posterior distribution of dated Serpulaceae trees estimated from BEAST. RASP analyses were carried out
using 103 randomly selected trees from BEAST.
The DEC analyses in LAGRANGE enables maximum
likelihood estimation of range inheritance scenarios at
cladogenesis events by modelling transitions between
discrete states (ranges) along phylogenetic branches as a
function of time. The DEC script was produced using a
web-based analysis configuration tool available from
http://www.reelab.net/lagrange/configurator/index.

Results
Phylogeny

In the MP analysis of Dataset1, we obtained 469 most
parsimonious trees (MPTs) of 4485 steps and with a
reconciled consistency index (RC) of 0.2 and a homoplasy
index (HI) of 0.69. Our results from the BI and MP analyses were largely congruent, but variously resolved. The
Bayesian 50% majority rule consensus tree is presented
with branch support (posterior probabilities [PP] and
parsimony jackknifing [JK]) superimposed in Figure 1.
Results render Serpulaceae monophyletic with Tapinellineae as phylogenetic sister (Figure 1). The Serpulaceae/
Tapinellineae group consists of brown rot species except
for the Austropaxillus clade. The brown rot species
belonging to Coniophora and Coniophoraceae appear as
a monophyletic group separated from the Serpulaceae/
Tapinellineae clade (Figure 1).
The saprotrophic Serpula himantioides and S. lacrymans appear as sister taxa in the phylogeny and together
form a monophyletic group (Figure 1). Serpula lacrymans
is further subdivided in two lineages representing the two
described varieties, var. lacrymans and var. shastensis
(see [43]). Austropaxillus forms a monophyletic sister to
the S. lacrymans/S. himantioides group that makes Serpula paraphyletic as currently circumscribed (Figure 1).

Page 7 of 13

A clade comprising the saprotrophic species Serpula
incrassata, S. pulverulenta and S. similis is recovered as
sister to all other Serpulaceae (Figure 1). The branch
leading to S. similis is very long, indicating an increased
rate of molecular evolution in this lineage.
The MP analysis of Dataset3 produced 16 MTPs of
311 steps, an RC of 0.90, and an HI of 0.06. The strict
consensus tree with JK values superimposed is presented
in the Additional files. A monophyletic Gymnopaxillus
group renders Austropaxillus paraphyletic (Additional
file 7, Figure. S1).
Divergence time estimation

The posterior distribution of the “CoefficientOfVariation”
suggests rejection of a strict clock for all gene partitions.
Relaxed (UCLD) clock analyses with lognormal versus
exponential priors for the calibrations estimated rather
similar age estimates of Serpulaceae divergences (Table 1).
The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree obtained from
the relaxed clock/lognormal treatment is presented in
Figure 2. A subsection of this chronogram, including
Serpulaceae only, is presented in Figure 3. Mean nodal age
estimates for numbered nodes in Figure 3 and their
respective 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals
are reported in Table 1.
According to the estimated divergence times, Serpulaceae diverged from the Tapinellineae during the Late
Cretaceous, and the mean crown-group age of Serpulaceae was estimated to about 64 (80-58) MyBP (Figure 2;
Table 1; Figure 3, clade 1). The three Serpula species,
S. incrassata, S. similis and S. pulverulenta (Figure 3,
clade 2) appear to be the oldest species within Serpulaceae, with divergences among sampled species evident
from the Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene (71-48
MyBP).
The divergence between the ECM group and the brown
rot species (Austropaxillus vs. S. lacrymans and S. himatioides) is estimated to have happened between the Late
Cretaceous to Late Eocene (66-35 MyBP; Figure 3, node
5). The posterior mean crown-group age of Austropaxillus
is approximately 22 (32-12) My (Figure 3, node 6). Subsequent speciation events of sampled Austropaxillus species
seem to suggest a fairly constant rate of speciation. The
divergence of the two widely distributed Serpula lacrymans and S. himantioides is estimated to have occurred in
Miocene; the mean age estimate being 16 MyBP (Figure 3,
node 9). Intraspecific diversification leading to varieties
and cryptic species within S. lacrymans and S. himantioides is estimated to have occurred during the Miocene
and Pliocene (Figure 3).

Results from various analyses of Dataset2 (node numbers refer to Figure. 3): branch support, mean node ages, the 95% highest posterior density values (HPD;
depicted as grey bars in Figure. 3) from analyses using a relaxed clock with lognormal and exponential settings, and inferred ancestral areas at internal nodes
(RASP) and branches (DEC; relative probability of an area reported for branch leading to numbered node). Areas with a relative probability of > 0.01 in the DEC
and RASP analyses are reported. Unit areas: A = western North America, B = eastern North America, C = western Eurasia, D = eastern Eurasia, E = southern South
America, F = Australia + New Zealand, G = Old World Tropical.

summarized in Table 1 and Figure 3. The inferred
ancestral areas at internal nodes estimated using the
Bayesian RASP correspond largely to the results
obtained from the maximum likelihood estimates in
DEC. RASP estimated more combined ancestral areas
than DEC, and the RASP estimates have generally a
higher relative probability for each ancestral area
(Table 1).
The maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral
areas for the internal nodes of Serpulaceae show that
the most recent common ancestor (tmrca) of clades 2-4
(Figure 3, node 5) most likely appeared in western
North America during the Paleocene-Eocene boundary.
Range expansion of one daughter lineage, Austropaxillus
(Figure 3, clade 2), into South America, Australia and/or
New Zealand some time during the Eocene to Mid Miocene followed this. The divergence into one mainly
southern South American clade (node 8) and one
Australian/New Zealand clade (node 7) is estimated to
have happened about 15 (24-7) MyBP. The second

daughter lineage, tmrca of S. himantioides and S. lacrymans (Figure 3, clades 3-4, node 9), most likely occurred
in western North America during the Early Eocene to
Mid Miocene.

Discussion
Molecular phylogenetics of Serpulaceae

Our results based on five nuclear DNA regions corroborate the monophyly of Serpulaceae sensu Jarosch [50].
Moreover, a close relationship between the saprotrophic
Serpula and the ectomycorrhizal Austropaxillus is supported, as already indicated in previous studies based on
more restricted taxon samplings and fewer genetic markers [37,50]. Gymnopaxillus nested within the Australian
Austropaxillus clade (Additional file 7, Figure. S1) in the
nrLSU analysis. Traditionally, Serpula has been recognised as a member of Coniophoraceae [39,78]. Our
molecular results clearly show that Serpula is only distantly related to Coniophora, supporting the treatment
of Serpulaceae [50] as a separate family that comprises

the three genera Austropaxillus, Gymnopaxillus and
Serpula. That Austropaxillus and Gymnopaxillus are
nested within Serpula suggests taxonomic changes are
needed to accommodate this monophyly. Unfortunately
we were unable to include samples from South American Gymnopaxillus species, so our results call for
further analyses including more markers and samples
from this group.
Historical biogeography of Serpulaceae

Our results indicate a Late Cretaceous origin of extant
Serpulaceae, between 94 and 74 MyBP (Figure 2) in temperate North America (Figure 3). The Gymnosperm genus
Pinus is the main substrate of Serpulaceae in the Northern
Hemisphere. Pinus, is estimated to have evolved during
the Cretaceous, between 155 and 87 MyBP [79]. Thus the
age of Pinus corresponds well with the timing of the evolution of Serpulaceae on Pinus wood. Moreover, the fossil
record supports the presence of Pinaceae members in the
high-latitude and high-altitude regions of North America
during the early Cenozoic [72]. This supports our result,
as the main host of Serpulaceae was available at the time
of origin.
The initial divergence of extant Austropaxillus taxa
into one mainly southern South American clade and one
Australian/New Zealand clade about 22 (32-12) MyBP
(Figure 3, node 6) must represent a long distance dispersal event, and is consistent with a biogeographical tract
referred to by Crisp et al as a pan-temperate tract [80].
Nor does the relatively recent split between northern and
southern hemisphere taxa in Serpulaceae support an
ancient Gondwanan distribution of Austropaxillus. However, there have been fierce discussions of the time and
climatic conditions of the Gondwanan break-up [81].
Land bridges have been suggested between Antarctica
and Australia up until 28 MyBP [82,83]. During this period Antarctica was probably glaciated [81] and may have
been too hostile for temperate fungi. Thus, even if we
cannot rule out vicariance, we consider long distance dispersal a more plausible explanation. Moreover, the divergence times estimated within Serpulaceae can be
expected to be somewhat younger due to the node density effect [84], supporting a long-distance dispersal
event.
The divergence between Austropaxillus macnabbi from
New Zealand and A. muelleri from Tasmania (Figure 3,
node 7) must have resulted from a more recent dispersal
event. New Zealand was separated from South America
and Australia about 80 MyBP [82], i.e. about 60 My years
before the split at node 7 (24-7 MyBP). Interestingly,
the same recent divergence between species from New
Zealand and Australia have also been found for Nothofagus [85], the host of Austropaxillus, and its fungal parasite
Cyttaria [86]. Long distance dispersal is also suggested in

Page 10 of 13

order to explain the divergence between Austropaxillus sp.
from Tasmania and A. statuum from southern South
America (Figure 3). However, as the sister-relationship
between the two species is weakly supported, more data is
needed to confirm or reject this long distance dispersal
hypothesis. Additional fungal disjunctions that are too
young to be caused by Gondwanan breakup, and thus are
explained by long-distance dispersal have been reported
elsewhere (e.g. [10,11,18]).
Assuming western North America as the true ancestral area at node 5 (Figure 3), the presence of southern
South American species in both clade 2 (Austropaxillus)
and clade 4 (S. himantioides) must be explained by independent long-distance dispersal events. This can be concluded, because Laurasia (incl. North America) and
Gondwana (incl. southern South America) were separated by the east-west Tethyan seaway from the latest
Jurassic (c 150 MyBP) to the end of Pliocene (c 3
MyBP; [87]). This seaway represented a major dispersal
barrier to most terrestrial organisms. Not until the
establishment of the Great American Interchange (GAI;
ca. 3 MyBP) was there land connection between North
and South America (Figure 3). Although the two dispersals happened at different times, none correspond to
time periods of land-connection between North and
South America. Moreover, the large distributional gap
between North American and southern South American
sister-taxa of Serpula (see inset map in Figure 3) favours
long distance dispersals to historically continuous distributions with subsequent vicariance. Still, the distinctness
of the disjunct lineages indicates that such inter-area
dispersals are not frequent. Nevertheless, historical long
distance dispersal has been reported in several mycogeographic studies (e.g. [11,18,88]), and dispersal between
northern and southern temperate regions of the world
seems to have occurred in other fungal groups also (e.g.
[10,20]) and plants [80].
All taxa represented in clade 3 (Figure 3) belong to the
same morphospecies, Serpula lacrymans. The chronogram
shows that the divergence of the two varieties occurred
about 9 (13-4) MyBP (Figure 3, node 10). The presence of
western North American and eastern Eurasian phylogenetic sister-taxa are indicative of a trans-Beringian distribution of their most recent common ancestor with
subsequent vicariance (Figure 3). About 14-3.5 MyBP,
there was continuous boreal forests across Beringia (Figure
3, BLB2; [89]). It seems likely therefore, that S. lacrymans
had a continuous distribution from northern North America and into Eurasia and that var. lacrymans became differentiated from var. shastensis due to Beringan vicariance
(Figure 3). Comparison of ancient permafrost-preserved
(plant-parasitic) fungal DNA from north-eastern Siberia to
modern tundra macrofungi indicate a shift in fungal diversity following the last ice-age [90], a scenario probably

reiterated many times during the Pleistocene producing
allopatric populations. Migration across a North Atlantic
landbridge (NALB) has sometimes been used as an alternative explanation to Nearctic-Palearctic disjunctions, but
this bridge disappeared by Mid Eocene (Figure 3; [89]) –
i.e. about 30 My before the estimated divergence of the
two varieties. Historical Beringian distributions with subsequent vicariance and range expansion southwards have
been shown also in Amanita [91] and Tricholoma [92],
and we suspect that additional Beringian disjunctions
would have been identified if the Holarctic was not treated
as a single area in mycogeography (see e.g. [11,20]).

family. A single transition from brown rot to ECM
occurred within the Serpulaceae. The dating analysis
indicates that this transition happened between 50 and
22 MyBP. Most Serpulaceae divergences seem to have
happened within continents (Australia, South American,
and North America). A combination of long distance
dispersals for the southern hemisphere taxa and vicariance for the northern hemisphere taxa is used to
explain the distribution of extant Serpulaceae taxa. The
dating analysis indicates that the divergence of the two
varieties of Serpula lacrymans occurred between 13 and
4 MyBP due to Beringian vicariance.

Evolution of nutritional modes in Serpulaceae

Additional material

According to our results, the transition to ECM has happened only once in Serpulaceae, in the lineage leading to
Austropaxillus (Figure 1). Transition from a saprotrophic
to ectomycorrhizal nutritional mode is a common ecological transition [28]. The common ancestor of Austropaxillus and Gymnopaxillus diverged from the saprotrophic
clade about 50 MyBP. The temperature decline and a
drier climate in the end of the Eocene and the onset of
Oligocene may have promoted this transition from saprotrophy to mycorrhiza. When growing in nature, S. lacrymans mainly occurs on substrates in close contact with
the ground (H. Kauserud, personal observations), and it
seems to be a geophilous fungus that may transport water
from the ground and into the substrate. Whether such an
adaptation could be a first step towards mycorrhizal symbiosis is a subject for future investigation.
Our results indicate that the mycorrhizal Austropaxillus/
Gymnopaxillus lineage diverged from the saprotrophic
S. lacrymans/S. himantioides group about 50 (66-35)
MyBP and that the radiation of extant Austropaxillus/
Gymnopaxillus taxa commenced about 22 (32-12) MyBP
(Figure 3). A more recent split between Austropaxillus
and S. lacrymans (53.1-15 MyBp) was suggested in a
recent paper analyzing a smaller dataset of genomesequenced fungi [93]. The differences between these studies can probably largely be explained by taxon sampling.
Because of the focus of this study, we have included more
samples from the Serpulaceae compared to other fungal
families; this could give a somewhat older age according
to the node density effect [84] as argued above. Fossilized
ECM demonstrates that ECM associations had evolved at
least 50 MyBP, probably with a Pinus-host [94]. It has
been suggested that the radiation of ECM fungi happened
as the obligate ECM hosts (Pinaceae and Fagales) became
dominant in temperate forests as a consequence of drying
and cooling from the Late Eocene [16,20].

Additional file 7: Serpulaceae nrLSU phylogeny including
Gymnopaxillus. Strict consensus tree from a maximum parsimony
analysis of the nuclear ribosomal LSU region of 38 Serpulaceae taxa.
Bondarcevomyces taxi was used as outgroup. The 16 most parsimonious
trees (MPTs) were 311 steps long and had a rescaled consistency index
of 0.90 and homoplasy index of 0.06. Jackknife support values (2000
replicates) are superimposed on the branches, showing that the included
Gymnopaxillus spp. (grey shading) are nested within Austropaxillus with
high support.
