Abstract
Background: Various mechanisms such as geographic barriers and glacial episodes have been
proposed as determinants of intra-specific and inter-specific differentiation of populations, and the
distribution of their genetic diversity. More recently, habitat and climate differences, and
corresponding adaptations have been shown to be forces influencing the phylogeographic evolution
of some vertebrates. In this study, we examined the contribution of these various factors on the
genetic differentiation of the bent-winged bat, Miniopterus schreibersii, in southeastern Europe and
Anatolia.
Results and conclusion: Our results showed differentiation in mitochondrial DNA coupled with
weaker nuclear differentiation. We found evidence for restriction of lineages to geographical areas
for hundreds of generations. The results showed that the most likely ancestral haplotype was
restricted to the same geographic area (the Balkans) for at least 6,000 years. We were able to
delineate the migration routes during the population expansion process, which followed the coasts
and the inland for different nested mitochondrial clades. Hence, we were able to describe a
scenario showing how multiple biotic and abiotic events including glacial periods, climate and
historical dispersal patterns complemented each other in causing regional and local differentiation
within a species.

Background
The geographic transitions between continents can result
in species diversification and endemism, forming regions
of allopatry, and contact zones for divergent flora and
fauna. Sulawesi, for instance, an island located between

Continental Asia and Australia, has elements of both faunal assemblages within its boundaries, hosting an elevated number of species and endemics [1]. Mexico, as
another example, being located in a transition zone
between tropical central America, and temperate North

a) The geographic positions of the area of interest. The squares and circles depict the localities that have individuals with clade S and clade P haplotypes, respectively. The details of the sampling localities are provided in Table 1.
The colors of the squares correspond to 2nd level nested clades in Figure 1b. Specifically, the purple squares designate the distribution of the putative most ancestral haplotype, S15, of the entire network. The light blue squares designate the most ancestral haplotype, S3, in the light blue 2nd level nested clade, 2.3. The green squares represent all of the haplotypes comprising
green 2nd level nested clade, 2.2. When the squares comprise more than one color, they represent haplotypes comprising purple or light blue 2nd level nested clades, other than S15 or S3, being found in the particular locality. For instance, the purple/
white coloring of localities 14, 15 and 16 indicate that haplotypes belonging to the purple nested clade, 2.1, are found in it, but
none of these are the haplotype S15. Similarly, in localities 20 and 28, designated as light blue and white, haplotypes belonging
to the light blue nested clade, 2.2, are found, but none of these are the haplotype S3. In locality 19, haplotypes belonging to the
purple (but not S15) and light blue (but not S3) are found. Finally in localities 25 and 26, in addition to the red 2nd level nested
clade, 2.4, haplotypes, non-S15 purple and non-S3 light-blue haplotypes are found. b) NCA diagram for clade S. The colored
polygrams represent the four, second-level nested clades.

America is considered to be a megadiversity country [2].
Within the temperate zones, southeastern Europe and
Anatolia are located within a similar geographical transition centered in between Europe, Asia and Africa (Figure
1a). As such, this region comprises an interesting area for
investigation as a zone of allopatry with geographical barriers to gene flow [3,4], a contact zone for divergent biota
from different continents and climatic regimes, and a refugium for the entire western Palearctics [5,6].
In this study, we examined the nuclear and mitochondrial
genetic structure of the bent-winged bat, Miniopterus schreibersii, in southeastern Europe and Anatolia. M. schreibersii is a colonial, cave-dwelling [7], and polytypic species
with one of the largest Old World ranges among mammals. Its global distribution spans the Palearctics, Africa
and Australia, with 17 subspecies described [8,9]. Recent
studies showed high levels of nuclear and mitochondrial
genetic structure in a congeneric species, Minipterus
natalensis in South Africa [10]. Differentiation has also
been reflected in taxonomy of this species in Australia

[11], and southeastern Europe and Anatolia [12], where
three and two subspecies have been described, respectively.
Observing the genetic differentiation in this species in
southeastern Europe and Anatolia, our goal was to try
teasing apart the differential contribution of various factors that can contribute to its genetic differentiation. Topographical features in the region, including the Taurus
Mountains, the eastern Anatolian Diagonal Mountain
Chain and the Sea of Marmara (Figure 1a) are potential
barriers to gene flow that could result in allopatric differentiation of populations. For instance, The Marmara was
proposed as a potential barrier preventing the secondary
contact of isolated refugial populations in another bat
species, the greater horseshoe bat [13]. The region is also
interesting due to different climates regimes that co-exist,
as differential adaptations to these could promote population divergence. In addition to drastic differences in precipitation between the coastal and inland regions, there
also exist regional differences in climate. For instance, the

The localities where samples from Bilgin et al. [12] were used in the current study are shown in bold. From Kemah, only one individual was sampled
in Bilgin et al. [12].

Mediterranean coast, the Black Sea coast and the Marmara
region all show slight differences in terms of temperature
and precipitation patterns [14]. The glacial history of the
region, especially at the Pleistocene, is another candidate
for having caused divergence of populations. The Balkans
is one of the main glacial refugial areas for the entire
Europe [15,16], and the Caucasus is an important refugium for western Asia and the Middle East in general
[17,18]. Anatolia is located in between these two major
refugial areas, and this proximity could have left a signature on the genetic make-up of populations. To address
these questions, we used nuclear microsatellite markers,
as well as mtDNA markers, comprising the next logical
step to the previous study of Bilgin et al. [12], which had

used only mtDNA data to mainly evaluate the taxonomic
status of M. schreibersii in this region. In the end, we were
able to construct a scenario outlining the historical details
of the genetic differentiation of M. schreibersii in the transition between Europe and Anatolia.

Methods
Sampling
121 individuals of M. schreibersii were sampled in 34 locations in Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey (Figure 1a and Table
1), spanning a range of about 1700 km. This comprises an
increase from 58 individuals in 14 locations that was used
in the previous study of Bilgin et al. [12], on the same species. The caves where samples from Bilgin et al. [12] were

used in the current study are indicated in Table 1. Fieldwork was undertaken, in the years 2004 and 2005, in
August, to avoid disturbing the nursery colonies. Through
inspection of the degree of fusion of the phalangeal epiphyses, the adult status of the sampled bats was confirmed, and no juvenile bats were sampled [19]. Tissue for
genetics analysis was collected from each of the wing
membranes (plagiopatagium) of individual bats by using
biopsy-punches (3 mm diameter) as outlined by Worthington Wilmer and Barratt [20]. The 3 mm holes in each
wing are known to heal in approximately four weeks.
Laboratory Methods
Mitochondrial DNA
For mtDNA analysis, the hyper variable region I of the
control region (HV1), tRNA-proline and tRNA-threonine
genes, and a partial cytochrome b sequence were
sequenced. Half of a biopsy punch was used for each individual's DNA extraction, with a DNeasy Extraction Kit,
following the manufacturer's protocols (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). The primers C and E, and the PCR conditions
were used as described in Wilkinson and Chapman [21]
for DNA amplification. This was followed by cycle
sequencing, both in 5' and 3' directions, using the primers
C and E, respectively. This involved 25 cycles in 10 μl reactions, which were composed of 1 μl of PCR product, 5.7
μl of H2O, 0.3 μl of primer (20 μM), 1 μl of florescent dye
(ABI Big Dye) and 2 μl of 5× buffer (provided with the florescent dye). The cycle sequencing parameters for each
cycle were 10 seconds of denaturation at 96°C, 5 seconds
of annealing at 50°C and 4 minutes of extension at 68°C,
followed by a final extension of 7 minutes at 72°C. The
sequencing reactions were cleaned using ethanol precipitation and run in an ABI 3730 automated sequencer following the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems,
Inc.). The resulting sequences were assembled using
Sequencher 4.1 (Gene Codes Corp.), and aligned using
Clustal X [22] prior to further data analysis.
Microsatellites
Four microsatellite primer pairs (Mschreib2, Mschreib3,
Mschreib4 and Mschreib5) designed for M. schreibersii
[10] and two pairs (D5S1457 and D6S271) designed for
humans, which also amplify in baboons [23], were used
to amplify and genotype six nuclear loci. The PCR amplifications were carried out with a QIAGEN Multiplex kit
following the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction volume was cut down by a factor of five (10 μl instead of the
manufacturer's recommended 50 μl) to decrease the overall cost, while 1 μl of template DNA was used. The optimal
annealing temperature for each locus was found through
a gradient PCR. The PCR reactions were successful at the
annealing temperature of 57°C for all loci, except
Mschreib2 and Mschreib4, which yielded amplicons at
61°C. A homozygote individual was sequenced for each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/209

locus using the respective forward and reverse primers, so
as to confirm the identity of the repeat motifs with the
published ones. The PCR products were run in an ABI
Automated Sequencer 3730, using a Rox label (ABI, CA)
to size the fragments, in a volume composed of 8.9 μl of
High Dye (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), 0.1 μl of Rox, and 1
μl of PCR product for each sample. The final sizes of the
fragments were computed in GeneMapper (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and scored manually. The homozygous
individuals were amplified and scored three times to
avoid allelic dropout and confirm allele sizes; as for the
heterozygous individuals, they were amplified and scored
until the sizes matched in two separate runs.
Data analysis
Mitochondrial DNA
Basic descriptive statistics and genetic diversity parameters
such as haplotype diversity (h), nucleotide diversity (π)
and number of polymorphic sites [24,25], were calculated
in DnaSP 4.20.2 [26]. These calculations were also made
for the reciprocally monophyletic clades S and P, see
below, separately. We reconstructed the phylogeny of the
haplotypes using distance (neighbor-joining, NJ) and
maximum parsimony analyses, and the software PAUP*
4.06b [27]. Nodal support for NJ and maximum parsimony trees were evaluated by 1000 bootstrap replicates.
The substitution model to be used for building the distance matrix was selected by applying a likelihood ratio
test for the goodness of fit of various substitution models
to the data by using the program Modeltest 3.7 [28]. For
the neighbor joining tree, the model of nucleotide evolution, selected by Modeltest, which fit the data best was
that of Hasegawa et al. [29] [(HKY85) + Γ [30], shape
parameter = 0.07] and was used in the construction of the
NJ tree. In the maximum parsimony analysis, TBR (tree
bisection and reconnection) was used as the branch-swapping algorithm as it is the most effective routine for recovering an optimum set of cladograms [31]. Gaps were
treated as missing data. The sequences were checked for
any evidence for saturation, using percent genetic divergence versus transition/transversion plots in DAMBE [32].
When there was evidence for saturation, the parsimony
analysis was adjusted using a step matrix by weighting
transversions inversely against transitions, based on their
frequency. The ratio of transitions to transversions was
calculated following Nei and Kumar [33] in MEGA4
(Tamura et al., 2007). MEGA4 was also used to compute
the genetic distances between clades S and P, using maximum likelihood composite distances. Average number of
substitutions per site (Dxy) was calculated using DnaSP
4.20.2.

Differentiation in mtDNA was also explored using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [34], by calculating
the Fst analogue Φst. The program ARLEQUIN 2.0 [33] was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/209

used to make the AMOVA calculations for mtDNA. The
AMOVA calculations included two separate groupings.
One of these was based on grouping clades S and P as separate populations. The second set of regional groups was
prepared to test for the effect of geographical barriers to
gene flow. These included four groups, which comprised
sampling sites to the west of the Marmara Sea (sites 1–18
in Figure 1), between the Marmara Sea, the Taurus and the
eastern Anatolian Diagonal (sites 13–24, 30), to the south
of the Taurus (25–29), and to the east of the eastern Anatolian Diagonal (sites 31–34).

alleles in clades S and P for each locus, are provided in the
additional file. All of these computations were made
using Genalex 6.1 [44]. In addition, corrected number of
private alleles were calculated using a rarefaction method,
and the software HP-rare [45]. Global and locus-by-locus
AMOVA were made, and unbiased Fst and Rst estimators
[of θst [46] and ρst [47], respectively] were also calculated
using Genalex 6.1. Both Fst and Rst estimators were calculated to account for the possible underestimation of Fst in
detecting genetic differentiation when analyzing microsatellites [48].

Nested clade analysis (NCA) was used to determine the
causes of intraspecific structure, if any. The program TCS
[35] was used to build a statistical parsimony network and
subsequently GeoDIS 2.0 [36] was used for making an
NCA. We used the inference key of 11/11/2005 from
http://darwin.uvigo.es/download/
geodisKey_11Nov05.pdf

Results

Evidence for population expansion was explored using
the neutrality test statistics R2 [37] and FS [38] in DnaSP.
Based on simulation models, among various statistics that
determine signatures of past population growth, R2 and FS
are the two that have the greatest statistical power [35].
The significance of these statistics was assessed with 1000
coalescent simulations. In addition, Bayesian Skyline
plots [39] were used to detect changes in effective population sizes in the past. We estimated the divergence times
of reciprocally monophyletic clades using a Bayesian coalescent approach implemented in BEAST 1.4.6. [39]. The
HKY + Γ, as revealed by Modeltest, were used as the substitution and site heterogeneity models, respectively.
Again, based on Modeltest, The Γ prior was set to 0.07.
The tree model prior was determined by using a UPGMA
tree to construct an initial tree, and the mean rate and covariance priors were set to uniform values. The chain was
run for 100,000,000 generations, making sure that the
ESS values of each statistic was at least 1000. Convergence
was examined in TRACER 1.4 http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/
Tracer.
Microsatellites
Basic tests of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage
disequilibrium were carried out in FSTAT [40]. Sequential
Bonferroni corrections were made to correct for levels of
significance for multiple tests [41]. The software MicroChecker [42] was used to test for the presence of stutter
bands, large allelic drop-out, and null-alleles. The unbiased number of alleles (based on sample size) was calculated in FSTAT, using a method of rarefaction [43]. The
expected and observed heterozygosities and their P values
(for the entire data set, and separately for clades S and P),
the uncorrected number of alleles, allelic diversity (in
terms of effective number of alleles, Ne), and frequency of

Mitochondrial DNA
For the analysis of mtDNA, 433 base pairs of mtDNA
spanning cytochrome b (58 bp), tRNA-threonine (71 bp),
tRNA-proline (66 bp) and HV1 (238 bp) were sequenced
for 121 individuals. These sequences have been deposited
to GenBank with the accession numbers EU332355–
EU332392 and EU332393–EU332402. In this fragment,
there were 52 polymorphic sites, 43 of which were parsimony informative. A total of 49 haplotypes were found.
The haplotype diversity (h) was 0.926 (S.D. = 0.015) and
nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.02593 (S.D. = 0.00327).

Phylogenetic trees for M. schreibersii were constructed
using neighbor joining and parsimony methods (Figure
2a). A sample of M. schreibersii from Indonesia was
included in the analysis as an outgroup. In the neighbor
joining tree, two monophyletic clades have been identified, clade S and clade P, with high bootstrap support
(83% and 100%, respectively). A heuristic maximum parsimony search also gave high bootstrap support to the
nodes delimiting clades S (98%) and P (81%). In this
analysis, the transversions were weighted against transitions based on their frequency (1:7). The C.I and R.I were
both 0.908 for this tree.
In terms of descriptive statistics, a total of 38 haplotypes
were found as belonging to clade S, in 102 individuals.
Within clade S, there were a total of 37 polymorphic sites,
24 of which were parsimony-informative. Haplotype
diversity was 0.932 (S.D. = 0.014) and nucleotide diversity was 0.00689 (S.D. = 0.00043). Within clade P, there
were ten haplotypes, found in 19 bats, comprised of ten
polymorphic sites of which six were parsimony-informative. Haplotype diversity was 0.897 (S.D. = 0.056) and
nucleotide diversity was 0.0056 (S.D. = 0.00089).
The number of fixed and percent nucleotide differences
between the haplotype groups is provided in Table 2, to
give an idea of the extent of differentiation of groups. The
percent divergence (modified from Dxy) between clades S
and P was 7.94%. The maximum composite likelihood
distance between the clades was almost identical (0.078,

nucleotide differences within each haplogroup, which
ranged between 0 and 0.68%.

Posterior Density = 169,000–299,000 years BP). In these
calculations, a molecular clock rate based on 20% per million years differentiation of D-loop in the noctule bat
[49], which falls between the estimate for house mouse
[10% per million years [50]) and bison (30% per million
years [51]] was used.
Another mathematical treatment of the differentiation
between clades S and P was made with an AMOVA. The
pairwise Φst was 0.92 and significantly greater than zero (P
< 0.01, 1000 permutations). The percent of variance
attributable to differences between clades was 92%,
whereas this variance value within clades was 8% (Table
3). In terms of geographical distribution, both haplotypes
belonging to clade S and P appeared on either side of any
putative geographic barrier. In addition, using the tree
approach, within either clade P or S, there didn't seem to
be any geographically meaningful clusters. The AMOVA
results, when made using the potential geographic barriers to define populations, showed that the percent of variation attributable to among group differences was 27%
(Table 4).
Several additional analyses were made to detect the causes
of this genetic structure within clades S and P by building
a statistical parsimony network for each (Figure 2b and
Figure 2c, respectively). Both of these networks showed
star-like phylogenies, which is characteristic of expanding
populations [35]. For clade S, haplotypes comprising
nodes of expansion are colored in black (Figure 2b). A
similar pattern of a star-like network was found for clade
P, however there was only one potentially ancestral haplotype (P1, Figure 2c).

Given this pattern of star-like networks, indicative of population expansion, the significance of these patterns was
checked through the statistics R2 and FS. As the AMOVA
indicated a significant genetic break between clade S and
clade P, the analyses were run separately for each clade.
For clade S, both of these statistics, whose values were
0.0385 and -32.2963, respectively, indicated significant
expansions, as the probability of getting values lower than
these was < 0.01 (1000 replicates). For clade P, the pattern
was a similar one of significant R2 and FS, whose values
were 0.0880 (P < 0.05) and -4.8960 (P < 0.01), respectively. Also the frequency of pairwise nucleotide differences of haplotypes was plotted with expectations under a
constant-size model and a model of range expansion. The
plots for both clade S and P fit a range expansion model
better than a constant size model (Figures 3a–d). The
Bayesian skyline plots for clades S and P also showed patterns of population expansion, initiating around 15,000
(Figure 4a) and 5,500 (Figure 4b) years ago, respectively.
Nested Clade Analysis (NCA) was applied to the statistical
parsimony networks to infer if there were any geographic
patterns within clades S and P. During the building of the
nested cladogram, when a particular haplotype could not
immediately be assigned to a nesting clade due to its position, it was included in the clade that had the smallest
sample size, to increase the statistical strength of that nesting clade. In clade P, no significant associations between
haplotypes were found and the hypothesis of panmixia
could not be rejected. The nested cladograms for clade S
showed four different second level nested clades (Figure
1b), with some significant associations. Based on expectations from the coalescent theory, the haplotype S15,
within the purple nested clade (2.1), being the haplotype
with the highest frequency, and the one that gave rise to
the greatest number of haplotypes, was the most likely
ancestral haplotype. This haplotype showed a distribution
almost exclusively restricted to the Balkans (Figure 1a).
The central haplotype (S3) of the light blue nested clade
(2.3) budded off from the ancestral nested clade 2.1, and
had a distribution along the Mediterranean coast. The red
nested clade (2.4), which was directly connected to S3,
was exclusively found along the Mediterranean coast. The
green nested clade (2.2), which also derived out of the
purple nested clade, showed a distribution predominantly
restricted to the Black Sea coast.

In terms of climate, the average for annual precipitation in
localities for clade P bats was lower than that for clade S
bats (Table 5). The difference was statistically significant
(P = 7.84*10-33, unpaired t-test, N = 33). With respect to
the precipitation values, there was no overlap in the confidence intervals of the localities of clades S and P.
Microsatellites
In microsatellite analyses, none of the loci showed any
evidence for linkage disequilibrium, after sequential Bonferroni corrections. The loci Mschreib4 and Mschreib5
were found not to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A
separate analysis of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, for
each mtDNA clade, indicated that clade S was not in equilibrium and this probably was the cause for the overall
disequilibrium when the two clades were analyzed
together. The disequilibrium in these two loci was due to
the presence of null alleles, and the microsatellite allele
and genotype frequencies were adjusted, using the program Micro-Checker, prior to further data analyses.

population, and they had relatively low frequencies (less
than 5%), except three alleles, which had frequencies over
10%. These were alleles 194 in locus Mschreib2 (31.3%),
133 in locus Mschreib3 (16.7%) in clade P, and 190 in
locus Mschreib5 (13.4%) in clade S. There were also some
differences in the frequencies of certain alleles, although
they were not private alleles. For instance the allele size
range series between 130–140 bp had a high frequency
(33.4%) in clade P, however only two alleles in this series
(133 and 137 bp) were found in clade S, in one individual
each. For these two loci, based on the corrected number of
private alleles, these differences were reflected as a higher
number of private alleles for clade P, when compared to
clade S (Additional File, Table AF7). Although to a smaller
extent, the AMOVA of microsatellite loci, compared based
on the two mtDNA clades also supported the break (Table
6), with a cumulative Fst value 0.023 that was significantly
greater than zero (P = 0.010, 1000 permutations). The Rst
value was comparable, but slightly higher (0.037), suggesting that Fst slightly underestimated genetic differentiation when compared to Rst.

A pattern of allelic differences was seen in loci Mschreib2
and Mschreib3, with Clade P individuals having relatively
smaller sized alleles. There were private alleles in each

Discussion
Anatolian Suture Zone
Suture zones are often observed after postglacial range
expansions where lineages that diverged in allopatry meet
again [16]. In Europe, there are many different examples
of an east/west division of lineages of animals and plants
that diverged in separate refugia [52]. Genetic suture
zones were also observed for bats in the Balkans and Anatolia [53-55]. In this study, for M. schreibersii, a similar
suture zone, of two divergent mitochondrial clades, was
seen within Anatolia. Although to a smaller extent, this
differentiation in mtDNA was also reflected in the nuclear
genome. The Bayesian estimate of the time to the most
recent common ancestor of these two clades was 233,000
years BP (169,000–299,000 years BP), supporting a scenario of secondary contact after differentiation in isolation during the Pleistocene. The geographical distribution
of clade S and clade P are in conformation with the previous study of Bilgin et al. [12], with clade S being found
predominantly to the west, and clade P to the east. These
results support the idea that the clade S differentiated in
the Balkans, and clade P in refugia to the east of the Turkish border, in Armenia, Georgia or Iran during the glacial
maxima in the last ice age. After the conditions became
more hospitable, the two clades expanded into their current distribution, forming a suture zone in between, due
to secondary contact.

Evaluation of whether the observed mtDNA differentiation was reflected in the nuclear genome, using microsatellites, did not provide any strong evidence for the
presence of reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation.
Although there was some statistically significant differentiation in microsatellites, the actual quantitative levels
were low. Considering the nuclear locus that reflects the

mitochondrial divide the best, Mschreib2, allele 194 was
found only in individuals belonging to clade P with a frequency of 31.3%. Putting into consideration the point
that none of these were homozygotes, 62.5% of the individuals had this allele. However, even with this frequency,
it is not possible to assign the remaining 37.5% of individuals to either clade based on this locus. Another locus in
M. schreibersii, Mschreib3, showed a similar break with all
of the eighteen typed individuals except two in clade P
having at least one allele smaller than 140 bases. However, still, two individuals in clade S had alleles in this size
range, suggesting that a hypothesis of nuclear gene-flow
among the two clades cannot be rejected. Hence it might
be possible to conclude that although differentiation in
refugia might have resulted in frequency differences in
certain allele/locus combinations, this did not necessarily
result in reproductive isolation.
Considering the details of the geographic distribution of
each clade, clade S showed more of a coastal distribution,
as opposed to clade P, which had a distribution restricted
to inland. This kind of coastal vs. inland genetic differentiation has been observed in other species including mammals, e.g., Atlantic tree rats [56], lesser long-nosed bat
[57], birds (e.g., swamp sparrow [58]), and plants (e.g.,
western white pine [59]). The significant differences
between climate parameters with respect to distribution of
these mitochondrial coastal and inland clades suggest
some kind of climatic association for each clade. In Anatolia, coastal areas exhibit a more humid climate, in comparison to more steppe-like and drastically drier climates
inland [4]. Precipitation can influence vegetation, insect
density and composition in a region [60]. The distribution of the mitochondrial clades being closely associated
with different rainfall intensities suggests that local adap-

tations to different habitats and climate regimes might
have been a determinant of the differentiation of the species in the region. This kind of climatic association supports results from another congeneric species, M.
natalensis in South Africa, which suggested an association
between different biomes and population substructure
[10].
In terms of other potential causal factors underlying this
genetic break, none of the topographic barriers (the Marmara Sea, the Taurus Mountains or the eastern Anatolia
Diagonal) seemed to be prominent impediments to dispersal. Individuals belonging to either clade S or clade P
were found on either side of a putative barrier. Although
AMOVA analysis showed some significant differences
between regions as defined by geographic barriers (Φst =
0.27), these differences were not as obvious as those seen
when comparing clades S and P with each other (Φst =
0.92). Also, the geographic differences did not hold up in
all of the comparisons of the regions. For instance, significant differences were found between southern Anatolia
and western Anatolia. However, no significant differences
were found with comparisons of southern Anatolia and
eastern Anatolia, even though Taurus Mountains delimits
the border for southern Anatolia with both of the other
regions. Hence although there is some genetic structure
within the clades, the cause of this is probably not geographic barriers. The study of Bilgin et al. [12] had suggested that the Marmara and the Taurus were not likely to
be impediments to dispersal, and the results of this study
suggest that, in addition, the eastern Anatolian Diagonal
does not seem to limit gene flow. Although some studies
indicate that physical barriers can impede gene flow in
bats [13,61,62], the results of this study also suggest that
similar to two other bat species investigated in this region
(Rhinolophus euryale [53], and Myotis capacinnii [54]), geographic barriers do not seem to limit gene flow for M. schreibersii.
Scenarios of post-glacial expansion
Further analysis gave additional support to the idea of
postglacial expansions as the best explanation for the
mtDNA differentiation. Statistical parsimony networks
for both clade S and clade P showed star-like phylogenies,
which are theoretically indicative of population expansions [37]. For both of these clades, this pattern was supported by the R2 and Fs statistics, the mismatch
distributions of haplotypes and Bayesian skyline plots.
Especially in clade S, certain haplotypes (S15, S3, S33 and
S17) potentially represent nodes indicative of multiple
bursts of population expansion.

The phylogenetic analyses showed no geographically
associated structure within clade S or P. However, nested
clade analysis [63] of the statistical parsimony networks

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/209

showed subtle differentiation that delineated the details
of possible historical dispersal routes. The nested cladograms for clade S showed four different second level nested
clades (Figure 1b). The most ancestral haplotype, S15,
showed a distribution almost exclusively restricted to the
Balkans (Figure 1a). The central haplotype (S3) of the
(light blue) nested clade 2.3, budding off from the ancestral nested clade 2.1 suggested a founder event from the
Balkans to the Mediterranean coast and a subsequent
range expansion of the (red) nested clade 2.4 along that
coast. The (green) nested clade 2.2, which also derived out
of the nested clade 2.1, showed a distribution predominantly restricted to the Black Sea coast, suggesting another
migration route parallel to that coast. These results show
the restriction of the most ancestral haplotype to the Balkans, followed by expansion and differentiation of different nested clades along the Black Sea and the
Mediterranean coasts. This kind of post-glacial coastal
expansion has been documented in relatively few taxa,
with classical cases including human expansions such as
colonization of eastern China [64] and western North
America [65].
Using a Bayesian skyline plot approach, the timing of the
onset of expansion of the entire clades S and P were found
to be around 15,500 years ago and 4,500 years ago,
respectively. These limits roughly correspond to the onset
of deglaciation of continental ice sheets, after the last
Heinrich event, around 15,000 years BP [66], and the stabilization of climate in the Holocene about 4,000 years
BP to near today's temperature [7]. This suggests that the
final range expansions of clades S and P occurred after the
end of Pleistocene, in a time range when the climate
started to get warmer. The initiation of the expansion of
these clades corresponding to post-Pleistocene is supported by evidence from other species, which show similar post Pleistocene modes of population expansion [7].
This type of distribution is expected from a founder event
matching a leptokurtic model of migration (with a greater
number of long distance migrants) where the populations
behind the initial migration front do not advance as readily [15,67]. NCA confirmed this with an explanation of
contiguous and long-range expansion along the Black Sea
and Mediterranean coasts respectively. This expansion
pattern is also similar to that represented by the "grasshopper paradigm" where central and western Europe have
been colonized from a Balkans' refuge, when the Iberian
and Italian refugial populations were slowed down in the
Pyrenees and the Alps [14]. However, in this case, rather
than by another refugial population, the expansion of the
most ancestral haplotypes seems to have been blocked by
the founder population that had colonized the uninhabited regions.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:209

Using the Bayesian skyline approach for the nested clades,
the onset of expansion for nested clades 2.2 and 2.3 were
calculated to have started approximately at 4,000 and
6,000 years ago, respectively. Assuming that S15 was in
the Balkans when the other clades started to expand, these
results imply that this single haplotype has been restricted
to the Balkans for at least 6,000 years. This roughly corresponds to 1000 generations, assuming an average generation time of six years for M. schreibersii (DEH, Australia).
The Balkans has been proposed to be a glacial refugium
for many taxa [15], including bats [55]. Subsequent
migrations of the other nested clades from the Balkans
also seemed to follow geographic regions, such as the
Black Sea and the Mediterranean with slightly different
vegetation types and climate, and again suggest regional
and climatic associations following migration events. This
represents a form of extensive and long-term restriction of
haplotypes and lineages to specific areas, and indicates
that individuals belonging to the same matrilines have
inhabited their respective geographic regions (Balkans,
Black Sea coast, Mediterranean coast and inland) for hundreds of generations. Adaptations to local geographic conditions and climatic regimes can confer advantages to
individuals, in terms of habituation to distribution and
availability of roosts and resources [68], increased reproductive success, survival rate, reproductive output and
recruitment [69]. The results of this study suggest that
these adaptations and preferences might be conserved
over hundreds of generations, affecting the intraspecific
microevolution of a species and the distribution of its
resulting diversity.

Conclusion
Through combined analyses of the effects of various factors to the genetic differentiation of M. schreibersii, we
were able to outline some of the details of the evolutionary history of this species in southeastern Europe and Anatolia. There was no evidence available that supported
topographic barriers as determinants of genetic differentiation in this species. The results indicated mitochondrial
genetic differentiation in glacial refugia, and subsequent
range expansions coupled with various types of regional
climate patterns. There was also evidence for long-term
restriction of matrilines to these climatic regions, for hundreds of generations. Consequently, we were able to show
how multiple biotic and abiotic events including glacial
periods, climatic associations and historical dispersal patterns complemented each other in causing regional and
local differentiation within a species. The next step along
the lines of this research should include sampling in the
winter, to see whether the observed genetic structure is
maintained in the hibernation colonies or not.
