Introduction
The first Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference was held
in 2003 in Adelaide, Australia, and has been an annual
event ever since. While the locations of the previous
conferences have been in the Pacific Rim, this is the first
time that APBC is being held in South Asia. India is not
just an emerging economy but also a burgeoning center
for biotechnology and related sciences.
This ISCB affiliated event was well publicized through
the web, various related mailing lists and carefully
targeted poster displays. We received a healthy number
of submissions from 31 countries: Netherlands, Denmark, Chile, Sweden, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Portugal,
Philippines, Malaysia, France, Ireland, Iran, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, Norway, Israel, United
Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, Australia, Singapore,
Japan, Republic of Korea, Germany, Bangladesh,
Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United States and
India. We are happy to observe that the participation
covers all continents, with the exception of Africa. While
the list here has been compiled using the location of the
affiliated institutes, we are certain that the authors
themselves represent a wider geography than this.
We received 231 submissions, about forty percent more
than we expected (and surpassing each of the numbers in
the previous editions of APBC). We have deliberately used a
very flexible definition of “bioinformatics”, as it is a
continually evolving field, to define the scope of the

conference. The diverse composition of the program
committee (see Additional file 1) was well equipped to
handle the challenge of the broad spectrum of topics
covered under the large, versatile umbrella of bioinformatics and computational biology. This is reflected in the
following categorization of the subject matter: (1) Patterns
and Motifs, (2) Gene Regulation, (3) Interactomics,
(4) Functional Genomics, (5) Genomics & Metagenomics,
(6) Proteomics, (7) Disease Studies, (8) Association
Studies, (9) Comparative Genomics, (10) Structural
Genomics and (11) Phylogeny.
The program committee, working in all time-zones, did
an excellent job, burning the midnight oil when required.
We targeted about three independent reviews for each of
the submissions. We received four reviews for 1 paper,
two reviews for 49 papers and three reviews for each of the
remaining. None of the papers with two reviews were
close-calls. At the end of the day, we made the difficult
decision of selecting 67 papers for oral presentation at the
conference and publication in BMC Bioinformatics. We
are cognizant of the fact that due to the typical constraints
of a conference setting many worthy submissions did not
make it to this short list. Judging by the diversity of the
topics as well as the reviews, we have decided deliberately
not to indulge in ‘best paper’ assignments. We are very
grateful to the program committee members who
invested a significant amount of time and energy, in
spite of their busy schedules, to carry out their tasks in an
objective and timely manner.
