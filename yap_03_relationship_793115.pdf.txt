Abstract
Background: The exact origin of the cause of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is
still an open question. The genomic sequence relationship of SARS-CoV with 30 different singlestranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses of various families was studied using two non-standard approaches.
Both approaches began with the vectorial profiling of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern V for each
virus. In approach one, a distance measure of a vector V, based on correlation coefficient was
devised to construct a relationship tree by the neighbor-joining algorithm. In approach two, a
multivariate factor analysis was performed to derive the embedded tetra-nucleotide usage patterns.
These patterns were subsequently used to classify the selected viruses.
Results: Both approaches yielded relationship outcomes that are consistent with the known virus
classification. They also indicated that the genome of RNA viruses from the same family conform
to a specific pattern of word usage. Based on the correlation of the overall tetra-nucleotide usage
patterns, the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGV) and the Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV) are
closest to SARS-CoV. Surprisingly also, the RNA viruses that do not go through a DNA stage
displayed a remarkable discrimination against the CpG and UpA di-nucleotide (z = -77.31, -52.48
respectively) and selection for UpG and CpA (z = 65.79,49.99 respectively). Potential factors
influencing these biases are discussed.
Conclusion: The study of genomic word usage is a powerful method to classify RNA viruses. The
congruence of the relationship outcomes with the known classification indicates that there exist
phylogenetic signals in the tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, that is most prominent in the replicase
open reading frames.

Background
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a newly identified infectious disease, has imperilled the health of
human population in more than 30 nations. It has
claimed over 812 lives and infected more than 8442

(9.61% death rate) by July 2, 2003 [1] since its outbreak
in November 2002 in the province of GuangDong, People's Republic of China. By May 15, 2003, the primary etiological agent for SARS was found to fulfil Koch's
postulate through experimental infection of cynomolgus

macaques (Macaca fascicularis) [2]. Chronicles for the discovery of SARS CoronaVirus (SARS-CoV) can be found in
articles [e.g. [3,4]] and websites [e.g. [5]].
A common question is often asked when investigating
viral evolution: what hallmark, in term of genome
sequence or RNA word usage, could be used to trace back
the emergence of a new pathogen in humans/animals? In
particular, CoronaViruses are prone to recombination
[6,7] and like all other viruses they mutate at a high frequency [8]. This makes extremely hazardous to try to trace
the origin of the virus. Nevertheless, this prompted us to
investigate their relationships using the RNA word usage
hoping to identify some RNA viruses that display similar
word usage pattern. Such RNA viruses might hint about
the origin of SARS-CoV. This study will contribute to our
understanding of the RNA word usage of SARS-CoV and
some other pathogenic RNA viruses. In the present study,
we explored the relationships of 31 RNA viruses, which
are known to cause diseases to their corresponding hosts
with either similar symptoms or infectiousness, including
SARS-CoV, based on their global tetra-nucleotide usage
pattern.
Preliminary analysis of the sequence data indicated that
there are 11–14 open reading frames in the SARS-CoV
genome [9–11]. The overall gene order for this novel
pathogen supported its placement in the family of Coronaviridae which includes the animal/human CoronaViruses. It should be emphasized that the sequence
similarity shown is attributed mainly to the large RNAdependent RNA polymerase (replication enzyme or
RdRp) residing in the first two open reading frames
(ORFs). These two ORFs constitute more than 65% (>20
kb) of the total genome size and these regions are more
conserved in their nucleotide sequences due to their specialized role for viral RNA replication. Therefore, the possible relationship based on the sequence of the replication
enzyme alone was also investigated.

Results and Discussion
Mono-nucleotide bias
Table 1 presents the breakdown of the RNA sequence into
mononucleotide frequencies for the 31 viral genomes in
our dataset. Except for the Rabbit Hemorrhagic disease
Virus (RHV) that shows a fair usage of the four nucleotides
in approximately equal number, the other RNA viruses
have a biased genome composition. Bovine CoronaVirus
(BCoV) and Human CoronaVirus 229E (HCoV) favor the
U nucleotide (35.5% and 34.6%) at the expense of the C
nucleotide (15.3% and 16.7%). Relatively strong nucleotide biases are visible in the other genomes and we will
mention a few of the extremes. The highest base count is
28.4% G in the Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), 38.9% A in the
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), 35.5% U in the Bovine

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/43

CoronaVirus (BCoV) and 28.5% C count in the Foot-andMouth disease Virus (FMV). The lowest base counts are
15.8% G in the Human Respiratory syncytial Virus (HRV),
21.2% A in the Equine arteritis Virus (EV1), 20.9% U in
the Igbo Ora Virus (IOV) and 13.6% C in the Bovine
ephemeral Fever Virus (BFV). The A nucleotide is the most
popular base among RNA viruses (ranging from 21.2% to
38.9%), and C is the most variable nucleotide (ranging
from 13.6% to 33.1%).
From the standpoint of the overall genomic composition
analysis, the G+C content is an interesting property for a
genome, in that the overall content often correlates with
the organism pathogenicity [12]. Most of the pathogens
genomes have a low G+C content, while some such as
Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a relatively high G+C content. Therefore, as expected in Table 1, we noted that most
of the pathogenic viruses are A+U-rich (>50%), except for
Porcine reproductive and Respiratory syndrome Virus
(PRV), Equine arteritis virus (EV1), Rabbit hemorrhagic
disease virus (RHV), Simian hemorrhagic Fever Virus
(SFV) and Foot-and-Mouth disease Virus C (FMV).
Di-nucleotide bias
The frequencies of occurrence for di-nucleotides were
compared to the random RNA counterparts having the
same base proportion in order to compute the z value that
reflected their di-nucleotide bias (Table 2). Among the 31
virus sequences examined, the frequencies of occurrence
for di-nucleotide were not randomly distributed, with
only a few exceptional di-nucleotides starting with a
purine residue present at the expected frequencies (ApC,
ApG, GpC, |z| < 3). A remarkable deviation from the
expected frequencies occurs for the di-nucleotide pairs
CpG and UpA (suppression or under-representation, z < 50) as well as di-nucleotides pairs CpA and UpG
(enhancement or over-representation, z > 40). These dinucleotide biases, together with mono-nucleotide bias
[13], have a direct impact on the codon usage of viruses.
For example, in the codon usage for the 24 protein coding
sequences in human CoronaVirus 229E (Table 3), only
2.85% of codons contain the under-represented subword
CpG di-nucleotide whereas 11.26% of the codons contain
the over-represented CpA di-nucleotide (the aggregate
codon usage containing each di-nucleotide subword without mono- and di-nucleotide bias is close to 6.25%).

In double stranded DNA genomes the deficiency in dinucleotide CpG is often supposed to be due to the fact
that they are the targets for methyltransferase activity that
leads to cytosine deamination [14,15]. It is however
unlikely that the mechanism of deamination that alters
the genetic contents at the DNA level would affect the viral
RNA content of most RNA viruses without a DNA stage.
There might exist specific cytosine RNA methylases that

could be responsible for this effect [16]. However it is
more consistent to propose that, unlike the mechanism of
cytosine deamination in the DNA realm, the dominating
process is cytosine deamination in RNA viruses, converting cytosine to uracil (C ♦ U) instead of thymine (T). As a
consequence of this mechanism, di-nucleotide CpG
changes to either di-nucleotide UpG or CpA in the direct/
complementary strands of RNA viruses and causes the
over-representation in di-nucleotide UpG and CpA (z >

19). Interestingly, there is experimental evidence in vitro
that the rate of cytosine deamination is faster (>100
times) in the single stranded than in double-stranded
state [17]. Apart from the under-representation in dinucleotide CpG and over-representation in di-nucleotide
CpA and UpG, the reason for the observed di-nucleotide
UpA scarcity in RNA may be explained by its chemical
lability [18]. The UpA dinucleotide is chemically the most
unstable among the 16 dinucleotides. Furthermore, UpA

The di-nucleotide bias in six RNA viruses. The z value quantifies the di-nucleotide bias as defined in equation 1. N (w) and E (w) are actual and
expected frequency of occurrence for word w. The last column is the average z value across 31 RNA viruses.

appears to be a preferential target for ribonucleases [19].
This lability would create a selection pressure against dinucleotide UpA in RNA viruses.
If we choose a critical value for z (|z| = 3.29) that only
allows a chance of 1 in 1000 error for classifying a word as
biased (over/under-represented), all di-nucleotides show
some kind of bias in their usage pattern across 31 different
viruses (Table 4, derived from the complete form of Table
2 provided as the additional file 1). The causes for these
biases await further investigation.
Tetra-nucleotide bias
Inspection of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern for RNA
viruses (additional file 2) reveals considerable differences.
The frequencies of occurrence for tetra-nucleotides were
compared to artificial chromosomes constructed as random RNA sequences having the same nucleotide succession up to order three to compute the z values that reflect
their tetra-nucleotide bias in the corresponding virus
(Table 5). If we choose a critical value for z (|z| = 3.29)
that only allows a chance of 1 in 1000 error for classifying
a word as over/under-represented, 96% of the tetra-nucleotides show a strong bias in their usage pattern across 31
viruses (shown in Table 4, derived from the complete
form of Table 5 provided as the additional file 1). This
indicated strongly that tetra-nucleotides are being used in
a different manner between different viruses, providing us
with a tool to study the relationships between viruses
based on the tetra-nucleotide bias exhibited in their
genomes.

Approach one – Sequence Relationship of Viruses based on
The Correlation of Tetra-nucleotide Bias
Two relationship trees were derived, one from the entire
genome and the other from the replication enzyme
(Figure 1). The result based on the replication enzyme
sequence was included because these regions in RNA
viruses are submitted to a strong selective pressure to
ensure successful replication of their own RNA in the host
cell. The two distance trees can be clustered distinctly into
two major groups of viruses. Interestingly, this clustering
validates our approach, since these clusters are consistent
with biological properties of the viruses: Group #1 corresponds to all positive strand ssRNA viruses while Group
#2 corresponds to negative strand ssRNA viruses. Each
group must undergo different evolutionary paths which
lead to their distinct pattern in tetra-nucleotide usage. The

to the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGV) and
Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV). This placement is consistent
with the findings from two seminal papers [9,10] where
the SARS-CoV was classified in a separate group from the
rest of the known CoronaViruses. In addition, both distance trees suggested that the Bovine CoronaVirus (BCoV)
and the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) should be grouped
together whereas the Human CoronaVirus 229E (HCoV)
is the closest to the Porcine epidemic Diarrhea Virus
(PDV). For the family of negative strand ssRNA viruses,
there are two obvious classes that have evolved through
different branches of word usage pattern. The first class
covers Hantaan Virus (HV1), Reston Ebola Virus (REV),
Bovine Ephemeral Fever Virus (BFV), Bovine Respiratory
syncytial Virus (BRV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
and Human Respiratory syncytial Virus (HRV). The second class covers the remaining negative strand ssRNA
viruses.
Approach two – Sequence Relationship of Viruses based on
The Factors of the Tetra-nucleotide Usage Pattern [21–23]
The overall tetra-nucleotide usage pattern (additional file
2) was decomposed into several eigen-vectors using a factor analysis algorithm. They are the uncorrelated components of the original usage pattern embedded within the
overall tetra-nucleotide usage pattern. Three eigen-vectors,
which carry 83.3% of the variance for the viral tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, were retained (Figure 2). From the
three dimensional figures (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and
Figure 6) plotted against these retained eigen-vectors, the
negative strand ssRNA viruses stemmed clearly out from
the positive strand ssRNA viruses. This is most obvious
when the axes of projection were the 1st and 3rd eigen-vectors. This indicated that both types of viruses have a complex component of tetra-nucleotide usage patterns and

In the result based on replication enzyme sequence (Figure 3 and Figure 4), we observed a clear splitting between
two main families of RNA viruses (positive/negative
strand ssRNA virus). All viruses that belong to a specific
family were clustered together closely. This pointed to an
interesting hypothesis that the replication enzyme
sequence between closely related RNA viruses adopt a
common word usage pattern that are closely linked. In
addition, it is clear that the viruses from different family
groups adopt different strategy of word usage.
However in Figure 5 and Figure 6, when we project the
tetra-nucleotide usage patterns (entire genome) for each
virus on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd eigen-vector axes, the separation between viruses showed a different outcome when V
was derived from the entire genome. The two main families of viruses were grouped into three clusters, two being
allocated to the positive strand ssRNA viruses. It is particularly interesting that all viruses in the upper left corner
corresponded to the viruses originating from the CoronaVirus family. Unexpectedly, the Hantaan Virus (HV1) is
the only negative strand ssRNA virus to have a high loading on the eigen-vector that corresponded to the tetranucleotide usage pattern for the positive strand ssRNA
viruses.
It is important to realize what factor analysis will provide
and how this analysis is different from the previous
method of relationship tree generation using correlation
coefficient. For the previous method that is based on correlation coefficient of word usage patterns, it treats the
vectorial profiling V for each virus as a whole entity, However, the factor analysis considered the vectorial profiling
V as a superposition of many patterns which can be separated into mutually uncorrelated patterns of word usage.
Each eigen-vector represents the embedded component of
RNA word usage patterns communalised by a group of
viruses presumably under the same selection pressures. By
projecting the overall usage patterns on these eigen-vectors, it is possible to determine a group of viruses that
adopt a common strategy of word usage.

Conclusion
Using the two approaches to study the tetra-nucleotide
usage pattern in RNA viruses, we reached the following
conclusions:
1. Based on the correlation of the overall tetra-nucleotide
usage patterns, the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus
(TGV) and the Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV) are closest to
SARS-CoV.

regions of the plot.

2. Based on the three most significant eigen-vectors, the
genomes of the viruses from the same family conform to
a similar tetra-nucleotide usage pattern, irrespective of
their genome size.
3. The study of word usage is a powerful method to classify RNA viruses. The congruence of the relationship trees
with the known classification indicates that there exist
phylogenetic signals in tetra-nucleotide usage patterns,
and this signal is most prominent in the replicase open
reading frames.

Methods
Dataset
We focused our study on the genomic sequences (their
translated strand) of ssRNA viruses (Table 1), which
incorporated 20 species from the family of positive strand
ssRNA viruses and 11 species from the family of negative
strand ssRNA viruses. We are aware of the fact that these
viruses constitute completely different species, most probably unrelated to one another. They are included in a
common study in order to try to have means to identify
relevant features from purely statistical background properties. The coverage included the viruses that are known to
cause diseases to their corresponding hosts. The acronym
for each virus is shown in the table and is referred to
throughout this study. All sequences corresponding to

Method for counting the frequency of occurrence for RNA
words
It is necessary to address the question of how we counted
the number of time each tetra-nucleotide (for example
'GAGA' or any other tetra-nucleotide), appeared in a given
genome. For this study, we adopted the convention of not
counting overlapping words [24]. Take a sequence "UAUGAGAGAUCCGAGA' as example. With second or higher
overlapping words not counted, the tetra-nucleotide
'GAGA' is counted as occurring only twice, namely in

position 4–7 and 13–16. Positions 6–9 are omitted
because they overlap with 'GAGA' at position 4–7.
However, when we counted tetra-nucleotide 'UGAG',
position 3–6 would also be registered as position 4–6
already recorded when counting tetra-nucleotide 'GAGA'.
In short, all frequency counting of tetra-nucleotide were
started anew when we changed from counting the frequency of one tetra-nucleotide to another; this was to preserve the correlation of tetra-nucleotides which have
overlapping subword (e.g: 'UAGA' and 'GACA'). A table
showing the frequencies of tetra-nucleotides is shown in
the additional file 2.

Because most viral genomes are short, and because we
lack a prior information on the tempo and modes of evolution of RNA viruses, we proceeded as follows. We created a vector, V = [C1,C2, ... Ci, ... Ck], with each element
representing the frequency for a specific RNA word of
length n. The number of components (k) in V increases
exponentially with word size (n) - k = 4n. In order to use V
for discrimination between viruses, two criteria must be
met. First, V must contain sufficient components (di-

nucleotide k = 16; tri-nucleotide k = 64; tetra-nucleotide k
= 256); second, the frequencies for tetra-nucleotides must
show a prominent bias (over/under-representation) that
is unique for a family of viruses.
For the first criteria, there are pros and cons for choosing
either longer or shorter words. When the shorter words
are used, they inherit the problem of inadequate representation of the viral genome because the long motifs will be

neglected. But the shorter words have an advantage of saving computational time. On the other hand, when the
longer words are used, they cause a problem of computer
tractability due to a larger word set to explore (k = 4n).
However, the larger words have an advantage of accounting for the correlation of their sub-words. In contrast the
number of their occurrences falls down rapidly, preventing accurate statistical analysis. We chose tetra-nucleotides for our study because they provide 256 vector
components (additional file 2) and account for correlation of sub-words up to the order three.
For the second criteria, the bias in RNA word usage was
examined. The bias in word usage (of size n) is influenced
by the bias of word with sizes less than n [26]. Therefore,
in order to evaluate the true bias of word size m, it is
required to compare the frequencies of word usage in the
original sequence to that of model chromosomes that take
into account the biases of word size m - 1, m - 2 ... 1. These
model chromosomes were generated by obeying the
Markov model of the order (m - 1)th. This can be achieved

by shuffling m - 1 viral nucleotides as one whole unit so
that the nucleotide successions up to order (m - 1)th were
being preserved. Several statistical approaches have been
proposed for quantifying word biases [27,28]. In this
study, we employed the z statistics (Equation 1) for dinucleotide and tetra-nucleotide biases [27,28]. The z value
is a measure of the bias of a word, with values close to zero
meaning no bias, negative values meaning under-representation and positive values meaning over-representation of the word w in the RNA text.

zw =

N(w) − E(w)
Var(w)

(1)

where w is a word of size m; N(w) is observed count in
actual viral RNA; E(w) and Var(w) are expected count and
variance for w derived from the 100 artificial chromosomes that preserved the nucleotide succession up to
order m - 1.

Approach one – sequence relationship of viruses based on
the correlation of tetra-nucleotide bias
A scale-invariant parameter, the correlation coefficient r,
was employed to compare between word usage patterns of
viruses. The correlation coefficient r measures the degree
of linear relationship between two vectors. Here, the two
vectors are the tetra-nucleotide word usage pattern V corresponding to each viral genome. The magnitude of r
would indicate how much of the change of pattern in the
tetra-nucleotide word usage in one virus is explained by
the change in another. The magnitude of r is always
between -1 and +1 and the relationship between the two
variables will approach perfect linearity as the magnitude
of correlation coefficient approaches to extreme values (+/
-1). However, perfect positive correlation (r = 1) does not
mean identity of the paired Vi, but, rather, identity up to
positive linearity, that is, identity between the paired
standardized values. This is a crucial property of r (scaleinvariant) that enables the comparison of viral genome
despite their differences in genomic sizes. Positive magnitude of r indicates positive association whereas negative
magnitude of r indicates negative association between two
usage patterns. For this study, correlation coefficient, r, for
let say virus 1 and virus 2, is defined as follow:
256

r12 =

∑ (V1i − V1)(V2i − V2 )
i =1

(n − 1)SV1SV 2

gular matrix of M, the neighbor-joining method (NJ)
algorithm was used to construct the relationship tree (Figure 1). The neighbor-joining method is based on minimum-distance principle. Details of the NJ algorithm are
available in [29].
Approach two – sequence relationship of viruses based on
the factors of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern
The factor analysis is a statistical method that reveals simpler patterns within a complex set of tetra-nucleotide
usage patterns V (additional file 2). It seeks to discover if
the observed usage patterns can be explained in terms of a
much smaller number of un-correlated pattern sets called
factors (eigen-vectors). Suppose we take a simple case
where there are 31 viruses each represented by two components (x,y) in vector V (x,y represent the frequencies of
occurrence for two specific tetra-nucleotides). Then, in a
scatter-plot we can think of the regression line as the original X-axis, rotated so that it approximates the regression
line. This type of rotation maximize the variance of the
variables (x,y) on the eigen-vector. The remaining variability around this the first eigen-vector was captured in the
subsequent eigen-vectors. In this manner, consecutive
eigen-vectors are extracted but with a diminishing importance. What each eigen-vector represents is the embedded
RNA word usage patterns communalised by a group of
viruses presumably under the same selection pressures.

We implemented the factor analysis algorithm [21–23] in
Matlab Technical Programming Language and computed
a set of eigen-vectors. Then, the original usage pattern V
was re-mapped for each virus onto the new coordinate
system based on these derived eigen-vectors. The difference between approach two and approach one is discussed in the results and discussion section.

Then, the distance between the tetra-nucleotide usage patterns of two viruses is defined as follows:

Prior to the construction of a relationship tree, the pairwise distance matrix M of size 31 by 31 was constructed
(see additional file 3). Pair-wise distance between two
viral genomes is measured by the value of (1 - r). Each
row/column corresponds to a specific virus and an entry
at the intersection of row X and column Y corresponds to
the distance between virus X and virus Y. Such matrix has
a diagonal entry of value 0. For the purpose of constructing a relationship tree, only the lower/upper triangular
matrix of M is required. After obtaining lower/upper trian-
