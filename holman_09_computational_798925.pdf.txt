Abstract
Background: Wolbachia (wBm) is an obligate endosymbiotic bacterium of Brugia malayi, a parasitic
filarial nematode of humans and one of the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis. There is a
pressing need for new drugs against filarial parasites, such as B. malayi. As wBm is required for B.
malayi development and fertility, targeting wBm is a promising approach. However, the lifecycle of
neither B. malayi nor wBm can be maintained in vitro. To facilitate selection of potential drug targets
we computationally ranked the wBm genome based on confidence that a particular gene is essential
for the survival of the bacterium.
Results: wBm protein sequences were aligned using BLAST to the Database of Essential Genes
(DEG) version 5.2, a collection of 5,260 experimentally identified essential genes in 15 bacterial
strains. A confidence score, the Multiple Hit Score (MHS), was developed to predict each wBm
gene's essentiality based on the top alignments to essential genes in each bacterial strain. This
method was validated using a jackknife methodology to test the ability to recover known essential
genes in a control genome. A second estimation of essentiality, the Gene Conservation Score
(GCS), was calculated on the basis of phyletic conservation of genes across Wolbachia's parent
order Rickettsiales. Clusters of orthologous genes were predicted within the 27 currently available
complete genomes. Druggability of wBm proteins was predicted by alignment to a database of
protein targets of known compounds.
Conclusion: Ranking wBm genes by either MHS or GCS predicts and prioritizes potentially
essential genes. Comparison of the MHS to GCS produces quadrants representing four types of
predictions: those with high confidence of essentiality by both methods (245 genes), those highly
conserved across Rickettsiales (299 genes), those similar to distant essential genes (8 genes), and
those with low confidence of essentiality (253 genes). These data facilitate selection of wBm genes
for entry into drug design pipelines.

Background
Exponential growth in the amount of available genomic
information has produced unprecedented opportunities
to computationally predict functional genomics in biologically intractable organisms. One application of these
data is facilitation of the rational drug design process.
Most high throughput drug discovery techniques screen
compounds for biological activity, only determining target and mechanism post hoc. An alternative approach,
rational drug design, seeks to utilize genomic information
to specifically identify and inhibit targets. Often these
methods utilize in silico sequence analysis to choose a target protein that is important to the survival of the organism and accessible to small molecule drugs. It has been
suggested that ideally a target should fulfill four properties: 1--Essentiality to the survival or pathogenesis of the
target organism, 2--Druggability, having protein structure
characteristics making it amenable to binding small molecule inhibitors, 3--Functional and structural characterization with established assays for screening small molecule
inhibition, 4--Distinctness from current drug targets to
avoid resistance [1].
These parameters are not strict rules, however. In reality,
few if any pathogenic organisms have sufficiently comprehensive functional genomics information to rigorously
screen based on these parameters. A large portion of the
target discovery process involves weighing compromises
in the selection parameters based on the quality of information available. In silico drug target prediction relies on
various approximations and comparisons to identify
genes which fit these parameters. Arguably, the most
important parameter to assess is gene essentiality. For a
compound to serve as an effective antimicrobial or
anthelmintic, binding of its target gene product should
kill, or at least severely attenuate the growth of the targeted organism. Knock-out and knock-down studies have
been used to assess gene essentiality in a number of
diverse model and disease organisms. Recently, many of
these studies have been assembled into collection databases [2,3] allowing analyses that examine patterns of
essential genes across multiple organisms [4]. In organisms in which a genome wide essentiality survey has not
been completed, additional approaches have been used to
predict essential genes. If gene essentiality has been determined in a closely related model organism, orthology
between genes can predict shared essentiality [5-10].
Alternatively, systems biology approaches examine the
global enzymatic and metabolic requirements of the
organism. Among these are studies which define a minimal genome for a generic bacterial organism [11-13], or
model the total metabolic interactions of the cell [14,15].
For organisms with no functional genomics information
in nearby species, methods based purely on gene
sequence are being developed, though these provide

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/243

lower accuracy than functional comparisons [16,17].
Among the purely sequence based methods, gene conservation across taxa is the strongest indicator of gene essentiality [11,16,18,19]. Genes whose protein sequences
have been tightly conserved across lineages are assumed
to be more likely to be important to the survival of the
organism [20]. Each of the essential gene prediction methods described above requires different levels of a priori
information about the target organism or closely related
organisms. As the amount of functional genomics information available decreases, predicting essential genes and
drug targets becomes a significantly more difficult task.
Here we present the results of our analysis of one such
organism having no such functional data, the Wolbachia
endosymbiont of Brugia malayi, (wBm).
B. malayi is a parasitic filarial nematode of humans which,
along with Wuchereria bancrofti and Onchocerca volvulus,
are the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis and
onchocerciasis, more commonly known as elephantiasis
and river blindness, respectively. Together, filarial parasites infect approximately 150 million people worldwide
with 1.5 billion at risk of infection [21]. Current treatments utilize diethylcarbamazine, benzimidazoles (e.g.,
albendazole) and avermectins (e.g., ivermectin), however,
these treatments are predominately only effective during
the larval stages of the parasite [22]. Because the life-span
of the adult worm is up to 15 years, long treatment courses
are required to effectively eliminate the infection. Additionally, the emergence of drug resistance is becoming
increasingly apparent [23,24]. The α-proteobacterium
Wolbachia is an obligate endosymbiont of most filarial
nematodes, and in several, including B. malayi, is required
for worm viability. Clearance of the Wolbachia by antibiotics results in worm growth retardation, infertility and
killing, while antibiotic treatment of non-Wolbachia carrying nematode species has no effect [25,26]. This makes
Wolbachia an attractive target for control of filarial parasites.
Neither Wolbachia nor B. malayi have a life-cycle that can
be maintained in vitro. Because of this, traditional drug
discovery by high throughput compound screening is not
feasible, nor are the basic gene essentiality experiments
which are informative to rational drug design. The
genomes of both B. malayi and wBm have been sequenced
[27,28]; however, only B. malayi has a closely related, well
characterized model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. Previous work has used C. elegans functional genomics data
to predict drug targets in B. malayi [9]. Wolbachia, however, has no close relatives in which functional genomics
data is available.
Functional genomics information from a large number of
more distantly related bacteria can be used to infer similar

information in an intractable species [29,30]. Here we
present such an approach, utilizing bioinformatic techniques to rank the likelihood of gene essentiality across
the wBm genome, for the purpose of facilitating the selection of potential new drug targets. A combination of
approaches were used to predict genes likely to be important to the survival of wBm. First, we used comparative
sequence analysis to identify wBm genes with strong protein sequence similarity to experimentally identified
essential genes in more distantly related bacteria. Second,
in order to identify genes important to the biological
niche inhabited by wBm, gene conservation across its parent order, Rickettsiales was evaluated. The first approach
identifies genes broadly important across bacterial life.
The second approach reinforces the genes identified by
the first, while additionally identifying genes likely to
have importance specifically within Rickettsiales. Consideration of these properties during drug target selection can
optimize for development of either a more broad spectrum antibiotic, or a more targeted compound, reducing
the side effects related to clearing of the natural biotic
flora.

Results
Predicting essential genes in wBm by protein sequence
comparison to essential genes in distantly related bacteria
While wBm is not amenable to experimental gene essentiality analysis, knockout and knockdown studies in multiple other bacterial species can serve as a proxy. The results
of a number of these analyses are compiled in a publicly
available resource called the Database of Essential Genes
(DEG). This database contains 5,260 genes from 15 different bacterial strains [3] (Table 1). In most cases, the genes
within DEG were identified by large scale knock-out or
knock-down screens performed under rich media conditions. Rich media conditions are thought to approximate

the growth environment of intracellular bacteria [16].
This makes the collection of genes within DEG a useful
model for the gene requirements of wBm. DEG contains a
binary description of gene essentiality. Genes included in
DEG are considered essential to the organism, while genes
omitted are considered dispensable, within the specific
conditions of the experiments used. In order to computationally predict essential genes, we used BLAST to compare the protein sequences of all protein-coding wBm
genes to the genes contained within DEG. The most
straightforward method to evaluate the results from the
BLAST analysis is to examine the e-value of the best BLAST
hit between a wBm gene and DEG. However, because
DEG consists of information on essential genes in multiple bacterial organisms, we wished to evaluate the BLAST
results in a manner which accounts for the statistical significance of hits to multiple DEG organisms. A wBm gene
with a significant BLAST hit to an essential gene in a single
DEG organism represents a quite different result than a
wBm gene with significant BLAST hits to essential genes in
multiple DEG organisms. While a single alignment to a
DEG gene implies similar function and likely shared
essentiality, alignments to DEG genes within multiple
organisms suggests membership in a class of essential
genes conserved across species and increases our confidence in predicting that a given wBm gene is essential. A
ranking metric, termed the multiple-hit score (MHS), was
developed to evaluate the BLAST results in this context.
This metric produced a score for each wBm gene. A gene
with high-scoring BLAST hits to each organism within
DEG received a high MHS score. In its basic form, the
MHS for a wBm gene was calculated by averaging the top
BLAST alignment against each DEG organism divided by
the smallest e-value able to be returned by BLAST, 1 × 10200 in this case. The scale of e-values generated by BLAST
are dependent on the size of the database searched [31].

Distribution of MHS values by rank in wBm. The Xaxis indicates the 805 protein coding genes in the wBm
genome, ranked by MHS. The Y-axis shows the value of the
MHS for each protein.

Preliminary analysis indicated that when searching
against the DEG database, e-values less significant than 1
× 10-25 were predominately partial alignments (data not
shown). To reduce the effect of these lower significance
alignments, which appeared to be domain alignments
instead of full length gene alignments, all e-values were
scaled by their square before averaging. The resulting
score could range between 0 and 1, with 1 being alignments with an e-value of 1 × 10-200 to all organisms within
DEG. Figure 1 is a graph of the MHS scores for the full
wBm genome, ordered by MHS score [see Additional file
1]. This graph reveals several properties of the wBm MHS
distribution. There is a sharp peak containing fewer than
10 genes which have very good alignments to nearly all
DEG organisms. This tapers to a shoulder containing, first,
genes with high quality alignments to several DEG organisms, then later, mostly genes with lower quality alignments to multiple DEG organisms. The distribution of
actual alignments for the top 20 genes is shown in Figure
2. Because the MHS indicates our confidence that a specific gene is essential, the optimal usage of this ranking is
to begin manually examining from the highest ranked
genes, progressing through genes with a lower confidence
of essentiality. Based on the shape of the MHS curve and
examination of the individual alignments, a conservative
MHS threshold of 7.3 × 10-3 was chosen. At this threshold,
we see alignments to 7 of the 15 taxa in DEG with e-values
of 1 × 10-25. This threshold predicts that 250 out of 805
genes have reasonable confidence of essentiality. This
should not, however, be mistaken as a prediction that
two-thirds of the genome is non-essential. As an obligate
endosymbiont of the nematode B. malayi, wBm has
undergone significant genome shrinkage compared to
other bacteria, thus a large percentage of its genome is

expected to be essential [28]. Instead, the MHS result predicts that roughly one-quarter of the wBm genes are
involved in basic bacterial processes important for growth
across a diversity of species. Identification of a supplementary set of genes consisting of genes likely to be
important specifically to members of the order Rickettsiales was accomplished in the second phase of our analysis.
Evaluation and validation of the MHS ranked wBm gene
list
The annotations of the top 20 wBm genes ranked by MHS
can be used to qualitatively assess our ranking metric
(Table 2). Many of the top-20 genes fall into the classes of
genes targeted by current antibiotics and are annotated in
categories likely essential for bacterial growth. The gyrase
and topoisomerase family, targeted by quinolones [32], is

heavily represented. The DNA-directed RNA polymerase
RpoB is the target of rifampin [33], and the tRNA synthetases are targets of several recently developed compounds [34-36]. In addition to qualitatively examining
our ranking method, we wanted to quantitatively assess
its ability to place essential genes at the top of the ranked
list. However, quantitatively validating the ranking of the
wBm genome is stymied by the lack of an effective positive
control set. To address this we developed a jackknifing
methodology which is able to utilize the organisms
within DEG as a positive control set with which to validate the ranking methods. The Refseq sets of predicted
proteins for organisms included in DEG were acquired
from NCBI. Each organism's protein sequences were individually analyzed by comparison to a version of DEG filtered to remove sequences from just that organism, then
ordered by MHS. Because essential genes in these organisms have already been experimentally identified, it is
possible to assess our ranking methods by their ability to
prioritize these genes. In order to quantitate the ranking,
each genome was ordered by highest to lowest prediction
of essentiality and the cumulative sum of the number of
positive control DEG genes was plotted. The area under
the curve (AUC) for the experimental ranking was compared to that of an ideal ranking which artificially placed
all DEG genes at the beginning of the list, and 1000 replicates of a randomized assortment (Figure 3). The shape of
the ideal and sorted curves varies with the percentage of
DEG genes within each organism. The important component to examine is the shape of the experimental sorting
curve compared to the randomized assortment and the
ideal ranking. For each organism a p-value was calculated,

comparing the experimental sorting with the randomly
assorted population. Additionally, the percentage sorting
was calculated by scaling the area under the curve for the
experimental sorting to between 100% for the area under
the curve in the ideal ranking, and 0% for the AUC for the
diagonal line representing random assortment. Qualitatively, for most organisms our methods performed relatively well in recovering DEG genes. In nearly all
organisms the sorted curve appears well differentiated
from the randomized sorting and in some cases begins to
approach the ideal case. For all organisms the experimental sorting was statistically different from random assortment. B. subtilis, S. aureus, and M. pulmonis are examples
of organisms with large, medium and small genomes
which were especially well sorted by MHS, with 74.2%,
73.3% and 67.1% sorting respectively. On the other hand,
H. influenzae and H. pylori and to a lesser extent E. coli performed quite poorly in this validation with 13.7% 12.8%
and 32.5% sorting respectively. Further consideration of
these outliers can be found in the discussion. Overall, the
results from the jackknife analysis indicate that the MHS
based ranking effectively predicts essential genes and prioritizes them within the top of the ranked genome.
Prediction of essential genes in wBm by gene conservation
across the order Rickettsiales
While we are confident in the predictions of gene essentiality by MHS, those predictions only identify genes common to the reference set of bacteria in DEG. As there are
no α-proteobacteria in DEG, genes uniquely essential to
wBm might be missed by MHS analysis. We wished to perform a complementary analysis to predict additional

Essential gene prediction by MHS was validated through a jackknife methodology. For each organism within DEG,
the ability of the MHS to place experimentally validated essential genes at the top of a ranked genome was evaluated. All graphs

genes important specifically to wBm and closely related
organisms. wBm is a highly specialized obligate endosymbiont with a reduced genome [28]. While it seems reasonable that roughly 250 out of 805 wBm genes are essential
across bacteria in general, it is likely that there is an additional set of genes essential specifically for the environmental niche inhabited by wBm. In order to predict this
second set of genes, and reinforce the MHS based essential
gene predictions, we identified genes with highly conserved orthologs across Wolbachia's parent order, Rickettsiales.
There are 27 complete genomes available within Rickettsiales. These include, 4 Wolbachia, including wBm, 3
genomes from the genus Anaplasma, 5 Ehrlichia, 11 Rickettsia, 1 Neorickettsia, 2 Orientia, and 1 Pelagibacter (Table 3).
Of these genomes, all but Pelagibacter are obligate endosymbionts residing either in vacuoles or within the host
cell cytoplasm. Of the endosymbionts, all but Wolbachia
replicate within vertebrate hosts with most transmitted via
an invertebrate vector. Wolbachia, on the other hand
infects a diverse spectrum of arthropod hosts as well as
filarial nematodes, many of which are themselves vertebrate parasites [37].
Refseq protein sequences from the 27 available genomes
(as of April 1, 2009) were retrieved from NCBI. The
OrthoMCL package was used to predict clusters of
orthologs among the genomes [38]. To gauge the extent of
taxonomic diversity within each orthologous gene cluster,
we initially tallied the number of taxa represented in the
cluster. However, this measure inflated the phylogenetic
diversity for groups containing multiple highly related
taxa. To compensate, a minimum spanning tree (MST)
was constructed using distances derived from aligned 16S
rRNA gene sequences as edge weights between taxonomic
nodes. A score for the MST was calculated by summing the
distances between the connected taxonomic nodes. The
MST was used to minimize the contributions from closely
related taxa, while reflecting the overall taxonomic diversity. The MST distances for each cluster were incorporated
into a metric we termed the gene conservation score
(GCS), which represents both the extent of gene conservation across species, as well as the quality of that conservation. The integer portion of the GCS, from 0 to 100, is
derived from the MST distances within an orthologous
gene cluster. The decimal portion of the score represents
the quality of alignments between the wBm gene and the
other cluster members. Thus, within a group of clusters
with the same MST, wBm genes are individually ranked
based on the quality of their BLAST alignment to other
genes within the cluster (see Materials and Methods). The
distribution of GCS scores for the wBm genome is shown
in Figure 4 [see also Additional file 1]. Approximately 300
wBm genes cluster with orthologs in all or nearly all Rick-

ettsia members in the analysis and have a GCS of approximately 100. The next large group consists of 60 wBm
genes that have a GCS of approximately 91 and orthologs
in all members except for Pelagibacter ubique, the only freeliving organism in the group. A third group of 60 genes
has a GCS of approximately 29, and corresponds to clusters lacking orthologs to Orientia and most of the Rickettsia
species. When picking an empirical threshold for prediction of gene essentiality we chose a GCS of 29 or higher,
which includes the three groups described above and contains 544 genes. Though the third group of 60 genes has
lost orthologs to most of the Rickettsia, it retains orthologs
in the Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia and the other
Wolbachiae. As is illustrated by the distribution along the
y-axis of Figure 5, however, there is a large break between
groups with a GCS of 91 and 29, and a more conservative
estimate could place a threshold significantly higher.
From a practical standpoint, however, because the GCS
value represents a prediction of the importance of a specific gene, a more useful approach is to sort the genome by
GCS rather than picking a threshold. Manually assessing
from the top of the ranking allows the identification of
highly conserved genes which can be searched for favorable secondary protein properties; in our case, properties
useful for entry into the rational drug design pipeline.

Examination of the top 20 genes in the wBm genome
ranked by GCS (Table 4) reveals important differences
compared to ranking by MHS (Table 2). Many of the same
genes or classes of genes which were ranked highly by
MHS are also identified by GCS. RNA polymerase RpoB/
C, topoisomerase, gyrase, and several tRNA synthetases all
rank highly by both methods. However, several interesting genes not identified by MHS are placed at the top of
the GCS ranking. For example, pyruvate phosphate dikinase, PPDK, has previously been identified by pathway
analysis as a potential drug target [39]. By MHS, PPDK
was ranked at position 309; GCS ranking placed it at position 3.
Plotting MHS versus GCS demonstrates the identification
of complementary sets of essential genes
The two methods of essential gene prediction used in this
study identified complementary partially overlapping sets
of wBm genes. Identification of a gene by both methods
bolsters confidence in a prediction of essentiality. Genes
uniquely identified by an individual method may represent, for MHS, genes essential to general bacterial processes; and for GCS, genes specifically important to the
Rickettsiales order. To assess the distribution of essentiality
prediction by both methods, the MHS and GCS for each
wBm gene was graphed as a scatter plot (Figure 5). Lines
indicating the empirically determined thresholds for the
prediction of essentiality by each method produce four
quadrants showing the classes of predicted essential
genes. The upper-right quadrant contains 245 genes predicted essential by both methods. The upper-left quadrant
contains 299 genes which are not similar to essential
genes in more distantly related bacteria, but are still highly
conserved across Rickettsiales. These genes represent a

promising class of drug targets which are likely to be more
specific to wBm. That there are only 8 outliers in the
lower-right quadrant demonstrates that most genes which
are predicted to be essential in multiple diverse bacteria
are also highly conserved across Rickettsiales, as expected.
Combined, we predict that 552 of 805 wBm genes-roughly 69%--have a high likelihood of being essential.
The ranked wBm genome as a tool for drug development
Our ranking of the wBm genome by predicted gene essentiality is designed as a tool to facilitate the manual exploration of viable new drug targets against the bacterium.
Order within the list at a resolution of one or two positions is relatively uninformative; nearby rankings represent similar confidence in the prediction of gene
essentiality. However, the quartile or decile in which a
gene is placed strongly influences our confidence in its
essentiality. In addition to predicting essential genes, each
wBm gene can be further annotated to include protein or
functional information useful in drug target prioritization, including similarity to human proteins, hydropathy
predictions, or protein localization predictions. A similar
strategy for prioritizing targets was used for B. malayi [9]
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [40]. One such annotation
we chose to include is the potential for a protein to bind
typical small molecule drugs, termed its druggability.
There exist several purely sequence based methods of predicting druggability based on the identification of
domains favorable to small molecule binding [41,42]. We
also decided to take a more direct approach and identify
wBm proteins with high sequence similarity to the targets
of existing small molecule drugs and compounds. This
allows us to not only identify proteins containing
domains favorably structured to bind small molecules,
but also proteins which are likely to have the localization
and cellular kinetics important for a viable drug target.

We utilized the DrugBank database which is a comprehensive set of nearly 4,800 FDA-approved small molecule
drugs, nutraceuticals and experimental compounds [43].
This database includes chemical, pharmacology, and
mechanistic information for each compound, as well as
protein target and pathway information for a large percentage of the entries. After downloading a local copy of
the database, we used BLAST to align the wBm proteins to
the list of drug targeted proteins from DrugBank, filtering
for e-values more significant than 1 × 10-25. This method
identified 198 wBm proteins highly similar to the binding
partners of FDA approved drugs, experimental small molecule compounds, or nutraceutical compounds. In Figure
5 druggability is indicated by coloring predicted druggable wBm genes red. The prediction of druggability seems
to correlate well with our predictions of potential drug targets by essentiality and gene conservation. In combination with essentiality predictions, the prediction of

high confidence by both metrics. The upper left quadrant contains genes identified only by GCS, while the bottom right quadrant contains genes identified only by MHS. The numbers adjacent to the quadrant lines indicate gene counts in each quadrant.

druggability can be used as a secondary screening criteria
to identify genes for entry into the rational drug design
pipeline.

Discussion
The overall goal of this work is to produce a result that can
facilitate the selection of genes as drug target candidates.
Sorting the full genome by prediction of essentiality then
manually evaluating secondary protein properties
attempts to avoid the issues related to developing a
nuanced automated system capable of filtering down to a
short list of candidate drug targets while still prioritizing
the listing for high quality potential targets.
MHS predicted a slightly smaller number of essential
genes than experimentally found in the individual
genome surveys comprising DEG. In contrast, GCS predicted a slightly larger set (Figure 6). Because most of the

entries within DEG represent genome wide surveys for
essential genes we can compare the number of genes identified by our analysis to the number of essential genes in
each DEG organism. Vibrio cholerae was removed as an
outlier because it consists of 5 genes in DEG and does not
represent a comprehensive genome survey. By MHS our
analysis predicted approximately 250 genes or approximately 30% of the wBm genome as having reasonable
confidence of essentiality. The raw number of predicted
essential genes is lower than that for most of the DEG
organisms, and under the mean for DEG of 392 genes.
Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pulmonis, which
are also intracellular bacteria with genome sizes similar to
wBm, have 381 and 310 genes within DEG, respectively.
The relatively similar number of essential genes identified
across DEG organisms suggests that these data are describing a common set of genes across a shared set of important pathways. It appears that we are able to predict a quite

significant portion of these in wBm through the MHS,
though it does appear that MHS alone may not be identifying the complete set. By GCS we identified 544 wBm
genes as important within Rickettsiales, comprising
approximately 69% of the wBm genome. This is greater
than the Mycoplasmas and most other DEG organisms, but
still less than Haemophilus influenzae (642), M. tuberculosis
(614), or Escherichia coli (712) (Table 1). Overall, it
appears that for prediction of essential genes both MHS
and GCS score are effective. MHS is likely an incomplete
survey. GCS prediction appears to identify a more complete set, encompassing all but 8 of the genes identified by
MHS. However, the additional genes identified by GCS
also probably include a number of genes that, while
important, are not strictly essential. It is possible to overestimate the set of essential genes predicted by GCS as a
result of using closely related organisms. Although we
note that in the case of Rickettsiales, these organisms are in
the process of reducing their genomes, adding significance
to retained genes. Within the goals of this research, predicting essential genes as potential drug targets, our methods provide sufficient sensitivity and specificity as long as
these caveats are recognized.
On the basis of the jackknife validation, MHS performs
poorly on several organisms. M. genitalium represents a
unique case; nearly 80% of its genes are essential. There is
little difference between the AUC for the ideal sorting, the
MHS sorting, and the random assortment. Even so, MHS
produced a 38.8% sorting, with a p-value of 2 × 10-9 compared to random. It is unclear why H. influenzae and H.
pylori and to a lesser extent E. coli performed poorly. This

result suggests that these organisms may contain species
specific essential genes. For H. pylori the authors of the initial essentiality screen note a surprising lack of overlap
with the essential gene sets from other organisms [44]. As
the number of essential genes in H. pylori is in the same
range as most of the other organisms in DEG, this could
suggest an alternative set of essential genes. In the case of
E. coli, we note that the number of essential genes is nearly
double the average for the other DEG organisms, which
likely reflects its status as one of the most well-studied
bacteria. This larger set may confound the E. coli jackknifing validation. Somewhat paradoxically, these features
may be beneficial for this analysis. The outlier organisms
may incorporate more diversity in our reference set of
essential genes, increasing the likelihood of identification
of diverse essential genes within wBm. This does come
with the trade-off of increasing the false positive rate,
however, this is mitigated by two factors. First, the design
of the MHS assigns more confidence to genes conserved
across multiple organisms, moving well supported essential gene predictions towards the top. Second, the pipeline
for the rational drug design process utilizes the predictions of essential wBm genes to inform a manual selection
of drug targets. A moderate false positive rate can be
screened out based on manual analysis and pathway
information. As an additional experiment, it could be
informative to examine non-DEG genes predicted as
essential in the jackknifing validation to identify essential
genes missed by the knockout experiments. A gene conserved nearly universally across DEG but missing in a
small number of organisms may be useful to investigate
under alternative experimental conditions.

Genes identified by MHS are predicted to belong to a set
of genes which are essential and broadly conserved across
bacterial life. This set includes many targets of modern
broad-spectrum antibiotics. A compound targeting genes
from this class is more likely to produce antibiotics effective across a broad range of bacterial species. Though gene
orthology does not specifically indicate drug cross-reactivity, the distribution of the targeted gene should be considered. While developing a novel broad-spectrum antibiotic
would be advantageous, for this specific application such
a compound may also come with negative side-effects.
Ideally, a mass drug administration protocol against B.
malayi would consist of a small number of high-dose antibiotic treatments. In this format, broad-spectrum antibiotics carry the risk of significant side-effects due to
targeting mutualistic bacterial flora.
An alternative approach which attempts to avoid the
issues surrounding broad-spectrum antibiotics is to select
targets from the group of genes identified only by the
GCS. These genes are highly conserved throughout the
order Rickettsiales but have little similarity to essential
genes in other bacteria. While it is quite possible that these
wBm genes have orthologs throughout the bacterial kingdom, the experimental data available in DEG suggests that
they would not be essential for the growth of bacteria in
general. Druggability was predicted by identifying wBm
proteins with sequence similarity to the targets of small
molecule drugs. However, an intriguing secondary application exists. Comparison of wBm proteins to drug targeted proteins additionally produces a list of approved
drug and drug-like compounds which bind proteins of
similar sequences to wBm proteins. Protein sequence sim-

ilarity does not guarantee identical structures or binding
pockets, thus it is unlikely that a single turn-key compound will be identified through target similarity. However, it seems reasonable that careful filtering of this set
could reveal a panel of potential binding compounds
primed for optimization and derivatization using traditional medicinal chemistry. This opens the interesting
possibility of applying bioinformatic analysis to bypass a
portion of the arduous de novo drug development pipeline.

Conclusion
Through this analysis we were able to predict genes
important for the survival of a biologically intractable
organism using two complementary bioinformatic techniques. These predictions can then be used as a tool to
facilitate the selection of genes to enter into the drug
development process against this organism. Comparison
of the two predictions revealed that different but overlapping sets of genes were predicted, stemming from the
approaches applied. By MHS, 253 genes were predicted as
having a high likelihood of being essential. All but 8 of
those genes were also identified by the second method,
GCS. An additional 299 genes were also identified by GCS
alone as highly conserved in Wolbachia's parent order
Rickettsiales. Overall, 552 wBm genes, approximately 69%
of the genome, were identified as having a high confidence in a prediction of essentiality. The overlapping and
uniquely identified sets of genes can facilitate alternative
approaches for drug target selection.

Methods
BLAST against DEG
The 805 Refseq protein sequences for the Wolbachia endosymbiont of B. malayi strain TRS were downloaded from
the NCBI ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bac
teria. The Database of Essential Genes (DEG) version 5.2
was provided by Dr. Ren Zhang at the Centre of BioInformatics, Tianjin University. The standalone release of the
BLAST sequence alignment program version 2.2.19 was
obtained from the NCBI BLAST website [45]. Using
default parameters, blastp was used to align the wBm protein sequences against the protein sequences contained in
DEG. To produce the multi-hit score, the negative log10 of
the e-values of the highest scoring alignments to each of
the DEG organisms were normalized between 0 and 1,
squared, then averaged for all DEG organisms. E-values
greater than 1 were truncated at 1.

Jackknife Analysis
Complete Refseq protein sequences for the 15 organisms
contained within DEG were downloaded from the NCBI
Refseq ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacte
ria. For each organism, a filtered version of DEG was prepared, removing just the proteins from that organism. The
full protein complement of that organism was then subjected to MHS analysis using the filtered version of DEG,
and ranked based on MHS. Moving through the ranked
genome from highest prediction of essentiality to lowest,
the cumulative sum of DEG genes encountered was calculated. The area under the curve (AUC) of the cumulative
sum describes the effectiveness of the ranking. The upper
bound of the AUC is defined by an ideal sorting which
places all DEG genes at the top of the list. The mean and
standard deviation of the AUC for the null hypothesis of
no sorting was determined by randomly permuting the
genome sorting 1000 times. The AUCs for the random
assortments was assumed to represent a normal distribution with the observed mean and standard deviation. The
p-value of the MHS sorting versus the null hypothesis was
calculated using the probability density for a normal distribution. For the calculation of percent sorting, the AUC
for the unsorted diagonal was one-half of the total area of
the graph, calculated as the total number genes in the

genome multiplied by the number of DEG genes, divided
by two.
Gene Conservation Across Rickettsiales
Refseq protein sequences were downloaded from the
NCBI Refseq ftp site for the 27 sequenced organisms in
the order Rickettsiales (Table 3). The standalone version
1.4 of the OrthoMCL ortholog prediction program was
downloaded http://www.orthomcl.org/common/down
loads/software/[38]. OrthoMCL was used with default settings and an inflation value of 1.5 to predict orthologs
among the protein sequences of the 27 genomes. Briefly,
OrthoMCL begins by using an all-versus-all BLAST search
to identify reciprocal best BLAST hits among the genomes
as putative orthologs, and reciprocal best BLAST hits
within genomes as putative in-paralogs. These interconnections are used to form a similarity graph that is used by
the MCL clustering algorithm to break mega-clusters into
suitable sub-clusters of orthologs [46].

For each cluster of orthologous genes the minimum spanning tree (MST) distance was calculated based on the phylogenetic distances among the member genomes. The 16S
rRNA gene was extracted from each of the complete
genome sequences used in this study (Table 5). A multiple
sequence alignment of the 16S genes was generated with

Muscle v3.41 [47] using default values for maximum iterations and maximum time. A distance matrix was generated from the aligned sequences with the dnadist program
from the Phylip suite v3.68 using the Kimura 2-parameter
distance model. For each orthologous cluster, we
extracted the taxon IDs of the taxa included in the cluster.
Using the calculated distances between taxa based on
aligned 16S sequences as edge weights between the taxon
nodes, a minimum spanning tree (MST) was generated
using Prim's algorithm [48]. Each MST was scored based
on the sum of edge weights included in the tree.
MST distances for each cluster containing a wBm gene
were rounded to 2 decimal places and scaled to integers
between 0 and 100. The average negative log10 of the evalue for the BLAST alignments between the wBm gene
and the other cluster members was scaled to between 0
and 1 and added to the MST integers. This resulted in a
ranking score ranging from 0 to 101. The MST distances
comprise the majority the score. Within-cluster e-values
comprise the minority of the score, thus, for clusters with
identical MST distances, the quality of alignments within
each cluster determines order.
Drug Target Similarity
The contents of the DrugBank database containing target
protein sequence information was downloaded from the
DrugBank website http://www.drugbank.ca/[43]. Blastp
with default parameters was used to align the 805 wBm
protein sequences against the list of protein targets of
compounds found within DrugBank. The BLAST results
were filtered to remove alignments with e-values less significant than 1×10-25.
