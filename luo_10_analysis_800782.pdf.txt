Abstract
Background: The Dicer and Argonaute(AGO) proteins within the small RNA regulatory pathways (SRRPs) play an
indispensable role in regulation of gene expression. In this study, we analyzed two genes, Dicer and Argonaute,
from Schistosoma japonicum, along with their expression through a combination of bioinformatics and
experimental approaches.
Results: Our results indicate that one Dicer and four Argonaute genes exist in Schistosoma japonicum, termed
SjDicer and SjAGO1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. SjDicer encodes 2590 amino acid residues that contains 5 conserved
domains, including one amino-terminal helicase domain, one PAZ (Piwi-Argonaut-Zwille) domain, two RNAse III
domains, and one dsRNA-binding domain. SjAGO1, 2, and 3 encode 1009, 945, and 904 amino acid residues,
respectively, all of which contain PAZ and PIWI domains. In addition, we analyzed the expression profiles of SjDicer
and SjAGO1 genes by qRT-PCR in eggs, miracidium, cercariae, schistosomula, and adult worms. Results showed
consistent expression of both SjDicer and SjAGO1 in different stages; however, their expression levels were stagedependent, with the highest being in the miracidium stage.
Conclusions: This study provided the sequence of the Dicer and Ago genes of S. japonicum and their expression
profiles which are essential for further investigation of functions of miRNA in Schistosoma japonicum.

Background
Small RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways play
important and diverse roles in development and differentiation of organisms [1-5]. Dicer and Argonaute
(AGO) are the two core proteins involved in this pathway [6]. Dicer processes linear dsRNA into small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes and also excises mature
miRNAs from pre-miRNAs in the cytoplasm [7]. Mature
miRNAs and siRNAs bind to distinct members of the
Argonaute protein family to form ribonucleoprotein
complexes that recognize partially, or nearly perfect,
complementary nucleic acid targets, and then mediate a
variety of regulatory processes, including transcriptional
and post-transcriptional gene silencing [8-10].
Dicer belongs to the Ribonuclease III family and
has many subtypes, all of which contain one PAZ

(Piwi-Argonaut-Zwille) domain, two RNAse III domains,
and one RNA-binding domain (RBD) [11]. Besides the
PAZ domain, all Argonaute proteins share the structural
features of PIWI domains [12]. Both Dicer and Argonaute proteins are highly conserved between species,
and many organisms encode multiple members of the
family [13]. Although those subtypes are similar to each
other in amino acids sequence and structure, they participate in different small RNA regulatory pathways
(SRRPs) [6,14]. In general, in miRNA pathway Dicer-1
cleaves pre-miRNAs to form mature miRNAs, which
are transferred to Ago1 for silencing of target mRNAs
[3,15,16]. In siRNA pathway, long double-stranded RNA
is cleaved by Dicer-2 to form mature siRNA and then
complexes with a RISC-like structure for silencing of
target mRNA [6].
Human schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent
and serious parasitic diseases in tropical and subtropical
regions [17-19]. Schistosomiasis is mainly caused by species of Schistosoma including S. japonicum, S. mansoni,

and S. haematobium. Recently, Gomes [20] and Krautzpeterson and Skelly [21] reported the discovery of Dicer
and the Ago family using bioinformatics and experimental approaches in S. mansoni. We have previously identified small regulatory RNA in S. japonicum, including
miRNAs, by traditional cloning and high-throughput
sequencing approaches [22,23]. To further investigate
potential functions of the small RNAs and their role in
the regulatory networks in S. japonicum, it is meaningful
and important to analyse and characterize the important
proteins, Dicer and Ago. In this study, we obtained the
sequence of the Dicer and Ago genes in S. japonicum
through a combination of bioinformatics and experimental methods and analyzed their expression profiles
in different stages of the parasite.

Materials and methods
Sequence retrieval of Dicer and Argonaute families

S. japonicum genome and transcriptome sequence data
were downloaded from SCBIT (http://www.scbit.org/
pages/index.do), as well as the Sanger Institute (http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/) and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/). Amino acid sequences of D. melanogaster and S.
mansoni orthologs were used as queries. The BLASTp
algorithm, underpinned by the Pfam and CDD databases
was used for searches of conserved protein domains or
motifs.
Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses

Multiple alignments of protein sequence were performed by ClustalX and phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA 4 [24]. Phylogenetic trees of these
sequences were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining
method [25]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred
from 1000 replicates was used to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50%
bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of
replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown
next to the branches [26]. The tree was drawn to scale,
with branch lengths in the same units as those of the
evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic
tree. All positions containing gaps and missing data
were eliminated from the dataset.
Parasites

Parasite culturing was performed as described previously
[22]. S. japonicum was maintained by routine passage
through Oncomelania hupensis snails and BALB/c mice.
The infected snails were induced to shed cercariae
under light exposure for 2 h, and the cercariae were
recovered by sedimentation on ice. Schistosomula or
adult worms were obtained by liver perfusion of mice

Page 2 of 8

after 3 or 6 wks of infection. Eggs were obtained from
liver of mice 6 wks after infected by S. japonicum. Eggs
were then incubated to produce miracidium at room
temperature and normal light conditions. After collection, all freshly isolated samples were washed three
times with 1 × phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4,
and were immediately used for extraction of total RNA
or stored in liquid nitrogen. All procedures performed
on animals within this study were conducted in accordance with and by approval of the Tongji University
Committee on Use and Care of Animals.
PCR amplification and RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA
Ends)

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent. To make
sure there was no contamination by S. Japonicum DNA,
total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I. And
then total RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer, and 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using
an oligo-dT primer. Reverse-transcribed cDNA samples
were used as templates for PCR amplification. The 5′
UTR and 3′UTR of genes were amplified via RACE
(rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using the Full RACE
kit from TaKaRa, and target sequences were then cloned
and sequenced.
Real-time PCR analysis

Eggs, cercariae, schistosomula, and adult worms were
collected for real-time PCR to quantify developmental
expression of SjDicer and SjAGO. Reverse-transcribed
cDNA was prepared as above-mentioned and was used
as templates for real-time PCR amplification using
SYBR Green (TaKaRa) and a 7300 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). Specific primers for S.
japonicum GAPDH were used as a control. Relative
expression was calculated according to the 2-ΔΔCt
method [27].

Results
Data mining of Dicer- and Argonaute-related sequences
in S. japonicum

Homology analyses at the amino acid level revealed that
the members of small RNA regulatory pathways (SRRPs)
are well conserved among diverse organisms of D. melanogaster, C. elegans, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and
S. Mansoni [20]. Due to the closer relationship between
S. japonicum and S. mansoni, we chose SmDicer and
SmAGO1/2/3/4 as reference sequences to retrieve their
orthologs in S. japonicum.
Transcriptome analysis via BLAST of S. japonicum
revealed one EST (AY810618) of 538 bp on supercontig
CCON0000000957 that exhibited sequence similarity to
proteins belonging to the Dicer family. Based on data
mining of the transcriptome database of S. japonicum,

Luo et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:90
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/90

Page 3 of 8

we found two mRNA sequences (IDs: AY814744 and
AY808628) with similarity to AGO1, three mRNA
sequences (IDs: FN330861, AY809895, and AY809756)
with similarity to AGO2, one mRNA sequence (ID:
Sjc_0103990) with similarity to AGO3, and one protein
sequence (ID: sjp_0117000) with similarity to AGO4.
Therefore, we suggest that S. japonicum contains four
members of the Argonaute protein family. These genes
were named SjAGO1, SjAGO2, SjAGO3, SjAGO4, and
SjDicer, respectively; however, all of them are partial
coding sequences but SjAGO3. The complete CDS of
SjAGO3 gene is 2715 bp coding a 904 aa protein in
size. Therefore, we further obtained the remaining
sequences of these genes through experimental
approaches.
Exploring the entire coding sequences of SjDicer in the
genome

Homologous analysis confirmed that the SmDicer gene is
highly homologous to CCON0000000957. Therefore, we
designed PCR primers(Table 1: primer1, 2 and 3 )
according to conserved regions of AY810618 and
CCON0000000957 in order to amplify CDS of the SjDicer gene using parasite cDNA as template. Consequently,

the majority of the SjDicer coding sequence was determined in this manner. Furthermore, the 5′ and 3′ ends of
the SjDicer gene were cloned by RACE using the Full
RACE kit (Table 1: primer 4 and 5). After sequence and
concatenation, the whole coding sequence of SjDicer was
obtained. We annotated the SjDicer gene according to
known genomic and transcriptome data.
A diagrammatic representation of the SjDicer gene is
shown in Fig. 1. The size of the gene is approximately
60,000 bp. Its precise size is unknown, however, because
the entire sequence of two introns is not complete, in
spite of attempts to span the introns using PCR. The
SjDicer gene includes 28 exons, ranging in size from 46
bp to 921 bp, forming a 7796 bp ORF. The SjDicer gene
encodes a 2590-aa protein with a predicted molecular
weight of 296,058 Da. Genome transcriptome analysis
suggests that S. japonicum possesses a single Dicer gene.
Alignment analysis revealed 71.8% identity between
SmDicer and SjDicer proteins, and 9.2% identity among
Dicers derived from C. elegans, D. melanogaster, Aedes
aegypti and H. sapiens. Phylogenetic relationship analysis further demonstrated that SjDicer is an ortholog of
the Dicer-like group and closely related to C. elegans
and S. mansoni orthologs.

Figure 1 Diagrammatic representation of SjDicer. The SjDicer gene is approximately 60,000 bp in length and located on contig
CCON0000000957. The complete mRNA of the SjDicer gene is 7,796 nt and contains 28 exons, which encode a 2590 aa protein, including an
amino-terminal helicase domain, a DUF283(Domain of unknown function), a PAZ(Piwi-Argonaut-Zwille) domain, two tandom RNAse III domains,
and an dsRBD(double strand RNA-binding domain).

Analysis of conserved protein domains in SjDicer

The BLASTp algorithm, underpinned by the Pfam
(v22.0) and CDD databases, was used for searches of
conserved protein domains or motifs from SjDicer
sequences. Results revealed that SjDicer contains an
amino-terminal helicase domain, a DUF283 domain, a
PAZ domain, two tandom RNAse III domains, and a
dsRNA-binding domain (Fig. 1).
Sequence analysis of SjDicer results revealed that the
amino-terminal helicase domain possesses a conserved
motif ( 158 DECH 161 ), indicating that it belongs to the
DEAD-box protein family of RNA helicases [28]. The
DUF283 domain of SjDicer proteins has a doublestranded RNA-binding fold. The PAZ domain of SjDicer
is larger than its counterpart from other orthologs. The
SjDicer protein contains a tandom RNase III domain.
Table 2 shows that the tandem RNase III domain has
four catalytic residues, ED and DE, which are important
for function of the RNase III domain [14,20]. The
dsRNA-binding domain exists at the carboxyl terminal
of the SjDicer protein.

Exploring the entire coding sequences of SjAGO1 and
SjAGO2 in the genome

AGO1 and AGO2 play a pivotal role in small RNA regulatory pathways (SRRPs) [6]. Therefore, our study focused
mainly on SjAGO1 and SjAGO2. Transcriptome analysis
of S. japonicum demonstrated that two ESTs, AY814744
and AY808628, were highly similar to the upstream and
downstream regions of the SmAGO1 gene. At the same
time, these analyses easily identified the 3′ end of
SjAGO1, since the extreme 3′ end of SmAGO1 matched
the sequence of AY814744. However, the extreme 5′ end
of the SjAGO1 cDNA is not well conserved and could
not be identified by analysis of the genomic contig
sequences. Moreover, there was no overlap between
AY814744 and AY808628. Therefore, we designed primers based on the two known sequences, in order to
amplify overlapping fragments of the predicted SjAGO1
coding gene. The 5′ end of the SjAGO1 was cloned by
RACE(Table 1: prmier 7, 8 and 9). Finally, the full
SjAGO1 gene sequence was obtained after spliced
sequences were concatenated. All exons combine to form
a 3266 bp ORF, potentially encoding a 1009-aa protein
with a predicted molecular weight of 111,647 Da.
Regarding the SjAGO2 gene, three ESTs matched the
sequence. Moreover, the 3′ end of the SjAGO2 gene,
including the stop codon and 3′UTR, were located on
AY809756. Based on these sequences, we designed primers to amplify the unknown sequence by PCR. The 5′
end was cloned by the 5′ RACE(Table 1: primer 11 and
12). After sequence and concatenation, the whole coding
sequence of SjAGO2 was obtained. All exons combine to
form a 3199 bp open-reading frame, potentially encoding
a 945-aa protein with a predicted molecular weight of

107,121 Da. The phylogenetic tree created with the Neighbor-Joining method also demonstrated that SjAGO1 and 2
are orthologs of the AGO-like group and closely related to
C. elegans and S. Mansoni orthologs (Fig. 2).
Analysis of conserved protein domains in SjAGO

The alignment of AGO-like members revealed that most
of their components, including SjAGO1/2, exhibited

conservation of key amino acid (SjAGO1: D747/D819/
H957 SjAGO2: D692/D774/H907) residues that coordinate Mg 2+ at the PIWI domain. Further, alignments
between SjAGO1/2 proteins revealed 58% identity. Like all
members of the AGO family in other species, SjAGO1/2
also have two main domains, PIWI and PAZ (Fig. 3). The
core region of the PAZ domain contains 136 and 67 aa
residues in SjAGO1 and 2, respectively. The PIWI domain

Figure 3 Diagrammatic representation of the conserved domains of the SjAGO protein family. They all contain PAZ and PIWI conserved
domains. In addition, the SjAGO1 gene has a DUF1785 domain. SjAGO1, 2, and 3 proteins are 987 aa, 924 aa, and 904 aa in size, respectively

contains about 300 aa residues in SjAGO1/2. In addition,
there was a DUF1785 (domain of unknown function1785) domain in SjAGO1, which included 52 aa residues,
the function of which is not yet clear.
Analysis of expression profiles of SjDicer and SjAGO in
different stages of the parasite by Real-Time PCR

We analyzed the expression profiles of SjDicer and
SjAGO1 by relative qRT-PCR in different developmental
stages of parasite, including eggs, miracidium, cercariae,
schistosomula, and adult worms (Fig. 4). Detection was
normalized to expression of the endogenous control
SjGAPDH(Table 1: prmier 6, 12 and 13). The data are
presented as the fold-change in gene expression normalized to an endogenous reference gene and relative to
the levels found in the egg stage. As shown in Fig. 4,
the expression of both SjDicer and SjAGO1 was detectable in all investigated stages of parasite. Moreover, the
expression of SjDicer and SjAGO1 was highly consistent
in each stage, but their expression levels were stage-specific. The highest expression levels of both SjDicer and
SjAGO1 were seen in the miracidium stage. Interestingly, their expression reduced dramatically following
penetration of the cercaria into its host, and then proceeded to increase for the remainder of the organism’s
lifespan within the mammalian host.

Discussion
In S. japonicum, miRNAs have been identified by traditional approaches or high-throughput sequencing
[22,23]. Meanwhile, endo-siRNAs were also found in S.
japonicum via Solexa technology [23]. All of these imply
the presence of constituents of the small RNA

regulatory pathways in S. japonicum. Through a combination of phylogenetic tree, similarity between domains
and mining of the S. japonium database we were able to
show putative sequences with conserved domains of the
Small RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways in the
parasite. The results revealed that there was a single
Dicer and four members of the AGO family in S. japonicum, named SjDicer and SjAGO1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. However, all of these are partial coding
sequences. Our study mainly focused on SjDicer and
SjAGO1/2 in an effort to elucidate their full-length gene
sequences through experimental approaches.
Our data indicate that the SjDicer gene comprises 28
exons that potentially encode a 2590 amino acid protein.
Like SmDicer, SjDicer protein contains all domains that
are characteristic of metazoan dicers including an amino
terminal helicase domain, DUF283, a PAZ domain, two
RNAse III domains and an RNA binding domain
[20,21]. The identity between the SmDicer and SjDicer
is as much as 71.8% in protein level. Among these
domains, RNase III domains specifically cleave one
strand of dsRNA. The first RNAse III domain is predicted to cut the RNA strand bearing a 3′-hydroxy
group approximately 21 nucleotides from the end. In
conjunction with the PAZ domain, the RNAse III
domain is thought to be responsible for determining the
distance from the terminus of the RNA to the cleavage
site [29]. Dicer proteins are key components of the biogenesis of small RNA such as miRNA and siRNA. For
example, Lee et al. [30] showed that Drosophila Dcr-1
mutants were defective in processing miRNA precursors,
whereas Dcr-2 mutants had reduced siRNA levels and a
complete RNAi defect in the eye.

Figure 4 Developmental expression analysis of S. japonicum (a) SjDicer and (b) SjAGO1. The mRNA expression levels were measured,
based on three replicates, in the life stages: eggs, miracidium, cercariae, schistosomula, and adult worms, using quantitative RT-PCR. Expression
levels were calibrated according to the comparative 2-ΔΔCt method, using the constitutively expressed SjGAPDH gene as an endogenous control,
and were normalized relative to the egg stage.

Different Ago proteins have been found in several
organisms, ranging from a single member in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, to more than twenty in C. Elegans
[13,31]. Alignments between SjAGO1 and SmAGO1
(SjAGO2 and SmAGO2) proteins revealed 81.1%(81.2%)
identity. The role of Ago family in Drosophila and in C.
elegans development is well documented for D. melanogaster and C. elegans [32]. It was observed that Ago1/2
are primary effector proteins responsible for the small
RNA silencing pathway in fly and in C. Elegans. For
example, Okamura et al. [33] showed that Drosophila
AGO1 is essential for mature miRNA production,
whereas AGO2 is responsible for siRNA-directed RNAi.
The PAZ domain of Argonaute is a small RNA-binding

domain, while the PIWI domain is an RNase-H-type
domain that relies on divalent cation binding to facilitate dsRNA-guided cleavage of ssRNA [34].
Most small-RNA regulatory pathways are expressed in
a developmental or organ-specific manner, or both,
which provides information regarding their functions.
As mentioned, SjDicer and SjAGO1 are crucial proteins
in the miRNA regulatory pathway. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of SjDicer and SjAGO1 by relative
qRT-PCR in different developmental stages of S. japonicum. The expression patterns of SjDicer and SjAGO1
during the life cycle of S. japonicum indicate that the
miRNA regulatory pathway might take part in the transformation and development of S. japonicum.

Conclusions
In summary, This study demonstrated existence of Dicer
and Argonaute genes in S. japonicum and the 2590 amino
acid residues of SjDicer containing 5 conserved domains,
and the 1009, 945, and 904 amino acid residues of the
SjAGO1, 2, and 3, respectively. In addition, expression
profiles of SjDicer and SjAGO1 genes showed consistent
expression of both genes in different stages, but difference
in their expression levels. The study provides a theoretical
platform for exploration of the functions of siRNA and
miRNA in S. japonicum. Further investigations should be
considered to explore the functions of the SjDicer and
SjAGO families through experimental approaches.
