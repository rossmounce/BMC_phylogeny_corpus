A survey of well conserved families of C2H2
zinc-finger genes in Daphnia
Research article

Abstract
Background: A recent comparative genomic analysis tentatively identified roughly 40 orthologous groups of C2H2
Zinc-finger proteins that are well conserved in "bilaterians" (i.e. worms, flies, and humans). Here we extend that analysis
to include a second arthropod genome from the crustacean, Daphnia pulex.
Results: Most of the 40 orthologous groups of C2H2 zinc-finger proteins are represented by just one or two proteins
within each of the previously surveyed species. Likewise, Daphnia were found to possess a similar number of orthologs
for all of these small orthology groups. In contrast, the number of Sp/KLF homologs tends to be greater and to vary
between species. Like the corresponding mammalian Sp/KLF proteins, most of the Drosophila and Daphnia homologs
can be placed into one of three sub-groups: Class I-III. Daphnia were found to have three Class I proteins that roughly
correspond to their Drosophila counterparts, dSP1, btd, CG5669, and three Class II proteins that roughly correspond to
Luna, CG12029, CG9895. However, Daphnia have four additional KLF-Class II proteins that are most similar to the
vertebrate KLF1/2/4 proteins, a subset not found in Drosophila. Two of these four proteins are encoded by genes linked
in tandem. Daphnia also have three KLF-Class III members, one more than Drosophila. One of these is a likely Bteb2
homolog, while the other two correspond to Cabot and KLF13, a vertebrate homolog of Cabot.
Conclusion: Consistent with their likely roles as fundamental determinants of bilaterian form and function, most of the
40 groups of C2H2 zinc-finger proteins are conserved in kind and number in Daphnia. However, the KLF family includes
several additional genes that are most similar to genes present in vertebrates but missing in Drosophila.
Background
Zinc-finger proteins (ZFP) represent the largest family of
DNA-binding transcription factors in eukaryotes.
Although many proteins are predicted to contain single
zinc-finger domains, two zinc fingers in close proximity
appear to be required for high-affinity DNA binding.
There are many diverse subfamilies of zinc-finger proteins in eukaryotes, but the most numerous are the Kruppel-type C2H2 ZFPs. Many of these proteins contain
either multiple tandem pairs of zinc-fingers or tandem
arrays of three or more zinc-fingers. As transcription factors, they participate generally in the fundamental mechanism of gene expression. However, they usually also play
more specific roles in a wide variety of regulated biological processes, including signal transduction, cell growth,
differentiation, and development. As part of our collaborative role in annotating the draft genome assembly v1.1 of

the Daphnia pulex genome[1], we focused our attention
on a subset of roughly 40 orthologous groups of C2H2
ZFPs identified in a recent comparative genomic analysis
to be well conserved in "bilaterians" (i.e. worms, flies, and
humans)[2]. While many of these were known or likely
DNA-binding transcription factors encoding proteins
with tandem arrays of zinc-fingers (e.g. Zif268, MTF1,
TFIIIA, SP1 and KLF), others had only a single zinc finger
(e.g. SAP61, SAP62, and Kin17), which generally lack a
DNA-binding function [2]. Also included are some genes
that encode multiple split pairs of C2H2 zinc-fingers, like
Disco

Results
Previously 39 families of C2H2 ZFP were determined to
be present in the common ancestor of bilaterians based
on a survey of three organisms: Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.
Although the work described below necessitated the
addition of three more conserved families to this collec-

tion, two pairs of the original 39 families could also be
reasonably combined into single families. Hence, we created a reorganized summary list of 40 orthologous groups
of C2H2 ZFP. The resulting list of family members and
their accession IDs are provided in Table 1, 2, 3 and 4,
while an efficient numerical summary is provided in
Table 5. A brief description of the known or proposed
function(s) and structural organization for each of these
families is provided in series below.
A relatively rigorous assessment of homology/orthology is provided by a set of carefully constructed phylogenetic trees (see Figure 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and
supplementary Additional file 1 and 2). These trees also
serve to summarize various evolutionary events of interest, such as presumptive gene losses, duplications, and
lineage-specific expansions. Larger C2H2 Zinc-finger
families (i.e. Sp and KLF) are presented within separate
trees (Figures 1 and 2), while most of the remaining families are displayed in a short series of multi-family summary trees (Figure 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). The latter provide
additional evidence that member gene clusters represent
distinct families of correctly identified homologs and
putative orthologs. Evidence for the expression of almost
all of these genes at the RNA level was obtained using a
NimbleGen tiling array [3-5] and the EST data available
at JGI portal [1,6]. Only three genes lack any evidence of
expression to date (KLF2D, ZFam9, and FEZL).
Sp/KLF, the Largest Family of C2H2 ZFP (Figures 1 &2)

The Sp/KLF proteins are DNA-binding transcription factors each containing 3 zinc-fingers. Although Sp and KLF
factors are closely related, they occupy distinct branches
on a combined evolutionary tree. To facilitate presentation, however, it was most convenient to separate these
families into two distinct trees, each rooted with two
members from the other family (Figures 1 and 2).
Although frequently described as simple transcription
factors (especially Sp), many are known to interact with
particular sets of chromatin remodeling complexes to
facilitate transcriptional activation or repression [7]. In
vertebrates, Sp/KLF proteins are grouped into three
classes that tend to correlate with the type of chromatin
remodeling complexes they utilize. Conveniently, most of
the invertebrate proteins can also be assigned to one of
these classes [8]. dSP1, btd, and CG5669 correspond to
three distinct subsets of Sp-Class I proteins Sp7/8, Sp5,
and Sp1/2/3/4, respectively (Figure 1). Luna, CG12029,
and CG9895 correspond to the KLF-Class II proteins
KLF6/7, KLF5, and KLF3/8/12, respectively (Figure 2).
Bteb2 and Cabot correspond to KLF-Class III proteins
KLF15 and KLF9/10/11/13/14/16, respectively (Figure 2).
The two remaining fly proteins (CG3065 and hkb) are difficult to place unambiguously. The former shows roughly
equal similarity to members of both the Sp and KLF sub-

Page 2 of 20

families, while the latter appears to be a highly diverged
and relatively unique member of the Sp/KLF family.
Information concerning the function of many of these
proteins is available in a variety of organisms [9,10]. In
vertebrates, some Sp/KLF proteins produce early embryonic lethals when mutated (Sp1, KLF5), some are known
to affect behavior and/or the development of structures
within the brain (Sp4, Sp8, KLF9), and others affect
development of the blood cells (Sp3, KLF1, KLF3), goblet
cells in the colon, or bone cells (Sp7). In Drosophila, buttonhead (btd) is important for the development of head
structures, and both btd and dSp1 affect development of
the mechano-sensory organs [11]. Cabot (cbt) also affects
sensory organ development, as well as dorsal closure [12].
Perturbations of luna expression via RNA interference or
over-expression during early Drosophila embryogenesis
leads to developmental arrest at different embryonic
stages [13]. Daphnia appear to contain three Sp
homologs (Sp8, Sp5, Sp4), each of which correspond to
specific counterparts (SP1, btd, CG5669) in Drosophila.
In contrast, the KLF gene family in Daphnia includes 10
distinct genes, 4 more than the complement in Drosophila. Dp-KLF3, Dp-Luna, Dp-Cabot, and Dp-Bteb2
appear to correspond to the fly genes CG9895, Luna,
Cabot, and Bteb2, respectively. No clear homologs of
KLF17 or CG12029 are apparent in Daphnia. In contrast,
six KLF genes in Daphnia with no direct homologs in
Drosophila seem to correspond to two subfamilies of KLF
found in the vertebrate genome. Five of these, Dp-KLF1A
through Dp-KLF1E, may represent a species specific gene
expansion that roughly corresponds to an independent
expansion in humans that includes KLF1/2/4. The sixth
may be a lone homolog of the vertebrate expansion that
includes KLF 9/13/14/16.
C2H2 ZFP resistant to deletion/expansion

Some C2H2 ZFP exist as single copy family members in
all 4 genomes. Hence, these genes appear to be relatively
resistant to deletion or expansion over evolutionary time.
ZNF277 is one of several examples (Figure 3). This gene
encodes a protein with five C2H2 zinc fingers. The function of this gene is not well understood. In humans, this
gene is expressed in early embryonic tissues, parathyroid
adenoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia suggesting
that this gene might be involved in differentiation [14].
ZFAM5 is also known as ZNF622 or Zinc finger related
protein 9 (ZRP9) and is highly conserved almost universally in eukaryotes. Most homologs have 4 zinc-fingers
(Figure 3). ZFAM5 was originally identified in mouse as a
cellular MPK38 serine/threonine kinase binding protein
that may be involved in early T cell activation and embryonic development [15]. In humans this gene is responsible for interaction with the ubiquitously expressed MYB-

B transcriptional regulator. The role of this gene in other
organisms is not well understood [16].
ZFAM6 is also known as Zinc finger Matrin Type 2
(ZMAT2). It is a highly conserved gene present in most
eukaryotes. Little is known about its function. A single
homolog of this gene was also found in Daphnia (Figure
3). All family members possess one U1-like zinc finger.
This type of C2H2 zinc finger is also present in the protein matrin, the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C,
and other RNA-binding proteins.
ZFAM7 is also known as Zinc Finger 598 (ZNF598) in
vertebrates. This gene is highly conserved in most
eukaryotes and is present as a single homolog in most
species, including Daphnia (Figure 3). The gene has five
C2H2 zinc fingers. The function of this gene is largely
unknown.
SAP61 (Splicosome Associated Protein 61) is also
known as Splicosome factor 3a subunit 3 (SF3a3), while
SAP62 (Splicosome Associated Protein 62) is also known
as Splicosome factor 3a subunit 2 (SF3a2). These
sequences do not cluster within a phylogenetic tree of

zinc finger genes (Figure 3). However, since they share
common function by virtue of being subunits of the same
protein complex involved in RNA splicing, we described
them together. A single homolog for these genes is present in almost all species of eukaryotes, including
Daphnia. Both have a highly conserved U1-like zinc finger that is typical for RNA binding proteins. These are
essential proteins, required for the formation of SF3a and
functional U2 snRNP. Together with SF3b, SF3a binds to
the 12S U2 snRNP, which contains a common core of
seven Sm proteins and the U2-specific proteins U2-A and
U2-B [17,18].
KIN17 is present in almost all eukaryotic organisms.
Daphnia have a single homolog for this gene. KIN17
includes a single highly conserved U1-like zinc finger and
is likely to be involved in cellular response to DNA damage, gene expression, and DNA replication. The KIN17
protein shares sequence homology with bacterial RecA
protein over 40 residues near the c terminus. KIN 17 is
ubiquitously expressed in mammals at low levels, but is
up regulated after exposure to UV and ionizing radiation.

KIN17 binds to DNA targets found in hot spots of illegitimate recombination [19-21].
A single homolog of ZNF207 is present in almost all
vertebrates and invertebrates. Daphnia also has a single
homolog (Figure 8). The N terminus of this protein contains 2 C2H2 type zinc fingers. This gene is expressed
ubiquitously in humans [22], but the exact function is still
not clear.
C2H2 ZFP with expansions in organisms other than
Daphnia

The Daphnia genome appears to deploy a relatively efficient set of well conserved C2H2 ZFP because many

C2H2 subfamilies have undergone lineage specific expansions in other genomes. In fact, 12 of the 40 well conserved families considered here show expansions in flies
or humans, but not in Daphnia. For instance, Zfam1 (Figure 4) codes for a small peptide of 70 to 80 residues that
contains one C2H2 type zinc finger. This gene is conserved in chordates and insects. Lineage specific independent duplications have generated 2 homologs in
Drosophila and 2 in C. elegans. Daphnia have just one
homolog for this gene that clusters with the Drosophila
homolog. The function of these genes is not well understood.

Humans have three ZFAM2/BCL11 homologs: Bcl11A,
Bcl11B, and ZNF342/Zfp296. BCL11A has 5 zinc-fingers,
and is a homolog of the murine gene Evi9. Evi9 was found
to be deregulated in mouse myeloid leukemias induced
by proviral integration. Hence Evi9 has characteristics of
a dominant oncogene. Human EVI9/BCL11A is
expressed in CD341 myeloid precursors. BCL11A is
known to be involved in both Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins B-cell lymphoma [23,24]. BCL11A acts as a protooncogene for B-cell lymphoma, as a recessive oncogene
for T-cell lymphoma, and is apparently required for the
expression of some globin genes [25]. Bcl11B also appears
to act like a recessive oncogene for T-cells [26]. The single
Daphnia homolog appears closely related to the Drosophila version (Figure 4). Apparently, duplication in mammals led to 2 or three versions of this gene, two of which
became key regulators in hematopoetic lineages, while
the third appears to function in the nervous system.
ZNF342 has been indirectly implicated in the suppression of gliomas.
ZFAM4 is also known as Rotund and Squeeze in Drosophila, and Lin-29 (abnormal cell LINeage family member
29) in C. elegans. There appears to be 3 homologs for this
family in humans and one additional homolog in Drosophila. Most genes in this family have 5 zinc fingers while
two human genes (ZNF384 and ZNF362) and one Drosophila gene (CG2052) have an additional zinc finger. The
Daphnia homolog clusters with Drosophila Rotund and
squeeze (Figure 4). Roughened eye (Roe) is a part of the
rotund gene represented by a different transcript by using
a different promoter. They both share the C-terminal
region and zinc finger domain but differ in their N-terminal regions. Roe appears to have a role in eye development in the embryos [27]. The C. elegans gene lin-29 is
required for terminal differentiation of the lateral hypodermal seam cells during the larval-to-adult molt and
proper vulva morphogenesis. CIZ (CAS interacting Protein or ZNF384) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein
that binds to CAS elements found in promoters of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) genes that produce enzymes
used to degrade the extracellular matrix proteins [28].
ZFAM11 is also known as KCMF (Potassium channel
modulatory factor). It is present in most vertebrates and
invertebrates. Daphnia, like most vertebrates, has a single
copy. C. elegans too have a single member for this family
which suggests that the gene has been duplicated specifically in flies/insects (Figure 4). All of these genes have a
highly conserved region which includes one ZZ type zinc
finger and one C2H2 type zinc finger. The ZZ motif is
known to bind two zinc ions and most likely participates
in ligand binding or molecular scaffolding. In vertebrates,
KCMF1 is shown to have intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase
activity. Studies indicated that KCMF1 is involved in reg-

Page 10 of 20

ulating growth modulators [29]. The function of KCMF1
homologs in Drosophila and worms is poorly understood.
Fez typically has 6 zinc-fingers, and is a likely ortholog
of the human genes ZNF-312 and 312-like. The forebrain
expression pattern for this gene was first described in
zebrafish, where there is also a second homolog known as
Fezl. Fez expression is first detected in the anterior presumptive neuroectoderm of zebrafish during epiboly.
Expression becomes focused in the rostral forebrain
region during somitogenesis. By 24 hrs, expression is
largely restricted to the telencephalon and anterior/ventral region of the diencephalon. Hence Fez is an early
marker of anterior neuroectoderm and appears to regulate forebrain development [30]. In mammals, these proteins appear to regulate olfactory-bulb development and
neuronal differentiation in the cortex [31,32]. Double
knockouts indicate that together FEZ and FEZL play a
role in rostral brain patterning in mouse. Drosophila and
Daphnia appear to have only one homolog of Fez (Figure
4). There is little information about the role of the Fez
protein in these organisms.
The zinc-finger E-box binding (ZEB) homeobox genes
(Figure 5) were previously described as two separate families in chordates (ZEB1/ZFHX1A/ZFH1 and ZEB2/
ZFHX1B/ZFH2) or as the zinc finger axon guidance gene
(ZAG1) in C. elegans. The gene is conserved in most bilaterians and usually has a homeodomain flanked by two
separate, highly conserved zinc finger clusters. Most have
6 C2H2 type zinc fingers present as triplets distributed
over the length of the gene. The E-box-like target sites
overlap with those bound by the Snail family of zinc-finger proteins. ZEB proteins can repress target genes transcription by recruiting the CtBP (C-terminal-binding
protein) co-repressor, which is a component of the larger
repressor complex containing HDAC (histone deacetylase) and PcG (polycomb group proteins) [33]. ZEB1 and
ZEB2 in humans are expressed in several tissues including muscle and CNS. They are also expressed in T lymphocytes and during skeletal differentiation. They are
mediators of epithelial dedifferentiation in mammals
through the down-regulation of E-cadherin expression
[34]. ZEB2, also known as Smad Interacting Protein 1
(SIP1), is over expressed in cancer cells, causing loss of
cell polarity and facilitating migratory and invasive
behavior. SIP1 is also involved in the development of the
neural-crest, the central nervous system, the septum of
the heart, and establishment of the midline [35]. Mutations in SIP1 cause Mowat-Wilson Syndrome, a mental
retardation syndrome in humans [36,37]. In Drosophila,
ZFH1 is a transcriptional repressor that regulates differentiation of muscle and gonadal cells, but is also
expressed in the CNS [38]. ZAG-1 in C. elegans also acts
as a repressor that regulates multiple, discrete neuronspecific aspects of terminal differentiation, including cell

migration, axonal development, and gene expression [39].
Daphnia have a single homolog.
ZFHX genes encode zinc-finger homeobox containing
proteins previously described as two separate families
(ZFH3 and ZFH4) in bilaterians. In vertebrates this gene
appears to have undergone duplications generating 2 or
more additional homologs (Figure 5). In humans, there
are 3 homologs (ZFHX2, ZFHX3 and ZFHX4). Family
members usually contain 8 or more C2H2 zinc fingers
distributed throughout the gene. The Daphnia homolog
has 11 C2H2 type zinc fingers. ZFHX genes are thought
to be important regulators of neuronal differentiation
[40]. Like most homeotic genes, these genes are also
involved in embryonic morphogenesis. ZFHX3, also
known as AT motif binding factor 1 (ATBF1), inhibits cell
growth and differentiation and may play a role in malignant transformation. It has been shown that it is potential
tumor suppressor genes that repress alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) whose altered expression may lead to development
of carcinoma in various tissues [41]. ZFHX4 expression is
important for neuronal and muscle differentiation, and in

[42]. The Drosophila homolog ZFH2 is involved in establishing proximal-distal domains in the developing wing
disc [43].
Spalt-like (SALL) proteins have a variable number of
zinc-fingers: the worm homolog has 6, flies and Daphnia
have 7, and chicken/human have 7 or 9, depending on the
homolog. The two fly genes, Spalt-major (SALM) and
Spalt-related (SALR), appear to have duplicated independently from the ancestral gene that also gave rise to the
four human homologs (Figure 5). SAL in flies is required
for proper development of the trachea, for vein patterning in wing imaginal discs, and for bristle formation in

homolog (SEM4) affect development of neurons and sensory organs, while mutations in a human homolog
(SALL1) result in sensorineural hearing loss and mental
retardation (but also anal, genital, and limb malformation). Flies lacking both SALM and SALR are also deaf,
with limb and genital malformations potentially analogous to those in humans [45].
ZEP homologs (Figure 6) are referred to as Schnurri
(Shn) in flies and SMA9 in worms. There are three or
more homologs in vertebrates, but just one in worms,
flies, and Daphnia, suggesting a lineage specific expansion exclusive to vertebrates. ZEP proteins generally have

five C2H2 zinc-fingers divided into two pairs and a solitary medial finger (missing in some homologs). The
worm homologs have an additional C-terminal zinc finger pair with little similarity to the other family members,
implying a unique function. The C terminus of this protein is also unique to worm [46]. ZEP/Shn/SMA9
homologs are involved in BMP signaling. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming
growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²) family that regulate various biological process including embryonic axes, cell fate determination, proliferation and apoptosis in both invertebrate
and vertebrate model systems. In mouse, Shn-2 is
required for efficient transcription of PPARÎ³2, which in
turn drives the expression of several genes involved in
adipocyte differentiation [47]. Shn3 in mouse is a transcriptional regulator of Runx2, which in turn activates
several osteoblast differentiation genes. In humans Shn3

effector function, and inflammatory response [48]. In
worms, SMA9/SMAD affects body size regulation and
male tail patterning in worms [49]. In Drosophila, Shn
binds to SMAD to form the repression complex controlling brinker (Brk), which is a transcriptional repressor of
the Dpp gene. Dpp is involved in anterior-posterior patterning and cell proliferation in the wing blade [50].
The Insulinoma Associated gene (IA1) of vertebrates is
called Nerfin in flies and Egg laying 46 (EGL46) in worms.

Drosophila and EGR has additional homologs in Humans and C. elegans. The branch values indicate posterior probability and values
greater than 50 are shown (Hs-Homo sapiens, Dm-Drosophila melanogaster, Ce-Caenorhabditis elegans and Dp-Daphnia pulex).

Daphnia and C. elegans appear to have just one homolog
with two conserved zinc-fingers. This gene appears to
have undergone independent duplications in the human
and fly lineages, giving rise to two paralogs in each (Figure 6). IA homologs are involved in various aspects of
neuronal differentiation including cell fate specification,
axon guidance decisions and cell migration. In Humans
IA1 promotes pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells
development [51]. Recent reports for mice and zebra fish
imply that its role in neurogenesis is conserved across
vertebrates as well as invertebrates [52,53].
Hamlet is also called PR domain zinc finger protein 16
(PRDM16) or ecotropic virus integration site 1 (EVI-1)
homolog in vertebrates, Hamlet in Drosophila and Egg
laying 43 (EGL43) in C. elegans. Daphnia has one
homolog. Independent duplications in insects and vertebrates appear to have generated two paralogs each in
their respective clades (Figure 6). All homologs contain
an N-terminal PR (PRD1-BF1-RIZ1) homology domain
followed by a group of six zinc fingers and a group of
three additional ZFs at the C-terminus. In Drosophila,
hamlet functions as a binary genetic switch specifically
affecting the dendritic branching structure of external
sensory (ES) neurons in the peripheral nervous system
[54]. In C. elegans, egl-43 encodes two transcription factors that act to control HSN migration and phasmid neuron development, presumably by regulating other genes
that function directly in these processes [55]. The murine
homolog Evi-1 was obtained from a common site of viral
integration in murine myeloid leukemia. The human
homolog MDS1/EVI1 is transcriptionally activated by
several recurrent chromosomal aberrations like acute

myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS). Recently, another homolog of HAM called MEL1
(MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1) was identified as a member of
the EVI1 gene family and also as a PR domain member
(PRDM16), all of which are implicated in neural development [56]. The disruption of the PR domain of this gene
can cause leukemia. A partial disruption of the Mds1/
Evi1 locus in mouse leads to multiple defects causing
mid-gestation lethality, including defects of hypocellularity in the neuroectoderm and a failure of peripheral nerve
formation [57].
The stripe gene (Sr) in Drosophila functions in the epidermis to facilitate cellular recognition of myotubules
(Figure 7). Hence, stripe mutants exhibit a disruption in
myotubule patterning. Stripe is a member of the EGR
(early growth response) family of transcription factors.
The Egr transcription factors are rapidly induced by
diverse extracellular physiological/chemical stimuli
within the vertebrate nervous system. These proteins
possess 3 zinc fingers. Another member of this family,

Seetharam et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:276
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/276

Krox20, is known to be involved in development of the
hindbrain and neural crest in mammals. Analysis of
mouse knockouts has demonstrated that Egr2/Krox-20 is
important for hindbrain segmentation and development,
peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelination, and
Schwann cell differentiation [58]. Krox20 expression correlates with the onset of myelination in the PNS. Egr-1
and egr-3 are also both implicated in learning and memory [59]. EGR-1 was shown to be induced in specific subregions of the brain during retrieval of fear memories.
Knockout mice further showed that egr-1 was essential
for the transition from short- to long-term plasticity and
for the formation of long-term memories. In T-cells of
the immune system, egr-3 and egr-4 work together with
NF-kappaB to control transcription of genes encoding
inflammatory cytokines. Egr-2 and egr-3 can also inhibit
T cell activation [60]. The egr genes are distantly related
to the Wilm's tumor (WT) gene. The latter, like the distantly related klumpfuss gene in Drosophila, has 4 zinc
fingers rather than 3. The single Daphnia homolog is
seen to be most similar to that in Drosophila (Figure 3).
Disco homologs have 4 to 6 zinc fingers in a paired
arrangement. In humans, Basonuclin 1 and 2 (BNC1 & 2)
correspond to the Disco and Disco-r genes present in flies
(Figure 7). In humans basonuclin is expressed in keratinocytes, germ cells, cornea, and lens epithelia. BNC2
mRNA is abundant in cell types that possess BNC1 but is
also found in tissues that lack BCN1, such as kidney,
intestine, and uterus [61]. In keratinocytes, BNC maintains proliferative capacity and prevents their terminal
differentiation [62]. Recently, it has been suggested that
BNC2 is also involved in mRNA export, nonsense-mediated decay, and/or polyadenylation [61]. Both BNC's activate the expression of rRNA genes. Disconnected (Disco)
and disco-related (Disco-r) are two functionally redundant, neighboring genes localized on the fly X chromosome that may act in combination with the homeotic
genes deformed (dfd) and Sex Combs Reduced (SCR) to
specify gnathal structures in Drosophila [63,64]. The
ancestral Disco gene appears to have undergone independent duplication events in the human and fly lineages.
Daphnia appear to have just one homolog.
C2H2 ZNF homologs duplicated in Daphnia but not
Drosophila

Lineage Specific duplications of well conserved C2H2
ZFP in Daphnia appear to be rare. GPS homologs (GFI/
PAG/Sens) generally have 6 tandem zinc-fingers (Figure
6). The C elegans homolog (PAG3) has only 5 fingers
(missing the first one). The Drosophila homolog (SENS)
has only 4 fingers (missing the first two). The two
Daphnia homologs cluster together and thus appear to be
a recent duplication independent of that producing the
two GFI homologs in humans. One Daphnia homolog

Page 15 of 20

(GPSa) has a unique 5aa insertion between fingers 1 and
2. GPS proteins are involved in hematopoesis and neurogenesis. The hematopoetic functions of vertebrate GFI-1
and GFI-1B (6 fingers) appear to be exchangeable, but
distinct, due to differential cell-type specific expression.
They differ in their ability to facilitate late maturation of
inner ear neurons [65]. While generally known as transcriptional repressors, some act as transcriptional activators and/or conditional repressors (like Sens). The single
worm homolog serves to repress touch neuron gene
expression in interneuron cells [66]. The Drosophila
Senseless gene is required for normal sensory organ
development [67]. The two Daphnia GPS genes are
closely linked on the same scaffold. A domain required
for transcriptional repression, the SNAG domain, is
found only in vertebrate GFI proteins to date; hence no
SNAG domain is seen in the Daphnia homologs [68].
PRDM/Blimp proteins are Putative Positive Regulatory
Domain/B-lymphocyte induced maturation proteins.
These proteins have 5 fingers, but the 5th finger is relatively poorly conserved and has a C2HC structure. A single PRDM1/Blimp gene is found in humans, one in flies,
and one in worms (Figure 6). Blimp1 expression in the
tracheal system of Drosophila embryos was found to be
important for the development of this tissue. Blimp1 is
also induced by ecdysone, and reduced Blimp1 expression results in prepupal lethality [69]. Blimp1 is expressed
in many other tissues of Drosophila. Blimp is similarly
expressed in many different tissues in vertebrates, where
it is known to play important roles in embryogenesis,
germ cell determination, specification in nerve and muscle cells, linage determination in epidermis, and B-cell
maturation [70-72]. There appear to be two Blimp
homologs in Daphnia. However, in one, the 5th finger is
missing, and the third finger has two serines replacing the
two cysteines of the finger. Consequently, the function of
this finger (and the entire protein) may have changed
substantially.
C2H2 ZNF absent from one or more organisms

Zinc finger X-linked duplicated (ZXD) is a newly
described C2H2 zinc finger family in bilaterians present
in most chordates and has undergone duplication specifically in mammals. Among the bilaterians, humans and
other mammals have 3 homologs for this family while
nematodes, water fleas, sea urchins, chicken and frog all
have one homolog including Daphnia (not shown). Interestingly, no homologs have been detected in insect lineage that has a sequenced genome and in C. elegans. Zinc
finger X-linked duplicated family member C (ZXDC)
along with its binding partner ZXDA, forms a complex
that interacts with CIITA and regulates MHC II transcription [73,74]. The function of the other paralog

Seetharam et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:276
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/276

ZXDB as well as the homolog in C. elegans is little understood.
CTCF and CTCFL (Figure 8) have 11 zinc fingers
arranged in tandem. They act in part as "enhancer blockers" in vertebrates by binding to insulator elements. In
flies, dCTCF binds to the Fab-8 insulator element
between iab-7 and iab-8 [75]. Mammalian CTCF's are
also involved in reading gene imprinting marks (i.e. Boris)
at a high fraction of imprinted genes [76]. Recently, CTCF
(along with YY1) has also been implicated in the global
repression mechanism known as X-inactivation [77].
There are two human homologs, CTCF and CTCFL, but
only one in Daphnia and Drosophila, and none in worms.
Yin Yang 1 (YY1) generally has 4 zinc-fingers. Recent
phylogenetic analyses proposed that the YY1 gene has
undergone independent duplication events in different
lineages through retro-transposition. Two duplication
events in placental mammals are believed to have given
rise to the YY1, YY2, and REX1 (Reduced EXpression). A
similar duplication event in flies produced the pleiohomeotic (Pho) and Pho-like genes [78]. The Daphnia Pho
gene clusters with the Drosophila Pho (Figure 8). YY1
acts to activate or repress transcription in different contexts. In mammals, this gene appears to play multiple
roles, including induction and patterning of the embryonic nervous system, differentiation within blood cell lineages, cell-cycle control, cell proliferation, differentiation,
and apoptosis, DNA synthesis and packaging, and Xinactivation [79]. The fly homologs, Pho and phol, are
classified as PcG (poly comb group) proteins that bind to
PREs (PcG response elements that regulate homeotic
genes). Pho and Phol act redundantly to repress homeotic
gene expression in imaginal discs of the fly [80].
Hindsight (Hnt) in Drosophila is a homolog of RasResponsive Element Binding protein 1 (RREB1) in vertebrates. No homolog has been detected in worms, but
Daphnia appears to have a single homolog (Additional
file 1). The number of zinc fingers varies from species to
species: 15 in humans, but only 10 in Daphnia. The Pebbled (peb) gene encodes the Hindsight protein, involved
in morphogenetic processes and is expressed in several
kinds of epithelial cells during development including
extra embryonic amnioserosa, midgut, trachea, and the
photoreceptor cells of the developing adult retina. In the
amnioserosa, Hnt is required for embryonic germ band
retraction and embryonic dorsal closure [81]. In tracheal
development, it is required for the maintenance of epithelial integrity and assembly of apical extracellular structures known as taenidia [82]. During eye development, it
is required for the accumulation of F actin in the apical
tip of photoreceptor precursor cells in the ommatidial
clusters, as well as in the developing rhabdomere during
the pupal period [83]. HNT expression is also essential
for maintaining epithelial integrity for amnioserosa, and

Page 16 of 20

retinal epithelium. Recently HNT has been shown to regulate Notch signaling in follicular epithelial development,
which in turn alters cell differentiation and cell division. It
is responsible for repressing String, Cut, and Hedgehog
signaling, which are essential for regulating follicular cell
proliferation [84]. The human homolog of HNT, RREB1
acts as a transcription factor that binds specifically to the
RAS-responsive elements (RRE) of gene promoters.
Recent investigations indicate that RREB1 is essential for
spreading and migration of MCF-10A breast epithelial
cells [85].
OAZ was apparently duplicated giving rise to two
homologs in many vertebrates, including humans. OAZ is
also called ZF423, while the closely related protein
EHZF1 is called ZF521. No worm homolog has been
detected, but a single homolog exists in Daphnia (Figure
5). Human and mouse homologs for this family have 30
zinc fingers, while Drosophila and Daphnia have fewer.
OAZ/ZNF 423 and EHZF/ZNF521 are implicated in the
control of olfactory epithelium, in B-lymphocyte differentiation, and in signal transduction by bone morphogenic protein (BMP). They are known to activate the
BMP target genes vent-2 (Xenopus) and ventx2 (human)
via interaction with SMAD [86]. ZNF521, in humans is
known to regulate ontogenesis of the hemato-vascular
system through BMP pathways. OAZ/ZNF423 can also
repress BMPs by activating repressors of BMPs [87,88].
OAZ can apparently use different clusters of zinc fingers
to interact with DNA, RNA or Protein [89]. In flies, 21
Zinc fingers are grouped into 4 clusters; the cluster near
the amino terminus is assumed to bind DNA. DmOAZ is
expressed throughout the life of flies and is strongest in
posterior spiracles. Recent studies have shown that OAZ
is involved in controlling posterior structure by regulating specific genes [90].
ZFAM9 is also known as Positive regulatory domain 13
(PRDM13) and is present in most vertebrates. A likely
homolog of this gene is also present in Drosophila and
Daphnia (Figure 8). However, the C. elegans genome had
no homolog for this gene. All orthologs have 4 C2H2 zinc
fingers. The function of these genes is unclear.
MTF (Metal-responsive Transcription Factor) have 6
tandem zinc-fingers. MTF activates metallothionein promoters in metazoans (Figure 3). MTF binds to the metal
responsive element (MRE) and is involved in metal
homeostasis and heavy-metal detoxification [91]. MTF in
Drosophila appears to have a greater role in copper
homeostasis than seen in vertebrates [92]. A single MTF
homolog exists in Daphnia (not shown), but there appear
to be no homologs in worms.
TFIIIA is a DNA-binding transcription factor that also
binds RNA. It is generally required for 5sRNA gene
expression in metazoans. TF3A's are poorly conserved
between distantly related organisms. Vertebrate, insect,

Seetharam et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:276
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/276

fungal, and plant sequences show within group similarity
but only weak between group similarity [93,94]. TFIIIA
usually has 9 zinc-fingers, as does the single homolog in
Daphnia (not shown). In yeast, S. pombe has a 10th zinc
finger following a long spacer, while S. cereviseae has a
long spacer between the 8th and 9th fingers [95]. No
homolog of TFIIIA has yet been identified in worms.
C2H2 ZNF homologs of Drosophila developmental control
genes

Daphnia have single homologs of the following wellknown developmental control genes in Drosophila: Ovo,
CI, LMD, OPA, SCRT, Slug, and ESG. In addition,
Daphnia have three genes similar to the Odd gene family
members Bowl, Bowel, and SOB (Figures S1 and S2).
Although these genes encode C2H2 ZNF, other companion papers from the Daphnia consortium are intended to
cover these in detail (personal communication).

Discussion
Zinc-finger proteins probably represent the largest class
of DNA-binding transcription factors in metazoan organisms, and as such, are likely to play critical roles in determining the extent to which various aspects of form and
function are shared among taxa. The majority of these
proteins are C2H2 zinc-finger proteins, many of which
are already known to affect development and/or differentiation through a more or less direct effect on gene activation and/or repression.
A recent comparison of the full complement of C2H2
zinc-finger protein observed or predicted within worm,
fly, and human genomes has lead to the tentative identification of nearly 40 orthologous groups shared between
humans and invertebrates. From a phylogenetic perspective, the Daphnia genome would be expected to contain
identifiable members for most of these groups. Using the
reciprocal blast hit approach for estimating orthology, we
uncovered 58 genes in Daphnia that appeared to be
members of one of the 40 families conserved in bilaterians (Tables, 2, 3, 4 and 5). At least one member was identified for almost all families; only the JAZ family appeared
to be absent from both Daphnia and C. elegans. All but
two families had 3 or fewer members; only the SP and
KLF families had more than three members each. Only
the Odd-skipped and Snail families had 4 members each,
while GLI, GFI, and Blimp had two members each. For all
other families (33), only a single conserved member was
identified in Daphnia. For 9 of these, a single conserved
member was also present in each of the three other
genomes; hence the latter genes appear to be relatively
resistant to lineage specific deletion or expansion. Only
three of the 40 families (including the most notable example, KLF) exhibited duplication or expansion in Daphnia
relative to flies, but in many cases, gene duplications or

Page 17 of 20

expansions observed in flies and/or humans appeared to
be absent in Daphnia. Thus the Daphnia genome appears
to be relatively efficient with respect to the number of
C2H2 ZNF homologs per family.

Conclusions
Updating a previous analysis of C2H2 ZFP present in the
common ancestor of bilaterians based on a survey of
Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified 58 well conserved C2H2 ZFP
genes in Daphnia that belong to 40 distinct families. The
Daphnia genome appears to be relatively efficient with
respect to these well conserved C2H2 ZFP, since only 7 of
the 40 gene families have more than one identified member. Worms have a comparable number of 6. In flies and
humans, C2H2 ZFP gene expansions are more common,
since these organisms display 15 and 24 multi-member
families respectively. In contrast, only three of the well
conserved C2H2 ZFP families have expanded in Daphnia
relative to Drosophila, and in two of these cases, just one
additional gene was found. The KLF/SP family in
Daphnia, however, is significantly larger than that of
Drosophila, and many of the additional members found
in Daphnia appear to correspond to KLF 1/2/4
homologs, which are absent in Drosophila, but present in
vertebrates.
Methods
Identification of orthologs in D. pulex: Previously identified orthologs [2] that were present in the common
ancestor of the bilaterians Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans were used as a
focus for the present study. Protein sequences from each
of the 3 different species belonging to 39 different classes
of C2H2 zinc finger proteins were collected. Each of these
sequences was used in turn as a query in a BLAST search
against the v1.1 gene model annotations of the draft
genome assembly of D. pulex to detect homologous protein sequences. High-scoring Daphnia sequences were
examined to ensure a good overall match, and then used
in a reciprocal BLAST against Homo sapiens, Drosophila
melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Only those
sequences that detected members of the same family represented by the original query sequence were retained as
putative orthologs for those families. Other known C2H2
zinc finger binding genes were also used to search for any
new families common to these bilaterians.
After the initial reciprocal BLAST approach, to search
for additional gene members for the families, HiddenMarkov model (HMM) searches were conducted using
the HMM profiles obtained from TreeFam for each of
these 39 gene families. Daphnia pulex protein predictions
containing all models were used to search with HMM
profiles using HMMER 3.0 search. Only domains with an

Seetharam et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:276
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/276

E-value < 0.1 were accepted, and any identified zinc finger gene was further manually inspected for their family
characteristics. BLAST search was performed against the
non redundant protein dataset at NCBI to confirm its
family association. Only genes that appeared to be substantially complete and those that had approximately the
same number of zinc fingers as other members of the
proposed family were considered to be unambiguous
members of that family. This approach identified additional homologs of Odd-skipped and Snail families and
validated all the genes that were identified with reciprocal
BLAST approach.
Alignments and phylogenetic analyses: Daphnia pulex
homologs identified as above were combined with their
respective family members from the other three bilaterians (Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and
Caenorhabditis elegans; see Tables, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and used
to create family-specific and/or multiple family alignments using the Muscle program (version 3.6) with 16
iterations and a standard Clustalw weighting scheme (gap
opening extension, [96] closing and separation penalty of
10, 0.2, 4 and 1 respectively). The obtained alignment was
then trimmed and converted to suitable format using trimAI (version 1.2)[97]. Phylogenetic trees were generated
using Bayesian inference (MrBayes; version 3.1.2)[98]
using WAG amino acid substitution matrix[99], empirically estimated amino acid frequencies plus gamma distribution of eight categories (WAG+F+Î8). Successive
runs were executed for a fixed number of generations
with a sampling frequency of 100 and a burn-in parameter of 200. Runs were extended in each case until a convergence value of less than 0.03 was achieved. Since the
multi-family trees each contained only an exclusive subset of the 40 total C2H2 zinc-finger families, internal
branch patterns and statistics could be misleading with
respect to the degree of relatedness between families.
Hence, internal branches indicating a specific relationship between specific families within multi-family trees
were collapsed into polytomies for presentation.
