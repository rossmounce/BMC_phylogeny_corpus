Abstract
Background: A large and unsuspected tuberculosis outbreak involving 18.7% of the total of the
tuberculosis cases studied, was detected in a population-based molecular epidemiological study
performed in Zaragoza (Spain) from 2001 to 2004.
Methods: The Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug-susceptible strain, named MTZ strain, was
genetically characterized by IS6110-RFLP, Spoligotyping and by MIRU-VNTR typing and the genetic
patterns obtained were compared with those included in international databases. The
characteristics of the affected patients, in an attempt to understand why the MTZ strain was so
highly transmitted among the population were also analyzed.
Results: The genetic profile of the MTZ strain was rare and not widely distributed in our area or
elsewhere. The patients affected did not show any notable risk factor for TB.
Conclusion: The M. tuberculosis strain MTZ, might have particular transmissibility or virulence
properties, and we believe that greater focus should be placed on stopping its widespread
dissemination.

Background
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an extremely successful pathogen that kills nearly two million people in the world
each year [1]. The study of tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology and transmission, traditionally involving patient contact tracing, has been improved by the use of molecular
strain typing [2]. Molecular epidemiological studies have
added much-needed accuracy and precision to the study
of transmission dynamics, and have allowed previously
unresolved issues to be newly addressed, e.g. the classification of recent-versus-reactive disease, the extent of exogenous reinfection and the detection of unsuspected
transmission events [2].
Advances in molecular typing have led to the identification of highly transmissible M. tuberculosis complex
strains in the last years. In New York City, the W strain
caused more than 350 cases [3] and spread to other American states [4]. A Beijing strain imported from Liberia
affected 75 patients in the Gran Canaria Island during the
1990s [5]. Currently, the major threat for TB control is the
transmission of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains
[6,7]. However other strains, neither belonging to the WBeijing family nor being drug-resistant, have shown extensive dissemination in various countries: the C strain in
New York City [8,9], the CH strain in the UK [10,11], the
Harlingen strain in the Netherlands [12,13] and the Danish Cluster 1 and 2 strains in Denmark [14].
In Zaragoza (Spain), an unsuspected, extensive transmission of a drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis strain was
detected during a population-based molecular epidemiological survey from 2001 to 2004 [15]. In this study, 454
M. tuberculosis isolates were analyzed by IS6110-RFLP, and
52.6% were clustered. The largest cluster contained 85 isolates (18.7%); the strain causing this cluster was named
MTZ, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Zaragoza.
The reasons for the dominance and widespread of the
MTZ strain were unclear. The objectives of the present
work were: i) to characterize the MTZ isolates by other
genotyping techniques such as Spoligotyping and MIRUVNTR typing, and include it in a Principal Genotype
Group (PGG) ii) to compare the genetic patterns obtained
with those included in international databases and iii) to
analyze the characteristics of the affected patients, in an
attempt to understand why the MTZ strain was so highly
transmitted among the population.

lates were grouped into 45 clusters, each cluster
containing between two and 85 isolates [15].
DNA fingerprinting
IS6110-RFLP
RFLP analysis of the 85 isolates by Southern blotting and
DNA hybridization with IS6110 was performed in the previous study according to the standard fingerprinting
method [16]. The RFLP pattern was entered into the Spanish Database of the University of Zaragoza. This database
includes 5,694 IS6110-RFLP entries from drug-susceptible
and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis complex isolates, 4,637
(81%) of which are from Spanish isolates. The MTZ RFLP
pattern was compared with the other database entries.
Spoligotyping
Spoligotyping was performed according to the method
described by Kamerbeek et al. [17]. The spoligotype
obtained was contrasted with entries contained in the
SpolDB4
database
[18]http://www.pasteur-guade
loupe.fr/tb/spoldb4/spoldb4.pdf and was further compared with the updated SITVIT2 database. SITVIT2 is a
proprietary database maintained at the Pasteur Institute of
Guadeloupe, which contains both spoligotype and MIRUVNTR patterns of the M. tuberculosis. At the time of this
comparison (30th October 2008), it contained data on
about 70,000 strains from 160 countries of origin.
MIRU-VNTR
The 85 isolates were genotyped by PCR amplification of a
highly discriminatory subset of 15 loci proposed by Supply et al. [19]. Analyses were performed using five multiplex PCRs (Table 1), PCR mixtures and conditions were as
described in reference 19 with some modifications. PCR
products were separated on a 48-capillary MegaBACE™
500 Sequencer (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using Roxlabeled MegaBACE ET900-R as a size standard. PCR fragments sizes were determined using the MegaBACE™ Fragment Profiler v1.2 software (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
VNTR alleles were assigned according to size offsets,
which correct the differences in relative migration
between the size standard and the amplicons. Agarose gel
electrophoresis with PCR products of known size were
used to define size offsets.

Two MTZ isolates were also genotyped by PCR amplification of the 12 "old" loci initially described [20], six of
which were also present in the 15 MIRU-VNTR panel and
compared with the updated SITVIT2 database.

Methods
The MTZ cluster was identified in a population-based
study conducted in the province of Zaragoza between 1st
June 2001 and 31st May 2004. A total of 454 M. tuberculosis complex isolates were typed by IS6110-RFLP: 239 iso-

The 21 loci analysed were sent to be compared to a web
server, MIRU-VNTRplus [21], that includes a collection of
186 strains representing the major MTBC lineages. For 15
different MIRU-VNTR it was also possible the comparison

DNA sequencing.

Assignation of the MTZ strain to one of the three principal
genotypic groups
M. tuberculosis MTZ strain was assigned to one of the three
PGG delineated by Sreevatsan et al. [22]. Polymorphism
at codon 463 of the katG gene was evaluated by PCR
amplification of a 620 bp portion of the gene with the forward primer katG904 (5'-AGCTCGTATGGCACCGGAAC)
and the reverse primer katG1523 (5'-TTGACCTCCCACCCGACTTG) [23], followed by digestion with MspI. In the
presence of the CGG variant of codon 463, a MspI recognition site is formed, and the two alleles are easily differentiated by their restriction patterns.

Information and statistical analysis of the patients
Medical and laboratory records of the patients were retrospectively and thoroughly reviewed. The primary routine
contact investigation reports of the TB surveillance system
in Zaragoza were also collected. The information included
demographic data (age, sex, country of origin, place of residence), microbiological data (date of isolation and drug
sensitivity), clinical data (site of disease), risk factors for
TB (homelessness, injection drug use, alcohol and/or
tobacco abuse, presence of HIV infection and history of
previous imprisonment), and other information about
possible epidemiological links.

Polymorphism at codon 95 of the gyrA gene was detected
by PCR amplification of a 320 bp fragment using the
primers gyrA1 (5'-CAGCTACATCGACTATGCGA) and

The characteristics of the 85 patients in the MTZ cluster
were compared with the other 369 TB patients studied in
2001–2004 [15]. We used the chi-square test (Yates-corrected) or Fisher's exact test to compare categorical data.

The Mann-Whitney non-parametric test was used to compare the distribution of age as a continuous variable. The
SPSS program for Windows (version 11.5; SPSS Inc, Chicago Il) was used for statistical analyses.

Results and discussion
DNA fingerprinting
The 85 isolates of the MTZ cluster all showed the same
IS6110-RFLP pattern, Spoligotype pattern and MIRUVNTR pattern. The genetic profiles are shown in Figure 1.
RFLP detected ten copies of IS6110 in the MTZ strain; this
pattern was previously identified in only two patients
from Zaragoza in 1993 and 1995 [25,26] and did not
match any other profiles included in the database of the
University of Zaragoza. Thus it is likely that this strain
spread recently and was not endemic in our region during
the nineties.

M. tuberculosis MTZ strain was assigned to one of the three
PGG (22) trying to provide a better framework for phylogenetic of this M. tuberculosis strain. The SNPs in codon
KatG463 (CGG) and codon gyrA95 (AGC) revealed that
the MTZ strain belonged to the principal genetic group 3.
The MTZ spoligotyping profile did not belong to any of
the predominant spoligotype families from Spain, Europe
or any other region of the world and did not match highly
transmissible profiles like the W-Beijing [18]. The spoligotyping profile corresponded to the SIT number 773 in the

SpolDB4 database (octal number 777777760000031),
with no related genetic family identified and only five isolates reported (four from New York City, USA, and one
from Jakarta, Indonesia) [18]. Further comparison with
the updated database did not show any new additions
since the last 5 strains described in SpolDB4. The search
for 12-loci MIRU pattern 223425153322 showed that it
belonged to a widely reported shared-type MIT157 in the
updated SITVIT2 database; it was shared by a total of 61
strains from 9 different settings: Croatia (20/61 or 33%),
Belgium (16/61 or 26%), Great Britain (11/61 or 18%),
Spain (3/61 or 5%), French overseas departments of the
Americas (Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana; 5/61
or 8%), Sweden (2/61 or 3%), South Africa (2/61 or 3%),
USA (1/61 or 1.5%), and Italy (1/61 or 1.5%). Spoligotypes were available for only 31/61 strains sharing
MIT157, with the following distribution of the genotypic
lineages: T lineage (25/31 or 80%), Haarlem (4/31 or
13%), LAM (1/31 or 3%), and Beijing (1/31 or 3%). The
signature of the SIT773 contained a very unusual absence
of spacers 37 to 40, which does not denote any known lineage-specific signature in SpolDB4 or SITVIT2 databases.
The overall pattern of SIT773 has a resemblance to the
"Zero copy" lineage described previously (18), nonetheless, the fact that MIRU24 value is equal to "1" together
with the assignation at the group 3 of the PGG, suggest
that the MTZ strain might be an evolutionary "modern"
strain of tubercle bacilli. Further investigations using SNPs
and 24-loci MIRU-VNTR would be necessary to determine
the exact phylogeographical specificity of the strains containing this SIT773 pattern.
The comparison to MIRU-VNTRplus web server http://
www.miru-vntrplus.org/ (21), and with MLVA database
in http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr/MLVAnet/, did not
report any new information.
The molecular typing of the 85 isolates by Spoligotyping
and MIRU-VNTR typing was also useful to confirm the
composition of the large MTZ cluster initially identified
by IS6110-RFLP.M. tuberculosis isolates from epidemiologically linked patients generally show identical IS6110RFLP patterns; however, IS6110-based RFLP fingerprints
are not always reliable indicators of epidemiological linkage [27-29], and MIRU-VNTR typing can subdivide
IS6110-RFLP clusters with no epidemiological connections [19,30]. The epidemiological information on the
MTZ cases was limited, because the molecular typing was
retrospective and subsequent to the contact tracing and
the patients were not re-interviewed. Despite the absence
of epidemiological links (only small groups of patients,
constituting a total of 26 patients altogether, were clearly
linked) (Table 2), the MIRU typing did not separate the
cluster of 85 isolates, suggesting that all the patients studied could be connected.

Characteristics and epidemiological investigation of the
patients
Sixty (70.6%) of the 85 cases of the MTZ cluster were men
and 25 (29.4%) were women. The median age of the
patients was 30 years (25th percentile [P25] to P75, 23 to
41) with a range of 8 months to 68 years. Seventy-three
(86%) patients were born in Spain; 12 (14%) were foreign-born. All patients presented with a drug-susceptible
isolate, except one patient with history of relapse and
non-adherence to the TB treatment, who presented a
rifampicin-resistant isolate.

We compared the characteristics of the MTZ-infected
patients with the rest of clustered patients from the previous study (154 cases) and with total patients studied
(clustered and non-clustered, 369 cases). The median age
of MTZ-infected patients was lower (30 years) than that of

other clustered patients (median age 38 years; P25 to P75,
29 to 46) or than that of all patients (median age 40 years;
P25 to P75, 30 to 62) (P < 0.001 in both comparisons).
Almost all (94.1%) of the MTZ-infected patients lived in
Zaragoza city; the corresponding values were 81.5% for
other clustered patients (P = 0.012) and 76.1% for all
patients (P < 0.001). The MTZ-infected patients were less
likely to be injection drug users (9.9%) than other clustered patients (22.9%) (P = 0.024), and presented more
frequently with pulmonary TB than all other patients
(95.3% vs. 85.1%; P = 0.019). In many TB outbreaks, the
patients share a common risk factor for TB such as homelessness, HIV infection, injection drug abuse or alcohol
abuse [5-9,31]. However, in our study, MTZ cluster
patients do not appear to be linked by any common characteristic or risk factors for TB. Other European studies
have reported the dissemination of TB strains among low-

Location
Location of 78 cases of the MTZ cluster in Zaragoza City according to the place of residence. The cases grouped
inside a circle lived in the same street, or in parallel, adjoining or perpendicular streets. The areas that included two or more
cases are numbered from 1 to 18.

risk individuals, such as the Harlingen strain in the Netherlands or the Danish cluster 2 strain in Denmark [12-14].
A number of epidemiological links could be established
from the data available from patient medical records and
contact investigation reports. Eight children (all between
one and two years old) and one nursery staff were linked
because they attended the same nursery [32]. Familial
links were identified involving 15 household contacts in
seven different families and a friendship link between two
other patients. Patient characteristics are detailed in Table
2.
A significant data was the proportion of patients linked by
place of residence. The study area included the province of

Zaragoza [15], which is composed of both urban and rural
areas, but 94.1% of the MTZ-infected patients lived in
Zaragoza city. Thirty-nine patients were linked into
groups of two or three individuals because they lived in
the same street, or in parallel, adjoining or perpendicular
streets (Table 3). Seventy-eight cases of the MTZ cluster
were situated in the city of Zaragoza, and 21 (25%) of
these were concentrated in the old town centre (Figure 2).
The other seven patients lived in peripheral districts or in
rural areas. Other studies have demonstrated that patients
whose residences are geographically aggregated may be
clustered [33] and therefore, the location of TB exposure
is an important factor to consider in addition to the contact tracing [9,34,35]. TB transmission between sporadic
or casual contacts has been documented [29,31]; hypoPage 6 of 10

a The

areas of residence are shown in figure 2. The dash (-) means that the patients did not live in any of the 18 areas of residence (see figure 2). b
Patients were classified as "neighbours" when they lived in the same street.
ID n°: patient identification number. IDU: injection drug user.

thetically, the transmission of the MTZ strain could have
occurred casually in public settings, probably near to the
residences of patients.
In one of the small outbreaks caused by MTZ strain registered among children attending at a nursery, 11.7%
showed a positive skin test and 90.9% of them developed
the illness [32]. However, the percentage of infected children was surprisingly low in view of the dissemination of
this strain among the total population in Zaragoza. Like
strains involved in other outbreaks, the MTZ strain might
have unique characteristics for virulence and/or transmissibility [36-39]. The transmission of tuberculosis may
have been due to the increased virulence of the strain
rather than to environmental factors or patient characteristics.
Another possible explanation for the extensive spread of
the MTZ strain could be that this strain was endemic in
our region, but in a previous molecular study performed
in the same area between 1993 and 1995 [25,26], MTZ
was only isolated from two Spanish patients who were not
apparently connected; one in 1993 and one in 1995. The
first patient was an 11 year-old girl living in a rural area,
and the second was a 22 year-old woman living in the old
town centre in Zaragoza. Surprisingly, both patients presented with rare extra-pulmonary locations of TB (bone
TB and intestinal TB respectively), whereas 95.3% of the
cases reported from 2001 to 2004 presented with pulmonary TB. The period from 1995 to 2001 has not been studied, and it seems likely that more MTZ cases would be
identified during this period. A more detailed epidemiological investigation of the outbreak is needed to elucidate
the chain of transmission.

Conclusion
In conclusion, neither the genetic profiles exhibited by the
MTZ strain nor the characteristics of the patients affected
could explain the reasons for the dominance and widespread of this modern strain. The MTZ strain might have
particular transmissibility or virulence properties that
need to be studied, and we believe that greater focus
should be placed on stopping its widespread dissemination. Molecular typing has been a decisive tool to detect

this unsuspected TB outbreak, and demonstrates the
importance of the combination of both traditional
approaches and molecular epidemiology for TB surveillance.
