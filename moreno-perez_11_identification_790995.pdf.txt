Abstract
Background: Plasmodium vivax malaria remains a major health problem in tropical and sub-tropical regions
worldwide. Several rhoptry proteins which are important for interaction with and/or invasion of red blood cells,
such as PfRONs, Pf92, Pf38, Pf12 and Pf34, have been described during the last few years and are being considered
as potential anti-malarial vaccine candidates. This study describes the identification and characterization of the P.
vivax rhoptry neck protein 1 (PvRON1) and examine its antigenicity in natural P. vivax infections.
Methods: The PvRON1 encoding gene, which is homologous to that encoding the P. falciparum apical sushi
protein (ASP) according to the plasmoDB database, was selected as our study target. The pvron1 gene transcription
was evaluated by RT-PCR using RNA obtained from the P. vivax VCG-1 strain. Two peptides derived from the
deduced P. vivax Sal-I PvRON1 sequence were synthesized and inoculated in rabbits for obtaining anti-PvRON1
antibodies which were used to confirm the protein expression in VCG-1 strain schizonts along with its association
with detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs) by Western blot, and its localization by immunofluorescence assays.
The antigenicity of the PvRON1 protein was assessed using human sera from individuals previously exposed to P.
vivax malaria by ELISA.
Results: In the P. vivax VCG-1 strain, RON1 is a 764 amino acid-long protein. In silico analysis has revealed that
PvRON1 shares essential characteristics with different antigens involved in invasion, such as the presence of a
secretory signal, a GPI-anchor sequence and a putative sushi domain. The PvRON1 protein is expressed in parasite’s
schizont stage, localized in rhoptry necks and it is associated with DRMs. Recombinant protein recognition by
human sera indicates that this antigen can trigger an immune response during a natural infection with P. vivax.
Conclusions: This study shows the identification and characterization of the P. vivax rhoptry neck protein 1 in the
VCG-1 strain. Taking into account that PvRON1 shares several important characteristics with other Plasmodium
antigens that play a functional role during RBC invasion and, as shown here, it is antigenic, it could be considered
as a good vaccine candidate. Further studies aimed at assessing its immunogenicity and protection-inducing ability
in the Aotus monkey model are thus recommended.

Malaria remains one of the prevailing health problems
worldwide. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO) [1], nearly 225 million people are infected
annually; about 785,000 of them die as a direct

consequence of this disease, of which 85% are children
aged less than five years. Although malaria in humans is
caused by Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax,
Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi, the first two species represent about 90%
of the clinical cases reported [2]. P. falciparum is
responsible for causing the disease’s highest mortality
rates while P. vivax represents significant morbidity having socioeconomic implications [3]. In spite of

international control strategies and policies having been
implemented during the last fifty years, mortality figures
are still alarming; therefore, developing an efficient vaccine to combat this imminent threat has become an
urgent need.
Invasion of red blood cells (RBC) by Plasmodium
parasites involves highly coordinated events which are
directed by a set of proteins secreted from the apical
organelles (rhoptries and micronemes) [4]. It has been
shown that several rhoptry proteins, such as PfRON2,
-4, and the PfAMA-1 antigen (secreted by micronemes),
are involved in tight junction formation between the
parasite and its target cell [5-7]; it has also been found
that some others (such as PfRON1, Pf92, Pf38, Pf12 and
Pf34) are associated with detergent-resistant membrane
microdomains (DRM) through glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor sequences [8], which are considered
organizing centers for the assembly of molecules implicated in cell signaling [9,10]. To date, several of these
DRM proteins have been shown to play an active role in
host cell interaction and to trigger antibody responses in
the host [11-15].
Rhoptry neck protein 1 (RON1), initially described in
Toxoplasma gondii (TgRON1) [16], has been a particularly interesting protein. It is a highly-conserved antigen
amongst Apicomplexa members. Different tgron1 homologous genes have also been found in members of the
Plasmodium genus, such as P. falciparum [16,17].
PfRON1 is also known as the apical sushi protein (ASP),
exhibiting a prominent transcriptional peak towards the
end of the intraerythrocyte lifecycle [17]. This protein
has 731 amino acids encoded by 4 exons and ~85.46
kDa molecular mass. It has been previously demonstrated that PfASP undergoes proteolytic processing,
resulting in ~50 kDa and ~30 kDa polypeptides [18].
The protein also contains a signal peptide, a GPI-anchor
sequence and a complement control protein (CCP) or
sushi-like conserved domain [19]; this domain typically
contains ~60 residues and represents a protein module
involved in protein-protein interactions and/or cell
adhesion, containing 4 cysteines, proline residues and
highly conserved acidic amino acids (aspartic and glutamic acid). Furthermore, it has been recently found that
PfRON1 has 4 high activity binding peptide sequences
(HABPs) to erythrocytes (manuscript in preparation),
and could thus be important for parasite entry to target
cells.
In the search for an effective anti-malarial vaccine several studies have been focused on identifying antigens
expressed during the parasite’s asexual stage due to the
fact that some of these antigens are mainly responsible
for invasion of RBC [20,21]. Several proteins included in
developing a promising vaccine against P. falciparum
have been functionally characterized to date [21].

However, studies carried out with P. vivax have been
limited due to the difficulty in maintaining an in vitro
continuous parasite culture. Taking this into account
and considering the degree of conservation observed
between the genetic content of different Plasmodium
species [23,24], some bioinformatics tools have been
used for homology searches of the complete P. vivax
genome for antigens already described in P. falciparum.
To date, a considerable number of surface [25-28] and
rhoptry proteins [22,29-35] have been experimentally
identified and characterized in P. vivax using both its
genome [21] and intraerythrocyte lifecycle transcriptome
[36] as well as an Aotus-adapted strain [37]. These proteins belong to a list of antigens, which are being tested
as vaccine candidates in the Aotus monkey model.
This study shows the identification and characterization of the PvRON1 protein which is homologous to
PfASP. Different aspects such as PvRON1 transcription
and expression at the end of the intraerythrocyte life
cycle, the subcellular localization pattern and the ability
to trigger an immune response in patients who have
presented active episodes of P. vivax malarial infection
have been determined by molecular biology and immunochemistry techniques.

Methods
Bioinformatics analysis

The P. vivax ron1 gene sequence (which is homologous
to the PfASP encoding gene) was obtained from the
plasmoDB database [38]; likewise, pfasp orthologous
genes in other malarial species were searched. Identity
and similarity values between P. falciparum - P. vivax
and P. vivax - P. knowlesi hypothetical protein products
were determined using ClustalW software [39]. The presence of a signal peptide, repeat sequences and a GPIanchor sequence was determined by SignalP 3.0 [40],
XSTREAM repeat [41] and GPI-anchor [42] bioinformatics tools, respectively. Putative domains were
assessed using the Interpro database [43]. Antheprot
software [44] was used for determining two peptides
throughout the PvRON1 hypothetical sequence (PlasmoDB accession number: PVX_000945) that could be
good B-cell epitopes, taking the highest average hydrophilicity (>4.9), solvent accessibility (>162) and Parker’s
antigenicity (>37.8) values into account (calculated in a
20 residue sliding window), according to previously
established parameters [45-47].
Animal handling

The experimental handling of animals used here was
carried out in accordance with Colombian Law 84/1989
and resolution 504/1996. Aotus monkeys kept at FIDIC’s
primate station (Leticia, Amazon) and New Zealand rabbits provided by the Instituto Nacional de Salud

Moreno-Perez et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:314
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/314

(Bogotá, Colombia) were handled following the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals
(National Institute of Health, USA) under the constant
supervision of a veterinarian. Immunization and bleeding procedures for Aotus monkeys had been previously
approved by our institute’s ethics committee, and were
carried out in agreement with the conditions stipulated
by CorpoAmazonia (resolution 00066, September
13th2006). A monkey from the Aotus genus was experimentally infected with the VCG-1 strain (Vivax Colombia Guaviare 1) and subjected to daily monitoring to
assess the progress of infection throughout the whole
study (up to day 18) using acridine orange staining. The
monkey was treated with pediatric doses of chloroquine
(10 mg/kg on the first day and 7.5 mg/kg/day until the
fifth day) and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg/day from the
third to the fifth day) at the end of the study to guarantee total blood parasite clearance. Once experiments
were over, CorpoAmazonia officers supervised the primate’s return to its natural habitat in excellent health
conditions.
Isolating the P. vivax parasite

The VCG-1 strain was obtained according to a previously described methodology [37]. Mature forms of
the parasite, mainly schizonts, were purified from a
blood sample (3 mL) infected with P. vivax using a Percoll discontinuous gradient (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden), according to a previously established protocol
[48]. This schizont-enriched sample was then used for
performing all of the following procedures: RNA, genomic DNA or parasite total protein extraction, as well as
indirect immunofluorescence assays.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA from the schizont-enriched sample was
extracted using the Trizol method and treated with
RNase-free RQ1 DNase (Promega, Wisconsin, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 5 μL RNA
were used to synthesize cDNA by RT-PCR, using the
SuperScript III enzyme (Invitrogen, California, USA).
Complementary DNA synthesis was carried out in the
following conditions: 65°C for 5 mins, 50°C for 1 hour
and 70°C for 15 mins. After a 15-min incubation period
with RNase (Promega, USA) at 37°C, the product was
stored at -20°C until its use.

Forward 5’-ATGCTGCTAGTGCCACCCG-3’, Reverse
5’- CTGAACACCATCGAAATCG -3’). After PCR
amplification using the Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase
enzyme (Invitrogen, California, USA), each product was
purified by Wizard PCR preps kit (Promega), ligated to
the pEXP5 CT/TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and cloned in
Escherichia coli TOP10 bacteria (Invitrogen), following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Recombinant DNA was
purified using an UltraClean mini plasmid prep purification kit (MO BIO laboratories, California, USA) and
each sequence’s integrity was confirmed by sequencing
two clones obtained from independent PCRs, using the
automated genetic analyzer ABI PRISM 310 (PE Applied
Biosystems, California, USA).
Peptide synthesis and polyclonal antibody production

Two 20-amino-acid-long peptides designed on the
PvRON1 deduced sequence (Sal-1 strain) (CG-KHKEGGAAKRHKKEPHEQRG-GC
and
CG-EDASVADKDGQPGERGQDGQ-GC) were synthesized
according to a previously established methodology [49],
polymerized, lyophilized and characterized by RP-HPLC
and MALDI-TOF MS. Afterwards, a 150 μg dose of a
mixture from both synthetic peptides, emulsified in
Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA) (Sigma, Missouri,
USA), was inoculated into New Zealand rabbits on day
0, while the same mixture emulsified in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (FIA) was inoculated on days 21 and 42.
Sera were collected before the first immunization (preimmune sera) and 20 days after the last booster dose
(post III sera). Rabbit sera were absorbed with E. coli
proteins coupled to a Sepharose column and then stored
at -20°C until use, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire,
UK).
Parasite protein extraction

A parasite pellet was treated with 0.2% saponin, then
washed six times with PBS and homogenized in lysis
buffer (5% SDS, 10 mM PMSF, 10 mM iodoacetamide,
1 mM EDTA). The total lysate was quantified by using
a micro BCA protein assay kit (Thermo scientific) and
resolved in SDS-PAGE in reducing and non-reducing
conditions. Immunoblot detection was carried out using
sera from rabbits previously immunized with synthetic
peptides.

Cloning and sequencing

Isolating detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs)

Three specific primer sets were designed to cover the
whole gene sequence and produce two smaller-sized
recombinant fragments (Forward 5’-ACAGAAGAGAAGAGAACAGA-3’, Reverse 5’-GTTCACACATGCGGTCAC-3’; Forward 5’- ATGGCGAAGGAGCCCAAGTG
-3’, Reverse 5’- ATCCCTAGCAATGCTTCG -3’;

Parasite mature forms extracted by the Percoll method
were treated with 0.2% saponin in PBS for 5 minutes.
After six washes in PBS, the pellet was suspended in a
200 μL TNET solution (1% Triton X-100, 25 mM TrisHCl, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA) which contained
protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 1 mM iodoacetamide,

Moreno-Perez et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:314
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/314

1 mM EDTA and 1 mg/mL leupeptin). The sample was
poured into two aliquots which were then treated in the
following conditions: a 100 μL aliquot was incubated at
4°C for 30 minutes and subsequently centrifuged at
7,550 rpm for 10 minutes; the remaining sample was
kept at 37°C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged in the
same conditions described above. The supernatant was
recovered in a new Eppendorf tube and the remaining
pellet from each assay was suspended in lysis buffer (5%
SDS, 10 mM PMSF, 10 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM
EDTA). Each fraction was quantified by Micro BCA
protein assay kit (Thermo scientific) and resolved in
12% SDS-PAGE.
Expression and purification of recombinant protein
fragments

Once the sequence from cloned inserts had been confirmed, these were transformed in the E. coli BL21-AI
strain (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. In brief, cells were grown overnight
at 37°C and then inoculated in Terrific broth medium
supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL ampicillin and 0.1% (w/
v) D-glucose. Once the cells had reached their stationary
phase (0.6 OD600), 0.2% L-arabinose (w/v) was added as
inductor and these were incubated again in the same
conditions described above for 4 hours. The culture was
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 minutes and the pellet
was suspended in extraction buffer (6 M Urea, 12 mM
imidazole, 10 mM Tris-Cl, 100 mM NaH2PO4 and 10
mg/mL lysozyme) supplemented with protease inhibitors
(1 mM PMSF, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA and
1 mg/mL leupeptin) and lysed by sonication. rPvRON1a and rPvRON1-c recombinant fragment expression was
assessed on 12% SDS-PAGE. pEXP5 CT/TOPO vector
was used to facilitate purification and recognition by
monoclonal anti-histidine antibodies. This vector adds a
six-histidine tag towards the C-terminus of each fragment, which is used for purifying the recombinant protein by affinity chromatography using a Ni+2-NTA resin
(Qiagen, California, USA). Briefly, the extraction buffer
described above was used to elute the non-retained proteins and then the same buffer plus 500 mM imidazole
was used to elute the recombinant protein. All individually collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
Western blot. Pure fractions were dialyzed in PBS pH
7.0. The protein was ultrafiltered and concentrated
using an Amicon filtration system (LabX scientific marketplace, Midland Canada) and quantified with a micro
BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
SDS-PAGE and Western blot

5 μg of each recombinant and 50 μg of both parasite
total lysate and the fractions obtained in DRMs were

Page 4 of 10

separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These membranes were blocked
with 5% skimmed milk in 0.05% PBS-Tween for one
hour. After three washes with 0.05% PBS-Tween, each
membrane was cut into strips which were individually
analyzed as follows: strips with recombinant protein
were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in 5%
skimmed milk in 0.05% PBS-Tween, including a 1:100
dilution of rabbit (pre-immune and post-III) or human
sera. Strips with parasite total lysate and those containing DRM fractions were incubated for 1 hour at room
temperature in 5% skimmed milk in 0.05% PBS-Tween,
including a 1:100 dilution of anti-PvRON1 antibodies.
After 3 washes, strips were incubated for 1 hour with
goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to phosphatase as secondary antibody in a 1:4,500 dilution at room temperature,
or goat anti-human IgG in a 1:5,000 dilution. Western
blot for recombinant proteins was carried out as follows:
a nitrocellulose strip was used as positive control; this
strip was incubated with a peroxidase-coupled monoclonal anti-histidine antibody diluted 1:4,500 in skimmed
milk plus 0.05% PBS-Tween. Blots were revealed with a
substrate peroxidase VIP kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Canada) or BCIP/NBT color development substrate kits (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

Blood smears from the Aotus monkey infected with P.
vivax were fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde. Slides
were washed thrice with PBS and blocked at 37°C for 45
minutes using a 1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)
solution in PBS. After 3 washes, slides were incubated at
37°C for 1 hour with a mixture of anti-PvRON1 rabbit
sera in 1:30 dilution and anti-PvRhopH3 mice sera (previously obtained in our institute [30]) in 1:40 dilution,
suspended in PBS -1% BSA - 0.1% Triton X-100 solution. After three washes, plates were incubated with
FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) and
Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Millipore) in
previously described conditions. Slides were stained with
DAPI (2 μg/mL) for 20 minutes at room temperature
and then observed under an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope, using 100× oil immersion objective.

Results and Discussion
Pvron1 gene identification and localization in a syntenic
chromosome region

The initial P. vivax ron1 gene sequence selected for this
study was found in the plasmoDB database (Accession
number PVX_000945). According to the information

Moreno-Perez et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:314
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/314

found there, the ron1 gene seemed to be ubiquitous
within the Plasmodium genus, since orthologous genes
were found in the Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium
knowlesi and Plasmodium berghei genomes. Additionally, the database showed that open reading frame
(ORF) orientation and exon-intron structure were highly
conserved among the genes encoding the hypothetical
protein products in these parasite species. Such genome
organization was consistent with the identity (Id) and
similarity (S) values obtained when P. falciparum - P.
vivax and P. vivax - P. knowlesi contigs were analyzed
(Figure 1). It is worth noting that the high degree of S
observed between P. vivax - P. knowlesi was in agreement with the evolutionary proximity found in a previous phylogenetic analysis of conserved regions from
the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) encoding gene [50]
and in a comparative genomics study of P. vivax [23]
which showed that these organisms share similar chromosomal regions. Interestingly, the Id value found
between the alignment of ORFs encoded by pfasp
(PFD0295c) and pvron1 (PVX_000945) genes was similar to the Id values found in antigens considered good
candidates for designing an effective vaccine against P.
vivax malaria [22,28,29], suggesting that PvRON1 should
be an interesting candidate for immunological trials.
PvRON1 characterization in silico

The pvron1 gene from SAL-1 strain has 2,801 bp; it
encodes to a 772 amino acid-long protein (~84.5 kDa
estimated molecular weight). This protein is 41 residues
longer compared to PfASP (731 aa) [18]. PvRON1 presents two hydrophobic regions in the N and C-terminus
matching a secretory signal sequence composed by the
first 21 amino acids and another located between amino
acids 743 to 764 (Figure 2A). This latter feature plus the
result of the GPI-anchor predictor, point out to the Cterminal anchoring of this protein by GPI. In addition, a
sushi-like domain (also known as complement control

Page 5 of 10

protein (CCP) module) was predicted; this domain consists of 56 amino acids, four corresponding to cysteines
(Cys) which intervene in the domain’s structural conformation to mediate protein-protein binding and/or cell
adhesion [19].
XSTREAM analysis revealed a tandem repeat (TR)
between amino acids 148 to 171 (Figure 2A). According
to the alignment performed with other homologous proteins in Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P. knowlesi
and P. chabaudi) this region has been shown to be
exclusive for P. vivax (Figure 2B). The TR consists of
four blocks of eight amino acids having the EKLPIGGG
consensus sequence. Antheprot software prediction has
shown that this could be a good B-cell lineal epitope.
Another two blocks having a similar sequence to that of
the TR were found between amino acids 133 to 147;
these sequences showed substitutions or deletions of
some residues, suggesting that this region might be
under selective pressure. It has been previously
described that the polymorphic repeat sequences found
in some P. falciparum malarial antigens, such as the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) and the S-antigen, can
affect antibody affinity maturation and mask critical epitopes involved in invasion from being recognized
[51-54]; the present analysis has thus led us to suggesting that the TR regions found in PvRON1 could be part
of a mechanism used by the parasite to evade the host’s
humoral immune response. However, further experimental evidence is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
The pvron1 gene is transcribed during the blood stage

The presence of ron1 gene transcripts in the P. vivax
VCG-1 strain was assessed by PCR, using cDNA as template. Figure 2C shows the amplification products
obtained from RT-PCR and genomic DNA, indicating
that the pvron1 gene is transcribed in schizont-enriched
samples. These results agreed with previously reported

genes within P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi chromosome fragments . Exon-intron organization, ORF orientation and gene IDs are
shown in accordance with the plasmoDB database. Identity (Id) and similarity (S) values between each hypothetical protein product contained in
P. falciparum - P. vivax and P. vivax - P. knowlesi upstream and downstream contigs are shown.

studies showing a peak transcription from 35 to 40
hours of the P. vivax Sal-1 strain intraerythrocyte cycle
[36] and between 35 and 48 hours in the P. falciparum
3D7 strain [17]. Once genomic and complementary
DNA sequences were aligned, it was found that the
pvron1 gene was encoded by four exons, similar to the
homologous pfasp gene [18], the fourth of them containing a sushi domain. Two nucleotide substitutions
and a thirty-two base pair deletion corresponding to a
repeat block (EKLPIGGG) were observed when the
pvron1 gene sequences from Sal-1 reference strain and
VCG-1 Aotus-adapted strain were compared. These
mutations were non-synonymous and produced changes
in the following amino acids: glutamic acid for glycine
in position 148 and isoleucine for threonine in position
740. Furthermore, 17 Cys residues were shown to be
conserved between these two strains. When comparing
these residues from the PvRON1 sequence with its P.
falciparum homologue (PfASP), these presented an
identical localization, suggesting that there was probably
a degree of conservation in the 3D structure of such
molecules.
PvRON1 expression and association with DRMs

Two peptides derived from the deduced P. vivax Sal-I
PvRON1 sequence were synthesized and inoculated in

rabbits for obtaining anti-PvRON1 antibodies that could
recognize the protein in parasite lysate. The antibodies’
ability to recognize PvRON1 was assessed by Western
blot, using purified rPvRON1-a and rPvRON1-c fragments as antigens (Figure 3A). Immunodetection assays
carried out here with polyclonal sera detected bands at
~100 kDa, corresponding to the protein without the signal peptide, and others at ~57 kDa and ~42 kDa, suggesting proteolytic products (Figure 3B; Line 2). Given
that the expected weight of the complete protein was
slightly lower (~81.35 kDa), it is more likely that the
result corresponded to anomalous migration, similar to
what occurs with other Apicomplexa antigens already
identified in the rhoptries, such as TgRON2 [7],
TgROP1 [55] and PvRON2 [30]. When the experiment
was carried out in non-reducing conditions, the ~57
kDa and ~42 kDa bands were not detected, whilst the
~100 kDa band became intensified (Figure 3B; line 4)
suggesting that, as occurs with its homologue [18], these
two polypeptides were likely to remain bound by disulphide bridges formed between the cysteines contained
in their sequences.
To evaluate PvRON1 presence in DRMs, a parasite
lysate was solubilized at different temperatures and used
for rabbit sera recognition assays. Consistent with the
results that recognized the protein in the parasite lysate

(Figure 3B; Line 2), polyclonal antibodies detected bands
at ~100 kDa, ~57 kDa and ~42 kDa in the pellet soluble
fraction at 4°C, and in the treatment soluble fraction at
37°C (Figure 3B; lines 8 and 10); these bands disappeared when the pellet was treated with the non-ionic
detergent at 37°C (Figure 3B; line 12). Interestingly, sera
revealed bands in the soluble fraction at 4°C (Figure 3B;
line 6), which can be attributed to the high protein
expression levels during schizont stage. Together, these
results led to confirming that PvRON1 antigen was associated with DRMs, differing from what has been
reported in the DRM proteome study [15].

An immunofluorescence assay was carried out on a
blood smear of P. vivax-infected RBCs for assessing the
protein’s subcellular localization in the parasite. Figure
4A shows PvRON1 distribution in mature schizonts as a
punctuated fluorescence pattern, which is characteristic
of apical organelle proteins (rhoptries and micronemes).
Alternatively, double labeling was carried out using antiPvRhopH3 mice antibodies (rhoptry bulb marker) and
anti-PvRON1 rabbit antibodies (Figure 4B). Overlapping
images showed partial localization of both proteins, supporting the fact that PvRON1 antigen could be forming
part of the rhoptry neck, as occurs with P. falciparum
ASP protein [56].

expressed as recombinants proteins. Each purified protein’s antigenicity was evaluated by Western blot using
sera from 20 patients living in P. vivax malarial endemic
regions in Colombia and who had had active episodes of
the disease. Sera from four individuals who had never
suffered from malaria were used as negative controls.
All individuals signed an informed consent after receiving detailed information regarding the study goals. Most
sera, except for that from controls, presented reactivity
towards rPvRON1-a and rPvRON1-c (Figure 5A and
5B) fragments, suggesting that PvRON1 is expressed
during natural malarial infection and that it can also
trigger antibody responses in the host. It has been
demonstrated that antibodies directed against antigenic
proteins can inhibit parasite-host interaction [21] and,
therefore, these have been considered as potential candidates in designing a vaccine against malaria. All the
above supports the notion that PvRON1 may be a promising candidate for further trials aimed at assessing its
immunogenicity and protection-inducing ability in the
Aotus monkey model.

Conclusions
This study has described the identification and characterization of a DRM-associated rhoptry protein. Taking
into account the multiple particularities of PvRON1
identified here (i.e. the gene’s transcription, the

protein’s expression towards the end of the intraerythrocyte lifecycle and its localization and the broad
recognition presented by sera from individuals infected
with P. vivax), it can be suggested that this protein is a
good vaccine candidate. The presence of secretory and
GPI-anchor signals and a domain probably involved in
invasion also suggested that the PvRON1 antigen could
play a functional role during RBC invasion; further
immunogenicity and protection-inducing ability studies
are thus needed in the Aotus experimental model to
confirm the value of this protein or its products, as
components of a multi-epitope, subunit-based vaccine
against P. vivax malaria.
