Physical mapping and BAC-end sequence analysis
provide initial insights into the flax (Linum
usitatissimum L.) genome

Abstract
Background: Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is an important source of oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have
proven health benefits and utility as an industrial raw material. Flax seeds also contain lignans which are associated
with reducing the risk of certain types of cancer. Its bast fibres have broad industrial applications. However,
genomic tools needed for molecular breeding were non existent. Hence a project, Total Utilization Flax GENomics
(TUFGEN) was initiated. We report here the first genome-wide physical map of flax and the generation and analysis
of BAC-end sequences (BES) from 43,776 clones, providing initial insights into the genome.
Results: The physical map consists of 416 contigs spanning ~368 Mb, assembled from 32,025 fingerprints,
representing roughly 54.5% to 99.4% of the estimated haploid genome (370-675 Mb). The N50 size of the contigs
was estimated to be ~1,494 kb. The longest contig was ~5,562 kb comprising 437 clones. There were 96 contigs
containing more than 100 clones. Approximately 54.6 Mb representing 8-14.8% of the genome was obtained from
80,337 BES. Annotation revealed that a large part of the genome consists of ribosomal DNA (~13.8%), followed by
known transposable elements at 6.1%. Furthermore, ~7.4% of sequence was identified to harbour novel repeat
elements. Homology searches against flax-ESTs and NCBI-ESTs suggested that ~5.6% of the transcriptome is unique
to flax. A total of 4064 putative genomic SSRs were identified and are being developed as novel markers for their
use in molecular breeding.
Conclusion: The first genome-wide physical map of flax constructed with BAC clones provides a framework for
accessing target loci with economic importance for marker development and positional cloning. Analysis of the
BES has provided insights into the uniqueness of the flax genome. Compared to other plant genomes, the
proportion of rDNA was found to be very high whereas the proportion of known transposable elements was low.
The SSRs identified from BES will be valuable in saturating existing linkage maps and for anchoring physical and
genetic maps. The physical map and paired-end reads from BAC clones will also serve as scaffolds to build and
validate the whole genome shotgun assembly.

Background
Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) was domesticated for its
seed oil and stem fibres nearly 7,000 years ago, during
the Neolithic period [1]. However, recently discovered
30,000 year old flax fibres from the upper Paleolithic
period suggest that flax was used by humans prior to its
domestication [2]. Today, flax is grown as an oilseed
(linseed) crop or a fibre crop. Linseed oil, rich in the

omega-3 fatty acid (alpha linolenic acid), is being used
in the fabrication of biodegradable (’green’) products
such as linoleum besides gaining acceptance as a functional food with numerous proven health benefits [3].
Flax bast fibres are well known as linen but have a variety of other applications. Therefore, flax is not only a
historically important species; it remains an important,
versatile and expanding crop today, in many parts of the
world. Until recently, flax improvement relied mostly on
conventional breeding methods often limited to an
adapted but narrow germplasm base. Genomics

maps, QTL analysis, BES and whole genome sequence
are emerging, promising to enhance breeding processes.
In 2009, the Total Utilization Flax GENomics (TUFGEN; http://www.tufgen.ca) project was initiated in
Canada to generate genomics resources for flax and to
develop a comprehensive knowledge of its unique genome with specific goals in applied genomics aiming at
the improvement of flax as a total utilization crop.
Flax belongs to the family Linaceae, order Malpighiales. The genus Linum consists of approximately 200
species, of which L. angustifolium Huds. is considered
the wild progenitor of cultivated flax, Linum usitatissimum L. The latter is a self pollinated diploid species
with a chromosome number of 2n = 30 [4]. The flax
genome was estimated to contain a C-value of 0.7 pg,
equivalent to ~675 Mb in size ([5]; http://data.kew.org/
cvalues/) and to have unique characteristics [6]. However, a recent estimate of the size of the CDC Bethune
flax genome of 0.38 pg/C would translate into only 370
Mb (Michael Deyholos and David Galbraith, personal
communication). Environmental induction of stable
heritable changes resulting in extreme differences for
plant weight, height and DNA content were reported in
the flax lines Stormont Cirrus, Rembrandt, Hollandia
and Liral Monarch where they were referred as large
stable genotrophs (L1) and small stable genotrophs (S1)
[6,7]. Flax nuclear DNA with ~35% highly repetitive tandemly arrayed sequences, ~15% middle repetitive fraction and ~50% low-copy number fraction is reported to
be somewhat different from other plant genomes characterized to date [7]. Classical cytogenetic studies identified two nucleolar organizer regions (NOR) harbouring
rDNA loci with tandem arrays of repeating units of 8.6
kb in length, encoding 45S rRNA transcriptional units
and spacer DNA and serving as precursors of 25S, 5.8S
and 18S rRNAs [8]. In contrast, 5S rRNA loci were distributed over many chromosomes of flax as tandem
arrays of 350-370 bp, consisting of a 120 bp transcription unit and a 230 bp spacer DNA [9,10]. Nearly 3% of
the flax genome was estimated to represent the 5S
rRNA multigene family with ~117,000 copies per diploid
genome [10], compared to 0.7% in Arabidopsis [11].
Also, 5S rDNA multigene family members were found
to have several classes which were more heterogeneous
than 45S rDNA, in terms of sequence divergence [9]. A
high-density microarray platform was recently developed
which is suitable for analyzing differential gene expression of biologically relevant samples [12].
Large insert genomic libraries constructed with bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) are known for their
high degree of genomic insert structural stability and
easy handling of E. coli host cells. BAC libraries are useful in generating physical maps, in sequencing using a
clone by clone based sequencing strategy and minimum

tiling paths and in map-based cloning of agronomically
important genes such as disease resistance genes.
A physical map represents a genomic region (single
locus) or an entire genome, constructed by set(s) of overlapping large-insert clones in which the distances are measured in base pairs [13]. Contigs are built following the
analysis of a large number of BAC clone fingerprints
obtained by size determination after digestion with a number of restriction enzymes [14]. Clone overlap is determined by statistical analysis, employing the FPC algorithm
[15]. BAC-based whole genome physical maps have been
constructed in rice [16,17], Arabidopsis [18,19], maize
[20], soybean [21], bean [22], Brassica rapa [23], Brachypodium [24], papaya [25] and melon [26].
BAC-end sequencing refers to the bidirectional end
sequencing of the genomic DNA insert with the help of
universal priming sites in the cloning vector. They were
proposed as sequence tagged connectors (STC) for generating accurate assembly of the whole genome shotgun
sequence of the human genome [27] because of the constraints imposed in the assembly in terms of distance
and orientation between mate-pairs. At an optimal
redundancy level of coverage required in genome projects, whole genome BES cover ~5-10% of the genome
and, as such, their annotation can provide initial insights
into the composition of a genome as reported in rice
[28], maize [29], Korean ginseng [30], papaya [31], Brassica rapa [32], wheat 3B [33], Musa acuminata [34],
white clover [35], Brachypodium [36], potato [37],
tomato [37], citrus [38], apple [39] and carrot [40]. They
are also a good source of genomic simple sequence
repeats (SSRs) which serve as reliable landmarks across
the genome upon genetic mapping, as reported in plant
genomes such as cotton [41] and Brassica napus [42].
Also, BES are useful in anchoring the physical and
genetic maps as reported in rice [16] and soybean [43].
Gene ontology (GO) provides a set of unified and
structured vocabularies that describe gene products and
their annotations in the context of cellular components
where they are localized, biological processes in which
they are involved and molecular functions they perform,
thereby classifying them into functional categories independent of organisms ([44]; http://www.geneontology.
org). For instance, in castor bean, a phylogenetically
related taxa of flax, 43,657 GO terms were assigned to
14,991 proteins [45]. Similarly, GO annotations of
59,626 EST derived flax unigenes suggested 16.8%,
24.3% and 27.8% of sequences could be assigned to
molecular functions, biological processes and cellular
components, respectively [12]. Further categorization of
gene annotations on the basis of a relatively small set of
high-level GO terms, called GO-slim categories, provides a broad overview of biology encoded by the genome [44] indicating its uniqueness.

cutoff, requiring one end clone; 5) 1e-12 cutoff, requiring
one end clone and 6) 1e -10 cutoff, requiring one end
clone. A total of 129 EST-SSR markers were initially
used to anchor the FPC contigs to a genetic map [47] as
well as to validate the assembly.

Methods
BAC libraries

BAC-end sequencing

BAC libraries of the cultivar CDC Bethune were constructed from high molecular weight DNA isolated from
10 g of young leaf tissue by BIO S&T Inc. (Montreal,
Canada). Two restriction enzymes, HindIII and BamHI,
were used for partial digestion of mega-size DNA,
cloned in the pIndigoBAC-5 vector (Epicentre Inc.,
Madison, USA) and transformed in the E. coli strain
DH10B (Invitrogen, Canada). LB medium containing
12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml X-Gal and 25
μg/ml IPTG ensured selection of recombinant clones
based on the insertional inactivation of the lac Z gene
prior to arraying in 384 well plates. The HindIII library
consists of 40,704 clones with an average insert size of
150 kb and the BamHI library consists of 51,456 clones
with an average insert size of 135 kb. Genome coverage
of ~8.7X and ~9.9X were estimated for the HindIII and
BamHI libraries, respectively, based on the 675 Mb original size estimate of the flax genome.

Bidirectional-end sequencing of the 43,776 fingerprinted
BAC clones was also carried out at the Genome
Sciences Centre by the standard Sanger dideoxy chain
termination method using Big-Dye v3.1 chemistry and
an ABI 3730 or 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Base calling was carried out using
PHRED [48] and the resultant sequences were processed
by removing reads of less than 80 bp in length.
Identification of known repeats

Processed BES were analysed with the Repeatmasker v3.2.8 pipeline of the Institute of Systems Biology http://
www.repeatmasker.org for identifying known classes of
repeats using the Repbase update database (db), subset
Viridiplantae [49]. Independent homology searches
(BLASTn) of BES against the TIGR plant repeat database [50] was also carried out to generate additional evidence of known repeat contents, especially rDNA
content.

BAC fingerprinting and physical mapping

A total of 43,776 CDC Bethune BAC clones (comprising
20,352 and 23,424 from the HindIII and BamHI
libraries, respectively) were used for agarose gel based
fingerprinting and assembly after double digestion with
EcoRI and EcoRV, following the protocol of Mathewson
et al [46], at the Genome Sciences Centre of the British
Columbia (BC) Cancer Agency. Fingerprints representing potential repetitive regions and cross well contaminations were filtered out using an in-house automated
gel analysis software called ‘ClipLanes’. Prior to assembly, a procedure called ‘mapmopping’ was performed on
the fingerprints to further filter out clones that contained more than 135 restriction fragments, and then
those that had an insert over 260 kb in size and in
excess of 110 fragments. The resultant high quality fingerprints were assembled using the FPC algorithm (Fingerprinting contigs, [15]), initially using a high
stringency cutoff value of 1e-16 and a tolerance of 7. If
there were shared marker fragments, the cutoff was
altered depending on the number of shared markers, as
follows: one marker, 1e -15 ; two markers, 1e -14 ; three
markers, 1e-13. A series of six automated contig merging
rounds were then performed at the fixed tolerance of 7,
each round dropping slightly in stringency of overlap
expected between end clones: 1) 1e-14 cutoff, requiring
two end clones; 2) 1e -12 cutoff, requiring two end
clones; 3) 1e-10 cutoff, requiring two end clones; 4) 1e-14

Identification of unique flax repeats

Self-BLASTn (E-value threshold of e-25) was performed
using repeat masked BES (80,337 sequences in total) to
identify sequences that had strong matches to multiple
sequences in the BES dataset, representing potential
novel uncharacterized repeat sequences from the flax
genome not available in the public domain. Queries
with a minimum of ten hits over minimum thresholds
of 80 bp length and 80% identity were extracted and
clustered to form mutually exclusive groups. For individual groups, consensus sequences (contigs) were generated by assembly using CAP3 [51]. The reads not
assembling into consensus sequences were termed singletons even though they represented more than nine
BES. The putative novel flax repeats identified were
queried by homology searches (BLASTn) against a number of databases, namely Repbase, TIGR plant repeats,
flax-EST, NCBI-EST and NCBI-nt with an E-value
threshold of 10-2 to probe their unique nature.
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs)

Simple sequence repeats were mined from the BES
using the algorithm MISA [52] with criteria of a minimum six repeats for dinucleotide motifs and five repeats
for trinucleotide and tetranucleotide motifs. For comparative analysis, SSRs were also mined from whole genome assemblies of castor bean, poplar, grapevine,

soybean, cucumber, Arabidopsis, papaya, rice, sorghum,
Brachypodium and maize publicly available at http://
www.phytozome.net (v6) and apple genome sequence
available at ww.rosaceae.org.
Identification of coding regions

BES masked for previously characterized repeats were
used for BLASTn homology searches against an inhouse EST db comprising 243,272 ESTs from flax and
the NCBI-EST db. BLASTx homology searches of BES
against the non-redundant (nr) protein db of NCBI were
also carried out. The number of hits was limited with an
E-value cut off of e-5 or lower, as previously described
[40].
Using the BioPerl toolkit [53], parsing of BLASTn
results was done by applying a filter of a minimum of
80% identity over a minimum length of 80 bp. Parsing
of BLASTx results was done with the criteria of an
alignment length of at least 34 amino acids [31] and a
minimum of 35% identity, as suggested by the Gene
Ontology Consortium (http://www.geneontology.org/
GO.annotation.SOP.shtml).
Gene ontology

Gene ontology (GO) annotations ([54]; http://www.geneontology.org) were obtained from the results of
BLASTx analysis by mapping GI numbers of the NCBInr protein db to the existing annotations of characterized proteins in the UniProtKB db [55]. Plant GO-slims
for all three independent GO categories namely, cellular
components, molecular functions and biological processes were obtained from all GO terms associated with
the BLASTx gene annotation list by using the GO slim
viewer from the AgBase web server ([56]; http://www.
agbase.msstate.edu).

Results
Physical mapping

From a total of 43,776 CDC Bethune BAC clones, fingerprint data was collected on 456 agarose gels, from
which 35,585 clones (81.2%) were identified to have fingerprints suitable for downstream processing and contig
building. Further stringent filtering for high quality by
excluding fingerprints representing clones with repetitive
regions of the genome, resulted in 32,025 fingerprints.
In addition, 167 clones were excluded from contig
building by the mapmopping procedure to remove
clones with very large inserts and many bands. Finally,
31,858 fingerprints were taken up for contig assembly.
The initial physical map consisted of 1,096 contigs and
2,035 singletons and a series of six automated contig
merging rounds (see methods) resulted in 417 final contigs. Among them, contig 1,122 with 796 clones (of
which 702 were buried) was identified to represent the

Page 4 of 17

flax chloroplast genome and was therefore removed
from the physical map. The summary of the flax physical map is presented in Table 1. The final physical map
consists of 416 contigs spanning 157, 213 consensus
band (CB) units from 29,027 clones (Additional file 1:
Table S1). A total of 96 contigs contain more than 100
clones and 32 contigs contain only two clones (Figure
1A). The total physical length of all contigs, which is
calculated using the average fragment (band) size of the
clone fingerprints (2,342 bp) and number of fragments
across all contigs (157,213) was estimated to span
368,192,846 bp (~368 Mb). The contigs range in size
from ~5,562 kb (contig # 21; 437 clones; 2375 CB units)
to ~32.8 kb (contig #1092; 2 clones; 14 CB units) (Additional file 1: Table S1). There are 126 contigs more than
1,000 kb in size (Figure 1B).
Anchoring the contigs to the genetic map

A total of 96 contigs were anchored to 129 EST-SSR
markers which were genetically mapped, allowing positioning of physical contigs onto the genetic map. Of
these, 56 contigs were anchored with one marker each,
30 contigs with two, five contigs with three, three contigs with four markers and two contigs were anchored
with five markers each. In 80 cases, more than one BAC
clone identified with a specific marker or set of markers
assembled in a single contig, indicating the accuracy of
the assembly. However, 18 markers were positioned in
more than one contig with the distribution as follows:
14 markers were present in 2 independent contigs; 3
markers were present in 3 contigs and one marker was
present in 4 contigs.
BAC-end sequencing

Of the possible 87,552 BES from 43,776 BAC clones, 4120
(4.7%) failed to yield any sequence, 145 BES (0.2%) were
empty vectors, 1705 BES (1.9%) were shorter than 80 bp
and 81,582 BES (93.2%) were of good quality. A total of
1245 reads (1.5%) were found to be similar to the

the dataset. Finally, 80,337 BES (~8%-14.8% of the estimated 370-675 Mb flax genome), averaging 679 bp and
constituting ~54.6 Mb of sequence data were selected for
further analysis. The GC content was estimated at 43.35%
(Table 2). The 80,337 BES were deposited at the GSS section of GenBank with accession numbers HR714444HR752254 representing the 37,811 sequences from the
HindIII library and HR752255-HR794780 representing the
42,526 sequences from the BamHI library.

Repeatmasker analysis indicated that 22,958 reads
(28.5%) were found to harbour repetitive regions of
more than 80 bp in length, among which 6,633 reads

(16.4%) contained rDNA sequences. LTR retroelements
were found to be present in 10,213 reads (12.7%) and
non LTR retrotransposons and DNA transposable elements were identified in 2,215 reads (2.7%).
In terms of sequence length, the composition of
known repeats characterized in BES is summarized in
Table 3. In total, ~20.5% of the sequences represent
known interspersed repeat elements. The most important component is ribosomal DNA (rDNA) with ~13.8%
of total BES, followed by retroelements at 5.8%. In the
latter category, long terminal repeat (LTR) elements are
predominant with 5.2%, of which LTR-copia and LTRgypsy elements composed 3.4% and 1.8%, respectively. In
total 62 families of characterized transposable elements
were identified (Table 4).
Only 14 transposable elements have been partially
characterized to date in flax and the results of homology
searches of BES against these transposable elements are
summarized in Table 5. Among them, the partial
sequence of the LTR retroelement FL4 was found to be
present in 365 reads, indicating a potential high copy
retroelement in the flax genome.
Independent homology searches (BLASTn) of the flax
BES against the TIGR plant repeat database also identified 13,746 reads (17.1%) as having homology to

Characterization of unique flax repetitive sequences

Self-BLASTn analysis of BES identified 14,475 reads
(18.0%) having a coverage of ≥10x with mutually inclusive hits and averaging 279 bp (HSP length). Assembly
of these repetitive reads resulted in 456 contigs and 873
singletons, representing the potential novel repeat
regions of the flax genome. Singletons in this instance
refer to reads harbouring internal repetitive sequences
and which were found to have a minimum of 10 hits in
the BES dataset. Repeatmasker analysis of all the contigs
and singletons (1,329 in total) against Repbase known
repeat database identified and masked only 1529 bp
(0.13%) of the total length of 1,172,838 bp. Results of
homology searches against databases such as TIGR
repeats, TREP, flax-EST, NCBI-EST, NCBI-nt and
NCBI-nr are summarized in Table 6. A total of 871

and 219 SSRs were present in compound forms. Types
and distribution of SSRs are presented in Table 7.
In summary, flax SSRs are nearly all trinucleotide (2184
in total; 53.7%) and dinucleotide (1571 in total; 38.7%)
motifs. SSRs with tetranucleotide motifs comprise only
4.5%. Motif (AT/AT)n was the most abundant (10.6%)

dataset of ~54.6 Mb. However, homology searches
against the NCBI-ESTs found hits for only 17,038 reads
(21.2%), with HSP accounting for ~6.1% of the total BES
data. BLASTx searches against the NCBI-nr protein
database identified 24,962 reads (~31.1%; e-5 as cut-off)
and 14,288 reads (~17.8%; e-25 as cut-off) (Additional
file 3: Table S3). A total of 6,637 reads (~8.3%) were
predicted to harbour coding regions based on evidence
from both EST and protein hits.
In depth categorization of translated alignments suggested only ~1% of hits as Linum-related proteins with
a high similarity of predicted flax proteins to primarily
unknown/hypothetical proteins from castor bean
(33.1%) and poplar (29.0%), as was expected since all
three belong to the Malpighiales order and share lineage
specific genes (Additional file 3: Table S3). Also, putative gene orthologues encoding proteins from a broad
diversity of taxa (247 genera, in total) have been found,
including mostly unnamed proteins from Vitis (15.3%),
Arabidopsis (7.5%), rice (1.8%), sorghum (0.8%) and
maize (0.4%) (Additional file 3: Table S3). Protein
families such as cytochrome P450 (159 BES), kinase
(378 BES) and proteins associated with disease resistance including rust resistance (108 BES) were relatively
abundant (Additional file 3: Table S3). Around 127 BES
were found to harbour genes or gene families encoding
proteins involved in pathways associated with oil metabolism, mostly orthologous to Ricinus communis and
Populus trichocarpa (Additional file 4: Table S4).
A summary of the flax genome composition based on
the BES annotation is presented in Figure 3. Overall,
known fractions account for ~54.9% of the genome.
Interspersed repeat and SSR fractions occupy ~20.7%,
comprising LTR-copia elements (3.4%), LTR-gypsy elements (1.8%), LINES and SINES (0.4%), unclassified
(0.1%), DNA transposons (0.4%), rDNA sequences
(13.8%), SSRs (0.2%) and homopolymer tracks (0.6%).
Coding regions account for 26.8% and the potential
uncharacterized repeat region of the genome occupies
~7.4%. The unknown genomic sequence occupies
~45.1% of BES data and thus, as a sample, represents
the estimate for the whole genome.
Gene ontology

Mapping of predicted proteins from 24,962 BES to the
UniProt database yielded 45,380 GO annotations as a
result of multiple associations of individual predicted
proteins with multiple functions, processes or components (Additional file 5: Table S5). Corresponding plant
GO-slim categories were obtained for all three independent GO components namely, molecular functions (Figure 4A; Additional file 6: Table S6), biological processes
(Figure 4B; Additional file 7: Table S7) and cellular
components (Figure 4C; Additional file 8: Table S8).

library construction, source clone genome coverage and
the statistical parameters ‘tolerance’ and ‘Sulston cutoff
score’ determine the quality of the map [13]. The use of
two restriction enzymes minimises the proportion of
underrepresented genomic regions due to non-uniform
distribution of restriction sites [57]. It was reported that
contig length increased rapidly when the haploid genome representation of source clones increased from 5X

to 10X [58]. In the present study, BAC libraries from
the cultivar CDC Bethune constructed with two restriction enzymes, namely HindIII and BamHI, were used
and the source clones used to construct the physical
map were estimated to have haploid genome coverage
of ~10X. High stringency parameters (low tolerance
value and low Sulston score value stipulating long clone
overlaps) employed in our study would have minimized

false positives and ensured high accuracy of contig
assemblies, as reported in other plant genomes such as
Arabidopsis [19], rice [16], apple [59] and poplar [60].
Map quality is also inferred from the number of contigs
[58] and maps with fewer large contigs obtained with
high stringency parameters, as observed in the present
study, can be considered robust.
Genome coverage of the assembly

The map generated in this study which consists of 416
contigs spanning ~368 Mb, represents ~54.5% of the
haploid genome when using the original size estimate of
675 Mb ([5]; http://data.kew.org/cvalues/). However, if
compared against the revised genome size estimate
based on CDC Bethune (370 Mb; Michael Deyholos and
David Galbraith, personal communication), the coverage
of the genomic regions by the physical map would
represent ~99.4%. Considering that ~13.8% of flax genome is assessed to contain rDNA sequences (BES based
estimate; present study) whose fingerprints were
removed at the editing stage (with the exception of contig 3 and part of contig 52), upstream to the assembly
process, the current genome-wide physical map could
be considered comprehensive.
The gaps in the contigs represent repetitive portions
such as the nucleolar organizer region (NOR) and

centromeres which were filtered out during the editing
stage because of their highly identical fingerprints or
because they represent fractions of the genome devoid
of restriction sites for the enzymes used in library construction [13]. Gaps may also arise due to collapse of
recently duplicated segments [61]. Physical maps of
poplar [60], wheat 3B [62] and grapevine [63] were
found to have 80%, 82% and 72% haploid genome coverages, respectively. On the other hand, due to either
underestimation of actual genome sizes or the inability
to detect potential overlaps among contigs, more than
1X coverage of the actual genome sizes by physical
maps were reported for rice (1.05X; [16]), soybean
(1.26X; [21]), apple (1.24X; [59]), Brassica (1.3X; [23])
and Brachypodium (1.38X; [24]). This being the first
reported physical map of the flax genome, it provides a
frame work for accessing specific target regions harbouring loci with economic/biological importance for
marker development and positional cloning using large
insert BAC clones.
Anchoring contigs to the genetic map

A physical map orders genomic regions based on clone
overlap whereas a linkage map positions markers based
on recombination breakpoints [20]. Anchoring of contigs to a genetic map through shared markers validates
the assembly and provides access to specific genomic
regions for fine mapping and map based cloning of target genes/QTLs. Out of 96 contigs anchored with SSR
markers, 60 contigs could be unambiguously assigned to
genomic regions, since multiple positive clones identified with a single marker or set of markers were
assembled to an individual/unique contig. Similarly, analyses of contigs having two or more markers indicated
that genetically linked markers from 12 of the 24 published linkage groups of flax [47] were included in the
same contigs, further validating the accuracy of the
assembly. However, conflicts in positioning of 18 markers into more than one contig (for example, marker
Lu361 mapping to four different contigs), could represent either paralogous copies of genes or duplicated segments as reported in soybean [21]. In other words, the
presence of 36 contigs with conflicting marker positions
may suggest the possibility that flax could be a diploidized ancient polyploid, since paleopolyploidy is ubiquitous among angiosperms [64]. Such ambiguities could
be investigated further by anchoring the contigs with
more markers that are genetically mapped so that unidentified overlaps between contigs could be unearthed.
As well, the addition of more markers to contigs could
anchor the contigs lacking markers to their respective
positions across the genome. For instance, 1704 markers
were employed to integrate 284 contigs with 12 linkage
groups of the rice genome [16]. The current map will,

repeats in genomes [69] using Repbase, a manually curated
high quality database of consensus sequences of eukaryotic
repeat elements [49]. Repeatmasker analysis identified
~6.1% of the BES of flax as having homology to known
transposable elements. This estimate of known mobile
genetic elements is the lowest among twelve plant genomes whose whole genome sequences are available to
date, namely Arabidopsis (14%, [70]), rice (34.7%, [71]),
poplar (35%, [72]), grapevine (21.5%, [73]), papaya (51.9%,
[74]), sorghum (62%, [75]), maize (84.2%, [76]), cucumber
(14.8%, [77]), soybean (50.3%, [78]), Brachypodium (28.1%,
[79]), castor bean (50.3%, [45]) and apple (42.4%, [80])
(Figure 5; Additional file 9: Table S9). However, the
unknown portion of the flax genome, including the novel
repeat fraction of the genome (Figure 3), would be a reservoir of new mobile genetic elements and hence the proportion of transposable elements in flax is predicted to
increase with the characterization of this currently
unknown fraction. In castor bean and poplar, ~31.3% and
25.9% of the genome were represented by unannotated/
unknown elements [45,72]. The proportions of known retrotransposons in flax were predominant over DNA elements, as reported in other plant genomes, with the

Mobile genetic elements

Transposable elements play significant roles in the evolution of structure, function and regulation of expression of
genes and genomes [66,67]. Mobile DNA also significantly
impacts the genome size [68]. Among various repeat prediction tools, Repeatmasker is widely used for identifying

and other genomes]. Please refer to Additional file 9: Table S9 for
more details.

exception of Arabidopsis (Additional file 9: Table S9).
However, flax was found to have a higher proportion of
copia retrotransposons than gypsy elements compared to
all other sequenced plant genomes where gypsy elements
predominated (Additional file 9: Table S9), indicating the
possibility of uncharacterized sequences as a warehouse of
new members which may alter the proportion of copia/
gypsy elements. Recently, the repetitive portion of the
banana genome was found to harbour a higher proportion
(16%) of copia elements than gypsy elements (7%) [81].
Only 62 known families of transposable elements have
been identified from the BES, far fewer than the whole
genome based estimates of 1323 families in maize, 300
families in rice and 510 families in soybean [82].
Among the known flax transposable elements, dLUTE,
FL2, FL9 and FL11 were not found to have any matches
in the BES dataset. Interestingly, the partial sequence of
the element FL4 (GenBank ID GU929874) was found to
have 365 hits, representing a copy number estimate of
~516 in the genome when taking into consideration the
genome size, size of the BES database and redundancy
of the library. This retroelement may serve for developing a retroelement based marker system, exploiting the
polymorphism created at their insertion sites which are
useful in diversity analysis as a fingerprinting tool, as
shown in a recent study characterizing the genetic structure of flax germplasm [83].
Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence

Ribosomal RNA genes as a component of ribosomes are
a predominant class of housekeeping genes. Based on
Repeatmasker analysis, rDNA was found to occupy
~13.8% of the total length of the BES, accounting for
~7.5 Mb from 13,228 reads. Independent validation by
BLASTn searches against the TIGR repeat database
yielded a similar rDNA estimate of 13.5%, as the proportion of total length of BES from 13,746 reads. BES
from 13,166 clones matched rDNA homologues from
both Repbase and TIGR plant repeat databases, indicating their significant presence in the flax genome. This
estimate of rDNA content in flax was found to be much
higher compared to BES based estimates in Brassica
rapa (2.5%; [32]), carrot (2.06%; [40]), Brachypodium
(1.2%; [36]), Musa acuminata (1.12%; [81]), maize
(0.82%; [29]) and Wheat 3B (0%; [33]). However, the
choice of the restriction enzymes used in the construction of large insert libraries was found to have an influence on the estimates, as reported in tomato in which
the rDNA estimates were 0.04%, 2.98% and 8.58%,
respectively based on libraries constructed with HindIII,
EcoRI and MboI [37]. Similarly in potato, the HindIII
library based estimate (0.03%) was found to be lower
than the EcoRI library based estimate of 0.53% [37].
Recent studies indicated that rRNA genes are silenced

Page 12 of 17

by epigenetic means for dosage control and thereby
their copy number may not represent their abundance
in the transcriptome [84].
Detailed annotation obtained from flax BES having
significant similarity to the entries in the TIGR plant
repeat database indicated that 13,258 BAC-end reads
harbour 45S rRNA and 407 reads harbour 5S rRNA.
Though cytogenetic studies identified two nucleolar
organizer regions harbouring 45s rDNA loci with tandem arrays of repeating units [8], our study raises the
possibility that that there are more than two NORs or
that the two NORs contain an unprecedented large
number of copies of 45S rRNA repeat units per locus. A
study of 45 Brassicaceae species indicated multiple 45S
rDNA sites across the genome, as observed in Brassica
rapa (10 sites) and Brassica juncea and Brassica napus
(12-14 sites each) [85]. Comparatively fewer 5S rDNA
would have been detected due to differences in the
number of restriction sites because flax 45S rDNA was
found to have restriction sites for both HindIII and
BamHI whereas 5S rDNA has a site for BamHI only
(data not shown). Moreover, extensive methylation of 5S
rDNA resulting in incomplete restriction digestion [8,9],
a higher degree of sequence variation observed among
5S rDNA classes [10] and a smaller length of repeat
units (350 bp-5S rDNA vs 8.6 kb-45S rDNA) combined
with factors such as partial digestion by a hexanucleotide cutter with a probability of finding a restriction site
per ~4096 bp and size selection during library construction would have contributed to reduced sampling of 5S
rDNA sequences among the BES. Interestingly, their
high copy number was reported to facilitate genome
integrity by favouring sister chromatid cohesion during
recombination repair in yeast [86], a hypothesis that
could provide some insights into the genome size variations of the genotrophs.
Novel repetitive sequences

Approximately 7.4% of the BES were found to be novel
repetitive sequences not available in public sequence databases. This estimate was analogous to BES-based estimate
of novel repeats in carrot (8.4%; [40]) and Brachypodium
(7.4%; [36]) and is likely due to the rapid evolution of repetitive sequences which have comparatively fewer constraints than coding regions [87]. When validated for their
unique nature with longer queries after assembly, by comparison against various databases, including plant repeat
databases, ~28.9% of the sequences were homologous to
flax LTR retrotransposons such as FL4, FL6 and FL7.
These LTR retrotransposons were not amenable for detection while repeat masking, because of the high degree of
divergence possible in LTR domains, as reported in Brachypodium [36]. Sequences similar to Linum microsatellite
sequences, multi-gene families such as 5S rRNA, flax rust

Ragupathy et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:217
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/217

resistance protein families and pectin methylesterase
(pme3) were also observed. Interestingly, three of the
novel flax specific repeats were similar to the Linum insertion sequence characterized in genotrophs induced by the
environment [7] constituting the first report of the presence of Linum insertion sequence in the cultivar CDC
Bethune. The novel repetitive fraction may represent new
flax-specific transposable elements and needs further
characterization.
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs)

BES are found to be a good source of SSRs, a class of
markers widely used in generating linkage maps, to scan
the genome for specific loci associated with agronomically important complex traits [88]. In our study, 4064
putative SSRs markers have been identified from ~54.6
Mb of BES, giving a density of one SSR per every ~13.4
kb of the flax genome, compared to an earlier study of
mining SSRs from ESTs in which one SSR per 16.5 kb
was reported [89]. The estimates of ~38.7% dinucleotide
and 53.7% trinucleotide repeats in SSRs from BES are
different from the EST derived estimates where trinucleotide repeats (76.9%) were more abundant than dinucleotide repeats (13.9%). The polymorphism of these
BES-SSRs is currently being assessed and polymorphic
SSRs will be integrated with the first SSR based flax
genetic map [47] and to anchor the physical and genetic
maps. Comparative analysis of SSR motif classes and
composition among sequenced plant genomes vis-à-vis
flax indicated predominance of dinucleotide repeats in
all genomes with the exception of Brachypodium and
flax (Figure 2; Additional file 2: Table S2). The motif
(AT/AT) n was found to be predominant in 11 of 13
genomes whereas in maize and Brachypodium, (CT/AG)
n was predominant. Similarly, among trinucleotide
motifs, (AAT/ATT)n was found to be predominant in
six genomes (Additional file 2: Table S2), whereas in
flax and Arabidopsis (GAA/TTC)n was the major component. However, the whole genome sequence of flax
would provide a more comprehensive characterization
of flax SSR motifs that may alter the abundance and
composition of motifs inferred from BES.
Coding regions and gene content

Sequence based similarity searching has been widely used
for computational identification of genes and assignment
of putative functions by querying public databases [90]. In
our present study, 26.8% of BAC-end reads were found to
have similarity with transcripts from flax itself and only
21.1% of reads matched to NCBI-ESTs, in spite of manyfold differences in the sizes of these two databases. This
result suggested that a portion estimated at 5.6% of the
flax transcriptome is unique in its nature, representing
flax-specific genes. Indeed, a still higher proportion of flax

Page 13 of 17

specific genes was reported from a recent study where
only 21.3% to 62.9% of 59,626 EST-derived unigenes were
found to have similarity to known genes from other genomes [12]. The cumulative match length identified ~9.6%
and ~6.1% as the proportions of open reading frames,
based on matches to flax-ESTs and NCBI-ESTs, respectively in the same range as grapevine exons-CDS (6.9%;
[73]). The absence of introns in the ESTs, a higher level of
conservation expected at protein level and use of a different mining criterion, resulted in an increased proportion
of reads (30.9%) having significant hits against the nr protein database (cut off E = e-5), though this only represents
the similarity to known proteins in other organisms. As
expected, at a further increased threshold level (E = e-25),
the proportion of clones with potential coding regions
decreased (17.7% of the total BES), but remained comparatively higher than the BES-based assessment of coding
regions in carrot (10%; [40]), apple (8.6%; [39]), Musa acuminata (11%; [34]), Brassica rapa (11%; [32]), and comparable to or lower than the coding fractions reported in
papaya (19.1%; [31]), white clover (24.9%; [35]), common
bean (29.3%, [22]), Brachypodium (25.3%; [36]), citrus
(36.0%; [38]). A total of 11,180 BES (13.8%) shared evidence for transcribed coding regions as they produced hits
from both EST and nr-protein databases.
Assuming a median gene size of 3.4 kb reported in the
grapevine genome [73] and using our estimate of transcribed portion (26.8%) having evidence based on flaxESTs, we could predict from 29,164 to 53,245 genes corresponding to genome size estimates of 370 Mb
(Michael Deyholos and David Galbraith, personal communication) to 675 Mb [5], respectively. The lower end
of the range is comparable to the predicted number in
castor bean (31,237 genes; [45]) and the higher end is
comparable to the number in apple (57,386 genes; [80]),
the highest among twelve plant genomes sequenced so
far. In apple, with a possibly comparable genome size
species (742 Mb), genome-wide duplication was
reported as the cause for the large number of genes.
The high proportion (~50%) of low copy sequences in
flax [7] and relatively high gene content could also
result from an ancient polyploidization event which suggests that the repertoire of genes in flax may potentially
harbour duplicate genes as paralogous copies or gene
families. Whole genome sequence analysis indicated that
ancient polyploidization was a typical feature of angiosperms namely, Arabidopsis [70], poplar [72], sorghum
[75], maize [76], castor bean [45] and soybean [78].
Gene ontology

Distribution of predicted protein sequences from BES to
high-level GO terms suggested the presence of a broad
range of categories from all GO-slim functional classes
(Figure 4A). Since predicted proteins can be assigned to

Ragupathy et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:217
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/217

more than one functional category, there were more
annotations (31,880) than total proteins (24,962), as
reported even in a simple eukaryote such as yeast [44].
Proteins with ‘binding’ domains are overrepresented followed by other domains such as ‘catalytic activity’, similar to GO categorization of flax unigenes reported
recently [12], because of the conservation of basic biological processes across eukaryotes. Also, protein signatures associated with ~44 biological processes have been
identified; including 479 (1.7%) annotations assigned a
role in lipid metabolic processes from ~127 BES. The
cytochrome P450 superfamily associated with synthesis
of secondary metabolites, as well as the kinase family of
proteins including serine/threonine receptor kinase with
roles in disease resistance were relatively overrepresented, as reported in tomato and potato [37].

Conclusions
A total of 43,776 BAC clones from the library of the flax
cultivar CDC Bethune was used to construct the first genome-wide physical map and to generate BES, annotation
of which unearthed the uniqueness of the flax genome.
The physical map assembled from 32,025 high quality fingerprints consists of 416 contigs spanning ~368 Mb,
roughly 54.5% to 99.4% of the estimated genome sizes.
The N50 size of the contigs was estimated to be ~1,494 kb
and the longest contig was ~5,562 kb. As a genomic
resource, this map will be useful for fine mapping of target
genomic regions and map-based cloning of genes/QTLs.
Also, generation and annotation of BES, totalling 54.6 Mb
(~8-14.8% of the haploid genome) suggested that known
repetitive fractions and coding fractions account for
~28.1% and 26.8% of the genome, respectively. Among the
known repetitive fractions, ribosomal DNA accounts for
~13.8%, the highest proportion reported so far in plant
genomes. In contrast, the flax genome was found to have a
smaller proportion of known transposable elements
(~6.1%) than published plant genomes. BLASTn searches
against an in-house flax-EST database (db) and the NCBIEST db found 26.7% and 21.1% homology, respectively,
suggesting that approximately 5.6% of the coding region is
unique in flax. As expected, BLASTx predicted flax proteins were similar to hypothetical proteins from castor
bean (33.1%) and poplar (29.0%) because of their shared
lineage (Malpighiales). Gene ontology (GO) terms associated with molecular function, biological processes and
cellular components indicated the presence of a broad
range of catalogued proteins and ~1.7% of predicted proteins were assigned roles in lipid biosynthetic and catabolic
processes. Analysis of the BES has provided initial insights
into the uniqueness of the flax genome among other characterized plant genomes. Both the physical contigs and
paired-end reads from large insert BAC clones, will be

Page 14 of 17

helpful to validate the accuracy and reliability of the whole
genome shotgun sequence assembly of flax.
