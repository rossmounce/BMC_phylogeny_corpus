Abstract
Background: The Mycoplasma mycoides cluster consists of five species or subspecies that are ruminant pathogens.
One subspecies, Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides Small Colony (MmmSC), is the causative agent of
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. Its very close relative, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri (Mmc), is a more
ubiquitous pathogen in small ruminants causing mastitis, arthritis, keratitis, pneumonia and septicaemia and is also
found as saprophyte in the ear canal. To understand the genetics underlying these phenotypic differences, we
compared the MmmSC PG1 type strain genome, which was already available, with the genome of an Mmc field
strain (95010) that was sequenced in this study. We also compared the 95010 genome with the recently published
genome of another Mmc strain (GM12) to evaluate Mmc strain diversity.
Results: The MmmSC PG1 genome is 1,212 kbp and that of Mmc 95010 is ca. 58 kbp shorter. Most of the
sequences present in PG1 but not 95010 are highly repeated Insertion Sequences (three types of IS) and large
duplicated DNA fragments. The 95010 genome contains five types of IS, present in fewer copies than in PG1, and
two copies of an integrative conjugative element. These mobile genetic elements have played a key role in
genome plasticity, leading to inversions of large DNA fragments. Comparison of the two genomes suggested a
marked decay of the PG1 genome that seems to be correlated with a greater number of IS. The repertoire of gene
families encoding surface proteins is smaller in PG1. Several genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism and
protein degradation are also absent from, or degraded in, PG1.
Conclusions: The genome of MmmSC PG1 is larger than that of Mmc 95010, its very close relative, but has less
coding capacity. This is the result of large genetic rearrangements due to mobile elements that have also led to
marked gene decay. This is consistent with a non-adaptative genomic complexity theory, allowing duplications or
pseudogenes to be maintained in the absence of adaptive selection that would lead to purifying selection and
genome streamlining over longer evolutionary times. These findings also suggest that MmmSC only recently
adapted to its bovine host.

Background
Now that rinderpest has been eradicated, M. mycoides
subsp. mycoides Small Colony (MmmSC), the aetiologic
agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), is
considered to be the most important threat to cattle
farming in affected countries. Although CBPP has been
eradicated from most continents, it persists in Africa.

The disease is notifiable to the world organisation for
animal health (OIE) and, following notification, export
of live cattle to countries free of CBPP is forbidden. Programmes for the control of CBPP involve vaccination,
but eradication is based solely on slaughter of affected
herds and strict control of animal movements. Because
of its economic importance, CBPP has received much
attention especially when it affected industrialized countries. This was the case in the 1960’s when Australia
started an eradication programme and in the 80’s and
90’s when Europe suffered a re-emergence of the disease

[1,2]. Identification and diagnostic methods have been
improved. This task was difficult as MmmSC belongs to
a complex of species, the so-called “M. mycoides
cluster”. This cluster consists of five closely related
mycoplasmas that are referred to as: M. mycoides subsp.
mycoides Small Colony (MmmSC), M. mycoides subsp.
capri (Mmc), M. capricolum subsp. capricolum (Mcc),
M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae (Mccp), and
Mycoplasma leachii (Ml), the last being a group of
strains that had remained unassigned until recently
when a modification of the cluster taxonomy was proposed based on both phenotypic and recent phylogenetic studies [3,4]. The designation Mycoplasma
mycoides subsp. mycoides Large Colony (MmmLC) was
discarded and the corresponding “LC” isolates are now
considered to be an additional serovar of Mmc [4]. All
members of the M. mycoides cluster share phenotypic
and genetic traits. One very close relative of MmmSC is
Mmc, and indeed, the reference growth inhibition test
using rabbit hyperimmune serum does not allow differentiation between these two subspecies. However, it is
important to be able to identify MmmSC and Mmc
without ambiguity because the two organisms differ
greatly in terms of pathogenicity, geographical distribution and quarantine regulations. Unlike MmmSC, Mmc
affects mostly small ruminants where it can induce a
syndrome called “MAKePS” with lesions including mastitis, arthritis, kerato-conjonctivitis, pneumonia and septicaemia [5]. It can also be found in the ear canal of
asymptomatic animals [6]. Mmc strains are found
world-wide, especially where goats are raised. Before
1994, the distinction of the two subspecies in vitro was
difficult and findings were sometimes ambiguous as few
tests were sufficiently discriminatory (Table 1). Analysis
of cellular proteins by one-dimensional SDS PAGE
showed that this approach could be used to distinguish
MmmSC from Mmc [7]. Specific detection methods
were then developed based on PCR technology and
the empirical search for specific restriction sites in the
amplified fragment or with PCR primers allowing a
specific amplification [8,9]. Finally, MmmSC specific
monoclonal antibodies were obtained and, more
recently, specific real-time PCR methods have also been
validated [10-13].
The two subspecies have been considered to be very
close relatives that could be distinguished only by minute differences in vitro in spite of their marked differences of physiology in vivo. Recent advances in
sequencing and bioinformatics allow the comparison of
whole bacterial genomes. The complete genome
sequence of the MmmSC reference strain PG1 was
made public in 2004 [14]. Here, we report the availability of the complete genomic sequence of an Mmc strain
and compare it with that of the MmmSC PG1 strain.

List of phenotypic differences that allow the differentiation of M. mycoides
subsp. mycoides small colony (SC) and M. mycoides subsp. capri in vitro.
Adapted from [39,68-70].

We describe differences in chromosome organization,
gene repertoire, sequence polymorphism, and consider
possible links between these differences and the physiology of the two bacteria. In addition, the recent publication of the genome sequence of strain GM12 (Mmc)
allowed a genome-wide comparison for these two strains
and an evaluation of intra-species polymorphism.

Results
General genome features

The Mmc 95010 genome consists of a circular chromosome of 1,153,998 bp (EMBL/GenBank accession
number Q377874) and of a plasmid of 1,840 bp (pMmc95010, GenBank accession number FQ790215). The
chromosome has a G+C content of only 23.8 mole%.
Genome annotation revealed 924 putative CDS, two
Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICE), each being on
average 30 kbp long and including 18 CDS, and 24
recognized copies of Insertion Sequences (IS) belonging
to five different IS types. Two sets of rRNA genes and
30 tRNAs can be predicted. Putative genes corresponding to the tmRNA and the RNA component of the
RNase P were also found, as in other mycoplasmas.
Overview of genome structure and plasticity

The MAUVE alignment of Mmc 95010, MmmSC PG1,
and the slightly more distant California kid (Mcc) genome sequences allowed the identification of 62 Locally
Collinear Blocks (LCB) that were interspaced by Mmcspecific DNA stretches of various lengths (Figure 1). Six
of these Mmc-specific stretches merit special attention.
The first contains ten CDS (MLC_0740 to MLC_0840),
six of which constitute a predicted lipoprotein (lpp)

Figure 1 Comparative genome structure of strains 95010 (Mmc), PG1 (MmmSC) and California kid (Mcc). The graph represents an
alignment of the colinear blocks, identified by MAUVE, that are conserved in three closely related genomes: Mmc 95010; MmmSC PG1; Mcc
California kid. Numbers 1 to 6 refer to large DNA fragments of the Mmc 95010 genome with apparently no homology in the other two
genomes. Numbers 7 to 11 indicate DNA inversions (blocks below the central line) that distinguish Mmc from MmmSC. Comparison with the
strain California kid genome allows identification of the genome in which these inversions have taken place. For blocks 7, 9, 10 and 11, the
inversion took place in the MmmSC PG1 genome, whereas inversion 8 took place in the Mmc 95010 genome. The higher number of block
rearrangements in the Mcc genome is in agreement with its taxonomic position and greater evolutionary distance from Mmc, as compared with
MmmSC.

family for which the best similarity scores were found
with M. agalactiae or Mcc, whereas no homologues were
found in MmmSC. This gene family was previously
described as a candidate for an Horizontal Gene Transfer
(HGT) between M. agalactiae and the M. mycoides cluster [15,16]. The absence of homologues in MmmSC may
be the consequence of a deletion from this pathogen
after the HGT event.
The second is a stretch of 12 CDS (MLC-1730-1830)
forming a maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster. Most of
these CDS exhibit substantial similarity with genes in
distantly related genera, such as Listeria or Bacillus,
again suggestive of acquisition by HGT. Interestingly,
the last four genes (MLC_1810 to 1840) had homologues in Mcc, an indication that Mcc may have previous
contained, and then lost, the first eight CDS of the
cluster.
The third (MLC_2080 to MLC_2280) and fourth
(MLC_2890 to MLC_3080) specific DNA stretches correspond to two copies of the Integrative Conjugative

Element (ICE) (see below) that are 30 and 28 kbp long,
respectively.
The fifth specific DNA stretch contains a pseudogene
and six CDS (MLC_3580 to MLC_3640). The second
and third CDS were similar to two ICE CDS
(MLC_3590 and MLC_3600) with the last four CDS
being identified as IS1296 copies. Therefore, this DNA
stretch appears to be the remains of an ICE copy after
a partial deletion.
Finally, the sixth specific DNA stretch contains five
CDS (MLC_7610 to MLC_7650) with four of them
showing either no similarity to known sequences in any
organism or showing similarity with sequences in nonmollicute organisms (Treponema denticola, Trichomonas
vaginalis, Finegoldia magna), suggesting again a possible
indication of HGT. MLC_7610 and MLC_7620 show
similarities with viral A-type inclusion protein, consistent with this possibility.
The MAUVE genome alignment clearly indicated
inversions of large DNA fragments including one or

28,965 bp-long, with 19 CDS) but are otherwise almost
identical (Figure 2). The CDS are very similar to those
of the ICE found in Mcc (six of the 18 Mcc CDS exhibit
more than 70% similarity to ICEMmc95010-1a CDS).
Four CDS seemed to be more conserved among mycoplasmas: CDS 1 and 22, at the extremities of the ICE
but contiguous in the circular form, and CDS 5 and 17,
which encode TraG and TraE, respectively. For CDS 5
and 17, the highest similarity was found with homologues in Mmc strain GM12 (98%), Mcc California kid
(80%), and partial sequences of M. agalactiae PG2
(80%). They were more distantly related to an M. fermentans CDS (50%).
The two Mmc 95010 ICE copies are in opposite orientation and flank an 80.9 kbp-long DNA fragment which
is inverted, in relation to the most closely related genomes (Mmc strain GM12, MmmSC and Mcc). Examination of the direct repeats at the insertion sites of the
ICE clearly showed that a recombination had occurred
between them, resulting in the observed chromosomal
inversion. It is therefore likely that the organization of
this region is the result of successive events including
the initial integration of an ICE, the duplication and
integration of the ICE at a second site in the opposite

more collinear blocks. Only five of such events were
identified between Mmc and MmmSC (Figure 1 LCB 7
to 11) and nine with Mcc, consistent with Mmc and
MmmSC being more closely related to each other than
to Mcc. The initial orientation of these LCB could be
deduced for those that were colinear and with a similar
orientation in two of the three genomes. For four of the
five (LCB 7, 9, 10, 11), the DNA inversion occurred in
the MmmSC genome with the inverted LCBs being
flanked by IS copies (IS1634 or IS1296). The exception
is LCB 8, which is flanked by two ICE copies in opposite
direction in the Mmc-95010 genome, an indication that
this inversion occurred during the duplication and insertion of the first ICE copy (see below)
Mobile elements: Integrative Conjugative Elements

The two ICE copies identified in the 95010 genome
were not found in the other available genomes of the
M. mycoides cluster, including Mmc GM12. This genome contains an ICE but it is located elsewhere on the
chromosome. This suggests that these mobile elements
were recently inserted into the 95010 genome. The two
ICE copies differ slightly in size (ICEMmc95010-1a is
30,136 bp-long, with 21 CDS, and ICEMmc95010-1b is

Figure 2 Comparison of the two ICEs found in (95010) with those in Mcc (California kid) and M. fermentans. Schematic representation of
ICEs found in Mcc (top) and M. fermentans (bottom) with the two ICE copies found in the Mmc 95010 genome and the single copy identified in
strain Mmc GM12. The numbering above refers to that of the original publications describing these ICEs [16,26], and numbering below the ICEs
refers to CDS numbers in the respective genomes. The CDS are coloured according to the similarity results from BLASTP with the ICEMmc950101a CDS (dark blue, #90%; light blue, 89-70%; green, 69-50%; no colour, < 50%). The two ICE copies in 95010 differ by two CDS (in red) which
may have been deleted from the “1b” copy (or inserted into the “1a” copy). The ICE copy in GM12 is very similar as 13 CDS exhibit more than
90% similarity with ICEMmc95010 -1a CDS. However, some CDS are only present in GM12 (MMCAP2_0566), another is duplicated
(MMCAP2_0556 and 0557) and another (MMCAP2_0554), in yellow, is similar to MCAP_0556. The greatest similarities were found within the TraE
and TraG proteins and for the 2 CDS at the extremities. These terminal CDS may be joined and form a single CDS in the circular form of the ICE.

orientation and finally recombination between the two
copies (Figure 3).
We used a PCR primer pair designed to amplify a
fragment of the well conserved traG gene (Additional
file 1 table S1) to screen for the presence of this type of
ICE in a representative set of 31 strains of the
M. mycoides cluster and other ruminant mycoplasmas
(Table 2). Amplification products were obtained for four
of the ten Mmc strains, indicating that these strains carried closely related ICE. Two additional primers (VIP-F
and VIP-R), designed to flank the insertion site of one
of the 95010 ICE copies, were used for PCR analysis of
DNA from the same set of strains. Of the four traGpositive Mmc strains, three yielded the expected 1,079
bp-long amplicon, indicating that the detected ICE was
integrated elsewhere on the chromosome of these
strains. As expected, strain 95010 DNA did not yield
any amplified product because the primers were separated by about 30 kbp and in the same orientation. The
absence of amplification with “TraG” and “VIP” for the
five other strains DNA was not expected; it may have
been due to sequence variations that hampered the correct annealing of the primers or by other, unidentified,
genetic rearrangements.

Mobile elements: Plasmid

Plasmid pMmc-95010 is 1,840 bp long and has a G+C
content of 29.0 mole%. It is predicted to encode two
proteins probably involved in plasmid replication. The
protein encoded by orfA is similar to several replication
(Rep) proteins of plasmids replicating by a rolling-circle
mechanism. The putative pMmc-95010 Rep protein has
a conserved architecture domain corresponding to that
of Rep_2 plasmid replication proteins (pfam01719). The
sequence included five motifs typical of pMV158 plasmid family [17]. The protein encoded by orfB has a
sequence structure similar to that of the RHH_1 ribbonhelix-helix family of CopG repressor proteins (pfam1402
domain). CopG, also known as RepA, is a transcriptional
regulator that controls the plasmid copy number in the
pMV158 derivative pLS1 [18]. Several plasmids with
sizes between 1,717 and 3,432 bp have been isolated
from mycoplasmas related to the M. mycoides cluster.
Plasmid pKMK1 (M81470.1) was isolated from a Mmc
strain (GM12); it has a size similar to that of pMmc95010 and the predicted proteins of the two plasmids
share more than 97% similarity [19]. Complete nucleotide sequence alignment indicated nearly identical
sequences. Plasmids pADB201 (NC_001382), pBG7AU

Figure 3 Putative model of the insertion and duplication of an ICE copy in Mmc 95010 genome. This figure describes the events that
may have led to the presence of two ICE copies in the Mmc 95010 genome. A first ICE copy may have been acquired from a donor cell by
conjugation, with the subsequent insertion in CDS A (MLC_2290). This insertion led to the disruption of CDS A resulting in fragments (A1 and
A2) and the creation of a small Direct Repeat at the extremities of the ICE (DR). The ICE duplicated and inserted elsewhere in the genome,
disrupting another CDS (CDS B, MLC_2070) and creating two additional direct repeats. Recombination between the two ICE copies then lead to
the inversion of the DNA fragment located between them. The presence and the site of insertion of ICE copies in Mmc is strain specific. This
was shown by PCR amplification with two primers chosen on either side of the ICE Mmc95010-1a integration site (primers VIP-F and VIP-R). In
four Mmc strains, this PCR amplified the expected fragment, an indication that there was no ICE copy inserted at this site (see table 2).

Whenever possible, strains originating from different continents were selected to improve the representivity of the sample. PCR results are recorded as positive
(+) or negative (-) with primer pairs designed to detect the presence of Insertion Sequences (ISMmy2 and ISMmy3), Integrative Conjugative Elements (traG) or
the insertion of an integrative conjugative element at a specific location (VIP). Non specific PCR primers corresponding to 16SrDNA genes were used as positive
amplification controls.

These strains were formerly identified as M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC.

(NC_002569) and pMyBK1 (NC_011102) were isolated
from M. mycoides, M. leachii and M. yeatsii, respectively
[20,21]. pADB201 and pBG7AU encode two proteins
similar to OrfA and OrfB from pMmc-95010, but
pMyBK1 does not. Interestingly, nucleotide alignments

of the plasmid sequences suggested a composite origin
of plasmid pADB201: the first thousand nucleotides are
very similar to pBG7AU sequences whereas downstream
sequences were closely related to sequences found in
pMmc-95010 and pKMK1. This suggests that plasmids

found in various mycoplasma species of the M. mycoides
cluster may circulate among strains and recombine to
generate new hybrid plasmids.
More surprisingly, blast search using pMmc-95010
nucleotide sequence identified a non-coding, GC-rich
sequence of 286 nt showing 96% identity with two Mmc
chromosome regions (Additional file 2 Figure S1). These
regions are located within ICEs, between CDS22 and the
terminal inverted repeat. Three palindromic sequences
of 7, 7 and 16 nucleotides were repeated two to five
times with the potential to form several stem-loop structures. A related sequence was also found in the ICE in
Mmc strain GM12 and in plasmids pKMK1 and
pADB201. The distribution of this trait suggests that
ICEs and plasmids have probably exchanged sequences.
This highly structured region covers a 130 bp sequence
identified as the single-strand origin (sso) of pKMK1
replication (Additional file 3 Figure S2). In rolling-circle
replication plasmids, the sso is the initiation site of lagging strand synthesis and is essential for the conversion
of a single-strand intermediate into a double-strand
molecule. The identification of an sso-type region in
ICEs raises the question of whether this plasmid-derived
sequence is involved in ICEMmc95010 dissemination.
Mobile elements: Insertion Sequences

Five different types of insertion sequences (IS) were identified in the Mmc 95010 genome. Nine copies of IS1296
were identified. They were very similar to IS1296 copies
present in the MmmSC PG1 genome both in terms of
length and deduced amino-acid sequence (98% similarity).
Six copies of ISMmy1 were identified. The similarity with
those found in MmmSC PG1 was high (87%) but lower
than for IS1296. Six copies of a novel IS named ISMmy2
were found; one of the copies was considered as the prototype for a new IS and has been submitted to GenBank
(EMBL/GenBank accession N° DQ887910). This IS is
1,374 bp long, contains 24-bp inverted repeats and appears
to have generated 3-bp-long direct repeats at its insertion
sites. It contains a putative ribosome binding site (position
66-71) 5 bp upstream from the ATG start codon of a
1,278 bp-long orf (426 aa); the orf possesses a classical
DDE catalytic site motif. Accordingly, this IS was identified as belonging to the IS3 family and the IS150 group.
The presence of ISMmy2 in related strains was evaluated
by two techniques: Southern blotting with a DIG-labelled
probe (results not shown) and PCR using a single primer
corresponding to the conserved part of the inverted repeat
found at the extremities of the IS element (Table 2). The
results with the two techniques were entirely consistent:
elements related to ISMmy2 were detected in six of ten
strains tested belonging to the subspecies Mmc and Mmc.
However, this IS was not detected by either of the two
techniques in any of four MmmSC strains. The absence of

Page 7 of 19

detectable ISMmy2 in the MmmSC subspecies was not
expected, given that this IS shares substantial similarity
with two contiguous MmmSC CDS. A single DNA
sequence homologous to ISMmy2 was however found
between positions 801579 and 802903 of the MmmSC
PG1 sequence (NC_005364.2). This sequence seems to
represent the remnant of an ISMmy2 without transposase
activity because it carries a mutation disrupting the transposase gene. The sequence found in MmmSC PG1 may
thus be the result of ensuing genetic drift by accumulation
of insertions, deletions (including the 49 terminal bases of
the original IS) and point mutations. The failure to detect
this sequence by Southern hybridization may be explained
by the presence of HindIII sites in the MmmSC PG1
ISMmy2-remnant sequence (the copies in Mmc ISMmy2
contain no such sites) resulting in much smaller fragments. The failure to detect these sequences by PCR was
clearly due to the absence of the Right Inverted Repeat
essential for PCR amplification with a single primer.
Two copies of another novel insertion sequence,
named ISMmy3 were found. ISMmy3 is 1,442 bp long
with 24 nt long terminal inverted repeats that are only
partially identical (66%) and has generated 3bp direct
repeats. It encodes two putative polypeptides that may be
fused to form a transposase as there is a potential frameshift position between nucleotide positions 503 and 510.
This new IS therefore belongs to the IS3 family and it
closely resembles IS1296 (60% similarity). ISMmy3 was
detected in three of ten Mmc strains tested but was not
detected in MmmSC or Mcc strains (Table 2).
A fragment of another insertion sequence was
detected (MLC_7590). This partial IS copy codes for a
single protein that shares 60% similarity with transposase protein A of the IS1296 found in MmmSC. A very
similar partial copy is also found in Mcc California kid
strain (96% similarity).
The diversity of IS types and copy numbers in the
Mmc strains can be assessed by comparison of the
GM12 and 95010 genomes (Figure 4). Both genomes
contain eight copies of IS1296 but only two of them are
inserted at the same locations. This indicates that transposition events are relatively frequent for this IS. In
addition the presence of copies of IS on either side of
an inverted linear block in GM12 shows that IS duplication and transposition may lead to major genome rearrangements. Note also that three other IS types (14
copies) present in 95010 do not appear to be associated
with any rearrangement. The only other major rearrangement in the 95010 genome was triggered by an ICE.
Mmc-specific clusters: the maltodextrin/maltose gene
cluster

A specific stretch of 12 CDS was identified downstream
from an IS1296 copy (MLC_1730 to 1840). None of

Figure 4 Comparison of Mmc 95010 and Mmc GM12 genome organisation in relation to mobile elements. The colinear blocks identified
by Mauve software in the closely related Mmc 95010 and Mmc GM12 genomes are shown. The various mobile elements where then positioned
on the graph. IS1296 copies are represented by dark blue lozenges, ISMmy1 by red triangles, ISMmy2 by green circles, ISMmy3 by vertical blue
lines and ICEs by red horizontal rectangles. Eight IS1296 copies are found in each genome but only two map at the same site (copies 6 and 7 in
Mmc 95010). In addition, two copies of IS1296 are positioned on either side of an inverted DNA fragment: duplication and transposition of this
IS may have been responsible for this inversion. Similarly, the duplication of the ICE in the Mmc 95010 genome may have caused the inversion
of a large DNA fragment.

these CDS have any significant similarity with the PG1
genome. All have similarities with genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and more specifically starch/glycogen and maltose utilization (hereafter named the
maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster) (Figure 5). This cluster is composed of genes coding for a phosphoglucomutase (EC5.4.2.6), amylases that may be involved in starch
degradation, two lipoproteins that may be involved in
substrate binding, a hypothetical protein with transmembrane segments, followed by malC, malG, and
malK genes that may encode a translocation complex,
mapA (EC2.4.1.8) a maltose phosphorylase, dexA
(EC3.2.1.10) a gene encoding oligo-1,6 glycosidase and,
at the end, a transcription regulator. Most of these
genes are similar to genes found in other bacteria such
as Listeria, Mycoplasma (M. mobile and M. pulmonis),
and Lactococcus, but the most similar homologues were
mostly in Bacillus in which maltose and maltodextrin
utilization has been documented [22]. A tentative model
for starch and maltodextrin utilization can be established for Mmc 95010 with the two lipoproteins
encoded by the cluster possibly involved in substrate
binding (Figure 6) and MLC_1780 in transmembrane
transport. Only four genes of this operon were found in
the MccCalifornia kid genome and none were found in
MmmSC PG1 although the flanking genes were present
(IS1296 and pepF). This suggests that this cluster was

present in the ancestor of the M. mycoides cluster and
that the whole cluster has been deleted from MmmSC
PG1. For Mcc California kid, part of the cluster has
been deleted and replaced by 20 CDS found inserted at
this position. The maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster is
fully conserved in the Mmc GM12 genome but there is
no IS1296 copy found upstream.
Lipoproteins

The number of predicted lipoproteins (Lpp) was strikingly higher for Mmc 95010 (N = 86) than for PG1
(N = 56). Sixty of these Lpp in Mmc 95010 can be
grouped into 16 families, and seven are organised in
clusters (Additional files 4, 5 and 6, figures S3, S4 and
S5). Many of these clustered Lpp are absent from
MmmSC PG1 or are interrupted by IS elements. In
contrast, all these clusters were found in strain GM12
with a perfect synteny with the 95010 genome. However, the similarity (between GM12 and 95010) differed
greatly from one Lpp to another (from 52 to 98%),
whereas the flanking housekeeping genes were well
conserved (mean of 98% similarity). For example, the
five Lpp illustrated in Additional file 5 Figure S4
(MLC_9030 9040; 9050; 9070; 9080; 9090) form a
family with a highly conserved signal peptide and lipoprotein cleavage site (AVIAC) and some conserved
stretches in their C terminal parts. The presence of IS

Figure 5 Organisation of the “maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster” in the Mmc 95010, MmmSC PG1 and Mcc California kid genomes. In
the Mmc 95010 genome, the “maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster” is composed of 12 CDS shown in green. The cluster is flanked by an IS1296
copy and pepF. The cluster comprises: a phosphoglucomutase (pgmB), two amylases (CDS 1740 and 1750), two lipoproteins that may be
involved in binding (CDS 1760 and 1770), a translocation complex (CDS 1780, malC, malG, malK), two CDS involved in maltose degradation
(mapA, dexA), and a CDS probably involved in the regulation of transcription. This cluster is absent in the PG1 genome although the flanking
genes (the IS1296 copy and pepF) are still present. In the Mcc California kid genome, a large portion of the cluster has been deleted, (8 CDS out
of 12) and been replaced by 20 CDS followed by an IS3 copy.

at this locus may be an indication that these elements
played a role in the duplication of these genes. Similar
Lpp are present at the same location in the GM12 genome (MMCAP2_0900 to 0904) and were identified as
putative variable lipoproteins. The similarity of these
95010 Lpp with the GM12 Lpp was between 65 and
93%. These Lpp also shared similarities with a cluster
of Lpp found in Mcc (MCAP_0593; 0594; 0595 and
0596), identified as “Vmc”. They vary in length and
display repeated AA motifs which are typical of variable lipoproteins in mycoplasmas. Such repeated motifs
were not identified in the corresponding 95010 and
GM12 Lpp. Differences in lipoprotein expression may
be linked to the length variation of poly TA tracts
within the promoter region of the Lpp.
This phase variation has been described for Vmm
lipoproteins in MmmSC strains [23]. Poly-TA tracts
with more than ten repeats were found at five positions
in the PG1 chromosome. Three of these positions are
immediately upstream from genes encoding Lpp
(MSC_0117; 0390 and 1005) and the two others are
near to transposase genes. Such poly-TA tracts are also
found in the 95010 genome, at six positions. All precede

Lpp genes and the number of TA repeats differs:
MLC_1150 (N = 10); MLC_5200 (N = 10); MLC_9030
(N = 12); MLC_9070 (N = 16); MLC_9120 (N = 15);
MLC_9140 (N = 15). A LC-MS/MS proteomic approach
allowed the detection of 30 lipoproteins in 95010 and
only 18 in MmmSC PG1, and thus a similar proportion
(about one third) of the predicted genes in each strain.
Of the six Lpp at the locus shown in Additional file 5
Figure S4, only two were detected.
One Mmc 95010 Lpp family, with genes downstream
from an IS1296 element and that shares some similarity
with the spmA family in M. agalactiae, is not present in
MmmSC [15,16] (Additional file 6 Figure S5). In
M. agalactiae, the genes of the homologous family are
also clustered and most of them are preceded by G-rich
stretch that may be involved in the regulation of expression. Interestingly, in the Mmc 95010 genome, intergenic regions upstream from these genes contain a
conserved GC(T)17-20 motif 88 to 113 nt upstream from
the ATG start codon. A similar motif (GC(T)16) is present 97 nt upstream from the ATG of the unique member of the homologous family in Mcc. The function of
these motifs that are unique in these highly AT-rich

genomes, like the function of M. agalactiae G-rich
repeats, is unknown.
Three genes involved in lipoprotein processing were
identified in Mmc 95010: two encoding diacylglyceryl
transferases (lgt: MLC_8480 and MLC_8500) and one a
lipoprotein signal peptidase (lsp: MLC_5520). By contrast, only one lgt was found in the MmmSC PG1 genome; the gene orthologous to the second lgt is
interrupted by a frameshift mutation resulting in two
“hypothetical proteins” (MSC_0936 and 0937) that are
not identified as lgt or pseudogenes in the current annotation of the MmmSC PG1 genome. Phylogenetic analysis of diacylglyceryl transferase across mollicutes reveals
that most species possess only one lgt gene but that
duplication has occurred in the ancestor of the Spiroplasma phylogenetic group. Whether the inactivation of
one copy in MmmSC PG1 has affected the lipoprotein
processing in this strain is not known.
Pseudogenisation in MmmSC PG1 and genes interrupted
by mobile elements

The annotation process of the Mmc 95010 genome
identified 45 CDS that were highly similar to two or
three contiguous CDS in MmmSC PG1. These MmmSC

PG1 CDS correspond to pseudogenes (N = 96) that
were not identified as such at the time of the annotation
because no sequence from a related mycoplasma was
available (Table 3). The proteomic approach allowed the
detection of peptides for 11 of these 45 Mmc 95010
genes. Surprisingly, five products from the corresponding interrupted MmmSC genes were also detected.
These products may result from the expression of a partial gene. Alternatively, there may be errors in the
MmmSC PG1 sequence. In addition to disruption of
genes by frameshift mutations, five PG1 genes were
truncated by insertion sequences. Only three of these
five genes had orthologues in Mmc (two CHP and one
putative haemolysin). Conversely, four CDS in Mmc
95010 are interrupted by IS elements but only one of
them was similar to a gene in MmmSC PG1 (a lipoprotein). Three Mmc 95010 genes (MLC_1870, 3270, 4830,
coding for a leucylpeptidase, a protease and an endopeptidase, respectively) had orthologues in MmmSC PG1
that are altered: the MmmSC leucylpeptidase gene is
truncated, giving two CDS (MSC_0234, MSC_0235) by
a frameshift mutation; the protease gene is interrupted
by an insertion sequence (MSC_0343); and the endopeptidase (MSC_0504) gene is shorter by 100 codons than

the Mmc 95010 ortholog. The inactivation of these
three genes may explain why MmmSC PG1 is less able
to hydrolyse proteins as evidenced by the inspissated
serum digestion test (Table 1).
The insertion of these 2 ICE copies in the Mmc 95010
genome has disrupted two CDS. The first encodes a
putative lipoprotein (MLC_2070; 142 AA) whose orthologue in Mmc GM12 (MMCAP2_0208) is 263 AA long.
The second encodes a putative permease, 1624 AA long,
annotated as a pseudogene in 95010 (MLC_2290),
whose orthologue in GM12 (MMCAP2_0272) is 1773
AA long and possesses two FtsX domains that may be
associated with lipid transport. A gene orthologous to
this permease was also found in the MmmSC PG1
sequence (MSC_0033, 1796 AA long).
Global comparison of gene repertoires

A search for orthologous genes in the Mmc 95010,
MmmSC PG1 and Mcc California kid genomes identified various clusters of orthologs that were specific to
each genome or shared by two or three genomes (Figure
7 Additional file 7 table S2).
The majority of the 113 PG1-specific clusters (Additional file 7 table S2, sheet E), correspond to hypothetical proteins and predicted lipoproteins, most (63%) of
which, however, are considered to be pseudogenes. In
addition, two clusters identified as an Aspartate-tRNA
ligase (aspS, MSC_0432) and a CTP synthetase (pyrG,
MSC_0902) are in fact partial sequences that were erroneously annotated and should also be considered as

the list of orthologues.

pseudogenes. MSC_0902 maps near two other CDS that
are duplicated, probably when an IS element transposed
(IS1296 copy). The same event may have occurred for
three clusters identified as cps, glf and galE (MSC_0970;
0974 and 0985) which are partial duplicated copies of
genes with orthologues in 95010. These sequences
should also have been annotated as “putative pseudogenes”. In addition, PG1-specific clusters included
restriction modification genes, notably an adenine or
cytosine methylase (MSC_0950 and 0951).
As expected, some transposase genes and genes
belonging to the maltodextrin/maltose gene cluster were
identified as Mmc 95010-specific CDS (Additional file 7
Table S2, sheet F). One CDS coding for a predicted
MatE efflux family protein (Multi Antimicrobial Extrusion) was identified (MLC_6090). These proteins mediate resistance to a wide range of cationic dyes,
fluroquinolones, aminoglycosides and other structurally
diverse antibodies and drugs, and most possess 12
alpha-helical transmembrane regions. This is the case
for MLC_6090 in strain 95010 but apparently not in
strain GM12 in which the CDS has been disrupted
resulting in two CDS which should be considered to be
pseudogenes.
Some ribosomal proteins, such as rpmJ, rpsS, rpsN
and a preprotein translocase secG, were identified as
specific for a subset of strains (Additional file 7 Table
S2, sheet C). This may be a consequence of the very
small size of these proteins which resulted in very low
blast e values or, more frequently, of incorrect annotation of the PG1 genome. This could be evidenced by a
BLASTN search that identified rpmJ and rpsN in the
PG1 sequence at positions 830855 and 836897, respectively, and the identification of secG at position 973088.
The 658 CDS clusters that were found as orthologous in
all of MmmSC PG1, Mmc 95010 and Mcc California
kid (Additional file 7 Table S2, sheet A) may be considered as the “M. mycoides core genome”.
A blast analysis of whole CDS in Mmc strains 95010 and
GM12 showed that 80% of these CDS shared more than
90% identity. This illustrates the very close relatedness of
the two genomes and confirms their classification as
belonging to the same subspecies. The divergent CDS had
identity values that varied from 20 to 90% (Additional file
8 Table S3). Many corresponded to partial sequences that
may be considered as pseudogenes and the lower identity
values may be due to these sequences being short or to
the fact that mutations are likely to accumulate more
rapidly in pseudogenes than in functional genes. Other
divergent genes were identified as lipoproteins and the
percentage of identity for these genes varied from 30% to
90%. Similar polymorphism was also evidenced in membrane surface expressed proteins highlighting the highly
dynamic and diverse surface architecture of otherwise

Thiaucourt et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:114
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/114

closely related strains. This is undoubtedly a consequence
of environmental pressures that shape the variability of
these surface exposed proteins. This variability also
explains why reference identification tests such as the
growth inhibition test may give such variable results as
hyperimmune sera contain large amounts of antibodies
directed towards these immunodominant antigens. Divergent CDS also included restriction and modification genes
such as “C5 Cytosine DNA methylase” (MMCAP2_0554),
“GCATC recognizing Type II restriction modification system” (MMCAP2_2020; 0900 and 0920), “restriction endonuclease” (MLC__1620), “modification methylase”
(MLC_1630), “cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase
Sau96I” (MLC_2020) and “Type II site specific deoxyribonuclease (Sau96I like)” (MLC_2030).

Discussion
Our goal was to compare the genomes of two very closely related Mycoplasma subspecies and accurately
determine their degree of relatedness. This can be done
at various levels by comparing the genome organization,
the gene repertoire and the polymorphisms within the
genes.
Genome plasticity in mycoplasmas of the mycoides
cluster is greatly influenced by the “mobilome” and
more specifically by ICE and IS. Such elements were evidenced in the 95010 genome and have been shown to
drive overall genome plasticity.
Integrative conjugative elements have a modular
structure and contain blocks of genes dedicated to
integration into and excision from the chromosome, as
well as conjugal transfer [24]. Until recently, ICEs had
been evidenced in a limited range of hosts belonging
to the four major divisions of bacteria. However, whole
genome sequencing projects suggest that ICEs are
widespread in bacteria and could be one of the main
types of shuttle for horizontal gene transfer [25]. ICEs
have now been identified in various Mycoplasma species, including M. fermentans, M. agalactiae and Mcc
[16,26,27]. The ICE copy number in mycoplasmas
seems to be small, for example only four copies of two
ICE types in M. fermentans. ICE copy numbers are
much higher in other bacterial species: in Orienta tsutsugamushi duplicated elements, including ICEs,
account for more than 37% of the genome [28,29].
Our analysis of the Mmc genome shows that these elements have a direct impact on genome rearrangements, although the exact mechanisms leading to
excision, integration and/or conjugation to another cell
remain to be elucidated. In the genus Bacillus, transfer
of ICE copies seems to be favoured by high densities
of cells not carrying these elements and integration
into a cell apparently leads to blocking the entry of
additional copies [30,31]. The possibility that these

Page 13 of 19

elements are involved in transferring virulence factors
to and between mycoplasmas needs to be investigated.
Comparison of plasmids from the mycoides cluster
suggested that various recombination events may have
occurred during the spread of these plasmids among
strains. More surprisingly, alignments of plasmid and
ICE sequences in Mmc 95010 indicated that these
mobile elements may have exchanged sequences. This
new finding suggests that these two types of mobile elements could interact within mycoplasma cells and
maybe even cooperate in transmission from cell to cell.
Insertion sequences are another driving force for genome plasticity in the mycoplasma mycoides cluster.
Comparisons of genomes revealed substantial diversity
of IS type and copy number even between closely
related strains (95010 and GM12) and that duplication
of IS copies may lead to large DNA fragment inversions.
This contrasts with the findings for two M. agalactiae
genomes in which the presence of 15 IS copies and
three ICE copies was not associated with any large-scale
genetic rearrangement [15]. In the case of the mycoides
cluster, the major contribution of IS to genome plasticity is well illustrated by the comparison between Mmc
and MmmSC genomes. The MmmSC PG1 genome has
large numbers of IS copies, IS1634 having the highest
copy number (N = 60). These IS-elements have not only
led to large DNA fragment inversions but also large
DNA fragment duplications and deletions. This is not
unprecedented in the bacterial world and IS expansions
may result from an evolutionary bottleneck due to bacterial population isolation [32]. In the case of MmmSC
PG1, this bottleneck may have been associated with the
strict adaptation of this subspecies to the bovine lung.
Indeed, IS1634 shares 97% identity with ISMbov3 which
is found in M. bovis, a very common pathogen isolated
from cow lungs [33]. This close relatedness certainly
indicates recent HGT and the absence of IS1634 from
Mmc suggests that this IS was acquired by MmmSC
from M. bovis. Such exchanges of IS in between the
mycoides cluster and the M. bovis/M. agalactiae cluster
have already been proposed [33].
A striking feature of the MmmSC PG1 genome, as
compared to those of Mmc 95010 and GM12, is the
large number of pseudogenes in the vicinity of IS elements. Altogether, more than 98 MmmSC of the originally described putative genes are certainly pseudogenes
as a result of frameshift mutations or inserted insertion
sequences. This represents more than 9% of the total
number of MmmSC genes that were annotated in 2004.
High percentages of pseudogenes are often associated
with a recent adaptation to a host and to virulence, as
suggested for Yersinia pestis [34]. Adaptation to a new
host allows a massive clonal population growth in which
all mutations affecting genes that are not essential for

Thiaucourt et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:114
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/114

bacterial survival in the new environment are maintained. Such clonal expansion also explains the limited
polymorphism of the housekeeping genes. Reductive
evolution of this type has been described for various
pathogens in addition to Yersinia pestis, including
Orienta tsutsugamushi, the agent of scrub typhus, Ricketsia prowazeckii, the agent of epidemic typhus and Aliivibrio salmonicida, the agent of cold-water vibriosis
[29,35,36]. In the case of MmmSC, adaptation to a new
host may also have favoured the acquisition and multiplication of new IS types, such as IS1634. Similarly,
pseudogenisation was also observed in M. bovis, where
an adhesin of M. agalactiae was inactivated upon infection of a different host [37]. Longer evolution times
would possibly allow a streamlining of the genome with
a reduction of the number of pseudogenes by a deletion
process. Mmc is an ubiquitous pathogen that is present
in numerous species (sheep, goats) all around the world;
it is an opportunist pathogen that can infect diverse
organs and can even be found in the ear canal of
healthy goats (or in parasites found in the ear canal). By
contrast, MmmSC is strictly pathogenic and limited to a
single host, cows, and to a single organ, the lung. This
is consistent with an Mmc ancestor, adapted to various
ecological niches in small ruminants, adapting to a
bovine host where it colonizes only the lungs, and evolving into what is now known as MmmSC. Genomic studies, and particularly the observation that intraspecies
polymorphism in housekeeping genes is much more
limited in MmmSC than in Mmc, support the hypothesis that MmmSC emerged only recently [38].
The availability of whole genome sequences may help
unravel the genetic events underlying phenotypic diversity among closely related strains. As an example, the
utilization of maltose in the M. mycoides cluster species
has been studied by AbuGroun [39]: no maltose utilization was found in MmmSC. Maltose is utilized by Mcc
and more rapidly by Mmc. However, some Mmc strains
failed to metabolize maltose at all. The presence of an
alpha glucosidase was also detected by a rapid colorimetric test using pNPG flooded on mycoplasma colonies [40]. None of the MmmSC strains tested possessed
any glucosidase activity although most Mcc and Mmc
strains did. However MmmSC strains express beta-glucosidases with variations which may be related to cytotoxicity [41]. Our findings are in accordance with these
observations. What remains to be verified is the integrity
of the maltose gene cluster in the Mmc strains that fail
to utilize this substrate, and the ability of Mmc strains
to utilize starch. Mcc California kid is expected to be
unable to use starch, although other Mcc strains should
be able metabolize this carbon source.
Surface proteins and more specifically lipoproteins
that play key roles in interactions with the environment

Page 14 of 19

are determinant for the lifestyle of mycoplasmas. They
contribute to the uptake of nutrients and can mediate
essential functions during the infection cycle. Some play
a role in cytadhesion, and other bind IgAs to allow the
cells to escape cellular recognition [42]. Surface proteins
can also display mechanisms of phase variation as a
means to escape the host immune responses [43]. At
the same time they are excellent immunogens, their
lipid moiety acting with adjuvant-like proinflammatory
activity and their protein part evoking an immune
response [44]. However, the type of immune response
they trigger may vary according to the Lpp involved. In
the case of MmmSC PG1, LppA seems to trigger a cellular response, involving CD4 cells producing interferon
gamma, whereas LppQ, LppB and LppC do not [45].
The presence of 86 genes coding for Lpp in the Mmc
95010 genome, as compared to 56 in MmmSC PG1, is
in agreement with findings in other mycoplasma species.
The number of Lpp genes in two strains of M. agalactiae is 100 and 67, the latter number being that of reference strain PG2 [15]. In M. agalactiae, poly-G tracts are
suspected to be involved in genomic rearrangements
and possibly in the control of expression of genes in the
region encoding the so-called spma lipoprotein family
[15,16]. A locus encoding homologous predicted lipoproteins was found in Mmc 95010 with intergenic
regions containing GC(T)7-20 motifs. This suggests that
there may have been exchange of genes belonging to
this family between these ruminant pathogens followed
by divergent evolution of intergenic motifs and subsequent expansion of the gene families. In accordance
with this hypothesis, only one single member of this
family was found in Mcc genome whereas variable
expansions were observed in the two strains of M. agalactiae. In M. mycoides, intergenic nucleotide tracts are
found at other loci. Poly-TA tracts, with more than 10
repeats, were found at six locations both in the 95010
and the GM12 genomes. The size of these tracts differed
between strains. However, these size variations should
be interpreted with great care as most sequencing projects use cloned bacterial stocks: such variants may differ from the main population. In 95010, the percentage
of Lpp that were detected by the proteomic analysis was
30%. This is slightly lower than reported by other studies in which amphiphilic proteins were first concentrated by Triton X-114 extraction [15]. As a
consequence, the differences may simply be due to differences in the sensitivity detection of the techniques
used. In addition, Lpp expression may be driven by
environmental conditions and our results apply only to
mycoplasmas grown in rich media, in vitro. Co-incubation and adhesion to cells may well trigger the expression of a different set of Lpp as has been demonstrated
for M. pneumoniae in contact with lung epithelial cells

Thiaucourt et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:114
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/114

[46]. This type of modulation of expression may play an
important role in virulence.
In fact, the evolution of MmmSC genome may be
shaped by unconstrained population growth in infected
animals, followed by extreme transmission bottlenecks
from host to host. Furthermore, current MmmSC strain
populations may also be shaped by CBPP control strategies based on slaughter and vaccination. Existing
MmmSC strains may well have adapted to this artificial
selection that has been implemented for more than 100
years. The MmmSC genome is larger than that of Mmc,
mostly due to gene duplications, and the insertion of
multiple copies of Insertion Sequences. IS elements
seem to play a prominent role in this gene rearrangement process, as demonstrated during growth in vitro
under conditions of stress induced by high temperature
(41.5°C) [47]. Fever in CBPP-infected animals may
induce a similar stress and favour gene rearrangements
in MmmSC. However, the MmmSC genome is also
characterized by a high degree of gene decay with more
than 9% of the originally described genes likely to be
pseudogenes. Many of these genes are not associated
with any known function ("ORFans”), consistent with
the notion that the number of genes in whole genomes
is often overestimated [48]. This fits also well with a
non-adaptative genomic complexity theory allowing
duplications or pseudogenes to be maintained in the
absence of an adaptive selection that would lead to purifying selection and genome streamlining [49,50].
Genome structure in both of the subspecies seems to
have been affected by mobile genetic elements despite
these elements differing in kind and in numbers. Integrative conjugative elements have been identified in
Mmc where they were shown to induce chromosomal
rearrangements, but not in MmmSC. They may also
have played a role in gene acquisition although this has
not yet been demonstrated. Insertion sequences were
identified in both subspecies but, here again, there are
differences: Mmc and MmmSC have only two IS types
in common and MmmSC possess only three IS types
present in large copy numbers (95 copies) whereas Mmc
possess five IS types but only in lower copy numbers (24
copies). Again the larger copy number in MmmSC may
be associated with an evolutionary bottleneck such that
they provide transitory selective advantages to their host
such as HGT and genomic rearrangements [32].
Homologous recombination has been demonstrated
experimentally in Mcc and Mmc strains [51]. This does
not seem to be the case in MmmSC where multiple
attempts to obtain homologous recombinations in vitro
have failed [52]. These failures could be linked to the
functional absence of two genes, recG and recR, which
are disrupted by frameshift mutations.

Conclusions
Comparing the genomes of two subspecies allows a
micro-evolutionary analysis. Genome evolution is
expected to be directly linked to the ecological niche of
the two organisms and the driving forces shaping chromosome organization, gene content and sequence evolution. Preliminary data, using multilocus sequence typing,
had already shown that Mmc strains were much more
diverse than MmmSC strains [38]. This is consistent
with the different ecology of the two organisms and the
associated population dynamics.
The comparison of the Mmc and MmmSC genomes
has revealed their very close relatedness, especially evident from the sequence similarities in their housekeeping genes. However, in view of the earlier belief that
the two subspecies were nearly indistinguishable, there
is a surprisingly large number of differences. Many of
the differences are associated with genes of unknown
function, and many of these genes may have been
acquired by HGT. Note also that comparison of single
strain genomes is limiting because a single genome
cannot reflect the gene repertoire of a species. In addition, the comparison with MmmSC PG1 could lead to
some bias as this strain is a “laboratory” strain which
has lost its pathogenicity and its genome has been subject to genetic drift since its, unknown, time of isolation. Understanding the real driving forces of genetic
fluidity will certainly need further sequencing, whole
genome assemblies and re-annotation of many wellcharacterised field strains, not only of Mmc and
MmmSC but also of closely related species or and
other bacterial species that share the same ecological
niche.
Methods
Bacterial strains

Mmc strain 95010 was isolated from a young female goat
(alpine breed) with polyarthritis in February 1995 near
Bourges (France). It was identified, at the time, by biochemical tests (Digitonine+, film and spots -, glucose+,
tetrazolium reduction +, arginine - and phosphatase +)
and by growth inhibition tests (positive with antiserum
against strain YG and negative or partial with antisera
against strains PG3, PG1, PG50, F38, California kid). It
was subsequently characterized by multilocus sequence
typing with fusA, glpQ, gyrB, lepA and rpoB partial gene
sequences [38]. The strain was cloned to ensure its purity
and “clone C1” was used thereafter. Other strains were
included in the study (see Table 2 for the full list), notably to investigate the presence of repeated elements in
various strains of each species or subspecies of the
“mycoides cluster” or species that are found in
ruminants.

Sequencing and annotation

The complete sequence of Mmc 95010 was obtained by
a shotgun strategy. To prevent cloning bias, three plasmid libraries were obtained after mechanical shearing of
genomic DNA and ligation of 3 kb (A) and 4 kb (D)/
10 kb (B) fragments into pNAV (derived from pcdna2.1)
and pCNS (derived from pSU18) vectors, respectively. In
addition, large inserts (25 kb (C)), generated by HindIII
partial digest, were introduced into pBeloBAC11. Vector
DNAs were purified and end-sequenced (n = 15744 (A),
n = 11424 (B), n = 1536 (C), n = 5184 (D)) using dyeterminator chemistry on ABI3730 sequencers. To reduce
repeated sequence assembly problems, a pre-assembly
was performed using the Phred/Phrap/Consed software
package http://www.phrap.com [53]. The finishing step
was achieved by primer walks and PCR and transposon
bomb libraries. A total of 990 sequences were needed
for gap closure and quality assessment.
Genome annotation was performed using the CAATBox platform which was customized to facilitate the
annotation process [54]. CDS were first detected using
the Genemark software implemented in the CAAT-Box
environment [55]. Putative CDS of more than 300
amino acids were used to train the Markov model
(order 5). The three codons AUG, UUG, and GUG were
used as potential start codons, and UAG and UAA were
defined as stop codons. Once trained, the Markov
model was applied to the complete genome using 80 bp
as a cut-off value for the smallest CDS. Prediction of
CDS with CAATBox also integrates results of BLAST
searches to discriminate highly probable CDS from false
ORFs [56]. The databases used for this purpose were
SwissProt http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/index. html,
trembl http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/index.html, and MolliGen http://molligen.org, a database dedicated to the
comparative genomics of mollicutes [57]. To determine
the extent of sequence similarity, alignments between
predicted proteins and best BLAST-hit sequences were
performed using NEEDLE software implementing the
Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm and
using the BLOSUM62 matrix [58]. During the annotation process, proteins were considered to be homologues if the similarity in these alignments exceeded 40%.
Predicted proteins with lower or only local similarities
with previously characterized proteins were annotated as
hypothetical proteins. Most start codons were identified
according to CAAT-Box recommendations that resulted
from both Genemark coding state prediction and
BLAST results analysis. For CDS showing neither
obvious homology relationships nor clear coding curves,
the most upstream start was chosen, with a preference
for the most frequently used AUG codon. Other tools
incorporated into CAAT-Box were also used to improve
annotation and function predictions: they included

Page 16 of 19

Inter-ProScan [59] and PrositeScan for domain detection
and TMHMM for trans-membrane segments prediction
[60,61]. To recover small CDS or gene fragments that
may have been discarded during the CDS prediction
process, intergenic sequences of more than 80 bp were
systematically compared to reference databases using
BLASTX. The annotation of each CDS was manually
verified by at least two annotators. The tRNAs were
mapped on the chromosome using tRNAscan-SE software and the rRNA genes were identified by BLASTN
searches for homology with rRNA genes in MmmSC
[62]. Precise boundaries were established after comparisons with the sequences stored in the European Ribosomal RNA Database http://www.psb.ugent.be/rRNA and
the 5 S Ribosomal RNA Database http://www.man.poznan.pl/5SData[63,64]. The rnpB gene of the RNase P
system and the tmRNA were sought by BLASTN
searches for sequence similarity with homologues from
Mcc and MmmSC, respectively.
Whole genome structure comparison

Mmc 95010 genome was aligned with those of MmmSC
PG1, Mmc GM12 and Mcc California kid with Multiple
Genome Alignment software MAUVE v2.2.0 http://gel.
ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve[65]. This software allows the
identification of locally collinear blocks (LCB) that are
conserved segments that appear to be internally free
from genome rearrangements. Genomes were displayed
on a map along lines representing the whole sequences
with LCBs of various colours. Each of these block outlines surrounds a region of the genome sequence that
aligned to part of another genome. When a block lay
above the centre line, the aligned region was in the forward orientation relative to the first genome sequence.
Blocks below the centre line indicate regions that
aligned in the reverse complement (inverse) orientation.
Regions outside blocks lacked detectable homology
among the input genomes.
Mobile elements

Integrative conjugative elements (ICE) were identified by
homology search and by similarity with other ICEs previously identified in mycoplasma species.
Insertion Sequences (IS) in the Mmc genome were
identified during annotation. The total number of IS
copies was identified by “auto-blast” in the CAAT-box
platform and by using 40 bp-long motifs taken at the
extremities and in the middle of each IS type. Search for
these motifs with Vector NTI (v:10.3.1) (Invitrogen)
allowed the identification of additional truncated copies
that may have been missed during annotation. The positions of repeat elements in the PG1 sequence were also
retrieved from the MolliGen database. The IS copies
were then positioned on a ruler along the genome and

Gene repertoire, homologies and orthologous search

Orthologous genes in Mmc 95010, MmmSC PG1 and
Mcc California kid were investigated using the MBGD
database http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/ with standard parameters [66,67]. A BLASTP comparison was performed
with all CDS from Mcc 95010 and Mcc GM12 to evaluate the similarities at each CDS level. The distribution
of similarity results allowed the identification of CDS
that were specific for each of the two genomes.
Proteomics

Strains MmmSC 8740-Rita and Mmc 95010 were grown
in Hayflick medium at 37°C and harvested by centrifugation at the late exponential phase of growth. Whole
mycoplasma pellets were washed twice in PBS and then
solubilized in Laemmli buffer. Samples were subjected
to electrophoresis in a 10% SDS acrylamide gel. Gels
were sliced, treated with acetonytril, dried, and digested
with trypsin. The resulting peptide mixtures were concentrated and analyzed on a Dionex U-3000 Ultimate
nano LC system coupled to a nanospray LTQ XL IT
mass spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan, San Jose, CA).
Data were acquired in a data dependent mode alternating an MS scan survey over the range m/z 300-1700
and three MS/MS scans in an exclusion dynamic mode.
Data were searched by SEQUEST through Bioworks
3.3.1 interface (Thermo-Finnigan) against the CDS of
MmmSC PG1 and the CDS of Mmc 95010. DTA files
were generated for MS/MS spectra that both reached a
minimal intensity, 1.10e3, and a sufficient number of
ions, 10.
