Abstract
Background: It has been well documented that the 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) of many positive-stranded RNA
viruses contain key cis-acting regulatory sequences, as well as high-order structural elements. Little is known for
such regulatory elements controlling porcine arterivirus replication. We investigated the roles of a conserved stemloop 2 (SL2) that resides in the 5’UTR of the genome of a type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
virus (PRRSV).
Results: We provided genetic evidences demonstrating that 1) the SL2 in type II PRRSV 5’ UTR, N-SL2, could be
structurally and functionally substituted by its counterpart in type I PRRSV, E-SL2; 2) the functionality of N-SL2 was
dependent upon the G-C rich stem structure, while the ternary-loop size was irrelevant to RNA synthesis; 3) serial
deletions showed that the stem integrity of N-SL2 was crucial for subgenomic mRNA synthesis; and 4) when
extensive base-pairs in the stem region was deleted, an alternative N-SL2-like structure with different sequence was
utilized for virus replication.
Conclusion: Taken together, we concluded that the phylogenetically conserved SL2 in the 5’ UTR was crucial for
PRRSV virus replication, subgenomic mRNA synthesis in particular.

Background
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV) is a member of the family Arteriviridae that
belongs to the order Nidovirales, which also includes
Coronaviridae and Roniviridae. Arterivirus contains a
positive-sense RNA genome that is 5’ capped and 3’
polyadenylated [1]. A set of 3’ co-terminal, nested subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are synthesized for expression of
eight structural proteins, including the recently
described ORF5a [2,3]. The sg mRNA shares the common genomic 5’ leader sequence, the whole 5’ untranslated region (UTR) for PRRSV, which links with various
3’ proximal genomic regions that are referred to as
“mRNA bodies” [4]. The crucial control elements for

the fusion of leader and bodies are the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) that are present at the 3’ end
of the leader sequence (leader TRS) and the 5’ end of
the coding sequence for each ORF (body TRSs) [5].
This discontinuous RNA transcription most likely happens during synthesis of the negative-strand sg mRNA
template, for which the base paring between the leader
TRS (in the plus strand) and the complement of the
body TRSs (in the nascent minus strand) is critical
[6-9]. PRRS is the biggest threat to the swine industry
worldwide, especially in developing countries, where loss
from PRRS outbreaks has been huge in spite of massive
use of PRRS vaccine [10,11]. One of the major challenges for PRRS control is the lack of knowledge about
the biology of PRRSV, in particular, the details of virus
replication.
It is well established that the 5’ UTRs of many positive-stranded RNA viruses contain key cis-acting

regulatory sequences, as well as high-order structural
elements. For coronavirus, at least three major stemloops, SL1, SL2 and SL4, conserved in nine coronaviruses, have been proved to play crucial roles in virus
replication [12]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated
that the SL2 is required for mouse hepatitis virus
(MHV) replication and sg mRNA synthesis. The SL2
typically contains a pentaloop (C47-U48-U49-G50-U51 in
MHV) stacked on a 5-bp stem. This “U-turn like” conformation is important but rather plastic [12,13]. Moreover, the 5’ UTRs between different groups of
coronaviruses have an arrays of conserved stem-loops,
some of which are inter-changeable among different
viruses, such structural elements may facilitate the presentation of the consensus leader TRS sequence accessible for discontinuous RNA transcription [14,15]. For
Picoronaviridae members, e.g. Aichi virus, three stemloops at the 5’ end of the genome are crucial for viral
RNA replication [16,17]. In addition, a pseudoknot
structure formed by RNA-RNA tertiary interaction
between two stem-loops in the 5’-terminal genomic
region is crucial for negative-strand RNA synthesis for
Aichi viruses [16]. Moreover, the 5’ leader sequences of
poliovirus can form a cloverleaf structure and play a
direct role in regulating the viral positive and negativestrand RNA replication [18]. It has also been reported
that the 5’ end of the genome of Sindbis virus contains
cis-acting elements that regulate positive and negativestrand RNA synthesis [19]. Little is known for regulatory
elements controlling porcine arterivirus replication.
It is believed that the PRRSV 5’ UTR is also crucial for
viral RNA synthesis, yet many details of the mechanism
that regulate the genome replication and discontinuous
subgenomic transcription remain to be elucidated.
There are two different genotypes of PRRSV, type I
(European-type, EU) [20] and type II (American-type,
NA) [21], which exhibit approximately 60% nucleotide
sequence identity [22,23]. PRRSV 5’ UTR differs in
sequence length, 220 and 190 nt for EU and NA types,
respectively, and sharing only 50% genetic identity
[24,25]. Choi et al. (2006) have reported that the first
seven nucleotides of the PRRSV 5’ UTR are nonessential
for virus viability. However, the 5’ UTR deletion mutant
contains a variety of compensatory foreign 5’ AU-rich
sequences [26]. Although the primary sequences
between the two genotypes of PRRSV are distantly
related, the predicted secondary structures display significant similarity [4]. Six stem-loop structures were predicted for the 5’-proximal region for type I (nt 1-280)
and type II (1-246) PRRSV, which are relevant to the
inter-genotypically conserved 5’ UTR domains. One of
the stem-loops is the leader TRS-containing hairpin
(LTH), first identified in the 5’ proximal region of the
prototypic equine arteritis virus (EAV), is apparently

conserved among other members of the arteriviruses
and even in some coronaviruses [4]. The group of Snijder has demonstrated that the LTH and its immediate
flanking sequences are crucial for sg mRNAs synthesis,
with little effect on genome replication and translation
[4,27]. There is no information about the structure and
function relationship of the highly structured 5’ UTR of
other three known arteriviruses, which share little genome-wide nucleotide sequence identity.
To identify the cis-acting sequences and structural elements controlling porcine arterivirus replication, we
conducted reverse genetic manipulation to investigate
the roles of a conserved stem-loop 2 (SL2) that resides
in 5’ UTR of the PRRSV genome. In silico analysis of
two types of PRRSV 5’ UTRs suggested that SL2 was an
inter-genotypically conserved stem-loop structure. The
SL2 of type II PRRSV (N-SL2) could be structurally and
functionally replaced by the counterpart of type I
PRRSV, designated as E-SL2. Site-specific mutagenesis
revealed that the loop size of N-SL2 was irrelevant to
the synthesis of PRRSV sg mRNAs, for which the N-SL2
stem structure was crucial. Serial base-pair deletions in
the stem region confirmed that N-SL2 could be possibly
linked with the viral sg mRNA transcription level.
Taken together, we provided genetic evidence demonstrating that SL2 is a key regulatory structural element
for PRRSV replication, particularly sg mRNA synthesis.

Methods
Cells and viruses

Baby hamster kidney (BHK-21, ATCC CCL10) cells
were grown and maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). MARC-145
cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown at 37°C
and 5% CO 2 in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
and maintained EMEM with 2% FBS. All viruses rescued
from the type II PRRSV infectious clone pAPRRS and
derivatives were propagated in MARC-145 cells as
described previously [28].
Virus strains and viral sequences

The nucleotide sequences of PRRSV 5’ UTRs were
aligned by use of the DNASTAR v7.1 program (Lasergene Package). The genomic sequences were retrieved
from GenBank. Five available strains of type I PRRSV
were included: LV (GenBank: M96262), HKEU16
(EU076704), LV421 (AY588319), SD0108 (DQ489311),
and EuroPRRSV (AY366525). Overwhelming number of
type II PRRSV genomic sequences have been deposited
into GenBank during the last five years, most of which
are highly-pathogenic Chinese strains. To decrease the
sequence bias of the PRRSV isolates, nine type II
PRRSV sequences were used to generate the consensus

5’ proximal sequences corresponding to the first 246
nucleotides of APRRSV (GQ330474), the backbone virus
used throughout this study. Also included virus strains
are the prototypic VR2332 (AY150564), SP (AF184212),
BJ-4 (AF331831), CH1A (AY032626), HB-2 (AY262352),
P129 (AF494042), JX143 (EF488048), and JXA1
(EF112445). For RNA structure analysis, other arteriviruses were also included as SHFV strain LVR 42-0/
M6941 (NC_003092), and LDV strain Plagemann
(NC_001639). The coronaviruses including poecine
epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain CV777
(NC_003436), MHV strain A59 (NC_001846) and
Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) strain Quebec (AF220295),
were also adopted for similarity analysis.

from the bottom of the N-SL2 stem were created,
thereby generating mutants D1-D6 (Figure 1B panel c),
respectively.
As a non-replicative plasmid control, pAS was also
constructed by deleting nt 1688-13118 of the pAPRRS
via double digestion with restriction enzyme Afl II and
Spe I, followed by filling-in by Klenow DNA polymerase
and self-ligation (Figure 2A). Because that the majority
of the non-structural protein and the minor envelope
proteins coding regions were deleted, the CMV promoter-driven pAS is not replicative in the DNA transfected
cells. All of the plasmids were verified using restricted
enzymatic mapping and nucleotide sequencing (Shanghai Sangon Inc.).

PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis

DNA transfection and recovery of mutant viruses

For the convenience of genetic manipulations, a shuttle
plasmid pCBSA was generated by truncating the genomic sequences in the full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS
by Sph I, in between the CMV transcription start site
and the 5’ UTR and Afl II (nt 1688 in APRRSV) and
cloned into pBluscript SK+ vector. The desired mutations were introduced into pCBSA by the Quik-Change
site-directed PCR mutagenesis method (Stratagene), and
the primers used for PCR mutagenesis are listed in
Table 1. The fragments carrying the verified mutations
were then transferred into the corresponding region of
the pAPRRS. Specifically, the 3-nt loop of N-SL2 was
enlarged to 8 nt by substituting G 61 A 62 (GQ330474)
with C 61 U 62 (Figure 1B panel a), and the full-length
clone was designated as mutant L-LL. In the similar
manner, mutant L-RR was generated by replacing two
nucleotides U 56 C 57 with A 56 G 57 . Subsequently, L-RL
was generated by combining the mutations in both L-LL
and L-RR, so that the 3-nt loop and the one nucleotide
(A55) budge were restored.
To investigate the functionality of the stem, the N-SL2
stem was disrupted by replacing the right arm sequence
with the reverse sequences of the left arm (3’ -G70GAGCUGUGAUC 61 -5’, Figure 1B panel a), designated as
mutant S-LL. In the same manner, the left stem was
replaced with the reverse sequence of the right arm,
thereby generating mutant S-RR. Subsequently, the
mutated arms were combined together in S-RL, in
which the stem was predicted to be restored by MFold
prediction [29].
To investigated if the equivalent E-SL2 can replace NSL2, the consensus E-SL2 sequence of the type I PRRSV
5’ UTRs (56uGGAGgcGUGgguAcaGcCcCgcCCCa82, heterologous sequences compared to APRRSV are shown
in lowercase) was used for substitution of N-SL2, and
named as EX (Figure 1B panel b). To investigate the significance of the length and/or stability of the N-SL2
stem, a panel of serial base-pair deletions of the stem

The full-length cDNA PRRSV clones, pAPRRS and derivatives, and nonreplicative control pAS were purified by
the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and quantified
by spectrophotometry and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously [30,31]. 70% confluent BHK21 cells seeded in six-well plate were used for transfection, Lipofectamine™ LTX and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) were used, according to the manufacturer’s
specifications, with minor modification. The supernatants were collected at 24 hpt, aliquoted and designated
as passage 0 (P0) of the rescued viruses, and stored at
-80°C for further analysis. The infectivity of the mutants
was tested by infecting fresh MARC-145 cells, and five
passages (P1-P5) were conducted as previously described
[32].
Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

The transfected BHK-21 cell monolayer was used for
assessing viral protein expression as previously described
[33]. Briefly, at 24 hpt, the cell monolayer was fixed with
cold methanol for 10 minutes and then blocked with
0.1% BSA for 30 minutes, followed by incubation at 37°
C for 2 hours with monoclonal antibody against N protein of type II PRRSV (kindly provided by Dr. Ying Fang
at South Dakota State University). The cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with Alexa Fluor 568-labeled
goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:800 diluted, Invitrogen).
The stained cell monolayer was visualized under an
Olympus inverted fluorescence microscope.
Northern blot analysis

Northern blot was performed according to the NorthernMax kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). 2 μg mutant plasmids
were transfected into MARC-145 cells and intracellular
RNAs were isolated from transfected cells at 48 hpt
using TRIzol ® Reagent (Invitrogen). The RNAs were
separated on 1% denatured agarose gels using AgaroseLE (Ambion), blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane

Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and nucleotide
sequencing

Viral RNAs from transfected or infected cell supernatants were extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instruction. 1
μg of viral RNA was used for reverse transcription with
10 μM primer Qst, an anchored-poly(T) primer (Table
1), using a RT kit (Takara). Oligonucleotide F-6 and R683 (complementary to nt 661-683) were forward and
reverse primers. The RT-PCR products were gel-purified
by QIAgen PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and submitted
to direct sequencing by a commercial supplier (Shanghai

Sangon Inc.). When necessary, the RT-PCR product was
cloned in pGEM-T vector (Promega), followed by
nucleotide sequence determination. The sequencing primer information is available from the authors upon
request. Nucleotide sequence analysis was conducted
with the DNASTAR program (Lasergene Package).

Schematic representation of the mutations introduced into the N-SL2 structure. The loop was enlarged as described in Figure 1, and mutants
L-LL and L-RR were generated by overlapping PCR mutagenesis. L-RL was generated by combining the right and left arm sequences of the L-LL
and L-RR, respectively, such that the overall structure of N-SL2 was restored. All the mutated nucleotides (lowercase) are highlighted in gray

opposite arm. The double mutant, S-RL, was generated by combining the mutations in the left and right arms such that the overall structure
was restored. All mutant sequences are shown as lowercase. (C) RT-PCR of RNAs extracted from pAS and WT transfected cells at 24 hours after

DNase/RNase-free water, and quantified by NanoDrop®
ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). To eliminate
the transfected input DNA, the RNA preparation was
further treated with 2 U RNase-free recombinant DNase
I for 30 minutes at 37°C by using the DNA-free Kit
(Ambion), followed by re-suspension in RNase-free H2O.
RT-PCR was employed to detect the (-) gRNAs and sg
mRNAs using specific primers. As an internal control,
the housekeeping b-actin mRNA was also performed on
the same RNA preparations using primer pairs F-actin
and R-actin (Table 1).
For (-) gRNA detection, forward primer F-6 (nt 6-26,
GQ330474, Table 1) was used for first-strand cDNA
synthesis with reverse transcriptase Superscriptase III

(Invitrogen) from 2 μg of total RNAs. The resultant
cDNA was treated with 2 μg RNase A (Invitrogen) for 30
minutes at 37°C to remove the remaining RNAs, followed
by inactivation of RNase A by heating at 95°C for 10
minutes. 2 μl of cDNA was used for primary PCR with
primer pair F-6 and R-683 (complementary to nt 661683) for 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds,
annealing at 58°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C
for 30 seconds. Nested PCR with internal primer pair F12 (nt 12-32) and R-343 (complementary to nt 323-343)
were performed using 2 μl of 1000-fold diluted primary
PCR products, with the same PCR cycle parameters.
For (+) sg mRNA7 detection [31], the cDNA was
synthesized by RT primer Qst (Figure 2A right panel,

Table 1). The (+) sg mRNA7 was subsequently amplified
to obtain the leader-body junction containing fragment
using oligonucleotide F-12 (nt 12-32) and R-15284
(complementary to nt 15262-15284). Thirty cycles of
PCR were performed as follows: 95°C denaturation for
30 seconds, annealing at 63°C for 30 seconds, and
extension at 72°C for 30 seconds. (-) sg mRNA7 was
amplified in the similar manner, except that the RT primer was F-12 (Figure 2A right panel, Table 1). Each
experiment was independently repeated three times.
RNA secondary structure analysis

RNA secondary structure were predicted using the
MFold web server version 2.3 [29], while the VIENNA
RNAFOLD program and RNASTRUCTURE 5.0 were
also used to compare the predictions. All predictions
were conducted under default conditions of the software. The predicted secondary structure was modified
by RNAviz 2.0 (http://rnaviz.sourceforge.net/).

Results
PRRSV 5’UTR displays inter-genotypically conserved high
order structure, despite with distantly related primary
sequences

The primary sequences between type I and type II
PRRSV 5’ UTRs show about 50% sequence identity
[4,27]. We analyzed the possible high order structure of
the PRRSV 5’UTR by the MFold program [29]. By multiple nucleotide sequence alignment of the 5’ genomic
ends of nine representative type II and five type I
PRRSV strains (detailed in the Material and Methods
section), consensus primary sequences were generated
for the 5’-proximal 246 nt and 280 nt of type II PRRSV
of type I PRRSV, respectively. The high order structures
of the two types of PRRSV 5’-proximal region were
strikingly similar and characterized by six major putative
helical stem-loops, which we arbitrarily designated as ESL1-5 for type I PRRSV and N-SL1-5 for type II PRRSV,
respectively (Figure 1A i and 1A ii). It should be noted
that E-SL1 in type I PRRSV could be separated into two
minor stem-loops, named E-SL1a and E-SL1b, which
corresponded to N-SL1 in type II PRRSV. Similarly, NSL4 in type II PRRSV also could be divided into two
minor stem-loops, named N-SL4a and N-SL4b, which
corresponded to E-SL4 in type I PRRSV. The prominent
N/E-SL5 resembles that of the EAV LTH structure
demonstrated by Van den Born et al. [4,27]. In addition,
we conducted similar MFold analysis to the consensus
sequences generated by comparison of 237 available
GenBank deposited type II PRRSV sequences corresponding to the first 246 nucleotides of the APRRSV
genome, not unexpectedly, this set of structures held
true except that minor changes in the flanking linear
strand region of SL4a (data not shown).

Among the five stem-loops, SL2 is a highly conserved
between different genotypes of PRRSV, despite the primary sequences of N-SL2 and E-SL2 showing only 48%
similarity (Figure 1A i, 1A ii). A “ternary-turn loop” is
located at the top of the SL2, and the stem consists of
G-C rich base pairs (9/11 in E-SL2 and 8/10 in N-SL2).
Compared with the type II consensus sequences of NSL2, APRRSV strain (GenBank: GQ330474), the backbone used in this study, contains a co-variation C56-G62
that was replaced with base pairs U56-A62. In addition,
there were two single-nucleotide bulges in both SL2s.
Both the VIENNA RNAFOLD program and RNASTRUCTURE 5.0 software predicted the same robust secondary structures in the 5’-proximal region of the two
types of PRRSV.
The loop size of N-SL2 is irrelevant to PRRSV replication

To investigate the function of the N-SL2 sequence and
structure, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a
DNA-launched infectious cDNA clone pAPRRS (Figure
2A), a type II PRRSV that was under the control of the
CMV promoter [28]. In the first set of mutants, the size
of the “ternary-turn loop” was increased to 8 nt by disruption of the upper part of the stem in N-SL2. In
mutant L-LL, G 61-A62 , 2 nt at the 3’ side of the loop,
were changed to C61-U62 and became identical to the
nucleotides on the opposite side (Figure 2B, upper
panel). The same approach was used for the 5’ side of
the N-SL2 stem in mutant L-RR (U56-C57 to A56-G57). It
should be pointed out that the base-pairs in the upper
part of the stem and the A52 budge was also disrupted
for both L-LL and L-RR. The normal size of the loop
was restored in mutant L-RL by combining these two
mutations in both sides of the loop. The CMV promoter-driven mutant plasmids were transfected into BHK21 cells as described in the Materials and Methods section. Total RNAs of the plasmids transfected cells were
isolated by TRIzol® Reagent at 24 hpt.
To analyze the viral mRNA profiles in the transfected
cells, we first established the RT-PCR methods to eliminate the possible interferences from the input DNA and
the RNA transcript generated by the CMV promoter.
Total RNAs of cells transfected by the nonreplicative
pAS containing large internal deletion (nt 1688-13118,
GQ33047) of pAPRRSV, which also served as WT control, were utilized for verifying the treatments by DNase
I, RNase A, or the combination of both. The resultant
RNA samples were then amplified by nested PCR for
the presence of the (-) gRNA intermediate. Treatment
by either DNase I or RNase A was not enough to eliminate the input DNA and CMV-promoter driven RNAs,
as the expected PCR product (321bp) from pAS and
WT all could be seen (Figure 2C lane 4, 5 and 8, 9). On
the other hand, treatment by DNase I alone but not RT

Lu et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:172
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/172

and RNase A was demonstrated that DNase I treatment
was successful (Figure 2C lane 6, 7). After serial treatment prior to RT by 2U DNase I and post RT reaction
by 2 μg RNase A, no PCR product of the expected size
was amplified from the transfected cells of nonreplicative control pAS, but the expected PCR product for WT
was still amplified (Figure 2C lane 10, 11). These results
showed that the transfected DNAs and the CMV-driven
RNAs were completely eliminated, and thus validate
that RT-PCR method for detecting the presence of
newly synthesized viral RNAs, if any. Utilized this protocol, we investigated the presence of the (-) gRNA. Agarose electrophoresis results revealed that the primary
PCR with F-6 and R-683 was barely seen (data not
shown), however, the nested PCR with internal primer
pair F-12 and R-343 revealed the presence of (-) gRNA
from the transfected cells by L-LL, L-RR, and L-RL
(Figure 2D), with abundance comparable to that of the
APRRSV. These results suggested that the loop size can
be variable from 3 nt to 8 nt without deleterious effect
on (-) gRNA synthesis.
We proceeded to detect the presence of sg mRNA7
and its (-) sg mRNA7 template by subgenomic mRNA
specific RT-PCR from the total RNAs of the transfected
cells. As illustrated in Figure 2D, the presence of both
(+) sg mRNA7 and (-) sg mRNA7 in transfected cells by
the loop mutants L-LL/RR/RL were detected at a comparable level to WT, indicating that the disrupted SL2
loop, and the absence of the upper part of the stem and
the A52 budge, did not impair sg mRNA synthesis.
Since SL2 is located upstream of the sg mRNA7 initiation codon, we then analyzed its possible effect on
structural protein expression. The expression of N protein was measured by indirect immunofluorescence
assay (IFA) of transfected BHK-21 cells with antibodies
specific for nucleocapsid protein (N). As shown in Figure 3B, IFA revealed that the loop size mutants L-LL/
RR/RL could detect the N protein in cells transfected
with plasmids containing these mutations. Taken
together, these results demonstrated that the loop of NSL2 was not crucial for viral genomic RNA replication,
sg mRNAs synthesis and translation of structural
protein.
To investigate further the possible effect of SL2 mutation on viral properties, the transfected BHK-21 supernatants (P0) were inoculated into fresh MARC-145 cells,
from which viral plaque assay and multi-step growth
kinetics of the rescued mutant viruses were determined.
The average diameter of the WT viral plaque was 2.4
mm, while the recovered mutant viruses displayed virtually the same size including L-LL (2.0), L-RR (2.6), LRL (2.4) (Figure 3C). We further assessed the multi-step
growth kinetics of the recovered mutant viruses in P1
and compared them with those of the parental WT

Page 8 of 15

virus (Figure 3D). The WT virus achieved the peak titer
of 5.16 log10 PFU/ml at 72 hpi, while the mutant viruses
L-LL, L-RR, and L-RL displayed similar virus growth
kinetics and peak titer (data not shown). These results
demonstrated that the loop size, ranging from 3 to 8 nt,
and the two base-pairs and the budge in the upper part
of the stem of the SL2 could be irrelevant to the PRRSV
virus replication cycle.
The stem structure of N-SL2 is crucial for PRRSV sg mRNA
synthesis

We further investigated the possible roles of N-SL2
stem. Using the same approach as for loop mutants, we
created mutant S-LL by replaced the 3’ side of the
whole stem of N-SL2 with the 5’ side of the stem,
including two single-nucleotide bulges to disrupt the
whole structure of N-SL2 (Figure 2B, lower panel). The
S-RR mutant was also constructed by substitution of the
3’ for the 5’ side of the stem. By combination of the two
mutations in the double mutant S-RL, the stem of NSL2 was restored by the same base pairs. Upon transfection into BHK-21 cells and subsequent passage in
MARC-145 cells, S-LL and S-RR showed no evidence of
infectivity, which was readily detected in the S-RL
mutant. These results demonstrated that the N-SL2
stem was crucial for virus viability.
We next analyzed the viral RNA profiles using the
same RT-PCR as described for the loop mutants. Again,
the (-) gRNA synthesis was not significantly affected by
the structural alteration in S-LL, S-RR and S-RL, comparable level of (-) gRNA with WT were detected
(Figure 2D). However, both (-) and (+) sg mRNA7
synthesis were abolished in S-LL and S-RR (Figure 2D).
Surprisingly, the double mutant (S-RL) did restored the
synthesis of (+) sg mRNA7, albeit at a relatively low
level that the WT, implying that the sg mRNA synthesis
was affected to some extent. Moreover, the (-) sg
mRNA7 in S-RL was undetectable using the described
RT-PCR procedure. To analyze the viral RNA patterns,
the plasmids S-LL, S-RR and S-RL were transfected into
MARC-145 cells, and intracellular RNAs harvested at 48
hpt were subjected to northern blot analysis with the
PR3 probe. The result confirmed that disruption of stem
structure in S-LL and S-RR resulted in loss of any viral
RNAs including the (-) gRNA detected by the nested
RT-PCR procedure. The failure to detect the genomic
RNAs might be attributed to the low sensitivity of
northern blot procedure, the low efficiency of genomic
RNA transfer to the membrane by traditional capillary
method, or the combination of both. Nonetheless, S-RL
indeed restored genomic RNA synthesis as well as all of
sg mRNAs (Figure 3A).
IFA also revealed that N protein could not be detected
at all in cells transfected with S-LL and S-RR mutants,

possibly due to the lack of sg mRNA. However, the N
protein expression was restored in the S-RL transfected
cells (Figure 3B). These results clearly indicated that the
stem structure of N-SL2, but not the “ternary-turn
loop”, is the crucial functional structure for viral sg
mRNA synthesis. However, the stem restored mutant SRL showed a lower viral titer at every time point of
infection, with the peak titer of 4.42 log10 PFU/ml at 84
hpi, which was delayed by 12 hours compared with WT
(Figure 3D). These results suggested that the N-SL2
stem mutation rendered the virus replication in the cultured cells less fit, but nonetheless was crucial for virus
viability.

Type II 5’UTR SL2 could be structurally and functionally
replaced by that of type I

Despite the primary sequences of N-SL2 and E-SL2
sharing only 48% similarity, SL2 is an inter-genotypically
conserved structure in both PRRSV types (Figure 1A).
Specifically, E-SL2 was predicted to have one more base
pair than N-SL2, and 11 nucleotides out of the 25 comparable nucleotides were different (Figure 1B). This led
us to investigate whether N-SL2 could be replaced by
E-SL2. In silico analysis revealed that N-SL2 could be
structurally replaced by E-SL2 without altering the overall structure of type II PRRSV 5’ end (Figure 1A iii).
Utilizing site-directed PCR mutagenesis, plasmid EX

Lu et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:172
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/172

that contained E-SL2 in the type II PRRSV backbone
was generated.
To investigate genome replication and sg mRNA transcription in more details, intracellular RNAs were isolated from transfected BHK-21 cells and analyzed by
PCR analysis. The presence of the (-) gRNA, (+) sg
mRNA7 and (-) sg mRNA7 in EX was detected at comparable levels with WT (Figure 2D), suggesting that the
genome replication and sg mRNAs synthesis were not
markedly affected by the substitution of SL2. The transfected supernatant was inoculated into fresh MARC-145
cells, and the total RNAs were extracted for northern
blot analysis. As shown in Figure 3A, EX actually produced more sg mRNAs but less gRNA than those of
WT. At this moment, we are not sure whether the
observed abundance discrepancy between the sg
mRNAs and gRNAs was caused by imbalanced membrane transfer, or the E-SL2 substitution indeed shifted
the ratios of gRNA versus sg mRNAs. Nonetheless, the
substitution of E-SL2 did restore viral RNA synthesis
that was absent in the disrupted SL-2 stem mutants SLL and S-RL, indicating that E-SL2 could structurally
and functionally replace the N-SL2 counterpart in the
heterologous genomic background. At the same time,
the N protein expression was also not impaired in the
transfected BHK-21 cells (Figure 3B), measured by IFA
with anti-nucleocapsid antibody.
The plaque phenotypes of WT and chimeric virus EX
in P1 were distinctly different (Figure 3C). Average plaque diameters of EX were only 1.1 mm, which were
only 40% of those in the corresponding WT virus.
These results suggested that the phenotypic properties
of EX were affected by the substitution of SL2 between
the two genotypes. The titer of EX was consistently 10fold lower before reaching a peak of 5.03 log10 PFU/ml
at 72 hpi (Figure 3D), compared to 5.16 log10 PFU/ml at
72 hpi for WT.
Stem integrality of N-SL2 was essential for sg mRNA
transcription

To gain further insight into the structure and function
of N-SL2, we conducted serial base-pair deletions from
the bottom to the top of the stem, and the shortenedstem mutants were designated as D1 to D6, respectively.
The schematic structure is shown in Figure 4A. Mutant
D2 included two base pairs and one single-nucleotide
bulge deletion. Secondary structure folding by MFold
[29] indicated that mutants D1-D4 contained an overall
N-SL2 structure, except that the stem was gradually
shortened by the increasing number of base-pair deletions (Figure 4A i). However, mutant D5 created a predicted new stem-loop 2 (N-SL2’, Figure 4A ii) by
reconfiguration of the upstream sequences of N-SL1.
Moreover, N-SL1 was replaced by a similar structure

Page 10 of 15

designated as N-SL1’, in which the 5’-end sequences of
N-SL1 interacted with 3’-end sequences of N-SL5. For
mutant D6, N-SL2 completely disappeared, and it
formed linear nucleotides (Figure 4A iii).
The mutant plasmids D1-D6 were transfected into
BHK-21 cells and further RT-PCRs were used to detect
the (-) gRNAs, (+) sg mRNA7 and (-) sg mRNA7 of
mutant viruses. It was shown that mutants D1-D6 produced (-) gRNA as the WT virus (Figure 4B). Furthermore, mutant D1 and D2 produced similar levels of (+)
sg mRNA7 and (-) sg mRNA7, whereas D3 only produced lower level of these sg mRNAs. However, in
mutant D4 transfected cells, neither sense nor antisense
sg mRNA7 was detectable, which suggested that the
deletions severely affected sg mRNA transcription. To
our surprise, mutant D5 that contained one more base
pair deletion than D4 restored synthesis of (+) sg
mRNA7 and (-) sg mRNA7, albeit at a relatively low
level. In addition, when N-SL2 completely disappeared
in mutant D6, sg mRNA synthesis was also totally inhibited, as in D4. Further in silico analysis revealed that D5
regenerated a predicted N-SL-like stem loop, designated
as N-SL2’, by the remaining N-SL2 sequence formed
base-pairing with the upstream N-SL1 sequence (Figure
4A ii). On the other hand, the N-SL-1 structure was
restored by the 5’-proximal sequences tertiary interact
with the downstream sequence in the ORF1 region.
These results demonstrated that stem integrality of the
N-SL2 structure was essential for the synthesis of sg
mRNA.
IFA revealed that the expression level of N protein
was correlated to the presence or absence of sg mRNA7
(Figure 5A). In mutants D4 and D6, positive cells were
completely absent, probably because that the sg mRNA7
synthesis of these mutants was completely inhibited by
the deletions. However, mutant D5 restored the expression of N protein, albeit the positive numbers of cells
were significantly lower than for the WT, D1, D2 and
D3. Taken together, these results revealed that the stem
integrality of N-SL2 played a key role in the process of
the discontinuous sg mRNA transcription.
To investigate the possible effects of N-SL2 mutation
on viral properties, plaque size and growth kinetics of
the recovered mutant viruses in P1 were determined
(Figure 5B). Average plaque diameters of D1, D2, D3
and D5 viruses were 1.8, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.3 mm, respectively (Figure 5B i), which were smaller than the WT
plaque diameter at 2.4 mm. This indicated that the
structural changes in the stem of N-SL2 adversely
affected the phenotypes (at least the plaque size) of the
mutant viruses. In the growth kinetics analysis, D1 and
D2 achieved maximal titers of 5.06 and 5.02 log10 PFU/
ml at 72 hpi (data not shown), respectively, which were
at similar levels to the WT. However, the mutant D3

titer was 10-fold lower than that of the WT, and only
reached a peak of 4.57 log10 PFU/ml at 72 hpi, compared with 5.16 log10 PFU/ml at 72 hpi for the WT (Figure 5B ii). Intriguingly, the mutant D5 reached peak
titer of 4.57 log10 PFU/ml at 60 hpi, which was 12 hours
earlier that D3, yet quickly fell below the level of the latter afterwards. These results suggested that the deletion
at the N-SL2 stem bottom significantly decreased the
growth level, probably because that the sg mRNA synthesis was affected by the manipulation of SL2.
Genetic stability of the rescued mutant viruses

To assess the genetic stability of the mutant viruses during subsequent passages in MARC-145 cells, we determined genomic sequences of the full-length of all
mutant viruses in P1 and P5 as described previously
(Sun et al., 2010). RT-PCR products were subjected to

direct nucleotides sequencing, and such population
genomic sequences revealed no significant changes
except the engineered mutations in S-RL, EX and D5.
As shown in Figure 6, all of the original site-directed
mutations in S-RL, EX and D5 plasmids were retained
in the recovered viruses (P1 and P5), which indicated
that the mutant viruses were genetically stable.

Discussion
It has been established that various cis-acting RNA
sequences and structural elements that reside in the 5’
UTR of the genome of positive-strand RNA viruses are
vital for controlling viral replication processes, including
genome replication, sg mRNA transcription, genome
encapsulation, and/or translation. Here, we present
genetic evidence to support that the predicted N-SL2
stem-loop structure PRRSV type II 5’ UTR is essential

for viral replication, and particularly sg mRNA synthesis.
This inter-typically conserved stem-loop structure can
be replaced by heterologous E-SL2 of the type I PRRSV
5’ UTR, although only limited primary sequence identity
exists. We further demonstrated that the N-SL2 functional domain resided in its stem structure rather than
the ternary-loop. These results may lead to further

investigation and better understanding of the life cycle
of PRRSV, which is one of the biggest threats to the
swine industry.
We showed that the SL2 was structurally and functionally conserved in two genotypes of PRRSV. Next, we
investigated if a similar structure could also be found in
other arteriviruses and coronaviruses? Snijder and

co-workers have done extensive studies on EAV, the
prototypic species of Areriviridae [4,27]. By combining
in silico analysis and structure probing, they have proposed that the structure model for the 5’ proximal EAV
genome consists of a series of stem-loop structures that
range from A to J. The third stem-loop structure (C)
also contains a G-C rich base pair stem (6/8) [4].
Further secondary structure MFold predictions of the 5’
UTR sequences of other arteriviruses including lactate
dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV, SL2) and simian
hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV, SL3) were conducted.
Surprisingly, a similar structure (SL2) that comprises a
ternary-loop and a G-C rich base pair stem (7/9) exists
in LDV (Figure 7), which suggests that SL2 is a structurally conserved element in arteriviruses. Whether these
similar structures also regulate viral sg mRNA synthesis
is worthy of further investigation. We then made a similar comparison with 5’ UTR structure models of various
coronaviruses, another family member of the Nidovirales
[14,15,34,35]. Although significantly different structural

Figure 7 Similar N-SL2 RNA secondary structure can be
predicted from arteriviruses and coronaviruses. Arteriviruses
presented are PRRSV strains APRRSV (GenBank: GQ330474) and
Lelystad (M96262), SHFV strain LVR 42-0/M6941 (NC_003092), and
LDV strain Plagemann (NC_001639). For coronaviruses, presented
strains were PEDV strain CV777 (NC_003436), MHV strain A59
(NC_001846) and BCoV strain Quebec (AF220295).

models exist among the coronaviruses, similar G-C rich
base pair stem-loops can also be predicted in porcine
epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (7/13, SL4), MHV (10/
17, SL4) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (7/10, SL1),
which suggests that N-SL2 is a structural element that
is conserved in the order Nidovirales (Figure 7).
We demonstrated here that the structurally conserved
SL2 was vital for PRRSV sg mRNA transcription. It has
been structurally and functionally confirmed that the
LTH is an independent transcription-regulating element
in the EAV system [4,27], and such an LTH is indeed
shared by other arteriviruses. Whether the LTH and
SL2 described in our study are independent or cooperative cis-acting elements that control sg mRNA transcription is still unknown, and further functional study of
PRRSV LTH is under way.
We observed a very interesting phenomenon that
mutant D5 can restore viral infectivity through creating
an alternative N-SL2-like structure, N-SL2’, which
further signifies the high-order structural nature of NSL2. The alternative N-SL2’ was generated by rearranging the remaining SL2 sequences after D5 deletions
and part of the upstream N-SL1 sequences. Meanwhile,
the 5’ proximal sequences of N-SL1 interacted with 3’end sequences of N-SL5 to form a tertiary alternative
N-SL1’, which suggests that tertiary structural regulating
elements do play a role in PRRSV RNA synthesis control. It is of interest to study whether N-SL1 and the
alternative N-SL1’ regulate sg mRNA transcription, and
if this is that case, how it would work in synchrony with
SL2 and/or LTH. The generation of N-SL1’ seems to be
based on base pairing between the partially complementary sequences. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that such tertiary interactions could be facilitated
by RNA-protein-RNA interaction, which has been established as a major way for viral component conformational changes. For instance, the 5’ UTR of severe acute
respiratory syndrome virus genomic RNA can be specifically bound by the 3a protein, and a 55-kDa cellular
protein has been found to bind to MHV 5’ genome terminus [36,37]. Precedents in other positive-strand RNA
viruses [38-41] lead us to speculate that stem-loop 2 or
other stem-loop structures in PRRSV may bind viral or
cellular proteins in the positive-strand. In mutant D6,
N-SL2 was completely destroyed and changed to linear
nucleotides. We speculate why mutant D6 could not
recreate an alternative stem-loop 2 in the same way as
mutant D5. It is possible that the free energy of the secondary structure will make the difference. In fact, the
single-strand form of N-SL2 would make the whole 5’
terminal region more stable (free energy = -73.00 kcal/
mol), relative to creating a new stem-loop 2 (free energy =
-72.60 kcal/mol). In addition, the lengthy deletion of D6
mutant may bring about overt changes in the overall

Lu et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:172
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/172

structure of the 5’ proximal region and/or the whole
genome, so that any restoration is impossible.
Upon entry into the cells, arterivirus replication cycle
starts with uncoating the translational of the nonstructural proteins that ultimately assemble into replication
and transcription complex (RTC). RTC is responsible
for initiation of negative-strand genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNA templates, based on which progeny
genomic RNAs and mRNAs for structural proteins were
synthesized. The translated structural proteins are then
assembled into virions, starting with encapsidation of
progeny genome by encapsidation (Snijder and Mulenberge, 1998). Nidovirus is believed to adopt ribosomal
leaky-scanning model for the expression of the mRNAs
[5] The Snijder group has provided experimental evidences for such leaky scanning translation for EAV
mRNAs, for which the 5’ UTR probably has no function
[42]. In this study, we tested each mutant for non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) translation levels, and found no
significant difference among the different mutants (data
not shown). Nevertheless, it is intriguing that none of
the SL2 mutations described here affected anti-genomic
RNA template synthesis, yet the subgenomic RNA
synthesis in both senses were affected. Locating on the
5’ -proximal genomic ends, SL2 may exert regulatory
function via interaction with the 3’ -end via RNA-RNA,
or RNA-protein-protein-RNA interactions. Such genomic end long-range interactions have been well documented in flaviviruses [43-47]. It remains unknown if
such genomic cyclization could occur in arteriviruses,
but it was reported that both PRRSV and SHFV 3’ UTR
interact with host cell proteins.
The genome packaging signals (Ps) of arteriviruses are
unknown. Because that PRRSV could package defective
(heteroclite) RNAs, consisting of PRRSV genomic termini, Yuan et al. proposed that the Ps for PRRSV genome possibly localizes in the 5’ proximal ends [48]. We
presented here that SL2 mutations could produce similar intracellular viral RNAs, yet the phenotypic properties varied. It is reasonable to speculate that the SL2
mutation could brought about change of the local or
overall genomic high-order structure, such that the
genomic encapsulation or genomic versus mRNA ratio
were altered, as described in EX.

Conclusion
Here, we have focused on the PRRSV 5’ UTR to gain
further insight into the structure and function of it. By
in silico analysis of two types of PRRSV 5’ UTR, we presented a conserved stem-loop structure between them.
Firstly, this structure could be exchanged between different genotypes of PRRSV. Secondly, through a series
of deletions and substitutions in the full-length
infectious clone of PRRSV type II, we determined the

functional significances of the potential stem-loop (SL)
structure in PRRSV 5’ UTR. Finally, we presented
evidence that this SL structure was a key structural
element for PRRSV sg mRNAs synthesis.
