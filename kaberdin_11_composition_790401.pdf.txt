Composition and conservation of the
mRNA-degrading machinery in bacteria
Vladimir R Kaberdin1,2,3*†, Dharam Singh1† and Sue Lin-Chao1*

Abstract
RNA synthesis and decay counteract each other and therefore inversely regulate gene expression in pro- and
eukaryotic cells by controlling the steady-state level of individual transcripts. Genetic and biochemical data
together with recent in depth annotation of bacterial genomes indicate that many components of the bacterial
RNA decay machinery are evolutionarily conserved and that their functional analogues exist in organisms
belonging to all kingdoms of life. Here we briefly review biological functions of essential enzymes, their
evolutionary conservation and multienzyme complexes that are involved in mRNA decay in Escherichia coli and
discuss their conservation in evolutionarily distant bacteria.
1. mRNA turnover and its role in gene expression
In contrast to metabolically stable DNA serving as a
storehouse of genetic information, the fraction of total
RNA that delivers coding information to the proteinsynthesizing machinery (i.e. mRNA) is intrinsically labile
and continuously synthesized. The steady-state level of
mRNA is tightly controlled enabling bacteria to selectively copy (transcribe) and decode genetic information
pertinent to a particular physiological state (Figure 1).
Since the steady-state level of mRNA can vary and is a
function of RNA synthesis and decay, the control of
mRNA stability plays an essential role in the regulation
of gene expression. As transcription and translation are
coupled in bacteria, the degree of their coupling can
control the access of individual transcripts to the RNA
decay machinery, thus influencing the rate of mRNA
turnover. For more information about the crosstalk
between translation and mRNA decay in bacteria and its
regulation by environmental factors, we recommend
some recent reviews (see [1-5]).
The ability of bacteria to rely on remarkably diverse
metabolic pathways in order to adopt and strive in different environmental niches suggests that the nature
and number of enzymatic activities involved in specific
metabolic pathways including mRNA turnover can
greatly vary from species to species. Hence, an analysis

of the putative organization and composition of bacterial
mRNA decay machineries that belong to phylogenetically distant species should enable us to gain critical
insights into the evolution of RNA decay pathways and
their conservation in bacteria. The main objective of
this review was therefore to assess the evolutionary conservation of RNases and ancillary factors that are
involved in mRNA turnover and briefly discuss their
specific roles in this process.

2. Enzymes with major and ancillary functions in
mRNA turnover and their phylogenetic
conservation in bacteria
Early studies on RNA processing and decay in E. coli, a
Gram-negative bacterium that belongs to the gamma
division of proteobacteria, revealed several endoribonucleases (cleave RNA internally), exoribonucleases
(sequentially remove mononucleotides from either the 5’
or the 3’-end of RNA) and other RNA-modifying
enzymes with important functions in mRNA turnover
(Table 1). The specific roles of these enzymes as well as
their functional homologues found in another model
organism, the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis,
have been reviewed recently [5]. Here, we focus on the
phylogenetic conservation of the major RNases (e.g.,
RNase E, polynucleotide phosphorylase, RNase II) and
ancillary RNA-modifying enzymes (RNA pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH), poly(A) polymerase I (PAPI) and
RNA helicase B (RhlB)) involved in the turnover of
mRNAs in bacteria. Previous bioinformatic approaches

Figure 1 RNA synthesis and turnover as part of the gene
expression network in bacteria. Different types of RNA (mRNAs,
ribosomal and transfer RNA pre-cursors and various non-coding
RNAs) either can directly be involved in translation (e.g. mRNAs) or
undergo further processing (pre-cursors of stable RNA) or
degradation (untranslated or poorly translated mRNAs) by the RNA
decay machinery. The final products of RNA turnover,
mononucleotides, are used for the next cycles of RNA synthesis
(recycling).

have revealed that several mRNA-degrading enzymes are
not strictly conserved and can be absent in some classes
of bacteria [6,7]. The availability of new genomic data
and discovery of novel RNases in bacteria prompted us
to re-assess the phylogenetic conservation of these
enzymes in bacterial species for which the sequence of
the entire genome is available. The potential presence of
mRNA degrading and mRNA-modifying ancillary
enzymes was examined in all classes of bacteria by
searching for the corresponding annotated genes and
protein sequences available in the NCBI database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. The result of this analysis leads
to several important conclusions regarding the nature
and occurrence of RNases, ancillary enzymes (see 2.1
and 2.2) and their multienzyme assemblies (see 2.3) in
evolutionarily distant species.
2.1 Conservation and diversity of major enzymes
controlling the endoribonucleolytic decay of mRNA

Despite their indispensable functions in the processing
of ribosomal and transfer RNA in E. coli, three major
endoribonucleases, RNase E, RNase III and RNase P
unequally contribute to mRNA decay. With few exceptions [8,9], the endoribonucleolytic decay of E. coli transcripts primarily involves RNase E and sometimes
RNase III (reviewed in [10]). Moreover, previous studies
of mRNA decay pathways in E. coli demonstrated the
key role of RNase E, a member of the RNase E/G family
of ribonucleases, in carrying out the first endoribonucleolytic cleavages initiating the ribonucleolytic decay of
E. coli transcripts (reviewed in [11]). Although homologues of RNase E/G are predicted to be present in many
bacterial species, they are either partially or completely

Page 2 of 12

absent in some phyla of bacteria (Figure 2). The lack of
genes coding for this endoribonuclease suggests that
either (i) the main functions of RNase E/G are occasionally taken over by other endoribonucleases or that (ii)
RNase E/G is redundant for RNA processing and decay
in some species.
The first possibility is supported by a recent analysis of
RNA processing and decays in B. subtilis (class Firmicutes) [12-14]. Despite the discovery of RNase E-like cleavages in this bacterium [15], they were subsequently
attributed to the action of two B. subtilis endoribonucleases (RNases J1 and J2) that bear primarily functional
rather than sequence homology to their E. coli counterpart. Both RNase J1 and J2 were suggested to functionally
represent RNase E/G in B. subtilis by mimicking the ability of RNase E to make endoribonucleolytic cuts in a 5’end-dependent manner [12] as well as its property to
form multienzyme complexes [13,14]. Interestingly, one
recent study reported the existence and characterization
of another B. subtilis endoribonuclease, RNase Y, and
suggested that this enzyme is also functionally related to
RNase E/G, in particular with regard to its role in mRNA
turnover [16]. Consistent with this suggestion, we found
that RNase Y appears to occur more frequently than
RNases J1/J2 in the phyla that lack RNase E/G (Figure 2).
In contrast to Firmicutes, Actinomycetes and other
phylas of bacteria whose members can apparently survive without RNase E/G by using its functional homologues, RNase Y and/or RNases J1/J2, some bacterial
species seem to be able to carry out RNA processing
and decay even in the absence of all these endoribonuclases (i.e., RNase E/G, RNase Y, and RNases J1/J2).
Examples are some pathogenic bacteria that belong to
the clades of Deinococcus, Dictyoglomy, Spirochaetales
and Tenericutes. Many of these pathogens lack genes
encoding not only the above endoribonucleases but also
many exonucleases (see also 2.2).
Several studies revealed that the 5’-phosphorylation
status of mRNA can control the efficiency of cleavages
by RNase E/G homologues [17-21] as well as by RNases
J1/J2 [12] and RNase Y [16]. As the E. coli pyrophosphohydrolase RppH (initially designated NudH/YgdP)
is able to facilitate RNase E cleavage of primary transcripts by 5’ pyrophosphate removal [22], we examined
the presence of nudH/ygdP genes in genomes of phylogenetically distant bacteria. Despite the apparent
absence of these genes in many classes of bacteria
(Figure 2), their homologues that belong to the same
family of Nudix hydrolases are known to be widely
present in all three domains of life (reviewed in [23]).
Therefore, it seems likely that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase-mediated stimulation of mRNA decay in some
bacterial species involves other members of the Nudix
family of hydrolases.

2.2 Conservation and diversity of major enzymes
controlling exoribonucleolytic decay of mRNA

A search for putative homologues of the three major
mRNA-degrading exoribonucleases of E. coli (polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), RNase II and RNase
R) in other bacteria revealed that the corresponding
genes can be found in nearly every class of bacteria
(Figure 2). Although these observations suggest that
mRNA decay in the majority of bacteria could be
dependent on all three exoribonucleases, the actual contribution of each exoribonuclease to mRNA decay in
these species may differ, as anticipated from previous
studies of exonucleolytic decay of mRNA in B. subtilis
(Firmicutes) and E. coli (Proteobacteria). These studies

revealed that, in contrast to apparently similar roles of
RNase II and PNPase in the degradation of E. coli
mRNA [24], only PNPase plays a central role in the 3’exonucleolytic decay of B. subtilis mRNA [25] with
apparently less significant contribution of other exoribonucleases [25] including RNase PH [26], RNase R [27]
and YhaM [28]. This is consistent with the previous
finding that the 3’-to-5’ exonuleolytic mRNA decay in B.
subtilis, contrary to RNA turnover in E. coli, primarily
proceeds through an “energy-saving” phosphorolytic
pathway [29] mediated by PNPase. Further studies will
be necessary to address systematically how phylogenetically distant bacteria combine different sets of exoribonucleases to carry out mRNA decay. Finally, given the

and turnover of bacterial transcripts are indicated by colored filled circles (from ‘a’ to ‘l’, respectively). The percentage of organisms in

high degree of phylogenetic conservation of PNPase and
RNase II, it seems reasonable that one of the key ancillary enzymes, PAPI, which assists PNPase and RNase II
in the degradation of structured RNAs, is likewise present in most of the bacteria, as shown in Figure 2.
2.3. Conservation of mRNA-degrading multienzyme
complexes

Many E. coli mRNAs have relatively short half-lives (2-4
min) and are normally degraded in vivo without accumulation of intermediate products (reviewed in [30]), a
phenomenon frequently referred to as the ‘all-or-nothing’ mechanism of mRNA turnover. The high processivity of mRNA decay is often discussed with reference to
the coordinated action of ribonucleolytic enzymes and
ancillary proteins that can associate with each other to
form multienzyme ribonucleolytic complexes such as
the E. coli degradosome (Figure 3A, [31-33]) and the
bacterial exosome-like complex (Figure 3B) [34,35].
Analyses of the E. coli degradosome revealed that RNase
E serves as a “scaffolding” protein, through the C-terminal part of which other interacting protein partners
such as PNPase (exoribonuclease), RhlB (DEAD-box
helicase) and enolase (glycolytic enzyme) are bound

Page 5 of 12

[36,37]. Consistent with these reports, the existence of
functional interactions between the major components
of the degradosome was confirmed in vivo [38-43] and
in vitro [33,44]. Apart from binding to RNase E, two
major components of the E. coli degradosome, PNPase
and RhlB helicase, were shown to form a complex
resembling the eukaryotic exosome, a multienzyme
assembly with RNA-hydrolyzing and RNA-unwinding
activities (reviewed in [35]). The formation and functions of this complex in E. coli may not be unusual as
both enzymes appear to exist in excess to RNase E in
vivo and therefore can be involved in alternative protein-protein interactions. However, the actual contribution of this complex to RNA metabolism in bacteria
remains to be determined. mRNA molecules that are
degraded by these multiprotein assemblies (i.e., degradosome and exosome) are simultaneously exposed to several ribonucleolytic and other RNA-modifying activities
and therefore undergo fast and coordinated decay without accumulation of detectable amounts of intermediate
products.
Although significant progress has been achieved in the
characterization of the E. coli degradosome (reviewed in
[45]), our current knowledge of the composition and

endoribonuclease (RNase E), a 3’®5’ exoribonuclease (polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase)), a DEAD-box RNA helicase (RhlB helicase), and the
glycolytic enzyme enolase [31-33]). (B) In E. coli, PNPase is associated with the RhlB independently of the RNA degradosome to form an
evolutionarily conserved RNA-degradation machine termed as the “bacterial exosome” [34,35]. This complex was shown to catalyze the 3’® 5’
exonucleolytic degradation of RNA using RhlB as cofactor to unwind structured RNA in an ATP-dependent manner.

properties of similar complexes in other bacteria is still
very limited. A previous comparison of RNase E/G
sequences revealed that the C-terminal half of E. coli
RNase E (residues 499-1061), which is involved in protein-protein interactions with other major components
of the E. coli degradosome, is poorly conserved among
RNase E/G homologues [36]. Despite the overall lack of
conservation, the PNPase-binding site of E. coli RNase E
(residues 1021-1061, see [37]) is known to possess high
similarity to a short amino acid sequence found in H.
influenza Rd RNase E (residues 896-927, [36]). Moreover, this sequence is highly conserved among RNase E/
G homologues of certain g-proteobacteria (e.g., Erwinia,
Shigella, and Citrobacter) and therefore is presently
annotated in the NCBI database as the PNPase-binding
domain. The conservation of this domain (although primarily in enterobacterial species) is also supported by a
recent analysis of Vibrio angustum S14 RNase E [46].
This study defined the last 80 amino acids at the C-terminus of Vibrio angustum S14 RNase E as the potential
site for PNPase binding and revealed the putative enolase-binding domain, a region also highly conserved
amongst enterobacteria [47,48]. Collectively, the above
findings and genomic data suggest that degradosomelike complexes are widespread in enterobacteria and
organized in a similar manner.
In contrast to the apparently similar organization of
enterobacterial degradosomes, their counterparts in
other subclasses of g-proteobacteria are less conserved.
For instance, an analysis of the degradosome composition in the psychrotolerant g-proteobacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis revealed that RNase E
associates with PNPase and RhlB but not with enolase
[49]. Moreover, a different degradosome-like complex
consisting of RNase E, the hydrolytic exoribonuclease
RNase R, and the DEAD-box helicase RhlE was purified from another psychrotrophic g-proteobacterium,
Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W [50]. As RNA structures
are more stable at low temperatures and RNase R can
degrade structural RNAs more efficiently than PNPase
[51], the presence of RNase R (rather than PNPase) in
this complex may be more advantageous for the degradosome-mediated decay in this psychrotrophic bacterium. RNase E-based degradosomes have also been
isolated from other subclasses of proteobacteria. Hardwick and co-workers have recently isolated and characterized an RNase E-containing complex from the
Gram-negative a-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus [52]. Apart from RNase E, this complex was found
to contain PNPase, a DEAD-box RNA helicase and
aconitase, an iron-dependent enzyme involved in the
tricarboxylic acid cycle. One can envisage that, similar
to its mycobacterial counterpart [53], C. crescentus
aconitase may possess RNA-binding properties, and

Page 6 of 12

therefore can potentially modulate the efficiency and/or
specificity of the degradosome-mediated RNA decay.
More significant differences in the composition of degradosomes can be found in other a-proteobacteria. It has
been shown that RNase E of Rhodobacter capsulatis
forms a degradosome-like complex with two DEAD-box
RNA helicases of 74 and 65 kDa and the transcription
termination factor Rho [54]. Thus, the degradosomedependent mRNA decay appears to involve different
combinations of enzymatic activities even within the
same class of bacteria.
In addition to analyzing the composition of degradosome complexes in Proteobacteria, some efforts were
dedicated to identify degradosome-like complexes in
Actinobacteria. These studies revealed that, similar to
their E. coli counterpart, RNase E/G homologues can
interact with PNPase in Streptomyces [55] and are able
to co-purify with GroEL and metabolic enzymes in
Mycobacteria [56]. The specific role of these polypeptides in RNA metabolism and the degree, to which their
interaction with RNase E/G is conserved in Actinobacteria, remains to be established.
Aside from degradosome complexes that are believed
to function in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, the
existence of RNase E-based degradosomes in other
classes of bacteria remains questionable. The small size
(ca. 450-600 a.a., see Table 2) of RNase E/G homologues
in many other classes of bacteria indicate that they primarily contain the evolutionarily conserved catalytic
core of the enzyme and appear to lack regions serving
as scaffolds for degradosome assembly [36,57].
Interestingly, recent studies demonstrated that the
Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis (Firmicutes) possesses
degradosome-like complexes, in which RNase E is represented by its functional homologues, RNases J1/J2 and
RNase Y, interacting with PNPase, phosphofructokinase
and enolase [13]. Further characterization of these complexes and elucidation of their specific roles in mRNA
decay in B. subtilis and related species can offer many
important insights into the mechanisms underlying
mRNA decay in Firmicutes, the largest group of Grampositive bacteria that have been studied so far [58].

pathways in E. coli
3.1 Both endo- and exoribonucleases act cooperatively
to control mRNA decay

Despite phylogenetic conservation (Figure 2) and their
apparent diversity (for a review, see [10]), mRNA
decay pathways in E. coli are believed to include a
number of common enzymatic steps catalyzed by ribonucleases and several ancillary mRNA-modifying
enzymes. To discuss the role of each enzyme, we will
refer to a unified model of mRNA turnover. According

to this model (Figure 4A), conversion of E. coli
mRNAs into their primary decay intermediates is frequently initiated by endoribonucleolytic cuts catalyzed
by endoribonucleases specific for single- (e.g., RNase
E/G) or double-stranded (RNase III) RNA. This step
can be preceded (but not always, see [59]) by pyrophosphate removal (see below). During the initial endoribonucleolytic step, bacterial RNase E/G (or its
functional homologues, RNases J1/J2 or RNase Y)
attacks the full-length monophosphorylated (or sometimes triphosphorylated [59]) mRNAs to generate primary decay intermediates that are further degraded
cooperatively by the combined action of endo- and
exoribonucleases (Figure 4A). In E coli, the later steps
of mRNA decay were shown to involve PNPase and
RNase II, or occasionally RNase R [51,60], which
further degrade mRNA decay intermediates to yield
short oligonucleotides that are, in turn, converted to
mononucleotides by oligoribonuclease [61].

3.2 Ancillary enzymes facilitate mRNA turnover by
assisting ribonucleases

In addition to the major degrading enzymes, a number
of ancillary mRNA-modifying enzymes can facilitate
mRNA turnover (Table 1). In fact, pyrophosphate
removal at the 5’-end and addition of a single-stranded,
poly(A) extension at the 3’-end are two critical steps in
the mRNA decay pathway promoting mRNA cleavage in
E. coli and presumably in other proteobacteria. In general, however, the participation of these enzymes in
mRNA decay in some bacterial species or organelles is
not required (see section 2). One of these enzymes,
RppH, was shown to accelerate mRNA decay by converting the 5’-triphosphate group of primary transcripts
to 5’ monophosphate, thereby rendering mRNA species
that are more efficiently recognized and cleaved by
RNase E [17,18] and RNase G [19].
Unlike RppH, whose action promotes endoribonucleolytic cleavages, some mRNA-modifying enzymes can

Figure 4 Current unified model of mRNA decay pathways in Escherichia coli. (A) Schematic representation of major enzymatic steps
involved in the disintegration and complete turnover of primary transcripts in E. coli. The decay of a regular transcript is usually initiated by
endonucleolytic cleavage to generate primary decay intermediates that are further converted to short oligoribonucleotides by the combined
action of exo- and endoribonucleases. The oligoribonucleotides are further degraded into mononucleotides by oligoribonuclease. (B) Ancillary
enzymes facilitating mRNA turnover and their modes of action. Degradation of mRNA can be stimulated via pyrophosphate removal by RppH,
which converts 5’-triphosporylated primary transcripts into their monophosphorylated variants, thus facilitating their endoribonucleolytic cleavage
by RNase E [22,76] or by RNases J1/J2 [12] or by RNase Y [16] in B. subtilis. As the action of exoribonucleases can be inhibited by 3’-terminal
stem-loop structures, two groups of ancillary RNA-modifying enzymes, PAPI and RhlB, help exonucleases to overcome this inhibitory effect. PAPI
exerts its action by adding short stretches of adenosine residues, thereby facilitating exonuclease binding and subsequent cleavage of structured
RNAs [10]. Enzymes of the second group, DEAD-box helicases such as E. coli RhlB, increase the efficiency of the exonuclease-dependent decay
by unwinding double-stranded RNA regions in an ATP-dependent fashion.

stimulate degradation by 3’ to 5’ exonucleases (reviewed
in [62,63]). Previous work has shown that the 3’ to 5’
degradation of transcripts by PNPase and RNase II in E.
coli proceeds only efficiently on unstructured mRNAs
and is impeded by stable stem-loop structures occurring
internally (e.g., in intergenic regions of polycistronic transcripts such as REP stabilizers found in the malEFG and
many other intergenic regions [39]) or at the 3’ end of
bacterial transcripts (i.e., transcription terminators [64]).
These structures typically cause exoribonuclease stalling
and subsequent dissociation of exoribonucleases from
decay intermediates (reviewed in [62,63]). To prevent
accumulation of decay intermediates that are resistant to
3’ to 5’ degradation by exoribonucleses, E. coli and apparently other bacteria employ a mechanism that increases
the susceptibility of an mRNA decay intermediate to exonucleases by adding a poly(A) tail to its 3’ end (Figure
4B). Consequently, repetitive cycles of poly(A) addition
carried out by PAPI combined with exonuclease-catalyzed
trimming was shown to result in the complete digestion
of structured RNAs by either PNPase or RNase II in vitro
[65]. Consistent with these findings, mRNA decay in a
mutant lacking functional PAPI results in the accumulation of intermediate products of mRNA decay [64,66-69],
thus indicating that the addition of poly(A) tails is indeed
required for the normal mRNA turnover in E. coli.
Because several aspects of poly(A)-assisted mRNA turnover including its role in the decay of stable RNA fall
beyond the scope of this review, the interested reader is
referred to other work covering this topic [70].
In E. coli, the exonucleolytic decay of highly structured
RNAs can also be assisted by the RhlB (Figure 4B). This
enzyme unwinds RNA structures in an ATP-dependent
manner and therefore facilitates their degradation by exonucleases in vivo [39] and in vitro [33,34]. Moreover, RhlB
is an integral part of the multienzyme RNA degradosome
and exosome-like complexes and believed to exert its
functions primarily as component of the mRNA decay
machinery.

4. Conclusion and perspectives
A previous analysis of RNA processing/decay pathways
in several distantly-related bacterial species including
the two major model organisms, E. coli (Proteobacteria)
and B. subtilis (Firmicutes) has identified the key ribonucleases involved in mRNA turnover in bacteria
(reviewed in [5]). Herein, a search for their homologues
in bacteria with completely sequenced genomes revealed
that many components of the bacterial mRNA decay
machinery (RNase III and three major exoribonucleases,
PNPase, RNase II and RNase R) as well as PAPI and
RhlB) are highly conserved across the bacterial kingdom
(see Figure 2). In contrast, the major endoribonucleases
RNase E/G, RNases J1/J2, and RNase Y possess only

Page 9 of 12

functional (but not sequence) conservation. Although
they were found only in particular classes of bacteria, at
least one of them is present in nearly every species.
Thus, although RNA processing/decay in phylogenetically distant bacterial species is not necessarily carried
out by the same set of ribonucleolytic enzymes (see previous sections), the minimal set of enzymatic activities
(at least one functional homologue of RNase E/G and
one 3’ to 5’ exoribonuclease) required for mRNA turnover in prokaryotic organisms is likely conserved in a
vast majority of bacterial species.
Surprisingly, the number of enzymes with potential
roles in RNA processing and decay is dramatically
reduced in several intracellular pathogens possessing
relatively small (less than 1 Mbp) genomes (e.g., Mycoplasma (Tenericutes), Rickettsia (a-Proteobacteria) and
Chlamydia (Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia group)). In
contrast to the presence of seven distinct exoribonucleases in E. coli, only one of them can be found in
Mycoplasma (subclass Mollicutes (Tenericutes)). Analysis of RNA metabolism in Mycoplasma genitalium suggests that exonucleolytic decay in this bacterium can
be accomplished by a single exoribonuclease, RNase R
[71]. Another prominent feature of Mycoplasma is the
lack of genomic sequences potentially encoding a
homologues of E. coli PAPI known to catalyze the
addition of poly(A) to the 3’ end of E. coli transcripts
[72]. The lack of this enzyme is consistent with the
recent finding that demonstrated the absence of polyadenylated RNA in Mycoplasma [73]. Although the poly
(A)-dependent enhancement of mRNA decay is likely
redundant for some intracellular pathogens, it seems to
be more important in some Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, as it can offer an additional mean to control the
efficiency of mRNA turnover. In other words, unlike
pathogens that continuously reside in host cells, bacteria that strive in highly diverse and continuously
changing environments (e.g., Escherichia coli) use a
large number of ribonucleases and ancillary mRNAmodifying enzymes such as poly(A) polymerases to efficiently regulate mRNA stability in response to environmental signals. Future studies addressing the main
differences between the mechanisms of mRNA decay
of intracellular pathogens and the currently used
model organisms (E. coli and B. subtilis) may lead to
important insights concerning the evolution of the
mRNA decay machinery in bacteria.
Similar to other essential cellular processes controlling
inheritance and expression of genetic information (i.e.,
DNA replication, transcription and translation), mRNA
decay was found to be carried out by multienzyme complexes, several of which have been isolated from Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes over the last two
decades. The existence of functional interactions between

Kaberdin et al. Journal of Biomedical Science 2011, 18:23
http://www.jbiomedsci.com/content/18/1/23

the major components of the E. coli degradosome and
their impact on mRNA turnover [38-43] suggest that
multienzyme complexes (instead of a pull of non-interacting enzymes) are favorable for attaining a higher efficiency of mRNA decay. The role of similar complexes in
other bacteria is still poorly defined. Moreover, we do not
know to which degree RNase E/G-based degradosomes
resemble their counterparts containing RNases J1/J2 or
RNase Y existing in many other classes of bacteria. Likewise, the mechanisms modulating the composition, activity and specificity of these multienzyme assemblies in
response to changing physiological conditions remain largely unknown and merit further analysis. Finally,
although the last step of mRNA decay in E. coli has been
shown to be accomplished by oligoribonuclease encoded
by the orn gene [61], this gene is apparently absent in
many other bacterial species (Figure 2). A search for
activities that can degrade RNA oligoribonucleotides in
Firmicutes lacking sequence homologues of E. coli oligoribonuclease led to the discovery of B. subtilis Ytq1 [74].
This enzyme possesses an oligoribonuclease-like activity
and is able to complement the E. coli orn mutant; homologues of its gene are present in many bacteria [75].
Although Ytq1 can be considered as a functional homologue of oligoribonuclease, further efforts are needed to
disclose the nature and distribution of functional homologues that may exist in bacterial species lacking both oligoribonuclease and Ytq1.
