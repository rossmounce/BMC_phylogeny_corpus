Abstract
Background: The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code suggests that the genetic
code is an imprint of the biosynthetic relationships between amino acids. However, this theory
does not seem to attribute a role to the biosynthetic relationships between the earliest amino acids
that evolved along the pathways of energetic metabolism. As a result, the coevolution theory is
unable to clearly define the very earliest phases of genetic code origin. In order to remove this
difficulty, I here suggest an extension of the coevolution theory that attributes a crucial role to the
first amino acids that evolved along these biosynthetic pathways and to their biosynthetic
relationships, even when defined by the non-amino acid molecules that are their precursors.
Results: It is re-observed that the first amino acids to evolve along these biosynthetic pathways
are predominantly those codified by codons of the type GNN, and this observation is found to be
statistically significant. Furthermore, the close biosynthetic relationships between the sibling amino
acids Ala-Ser, Ser-Gly, Asp-Glu, and Ala-Val are not random in the genetic code table and reinforce
the hypothesis that the biosynthetic relationships between these six amino acids played a crucial
role in defining the very earliest phases of genetic code origin.
Conclusion: All this leads to the hypothesis that there existed a code, GNS, reflecting the
biosynthetic relationships between these six amino acids which, as it defines the very earliest
phases of genetic code origin, removes the main difficulty of the coevolution theory. Furthermore,
it is here discussed how this code might have naturally led to the code codifying only for the
domains of the codons of precursor amino acids, as predicted by the coevolution theory. Finally,
the hypothesis here suggested also removes other problems of the coevolution theory, such as the
existence for certain pairs of amino acids with an unclear biosynthetic relationship between the
precursor and product amino acids and the collocation of Ala between the amino acids Val and Leu
belonging to the pyruvate biosynthetic family, which the coevolution theory considered as
belonging to different biosyntheses.

Background
Why the genetic code originated
There are two completely different interpretations on why
the genetic code might have originated. The first is
obtained by means of an extreme interpretation of the
stereochemical hypothesis of genetic code origin which
suggests that the genetic code originated because its
organisation is somehow constrained by the stereochemical relationships between codons or anticodons and
amino acids. This extreme interpretation seems totally
absurd to me. The second interpretation that I am aware
of has to do with the origin of peptidyl-tRNA: the key
intermediate in the origin of protein synthesis.

Peptidyl-tRNA has no function per se, but in some models
it has been assumed that the entire catalysis of the protocell was originally performed by this intermediate [1-4].
Its origin might therefore have been determined by interactions between covalent complexes of peptide and RNA
(peptide-RNAs) and these interactions might have constituted one of the most elementary forms of protein synthesis [3,4]. This model shows that the interactions between
peptide-RNAs must, at a certain evolutionary stage, have
been directed by a template (pre-mRNA) which must have
originally codified only the succession of interactions
between peptide-RNAs [4]. This pre-mRNA is the most
ancestral form of mRNA imaginable [4]. Finally, the evolution of these pre-mRNAs must have resulted in an
mRNA codifying only for a limited number of amino
acids [4]. This is the phase that defines the very origin of
the genetic code. Clearly this is an historic interpretation
of genetic code origin that is completely different from the
deterministic one given by the stereochemical theory.
What is particularly important as far as this paper is concerned is that the evolution of these pre-mRNAs into
mRNAs was characterised by a progressive refinement of
the interactions of the peptide-RNAs on the pre-mRNA
templates and this refinement seems to have been made
possible only when peptide-RNAs were transformed into
amino acid-pre-tRNAs [4]. This is because there might
have only been the modification, residue by residue, performed by the amino acid-pre-tRNAs on the evolving proteins that might lead to the complete specification of their
sequences, and which made possible the birth of an
mRNA proper but with codification limited to just a few
amino acids [4]. As will become clear in the following, I
maintain that these amino acid-pre-tRNAs came directly
from the biosynthetic pathways of the first six amino acids
evolving along the biosynthetic pathways of energetic
metabolism and that they were the first amino acids to be
codified on these still evolving mRNAs.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

The biosynthetic relationships between amino acids are
closely linked to the organisation of the genetic code
Ever since the genetic code was first deciphered, it has
been observed that the biosynthetic relationships between
amino acids are linked to the organisation of the genetic
code. Indeed, Nirenberg et al. [5] acknowledged the existence of a relationship between amino acids of a similar
biosynthetic origin and the codons specifying those
amino acids. Although the examples of biosynthetic relationships reported by Nirenberg et al. [5] contain some
inaccuracies, the authors were the first to suggest that the
genetic code's evolutionary development might have been
defined by the amino acids' biosyntheses. Jukes [6] also
noted that some amino acids take part in the biosynthesis
of other amino acids, such as serine which plays a part in
the biosynthesis of tryptophan. However, these seemed to
be isolated and not totally clear observations and Jukes [6]
did not believe they could be generalised for the entire
genetic code. Pelc [7] recognised that biosynthetic conversions between amino acids might have had an important
role in defining the genetic code. However, it was Dillon
[8] who, above all, suggested a metabolic model for the
origin of the genetic code, although this author suggested
amino acid biosyntheses that are only partly linked to
those existing in living organisms. It was Wong [9] who
fully recognised the importance, for the evolution of the
genetic code, of the biosynthetic relationships between
amino acids as they take place in actual organisms, suggesting what is now known as the coevolution theory of
genetic code origin. This theory suggests that the genetic
code is primarily an imprint of the biosynthetic pathways
forming amino acids [9]. Consequently the evolution of
the genetic code could be clarified on the basis of the precursor-product relationships between amino acids in their
biosyntheses [9]. In other words, this theory suggests that
only few amino acids (precursors) were codified in the
genetic code; as other amino acids (products) developed
from these, part of the codon domain of precursor amino
acids was ceded to product amino acids [9]. Therefore,
according to this theory, the genetic code might represent
an evolutionary map of the biosynthetic relationships
between amino acids [9].

While Wong [9] highlighted the precursor-product relationships between amino acids and their crucial role in
defining the organisation of the genetic code, Miseta [10]
clearly identified that the non-amino acid molecules that
were precursors of amino acids might have been able to
play an important role in organising the genetic code.
Miseta [10] suggested the idea of an intimate relationship
between molecules, the intermediates of glucose degradation, as precursors of precursor amino acids, and the
organisation of the genetic code. This observation is also
analysed by Taylor and Coates [11] who showed the relationship between the glycolytic pathway, the citric acid

cycle, the biosyntheses of amino acids and the genetic
code (Fig. 1) and, in particular, they point out that (i) all
the amino acids that are members of a biosynthetic family
tend to have codons with the same first base (Fig. 1) and
(ii) that the five amino acids codified by GNN codons are
found in four biosynthetic pathways close to or at the
beginning of the pathway head (Fig. 1)[11]. More
recently, Davis [12,13] has provided evidence that tRNAs
descending from a common ancestor were adaptors of

amino acids synthesised by a common precursor and he
also discusses the biosynthetic families of amino acids,
suggesting their importance in genetic code origin.
However, there have also been authors who have suggested that some aspects of the biosynthetic relationships
between amino acids were not important in genetic code
origin [14,15]. In particular, Ronneberg et al. [14] criticise
the coevolution theory above all because some pairs of

amino acids used by this theory do not seem to be in a
clear precursor-product amino acid relationship,
although, more generally, they recognise that amino acids
in a biosynthetic relationship tend to have codons with
the same first base [14]. Di Giulio [16] responded to the
criticisms made by Ronneberg et al [14] and, in particular,
made numerous observations in favour of the coevolution
theory. There has also been evidence indicating that the
five families of amino acids, defined in accordance with a
single amino acid precursor or a non-amino acid precursor, should have been randomly observed in the genetic
code with a probability of 6 Ã 10-5 [17]. This indicates that
the biosynthetic relationships between amino acids were
fundamental in organising the genetic code.
Finally, if we consider that other works have been carried
out on the importance of biosynthetic relationships
between amino acids and the genetic code [18-39], we
come to the conclusion that there can no longer be any
doubts on the hypothesis that the origin of the organisation of the genetic code was affected by the biosynthetic
pathways of amino acids.

Results
The extended coevolution theory
In order to eliminate some criticisms on certain pairs of
amino acids that are in an unclear precursor-product relationship [14,16] and, above all, to provide a more complete description of the very earliest phases of genetic code
origin, I have been forced to suggest the following theory.
This theory, which can be called the 'extended coevolution theory' as it is simply an extension or a generalisation
of Wong's coevolution theory [9], states that:

"The genetic code is simply an imprint of the biosynthetic relationships between amino acids, even when defined by the nonamino acid molecules that are the precursors of some amino
acids, i.e. that the organisation of the genetic code must only
reflect the biosynthetic proximity between amino acids in the
various stages of evolution of their biosynthetic pathways. This
happened because the ancestral biosynthetic pathways took
place on tRNA-like molecules and thus enabled a coevolution
between these pathways and the organisation of the genetic
code through the concession of tRNA-like molecules between
biosynthetically close amino acids, which made possible the
transfer of codons from one amino acid to another, while
mRNA evolved, with the consequence that amino acids with
correlated biosyntheses have contiguous codons in the genetic
code".
This theory, which in a contracted and informal form has
already been suggested [16], can be tested and all the evidence in favour of the coevolution theory is also in favour
of the extended coevolution theory. The key point on
which the two theories disagree regards the predictions on

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

the earliest phases of genetic code origin, which are not
well defined for the coevolution theory [9,40] while, for
the extended coevolution theory their traces should be
present in the biosynthetic relationships between amino
acids that are precursors of other amino acids and the
non-amino acid molecules that are precursors of precursor amino acids.
As shown in the following section, this main prediction of
the extended coevolution theory seems to be corroborated
by the observations.
The main prediction of the extended coevolution theory
seems to be corroborated
According to the predictions of the coevolution theory,
the codon concession mechanism between amino acids in
a precursor-product relationship was based on tRNA-like
molecules on which the theory hypothesises that biosynthetic transformations between amino acids take place
[9]. Surprisingly, this prediction is confirmed by the existence of molecular fossils [33] representing the vestiges of
these pathways (Tab. 1) hypothesised by the coevolution
theory [9,19-21]. Although these biosynthetic transformations took place in accordance with the coevolution theory, only among the amino acids in a precursor-product
relationship [9] is there no a priori reason why this should
have taken place only between amino acids [28,31]. The
coevolution theory seems to imply that all metabolism
took place at that time on tRNA-like molecules [28,31] or,
at least, that the entire metabolism of amino acids took
place on these molecules. This view, i.e. that metabolism
took place on tRNA-like molecules, has been hypothesised by other authors following arguments that might be
totally different from those used here [41-43].

Therefore, if the metabolism of amino acids took place on
tRNA-like molecules when the genetic code originated,
the structure of the genetic code must contain traces linking the very earliest phases of genetic code origin to the
biosynthetic relationships between the first amino acids
to enter the code and the non-amino acid molecules that
were their precursors. This is because the very first amino
acids that entered the genetic code and had non-amino
acid molecules as their precursors, did so, as suggested by
the extended coevolution theory, using the same mechanism employed by the pairs of amino acids in a precursorproduct relationship, i.e. exploiting the hypothetical existence of the biosynthetic pathways on the tRNA-like molecules that triggered the origin of the genetic code. This is
the main prediction of the extended coevolution theory
and how it differentiates the latter from the coevolution
theory.

amino acids that presumably first originated from the gly-

one of these amino acids that is not directly linked to one
of these non-amino acid molecules of the glucose degradation pathway (Figs, 1, 2). Although the synthesis of Gly
from Ser is well documented [9,44], the conversion of Gly
to Ser also takes place normally [9,45]. For example, Gly
is converted to Ser by reacting with formate in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate [9,45-47]. This favours the
hypothesis that these two amino acids, Ser and Gly, were
inter-convertible when these pathways originated).

If these were effectively the earliest amino acids to originate from non-amino acid precursors of the energetic
metabolism pathways (Fig. 2) and if the main prediction
of the extended coevolution theory is true, then all these
amino acids (Fig. 2) should occupy a particular place
within the genetic code table because they should be witnesses of the earliest phases of the evolution of the genetic
code. Indeed, as other authors have observed [11], with
the exception of Ser, all these amino acids (Fig. 2) are codified by codons of the GNN type. The distribution of these
amino acids on these codons is not random and is
obtained, by pure chance, with a probability equal to 3.9
Ã 10-4 (see Appendix).

are, with the exception of Gly, directly linked to nonamino acid molecules that are their precursors. (Although
the biosynthetic pathways leading to Phe and Tyr and to
His are directly linked to a non-amino acid precursor (Fig.
1), they seem too complex for an early evolution because
they have at least ten biosynthetic steps in these pathways
and so these three amino acids would evidently not fall
within this classification (see Appendix)). As suggested by
the extended coevolution theory, this might indicate that
they were the first to originate during the evolution of the
biosynthetic pathways of amino acids. (Gly is the only

Therefore, this observation that the first amino acids to
evolve along the biosynthetic pathways are the same ones
that are mostly codified by codons of the GNN type leads
us to suppose, in compliance with the extended coevolution theory, that there existed a type of primitive genetic
code (mRNA) that possessed only the codons of the type
GNC (or GNG) and codified only for the amino acids Ala,
Asp and Ser or Gly (or Ala, Glu and Ser or Gly) (Fig. 3)
from which the GNS code codifying for Val, Ala, Asp, Glu,
Ser and/or Gly (Fig. 3) might have evolved. This is suggested by exploiting the results of Ikehara et al [48] who,
for quite different reasons, suggested a genetic code origin
that is, in some respects, similar.
It should also be borne in mind that as these amino acids
are the most abundant in the experiments of prebiotic
synthesis and in meteorites [40] they had already attracted
the attention of researchers. Indeed, Eigen et al. [49] had
suggested a primitive code with codons of the GNY type,
which is partly compatible with what is maintained here,
partly because it might be derived from a GNC code (Fig.
3) [50].

Discussion
Some comments on the evolution of the genetic code, as
suggested by the extended coevolution theory
The evolution of the genetic code as suggested here needs
some discussion and clarification.

(i) Ser is not codified by any of the GNN codons whereas,
on the basis of the considerations made here, it should be.

This shows three stages of genetic code evolution. All
the abbreviations are standard. See text for discussion.

However, the fact that Ser is biosynthetically inter-convertible with Gly [9,44-47] might indicate that Ser was
codified by some or all the codons that today codify for
Gly in the GNS and SNS codes (Fig. 3), and only with the
NNS code (Fig. 4), i.e. when the codon domains of precursor amino acids were defined as predicted by the coevolution theory, did Ser cede some codons (GGS) to Gly (Fig.
4). This seems to be corroborated by the observation that,
as Ser is also codified by AGY codons contiguous to the
GGN codons of Gly, this might imply that the latter
codons codified for Ser in a previous evolutionary stage.
From the evolutionary stage (shown in Fig. 4) of the
genetic code on, the evolution of the code is fully
described by the coevolution theory [9] (see Di Giulio and
Medugno [35] for details on the entry times of amino
acids into the genetic code).
(ii) The closer biosynthetic proximity between the pairs
Ser-Ala, Ala-Val, Asp-Glu and Ser-Gly, as shown in Fig. 2,
seems to find confirmation in the genetic code structure in
that: (1) Ser-Ala and Ser-Gly have contiguous codons in
the genetic code, i.e. they differ only in a single base,
although Ser does not occupy the last row of the genetic
code; (2) the pair Asp-Glu occupies the same box in the

genetic code, i.e. their codons differ only in the third base
and these amino acids are the same ones that, at the evolutionary stage of the biosynthetic pathways as indicated
in Fig. 2, are more biosynthetically correlated; (3) the pair
Ala-Val is part of the pyruvate biosynthetic family (Fig. 1)
and their codons differ in only one base, a pyrimidine,
even if these amino acids occupy the last row of the
genetic code. All this seems to imply, in agreement with
the extended coevolution theory, that amino acid pairs
made in siblings by a non-amino acid molecule, i.e. the
pairs Ser-Ala, Ala-Val, Asp-Glu and Ser-Gly (Fig. 2), the
last of which might be in a precursor-product relationship
[9], were particularly important in the earliest phases of
genetic code origin because their organisation within the
genetic code would also seem to reflect the closer biosynthetic proximity of these pairs (Fig. 2).
(iii) The here-maintained hypothesis that the amino acids
that first evolved along the pathways of energetic metabolism (Fig. 2) formed the GNS code (Fig. 3) seems to
rationalise why Asp and Glu are codified by GAN codons
and not by ANN and CNN codons. Indeed, if the GAS
codons had been attributed early on to Asp and Glu, they
should have been both abundant on the first mRNAs and
linked to them by a stronger historic constraint. Consequently, it would have been more difficult to concede
them to product amino acids than the ANS and CNS
codons making up the codon domain of Asp and Glu
which instead must have been rare (see below) and also

Page 6 of 21

Biology Direct 2008, 3:37

less historically constrained and, thus more easily transferable to the product amino acids, as seems to have happened. Therefore, this reasoning rationalises why Asp and
Glu are codified by GAN codons and not ANN or CNN
codons. Moreover, this strengthens the hypothesis of the
existence of the GNS code for the very reason that Asp and
Glu are codified by the GAN codons and not by some of
those in ANN and CNN, as would have been more reasonable to expect considering the clearer biosynthetic relationship that Asp and Glu have with the product amino
acids of their biosynthetic family compared to the less
clear relationship they have with each other (Fig. 1). This
should have resulted in a closer similarity between codons
of Asp and Glu and codons of their product amino acids
than with their own. The fact that this did not happen
would seem to imply a very early involvement of GAN, or
rather GNS, codons in genetic code origin because Asp
and Glu are codified by these codons and not by those of
the type ANN and CNN, as would instead be imposed by
the clearer biosynthetic relationships with their product
amino acids. In short, the codification of Asp and Glu by
means of GAN codons might reflect the history of the very
earliest phases of genetic code origin.
(iv) The evolution of mRNA as defined by the passage
from the SNS (or GNS) code (Fig. 3) to the NNS code (Fig.
4) might have been highly facilitated if some codons were
rarely used on mRNAs. In other words, let us admit that,
for instance, there evolved in the SNS code: one or very
few ANS codons codifying for Asp; one or very few CNS
codons codifying for Glu: one or very few UNS codon codifying for Ser. It can be seen that in this way, all the precursor amino acid codon domains can be defined, i.e. the
NNS code (Fig. 4), paradoxically without there actually
being all their codons present. Indeed, it is sufficient for
the first base of any one codon to be recognised, although
read in triplets [51], in order to define the NNS code relatively fully. If the rarity of codons had been preserved in
the evolutionary stages following the NNS codes (Fig. 4),
then an amino acid precursor might have easily ceded part
of its codon domain to the product amino acid without
generating considerable translation noise in this transfer
of codons. Naturally, every passage between the codes
GNC (or GNG), GNS, SNS and NNS (Figs. 3, 4) must have
been characterised by the rarity of the types of codons
because the system was evolving and, for instance, the
majority of tRNA molecules had yet to evolve, i.e. there
existed very few types of tRNA molecule. In other words,
it would seem that it is the very evolution of the code that
implies codon rarity, allowing a faster and more efficient
evolution by means of the mechanism of the coevolution
theory. This leads us to suppose that the SNS form of code
might have only partly preceded the NNS form because it
would take just one codon, for instance of the ANS type,
to define an entire codon domain and, therefore, an entire

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

evolutionary stage of the genetic code. In other words, the
evolutionary stage of the SNS and NNS codes might be
less sharp than apparently shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Moreover, this indicates that the mRNA of the NNS code might
have been much simpler than appears from the same Fig.
4.
(v) Exceptions to the "rule" of precursor amino acid
codon domains seem to be the codons UUG (Leu) and
AGG (Arg) (in white in Fig. 4), but also the codon AGC
(Ser) although the latter might be derived from codons
attributed to Gly, as suggested by Wong [9], but in any
case outside the domain of Ser (Fig. 4). In other words, the
codons UUR and AGR are the only exceptions observed in
the precursor amino acid codon domains because they do
not biosynthetically belong to the codon domain of the
precursor in which they reside. However, while the
codons UUR (Leu) might have been captured with a secondary mechanism by the codons in Ser's domain, for the
AGR codons (Arg) there might exist a fascinating explanation. It is possible that the AGR codons of Arg derive from
the codon domain of Asp and not from that of Glu, which
is the natural precursor of Arg (Fig. 1) in that Asp intervenes in one of the terminal steps of the biosynthetic
pathway of Arg [14,16]. Therefore, for Arg, the CGN
codons might derive from the codon domain of Glu via
ornithine or citrulline [16], while the AGR codons might
derive from the codon domain of Asp [14,16]. This might
therefore be an extremely interesting case of a double
entry of an amino acid in the genetic code through two
different amino acid precursors, something which has
also been hypothesised for Ser [9]. This would provide a
strong corroboration for the mechanism by which amino
acids enter the genetic code, as suggested by the coevolution theory.
Finally, the CUS codons of Val (Leu) also apparently
belong to the codon domain of Glu (Fig. 4). This might
corroborate the hypothesis that these codons were ceded
from Glu to Val. Indeed, the early phases of the evolution
of NNS codes are characterised by codification limited to
only six amino acids (Fig. 4) and therefore, the relative
biosynthetic relationships might have made the amino
acids Val and Glu biosynthetic siblings (Fig. 2). Although
not entirely free of criticism, this viewpoint cannot be categorically excluded.
Nevertheless, there seems to be a much simpler interpretation provided by the SNS code (Fig. 3). Indeed, if in this
evolutionary stage all the SUS codons codified for Val
(Fig. 3) there would not have been any need for a real
transfer of codons from Glu, but this might have only
depended on the passage from the GNS to the SNS code
provided that the SUS codons continued to codify for Val
(Fig. 3).

Conclusion
The coevolution theory [9] does not give a complete
description of genetic code origin as it seems not to consider that the biosynthetic pathways of the amino acids
that first entered the genetic code were important in the
earliest phases of the origin of the code itself [9,40,52].
Whereas, with the extended coevolution theory it can be
seen that there might have existed a GNC or a GNG code,
but almost certainly a code of the GNS type, because the
amino acids codified by these codons are in a clear biosynthetic relationship by means of their precursor nonamino acid molecules (Fig. 2) at the head of the amino
acids' biosynthetic pathways and, therefore, must have
characterised the earliest phases of genetic code origin.
The extended coevolution theory explains the existence, in
the genetic code, of the pairs Phe-Tyr, Val-Leu and Thr-Met
which are not in a clear biosynthetic relationship of precursor-product amino acids [14], by means of mere biosynthetic proximity. This is because, as the ancestral
biosynthetic pathways take place on tRNA-like molecules,
they enabled these biosynthetically close amino acids to
have similar codons [16]. This cannot be achieved satisfactorily by the coevolution theory. For the sake of clarity
and completeness, see also the comments already made
on these amino acid pairs [16].
The coevolution theory [9] does not explain the presence
of the codons of the amino acid pair Phe-Tyr inside Ser's
codon domain (Fig. 4), whereas the extended coevolution
theory explains its existence in this very domain through
the mere biosynthetic proximity of the pathway leading to
the synthesis of Phe and Tyr to that of Ser (Fig. 1).
Finally, the coevolution theory is unable to explain why
Ala has codons contiguous to Val, even if it is clear that
these two amino acids are biosynthetically correlated in
that they are derived from pyruvate (Fig. 1). This theory
even puts Ala and the Val-Leu pair in biosynthetically different domains [9,40], which seems to be mistaken. The
extended coevolution theory, on the other hand, explains
the relationships between these amino acids derived from
the same non-amino acid precursor with the hypothesis
that their ancestral biosyntheses took place on correlated
tRNA-like molecules that allowed these amino acids to
have likewise correlated codons in the genetic code [16].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

codons, we obtain for amino acids with non-amino acid
precursors: (i) 5 of these are codified by GNN codons (=
a), while (ii) only 1 (Ser) is codified by non-GNN codons
(= b). For amino acids with amino acid precursors, we
have: (i) 0 of these are codified by GNN codons (= c), and
(ii) 14 of these are codified by non-GNN codons (= d). By
applying Fisher's exact test we obtain a probability P = 3.9
Ã 10-4 (a = 5, b = 1, c = 0, d = 14) which is highly significant.
However, it could be objected that Val is 4 biosynthetic
steps away from pyruvate, while Gly is not directly linked
to PGA (Fig. 2) and therefore might not fall within the
class of amino acids that evolved early on. To answer these
strongly dubious questions, certain checks can be carried
out.
Eliminating Val and Gly because they might not have
entered the genetic code early on from the biosynthetic
pathways' point of view (Fig. 2), we have P = 0.0035 (a =
3, b = 1, c = 0, d = 16). Therefore, under this hypothesis
too, which actually seems extremely restrictive, we obtain
a highly significant probability. Eliminating only Val
(because Gly might have evolved very early on through
interconversion with Ser [9,44-47]) or eliminating only
Gly because Val is derived directly from pyruvate in a
number of biosynthetic steps that, in qualitative terms,
evolved rapidly and are not even numerous, we obtain a P
= 0.0010 (a = 4, b = 1, c = 0, d = 15) that is still highly significant. In conclusion, these amino acids (Fig. 2) seem to
have correlated GNN codons because they evolved early
on in the ancestral biosynthetic pathways.
Finally, if we consider that His and Phe-Tyr are also
derived from non-amino acid precursors (Fig. 1), we
obtain P = 0.0081 (a = 5, b = 4, c = 0, d = 11); If we remove
Val or Gly we obtain P = 0.014 (a = 4, b = 4, c = 0, d = 12);
whereas, if both Val and Gly are removed, we obtain P =
0.031 (a = 3, b = 4, c = 0, d = 13). These probabilities indicate that considering His and Phe-Tyr as amino acids
deriving from non-amino acid precursor does not substantially alter the results of the statistical test.

It is necessary to calculate the probability with which the
amino acids Ser, Gly, Ala, Val, Asp and Glu can be
observed in the GNN codons of the genetic code while
also taking into account the distribution of the amino
acids in the non-GNN codons. Fisher's exact test seems to
be able to calculate this probability. If we consider that, of
these 6 amino acids, only Ser is not codified by GNN type

Reviewer Comments
This manuscript addresses an important question:
whether there are traces in the pattern of codon assignments in the modern genetic code of its expansion from
an earlier form, perhaps with simpler amino acids. The
author addresses this problem from the perspective of his
extensive previous work on the coevolution model, which
argues that primordial genetic codes used simple amino
acids that are produced in prebiotic syntheses and are
encoded in the modern genetic code using codons beginning with G. For example, in previous work, he argued
that the GNN-encoded amino acids Asp and Glu were
early entries into the genetic code, and that the non-GNNencoded amino acids Asn and Gln arrived later, in part
because of the distribution of the metabolic pathways
producing them and in part because of the fact that in
some organisms they are produced by tRNA-dependent
transamidation rather than by direct aminoacyl-tRNA
synthesis. In the present work, he elaborates on this theory by adding constraints on the simplest amino acids,
and presents statistical evidence that supports the idea
that this type of coevolution shaped the modern genetic
code.

[Author's Response]
No reply.
Reviewer Comments
The main issue I have with the present version of the manuscript is that it dismisses or fails to discuss other patterns
in the genetic code for which the statistical evidence is at
least as good as that presented here. This is not to say that
the manuscript fails to cite prior work adequately: for
example, the discussion of the development of the coevolutionary theory in this manuscript is very complete, and
provides a nice self-contained introduction to interested
readers. However, I believe that the contention that "we
come to the conclusion that there can no longer be any
doubts on the hypothesis that the origin of the organisation of the genetic code was affected by the biosynthetic
pathways of amino acids." is overstated given that all the
cited literature in support of this hypothesis is the work of
the present author. Similarly, the statement on page 3
"The first is obtained by means of an extreme interpretation of the stereochemical hypothesis of genetic code origin which suggests that the genetic code originated
because its organisation is somehow constrained by the
stereochemical relationships between codons or anticodons and amino acids. This extreme interpretation seems
totally absurd to me." does not adequately address the
mounting statistical evidence from several laboratories,
especially the Yarus lab, that there is a relationship
between coding triplets and modern codon assignments
that should not be ignored (although it is possible that

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

future research will provide some reason why this observation is an artifact of some currently unsuspected process). Similarly, a long list of investigators including David
Haig, Laurence Hurst, Stephen Freeland, David Ardell,
Guy Sella, etc. have found evidence that the genetic code
is error-minimizing compared to other possible genetic
codes. I believe that, to be useful, new work on the genetic
code needs either to embrace these patterns and explain
them, or to argue against them on some grounds other
than personal incredulity. After all, if the structure of the
natural world were intuitively obvious we wouldn't need
the scientific method, and it's important to take all the
available data into account.
[Author's Response]
This paper presents a modification of the coevolution theory. I do not discuss other theories on the genetic code
because, paradoxically, this is not 'the right place'. Even if
other theories are well corroborated by evidence, I feel
that my paper deals with such a specific issue â as the
reviewer also acknowledges â that it 'rules out' comments
on the other genetic code theories. On other occasions, I
have not failed to tackle the problem raised by the referee
[55,56] (see also below)).
The reviewer is making a serious claim: namely, that the
biosynthetic relationships between amino acids are not in
relation with the organisation of the genetic code. For
instance, if we apply Fisher's exact test to the five biosynthetic families of amino acids [17], as the reviewer suggests, and then combine the five probability values in a
single value, we obtain a highly significant probability (Ï2
= 34.8, df = 10, P < 10-3) (data not published). Ronenberg
et al [14] also make a bitter criticism of the coevolution
theory but, more generally, acknowledge that amino acids
in a biosynthetic relationship have codons beginning with
the same first base [14].
It is absolutely untrue that all the literature cited on this
point is only my own. I have cited no less than 14 papers
by other authors [5-13,16-22,34,37] which establish a
relationship between the genetic code and the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids.
My suggestion refers to an extreme interpretation of the
stereochemical theory, i.e. that if the origin of the genetic
code were to start again from scratch, we would observe â
according to this interpretation â the same assignments in
the genetic code that we observe today. It is this extreme
physicochemical determinism that seems so completely
absurd to me.
A different argument regards the less extreme interpretations of the stereochemical theory. I have never neglected

Page 9 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:37

this theory (see, for instance reference [31]) and I have
made it compatible with the coevolution theory [57], but
I do not believe in the stereochemical theory because
none of the presented evidence is, in my view, stronger,
more important or more corroborative than the molecular
fossils reported in Tab. 1 (see also replies to Reviewer 3).
All this evidence is compatible with the coevolution theory (see, for instance, reference [31] and replies to
Reviewer 3).
My convictions are not based on grounds of personal
incredulity but on molecular fossils (Tab. 1) which are
'eye witnesses' of the mechanism that gave origin to the
genetic code (see also replies to Reviewer 3). If a different
and credible interpretation of these molecular fossils were
available, I would instantly renounce my convictions.
There is nothing truly personal and unscientific in all this.
I have taken all the data into account in Di Giulio [57].
Reviewer Comments
Similarly, it is not clear to me why the first amino acids to
enter the code would be expected to be derived from other
molecules that were not amino acids. If we assume that
the genetic code arose in proto-cells that already had fairly
sophisticated metabolism, e.g. the "RNA world" stage
accepted by many researchers, it is less clear why pre-protein metabolism would not have generated a range of
amino acids prior to genetic coding. Perhaps this point
could be elaborated upon? For example, Eors Szathmary
argues in the coding coenzyme hypothesis that we might
expect complex amino acids to be introduced first, which
is consistent with arginine's codon/binding site relationships demonstrated by myself and Michael Yarus.

[Author's Response]
I provide an extensive reply to this point with Reviewer 3.
However, the Reviewer's question cannot find a simple
answer because we do not understand the profound reason why the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids have to
be in a relationship with the genetic code. Understanding
this point might constitute the frontier research on genetic
code origin [58].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

ways of amino acids tell other stories (see also some of the
replies to Reviewer 3).
Reviewer Comments
The calculation in the appendix used to calculate the significance of seeing 5 of 6 amino acids that have nonamino-acid precursors in the GNN codon block (binomial using n = 5, k = 5, p = 6/20) is definitely incorrect
because it fails to take into account the distribution of
amino acids in other coding blocks. I think the correct calculation, if we use 20 coding blocks for the 20 amino
acids, is to say that 5 coding blocks are GNN-encoded, 15
are not, and these distribute into 5 GNN-encoded, no-precursor blocks, 0 GNN-encoded, precursor blocks, 1 nonGNN-encoded, no-precursor block (for Ser), and 14 nonGNN-encoded, precursor blocks. Using Fisher's Exact Test
on these data, we actually get a P-value of approx.
0.00038: almost an order of magnitude more significant
than reported. However, some caution about the space of
possible coding blocks is warranted, and showing that the
test holds over a range of these assumptions would be useful. The other statistics should also be re-done using this
approach. However, it should be noted that the statistical
significance of these results does not come close to that
reported either for the stereochemical or adaptive theories
of the code's evolution, so a more ecumenical view at this
point would appear to be prudent.

[Author's Response]
I have changed the statistical test. Fisher's exact test provides much more significant results (see Appendix). I have
also introduced some new observations (see final part of
the Appendix).
I have conducted several tests in addition to those shown
in the Appendix. I feel that Fisher's exact test is the one
that really must be used to calculate these probabilities
because it can take into account the structure of the
genetic code by means of amino acids codified by GNN
codons and by non-GNN codons. I thank the Reviewer for
this suggestion.

It might have generated other amino acids, but their biosynthetic pathways seem to contain a quite different story
than the one hypothesised by the Reviewer. Therefore,
this point does not seem to require further elaboration
(see also the replies to Reviewer 3).

The probability of 3.9 Ã 10-4 (see Appendix) clearly indicates that the distribution of amino acids deriving from
non-amino acid precursors is not in the least random in
the genetic code. Even if this value is not close to the one
associable to the stereochemical or physicochemical
hypotheses, it nevertheless indicates that we have to
explain it, which is what I have done in this paper.

It is possible: these are other heterotrophic interpretations
on genetic code origin. In my view â and as I feel has been
convincingly argued in this paper â the biosynthetic path-

I do not say that the stereochemical or physicochemical
hypotheses are false, I simply explain what I observe using
a prudent tone. Nevertheless, the stereochemical and

Page 10 of 21

Biology Direct 2008, 3:37

physicochemical hypotheses cannot naturally explain
what is observed in this paper.
Reviewer Comments
Finally, the conclusions seem to end rather abruptly with
a discussion of specific product-precursor pairs. A more
general concluding paragraph, including relationships
between the present results and existing knowledge about
the genetic code (including relationships to the adaptive
and stereochemical patterns that have been shown using
data from many laboratories) would be helpful for the
general readership that Biology Direct attracts.

[Author's Response]
All the observations regarding the topic dealt with in the
paper have been fully discussed. The paper is already overlong and its further extension with a discussion of the stereochemical and physicochemical hypotheses would be
inappropriate in my view, partly because the observations
reported therein are not easily reconciled with the stereochemical hypothesis, for instance, although there are
models [57] that make the coevolution and the stereochemcial theories compatible. However, I feel that the
Reviewer's suggestion is unsuitable as the paper does not
aim to make a comparison with, for instance, the the stereochemical hypothesis. What the Reviewer suggests
should be done elsewhere. Here I have introduced an
extension of the coevolution theory and have not dealt
with its relations with other theories.
Reviewer's report 2

Reviewer Comments
This article strives to develop Wong's co-evolution theory
to additionally specify the order of amino acid recruitment to the genetic code. The main salient observation is
that, with the sole exception of serine, amino acids that
are synthesized from non-amino acid precursors are
encoded by GNN codons. These are supposed to be the
first amino acids in the code. This is an interesting idea
but I think it is based on certain assumptions that are not
spelled out in the paper. First, I think way too much confidence is granted the original co-evolution theory. It is a
viable explanation for some aspects of the evolution of the
code but, to me, frozen accident + partial optimization for
translational robustness work at least as well. Second, and
somewhat more subtly, an important hidden assumption
is that, at the stage of the code evolution, central metabolism was already in place, so that amino acid biosynthesis
pathways evolved from central pathways. This is far from
being obvious. From my viewpoint, a more sensible
approach would be to assume that the first amino acids

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

were those that are most readily produced abiogenically.
Granted, this list significantly overlaps with Di Giulio's
but there is also considerable difference, and I believe it
matters.
[Author's Response]
I have dedicated entire sections to specifying the various
assumptions and, in particular, the section entitled "the
extended coevolution theory", so the Reviewers' comment
appears strange.
There is nothing new in the fact that the coevolution theory is not generally appreciated, but we must say why. The
frozen accident and partial optimisation for translational
robustness are compatible with the coevolution theory
[31] (see replies to Reviewer 3). I repeat that I am convinced of the substantial correctness of the coevolution
theory because: (i) the biosynthetic pathways are linked to
the genetic code [5-13,16-22,34,37] and (ii) molecular
fossils (Tab. 1) are 'eye witnesses' of the mechanism that
structured the genetic code.
I reply extensively to this observation with Reviewer 3.
If the main suggestion of the coevolution theory is true,
then there was a coevolution between the biosynthetic
pathways of amino acids and genetic code organisation,
implying that at least the metabolism of amino acids
evolved when the genetic code evolved. Therefore, it is not
utterly absurd to imagine that central metabolism was
already in place because the biosynthetic pathways of
amino acids start from there. Furthermore, the metabolic
complexity of the RNA world has also been discussed (see,
for instance, references [42,43]).
There is an overlap between the first amino acids to evolve
along the pathways of central metabolism and those that
are more abundant in the prebiotic syntheses or in meteorites. We will have to see which interpretation is right.
This point is extensively discussed with Reviewer 3.
Reviewer Comments
The paper is written in a manner that makes it hard to figure out what is actually new.

I think it is worth to clearly formulate the difference from
the traditional coevolution theory.

Reviewer Comments
The coevolution theory of the genetic code is a detailed
and well-developed theory that describes the build-up
from a simple structure encoding only a few amino acids
to the current canonical code. Several important aspects of
this theory make a great deal of sense to me, but other
aspects seem less well justified. I will try to indicate the
problems as I see them.

[Author's Response]
On the basis of what is written in this review against the
coevolution theory, I do not understand what are the
aspects of this theory that "make a great deal of sense" to
this Reviewer.
Reviewer Comments
Firstly, I would like to relate this theory to the RNA World
hypothesis, which supposes that there was a time early in
the history of life at which both genetic and catalytic functions in organisms were carried out by RNA molecules.
The genetic code and the translation process are the most
important pieces of evidence that convince me that there
was an RNA World. The whole point of translation is to
take information from the mRNA and use it to make a
protein. Furthermore, rRNAs and tRNAs are essential in
the translation mechanism. Thus it seems clear that RNA
came before the origin of the code. Although your papers
and those of Wong do not mention the RNA World explicitly, it seems to me that the coevolution theory is perfectly
consistent with the RNA World idea. Would you agree?

[Author's Response]

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

At a certain evolutionary stage. RNA must have become
the 'master' of protocellular activity and from this point
on I agree with the Reviewer's RNA world. Indeed I have
published papers on this very topic [59]. In this paper, the
coevolution theory is discussed in the terminal phases of
the RNA world. There are also other papers of Wong's and
my own on this issue [1-4].
Reviewer Comments
In my view, the late stage of the RNA World was already
rather complex. I envisage cells enclosed by lipid membranes within which a well-developed, RNA-controlled
metabolism was operating. These cells must already have
solved the basic problem of accurate replication of relatively long RNAs (like rRNA), and they must have had a
reliable energy input that could be coupled to the synthesis of large numbers of RNA polymers. The genetic code
would have originated inside cells of this nature.

[Author's Response]
I totally agree: the genetic code originated very late on in
the origin of life. In my papers I have stressed this point
(see for instance reference [3]).
Reviewer Comments
One thing that is not clear in this paper is whether the
metabolic reactions discussed are supposed to be catalyzed by RNAs or proteins. In particular, Figures 1 and 2
show that the synthesis of the earliest amino acids is
related to the glycolytic pathway and the citric acid cycle.
Since these are the earliest amino acids in the code, there
could be no genetically encoded proteins prior to this. Are
you therefore proposing that the glycolytic pathway and
the citric acid cycle existed in the RNA World and that all
the steps in these pathways were catalyzed by RNAs? This
does not seem impossible to me, but it is a strong assumption, because it supposes that proteins have evolved to
take over all the same catalytic steps formerly catalyzed by
RNAs without changing any of the steps in the metabolism. Since the theory seems to depend on this assumption, it should be stated clearly.

[Author's Response]
We have discussed that the main catalyst in the early
phases of genetic code origin was constituted by peptideRNA molecules, whose evolution resulted in peptidyltRNA like molecules and, therefore, in the origin of the
genetic code [1-4]. Therefore, during genetic code origin,
metabolic reactions were catalysed by covalent complexes
of peptides and RNAs (see Background) also involved in
the catalysis of the glycolitic pathway and the citric acid
cycle (see also below). If peptides were already involved in
the peptide-RNA complexes, as I maintain, then the prob-

Biology Direct 2008, 3:37

lem that the Reviewer raises is non-existent because the
protein component already present should eventually
prevail â without violating the principle of evolutionary
continuity â over the RNA component. These ideas have
been presented in several papers ([1-4,59], and need not
be repeated here. An entire section "Why the genetic code
originated" introduces these ideas so I do not feel any
more need be said. I remind the Reviewer that very early
catalysts could have catalysed reaction classes and, therefore, there might have been a very small number of
enzymes [60].
Reviewer Comments
At the end of the results section, you touch on the fact that
the earliest amino acids in the code are the most abundant
in meteorites and in prebiotic synthesis experiments. We
have recently considered this question in detail [61]. By
combining measurements from several meteorites, experiments on atmospheric discharge, hydrothermal vents, icy
dust grains and others, we show that there is a consensus
of which amino acids are easiest to form non-biologically.
Our analysis shows that ten amino acids are found widely
in these cases, and that these can be ranked in decreasing
order of frequency as Gly, Ala, Asp, Glu, Val, Ser, Ile, Leu,
Pro, Thr. The other ten biological amino acids are not
found in these non-biological situations. We consider our
analysis to be strong support for certain aspects of the
coevolution theory. We refer to the ten listed amino acids
as 'early', because we suppose these were the first incorporated into the code, whereas the other ten are 'late'
because they could only have been incorporated after the
evolution of biochemical synthesis pathways. The early
amino acids that emerge from our analysis are almost
exactly the same as those taken to be early in the coevolution theory. Furthermore, Trifonov [54] has also carried
out a ranking procedure that predicts a very similar order.

[Author's Response]
These observations are partly consistent with the coevolution theory. However, Ile, Leu, Pro and Thr are product
amino acids according to the coevolution theory and
therefore appeared late on, while they are early according
to the observations of Higgs and Pudritz [61]. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether these amino acids entered the
genetic code through the biosynthetic pathways or
through their availability in the environment (heterotrophic origin) (see also below). Whereas, in order to
explain the codification of these amino acids by GNN
codons by means of the scheme in Fig. 2, the extended
coevolution theory need only add that the glycolytic pathway and Krebs' cycle were already operative. I have introduced a reference for Trifonov's works [54].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

Reviewer Comments
Although there seems to be general agreement about the
distinction of early and late amino acids, our results make
it clear that there are many different ways to make the
early amino acids. These are easiest to form because they
are thermodynamically least costly ([61]. In turn, this suggests that biochemical pathways might not be relevant at
the earliest stages of genetic code evolution discussed in
this paper. If these early amino acids were synthesized
non-biologically, they might have been frequent in the
environment and could have been used directly without
requiring synthesis in the organism (heterotrophy). Alternatively, if they were synthesized by the organisms, the
fact that they are easy to make suggests that many different
reaction pathways would be possible, and that the pathways that were used in the RNA World may not be related
to those used today, thus casting doubt on the relevance
of Figure 2.

[Author's Response]
I do not understand why the ease of thermodynamic synthesis of these amino acids should not have been
exploited by the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids. It
should rather be expected that the thermodynamic opportunities be exploited biologically. It is unclear why these
amino acids should not be able to coincide. It is also
unclear why the pathways used by the RNA world should
be different from those used today. These pathways are
fundamental and, once they were acquired it would have
been difficult to change them. Does the Reviewer think
that the metabolism of the RNA world was different from
that of today? Why? And, in particular, why should the
biosynthetic pathways of amino acids be different from
those of the RNA world? Although minor changes are to
be expected, the majority of the pathways present in the
RNA world should have been preserved unchanged even
in the later evolutionary stages. It must be borne in mind
that most of the pathways in Fig. 1 evolved in a world in
which the catalytic component might have already been
represented, albeit partly, by proteins (peptides), at least
those that were codified at that time, made up of only the
amino acids in Fig. 2. Complexes of peptide-RNA catalysts, some of which were of heterotrophic origin, might
also have been used for the syntheses in Fig. 2 with the
additional condition that the first amino acids were codified only through the biosynthetic pathways in Fig. 2.
However, the key point is that the amino acids in Fig. 2 are
the same ones codified by GNN codons, and this association is statistically highly significant. If, more generally,
we consider that the biosynthetic pathways of amino
acids are linked to genetic code organisation [5-13,1622,34,37], then the relation between GNN codons and
Fig. 2 becomes highly significant and might truly explain
the very earliest phases of genetic code origin.

Reviewer Comments
One interesting point of agreement is that the five most
frequent amino acids in our list (Gly, Ala, Asp, Glu, Val)
are exactly those coded by GNN codons, and this suggests
something very similar to that shown in your Figure 3. In
your results section, you mention GNN codons, but then
say that there was a primitive code that possessed only
codons of the type GNC or GNG from which the GNS
code developed (where S = G or C). I do not understand
the reason that the third position base was restricted to G
or C. I would suppose that the wobble pairing at the third
position in the anticodon-codon interaction is a fundamental aspect of RNA structure that would have been the
same in the earliest tRNAs, i.e. I would assume that a tRNA
with wobble base G could pair with codons ending C or
U, and that a tRNA with wobble base U could pair at least
with codons ending A and G (as occurs with most bacterial tRNAs today), and possibly with all four bases at the
third position (as occurs with most mitochondrial tRNAs
today). In other words, I think that the two-codon and
four-codon boxes seen in the modern genetic code arise
naturally from the properties of RNA structure and that
these would also have occurred in the earliest code. In
contrast, wobble pairing does not occur at first position,
so there is no problem with having the first position
restricted to G or C, as in Figure 3.

[Author's Response]
The GNC code was suggested by Ikehara et al. [48] and I
make use of their results. The truly important point is that
the biosynthetically early amino acids are codified by
GNN codons. It is irrelevant which form of code, for
instance GNS, GNR or other, was actually operative. However, the reason might be that, as all the codons start with
G, it might have resulted in a general enhancement of G
and C in mRNAs and it is also for this reason that the
scheme in Fig. 3 was chosen. I also prefer the GNS codon
because I believe that this took place at a very high temperature, thus favouring RNAs rich in G and C [3]. Therefore, I partly agree with the Reviewer. More generally, I
must say that this is not an important point and should
not be overstressed.
However, Eigen et al. [49] also prefers codons starting
with G (GNY). I prefer restricting the third codon position
to just two bases because it is thus easier to achieve the
evolution of mRNA [3,4].
Reviewer Comments
A key point of the coevolution theory is that, when a new
amino acid is added, it takes over some of the codons previously assigned to its precursor. If all the amino acids in
the current code are traced back to their earliest precursors, then we arrive at Figure 4 (or something similar, if we

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

interpret 'C' and 'G' at third position as 'U or C' and 'A or
G'). This code arises naturally from the logic of the coevolution theory, but there is no direct evidence for it, i.e. this
is a prediction of the theory and not a basis for it. It does
not follow on as an obvious step from the GNN code in a
predictable way. There seems to be no reason why this
rather bizarre pattern of placement of the earliest amino
acids should have occurred. I find Figure 4 strange because
it sets some difficult challenges for molecular recognition
during the assembly of amino acyl-tRNAs. In particular,
the shapes of the codon domains occupied by Asp, Glu
and Ser are complicated. Presumably there were RNA catalysts that carried out the job of current amino acyl-tRNA
synthetases. For correct charging of tRNAs, these synthetase RNAs would have had to distinguish large sets of
tRNAs from one another, possibly by recognition of the
bases in the anticodon. The anticodons for Asp tRNAs,
according to Figure 4, would be GAU, UAU, GGU, UGU,
GUU, UUU, and GUC (it should be remembered that
pairing is antisense, so the first anticodon base pairs with
the third codon base). To recognize this combination of
anticodons would require some complex mixture of logical operations combining bases at all three anticodon
positions, for example: IF (3rd base = U AND 2nd base C)
OR (3rd base = C AND 2nd base = U AND 1st base = G)
THEN charge with Asp. This would either require a very
complex recognition process for a single synthetase, or it
would require separate synthetases for each codon block
that would carry out the same reaction of charging the
tRNA with Asp. Neither of these options seems simple or
parsimonious. The same would be true for other amino
acids in this arrangement of the code.
[Author's Response]
The Reviewer is mistaken. There is direct evidence from
the genetic code indicating, for instance, that the majority
of ANN codons codified for Asp. Therefore, it is the biosynthetic relationships reflected in the genetic code that
define Fig. 4. This is a prediction of the coevolution theory
but it is also supported by the distribution of the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids in the rows of the genetic
code (see, for instance, Taylor and Coates [11]).
Whereas, there is an obvious step which derives Fig. 4
from the GNN code. This consists of the fact that, once the
codifications were assigned to the first six amino acids on
GNN codons, it was necessary to immediately extend the
meaning, as Crick also suggests [51], to many codons in
the code, thus generating the code in Fig. 4. The Reviewer
should read sections (iii) and (iv) of the Discussion more
carefully. Fig. 4 is not strange and, in particular, the shape
of the codon domain of Asp and Glu and Ser is linked to
the rows of the genetic code which, as suggested by Taylor

and Coates [11], are in relation with the biosynthetic families of these amino acids.

four-column code. The coevolution theory ignores this
issue.

The coevolution theory does not necessarily envisage that
the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were present at this stage
of genetic code origin because the tRNAs might have been
charged by means of the biosynthetic pathways of amino
acids. There was no need for the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The Reviewer's criticism is therefore weakened.
Moreover, as stated in the paper, the mRNAs might have
been simpler than Fig. 4 leads us to believe. See the subsections (iii) and (iv) of the Discussion, in which the complexity of recognition maintained by the Reviewer is
considerably reduced.

Reviewer Comments
An alternative that I favour at the moment is that the GNN
code developed into a 'four-column' code in which all
codons in the same column coded for the same amino
acid: NUN = Val, NCN = Ala, NAN = Asp (and/or Glu) and
NGN = Gly. This is an obvious simple step from the GNN
code: all we do is relax the restriction that the first position
must be G. It is very simple for molecular recognition by
the synthetases because only the middle anticodon base
needs to be recognized. For example, a single synthetase
that adds Val to all tRNAs with 2nd anticodon base = A
would be sufficient to assign all NUN codons to Val. Furthermore, the four column code explains why amino
acids with similar physicochemical properties end up in
the same columns of the code whereas amino acids in the
same row (same first codon base) do not have similar
properties. The difference between rows and columns
shows up clearly when we look at the rates of evolution of
1st and 2nd position sites in proteins and the variability
of these sites among species [62]. According to this argument, it is physicochemical properties that are important
in determining where new amino acids are added to the
code. Amino acids will be added into positions that were
formerly occupied by amino acids with similar properties
because this is minimally disruptive to the proteins
encoded by the code at the previous step. As an example
of the difference between this argument and the coevolution theory, consider Ile, which is assigned to codons in
the AUN box. According to the coevolution theory, Ile
ends up in this position because AUN was originally Asp
and Ile is synthesized from Asp. According to the physical
property argument, Ile ends up in this position because
AUN was originally Val and Ile is similar to Val. It is well
known that neighbouring codons in the canonical code
tend to specify similar amino acids and hence that the
code seems to be optimized with respect to randomly
reshuffled codes [63]. The physical property argument
summarized above explains how the optimality of the
canonical code arises as a result of its evolution from the

It is not obvious, and it indeed does not seem sensible,
why a column code specifying amino acids Ala = NUN,
Asp = NAN (and/or Glu) and Gly = NGN should have
been created. Why should such a code have been created?
Whereas the opposite is obvious for the coevolution theory. It would be sufficient to insert, from the GNN code,
the other amino acids on the columns, according to their
physicochemical properties, without passing through this
fairly useless code, partly because there is no evolutionary
link between these five amino acids (Val, Ala, Asp, Glu
and Gly) and the other amino acids that will occupy the
columns; and if this link had been based on the physicochemical properties of amino acids, it would have been
inefficient because, for instance, in the column NGN =
Gly, there are the smallest (Gly) and the largest (Trp and
Arg) amino acids. Indeed, although the physicochemical
properties are linked to genetic code organisation, they are
not highly minimised and so these properties might have
played only a subsidiary role in genetic code evolution
[31,56].
If, on the other hand, the column code was obvious, then
the code in Fig. 4 would be equally obvious because it is
organised in rows, as Taylor and Coates suggest [11] the
genetic code is organised. The GNN code, which the
Reviewer also accepts, is a row code and, therefore, the
next step in genetic code evolution must 'necessarily' be a
code organised in rows because it evolves on row constraints existing in its precursor (GNN code) and not the
one organised in columns suggested by the Reviewer
which implies a radical change in the logic for the construction of mRNA.
The problem of the synthetases is non-existent because, as
already suggested, the coevolution theory can envisage the
charging of tRNAs by means of the biosynthetic pathways
of amino acids or, at least, can envisage a limited intervention of the synthetases.
The coevolution theory is compatible with the observation that the physicochemical properties of amino acids
are better allocated on the columns of the genetic code. I
have dealt with this issue extensively, see for instance Di
Giulio [31].
Whereas, from the viewpoint of the coevolution theory, it
is the rows (biosynthetic pathways) that are important for
determining where an amino acid will be added, with the
columns deciding only the reduction in the translation
noise compatibly with the row allocation.

Biology Direct 2008, 3:37

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

The coevolution theory considers this aspect. If we consider that, according to the extended coevolution theory,
the GNN code preceded the current code then, as the
amino acids evolved along the biosynthetic pathways
organised in rows, the amino acids were allocated in columns in an attempt to reduce the physicochemical distances between amino acids [31]. If hydrophobic amino
acids were allocated on a given column of the code (first
column), then the majority of hydrophobic amino acids
biosynthetically originating in the various rows would
have the possibility to be allocated on the code's first column, and so on. In other words, the coevolution theory is
perfectly compatible with the distribution of the amino
acids' physicochemical properties in the genetic code [31].
Reviewer Comments
The amount of credence that one gives to the coevolution
theory depends on the extent that one believes that amino
acid synthesis occured on tRNAs. There are two cases
where the evidence for this is very strong: Asp Asn and Glu
Gln. These reactions occur on the tRNAs in both Archaea
and Bacteria, as shown in Table 1, and Di Giulio [33] is
cited as evidence that these are molecular fossils. The Ser
Cys case would be another good example, but it is only
found in Archaea, according to the table. The cases of Met
fMet and Ser Sec are less relevant because they involve
non-standard amino acids that do not have their own
codons. It would be interesting to have more details on all
the examples in Table 1. For any one of the examples, are
all the enzymes that carry out this reaction homologous?
This is particularly relevant if the function is shared by
Archaea and Bacteria â it is necessary to argue that the
sequence is homologous in the two domains in order to
exclude the possibility that the function evolved independently. When one of these functions is present in a
domain, is it present in the majority of species in this
domain? This is important in order to rule out horizontal
transfer of a gene from one domain to a small group of
species in the other domain. As far as I know, Sec occurs
patchily in unrelated groups of organisms, so even though
the Ser Sec reaction occurs in all three domains, there is
probably not a good case that it is ancestral. On the other
hand, my understanding of the Asp Asn and Glu Gln cases

acid into another when the transformation takes place on tRNAs

is that these are really ancestral to the split of Archaea and
Bacteria. Please could you summarize in more detail how
strong the evidence is that all the cases in Table 1 evolved
ancestrally to the split of the domains of life?
[Author's Response]
I have dedicated an entire paper [33] in an attempt to
establish whether or not the pathways in Tab. 1 are ancestral traits. The conclusion of this analysis [33] is that there
is no reason why these pathways (Tab. 1) should be
derived traits. I cannot summarise the contents of that
paper in this work. I cite that paper [33]. Three other references [19-21], and not only my own, are cited and indicate that these pathways might be molecular fossils (see
below).
However, if the Reviewer accepts the ancestrality of the
pathways Asp->Asn and Glu->Gln, why then should he
not accept the ancestrality of, for instance, Ser->Cys? Does
he perhaps think that these pathways were generated by
different mechanisms? This seems absurd to me. There is
absolutely no chance of these five pathways (Tab. 1)
evolving independently without any clear selective pressure (see below). It is better to think that these pathways
are the expression of the same mechanism that produced
them because they are 'homologues', i.e. they do the same
thing.
The pathway Ser->Sec is certainly homologous, at least
between Archaea and Eukarya [64,65], and so it should be
extremely ancient. In Archaea and Eukarya, this pathway
takes place in two steps, while it is in one step only in Bacteria [65]. However, all these enzymes are homologues,
i.e. they share a common origin and so this pathways
seems extremely ancient and is also very widespread, contrary to what the Reviewer says [66]. The pathway Ser>Cys has also been suggested as being present in the
LUCA [67], However, the pathway Ser->Cys has only been
found in a few archebacteria and so its phylogenetic distribution would seem to indicate, given its phylogenetic
rarity, that it is a derived trait, as the Reviewer claims. Nevertheless, all these pathways (Tab. 1) are extremely difficult to evolve because they must necessarily create some
intermediates, such as Ser-tRNACys which, if they ended up
on ribosomes would have disastrous effects on cell life.
Therefore, these pathways are difficult to evolve. This and
other arguments are reported in Di Giulio [33], which
concludes that all these pathways are molecular fossils of
the mechanism that established the genetic code. The
Reviewer is referred to my reference [33]. Finally, why
should these pathways have evolved recently to do the
same thing that an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase did so
well? Why? Why replace an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase
with another synthetase whose first step would charge an

Biology Direct 2008, 3:37

amino acid on a tRNA specific for another amino acid (for
instance Ser-tRNACys)? Why? I invite the Reviewer to write
a paper on this issue, addressing these questions and
those raised in Di Giulio [33]. The truth is that there are
no answers to these questions and the only way that these
pathways (Tab. 1) can be rationalised is to view them as
ancestral traits. In conclusion, the evidence in favour of
the ancestrality of these pathways is considerable (see
[33]).
Reviewer Comments
If we accept for a moment that the Asp Asn and Glu Gln
reactions evolved ancestrally to the split between the
domains, the next question is whether these reactions
were initially catalyzed by RNA or proteins. Asn and Gln
are late additions to the code. A relatively diverse set of
amino acids, such as the ten early amino acids listed
above, could have been present in the code before Asn
and Gln were added. Thus the first catalysts that carried
out these reactions may have been proteins composed of
the early amino acids. The fact that these reactions occur
on tRNAs does not necessarily mean that they were relics
of the RNA World. Similarly, the fact that these two amino
acids are synthesized on tRNAs does not necessarily mean
that the metabolism of the earliest amino acids in Figure
2 occurred on tRNAs.

[Author's Response]
I do not understand the relevance of catalysts in these
reactions. They could have been RNAs, peptide-RNAs or
even proteins composed of early amino acids. I favour
catalysis by peptidyl-tRNAlike molecules as the true catalysts at this stage of the genetic code [3,4]. This excludes
nothing. These pathways have all the requisites to be
molecular fossils of the RNA world ([31,33,68]).
If, as the Reviewer suggests, we accept that Asp->Asn and
Glu->Gln are ancestral, then along with the other pathways (Tab. 1), this would strongly corroborate the coevolution theory. But this theory says that precursor-product
transformations took place on tRNAs. However, why
should only these transformations of amino acids take
place on tRNAs? Evidently the implication is that the
entire metabolism, or at least that involving all amino
acids, took place on tRNAs and, therefore, the pathways in
Fig. 2 could also take place on tRNAs. This conclusion is
also suggested by other authors [28,31,41-43]. This is the
extended coevolution theory. With this assumption, all
the weaknesses of the coevolution theory are removed.
The fact that these two amino acids are synthesised on
tRNAs does not necessarily mean that the metabolism of
the amino acids in Fig. 2 took place on tRNAs, but all the
pathways in Tab. 1, one of which takes place in two steps,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

might imply, more generally, that metabolism took place
on tRNAs. Furthermore, Glu from Glu-tRNAGlu intervenes
in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll [31] and this, together
with other observations on a more general role of aminoacyl-tRNAs in metabolism [69] might strengthen the
hypothesis that the entire metabolism took place at this
stage on tRNAs [31,41-43].
Reviewer Comments
If I understand correctly, all five examples in Table 1 are
single step reactions catalyzed by a single enzyme. This is
also a good reason to suppose that synthesis on the tRNAs
is a relevant mechanism of synthesis for these amino acids
in particular. However, most of the late amino acids with
the exception of Asn and Gln have very long synthesis
pathways involving many intermediates (as shown in Figure 1). There seems to be no evidence that any of these
were synthesized on tRNAs. There are eight steps shown
from Glu to Arg, for example. It seems to be stretching the
theory too far to suppose that there were eight sequential
reassignments of Glu codons to intermediate molecules,
that all these intermediates have completely disappeared
again from the modern code, and that all these reaction
steps that formerly occurred on the tRNA have now been
replaced by equivalent steps that occur without the molecules being attached to tRNAs. It is simpler to suppose that
the pathways to synthesize these late amino acids were
never associated with tRNAs, and that the intermediates
do not appear in the modern code because they were
never added to the code in the first place. Thus, the evolution of the synthesis pathways is important in allowing
the diversity of the code to build up, but this does not
influence which codons are assigned to which amino
acids. If synthesis does not occur on the tRNA, there is no
reason why the product amino acid should take over the
codons of its precursor. Since most of the late amino acids
have long synthesis pathways, it is likely that they arose in
the protein world, and that the steps were catalyzed by
proteins made from earlier amino acids. The situation
may be different for Ile, Leu, Pro and Thr, which occur
non-biologically and are thus included among the early
group in our ranking, although they are less frequent than
the simplest amino acids. These four also have relatively
long synthesis pathways on Figure 1. These may have
existed in the environment at the time the code originated
if their rates of non-biological synthesis were high
enough, or they may have been synthesized by RNA-catalyzed pathways. In either case, the protein enzymes catalyzing the pathways on Figure 1 would have evolved later
and there is no reason to suppose that these pathways are
the same as those that existed when these amino acids
were added to the code.

No. In the Ser->Sec pathway there are two biosynthetic
steps. Absolutely not. As stated above, the first step regards
the charging of an amino acid on a tRNA specific for
another amino acid, which is a very dangerous hybrid
because, if it ended up on the ribosomes it would be
lethal. Therefore, there is no 'good reason' why these pathways should be used to synthesise these amino acids [33].
The fact that Ser->Sec takes place in two steps seems to
indicate that this was possible, contrary to what the
Reviewer maintains.
The intermediates that are not amino acids would not
appear in the code. Only amino acids should appear in
the evolving code according to the coevolution theory.
There is nothing strange in this. If biosyntheses took place
on tRNAs then, when the code was completely developed,
a strong selective pressure would have been triggered to
remove tRNAs from metabolism because the tRNAs were
extremely cumbersome and it is therefore not surprising
that today we only observe the relics of these events (Tab.
1) [31].
Today it might seem true that syntheses on tRNAs were
inefficient. Nevertheless, this is the very story that these
fossils tell: synthesis on tRNAs.
However, there is evidence â again from molecular fossils
â that biosynthetic pathways might have taken place on
tRNAs. the pathway to His starts with a reaction producing
N'-5'-phosphoribosyl-ATP, which is held to be a fossil of
RNA [43,70].
The fact is that the biosynthetic pathways are linked to
genetic code organisation [5-13,16-22,34,37] and therefore give credence to syntheses on tRNAs.
In several biosyntheses of amino acids, there are amino
acids as intermediates. This implies, in agreement with the
coevolution theory, that these could have been incorporated into the evolving code but were subsequently substituted [9,16]. However, I see no problem here with the
coevolution theory, even if the biosyntheses were catalysed by proteins.
That the Reviewer's suggestion regarding the amino acids
Ile, Leu, Pro and Thr is probably false and that, more generally, the Reviewer's entire argument regarding both the
very early amino acids and the 'column code' is dubious,
is demonstrated by the fact that the 'system' that led to the
GNN code must have been extremely efficient because it
was able to achieve a clear classification of amino acids
only on the basis of their frequencies, separating them
into two groups: Gly, Ala, Asp, Glu and Val in the GNN

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/37

code, and Ile, Leu, Pro and Thr. Evidently an extremely
efficient system! Is it possible that the system was able,
only on the basis of frequencies, to incorporate into the
GNN code only the first amino acids in the ranking of
Higgs and Pudritz [61] without making an error and that
the same system created the column code by extending
the codification of these amino acids? This seems absurd
because in the first phases there seem to be strong stereochemical constraints while, in the column code, these
constraints are completely relaxed. Is this possible?
Why should the pathways be different? I have already
answered this observation. It is better to maintain an old
pathway if only to maintain evolutionary continuity. I fail
to understand why the change of catalysts should entail a
change of pathway even if, as already suggested, the
majority of steps in Fig. 1 were catalysed by peptide-RNA
complexes. (Finally, the coevolution theory does not
clearly define the early phases of genetic code origin, i.e.
the GNN code, because it considers that the precursor
amino acids Gly, Ala, Val, Ser, Asp and Glu entered the
code without following the biosynthetic pathways. The
Reviewer adopts a similar standpoint in which the amino
acids Gly, Ala, Val, Asp and Glu entered the GNN code
without using the biosynthetic pathways. The extended
coevolution theory has a different interpretation: the
amino acids Ser, Gly, Ala, Val, Asp and Glu entered the
code through the biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, the
question is as follows: why should the amino acids Ile,
Leu, Pro and Thr, which appear in prebiotic syntheses and
are early in the ranking of Higgs and Pedrutz [61], not
have been added to the code as the amino acids codified
by the GNN codons, but entered the code through the
biosynthetic pathways, as the coevolution theory suggests? This would constitute a difficulty for this theory
because all these amino acids were present in the prebiotic
environment and it would not be clear why some entered
the code directly while others entered via the biosynthetic
pathways. The extended coevolution theory removes this
difficulty as it treats all amino acids in the same way: they
all entered the code via the biosynthetic pathways. As
already suggested, the Reviewer's hypothesis presents
some inconsistencies. Why should only the amino acids
Gly, Ala, Asp, Glu and Val have been codified by GNN
codons while the other amino acids (Ile, Leu, Pro and Thr)
were added to the code later on? Did this choice take place
only on the basis of frequency? It seems to me that the frequencies are too weak a constraint to explain the clear distinction between these two groups of amino acids while
the biosynthetic pathways seem to be a sufficiently strong
constraint to explain these observations consistently with
the allocations of all these amino acids in the code.)

Reviewer Comments
I have thus argued that while the case for the reactions Asp
Asn and Glu Gln occurring on tRNAs is very strong, this
cannot be generalized to other amino acids. Without this
generalization, the central importance of precursor-product relationships in the coevolution theory breaks down.
These two cases fit with the argument based on physicochemical properties and four-column code as well. If NAN
codons were initially Asp and Glu, then it makes sense
that Asn and Gln would also be added in this column
because they are more similar to Asp and Glu than they
are to the amino acids in the other columns. Thus the theories agree for these two cases.

cies. Has anyone carried out this analysis using sequence
data from complete bacterial and archaeal genomes? I
would be interested to know what fraction of these complete genomes contains an enzyme for each of the steps in
Figure 1. If enzymes do not exist for these steps, are there
alternative synthesis pathways, or are the organisms reliant on taking in these amino acids as food? In general, are
pathways of amino acid sequences in modern proteinbased organisms more conserved than some other pathways that might be considered to be less essential to cell
function? If the pathways are not conserved in modern
organisms, the chances that they would be conserved as
far back as the RNA World are slim.

[Author's Response]

[Author's Response]

All these pathways (Tab. 1) must be expressions of the
same mechanism that generated them because believing
that they might be derived from different selective pressures is absolutely absurd as no selective pressure can be
clearly identified as having generated them [33]. Hence, if
we accept the case of Asp->Asn and Glu->Gln then this
must have been generalised among the other amino acids
and, thus, the coevolution theory is strongly corroborated.

If logical-evolutionary analyses were conducted on these
pathways and it was concluded that these were molecular
fossils [33], it would not necessarily be true that the metabolic pathways of the RNA world are only speculations
([43,68]).

It is incredible how the Reviewer can say that the pathways
on tRNAs involving the transformations Asp->Asn and
Glu->Gln, which are a direct prediction of the coevolution
theory, are also 'in agreement' with the columns theory for
the simple reason that Asn and Gln are more physicochemically similar to Asp and Glu, respectively. Let's be
serious: the two pieces of evidence are clearly different in
quality and, therefore, the two theories are not at all equal
on this point. This is because, if pathways on tRNAs, Asp>Asn and Glu->Gln would be historic evidence and hence
of extraordinary importance in understanding the origin
of the genetic code [33]. Whereas, the physicochemical
similarity between these pairs of amino acids should have
played only a secondary role in allocating Asn and Gln to
the columns, as also predicted by the coevolution theory
because it would be the necessary consequence of these
pathways on tRNAs (see, for instance reference [31]). In
short, although the two theories agree on this point, they
receive different levels of corroboration: the coevolution
theory is strongly corroborated by it, while the columns
theory is not and it acquires only a subsidiary role.
Reviewer Comments
Finally, although any discussion of metabolic pathways in
the RNA World is bound to be speculative, we can be
much more concrete in discussing pathways in modern
organisms. Figures 1 and 2 are presented as 'the' pathways
for amino acid synthesis, but I presume these are based on
a particular organism like E. coli. I do not know to what
extent these pathways are truly conserved between all spe-

The majority of organisms use pathways essentially similar to those of E. coli [43,71]. I have been following this literature for many years and it does not seem to me that
there are significant deviations from the pathways presented in Figs. 1 and 2.
There have not been analyses of this type or they have
been very limited and nevertheless confirm the scheme of
the biosyntheses of E. coli [71].
However, the intimate relationship between the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids and the organisation of
the genetic code is such as to make the research suggested
by the Reviewer superfluous because it is not possible that
this intimate relationship holds only for the biosynthetic
pathways of E. coli and its genetic code.
