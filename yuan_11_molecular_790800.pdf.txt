Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctrtype copper transporter-like gene family in rice
Meng Yuan, Xianghua Li, Jinghua Xiao and Shiping Wang*

Abstract
Background: The copper (Cu) transporter (COPT/Ctr) gene family has an important role in the maintenance of Cu
homeostasis in different species. The rice COPT-type gene family consists of seven members (COPT1 to COPT7).
However, only two, COPT1 and COPT5, have been characterized for their functions in Cu transport.
Results: Here we report the molecular and functional characterization of the other five members of the rice COPT
gene family (COPT2, COPT3, COPT4, COPT6, and COPT7). All members of the rice COPT family have the conserved
features of known COPT/Ctr-type Cu transporter genes. Among the proteins encoded by rice COPTs, COPT2, COPT3,
and COPT4 physically interacted with COPT6, respectively, except for the known interaction between COPT1 and
COPT5. COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4 cooperating with COPT6 mediated a high-affinity Cu uptake in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that lacked the functions of ScCtr1 and ScCtr3 for Cu uptake. COPT7 alone could
mediate a high-affinity Cu uptake in the yeast mutant. None of the seven COPTs alone or in cooperation could
complement the phenotypes of S. cerevisiae mutants that lacked the transporter genes either for iron uptake or for
zinc uptake. However, these COPT genes, which showed different tissue-specific expression patterns and Cu levelregulated expression patterns, were also transcriptionally influenced by deficiency of iron, manganese, or zinc.
Conclusion: These results suggest that COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 may cooperate with COPT6, respectively, and
COPT7 acts alone for Cu transport in different rice tissues. The endogenous concentrations of iron, manganese, or
zinc may influence Cu homeostasis by influencing the expression of COPTs in rice.

Background
Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for living
organisms. Cu, as a cofactor in proteins, is involved in a
wide variety of physiological processes. Cu has an
impact on the development of the nervous system in
animals and humans; deficiency of this micronutrient
causes Menkes syndrome in humans [1,2]. In plants, Cu
is associated with various physiological activities, such as
photosynthesis, mitochondrial respiration, superoxide
scavenging, cell wall metabolism, and ethylene sensing
[3]. Cu deficiency causes diverse abnormal phenotypes
in plants, including decreased growth and reproductive
development, distortion of young leaves, and insufficient
water transport [4]. Cu can also be a toxic element
when present in excess by generating hydroxyl radicals
that damage cells at the level of nucleic acids, proteins,

and lipids or by reacting with thiols to displace other
essential metals in proteins [4]. Wilson disease in
humans is caused by the accumulation of Cu in the liver
and brain [1]. The most common symptom of Cu toxicity in plants is chlorosis of vegetative tissues due to the
dysfunction of photosynthesis [4].
To deal with this dual nature of Cu, plants, as well as
other organisms, have developed a sophisticated homeostatic network to control Cu uptake, trafficking, utilization, and detoxification or exportation [5,6]. A main
step in the control of Cu homeostasis is its uptake
through the cell membrane. Different types of transporter proteins that can mediate Cu uptake have been
reported. The major group is the COPT (COPper
Transporter)/Ctr (Copper transporter) proteins, which
belong to multiple protein families in different organisms [7]. The P-type adenosine triphosphate pump is
another type of transporter for moving Cu from cytosol
into organelles in humans and plants [8,9]. It has also
been reported that other metal transporters can

transport Cu into cells. For example, YSL1 and YSL3 of
the OPT/YSL iron (Fe) transporter family can transport
Cu from leaves to seeds in Arabidopsis [10], and ZIP2
and ZIP4 of the ZIP zinc (Zn) transporter family seem
to transport Cu in Arabidopsis [11].
The Cu-uptake function of COPT/Ctr proteins was
described primarily in baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae [12]. Soon afterward, COPT/Ctr proteins involved
in Cu transport were characterized in different organisms, for example: ScCtr1, ScCtr2, and ScCtr3 in S. cerevisiae [12-15]; AtCOPT1, AtCOPT2, AtCOPT3,
AtCOPT4, and AtCOPT5 in Arabidopsis thaliana
[13,16]; hCtr1 and hCtr2 in humans (Homo sapiens)
[17,18]; SpCtr4, SpCtr5, and SpCtr6 in fission yeast
(Schizosaccharomyces pombe) [19-21]; mCtr1 in mouse
(Mus musculus) [22]; PsCtr1 in lizard (Podarcis sicula)
[23]; Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C in Drosophila melanogaster [24]; DrCtr1 in bony fish (Danio rerio) [25]; CaCtr1
in ascomycete Colletotrichum albicans [26]; CgCtr2 in
ascomycete C. gloeosporioides [27]; CrCTR1, CrCTR2,
CrCTR3, and CrCOPT1 in green algae (Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii) [28]; and OsCOPT1 and OsCOPT5 in rice
(Oryza sativa) [29]. COPT/Ctr-like proteins also occur
in zebrafish [15], ascomycete Neurospora crassa [30],
and mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea [31], although their
functions in Cu uptake remain to be determined.
The alignment of COPT/Ctr family members from
different species highlights domains that are structurally
conserved and probably functionally important during
the evolution of these proteins. According to bioinformatic analyses, all COPT/Ctr proteins contain three
putative transmembrane regions [7]. Characterized
COPT/Ctr proteins are either plasma membrane proteins that transport Cu from extracellular spaces into
cytosol or vacuoles or lysosome membrane proteins that
deliver Cu from vacuoles or lysosomes to the cytosol
[15,18,20,32]. COPT/Ctr proteins can form a homodimer, homotriplex [22,33], or heterocomplex with themselves or each other [19,21] or form a heterocomplex
with another protein that is associated with Cu transport [29]. A structural model has been proposed for the
function of human homotrimeric hCtr1 in which Cu(I)
first coordinates to the methionine-rich motif in the
hCtr1 extracellular amino (N)-terminus and then a conserved methionine residue upstream of the first transmembrane domain is essential for Cu transport [33,34].
The homotriplex is thought to provide a channel for
passage of Cu across the lipid bilayer [35]. The conserved paired cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic carboxyl (C)-terminus of yeast ScCtr1 serve as intracellular
donors for Cu(I) for its mobilization to the Cu chaperones [36].
Studies have revealed that the expression of COPT/Ctr
genes is controlled by environmental Cu level in

different species [7,29,37]. In general, they are transcriptionally up-regulated in response to Cu deprivation and
down-regulated in response to Cu overdose. The functions of COPT/Ctr proteins are also influenced by other
factors. For example, the human hCtr1-mediated Cu
transport is stimulated by extracellular acidic pH and
high K+ concentration [22].
The COPT family of rice (Oryza sativa L.) consists of
seven members, COPT1 to COPT7. COPT1 and
COPT5 can form homodimers or a heterodimer. The
two COPTs, but not other rice COPTs, bind to different
sites of rice XA13 protein, which is a susceptible protein
to pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae
(Xoo) [29]. Expression of COPT1, COPT5, or XA13
alone or coexpression of any two of the three proteins
could not complement the phenotype of yeast S. cerevisiae mutant, which lacked the functions of ScCtr1 and
ScCtr3 for Cu uptake; only coexpression of all three
proteins complemented the mutant phenotype [29].
However, it is unknown whether rice COPT2, COPT3,
COPT4, COPT6, and COPT5 are also involved in Cu
transport. In this study, we analyzed the putative Cuuptake functions of the five rice COPTs using a yeast
ctr mutant. We also analyzed the spatiotemporal, tissuespecific, metal-responsive, and pathogen-responsive
expression patterns of rice COPTs. The results suggest
that rice COPTs are transcriptionally influenced by multiple factors. Except for COPT1 and COPT5, other
COPTs may function alone or cooperatively to mediate
Cu transport in different rice tissues.

Methods
Plant treatment

To study the effect of Cu on gene expression, four-leaf
seedlings of rice variety Zhonghua 11 (Oryza sativa ssp.
japonica) were grown in hydroponic culture containing
standard physiological Cu (0.2 mM), manganese (Mn;
0.5 mM), Fe (0.1 mM), and Zn (0.5 mM) or overdose
Cu (50 mM) as described previously [29]. To induce a
deficiency of Cu, Mn, Fe, or Zn, plants were grown in
the culture media lacking Cu, Mn, Fe, or Zn for 2
weeks.
To analyze the effect of bacterial infection on gene
expression, plants were inoculated with Philippine Xoo
strain PXO61 (race 1) or PXO99 (race 6) at the booting
(panicle development) stage by the leaf-clipping method
[38]. The 2-cm leaf fragments next to bacterial infection
sites were used for RNA isolation.
Gene expression analysis

Gene expression was analyzed as described previously
[29]. In brief, total RNA was isolated from different tissues of rice variety Zhonghua 11 using TRIzol (Life
Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA)

according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The concentration of RNA was measured with a NANODROP
1000 Spectrophtometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington,
DE, USA); the A260/A280 ratio was generally between
1.8 and 2.0; RNA concentration was approximately 60
μg/100 mg fresh rice tissue. An aliquot (5 μg) of RNA
was treated with 1 unit of DNase I (Life Technologies
Corporation) in a 20-μl volume for 15 minutes to
remove contaminating DNA and then used for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) analysis. The RT step was performed in a
20-μl volume containing 5 μg of RNA, 100 ng oligo(dT)
15 primer, 2 nmol dNTP mix, and 100 unit of M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Corporation)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The cDNA
was stored at -20°C. The qPCR was performed using the
SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology,
Dalian, China) on the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Gene-specific PCR primers are listed in Additional file 1, Table S1.
The expression level of actin gene was first used to standardize the RNA sample for each qRT-PCR. The expression level relative to control was then presented. Each
qRT-PCR or RT-PCR assay was repeated at least twice
with similar results, with each repeat having three
replicates.

to obtain its Cu factor [14]. The transformed yeast cells
were grown in SC-His to OD600nm = 1.0. Several 10-fold
diluted clones were plated as drops on selective media
without or with supplement of Cu (CuSO4). Plates were
incubated for 3 to 6 days at 30°C.
To study the putative functions of genes in Fe or Zn
transport, plasmid DNA was transformed into the yeast
fet3fet4DEY1453 or zrt1zrt2ZHY3 mutants or the wildtype strain DEY1457 by the same lithium acetate procedure described above. The fet3fet4DEY1453 double
mutant (MATa trp1 ura3 Δfet3::LEU2 Δfet4::HIS3)
lacked the Fet3 and Fet4 for Fe uptake [40]. The
zrt1zrt2ZHY3 double mutant (MATa ade6 can1 his3
leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3 zrt1::LEU2 zrt2::HIS3 Δfet3::LEU2
Δfet4::HIS3) lacked the Zrt1 and Zrt2 for Zn uptake
[41,42]. Yeast cells were grown in YPD (yeast extractpeptone) medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2%
glucose) to OD 600nm = 1.0. Several 10-fold diluted
clones were plated as drops on selective media containing 50 mM bathophenanthroinedisulfonic acid disodium
(BPDS) without or with supplement of Fe (FeSO4), or
containing 1 mM EDTA without or with supplement of
Zn (ZnSO 4 ). BPDS was a synthetic chelate of Fe and
EDTA was a synthetic chelate of Zn. Plates were incubated for 3 to 6 days at 30°C. The yeast strains transformed with empty vector were the negative controls.

Plasmid constructs

Protein-protein interaction in yeast cells

The full-length cDNAs of rice COPT2, COPT3, COPT4,
COPT6, and COPT7 genes were obtained by RT-PCR
using gene-specific primers (Additional file 1, Table S2).
The cDNAs of COPT2, COPT3, and COPT6 were subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of p413GPD(+His)
vector and the cDNAs of COPT4 and COPT7 were subcloned into the SpeI/EcoRI sites of p413GPD(+His)
separately [39]. The cDNA of S. cerevisiae Ctr1 was
amplified from yeast BY4741 using gene-specific primers
(Additional file 1, Table S2) and was inserted into the
SpeI/EcoRV sites of p413GPD(+His). All the cDNA
sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The
p413GPD(+His) plasmids carrying respective COPT1
and COPT5 were as reported previously [29].

The split-ubiquitin system was used to investigate the
interaction of rice COPTs. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)
Membrane Protein System Kit (MoBiTec, Goettingen,
Germany) was used for this type of assay according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. In this system, COPT
proteins fused with both the C-terminal half of the ubiquitin protein (Cub) and the mutated N-terminal half of
the ubiquitin protein (NubG). Cub could not interact
with NubG. When COPT proteins interacted, Cub and
NubG were forced into close proximity, resulting in the
activation of reporter gene. Each COPT full-length
cDNA amplified from rice variety Zhonghua 11 using
gene-specific primers (Additional file 1, Table S3) was
cloned into both vector pBT3-SUC and vector pPR3SUC; the 3’ ends of COPT cDNAs were fused with the
5’ end of the sequence encoding NubG. The insertion
fragments of all the vectors were examined by DNA
sequencing. Cub and NubG fusion constructs were cotransformed into host yeast strain NMY51. Interaction
was determined by the growth of yeast transformants on
medium lacking His or Ade and also by measuring bgalactosidase activity.

Functional complementation analyses in yeast

To study the putative function of genes in Cu transport,
plasmid DNA was transformed into the yeast ctr1Δctr3Δ
double-mutant strain MPY17 (MATa, ctr1::ura3::kanR,
ctr3::TRP1, lys2-801, his3), which lacked the Ctr1 and
Ctr3 for high-affinity Cu uptake, by the lithium acetate
procedure [14]. This mutant strain cannot grow on
ethanol/glycerol medium (YPEG: 1% yeast extract, 2%
Bactopeptone, 2% ethanol, 3% glycerol, 1.5% agar)
because it possesses a defective mitochondrial respiratory chain due to the inability of cytochrome c oxidase

Protein topology analyses

The localization of rice COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4
protein in S. cerevislae was analyzed by fusion of the

COPT gene with the green fluorescence protein (GFP)
gene using gene-specific primers (Additional file 1,
Table S4). Plasmid harboring the fusion gene was transformed into the S. cerevislae mutant MPY17 [29]. The
fluorescence signal was visualized with a LEICA
DM4000B fluorescent microscope.

Sequence analysis

Multiple-sequence alignment of amino acid sequences
was achieved with ClustalW program http://www.

parameters [44]. The transmembrane domains of proteins were predicted using the TMHMM program
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/.

Results
Rice COPT family has all the conserved features of known
COPT/Ctr-type Cu transporter genes

Analysis of the genomic sequences of rice variety Nipponbare (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) revealed seven
genes, COPT1 (Os01g56420; GenBank accession number
GQ387494), COPT2 (Os01g56430; HQ833653), COPT3
(Os03g25470; HQ833654), COPT4 (Os04g33900;
HQ833655), COPT5 (Os05g35050; GQ387495), COPT6
(Os08g35490; HQ833656), and COPT7 (Os09g26900;
HQ833657), that showed sequence homology with
COPT or Ctr genes from other species [29]. The seven
COPTs are located on six of the 12 rice chromosomes
(1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9) (Figure 1). Based on the annotation
of Rice Genome Annotation Project (RGAP; http://rice.
plantbiology.msu.edu/), all seven genes are intron-free.
The seven genes are G- and C-rich consisting more
than 72% G and C.
The rice COPT proteins share 35% to 64% sequence
identity and 47% to 73% sequence similarity each other
(Table 1) and have a similar structure (Figure 2), which

is similar to COPT/Ctr proteins in other species [11].
The central domains of rice COPTs are three transmembrane (TM) regions, TM1, TM2, and TM3 (Figure
2). TM1 and TM2 in the COPT/Ctr proteins of other
species are separated by a cytoplasmic loop [7,45]. Only
a few residues separate TM2 and TM3 of rice COPTs
(Figure 2). It has been reported that a short loop connecting TM2 and TM3 is essential for function and it
enforces a very tight spatial relationship between these
two TM segments at the extracellular side of plasma
membrane [46]. Rice TM2 harbors the MxxxM (x representing any amino acid) motif and TM3 contains the
GxxxG motif, together forming the characteristic
MxxxM-x12 -GxxxG motif of COPT/Ctr proteins [46].
COPT/Ctr proteins usually have an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus; the N-terminus is

generally rich in conserved methionine-rich motifs,
which are important for low level of Cu transport; the
C-terminus tends to contain cysteine- and/or histidinerich motifs, such as CxC, which binds Cu ions and
transfers them to cytosolic Cu chaperones [45,47]. All
these key features are present in rice COPTs. COPT1
and COPT5 have cytoplasmic C-termini [29]. The interactions of COPT2, COPT3, COPT4, COPT6, and
COPT7 with Alg5, a TM protein, in yeast cells using a
split-ubiquitin system for integral membrane proteins
[48] suggests that the other five rice COPTs also have
cytoplasmic C-termini (Figure 3). All seven COPTs have
one to four MxM or MxxM motifs at N-termini (Figure
2). The CC motif has been detected in rice COPT1,
COPT2, and COPT5 and CxC motif in rice COPT6 and
COPT7 at the C-termini (Figure 2).

A phylogenetic analysis was performed to examine the
evolutionary relationship of 31 COPT/Ctr proteins
among rice and other species. This analysis classified
these proteins into four groups (Figure 4). Group 1
includes Ctr proteins from humans (hCtr1 and hCtr2),
mouse (Mus musculus; mCtr1), lizard (Podarcis sicula;
PsCtr1), zebrafish (Danio rerio; DrCtr1), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster; DmCtr1A, DmCtr1B, DmCtr1C),
baker’s yeast (ScCtr2 and ScCtr3), fission yeast (S. pombe;
SpCtr4, SpCtr5, and SpCtr6), and ascomycetes (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides; CgCtr2). Group 2 consists of
seven rice COPTs (Oryza sativa; OsCOPT1 to
OsCOPT7) and five Arabidopsis COPTs (Arabidopsis
thaliana; AtCOPT1 to AtCOPT5). Group 3 includes two
Ctrs from ascomycetes (C. albicans; CaCtr1) and baker’s
yeast (ScCtr1), respectively. Group 4 consists of three
Ctrs from green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii;

Yuan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:69

CrCtr1, CrCtr2, and CrCtr3). This analysis suggests that
rice COPTs are evolutionarily related to Arabidopsis
COPTs rather than other COPT/Ctr proteins. Furthermore, rice COPT6 and COPT7 are more related to Arabidiopsis COPT5; rice COPT1 to COPT5 are more
related to Arabidopsis COPT1 to COPT4 (Figure 4).
Rice COPTs function alone or cooperatively as highaffinity Cu transporters in yeast

A recent study has revealed that rice COPT1 and
COPT5 alone or cooperatively cannot complement the
phenotype of yeast S. cerevisiae mutant MPY17, which
lacked the functions of Ctr1 and Ctr3 for Cu uptake;
however, rice COPT1 and COPT5 in cooperation with
another rice protein XA13 can mediate a low-affinity Cu
transport in yeast MPY17 mutant and the three proteins
also cooperatively mediate Cu transport in rice plants
[29]. To investigate the potential roles of the other five
rice COPT genes in Cu transport, these genes were
expressed separately in MPY17 mutant under the control of the constitutive yeast glyceraldehide-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GPD) gene promoter [39]. All the transformants were able to grow on SC-His, demonstrating
the presence of the expression vector or target gene
(Figure 5a). The lack of growth of MPY17 cells containing empty vector (negative control) was restored when
transformed with yeast ScCtr1 (positive control) in the
selective ethanol/glycerol (YPEG) medium without supplementation of Cu. Rice COPT7 but not rice COPT2,
COPT3, COPT4, or COPT6 could replace the function
of ScCtr1 in yeast cells. Expression of rice COPT7 alone
could efficiently complement the phenotype of MPY17
mutant in the medium without supplementation of Cu
as compared to the positive control (Figure 5a).
Rice COPT6 could efficiently complement MPY17
phenotype in the medium supplemented with 5 μM Cu
compared to the growth of MPY17 cells transformed
with COPT7 and the positive control, in the same medium (Figure 5a). Rice COPT3 and COPT4 could also
complement MPY17 growth in the medium supplemented with 5 μM Cu, but with a relatively low efficiency.
Like rice COPT1 and COPT5, rice COPT2 could not
complement MPY17 growth in the medium supplemented with 5 μM Cu compared to the negative control. To
determine whether expression of XA13 could enhance
the ability of COPT2, COPT3, COPT4, or COPT6 to
rescue the yeast mutant, we coexpressed these proteins
with XA13. Coexpression of COPT2, COPT3, COPT4,
or COPT6 with XA13 could not complement the phenotype of MPY17 (Additional file, Figure S1), which is
consistent with our previous results that these COPT
proteins can not interact with XA13 [29].
However, coexpression of COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4
with COPT6 efficiently complemented the phenotype of

COPT2-COPT3, COPT2-COPT4, or COPT3-COPT4
could not complement the phenotype of MPY17 (Figure
5b). To ascertain whether the cooperation of these two
proteins in Cu uptake in yeast cells was associated with
the physical contact of proteins, the interactions of
these COPTs were analyzed using the split-ubiquitin

system. All seven COPTs could form homodimers in
yeast cells (Figure 3). Consistent with the complementation analyses, COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4 could interact
with COPT6, in addition to the interaction of COPT1
with COPT5 as reported previously (Figure 3) [29]. No
other COPT pairs could form heterodimers in the yeast
cells. These results suggest that COPT7 alone and
COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4 cooperating with COPT6,
respectively, can mediate a highly efficient Cu transport
into yeast cells. In addition, COPT3, COPT4, or COPT6
alone appear to mediate low-affinity Cu transport in
yeast cells.
To ascertain whether the requirement of COPT2,
COPT3, or COPT4 with COPT6 to complement
MPY17 phenotype was due to COPT6 affecting the
localization of these proteins, we examined the localization of these proteins in the MPY17 cells by marking
them with GFP. The COPT2-GFP, COPT3-GFP, or
COPT4-GFP fusion protein was not or was not largely
localized in the plasma membrane of the yeast cells
when expressed alone (Figure 6). However, when coexpressed with COPT6, COPT2-GFP, COPT3-GFP, or
COPT4-GFP was largely localized in the plasma membrane. These results suggest that COPT6 may function
as a cofactor to help the efficient localization of COPT2,
COPT3, or COPT4 in the plasma membrane for mediating Cu transport.
Rice COPTs cannot transport Fe and Zn in yeast

Except for Cu uptake, COPT/Ctr proteins have been
reported to be involved in transport other substances
[49-51]. To ascertain whether rice COPTs had the capability of transporting other bivalent metal cations in
organisms, these COPT genes were expressed in yeast
S. cerevisiae mutants under the control of the GPD
gene promoter. The fet3fet4DEY1453 mutant lacked

the Fet3 and Fet4 proteins and was defective in both
low- and high-affinity Fe uptake [40]. In the same
selective BPDS media with or without supplement of
Fe, yeast mutant cells transformed with one of the
seven rice COPTs showed the same growth pattern as
the yeast mutant cells transformed with empty vector
(negative control); these cells did not grow in the medium without supplement of Fe (Additional file 1, Figure S2). However, the wild-type yeast strain DEY1457,
which was transformed with the empty vector, grew
well in the media in all the treatments. These results
suggest that none of the rice COPTs alone can mediate
Fe uptake in yeast.
The zrt1zrt2ZHY3 mutant lacked the Zrt1 and Zrt2
proteins for Zn uptake [41,42]. In the selective EDTA
media without supplement of Zn, the mutant cells
transformed with any one of the rice COPTs could not
grow as the cells transformed with empty vector (negative control), whereas the wild-type DEY1457 transformed with the empty vector grew well (Additional file
1, Figure S2). These results suggest that rice COPTs
alone cannot transport Zn in yeast either.
Since coexpression of COPT6 facilitated expression of
COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4 in the plasma membrane of
yeast cells (Figure 6), we coexpressed each two of the
four proteins in fet3fet4DEY1453 and zrt1zrt2ZHY3
yeast mutants. Coexpression of any two of the four proteins could not complement the phenotypes of the
mutants (Additional file 1, Figure S3). These results
further support the conclusion that rice COPTs cannot
transport Fe and Zn in yeast.
The expression of COPTs is influenced by multiple factors

To gain insight into the functions of rice COPTs, spatiotemporal and tissue-specific expression patterns of these
genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR or RT-PCR (it is difficult to design PCR primers to analyze some COPT
members by qRT-PCR). COPT1 and COPT5 showed
similar tissue- and development-specific expression patterns. The two genes had a higher level of expression in
root and leaf tissues compared to their expression levels
in sheath, stem, and panicle (Figure 7a). COPT4 showed
a higher expression level in root than in other tissues.
COPT1, COPT4, and COPT5 had higher expression
levels in young leaves than in old leaves, especially for
COPT1 and COPT4 (Figure 7b). COPT2 and COPT3
had relatively higher expression levels in leaf and panicle
than in other tissues and COPT7 had relatively higher
expression levels in root and leaf than in other tissues;
the three genes showed higher expression levels in old
leaves compared with young leaves. COPT6 was not
expressed in root and had a higher expression level in
leaf than in other tissues. COPT6 showed a constitutive
expression pattern in different-aged leaves.

The expression of rice COPT1 and COPT5 was influenced by Cu; COPT1 and COPT5 were induced by Cu
deficiency and suppressed by overdose of Cu in both
shoot and root tissues [29]. The expression of other five
rice COPTs, COPT2, COPT3, COPT4, COPT6, and
COPT7, was also influenced by the change of Cu levels
(Figure 8). COPT7 showed a similar response as COPT1
and COPT5 to Cu deficiency and overdose (50 μM) in
both shoot and root compared to the control plants cultured in the medium containing 0.2 μM Cu. Although
COPT6 showed constitutive expression in different aged
leaves at adult stage (Figure 7b), it had a low level of
expression in shoot tissue at seedling stage (Figure 8a).
However, COPT6 was induced in Cu deficiency and
suppressed in Cu overdose in shoot and no COPT6
expression was detected either with or without Cu deficiency in root (Figure 8). The expression of COPT2,
COPT3, and COPT4 was suppressed in Cu overdose and
was not obviously influenced in Cu deficiency in both
shoot and root tissues.
Interestingly, other bivalent cations also influenced
expression of COPTs (Figure 8a). Mn deficiency induced
COPT1 in root and COPT3 and COPT7 in shoot, and
slightly suppressed COPT2 and COPT4 in root. Zn deficiency induced COPT1, COPT5, and COPT7 and slightly
suppressed COPT4 in root and induced COPT5, COPT6,

and COPT7 in shoot. Fe deficiency slightly induced
COPT1 and suppressed COPT2 and COPT5 in root and
induced COPT2, COPT5, COPT6, and COPT7 in shoot.
No COPT6 expression was detected either with or without Mn, Zn, or Fe deficiency in root (Figure 8a).
Xoo strain PXO99 induced expression of COPT1 and
COPT5, which encoding proteins interacted with XA13
protein to facilitate Xoo infection [29]. To ascertain
whether the expression of other COPTs was also
response to pathogen infection, rice plants were inoculated with different Xoo strains. Infection of Xoo strain
PXO99 could not induce COPT2, COPT3, COPT4,
COPT6, or COPT7 (Additional file 1, Figure S4). Infection of Xoo strain PXO66 appeared slightly induced in
COPT1 and COPT5, although the induction was statistically not significant (P > 0.05), but not in other COPTs
(Additional file 1, Figure S5). These results suggest that
COPT members may function differently in different tissues, different developmental stages, and different
environments.

Discussion
The present results suggest that rice COPT2, COPT3,
COPT4, COPT6, and COPT7, which function alone or
cooperatively, can replace the roles of ScCtr1 and
ScCtr3 for Cu uptake in S. cerevisiae. Previous studies

have reported that a single plasma membrane-localized
COPT/Ctr-type Cu transporter from human (hCtr1),
mouse (mCtr1), Arabidopsis (AtCOPT1, 2, 3, and 5),
lizard (PsCtr1), Drosophila (DmCtr1A, B, and C), or
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrCTR1 and CrCTR2)
could complement the phenotype of S. cerevisiae
ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant [13,16,17,23,24,28,52]. The fission
yeast (S. pombe) SpCtr4 and SpCtr5 form a heteromeric
plasma membrane complex to complement the S. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant [19]; coexpression of this complex could also restore the phenotype of S. pombe
ctr4Δctr5Δ mutant JSY22 [21,53]. Rice COPT1, COPT5,
and the MtN3/saliva-type protein XA13, which cooperatively mediate Cu transport in rice, can also complement

the phenotype of the S. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant
[29]. These results suggest that the S. cerevisiae
ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant is a valuable model to study the roles
of COPT/Ctr-type proteins from different species
including rice in Cu transport. Thus, based on the
effects of different rice COPTs on the growth of
ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant cells on the selective media and the
expression patterns of these COPT genes in response to
the variation of Cu concentration in rice, we argue that
COPT2, COPT3, COPT4, COPT6, and COPT7 may
mediate Cu transport in rice alone or in cooperation
with other COPTs.
COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4 may cooperate with
COPT6 for Cu transport in different rice tissues except

Yuan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:69
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/69

for root. This hypothesis is supported by the following
evidence. First, the complementation of the phenotype
of S. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant by coexpression of
COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4 with COPT6 was consistent
with the capability of the physical interaction of COPT2,
COPT3, or COPT4 with COPT6 (Figures 3 and 5b).
Second, COPT2, COPT3, COPT4, and COPT6 were all
expressed in stem, sheath, leaf, and panicle tissues (Figure 7). The similar and tissue-specific expression patterns of COPT1 and COPT5 (Figure 7) are consistent
with their cooperative role in Cu transport in shoot and
root reported previously [29]. However, COPT3,
COPT4, or COPT6 alone appeared to mediate a lowaffinity Cu transport in yeast cells, suggesting that they
may be also involved in a low-affinity Cu transport in
different rice tissues or rice Cu deficiency alone,
although further in planta study is required to examine
this hypothesis. This hypothesis is supported by the evidence that COPT3 and COPT4 had a relatively high
level of expression in root, but no expression of COPT6
was detected in root; furthermore, the expression of
COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 but not COPT6 in leaves
was developmentally regulated (Figure 7). In addition,
the expression of COPT6 but not COPT2, COPT3, and
COPT4 was strongly induced by Cu deficiency in rice
shoot (Figure 8). The present results also suggest that
COPT7 may be capable of mediating Cu transport alone
in rice. According to its expression pattern, COPT7 may
function in different tissues and also in Cu deficiency.
Except for Cu uptake, human hCtr1 could transport
silver (Ag) [51]. This capability of the hCtr1 occurs
because Ag(I) is isoelectronic to Cu(I) and thus Ag competes for Cu as the substrate of the hCtr1 [22]. Furthermore, ScCtr1, mCtr1, and hCtr1 could also transport
the anticancer drug cisplatin [49,50]. None of the rice
COPTs could restore the Fe- or Zn-uptake functions of
the yeast mutants (Additional file 1, Figures S2, S3).
Overexpressing COPT1 or COPT5 or suppressing
COPT1 or COPT5 in rice had no influence on Fe, Mn,
and Zn contents in rice shoot [29]. These results suggest
that rice COPTs may function specifically for Cu transport among bivalent ions like the other COPT/Ctr proteins [32]. That the COPT/Ctr proteins could transport
Cu but not Fe, Mn, and Zn may be related to their protein features. The TM domains of COPT/Ctr may form
a symmetrical homotrimer or heterotrimer channel
architecture with a 9-Å diameter that is suitable only for
Cu(I) transport but not other bivalent ions, such as Mn,
Zn, or Fe [33].
However, all the rice COPTs were transcriptionally
activated or suppressed by Fe, Mn, or Zn deficiency
(Figure 8a). A balance of the concentrations of Cu with
other bivalent ions appears to be associated with their
uptake. The yeast S. cerevisiae Ctr1 mutants and

Page 10 of 12

deletion strains have deficiency in Fe uptake [12]. The
high-affinity Fe uptake is influenced by Cu concentration in ascomycetes C. albicans; deletion of CaCTR1 for
Cu uptake results in defective Fe uptake [26]. Excess
metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, or cadmium) significantly influenced Cu uptake mediated by human hCtr1 [22]. A
yeast S. pombe ctr6 mutant displays a strong reduction
of Zn superoxide dismutase activity [20]. Thus, further
study is required to determine whether other bivalent
ion levels influence Cu uptake in rice.
Xoo causes bacterial blight, which is one of the most
devastating diseases restricting rice production worldwide. Rice COPT1, COPT5, and XA13 cooperate to promote removal of Cu from rice xylem vessels, where Xoo
multiplies and spreads to cause disease [29]. COPT1,
COPT5, and Xa13 can facilitate the infection of Xoo
strain PXO99 because this bacterium can transcriptionally activate them [29]. The present results suggest that
Xoo-induced expression of COPT1 and COPT5 is race
specific. Although PXO99 can induce COPT1 and
COPT5 [29], the expression of the two genes was not
markedly influenced by Xoo strain PXO61 in the infection sites (Additional file 1, Figure S5). Neither PXO61
nor PXO99 influenced the expression of rice COPT2,
COPT3, COPT4, COPT6, and COPT7 in the infection
sites, suggesting that these COPT genes are not directly
involved in the interactions between rice and at least
the two Xoo strains.

Conclusion
Like rice COPT1 and COPT5 [29], rice COPT2,
COPT3, COPT4, COPT6, and COPT7 also appear to be
plasma membrane proteins for they can replace the
roles of S. cerevisiae plasma membrane-localized ScCtr1
and ScCtr3 for Cu uptake. However, different from
COPT1 and COPT5, the other five COPTs may not be
directly associated with the rice-Xoo interaction. The
present results provide tissue and interaction targets of
different COPTs for further study of their roles in Cu
transport and associated physiological activities in rice.
