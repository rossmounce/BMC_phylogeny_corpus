Abstract
Background: The Drosophila Odorant-Binding Protein (Obp) genes constitute a multigene family
with moderate gene number variation across species. The OS-E and OS-F genes are the two
phylogenetically closest members of this family in the D. melanogaster genome. In this species, these
genes are arranged in the same genomic cluster and likely arose by tandem gene duplication, the
major mechanism proposed for the origin of new members in this olfactory-system family.
Results: We have analyzed the genomic cluster encompassing OS-E and OS-F genes (Obp83
genomic region) to determine the role of the functional divergence and molecular adaptation on
the Obp family size evolution. We compared nucleotide and amino acid variation across 18
Drosophila and 4 mosquito species applying a phylogenetic-based maximum likelihood approach
complemented with information of the OBP three-dimensional structure and function. We show
that, in spite the OS-E and OS-F genes are currently subject to similar and strong selective
constraints, they likely underwent divergent evolution. Positive selection was likely involved in the
functional diversification of new copies in the early stages after the gene duplication event;
moreover, it might have shaped nucleotide variation of the OS-E gene concomitantly with the loss
of functionally related members. Besides, molecular adaptation likely affecting the functional OBP
conformational changes was supported by the analysis of the evolution of physicochemical
properties of the OS-E protein and the location of the putative positive selected amino acids on
the OBP three-dimensional structure.
Conclusion: Our results support that positive selection was likely involved in the functional
differentiation of new copies of the OBP multigene family in the early stages after their birth by
gene duplication; likewise, it might shape variation of some members of the family concomitantly
with the loss of functionally related genes. Thus, the stochastic gene gain/loss process coupled with
the impact of natural selection would influence the observed OBP family size.

Background
The olfactory system of animals allows individuals detecting enormously diverse information from the external
environment, being in most species a fundamental feature
for their survival and reproduction. Natural selection,
therefore, likely plays an important role in the evolution
of olfactory-involved genes. Actually, there is compelling
evidence for the action of positive selection in the evolution of these genes, both in insects and in vertebrates [e.g.
[1-7]. In addition, olfactory-specific gene families might
contribute to the host-specificity shifts occurring in the
diversification of super-specialist Drosophila species [8,9].
The primary step in the olfactory perception is accomplished by the Odorant-Binding Proteins (OBPs). In spite
of the similar global function of insect and vertebrate
OBPs, these two protein families are evolutionarily unrelated [10]. In insects, OBPs are small globular proteins
that bind odorant molecules (including pheromones) at
the pores of the chemosensory sensilla, transporting them
through the aqueous lymph, and delivering their ligands
near the olfactory receptors (OR) [11,12]. In addition,
OBPs might play a role in the olfactory coding [13,14], as
well as in the stimulus inactivation [15-17]. While some
OBPs co-express in the same individual sensilla, some
others have strikingly different expression patterns [18].
Currently, the OBP three-dimensional (3D) structures of
several insects have been determined [reviewed in [19];
these proteins share similar folds, although with significant structural differences (protein length, position and
conformation of α-helices, loops and C-terminus), resulting in diverse solvent access properties.
The Obp repertory in the genus Drosophila constitutes a
multigene family composed by a moderately variable
number of members (from 40 to 61 genes) [9,18,20].
Results in [9] have shown that the Obp genes evolve
through a birth-and-death process; the new members
originate by tandem gene duplications and gradually
diverge in sequence and likely in function. The OS-E
(DmelObp83a) and OS-F (DmelObp83b) genes are the two
closest paralogous Obp members of the D. melanogaster
genome. These genes, located in the 3R chromosome, are
separated by ~1 kb intergenic region and show a highly
similar gene structure and protein sequence similarity (the
mature protein has 70% amino acid identity) [21]. These
genes also co-express in the same specific subset of olfactory sensilla (mainly in the sensilla trichoidea) of the D.
melanogaster antennal segment 3 [22].
DNA polymorphism and divergence analyses at the OS-E
and OS-F genes in the melanogaster [23] and in the old
world obscura [Sánchez-Gracia and Rozas, unpublished
data) subgroup species of Drosophila have shown that
these olfactory genes might have evolved non-neutrally.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/323

Nevertheless, no firm conclusions regarding the precise
evolutionary mechanism could be drawn; therefore, the
specific role that natural selection might play in the evolutionary history of this gene duplication, and especially in
the origin and maintenance of the duplicated copies, it is
still unknown.
Here, we investigate the mechanisms driving the evolution of the genomic cluster encompassing the OS-E and
OS-F genes (the Obp83 genomic region) in 18 species of
the Drosophila genus. We integrate amino acid and nucleotide-based divergence data, with the analysis of the selective constraints and information of the OBP 3D structure
and function, to infer the impact of positive and negative
selection in the evolutionary history of these genes. We are
especially interested in determining the origin and evolutionary fate of these Obp genes within the context of a
multigene family submitted to a birth-and-death process.
We found that functional differentiation, with an active
role of positive selection, might contribute to the Obp
family evolution across Drosophila species. We also show
that the evolution of the physicochemical-properties of
these proteins suggests that the functional divergence
might arise through changes affecting the OBP conformational shift mechanisms, modifying the specificity, sensitivity or accessibility of OBPs to the odorants, to the Ors
or to other molecules required to the correct odorant perception.

Results
The Obp83 genomic region in the genus Drosophila
We have identified orthologs of the OS-E and OS-F genes
in the 15 species surveyed of the Sophophora subgenus. In
all cases, the two genes have the same orientation, wellconserved exon sizes, and show equivalent intron-exon
boundary positions and intron phases; furthermore, the
close physical distance that these two OS genes have in D.
melanogaster is also conserved across this subgenus. By
contrast, the OS-E gene is absent in D. virilis, D. mojavensis
and D. grimshawi; these species, and also D. willistoni, have
a new OS-like gene, named here as OS-X gene (Obp83aL1
in [9]) (Figure 1). This new gene localizes 5' upstream (~3
kb apart) from the OS-F gene, with the same orientation
and a very similar gene structure. The dot-plot analyses
corroborate that only D. willisoni have all these three Obp
related sequences [see Additional file 1]. These findings,
together with the high sequence similarity between the
OS-X and their neighbour genes (the amino acid identity
of the hypothetical OS-X protein with OS-E and OS-F is
53.3% and 61.4%, respectively), and its position in the
Drosophila Obp phylogenetic tree [9], clearly indicate that
OS-X is an old Obp83 member that arose by a gene duplication event. The exhaustive search across databases
allows identifying 5 putative members of the Obp83 group

the reported amino acid replacement found in this species
[23] would be a specific feature of the sequenced line, as
a genetic polymorphism. In overall, the studied OBPs differ in 31.32 amino acids; none of the replacements, nevertheless, would significantly alter the typical secondary
structure of the PBP/GOBP protein family (results not
shown). Analysis of the synonymous (KS) and nonsynonymous (KA) nucleotide sequence divergence across the
Sophophora subgenus reveals that OS-E gene (KA = 0.049;
KS = 1.040) evolves more rapidly than OS-F (KA = 0.036;
KS = 0.743). Indeed, using the A. gambiae Obp1 gene as
outgroup, the evolutionary rate differ significantly (RRT; P
= 0.05). The phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3) shows 3 separated clades, one for each Drosophila orthologous group,
suggesting an independent evolution since their origin by
gene duplication. Estimated gene trees and commonly
accepted species tree [[24] and Figure 1] are not completely concordant, likely because of the short sequence
length examined; indeed, nodes with discrepancies also
have low posterior probability values.
Bayesian trees based on protein and nucleotide divergence
indicate that the OS-E and OS-F genes existed before the
split of the Sophophora and Drosophila subgenera; later, the
Drosophila subgenera lineage lost the OS-E gene (Figure
1). Even using an algorithm more sensitive than BLAST
[25], we did not find any vestige of the OS-E gene in the
genome of the three Drosophila subgenus species suggesting, therefore, that this gene has been completely erased.
In agreement with previous results [23] the distribution of
nucleotide substitutions across the DNA sequence is not
homogeneous: both genes are highly divergent in the so
called heterogeneous region (region het 1, encompassing
the amino acid positions 68 to 90 in the Drosophila OS-E
protein; [23]), and in the first 30 amino acids of the N-terminal part of the mature protein (referred here as het2).
Selective constraints and functional divergence
Gene duplication-specific changes in the substitution
rates (type I functional divergence) might reflect variations in selective constraints after gene duplication
[26,27]. We detected evidences of type I functional divergence between OS-E and OS-F proteins (θλI = 0.411; P =
0.006), and between OS-F and OS-X proteins (θλI = 0.534;
P = 0.019); namely, there are some amino acid sites with
discrepancies in their evolutionary rate between these paralogous pairs. The OS-E/OS-X comparison was not significant (θλI = 0.001; P > 0.05). As expected, most amino
acids have very low posterior probability (PP) values and,
therefore, they would not be involved on the hypothetical
functional divergence (Figure 4). Specifically, we detected
nine and seven amino acid positions (with PP threshold
values higher than 0.65) in the OS-E/OS-F and in the OSF/OS-X comparisons, respectively. Besides, five of these
functional divergence candidate positions are the same in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/323

the two comparisons. We repeated the analysis removing
positions with the highest score values, until θλI was not
significantly different from 0. Using this strongly conservative criterion, the firm candidates to be involved in the
functional divergence reduce to two (63 and 73) and one
(23) positions, in the previous comparisons. Type I functional divergence may be driven by either site-specific
functional constraint relaxations, or by the acquisition of
new functions in the one of the duplicated copies. To discriminate between these two hypotheses we infer the
functional constraint levels before the gene duplication
event by examining the pattern of variation either at the
OS-X or the mosquito homologous proteins. We found
that unambiguous sites are always more compatible with
the relaxation (or loss) of the functional constraint scenario (Figures 2 and 4), and that all three Drosophila OBP
proteins would exhibit functionally diverged relaxed positions. Interestingly, the putative functional diverged positions shared between the two comparisons always involve
relaxations in OS-E or OS-X, but not in OS-F protein. On
the other hand, although there are some radical replacements differently fixed between paralogs, we failed to
detect any significant type II (cluster-specific) functional
divergence.
The analysis of the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio can also be used to detect functional
differentiation; for this purpose, we used the unrooted
tree in Figure 5. Estimates of the overall ω ratio from the
OS-E/OS-F MSA (ω = 0.064) indicates that purifying selection has been the predominant force acting on the evolution of these Drosophila OBPs. Selective constrains,
however, are unevenly distributed across the phylogeny
(FR model; P = 0.020). These differences across lineages,
however, are not explained by differences between the
duplicated copies (the simplest M0 model fits the data
better than the M0dup model, P = 0.495). We also
detected a significant heterogeneity in the ω values across
sites (M3 model with three site classes fits the data better
than M0 model; P = 8.376 × 10-27). Nevertheless, the test
fails to detect evidences of positive selection across the
whole MSA; since positive selection will likely affect a few
amino acids at specific lineages on the phylogeny, models
estimating ω ratios averaged by codons or by lineages are
certainly highly conservative. Therefore, we applied an ad
hoc branch-site approach (using some pre-specified
branches, i.e., foreground branches), to assess whether
molecular adaptation occurred in the evolution of the OSE and OS-F genes in Drosophila. Since we had detected,
using a polymorphism to divergence comparative analysis, departures from the standard neutral model in the
evolution of OS-E gene in D. melanogaster and in D.
guanche [[23], Sánchez-Gracia and Rozas, unpublished
results], we first evaluated whether the heterogeneity in
the selective pressures detected across lineages might be

specific positions of these lineages (Figure 5). In spite that
null hypothesis of the test 2 (ω = 1) was not rejected, the
D. guanche OS-E gene (b1) exhibits several positions with
evidence of relaxed selection (the test 1 was significant)
(Table 1); interestingly, many relaxed amino acid positions are located in the highly variable het1 region. On the
contrary, we did not detect site-specific selective-pressure
changes along the D. melanogaster OS-E branch (b2). Likewise, we also searched for the specific signature that positive selection associated to the birth-and-death process
might leave on coding DNA sequence data. For this purpose, we chose internal branches involving gene gains or
losses as the foreground in the branch-site analysis (Figure

5; branches b3, b4, b5 and b6). The analysis shows significant evidences (Table 1) that positive selection might act
on specific positions in the early stages after the OS-E/OSF gene duplication (after the gene gain; branch b3 in Figure 5), but also on OS-E gene concomitantly with the lineage-specific loss of the OS-X gene (a member of the same
genomic cluster; branch b4 in Figure 5).
The molecular adaptation processes occurred after the
gene duplication event were also investigated by comparing the magnitude of the physicochemical changes produced by the observed amino acid replacements with
those expected at random [28]. The null hypothesis (selective neutrality) was rejected (goodness of fit tests; P <

That is, some amino acid replacements altering these
physicochemical properties in the OS-E protein accumulated more (or less) often than expected by chance (likely
reflecting fitness differences). Moreover, for each physicochemical property, the distribution of the z-scores across 8
magnitude classes [29] indicates that, for some properties,
there is a significant excess of non-synonymous substitutions at the most extreme magnitude-classes (Figure 6);
these OS-E protein properties, therefore, are likely evolving under positive selection. The OS-F gene, on the contrary, seems to evolve under strict neutrality, or under
strong purifying selection. Interestingly, the position of
some OS-E amino acid replacements contributing to the
significant excess observed at individual physicochemical
magnitude categories match with positions identified in
the branch-site analysis (Table 1).
Since the OS-E and OS-F genes are phylogenetically closed
and share gene expression patterns [21,22], they might
exhibit a coevolving pattern. Indeed, we found statistically
significant amino acid covariation between these OBPs (P
< 0.001), which might reflect functional or structural constraints. Again, most predicted coevolving positions
involve amino acids located in (or close to) the het1
region (Figure 7). Outside this variable region, amino

acids at positions 3 and 45 of the OS-E protein would be
excellent candidates to have co-evolved with amino acids
of the OS-F het1 region.
Sequence variation on the OBP 3D structure
To determine the functional meaning of the relevant
amino acid replacements identified in previous analyses
we studied their location in the predicted OBP 3D structure (the putative ancestor of the OS-E and OS-F proteins). We first built an energy-minimized model using a
homology modelling approach [30]. The PDB entry with
the highest sequence similarity -identified in the PSIBLAST- corresponds to the A. gambiae OBP1 (PDB: 2ERB).
We used this entry as a template for the modelling. The in
silico stereochemical quality analysis [31] indicates that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/323

the generated model has a very good quality (the 95.24%
of the residues in the most favoured regions), with no residues in disallowed regions. As expected, the modelled
structure is roughly similar than the template, with the six
helices typical of the OBP family in equivalent positions
and with a similar predicted folding (Figure 8).
We first determined the location of the variable regions in
the 3D structure; the het1 region lies at α-helices D and E
with their connecting loop, while the het2 variable region
is at the N-terminal part of the protein, encompassing the
complete first α-helix. Figure 8 also shows the location in
the 3D structure of the relevant positively selected amino
acid positions and those inferred to contribute to type I
functional divergence (with high PP values). Interestingly,

most of the selectively relaxed amino acid sites inferred in
D. guanche OS-E protein and some of the positions
responsible of the positive selection are located in the het1
region, and therefore nearby in the 3D protein structure.
This suggests that this part of the protein has an important
functional role. Since the first α-helix and the C-terminal
end of the protein also appear to be the target of positive
selection, molecular adaptation should have affected different OBP protein domains. Otherwise, amino acid positions candidates to be under type I functional divergence
are more homogeneously distributed along the 3D structure (results not shown): two of the tree positions with
high PP values, however, are also in the functionally
important predicted protein domains.

Discussion
Origin of the OS-E/OS-F gene duplication
The OS-E and OS-F genes encode the two phylogenetic
closest odorant binding protein members of the D. melanogaster genome [9,20]. We have identified orthologs of
the OS-E gene only in the Sophophora subgenus species,
with no evidence in D. virilis, D. mojavensis and D. grimshawi (Figure 1). The analysis in [21] led to the same result
in D. virilis but they detected two OS-E like genes in Scaptodrosophila lebanonensis, a basal species of Drosophila
genus. In fact, in [32] authors proposed that the two OS-E
and OS-F genes have orthologous copies in A. gambiae.
Our phylogenetically-based analysis support the hypothesis that the OS-E and OS-F gene duplication predates the

Page 10 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:323

Drosophila and Sophophora subgenera split, but does not
agree with [32] findings. Most likely, the Anopheles
homologous sequences are in fact co-orthologs of the Drosophila OS-E and OS-F genes, i.e. the Drosophila gene copies arose by a gene duplication event after the split of the
Nematocera and Brachycera taxa (about 250 Mya). We
have to notice, however, that the different evolutionary
rates of OS-E and OS-F genes might constitute a confounding factor. The duplication might have occurred
after the Drosophila-Sophophora subgenus split, followed
by evolutionary rate acceleration. This scenario would be
consistent with the [21] analysis; these authors, nevertheless, only surveyed a very short fragment (the het 1
region), which -in addition- we have found that might
have evolved by positive selection. Consequently, the
most plausible scenario would indicate that Obp83
genomic region had the OS-X, OS-E and OS-F genes
before the Sophophora-Drosophila subgenera split (Figure
1); nevertheless, further experimental analyses using more
distant Drosophila species would be required for a complete assessment.
Functional divergence between OS-E and OS-F genes
Results in [9] have shown that the Obp gene family has
evolved following a birth-and-death model [33]. Under
this model, contrarily to the concerted evolution model,
new functional genes often evolve through regulatory or
functional differentiation. Accordingly, a number of Obp
family members differ in gene expression patterns [18,20]
or in functional constraints [9]. In the [34] classical view,
the functional diversification of duplicated copies is
driven by positive selection (i.e. the neofunctionalization
model). Otherwise, gene duplicates might also differentiate by acquiring independent sub-functions, being all of
them required for carry out the original function. This
functional subdivision might be promoted by positive
selection [35,36] or be the result of the accumulation of
degenerative mutations (i.e., causing a complementary
loss of function; the subfunctionalization model) [37].
This later model is, nonetheless, usually considered into
the evolution of cis-regulatory elements.

In D. melanogaster, the OS-E and OS-F genes have the same
temporal gene expression pattern [22,38]. In fact, OS-E,
OS-F and LUSH proteins co-localize not only in the sensillar fluid, but also in the same intracellular compartment of the supporting cells before endocytosis [39].
Therefore, it seems unlikely that OS-E and OS-F genes
might differ on the regulatory temporal or spatial pattern
of gene expression. Nevertheless, these genes might differ
on their quantitative gene expression patterns (unfortunately, the amount of protein produced for each gene is
still unknown). It has been shown that gene expression
levels are negatively correlated with evolutionary rates
[40]. Here we found that the OS-E evolves more rapidly

than OS-F. The highly conserved large first intron (the
~1.7 kb that separate the 5' untranslated and the first coding exon) in all OS-F genes might contribute to explain
this result. This intron is absent in the OS-E genes and has
two highly conserved fragments (results not shown),
which might contain regulatory regions. This feature, that
has been associated with reduced evolutionary rates and
high gene expression levels [41], might explain the evolutionary rate differences between OS-E and OS-F and perhaps putative differences in the gene expression levels.
If the functional diversification between OS-E and OS-F
genes was promoted by changes on the coding region
these genes might have evolved with asymmetric evolutionary rates. The OS-E and OS-F gene duplication is
recent enough to allow studying the evolutionary forces
acting at the early stages after gene gains in the Obp family.
Here, we have found that OS-E and OS-F genes evolved
with different substitution rates; nevertheless, the overall
functional constraint level (measured as the ω parameter)
is high and very similar in the two genes. Although relatively ancient duplicates can exhibit similar functional
constraint levels [42], they might have differed in a short
period of time after the duplication event. In this sense,
we have detected both significant type I divergence among
OBPs, likely resulting from site-specific relaxations, and
the footprint of positive natural selection in the early
stages after the OS-E/OS-F gene duplication. Hence, these
two forces would affect the evolutionary fate of new Obp
family members, initially originated by tandem gene
duplications. Since the shifts in the evolutionary rate
(detected as type I functional divergence) occurred in different and complementary positions of each duplicated
pair, this would point to some functional subdivision,
perhaps with a complementary loss (or relaxation) of
function at different protein domains. Likewise, we found
that positive selection might also act concomitant to some
lineage-specific losses of members from the same cluster,
suggesting that these within-cluster OBPs should be functionally connected. This functional connection might
arise through the formation of OBP dimers at physiological conditions [[43] and references therein]. Natural selection might promote heterodimers via the increase of the
combinatory potential of the OBP (increasing either the
spectrum of possible target odorants or the binding-specificity) and maintaining, therefore, the co-localization of
different OBPs in the same cells. Interestingly, we did not
find evidences of functional divergence between OS-E and
OS-X proteins, which share a similar functional divergence behaviour with respect to OS-F. Moreover, all extant
species (except D. willistoni) only have one of these two
genes. It is possible that OS-F dimerize with either OS-E or
OS-X in the sensillar fluid generating quaternary structures with an equivalent functional role. Although, it is
unknown whether in the past OS-E and OS-X really co-

expressed in the same cells, it would be very attractive to
investigate the expression pattern of the three Obp genes
of D. willistoni (the single species where OS-E and OS-X
currently coexists). The analysis of gene expression data
and of the functional quaternary structure might give critical insights into the role of dimerization on the molecular evolution of the Obp genes.

over, the selective relaxation might be related with a ecologically driven speciation, as has been suggested in other
Drosophila species [8,9]. Actually, discriminating between
positive and relaxed negative selection is not an easy task;
even so, since the het1 region is functionally important we
cannot completely discard that positive selection might in
fact also drive the evolution of D. guanche OS-E gene.

Positively selected sites in the OBP structure
We have detected several sites that likely evolved by positive selection. One of these positions (23), placed in the
helix A of the OBP, might alter the size and shape of the
binding cavity by modifying the position of the first
disulfide bridge [19,44]; for instance, D. melanogaster
LUSH, which has the first α-helix in a more internal position than in A. mellifera ASP1, has also a small binding
cavity. We also detected putative positive selected sites
located in the C-terminal end of the protein (115 and
120). In ASP1 this domain folds inside the protein forming one binding cavity wall and contains residues that
interact directly with the ligand; conformational changes
in this part of the protein trigger the ligand release close to
the odorant receptor [45,46]. Moreover, in LUSH, amino
acid substitutions in this part of the protein have also
been related with the pheromone-induced conformational shift that triggers the firing of pheromone-sensitive
neurons [14]. Interestingly, the structure of this region is
the most divergent among the 4 OBPs with resolved 3D
proteins: it presents different lengths, secondary structure,
or it is even missing. Likely, replacements in these two
regions can significantly affect the conformational and the
ligand-binding properties of the OBPs, being therefore a
major target for adaptive changes.

Physicochemical evolution and molecular adaptation
The evolutionary analysis of the physicochemical properties might provide insights into the functional divergence
occurred across OBPs. We show that OS-E/OS-F duplicates have a markedly different behaviour. While the OSF protein has been largely affected by purifying selection,
both stabilizing and adaptive positive selection was
inferred for the OS-E. Indeed, we identified the footprint
of the positive-destabilizing selection on two physicochemical properties (Figure 6). Pα is a conformational
property [50] related to the length and flexibility of alpha
helices and, therefore, to the accessibility of specific
amino acids (as those involved in interacting motifs of the
protein). OBPs are small globular α-helical proteins and,
therefore, could be largely affected by these changes. pK'
influences the association and disassociation constants of
amino acids, affecting the protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions characteristics. Thus, positive selection
might promote functional divergence modifying the
binding specificities, or altering the conformational
changes involved in the OBP functional mechanism [e.g.
[14,45,46,51]]. Additionally, our results also indicate that
positive stabilizing selection has acted on the OS-E protein evolution. It has been shown that in globular proteins
two (Pc and F) of the three physicochemical properties
related to positive stabilizing selection are highly-negatively correlated with protein compressibility [52], and
would be essential in maintaining the globular structure
and the buried nature of the binding-cavity. In spite that
the radical changes detected in our study likely produce
important functional changes between the OS-E and OSF proteins, we cannot discard that other detected conservative replacements also have an important adaptive role
[see for example [53]]. Indeed, some of the conservative
changes contributing to the excess of amino acid replacements detected in the OS-E protein might cause weakly
but relevant functional changes in either the OBP binding-activity or in ligand-specificity suggesting, therefore,
the action of adaptive instead of stabilizing selection.

The third protein region that might be shaped by molecular adaptation comprises the α-helices D and E (Figure 8).
This region includes both hydrophobic residues covering
the binding cavity and exposed amino acids that might be
involved in protein-protein interactions. Noticeably, most
of the residues (7 out 9) detected in the coevolution analysis (Figure 7) lies in this part of the protein and are
exposed to the solvent. Indeed, in the proposed A. gambiae
OBP17 homodimer, the dimeric interface primarily
engage the fourth and fifth helices [47]. Moreover, in this
same region also localize many D. guanche replacements
with a distinctive evolutionary pattern (Table 1). Several
authors suggested [48,49] that the very small effective
population size of this insular-endemic species would
increase the fixation probability of slightly deleterious
mutations (as "unpreferent" synonymous mutations, or
amino acid replacements). Under this scenario, the amino
acid replacements detected in the OS-E protein of D.
guanche would be slightly deleterious mutations fixed by
genetic drift and, therefore, would indicate a functional
constraint relaxation rather than positive selection. More-

Conclusion
The comparative genomic analysis of the Obp multigene
family in Drosophila [9] has revealed that a birth-anddeath model could explain the differences in the number
of Obp members across species. Here we found that
molecular adaptation can also play an important role in
the evolution of this olfactory gene family. Indeed, posi-

tive selection was likely involved in the functional differentiation of new copies in the early stages after the gene
duplication event; likewise, it might shape variation of
some members of the family concomitantly with the loss
of functionally related genes. The stochastic gene gain/loss
process coupled with the impact of natural selection
would determine the observed family size [see also [54]].
Nevertheless, further functional experiments would be
required to demonstrate the adaptive character of the
amino acids inferred as positively selected. The analysis of
the non-coding flanking regions is also critical; particularly the putative regulatory sequences of the OS-E and
OS-F genes to investigate putative fine-tuning differences
in their gene expression patterns. All these studies and
experiments will certainly contribute to better understand
the precise role of natural selection and molecular adaptation in the evolution of chemoreception.

Methods
Fly samples and databases
We studied 18 species of the Drosophila genus (15 and 3
species of the Sophophora and Drosophila subgenera,
respectively; Figure 1). We used highly inbreed lines (10
generations of sib mating) of D. teissieri, D. yakuba, D.
ananassae (species kindly provided by F. Lemeunier), D.
pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. miranda (species kindly
provided by R. C. Lewontin), D. subobscura, D. guanche,
and D. madeirensis (species available in our laboratory). In
addition, we also analyze DNA sequence data from D.
melanogaster (AJ574644), D. simulans (AJ567753), D.
mauritiana (AJ563750) and D. erecta AJ574775-AJ574776
[23].
DNA extraction and sequencing
Total genomic DNA of D. yakuba, D. teissieri, D. ananassae,
D. pseudoobscura, D. miranda, D. persimilis, D. guanche, D.
madeirensis and D. subobscura was extracted from live flies
by using a modification of protocol 48 in [55]. DNA fragments, including the complete coding region of the OS-E
and OS-F genes, were amplified by using the PCR protocol
[56]. In addition to the primers previously used for the
amplification of the OS-region in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. mauritiana and D. erecta [23], we designed additional oligonucleotides for the amplification of the new
species. Some of these primers were designed using information of conserved genomic regions between D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster (Berkley Drosophila Genome
Project, Release 4; [57]). Although the length of the amplified genomic regions varied among species, they always
included the coding region of the two genes. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit
(QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA), and cycle sequenced using
primers separated at intervals of ~400 nucleotides. Occasionally, a genome walking strategy was also required to
complete the DNA sequence [58]. Sequenced fragments
were separated on the ABI 377 and 3700 sequencers. For

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/323

all species, the DNA sequence corresponding to the coding regions was determined on both strands. The new
sequence data have been deposited in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database under accession numbers:
FM210093–FM210110.
Available genomic data sources
We searched for the orthologous (and other homologous)
copies of the OS-E and OS-F genes in other Drosophila species using available genome sequence information: D.
sechellia, D. willistoni, D. virilis, D. mojavensis and D. grimshawi [24]; in other insects with sequenced genomes:
Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Bombyx
mori, Culex pipiens and Tribolium castaneum [59-63]; http:/
/www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/culex_pipiens/
Home.html; and in available sequences from public databases http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The orthologous
relationship was inferred by the TBLASTN reciprocal besthit method with further gene trees and species trees reconciliation. Proteins with an amino acid sequence identity
higher than 21.5% (the average amino acid sequence
identity between OS-E and OS-F and the DmelObp69
protein – the phylogenetically closest OBP in the D. melanogaster genome [9]) were proposed as members of the
Obp83 subfamily. We determined the gene structure features of newly identified genes using information of the
already known Obp genes as a guide. To better characterize
the syntenic region in the new species, we compared using the dot-plot method implemented in zPicture tool
[64]- the Obp83 region (~10 kb) of D. melanogaster with
the orthologous counterpart in the new species. The SIM
local alignment software [24] and the LANLVIEW tool
[65] were used to search for possible OS-E gene vestiges in
the genomic DNA sequence of the Drosophila subgenus
species.
Codon sequence analyses
We used SeqMan version 5.53 (DNASTAR, Inc.) for
assembling the new sampled DNA sequences. DNA
sequences of the coding regions obtained experimentally
plus those retrieved from the public databases were multiple aligned using the MUSCLE software [66], and edited
with MacClade version 3.05 program [67]. We estimated
nucleotide sequence variation by using DnaSP version
4.10 [68], and MEGA version 4 [69] programs. Bayesian
phylogenetic analysis was performed with MrBayes version 3.1.2 [70]; for that we applied the best substitution
model estimated using the Akaike Informative Criterion
implemented in MODELTEST 3.7 [71]. To determine if
the paralogous genes evolve at different substitution rates
we conducted the two-cluster Relative Rate Test (RRT)
implemented in the LINTRE package [72].

We estimated the selective pressures acting on coding
regions applying a phylogenetic-based Maximum Likelihood analysis. Since the new homologous Obp83

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:323

sequences identified in Drosophila and in mosquito are
highly divergent from the OS-E and OS-F genes they
might differ significantly in nucleotide composition or
codon frequencies. This feature might violate some
assumptions of the Markov model of codon substitution,
and therefore, might yield unreliable estimates of the relevant parameters. To minimize this problem, we used a
multiple sequence alignment with information of only
the OS-E and OS-F genes. Given that the alignment of the
signal peptide region was unreliable in most homologous
gene copies we analyze only the mature-protein coding
region. ML estimates of the relevant parameters -as branch
lengths and the ratio of the nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous substitution rates (dS), ω = dN/dS- were obtained
using the codeml program implemented in the PAML
package version 4 [73]. The ω parameter was used as a
measure of the protein selective constraints [74]. These
analyses were conducted under different competing evolutionary hypothesis. We first investigate whether the distribution of selective constraints acting on the OS-E and
OS-F genes fluctuate across lineages; for that, we compared the fit to the data of the "one ratio" model (M0),
which assumes a constant selective pressure across
branches, with the "free ratios" model (FR), where the rate
parameters are estimated independently in each lineage.
We also examined other evolutionary scenarios; i) to
detect putative changes in the functional constraints after
the gene duplication event, we applied a "two clades"
model (M0dup) to the data. Under this model we
assigned -a priori- two different ω ratios, one for each OSE and OS-F clades; ii) to assess for site-specific selection
pressures (including putative positive selected sites) we
used the "site-specific" models (i.e., models that allow
variation in the ω ratio across sites) of [75]; iii) to detect
positively selected sites in specific lineages, we applied the
modified branch-site model A of [76] in two consecutive
tests (test1 and test2 in [77]); the multiple hypothesis testing problem [78] was taking into account using Bonferroni's correction [79]. The likelihood Ratio Test was used
to compare the fit to the data of two nested models,
assuming that twice the log likelihood difference between
the two models (2Δ&#x2113;) follows a χ2 distribution
with a number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of free parameters [80]. To prevent
incorrect parameter estimates caused by local optima, the
codeml program was run multiple times for the same
model, specifying different initial values.
We used the TreeSAAP version 3.2 [81] to determine the
OBP physicochemical properties affected by natural selection. This program compares the distribution of amino
acid changes altering a particular physicochemical property (for a set of 31 different properties), with that
expected assuming that changes modifying this property
are equally likely (i.e., independent of the physicochemi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/323

cal-magnitude change, that is under neutral evolution).
For each property the observed and expected distributions
are compared by a goodness-of-fit test [28]. TreeSAAP also
assign the amino acid substitutions to particular categories in function on their magnitude effect (each property
is divided in 8 categories of equal magnitude, from more
conservative to more radical physicochemical changes),
and determines the statistical deviations from the
expected numbers [29].
Amino acid sequence analyses
Amino acid-based phylogenetic trees were reconstructed
using MrBayes. We used the Diverge 2.0 software to estimate the type I (θλI) and type II (θλII) functional divergence coefficients [26,27] among paralogous proteins.
Type I and type II refers to shifts in the substitution rates
after gene duplication (indicative of changes in functional
constrains), and amino acid replacements completely
fixed between duplicates (resulting in cluster-specific
alterations of amino acid physiochemical properties),
respectively. We used the CAPS program [82] to identify
groups of co-evolving positions at intermolecular level;
the program also allows estimating the correlated variation between amino acid sites after correcting for evolutionary distances and phylogenetic dependences. The
protein secondary structure of the gene products was
inferred using the PredictProtein server [83]. We also predicted the putative Drosophila OBP 3D structure using the
SWISS-MODEL automated modeling server [30]. The
putative ancestral sequence of the Drosophila OS-E and
OS-F proteins (inferred with PAML) was used to search
sequences of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [84] with high
amino acid sequence similarity and resolved 3D structure.
The 3D structure with the highest PSI-BLAST score was
used for the modeling. The Swiss-PdbViewer program version 3.9b2 [85] was used to visualize the 3D structure and
to highlight the relevant amino acid replacements identified in the evolutionary analyses.
