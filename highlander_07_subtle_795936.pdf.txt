Abstract
Background: Community acquired (CA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
increasingly causes disease worldwide. USA300 has emerged as the predominant clone causing
superficial and invasive infections in children and adults in the USA. Epidemiological studies suggest
that USA300 is more virulent than other CA-MRSA. The genetic determinants that render
virulence and dominance to USA300 remain unclear.
Results: We sequenced the genomes of two pediatric USA300 isolates: one CA-MRSA and one
CA-methicillin susceptible (MSSA), isolated at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. DNA
sequencing was performed by Sanger dideoxy whole genome shotgun (WGS) and 454 Life Sciences

pyrosequencing strategies. The sequence of the USA300 MRSA strain was rigorously annotated. In
USA300-MRSA 2658 chromosomal open reading frames were predicted and 3.1 and 27 kilobase
(kb) plasmids were identified. USA300-MSSA contained a 20 kb plasmid with some homology to
the 27 kb plasmid found in USA300-MRSA. Two regions found in US300-MRSA were absent in
USA300-MSSA. One of these carried the arginine deiminase operon that appears to have been
acquired from S. epidermidis. The USA300 sequence was aligned with other sequenced S. aureus
genomes and regions unique to USA300 MRSA were identified.
Conclusion: USA300-MRSA is highly similar to other MRSA strains based on whole genome
alignments and gene content, indicating that the differences in pathogenesis are due to subtle
changes rather than to large-scale acquisition of virulence factor genes. The USA300 Houston
isolate differs from another sequenced USA300 strain isolate, derived from a patient in San
Francisco, in plasmid content and a number of sequence polymorphisms. Such differences will
provide new insights into the evolution of pathogens.

Community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (CA-MRSA) infections are increasing worldwide
[1,2]. Although the emergence is concurrent, genetically
distinct clones have been reported from different continents [3-6]. In the United States, two clones, USA300 and
USA400 have been associated with the majority of CAMRSA infections [7]. However, USA300 is currently being
reported as the predominant cause of both adult and pediatric CA-MRSA infections in many states [8-12]. At Texas
Children's Hospital (TCH) in Houston, Texas, we have
observed a continuous increase of CA-S. aureus infections,
predominantly CA-MRSA, in a prospective surveillance
study initiated in 2001 [13]. Skin and soft tissue infections
(SSTI) represented 94%; 58% of SSTI patients were hospitalized. We have also reported an increased number and
severity of invasive cases, e.g. complicated pneumonia,
osteomyelitis, pyomyositis, myositis and severe sepsis
syndrome associated with the predominance of clone
USA300 [9,14-18]. Similar observations have been
described at other institutions across the United States
[19]. Recent reports suggest that USA300 is more virulent
than other MRSA strains [15,20,21]. USA300 is genetically
related to the nosocomial MRSA strain COL, which
emerged in the 1960s in Europe following the introduction of methicillin. Both of these strains are likely
descendents of a methicillin-susceptible ancestral strain
[22,23].
Approximately 75% of the CA-S. aureus strains at TCH are
MRSA; 95% of these are USA300. In contrast to the homogeneity of CA-MRSA, CA methicillin-susceptible S. aureus
(MSSA) from the same population are more heterogeneous; USA300 represented approximately 25% of these
strains between 2000–2002 [9]. We continue to note a
greater absolute increase in the number of CA-MRSA isolates, being virtually all USA300-MR, compared with CAMSSA among children evaluated at TCH (Figures 1 and 2).

At the time of this writing, the complete genomes of
eleven MRSA and MSSA clinical strains, of both community and hospital origin, plus a bovine S. aureus strain
have been deposited in the GenBank database. Recently,
the genome sequence of a multi-resistant USA300-MR isolate (FPR3757) from an abscess of an HIV-positive intravenous drug user was reported [24]. We present the
sequence of a USA300-MR isolate from an otherwise
healthy pediatric patient (USA300-HOU) and compare it
to the genomes of FPR3757 and a USA300-MS isolate
from TCH. We postulate that comparison of the genomes
of USA300-MR and USA300-MS will provide clues to the
enhanced ability of USA300-HOU-MR to spread and
cause infections among children compared to other S.
aureus clones circulating in Houston.

ophospholipase, a possible S-adenosyl-L-methionine
(SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, an ABC superfamily
ATP binding cassette transporter, a P-ATPase copper transporter, a possible lipoprotein and an integrase. The ABC
transporter proteins had top BLAST hits to nickel, dipeptide or oligopeptide transporters in other species and it
was annotated as an oligopeptide transporter by Diep, et
al. [24]. ClustalW analyses of the individual components
of these transporters indicated a clustering of nickel-specific sequences with those from USA300-HOU-MR (data
not shown). Thus, we believe that this transporter is likely
involved in nickel acquisition. InterProScan, PFP and
PSORTB, SecretomeP2.0 were used to augment the annotation data obtained by BLASTP and CDD. Based on this
analysis, the SCCmec-ACME region encodes four nonclassically secreted proteins and three other extracellular
proteins. The region also encodes a possible endonuclease, possible tRNA ligases, RNA polymerases and a primase. We also identified a number of ORFs that were not
annotated in USA300-FPR3757; these were hypothetical
or conserved hypothetical proteins.

Pathogenicity islands and prophages
More than fifteen different pathogenicity islands have
been identified in the sequenced S. aureus genomes
[25,26]. SaPIs are mobile genetic elements that carry
about half of the known S. aureus toxin or virulence factor

Features of the USA300-HOU-MR genome
The USA300-HOU-MR genome is 2,872,915 bp in length
and was annotated to encode 2658 proteins, 59 tRNAs
(plus one pseudogene), 5 ribosomal RNA operons and 21
non-coding RNAs (Table 1). A circular representation of
the sequenced genome is shown in Figure 3. To identify
DNA regions unique to USA300-HOU-MR, two-way
BLASTN was performed against each of the other complete staphylococcal genomes (Figure 4). USA300-HOUMR carries the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
(SCCmec) type IVa methicillin resistance cassette. In addition to SCCmec IVa, the strain also contains a ca. 31 kb
region of DNA from 57860 to 88845 that is unique only
to USA300-HOU-MR, USA300-FPR3757 and to S. epidermidis ATCC12228 (Additional file 1) [25]. This region
maps immediately downstream of SCCmec and the entire
element (34173 to 88845) is flanked by an IS431mec
transposase gene and a possible transposase gene. The
region downstream of SCCmec carries genes encoding an
arginine deiminase operon, a Crp family transcriptional
regulator, an APC family arginine/ornithine antiporter,
and an arginine repressor. In USA300-FPR3757, this
region is called ACME, for arginine catabolic mobile element [24]. Downstream of the arginine element we also
annotated genes encoding a universal stress protein, a lys-

genes, and while strains contain different combinations of
the islands, no strain appears to carry more than one copy
of each type [27]. USA300-HOU-MR contains six, SaPI5,
SaPIm4, SaPI6Δ, vSaα, vSaβ, and vSaγ. These encode enterotoxins, extotoxins and serine proteases as well as leukotoxin, hemolysin, exfoliatin, and epidermin (Figure 3 and
Table 2). MW2, another community-acquired MRSA isolate contains the same complement of islands, while,
COL, Mu50 and RF122 contain six islands each, though in
different combinations.
USA300-HOU-MR carries two complete prophage
sequences, φSLT-USA300 and φβC-USA300. Prophage
remnants also occur within pathogenicity island SaPI5.
The φSLT-USA300 sequence is 98% identical to the 46139
bp φSLT sequence [28], excepting gaps greater than 500
bp. These gaps represent regions in USA300 encoding a
helicase and virulence-associated protein E, two DNA
polymerases, and two prophage regulatory proteins. The

prophage carries the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes
lukS-PV and lukF-PV. By PHYLIP analysis, the φSLTUSA300 sequence is most similar to the prophages in
MW2 and clinical strain A980470 (phiSLT) [28] (Figure
5a). As observed for φSLT-A980470 and φ-PVL, the φSLTUSA300 attachment site lies within a conserved hypothetical protein gene [28,29]. The second prophage, φβCUSA300, is very similar to β-hemolysin-converting
prophages identified in JH1, JH9, MRSA252, MSSA476,
Mu50, MW2, N315, Newman, and NCTC8325 (Figure
5b). It is most similar to those found in JH1, JH9 and
N315. In USA300, this prophage encodes staphylokinase,
chemotaxis inhibitory protein and staphylococcal complement inhibitor; the order of these genes places it in
immune evasion cluster (IEC) type B [30]. Unlike COL,
USA300-HOU-MR lacks the L54α-like bacteriophage. As a
result, the glycerol ester hydrolase, or geh lipase gene,
which is disrupted in strains carrying the L54α-like
prophage, is intact and presumed to be expressed.

Plasmids
Two plasmids were detected in USA300-HOU-MR (Figure
6a and 6b). The 3.1 kb plasmid, pUSA01-HOU, is identical to plasmid pUSA01 in USA300-FPR3757. It encodes a
replication protein plus several conserved hypothetical
proteins. The second larger plasmid, pUSA300-HOU-MR,
appears to be a mosaic of parts of three plasmids: pN315
from S. aureus N315; pSR1 from S. aureus strain 01A103;
and pSERP from S. epidermidis RP62A. The plasmid carries
two recombinase genes and three IS431 transposase genes
that may have played a role in fusion of the three elements. The replication region appears to be derived from
pNF315B. pUSA300-HOU-MRSA encodes resistance to
beta-lactam, macrolide, aminoglycoside, streptothricin
(nourseothricin) and bacitracin antibiotics, consistent
with the resistance pattern observed for USA300-HOUMR (Table 3), with the exception of nourseothricin. The
streptothricin acetyltransferase and 3',5'-aminoglycoside
transferase genes are adjacent and map between two IS431
transposase genes; long inverted repeats (ca. 700 bp) flank
these genes. The repeats are most similar to the inverted
repeats found in IS257 from S. epidermidis strain SK76
(Genbank SEU40386) though similar repeats are found
on a number of plasmids from both S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Thus, it appears that this region constitutes a
compound transposon that could also be part of a larger
element carrying the bacitracin transporter genes. A ca.
400 nt repeat (which is a subset of the ca 700 bp repeat)
also occurs within the IS431 transpose genes at ca. 12.5
and 21 kb on the map. pUSA300-HOU-MR also encodes

a cadmium transporter CadD and regulator CadX, and at
least three additional predicted transcriptional regulators
including BlaI and BlaR.
Comparison of USA300-HOU-MR and USA300-FPR3757
We identified 14 insertions/deletions (indels) of greater
than four bp between USA300- FPR3757 and USA300HOU-MR (Table 4). The most significant difference
between the two strains is the location of a 13.4 kb insertion. In USA300-FPR3757, this region is inserted at nt
1,630,721 between a biotin carboxylase carrier protein
gene, accB, and the elongation factor P gene efp. In
USA300-HOU-MR, this same 13 kb segment of DNA is
inserted at nt 680,375 within the snoA gene at the beginning of the staphylococcal nuo-like operon, which
encodes an NADH dehydrogenase [31]. The 13 kb segment is also found in COL, at the same location as in
USA300-FPR3757, and in MRSA252 between two bacteriophage protein genes. There is no homology flanking the
insertions sites for this element and there are no obvious
recombination sequences or repeats within the segment.
The first gene in the segment encodes a frameshift of an
ISSA1 transposase. The frameshift occurs in a poly adenine tract so sequence variation through slipped-strand
mispairing is possible. Six of the proteins encoded by the
13 kb segment may be non-classically secreted proteins.
Also encoded are a possible lipoprotein, a peptidoglycan
hydrolase, a cell division protein, a GTP-binding protein,
a replication protein and a possible actin-binding protein.

frameshift is not observed in any of the other sequenced
S. aureus strains. In addition, we identified a frameshift in
the cell wall anchor protein gene (2623054–2626400)
not reported in the annotation of FP3757.
Comparison of the two USA300 sequences revealed 92
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two four
bp. deletions (Additional file 2). We also discovered 53
sequencing errors in the FPR357 sequence. Fifty-five of the
SNPs map within ORFs, while 18 map within intergenic
regions (this is consistent with the fact that 80% of the
genome is coding sequence) and 7 map within rRNA
sequences. Twenty-one of the changes within reading
frames are synonymous, 34 are non-synonymous and 7
caused frameshifts. Two of the SNPs may explain differences in antibiotic susceptibility. One, a T (FPR357) to C
(HOU) change in the gyrA gene causes a leucine to serine
change at amino acid 84. The serine-containing GyrA protein confers resistance to ciprofloxacin (FPR357), while
leucine confers the wild-type, susceptible phenotype
(HOU, Table 2) [32]. A second SNP presumed to be
involved in fluoroquinolone resistance maps within the
topoisomerase IV parC gene. Here, the USA300-HOU-MR
amino acid 80 is the wild-type serine, while USA300FPR3757 has a tyrosine that confers resistance [33]. Three
non-synonymous SNPs occur within the IgG binding protein A. SNPs in intergenic regions could affect gene regulation: a four base deletion at 2,627,226 would place a
SarA binding motif closer to the sarU promoter and could
affect its transcription (Figure 7).

phage. The numbers on the branches indicate the number of
times the sets co-partitioned after 100 iterations.

An insertion of 159 bp in USA300-HOU-MR but not in
USA300-FPR3757 occurs within a staphylococcal conserved hypothetical protein between 1857878 and
1858036. This insertion is a duplication of flanking
sequence and maintains the reading frame of the protein.
Another difference identified is a 47 bp region in USA300FPR3757, within the repeated region of the IgG binding
protein gene; again, these are absent from USA300-HOU.
Additional short deletions in USA300-HOU-MR also
occur within intergenic regions. Also of note is a
frameshift in the gene encoding an AraC family transcriptional regulator in USA300 (742860–745009). This

We compared the USA300 SNPs to all other sequenced S.
aureus strains (Additional file 2). For 39 of the SNPs, the
other strains had the USA300-HOU-MR allele, while in 34
the allele was identical to FPR3757. For the remaining
SNPs, the other strains showed both alleles, with some
being triallelic.
Comparison of USA300-HOU-MR and of USA300-HOUMS
We generated a draft sequence of the methicillin susceptible strain, USA300-HOU-MS, using the 454 Life Sciences
pyrosequencing technology [34]. This strain is susceptible
to all the antibiotics tested except penicillin (Table 1). The
sequences were assembled into 326 contigs with a total
contig length of 2.8 Mb. We observed 32 SNPs between
the HOU-MRSA and MSSA strains (Additional file 1). We
also identified two regions of DNA that are found in
USA300-HOU-MR but not in USA300-HOU-MS. In contrast, we observed only one region in the MS strain not
present in the USA300-HOU-MR strain. This 733 bp contig had a short DNA match (44 bp, 100% identity) to several staphylococcal sequences and a partial protein match
(50% length, 38% identity) to a transport accessory protein. The sequences missing from USA300-HOU-MS

included the SCCmec and ACME regions (34173–88845,
Additional file 2). A second region not found in USA300HOU-MS (680132 to 694219) includes a large number of
staphylococcal conserved hypothetical proteins (Additional file 2). Four of the proteins encoded by this region
may be secreted (two non-classical). Also encoded are a
possible lipoprotein, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, a cell
division protein, ATP- and GTP-binding proteins, a replication protein, a possible secreted actin-binding protein,
a possible ornithine carbamoyltransferase and a possible
histidinol dehydrogenase.

We surveyed other sequenced staphylococcal genomes
using TBLASTX for the presence of ORFs that were homologous to proteins encoded by the regions of USA300HOU-MR that were missing in the MSSA strain. These are
shown in Additional file 2. With the exception of a few
matches in the MW2 genome, the region from 51299 to
62735 seems to encode proteins unique to USA300-MR.
This region also encodes four hypothetical and six conserved hypothetical proteins; several of these, although
present, were not annotated in USA300-FPR3757. As previously discussed, this region may encode several secreted

Comparison with other completely sequenced
staphylococcal genomes
We used Mauve [35] to align the sequences of the seventeen completed sequenced staphylococcal genomes (Figure 8) The alignment revealed that USA300 clusters with
COL, NCTC8325, and Newman strains and that there are
at least four clades of MRSA circulating. This clustering
suggests that not all methicillin resistant S. aureus strains

Because of the rapid and continuing increase of the prevalence of CA USA300 strains at TCH, we initiated the
sequencing of two typical isolates from pediatric patients.
During this time, Diep et al. [24] reported the sequence of
USA300-FPR3757. USA300-HOU-MR revealed significant
differences from USA300-FPR3757. Though USA300FPR3757 was chosen as a highly resistant isolate, USA300HOU-MR, a purely community-acquired strain, harbours
a large plasmid encoding multiple antibiotic and cadmium resistance. The mosaic composition of plasmid
pUSA300-HOU-MR representing three different staphylococcal plasmids points toward significant genetic
exchange between staphylococcal isolates and species.
Among the numerous antibacterial resistance genes found

USA30

USA300-HOU-MS does not carry plasmid pUSA300HOU-MR but it does carry a 21 kb plasmid (pUSA300HOU-MS) that encodes resistance to beta-lactams and to
cadmium (Figure 6c). It also carries genes that are predicted to encode a bacteriocin and its associated immunity protein. The region from 9382 to 13575 on
pUSA300-HOU-MS is nearly identical (95%) to nts 7644
to 11837 of plasmid pN315B. This corresponds to the
region encoding the beta-lactamase gene and its regulators, BlaR and BlaI, and a Tn552 invertase and recombinase. In addition, this same region on pUSA300-HOU-MS
is 96% identical to nts. 7615–13573 on pUS300-HOUMR. Thus, pUSA300-HOU-MS also appears to be mosaic.
We also identified sequences homologous to pUSA01 on
two contigs that were 1212 and 1278 bp in length, respectively. Since pUSA01 has now been sequenced twice, we
did not attempt to complete the pUSA01 sequence in the
MS strain.

proteins. Though the arginine deiminase DNA region is
unique to USA300 and to S. epidermidis ATCC 12228,
genes encoding homologues of the proteins are found
elsewhere in the USA300-HOU-MS genome and in most
of the complete staphylococcal genomes. Proteins weakly
similar (e value > e-10) to the nickel transporter were
found in all staphylococcal genomes but this is likely due
to generalized matches to other ABC transporter subunits.
In contrast, the nickel transporter proteins are most
homologous to proteins encoded by Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The proteins encoded by the region between
680132 and 694219 are also encoded by the genomes of
two nosocomial MRSA strains, COL and MRSA252. These
were not found in the CA isolate MW2.

on the plasmid, the conferred resistance to bacitracin, a
common constituent of topical over-the-counter ointments used to treat or prevent cutaneous infections, is
most intriguing. In contrast to other MR strains, the cadmium resistance genes were found on a plasmid and not
on the chromosome. Genome-wide alignments revealed
that not all MRSA are tightly clustered.
Several indels between USA300-HOU-MR and USA300FPR3757 were identified. The majority of the indels were
within repeat regions or rRNAs, though a 13 kb segment
was located in different regions of the two genomes. In
USA300-FPR3757, the region is inserted between two
genes. In USA300-HOU-MR, the segment interrupts an
operon (snoABCDEFG) that has been implicated in susceptibility to thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein 1 (tPMP-1). Bayer et al. [31] have shown that
interruption of this operon reduces the susceptibility of S.
aureus to tPMP-1 in vitro. Resistance to tPMP-1 may allow
US300-HOU-MR to cause more serious disease by evasion
of platelet-mediated killing in the blood stream. USA300FPR3757 has an additional repeat within the gene encoding the IgG binding protein A, so it is possible that IgG
binding protein is subject to structural variation. We also
identified nine SNPs within this gene. This may suggest
that the IgG binding protein undergoes significant variation, possibly in response to the host.
Two prophage were identified, one carrying the PVL genes
and the other an hemolysin converting phage carrying the
staphylokinase, chemotaxis inhibitory protein and staphylococcal complement inhibitor genes. USA300 lacks a
copy of prophage L54a. The GehD lipase, whose gene contains the prophage attachment site, is likely to play a role
in colonization events. [36].
SNP analysis revealed 47 non-synonymous, non-conserved differences between the strains. Some of these may
affect protein function. Two of these, one in gyrA and one
in parC, are consistent with antibiotic susceptibilities
reported in Table 3. The SNP analysis also revealed a
number of sequencing errors in the FPR3757 sequence.
To further our understanding of the evolution of the
USA300-HOU-MR strain, we created a draft sequence of
an MS isolate from TCH. This revealed two regions of the
MR strain not found in the MS strain. It is likely that the
progenitor MS strain acquired these regions (along with
the SCCmecIVa and the arginine deiminase region) by
recombination to become USA300-HOU-MR. We propose that USA300-HOU-MS first acquired the arginine
deiminase region plus the cassette chromosome recombinase genes (ccrAB) from a strain similar to S. epidermidis
ATCC12228. This is based on the observation that the
ccrAB genes in USA300-HOU-MR are 95–100% identical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/99

to those found near the arginine deiminase region in S.
epidermidis ATCC12228. The SCCmec was likely acquired
in a separate event from another MRSA, or from a MR-S.
epidermidis strain, via ccrAB recombination within the
repeats flanking the arginine deiminase region [24].
US300-HOU-MS lacks a probable nickel ABC transporter
that is linked to ACME in USA300-MR. It is possible that
increased intracellular stores of nickel in USA300-HOUMR could contribute to virulence by enhancing the activity of the nickel-dependent urease. [37]. The MS strain
also lacks a copy of the P-ATPase copper transporter gene;
such transporters have been shown to be involved in virulence in Listeria monocytogenes [38]. Another potential
virulence factor revealed by comparison of the MR and MS
strains is a possible secreted actin binding protein.
We used a relatively new predictive tool, SecretomeP2.0,
to identify non-classically secreted proteins [39] since it is
not possible to predict the function of most of these proteins by BLAST analysis. We found 406 high scoring genes
predicted to encode non-classically secreted proteins in
USA300-HOU-MR (Additional file 3). If some of these are
indeed secreted then they may be candidate virulence factors for future study.

Conclusion
Comparative analyses have revealed that USA300-MRSA
is highly similar to some MRSA strains suggesting that the
differences in pathogenesis are due to subtle changes
rather than to large-scale acquisition of virulence factor
genes. Significantly, however, is the difference in plasmid
content and antibiotic susceptibility profiles between the
two USA300 isolates. The presence of a large multidrug
resistance plasmid in a community-acquired isolate is
unexpected. The combination of Sanger sequencing and
454 data allowed us to economically derive the complete
sequence of USA300-HOU-MR and MS. Future sequencing of additional USA300 isolates will further characterize
the genotypic variation in this clone. With exception of
the antibiotic susceptibility profiles, the phenotypic
results of the genotypic variation have yet to be discovered.

Methods
USA300 isolates
Clinical isolate TCH1516 (USA300-HOU-MR) was
obtained from an adolescent patient with severe sepsis
syndrome [15]. The strain was representative of the predominant Sma I pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
pattern (Figure 2) observed in our clonal studies on CAMRSA at TCH [9] and is indistinguishable from the CDC
type strain USA300.0114 obtained from the Network on
Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [40]. The
strain is sequence type 8 (ST8). Clinical isolate TCH959
(USA300-HOU-MS) was obtained from a 12 year old

white female with a buttock abscess. The PFGE profile of
the MSSA strain differed from USA300.0114 by two fragments. USA300-HOU-MS lacked a fragment of ca. 230 kb,
which is present in the USA300-HOU-MR and the MS pattern included a 180 kb fragment absent in MR. Additionally, the ca. 300 kb fragment was slightly larger in the MS
strain. FPR3757 was kindly provided by Francois Perdreau-Remington (University of California, San Francisco).
Antimicrobial susceptibilities
Antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained by microbroth dilution assays using Clinical Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) guidelines [41] (Table 3). Unlike the
other sequenced USA300 isolate [24], USA300-HOU is
susceptible to clindamycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and
mupirocin.
DNA sequencing and genome assembly
Genomic DNA was purified from CsCl gradients [42] and
DNA sequencing was performed by Sanger dideoxy whole
genome shotgun (WGS) and by the 454 Life Sciences
pyrosequencing strategies [34]. Genomic and plasmid
DNA from USA300-HOU-MR was sheared to a size of 2
kb by nebulization, and cloned into a derivative of pUC18
[43]. The clones were used for WGS DNA sequencing to
8× coverage by using dye terminator chemistry, data were
collected on ABI 3730 sequencers, and reads were assembled using the ATLAS assembler [44]. This sequence was
supplemented with contigs assembled from shorter reads
generated on a 454 Life Sciences GS20 sequencer to 15×
coverage. This combined assembly was refined by
sequencing PCR products to fill in gaps and to resolve
ambiguous regions. DNA from USA300-HOU-MS was
sequenced by the 454 method to 17× coverage and the
sequences assembled using the 454 Newbler assembler.
The complete sequences have been deposited at DDBJ/
EMBL/GenBank under the following the accession numbers: CP000730 (USA300-HOU-MR); CP000731
(pUSA300-HOU-MR); CP000732 (pUSA300-HOU-MS).
The USA300-HOU-MS has been deposited under the
project accession AASB00000000. The version described
in this manuscript is the first version, AASB01000000.

Glimmer [45] and GeneMark [46] were used independently to predict open reading frames (ORFs). Predicted
proteins were compared to the nr database using BLASTP.
Visualization of gene predictions was performed using the
Genboree system [47] and the CONAN database [48].
Two individuals independently annotated each ORF and
annotations were reconciled and converted to single
entries within the database. Proteins lacking a homolog in
the nr database were called hypothetical proteins, those
with a homolog of no known function were called conserved hypothetical proteins and of these, if homologs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/99

were only in other staphylococci they were called staphylococcal conserved hypothetical proteins.
Sequence analysis
DNA comparisons were performed with BLASTN and
BLASTZ. Protein sequences were analyzed by BLASTP and
BLASTX and by the use of the predictive tools InterProScan [49], PFP [50], PSORTb [51], Helix-Turn-Helix Predictor [52], MEROPs [53], and the Tcdb Transport
Classification database [54]. Non-classically secreted proteins (those lacking signal peptides) were predicted using
SecretomeP2.0 [39]. Riboswitches and non-coding small
RNAs were identified using BLASTN, the Riboswitch
finder [55] and Riboswitch Explorer [56]. ClustalW [57]
and Mauve [35] were used for multiple sequence alignments and PHLYIP bootstrapping and tree generation
(evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html). Single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between USA300MRSA-HOU and FPR3757 were verified by resequencing.
