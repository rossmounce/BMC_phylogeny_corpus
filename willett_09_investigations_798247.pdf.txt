Abstract
Background: The intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus is a model for studying the process of
genetic divergence in allopatry and for probing the nature of genetic changes that lead to
reproductive isolation. Although previous studies have revealed a pattern of remarkably high levels
of genetic divergence between the populations of this species at several spatial scales, it is not clear
what types of historical processes are responsible. Particularly lacking are data that can yield
insights into population history from the finest scales of geographic resolution.
Results: Sequence variation in both cytochrome b (CYTB, mtDNA) and the rieske iron-sulfur
protein (RISP, nuclear) are examined at a fine scale within four different regions for populations of
T. californicus. High levels of genetic divergence are seen for both genes at the broader scale, and
genetic subdivision is apparent at nearly all scales in these populations for these two genes. Patterns
of polymorphism and divergence in both CYTB and RISP suggest that selection may be leading to
non-neutral evolution of these genes in several cases but a pervasive pattern of neither selection
nor coadaptation is seen for these markers.
Conclusion: The use of sequence data at a fine-scale of resolution in this species has provided
novel insights into the processes that have resulted in the accumulation of genetic divergence
among populations. This divergence is likely to result from an interplay between a limited dispersal
ability for this copepod and the temporal instability of copepod habitat. Both shorter-term
processes such as the extinction/recolonization dynamics of copepod pools and longer-term
processes such as geological uplift of coastline and sea level changes appear to have impacted the
patterns of differentiation. Some patterns of sequence variation are consistent with selection acting
upon the loci used in this study; however, it appears that most phylogeographic patterns are the
result of history and not selection on these genes in this species.

Background
Genetically divergent populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus have become an important
model system for studying how populations diverge in
allopatry and how this genetic divergence can lead to the

accumulation of reproductive isolation between populations [1-7]. Important questions still remain to be
answered in this species concerning the nature of the historical processes that have led to the dramatic levels of
genetic divergence between populations. Studies of variaPage 1 of 20

tion in DNA sequences can be a powerful tool for intraspecific phylogeography and can help reveal historical
patterns of population differentiation but have not yet
been applied to the finest scales of resolution in this species, the scale over which gene flow is likely to be occurring [2,3,5,8,9]. An examination of this type of data may
help reveal the nature of the interplay between gene flow,
geography, geological processes, and extinction that contribute to genetic divergence in this system.
Despite the apparent ephemeral nature of their habitat
(high intertidal rock pools that individually dry up on a
regular basis), data from T. californicus populations show
convincing evidence of long-term persistence within an
outcrop and limited gene flow between rocky outcrops
that results in the accumulation of substantial genetic differentiation between these populations [2]. Over the
range of this copepod species from southern Alaska to
central Baja California, Mexico, nucleotide sequences can
show high levels of genetic divergence between regions on
the scale of 100 km apart or less, which in mtDNAencoded genes can exceed twenty percent [3,5,10,11].
Studies of allozyme variation [12,13] and transplant
experiments [9] reveal that between rocky outcrops,
within a region, there is also little gene flow. In fact,
longer-term monitoring of differences in allozyme frequencies between outcrops (some as close as 500 m apart)
reveal that differences remained stable for at least 18
years, potentially more than 100 copepod generations [2].
However, over time local population extinctions are
likely, due to the ephemeral nature of copepod habitat
[14,15] and long distance gene flow must occur occasionally as evidenced by the recolonization of previously glaciated regions [5]. Most of this previous work primarily
utilized allozyme markers at the finest scales of geographic resolution with the result that patterns of DNA
sequence variation have not yet been studied at the geographic scale necessary to yield insights into the longerterm historical processes of extinction and recolonization.
The high levels of mtDNA divergence between populations of T. californicus reflect large numbers of differences
in both synonymous and non-synonymous (or amino
acid changing) sites. For example in the cytochrome b
gene (CYTB, 1128 bp) between two California populations (Santa Cruz, SCN and Abalone Cove, AB) there are
197 synonymous differences and 28 amino acid changes
[10]. These high levels of divergence are likely to reflect
both long periods of isolation between populations and
high mutation rates. Willett and Burton [10] showed that
mtDNA is evolving at a much more rapid rate than
nuclear genes in this species, between 26 and 38-fold
higher at synonymous sites. Although higher rates of
mtDNA than nuclear DNA evolution are found in other
taxa, especially vertebrates [16], the ratio of mtDNA to
nuclear DNA rates of evolution in Tigriopus appears to be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/139

high when compared with other invertebrates and arthropods [10,17,18]. There is some evidence for positive selection acting upon a limited number of sites in one mtDNA
gene in T. californicus, cytochrome oxidase subunit 2, COII
[11], but in general the rapid accumulation of synonymous differences between these populations weakens the
power of these rate-based tests of selection to detect selection on amino acid substitutions.
Despite the limited evidence to date for selection on
mtDNA in T. californicus from patterns of sequence divergence there are reasons to believe that evolution of
mtDNA in this species has resulted in the functional divergence of mtDNA-encoded proteins between populations.
A number of experiments in T. californicus examining
hybrid fitness and enzymatic rates have suggested that a
portion of the genetic variation between populations
leads to divergence in intergenomic coadaptation [6].
MtDNA-encoded proteins in the electron transport system
are part of large, multi-subunit proteins and interact
directly with many nuclear-encoded proteins so that intimate co-evolution between these proteins is likely to
occur. Studies in T. californicus have shown that the interactions between mtDNA-encoded and nuclear-encoded
proteins in the electron transport system have resulted in
divergence in genomic coadaptation and include examples of the loss of functional coadaptation as measured by
examining electron transport system enzyme and gene
activities [19-22], impaired mitochondrial function [21],
and lowered hybrid copepod fitness [21,23-28]. It is not
clear if this coadaptation between mtDNA-encoded and
nuclear-encoded proteins of the ETS has lead to consistent
selection acting upon mtDNA and if this selection on
mtDNA could alter phylogeographic patterns.
In this study we will characterize nucleotide sequence variation in CYTB (a mtDNA-encoded protein of complex III
of the electron transport system) to study fine-scale phylogeography in T. californicus and the potential impacts of
non-neutral evolution upon its diversification among
these copepod populations. In addition, variation in a
nuclear-encoded protein of complex III of the electron
transport system, the rieske iron-sulfur protein (RISP) will
be studied for use as a nuclear-encoded marker for phylogeographic inferences. A unique aspect of this study is that
although there have been a number of studies in T. californicus examining fine-scale population structure (within
and between adjacent outcrops) using allozymes and
broader-scale studies (involving geographically distant
populations) using both allozymes and mtDNA/nuclear
gene sequences, there are few data available for sequence
evolution and differentiation at the finer population
scale. These sequence comparisons will have the added
advantage of bringing a historical perspective to studies of
population subdivision and molecular evolution. We will
center these fine-scale studies of genetic differentiation on

four different geographic regions (each of which has most
likely evolved independently of the other regions for significant periods of time) to determine the extent to which
patterns of divergence are repeated across regions.

Methods
Population sampling
To investigate genetic divergence in mtDNA and population history among closely spaced Tigriopus californicus
populations, copepods were collected from high intertidal
rock pools spaced along 3–16 km stretches of coastline
centered at four rocky outcrops in California that have
been used extensively in previous studies of T. californicus:
San Diego (SD) on Point Loma and La Jolla Point (LJP)
both in San Diego County, Abalone Cove (AB) on the
Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, and Santa
Cruz (SCN) in central California. Sampling at each of
these four outcrops (and surrounding regions) was primarily done in one of two months, November 2002 and
August 2004. For each sampling site, copepods were combined from several pools from within a single outcrop
into a single sample and individuals were randomly
selected from this sample for genetic analyses. Previous
studies using transplanted individuals have indicated that
pools located on the same rocky outcrop will tend to
become genetically homogenized over periods as short as
months [9]. Between two and ten other sites from disjunct
outcrops were sampled from the vicinity of each of the
four focal sites within each region (Figure 1 and Additional file 1, Table S1). In general all accessible outcrops
with copepod pools immediately adjacent to the focal
sites were sampled and then outcrops were sampled at
increasing distances away. The sampling on Point Loma
was not as extensive as for the other three regions, only
two other outcrops to the south of the SD population
were sampled.

Additional samples were taken from locations outside of
these regions (we will call them "additional sites") to
serve as potential outgroups for intra-region comparisons
and to help clarify the relationships of regions to one
another (Figure 1). With the combination of focal region
sites and additional sites, the sampled populations in
southern California (Los Angeles and south) include most
of the major areas containing T. californicus for this region.
Near Santa Cruz, the additional site at Pescardero (PES)
was sampled for this study, a sampling that is not an
exhaustive set of the T. californicus sites around central
California. Several other geographically distant sites in
California and British Columbia, Canada were also
included in phylogenetic analyses for CYTB.
Sequencing Cytochrome b and RISP
Complete CYTB sequences were obtained from individual
copepods from each of the sites (listed in Figure 1) to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/139

compare the extent of population divergence within and
between sites and regions. Soon after collection, DNA
from individual copepods was prepared using a simple
proteinase-K cell-lysis method [23]. The complete CYTB
gene was PCR amplified from these individuals using
either a conserved set of primers or unique primer sets
developed for the SD, AB, and SCN regions (see Additional file 2, Table S2) that amplified a product of
between 1300 to 1800 bp in size depending on the primer
sets used. PCR products were directly sequenced using
Big-Dye Terminator and run on a capillary sequencing
machine. Direct sequencing of the complete CYTB (1131
bp) was performed for 10 or more individuals from most
sites (see Table 1 for numbers); generally only two individuals were sequenced for CYTB from each of the additional sites.
For a nuclear gene comparison to CYTB, the RISP gene was
sequenced from copepods from a subset of the above
sites. This gene includes an 883 to 1113 bp intron that
provides extensive variation between individuals and
sites. Primers to amplify nearly the complete coding
sequence for this gene were previously developed ([10]
and see Additional file 2, Table S2). PCR amplifications
were done using PfuUltra Hotstart High-Fidelity DNA
Polymerase from (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). The
resultant RISP PCR products were cloned using a zero
blunt TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For
most individuals, both direct sequencing of the PCR products and sequencing of cloned sequences were done to
both identify the heterozygous sites and the haplotype
phases. Sequences of RISP of 1585, 1753, and 1838 bp
(size differences result from variation in intron size) were
obtained from Palos Verdes, La Jolla, and Santa Cruz
region copepods respectively from at least 4 individuals
from each site. Two haplotype sequences were constructed
for each individual for RISP, in a few cases these haplotypes were identical for individuals that were homozygotes. RISP and CYTB sequences have been submitted to
GenBank with the accession numbers GQ140634–
GQ141051 and are also included in the additional files
(see Additional files 3 and 4).
Sequence Analysis and Population Structure
Sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencher version 4.7 (Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI). The program
DNAsp version 4.1 [29] was used to examine levels of polymorphism, divergence, and compute statistical metrics
of selection (e.g. Tajima's D [30], Fu and Li's D and F
[31]), compute R, the recombination parameter [32], and
Rm, the minimum number of recombination events [33]
for the CYTB and RISP sequences. Fay and Wu's H [34]
was calculated for each site using the closest available outgroup (PES for Santa Cruz, Dume for Palos Verdes, and
LagBch for Point Loma and La Jolla). The significance of

H was tested by running coalescent simulations in DNAsp
using up to 10 000 replicates with no recombination for
CYTB and several different parameter values of moderate
recombination for RISP. McDonald and Kreitman tests
(MK test [35]) were performed using divergence and polymorphism data from DNAsp and hand counts. The program Arlequin v3.11 [36] was used to compute analyses of
molecular variance (AMOVA) to partition variation
between sites, regions, and individuals, and to calculate
pairwise FST values between sites based on genetic diver-

gence and their significance (using 10 000 permutation
replicates) for CYTB and RISP. Isolation by distance testing was performed using the IBD web service version 3.02
with the significance assessed using a Mantel test [37].
Nested clade analysis was implemented using the program GeoDis version 2.2 [38] for the CYTB dataset using
the inference key of Templeton [39]. Multilocus nested
clade analysis was not attempted for the combined RISP/
CYTB datasets due to extensive recombination within
regions for RISP.

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using several different methods: Haplotype networks were constructed for
CYTB by hand using a parsimony method and also using
statistical parsimony via the program TCS v1.18 [40].
Gene trees for the CYTB sequences were constructed under
the parsimony criterion using the program PAUP* version
4.0b10 [41]. A Bayesian tree was also constructed for the
same set of CYTB sequences using the program MrBayes
v3.1.2 [42]. For this analysis, a GTR model with gammadistributed rate variation and a proportion of invariant
sites was run for 800 000 generations with a 200 000 generation burn-in time (sampled every 1000 generations).
Alternate models from GTR were not explored with Bayesian analyses. Gene trees for RISP were done with PAUP*
using a neighbor-joining analysis (NJ). A full parsimony
analysis of all sequences could not be completed for RISP
in a single analysis most likely due to a history of recombination between alleles within regions. Analyses for each
region with subsets of sequences from all other major
clades could be completed in separate analyses using parsimony and the correspondence between the relationships found in these parsimony analyses and those found
in the NJ tree was then determined.

Results
CYTB variation within and between regions
Phylogenetic analyses of CYTB sequences reveal deep
splits among the four different focal regions, with considerably less variation occurring among sites within each
region (Figure 2). Pairwise divergences among regions are
between 19 and 22 percent (see Additional file 5, Table
S3; with the exception of individuals from the Point Loma
and La Jolla sites that have 10.2% average divergence and
are only 8 km apart). Although the Palos Verdes region is
the closest geographically to each of the CAT, Dume, and
LagBch sites, it is highly diverged from each at CYTB. In
contrast, comparisons of select other geographically distant sites show much lower genetic divergence-LagBch

and Point Loma sites (2.3% divergence, 107 km apart),
PES and Santa Cruz sites (1.0% divergence, 47 km apart),
and Dume and Cat sites (3.1% divergence, 68 km apart).
Within each of the four focal regions, pairwise divergences
among individuals from different sites are much lower
(below 1.3%), and levels of polymorphism within individual sites are relatively low as well (below 0.7%) (Table
1). An analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) shows
that although most variation at CYTB is partitioned
between regions, there is also significant variation
between sites within regions as well (Table 2a).
There is significant genetic structure in each region evident
at scales down to the site to site comparisons but also
some difference in the degree of haplotype sharing across
each region. The Santa Cruz region shows the greatest
degree of CYTB haplotype sharing across sites with three
common haplotypes (Figure 3) that are shared by at least
three different sites. Individuals from geographically separated sites share haplotypes (e.g. CCR1/2 and SCN share
haplotype I, and NB1/2 and LH share haplotype III),
which results in no significant correlation between genetic
distance (FST) and geographic distance within this region
(r = 0.092, p = 0.25) despite general pairwise FST values
among sites higher than 0.5 (all CYTB FST values in Additional file 6, Table S4). However, there are two groups of
Santa Cruz sites that do not show significant pairwise FST
values for comparisons of sites within each group (significance assessed by permutation tests and significance
threshold adjusted using a sequential Bonferroni procedure to adjust for multiple tests). One group is the SCN/
SC3/CCR1 sites that share haplotype I (SC3 is also not significantly differentiated from the SC2 and SC5 sites),
while a second group, the NB1/NB2/SCN4/BH/LH sites,
share haplotype III.
The two San Diego county regions show different patterns
in their CYTB haplotypes than the Santa Cruz region. The

both (a) and (c) the levels tested are the regions, sites, and individuals. In (b) the Palos Verdes region is considered because for this region it is
possible to define subregional grouping based on habitat and sampling schemes [adjacent groups were defined as follows: (AB, AB2, AB3, ABR),
(RP1, RP2), and (FR1, FR2). AMOVA were conducted in Arlequin using pairwise distances between populations.
2The Point Loma region contained only the SD site for the RISP results and was therefore not included as a separate group.

Gene tree for CYTB for selected sites of T. californicus. Tree is one of 16 most parsimonious trees based on the complete nucleotide sequence of CYTB (1131 bp) for taxa representing the range of diversity found within each of the regional
areas and the additional site sequences. Bootstrap numbers based upon 10 000 replicates are given above branches (only those
supporting regional clades and branches showing the relationships of additional sites are shown). T. japonicus nucleotide CYTB
sequences from both Korea and Japan are used to root tree (from GenBank accession numbers AY959338 and AB060648
respectively). The relationships between the regions and additional sites are the same as those obtained in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Credibility values from this analysis are given below each branch.

La Jolla region displays an intermediate level of haplotype
sharing (Figure 4a) with one common haplotype (haplotype IV) shared by five different sites, but clear geographic
clustering for three other groups of closely related haplotypes. In contrast to the Santa Cruz haplotypes where several non-synonymous differences are located on internal
branches, in the La Jolla region non-synonymous differences are largely found at or near tips and not on the
branches separating the four main groups of haplotypes.
Although there is less haplotype sharing within this region
than the Santa Cruz region, there is no signature of isolation by distance (r = -0.045, p = 0.62). Only one group of
sites showed non-significant differentiation in pairwise
comparisons of FST, the LJS/NAUT/LJP3/SIO sites, all of
which have haplotype IV at high frequency. FST values are
much higher (>0.5) for comparisons among all other sites
within La Jolla. Although not sampled as extensively, the
nearby Point Loma region does not show any shared haplotypes among its three sites, but there is also no discrete
clustering of haplotypes by site either (Figure 4b). The FST
values between these three sites on Point Loma range
from 0.49–0.63.
The Palos Verdes region shows the greatest intra-region
divergences for CYTB haplotypes with little haplotype
sharing beyond adjacent sites (Figure 5). There are four
clusters of haplotypes, which each contain adjacent sites
and a fifth cluster of haplotypes that contains the geographically separated PVL/RsPt/FR2 sites (the FR2 site has
individuals in two different haplotype clusters). Two of
the 24 substitutions separating these five divergent haplotype clusters are non-synonymous. AMOVA for the Palos
Verdes region (Table 2b) shows that a large fraction of the
genetic variation was between non-adjacent groups and
contributes to a strong signal of isolation by distance (r =
0.57 p < 0.0001). Two groups of adjacent sites do not
show significant differentiation by FST measures, the AB/
AB2/AB3, and RP1/RP2 sites. All other FST values for pairwise comparisons among sites were higher than 0.3.
There is no evidence for major short-term temporal shifts
in haplotypes within sites from the replicate sampling of
individual sites at different time points. CYTB sequences
obtained from copepods collected two years apart from
the SCN, AB2, and LJP sites were not appreciably different
from one another within a site (results not shown). This
suggestion of short-term stability mirrors the longer-term
stability in haplotype frequency (18 years or more) found
for many of these same outcrops using allozyme markers
[12].
Nested clade analyses for CYTB
Nested clade analyses using CYTB within each of the four
studied regions show patterns of differentiation that are
consistent with inferences of restricted gene flow and fragmentation (Table 3). A number of clade levels appear to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/139

show the signature of past long distance colonization,
fragmentation, or past contiguous range expansion (seven
total) indicating the importance of historical events on
current population structure. For an equal number of
cases (seven), the patterns of variation are consistent with
either historical separation or lowered levels of gene flow
(e.g., isolation by distance or restricted gene flow).
Tests for Selection acting upon CYTB
MK tests [35] reveal a pattern of variation consistent with
excess non-synonymous polymorphism for 3 of the 4
regions (Table 4). For variation in CYTB in T. californicus
Tajima's D values are biased towards negative values, 22
negative (5 significant) and 6 positive (1 significant)
(Table 1). Fu and Li's F and D have a similar pattern of
skew towards negative values (see Additional file 7, Table
S5). If the frequency spectra of replacement sites alone are
examined, Tajima's D values become slightly more negative for the Palos Verdes and La Jolla regions as a whole
(the same pattern was not found overall across individuals sites; see Additional file 7, Table S5). Fay and Wu's H
values [34] are significantly negative for the same five sites
as Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H is also significant at the
RsPt, IP, and FR1 sites (Table 1).
Variation for RISP within and among Regions
We have sequenced RISP from copepods from a subset of
the regions and sites that capture much of the diversity of
haplotypes found for CYTB. A NJ tree constructed from
the RISP sequences illustrates the general patterns of
divergence (Figure 6). There is substantial divergence
among regions, but absolute levels of sequence divergence
between regions for RISP are not nearly as high as those
seen for CYTB. For example, for synonymous site comparisons between the Palos Verdes region and Santa Cruz
region uncorrected pairwise divergence is 70 percent for
CYTB and 5.5 percent for RISP. For the RISP gene tree (Figure 6) within each region there is much less clustering of
haplotypes for single sites or groups of sites than was seen
for CYTB (Figure 2).

With the exception of the Santa Cruz region there is very
little haplotype sharing either within a site or between
sites for RISP, but individual polymorphisms are often
shared across sites within a region. Compared to CYTB,
for RISP there is somewhat less genetic divergence
between sites within a region as reflected by the lower percentage of variation among sites within a region in an
AMOVA for RISP (Table 2c) and the limited geographic
structure within regions evident in the NJ tree (Figure 6).
For the two sites in the Santa Cruz region there are only 7
singleton polymorphisms segregating at RISP (and the
two sites are not significantly genetically differentiated at
RISP; all RISP pairwise FST values are in Additional file 8,
Table S6). In contrast, for the 4 alleles obtained for the
additional site to the north, PES, there is much more varPage 9 of 20

iation, including an allele (m9-B) that appears to be a past
recombinant between PES and Santa Cruz allele-types
(see Additional file 9, Table S7). In the La Jolla region, 19
of 22 non-singleton polymorphisms are shared across
sites (see Additional file 10, Table S8). The FST values indicate significant but relatively low levels of differentiation
between these three La Jolla sites (with LJS and LJP having
the lowest FST value: 0.064 despite having an FST of 0.74
for CYTB). The Palos Verdes region sites show the least
shared polymorphism with only 9 of 21 non-singletons
shared across sites (see Additional file 11, Table S9). Compared to the other two regions, pairwise differentiation is
highest among Palos Verdes sites as measured by FST values, which range from 0.28 and 0.36 for IP/RP1 and IP/
PVL to 0.75 for RP1/AB.
Patterns of Polymorphism in RISP
All of the polymorphisms within regions for RISP are
either in non-coding positions (primarily the large intron)
or in synonymous sites in the coding regions (Table 5). As

expected from the lack of haplotype variation, the Santa
Cruz sites show the lowest levels of nucleotide polymorphism with the average πtot-sil 10-fold lower than the corresponding value from the La Jolla sites. Estimates of
intragenic recombination from both the recombination
parameter (R) and minimum number of recombination
events (Rm) are both non-zero in the Palos Verdes and La
Jolla samples indicating a history of recombination in
these samples of alleles within regions. The lack of variation within the Santa Cruz region precludes an estimation
of recombination rate within that region.
The frequency-spectra of polymorphisms for RISP in these
different sites and regions of T. californicus are not as
biased towards low frequency polymorphisms as seen for
CYTB (Table 5). For Tajima's D there are 6 positive values
and 3 negative with no significant values. The only significant values for Fu and Li's D and F are from the PVL site
and are positive (1.56 D and 1.64 F, p < 0.05 for each; see
Additional file 7, Table S5). Significantly negative values

complete a parsimony analysis for the entire dataset but could complete analyses for pruned datasets to examine relationships
between regions. Secondarily, the relationships of haplotypes within each region were separately analyzed using a parsimony
method and compared to the relationships obtained from the NJ analysis. Intragenic recombination and reticulation of
sequences within regions could make parsimony analyses difficult by yielding numerous equally parsimonious trees.

Discussion
Signals of population structure and history at a broad scale
Although striking, the patterns of extreme genetic divergence observed among regional populations of T. californicus are not unprecedented, with high levels of mtDNA
divergence found among populations in previous studies
[3,5,10,11]. The high levels of genetic differentiation
between T. californicus populations are likely to reflect generally low levels of gene flow between outcrops and their
ability to persist on outcrops despite the ephemeral nature
of individual copepod pools within a single outcrop during
the course of a season [14,15]. In some cases genetic divergence is across short distances, for example there is 10 percent divergence in CYTB between the Point Loma and La
Jolla regions despite the distance between these regions
being equivalent to the distance between the end sites in
the La Jolla region (~9 km). At a slightly larger scale, the
LagBch and Palos Verdes regions are 20 percent divergent
and 53 km apart. Such patterns of high divergence in
mtDNA genes have also been found in a congener, T. japonicus, with up to 28 percent divergence between populations
in CYTB among locations in Japan and Korea [43].

Often the presence of highly genetically divergent lineages
within a nominal species is thought to reflect the presence
of cryptic species. Although defining cryptic species in

allopatric populations is a difficult problem, a number of
factors suggest that T. californicus may be still considered a
single biological species (although they could potentially
be considered separate species under other species definitions): These populations are able to interbreed in the lab
and produce hybrids, including advanced generation
hybrid lineages [24,44], there is no evidence for premating isolation in crosses between populations [45,46], and
little consistent morphological divergence among populations has been found in studies done to date [12,47].
Other groups of copepods have also been found to have
divergent genetic lineages that are often morphologically
similar suggesting morphological stasis may be common
in copepods [48-50]. In contrast to Tigriopus, in a number
of other cases, genetically divergent lineages within a
nominal species are sometimes found sympatrically distributed suggesting that these lineages do represent cryptic
species [51-56]. Not all copepod species show these dramatic patterns of genetic differentiation between populations with some species having world-wide distributions
and apparent genetic exchange between ocean basins
[54,57].
Even though many comparisons of geographically distant
populations of T. californicus show high levels of divergence, not all comparisons show this pattern, suggesting
that occasionally gene flow can reach over longer spatial
scales in this species. For example in the current dataset,
LagBch and Point Loma are 2.3 percent divergent and 98
km apart, Dume and CAT are 3.0 percent divergent and 68

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:139

km apart, and Santa Cruz and PES are 1.0 percent divergent and 47 km apart. In some cases these population
comparisons are not the most geographically proximate,
for example LagBch is much closer geographically to the
other populations in the Palos Verdes region (34 km)
rather than Point Loma populations (107 km). Edmands
[5] found that from Oregon north to Alaska there was very
little divergence in COI sequences among T. californicus
populations and suggested that this could reflect recolonization after the last ice age. These seemingly contradictory
patterns of low divergence in spite of extensive geographic
separation between select populations of T. californicus
within California may be indications of past long distance
colonization events; thus, implying that although rare,
long distance dispersal also plays a role in the evolutionary history of this species.
The degree of temporal stability of the outcrops and pools
that comprise copepod habitat may play a large role in
extinction/recolonization dynamics in T. californicus.
Over short time scales, factors such as the number, size,
and location of pools are likely to determine whether
copepod habitat persists on an outcrop from year to year.
At much longer timescales, sea level changes due to water
storage in ice sheets during periods of glaciation will have
major impacts on the distribution of available intertidal
habitat. In fact, over the past 500 000 years (500 kyr) sea
levels have cycled repeatedly with sea levels in interglacial
periods at or slightly above current levels and 100–150 m
below current sea levels at glacial maxima. During the past
100 kyr sea levels declined unevenly down to at least 100
m below the present sea level at the glacial maximum
about 21 kyr [58] and then increased rapidly until about
8 kyr when they reached their present levels (with potentially slightly higher levels in the mid-Holocene [59]). The
distribution of available T. californicus habitat in the past
would have been rather different from the present distribution with the current pool areas only inhabitable for at
most 8 kyr. Recolonization of newly available outcrops
would likely involve rare long-distance dispersal events
from other outcrops. It is possible that some geographically disjunct areas with low levels of CYTB sequence
divergence seen in the current dataset (e.g. Laguna Beach/
Point Loma and Catalina Island/Pt. Dume) could reflect
the lack of available habitat in one region during the last
glacial maximum followed by dispersal from other distant
refugial populations once suitable habitat became available again.
In addition to the shifting availability of copepod habitat
associated with sea level changes, the outcrops themselves
are not stable over the longer time periods that would be
required with standard mtDNA molecular clocks to produce the CYTB divergences uncovered among T. californicus populations. The uplifted headlands containing the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/139

rocky-intertidal regions in this study from Southern California do not appear to be more than one million years (1
myr) old. The Point Loma and La Jolla headlands resulted
from uplift associated with the Rose Canyon fault leading
to the emergence of these areas first as offshore islands less
than one myr ago [60,61]. Similarly, the Palos Verdes
region was at one point submerged and uplift resulted in
its emergence as an island, also less than 1 myr ago, which
was eventually connected to the mainland by the emergence of the Los Angeles basin [62]. Prior to that, it
appears likely that both the San Diego and Los Angeles
areas were extensively estuarine in nature until roughly 2–
3 myr ago [63] and may not have supported much Tigriopus habitat. Interestingly, for several other coastal marine
or intertidal animal taxa the Los Angeles region is the site
of intra-specific phylogeographic breaks [64]. Given the
relatively young age of the current rocky headlands in
southern California, it is possible that the divergence in
CYTB between copepods from nearly adjacent regions
such as Point Loma and La Jolla (~10 percent) or even
Point Loma and Palos Verdes (~20 percent) has accumulated over a period of less than 1 myr if this divergence is
not due to colonization from previously isolated source
populations. With divergence times of 1 myr or less, these
genetic divergences would reflect substantially elevated
mutation rates for these copepod lineages (i.e. >10 percent/myr). The observation that mtDNA genes evolve
much more rapidly than nuclear genes in T. californicus
[10], could also support elevated absolute mtDNA rates in
this taxon. However, given that long distance dispersal
events seem to occur occasionally in this species, it is also
possible that dispersal from genetically divergent source
populations (perhaps populations now extinct) could
explain the high levels of genetic divergence between
these populations.
Signals of population structure and history at a fine scale
This study differs from previous datasets from T. californicus by determining the patterns of divergence in DNA
sequence at a fine geographic scale (here for both a
nuclear and a mtDNA gene). Although mtDNA sequence
divergences in CYTB are much more modest within
regions (<1.3 percent), there is significant genetic structure between the majority of sites in all four regions as
revealed by FST distances and AMOVA (Table 2). The
nested clade analyses support both historical separation
and separation with limited gene flow between many
clades within regions (Table 3); however, the reliability of
individual inferences generated from nested clade analyses has been questioned [65]. We have done exploratory
analyses using likelihood-based IM analyses on selected T.
californicus sites under a model of isolation with gene flow
using a MCMC method [66] and these analyses revealed
both strong signals of limited gene flow between some
sites and much higher gene flow between other sites con-

Page 15 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:139

sistent with results obtained from FST and nested clade
analyses (results not shown). Taken together, the FST analyses, AMOVA, nested clade analyses, and limited IM analyses suggest significant historical separation and limited
contemporary gene flow among a large fraction of these
sites within each region.
An advantage of using CYTB over nuclear genes is that a
mtDNA gene tree can yield insights into population history that may be lost due to recombination in nuclear
gene trees. In each of the four regions the CYTB haplotype
networks suggest slightly different patterns of historical
isolation. The Palos Verdes region shows haplotype
groupings that are largely geographically limited (Figure
5), the major exception to this is the FR2 haplotype that is
closely related to the PVL haplotypes (and may be an
example of fairly recent long-distance dispersal). These
results suggest isolation resulting from geographic separation is dominant in shaping genetic diversity in this region
and may reflect substantial isolation between these
groups of sites since perhaps the last glacial maximum 21
kya or the return to present sea levels about 8 kya. The La
Jolla CYTB haplotype network (Figure 4) suggests that
there may have been significant historical isolation
between at least three outcrop areas with only limited
gene flow. For La Jolla, however, there are also several geographically separated sites (SIO, Naut, LJP3, and LJS) that
show little evidence of isolation, a pattern that must
reflect either on-going gene flow or recent colonization.
Of the four sites, the LJS outcrop currently has the most
extensive copepod habitat and could serve as a source for
recolonization of the other sites after extinctions. Note
that the SIO and LJS sites are not adjacent (LJP1/LJP2 sites
are closer to SIO) suggesting that migration does not
always occur in a stepwise fashion. For the Santa Cruz and
Point Loma regions, although there is evidence for limited
gene flow from FST measures, CYTB haplotypes are either
shared across many sites (Santa Cruz, Figure 3) or nested
amongst one another (Point Loma, Figure 4). This pattern
would seem most likely to reflect limited gene flow over
short time scales but more mixing over longer periods,
perhaps through occasional extinction and recolonization
events of single outcrops.
There are substantial differences in the patterns of
sequence divergence found between CYTB and RISP, with
much greater levels of divergence among sites within a
region for CYTB than for RISP. This lack of divergence is
not due to a lack of variation in RISP, for the La Jolla and
Palos Verdes regions, both average and total levels of polymorphism across sites within a region are similar for
RISP and CYTB (Tables 1 and 4). In both of these regions
phylogenetically distinct clusters of haplotypes from a
limited number of sites are found for CYTB, while very
few differences are fixed between sites within a region for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/139

RISP. This difference between the two loci in amount of
genetic differentiation suggests that the mtDNA-encoded
CYTB is behaving as if it has a lower effective population
size. If males and females have the same average reproductive success, then mtDNA would be expected to have
roughly a fourth the effective population size of a nuclearencoded gene given its clonal, female-limited inheritance.
In some cases the differences between the two markers are
extreme (for example the LJP1/LJS comparison shows
almost no structure at RISP, while LJP1 haplotypes form a
distinct clade for CYTB, Figures 4 and 6). Geographicallylimited selective sweeps occurring anywhere on the linked
mtDNA molecule are one possible explanation for a pattern of greater differentiation of mtDNA if the sweep
causes polymorphic sites to become fixed within an outcrop for CYTB but does not affect RISP.
Signals of non-neutral evolution
Given the evidence outlined in the introduction for the
accumulation of functional and fitness differences in
mtDNA among populations of T. californicus it is instructive to look at the patterns of sequence variation to determine if signatures of non-neutral evolution can be found
and if there is any evidence for coupled selection in both
CYTB and RISP. For CYTB in the La Jolla and Santa Cruz
regions, MK tests suggest an excess of replacement polymorphism, which could be attributable to segregating
slightly deleterious mutations. The negative values for Fu
and Li's D and F and Tajima's D tests indicate excess lowfrequency mutations in many of the sites as well, which
could indicate some combination of a recovery from a
recent selective sweep, expanding populations, or slightly
deleterious mutations retained at a low frequency but
unable to increase in frequency. Up to 20 of 29 non-synonymous polymorphisms within the three regions are
found on terminal branches suggesting recent origin and
many of these (10 of the 20) are singletons, indicating low
frequency. It then appears that some fraction of the nonsynonymous polymorphism is likely to consist of slightly
deleterious mutations that remain at low frequency and
are generally quickly lost from populations. Polymorphism in mtDNA often shows an excess of slightly deleterious mutation in comparisons of polymorphism within
and divergence within and between species [67]. These
rare deleterious mutations are unlikely to impact inferences about population structure and historical relationships; however, they may impact the frequency spectrum
of polymorphisms and produce excess low frequency variation that could otherwise suggest the hypothesis of a
population expansion. Slightly deleterious mutations in
mtDNA could also contribute to intergenomic coadaptation if they occasionally go to fixation (perhaps due to
lowered effective population size during a population
bottleneck) and then the fitness effects are subsequently
compensated by changes in nuclear-encoded proteins of

Page 16 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:139

the electron transport system as suggested by the compensatory co-adaptation model [68].
Some of the non-synonymous polymorphisms within
regions do not fit into the pattern of rare slightly deleterious mutation, for example, in the Santa Cruz region there
are three non-synonymous substitutions of nine total substitutions occurring on the branches between the three
most common haplotypes (Figure 2). A comparison of the
divergence amongst these three haplotypes to the divergence to the Bodega Head outgroup in a variant of a MK
test (6:3 vs. 149:6 synonymous: non-synonymous polymorphism vs. synonymous: non-synonymous fixed; χ2
test, p = 0.03) suggests that non-synonymous changes are
in excess amongst the three Santa Cruz haplotypes. These
polymorphisms are shared across sites at moderate frequencies which suggests that they are not deleterious
mutations. Given the excess replacement variation seen
on these internal branches compared to fixation to an outgroup, it is even possible that selection could be acting to
maintain some non-synonymous variation at CYTB in
this region.
Selective sweeps occurring on mtDNA can lower its apparent effective population size further and could contribute
to faster fixation of unique haplotypes within species or
populations. A few sites show significantly negative values
for Fu and Li's F and D, Tajima's D tests, and significant
Fay and Wu H tests for CYTB that could indicate recent
recovery from a selective sweep and could imply that
selection has periodically driven advantageous mutations
to near fixation (note that these mutations do not have to
be in CYTB but could occur anywhere in the mtDNA).
However, there are also demographic scenarios that could
generate significant values for these tests; for example, significant Fay and Wu's H test values could potentially
result from low levels of migration that introduce ancestral alleles back into a population at low frequencies.
More extensive sampling of nuclear genes from these populations would be required to determine if a demographic
scenario that affects all genes to some degree is likely to
explain some of the deviations in allele frequencies found
at CYTB for this handful of sites.
The RISP protein interacts structurally with CYTB in complex III and functionally as well through its iron-sulfur
redox center, which is involved in the transfer of electrons
in this complex [69]. Given this close association, evolution in the CYTB protein may be accompanied by coadaptation in RISP. The amino acid sequence of RISP is very
well conserved across sites and regions in this dataset, in
fact, the only polymorphic or fixed amino acid differences
uncovered between sites and regions were the two amino
acid differences between regions found previously for the
sites AB, SCN, and SD by Willett and Burton [10]. Clearly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/139

a large amount of amino acid substitution can occur in
CYTB with few changes in RISP amino acid sequence.
Within regions we find amino acid changes in CYTB
among some high frequency haplotypes (5 total in the
Palos Verdes and Santa Cruz regions) and between certain
regions (there are 6 amino acid differences in CYTB
between La Jolla and Point Loma) with no changes in the
RISP protein. These results indicate that structural co-evolution between these two proteins is not occurring within
a region or between relatively closely related regions.
These results do not rule out the possibility of CYTB coadaptation with other subunits of complex III (there are
eight other nuclear-encoded subunits in this complex in
most eukaryotes). At a broader scale, between the AB and
SD sites, patterns of genetic interactions between RISP and
two other complex III-associated genes (CYC and CYC1)
suggest that there has been co-evolution between these
three nuclear-encoded proteins, but the results also suggested that these interactions potentially did not involve
CYTB for those two sites [27].
At the nucleotide sequence level for RISP there is some
evidence for non-neutral patterns in allele frequencies in
particular with the Fay and Wu's H test (for the BR, LJP,
and SD sites). A potential explanation for this pattern is
that these sites could have undergone a selective sweep in
the region near RISP in the genome but demographic
effects could provide an alternate explanation. One other
unusual pattern for RISP is the extremely low level of polymorphism found in the SCN site (Table 4). This is unusual for this site as RISP has the lowest levels of silent/
non-coding polymorphism of the 11 genes examined to
date for the SCN site [10,70]. In an HKA test [71] of polymorphism in these 11 genes at this site compared with
divergence to the AB site, the RISP polymorphism is 4-fold
lower than expected and contributes to significantly heterogeneous patterns of variation at this site between these
11 genes (results not shown). This could be explained by
a selective sweep having occurred near RISP in copepods
from the Santa Cruz region removing variation in this
gene. Overall, for both the RISP and CYTB genes the analyses of selection and deviations from neutrality indicate
that although selection could occasionally impact patterns of variation at these genes in some populations,
most of the phylogeographic patterns seen in this dataset
are not likely to be the result of selection.

Conclusion
Given the dramatic patterns of genetic differentiation
within and between regions for T. californicus, it is clear
that gene flow between these sites is limited over short to
moderate time spans. It appears likely that both the
shorter-term processes of occasional extinction of all
pools on single outcrops and subsequent recolonization,
and the longer-term processes such as geological uplift

Page 17 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:139

and repeated cycles of sea level change with past episodes
of glaciation have combined to shape patterns of genetic
divergence in this species. If outcrop to outcrop dispersal
is limited (as appears likely), the frequency with which all
pools on an outcrop go extinct simultaneously on a single
outcrop will determine the degree to which an outcrop
can diverge from neighboring outcrops. Over longer periods of time, changes in sea levels during cycles of glaciation will radically alter the available intertidal habitat and
limit the degree of divergence among outcrops within a
region. Among regions the upper limit on the accumulation of genetic divergence appears to be generated by
slower acting geological forces such as the uplift of coastline that has generated rocky intertidal areas in southern
California over the last million years. However, even these
lengths of divergence time between regions are unlikely to
explain the high levels of divergence in CYTB, and it is
possible that there is an unusually high rate of mtDNA
substitution in this species if these divergences are not due
to colonization of these regions by previously isolated
source populations.
A lack of gene flow among outcrops and potentially an
elevated mtDNA substitution rate will not explain all of
the patterns seen in the data; extinction events followed
by long distance recolonization are also likely to play a
significant role. The presence of shared haplotypes among
multiple outcrops (not exclusively adjacent) is consistent
with long-range colonization within regions. Geographically distant populations that show low levels of genetic
divergence (some of which are more divergent from more
proximate regions) suggest that past long-distance dispersal events occurred between these populations. These patterns set up a bit of a conundrum for this species with
evidence for some long-distance dispersal suggesting the
potential for gene flow but little gene flow over significant
periods of time for comparisons of many nearby sites.
One possibility is that long-distance dispersal is a very rare
phenomenon and makes little contribution to genetically
homogenizing disparate outcrops. It may also be possible
that there is a priority effect such that the occasional
migrant copepod rarely survives to reproduce upon reaching an inhabited outcrop but may survive and reproduce
in uninhabited or sparsely inhabited pools.
Although selection does not appear to dramatically alter
phylogeographic patterns at these genes, there are some
signs from the data that it could be more subtly impacting
the patterns of nucleotide variation in these copepod populations. Non-neutral patterns seen in this dataset are
consistent with excess slightly deleterious polymorphism
within regions and potential selective sweeps for a few
sites. It is possible that these slightly deleterious polymorphisms could occasionally go to fixation during population bottlenecks and then contribute to a compensatory

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/139

coevolution process between mtDNA and nuclearencoded proteins. Suggestions of selective sweeps from
some sites come from frequency-based tests (Fu and Li's D
and F, Tajima's D, and Fay and Wu's H), but for these tests
it would be helpful to consider multiple genes to rule out
potential demographic effects such as population expansion or contraction. Spatially-limited selective sweeps in
mtDNA could potentially contribute to the greater divergence in CYTB than RISP between some sites. It is possible
then that selection upon mtDNA could accentuate genetic
divergence between select geographic sites or shift patterns of polymorphism within sites in this system, but it
does not appear likely that this selection is radically altering the patterns of genetic variation within and between
populations. Therefore, despite accumulating evidence of
coadaptation between the nuclear- and mtDNA-encoded
proteins of the electron transport system in this species,
overall phylogeographic patterns in CYTB and RISP
appear to be largely a product of history and not selection.
