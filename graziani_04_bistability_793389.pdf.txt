Abstract
Background: Bistability and hysteresis are increasingly recognized as major properties of
regulatory networks governing numerous biological phenomena, such as differentiation and cell
cycle progression. The full scope of the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to bistability and
hysteresis remains elusive. Nectria haemaotcocca, a saprophytic or pathogenic fungus with sexual
reproduction, exhibits a bistable morphological modification characterized by a reduced growth
rate and an intense pigmentation. Bistability is triggered by the presence or absence of σ, a
cytoplasmic determinant. This determinant spreads in an infectious manner in the hyphae of the
growing margin, insuring hysteresis of the differentiation.
Results: Seven mutants specifically affected in the generation of σ were selected through two
different screening strategies. The s1 and s2 mutations completely abolish the generation of σ and
of its morphological expression, the Secteur. The remaining five mutations promote its constitutive
generation, which determines an intense pigmentation but not growth alteration. The seven
mutations map at the same locus, Ses (for 'Secteur-specific'). The s2 mutant was obtained by an
insertional mutagenesis strategy, which permitted the cloning of the Ses locus. Sequence and
transcription analysis reveals that Ses is composed of two closely linked genes, SesA, mutated in the
s1 and s2 mutant strains, and SesB, mutated in the s* mutant strains. SesB shares sequence similarity
with animal and fungal putative proteins, with potential esterase/lipase/thioesterase activity,
whereas SesA is similar to proteins of unknown function present only in the filamentous fungi
Fusarium graminearum and Podospora anserina.
Conclusions: The cloning of Ses provides evidence that a system encoded by two linked genes
directs a bistable and hysteretic switch in a eukaryote. Atypical regulatory relations between the
two proteins may account for the hysteresis of Secteur differentiation.

Background
Although it has long been known that cellular memory, or
epigenetic states, can be created by emergent properties of
regulatory or metabolic networks (see Delbrück in the dis-

cussion of [1], and [2,3]), the full implications of this type
of inheritance have only recently been understood. To
date, pertinent studies focused mainly on phenomena
related to chromatin structure and DNA methylation,

RNAi and other post-transcriptional gene silencing processes, and prions. However, virtually any physiological
process can adopt a bistable (or multistable) behavior, as
defined by the ability to adopt two (or more) stable states
rather than a range of intermediate states, provided that a
positive feedback loop exists (or its related counterpart,
the mutually inhibitory double negative feedback loop)
within the system [1,3,4]. The bistability may sometimes
be associated with hysteresis, i.e., the ability of the system
to maintain, in a sustained manner, a particular state
despite the fact that the stimulus initiating this state is no
longer present or is below the level that initially activated
the system [5,6]. In some cases, the hysteresis is sufficiently dominant to permit faithful transmission of the
different states during mitosis and even meiosis, thus
appearing as an epigenetic phenomenon [4,7].
In the light of these concepts, alternative inheritable regulatory states were designated (reviewed in [8]) based on
previous descriptions of regulatory or metabolic networks, permitting the definition of new types of inheritance units, the 'toggle switch' and the 'positive feedback
switch'. More recently, mathematical models defined the
conditions in which a system endowed with positive
autoregulation can present bistability [9,10]. However,
most studies on bistable regulatory states are presently
performed with a few well-known systems [7,8], including the lactose operon, the lambda lysogenic/lytic decision switch, and the Xenopus mos MAP kinase cascade.
Other relevant models are necessary for the comprehension of these phenomena.
Fungi are an excellent source of well-defined bistable and
multistable processes associated with hysteresis (reviewed
in [4,11]; see also [12]). In yeasts, such phenomena are
quite common and are called phenotypic switches [11,13]
or prions [14]. In filamentous fungi, bistable phenomena
seem to be particularly prevalent, as one-third of the species show at least one example of these [4]. In most cases
investigated in filamentous fungi, bistability results from
the appearance and subsequent spread of cytoplasmic and
infectious factors. Apart from the HET-s and the Crippled
Growth determinants of Podospora anserina, their molecular nature and their roles remain unknown. HET-s is a
prion [15] and the Crippled Growth determinant seems to
result from a positive autoregulation of a signal transduction cascade [16]. The widespread recognition of these
infectious factors in fungi is probably due to the ease with
which they are detected. The syncytial structure of the
mycelium facilitates the propagation of factors from cell
to cell. Usually, the presence of the infectious element
results in a modification of thallic characteristics, such as
fertility or morphology, and is thus easily scored visually
as sectors in which the mycelium displays different
properties.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/2/18

In the filamentous ascomycete Nectria haematoccoca, two
bistable phenomena have been described [17]. N. haematoccoca is the teleomorph of Fusarium solani, a fungus
encountered throughout the world as both saprophyte
and pathogen. N. haematoccoca produces naphthoquinones exhibiting biological activities. Production of
naphthoquinones is regulated by genetic and environmental but also epigenetic factors. The thallus of this species, observed just after ascospore germination, is a dense,
grayish aerial mycelium, called Normal. Two kinds of
morphological modification (the Anneau and the Secteur) frequently and randomly appear in the growth margin of the thallus as small brown areas in which hyphal
elongation is reduced and secretion of pigments is drastically increased (see Figure 1A for the development of the
Secteur). Once initiated, the modifications spread and
progressively invade the margin of the culture, with a
speed that dictates their form (20 times the hyphal elongation speed for the Anneau and twice for the Secteur).
The new growth forms can be perpetuated with large
pieces of mycelium excised from the growing margin of
affected mycelia. The resulting modified subcultures,
called ZiS (from a Secteur) and ZiA (from an Anneau),
grow slowly and are pigmented in brown. However, fragmentation of a modified culture permits the restoration of
the Normal morphology in a variable proportion of subcultures [18], showing that ZiS and ZiA cultures are probably mosaics of infected and uninfected hyphae. Each
modification can be specifically transmitted to Normal
cultures by contamination experiments, as shown in Figure 1C for Secteurs. The tangential propagation of the new
growth forms is thus due to the transmission through
hyphal fusion (anastomoses) of specific infectious cytoplasmic determinants, called σ for the Secteur and α for
the Anneau.
Mutagenesis experiments of wild-type conidiospores
demonstrated that both the Secteur and the Anneau are
under the control of nuclear genes [19]. In these early
mutageneses, several kinds of mutation were detected.
Five mutations prevent the expression of both the Secteur
and Anneau, either spontaneously or after inoculation.
They differed from wild type in producing more aerial
mycelium, lacking pigmentation, and suppressing the sexual stage through self-fertilization. They mapped to at
least four loci. Since this type of mutation prevents the
generation of both infectious factors, they are now designated nas mutants (for 'no Anneau or Secteur').
Several mutations that specifically prevent the formation
of Anneaux were also selected [19]. The two different
types of mutations recovered, a and a*, suggested that the
Anneau is under the control of a unique but complex
locus. All a and a* mutations map to the same locus, Ans
(for 'Anneau-specific'). Mutants carrying the a mutations

are unable to generate the α factor, since they never
present Anneau morphology and cannot be infected by
that factor. Mutants carrying the a* mutations never show
Anneaux, spontaneously or after contamination, but display a red color. Surprisingly, when used as donor in contamination with the wild type as recipient, these mutants
are able to trigger Anneaux in 100% of attempts, showing
that these a* mutants carry the α factor constitutively. It is
noteworthy that the phenotype of a* mutants suggests

that the mere presence of this factor is sufficient to promote a red color but is insufficient to alter growth.
To date, only one mutation that specifically prevents Secteur formation has been described [18,19]. This s*789 (formerly 789) mutant acts similarly to a* mutation in that it
entails a red pigmentation (Figure 1B) and specifically
prevents the expression of the Secteur, although it possesses the σ determinant throughout the thallus. This

property is shown in Figure 1C, by the ability of small
inocula harvested in the red s* thallus to induce Secteurs
on growing recipient mycelia lacking the σ determinant.
Because of the similar properties of Anneaux and Secteurs,
we decided to screen for more mutations that specifically
prevent Secteur formation, to determine if s mutations
(i.e., a mutation that specifically prevents the generation
of σ) could be obtained. To this end, we developed novel
mutagenesis procedures permitting the recovery of mutations that specifically prevent Secteur development. Most
were nas mutations. However, a few s* alleles and two s
alleles (s1 and s2) were obtained. Genetic analysis suggested that the σ factor, like the α factor, is under the specific control of a single complex genetic locus. Molecular
analysis of the s2 allele, obtained by insertional mutagenesis, permitted the cloning and characterization of the Ses
locus. As expected from the genetic data, the locus is complex and encompasses two linked genes, one of which has
similarity with putative esterase/lipase/thioesterase
enzymes. These data provide evidence that two linked
genes could generate a bistable differentiation.

Results
Selection and genetic characterization of mutants affected
in the expression of the Secteur phenomenon
To increase the number of mutants affected in Secteur
expression, we decided to use a strategy based on the
recovery of fast-growing sectors after mutagenesis of the
slow-growing ZiS cultures (see Methods; Figure 2). We
recovered 354 independent mutants (Table 1), with a
large majority of nas mutants (97%). Eleven mutants were
specifically affected in Secteur expression. Ten exhibited
an s* phenotype identical to that of the s*789 strain. One
mutant, s1, had a wild-type phenotype, except that it was
unable to express the Secteur, spontaneously or after contamination tests (Figure 1D).
Genetic analysis of the mutants defines a complex locus
involved in Secteur expression
The s1 mutant and five s* mutants were initially crossed
with the I4mod reference strain. All behaved as single
mutants, with about 50% wild type and 50% mutant type
in the progeny (data not shown). In some progeny, the s*
and s1 mutations were recombined with the I4mod markers. These strains were kept for further crosses. Crossing s1
with s*789 or crossing the new s* mutants with s1 and with
s*789 yielded progeny that were mostly segregants, with
the parental phenotypes in a ratio 1:1 and few segregants
with the wild-type phenotype. Their frequency ranged
from 0.1 to 0.6% of the progeny (Table 2), indicating that
mutations affecting the Secteur were closely linked. In
order to determine dominance/recessivity relationships of
the mutated and wild-type alleles, forced heterokaryons
were produced by pairing some mutants and wild-type

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/2/18

strains marked with auxotrophic mutations (see Methods;
Table 3). The s1/+, s*789/+, and s*84/+ prototrophic mycelia were grayish and able to differentiate Secteurs, as did
the control heterokaryon, which carried only the auxotrophic markers. Thus, the wild-type allele was dominant
over its mutated counterparts. Combinations of s*
mutants with s1 gave rise to heterokaryotic wild-type mycelia, indicating that complementation occurred. In contrast, no complementation was observed in pairings
involving two different s* alleles.
The simplest interpretation of these results is that s1 and s*
mutations could affect two different linked genes or two
separate domains of a multifunctional protein encoded
by a large gene. However, due to the low representation of
heterokaryotic cells (about 10%) determined in previous
studies [20], one must carefully interpret these data,
deduced from the characteristics of the prototrophic heterokaryotic mycelium.
Insertional mutagenesis identified the Ses locus
Since the s1 mutant allele appears recessive to the wild
type in balanced heterokaryons, we tried to clone the Ses
locus by complementation using the sib selection strategy
[21]. Although two different cosmid banks, XSG and XN
(see Methods), were used, none of the tested transformants exhibited Secteurs. As an alternative strategy, we
therefore used insertional mutagenesis, which can rapidly
lead to the cloning of the relevant gene. Transformation
with a plasmid that carries a hygromycin B resistance
marker was performed to identify new mutants affected in
Ses. However, because the contamination tests necessary
for this screen were labor-intensive and time-consuming,
we preferred the 61a1 strain as a recipient for transformation, since it expressed Secteurs very early, and at high frequency, and never expressed Anneaux [22]. As illustrated
in Figure 3A, the majority of transformants grown for 15
days at 18°C differentiated Secteurs, so that few transformants had to be tested by contamination experiments
for their Secteur expression. During the course of these
experiments, we also screened transformants harboring a
variation in colony morphology or pigmentation (Figure
3B). These phenotypes could be maintained from conidia
isolation, showing that the transformation procedure was
an effective approach in the creation of mutants. Ten
transformants among the 5000 recovered failed to express
the Secteur. Nine exhibited a nas phenotype. One was
probably affected in the Ses locus, as it was unable to differentiate Secteurs, either spontaneously or after contamination tests. This transformant, called s2, had a wild-type
morphology and behaved as did the s1 mutant previously
isolated.

The s2 transformant carries a DNA fragment integrated in
the Ses locus
In order to prove that s2 carries integration in the Ses locus,
we crossed it with the wild-type (wt) and s1 strains. When
crossed with wt, the 100 tested ascospores segregated 1:1
for ability:inability to differentiate Secteurs. As expected,
hygromycin B resistance always cosegregated with the ina-

bility to differentiate Secteurs. When s2 was crossed with
the s1 strain, only seven ascospores among 1657 were unable to express the Secteur (Table 2), indicating that s2 also
mapped at the Ses locus. Overall, the data strongly
suggested that s2 resulted from a single insertion at the Ses
locus.

To establish the integration pattern in s2, Southern blotting analysis was performed after digestion by ClaI, which
did not cut the plasmid, and by BamHI, which cut once in
the vector. The probe was the pAN7-1 vector used for
insertional mutagenesis. As shown in Figure 4A, the
number and intensity of hybridizing bands in ClaI digest
reflected a complex integration event, with at least two
integrated copies. Southern blot analysis of 10 s progeny
from an s2 × wild-type cross did not show segregation of
the two integration sites (data not shown), suggesting that
the two integrated copies were linked. The size of the
larger ClaI-fragment, LI, was compatible with an entire
copy of the vector, whereas the smaller, SI, could be interpreted as a truncated copy. Further analyses with other
restriction enzymes and probes (data not shown) estab-

lished the restriction map of this region (Figure 4B). The
sequence of a region flanking SI revealed that both LI and
SI occurred at the same genomic site and were separated
by a DNA fragment of unknown origin (Figure 4B).
Molecular cloning of the Ses locus
The restriction enzyme BamHI was used to recover the
genomic sequence flanking LI (Flank1 in Figure 4B) along
with part of the integrated pAN7-1 vector. A part of Flank1
was then used as a probe to screen the XN cosmid library.
One hybridizing cosmid, XN31E6, was identified and
used to transform the s*789, s*18, s*27, and s*4 mutants.
Most of the transformants recovered the ability to express
the Secteur, showing that the s* mutations are probably
recessive. However, different phenotypes were observed

Figure 5transformants recovered in transformation experiments using s* mutants with XN31E6 and psecX5
Types of
Types of transformants recovered in transformation experiments using s* mutants with XN31E6 and psecX5.
As the respective proportion of each type of transformant was similar with both vectors, the proportion observed is the combined percentage computed with 60 tested transformants. S, transformants differentiating Secteurs as wild type; mild S, transformants differentiating a Secteur that propagates more slowly than wild type and that frequently reverts to a normal
morphology. S → s*, transformants differentiating the Secteurs but showing an s* phenotype beyond the modified area; s,
transformants unable to differentiate Secteurs.

(Figure 5). The 'mild S' exhibited the Secteur altered in its
propagation and maintenance, and the 'S → s*' showed
an s* phenotype beyond the Secteur. The mild S was interpreted as having a reduced amount of σ in the modified
areas because of insufficient expression of the transgene,
and the S → s* type was probably due to transgene sorting. Indeed, wild-type and s* nuclei could be recovered
through the isolation of microconidia in such transformants, before expression of a Secteur, indicating that the S
→ s* thalli had a heterokaryotic structure. After the development of a Secteur, only the s* cells that were not
affected in their growth in the presence of σ could grow,
as previously observed for balanced heterokaryons [20].
Interestingly, we also observed several transformants displaying an s phenotype (Figure 5). These might have
resulted from an abnormal integration inactivating the Ses
locus. Molecular analysis of five hygromycin-resistant
(HygR) transformants (four with a wild-type phenotype,
and one with a mild-S phenotype) revealed two patterns
of integration (Figure 6). The pattern exhibited by the four
wild-type transformants was wild type, except for an additional band corresponding to the pMoCosX vector. These
transformants were thus interpreted as having integrated
one copy of XN31E6 at the resident Ses locus. The mild-S
transformant pattern was more complex, showing additional bands and a difference in fragment stoichiometry,
suggesting a complex integration. This is consistent with a
reduced amount of σ hypothesized for mild-S
transformants.
It is noteworthy that despite several attempts, transformation experiments done with the s1 mutant as a recipient
did not yield any transformants able to express the Secteur. This suggests that, contrary to the observations in bal-

anced heterokaryons, s1 is dominant in partial diploids.
Dominance of s1 was indeed established through transformation (see below). This dominance in diploids explains
the failure to clone Ses by complementation.
In order to further define the DNA fragment complementing the recessive s* mutation, cosmid XN31E6 was subcloned into pBluescript and the plasmids were assayed for
complementation. This yielded psecX5, a plasmid carrying a 5.5-kb XhoI fragment sufficient to confer Secteur
expression (Figure 7) with the same efficiency as did
XN31E6.
Gene organization of the Ses locus
A 9-kb-long region surrounding the integration site in the
s2 strain was sequenced (GenBank Accession no.
AY572411). One interesting feature of the sequenced
region concerned the presence of several inverted repeats
ranging from 32 to 290 bp and organized in a symmetrical
fashion (Figure 7). Inspection of the sequences revealed
four open reading frames (ORFs) that were either larger
than 200 amino acids or showed significant similarity
with proteins in the databases (Figure 7). To begin with,
we found an ORF encoding a putative large protein of
unknown function that is also detected in the complete
genome sequences available for the other filamentous
ascomycetes (those of Neurospora crassa, Magnaporthe
grisea, F. graminearum, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and P. anserina). This protein, NhHET-E-like, has a
weak similarity (23% identity and 39% similarity over
455 amino acids) to the HET-E protein of P. anserina,
which has been shown to be involved in heterokaryon
incompatibility [23]. On the other side of the insertion
site, a partial ORF of 165 amino acids carrying a PROSITE

(PS00061), short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases family signature, was detected and designated ADHS.
Two additional ORFs, SesA and SesB, were also identified.
Functional analysis revealed that only these two ORFs
were part of Ses, each having a different role.
SesA is a 210-codon ORF (Figure 7) with no homologue
in the genomes of N. crassa, M. grisea, A. nidulans, or A.
fumigatus. However, it is significantly similar (30% identity and 42% similarity) to the N terminus of a large putative protein of P. anserina of unknown function but with
46% identity and 60% similarity with the Het-E protein in
its C terminus (Figure 8A). It is also similar to two ORFs,
of 214 and 201 codons, present in the genome of F.
graminearum, with 41% identity and 54% similarity over
197 amino acids and 32% identity and 49% similarity
over 199 amino acids, respectively (Figure 8A). SesA is
interrupted by pAN7-1 in the s2 transformant, and
sequence analysis of SesA in the s1 mutant showed a mutation at the end of the coding sequence, which changes a

glycine into a glutamic acid (Figures 6, 7, 8A). SesA was
expressed because a 480-bp-long RT-PCR product was
obtained by using the 3' RACE (rapid amplification of
cDNA ends) procedure. The sequence of this product
revealed that a polyadenylation signal existed 141 bp
downstream from the SesA stop codon.
SesB, a 386-codon ORF (Figure 7), is located on the opposite strand from SesA. SesB shows significant similarity
with several putative proteins from filamentous ascomycetes (at least three in A. fumigatus and A. nidulans, six in F.
graminearum, two in N. crassa, and four in M. grisea and P.
anserina) and animals (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
melanogaster, or mammals). It does not show similarity
with hemiascomycetous yeast ORFs (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 12 other partially sequenced yeasts), basidiomycete ORFs (Coprinus cinereus, Ustilago maydis, and
Phanerochaete chrysosporium), or Arabidopsis thaliana ORFs.
All the proteins similar to SesB show a significant

site serine domain. The sequence of SesB in
s1,s*789,s*4,s*27, and s*18 revealed that in the four s*
mutant alleles, SesB contains a single point mutation (Figures 7 and 8B), but no mutation in the s1 mutant. In s*789,
s*18, and s*4, the mutations are missense mutations, and
in s*27, the mutation corresponds to a one-base addition
resulting in a frameshift 120 bp upstream of the stop
codon. None affected highly conserved residues of the
esterase/lipase/thioesterase domain, suggesting that a
functional protein was expressed in the mutants. The
expression of SesB was also investigated with the 3'-RACE
procedure. A 370-bp-long RT-PCR product was obtained,
confirming that SesB is expressed. Sequencing showed
that a polyadenylation signal is used 81 bp downstream
from the SesB stop codon. Downstream of SesB is another
potential short ORF (ORF-C), encoding a putative peptide
of 157 amino acids with no homologue in the databanks.
To show that ORF-C is not an exon of SesB, we cloned into
pBluescript the 2.4-kb-long SmaI fragment carrying only
SesB, i.e., without ORF-C or SesA. This yielded plasmid
psecSm24 (Figure 7). Its transformation in four different
s* mutants showed that the insert restored the expression
of the Secteur. The molecular analysis of transformants
showed that the integration was ectopic (data not shown),
supporting the hypothesis that SesB alone is per se a functional gene involved in Secteur development.
Since homologues of both SesA and SesB are present in the
genomes of F. graminearum and P. anserina, we investigated whether the gene arrangement was conserved in
these two species. In P. anserina, for which a single SesA
homologue is found, the gene arrangement is not conserved, since SesA and SesB homologues are on two different contigs. In F. graminearum, the putative 201-aminoacid homologue of SesA that displays the lowest percentage of identity is not associated with any of the SesB
homologues. On the contrary, the 214-amino-acid homologue of SesA that displays the highest identity is associated with a SesB homologue in the same order (Figure
8C). This homologue is highly conserved between N. haematococca and F. graminearum (79% identity and 85%
similarity over 387 amino acids) whereas the other F.
graminearum homologues are less conserved (40% identity and 63% similarity over 273 amino acids for the nextbest homologue). In F. graminearum, the inverted repeats
1, 2, and 3 are absent but the inverted repeat 4 is present.
Overall, these data suggest an evolutionary conservation
of Ses between N. haematococca and F. graminearum, both
of which are in the genus Fusarium, but with a lack of conservation of the gene organization in more distant species,
including the loss of SesA. There are no data concerning
the potential development of Secteur in the F.
graminearum strain used by the Fungal Genome Initiative
for sequencing.

s1 is dominant in diploids
To investigate the dominance of s1, we co-transformed the
wild-type strain with pSec3-s1 and pBC-Hygro. pSec3-s1
was obtained by cloning into 'pGEM-T easy' (Promega,
Charbonnières, France), a PCR amplification product
constructed with oligonucleotides im317 and ip2393c
(see Figure 7) using the s1 mutant genomic DNA as template. Thus, pSec3-s1 contained the entire Ses locus present
in the s1 mutant strain. Among 17 tested HygR transformants, seven could not differentiate Secteurs. StuI-restricted
DNA from five of these transformants was analyzed by
Southern blotting. Two integration patterns were
observed (Figure 9). For three transformants, the expected
wild-type StuI fragment was absent, suggesting that integration altered the Ses locus, thus accounting for the lack
of Secteur formation. For the two other transformants, the
wild-type StuI fragment was present, as was an additional
band larger than 15 kb. As this band hybridized with
psec3-s1 and the hph hygromycin resistance marker (data
not shown), these transformants could be interpreted as
bearing a co-integration of pBC-Hygro and pSecs1 at an
ectopic position. Sequencing of the Ses locus in these two
transformants that do not display Secteurs confirmed the
presence of both alleles, i.e., the wild-type allele at the resident locus and the mutated allele s1 at an ectopic position. This clearly demonstrated the dominance of the s1
mutation, in contrast to the s* mutations, which are
recessive.

Discussion
Although the Secteur and Anneau phenomena were
described about 30 years ago [17], the molecular mechanisms able to generate these fascinating bistable differentiations are still mysterious. Early studies suggested
peculiar epigenetic mechanisms [24]. In this study, we
have initiated the molecular characterization of Ses, the
primary locus controlling the development of Secteurs.
The impact of mutagenesis procedures
The experimental design, based on the differences in the
growth rate between modified and normal cells, was very
efficient in finding mutations that block the propagation
of Secteurs after the action of both UV and NG (N-methylN'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine). A vast collection of
mutants affected in the Secteur expression was easily
obtained. One mutant with an s phenotype was isolated,
along with 11 s* mutants. Apparently, NG (N-methyl-N'nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine) mutagenesis was more efficient than UV mutagenesis in recovering these specific
mutants (9/105 and 3/250, respectively). Genetic analysis
showed that the structure of the Ses locus mirrors the
structure of the Ans locus, indicating that α and σ could be
generated through similar mechanisms, in agreement
with the fact that both factors require the same set of nas
genes for propagation.

genomic DNAs of wild-type (wt) Nectria haematococca and five s transformants (Tr1-Tr5) that were obtained after co-transformation of wt with psec3-s1 plasmid and pBC-Hygro vector, and probed with psec3-s1. All the transformants share a large band
(>15 kb), absent from wild type. Tr3 and Tr5 contain both the wild type and the s1 allele. The faint bands noted * correspond
to repeated sequences homologous to those present at the Ses locus.

Relationships between s1 and wt alleles: recessivity in
heterokaryons versus dominance in partial diploids
Dominance/recessivity tests using balanced heterokaryons showed that s1/wt heterokaryons were able to
differentiate Secteurs as wild type. The recessivity of s1,
deduced from the heterokaryon tests was the initial point
of our cloning strategy, i.e., the use of cosmid libraries
from wild type to restore the ability to express the Secteur
in an s1 recipient strain. The screening of two representative cosmid libraries failed, and we examined various
hypotheses to explain this failure, especially the possibility of the dominance of s1. In order to easily clone the Ses
locus, we used an insertional mutagenesis strategy, a powerful method for gene isolation in filamentous fungi [25].
With the pAN7-1 vector, 5000 HygR transformants were
screened for defects in mycelium pigmentation, colony
morphology, and the expression of the Secteur and
around 4% of mutant phenotypes were detected. This frequency is similar to the 0.4 to 1.4% reported for loss of
pathogenicity in different fungal species [25]. Among
them, 9 nas mutants and 1 s mutant were obtained. Given

the proportion observed for classical mutagenesis (12 s*
or s mutants among 355 nas), the recovery of the s2 mutant
was an unexpected outcome. Although we may have been
lucky, the recovery of this transformant may reflect a
preference for plasmid integration in the region of the Ses
locus, which is compatible with the high recombination
frequency observed at Ses. Cloning of Ses permitted the
construction by transformation of a partial diploid containing both the wild-type and s1 mutant alleles. The fact
that this partial diploid has a s phenotype indicates that s1
allele is indeed dominant over the wild-type allele in partial diploids. Similar contradictions have been observed
in A. nidulans by comparing diploids and heterokaryons
for complementation between mutations in the regulatory and the cognate structural genes. These data were
interpreted as being due to a limitation of regulatory gene
products to the nucleus or by a stringent dose effect when
combined with a nonrandom distribution of nuclei in
heterokaryons [26,27]. In our study, a dose effect is also
probable. In N. haematococca, as reported earlier [20], only
1–10% of hyphal fragments containing 3–4 cells are

heterokaryotic, the others corresponding to both
homokaryons in similar proportions. In addition, phasecontrast microscopic observation of the prototrophic
mycelia revealed the presence of rows of uninucleate cells
disrupting the heterokaryotic association. This structure
does not prevent the stability of balanced heterokaryons
with regard to metabolic requirements (hence the complementation of the auxotrophic mutations), but might
severely affect the dosage of the SesA products expressed
from the wild-type and s1 nuclei in different portions of
the thallus. Because s1 is dominant and corresponds to a
missense mutation, it is likely that the product expressed
from SesA in s1 is a dominant negative. If its concentration
is insufficient, especially in hyphae homokaryotic for
wild-type SesA nuclei, the propagation of σ and Secteur
formation is favored. In contrast, in diploids an even ratio
of the two products is always achieved, preventing propagation of σ and Secteur formation.
Integrated model of functional elements at the Ses locus
The molecular characterization of Ses shows that it is composed of two linked and expressed genes, SesA and SesB,
both of which are necessary for Secteur expression. Each
has a different role. The s1 and s2 mutants map to SesA.
Because s2 is an integration of a large segment of DNA at
the beginning of SesA, the phenotype of the s2 mutant
probably results from a complete loss of function of SesA.
The s1 mutant carries a dominant missense mutation and
therefore synthesizes the SesA mRNA, and probably a
dominant negative protein. The SesAp protein has no evident homologue in the databanks yielding a clue to its
function. As s2 does not produce the σ determinant, cannot be contaminated by mycelia carrying σ, and never differentiates the Secteur morphology, SesA is probably
necessary for the production and transmission of σ.

All s* mutations map to SesB and determine a red-pigmented phenotype associated with the generation of the σ
determinant throughout the thallus, but without any
growth alteration. It is noteworthy that all the s* mutations are probably not simply preventing the production
of a functional mRNA, but are also not preventing the production of an active protein, as they map outside the evolutionarily conserved region of the protein. The function
of SesB and its homologue remains unknown in fungi;
however the inactivation by RNA interference of the most
similar gene in C. elegans is lethal during embryogenesis,
suggesting that the protein produced by SesB could be
essential (accession NP_510177; [28]). Based on the analysis of the mutant phenotype triggered by s* mutation, the
wild-type SesB product is involved in the repression of
pigmentation and σ generation.
To date, this situation has not been described for any of
the previously reported systems responsible for bistable or

expression in Nectria haematococca. (A) First model: In
the wild-type strain, the product of the SesA and SesB genes
can exist in a normal state (AN and BN) and in a modified
state (AS and BS). AS determines overproduction of pigments
and BS is responsible for growth alteration. (B) Second
model: The product of SesA, SesAp, is responsible for pigmentation. The product of SesB, SesBp, has a catalytic activity
necessary for the normal growth. These two products negatively regulate each other, and the equilibrium constants
favor SesAp. In juvenile thalli, only SesBp is produced, but
SesAp can be randomly produced, switching to a new state
with a majority of SesAp.

multistable switches in fungi. Previous systems implicated
prions [23,29], chromatin silencing [12], hysteresis in a
MAP kinase cascade [16], and possible membrane inheritance [30,31]. At present, it is premature to propose a
molecular model to explain the Secteur, because SesA and
SesB display weak similarity only with proteins of
unknown function. However, from our data we can infer
that SesA most likely encodes a regulatory factor for SesB
and that the regulation probably takes place at the protein
level and probably not at the RNA level, since s1 and all s*
mutation are point mutations that are not likely to affect
RNA transcription and stability. Two formal models could
explain how the regulation might work.
Firstly, the product of SesA (SesAp) could exist in two
states: one, AN, characterizing the Normal morphology
and the other, AS, determining the Secteur morphology
(Figure 10A). The transition AN to AS may be initiated by a

rare event in cells of the growing margin of the thallus.
Once formed, the AS state becomes predominant by
directing other AN molecules to adopt the same state. This
positive feedback loop allows AS propagation from
hyphae to hyphae through anastomoses. AS alone would
induce the hyperproduction of pigments (hence the
absence of both σ and pigmentation in the s mutants, as
they are mutated in SesA). In addition, the product of SesB
(SesBp) can adopt the normal BN state, which can be
transformed into a BS state in the presence of AS. BS would
be responsible for the growth alterations observed in the
Secteur and would follow the propagation of AS (hence
the lack of growth impairment presented in the s*
mutants, as they are mutated in SesB).
In the second model, SesAp may negatively regulate SesBp
but also be negatively regulated by SesBp (Figure 10B). In
the normal mycelium, SesBp, which probably has a catalytic activity, would be active in promoting healthy
growth. The appearance in some cells from the growing
margin of a sufficient amount of SesAp would displace the
equilibrium, resulting in the inhibition of SesBp. In order
for this to happen, the equilibrium constants must be in
favor of SesAp. This would result in growth impairment
(because SesBp would not be present) and in a red pig-

mentation (because SesAp would be present). In the s
mutants, SesAp would never be present, thus making the
presence of SesBp constitutive (hence the absence of
Secteurs and the healthy growth). In the s* mutant, the
interactions between the two proteins would be abolished, permitting the activity of both SesAp and SesBp
(hence the presence of a constitutive σ, the red pigment,
and healthy growth). This model could explain the
dynamic equilibrium found in the ZiS area, as well as the
dose effect for SesAp, explaining the difference of heterokaryons and partial diploids.

Conclusions
Secteur, one of the two bistable and hysteretic differentiations exhibited by the filamentous fungus N.
haematococca, is controlled by a complex, two-gene locus.
Each gene has a distinct role in defining bistability, and
atypical regulatory relations between the two proteins
coded by the two genes may account for the hysteresis of
Secteur differentiation. The data exemplify the diversity of
mechanisms that generate differentiation in fungi, and,
more generally, in eukaryotes.

Methods
Fungal strains and growth conditions
The homothallic N. haematococca strain wt (Centraal
Bureau voor Schimmelcultures, Baarn, The Netherlands)
was used as the standard wild-type strain in this study. The
origin and relevant characteristics of all strains used in this
study are listed in Table 4.

The a1s1I4mod and 61a1 strains used as recipients in transformation experiments were constructed by crossing the
s1I4mod strain with a1 mutant and the 61 mutant with
a1I4mod strain, respectively (unpublished data). The
marker segregation was recorded after three weeks. This
included (1) mycelium and perithecium pigmentation,
(2) fertility, and (3) the ability to express the Secteur and
the Anneau as tested by transferring the progeny onto
potato dextrose agar (PDA) and by inoculating 3-day cultures with s*789 (for Secteurs) and a*58 (for Anneaux).
General culture conditions and manipulations were as
described by Daboussi-Bareyre [20]. Strains were purified
through microconidia and maintained on PDA at 26°C.
Long-term stocks were stored as plugs under mineral oil at
12°C. The medium selective for transgenes was PH8, i.e.,
PDA containing 8 µg/ ml of hygromycin B from SigmaAldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France).
Mating and ascospore recovery
The general methods for crossing the homothallic N. haematococca have been described elsewhere [19,32]. Since
the strains used in this study were homothallic, detection
of hybrid perithecia in crosses were performed using as a
partner in crosses the double mutant strain I4mod. This
strain developed white, self-sterile perithecia whereas
wild-type and fertile mutants developed self-fertile, red
perithecia [32]. Thus, all the white, fertile perithecia,
which appeared on the crossing plates, were hybrid.

The progeny of crosses was analyzed in accordance with
the following procedure: two to nine white, fertile perithecia from each cross were freed from mycelium and
conidia. Each was opened to spread the ascospores on one
Petri dish containing water plus 3% agar. To control viability, 35 ascospores from each perithecium were transferred to PDA and incubated for 4 days at 26°C, while the
water-agar stock dishes were kept at 2°C to prevent
ascospores from germinating. Then, the water-agar dishes
containing many viable ascospores (usually those with
more than 70% of germination were selected) were
returned to 26°C to allow germination overnight. A sample of about 400 germinating ascospores from each dish
was transferred to PDA. The phenotypes were recorded
after a week at 26°C in the dark, except for the
perithecium color, which was evaluated after an additional period of two weeks.

Heterokaryon test
Heterokaryons were constructed as described in [20]. Initially, strains s1, s*84, and s*18 were crossed with the two
strains carrying either of the markers, arg154 and lys255,
that promote auxotrophy for arginine and lysine, respectively. Auxotrophic marked strains, which were recovered
in the progeny, were paired on a cellophane membrane in
the combinations appropriate to restore prototrophy.
After 48 hours of growth on complete medium, the membrane was transferred to minimal medium. Widely inclusive inocula from prototrophic mycelia observed at the
junction of the two partners were transferred to minimal
medium and examined for their pigmentation and their
ability to express the two modifications, either spontaneously or after inoculation.
Standard mutagenesis
Plugs taken from the growing margin of a culture modified by the Secteur were inoculated on cellophane discs on
PDA and grown for 4 days at 26°C. The modified slowgrowing cultures (ZiS) were submitted to mutagenesis by
UV or NG. For UV mutagenesis, cultures were exposed at
450 J/m2, with a UV light source (254 nm), and then kept
in the dark for 72 hours. For NG mutagenesis, 0.1 ml of a
200γ/ml solution of NG was deposited under the cellophane disc. After 1 hour, the treated cultures were exposed
to light for NG degradation.

Fast-growing sectors were clearly visible a week after
mutagenesis. For the estimation of the number of sectors
recovered from each treated thallus, only sectors harboring different phenotypes were considered. A plug of these
independent sectors was inoculated on PDA and the
resulting cultures were examined for pigmentation and
ability to express the Secteur and/or the Anneau at 26°C.
The majority of the recovered mutants corresponded to
nas mutants, defined by (1) the inability to differentiate
both Anneaux and Secteurs, (2) an exuberant white mycelium, and (3) the inability to differentiate perithecia.
Some of these mutants could express the modifications at
other temperatures, as was previously observed for
mutants 727 and 100 [33,34]. s* mutants were recovered
as red, fast-growing sectors. They displayed the same
properties as the s*789 mutant described previously [19],
i.e., red thallus and inability to express the Secteur
spontaneously or after inoculation. A unique s mutant
was selected as a wild-type-growing sector. This mutant
displayed a wild-type phenotype, except for the inability
to express the Secteur spontaneously or after inoculation.
Both s* and s mutants could differentiate Anneaux.
Insertional mutagenesis
Plasmids pAN7-1 (GenBank accession number Z32698)
or pBC-Hygro [35], which had no sequence similarity
with the N. haematococca genome, were used to transform

the double mutant strain 61a1. Both vectors carried a
hygromycin resistance gene. Transformation occurred at a
frequency of about 10 transformants/µg plasmid. Southern analysis on 10 independent hygromycin-resistant
transformants (HygR) indicated that the transforming
DNA inserted generally at one or two genomic sites, in
some cases in a tandem fashion (data not shown). This
pattern of integration was suitable for recovery of tagged
genes.
To screen for mutant phenotypes, 5000 HygR independent
transformants were transferred to PH8 (12 per Petri dish)
and grown for 15 days at 18°C, a temperature that
increased the frequency of spontaneous Secteur formation. Thalli with mutant phenotypes were frequently
recovered (Figure 3). These most likely resulted from the
plasmid integrations, since a sample of regenerating protoplasts treated in the same way but without the transforming DNA did not show any phenotypic variation. As
control, a sample of transformants with an altered morphology was purified through single conidial isolation.
Data showed that the mutant phenotype was stable.
Potential candidates affected in the expression of the
Secteur were recovered as thalli that did not form
spontaneous Secteurs. Inoculation experiments were used
to confirm the mutant phenotypes.
Transformation procedure
Protoplasts were prepared as described in [36], with the
following modifications. Petri dishes containing 25 ml of
a solid PDA medium covered with a cellophane disk were
inoculated with 5×106 spores and incubated for 20 hours
at 26°C. Mycelia were collected (0.2 g/10 ml) in a lysis
buffer (1.2 M MgSO4, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.8,
10 mg/ml Glucanex (Novozymes, Bagsvaerd, Denmark),
10 mg/ml mutanase (Interspex Products, San Mateo, CA,
USA), and incubated for 2–3 hours at 26°C with gentle
agitation. Protoplasts were separated from cell debris by
addition of 5 ml of ST buffer (0.8 M Sorbitol, 100 mM
Tris-HCl pH = 7.5) and centrifugation at 2000 g for 10
min. The protoplasts collected at the interface of the two
solutions were harvested by centrifugation at 750 g for 5
min, washed twice in ice-cold buffers, once in ST and then
in STC (0.8 M Sorbitol, 50 mM CaCl2, 100 mM Tris-HCl
pH = 7.5; [36]). They were resuspended in 4/5 STC, 1/5
50% PTC buffer (50% PEG 3350 [Sigma-Aldrich], 100
mM CaCl2, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at a final concentration of 5–10 × 107 protoplasts/ml and kept on ice.

For transformation, 5 µg or 10 µg of DNA suspended in a
maximum of 50 µl TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1
mM EDTA) were mixed gently with 100 µl protoplasts and
placed on ice. After 30 min, 900 µl of PTCS buffer (50%
PTC containing 0.8 M sorbitol) was added and incubation
continued at room temperature for 30 min. Aliquots of

the protoplasts were mixed with 2.5 ml molten (37°C)
top PDAS (PDA with 0.8 M sucrose and 0.3% w/v agar),
and overlaid onto 30 ml of selective medium (PDAS containing 8 µg/ ml of hygromycin B. Plates were incubated
at 26°C and colonies appeared within 2–4 days. Numerous small colonies stopped growing after 2–3 days. These
were interpreted as abortive transformants. Only the colonies that grew after this delay were considered resistant to
hygromycin. When co-transformation experiments were
performed, 5 µg of the transforming plasmid was mixed
with 5 µg of pBC-Hygro.
DNA manipulation
All the nucleic acid manipulations were performed using
standard methods [37]. For Southern blot analysis,
genomic DNA was extracted as described in [38]. The
cosmid libraries were made in the pMoCosX vector as recommended by Orbach [39]. The library XSG was obtained
with XhoI partially digested wt genomic DNA. Determination of gene representation in the XSG library was performed by estimating the number of clones containing
conserved genes (NhNia encoding the nitrate reductase,
NhHsp70 and NhHsp90 encoding molecular chaperones,
NhTUB1 encoding β-tubulin, NhTEF1 encoding the translation initiation factor eEF1A) by PCR, Southern blot
hybridization, or direct cloning using a complementation
screen. Each tested gene was represented by 2 to 5 independent clones, indicating that the library contained at
least four N. haematococca genome equivalents. Library
XN was made with SalI partially digested wt genomic
DNA following the same protocol as for the XSG library.
The sequence of the mutant alleles was performed on two
independent PCR amplification products, obtained with
oligonucleotides im317 (5'-TGATCAACCTCCACGCACAT-3') and ip2393c (5'-AAGGAGATATCGCGCAGGCT3'). Identification of the 3' end of the SesA and SesB genes
was done by 3'-RACE using the 5'/3' RACE kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Meylan, France) on polyA+ mRNA extracted
from 2-day-old mycelium, using for SesA oligonucleotide
ip238 (5'-AAGAGGCCGTGAGACAAGAG-3'), and for
SesB ip974c (5'-CCAAGACGACCGATAGAAGA-3').
GenBank accession
The genBank accession no. for cosmid XN31E6 sequences
is AY572411.

Authors' contributions
SG performed all the experimental work and contributed
to the interpretation of the data. PS and MJD performed
part of the phylogenetic analysis, contributed to the interpretation of the data, and supervised the work. The writing of the manuscript was done in teamwork. All authors
read and approved the final manuscript.
