Abstract
Background: In the emerging field of environmental genomics, direct cloning and sequencing of
genomic fragments from complex microbial communities has proven to be a valuable source of new
enzymes, expanding the knowledge of basic biological processes. The central problem of this so
called metagenome-approach is that the cloned fragments often lack suitable phylogenetic marker
genes, rendering the identification of clones that are likely to originate from the same genome
difficult or impossible. In such cases, the analysis of intrinsic DNA-signatures like tetranucleotide
frequencies can provide valuable hints on fragment affiliation. With this application in mind, the
TETRA web-service and the TETRA stand-alone program have been developed, both of which
automate the task of comparative tetranucleotide frequency analysis.
Availability: http://www.megx.net/tetra
Results: TETRA provides a statistical analysis of tetranucleotide usage patterns in genomic
fragments, either via a web-service or a stand-alone program. With respect to discriminatory
power, such an analysis outperforms the assignment of genomic fragments based on the (G+C)content, which is a widely-used sequence-based measure for assessing fragment relatedness. While
the web-service is restricted to the calculation of correlation coefficients between tetranucleotide
usage patterns of submitted DNA sequences, the stand-alone program generates a much more
detailed output, comprising all raw data and graphical plots. The stand-alone program is controlled
via a graphical user interface and can batch-process a multitude of sequences. Furthermore, it
comes with pre-computed tetranucleotide usage patterns for 166 prokaryote chromosomes,
providing a useful reference dataset and source for data-mining.
Conclusions: Up to now, the analysis of skewed oligonucleotide distributions within DNA
sequences is not a commonly used tool within metagenomics. With the TETRA web-service and
stand-alone program, the method is now accessible in an easy to use manner for a broad audience.
This will hopefully facilitate the interrelation of genomic fragments from metagenome libraries,
ultimately leading to new insights into the genetic potentials of yet uncultured microorganisms.

Background
At present, a majority of the microbes from natural microbial communities cannot be transferred into pure cultures, either because proper cultivation conditions have
yet to be found, or due to currently unidentified fundamental obstacles [1]. For decades, this has limited our
understanding of the functioning of microbes within their
natural habitats, such as their metabolic roles, interactions and dependencies.
The metagenome-approach allows for the first time to circumvent the restrictions imposed by the limited culturability of environmental microorganisms [2]. Now, DNA
fragments of 40 – 150 kb of uncultured microorganisms
can be cloned directly from the environment. This delivers
insights into the microorganisms' genetic potentials,
sometimes even allowing the reconstruction of entire
genomes. Prominent example include the unexpected
finding of bacteriorhodopsin in marine Gammaproteobacteria [3-6], and the almost complete reconstruction of two
bacterial genomes from an acid mine drainage microbial
biofilm [7], respectively.
However, the metagenome-approach is not without its
limitations and problems. A major constraint is that especially small genomic fragments, as are obtained from
libraries that have been constructed with fosmids or cosmids as cloning vectors, often lack suitable phylogenetic
marker genes. This leads to the problem that fragments
belonging to the same organism cannot be reliably identified as such unless they overlap. In order to nonetheless
interrelate such genomic fragments, measures such as the
(G+C)-content or BLAST hits and codon usage of the fragment's coding regions are commonly used to assess
whether two unlinked fragments from a metagenome
library belong to the same organism. These measures,
however, can produce ambiguous or even misleading
results, and should be supplemented by additional tools
that assess the relatedness of the genomic fragments [8].
Since numerous studies have shown that oligonucleotide
frequencies within DNA sequences exhibit species-specific
patterns [9-18], comparative analysis of such oligonucleotide frequencies is a promising approach to this problem. For tetranucleotides, it has even been demonstrated
that their frequencies carry an innate but weak phylogenetic signal [19]. Comparative analysis of tetranucleotide
usage patterns also provides a good balance between computational requirements and attainable resolution. This
makes the method particularly well-suited for use as a
high-throughput method that can assist in tackling the
fragment identification problem in metagenomics [8].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/163

In order to automate and facilitate such an analysis, the
TETRA software suite was developed, comprising both, a
web-service and a stand-alone program.

Implementation
The algorithms that are used within TETRA have been
described elsewhere [8]. In brief, DNA sequences are
extended by their reverse-complements to compensate for
different patterns of tetranucleotide over- and underrepresentation between the leading and the lagging strand.
Then, the frequencies of all 256 possible tetranucleotides
are counted and the corresponding expected frequencies
are calculated by means of a maximal-order Markov
model from the sequences' di- and trinucleotide composition. In order to evaluate the significance of the level of
over- or underrepresentation for each tetranucleotide, the
divergence between the observed and expected tetranucleotide frequencies is then transferred into z-scores using an
approximation published by Schbath [20,21]. Finally, all
DNA sequences are compared in pairs by computing the
Pearson's correlation coefficient of their z-scores. Details
on the method, its applicability and its limits are given in
Teeling et al. (2004) and the TETRA online manual.
The TETRA web-service [22] has been implemented as set
of PERL CGI scripts. Access is free to all users. A multiheaded FASTA file with DNA sequence data can be
uploaded (actual file size limit: 2 Mb) and after having
entered a valid e-mail address, the calculation can be
started (Figure 1). Results are sent to the respective e-mail
address as a tab-delimited crosstabulation of correlation
coefficients in plain text format.
The TETRA stand-alone program can be downloaded for
free from the TETRA website [23]. The current release has
been implemented in REALbasic (http://www.realsoft
ware.com REAL Software Inc., Austin, Texas) and is available for Mac OS X. Versions for Linux and Windows are
also available, but differ in details regarding their implementation and features. The counting of the tetranucleotides in the current version of TETRA stand-alone
program is done by ocount – a self-written C program that
has been integrated into the program.

Results and discussion
TETRA web-service
The TETRA web-service computes correlation coefficients
between tetranucleotide usage patterns of DNA
sequences, which can be used as an indicator of sequence
relatedness. Details on the in- and output formats is available in the comprehensive online documentation [22].
TETRA stand-alone program
The stand-alone version of TETRA has many additional
features that are not available via the TETRA web-service.

Firstly, it comes with pre-computed tetranucleotide usage
patterns of all 166 prokaryote chromosomes that were
publicly available by June 2004 (Figure 2). These patterns
have been incorporated into the program to provide the
user with reference data that can also be used to get familiar with the program. With a few mouse clicks, correlation

coefficients for the tetranucleotide usage patterns of all
genomes can be computed and exported into PHYLIP format [24]. While not being well-suited for phylogenetic
reconstruction, the resolution boundaries of the method
can be easily evaluated by looking at the resulting whole
genome trees.

Secondly, besides calculating correlation coefficients for
tetranucleotide usage patterns, the TETRA stand-alone
program allows the user to investigate the raw data (Figure
2) and can produce plots for a more detailed analysis of
tetranucleotide over- and underrepresentations (Figure
3). This allows for hints into possible restriction sites by
the examination of significantly underrepresented tetranucleotides. Tetranucleotide usage patterns for user-provided sequences can be generated in two ways. Single
sequences shorter than 100 kb can be pasted into the so
called 'Single Sequence Window'. From there, a sequence
can be extended by its reverse complement and its tetranucleotide usage pattern can be calculated. Additionally, the
sequence's base composition and GC-content can be computed. Sequences longer than 100 kb or files with multiple sequences can be imported by the 'Batch Mode'. The
'Batch Mode' reads a multi-headed FASTA file and computes the tetranucleotide usage patterns of all sequences
within this file in a fully automated manner.

The tetranucleotide usage patterns of an average-sized
genome (4 Mb) is computed in less than 10 minutes on a
dual 1.8 GHz G5 (IBM PPC 970) computer. Newly computed tetranucleotide usage patterns are displayed within
the 'Navigator' window, which is the central place for data
management, access to the raw data and the calculation of
plots and correlation coefficients (Figure 2). Raw data and
correlation coefficients that have been computed for multiple patterns can be saved as tab-delimited tables in
plain-text format and the graphical output (2D-plots) can
be saved in JPEG-format.
A detailed documentation of the TETRA stand-alone program and its functions is available via the program's
online help system.
Applicability
As has been demonstrated in a previous study [8], the
analysis of tetranucleotide usage patterns is often (but not

based measure it is affected by local changes in sequence
composition. For example, large stretches of horizontally

acquired genes will blur the resolution. Likewise,
resolution is a function of sequence-length, i.e. the shorter
the sequence, the less meaningful a tetranucleotide frequency analysis will be.

• Any restrictions to use by non-academics: none

While the method works quite well for sequences in the
range of 40 kb, it is certainly not suited for the analysis of
single-read end-sequences, which are usually shorter than
1 kb. Since the phylogenetic signal within tetranucleotide
usage patterns is faint, the method performs weakly for
whole genome phylogenetic tree reconstructions. In a
whole-genome tree calculated from the pre-computed
166 prokaryotic chromosomes (data not shown), organisms are mostly grouped at the species level and at the
level of genera, when these are closely related (i.e.
Escherichia sp., Shigella sp., Yersinia sp. or Mesorhizobium
sp., Sinorhizobium sp., Bradyrhizobium sp.). However, more
distantly related genera or even species with larger evolutionary distances are often not correctly clustered (e.g.
Prochlorococcus sp.).

megx – marine environmental genomics

Therefore, the analysis of tetranucleotide usage patterns
should not be regarded as a tool to deduce phylogenetic
relationships, but rather as a fingerprinting technique for
genomic fragment correlation. For example, assignment
of fosmid-sized genomic fragments from metagenome
libraries of a microbial consortia that mediates the anaerobic oxidation of methane was possible using tetranucleotide frequency analysis, and was shown to be in perfect
agreement with 16S rRNA sequence analysis [8].

Conclusions
With the worldwide ongoing programs to sequence and
analyze natural communities, new approaches for
sequence correlation beyond G+C content, read densities
and codon usage have to be developed and made available to the users. The easy to use TETRA software will facilitate this task and provide additional decision support for,
e.g., fragment assignment also when complete genomes
have to be assembled in environmental sequencing
projects.
