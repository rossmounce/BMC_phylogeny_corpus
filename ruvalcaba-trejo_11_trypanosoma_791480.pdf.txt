The Trypanosoma cruzi Sylvio X10 strain
maxicircle sequence: the third musketeer
Laura I Ruvalcaba-Trejo, Nancy R Sturm*

Abstract
Background: Chagas disease has a diverse pathology caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and is indigenous
to Central and South America. A pronounced feature of the trypanosomes is the kinetoplast, which is comprised of
catenated maxicircles and minicircles that provide the transcripts involved in uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing.
T. cruzi exchange genetic material through a hybridization event. Extant strains are grouped into six discrete typing
units by nuclear markers, and three clades, A, B, and C, based on maxicircle gene analysis. Clades A and B are the
more closely related. Representative clade B and C maxicircles are known in their entirety, and portions of A, B, and
C clades from multiple strains show intra-strain heterogeneity with the potential for maxicircle taxonomic markers
that may correlate with clinical presentation.
Results: To perform a genome-wide analysis of the three maxicircle clades, the coding region of clade A
representative strain Sylvio X10 (a.k.a. Silvio X10) was sequenced by PCR amplification of specific fragments
followed by assembly and comparison with the known CL Brener and Esmeraldo maxicircle sequences. The clade
A rRNA and protein coding region maintained synteny with clades B and C. Amino acid analysis of non-edited and
5’-edited genes for Sylvio X10 showed the anticipated gene sequences, with notable frameshifts in the non-edited
regions of Cyb and ND4. Comparisons of genes that undergo extensive uridine insertion and deletion display a
high number of insertion/deletion mutations that are likely permissible due to the post-transcriptional activity of
RNA editing.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic analysis of the entire maxicircle coding region supports the closer evolutionary
relationship of clade B to A, consistent with uniparental mitochondrial inheritance from a discrete typing unit TcI
parental strain and studies on smaller fragments of the mitochondrial genome. Gene variance that can be
corrected by RNA editing hints at an unusual depth for maxicircle taxonomic markers, which will aid in the ability
to distinguish strains, their corresponding symptoms, and further our understanding of the T. cruzi population
structure. The prevalence of apparently compromised coding regions outside of normally edited regions hints at
undescribed but active mechanisms of genetic exchange.

Background
Trypanosoma cruzi is a unicellular eukaryotic organism
that causes a deadly condition referred to as Chagas disease indigenous to Central and South America. Approximately 18-20 million people are infected with T. cruzi,
with between 30,000 and 50,000 deaths per year due to
chronic Chagas disease. Thirty-percent of patients
infected show chronic stage Chagas disease symptoms,
including mega syndromes such as enlargement of the

esophagus, colon or heart, or complications in the nervous system, ultimately causing death [1,2]. Transmission of T. cruzi to humans occurs via a blood-sucking
vector, the triatomine bug, a.k.a. the assassin bug, which
is part of the Reduviidae subfamily. As the triatomine
takes a blood meal from the human host, the bug leaves
behind T. cruzi-contaminated feces on the skin of the
host. Scratching of the wound causes self-infection, as
T. cruzi enters the blood stream and replicates in
macrophages, but eventually settles in smooth and cardiac tissues.
The members of the Order Trypanosomatida have a
distinguishing factor: the kinetoplast. The kinetoplast is

a disk-like structure that contains mitochondrial DNA
(kDNA) in the form of dozens of maxicircles (20-40 kb)
and thousands of minicircles (0.5-10 kb) in a catenated
network with varying sizes depending on species [3].
The astounding process known as uridine insertion/
deletion RNA editing produces the dramatic alterations
required to convert skeletal primary transcripts into
functional messages through the post-transcriptional
addition of up to half of the coding information. The
editing process is directed by the largely minicirclecoded guide RNAs (gRNAs) that specify the insertion or
deletion of uridines within some of the maxicircleencoded transcripts [4].
The population structure of T. cruzi has been of great
interest in the quest to link parasite genetics to clinical
disease. The non-meiotic exchange of genetic information [5] between the major lineages may have occurred
only twice in the entire history of the species [6,7],
although more regular exchange among close relatives
may provide a unique form of intra-strain copy correction [7-10]. Currently six classes of T. cruzi groups are
defined, termed discrete typing units (DTUs) [11,12]
and referred to as T. cruzi I-VI, or TcI-VI [13]; in this
updated nomenclature, TcI is the equivalent of DTU I,
TcII of DTU IIb, and TcIII-VI of DTUs IIc, IIa, IId and
IIe, respectively.
Kinetoplast biology may play a direct role in disease
and pathogenesis [8]. Minicircles can integrate into the
host genome [1,14,15], with the potential to effect gene
expression in host cells and trigger an autoimmune
response. Maxicircle gene deletions were associated with
asymptomatic patients infected with T. cruzi [16],
although the correlation was not sustained [10]. Both
minicircles and maxicircles have been used as taxonomic markers [17-19] in the effort to correlate specific
strains with clinical manifestations, although the usefulness of the heterogeneous minicircles is debatable [20].
The genealogical relationship of 45 T. cruzi strains
was constructed using the 1.5-kb maxicircle COII-NDI
region, defining three clades, A, B and C, in which A
and B form a monophyletic group, with a basal clade C
[18]. The analysis of mitochondrial gene Cyb in 20 T.
cruzi strains also showed a similar pattern of clades and
clade relationship [21]. The CL Brener and Esmeraldo
strains, members of DTUs TcVI and TcII, respectively,
were the focus for whole genome shotgun sequencing
[22]. Using the sequence reads generated from both
strains, complete maxicircle sequences for both Esmeraldo and CL Brener were assembled [23] and the minicircle components analyzed [24]. The CL Brener
maxicircle is a representative of mitochondrial clade B,
which includes strains from DTUs TcIII-VI, and the
Esmeraldo maxicircle a mitochondrial clade C exemplar.
Complete open reading frames (ORFs), partial ORFs,

frame shifts, and genes with missing start codons are
representative of the mitochondrial genes found on the
maxicircle coding region, most of which are corrected at
the transcript level by the RNA editing process. Strikingly, both of the T. cruzi maxicircles contain frameshifts in areas not usually subject to RNA editing, with
Esmeraldo carrying a substantial deletion encompassing
the 5’ end of two opposing genes. These degenerations
were attributed to the time the strains spent in laboratory culture, however the finding of the Esmeraldo deletion in the human population [10] indicates that
maxicircle deletions are a normal part of maxicircle
biology. Speculation has begun as to how the cells survive with partial mitochondrial function due to the lack
of Complex I [25]; the bioenergetic consequences are
minimal in T. cruzi strains with compromised maxicircle
genes [26], consistent with survival of experimentally
compromised T. brucei lines that demonstrate Complex
I participation in electron transport [27].
To further examine T. cruzi maxicircles and better
understand their genetic variation, we amplified and
sequenced the coding region of a clade A/DTU TcI
representative Sylvio X10 to compare and contrast gene
synteny and content. Comparison of non-edited genes
and 5’-edited genes showed functional genes in Sylvio
X10 and CL Brener that are mutated in Esmeraldo.
Analysis of the three clades showed strain specific insertion/deletion mutations and small nuclear polymorphisms in both edited and non-edited regions. The high
variance within the edited genes in particular may be a
fertile source of taxonomic markers to further understand the mitochondrial DNA evolution and RNA editing in T. cruzi and other kinetoplastids.

Results
Conserved Synteny Among the Three Clades

The three maxicircle coding regions from the three
clade taxon representatives Sylvio X10 [GenBank:
FJ203996], CL Brener [GenBank:DQ343645] and Esmeraldo [GenBank:DQ343646] were syntenic beginning with
the 12S rRNA gene and ending with the ND5 gene
(Table 1). Comparing the coding region sequence
lengths beginning at the 12S rRNA and ending near the
3’ end of ND5 at the equivalent nucleotide sequence for
the three maxicircles, Sylvio X10 has 15,185 bp, CL
Brener has 15,167 bp, and Esmeraldo has the shortest
coding region of 14,935 bp. Only DTU TcII strain
Esmeraldo shows a 236-nt deletion at the 5’ end of the
CR4 and ND4 genes, although this deletion is not characteristic of the DTU [23]; otherwise, the lengths of the
coding regions were comparable for individual genes
among the three strains. The Sylvio X10 ND5 gene is
incomplete due to the absence of conserved sites for oligonucleotide placement within the adjacent maxicircle

divergent region, and ~1600 nt of the anticipated ~1770
nt were sequenced.
A major revision is included in the annotation of the
MURF5 gene for the CL Brener and Esmeraldo strain
maxicircles. Whereas MURF5 is described as 5’ edited
and 147-148 nt in length, the corrected identification is
for a non-edited gene of 261-267 nt, depending on the
strain. The gene sequence is provided in Additional
file 1, Figure S1, along with the predicted translation in
alignment including the T. brucei predicted protein.
MURF5 was notable for the relatively high number of
insertion/deletion (indel) mutations throughout the
gene, disrupting the open reading frames at the carboxyl-terminus in CL Brener and Esmeraldo.
Evolutionary Relationship Between the Clade Coding
Regions

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the three T.
cruzi clades and the T. brucei and L. tarentolae maxicircles spanning the 12S rRNA gene through the partial
ND5 gene from Sylvio X10 (Figure 1). Clades A and B
formed a monophyletic group to the exclusion of lineage
C in a Neighbor Joining (NJ) tree rooted by L. tarentolae. The A and B clades are supported by 100% of the

bootstrap replicates, offering significant statistical support for this branching order among clades A, B and C.
The tree topology supports previous phylogenetic analyses using either COII-NDI or Cyb genes [18,19].
The relationship between clades A and B validates the
model that a DTU TcI strain contributed to the genetic
make-up of the heterozygous hybrid DTUs TcV and TcVI.
In our genealogy TcI is a ‘grandparent’ of the heterozygous
hybrids, and the maxicircle genome was passed down
through a homozygous hybrid TcIII strain [23].
Maxicircle-encoded gRNA in Sylvio complements CL
Brener

A predicted gRNA gene was found in the Sylvio X10
maxicircle at positions 11764-11804 (Figure 2). An
equivalent gRNA from the CL Brener maxicircle is
located between the genes for CR4 and ND4 at positions 11744-11784 in the intergenic region, containing
the information to direct the RNA editing of the
MURF2 gene [24]. The Sylvio X10 maxicircle gRNA
overlaps the start codon of the ND4 gene; the posttranscriptionally added poly(U) tail could provide the
base pairing downstream of the gRNA coding region
for both.

Figure 1 Phylogenetic relationship among the three clade representatives. A Neighbor Joining tree shows 100% bootstrap for clade A and
B and for clade A and B. The bootstrap and NJ tree were calculated using MEGA 4.0 default parameters and the coding region of the maxicircle
from 12S to partial ND5 for each strain. T. brucei and L. tarentolae were used as outgroups. Sylvio X10 is a representative of clade A; CL Brener is
a representative of clade B; Esmeraldo is a representative of clade C.

Along the 41-nt length of the predicted gRNA gene,
six transitions differentiate the Sylvio X10 and CL
Brener gRNA genes. Due to the permissive nature of
the gRNA-mRNA interaction, the two gRNAs impart
identical editing information, although the 8-bp anchor
region that provides the initial interaction between the
partially edited mRNA and the gRNA in CL Brener is
less stable due to the presence of two wobble pairs. The
Esmeraldo maxicircle MURF2 gRNA is lost in the 236nt CR4/ND4 deletion [23]; a second CL Brener maxicircle gRNA was found downstream of the ND5 gene,
beyond the region sequenced for Sylvio X10.
Average Percent Identities Among Clades A, B, and C

The percent identities for the coding and intergenic
regions and the non-edited proteins were calculated
using the GLOBAL alignment feature in BioEdit 5.0.9 by
pairwise comparisons of the three clades (Table 2). For
this analysis, each category of sequence was assembled
into a single file for each strain to generate an overall
percentage of identity. Minor differences were seen at
this level among the three clades in the rRNA or protein-coding genes or for the predicted translations of
the non-edited genes, although there is a bias toward a
closer relationship between clade A and clade B. The

combined intergenic regions showed a wider differentiation among the strains, with clades A and B showing
the higher levels of identity. Indel corrections were not
made for any strain prior to the comparisons, and the
absence of an entire intergenic region in Esmeraldo was
likewise not compensated in the other strains. Thus, the
equivalent comparisons using strains with intact maxicircles may show higher levels of identity among the
protein sequences in particular.
Single nucleotide indels in two non-edited regions of
Sylvio X10

The presence of indels outside of regions anticipated to
be edited relative to the CL Brener maxicircle implied
that Esmeraldo was degenerate in at least five genes
[23]. While the functional implications for mitochondrial biology are unclear, the maxicircle coding region of
Esmeraldo is useful for taxonomic purposes. In the Sylvio X10 coding region, two genes showed indels in their
nucleotide sequences that created early stop codons.
The cytochrome b (Cyb) gene produces a transcript
that is 5’-end edited. This 1080-bp gene contained intact
reading frames downstream of the presumptive edited
region in CL Brener and Esmeraldo, but contained an
extra thymidine at nucleotide 818 in the Sylvio X10

sequence (Figure 3A) that resulted in an early stop
codon at amino acid 273 (Figure 3B). An intact 360
amino acid ORF is found in CL Brener and Esmeraldo,
and deletion of the extra nucleotide in Sylvio X10
restored a conserved ORF through the carboxyl-terminus of the protein (Figure 3C).
The ND4 gene produces transcripts that do not
require editing in CL Brener, however in Sylvio X10 this
gene contained a single nucleotide insertion at position
656 (Figure 4A) that created an early stop codon at
position 226 in the predicted amino acid sequence (Figure 4B). When the nucleotide was deleted manually in
the Sylvio X10 sequence, the ND4 transcript can be
translated into a complete ORF similar to that of CL
Brener (Figure 4C). The Esmeraldo gene contains a
major deletion of the 5’-end of the first 99 nts, however
the remaining sequence showed conservation of the
ND4 coding information.
For both Cyb and ND4, the relatively high levels of
sequence identity flanking the Sylvio X10 indels indicated
that the overall selective pressure to carry a functional
gene is present. The same is true of the compromised
gene sequences found in CL Brener and Esmeraldo.
Indeed, the indels found in all three genomes point to
the poor quality of maxicircle replication, and beg the
question of how genome integrity is maintained.
SNP analysis supports the clade A-clade B relationship

Comparative analysis of maxicircle protein coding genes
with little or no RNA editing and their predicted amino
acid sequences showed different indels and unique SNPs
among the three clades (Table 3). For the alignments
used in this analysis, the basic rules that apply to extensively edited genes were used: namely, pyrimidines and
purines were scored as functional equivalents. Thus,
where an alignment program would introduce an indel
where a C and T fell, it was scored as a SNP rather
than an indel for this analysis. For the purposes of
amino acid comparison, any internal frameshifts were
compensated for prior to protein alignment.

The prevalence of SNPs varied between 10.8% and
14% among this subset of genes. A total of 155 aa
changes resulted from 930 SNPs, revealing that one in
six nucleotide mutations resulted in an alteration of
amino acid sequence and supporting presence of a
selective pressure to maintain the primary protein identity. In contrast to the SNP distribution, the frequency
of amino acid alterations varied among the genes within
a range of 1.4% for COI to 10.3% for the analyzed portion of the ND5 gene. The presence of indels in specific
genes correlated with the nonviable mutations in each
strain. The Esmeraldo maxicircle carried the greatest
number of indels in this category of gene, with 10 in
MURF1, 13 in MURF2, 11 in MURF5, 102 in ND4, and
7 in the partial sequence of ND5. The presence of indels
in Cyb and ND4 in Sylvio X10 leave only ND1, COI and
COII in functional condition in all three maxicircles
among the genes requiring no or minimal editing of
their transcripts; the extensively edited genes cannot be
judged as easily.
The addition of the Sylvio X10 MURF5 gene to the
alignments altered the previous annotations of the CL
Brener and Esmeraldo MURF5 genes [23], extending
their sequences by over 115 nt each and revealing frameshifts in both at the extreme 3’ end of the genes. The
resulting ORF is conserved with the T. brucei MURF5
gene, lending confidence to the analysis (Additional file
1, Figure S1). The MURF5 gene displayed a high number of deletions for its relatively small size, with a trio of
three-nt frame shifts in the front half of the gene that
may be acceptable for protein function. In the Sylvio
X10 maxicircle, the 3’ end of MURF5 overlapped with
the first 7 nt of the adjacent ND9 gene, which is transcribed in the same orientation. Thus, the frameshifts in
CL Brener and Esmeraldo that throw the termination
codon out of frame may result in longer proteins that
are still functional. The conservation of primary nucleotide sequence at the 3’ end of the genes indicates that
the Sylvio X10 frame represents the biologically relevant
reference.
At both the cumulative levels of SNPs and of amino
acid changes, the linkage between clades A and B was
the most pronounced, although not always significant
for any particular individual gene. The variability of
amino acid replacement for each gene product may
reflect the biological tolerance to change as selected by
function.
Extensively edited genes contain abundant thymidine
indels

A similar comparative analysis was performed at the
nucleotide level for the extensively edited gene set,
emphasizing the SNP and indel variability relative to
clade (Table 4). Due to the primary sequence variability

Figure 3 An insertion in the unedited region of the Sylvio X10 Cyb gene. A) Portion of the Cyb nucleotide alignment from T. cruzi strains
Sylvio X10, CL Brener, and Esmeraldo. The Sylvio X10 Cyb gene contains an insertion (’i’ under the alignment) at position 817, disrupting the
reading frame and resulting in an early stop codon. Positions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are indicated by ‘s’ above the
alignment; the distribution of SNPs is compiled in Table 3. B) The predicted Cyb amino acid alignment based on the predicted edited sequence
in T. cruzi strains Sylvio X10, CL Brener and Esmeraldo. The T insertion present in position 817 causes an early stop codon (#) at position 284.
Positions in the alignment with ‘*’ below are identical; ‘.’ indicates a conservative change; a blank represents a non-conservative change or three
different amino acids. C) Deletion of Sylvio X10 817 insertion restores the full-length reading frame; the relevant portion of the alignment is
shown.

afforded to these genes by the RNA editing process,
standard sequence alignments were not particularly useful, and alignments were performed by eye. For some
genes, the actual RNA editing patterns from T. cruzi or,
in the absence of the T. cruzi edited sequence, T. brucei
were included for comparison.
The COIII gene illustrated the dramatic effect of RNA
editing on the primary sequences among the strains
(Figure 5). Although the SNP pattern within these genes
were not strong differentiators, the indel patterns were
revealing in their associations. A comparison of indels was
performed for the COIII gene, revealing 16 shared indels
between clades A and B, eight between clades B and C,
and five for clades A and C. Due to the unique mechanism
of the uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing process,
indels involving thymidine residues would be tolerated
with a wide degree of latitude. The association of the indel
patterns with particular clades cannot be assessed without
a broad survey of T. cruzi strains, and the permissive nature of the process may prove too accommodating to

provide useful taxonomic information. Given the abundance of indels detected among the three clade representatives relative to the size of their respective coding regions,
candidate genes for broader indel analysis emerged,
including COIII, ND7, ND8, and ND9.
Taken individually each gene showed a wide range of
associations among the three clades when considering
SNP variability, however the sum total of these differences revealed the bias toward the clade A/B relationship. The number of indels surpassed the SNPs
substantially, making them provocative markers for
these genes.
Non-edited genes have higher evolutionary pressure to
remain intact when indels cannot be corrected by RNA
editing. The indels in areas typically free of RNA editing
are summarized for the three clades (Figure 6); this
schematic differs from a previous incarnation [23] in
that the Sylvio X10 indels have been added, along with
several additional indels for Esmeraldo, and genes
judged not to be edited in T. brucei and L. tarentolae
despite the absence of canonical start codons are
marked accordingly.

Discussion
The majority of the coding region for T. cruzi strain Sylvio X10, a DTU TcI/mitochondrial clade A representative, was sequenced to complete the maxicircle trilogy
first defined by Machado and Ayala (2001). The close
association between the Sylvio X10 and CL Brener coding regions supports a model in which an ancestor
strain of DTU TcI provided the maxicircle to the progeny of a TcI-TcII hybridization event, resulting in the
generation of DTUs TcIII and TcIV [23]; a subsequent
‘back-cross’ hybridization between TcII and TcIII strains
resulted in the TcV and TcVI strains that carry the

percent identity of clades A and B is the highest across
comparisons of rRNA sequences, edited and non-edited

must be integrated into the analysis; with the complete
genome sequencing of other key T. cruzi strains in process, the usefulness of the maxicircle will be clarified in
the coming years. To better understand the genesis of
the extant clades, maxicircles from DTU TcIII are of
particular interest as the kDNA donor to the nuclear
heterogeneous hybrid lines in DTUs TcV and TcVI.
Perhaps the most striking finding in the study of T.
cruzi maxicircles is that genes producing transcripts that
are not anticipated to be RNA edited in all three strains

cruzi clade representatives have the same gene order in
the coding region with different number and location of
indels and SNPs. Early stop codons are created by indels
in the Cyb and ND4 genes of Sylvio X10, in the MURF1
and ND5 genes of Esmeraldo, and in the MURF2 gene
of CL Brener; in addition, the Esmeraldo maxicircle has
a 236-bp deletion affecting the opposing CR4 and ND4
genes, including the deletion of a gRNA in the intergenic region, and four individual indels in the MURF2
gene. The 5’-edited gene Cyb and the non-edited ND4
found in Sylvio X10 have indels that result in early termination codons that, when adjusted manually, result in
conserved ORFs, a general characteristic of all the nonedited region indels. The absence of drift in the
sequences downstream of the indels suggests that they
are relatively recent. The commonality of affected genes,
MURF2 in CL Brener and Esmeraldo and ND4 in
Esmeraldo and Sylvio X10, may reflect a hierarchy of
tolerable genes for functional loss. Given the ability of
the RNA editing mechanism to overcome frameshifts,
transcripts from all of the compromised genes must be
sequenced. With only two non-edited genes unscathed
in any of the three genomes, specifically COI and ND1,
the functional necessity of these genes versus their fortuitous exclusion from indel mutation will be clarified
with the sequencing of additional maxicircles. The
mechanism for the maintenance of these extra-nuclear
sequences thus becomes an interesting challenge for the
organism. Intriguing suggestions of mitochondrial fusion
in the hybridization process may provide the answer
[10], as maxicircles could share content information
across a heterogeneous population and a form of intercellular copy correction; the occurrence of the fusion
event within strains would have to be frequent, whereas
a combining of two disparate strains, such as would be
required to produce one of the genetic hybrid lines,
would be exceedingly rare.
The extensively-edited genes from the Sylvio X10, CL
Brener and Esmeraldo strains show that clades A and B
share the most SNPs, followed by clades B and C have
the second highest and clades A and C having the fewest shared SNPs. Although the gene sequence may vary
in the number of thymidines, RNA editing will insert or
delete the correct number of uridines to create ORFs
that can be translated to produce a functional protein.
Each strain has its unique number of indels and SNPs,
and comparison of Sylvio X10 and CL Brener shows
their close association in comparison to CL Brener and
Esmeraldo by this criterion as well.
Phylogenetic analysis of the T. cruzi population
through the use of microsatellite data has given rise to a
different postulated inheritance of the maxicircle genomes, in which clade B (TcIII) is the mitochondrial

Page 10 of 13

donor of hybrid DTUs TcV/VI [19]. The maxicircle genealogy shows clade A (TcI) as the mitochondrial donor
of hybrid DTUs TcV/VI [23]. Maxicircle coding region
comparison of the three clade representatives shows
that CL Brener, a DTU TcVI, is associated with the
clade A Sylvio X10 strain rather than the clade C
Esmeraldo strain. Therefore, the maxicircle was donated
from DTU TcIII, an ancient hybrid that inherited its
maxicircle from TcI [23].
With the maxicircle sequence available for clade B and
C representatives and the majority of the coding region
sequenced for clade A representative now complete,
further phylogenetic analysis can better define the T.
cruzi population structure by comparing the editing patterns across the three strains, or sequencing additional
maxicircles to see if the similar SNP and indel patterns
are followed within clades. The three-clade scheme was
based on the two non-edited genes COII and ND1 [18].
Use of the extensively edited genes for comparison across
strains from each clade might result in a more refined
clade scheme as compared to the phylogenetic relationship observed from maxicircle non-edited genes, and
provide further insight into the T. cruzi population structure. Alternatively, edited gene indels may behave as
microsatellites and prove useful for recent changes in
population structure, but be unhelpful for larger analyses.
The existence of complex I involved in electron transfer from NADH to coenzyme Q in trypanosomes has
been debated due to the viability of trypanosomes with
or without a functional complex I in varying environments and strains [25]. A viable strain without a functional complex I is the UC strain L. tarentolae [28].
Some Trypanosoma strains can survive with a partial
maxicircle, or even with complete loss of kDNA. Trypanosoma brucei relatives such as T. equiperdum and T.
evansii are examples that showed gradual reduction or
loss of kinetoplastid DNA [29]. T. equiperdum has a
partial kDNA and T. evansi no longer has kDNA, and
survive only in the bloodstream stage dependant on glycolysis and down-regulation of the mitochondria [30].
The ability of T. brucei strains to find a biological niche
for parasitism that frees them from the insect life stages
demonstrates the versatility of the kinetoplastids, and
may apply equally to T. cruzi.
Analysis of the Sylvio X10 maxicircle points to a DTU
TcI strain as the mitochondrial donor to hybrid DTUs
TcIII/IV, and strengthens our understanding of the
clade structure and evolution of T. cruzi. With sequencing becoming ever more affordable and accurate [31]
we will be able to sequence the mitochondrial maxicircle from representatives of each DTU and re-evaluate
the three-clade scheme to redefine or further confirm
the population structure as well as uncover markers for
strains and clades to better understand Chagas disease.

Conclusions
With the promise of additional maxicircle genome
sequences on the horizon [31], extensive studies will be
possible, allowing the quantification of the preliminary
observations made with the three clade representatives
used here. The use of extensively edited genes as useful
taxonomic markers provides a leap beyond the standard
mitochondrial DNA, long favored due to its rapid accumulation of mutations. The flexibility afforded by the
uridine addition and deletion process may prove to be
too high for broad phylogenetic conclusions. The unusual genetic exchange mechanism employed by T. cruzi
must also be taken into account, as the frequency of
this event and its participants are not yet clear. Indeed,
the relative lack of diversification within mitochondrial
clade B, encompassing both the nuclear homozygous
and heterozygous hybrid strains, is surprising, and
remains to be examined within the clade.

volume of reaction was 50 μl with T. cruzi Sylvio X10
genomic DNA at 0.93 μg, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM forward primer, 0.2 μM reverse primer, 10X standard CLP
Taq reaction buffer and 5U of NEB standard Taq DNA
polymerase. PCR products were purified using QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit from QIAGEN. Approximately 2 kb
of the divergent region was sequence to complete the 5’
end of the 12S rRNA gene and its analysis was not
included in this thesis.
Subcloning and Sequencing

Each PCR product was transformed into TOP-10 cells
(Invitrogen) and cloned using the TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen). The PCR primers for each respective PCR product were used for bidirectional sequencing through
Laragen, and internal sequencing primers were designed
when partial sequences were obtained (Table 6).

Methods
PCR Amplification

The nucleotide sequence of the maxicircle coding region
[GenBank:FJ203996] was obtained by PCR amplification
of Sylvio X10 maxicircle using different amplification
primers and PCR conditions. The primers pairs along
with their sequence, binding site, annealing temperature,
MgCl2 concentration, region amplified and product size
can be found in Table 5. PCR conditions to amplify the
maxicircle regions were: 3 min initial denaturation step
at 93°C, 30-sec subsequent denaturation at 93°C, primer
annealing for 30 sec at temperatures mentioned above,
primer extension at 72°C for variable times depending
on amplification length, for a total of 30 cycles. Total

Raw sequence data from chromatograms was analyzed
and edited using BioEdit 5.0.9 [32]. The PCR regions
amplified were aligned using BioEdit 5.0.9 by overlapping the scaffolds. Annotation of Sylvio X10 maxicircle
genes [GenBank:FJ203996] was done manually by comparing the published CL Brener [GenBank:DQ343645]
and Esmeraldo [GenBank:DQ343646] maxicircle coding
region sequences. BioEdit 5.0.9 was used to calculate
percent identity. As only a few RNA editing events have
been documented in T. cruzi, edited sequences were
inferred based on our previous analysis of T. cruzi maxicircles or using the cognate editing events in T. brucei
(see Additional file 1, Figure S1 for the complete
analysis).

Phylogenetic Analysis

The neighbor-joining tree was calculated using the program MEGA 4.0 and its default parameters using LodDet distance. The bootstrap values were calculated using
the same method. The NJ tree was constructed using
the nucleotide sequences of the coding region beginning
at the 12S rRNA gene and ending near the 3’ end of the
ND5 gene from Sylvio X10, CL Brener and Esmeraldo.
We used the same coding region of L. tarentolae and T.
brucei as outgroups.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Figure S1 - Alignments of all maxicircle genes
with SNPs and indels indicated for the three strains for which the
coding regions are available in their entirety. The genes are
presented in linear order along the length of the maxicircle, beginning
with the 12S rRNA gene. SNPs are indicated by ‘s’ above the alignment;
indels by ‘i’ below the alignments; for the ND5 analysis ‘v’ indicates a
transversion SNP. Predicted T. cruzi edited sequences highlit in green
differ from the new predictions for ND8, which are based on T. brucei
editing events. The MURF5 annotation and alignment differs from our
previous report [23], and shows the predicted amino acid alignment
including the T. brucei sequence.
