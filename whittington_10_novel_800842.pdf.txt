Abstract
Background: To date, few peptides in the complex mixture of platypus venom have been identified and
sequenced, in part due to the limited amounts of platypus venom available to study. We have constructed and
sequenced a cDNA library from an active platypus venom gland to identify the remaining components.
Results: We identified 83 novel putative platypus venom genes from 13 toxin families, which are homologous to
known toxins from a wide range of vertebrates (fish, reptiles, insectivores) and invertebrates (spiders, sea
anemones, starfish). A number of these are expressed in tissues other than the venom gland, and at least three of
these families (those with homology to toxins from distant invertebrates) may play non-toxin roles. Thus, further
functional testing is required to confirm venom activity. However, the presence of similar putative toxins in such
widely divergent species provides further evidence for the hypothesis that there are certain protein families that
are selected preferentially during evolution to become venom peptides. We have also used homology with known
proteins to speculate on the contributions of each venom component to the symptoms of platypus
envenomation.
Conclusions: This study represents a step towards fully characterizing the first mammal venom transcriptome. We
have found similarities between putative platypus toxins and those of a number of unrelated species, providing
insight into the evolution of mammalian venom.

Background
The venom of mammals such as shrews and the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) have been poorly studied to date, despite the fact that mammalian venom is
extremely unusual and that toxins are useful sources for
the development of novel pharmaceuticals; drugs have
been developed from the venoms of many species,
including various invertebrates, snakes, lizards, and
insectivores (reviewed in [1-4]). However, the recently
sequenced platypus genome [5] has provided a new
resource for the investigation of mammalian venom and
promises to vastly improve our knowledge of the contents of platypus venom, as well as to provide insight
into the evolution of this unique trait.
Male platypuses possess spurs on each hind leg that
are connected to paired venom glands on the dorsocaudal aspect of the abdomen to form the crural system [6].

Juvenile females are also in possession of these spurs,
which regress prior to adulthood; the venom system
develops only in the male. In adult males, the venom
glands increase in size during the spring breeding season
[7], which is to our knowledge the only such example of
temporally differential venom production. The venom
system is thought to have a reproductive role, such as in
territory defense, although this has not been conclusively proven (reviewed in [8]). Envenomation of
humans causes a number of unusual symptoms, including an immediate and excruciating pain that cannot be
relieved through normal first-aid practices, including
morphine, and generalized ‘whole body’ pain [9]. It also
causes nausea, gastric pain, cold sweats and lymph node
swelling [7]. Blood work reveals high erythrocyte sedimentation and low total protein and serum albumin
levels, and symptoms such as localized pain and muscle
wasting of the affected limb persist for weeks after envenomation [9].
Progress towards identifying the components of platypus venom has been hindered, in large part because of

the limited quantities of venom available for study
(reviewed in [8]). It is known that platypus venom contains 19 different peptide fractions plus non-protein
components [10,11], but only three of these have been
fully sequenced to date: C-type natriuretic peptides
(OvCNPs) [12,13], defensin-like peptides (OvDLPs)
[14,15], and nerve growth factor (OvNGF) [5]. Their
functions are as yet a mystery. A venom L-to-D-peptide
isomerase and hyaluronidase have also been discovered
but not sequenced [10]; the venom also has protease
activity [10].
Limited platypus envenomation events and a lack of
testing in rodent models, as is commonly done with
other venoms, have prevented the thorough understanding of the altered physiology that results from venom
infusion into victims. Much of what is currently known
about platypus venom has been gleaned from experiments during the 1800s, followed by proteomic studies
during the 1990s. Early experiments injecting platypus
venom into rabbits produced intravascular coagulation,
a drop in blood pressure (probably due to vasodilation),
and hemorrhagic edema [16,17]. More recent investigations also observed histamine release and cutaneous
anaphylaxis [7]. In vitro, the venom causes smooth muscle relaxation [10,17] and feeble hemolysis [17], and
when applied to cultured dorsal root ganglion cells, it
produces a calcium-dependent non-specific cation current into the cells, which in vivo may produce nerve firing and thus pain [18]. When applied in vitro, OvCNP
produces cation-specific ion channels [11], edema (swelling), smooth muscle relaxation and mast cell histamine
release [19], and it is speculated that the OvDLPs may
also produce mast cell degranulation [20].
In order to discover additional components of platypus venom, we constructed a cDNA library from an inseason adult male platypus venom gland, and have
sequenced it on two independent next-generation
sequencing platforms. This is the first venom transcriptome from any mammal, and so has great potential to
increase our knowledge of mammalian venom. Distinguishing venom peptides from genes encoding normal
body proteins (from which many venom peptides have
evolved [21]) can be challenging [8] without relying on
information from venoms of closely related species (of
which there are none for platypuses). Here, we characterize the platypus venom transcriptome and identify
putative venom genes by relying on homologies with
known venom peptides in unrelated species. We also
speculate on the functions of the encoded peptides in
relation to the symptoms of platypus envenomation.

Results
Two platypus venom gland cDNA libraries were
sequenced using the Illumina platform, which produced

Page 2 of 13

19,069,168 reads of 36 nucleotides in length, and the
454 FLX platform, which yielded 239,557 reads (average
length 180 nucleotides). These reads were aligned to the
platypus Ensembl genebuild (v.42). Of the 239,557 FLX
sequences, 50,254 had hits to 8,821 unique cDNA
sequences, of which 8,734 had amino acid translations
(from the total of 24,981 cDNA sequences, 24,763 of
which had amino acid translations) at 85% identity and
10-5. The remaining 189,303 reads that had no hits to
cDNA were aligned against the assembly (535,968
sequences from Ensembl v. 42). Of these, 151,313 had
hits to the assembly at 10-5 and 85% identity.
A visual representation of Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of 454 read data is shown in Figure S1 in Additional file 1. The most common GO terms were cellular
process, metabolic process, cell and cell part, binding,
and catalytic activity; full results are available online
[22]. It should be noted that GO terms such as regulation of transcription and regulation of translation, which
would be required to support production and secretion
of increased quantities of venom during the breeding
season, appear in this list.
We identified platypus venom genes based on homology to known venom proteins. This approach was taken
because we have previously found that there are homologues of all three known platypus venom peptides present in the venom of reptiles [5,23]. It has previously
been speculated by us as well as other groups (for example, [21]) that there may be specific protein motifs that
are preferentially selected for evolution to venom molecules independently in different animals, further supporting the use of our homology approach to identify
platypus venom genes. We thus identified novel putative
platypus venom genes by using TBLASTN to search the
animal toxins contained within the Tox-Prot database
[24] [most toxins contained within the database come
from reptilians (1,204 of 2,855; v 57.8 released September 2009)] against the platypus genome, and then looked
for Ensembl or GenomeScan gene predictions overlapping with 454 and Illumina reads. Sequences for peptides encoded by these putative venom genes are
available online [25].
After aligning reads and Tox-Prot proteins to the platypus genome, gene prediction in regions containing
both reads and Tox-Prot homologous regions yielded
155 putative genes. Predictions that did not have read
support or that were expressed in three or more (of six)
non-venom tissues were removed, leaving 83 putative
platypus venom genes (see Additional file 1 for further
details on toxin classification and Additional file 2 for
peptide sequences). A threshold of three non-venom tissues was chosen so as to limit the number of false negatives; we have previously shown that platypus venom
OvDLPs, OvNGF and OvCNPs are expressed in some

Whittington et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R95
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/9/R95

non-venom tissues. Those genes not expressed in any
non-venom tissues (33) were classified as probable
(likely) platypus venom genes (Table S1 in Additional
file 1).
BLAST searches of GenBank and the Tox-Prot database using the peptides encoded by these genes allowed
classification to toxin family (Figure 1; homology was
defined using E < 0.0001) and speculation about putative
functions (Table 1). The 83 putative platypus venom
peptides came from 13 different families; it appears that
like the venom of many snakes, platypus venom contains a large number of protein toxins from a small
number of families [26], possibly because after the initial
emergence of a toxin gene, subsequent duplications will
increase expression levels, and thus multigene toxin
families are formed [27]. GO annotation of these predicted peptides is shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that
the GO term ‘proteolysis’ is highly represented (31 have

this annotation), consistent with our analysis showing
33 protease-encoding genes. GO terms, including ‘blood
coagulation’, ‘pore complex biogenesis’, ‘cation transport’, ‘metallopeptidase activity’, ‘serine-type endopeptidase activity’, and ‘peptidase inhibitor activity’, also
match with the peptides encoded by the classes of
venom genes that we discovered. In many cases, it was
possible to link the putative functions of these peptides
with the symptoms of platypus envenomation and the
known pharmacological effects of the venom, which we
discuss below.
Proteases

Platypus venom has previously been found to have protease activity [10], and the largest group of putative platypus venom toxins identified were proteases (33 total;
12 expressed in venom gland alone are probable platypus venom toxins). These included 7 genes that had

greater than 500 Illumina reads mapping to them and
which therefore appear to be highly expressed. The
large number of protease genes and their high expression suggests that proteases are important components
of platypus venom. There are a number of hypotheses
for the activities of these, discussed in the following
paragraphs, but as a group they may act to cleave
venom components into active molecules in the secretory cells and lumen of the venom gland or in the tissues of the victim [10]. The general protease activity
could also help to dissolve tissue and facilitate the
spread of the venom.
Serine proteases

Twenty-six peptides were predicted from platypus
venom gland cDNA to have homology to serine proteases of several types, which are found in the venom of
most snakes [28]. Nine of these are expressed in venom
gland alone and are classified as probable venom toxins.
A phylogenetic tree of platypus serine protease
sequences is shown in Figure S2 in Additional file 1.
The kallikrein-type serine proteases encoded by five

genes found in the platypus venom transcriptome may
have effects including vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction, inflammation and nociperception (pain)
(reviewed in [29]). Kallikrein-like proteases are also present in shrew [30,31], lizard [32] and some snake
venoms [28]. Venom kallikreins generally possess a catalytic triad and 10 to 12 conserved cysteine residues
[31,33,34]. Not all of the identified platypus peptides
contain this catalytic triad (Figure 3), possibly due to problems with gene prediction, which is error-prone. However, the shrew peptides have rare non-homologous
insertions near Asp of this triad [31], and non-homologous
insertions are also found in lizard gilatoxin [32], indicating that some sequence variation is possible whilst
still maintaining the kallikrein-like activity of the
peptide.
Six of the putative platypus venom serine proteases
were found to have homology to endogenous coagulation factors (for example, Factor X), which are involved
in the blood coagulation cascade, and snake venom
group D prothrombin activators such as trocarin D,

which cause coagulation and inflammation [35]. Many
other proteins encoded by genes identified in the platypus venom transcriptome also appear to have hemostatic effects (Table 1), as do many snake venoms [36].
At first glance, the symptoms of platypus envenomation
do not point to hemostatic effects, but several studies
have shown that the venom does in fact affect blood
characteristics. Fenner et al. [9] recorded that an envenomated patient had a high erythrocyte sedimentation
value, meaning that there were increased levels of proclotting factors present in the blood, which can be indicative of inflammation. The patient himself also noted
that the spur wounds, despite being deep, bled little
even though the platypus had to be forcibly removed.
In vitro experiments have shown the venom to be a coagulant, and it also causes hemorrhagic edema [16,17].
We hypothesize that the putative venom serine proteases are responsible for some of these effects.

gland alone and are classified as probable venom toxins.
Zinc metalloproteinases are a second group of protease
enzymes present in snake venom, which cause bleeding
in the victim through fibrin(ogen)olytic activity
(reviewed in [28]). This is not a known symptom of platypus envenomation. However, some snake venom
metalloproteinases (including PIIIs) do not cause bleeding, and have instead been shown to cause inflammation
(reviewed in [37]). We thus hypothesize that the seven
metalloproteinases in platypus venom have inflammatory effects. The platypus venom peptides follow the
same structure as snake venom PIII metalloproteinases,
containing preprosequence, metalloproteinase, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domains [28] (Figure 4). This
conservation of domain and domain order across such
widely divergent species as the platypus and reptiles
again suggests the selection of certain peptide motifs for
evolution to venom molecules.

Metalloproteinases

Seven genes encoding PIII zinc metalloproteinases,
which contain the zinc binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH
[28], were found in the platypus venom transcriptome.
Three of these were found to be expressed in venom

Protease inhibitors

which are involved in controlling the blood coagulation

cascade [38,39]. Six of these are expressed in venom
gland alone and are classified as probable platypus
venom toxins. A neighbor-joining tree of putative platypus venom kunitz-type protease inhibitors plus nonvenom homologues is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen
that the putative platypus venom peptides cluster
together into a single clade, displaying the duplications
that have given rise to this putative toxin family.
Many snake venoms also contain serine protease inhibitors, which affect hemostasis and produce inflammation [40]; toxin kunitz-type protease inhibitors called
kalicludines are also found in sea anemones [41]. The
presence of these potential anticoagulant molecules may
seem at odds with the proposed coagulation effects of
some of the putative platypus venom serine proteases
identified above, but there are examples in snakes where
one venom contains multiple proteases with coagulant
and anticoagulant effects, or where one protease has
both effects; it is thought that in these cases the concentration of toxins determines the type of effect on the
victim (reviewed in [28]). The function of protease inhibitors in platypus venom gland is unclear, but it is suggested that perhaps these act to inhibit the catalytic

Page 7 of 13

activity of proteases [29] in the venom gland, so that
their effects are only released once the venom is injected
into the victim. Alternatively, these inhibitors may act as
neurotoxins or pro-inflammatory agents, as is the case
for some of the snake venom analogues (reviewed in
[42,43]). It should also be noted that in other species
the non-venom protease inhibitor bikunin inhibits proteolysis and inflammation [44]. The platypus protease
inhibitors thus may be expressed in the venom gland in
a protective capacity to prevent inflammation in the
host tissue and thus allow storage of the venom.
Proteins homologous to invertebrate venom components:
alpha-latrotoxin, CRiSPs, cytolytic toxin

Genes encoding proteins with homology to invertebrate
venom toxins were also found. For example, we identified seven genes encoding peptides with homology to
spider venom alpha-latrotoxin, a neurotoxin also containing ankyrin repeats, which causes a massive release
of neurotransmitters on contact with vertebrate neurones (reviewed in [45]). Three of these are expressed in
venom gland alone and are classified as probable platypus venom toxins. However, searches of alpha-latrotoxins against the GenBank database do reveal ankyrin
repeat-containing proteins from non-venomous species
at similar identities, raising the possibility that this peptide family plays a non-toxin role in the platypus venom
gland. It is also possible that the homologous platypus
peptides may act, like the alpha-latrotoxins, as potent
neurotoxins responsible for the production of pain.
Functional studies will be required to determine which
hypothesis is correct.
Six genes encoding proteins with homology to CRiSPs
(cysteine rich secretory proteins), which are present in a
diverse range of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms,

were also found. All putative platypus venom CRiSP
genes were found expressed in one or more non-venom
tissues, raising the possibility that they may have nonvenom function. However, CRiSPs have been found in
cone snail venom acting as proteases, and in snake and
lizard venom acting as ion channel blockers, blockers of
smooth muscle contraction (reviewed in [46]), and myotoxins [47]. The platypus CRiSPs may thus act as ion
channel blockers to produce the muscle wasting observed
in envenomated patients [9] and the in vitro effect of
smooth muscle relaxation [10,17]. An analysis of the
domains contained within the putative platypus venom
CRiSPs is shown in Figure S3 in Additional file 1.
One protein with homology to sea anemone cytolytic
toxins (for example, actinoporin) was also found. This
was not found expressed in tissues other than the
venom gland and on this basis is classified as a probable
platypus venom toxin. This peptide has a sea anemone
cytotoxic protein domain, is homologous to peptides
such as hemolytic toxin and actinoporin Or-A, and does
not show significant homology along its length to any
proteins from other species in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Sea anemone cytotoxic proteins bind to cell membranes and
have cation-selective pore-forming activity [48]; we thus
suggest that the platypus homologue could cause the
weak hemolysis (breaking open of red blood cells) [17]
as well as pain [9] that have been observed in envenomated victims. However, actinoporin homologues have
also recently been discovered in some vertebrates and
plants (for example, [49]), again raising the possibility
that this peptide is not a venom toxin and plays some
other role in the venom gland. Functional studies will
be required to confirm or refute the role of the platypus
homologue in toxicity.
Stonustoxin-like proteins

Another large group of putative platypus venom genes
(18; 8 expressed in venom gland alone) were found to
encode proteins with homology to stonustoxin, verrucotoxin and neoverrucotoxin (related peptides from the
venom of the stonefish Synanceja sp. [50,51]), and snake
venom ohanins. Previously, no overall sequence homology between the stonefish toxins and other proteins had
been found [51]. The alpha- and beta-subunits of stonustoxin are partially homologous and share a domain
(B.30.2, also known as PRY-SPRY) with other proteins
that may be involved in ligand binding or protein folding [52], as well as with snake venom ohanin. All of the
platypus peptides also possess SPRY, PRY, or both
domains, in combination with other domains (Figure S4
in Additional file 1).
Ohanin affects the central nervous system and is proposed to cause pain and reduce locomotion for both

Page 8 of 13

offence and defense [53]. This effect is strikingly similar
to what has been proposed as the mechanism of action
for platypus venom on other platypuses [20]. Stonustoxin and neoverrucotoxin produce hypertension (high
blood pressure), hemolysis, edema, and increased vascular permeability (reviewed in [51,54]), some of which are
symptoms of platypus envenomation. The edema produced by stonefish envenomation is persistent (reviewed
in [55]), and it is thus possible that the platypus homologues are responsible for the persistent edema that is
characteristic of platypus envenomation. The fact that
B.30.2-domain-containing peptides have been found in
the venom of fish, reptiles, and putatively the platypus is
strong support for the hypothesis that certain protein
motifs have been independently selected for evolution to
venom function multiple times in different lineages.

Discussion
Our searches identified 88 putative platypus venom
genes, 83 of which have not been previously identified
(OvDLPs, OvNGF and OvCNPs, known to be expressed
in platypus venom, were also found in the transcriptome
data). It is now clear that the venom of the platypus
contains a diverse range of proteins, many of which may
be functional analogues of venom components of other
species, including reptiles, insectivores, fish, and even
invertebrates. Reptiles diverged from the vertebrate lineage 315 million years ago, and platypuses diverged from
the rest of the mammals 166 million years ago [5]. The
fact that these extremely divergent species share similar
venom components, some of which were found repeatedly in platypus and other venoms, suggests that there
are indeed protein motifs that are preferentially selected
for independent evolution to venom molecules in a
striking display of convergent evolution, and that many
animal venoms share some similarities in their mode of
action [27].
The retention of similar molecular scaffolds (with
respect to protein domains and domain order) has previously been shown to occur in different proteins in
snake venom [21,27,56], but this is the first time that it
has been observed across such divergent organisms,
including mammals, in a wide range of different molecules. It appears that in many cases the same molecular
scaffolds have been repeatedly selected for in the venom
of different species, with some variability in the coding
region, presumably to allow toxins with slightly different
activities to be derived from conserved templates
[27,57]. Perhaps these similarities are to be expected
when it is considered that there are only a limited number of ways that venoms can affect the homeostasis of
victims to either debilitate or kill them. It is interesting
to note these similarities when the assumed primary
function of, say, reptile venom is to kill prey and

Whittington et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R95
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/9/R95

possibly serve some digestive purpose, whilst platypus
venom appears to be used for intraspecific territory
defense. However, it must be noted that in many cases
there are significant variations between the sequences of
the putative platypus venom peptides and that of other
species, so it is possible that these variations represent
novel bioactivities. This feature of mutation of some
regions of the protein whilst maintaining the original
molecular scaffold is a key feature of the evolution of
snake venom toxins [58].
To our knowledge, this is the first sequencing of a
mammalian venom gland transcriptome. Although our
method of identifying mammalian venom genes based
on homology to previously identified toxin proteins
from unrelated species will miss completely novel
venom genes, there do appear to be common motifs in
venom peptides across widely divergent species
(reviewed in [27]), and so this represents the best
approach for venom gene identification at present. In
addition, the key feature of venom gene evolution by
duplication and diversification from genes encoding proteins involved in normal cellular processes [21] means
that rejecting a potential platypus venom gene on the
basis of homology with a non-venom gene is inappropriate. For this reason, we utilized transcriptome data from
additional non-venom tissues to filter our potential false
positives, which we then classed as non-venom and
excluded from our putative venom gene set.
In the future, emerging technologies such as improved
transcriptome assemblers and longer read lengths may
improve venom transcriptome sequencing projects by
reducing our reliance on gene prediction methods and
fragmented genome assemblies (in the case of platypus),
and also allowing comprehensive transcriptomic analysis
for venomous species that currently do not have a genome sequence. In addition, due to the seasonal nature
of platypus venom production [7], future studies may
focus on gene regulation within the venom gland as a
method to refine our current predictions. This will
allow the identification of those genes up-regulated during periods of high venom production, and will also
represent our best chance to identify completely novel
platypus venom genes with no homology to existing
toxins.

Conclusions
We have identified proteins encoded by genes expressed
in the platypus venom gland that have putative involvement in processes such as hemostasis, inflammatory
response, smooth muscle contraction, myonecrosis, vascular permeability and pain response. We have framed
these results with respect to the known symptoms of
platypus envenomation in order to gain some insight

into the basic biology of this unique mammalian trait.
After the completion of in vitro and in vivo assays to
validate these putative venom proteins, the toxins identified here will represent a potential source of novel molecules for biomedical research. Platypus venom is a
hitherto untapped resource in this respect, and this
work represents our first steps towards more fully characterizing the active constituents of platypus venom.

Materials and methods
Platypus tissue collection and RNA extraction

Tissue was obtained opportunistically from an adult
male platypus soon after death from a dog attack, and
frozen at -80°C for later use. The animal died during
the breeding season, and the venom glands appeared
very large (approximately 3 cm in diameter), indicating
that the gland was active at the time of death. Histological analysis confirmed this assessment. RNA was
extracted from one venom gland using TriReagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular
Research Centre Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). RNA samples were subjected to DNase digestion using standard
protocols (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Platypus venom gland cDNA synthesis

Two lots of venom gland cDNA were made, one using
SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase and one using AccuScript high fidelity reverse transcriptase, in a modified
SMART first-strand cDNA synthesis protocol as follows.
Reagent mix one (2.0 μl 12-μM 5′ Smart_Oligo (5′-AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCATCCGACGCrGrG rG-3′ ); 2.0
μl 12-μM 3′ Oligo_dT_SmartIIA (5′-AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCATCC GACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
TVN-3′); 2.0 μl Invitrogen 10-mM dNTP Mix (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA); 2.0 μl venom gland RNA; 2.0 μl
diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water was incubated
at 65°C for 5 minutes, and mixed with reagent mix two
(SuperScriptII protocol: 8.0 μl SuperScriptII 5 × Firststrand buffer (Invitrogen), 0.8 μl 100-mM dithiothreitol
(Invitrogen), 1.0 μl 10-mg/ml BSA (New England BioLabs,
Ipswich, MA, USA), 1.0 μl 40-U/μl RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), 15.2 μl DEPC-treated water, held at 45°C; AccuScript
protocol: 4.0 μl AccuScript 10 × RT Buffer (Stratagene,
Cedar Creek, TX, USA), 4.0 μl 100-mM dithiothreitol
(Stratagene), 1.0 μl 10-mg/ml BSA (New England BioLabs), 1.0 μl 40-U/μl RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), 16.0 μl
DEPC-treated water, 4.0 μl AccuScript HiFi RT (Stratagene), held at 45°C). The mixture was incubated in a thermocycler (45°C for 2 minutes (hot start); negative ramp:
go to 35°C in 1 minute; 35°C for 2 minutes, 45°C for 5 minutes; positive ramp: +15°C (until 60°C) at +0.1°C/s; 55°C
for 2 minutes; 60°C for 2 minutes; go to step 6 ten times)
and stored at -20°C until further use.

Library construction

Library construction used high fidelity DNA polymerase
and an OligodT method following the protocols used in
the platypus genome project [5]. One Illumina 36-bp
library and one 454 FLX library were made. Sequencing
of the 454 library produced 239,557 reads and sequencing of the Illumina library produced 19,069,168 reads
(610,213,376 nucleotides from 8 flow cells). Data are
available on NCBI Sequence Read Archive under the
following experiment accession numbers: Illumina data
[SRX026473]; 454 data [SRX000186].
Construction of an enhanced genebuild

Tox-Prot proteins were aligned to the platypus genome
using TBLASTN. All chains of high scoring segment
pairs (HSPs) with E-values < 10-5 were included in the
analysis. Chains in unannotated regions were added to
the Ensembl genebuild to create an enhanced genebuild.
Chains overlapping predicted Ensembl genes were not
included, and the genebuild was updated to include the
Tox-Prot match.
Analysis of 454 reads

454 reads were aligned to the platypus Ensembl transcripts (release 42) and to the Ensembl genome using
BLASTN (E-value < 10 -5 ). Transcripts were assigned
putative function by searching against InterPro domains
v.16 [59]. First, default parameters for InterProScan v.16
[60] were used to search against the InterPro database,
and second, transcripts were mapped to the three organizing principles of the GO [61]. Mappings are stored
by MySQL database, displayed using the Amigo browser,
and are available online [22]. In this way, 7,494 transcripts were mapped to 3,280 unique Interpro domains
and 5,913 sequences had GO annotation (the ontology
data released in April 2008 were used in this analysis).
For each GO term, its enrichment in the venom
expressed transcripts was measured over the complete
set of 24,763 cDNAs (from Ensembl v.42) as background using a hypergeometric test; the P-value cutoff
of 1.0e-5 was chosen for enrichment [62].
Analysis of Solexa data

Illumina reads were mapped to the platypus genome
(Ensembl release 49) using MAQ [63]. Reads with alignments overlapping genes in the enhanced genebuild
were assigned to those genes and read abundance levels
determined. Reads were also assembled using MAQ [63]
and contigs in unannotated regions were extracted for
further analysis.
GO annotation of putative venom peptide predictions

GO annotation of the putative venom peptide predictions was done using InterProScan v.4.5 and the

Page 10 of 13

resulting data parsed using a custom script. The peptides matched 51 GO categories; peptides could be
assigned more than one GO term and this resulted in
205 GO annotations in total.
Gene prediction

Gene predictions were carried out at areas of the genome
that were hit with Tox-Prot BLAST searches. Predictions
were carried out on entire contigs, and 10,000 bp each
side of hits to ultracontigs and chromosomes. If incomplete peptide predictions resulted from chromosomes
and ultracontigs, then sequence was taken up to 100,000
bp each side in an attempt to obtain the full prediction.
Predictions were carried out using GenomeScan [64],
with the Tox-Prot peptide as the template. The resulting
predictions were mapped to the genome on a gbrowse
platform [65]. If predictions overlapped with Ensembl
predictions, then the original peptide prediction was discarded and replaced with the Ensembl peptide, unless
454 FLX read data supported the GenomeScan prediction better. These peptide predictions that were not
Ensembl predictions were then used in a BLASTP search
of NCBI’s NR database (default values) to determine the
type of peptide encoded by each gene, and in some cases
subjected to a Conserved Domain search [66] where the
BLAST search was inconclusive (for example, where only
small regions of the gene were hit). As there was similarity between some gene predictions, this was checked and
redundant sequences removed (in general, this was due
to non-assembly of several short contigs into longer
genomic sequences). Sequences were put through a secondary screen to ensure that there was a hit from at least
one Tox-Prot HSP to an exon of the gene.
Validation of gene predictions

Screening then took place in order to eliminate any peptides found to be expressed in three or more nonvenom tissues. The remaining peptide sequences were
searched using TBLASTN (E = 0.0001) against the platypus EST database on NCBI (9,699 EST sequences
from fibroblast cell lines). Peptides were blasted against
the trimmed EST data from bill, brain, liver, spleen, and
testis that were generated for the platypus genome
(WUBLAST, TBLASTN, filter = seg, E = 0.0001) and
alignments were manually checked to confirm expression of these genes (such as close to 100% match and
spanning the entire read). Peptides were screened out if
they had hits to ESTs of three out of the six different
tissues. The exclusion of peptides expressed in the arbitrary value of three non-venom tissues, rather than
those expressed in any non-venom tissues, was chosen
because it has previously been shown that platypus
venom genes are expressed in non-venom tissues
[20,67]. This thus reduced the chance of excluding true

Whittington et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R95
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/9/R95

venom peptides from the analysis. However, those not
expressed in non-venom tissues, of which there are 33,
could possibly be considered as probable/likely venom
peptides; classification of these is shown in Table S1 in
Additional file 1, and is also mentioned throughout the
text.
All remaining predictions were checked by alignment
on the gbrowse platform to assess whether there were
454 FLX hits to these coding regions. Eighty-three peptides had support from either Illumina (≥ 10 reads) or
454 reads (≥ 1 read), and were taken as putative venom
peptides.

Page 11 of 13

cases, homologous animal toxins were also included in
these trees; homology was identified by blasting predictions against the Tox-Prot database (WUBLAST, E =
0.0001); homologous platypus Ensembl peptide predictions not found to be expressed in the venom gland
were also included. Due to the large degree of divergence between the members of many peptide groups,
and the fact that similarity in many cases extended only
over one or two peptide domains, sequence alignment
was difficult, as noted in the Supplementary Results of
Additional file 1.
Classification of proteases

Signal peptide analysis

The predicted peptides were run through SignalP [68],
using the parameters short output; truncation 70 amino
acid residues; model HMM. Nineteen of these had predicted signal peptides (classifications shown in Table S2
in Additional file 1); however, we do not believe that the
absence of a signal peptide in a putative platypus venom
toxin is grounds for exclusion from the category of
probable venom toxin. This is due to the fact that many
of these peptide predictions were truncated due to short
contig lengths (due to the fragmented nature of the platypus genome assembly), and so it is expected that a
higher percentage would have had detectable signal peptides if the full sequence were available.
Homology confirmation/classification into toxin
groupings

The subset of toxin peptides in the Tox-Prot database
extracted as above were assembled into a BLASTable
database. The peptide predictions were blasted against
the Tox-Prot database (WUBLAST, BLASTP, filter =
seg, E = 0.0001) to enable confirmation of toxin homology and also to allow the platypus venom peptides to be
sorted into venom categories. The protein domains of
some predictions were examined by BLASTing against
the NCBI Conserved Domain Database [66] using
default values.
Identification of homologous platypus genes

Predictions were used in BLAST searches against the
Ensembl v.56 platypus predicted peptides (WUBLAST,
BLASTP, wordmask = seg, word length 3, BLOSUM80
matrix, E = 10 -15 ; in cases where no hits were found
E = 10-5).
Phylogenetic tree construction

Trees were built from manually adjusted MUSCLE [69]
alignments of peptide sequences using MEGA 4.0 [70].
Trimming to include only conserved regions took place
where it is noted in figure legends. Neighbor-joining
trees using pairwise deletion were constructed. In some

Due to the complexity of protease classification, protease predictions were categorized using BLAST against
the MEROPS peptidase database [71].
