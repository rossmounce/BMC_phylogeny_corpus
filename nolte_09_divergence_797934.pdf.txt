Abstract
Background: The evolution of barriers to reproduction is of key interest to understand
speciation. However, there may be a current bias towards studying intrinsic postzygotic isolation
in old species pairs as compared to the emergence of barriers to gene flow through adaptive
divergence. This study evaluates the relative importance of both processes in the evolution of
genomic isolation in incipient species of whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) for which preliminary
data suggest that postzygotic isolation emerges with intrinsic factors acting at embryo stages but
also due to extrinsic factors during adult life.
Results: Gene expression data were screened using cDNA microarrays to identify regulatory
changes at embryo and juvenile stages that provide evidence for genomic divergence at the
underlying genetic factors. A comparison of different life history stages shows that 16-week old
juvenile fish have 14 times more genes displaying significant regulatory divergence than embryos.
Furthermore, regulatory changes in juvenile fish match patterns in adult fish suggesting that gene
expression divergence is established early in juvenile fish and persists throughout the adult phase.
Comparative analyses with results from previous studies on dwarf-normal species pairs show that
at least 26 genetic factors identified in juvenile fish are candidate traits for adaptive divergence in
adult fish. Eight of these show parallel directions of gene expression divergence independent of
tissue type or age of the fish. The latter are associated with energy metabolism, a complex trait
known to drive adaptive divergence in dwarf and normal whitefish.
Conclusion: Although experimental evidence suggests the existence of genetic factors that cause
intrinsic postzygotic isolation acting in embryos, the analysis presented here provided few
candidate genes in embryos, which also corroborate previous studies showing a lack of ecological
divergence between sympatric dwarf and normal whitefish at the larval stage. In contrast, gene
expression divergence in juveniles can be linked to adaptive traits and seems to be driven by
positive selection. The results support the idea that adaptive differentiation may be more important
in explaining the emergence of barriers to gene flow in an early phase of speciation by providing a
broad genomic basis for extrinsic postzygotic isolation rather than intrinsic barriers.

Background
The evolution of reproductive isolation is of fundamental
interest in evolutionary biology because it represents a key
step in speciation processes and the generation of biological diversity [1]. Merging of divergent lineages can be prevented by prezygotic barriers that reduce heterospecific
mating or by decreased offspring fitness (postzygotic isolation). Some of the most inclusive studies on postzygotic
isolation have focussed on taxa that have been separated
for millions of years. For instance, hybrids among species
of Drosophila are often completely sterile or inviable,
which can be explained by Dobzhansky-Müller incompatibilities [2,3]. Postzygotic isolation results from genetic
changes in the parental lineages that, while functional on
their normal genetic backgrounds, reduce the viability or
fertility when recombined in hybrids. Intrinsic postzygotic isolation is likely to manifest as soon as the respective factors are expressed, i.e. during early development
[1], whereas effects on reproductive traits are naturally
associated with the reproductive phase. Such intrinsic barriers to reproduction are thought to evolve slowly through
a stochastic accumulation of genetic incompatibilities [4].
However, when young species have split only recently,
extrinsic postzygotic isolation can also be effective
through a more subtle effect. Alleles that reduce the fitness
in a given genetic background can be removed by externally (e.g. ecological) caused natural selection. Here, heterospecific allele combinations are not lethal but perform
worse than pure parental genotypes in dependence of the
ecological context. Differentially adapted genes can be
instrumental to generate initial patterns of genetic divergence and are thought to govern the divergence and merging of young evolutionary lineages [5-7]. At least under
conditions of gene flow, speciation will be driven by natural selection imposed by external ecological factors
[5,8,9] and models generally agree that intrinsic hybrid
inviability is not an initial event that drives speciation [1].
There may be a bias in our perception of the contribution
of intrinsic and extrinsic postzygotic isolation to speciation processes. This is because it is usually more straightforward to analyse intrinsic barriers than to grasp extrinsic
barriers experimentally, since the latter will most likely
depend on unknown ecological interactions. Therefore,
traits that could provide a basis for genomic isolation in
young lineages remain insufficiently explored. A possible
approach is given by transcriptome analysis. Here, gene
expression data may help identifying key genes involved
in speciation since regulatory evolution is hypothesized to
be a key factor in microevolutionary processes [10-12].
Genes that are regulated differently are likely to loose
compatibility with the genetic environments of alternative lineages. Microarray approaches offer the potential to
study genome-wide patterns of divergence, and can be
considered as an inventory of characters that could serve

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/59

as a basis for genome divergence. Although this does not
provide evidence that selection acts on each of the particular genes under study, it will reveal the processes and
functions that may be affected.
In this study, we explore by means of transcriptomics the
regulatory divergence between incipient species of lake
whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis (Mitchill, 1818)) in
order to identify candidate traits that could contribute to
barriers to gene flow. This system is of particular interest
to study the emergence of postzygotic isolation as the
diverging lineages are of recent, most likely postglacial,
origin (15 000 ya) [13]. Dwarf and normal whitefish have
evolved multiple times in response to ecological selection
pressures [14] and genome scans and mapping projects
demonstrated that natural selection drives this divergence
in multiple genomic regions [15,16] while also suggesting
that the lineages are at a phase of speciation where gene
flow is still occurring. On the other hand, Rogers and Bernatchez [17] have found evidence for genetic factors causing postzygotic isolation in developing eggs. The actual
genes and functions involved in these processes are largely
unknown due to a use of anonymous genetic markers.
However, the application of transcriptome data offers a
promising approach to identify candidate genes. Microarrays made for salmon (Salmo salar, Onchorynchus mykiss)
can be readily used in whitefishes [18,19]. Derome et al.
[20,21] and St-Cyr et al. [22] have identified a suite of candidate adaptive traits that display parallel changes in gene
expression between adult dwarf and normal whitefish in
replicated lakes.
Here, we tie in with the above studies, which suggest than
both intrinsic and extrinsic barriers to reproduction play a
role in the divergence of dwarf and normal whitefish at
the embryo stage and during the adult life respectively.
Our main objective was to compare regulatory changes at
different life history stages to obtain an insight into the
processes that may contribute to genomic divergence. Our
results indicate that there is little regulatory divergence in
embryos in sharp contrast with evidence that numerous
genes display regulatory divergence in juvenile fish. Given
that the latter patterns can be partially linked to ecological
divergence, we conclude that extrinsic postzygotic barriers
may be more important to explain early evolutionary
divergence of dwarf and normal whitefish than intrinsic
barriers to reproduction.

Results
Number and types of genes analysed
The number of features (spotted EST clones) for which we
obtained gene expression data of sufficient quality for
subsequent analyses was 7004 for the embryos and 5787
for the juvenile dataset. This discrepancy is correlated with
technical aspects of the experiments. The number of spots

that were excluded because they had a bad quality flag
(obvious artefacts) after visual editing was 3209 in the
juvenile dataset vs. 1055 in the embryo dataset. Furthermore, the average background in the embryo experiments
was lower than in the juvenile experiments (744 vs. 849
relative fluorescence units). A total of 4293 features were
common to both datasets. Accordingly, the embryo data
contained 2711 and the juvenile data contained 1494
unique features. Those features of the whole embryo dataset that were associated with a GO term could be linked to
2034 unique unigene clusters and the features of the
whole juvenile dataset represented 1549 unique unigene
clusters.
The overall representation of gene functional groups
among the expressed features between the two datasets
differed significantly according to the ease score provided
by the EASE software. The juvenile fish dataset contained
a significant relative excess (ease score < 0.05) of unigene
clusters representing three GO-Biological processes:
Catabolism (55 genes, ease score = 0.004), lipid metabolism (26 genes, ease score = 0.011), proteolysis and peptidolysis (37 genes, ease score = 0.025). In contrast, the
embryo dataset contained an almost significant relative
excess of unigene clusters representing two GO-Biological
processes: Cell cycle (44 genes, ease score = 0.095) and
nucleobase\, nucleoside\, nucleotide and nucleic acid
metabolism (139 genes, ease score = 0.096). These trends
in the representation of genes in the two life history stages
reflect the importance of metabolism and growth processes in the juvenile stage while gene transcription regulation and development predominate in the embryos.
Genes displaying significant differences
After applying a FDR correction for multiple testing, only
33 EST clones showed significant differential expression
between the embryos of dwarf and normal whitefish [see
Additional file 1]. In contrast, a total of 502 EST clones
displayed significant differences in gene expression
between dwarf and normal whitefish in the juvenile fish
dataset. This difference in the proportion of EST clones
that display significant differentiation in gene expression
in the two datasets was highly significant (Fisher's Exact
test, p < 0.001). For the embryos, 350 out of the 7004 features tested would be expected to have false positive tests
according to our significance criterion (p < 0.05). However, the number of raw significant results in the embryo
analysis was 590 (8,4%). The corresponding number of
significant genes in the juvenile dataset was 988 (17%),
while 289 false positives would be expected. This indicates for both datasets that the number of significant tests
is not explainable by the expected false positive rate. The
true number of genes with differential patterns of expression was higher than the list obtained after the FDR procedure, but the trend that there was much more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/59

differentiation in the juvenile compared to the embryonic
stage remains independent of the FDR procedure.
For comparisons between datasets, EST clones were
assigned to EST clone groups based on; i) unigene cluster
or accession numbers (latest annotation following
cGRASP) unless there was no known function, and ii)
unique patterns of gene expression divergence. In doing
this, significant patterns were integrated over replicate
clones and overrepresentation of different genes by multiple clones was corrected. Among the features displaying
significant differentiation in the embryo dataset, 20 can
be assigned to one of twelve unigene clusters. Eleven out
of the twelve unigene clusters that display significant differentiation in the embryo dataset also appear in the list
of significant unigene clusters of the juvenile dataset [see
Additional file 1]. A total of 191 of the significant EST
clones of the juvenile fish dataset were assigned to one of
127 unigene clusters. Accounting for the different numbers of unigene clusters that were represented by the raw
data in the egg (2034) and juvenile (1549) datasets, this
indicates that roughly fourteen times more genes as represented by distinct unigene clusters display overall significant differentiation in the juvenile fish than in the
embryos.
Comparisons with results from previous studies on adult
fish
Some of the EST clones displaying significant divergence
of gene expression in the analyses presented above have
already been demonstrated to display differential expression in dwarf and normal whitefish. Only one EST clone
for which significant differentiation was detected in the
embryo dataset (CA057378; Accession AY872256; Oncorhynchus mykiss IgH.A locus) was previously found to be
differentially expressed in white muscle between laboratory dwarf and normal whitefish [21]. In contrast, 108 EST
clones that can be assigned to 44 different EST clone
groups (identical accessions and unique patterns of
expression) identified in whole juvenile fish [see Additional file 2] also show significant differentiation in gene
expression in white muscle of adult fish of the same dwarf
and normal strains in a controlled common environment
[21]. Although different tissues and life history stages were
compared, there was a significant excess of 31 out of 44
EST clone groups (Fishers' test, p = 0.0403) where gene
expression divergence between dwarf and normal whitefish was congruent in the pattern of up or down regulation
in dwarfs relative to normals [see Additional file 2] as
compared to a random distribution of changes in both
directions. Likewise, a comparison of the set of EST clones
displaying significant gene expression divergence in juvenile fish reveals matches with candidate features that have
been identified in independent natural lakes [20,22]. It
should be noted that the study by Derome et al. [20] used

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:59

a less inclusive microarray containing five times less features, which reduces the relative power of that study to
identify genes that were found here or by St-Cyr et al. [22].
A total of 96 EST clones that displayed significant divergence in whole juvenile dwarf and normal whitefish of the
strains studied here could be matched with EST clones displaying parallel adaptive divergence in gene expression in
liver or white muscle of adult dwarf and normal whitefish
from Cliff Lake (Maine, USA) and Indian Pond (Maine,
USA) [see Additional file 3]. Ten out of 26 different EST
clone groups (grouped as described above.) show regulatory changes in the controlled environment that were congruent with the patterns of candidate adaptive traits as
observed in adult tissues in natural lakes. Among these,
there appears to be a bias in that eight of ten affected genes
are related to energy metabolism, which shows that regulatory changes between dwarf and normal whitefish
related to this function are more constant across different
environments, life history stages and tissues than those
related to other functions [see Additional file 3].
In contrast to the observations for juvenile and adult fish
of the experimental strains in controlled common environment [see Additional file 2], the direction of upregulation vs. downregulation of the transcript level of dwarf
whitefish relative to normal whitefish shows less congruence when samples from natural environments and a new
tissue (liver) are included in the comparison. Thus, 16 out
of 26 groups of features that display significant divergence
of gene expression in candidate adaptive features differ in
the direction of the change between juveniles and adults
(16) or between adult muscle and liver tissue (3) [see
Additional file 3].

Discussion
Our results revealed a pronounced pattern of gene expression divergence for 502 EST clones between 16-week old
juvenile dwarf and normal lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis complex) as compared to embryos of the same experimental groups, which displayed little divergence in gene
expression (33 EST clones). Although the number of evolutionary changes causing the observed differences is currently unknown, a fourteen-fold excess of unigene clusters
displaying significant differentiation in the juvenile dataset
suggests that multiple regulatory changes take effect only
after development has passed the embryo stage. If gene
expression divergence were the result of random accumulation of evolutionary differences between the studied populations, roughly equal proportions of gene expression
differences would be expected to occur in both life history
stages. The much more likely scenario is that evolutionary
change in gene expression plays a greater role at the juvenile
stages than the embryonic stage.
The general pattern observed for gene expression divergence and regulatory changes resembles the ontogeny of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/59

morphological features across the animal kingdom.
Briefly, early developmental stages are usually extremely
well conserved, whereas adult phenotypes vary as a consequence of evolutionary divergence, a classical observation
made by early developmental biologists [23,24]. This
observation has often been made for distantly related
taxa. This study suggests that the same evolutionary pattern may not only apply to morphological characters, but
also to transcriptomic divergence at the level of recently
evolved lineages of fish. Below, the observed changes in
gene expression are discussed in relation to life history
divergence of dwarf and normal whitefish. We propose
that the excess of gene expression divergence in juvenile
fish relative to embryos can be attributed to selective pressures that are related to ecological adaptation in the juvenile and the adult phase rather than an evolutionary
constraint on divergence in embryonic stages.
A key concern in the analyses was that the absence of differentiation observed in the embryos could represent an
artefact. Developmental processes and therefore gene
expression in embryos can be expected to change rapidly
throughout ontogeny. The problem such heterogeneity in
gene expression imposes for the analysis resembles that of
allometry in studies of body shape [25] and the relevance
of heterogeneity for the analysis of gene expression data
has recently been pointed out by Leek and Storey [26]. If
different stages with accordingly changed patterns of gene
expression were sampled, the variance in gene expression
would be inflated. Intra group variance could then exceed
the between group variance to a point where the latter is
not detected as significant in ANOVA based statistical
approaches. The extent to which such variation occurs in
the transcriptome can be inferred from a study by Arbeitman et al. [27] who performed a very complete analysis of
patterns of gene expression throughout development of
Drosophila melanogaster and found that significant heterogeneity was observed for 52% of all studied genes during
the embryogenesis but few genes displaying developmental heterogeneity in adult Drosophila. Moreover, some
classes of genes that are expressed during the segmentation phase of fishes show highly dynamic and cyclical patterns of expression through short periods of time [28].
The sampling of a relatively well-defined segmentation
stage as done in this study is merely a snap-shot of the
whole embryogenesis and should therefore contain considerably more genes with relatively constant expression
patterns that are consequently useful for ANOVA. Accordingly, the inter sample variance in gene expression for eggs
and juveniles was in the same order of magnitude (mean
inter-sample variance 0.0085 and 0.0066 respectively) as
estimated from a more inclusive dataset of the same stages
including technical replication (Renaut et al. unpublished). Even if only half of all genes (comp. above; [27])
in the embryo dataset displayed homogeneous gene
expression, one would still expect to detect considerably

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:59

more significant genes if the proportion of significant
genes in the embryo data was identical to that in the juvenile data. Although an effect of developmental heterogeneity cannot be excluded, it is unlikely to explain the
observed excess in gene expression divergence in the juveniles.
The ontogeny and evolution of gene expression
differentiation
Dwarf whitefish from Lake Témiscouata and normal
whitefish from Lake Aylmer studied here have a similar
reproductive biology. Adult fish live in the lake throughout the year and enter tributaries only for a brief spawning
period. Spawning migrations are short and occur on a
daily basis at night from late October to early November.
Eggs are dispersed in currents and settle into rock and
gravel substrates where they are left unattended to
develop. Ninety-one percent of the unigene clusters that
displayed significant regulatory divergence in the embryos
were also significantly divergent in juvenile fish and in
one case, found to be differentially expressed in white
muscle tissue of adults of the same laboratory strains used
here. However, none of the significantly different genes of
the embryo stage was found to be a candidate for adaptive
divergence in previous studies. The fact that ecological
divergence of the egg stages of whitefishes has not been
discovered to date together with the relative lack of gene
expression differentiation suggests strongly that little or
no adaptive evolutionary divergence has occurred specifically at the embryo stage and that most of the gene expression differentiation between dwarf and normal whitefish
must develop at a later phase of the ontogeny.

Upon hatching whitefish larvae are washed from their
natal river into the lakes were they spent their entire life.
To date it is unknown at which phase of the life history the
ecological differentiation into the dwarf (limnetic) and
normal (benthic) lifestyles occurs in nature. In a study of
dwarf and normal whitefish in Cliff Lake, larvae of dwarf
and normal populations did not differ in their hatching
time, diet, distribution and vertical migration within the
lake [29]. Unlike their parents, the larvae lived in total
syntopy and there was no evidence for differential trophic
ecology or circadian vertical migration, suggesting that
ecological divergence of the two forms must begin after
the larval stage [29]. The experimental populations used
in this study had a total age of 16 weeks and had morphologically transformed into juvenile fish (development of
finrays and scales) for approximately 8 weeks before sampling was done. At the level of the transcriptome, the
transformation into the juvenile stage is accompanied by
an emergence of gene expression divergence between the
two forms that was absent at the embryo stage. Also, gene
expression divergence at this juvenile stage could be
matched with patterns observed in adult fish. 108 EST

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/59

clones representing 44 differentially regulated genes or
accessions [see Additional file 2] also displayed regulatory
divergence in muscle tissue of adult fish belonging to the
same experimental groups and kept in a controlled common environment [21]. There was a significant excess of
congruent regulatory change, which suggests that gene
expression divergence between dwarf and normal whitefish is of a similar nature in juvenile and adults. The
notion that regulatory divergence does not change much
after the development of the adult morphology has finished is in line with the observation that many patterns of
gene expression change little throughout adult life in Drosophila [27]. Hence, the juvenile stage studied here is useful to study the transition of life histories from nondifferentiated larval fish [29] to adult dwarf and normal
whitefish with pronounced differential adaptation [13].
A total of 96 of the EST clones identified here matched
with 26 accessions or genes that were also described by
Derome et al. [20] and St-Cyr et al. [22] [see Additional file
3] who found a recurrent association of divergence in gene
expression and parallel adaptive differentiation in multiple lakes (including Cliff lake) for these genes. Briefly,
dwarf whitefish tend to have a shorter lifespan and begin
to reproduce earlier than normal whitefish. They are specifically adapted to the open water where they specialise
on a zooplankton diet as opposed to the more benthic
lifestyle of normal whitefish [13]. According to Trudel et
al. [30] this ecological differentiation is driven by differences in metabolic rate and energy allocation between
dwarf and normal whitefish. Derome et al. [20] and St-Cyr
et al. [22] have inferred candidate adaptive traits bases on
patterns of parallel divergence in independent lake systems each containing dwarf and normal whitefish. In
agreement with the experimental results of Trudel et al.
[30], the biological function of a part of these candidates
implies a role in energy metabolism. Our results on the
gene expression divergence between juvenile dwarf and
normal whitefish has revealed ten out of 26 genes which
match adaptive regulatory changes in the adult stage irrespective of the fact that different tissues were used. Most
conspicuously, eight of these ten genes can be associated
with energy metabolism. The comparison of different
studies reveals a recurrent pattern of up regulation of transcripts for Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, Beta-enolase and
Trypsin-1 precursor as well as a down regulation of transcripts for a mitochondrial precursor of Cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide VIa, Nucleoside diphosphate kinase and
Nucleoside diphosphate kinase A in dwarf relative to normal whitefish [see Additional file 3] in different tissues
and life history stages. This adds evidence for the hypothesis that energy metabolism as a complex trait plays an
ubiquitous role in driving the adaptive divergence
between dwarf and normal whitefish while other candi-

date adaptive traits play more tissue and context specific
roles.
The results obtained here for juvenile fish and the comparison of the direction of the regulatory changes in different tissues or the controlled common environment vs.
natural lakes shows that regulatory changes at candidate
adaptive traits are not always congruent in terms of the
direction of the change. It must be emphasized though,
that the inference of adaptive divergence from parallel regulatory changes relies on the use of comparable samples.
If tissue type and environmental context vary, the regulatory response can be expected to vary as well. Accordingly,
there was more agreement in the direction of the regulatory changes when comparison based on liver tissue or
natural environments were excluded [see Additional file
2]. This implies that the inference of an adaptive value of
parallel divergent traits by Derome et al. [20] and St-Cyr et
al. [22] is not invalidated by contrasting patterns of regulatory divergence for a given candidate gene in juvenile
fish and vice versa. Although the relationship of the direction of regulatory change according to tissue context, age
and environmental factors needs to be addressed in future
studies, the fact remains that many candidate genes for
adaptive divergence in adult fish also show regulatory differentiation at the juvenile stage. In contrast to the
embryo stage analysed here, these results suggest that the
divergence in gene expression in juvenile fish is subject to
directional selection related to adaptive divergence.
The identification of candidate adaptive gene expression
divergence still draws an incomplete picture of the processes that ultimately lead to the life history differentiation
into dwarf and normal whitefish. If adaptive differences at
the transcriptome level are expressed as early as young (16
weeks) juvenile stage, then it is likely that these genetic
factors may initiate the development of life history divergence. Although data on juvenile fish from natural lakes
are missing, inferences can be made from our laboratory
populations. Experimental fish were kept in a controlled
common environment and the candidate adaptive traits
remain prevalent at the transcriptome level suggesting
that juvenile fish already display differential adaptation.
On the other hand, the phenotypes of our experimental
populations bred in the laboratory seem to contradict a
persistent ecophenotypic differentiation between dwarf
and normal whitefish. Although morphological features
distinguishing dwarf and normal ecotypes are heritable
[16], the differentiation of life histories under laboratory
conditions is less pronounced than in nature. Dwarf
whitefish remain only slightly smaller than normal whitefish and grow older than their natural counterparts
(unpublished observation). This strongly suggests that
there is an environmental component that interacts with
a genetic one to shape the ecophenotypic differentiation
of dwarf and normal whitefish.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/59

A potential role for stabilizing selection
Aside directional selection driving divergence at the juvenile and adult stages, an alternative explanation for the
relative lack of embryo gene expression may be derived
from developmental biology. The embryos during the segmentation phase that were studied here correspond
closely to the phylotypic stage, a developmental phase
that corresponds to an archetype bauplan of all representatives of a given phylum. This stage is generally extremely
conserved [31] suggesting that strong evolutionary constraints prevent divergence. While the morphological conservation of phylotypic stage embryos remains
undisputed, it has been found that patterns of gene
expression need not be constrained. Selection on adult
genotypes may alter gene regulation in embryos [32] and
developmental system drift [33], a process whereby gene
regulatory networks evolve without changing the expression level of a gene, have been demonstrated for even
closely related taxa [34]. This casts doubt on the validity
of the phylotypic stage concept at the transcriptome level
[34]. Given these alternatives, the similarity between
embryos of dwarf and normal whitefish could imply the
action of strong evolutionary constraints that preserve
identical patterns of gene expression relative to what we
observed at the juvenile stage. Under an evolutionary constraints hypothesis, genes that determine the expression
level of a transcript may still evolve as long as the sum of
their effects would not be changed. F1 – hybrids or segregating backcrosses would prove useful to reveal such cryptic regulatory divergence. They would combine the altered
regulatory elements into a common genetic background,
which can result in misexpression of genes [35-37]. Very
much in line with this, crossing experiments by Lu and
Bernatchez [38] and Rogers and Bernatchez [17] suggest
that F1 hybrids or backcrosses of the same populations
studied here suffer from raised embryonic mortality in the
same stage studied here. This would indicate the presence
of alleles or genes that malfunction and should manifest
as misexpression at the transcriptome level (Renaut et al.
in prep). In any case, the scarcity of regulatory divergence
observed here for the embryo stage suggests that regulatory divergence is rare and may have a narrow genomic
basis involving only a small number of genetic factors.
This view would agree with the fact Rogers and Bernatchez
[16] have only found a limited number of QTL associated
with hybrid embryo mortality in their mapping analysis.
Implications for the emergence of genomic isolation and
speciation in whitefish
At the level of the transcriptome, only traits causing regulatory divergence produce a phenotype that differs
between two diverging lineages. These could be affected
by natural selection and are therefore candidate traits that
may reduce the fitness of individuals of mixed ancestry.
Thus, a screen for regulatory divergence can identify traits
that could have fitness effects under conditions of gene

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:59

flow and serve as a genetic basis for the emergence of
genomic isolation. Models suggest that recombination
can oppose genomic divergence and speciation because
loci that are not selected for may still be exchanged relatively freely among populations [5,39]. Even if single
genetic factors have a strong isolating effect, they may not
be sufficient to reduce gene flow throughout the genome
if hybrids are partially viable, as it is the case in Coregonus
[17,38]. It is therefore evident that the more loci are divergent between two lineages, the easier it becomes to
explain how these could, as a whole, provide a basis for
evolutionary divergence and reproductive isolation. Few
transcripts are regulated differently at the embryonic stage
analysed here, which points towards a comparably small
number of genes that may be differentially regulated
between dwarf and normal whitefish embryos, at least relative to later stages. Although Rogers et al. [17] provided
evidence for the presence of genetic factors causing considerable hybrid embryo mortality, it may be concluded
that the regulatory changes that could cause postzygotic
isolation at the embryo stage are comparably rare. Admittedly, the question to which degree this would be sufficient to prevent gene flow in nature cannot be answered at
present. In any case, it would be easier to explain a reduction in gene flow if there was a broad genomic basis to
reproductive isolation, i.e. effects of multiple traits that
could be selected for, rather than few. Our results suggest
strongly that the largest part of regulatory divergence
occurs throughout the juvenile and adult phases. A pattern of more pronounced divergence in juvenile and adult
fish corresponds well with what has been observed in
studies on interspecific regulatory divergence [35]. Moreover, a suite of traits contributing to a diversified adult
phenotype is expected to play a more important role in
evolutionary divergence as compared to genes producing
the conserved phylotypic stage phenotype [40].
A gap in the sampling of potentially relevant life history
stages of this study is that the reproductive phase could
not be analysed here. Studies on Drosophila [36] and Mus
[41] have demonstrated an above average rate of regulatory divergence in genes associated with reproduction and
in addition, have shown that these genes may be among
the first to cause reproductive isolation. Future studies will
have to show whether reproductive characters may play
the same crucial role in evolutionary divergence of incipient species of fish or if ecologically selected traits are
among the first to cause genomic isolation.

Conclusion
If the relative rarity of gene expression divergence in
embryo stages was a general pattern in recently diverged
species, then a focus on embryo dysgenesis in studies of
the early evolution of postzygotic isolation could be misleading in that they would distract from a large pool of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/59

adult characters. While tests for embryonic mortality are
straightforward, it is much more difficult to test the role of
particular genes on complex adult phenotypes as those
may have small effects [42] or their effects may depend on
unknown environmental components. Still, the transcriptomic patterns in whitefish suggest that a full understanding of how gene flow is reduced among incipient species
may depend more heavily on genes affecting adult phenotypes than developmental phenotypes. In agreement with
this, van der Sluijs et al. [43] suggest, for closely related
cichlids from Lake Victoria, that postzygotic reproductive
isolation is mediated by extrinsic selection rather than
intrinsic hybrid dysgenesis. Furthermore, studies across a
broader phylogenetic range of taxa show that intrinsic
genomic incompatibility evolves slowly and after the
point of speciation between diverging species [44,45].
Our results together with these studies support the view
that subtle selective pressures and ecological interactions
that are related to specific complex environments may be
the key in explaining incipient genomic divergence
[5,43,45].

Methods
Strains, crosses and fish maintenance
Eggs of Coregonus clupeaformis were obtained from lab
strains kept at the LARSA (Laboratoire de Recherche en
Sciences Aquatiques, Université Laval) or harvested from
wild fish that were caught on their natural spawning
grounds. Normal whitefish used here originate from Lake
Aylmer (Basin of the St. Lawrence River, southern Quebec) and were sampled at the spawning site in the St. Francois River in Disraeli (45° 54'N, 71° 20'W) in 1996 (as
detailed in Lu and Bernatchez, 1998). Since then, they
were kept in the laboratory as an outbred lab strain. Dwarf
whitefish originate from Lake Témiscouata (St. Johns'
river system in southern Quebec) and were caught on
their spawning grounds in the Touladi River (47° 41'N,
68° 47'W). Like the normal whitefish, dwarfs were maintained as an outbred laboratory strain. We also included
new wild caught material from Lake Témiscouata dwarf
whitefish collected in October 2006.

Eggs and semen were stripped from deafened fish, fertilized in vitro and incubated on grids that were submerged
in slowly flowing water of a temperature of 4,5–5,5°C. All
egg batches were incubated in the same flow through system and were thus subjected to compartments of the same
environment. Weekly treatments with malachite green
oxalate were performed to inhibit growth of fungi. Morbid eggs or embryos were removed on a daily basis. After
hatching, free-swimming larvae were transferred into
aquaria (50 × 25 × 30 cm) and fed ad libitum with Artemia
nauplii and complemented with commercial fish food
(Epac CW 4/6, Epac CW 6/8; INVE AQUACULTURE Inc.,
Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.). All aquaria were aerated and

connected by a flow through and filtering system that fed
each aquarium from a common pool. This permitted constant water exchange and near identical temperature and
chemical conditions. The temperature in the rearing tanks
was kept at 8°C for the first 8 weeks, raised to 10°C for 3
weeks and finally adjusted to 12°C.
To capture the within population variance in gene expression and reduce family specific effects, we generally used
crosses that were composed of several parents depending
on the availability of mature fish at a given time. We have
created two independent experimental groups for each
biological group (dwarf, normal) studied here. The group
DD-E was derived from the lab strain of the dwarf whitefish from Lake Témiscouata and was created using one
female and five different males. DD-G was created by
crossing wild caught dwarf whitefish (leg. Nolte, Renaut
and Bernatchez, 25th Oct. 2006) from the same lake using
multiple females and multiple males. Two groups of normal whitefish (NN-C and NN-I) were created from one
and five as well as two and three females and males of the
lab strain of normal whitefish from Lake Aylmer, respectively.
Stages and samples
It was our goal to analyse gene expression in a developmental stage corresponding to the phase for which Lu and
Bernatchez [38] and Rogers and Bernatchez [17] observed
increased embryo mortalities. We found that this corresponds to the beginning of the segmentation period. In
this phase of development, an anterior-posterior axis has
developed and undergoes divisions into body segments
(for a detailed account on phases of fish development see
[46]). Progress of development in this phase can be evaluated by counting body segments, which are added successively. This task can be performed on live eggs with the
help of a binocular. Due to slight batch-to-batch variation
in the precise timing of the segmentation process, we
assessed developmental stages of embryos entirely by
morphological features, rather than age. In our experiments, the process of segmentation began after roughly 16
days of development and ended after 29–31 days.
Embryos were examined once or twice daily, from the
moment that the tail bud of the embryo detached from
the yolk sac (at day 20–22). It was easier to count only
those segments in the part of the tail that was detached
rather than all segments of the live embryo within the
intact eggs. For our experiments we chose embryos that
had formed approximately 20 segments in the detached
portion of their tail. This stage appeared to be relatively
easy to identify as at the same time the tail started moving
and bent to an angle of approximately 30° (tail curvature). Furthermore, in this stage the optic primordium
begins to hollow thus initiating the formation of the lens
in the eye. This developmental stage corresponds best

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/59

with the 20–25 somite stage observed in Danio rerio after
only 19 hours of development at 28.5°C (compare http:/
/zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/stages.html) [46]. Eggs
that were chosen for experiments were individually examined using binoculars. Only apparently viable eggs with
well-formed embryos were used. In these, the number of
segments was counted through the chorion. This introduces some uncertainty in the somite count but preserves
intact eggs and embryos for RNA extraction. Whole eggs
were preserved in RNA later (Ambion) and frozen at 20°C for storage.
Juvenile fish were chosen as the next sampling stage as
these represent an immature adult phenotype. All hatched
larvae were transferred to basins and started external feeding in mid January 2007. The larvae had developed fin
rays by the end of January 2007. We sampled juvenile fish
at an age of approximately 16 weeks (May 10th 2007),
when these attained a weight of approximately 800 mg
(540–1190 mg). At this stage, the development of morphological features is finished and the young whitefish
resemble their parents. Individuals chosen for gene
expression analysis were well developed and in good general shape (vs. slow growing and meagre, as observed in
some specimens). Sampling was done in the morning following an 18 hour fast. Fish were then sacrificed with a
blow, kept on ice and homogenized in TRIzol reagent for
RNA extraction as quickly as possible (waiting time no
longer than 20 min). The homogenate was stored at 80°C prior to RNA extraction.
Experimental design and choice of samples
The gene expression analysis for this study focuses on the
divergence at different life history stages of dwarf and normal whitefish. Eight pairwise (dwarf vs. normal) comparisons for both the embryonic and the juvenile fish stage
were performed resulting in two sets of eight microarrays
per stage (see Table 1). Initial testing had shown that even
the more sensitive Gene Array 350 Kit (see below) ideally
requires 5 μg of total RNA per sample and experiment.
Given that only 2,5 – 3 μg of total RNA could be extracted
from a single embryo, pools containing the total RNA of
five embryos were used for the embryo experiments. This
pooling approach integrates patterns of gene expression
over a larger number of individuals but would nevertheless reveal differences between group means as tested for
in an analysis of variance. Juvenile fish extractions yielded
large quantities of total RNA and were used individually.

The same representation of experimental groups was used
in both the embryo and juvenile fish experiments. Thus
four replicates used samples from the groups DD-E and
NN-C (see Table 1). Tests for differentiation among
groups require that there is a homogeneous distribution
of traits within groups. However, transitory developmen-

Analysis of gene expression was performed pair wise for a set of embryo experiments (1–8) using pools of 5 eggs while single juveniles were used
in experiments 9–16. Staging of embryos and juveniles is assessed by key developmental parameters as described in the text. For embryos the
number of somites in the part of the tail that is detached from the yolk as well the observed tail curvature is given. The number of somites is an
approximation as it was determined in vivo. For juvenile fishes we provide the total body weight in gram.

tal stages, by their very nature, change constantly which
may introduce biases when the sampling is not balanced.
In order to reduce artefacts a set of samples that are similar
with respect to developmental features (segment count)
was chosen (Table 1). The sampling of juvenile fish is less
difficult as they have finished their morphogenesis. Their
ontogeny is also slower and probably reduced to relatively
constant growth processes. Juvenile fishes were chosen to
represent a similar body mass range (Table 1).
Analysis of gene expression
Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the vendor. For the
embryo experiments, five whole embryos preserved in

RNAlater were homogenized using a bead mill (Quiagen)
while for the juvenile fish experiments a single whole
juvenile fish was homogenized using a polytron homogenizer. Crude total RNA was further cleaned by ultra filtration using microcon (Millipore) spin columns (embryo
experiments) or a combination of a lithium chloride precipitation (addition of 1 Volume 5 M LiCl, incubation at
-20°C for 2 hours, centrifugation at 16.000 g at 4°C for 30
min, final wash of the resulting pellet in 70% ethanol)
and subsequent ultra filtration (juvenile fish experiments). Total RNA was quantified and quality checked
using the Experion™ RNA StdSens Analysis Kit (BIO RAD).
Total RNA was stored in pure water supplemented with
Superase-In™ RNase Inhibitor (Ambion) at -80°C.

Gene expression analysis was performed using the 16 K
v2.0 Salmon cDNA microarray as provided by the cGRASP
consortium (von Schalburg et al. 2005). This microarray
comprises 16 006 different cDNA features derived from
salmonids as well as control spots that have previously
been demonstrated to be useful to analyse gene expression in whitefish [20-22]. In each experiment, two different RNA samples are transcribed into strands of cDNA
that are end-labelled with a specific oligonucleotide
sequence. Samples are co hybridised to the microarray
and the relative quantity of the hybridised product is
assessed via fluorescent detection reagents that are specific
to the end labels of a given sample. These experiments
were made using the Genisphere 3DNA Array Detection
Array 350™ Kit (Cy3/Alexa647) and Genisphere 3DNA
Array Detection Array 50™ Kit (Cy3/Cy5) for the embryos
and juveniles respectively and followed the protocols of
the vendor. Dyes were swapped between different pairwise comparisons. Per sample and slide, we have used
approximately 4–5 μg of total RNA in the embryo experiments and 18–20 μg of total RNA in the juvenile fish
experiments. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the Superscript II Kit (Invitrogen).
Microarrays were scanned using a ScanArrayTM Express
scanner (Packard Bioscience) and quantified using the
Quantarray software. The positioning of all grids was
checked manually for both dye channels. Suspicious spots
of inconsistent shape or obvious artefacts were marked
with a bad quality flag. Raw data were quantified using the
histogram method and exported into text files. Microarray
data are deposited at ArrayExpress, a public repository,
under the following experiment accession number
(ArrayExpress accession: E-MEXP-1973). Input for the statistical analyses was generated from separate text files
using a Perl script. For each spot, local background was
subtracted from the PMT value. Data were subsequently
used in the statistical analyses only if there was no more
than 12,5% missing or unusable data per gene (e.g. a single value in a series of eight pairwise comparisons). Here,
unusable may mean: i) a bad quality flag or ii) a gene
expression value that is lower than the average background + 2 times its standard deviation for both samples
measured on a given spot. The average background was
determined from 800 empty spots or blank wells on the
16 K salmon chip, provided that these spots were not
excluded due to artefacts after visual inspection. Statistical
analysis of the data was performed in R version 2.6.1 (The
R Foundation for Statistical Computing Copyright (C)
2007 ISBN 3-900051-07-0) using the R package R/
maanova Version 1.4.1 [47,48]. Raw data was imported
and missing data were imputed (KNN method, 10 nearest
neighbours). Data was log2 transformed and normalized
using the lowess algorithm. An ANOVA model including
the following terms as fixed sources of variance: Type
(population, the term of interest), Dye (Fluorescent dye)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/59

and Sample (biological sample) while Array (individual
microarray) was included as random term. Statistical testing for divergence in gene expression between groups is
based on an F test (Fs test option in R/maanova). P-values
were determined by comparing observed values to a distribution obtained by randomly shuffling values of samples (1000 permutations). The FDR procedure as
implemented in R/maanova was used to correct for multiple testing using an FDR cut off value of 5%.
The populations studied here have previously served to
study gene expression divergence at the adult stage
between specific tissues of dwarf and normal whitefish
using a similar ANOVA. EST clones or genes for which significant differentiation was found in this study were compared with lists of candidate genes from studies on white
muscle and liver tissue [20-22]. This comparison was
based on EST clone ID numbers for comparisons with the
studies that used the same microarray [21,22]. Derome et
al. [20] used an earlier and less inclusive salmon microarray. In order to match results with the current dataset, EST
clone sequences of candidate genes described by Derome
et al. [20] were compared to all features on the 16 K v2.0
Salmon cDNA microarray using the BLAST algorithm [49]
as implemented in BioEdit [50]. All sequences could be
unequivocally matched to features on the new arrays
based on the longest 100% identical sequence. The annotation of all features reported here follows the latest version of the gene annotation file for the 16 K Salmon
microarray (as of Feb 13th 2008) provided on the cGRASP
homepage
http://web.uvic.ca/grasp/microarray/
array.html. Analyses of the representation of functional
categories of genes among datasets was based on the
DAVID/EASE programs http://david.niaid.nih.gov/david/

Regulatory changes between juvenile dwarf and normal whitefish in
a common environment. Similarity of regulatory changes between dwarf
and normal whitefish at different life history stages in controlled common
environments. All comparisons are based on the same strains (Lake Témiscouata "dwarf" and Lake Aylmer "normal" respectively). 108 EST clones
that display significant differentiation in gene expression in whole juvenile
fish (this study) were previously found to be differentially expressed in
muscle tissue from adult fish [21]. When genes are represented by several
EST clones these are grouped according to their annotation (accession
number and gene name) and patterns of gene expression. "up" or "down"
regulation describes the direction of the change of gene expression in the
dwarf whitefish relative to normal whitefish. Biological functions are as
given in Derome et al. [21]. EM = energetic metabolism; IR = immune
response; OB = oxygen binding; OF = other function; PS = protein synthesis; RPD = reproduction; MCR = muscle contraction regulation; PM =
protein metabolism. Despite the fact that different tissues were used, 31
out of 45 genes show congruent directions of significant regulatory
changes in juvenile and adult fish (last column), which points towards
ubiquitous patterns of expression divergence at juvenile and adult stages
in a common laboratory environment.

Regulatory changes between juvenile dwarf and normal whitefish at
candidate adaptive traits. Comparison of significant regulatory changes
between juvenile dwarf and normal whitefish with patterns observed at
candidate adaptive traits. Derome et al. [20] and St-Cyr et al. [22] analysed gene expression in white muscle and liver tissue of adult fish from
species pairs in natural lakes (dwarfs and normals from Cliff Lake and
Indian Pond) and identified candidate adaptive traits based on patterns
of parallel divergence. 96 EST clones that match candidate adaptive traits
displayed significant patterns of divergence in whole juvenile dwarf and
normal whitefish in this study (Lake Témiscouata "dwarf" and Lake
Aylmer "normal" respectively). Column contents correspond with Additional file 2 [see Additional file 2], with an additional column describing
regulatory changes found by St-Cyr et al. [22] for adult fish liver tissue
and the following additional biological functions as described in St-Cyr et
al. [22]: DT = detoxification; LM = lipid metabolism; BT = blood and
transport; GLF = germ-line formation; PD = Protein degradation. A
minus (-) indicates that gene expression divergence was not tested or
detected in the corresponding adult tissue. Ten out of 26 genes clones show
regulatory changes in the controlled environment that are congruent with
the patterns observed in candidate adaptive traits in independent dwarf
normal pairs in natural lakes. Eight of these ten genes are related to energy
metabolism, which shows that regulatory changes between dwarf and normal whitefish related to this function are more constant across different
environments, tissues and life history stages than those related to other
functions.
