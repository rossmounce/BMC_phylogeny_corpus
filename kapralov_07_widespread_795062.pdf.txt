Abstract
Background: Rubisco enzyme catalyzes the first step in net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and
photorespiratory carbon oxidation and is responsible for almost all carbon fixation on Earth. The
large subunit of Rubisco is encoded by the chloroplast rbcL gene, which is widely used for
reconstruction of plant phylogenies due to its conservative nature. Plant systematicists have mainly
used rbcL paying little attention to its function, and the question whether it evolves under
Darwinian selection has received little attention. The purpose of our study was to evaluate how
common is positive selection in Rubisco among the phototrophs and where in the Rubisco
structure does positive selection occur.
Results: We searched for positive selection in rbcL sequences from over 3000 species
representing all lineages of green plants and some lineages of other phototrophs, such as brown
and red algae, diatoms, euglenids and cyanobacteria. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis found the
presence of positive selection in rbcL of most analyzed land plants, but not in algae and
cyanobacteria. The mapping of the positively selected residues on the Rubisco tertiary structure
revealed that they are located in regions important for dimer-dimer, intradimer, large subunit-small
subunit and Rubisco-Rubisco activase interactions, and that some of the positively selected residues
are close to the active site.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that despite its conservative nature, Rubisco evolves under
positive selection in most lineages of land plants, and after billions of years of evolution Darwinian
selection still fine-tunes its performance. Widespread positive selection in rbcL has to be taken into
account when this gene is used for phylogenetic reconstructions.

Background
Ribulose-1,5-bisphospate
carboxylase/oxigenase
(Rubisco; EC 4.1.1.39) is the cornerstone of photosynthesis responsible for the conversion of inorganic carbon into
organic compounds. "The most abundant protein in the
world", Rubisco, comprises up to 50% of all soluble proteins in plants [1], which is the price phototrophs have to
pay for the enzyme's relatively slow and inefficient per-

formance. Rubisco confuses the substrate of photosynthesis, CO2, with the product, O2, resulting in energy-wasting
photorespiration. As the performance of this enzyme may
greatly affect crop yields, significant efforts have been
made to study the structure and the function of Rubisco,
with the aim to artificially improve its performance [1].

ence mainly on environmental pressure (rather than
phylogenetic factors, [3]) indicate possible positive selection to optimize CO2/O2 specificity and maximize the rate
of catalytic turnover of Rubisco in different thermal and
gaseous conditions [4].
Rubisco is one of the slowest and largest enzymes, with a
molecular mass of 560 kDa [1]. In land plants and green
algae, the chloroplast rbcL gene encodes the 55-kDa large
subunit, whereas a family of rbcS nuclear genes encodes
nearly identical 15-kDa small subunits [5,6]; in nongreen
algae both the rbcL and rbcS genes are chloroplast encoded
[7]. The Form I Rubisco of plants and algae is a hexadecameric protein composed of eight large and eight small
subunits, while the Form II Rubisco of some prokaryotes
and dinoflagellates consists of a large subunit dimer [7].
Because large subunits of Form II enzymes contain all the
structural elements required for catalysis, the origin and
the role of small subunits in Form I enzymes remain enigmatic [1].
Being one of the most conservative genes, rbcL is often
chosen by botanists for phylogenetic reconstructions and
it has been sequenced in thousands of plant species [810]. Surprisingly, despite Rubisco's great physiological
importance, well studied protein structure and abundance
of sequence data "the systematists have generally treated
rbcL sequences as strings of anonymous nucleotides, without function" [8]. While degeneration or loss of rbcL in
parasitic non-photosynthetic flowering plants has
attracted much attention [11,12], little is known about
rbcL evolution in other groups. The highly conservative
nature of rbcL is probably the reason for the lack of enthusiasm for the evolutionary analysis of this gene, and in
particular for the study of putative positive selection acting on rbcL. The only exception to this trend was the analysis of the rbcL evolution in the thermotolerant
cyanobacteria genus Synechococcus, which has shown an
increase in the number of hydrophobic residues in the
rbcLs of more thermotolerant strains – a pattern observed
for many thermostable proteins [13]. However, the dataset of eight sequences used in Synechococcus study could be
too small to detect positive selection using likelihood
molecular phylogenetic analysis [14].
Previously we have reported positive selection in the rbcL
gene associated with an adaptive radiation in the Hawaiian endemic genus Schiedea of the Caryophyllaceae family
[15]. Interestingly, the Schiedea study demonstrated that
adaptive substitutions in rbcL could have caused the
spread of an advantageous haplotype across several
closely related species, causing incongruence between the
chloroplast and species phylogenies [15]. However, positive selection in rbcL of Schiedea could have been driven by
adaptation to contrasting environments (e.g. rainforest vs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/73

dry coastal cliffs) and it remains unclear how common is
positive selection in rbcL of other phototrophs. This motivated us to conduct a wider study of positive selection in
the rbcL gene. Here we report the phylogeny-based and
protein structure-based analyses of positive selection in
3228 rbcL sequences representing all the main lineages of
green plants and some of other phototrophs, such as
brown and red algae, diatoms and euglenids, as well as
cyanobacteria. We found that while there is no clear evidence for positive selection in cyanobacteria and algae,
positive Darwinian selection in rbcL is fairly common in
all the main lineages of land plants (mosses, ferns and
allies, gymnosperms, angiosperms). Using the computational analyses of the tertiary structure of Rubisco we
show that positively selected residues are mainly located
in regions important for dimer-dimer, intradimer, large
subunit-small subunit and Rubisco-Rubisco activase
interactions.

Results and discussion
Positive selection in Rubiscos of land plants, but not of
algae and cyanobacteria
In order to test for the presence of positive selection acting
on Rubisco we used 3228 rbcL sequences from different
phototrophs (Additional file 1). Most rbcL sequences analyzed (80%) belong to flowering plants and represent 43
orders and 203 families (96% of flowering plant orders
and 44% of families sensu APG II [10]) providing reasonable coverage of the most taxon-rich lineage of phototrophs. The coverage outside flowering plants was less
extensive (Table 1 and Additional file 1). For computational efficiency all the sequences were divided into 151
monophyletic groups, based on their phylogenetic relations (see methods and Additional file 1).

For the detection of positive selection we used nested
maximum likelihood models allowing for variation in the
ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions
rates (dN/dS) across codons implemented in PAML
[16,17]. For each dataset we performed one Likelihood
Ratio Test (LRT) for dN/dS heterogeneity across codons
(M0-M3 comparison, [17]), which was significant for all
151 analyzed groups, indicating expected heterogeneity in
selective pressure across the rbcL molecule (data not
shown). Further, we performed two LRTs for the presence
of codons under positive selection: M7-M8 [17] and M8aM8 comparisons [18]. The M7 model assumes a discrete
beta distribution for dN/dS, which is constrained between
0 and 1, implemented using ten classes taken in equal
proportions. To test for the presence of codons with dN/
dS > 1, M7 is compared to the M8 model, which is similar
to the M7 model, but allows for an extra "eleventh" class
with dN/dS ≥ 1 [17]. This test was significant for 119 out
of 151 analyzed groups (Table 2 and Additional file 2). A
more stringent test for positive selection compares model

M8 with M8a, which is similar to the model M7, but
allows for an extra class of codons with dN/dS = 1 [18].
This test was significant for 121 out of 151 analyzed
groups (Tables 2 and Additional file 2). In 112 cases
(74%) both M7-M8 and M8a-M8 comparisons rejected
models without positive selection in favor of M8 model
assuming positive selection (Table 2 and Additional file
2).
For all analyzed lineages of land plants (mosses, ferns and
allies, gymnosperms, angiosperms) positive selection was
found in most cases (Table 2). The smallest proportion of
cases with detected positive selection and average dN/dS
value of "eleventh" class in M8 model were in mosses
(75% and 3.8 respectively); the highest – in gymnosperms

(88% and 8.6 respectively). There was no significant difference between the lineages of land plants in proportion
of groups with positive selection (2 × 2 contingency χ2
tests with Yates' correction). Among the main lineages of
flowering plants – magnoliids, monocots, commelinids,
eudicots (including eudicots and core eudicots), rosids
(including rosids, rosids I and rosids II) and asterids
(including asterids, euasterids I and euasterids II; all
groups sensu APG II [10]) – the smallest proportion of
cases with detected positive selection was in monocots
(61%); the highest – in asterids (89%) (Additional file 2).
There was no significant difference between the lineages
of flowering plants in proportion of groups with positive
selection (2 × 2 contingency χ2 tests with Yates' correction).

While positive selection is widespread in land plants we
did not find it in algae (including green, brown and red
algae, diatoms and euglenids) and cyanobacteria (Table
2). Positive selection has been detected in a combined
rbcL dataset of 500 sequences of land plants and algae (M.
Anisimova and V. Savolainen, personal communication).
The fact that positive selection was detected in a large
combined data set may simply mean that the signal of
positive selection is very strong in land plants so M. Anisimova and V. Savolainen still detect the signal when averaged across lineages with no positive selection, such as
algae.
As increasing number of sequences should increase the
sensitivity of the analysis [14], we joined the sets of green
(Charophyta-1 + Charophyta-2, 49 sequences in total)
and brown algae (Phaeophyta-1 + Phaeophyta-2, 48
sequences in total). Again there was no evidence for positive selection in the joint algae dataset in either M7-M8 or
M8a-M8 comparisons. Although in our dataset land
plants were much better represented (143 groups), compared to algae (7 groups) and cyanobacteria (1 group), the
difference in proportion of groups with positive selection
was significantly larger in land plants than in algae and
cyanobacteria combined (2 × 2 contingency χ2 with Yates'
correction = 20.3, P < 0.00001). In fact, the difference in
proportion of groups with positive selection between land
plants and algae is conservative, given the sequence divergence is higher in algae and cyanobacteria datasets, compared to land plants (Table 2). The power of LRTs
increases with sequence divergence until it reaches its
maximal value, after which further increases of sequence
divergence lead to reduced power [14]. The tree length values (the expected number of nucleotide substitutions per
codon along the tree) for algae and cyanobacteria datasets
ranged from 1.3 to 8.6 and were in the optimal range for
detection of positive selection [14]. The tree length values
for the most of the land plant datasets were smaller than
optimal (< 1; Table 2 and Additional file 2), hence the
number of cases with detected positive selection in land
plants may be underestimated.
Could the difference in the presence of positive selection
between land plants and algae be due to structural differences of their Rubiscos? There are prominent differences
in the Rubisco protein structures within the paraphyletic
algae group with no positive selection detected (the
"green-like" Rubiscos of green algae, euglenids and cyanobacteria vs. the "red-like" Rubiscos of red and brown algae
and diatoms), while the Rubisco structures of land plants
with widespread positive selection and green algae with
no selection detected are virtually identical [7]. So, structural differences can not explain the contrast between
algae that do not show evidence for positive selection in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/73

rbcL, and land plants, where positive selection in this gene
is ubiquitous.
An aquatic habitat is one of the few parameters shared by
most algae and cyanobacteria, but not by most of land
plants, thus the presence of positive selection in Rubiscos
of land plants, but not in algae and cyanobacteria may be
due to ecological differences between aquatic and terrestral habitats. Thermal and water regimes are more stable
in aquatic, compared to terrestrial environments. Furthermore, algae have a "bicarbonate pump" – the CO2-concentrating mechanism that uses bicarbonate dissolved in
water and suppresses the oxygenating activity of Rubisco,
making gaseous conditions of Rubisco performance more
stable [19]. Interestingly, aquatic land plants, a small
group of angiosperms with a submerged aquatic lifestyle
as a derived state, also use the bicarbonate pump [19] and
hence may be expected to have weaker signal of positive
selection than their terrestrial relatives. Indeed the sets
that consisted exclusively of submerged aquatic
angiosperms (monocots-4 and 9) or contained a high
proportion of them (monocots-5 and 7) did not show any
evidence for positive selection in rbcL (Additional file 2).
However, when aquatic land plants from sets monocots-4
and 9 were analyzed together (including submerged
aquatic plants from other monocot groups) both M7-M8
and M8a-M8 comparisons confirm a presence of positive
selection, suggesting that its signal in aquatic land plants
is too weak to be detected in the analyses of smaller
groups (joint group of submerged aquatic monocot
plants: N sequences = 67; M7-M8: χ2 = 26.72, P = 0.00001;
M8a-M8: χ2 = 4.78, P = 0.0144). Thus, it seems likely that
aquatic conditions require less fine-tuning of Rubisco
activity by positive selection, compared to terrestrial habitats.
Our analysis of 3228 rbcL sequences revealed the presence
of positive selection in 78% of analyzed land plant
groups, but not in algae and cyanobacteria. The finding of
widespread positive selection in Rubisco suggests that
either selection still continues to improve performance of
this ancient critically important enzyme, or that adaptive
evolution in rbcL may reflect the fine-tuning of Rubisco to
optimize its performance in various gaseous and thermal
conditions [4]. The much weaker evidence for positive
selection in algae and aquatic land plants growing in more
stable conditions, compared to terrestrial land plants, suggests that the later explanation is more probable. This is
also consistent with the finding that natural variation
among the kinetic parameters of Rubisco enzymes from
different species depends mainly on environmental pressures rather than on the phylogeny [3].

A few Rubisco residues are responsible for the most cases
of positive selection
To identify amino acid sites potentially under selection in
the groups with positive selection, the parameter estimates from M8 model were used to calculate the posterior
probabilities that a codon belongs to a class with dN/dS >
1 using the Bayes Empirical Bayes approaches implemented in PAML [20]. In 112 groups with positive selection detected by both M7-M8 and M8a-M8 comparisons,
98 out of 476 Rubisco residues (Additional file 3) had a
Bayesian posterior probability of positive selection larger
than 0.95 in one or more cases when analyzed by the
Bayes Empirical Bayes [20]. In 106 groups (95%) more
than one residue was under selection (average number of
amino acids under selection per group was 5.4 ± 3.3). The
distribution of residues identified in our analyses as evolving under positive selection was highly uneven: twenty of
the most often selected residues are responsible for more
than 70% of the cases of positive selection (Figure 1, Table
3 and Additional file 3). Analyses of Rubisco tertiary structure revealed that some of the twenty most often selected
residues are quite close to each other and most of them are
involved in interactions between Rubisco large and small
subunits, in interactions with Rubisco activase, dimerdimer and intradimer interactions, as well as in interactions with the active site (Figure 2, Table 3). The analyses
of mutant Rubisco enzymes have shown that interface
between large and small subunits contributes to holoenzyme thermal stability, catalytic efficiency, and CO2/O2
specificity [21,22]. Rubisco activase is responsible for
facilitating the opening of the closed Rubisco form to
release ribulose-1,5-bisphospate and to produce the active
form of the enzyme [1,23,24]. Loop 6 plays a major role
in discriminating between CO2 and O2 and functions as a
flexible "flap" that closes over the active site once the substrates are bound, and the carboxyl terminus folds over
loop 6 and appears to stabilize its closed conformation
[25]. More specifically, the effects of amino acid replacements in three residues (number 86, 262, 449) out of
twenty most selected in our analyses were tested by
directed mutagenesis in the green alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii: aspartate 86 to arginine substitution had little
effect [23]; valine 262 to leucine substitution improved
the termal stability of wild-type Rubisco in vitro [21];
cystein 449 to serine substitution showed an increased
resistance to inactivation when Rubisco in the oxidized
state [26]. The general congruence between our findings
and ones obtained by mutagenic approach suggests that
amino acids evolving under positive selection in rbcL are
located in regions important for Rubisco activity and residues involved in dimer-dimer, intradimer, large subunitsmall subunit and Rubisco-Rubisco activase interactions
as well as ones close to the active site are apparently the
prime targets of positive selection in Rubisco. The Rubisco
regions characterized by high density of residues evolving

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/73

under positive selection and located relatively far away
from the active site (e.g. strands C-D region, helix D, helix
2, helix 3; table 3) could be good candidates for mutagenic studies to reveal the broader picture of how Rubisco
functions. Detection of positive selection at the interfaces
between chloroplast- and nuclear-encoded Rubisco subunits and between Rubisco and Rubisco activase suggests
that co-evolution of proteins in the Rubisco complex can
be another driving force of adaptive evolution in rbcL.
Directed mutagenesis of Rubisco residues in
Chlamydomonas showed that a single amino acid substitution, apart from the active site, has little effect on
Rubisco function even if it occurs in a functionally important region, but when double or triple substitutions were
created, significant changes were observed in both
enzyme catalytic efficiency and specificity [1,22,26,27]. In
our study, in 95% of groups with detected positive selection, several residues (> 5 on average) simultaneously
were shown to evolve under positive selection (Additional
file 3) suggesting their coevolution within Rubisco. Simultaneous coevolution of multiple residues makes mutagenic studies of Rubisco functioning more laborious as
with any new residue added the number of mutant combinations to be tested rises exponentially. However the
integration of phylogenetic and biochemical approaches
might be beneficial for understanding of Rubisco functional mechanisms. As natural variation among the
kinetic parameters of Rubiscos from different species
mainly depends on environmental pressure rather than
phylogenetic factors [3], the integration of Rubisco activity essays with molecular phylogenetic analysis in a group
of closely related plant species occupying contrasting
environments could give direct evidence of how Rubisco
evolves in nature.
Implications for phylogenetic studies
Although rbcL was used in hundreds of phylogenetic studies, only in a small fraction of them was it treated as a biological molecule, not as "strings of anonymous
nucleotides, without function" [8]. Our analysis demonstrated that rbcL can not be regarded as a neutral marker
and positive selection is fairly common in this gene.
Källersjö and coauthors [9] simultaneously analyzed
2538 rbcL sequences by parsimony jackknifing and found
that the first and second codon positions together contain
764 informative positions which support 431 clades,
whereas 471 informative third positions support 1327
clades, clearly showing that the third positions on average
have a stronger phylogenetic signal. These findings do not
support frequent assumption that when changes occur
more often in the third position, they are likely to contain
more homoplasy and provide less phylogenetically reliable information then more conservative first and second
positions [9]. Positive selection may also result in homo-

plasy due to fixations of the same mutation that arose
independently in several phylogenetic lineages. As most
substitutions in the third codon positions are synonymous, the third codon positions are less frequent targets
of positive selection compared to the first and second
ones. Thus, findings that the first and second codon positions in rbcL have a lesser phylogenetic signal then
expected [9,28] can be explained by widespread positive
selection on rbcL.
We tested whether the removal of codons evolving under
positive selection will improve phylogenetic resolution in
112 groups with detected positive selection (Additional
file 4). We compared sums of bootstrap values between
the trees reconstructed using all sites and the trees reconstructed using only neutrally evolving sites (positively
selected sites were excluded). The sums of bootstrap frequencies did not increase or decrease for more than 5% in
41% of analyzed cases; decreased for more than 5% in
29% of cases, and increased for more than 5% in 30% of
cases. In two cases, deletion of codons evolving under
positive selection resulted in more than 55% increase of
the total bootstrap support (Additional file 4). Thus, taking into account the presence of positive selection in rbcL
may improve phylogenetic reconstructions. We recommend checking rbcL datasets for positive selection, and if
selection is found, to test whether deletion of sites evolving under positive selection from further phylogenetic
analyses would increase topological resolution/bootstrap
support of the selected branches. Alternatively, sites evolving under positive selection could be appropriately modelled for improving their contribution into phylogenetic
signal, although there is no available "ready to use" program which can do it at the moment.
Adaptive mutations may spread across subpopulations of
a species, or across several species with very little gene
flow [29]. Thus, positive selection in Rubisco may facilitate horizontal interspecific gene flow for chloroplast
DNA, as spreading of adaptive mutations in rbcL may
result in fixation of a single chloroplast haplotype in several occasionally hybridising species, which may dramatically affect phylogeny reconstruction. Previously we
detected strong cytonuclear discordance apparently
caused by positive selection in rbcL in the Hawaiian
endemic plant genus Schiedea [15]. This illustrates the
danger of reconstructing phylogenetic relations solely
from chloroplast data in groups with putative interspecific
hybridization: tests for the presence of positive selection
and for the congruence between chloroplast and nuclear
phylogenies are essential for correct inference of species
phylogenetic relations.

Conclusion
Our molecular phylogenetic analysis unexpectedly
revealed that positive selection in the rbcL gene of terrestrial land plants is quite a common phenomenon. On the
other hand, positive selection in cyanobacteria, algae and
aquatic land plants is less prominent, which may possibly
be explained by more stable conditions of aquatic environment compared to terrestrial one. The residues
involved in dimer-dimer, intradimer, large subunit-small
subunit and Rubisco-Rubisco activase interactions as well
as ones close to the active site are apparently the prime targets of positive selection in Rubisco. Widespread adaptive
evolution in rbcL may reflect the perpetual fine-tuning of
Rubisco to optimize its performance in changing gaseous
and thermal conditions and/or co-evolution of proteins
in the Rubisco complex. The integration of phylogenetic
and biochemical research is required to test the hypothesis that Darwinian selection during Rubisco evolution is
driven by continuous fine-tuning to changing conditions.
Widespread positive selection in rbcL has to be taken into
account when this gene is used for phylogenetic reconstructions specifically when interspecific hybridization is
possible.

Methods
Data preparation
All but thirteen rbcL sequences used in this study were
extracted from NCBI GenBank [30] and the species names
and accession numbers as well as taxonomic information
are given in Additional file 1. The thirteen novel
sequences (all representing genus Silene) were deposited
in [GenBank:EF418555–EF418567].

The obtained sequences were aligned and edited for further analyses using ProSeq3 software [31]. Codon alignments were made from amino-acid alignments and
manually checked. All alignments were straightforward
and unambiguous confirming the highly conservative
nature of rbcL. We found only one insertion/deletion
which separated the group of red, brown and diatom
algae from all the rest of analyzed lineages. This indel gap
did not impact our analyses because we analyzed many
separate data sets instead of the joint one (see below). It
should be noted that many sequences lack bases at the 5'
and/or the 3' end; we made alignments within each analyzed dataset of the same length by sequence truncation.
Suspicious sequences (such as containing stop codons)
were not included into analyses. All alignments are available upon request from the corresponding author.
Likelihood ratio tests for positive selection
For detection of positive selection we used codon-based
analysis (codeml) implemented in PAML v.3.14 package
[16]. It has been shown that the power to detect positive
selection is close to 100% in data sets of ≥ 17 sequences

[14]. As the computing time grows dramatically with the
number of sequences analyzed, we divided all rbcL
sequences into 151 relatively small monophyletic groups
(Additional file 1) by manual dissection of phylogenetic
trees constructed using neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in MEGA v3.1 [32].

sons between four groups of land plants (mosses, ferns
and allies, gymnosperms, angiosperms); second, between
six groups of angiosperms (magnoliids, monocots, commelinids, eudicots, rosids, asterids; all groups sensu APG II
[10]); and, finally, between land plants and combined
algae and cyanobacteria dataset.

For all analyses of positive selection we used the codeml
program from the PAML package [16]. All PAML analyses
were performed using "user tree" runmode in codeml. The
employed trees were reconstructed by neighbor-joining
algorithm implemented in MEGA [32] using following
parameters: pairwise deletion of missed sites, all three
codon positions used, both transitions and transversions
used, homogeneous pattern among lineages and uniform
rates among sites, both Kimura's [33] and Tamura-Nei's
[34] models of nucleotide substitutions were used, which
resulted in similar topologies. The resulting topologies
were manually checked for congruence with systematics
of analyzed taxa. Although some of these phylogenies
may slightly deviate from the "true" species trees, this
should not significantly influence Likelihood Ratio Tests
(LRTs) we used for analysis of positive selection, as they
were shown to be robust to phylogenetic uncertainty [35].
We used models of codon evolution that allow for variation in dN/dS among codons [17] to perform LRTs for rate
heterogeneity among amino acid sites and for positive
selection. We performed one LRT for dN/dS heterogeneity
(M0-M3 [17]) and two LRTs for positive selection: M7-M8
[17] and M8a-M8 [18]. For all LRTs, the first model is a
simplified version of the second one, with fewer parameters, and is thus expected to provide a poorer fit to the data
(lower maximum likelihood). The M7 and M8a models
are the null models without positive selection (no codons
with dN/dS > 1) and the M8 model is the alternative
model with positive selection. The significance of the LRTs
was calculated assuming that twice the difference in the
log of maximum likelihood values between the two models is distributed as a χ2 distribution. The degrees of freedom (df) were given by the difference in the numbers of
parameters in the two nested models. It was argued that
for the M0-M3 and M7-M8 comparisons the df = 2 [17],
while for M8a-M8 comparisons the appropriate test
would use a 50:50 mixture of df = 0 and df = 1 [18].
Accordingly, to calculate a P-value from this mixture of
distributions we first calculated the P-value assuming df =
1, and then halved it. Cases in which M8 model fitted better with P < 0.05 in both M7-M8 and M8a-M8 comparisons were regarded as having positive selection.

To identify amino acid sites potentially under selection in
the groups with confirmed positive selection, the parameter estimates from M8 model were used to calculate the
posterior probabilities that a codon belongs to a class with
dN/dS > 1 using the Bayes Empirical Bayes approaches
implemented in PAML [20].

The significance of difference in proportion of cases with
detected positive selection between the analyzed plant
groups was evaluated by 2 × 2 contingency χ2 tests with
Yates' correction. First, we performed pairwise compari-

Structural analysis of Rubisco
The analyzed rbcL sequences are fairly conserved, and any
differences in length occur at the C-terminus. This allows
us to use published spinach Rubisco protein structure [3638] for structural analysis. Throughout the paper, the
numbering of Rubisco large subunit residues is based on
the spinach sequence. Rubisco structural data files for
spinach 1RBO [37] and 1RCX [38] were obtained from
the RCSB Protein Data Bank [39]. The locations and properties of individual amino acids in the Rubisco structure
were analyzed using DeepView – Swiss-PdbViewer v.3.7
[40].
Evaluation of effects of positive selection on phylogenetic
reconstructions
Given that positive selection may result in homoplasy we
tested whether the removal of codons evolving under positive selection will improve the phylogenetic resolution.
We compared boostrap sums of trees reconstructed using
all sites (including ones evolving under positive selection)
with boostrap sums of trees reconstructed using only neutrally evolving sites. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed
in MEGA [32] using neighbor-joining algorithm with
Tamura-Nei's [34] model of nucleotide substitutions. We
used 50% majority rule trees and subtracted 50% from
each support value before summing up. The subtraction
was done to circumvent the bias in summing up bootstrap
values of a consensus tree; e.g. a tree with two 51% groups
would have higher support than one with one group with
100% support, and if support was decreased from 51% to
49%, the sum would be zero (due to a threshold of 50%).
