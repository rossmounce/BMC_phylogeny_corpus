Abstract
Background: Archaea are prokaryotic organisms with simplified versions of eukaryotic
transcription systems. Genes coding for the general transcription factors TBP and TFB are present
in multiple copies in several Archaea, including Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Multiple TBP and TFBs
have been proposed to participate in transcription of genes via recognition and recruitment of RNA
polymerase to different classes of promoters.
Results: We attempted to knock out all six TBP and seven TFB genes in Halobacterium sp. NRC1 using the ura3-based gene deletion system. Knockouts were obtained for six out of thirteen
genes, tbpCDF and tfbACG, indicating that they are not essential for cell viability under standard
conditions. Screening of a population of 1,000 candidate mutants showed that genes which did not
yield mutants contained less that 0.1% knockouts, strongly suggesting that they are essential. The
transcriptomes of two mutants, ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA, were compared to the parental strain and
showed coordinate down regulation of many genes. Over 500 out of 2,677 total genes were
regulated in the ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA mutants with 363 regulated in both, indicating that over 10% of
genes in both strains require the action of both TbpD and TfbA for normal transcription. Culturing
studies on the ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA mutant strains showed them to grow more slowly than the wildtype at an elevated temperature, 49°C, and they showed reduced viability at 56°C, suggesting TbpD
and TfbA are involved in the heat shock response. Alignment of TBP and TFB protein sequences
suggested the expansion of the TBP gene family, especially in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, and TFB
gene family in representatives of five different genera of haloarchaea in which genome sequences
are available.
Conclusion: Six of thirteen TBP and TFB genes of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 are non-essential
under standard growth conditions. TbpD and TfbA coordinate the expression of over 10% of the
genes in the NRC-1 genome. The ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA mutant strains are temperature sensitive,
possibly as a result of down regulation of heat shock genes. Sequence alignments suggest the
existence of several families of TBP and TFB transcription factors in Halobacterium which may
function in transcription of different classes of genes.

Background
Archaea drive transcription using a simplified version of a
eukaryotic RNA polymerase II-like transcription system
made up of 11–13 subunits [1-5]. The first step in transcription requires the binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) transcription factor to the TATA box, which
results in bending of the DNA [6]. When the TBP-DNA
complex is correctly oriented, it is bound by TFB
(homolog of eukaryotic TFIIB) to a region just upstream
of the TATA box (B recognition element) and is responsible for the polarity of transcription. This contrasts with
eukaryotic pol II promoters which are bound by additional TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Finally, RNA
polymerase is recruited and transcription is initiated [4,79]. We sought to understand the process of transcription
in halophilic archaea, using the model halophilic
archaeon, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1.
The general model for transcription in archaea was complicated by the discovery of a multiplicity of TBP (six) and
TFB (seven) genes in the genome sequence of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [10,11]. The inventory of transcription
genes in NRC-1 included the RNA polymerase, coded by
twelve genes located at 6 loci [12]. Genes encoding Rpo
subunits A, C, B', B", and H [13], and subunits E' and E",
as well as subunits K, N, and M, were all found in single
copies on the 2 Mbp chromosome. The transcription factors genes, in contrast, were present on both the chromosome and pNRC100 and pNRC200 minichromosomes
(which are 191 and 365 kbp, respectively, in size), including four tbp genes on pNRC100 (tbpA, B, C, and D) and
additional single genes on both pNRC200 (tbpF) and
chromosome (tbpE) [12,14]. Five of the seven tfb genes
were present on the large chromosome (tfbA, B, D, F, and
G) and the other two were on pNRC200 (tfbC and E).
These results suggested the possibility of a novel regulatory system involving the recognition of different classes
of promoters by specific TBP-TFB combinations
[10,15,16].
The possibility of multiple classes of promoters recognized by different factors was supported by promoter
mutagenesis studies. These studies showed that while
some Halobacterium genes have the requirement of a
canonical TATA box [17], others deviate from the consensus [11]. One of the best studied examples, the bacterioopsin (bop) gene promoter, contains a TATA-box (GTTACA) [11,18] which deviates significantly from the
archaeal consensus (TTATA). Moreover, in the region
immediately 5' to the bop TATA-box, there is no recognizable BRE sequence functioning in TFB recognition. These
results suggest the requirement of a non-canonical TBPTFB pair in promoter selection and transcriptional regulation for some haloarchaeal gene promoters. These findings suggest unusual complexity in promoter selection in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/61

halophilic archaea, which may in some respects resemble
higher organisms [10,11,19-22].
In addition to transcription, a variety of genetic characteristics of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 have been studied in our
laboratory and other laboratories [23]. The popularity of
NRC-1 for post-genomic studies stems from its ease of
manipulation in the laboratory and the wide variety of
experimental tools available for its investigation [24,25].
Culturing of this model organism, which has a 6 hour
generation time at 42°C, is simple and it is genetically
tractable. Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 is transformable at
high-efficiency, and a good selection of cloning and
expression vectors are available [26-29]. Several genetic
markers have been developed, including the selectable
and counterselectable ura3 gene, which permit construction of systematic gene knockouts and replacements [3038]. Whole-genome DNA microarrays have been successfully used to interrogate patterns of gene expression [3943].
In the present study, we addressed the role of specific TBPTFB pairs in promoter selection by a combination of
genetic and transcriptomic analysis. We found nearly half
of the tbp and tfb genes are non-essential and may be
knocked-out without deleterious effects on the cells
grown under standard laboratory conditions. Comparison of two of these gene deletion strains, ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA,
showed a high correspondence in the genes that apparently require them for transcription as well as a reduced
growth rate and viability at elevated temperature, consistent with reduced transcription of heat shock protein
genes.

Results
Construction of tbp and tfb knockout strains
To determine the essentiality of the six tbp and seven tfb
genes in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and study their involvement in gene expression, we attempted to individually
knock out all 13 genes using the ∆ura3 system [26]. For
this work, ~500 bp of the 5' and 3' flanking sequence and
the first four and last four codons of each of the 13 tbp and
tfb genes were cloned into the pBB400 or pMPK408 suicide vector (see additional files 3 and 4), and transformed
into the ∆ura3 mutant of wild-type Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1. Integrant strains were selected on uracil dropout
media and excisants were selected on agar plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) [31,38,42]. PCR amplification was conducted on DNA template from 20 to 70
FoaR colonies using flanking primers to screen for each
gene deletion. Knockouts were obtained for six genes:
tbpC, tbpD, tbpF, tfbA, tfbC, and tfbG, indicating that these
genes are non-essential under standard laboratory growth
conditions (Figures 1 and 2, Table 1).

For the remaining seven genes, for which deletants were
not obtained, we assayed for the presence of knockout
alleles using populations of 1,000 FoaR colonies batchwise. Control experiments showed that our detection
limit for deletants was one knockout allele for every 100–
500 wild-type alleles (data not shown). For all of the tbp

the initial screens (tbpABE and tfbBDEF), bands corresponding only to the wild-type alleles, but not the deletion alleles were observed. This indicated that these genes
were not deleted, even at a frequency of 0.1%, which is
consistent with the requirement of these genes for cell viability under standard laboratory growth conditions (Figures 1 and 2).
Microarray analysis
To test the hypothesis of a novel regulatory system requiring the recognition of different promoters by specific TBPTFB combinations operating in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1,
we compared the transcriptomes of two mutants, ∆tbpD
and ∆tfbA (see additional files 1 and 2). We used custom
DNA microarrays fabricated using Agilent inkjet technol-

ogy with oligonucleotides designed with the program OligoPicker. The arrays contained 10,807 60-mer nucleotide
features representing 2,677 open reading frames (ORFs)
[41,42]. Each knockout mutant was compared to the parent ∆ura3 strain and both biological and technical replicates were performed. A significant change in transcript
abundance was defined as at least 1.5-fold change (Figures 3 and 4).
Of the 2,677 ORFs on the array, representing 99.9% of the
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genes, 272 (10%) showed lower
transcript levels and 141 (5.3%) showed higher transcript
levels in the ∆tbpD strain while 304 (11.4%) showed
lower transcript levels and 178 (6.6%) showed higher
transcript levels in the ∆tfbA strain (see additional files 1
and 2). Strikingly, a large fraction of the transcriptionally
affected genes, 262 genes with less transcript and 101 with
more transcript levels were changed by 1.5-fold or greater
magnitude in both knockout strains. A total of 96.3 and
86.2% of the genes found to have lower transcript levels
in either the ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA strains, respectively, corresponded to lower transcript levels in the other. This similar depression in transcript level of a large number of
genes suggests that the great majority of genes requiring
the TbpD factor for transcription also requires the TfbA
factor, and vice versa (Figures 3, 4, 5, and Table 2).

chemotaxis proteins (cheC2), gas vesicle gene cluster
(gvpA-L), small heat shock protein (hsp1), and the thermosome (cctA) are all down regulated in both mutants
(see additional files 1, 2 and 5).
Analysis of the microarray data showed transcriptional
changes in several gene clusters, indicating that they are
responsive to TbpD and TfbA: vng1–3, vng80–84 (moe
genes), vng161–162 (glutamate dehydrogenase and
medium-chain acyl-CoA ligase), vng811–813 (spermidine/putrescine-binding protein), vng814–817 (quinine
oxidoreductase and chitinases), vng1238–1240 (amino
acid transporter yhdG), vng1314–1315, vng1340–1342
(3-oxoacyl-reductase and N5, N10-methylenetretrahydromethanopterin reductases), vng1550–1566 (cobalamin biosynthesis), vng1632-1365 (cobalt transport),
vng1801–1802 (hsp1), vng1972–1973 (chains of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), vng2217–2220 (pyruvate
dehydrogenase,
dihydrolipoamide
Sacetyltransferase, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, prephenate dehydratase), vng2377–2378 (nitrite/nitrate
reduction and copper transport), vng5028–5033 (gas vesicle cluster A), vng6229–6247 (gas vesicle cluster B).

Genes where expression was changed by 1.5-fold or
greater in either the ∆tbpD or ∆tfbA mutants were grouped
into one of 13 functional categories (Table 2). In all cases,
the largest groups were the unknowns, accounting for 30
to 45% of all regulated genes. Interestingly, the percentage
of genes co-regulated on each replicon is roughly the same
for the ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA microarray. For the genes whose
transcripts are decreased in both mutant strains, 85% are
on the chromosome, 3% are on pNRC100, and 11% are
on pNRC200. For genes whose transcripts are increased in
the mutant strains, 87% are on the chromosome, 6% are
on pNRC100, 6% are on pNRC200. This suggests that
TbpD, whose gene is on pNRC100, is able to pair with
TfbA, whose gene in on the chromosome, to coordinate
regulation of genes all over the genome but predominately in the chromosome. The location of the regulated
genes was checked and found to be distributed essentially
randomly over the entire genome.

Heat shock response
It was evident from the microarray data that the gene for
one small heat shock protein (hsp1) and the thermosome
(cctA) had reduced transcript levels in both the ∆tbpD and
∆tfbA mutant strains (-10.3 and -3.1-fold respectively for
∆tbpD and -15.8 and -2.2-fold respectively for ∆tfbA).
Since a reduction in small heat shock proteins has been
previously shown to increase the amount of aggregated
cytosolic protein [44], we hypothesized that both strains
(∆tbpD and ∆tfbA) would have slower growth rates at elevated temperatures (i.e. above 42°C). Doubling times
were measured for the parent, ∆tbpD, and ∆tfbA strains to
gauge the growth effects at elevated temperatures. Growth
curves at 37°C, calculated from the line of least squares
for the growth of each strain, indicated that all three
strains had doubling times of 13 to 13.5 hours (data not
shown). However, growth curves at 49°C showed that the
∆tbpD and ∆tfbA strains grew more slowly than the ∆ura3
strain. Doubling times were 14.4 ± 0.5 for ∆ura3, 16.5 ±
0.7 for ∆tbpD and 17.3 ± 1.1 hours for ∆tfbA (data not
shown).

As expected, the expression of the ∆tbpD or ∆tfbA mutants
was significantly reduced compared to the parent strain,
12.4-fold and 10.8-fold respectively (Table 3). Further,
tfbA was significantly down regulated (1.5-fold) in the
∆tbpD strain. Transcription of the other tbp and tfb genes
was not significantly changed, except tfbF in the ∆tbpD and
∆tfbA strains and tbpF in the ∆tfbA strain. Further, the transcripts of several important enzymes such as triosephosphate isomerase (tpiA), chitinases (chi and chi2),

To further confirm the heat sensitive phenotype of both
strains, we tested the ability of the ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA strains
to survive at elevated temperatures. Incubating the ∆ura3
strain for one hour at a sublethal temperature, 49°C,
before exposure to a lethal temperature, 56°C, resulted in
protection by a classic heat shock response that could be
observed after about two hours, with greater survival
(89% survival) compared to direct exposure to 56°C
(62% survival) [45]. In contrast, the ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA

strains showed little or no protection from preincubation
at 49°C versus direct exposure to 56°C (46 versus 51% for
∆tbpD and 58 versus 67% for ∆tfbA). These experiments
corroborated the results from analysis of growth rates,
confirming that the ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA strains have a
reduced ability to grow and survive at higher temperatures
(Table 4). The observed reduction in growth rate and
decrease in survivability at increased temperatures in the
mutants is consistent with a role for the TbpD and TfbA
transcription factors in protection of cells to elevated temperature.
Phylogenetic analysis of TBPs and TFBs
In order to examine the evolutionary relationships of the
haloarchaeal TBP and TFB proteins, sequences from Halo-

bacterium sp. NRC-1, Haloarcula marismortui, Haloferax volcanii, Haloquadratum walsbyi, Natronomonas pharaonis, and
Pyrococcus woesei, as an outgroup, were used to generate
alignments using the ClustalX program and produce phylogenetic trees with the core regions using the PAUP* program. The resulting trees are shown in Figure 6. For the
TBP tree, the largest family consists of TbpE from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and a single member from each of the
other four haloarchaea, including the sole TBP from H.
marismortui and N. pharaonis. The other families contained up to three homologs of the canonical TBP protein,
with representatives from NRC-1 in two clades, with at
least one member being dispensable by gene deletion
(asterisks in Figure 6A).
The situation was significantly more complex for TFB proteins, which were present in greater copy numbers (7–9)
in all five haloarchaea (Figure 6B). The largest family of
TFBs contained three members from Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1, which did not show knockouts (TfbB, TfbD, and
TfbF), and between two and five for each of the other
haloarchaea. Another large family contained two members from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (TfbC and TfbG), both
of which were found to be dispensable by knockouts, but
each of the other haloarchaea also contained one or more
members. A third family contained one member from
each of the five haloarchaea, including TfbA from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and a fourth family contained TfbE from
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, for which we were unable to isolate a knockout, and H. volcanii (four members) and H.
marismortui (one member) homologs.

Discussion
The present study describes a combination of genetic,
transcriptomic, and phylogenetic analyses of tbp and tfb
genes and proteins in haloarchaea. Our knockout analysis

rium sp. NRC-1 showed that TbpD regulates 15%, TfbA
regulates 18%, and TbpD and TfbA together regulate over
10% of the genes in the NRC-1 genome. These genetic
results strongly support the prediction of a novel mechanism of gene regulation where specific TBP-TFB pairs are
used for transcription of specific subsets of genes. Our
finding that two key heat shock genes, hsp1 and cctA, are
under transcriptional control of TbpD and TfbA factors,
and that both the ∆tbpD and ∆tfbA mutants are sensitive
to elevated temperatures, suggest that these factors regulate expression of genes important for survival at
increased temperature in this haloarchaeon.
The finding of multiple tbp and tfb genes in Halobacterium
sp. NRC-1, a larger total number than for any other
archaea or eukaryote, and their involvement in transcription of specific genes is a novel finding [12,14]. These
genes are generally found in one or two copies and their
use as general transcription factors in most other archaea
and eukaryotes is underscored by the fact that the eukaryotic factors can substitute for archaeal factors in vitro [46].
For haloarchaea, we previously predicted that with six TBP
factors and seven TFB factors, up to 42 different TBP-TFB
combinations may occur [10]. Our results, showing that
the knockouts of tbpD and tfbA (Figure 1) each significantly alter the expression of nearly the same set of genes
in the Halobacterium genome (Table 2 and additional files
1 and 2), suggests that some factors may have only a few
or even only one cognate partner, and the complexity may

be considerably lower than we originally hypothesized.
However, this may be masked by the fact that a TBP and
TFB pair must be involved in the transcription of other
TBPs, TFBs, and regulators, the latter of which would
result in indirect effects. The requirement of specific partners may also explain why in early studies of transcription
in vitro, a purified RNA polymerase of Halobacterium sp.
did not produce properly initiated transcripts [5,47].
Two of the most highly affected genes in the ∆tbpD and
∆tfbA mutants were the hsp1 and cctA genes (Figure 4 and
additional files 1, 2 and 5). The hsp1 gene is a member of
the hsp26/42 clade (COG0071), which is a part of the
diverse α-crystallin protein family existing in most but not
all bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea and responsible for
preventing the non-specific aggregation of proteins
[48,49]. Analysis of the genomic sequence of NRC-1
showed that the hsp1 gene may be part of a co-ordinately
regulated operon whose other member (VNG1802) has
no homology with any previously characterized genes,
suggesting a novel approach or new member of the
response to elevated temperature. The cctA gene is homologous to the groEL/hsp60 family of proteins (COG0459),
a well characterized family of chaperones which have
been shown to provide kinetic assistance to polypeptide
folding in most bacteria and some archaea [44,50,51].
The other portion of the thermosome in Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1, cctB, and unlinked gene, was also down regulated
but just below (-1.43 fold) our 1.5 fold cut-off. The

decreased levels of transcript for both these genes coupled
with the slower doubling times for both mutant strains
strongly suggest that the TbpD and TfbA genes act together
to regulate at least a portion of the heat shock response in
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1.
Previous heat shock studies in the haloarchaea had shown
that certain Tfb proteins [16] and small heat shock proteins [52] may be induced at higher temperatures. The tfb2
gene of H. volcanii showed up to an eight-fold increase in
transcript levels at elevated temperatures by Northern
analysis and the corresponding protein was also shown to
increase two-fold by Western analysis after incubation at
elevated temperatures [16]. The tfb1 gene also showed a
slight increase in transcript levels, but an increase in protein could not be confirmed. A more recent proteomic

analysis of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 showed that there
was an increased abundance of three of the four small
heat shock proteins, including the hsp1 gene product, and
the DnaJ and GrpE homologs under increased temperature. However, changes in TBPs or TFBs were not found in
this study [45].
Our inability to knockout seven out of thirteen tbp and tfb
genes (Figures 1 and 2) indicated that many of these genes
are probably essential for viability of cells. However, of
the five genera for which genome sequences are available,
two contained only a single TBP, H. marismortui, and N.
pharaonis, while the other three contained a plurality: six
for NRC-1, four for H. volcanii, and two for H. walsbyi. Not
surprisingly, three of the six TBP genes in NRC-1 could be
easily knocked out. This suggests that there is likely to be

BMC Genetics 2007, 8:61

overlapping activity in the function of TBP genes in those
haloarchaea which contain multiple genes, or that some
TBPs may be required for only a small number of nonessential genes. However, our inability to isolate mutants
of three TBP genes (Figure 2), even screening populations
of 1,000 or more, is consistent with the hypothesis that
several distinct classes of promoters do exist. Our finding
of a large number of affected genes in the tbpD deletion
mutant is consistent with this suggestion. It is tempting to
speculate that the plurality of TBP-like proteins in Halobacterium may be analogous to that found in some animal
systems, where recognition of alternate promoters has
been implicated in development [22,53].
In contrast to the relatively small numbers of TBP genes,
larger numbers of TFB genes are present across all five genera of haloarchaea, suggesting a more complex function
for TFB transcription factors. There may be different
classes of promoters which use the same TBP but distinct
TFB proteins in promoter recognition. In our prior mutagenic analysis of the bop promoter, we found no conservation in the BRE region immediately 5' to the putative
TATA-box where the TBP is expected to bind, suggesting
the possibility of more variation in these factors in haloarchaea than has been observed in other systems. Like TBPs,
our ability to knockout three TFB genes (Figures 1 and 2)
indicates that there may be overlap in promoter recognition among some of these proteins. However, it is also
possible for TFBs that some members are required only for
transcription of a small number of specialized genes,
which are not required under standard laboratory growth
conditions. Interestingly, in a recent report, either one of
two closely related TFBs genes in the thermophilic
archaeon, Thermococcus kodakaraensis, may be deleted
individually but not together. This suggests that only
those organisms with divergent TFBs and TBPs, like Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, can use the transcription factors for
promoter selection [54].
Another recent report [55] covering the essentiality of
TBPs and TFBs in Halobacterium suggests that tbpACD and
tfbABCDE are not essential for growth under standard laboratory conditions. The control assays used for our PCRbased mutant screens suggested that we could detect a
knockout allele at a frequency of 0.1% in a population.
This leaves open the possibility that we were unable to
identify knockouts present at low frequency. However, it
is difficult to compare the results directly, since no primary data is provided and a differing method to create the
knockouts was used. Further, the authors of the recent
report grew their cultures at 37°C, not 42°C as we have.
Thus, it is possible that some of the discrepancies in essentiality arose from this difference in growth temperature.
This makes sense in light of our heat shock data where a
one-hour incubation at a sublethal temperature (49°C)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/61

before exposure to a lethal temperature (56°C) resulted in
greater survival. This response seems to be regulated at
least partially by tbpD and tfbA; however, it may also
require other basal transcription factors that are unnecessary at lower temperatures. Finally, the authors did not
observe a correlation between tbpD and tfbA in their ChIPChip analysis or evolutionary relationship analysis of
multiple microarrays covering seven different experimental variables. This may be due to the shortcomings of their
ChIP-Chip approach as a majority of the genes they surveyed showed no interaction with any basal transcription
factor and the fact that it is difficult to tweeze out fine
details such as basal transcription interaction in multiple
microarrays performed under varying conditions.
Our results provide the first in-depth analysis of the multiple TBP and TFB factors in the model haloarchaeon,
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. We find that a pair of factors,
TbpD and TfbA, is required for coordinate transcription of
over 10% of the genome of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. This
remarkable finding confirms one of the predictions of earlier studies suggesting that specific TBP-TFB pairs may be
required for transcription of certain genes in haloarchaea
[15] and therefore are involved in a novel mechanism of
gene regulation in the third Domain of life. We speculate
that this mechanism may have evolved to handle the great
environmental dynamics experienced in hypersaline environments. The finding of reduction of growth rate at 49°C
and a decrease in survival at 56°C in the absence of TbpD
and TfbA is consistent with a critical biological function.

Methods
Strains, culturing, and construction of knockouts
Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for construction and
propagation of plasmids. Plasmid pBB400 or pMPK408,
containing the ura3 and bla genes, was used as the vector
for construction of gene knockouts [26]. Knockout constructs were created by first cloning, into the SmaI site, a
PCR amplified fragment containing the coding region of
the target gene and ~500 bp of sequence upstream and
downstream (see additional file 3). For construction of
gene deletion plasmids, inverse primer pairs hybridizing
near the start and stop codons of the target genes, including several codons, were used for PCR amplification and
the linear product was ligated to circularize (see additional file 4).

A uracil auxotroph Halobacterium strain (∆ura3) was used
as the host for construction of the tbp and tfb knockouts
[31]. The ∆ura3 strain was grown in CM+ media supplemented with 5-FOA and competent cells were obtained
through the addition of EDTA and PEG, as previously
described [24]. After transformation with knockout plasmids, integrants were selected on agar plates containing
uracil drop-out media. DNA was purified from individual

Page 10 of 13

BMC Genetics 2007, 8:61

colonies and integrant strains confirmed by PCR amplification of the bla gene. Excisants were selected on CM+
media with 0.25 mg/ml 5-FOA. DNA was purified from
either individual colonies or by collecting ~1,000 colonies
from a CM+-5-FOA plate and screened by PCR amplification using upstream and downstream primers [31,42]
(see additional files 3 and 4).
Whole genome microarray analysis
The ∆ura3, ∆ura3∆tbpD, and ∆ura3∆tfbA Halobacterium
strains were aerobically grown in batch cultures, shaken in
a New Brunswick G25 rotary shaker at 220 rpm, to exponential phase (OD600 = 1) at 42°C. Before harvesting the
cells, cultures were swirled in an ice-water bath to rapidly
cool the cultures and "freeze" the RNA profile. Total RNA
was isolated using the Agilent total RNA isolation mini kit
(Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and then treated
with DNase. cDNA was prepared with equal amounts of
RNA from control and experimental samples and then fluorescently labeled with Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-d-CTP. Concentrations of RNA and cDNA were measured using a
Nanodrop (ND-1000 spectrophotometer). Incorporation
of the Cy-3 and Cy-5 labels was checked via gel electrophoresis and scanning on a GE Typhoon fluorescence
scanner. Both biological replicates (independent cultures)
and technical replicates (dye swap) were performed for
each paring (i.e. knockout and ∆ura3 strain) [42]. The
same ∆ura3 culture was used as the control in all arrays.
Washing and hybridization of the arrays was performed as
recommended by Agilent and previously described [41].
Slides were scanned for Cy-3 and Cy-5 signals with an Agilent DNA-microarray scanner.

Oligonucleotide arrays, in situ synthesized using ink-jet
technology, were used for transcriptome analysis of the
strains [56]. Oligomer (60-mer) probes have been
designed for 2,677 (99.9%) ORFs utilizing OligoPicker
[57]. These microarrays were thoroughly tested for linearity of response and statistical significance in related studies of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [41,42]. Signal intensities
with a dynamic range in excess of three orders of magnitude were found allowing simultaneous analysis of lowand high-intensity features. Probe signals were extracted
and initial analysis was done with the Agilent Feature
Extraction Software, where signal from each channel was
normalized using the LOWESS algorithm [58] to remove
intensity-dependent effects within the calculated values.
The data was also log2 transformed and parsed using an
Excel script [43]. Genes showing greater than 1.5 fold
change in transcript abundance in at least two of the replicates with an illuminant intensity greater than 7 and less
than 14 were selected for further analysis [59].

Phenotypic analysis
Growth curves were measured for 25 ml cultures grown in
CM+ in Klett flasks, starting with an initial Klett reading of
20, grown at either 37 or 49°C in an Innova 4230 rotary
shaker shaken at 220 rpm. Measurements were taken for
four cultures at 37°C and eight cultures at 49°C per
knockout until late log phase on a Klett-Summerson Photoelectric Colorimeter and doubling times derived by calculating the line of least squares from 20–45 hours of
growth post inoculation (exponential phase). The effects
of heat killing were also measured for each strain. For this,
cultures were grown at 42°C and then incubated at 49°C
for 1 hour then shifted to 56°C for 2 hours or 56°C for 3
hours. Aliquots were taken from cultures at all temperatures at one hour intervals and plated onto CM+ media
and allowed to grow at 37°C.
