Comparative phylogeography of two related
plant species with overlapping ranges in Europe,
and the potential effects of climate change on
their intraspecific genetic diversity
Gemma E Beatty, Jim Provan*

Abstract
Background: The aim of the present study was to use a combined phylogeographic and species distribution
modelling approach to compare the glacial histories of two plant species with overlapping distributions, Orthilia
secunda (one-sided wintergreen) and Monotropa hypopitys (yellow bird’s nest). Phylogeographic analysis was carried
out to determine the distribution of genetic variation across the range of each species and to test whether both
correspond to the “classic” model of high diversity in the south, with decreasing diversity at higher latitudes, or
whether the cold-adapted O. secunda might retain more genetic variation in northern populations. In addition,
projected species distributions based on a future climate scenario were modelled to assess how changes in the
species ranges might impact on total intraspecific diversity in both cases.
Results: Palaeodistribution modelling and phylogeographic analysis using multiple genetic markers (chloroplast
trnS-trnG region, nuclear ITS and microsatellites for O. secunda; chloroplast rps2, nuclear ITS and microsatellites for
M. hypopitys) indicated that both species persisted throughout the Last Glacial Maximum in southern refugia. For
both species, the majority of the genetic diversity was concentrated in these southerly populations, whereas those
in recolonized areas generally exhibited lower levels of diversity, particularly in M. hypopitys. Species distribution
modelling based on projected future climate indicated substantial changes in the ranges of both species, with a
loss of southern and central populations, and a potential northward expansion for the temperate M. hypopitys.
Conclusions: Both Orthilia secunda and Monotropa hypopitys appear to have persisted through the LGM in Europe
in southern refugia. The boreal O. secunda, however, has retained a larger proportion of its genetic diversity in
more northerly populations outside these refugial areas than the temperate M. hypopitys. Given that future species
distribution modelling suggests northern range shifts and loss of suitable habitat in the southern parts of the
species’ current distributions, extinction of genetically diverse rear edge populations could have a significant effect
in the rangewide intraspecific diversity of both species, but particularly in M. hypopitys.

Background
Paleoclimatic evidence indicates that the Earth’s temperature has been continually changing over time [1-3].
The glacial and interglacial cycles that characterised the
Quaternary period (ca. 2.6 MYA - present) have had a
significant effect on the distributions of species, particularly in the northern latitudes [4,5]. Temperate species

were generally confined to low-latitude refugia throughout glacial periods and recolonized from these areas as
the climate warmed during interglacials [6,7]. For plant
species, however, whose spread is primarily via dispersal
of seeds, the capacity to track changes in suitable habitat
is limited, particularly for animal-dispersed species [8].
Understanding the past movements of species may
help us understand how present and future climate
change might affect species’ ranges [9,10]. Within the
last decade, it has become evident that anthropogenically induced climate change is causing shifts in the

distribution ranges of many species [11-14]. As projections of carbon emissions suggest that this period of global warming will not end soon, these range shifts are
likely to continue, but where species lack the migratory
capacity to track changes in climate and available habitat, population extinctions may become increasingly frequent, particularly at species’ low-latitude range edges
[14-17]. Range-edge populations have generally been
perceived as being genetically depauperate [18,19],
although it has recently been suggested that some rearedge populations may serve as reservoirs of unique
genetic variation [20]. The processes of persistence in
southern refugia during glacial maxima followed by
northward recolonization have led to a pattern of
“southern richness versus northern purity” [21-23],
where the majority of genetic variation is found in
populations that currently occupy previous refugial
areas, with a northward decrease in genetic diversity due
to progressive founder effects during the recolonization
process (but see [24-27]). Consequently, if rear-edge
populations are at particular risk of extinction due to
the effects of climate change, their loss may have a disproportionally detrimental impact on overall levels of
within-species genetic diversity, and such genetic erosion might compromise the long-term evolutionary
potential of impacted species [28]. Assuming that species will shift their ranges north in response to global
warming, genetically diverse southern edge populations
of temperate species may be at the greatest risk of
extinction, whereas cold-adapted species that might
have persisted in more northerly refugia [24-27] could
conceivably retain a larger proportion of their genetic
diversity since this variation may not be concentrated in
low latitude populations.
The aim of the present study was to use a combined
phylogeographic and species distribution modelling
approach to compare the glacial histories of two plant
species, Orthilia secunda (one-sided wintergreen) and
Monotropa hypopitys (yellow bird’s nest). Both species
belong to the Monotropoideae and have largely overlapping ranges in Europe (Figures 1A and 1B), as well as
being found in North America, where they both exhibit
disjunct east/west distributions. O. secunda is generally
found in boreal forests, whereas M. hypopitys is usually
associated with more temperate tree species and thus a
comparison of the two should provide insights into the
relative effects of climate change on a temperate species
vs. a boreal species. Phylogeographic analysis was carried
out to determine the distribution of genetic variation
across the range of each species and to test whether
both correspond to the “classic” model of high diversity
in the south, with decreasing diversity at higher latitudes, or whether the cold-adapted O. secunda might
retain more genetic variation in northern populations.

In addition, projected species distributions based on a
future climate scenario were modelled to assess how
changes in the species ranges might impact on total
intraspecific diversity in both cases.

Methods
Sampling and DNA extraction

Samples of Orthilia secunda and Monotropa hypopitys
were obtained from 35 and 19 locations respectively
throughout Europe (Tables 1 and 2). DNA was
extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy kit. For O. secunda,
206 individuals were sequenced for the chloroplast trnStrnG intergenic spacer, 154 individuals were sequenced
for the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region,
and 218 individuals genotyped for five nuclear microsatellite loci. For M. hypopitys, 100 individuals were
sequenced for part of the chloroplast rps2 gene, 100
individuals were sequenced for the nuclear ITS region,
and 111 individuals were genotyped for eight nuclear
microsatellite loci.
Species distribution modelling

Ecological niche modelling (ENM) was carried out to
determine suitable climate envelopes for O. secunda and
M. hypopitys in Europe for the LGM (ca. 18KYA), and
the year 2100 under a future climate scenario using the
maximum entropy approach implemented in the MAXENT software package (V3.2.1; [29]). Species occurrence
data were downloaded from the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility data portal (http://www.gbif.org),
totalling 14,221 and 8,829 occurrences for O. secunda
and M. hypopitys respectively. A principal component
analysis (PCA) was carried out on the 19 BIOCLIM
variables in the WorldClim data set [30] to remove correlated variables, since these can lead to overfitting of
the model. After removing variables that exhibited a
strong correlation (Spearman’s rank correlation >0.5;
[31]), three variables (P1 [Annual Mean Temperature],
P4 [Temperature Seasonality] and P14 [Precipitation
of Driest Period]) were used to generate ENMs at
2.5 minute resolution using MAXENT with the default
parameters for convergence threshold (10-5) and number
of iterations (500), and projected onto reconstructed
LGM data (Community Climate System Model [CCSM];
Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase
II: http://pmip2.lsce.ipsl.fr) to identify potential refugial
areas. The current climate envelope was also projected
onto climate grids corresponding to the same three bioclimatic variables in the year 2100 under the National
Centre for Atmospheric Research general circulation
model (CCM3 model) that simulates double CO2 emissions [32]. Duplicate records from the same locality
were removed to reduce the effects of spatial autocorrelation. Presence thresholds were determined using the

Molecular genetic analyses - M. hypopitys

100 individuals were sequenced for a section of the chloroplast rps2 gene. Primers were designed from GenBank
sequence accession number AF351956 (Bidartondo and
Bruns 2001): MH-rps2-F 5’-TTCGCCGATTTAGTATCACG-3’ and MH-rps2-R 5’-GGGATTCCCAAAGTAATACATTCTA-3’. PCR and sequencing were carried out
as described in [34].
100 individuals were sequenced for a section of the

Three additional loci developed using the ISSR-cloning

1 pmol of tailed forward primer, 10 pmol reverse

and genotyping was carried out on an AB3730xl capillary genotyping system. Allele sizes were scored in
GENEMAPPER V4.1 (Applied Biosystems) using ROX500 size standards and were checked by comparison
with previously sized control samples.
Data analysis

Alignments were constructed using BIOEDIT (V7.0.9.0)
[40] for the O. secunda chloroplast trnS-trnG intergenic
spacer and nuclear ITS, and for the M. hypopitys chloroplast rps2 and nuclear ITS. Length variation at any
mononucleotide repeat regions was removed, since the
bidirectional mutation model operating at such regions
can give rise to homoplasy [41]. The alignments were
used to construct statistical parsimony networks using
the TCS software package (V1.2.1) [42]. Where reticulations were present in the networks, these were broken
following the rules described in [43].

Tests for linkage disequilibrium between pairs of
microsatellite loci in each population were carried out
in the program FSTAT [44]. Levels of genetic diversity
were calculated for populations with a sample size of
N ≥ 4. Gene diversity (H) based on haplotype frequencies for the O. secunda chloroplast trnS-trnG region and
nuclear ITS, and the M. hypopitys chloroplast rps2 and
nuclear ITS, and observed and expected heterozygosity
(HO and HE) based on nuclear microsatellite allele frequencies were calculated using the ARLEQUIN software
package (V3.01) [45]. Population structuring based on
the microsatellite data was determined using the
STRUCTURE software package (V 2.2) [46]. Five independent runs were carried out for all values of K, the
number of clusters, between 2 and 20. The program was
run each time using 50,000 burn-in iterations followed
by 500,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations, and
the most likely value of K was determined using the ΔK
statistic [47].

Results
For all models, the area under the receiver operating
curve (AUC) statistic was consistently higher than 0.95,
indicating good performance.
Distribution modelling for O. secunda and M. hypopitys at the LGM indicated extensive areas of suitable
habitat for both species in southern Europe (Figures 1C
and 1D). For O. secunda, two of the French populations
(FRSA and FRCE), one of the Swiss populations
(CHVA) and the two populations from Montenegro lay
within the suitable climate envelope indicated by the
ENM. None of the M. hypopitys populations studied lay
within the suitable climate envelope indicated by
the ENM.
The future distribution model indicated an extensive
loss of suitable habitat for O. secunda relative to the
modelled current climate envelope (Figure 1E), particularly in northern central Europe (Figure 1G). The majority of the suitable remaining habitat in southern Europe
would be largely restricted to the mountainous regions
of the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Carpathians and the Dinaric Alps. For M. hypopitys, the model indicated a general
northward shift in the species’ distribution, with a loss
of suitable habitat in southeastern Europe but an
increase in northern Europe, particularly in Scandinavia
(Figures 1F and 1H).

were unique to a single individual. The three most common haplotypes exhibited a general north-south split,
with the Haplotype 2 (yellow) found predominantly in
southern populations whilst northern populations contained primarily the two blue haplotypes (Haplotypes 1
and 3). Two populations contained all three of these
haplotypes: the FRCE population (France) and the
SKMP population (Slovakia). The fourth non-unique
haplotype, Haplotype 4 (green), was found in a single
individual in both the ATST1 (Austria) and the SELO
(Sweden) populations.
The 475 bp nuclear ITS alignment contained five distinct haplotypes (Table 3; Figure 3; GenBank sequence

found elsewhere.
No significant linkage disequilibrium was detected
between pairs of microsatellite loci after sequential Bonferroni correction. Between 16 and 30 alleles were
detected at the five loci studied (mean = 20.20) and
levels of expected heterozygosity (H E ) calculated for
populations with a sample size of N ≥ 4 ranged from
0.400 (IECG [Ireland]) to 0.839 (NOOS and NOSE
[both Norway]), with a mean value of 0.677 (Table 3;
Figure 4). The STRUCTURE analysis of the microsatellite data indicated that the most likely number of
genetic clusters was K = 2 (Figure 5).

are increasingly using multiple genetic markers and/or
palaeodistribution modelling to draw more reliable
inferences on population history. The results of the
paleodistribution modelling and the patterns of genetic
variation revealed by the phylogeographic analyses suggest that both Orthilia secunda and Monotropa hypopitys persisted throughout the LGM in Europe in
southern refugia. Although both species generally exhibited a “southern richness vs. northern purity” distribution of genetic variation [21], this was more pronounced
in the temperate M. hypopitys, where the only populations that displayed any within-population genetic variation for both the chloroplast rps2 and nuclear ITS

regions were located closest to the modelled refugial
areas. Northern populations of O. secunda were more
diverse, but the signatures of refugial areas i.e. high
diversity coupled with unique haplotypes [27] were
restricted to southern populations.
Based on the weight of evidence across modelling and
the different markers used, our findings indicate a possible refugial area for O. secunda in Europe located in the
vicinity of the French Alps. A second area of high diversity and endemic haplotypes included the Austrian Alps
and Slovakia, but these populations lie outside the suitable climate envelope indicated by the palaeodistribution
model. Nevertheless, although the precise locations of
putative refugia are difficult to identify accurately, it is
clear that the majority of genetic diversity is contained
in southern populations. The occurrence of a fixed
endemic ITS haplotype in one of the Estonian populations (EENN) more likely represents a relatively recent
mutation that has become fixed through genetic drift,
rather than indicating an extreme northern refugium.
For M. hypopitys, the modelling and genetic data both
indicated a likely refugial area in southeastern Europe.
The identification of two genetic clusters with a broadly
northern/eastern vs. southern/western geographical distribution for both species based on microsatellite data
could indicate isolation in separate refugia followed by
differential recolonization after the retreat of the ice
[24].
Many studies have used modelling approaches to
determine the effects of present and future climate
change on the distribution ranges of plant species (e.g.
[50-52]). We can extend this approach to investigate the
potential effects of such distribution changes on intraspecific genetic diversity. The future modelled distributions of both O. secunda and M. hypopitys indicate
substantial changes in the ranges of both species. For
M. hypopitys in particular, these changes could have a
profound impact on the genetic diversity of the species
in Europe. Previous studies have suggested that range
contraction during previous phases of climate change
was characterized by population extinction, rather than
migration [6,53]. Although the future model indicates a
range expansion at the northern edge, it also suggests
extensive loss of suitable habitat in southeastern Europe.
Given that this area represents the centre of genetic
diversity for the species, extinction of these populations
would lead to massive loss of genetic diversity since
more northerly populations are genetically depauperate
relative to populations in the southeast. A northern
expansion of the species’ range would not counter this,
because the leading edge colonization would be from
these low-diversity northern populations. Northern
populations of O. secunda, however, tended to be more
genetically diverse than those of M. hypopitys.

Beatty and Provan BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/29

Consequently, the loss of southern and central European
O. secunda populations indicated by the species distribution model would not have the same overall effect on
total intraspecific genetic diversity across the continent.
Nevertheless, although the populations from the species’
centres of diversity in the French and Austrian Alps
would still lie within the future modelled climate envelope, this would most likely be as a result of altitudinal
migration, since the mountain ranges of southern and
eastern Europe represent the only climatically suitable
areas in the region. Whilst altitudinal migration offers
some short-term potential for countering the effects of
climate change [54-57], its scope is ultimately limited
[58]. The situation in Europe is somewhat different
from that in North America, where the occurrence of
northern refugia for both species means that a lower
proportion of the total genetic diversity in the continent
is concentrated in southern populations [[34], Beatty &
Provan, unpublished results] and thus the impact of loss
of rear-edge populations might not be as extreme. It
should also be borne in mind that models of future
(and, indeed, past) climate are not guaranteed to be
100% accurate, and that many other factors such as
changes in species tolerances through adaptation and
species-species interactions will also determine species
current and future ranges. Nevertheless, at least in Europe, the adverse encroachment of human activity on the
boreal and temperate woodlands that form the natural
habitat for these species, coupled with the fact that climate is changing faster now than at any time in the
past, means that the impacts on the gene pools and subsequent adaptive potential of these, and possibly many
other species, are likely to be potentially serious.

Conclusions
Both Orthilia secunda and Monotropa hypopitys appear
to have persisted through the LGM in Europe in southern refugia. The boreal O. secunda, however, has
retained a larger proportion of its genetic diversity in
more northerly populations outside these refugial areas
than the temperate M. hypopitys. Given that future species distribution modelling suggests northern range
shifts and loss of suitable habitat in the southern parts
of the species’ current distributions, extinction of genetically diverse rear edge populations could have a significant effect in the rangewide intraspecific diversity of
both species, but particularly in M. hypopitys.
