Diversity of sponge mitochondrial introns
revealed by cox 1 sequences of Tetillidae
Amir Szitenberg1, Chagai Rot1,2, Micha Ilan1, Dorothée Huchon1,3*

Abstract
Background: Animal mitochondrial introns are rare. In sponges and cnidarians they have been found in the cox 1
gene of some spirophorid and homosclerophorid sponges, as well as in the cox 1 and nad 5 genes of some
Hexacorallia. Their sporadic distribution has raised a debate as to whether these mobile elements have been
vertically or horizontally transmitted among their hosts. The first sponge found to possess a mitochondrial intron
was a spirophorid sponge from the Tetillidae family. To better understand the mode of transmission of
mitochondrial introns in sponges, we studied cox 1 intron distribution among representatives of this family.
Results: Seventeen tetillid cox 1 sequences were examined. Among these sequences only six were found to
possess group I introns. Remarkably, three different forms of introns were found, named introns 714, 723 and 870
based on their different positions in the cox 1 alignment. These introns had distinct secondary structures and
encoded LAGLIDADG ORFs belonging to three different lineages. Interestingly, sponges harboring the same intron
form did not always form monophyletic groups, suggesting that their introns might have been transferred
horizontally. To evaluate whether the introns were vertically or horizontally transmitted in sponges and cnidarians
we used a host parasite approach. We tested for co-speciation between introns 723 (the introns with the highest
number of sponge representatives) and their nesting cox 1 sequences. Reciprocal AU tests indicated that the intron
and cox 1 tree are significantly different, while a likelihood ratio test was not significant. A global test of cophylogeny had significant results; however, when cnidarian sequences were analyzed separately the results were
not significant.
Conclusions: The co-speciation analyses thus suggest that a vertical transmission of introns in the ancestor of
sponges and cnidarians, followed by numerous independent losses, cannot solely explain the current distribution
of metazoan group I introns. An alternative scenario that includes horizontal gene transfer events appears to be
more suitable to explain the incongruence between the intron 723 and the cox 1 topologies. In addition, our
results suggest that three different intron forms independently colonized the cox 1 gene of tetillids. Among
sponges, the Tetillidae family seems to be experiencing an unusual number of intron insertions.

Background
Mitochondrial introns are self-splicing, selfish and mobile
genetic elements [1-3]. The mobility of these introns is
often facilitated by homing endonucleases (HEs) that are
encoded within the introns [4,5]. Mitochondrial introns
are rare in Metazoa. Both group I and group II introns
have been described. Group II introns are the least frequent. They have only been found in Placozoa [6] and in
an annelid worm [7]. Group I introns have been found in
several unrelated Cnidaria (e.g. [8-11]), Porifera (e.g.

[12,13]), and Placozoa (e.g., [6]). As a case in point,
Tetilla sp. SP25456 (Spirophorida, [12]) and Plakinastrella onkodes (Homosclerophorida, previously identified
as Plakortis angulospiculatus [13], D. Lavrov personal
communication) are the only two sponges found to possess mitochondrial introns, although 22 complete mitochondrial genomes, representing a wide demosponge
diversity, have already been sequenced [13-17]. A recent
study of the Lebanon sponge fauna suggests that Tetilla
sp. SP25456 should be synonymized with Cinachyrella
levantinensis [18]. To confirm this view we sequenced a
1650 bp fragment of the 18S rRNA for both a Tetilla sp.
sample from Israel and a C. levantinensis sample from

Lebanon (Additional file 1). The same sequence was
obtained for both samples. Consequently, we use here
the name C. levantinensis, rather than Tetilla sp.
SP25456.
The C. levantinensis cox 1 intron was found to be
1,138 bp long [12]. Unfortunately, the cox 1 sequence of
C. levantinensis is not complete. Using the complete cox
1 sequence of Amphimedon queenslandica [19] as reference, the C. levantinensis intron was found to be
inserted after position 723. This intron encodes a putative LAGLIDADG protein. In P. onkodes two group I
introns were found in the cox 1 gene but their secondary structures were not provided [13]. These introns are
388 bp and 1,118 bp in size, and are separated by 9
nucleotides (3 codons). The second intron of P. onkodes
is inserted at the same position as the intron reported
for C. levantinensis [13]. This intron and its counterpart
in C. levantinensis share 81.2% nucleotide sequence
identity, have a similar secondary structure, and contain
LAGLIDADG ORFs. By contrast, they share only ~43%
sequence identity with the first intron of P. onkodes,
which does not contain any ORF [13].
We have previously shown that the C. levantinensis
intron was more closely related to fungi introns than to
any animal intron known at that time [12]. Hence we
suggested that the presence of this intron in a sponge
may be the result of a horizontal gene transfer event
between fungi and sponges [12]. Based on a later discovery of a highly similar intron inserted at the same position in 20 scleractinian corals of the suborder Faviina
[9] and in the sponge P. onkodes [13], Fukami et al. [9]
and Wang & Lavrov [13] concluded, in contrast to our
hypothesis, that this intron had most likely been transmitted vertically in cnidarians and sponges, but independently lost in most lineages. However, no statistical
analyses were conducted in those studies, and it is thus
difficult to determine which hypothesis is better supported by the data. Interestingly, using reciprocal Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) tests, a Bayes factors test for
incongruence, and a non-parametric version of Huelsenbeck and Bull’s likelihood ratio test, Goddard et al. [10]
showed that another intron, not related to the C. levantinensis intron and inserted at a different position, was
horizontally transferred among actinarian cnidarians.
In order to better understand the origin and evolution
of sponge mitochondrial introns we determined the cox
1 gene of 15 tetillid sponges and present statistical evidence that the C. levantinensis intron was both horizontally and vertically transferred in animals.

Results
Presence of mitochondrial introns and insertion sites

Fifteen new and two existing tetillid cox 1 sequences
from four genera were considered in our analysis:

Page 2 of 12

Cinachyrella (9 specimens/6 species), Craniella (five
specimens/4 species) Paratetilla (one specimen) and
Tetilla (two specimens/two species). To avoid bias we
only considered sequences that included all the insertion
site positions of both the previously discovered and
newly discovered tetillid introns. However, since we did
not amplify complete cox 1 sequences, introns present
at the beginning (the first 108 - 156 bp are missing,
depending on the sequence) or at the end of the gene
(the last 615 - 1074 bp) would not be detected by our
study. The complete cox 1 sequence of the sponge
A. queenslandica was used as reference for numbering
positions in the alignment. The use of reference
sequence allowed a comparison of insertion sites
between cox 1 CDSs of different lengths, as well as
between partial and complete sequences. Among the 15
new sequences only five were found to possess a longer
cox 1 sequence, most probably indicating the presence
of introns. Only the Cinachyrella alloclada sample was
found to have an 1140 bp long insertion after position
723. This insertion is similar in length and insertion site
to those previously found for the intron of C. levantinensis and the second intron of P. onkodes (introns 723,
Figure 1). All other insertions are shorter and inserted
at different positions of the alignment. Two Cinachyrella sp. samples from Zanzibar as well as the Cinachyrella sp. 3743 sample from Australia (which probably
belongs to the same species), have a 985 bp long insertion that is inserted after position 714 (introns 714,
Figure 1). This insertion site is similar to that of the
first intron of P. onkodes. Finally, the Tetilla radiata
sample has a 948 bp long insertion that is inserted after
position 870 (intron 870, Figure 1). Interestingly, the
introns present in the cnidarians Palythoa sp. and Savalia savaglia are also inserted at this position. A BLASTX
analysis [20] of the inserted sequences allowed us to
identify a single LAGLIDADG ORF in each insertion.
Intron secondary structures and sequence similarity

All inserted sequences were found to fold into the canonical group I intron secondary structure, confirming
that the insertions are indeed introns. However, not all
introns had the same secondary structure. Three different secondary structures, corresponding to introns 714,
723 and 870, were reconstructed from the five
sequences (Figure 2). Introns 723 are represented in
sponges by the introns of C. levantinensis, C. alloclada
and the second intron of P. onkodes. They are characterized by an absence of P2 as well as large P6 (69-96 bp)
and large P9 (113-116 bp) regions (Figure 2b, [12]).
Introns 714 were identified in the three Cinachyrella sp.
samples from Zanzibar and Australia. The first intron of
P. onkodes was also identified as an intron 714. These
introns are characterized by an absence of P2 and P9 as

sponge A. queenslandica was used as reference for numbering positions in the alignment.

well as the presence of a large loop (>10 bp) in their P1
structure (Figure 2a). It should be noted that the
Cinachyrella sp. and P. onkodes intron 714 structures differ in their P5 region, which is longer in Cinachyrella sp.
Finally, an intron 870 was only found in the T. radiata
sequence (Figure 2c). This last intron is characterized by
the presence of a P2 and a longer P5 than other sponge
introns. In all introns most of the LAGLIDAGD ORF is
located in the loop associated with the paired region P8.
Each LAGLIDADG ORF was found to contain at least
one UGA codon. This codon corresponds to a stop
codon in the standard genetic code but to tryptophan in
the “mold, protozoan, and coelenterate” mitochondrial
code (i.e., the demosponge mitochondrial code), refuting
the possibility of a nuclear origin for the introns. It is
worth noting that most mitochondrial genetic codes
could code for a LAGLIDADG sequence. It is thus not
possible to determine the origin of the intron based on a
genetic code. High sequence similarity exists among the
introns inserted at the same position. The percentage of
identity ranges from 85 to 99% between two sponge
introns inserted at the same position, and from 43 to
53% between introns with different insertion sites.

was unrooted (Figure 3). The first intron of P. onkodes
was not included in this analysis since it lacked an ORF.
The LAGLIDADG sequences of sponges belonged to
three unrelated clades corresponding to the different
insertion sites and secondary structures, which suggest
that the LAGLIDADG ORFs were transmitted with their
introns. Interestingly, not only the clade comprising the
ORFs of introns 723 (cf. [9,12,13]) but also the clade
comprising the ORFs of introns 870 included cnidarian
representatives (i.e., the corals Palythoa sp. and S. savaglia [11], which had an intron inserted at the same position as T. radiata). The clade comprising the ORFs of
introns 714, in contrast, was not found to be related to
any cnidarian sequence. Another unrelated animal clade
included only cnidarian sequences. The LAGLIDADG
sequences of this clade originated from introns inserted
at position 888. Goddard et al. [10] studied the co-phylogeny of the LAGLIDADGs encoded within introns 888
and their host.
None of the animal LAGLIDADG sequences were
found to be closely related (i.e. similarity below 65%) to
any fungi or plant sequence.
The cox 1 phylogeny

The LAGLIDADG phylogeny

To identify the evolutionary relationships of the LAGLIDADG sequences encoded within the three intron
forms, as well as their putative origin, a phylogenetic
tree was reconstructed based on the LAGLIDADG protein sequences encoded within sponge introns together
with similar sequences identified by a BLASTP search
[21] (see Methods section). The endonuclease ORF
encoded within the intron and the intron section that
takes part in creating the intron’s secondary structure
can have different histories [1]. In this analysis, the section of the intron involved in creating its secondary
structure was excluded. Consequently, the phylogenetic
result allowed us to establish whether the LAGLIDADG
sequences encoded within introns of similar structure
and insertion sites are closely related. The resulting tree

To identify whether closely related introns were hosted
by closely related sponges, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on cox 1 sequences (Figure 4) using the
maximum likelihood (ML) criterion under the TrN + Γ +
I model and Bayesian analyses under the CAT + Γ4 siteheterogeneous model [22]. The monophyly of Tetillidae
was recovered with maximum support (Bayesian posterior probability: PP = 1.0; and ML bootstrap percentage:
BP = 100). In contrast, most of the represented tetillid
genera were found to be paraphyletic. More specifically,
the representative of Paratetilla was found to be closely
related to Cinachyrella species. Similarly, the sequences
of Tetilla leptoderma and Craniella sp. 3878 were found
to be more closely related to each other than to other
representatives of their respective genera. These observations indicate the need for a closer examination of the

Tetillidae phylogeny, using additional markers and a larger taxon sampling. Surprisingly, cox 1 sequences possessing introns did not always cluster together. While the
three Cinachyrella spp. specimens possessing introns 714
formed a monophyletic clade, C. alloclada and C. levantinensis, which possessed introns 723, belong to distant
lineages.
Co-speciation between cox 1 sequences and their nesting
LAGLIDADG sequences

In order to examine whether the sponge introns were
transmitted vertically, we checked for co-evolution
between cox 1 coding sequences (CDSs) and intron
sequences (the sequences included both the LAGLIDADG and the non-coding regions involved in the

intron secondary structure) nesting within the cox 1
genes. Such methods are usually used to explore cospeciation between two organisms (e.g., host - parasite
relationship). In the case of cox 1 sequences and their
introns it is indeed possible to consider the introns as
parasites of the cox 1 genes. Since in Tetillidae we have
three unrelated “parasitic” introns (714, 723, 870), the
history of each intron should be considered separately.
Because only a few species were found to possess an
intron 714 or an intron 870, our co-speciation analyses
were only based on introns 723. The cox 1 and intron
723 sequences of 20 corals and three sponges possessing
such introns were considered in these analyses.
Following Goddard et al. [10], we first conducted tests
of competing evolutionary hypotheses. More specifically,

using reciprocal approximate unbiased (AU) tests we
evaluated, for each data set separately whether the likelihood scores obtained under the intron ML topology
(Figure 5a) were significantly different from the likelihood scores obtained under the cox 1 ML topology gene
(Figure 5b). Both the cox 1 and the intron data sets
reject the H0 hypothesis that the two genes could share
the same topology (p < 0.001).
Because reciprocal AU tests are more adapted when
node support is high [10] we also applied a non-parametric version of Huelsenbeck and Bull’s likelihood
ratio test for detecting conflicting signals [10,23]. Like
the AU tests, the LRT test assumes an identical phylogeny for the cox 1 and LAGLIDADG genes. However, in
this test both data sets are not considered separately.
The test computes the difference between the likelihood
scores obtained when both data sets have different
topologies (’two trees model’) and the likelihood scores
obtained when both data sets have the same topology
(’one tree model’). This difference is then compared to a
null distribution generated by non-parametric bootstrapping (see Methods). Unlike the AU tests, the likelihood
ratio test does not reject the H 0 hypothesis that the
one-tree hypothesis (both genes have the same topology)
is favored over the two-tree model (each gene has a
different topology), although marginal significance is
observed (p = 0.072; out of the 500 replications
performed 36 were found to have a smaller loglikelihood ratio statistic than the original data set,
Additional file 2).
The fact that the reciprocal AU tests reject the
hypothesis of co-phylogeny and that the LRT test is

marginally significant indicates the presence of at least
one incongruent node between the LAGLIDADG and
cox 1 trees. These results support the hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer of introns. However they do not
exclude the possibility that in some clades a vertical
transmission is the most likely hypothesis. We therefore
also conducted a global test of co-evolution, as well as a
test on each host parasite link, using the program
ParaFit [24]. In this approach, matrix permutations are
used to compare cox 1 and intron patristic distances.
The analysis is thus unconstrained by the phylogenetic
tree. Unlike the AU and likelihood ratio tests, the null
hypothesis in ParaFit is that the host and parasite phylogenies are randomly associated, and thus that both data
sets assume a different topology. Hence, a significant
p-value indicates the existence of at least one congruent
host-parasite link between the LAGLIDADG and cox 1
trees. In such a case, the tests on each host parasite
link allow us to identify the co-speciating host-parasite
pairs. This test revealed that the global co-speciation
parameter, was significant (p < 0.001), albeit low (ParaFitGlobal = 0.0047). Only 3 out of 23 pairwise cospeciation links examined were significant, and again
the link values were low (0.0019 < ParaFitLink1 < 0.002,
0.001 <p < 0.006). These three significant links represented the relationships between each of the sponges
sampled and their intron sequences. When these three
taxa were removed from the analysis, the global test
indicated no co-speciation (ParaFitGlobal = 0.00001, p >
0.05). The ParaFit result thus suggests that intron 723
could have been vertically transferred in tetillid and
homoscleromorph sponges. However, this result is most

probably an artifact due to the fact that only three
sponges, belonging to different distant classes, were considered in this analysis. In support of such an idea, it is
worth noting that the two tetillid LAGLIDADG proteins
are closer to the cnidarian sequences than to the homoscleromorph sequence (PP = 0.98, BP = 80, Figure 3).
The latter result contradicts the current view that
sponges are either monophyletic [25] or that homoscleromorphs are closer to cnidarians [26]. It seems thus
more appropriate to explain the distribution of intron
723 in homoscleromorphs and tetillids by at least two
independent transfer events. However, we cannot
exclude the possibility that this intron has been vertically transmitted in tetillids.

Discussion
Mitochondrial introns are rare among metazoan organisms. Surprisingly, more than a fifth of the Tetillidae
species considered in our study (4 species out of 13)
were found to possess mitochondrial introns. This indicates an unusually high number of introns within this
family. More surprisingly, our findings pointed to the

existence of three different introns within the tetillid
family. Indeed, each intron form has a different insertion
site and secondary structure, and the LAGLIDADG they
encode belong to unrelated clades.
There are two characteristics that might explain the
presence of introns in tetillid sponges. First, sponges,
similar to cnidarians, have a slower mitochondrial evolutionary rate than bilaterians [14,27]. This slow evolutionary rate has been suggested to facilitate the
proliferation of group I introns since their splicing
depends on the conservation of a rather large sequence
of nucleotides (n > 20) [28,29]. Second, the transmission
of genetic material is not restricted to the germline in
tetillids due to their regeneration capacity [30] and budding ability [31,32]. Therefore, an intron acquired in any
somatic cell has the potential to be transmitted to future
generations. Interestingly, although not all members of
the phylum Porifera reproduce asexually, homoscleromorphs, the second sponge lineage known to possess
mitochondrial introns, also have a budding capacity [33].
Our results suggest that the family Tetillidae is a hot
spot for the presence of group I introns in animals.

Szitenberg et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:288
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/288

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that introns
might be overlooked in other sponge lineages. Indeed,
two of the discovered introns are located within the
reverse primer that has been recommended for the
amplification of the barcoding region of the cox 1 gene
in sponges [34]. As a case in point, Cárdenas et al. [35]
failed to amplify the cox 1 sequence of C. alloclada
using those primers, whereas we successfully amplified
this species using different primers. This suggests that
“standard” barcoding primers might not be adapted for
the sponge and cnidarian species that share introns 714
and 870. It is therefore likely that other sponge lineages
might contain mitochondrial introns, in particular those
with a budding ability, for example, members the genus
Tethya [36,37].
Two main scenarios can explain the distribution of
these introns: one includes only vertical transmission
while the second incorporates events of horizontal
transfers. A scenario that includes only vertical transmission, as suggested by Wang & Lavrov [13], would
imply that the ancestor of sponges and cnidarians possessed no less than four different introns in its cox 1
sequence (Figure 3). The fact in favor of this hypothesis
is that both introns 723 and 870 are shared by sponges
and cnidarians. However, no species has been found to
possess all four introns. Except for P. onkodes which
possesses introns 714 and 723, all other individuals with
introns in their cox 1 sequence possess only a single
intron. Since tetillids belong to the largest group of
demosponges (the G4 clade, [38,39]), the hypothesis of a
vertical transmission of the introns implies a tremendous number of independent losses in most demosponge lineages, but not in Tetillidae, whose ancestor
retained three introns that were later independently lost
in most tetillid species. Clearly, this scenario is
improbable.
Various facts support instead the occurrence of horizontal transfer events within the mitochondrial genome
of sponges. First, group I introns are known to be invasive elements that independently colonized the mitochondrial genome of numerous plants and fungi [3].
Second, the reciprocal AU tests (or SH tests [10]) on
intron 723 (see Results) and intron 888 [10] support the
idea that the cox 1 and intron topologies are significantly different rejecting the hypothesis of co-phylogeny.
Based on the ParaFit results none of the host-parasite
link is significant within Faviina corals, supporting the
absence of co-phylogeny. The ParaFit results are not
affected by either the node supports or the topology of
the studied genes. It is possible that our ParaFit results
are affected by differences in molecular-evolutionary
rates between the two genes. Indeed, the cox 1
sequences of the coral Blastomussa wellsi and Physogyra
lichtensteini appear to have evolved at a faster rate than

Page 8 of 12

other coral species (Figure 5a), although this result
might be the consequence of a misplacement of the root
[9]. In contrast, the evolutionary rate of these four genera is not at odds with those of the other intron
sequences (Figure 5b). Such rate differences between cox
1 and LAGLIDADG could affect the ParaFit conclusions, if they are not the result of a different history for
each gene [40]. However, there are several points in
favor of true phylogenetic differences between the genes.
First, reciprocal AU-tests, which do not take branchlength into account, reject the hypothesis of co-phylogeny (the AU-tests are also significant in the absence of
sponge sequences, data not shown). Second, Fukami et
al. [9] noticed an incongruence between the cox 1 and
LAGLIDADG topologies and acknowledged the possibility of horizontal transfers in scleractinian. It is therefore
likely that the differences between the evolutionary rates
of cox 1 and LAGLIDADG indicate a different lateral
gene-transfer in Blastomussa wellsi and Physogyra
lichtensteini.
Finally, although the LAGLIDADG tree suggests that
the sponge and cnidarian introns have an ancient fungal
origin, the specific donor of the Porifera introns is still
unknown. No sequence except for cnidarian was found
to be closely related to any of the sponge introns. A
transfer from a cnidarian to a sponge or from a sponge
to a cnidarian, as first suggested by Fukami et al. [9],
appears unlikely in the case of Tetillidae since these
sponges are mainly found in sediment habitats [41] and
not in close proximity to corals. It is more likely that
the same donor (e.g., a fungus) was at the origin of the
sponge and cnidarian intron.

Conclusions
Our results support the suggestion that mitochondrial
introns are both horizontally and vertically transferred
in sponges and cnidarians. Given the absence of a complete phylogenetic resolution of the cox 1 and LAGLIDADG tree, the specific cases in which these introns
were horizontally versus vertically transmitted still
remain to be determined. Among sponges, the family
Tetillidae appears as a hot spot of intron insertions,
with three different intron forms present in different
individuals. Interestingly, two intron forms found in
sponges are closely related to cnidarian introns, suggesting that sponge and cnidarian introns might originate
from a similar donor. However, the mechanisms and the
donor at the origin of this transfer of genetic material
remain to be discovered.

PVP protocol [42]. The cox 1 sequences were amplified
using two step nested PCRs. The conditions of PCR
amplifications were: 94°C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 94°C
for 50 sec, 50°C for 50 sec, 72°C for 4 min; and a final
elongation at 72°C for 10 min. Different primer pairs
were used depending on the species considered. The list
of primer used and their sequences are indicated in
Additional file 4. Amplified fragments were directly
sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3100 (Applied Biosystems)
genetic analyzer. The sequences were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers HM032738-HM032752.
Characterization of the intron sequences

Intron insertion-sites were determined manually, based
on nucleotide and amino-acid alignments of cox 1
sequences. The core structure of the cox 1 introns was
determined with Citron [43]. Peripheral hairpin structures were predicted with Mfold [44,45] using default
setting. Finally, the graphic visualizations of the secondary structures were generated with RnaViz [46]. ORFs
were sought for within each intron sequence. For each
ORF identified, a BLASTX search [20] was conducted to
determine the protein family it belonged to, if any.
Phylogenetic reconstruction based on LAGLIDADG
protein sequences

Following Rot et al. [12], a LAGLIDADG dataset was
constructed using BLASTP searches. Each of the
LAGLIDADG sequences found in sponge introns was
used as query. This dataset included mostly fungi, as
well as plants, cnidarians and sponges. GenBank accession numbers are indicated in Figure 3. The protein
sequence alignment was conducted with the L-INS-i
algorithm under the JTT-200 substitution matrix, as
implemented in Mafft version 6 [47]. Due to the high
variability of the LAGLIDADG sequences, the use of
Gblocks [48] or Soap [49] to remove poorly aligned
region of the alignment, resulted in matrices less than
100 amino-acids (aa) long. The LAGLIDADG data set
was therefore corrected manually. Sections of the alignment with more than one third of missing data were
removed. Additionally, the 5’ region of the LAGLIDADG ORF which takes part in the folding of the
intron (i.e., the first 63 aa positions of the LAGLIDADG
alignment that correspond to the largest such region)
were removed as well. The final LAGLIDADG data set
included 217 characters; 3 of which were constant
(Additional file 5). All of the 214 variable characters
were phylogenetically informative. The reconstruction of
the tree was conducted with RAxML 7.0.4 [50] with 100
bootstrap repeats, under the CAT + Γ + I, and with
Phylobayes 3.2 [51] under the CAT model. The Phylobayes analysis included two chains with 18,100 cycles

Page 9 of 12

(3,400,000 generations) while 4,500 cycles were discarded as burnin. The maxdiff value of this run was
0.069.
Phylogenetic reconstruction based on cox 1 CDS

The cox 1 data set included the 15 DNA sequences
obtained as well as two tetillid sequences available in
GenBank. Since Astrophorida has been shown to be the
sister clade of Spirophorida (e.g. [38,39]), four astrophorid sequences were used as outgroup. Accession
numbers are indicated in Figure 4. A codon alignment
of the cox 1 sequences was obtained using the online
version of Pal2Nal [52]. The underlying protein reference data set was aligned using MAFFT version 6 [47]
with the L-INS-i algorithm. The program Gblocks [48]
was then used to exclude regions that were poorly
aligned. The nucleotides downstream to the intron
insertion site (i.e., 18 nucleotides after each insertion)
were also removed since co-conversion of cox 1 exonic
sequences can occur after intron insertion [53]. The cox
1 data set used in the phylogenetic analysis included
927 characters; 687 of them were constant and 303 had
missing data. Among the 240 variable sites 190 were
phylogenetically informative (Additional file 6). Phylogenetic reconstruction was conducted using both the maximum likelihood (ML) and the Bayesian approaches.
The ML tree was reconstructed with PAUP* 4 [54]
under the TrN + Γ + I model of sequence evolution and
using the tree bisection reconnection (TBR) branchswapping algorithm and 100 random sequence addition
starting trees. The TrN + Γ + I model was found to be
the best fitting ML model using Modeltest 3.7 [55].
Branch supports were estimated based on 100 bootstrap
repetitions. A Bayesian tree was reconstructed with Phylobayes 3.2c [51] under the GTR CAT model of
sequence evolution. The analysis included two chains
with a total run length of 13,000 cycles (490,000 generations) while 3200 cycles were discarded as burnin. The
maxdiff value of this run was 0.038.
Co-speciation between “host” (cox 1 coding sequences)
and “parasite” (introns 723)

Three different introns were found in sponges (see
Results section). However, co-speciation tests, between
intron sequences and their cox 1 host sequence, could
only be performed for intron 723. Other introns did not
include enough representatives, except intron 888,
which was already studied by Goddard et al. [10].
A total of 20 species of corals and three species of
sponges possessing intron 723 were considered. The
nucleotide data sets of each gene were aligned with
MAFFT version 6 [47] with the L-INS-i algorithm. After
manual removal of ambiguously aligned positions the
cox 1 and intron data sets were respectively 630 and

Szitenberg et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:288

1078 bp long (Additional files 7, 8. The program PAUP*
4 [54] was used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships based on cox 1 and intron sequences, and to
obtain the corresponding matrices of patristic distances.
The two ML phylogenetic trees were obtained using the
TBR branch-swapping algorithm under the best model
of sequence evolution identified by Modeltest 3.7 [55].
Three co-speciation tests were conducted. Following
Goddard et al. [10] the first approach was to compare
the ML topology of both genes under each data set.
Reciprocal approximate unbiased tests as implemented
in Consel 0.1i [56] were applied. The site-wise log-likelihoods were obtained using PAUP* 4 [54]. The second
approach was to perform a non parametric version of
Huelsenbeck and Bull’s likelihood ratio test [23]. This
test compares the log-likelihood L0 obtained under the
hypothesis that the cox 1 gene and the intron share a
single tree (each marker being allowed to evolve under
different model and branch-length parameters), with the
log-likelihood L 1 obtained under the hypothesis that
each data set evolved independently, resulting in different trees and sets of parameters. Computations were
performed with PAUP* under the GTR + Γ + I model
for both gene. The log-likelihood ratio statistic (d) is
defined as:

Page 10 of 12

1078 bp had different trees and different models of evolution. The third approach applied the program ParaFit
[24] to perform a global test of co-speciation (ParaFitGlobal) as well as local tests for each cox 1 - intron link.
Following the recommendation of the ParaFit manual,
the only parameter considered was ParaFitLink1. This
parameter is indeed more adapted when the global test
is significant but the local tests show a mixed trend.
The principle coordinates (PCOs) of the patristic
matrices were calculated with DistPCoA [58] using the
Lingoes correction.

d = 2(ln L 0 − ln L1)

The null distribution of d was obtained using nonparametric bootstrap. Five hundred bootstrap files were
generated separately for the cox 1 and the intron data
sets using Mesquite 2.72 [57]. Each cox 1 bootstrap file
was concatenated with one LAGLIDADG bootstrap file.
The cox 1 and intron sequences were then randomized
within each concatenated file using a Perl script
designed for this purpose. Three ML trees were constructed for each data set. The first was based on the
first 630 positions of the concatenated and randomized
matrix, the second on the last 1078 positions and the
third on the total matrix length (1708 bp). The tree
reconstructions were performed with PAUP* using
rounds of heuristic searches starting with a neighborjoining (NJ) tree and using tree bisection-reconnection
(TBR) branch-swapping. The initial model parameter
values were those estimated by Modeltest. After a first
round of heuristic search the parameters were estimated
on the resulting tree and then used for the subsequent
round of heuristic search. The process was repeated
until all parameters converged. Ln L0 was computed by
assuming that the first 630 bp and the last 1078 bp
shared the ML tree obtained using the whole data set
(albeit each partition was allowed to evolve under different model and branch-length parameters). Ln L1 was
computed by assuming that the first 630 bp and the last
