Abstract
Background: Endogenous retroviral sequences (ERVs) are integral parts of most eukaryotic
genomes and vastly outnumber exogenous retroviruses (XRVs). ERVs with a relatively complete
structure were retrieved from the genetic archives of humans and chickens, diametrically opposite
representatives of vertebrate retroviruses (over 3300 proviruses), and analyzed, using a
bioinformatic program, RetroTector©, developed by us. This rich source of proviral information,
accumulated in a local database, and a collection of XRV sequences from the literature, allowed the
reconstruction of a Pol based phylogenetic tree, more extensive than previously possible. The aim
was to find traits useful for classification and evolutionary studies of retroviruses. Some of these
traits have been used by others, but they are here tested in a wider context than before.
Results: In the ERV collection we found sequences similar to the XRV-based genera: alpha-, beta, gamma-, epsilon- and spumaretroviruses. However, the occurrence of intermediates between
them indicated an evolutionary continuum and suggested that taxonomic changes eventually will be
necessary. No delta or lentivirus representatives were found among ERVs. Classification based on
Pol similarity is congruent with a number of structural traits. Acquisition of dUTPase occurred
three times in retroviral evolution. Loss of one or two NC zinc fingers appears to have occurred
several times during evolution. Nucleotide biases have been described earlier for lenti-, delta- and
betaretroviruses and were here confirmed in a larger context.
Conclusion: Pol similarities and other structural traits contribute to a better understanding of
retroviral phylogeny. "Global" genomic properties useful in phylogenies are i.) translational
strategy, ii.) number of Gag NC zinc finger motifs, iii.) presence of Pro N-terminal dUTPase
(dUTPasePro), iv.) presence of Pro C-terminal G-patch and v.) presence of a GPY/F motif in the
Pol integrase (IN) C-terminal domain. "Local" retroviral genomic properties useful for delineation
of lower level taxa are i.) host species range, ii.) nucleotide compositional bias and iii.) LTR
lengths.

Background
Retroviral and related endogenous retroviral sequences
(ERVs) are integral parts of most eukaryotic genomes,

sometimes constituting over 50% of them [1]. Their ability to transpose and transfer horizontally [2,3], confers
genetic flexibility to complex genomes like those of

humans [4], chimpanzees [5], other primates and
vertebrates.
The origin of retroviruses is lost in a prebiotic mist.
Assuming a 0.2% neutral substitution rate per million
years [6] and a 50% divergence limit for nucleotide
sequence recognition, retroviral sequences >250 Million
years old cannot be found in current genomes. If any of
their genes are selected for, they may stay recognizable
longer. Thus, although the ERV record has limitations, the
reconstruction of retrovirus evolution differs fundamentally from that of other viruses, due to the ERVs in the ever
richer archive of genomic assemblies. According to the
VIIth ICTV report [7], Retroviridae borders to Pararetroviridae (e.g. Hepatitis B), Metaviridae (Gypsy-like) and Pseudoviridae (Copia-like). Together with the even more more
distant relatives Mal-R [8], DIRS [9] retrotransposons and
chromoviruses [10], not included here, they show that retroviruses are parts of a vast retrotransposon sequence universe. In this work, we concentrated on retroviruses. An
ancestral retrovirus likely had structural traits which at
present are common denominators of the diverse related
sequences. Although some structural traits may be absent
in individual viruses, readily identifiable common
denominators are 5'LTR, PBS, Gag (MA, CA and NC), Pro,
Pol, Env, PPT and 3'LTR [11]. The most universal trait is
the pol gene, with its reverse transcriptase (RT), RNAse H
and integrase (IN). The use of other conserved but distinguishing traits in phylogenetic inference and retroviral
classification discussed here are: nucleotide bias, number
of zinc fingers, translational strategy, C-terminal Pro and
Pol motifs, presence of dUTPase and accessory genes and
LTR length. Env is an unreliable evolutionary marker,
exemplified by the hybrid betaretroviral MPMV [11], but
can be useful in narrow phylogenies to demarcate a specific group.
Retroviral taxonomy has traditionally been based on
observed phenotypic qualities of exogenous retroviruses
(XRVs) [7]. Classification using ERVs, with an almost
complete lack of phenotypic information, necessitates a
nucleotide sequence analytical approach. Seven retroviral
genera have been described (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta, epsilon-, lenti- and spuma-like retroviruses) using
sequence similarities, mainly in the Pol RT region.
Although much work remains before all ERVs are fully
characterized, ERVs have also been divided into loosely
defined classes, originally based on HERVs [12-14]. When
analyzing the RT region, the gammaretroviruses cluster as
class I and betaretroviruses as class II elements [12]. The
spuma- and spumalike elements group within the class III
[14]. Lenti- and deltaretroviruses have no known endogenous counterparts [15]. This was also the case in our
computerized genomewide screenings (see below).

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/50

ERV classification and grouping originally was based on
sequence similarity between the proviral PBS and the host
tRNA [11]. This classification has proved useful for some
ERVs, e.g. HERV-E [16] and mostly for HERV-H [17].
However, it is inconsistent for many other ERV groups
that have alternative PBSes [18] e.g. HERV-H/F [17], ERV3
[16], and ERV9/HERV-W [19]. We did not extend these
analyses here.
In several papers [[17,20] and Jern et al. submitted], we
have used Pol similarity for ERV classification. Pol is
highly conserved, and its large size (800–1100 aa) provides adequate information for a relatively detailed classification. This is facilitated by the program RetroTector©
[Sperber G.O. et al. in preparation], which reconstructs
probable Pol proteins ("puteins") from different reading
frames in the often damaged gene candidates. The puteins
are favored over nucleotide sequences since they are more
conserved, easier to align and therefore allow phylogenetic inference and taxonomy over greater evolutionary
distances. This is further discussed in the Methods and
Results sections of this paper. A number of reliable distinguishing features must be defined to enable a durable retroviral taxonomy which can encompass the many new
ERVs and XRVs, and to trace their evolution. In this study,
we compared phylogenetic trees, based on Pol similarity,
with distinct structural features of possible use as taxonomic and phylogenetic markers.

Results and Discussion
Genomic ERV collection
Using the program RetroTector© (see methods), we
screened the human hg16 [4] and chicken gg01 [21]
genomes for ERVs. We found them to encompass 3149
and 260 proviral sequences with a RetroTector© score of
more than 300, respectively. A detailed account will be
published separately [Blomberg J. et al. in preparation].
Based on experience from randomized data set scores
(data not shown), this threshold separated false from true
retroviral elements with a wide margin. We collected the
sequences into an ERV databank, from which we extracted
representative sequences for use in matching structural
traits against sequence similarity based phylogenetic
inference. Sequences scoring over 300 from the hg16 and
gg01 genomes were analyzed for the presence of Pol.
Those with a recognizable Pol were grouped into respective genera according to sequence similarity (Table 1).
ERVs were found in all retroviral genera, except lenti- and
deltaretroviruses. Our bioinformatic screening of a larger
dataset thus confirmed the results of Herniou et al. [15].
As genomic assemblies from more species become available, analysis of upcoming retroviral sequences will
increase the precision of phylogenetic inference and retroviral taxonomy.

Phylogenetic reconstruction based on Pol
Using the whole Pol proteins/puteins retrieved from the
genetic archive, we reconstructed an unrooted retroviral
neighbor joining (NJ) tree. We used the whole Pol and the
principle of pairwise deletions in the alignment and distance matrix analyses to avoid problems with missing portions in RT as in e.g. the large HERV-H group [17]. To
reconstruct a comprehensible condensed phylogeny, we
chose to include only 12 representative ERVs from the
human hg16 [4], chimpanzee pt01 [5] (collected and analyzed earlier [Jern et al. submitted]) and chicken gg01 [21]
genome assemblies. The human and chicken sequences
were chosen because they are diametrically opposite representatives of vertebrate retroviruses (including over
3300 proviruses). The representative ERVs from chimpanzee (one BaEV like and one PTERV1 like [3], not found in
humans [Jern et al. submitted]) were included to provide a
broad based phylogeny. The remaining representative
ERVs, all with high RetroTector© scores, were selected to
contribute with different aspects, e.g. intermediate positions in the tree, while still keeping the size of the Pol tree
manageable. Annotated exogenous retroviruses retrieved
from GenBank were added to form a tree backbone structure useful for taxonomic reference (Figure 1). The Pol NJ
(500 bootstrap consensus) tree structure was confirmed
using an array of maximum likelihood (ML) analyses
(data not shown). The wealth of mutated ERV sequences
sometimes makes delineation of genera and groups difficult. We have earlier used the Pol similarity (>80%) based
clustering as a primary criterion for retroviral groups
[16,17]. This corresponds to the finer branches of the genera (Figure 1), which themselves tend to have internal Pol
similarities over 60% (Additional file 1). The phyloge-

netic Pol tree shows the seven retroviral genera, defined
from clustering of ERVs next to the earlier classified XRVs
(see bootstrap supports in NJ tree, additional file 1), and
the three loosely defined ERV classes [12-14] (Figure 1).
Further, the tree shows two major branches, ending in
gamma- and betaretroviruses, respectively. They consistently have very high bootstrap supports (Additional file
1). The continuous influx of new data will eventually
necessitate a revision of the retroviral genera. This was out
of scope for the present study. An especially amorphous
part of the tree is its center. In numerous phylogenetic
analyses with a sequence set (not shown here), we found
that the spuma-like group referred to here, includes both
the exogenous spumaviruses and a diverse group of
related endogenous retroviral sequences (primarily ERVL). These and other centrally located elements often are
highly mutated and difficult to analyze. Further, the tree
(Figure 1) shows ERV and XRV sequences intermediate
between the major genera. In the left major branch (the
main "gamma" branch), Snakehead retrovirus (SnRV) is
intermediate between epsilon and spumalike retroviruses.
In the main "beta-branch", several chicken ERVs and the
reptilian Python RV [22] are intermediate between the
previously recognized delta, lenti, alpha and betaretroviruses, supporting a gradual evolution of betaretroviruses
from delta/lenti and alpharetrovirus-like ancestors.
Host species
Although host species is not a structural feature, it is an
easily definable trait, and is therefore discussed here. Retroviral classification using host species is at first sight
appealing: Classical gammaretroviruses are murine, epsilon piscine, alpha avian and beta mammalian. However,

as seen in figure 1, this order is not maintained when
additional XRVs and ERVs are included. It has been shown
that some avian retroviruses share similarity with human
gammaretroviral (class I) HERV-I elements [23], and
probably are the results of horizontal transfers [15]. In our
screening, we confirmed these avian HERV-I like elements
and also show a novel avian sequence extracted from the
chicken genome that is similar to HERV-E (Figure 1). Further, it has been shown that piscine elements grouped
together with some human elements [15]. In a recent bioinformatic study, we found human epsilon-like proviral
elements [19]. One of them was included into the phylogeny (Figure 1). Transspecies transfers between vertebrates
have been discussed repeatedly [15,22,23]. Indeed, the
genomes of the two vertebrate species used here encompass ERVs clustering with five retroviral genera, indicating
widespread cross-species transmissions (Figure 1). Several
such horizontal transmission events have been described
for gammaretroviruses [[3] and Jern et al. submitted] and
lentiviruses [2]. Although co-evolution with the host (vertical transmission) is the dominant mode of retroviral
transmission, occasional horizontal transmissions make
the host species an often unreliable taxonomic marker.
Gag zinc fingers
In addition to Pol, the Gag is also suitable for structural
analysis. It is relatively conserved and has well documented functional domains for retroviral RNA packaging,
assembly and budding [24-30]. Analysis of the nucleocapsid (NC) from the different genera showed a difference in
number of zinc finger motifs, involved in the retroviral
RNA interaction [26,28]. Two zinc fingers were detectable
in lenti-, alpha-, beta-, epsilon- and some gammaretroviruses (the HERV-H group), whereas the remaining gammaretroviruses had only one, and the spuma-like HERV-L
and spumaviruses themselves had none (Figure 2A). The
gammaretroviral MLV has a charged amino acid segment
upstream of the zinc finger. Recently, we demonstrated
that this feature appears to gradually have replaced the
loss of the second NC zinc finger in the MLV like group
[31]. In the extended data set used here, we could also see
that the intermediate SnRV has only one zinc finger (Additional file 2), an indication of several zinc finger loss
events. Spumaretroviruses and their related sequences,
present in vertebrates and reptiles [15], stand out as structurally different. They have no zinc fingers. They have a
separately spliced pro ORF and a relatively low Pol similarity (47.1–61.8%) to other retroviruses. Because most
other retroviruses and related viruses (Gypsy and Copia)
have NC zinc fingers, it is likely that the spuma-like elements lost theirs. The sequences of the main "beta"
branch all have two NC zinc fingers. Aside from this "global" aspect, the uneven distribution and various numbers
of NC zinc fingers in the comprehensive sequence collec-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/50

tion (Figure 2A), makes the zinc finger trait useful for
group delineation rather than for general taxonomy.
Translational strategy
In order to produce differing amounts of the different retroviral proteins, the retrovirus may either use i.) ribosomal frameshifting, ii.) nonsense codon readthrough or
iii.) splicing, as translational strategies. Well studied
gamma and epsilonretroviruses have a distinct genomic
structure where a gag-pol transcript with one ORF is produced [32]. The env transcript is a result of splicing activity, a general strategy for all retroviruses. However, the
distantly related Errantivirus Cer1, which has all genes in a
single ORF (Additional file 2), may possibly represent an
original retroelement translational strategy without splicing. A single large polyprotein is also used by some other,
even more, distantly related RNA viruses e.g. Picornaviruses. The difference in degree of Gag and Pol expression
is regulated by a stop codon suppression readthrough
after gag [11]. This genomic structure is shared with the
closest related epsilon and even the intermediate epsilonlike SnRV. Mining in our collected ERV databank, we
selected sequences with high RetroTector© scores and analyzed their "putein" reading frames. However, definition
of the original proviral ORFs is difficult because of the
gradual accumulation of postintegrational indel mutations. To minimize such errors, we excluded sequences
with predicted frameshifts near the 3'-end of the respective gene and only included ERVs with RetroTector© scores
over 1000, thus ensuring a relatively intact provirus.
Results from the remaining 436 elements are shown in
table 1. In the gammaretroviral genus (RetroTector©
defined using motif similarities to known exogenous, and
endogenous, gammaretroviral counterparts), we could
detect ERVs with not only the predicted lack of
frameshifts, "0 f.s.", but also "-1 f.s.", and "+1 f.s." in the
Gag-Pro, and Pro-Pol boundaries (Table 1). However, "0
f.s." between Gag and Pro was detected in 67%, while "+1
f.s." and "-1 f.s." were detected in 16% and 17%, respectively. In the Pro-Pol boundary there were 46%, 31% and
23% for "0 f.s.", "+1 f.s." and "-1 f.s." respectively (Table
1).

Thus there is a propensity, however weaker in Pro-Pol, for
gammaretroviral ERVs to enclose their Gag, Pro and Pol in
the same reading frame. As a comparison, the analyses of
exogenous gammaretroviral FLV and MLV genomic structures are also shown (Additional file 2 and [11]). They are
known to use the stop codon suppression mechanism in
a single gag/pro/pol ("0/0") frame. Although this analysis
could not be performed for the few rather damaged epsilon-like HERVs [19], the epsilon retrovirus, WDSV, and
the epsilon/spumalike intermediate also shared the single
gag-pro-pol frame translational strategy with gammaretroviruses (Additional file 2 and [11]).

The betaretroviral ERVs have been described to have a different translational strategy [11]. There were 60% (-1 fs),
22% (0 fs) and 17% (+1 fs) in the Gag-Pro boundary.
Between Pro and Pol there were 51% (-1 fs), 22% (0 fs)
and 27% (+1 fs) (Table 1). Thus the betaretroviral ERV
frame shift propensities, however weaker between Pro
and Pol, agree with the predictions according to the
related exogenous MMTV and JSRV (Additional file 2)
with the Gag, Pro and Pol in different reading frames separated by "-1" frameshifts, a "-1/-1" pattern. This translational strategy is also recognized in the new intermediate
betalike group of chicken and reptiles. We also found that
the results ("-1/-1") for chicken alpha ERVs (Table 1) deviated somewhat from the expected "0/-1" pattern (see
exogenous RSV in additional file 2 and [11]). The computer aided analysis of the exogenous delta and lentiretroviruses conformed with previous descriptions [11]. HIV had
"-1/0", whereas HTLV had "-1/+1" in the Gag-Pro and
Pro-Pol boundaries, respectively (Additional file 2). To
summarize, we find support for similar translational strategies among ERVs and XRVs, although ERV sequences are
harder to analyze due to postintegrational frameshifts.
Further, two major directions in the Pol phylogeny could
be noted (Figure 1). The viral sequences in the left main
branch, the "gamma" branch, often have their gag, pro and
pol within the same reading frame. Genera in the right
main "beta-branch" (Figure 1), with gag, pro and pol separated in different ORFs, may use different forms of ribosomal frameshifting [11]. Despite the imprecision of
reading frame predictions in ERVs (Table 1), we judge
inferred translational strategy to be a "global" marker. It is
especially suitable for distinction between the extremes of
the major gamma and betaretroviral branches in figure 1.
Presence of dUTPase
A dUTPase that prevents incorporation of uracil into the
retroviral DNA by dUTP degradation, can be advantageous for some retroviruses. A dUTPase was, in compliance with earlier results [33,34], detected by RetroTector©
in both betaretroviruses and non-primate lentiviruses
(Figure 2B). However, the localization of the dUTPase differs between the genera. Non-primate lentiviral dUTPase
is located within the pol gene (here dubbed dUTPasePolA)
[11], whereas the betaretroviral dUTPase is located N-terminal of Pro (here dubbed dUTPasePro). A third dUTPase
acquisition event (Additional file 3. Here dubbed dUTPasePolB) in MuERV-L [35,36], is located C-terminal of IN.
In the ERV dataset, dUTPasePro was detected in 363
betaretroviral ERVs and 21 intermediate beta-like(alphabeta) chicken ERVs (Table 1). Thus, many of the chicken
intermediate beta-like ERVs lacked detectable dUTPase.
Neither could it be found in the intermediate Python ERV
(Figure 2B). dUTPasePolB was not tested for.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/50

To investigate the different retroviral acquisitions of dUTPases, we conducted a minimum evolution (ME) analysis,
using 389 dUTPase sequences (Additional file 3). The ME
tree shows that human betaretroviral dUTPasePro (HML110; [20,37] and Blikstad et al, in preparation) and chicken
alphabetaretroviral dUTPasePro (GGERVAB1-14; Blomberg et al, in preparation) form one branch together with the
more studied mammalian betaretroviral MMTV and
MPMV dUTPasePro sequences. This indicates that dUTPasePro has a monophyletic origin and was acquired by an
alpha-like retrovirus, earlier in evolution than previously
suggested (see [38]), just before or during the formation
of betaretroviruses, see figure 2B. The absence of dUTPase
from the betaretrovirus like non-mammalian Python retroviruses [22] is in approximate accord with this interpretation. Judging from the ME tree, acquisition of
dUTPasePolA (by non-primate lentiviruses) and dUTPasePolB (by the spumalike ERV-L) may also have been single
events (Additional file 3). The validity of the detected
dUTPases is illustrated by the consensus sequences of the
conserved motifs, DSDYxGEIQ, IAQLilD and GGFGST
(Additional file 4).
Nucleotide frequency bias
RNA editing, dependent on encapsidation of a host RNA
editing enzyme, creates a combination of phenotypic and
genotypic traits. In lentiviruses, the host enzyme
APOBEC3G is responsible for G to A hypermutation, thus
generating an A bias [39]. Although manifested in the retroviral genotype, the nucleotide bias can thus be the result
of a phenotypic trait. Nucleotide biases were previously
also demonstrated in delta- and betaretroviruses [40].
Using the ERV dataset and the additional XRVs, we confirmed this for lentiviruses, delta- and a subset of gammaretroviruses (Figure 2C), while the spuma-like genus did
not show obvious biases [31,40]. Recently we described a
group of human gammaretroviral ERVs, the HERV-H-like
and adjacent HERV-H- like branching together close to the
gammaretroviral root (Figure 2C), to have a uniquely
strong G/C bias [31]. In analogy with the lentiviral bias, it
is reasonable to assume that HERV-H-like sequences also
met an innate antiretroviral defense involving a host RNA
editing enzyme. However, the mechanism is unknown
and must be different from the cytidine deamination
caused by APOBEC3G. Mutational bias caused by the
error-prone reverse transcriptase (for a review, see [41])
can also not be ruled out. Reverse transcriptase of different
retroviruses has in vitro shown different mutational biases
[42]. It has been discussed as a contributing factor for the
observed skewed nucleotide composition [43].
C-terminal Protease G-patch domain
Several RNA-binding proteins include a glycine rich
domain of about 48 amino acids called "G-patch". This
was also present in a betaretroviral MPMV protease C-ter-

Retrovirology 2005, 2:50

minal domain [44]. In self-processing, this domain has
been reported to be cleaved from the Pro as a separate protein [45]. The role of this small protein is not determined,
but participation in the transport of unspliced retroviral
mRNA (see [46]), was suggested [44]. Recently, G-patch
was indeed shown to bind single stranded RNA [47]. Further, this G-patch has proved useful in phylogenetic studies, but has shown some inconsistency [48]. In order to
extend the phylogenetic investigations and to determine if
G-patches are present in other retroviral genera than the
described mammalian betaretroviruses, we analyzed the
ERV collection for detectable G-patch in the Pro C-terminal domains (Additional file 4). We found 68 positive
ERVs (table 1), exclusively within the betaretroviral genus
(Figure 2D). Irregularities [48] were also apparent in our
Pol phylogeny (Figure 2D), where a G-patch was either
degenerated or missing in three of the betaretroviruses,
hence uncolored. The validity of the detected G-patch
motifs is evident from the consensus sequence,
GYx2GxGLGx4GxnG (Additional file 4). An interesting
observation was that dUTPasePro occurs in avian beta-like
intermediate ERVs (Figure 2B), but without the G-patch
(Figure 2D). In fact, no chicken betaretrovirus had a
detectable G-patch, while dUTPasePro was often readily
detectable. From these data, and those of others [48], we
conclude that G-patch entered the genus betaretrovirus
after dUTPasePro and that presence of G-patch may be a
useful marker for mammalian betaretroviruses, independent of dUTPasePro.
C-terminal polymerase IN motif
The C-terminal end of retroviral Pol integrases (IN) has
interesting features. Its terminal position allows for addition of functional modules without disturbing the basic
integrase functions, represented by the HHCC zinc finger
and the DD35E catalytic domains. Alterations in this Cterminal IN domain may alter the specificity of the integration [49]. The C-terminal domain sometimes contains
the motif GPY/F (Additional file 4 and [50]). To this
domain, another "chromo" (chromatin-binding) domain is sometimes appended [50], which interacts with
chromatin via DNA-binding proteins [49,51]. Recently,
we showed that HERV-H and ERV3 have GPY/F-domains
[16,31]. Here we used our ERV collection to extend the
analysis. We found 264 ERVs with GPY/F motifs (Table 1).
A larger portion had a similar mutated, but still detectable, C-terminal IN region (data not shown). An extended
consensus GPY/F motif of the ERVs was computed, WxnGPyxV (Additional file 4). Its typical sequence demonstrates the validity of the detected GPY/F motifs. All these
ERVs were gammaretroviral. No betaretroviral element
was detected with this domain (Figure 2D). Further, GPY/
F motifs were found in epsilon, delta, lenti and errantiviruses (Figure 2D). Thus, in figure 2D, we can demarcate a
line where GPY/F, or mutated remnant motifs, can be

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/50

detected to the left, from the lentiviral branch towards
gammaretroviruses, in analogy to how the translational
strategies (see above) separated the Pol tree into two
major branches.
Accessory genes
The presence of accessory genes in complex retroviruses
can also be used for evolutionary inference (Figure 3).
Recognition of unknown accessory genes is a difficult bioinformatic problem and absence of accessory genes is
hard to ascertain. The analysis therefore rests on demonstrable ones. The delta and lenti genera have several accessory genes with similar functions as integral parts of their
replication strategy. They can to some extent replace each
other; rex and rev, tax and tat [11]. The sometimes drastic
influences of these trans-activating gene products on cellular functions may have kept these viruses out of the germline. Recently, the betaretroviral HERV-K(HML2) was
shown to have the accessory genes, rec and/or np9 [52,53],
and is thus a complex retrovirus. rec is at least functionally
related to rev and rex [54]. Also the epsilon (WDSV) and
spumaretroviruses have accessory ORFs, Orf1, 2 and 3,
and Bel etc., respectively [11]. The phylogeny of accessory
genes (see [55]) is a separate issue, which we do not study
further here. From the available information, the accessory genes mainly contribute to rather local properties in
the retroviral tree.
LTR lengths
As a final point in the conceptual use of structural traits in
phylogenies, a brief exploration of LTR lengths showed a
significant difference between the most distantly related
gamma and beta genera, where gammaretroviral LTRs are
short and betaretroviral LTRs significantly longer (Figure
3). LTR length is therefore a useful additional property for
the distinction of these genera.

Conclusion
Inferring phenotypic traits and phylogenies from interpreted genotypic (sequence) ERV properties is similar to
the use of fossilized remains for similar purposes in paleontology. The analysis will gather strength with increasing
numbers of analyzed host genomes. Pol similarities and
structural traits like the ones discussed here, contribute to
a better understanding of the retroviral phylogeny. There
are at least two major retroviral branches. One contains
the gammaretroviruses (including class I ERVs) together
with the epsilonretroviruses, and another which includes
betaretroviruses (including class II ERVs) together with
delta, lenti and alpharetroviruses with their respective
intermediate groups. In between, closer to an imaginary
root of the retroviral evolutionary tree, we find the older
spuma and spuma-like (class III ERVs) retroviruses. The
two major branches, schematized in figure 3, differ in
"global" genomic properties as i.) translational strategy,

The branch for Gypsy and Copia represent an imagined midpoint reference in the tree. The number of NC zinc fingers, presence of dUTPase (dUTPasePolB is not indicated), known accessory genes, C-terminal Pro (G-patch) and Pol (GPY/F) motifs are
shown. Nucleotide bias was defined to 25 ± 5 %. (↑) shifted upwards; (↓) shifted downwards; (≈) uncertain bias. Exploration of
the LTR lengths of the different groups as detected by RetroTector© are shown as boxplots. In addition, the translational strategy may be used in the phylogeny to separate the gammaretroviruses (including class I ERVs) from spuma-like elements (class
III ERVs), deltaretroviruses, lentiviruses, alpharetroviruses and the betaretroviruses (class II ERVs) with respective intermediate
groups. The Gypsy and Copia are not included in the translational strategy analysis.

Endogenous retroviral sequences
We used the bioinformatic program RetroTector©, developed by us, to screen the downloaded genomic sequences
for proviral integrations. Briefly, the program recognizes
conserved retroviral consensus motifs and constructs
putative proteins ("puteins") from the different reading

Page 9 of 12

Retrovirology 2005, 2:50

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/50

frames in the gene candidates. Codon statistics, frequency
of stop codons and alignment to known retroviral proteins are used to approximate an original ORF. Finally the
puteins are validated and classified using alignments of
earlier described proteins from the literature. The validity
of the puteins used for alignment and phylogenetic inference, can be confirmed by inspection of excised parts of
RT and IN from the full Pol alignment (Additional file 5).
The program yields a preliminary genus classification
based on motif usage. In several papers, the computerized
motif based preliminary retroviral classification was
shown to be consistent and robust with reference to other
means of classification [16,17,19]. Using a RetroTector©
cutoff score of more than 300, we found 3149 proviral
sequences in the human genome version hg16 [4] and
260 proviral sequences in the chicken gg01 [21], which
were included into our ERV databank. From this databank, we could extract representative proviral sequences
for later analyses. The extracted representative sequences
had high RetroTector© scores and were selected for their
contribution to phylogenetic reconstruction, with preference for intermediates between previously recognized retroviral genera (see figure. 1)

HERVs Human endogenous retroviral sequences

Data analysis
Multiple alignments were conducted using ClustalX
(1.83) [56]. A consensus NJ was produced in MEGA2.1
[57] using the pairwise deletion option, Poisson amino
acid correction and 500 bootstraps. A set of maximum
likelihood analyses using the PHYLIP program package
[58] were used to verify the tree topologies. Consensus
analysis of C-terminal Pro (G-patch) and Pol (GPY/F)
motifs were conducted using WebLogo at http://webl
ogo.berkeley.edu/, with default settings
