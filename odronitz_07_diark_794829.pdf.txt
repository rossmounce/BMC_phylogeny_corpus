Abstract
Background: The number of completed eukaryotic genome sequences and cDNA projects has
increased exponentially in the past few years although most of them have not been published yet.
In addition, many microarray analyses yielded thousands of sequenced EST and cDNA clones. For
the researcher interested in single gene analyses (from a phylogenetic, a structural biology or other
perspective) it is therefore important to have up-to-date knowledge about the various resources
providing primary data.
Description: The database is built around 3 central tables: species, sequencing projects and
publications. The species table contains commonly and alternatively used scientific names, common
names and the complete taxonomic information. For projects the sequence type and links to
species project web-sites and species homepages are stored. All publications are linked to projects.
The web-interface provides comprehensive search modules with detailed options and three
different views of the selected data. We have especially focused on developing an elaborate
taxonomic tree search tool that allows the user to instantaneously identify e.g. the closest relative
to the organism of interest.
Conclusion: We have developed a database, called diArk, to store, organize, and present the most
relevant information about completed genome projects and EST/cDNA data from eukaryotes.
Currently, diArk provides information about 415 eukaryotes, 823 sequencing projects, and 248
publications.

Background
Since the publication of the first complete genome
sequence of an eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1], the
genome sequencing community has produced highly
advanced drafts of many other eukaryotes. The past few
years have thus seen the rise of a completely new field in
biology that is described as comparative genomics [2]. Initial results have shown that whole genome comparisons
are important to improve the annotation of genes and
transcripts of a genome. It has also been demonstrated

that not only genome sequences of organisms spread over
all kingdoms of eukaryotic life are needed but also many
of closely related organisms [3]. These results have lead to
the Fungi genome initiative representing the widest sampling of genomes from any eukaryotic kingdom, the
mammalian genome project aimed to expand the genome
coverage of mammals, and the Drosophila species sequencing project intended to establish methods for comparative
genomics among other things. Thus, it is evident that

future sequencing efforts have to include both further taxonomic sampling and closely related organisms.
In many research areas it is important to have access to
DNA data and DNA samples of as many organisms as possible. For example, in structural biology there is a strong
tendency to also work with homologs of other organisms
to enhance the chance of obtaining structural data
because cloning and protein expression are not as time
consuming as they were some years ago [4]. Reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between species or proteins is another expanding topic and it is clear that the
addition of further sequence data improves the significance of the analyses by enhancing the statistics and therefore limiting the negative effects of outliers [5].
Two main databases provide access to lists of completed
and ongoing eukaryotic genome projects. The Genomes
OnLine Database (GOLD [6]) presents information on
sequencing projects sorted according to the three major
lineages of the tree of life. In addition, GOLD distinguishes between published and ongoing projects but lists
some of the completed and not yet published genomes
with the published projects. GOLD also contains some
limited information about genome sizes, GC contents,
and contact persons. The International Sequencing Consortium (ISC [7]) has established a web-site to provide upto-date information about eukaryotic genome sequencing
projects of member institutions. The list also provides
information about the sequencing product, the strategy
applied and a proposed timetable. Both databases list all
funding agencies, the sequencing centers, and very basic
taxonomic information about all species. However, the
taxonomic information is that limited that the user cannot identify for example the closest homolog to his organism of interest. In addition, only a very limited amount of
alternative scientific names and no common names are
provided, and there is also only a limited number of links
to access the primary data.
Here, we present the web-interface to diArk (digital ark)
providing information on eukaryotic sequencing projects
that resulted either in at least preliminary assemblies of
genome data or a substantial amount of EST or cDNA
data. In the center of the database are extensive speciesrelated information (commonly and alternatively used
scientific names, common names, and complete taxonomies) and much information about the respective species
sequencing projects. Apart from the up-to-date status of
the data our focus has been on a feature rich user interface
with comprehensive and easy-to-use search capabilities.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/103

Construction and Content
Technologies
The system is running on UNIX (OS X and Linux) systems.
The database management system is PostgreSQL [8]. As
web application framework we chose Ruby on Rails [9]
since it has the advantage of rapid and agile development
while keeping the code well organized. Part of this framework is an implementation of Active Record [10] which is
an O/RM (Object-relational Mapping) system making
database integration into an object oriented program considerably easier.

The web pages are generated as XML. The site makes extensive use of Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) in
order to present the user with a feature rich interface while
minimizing the amount of transferred data. All technologies used are freely available and open source.
Database
The unique requirements of the system demand a custom
database schema (Additional file 1). At the center of the
database are three interconnected tables: species, projects
and publications (see additional file 1: Database schema).
The species table holds all information about the different
scientific and common names, so that every species can be
found even when the user does not know the exact scientific name. A comment field may contain general information about the corresponding species, the specific strain
used, or common and divergent features compared to
closely related organisms. Each species record is linked to
a tree-like data-structure representing its taxonomy.
Through this hierarchical tree, it is possible to easily select
sets of species in the same taxon. The maintenance of the
taxonomy tree is an automated procedure, which is triggered by the database upon insertion of new species. A
delegation server receives messages from the database and
starts a script to update the taxonomy tree.

The projects table contains details concerning a specific
sequencing effort, such as its type (genomic DNA or EST/
cDNA) and a link to the web-page providing the primary
data. The term completeness is intended to describe the
coverage of the genome. In this respect, EST/cDNA data is
always incomplete as most genes are either only partially
or not at all covered. Genomic sequencing is thought to be
complete if a certain quality and coverage of the assembly
is reached. Genome sequences with low assembly coverages (<3×) and/or short assembled contigs (a few kbp) do
not provide enough information to reconstitute even
medium sized genes and are also considered incomplete
(e.g. the mammalian 2 × coverage sequencing projects).
Each project may be assigned to a reference, a term we use
for the large-scale sequencing centers (e.g. the DOE Joint
Genome Institute) or community species homepages (e.g.
FlyBase). However, for many species, the sequence infor-

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:103

mation is not available via a dedicated species home page
but only via GenBank. Therefore the "GenBank" links provide BLAST search forms including the corresponding
database (some data is only available from the WGS,
other from the EST database) and the corresponding species name. The projects table is always linked to a species
and, in case they exist, to one or more publications.
The publications table stores all relevant information
about a publication like author, title, year and journal. We
included publications that refer to specific cDNA datasets
(e.g. the large scale cDNA sequencing of the nematodes),
or that refer to the first description of the genome
sequence (e.g. the publication of the Osterococcus tauri
genome). These interconnected sets of species, projects
and publications form the base of the search function. For
example, searching for a species also returns projects and
publications. Data entry is done using the iiwi system
(Odronitz F., Lampetsdoerfer T., Dietrich D., unpublished
results [12]) allowing for remote editing and access control.

Utility and Discussion
Hundreds of sequencing projects have been started in the
past few years and thus the number of projects offering
access to first assemblies is increasing rapidly. However, a
database providing access to the primary data (genomic
DNA or cDNA/EST data) of all sequenced organisms does
not exist. For example, the DOE Joint Genome Institute
provides access to 23 completely sequenced eukaryotes
via dedicated species project pages and the data for
another 3 eukaryotes via ftp server. However, the assembly data of only 9 species have already submitted to NCBI,
although the data of another one has already been published. At NCBI, there are two possibilities to BLAST
against genomic assembly data: directly using e.g.
TBLASTN choosing the WGS database or by selecting one
of the genomicBLAST tables. However, the supposedly
complete table of eukaryotic genomes does not include
the plant genomes. There are also strong discrepancies
between the WGS database and the assemblies available
via genomicBLAST. The WGS database contains 145 species while the genomicBLAST tables list only 130 organisms of which 2 are redundant. Missing species in the
genomicBLAST tables comprise for example the fish Gasterosteus aculeatus, the plants Ricinus communis and Populus
trichocarpa, and the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis.
Even more complicating, both databases often provide
different assembly versions of the genomes (e.g. v3 of the
Apis mellifera genome in the WGS database and v4.1 via
the genomicBLAST tables). These numbers show that
there is a strong need for a universal database providing
access to all the different sequencing projects.

diArk has been developed to store, organize and present
information about sequencing projects, that have either
produced preliminary or final assemblies of genome data,
or that have resulted in substantial amounts of EST or
cDNA data. The aim was to provide the best overview possible about the different projects so that researchers get
easy access to the primary data to increase for example the
taxon sampling in their phylogenetic analyses. Altogether,
diArk provides links to 209 genome assemblies and to the
EST/cDNA data of 291 species (as of 12-Dec-2006). diArk
does not include species for which only sequence reads
are available. Given the already existing amount of completed genomes and the accumulated know-how in the
sequencing centers it would not be reasonable for single
researchers to build their own assemblies. We decided to
not include those species until at least a draft assembly is
available. Next to be up-to-date and complete, the most
important requirement for diArk is a powerful and easy to
use search tool.
Web Interface
Great attention has been paid to a versatile yet easy to use
web interface. We think that accessibility and high quality
representation is key to a productive usage of the system.
diArk encompasses a live web front end that is generated
from the content of the database at each request and thus
always reflects the current data. The database is searched
using modules that can be combined in chains. There are
five different modules each providing specific options: a
module for the full-text search in all species names, a taxonomy search module, a module to select specific groups
of species, a module to search sequencing project related
data, and a publication search module. A search can consist of any combination of modules and their options. By
adding further search modules the user can successively
refine the search and narrow down the result list. For each
module the resulting selection of species, projects and
publications is shown, providing additional context. If a
new module is added the options available will be
restricted by the selection from the previous modules. At
any time, the search options for every module can be
changed and modifications are propagated down the
chain reapplying previous user actions.

Species can be searched for in two ways. The full-text
search module provides an autocompletion input field to
search the list of scientific and common species names.
The taxonomy search module offers tables containing specific subsets like a selection of major taxa or a range of
model organisms. In addition, this module provides a taxonomic tree representation for the selection of taxa and
species. Taxa and species can be browsed and selected by
expanding/collapsing and including/excluding subsections of the tree, or by using shortcuts or auto-completion
fields. If the dataset has been restricted by previous mod-

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:103

ules (e.g. the selection of a specific reference), excluded
species and taxa are disabled in the tables.
All searches can be saved and re-run. The searches are
saved purely as instructions on how to search the database. This means that if the underlying data has changed
since the last run, the options set by the user will be reapplied to the data, possibly resulting in a different set of
results. Based on this mechanism, we implemented an
alert service that is running saved searches on a regular
basis and alerts the user by email as soon as the results
have changed. This enables highly customized searches to
be re-run automatically in order to monitor a specific subset of the data.
Web Services
In order to make our data available programmatically to
other researchers we implemented a web service that supports XML-RPC and SOAP. The methods allow a remote
program to retrieve the full data on species, publications
and projects as well as the relations between different
types of records. Additionally we offer a method that is
equivalent to the auto-completion of the interface: When
a string is given as an argument, the web service returns an
array of species-IDs where the string occurs in any one of
the name fields. We also make available a range of methods related to taxonomy: Taxonomy records (currently
1906), their respective children and parent as well as all
species within a taxon can be retrieved. For any given species an array of taxonomy records representing their
ancestry is available.

With these mechanisms we enable other programmers to
conveniently construct complex queries on diArk's interconnected data without knowing about the internals.
Case Study
Alice wants to see which Arthropoda genomes have
already been sequenced (Figure 1). In the taxonomic
search module all species are listed regardless whether
only cDNA or genomic DNA data is available. Therefore,
she would have to first select "genomic DNA data" in the
projects module. Afterwards Alice could either browse
through the taxonomic tree to the Arthropoda and the
underlying species or select the Arthropoda from the tax
table (Figure 1A) and view all contents in the species
result view (Figure 1B).

Bob wants to know whether platypus has already been
sequenced, and if a genome assembly exists, to see the list
of web-sites to get access to the genome data. By typing
"plat" into the species autocompletion form of the species
names search module (or the taxonomy search module)
he finds that the scientific name of platypus is Ornithorhynchus anatinus and that there is another hit with Anas

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/103

platyrhynchos (Figure 1C). Having selected Ornithorhynchus anatinus Bob may either choose to view the complete information connected to this organism by choosing
the species view, or to view only the list of links to
sequencing projects in the project view (Figure 1D).
Related Work
There is only one other serious compilation of genome
sequencing projects, the GOLD database [6]. GOLD comprises data of all three major lineages of life, the bacteria,
the archaea and the eukaryotes. GOLD lists 674 eukaryotic sequencing projects (genome and cDNA sequencing)
of which 44 are marked as published and another 13 as
completed of which 4 are not publicly available. In comparison, we have found 209 genome projects (161 completed, 62 published) and included them in diArk. The
major focus of GOLD seems to list all funded and ongoing
sequencing projects so that researchers and sequencing
consortia get an overview and help in the decision about
new target species. Therefore, GOLD includes a very thorough compilation of the corresponding species sequencing centers, the funding agencies, and contact persons. On
the other hand, the taxonomic information in GOLD is
very limited, only a few alternative scientific names are
listed and no common names are provided. In addition,
only a limited number of direct links to the assembly data
are given. Another major drawback of GOLD is being
incomplete and not up-to-date. For example, 15 % of the
links associated with eukaryotic sequencing projects do
not work (397 of 2644 total). In addition, many projects
are still listed as "incomplete" although assembly data
became available years ago and the genomes have been
published. In contrast, the focus of diArk is to provide
access to already existing genome assembly data and large
cDNA/EST databases. This should enable researchers
interested in comparative genomics, phylogeny, any other
topic requiring taxonomic sampling, and single gene studies to get immediate access to most of the eukaryotic data
available worldwide.
Future Developments
At the moment, it is not planed to include species data
from the other two domains of life, the bacteria and the
archaea, although diArk provides the framework for an
easy expansion. Instead, we plan to extend diArk's current
eukaryotic data content and its technical basis. From the
user perspective it would be advantageous to obtain more
information about the data availability and the usability
of the various project web-sites. In addition, we intend to
include some sequencing related data like assembly versions and coverage that will help the user to judge the different datasets. On the technical site, we plan to provide
an undo function for any search as well as a general email
alert for updated database content.

Distribution of genome sequencing and cDNA/EST projects over major branches of eukaryotic life
Distribution of genome sequencing and cDNA/EST projects over major branches of eukaryotic life. The numbers of sequencing projects for some major branches of eukaryotic life are shown. The charts show the bias towards certain
branches originating from the various large-scale sequencing efforts. The total number of cDNA/EST and genome projects
exceeds the number of species in diArk because for some species both data are available.

Dec-2006; Figure 2). There are striking differences
between the two diagrams: Due to large-scale efforts
cDNA/EST data has been produced for many nematodes
and plants while only a few of these species have been
sequenced on a genomic basis. In contrast, the comparative genomic programs on fungi and protozoa pathogens
have resulted in many complete fungi and apicomplexa
genomes.
