Abstract
Background: The DExD/H domain containing RNA helicases such as retinoic acid-inducible gene
I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) are key cytosolic pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) for detecting nucleotide pathogen associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) of invading viruses. The RIG-I and MDA5 proteins differentially recognise conserved
PAMPs in double stranded or single stranded viral RNA molecules, leading to activation of the
interferon system in vertebrates. They share three core protein domains including a RNA helicase
domain near the C terminus (HELICc), one or more caspase activation and recruitment domains
(CARDs) and an ATP dependent DExD/H domain. The RIG-I/MDA5 directed interferon response
is negatively regulated by laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) and is believed to be
controlled by the mitochondria antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), a CARD containing protein
associated with mitochondria.
Results: The DExD/H containing RNA helicases including RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 were analysed
in silico in a wide spectrum of invertebrate and vertebrate genomes. The gene synteny of MDA5
and LGP2 is well conserved among vertebrates whilst conservation of the gene synteny of RIG-I is
less apparent. Invertebrate homologues had a closer phylogenetic relationship with the vertebrate
RIG-Is than the MDA5/LGP2 molecules, suggesting the RIG-I homologues may have emerged
earlier in evolution, possibly prior to the appearance of vertebrates. Our data suggest that the RIGI like helicases possibly originated from three distinct genes coding for the core domains including
the HELICc, CARD and ATP dependent DExD/H domains through gene fusion and gene/domain
duplication. Furthermore, presence of domains similar to a prokaryotic DNA restriction enzyme
III domain (Res III), and a zinc finger domain of transcription factor (TF) IIS have been detected by
bioinformatic analysis.
Conclusion: The RIG-I/MDA5 viral surveillance system is conserved in vertebrates. The RIG-I like
helicase family appears to have evolved from a common ancestor that originated from genes
encoding different core functional domains. Diversification of core functional domains might be
fundamental to their functional divergence in terms of recognition of different viral PAMPs.

Background
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are crucial to animal
surveillance of pathogen invasion. The PRRs recognise
conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern
(PAMP) motifs, including proteins, lipids and nucleotides, resulting in activation of host innate defences [1].
The PRRs comprise three major groups, toll like receptors
(TLR), retinoic acid induced RIG-I like receptors and
nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) containing
proteins, sensing PAMPs extracellularly or within the cytoplasmic region.
The RIG-I like receptors are crucial to the RNA virus triggered interferon response. They consist of three members,
retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, also named DEAD
(Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 58 (DDX58)) and
melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5, also
named interferon induced with helicase C domain 1
(IFIH1)), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2
(LGP2, also named DExH (Asp-Glu-X-His) box polypeptide 58 (DHX58)), which share a common functional
RNA helicase domain near the C terminus (HELICc) specifically binding to the RNA molecules with viral origin
[2-4]. Two tandem arranged caspase activation and
recruitment domains (CARDs) involved in protein-protein interactions are present at the N terminal region of
the RIG-I and MDA5 proteins but not LGP2, triggering the
interferon response via activation of interferon regulatory
factor 3 and NFkB [3,5]. Another distinct core domain is
the ATP dependent DExD/H domain containing a conserved motif Asp-Glu-X-Asp/His (DExD/H) which is
involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding.
RIG-I/MDA5 directed interferon signalling is now known
to be controlled by the mitochondria antiviral signalling
protein (MAVS), a CARD containing protein associated
with mitochondria, and negatively regulated by LGP2
which lacks a CARD domain [4,6,7]. LGP2 has been
shown to interfere with the binding process of RIG-I/
MDA5 to viral RNAs [8].
Both RIG-I and MDA5 appear to have overlapping binding properties with viral PAMPs and share similar signalling pathways leading to activation of the interferon
system. However, evidence of differential recognition of
viral PAMPs by RIG-I has begun to emerge recently. It
seems that MDA5 preferentially binds long, capped di- or
mono-5' phosphate double stranded (ds) RNAs whilst
RIG-I has high binding affinity with short dsRNAs or 5'
ppp uncapped single stranded (ss) RNAs [9-11]. Interestingly, neither RIG-I nor MDA5 has a classic RNA binding
motif. A zinc-binding domain located at the C terminal
region (802–925 aa) of human has been shown to specifically bind to viral derived 5'ppp RNA [12,13]. RIG-I and
MDA5 respond differently to infection with various viral
strains, with RIG-I sensitive to paramyxoviruses,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/85

orthomyxoviruses, and the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis
virus whilst MDA5 reacts to picornaviruses [11,14]. Some
viral proteins, such as the V protein of paramyxoviruses,
interact with MDA5, a mechanism possibly used by
viruses as a means to escape host surveillance.
Whilst most studies are focused on the RIG-I like PRRs in
mammals, little is known about such molecules in other
living organisms. A recent study surveying the purple sea
urchin genome has revealed multiple putative RIG-I like
homologues that appear to be present in invertebrates
[15]. More recently, it has been hypothesised that MDA5
might have emerged before RIG-I and their domain
arrangement evolved independently by domain grafting
rather than by a simple gene duplication event [16]. In
this study, we took a comparative genomics approach by
analysing RIG-I like PRRs in a number of invertebrate and
vertebrate genomes, in order to elucidate the origin and
evolution of the RIG-I like PRR family. Bioinformatic
analysis of functional domains of RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2
has identified two evolutionary conserved domains in
MDA5 and LGP2 which may be critical to the recognition
and processing of viral nucleotide PAMPs.

Results
Sequence identification
Extensive BLAST analysis of vertebrate genomes or
expressed sequence tag databases using known RIG-I protein sequences identified a putative full length RIG-I
homologue in Western Clawed Xenopus but not in
chicken (Table 1). The putative Xenopus RIG-I is 945 aa in
length, sharing 43.6% identity with human RIG-I and
contains conserved domains such as a DExD/H domain in
the middle region and a helicase domain at the C terminal
region. A less homologous CARD domain at the N terminus is also apparent. In the zebrafish genome, a single
RIG-I like gene encoding a protein of 628 aa was found in
chromosome 23 (Ensemble prediction ID No.,
ENSDARG00000039785), some 300 aa shorter than the
mammalian and amphibian RIG-I proteins. Although it
contains a DExD/H domain and a CARD domain at the N
terminus, it lacks a classic helicase c (HELICc) domain. It
is uncertain whether zebrafish RIG-I is produced as a functional protein since no EST matching the predicted RIG-I
exists. In Japanese pufferfish, tetraodon, medaka and
stickleback, no RIG-I homologues were identified either
in the EST databases or genome databases.

Unlike RIG-I, whose presence in chicken and some fish
species is uncertain, the MDA5 homologues can be found
throughout vertebrate species including fish, amphibians,
birds and mammals (Table 1). MDA5 is encoded by a single copy gene and the putative proteins have comparable
length, ranging from 987 aa to 1285 aa (Table 1). In addition to the conserved DExD/H domain and HELICc

domain, two tandem CARD domains at the N terminal
regions are predicted and are well conserved among vertebrate MDA5 molecules except for the zebrafish MDA5
that lacks a clear CARD domain. The CARD motifs near
the N-terminus (referred to as the first CARD) are more
diverse than the second CARD motif (Table 2).
LGP2 is an adaptor protein lacking CARD domains but
containing a DExD/H domain and a HELICc domain
homologous to their corresponding motifs in the RIG-I
and MDA5 protein. It competes with RIG-I and MDA5 for
the ligands, viral derived RNA PAMPs, but is unable to
interact with down stream signalling proteins due to the
absence of CARD domains. Thus it acts as a negative regulator of the RIG-I/MDA5 directed antiviral response.
LGP2 appears to co-exist with MDA5 in vertebrates as a
single copy gene. It is located in a different chromosome
to MDA5 in every species analysed. The putative LGP2
proteins from non-mammalian species contain 588–682
aa, much shorter than the RIG-I and MDA5 proteins. The
DExD/H domain and the HELICc domain in the LGP2
protein share higher homology with the corresponding
regions in MDA5 than those in RIG-I. The LGP2 DExD/H
domains are 33.4–55.3% identical to the MDA5 counterparts compared to 22.3–39.8% for the RIG-I proteins.
Similarly, 47.6–66.7% identity is seen between the LGP2
HELICc domains and the MDA5 HELICc domains, in contrast to 31.7–48.7% between LGP2 HELICc domains and
the RIG-I helicase domains.
Twelve genes coding for RNA helicase proteins homologous
to RIG-I/MDA5/LGP2 have been reported in a recent survey
of the sea urchin genome draft [15]. Some of the deduced
proteins contain CARD domains in addition to DExD/H and
HELICc domains. Using the human MDA5 protein sequence

as a bait, a partial homologue sequence was obtained from
the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis genome database
http://www.stellabase.org/, http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.
This partial sequence was then used to search the NCBI database and two contigs (NEMVEDRAFT_v1g95706 and
NEMVEDRAFT_v1g87 071) were retrieved, which encoded
two putative RIG-I/MDA5/LGP2 homologues. The putative
proteins are 672 aa and 689 aa in length, similar to that of
LGP2. Further prediction of functional motifs revealed the
presence of a DExD/H domain and a HELICc domain but
not the N terminal CARD domain. The proteins share 17.4–
26.3 identity with RIG-I, 21.7–32.4% with MDA5 and 25.3–
36.3% with LGP2.
Gene synteny analysis
To gain an insight into whether the genes surrounding
RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 are evolutionary conserved, we
analysed draft genome sequences of invertebrates, fish,
amphibians, birds and humans. The RIG-I locus was identifiable in Xenopus where the genes neighbouring RIG-I
were different to those in humans except for the ACO1
gene (Fig. 1A). Since the upstream region of the RIG-I
locus was not available in the Xenopus genome database,
whether RIG-I clustered with TOPORS remains to be
determined. In zebrafish, the RIG-I gene was immediately
downstream of the TOPORS gene, which is adjacent to the
RIG-I gene in humans. In contrast to the observation in
zebrafish, the stickleback genome appears to lack RIG-I,
which is not due to poor genome analysis since the
sequence of the RIG-I locus is of good quality. In Fugu,
medaka and chicken, the RIG-I gene could not be identified but was hindered by incomplete sequence data.

The gene synteny of MDA5/LGP2 is well conserved in vertebrates, from fish to humans (Fig. 1B and 1C). Eight

genes surrounding MDA5 in stickleback, Fugu and
medaka appear in the genomes of Xenopus, chicken and
humans, in the same order and the same transcriptional
orientation. Less conservation of gene synteny was noted
in the zebrafish genome where only 4 conserved neighbouring genes were present in the MDA5 locus. Similarly,
the gene composition and arrangement in the LGP2 gene
locus shows remarkable conservation during vertebrate
evolution.
In invertebrates, two loci containing prototype homologues of RIG-I/MDA5 were found downstream of two
independent genes coding for two CARD like molecules

in Nematostella vectensis (Fig. 2). Some 12 RIG-I/MDA like
genes have also been predicted from the purple sea urchin
genome [15]. Whilst it was possible to find appropriate
contigs containing RIG-I/MDA5 like genes from the sea
urchin genome project, it was not possible to assess gene
synteny due to a lack of genome assembly.
Phylogenetic analysis
RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 are believed to bind RNA molecules
through helicase-C domains. Closely related proteins containing a RNA binding helicase-C domain and a DExD/H
helicase domain are the double-stranded RNA-specific
endoribonuclease (DICER) and elongation initiation factor

(eIF) 4A. DICER belongs to the RNase III family that cleaves
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into short double-stranded
RNA fragments, called small interfering RNA, that is required
for specific cleavage of complementary viral RNAs, whilst
eIF4A mainly participates in translation and other processes
such as pre-mRNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis. Since
homology analysis of the RIG-I and MDA5 proteins in the
databases using the BLASTP programme gave top scores to
DICER and eIF4A in addition to the RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2
proteins, we included DICER and eIF4A in the phylogenetic
tree analysis using the neighbour joining method within the
Mega4 programme. As shown in Fig. 3, DICER and eIF4A
formed two distinct groups with a long evolutionary distance
to the branch that evolved into invertebrate DICER like helicase (DRH), RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2. Apparently, DICERs
are more distantly related to the ancestor of RIG-I, MDA5
and LGP2 than eIF4A. Comparing to DICERs and eIF4As, C.
elegans DRHs were located close to some of the sea urchin
RIG-I/MDA like proteins, the prototype of the vertebrate
counterparts. Within the RIG-I branch are two of the RIG-I
like homologues from Nematostella vectensis, two from the
sea urchin (LOC767124 and LOC577076), and predicted or
known RIG-I molecules from zebrafish, Xenopus, and mammals, suggesting RIG-I may have emerged in invertebrates.
The fact that RIG-I homologues were absent in most fish species suggests that the RIG-I gene may have been lost in some
fish lineages. The tree also indicates that LGP2 and MDA5
proteins from vertebrate species form two clear groups
closely neighbouring each other, suggesting they possibly
diverged from a common ancestor that originated from a
RIG-I like molecule in invertebrates or early vertebrates. In
addition, two phylogenetic trees were constructed using helicase C domains and DExD/H domains and a similar grouping of the major branches was observed (data not shown).
Domain analysis
The putative domains were analysed in the Pfam database
using a cut-off E-value of 10.0 and selected domains listed
in Table 2. A comprison of the domains is shown in Fig.

4. A classical helicase C domain is present in all 5 types of
DExD/H helicases, including RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, DICER
and eIF4A. The DExD/H box responsible for ATP binding
and hydrolysis was detected in the middle region of RIGI, DICER and eIF4A by the Pfam HMM search. Similarly,
the corresponding region in MDA5 and LGP2 was
detected as a conserved restriction domain of bacterial
type III restriction enzymes (Res III) (E-values between
4.3e-15 and 3.2e-22), sharing some degree of homology
with the RIG-I DExD/H box. Two CARD domains were
predicted in the N terminal regions of RIG-I and MDA5
except for Xenopus and zebrafish RIG-I, which contained
a single CARD domain corresponding to the second
CARD domain of the human molecule (CARD2). In general, the N-terminal CARD domain (CARD1) was less
conserved than the CARD2 domain. The E-value of
CARD2 in RIG-I ranges between 0.43 and 3.7, significantly higher than that in MDA5 (0.002–2.4e-18), indicating significant divergence of the CARD domains in
different vertebrate groups. In addition, a fragment at the
C-terminal region in most MDA5 proteins of chicken,
Xenopus and fish, contained a putative domain with
moderate E-values (0.51–8.60) to the 4 cysteine (C4) type
transcription factor (TF) IIS central domain. The C terminal region of human RIG-I comprised a region distantly
related to the C4 type zinc finger domain, which was
shown to bind to dsRNA and 5'ppp viral RNA with the
involvement of zinc ion [12,17]. The Pfam HMM analysis
failed to identify this C4 TFIIS domain in RIG-I possibly
due to low homology.
The domain sequences were further analysed by multiple
alignment and their 3 dimensional structures modelled. It
is apparent that the DExD/H and Res III domains comprised a well conserved DECH motif (Fig. 5A). The overall
structures of DExD/H boxes and Res III domains were
similar, with β sheets sandwiched by α-helices on each
side (Fig. 5B). Six β strands were arranged in the same orientation in the human RIG-I DExD/H box and MDA5/

numbers of predicted α-helices varied significantly among
domains. Although homology analysis showed low
sequence similarities between the MDA5 TFIIS domain
and the C4 type zinc finger nucleotide binding motif
within the human TFIIS central domain, 3D modelling
displayed significant structural similarities (Fig. 6). Our
modelling data indicated the C terminal region of RIG-I/

MDA5 proteins across vertebrates possessed a conserved
C4 type zinc finger nucleotide binding motif, in agreement with the studies in humans where a putative domain
distantly related to the C4 type zinc finger protein was
shown to bind to viral nucleotide PAMPs [12]. Remarkably, the 4 cysteines involved in capturing zinc ion were in
close physical contact, forming a conserved pocket on the
surface of all the domains analysed. However, arrangement of the cysteines differed in the human TFIIS-C

the C4 type zinc finger nucleotide binding motif, the RIGI C terminal region and the MDA5 TFIIS domain contained another noticeable β strand structure which
appeared to support the C4 type pocket. In the human
RIG-I, a single α helix was also detected.

Discussion
The RIG-I like helicase family members have recently been
reported to play pivotal roles in recognising viral nucleotides in mammals. In this report, the RIG-like homo-

logues have been identified in silico in the nucleotide
databases of invertebrates and vertebrates and their evolutionary origin discussed.
Double stranded RNA is the genetic component of viruses
with double stranded genomes and part of a single
stranded RNA with secondary structures. It can be generated during viral replication and RNA metabolism. This
nature of dsRNA makes it the prime target for host PRRs.
Classical double stranded RNA binding domains are often
used by some cytosolic PRRs, such as PKRs, as the detecPage 10 of 14

Pfam HMM programme and aligned using the CLUSTALW programme. The 3-dimensional structures of the domains were

tors to sense viral presence. DICER proteins also contain
two dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) for capturing
dsRNA molecules. In the present study, a zinc finger
domain similar to that of transcription factor (TF) IIS has
been found in MDA5 but not in LGP2, with moderate
homology to the RIG-I C terminal region. Furthermore, a
well conserved type III restriction enzyme domain responsible for restriction in prokaryotic organisms is identified
in the middle of both MDA5 and the N terminal region of
LGP2. This domain was not detected in RIG-I molecules
by the Pfam HMM programme although it shared some
degree of homology. We speculate that these two domains
may serve as potential binding domains to interact with
viral PAMPs.
One striking finding is that a well conserved restriction
enzyme III (Res III) domain is predicted in all MDA5 and
LGP2 proteins (except human LGP2). The Res III domain
is structurally similar to the DExD/H domain. Restriction
enzymes are important components of prokaryotic DNA
restriction-modification mechanisms in defence against
foreign DNA [18]. They function in combination with one
or two modification enzymes (DNA-methyltransferases)
that protect the cell's own DNA from cleavage by the
restriction enzymes. Restriction enzymes consist of four
types depending on their recognition sequences and loca-

tion of cleavage sites. Type III enzymes recognize short 5–
6 bp long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25–27
bp downstream to generate short, single-stranded 5' overhang ends. Type III enzymes contain two functional subunits Res (restriction) and Mod (modification),
specifically for DNA cleavage of unmethylated double
stranded foreign DNA (Res unit) and protection of self
DNA from damage by methylation (Mod unit), respectively. Classic strand separation helicase activities have
not been detected for type III restriction enzymes [19].
The Res III domain predicted in MDA5 and LGP2 have significant homology with bacterial Res III domains and
multiple alignment reveals significant conservation (Fig.
5A). MDA5/LGP2 are also similar to the RNase III
domains in the RNA endonuclease DICER and DICER like
helicases which process dsRNA into 21–23 nt 3' overhang
small RNAs, with 2 nt protrusions, and ATP-binding
domains in bacterial and yeast DNA helicases [20,21].
Integrated nuclease domains with excision activities are
seen in the DICER proteins where two ribonuclease III
domains cut double stranded RNAs, releasing 2 nt 3' end
overhang 21–23 nt RNA molecules which are essential for
specific cleavage of viral RNAs [20,22].
Another putative important domain, a zinc finger motif
similar to that of transcription factor (TF) IIS, was identiPage 11 of 14

fied by homology analysis in the Pfam database. The zinc
finger motif can bind a range of targets including DNAs,
RNAs, proteins and even lipids. It is known that the zinc
finger motif at the C-terminus of the TFIIS is essential for
RNA binding and processing [23]. Integrated TFIIS zinc
ribbon C-terminal domains are also found in some viral
proteins [24,25]. The TFIIS motif located near the C terminus of the RIG-I/MDA5 proteins was detectable in the
Pfam database although the E value (0.51–8.6) is moderate (Table 2). Structural modelling confirmed remarkable
conservation of a C4 type zinc finger pocket and a βstrand structure compared to the C4 type zinc finger
nucleic acid binding domain in the human TFIIS. Furthermore, a β-strand motif is also present within this domain
in addition to the C4 type β-strand zinc finger structure.

Whether it is involved in recognition of viral RNA PAMPs
remains to be determined. A recent study has demonstrated that a C terminal domain in human RIG-I (792–
925 aa) was involved in binding dsRNA or 5'ppp RNA,
which was confirmed by magnetic resonance and X-ray
crystallography [12,13]. This region was also shown to
suppress RIG-I signalling [8]. Thus it is possible that
viruses could interfere with this host recognition system
by their own TFIIS-C containing proteins.
The origin and evolution of RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 were
analysed in this study. Our data suggest they evolved from
common invertebrate ancestors encoding distinct core
domains (Fig. 7), which was supported by the presence of
the RIG-I like genes in sea anemone Nematostella vectensis

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:85

and sea urchin genomes [15]. Tandem clustering of two
CARD genes with the RIG-I like genes without CARD
domains in the Nematostella vectensis genome provides a
strong clue as to how RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 could have
evolved during evolution through gene fusion, domain
duplication and domain deletion (Fig. 7), supporting
recent analysis suggesting that CARD1 could have been
grafted independently rather than duplicated from
CARD2 during evolution [16]. In Deuterostome invertebrates, the RIG-I/MDA5 like genes appear to have
expanded enormously, as seen in the sea urchin, with
some differentiating into molecules with a closer phylogenetic relationship to the vertebrate RIG-I molecules (Fig.
3). We speculate that RIG-I emerged earlier than MDA5/
LGP2 since vertebrate RIG-Is grouped with the invertebrate progenitors rather than the MDA5 and LGP2 proteins which are present uniquely in vertebrates, in stark
contrast with the evolutionary model proposed by Sarkar
et al [16], where LGP2 preceded both MDA5 and RIG-I in
evolution. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree constructed in
the present study shows that MDA5 has a closer relationship with LGP2 rather than RIG-I, suggesting MDA5 and
LGP2 originated from a more recent gene duplication
event, unlike the phylogenetic results obtained by Sarker
et al [16]. If MDA5/LGP2 did diverge from RIG-I more
recently, the order of their appearance is not clear. Also, it
is uncertain from the present study why RIG-I was not
found in all teleost fish. Although a putative gene coding
for a partial RIG-I is predicted in the zebrafish genome,
with conserved gene synteny to the Xenopus and human
RIG-I locus (Fig. 1A), it is absent in the other fish
genomes. Poor quality of the genome sequences makes
conclusions difficult but as no RIG-I sequences were
found in the vast number of fish EST sequences, perhaps
functional RIG-I genes have been lost in some teleost fish
species.

Conclusion
The RIG-I/MDA5/LGP2 system is an ancient antiviral system well conserved in vertebrates. Our data suggest that
these helicase PRRs have evolved from an ancient progenitor originated from genes coding for individual functional domains and expanded by multiple evolutionary
events leading to gene and/or domain gain and loss. The
present study provides important clues for further elucidation of RIG-I/MDA5 mediated antiviral defence in vertebrates.

medaka (Oryzias latipes), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Western Clawed Xenopus (Xenopus tropicalis) and
Chicken (Gallus gallus) in the Ensembl database http://
www.ensembl.org. The obtained sequences were reciprocally searched against the other genomes to further verify
their identity. The translated proteins from predicted transcripts were verified by BLASTP in the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database and the SWISSPROT
protein database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. In addition, known MDA5, LGP2 and RIG-I genes were retrieved
from the NCBI database for analysis.
For gene synteny analyis, human MDA-5, LGP2 and RIG-I
were used as anchor sites. Orthologous comparisons of
the genes in the regions of approximately 1 to 10 mb (million base pairs) flanking the human (NCBI 36) anchor
site with medaka (HdrR), zebrafish (Zv7), stickleback
(BROAD S1), pufferfish (FUGU 4.0, TETRAODON 7),
Western Clawed Xenopus (JGI 4.1) or chicken
(WASHUC2) genome were done within the Ensembl
genome browser using the GeneView and MultiContigView options. Manual annotation of orthologous genes
was also performed using FGENESH+ to predict structures
based on homology with human genes: "fish" specific
parameters were applied in this program.
Sequence analysis
The conserved domains were predicted using software at
the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server http://
pfam.sanger.ac.uk. Caspase recruitment domain, DExD/H
box helicase, Type III restriction enzyme and helicase conserved C-terminal domains were predicted by a Pfam HMM
search with a cutoff value of 10.0. The full-length amino
acid sequences and the conserved functional domains were
used in phylogenetic tree analysis. Multiple protein
sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalW
programme (version 1.83) [26]. A phylogenetic tree was
constructed using the neighbour-joining method within
the MEGA (4.0) package [27]. Data were analyzed using
Poisson correction, and gaps were removed by pairwise
deletion. The topological stability of the neighbour-joining
trees was evaluated by 10,000 bootstrap replications. The
three dimensional (3D) structures were predicted using the
3D JIGSAW protein comparative modelling programme
[28] and compared to those in the MMDB/PDB database
by VAST search analysis http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Structure/VAST. The 3D structural images were displayed
by the Cn3D programme (version 4.1).

Methods
Database mining
To identify MDA5, LGP2 and RIG-I genes in the available
teleost genomes, the tblastn search using the human
MDA5, LGP2 and RIG-I protein sequences as baits was
performed against the genomes of zebrafish (Danio rerio),
pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis),
