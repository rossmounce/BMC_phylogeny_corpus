Proteomic analysis of the marine diatom
Thalassiosira pseudonana upon exposure to
benzo(a)pyrene
Raquel N Carvalho and Teresa Lettieri*

Abstract
Background: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental pollutants ubiquitously distributed. They
are generated by incomplete combustion of organic materials such as wood or fossil fuels. Due to their
carcinogenic, mutagenic effects and to their wide distribution in the environment, these pollutants pose many
concerns to researchers and regulators. In our laboratories we investigated the effect of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)
exposure in the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, which has become an important model organism in
aquatic toxicology studies.
Results: In order to investigate the mechanism of action of PAHs, we exposed the diatoms for 24 h to 36.45 μg/L
of BaP which inhibits the growth by about 30%, and analysed the relative protein expression profile by a
quantitative proteomics approach based on iTRAQ labels. The proteomics profile analysis showed that around 10%
of the identified proteins were regulated and one fourth of them confirmed the gene expression changes seen by
DNA microarray. Particularly interesting was the down regulation of the Silicon transporter 1 (SIT1), an enzyme that
is responsible for the uptake of silicon from the media into the diatom cells. Regulation of SIT1 upon BaP
treatment was also confirmed at the gene expression level.
Conclusions: The potential use of the regulated proteins found in this study as early indicators of environmental
exposure to PAHs is discussed. In particular, SIT1 is considered a promising biomarker and SIT1 expression changes
were confirmed also when the diatoms were exposed to field samples, e.g. marine surface sediments
contaminated by PAHs.

Background
Diatoms are eukaryotic, unicellular, photosynthetic
organisms that inhabit marine and fresh waters worldwide and are responsible for about 40% of the total carbon fixation in oceans [1]. Their high productivity
compared to other primary producers is likely the main
base of the world’s marine food webs, allowing a reduced
trophic fractionation, and sustaining even top-level marine predators like cetaceans [2]. Diatoms are surrounded
by a peculiar cell wall with intricate micro- and nanostructured biosilica patterns. The assembly of specific
silica shell patterns for the different diatom species is
under genetic control, being reliably reproduced on each

cell division [3]. Thalassiosira pseudonana is a centric
diatom inhabiting marine ecosystems which has been a
target organism for studies focusing on diatom biosilica
formation [4,5], the molecular effects of copper toxicity
[6] and nutrient limitation, temperature or pH effects [7].
In 2004, the whole genome of T. pseudonana was published [8] and soon after, the genome sequencing of two
other diatom organisms has been described [1,9]
The available genomic information for these diatom
species, associated with the important role they play in
the carbon fixation in oceans, paved the way for their use
as model organisms in molecular ecotoxicology studies.
Thus, our laboratory has designed a DNA microarray
chip containing all the available genes in T. pseudonana
to identify gene biomarkers of exposure to stress conditions, including environmental pollutants. Some pollutants which have been initially selected are the polycyclic

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are persistent
organic pollutants with a ubiquitous distribution in aquatic environments and are considered a major threat to
marine and freshwater ecosystems [10]. Several PAHs
were included in the priority list of the European Union’s
Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) because of
their potential carcinogenic and mutagenic properties.
Previously, an axenic culture of T. pseudonana has been
used to investigate the molecular effects of exposure to
three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both as
single compounds and as a mixture [11]. By studying the
expression of selected genes by quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR), a few genetic biomarkers of exposure to
PAHs have been described [11]. Recently, we have
extended the gene expression analysis to the entire
T. pseudonana transcriptome by using our in-house
microarray for exposure experiments to benzo(a)pyrene
(BaP), a common PAH compound. The regulated genes
identified by DNA microarray increase our understanding of the pathways involved in the cellular response to
PAH exposure conditions and allow the selection of
some interesting genes to be used as molecular biomarkers of exposure to PAHs in the environment. For this
purpose, we have recently tested diatoms exposed to contaminated marine water sediments and confirmed the
suitability of some genes as biomarkers in environmental
monitoring studies [12].
Recent advances in shotgun proteomics and the use of
isobaric labelling of peptides and proteins for the relative
quantification of an entire organism or cell proteome
under different experimental conditions offer promising
tools for the discovery of biomarkers also at the protein
level. We describe here a procedure for proteomic analysis of the diatom T. pseudonana using iTRAQ labelling
to identify proteins differentially expressed upon exposure to BaP. The data obtained will be discussed in the
context of the gene expression analysis performed in our
laboratory under the same experimental conditions, as
well as to the known effects of PAHs in other organisms.
Ultimately, our goal is to use the molecular information
gathered in this model organism, as indicators for the
early assessment of the ecosystem health and predict the
effects in higher eukaryotes of the same habitats. These
molecular indicators alone or in combination with the
common chemical analysis of pollutants in the environment should provide a better understanding of the
endangerment level of an ecosystem to specific stress
conditions.

Results
Effect of BaP on diatom growth

To study the effects of BaP exposure in diatoms at the
molecular level, T. pseudonana cultures have been
exposed for 24 h to 36.45 μg/L BaP or just to the

methanol solvent (here referred to as control conditions). Methanol at a final concentration of 0.05% (v/v)
was shown to induce no effect on the diatom growth. In
control conditions, diatom cell density showed an
increase by 1.5 fold after 24 h (Figure 1). Exposure of
diatom cultures to BaP for 24 h resulted in 30% growth
inhibition relative to the control (Figure 1), which is
consistent with what had been previously described [11].
Protein identification

Protein extraction from three biological replicates, each
consisting of both control and BaP-exposed conditions,
was carried out on consecutive days. Additional file 1
shows the workflow followed in the present study, starting from the cell culture and exposure to BaP up to
MS/MS data analysis. The total amount of protein
obtained was around 2 μg/million cells harvested from
the control conditions, as compared with 1.5 μg/million
cells extracted from the BaP-exposed conditions. Simultaneous protein measurements in all the six samples
(See Methods section) were performed to assure that
the same amount of protein from each sample was
taken for iTRAQ labeling. In addition, both undigested
and tryptic-digested samples were loaded on a SDSPAGE to confirm both the protein amount and the
complete digestion by trypsin (Additional file 2). Following SCX separation of the pooled iTRAQ-labeled samples and LC-MS/MS analysis, we were able to identify a
total of 308 different proteins in the three biological
replicates, based on one or more peptide hits per protein at >95% confidence. ProteinPilot was used to search
the complete T. pseudonana proteome database downloaded from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Following exclusion
of proteins identified by a single peptide, the number of
proteins identified decreased to 200 (Additional file 3:
Table S1). The false discovery rate of peptide matches
above identity threshold was 0.58%. Based on gene
ontology classification, the major group of proteins identified is involved in translation, metabolic processes and
photosynthesis (Additional file 3: Table S1). In addition,
about 20% of the proteins identified in this study had
no annotated function assigned to them.
Protein quantification

iTRAQ-mediated shotgun proteomics allows the relative
quantification of peptides from up to eight samples
simultaneously, and has proven to be a successful tool
in protein biomarker discovery, both in the biomedical
[13,14] and environmental fields [15,16].
Different iTRAQ reagents were used to distinguish
peptides obtained from diatom cells cultured in control
and BaP-exposed conditions (Additional file 1). Protein
quantification based on the relative amounts of the different iTRAQ labels was obtained for all identified

proteins based on two or more unique peptides, using
both ProteinPilot and Mascot algorithms. The use of
both algorithms allowed the identification of a higher
number of regulated proteins, because of slight differences in peptide confidence levels and iTRAQ-label
quantification values acquired with the two programs.
We then analyzed the data sets for changes in protein
levels upon BaP-exposure. The expression of a protein
was considered as being regulated by BaP treatment
when it showed changes in expression beyond 20% (i.e.
>1.2- or <0.8-fold change from unity; calculated from
the median ratio of all reported proteins), and with a
P < 0.05 calculated after a two-tailed unpaired statistical
approach. Following these criteria, 13 different proteins
with two or more quantified peptides, showed regulation
upon BaP exposure. As listed in Table 1, 6 proteins
showed an up-regulation and 7 proteins a downregulation. In addition, for those proteins with a significant regulation of at least 20% (P < 0.05), but identified
by a single peptide at >95% confidence, and for which
other peptides had been identified at lower confidence,
all individual spectra were analyzed manually, both for
the fragmentation pattern and the relative intensity of
the different iTRAQ reporter ions. Six proteins which
showed a significant regulation considering all the peptides (P < 0.05) were selected for inclusion in the potentially BaP-regulated proteins (Table 1; Additional file 4:
Supplemental Figures S1-S6). Our decision to include
these proteins in Table 1 as “potentially regulated” is

sustained by the risk of loosing otherwise important
protein targets for follow-up studies, masked by the
high variability existing in unsynchronized diatom cultures. It is even more relevant since for two of them,
predicted NonF-related protein; DJ-1/PfpI family (SwissProt:B5YN08) and silicon transporter 1 (Swiss-Prot:
Q0QVM8), a similar regulation has been confirmed
at the gene expression level, by DNA microarray
(unpublished data). The regulated proteins were mainly
involved in metabolism, photosynthesis and transport
activities (Table 1). Figure 2 depicts an example of protein
identification and quantification for a predicted C-5
cytosine-specific DNA methylase (Swiss-Prot:B8BVP1).
The b- and y- ion series in the tandem mass spectrometry
spectra were used to identify the peptides. The iTRAQ
reporter ion peak areas of the four peptide fragments
(AIGGVTDGSVR, EVIEDLVKDELIK, IKVDSPLGQLLASK and VDSPL GQLLASK, Figure 2A inset, B-D) were
used to measure the relative amount of C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase in BaP-exposed (at m/z 114, 116 and
121) and control diatom cultures (at m/z 113, 115 and 119).
As expected, the quantification of iTRAQ labels 113,
114, 115, 116, 119 and 121 cluster on a principle component analysis (PCA) according to the conditions of
exposure (Additional file 5), i.e. control (113, 115 and
119) vs BaP-exposed (114, 116 and 121). In addition, the
quantification of iTRAQ labels 117 and 118 cluster
together on the PCA and away from all other labels
(Additional file 5).

confirm the effect of BaP on the silicon uptake by SIT1
in T. pseudonana, suggested from the present proteomics study, we have designed specific primers to study
the gene expression of this transporter by qRT-PCR.
Consistent with the proteomics results, also the expression of the sit1 gene showed a down-regulation in
all the six biological replicates for BaP exposure tested
(Figure 3). In addition, when diatom cultures were
exposed to a mixture of PAHs extracted from an environmental contaminated site (port of Genoa, Italy), with
a BaP concentration 20-fold lower as the one used in
the present study, the expression of the sit1 gene still
showed a decrease by qRT-PCR [12].

The identification of the silicon transporter (SIT1) in
our study as a potentially regulated protein after BaPtreatment (Table 1) was a very interesting finding, since
BaP and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have
been previously shown to regulate the gene expression
of several silaffin proteins [11]. Silaffins are involved in
the silica biomineralization of diatoms [17] and rely on
the availability of the silicon pool inside the cells, gathered through uptake from the environment by silicon
transporters located at the membrane. In order to

Discussion
Since the publication of the entire genome sequence of
T. pseudonana in 2004 [8], this eukaryotic algae has
become a promising model organism to study stress
responses in marine environments at the molecular
level. Diatom species are particularly relevant as model
organisms because i) they are unicellular organisms easy
to keep in culture, ii) they have a predominant role as
primary producers, accounting for about 40% of the

iTRAQ labels 117 and 118 have been used to label
untreated and BaP-exposed conditions, respectively on
an old diatom culture which was in resting phase. Thus,
when we subjected this culture to the same experimental procedure, no significant growth could be observed
in the control and BaP-exposed cultures after 24 h. This
prevented the measurement of any BaP-induced effect
either as growth inhibition or as a difference in expression of the proteome, which underlines the importance
of using cell cultures in exponential growth for the purpose of molecular biomarker discovery.

total carbon fixation in oceans and iii) any fluctuation at
the population level of these organisms is expected to
have major effects on the entire ecosystem [1]. In this
study, diatom cultures have been exposed to BaP, a
common PAH compound with carcinogenic and mutagenic properties, and found in several fresh water and
salt water habitats, arising from various natural and
anthropogenic sources. The major areas of concern for
these pollutants are the estuarine, coastal zones, port
areas and also enormous marine environmental areas
due to navigation activities as well as to oil spill accidents. A previous report from our group had already
unveiled some biological pathways involved in the diatom response to BaP exposure, from the expression analysis of selected genes by qRT-PCR, including lipid
metabolism and the biosilicification process [11]. The
current report is part of a broader effort to identify biomarkers of exposure at both gene and protein expression level. Currently, even with the available genome
sequence of T. pseudonana, a deep understanding of the
pathways involved in any response to stress conditions
is hindered by the limited amount of information on the
protein function. In fact, the available annotation on
the function or metabolic pathways of most of the
T. pseudonana proteins has been mainly deduced from
sequence homology with other organisms and many are
only predicted or putative proteins with no function
assigned. So far, only few studies describing the function
of selected proteins have been published e.g. the ones
involved in the silicon uptake and biomineralization [17]
and specific cell-surface proteins potentially involved in
the copper-induced stress response [6,18]. The need for

comprehensive proteomics studies is therefore relevant
for the purpose of compiling the entire translated pool
of genes in this organism and to allow the build-up of
metabolic or signaling pathways that could be involved
in stress and adaptation-related responses. Mass spectrometry analyses of T. pseudonana for the purpose of
protein identification have previously been performed
on a cell wall fraction, identifying a total of 31 proteins
[19] and recently on the whole-cell proteome, with the
identification of 1928 different proteins [20]. To our
knowledge, the present data describe the first use of a
quantitative proteomics approach in T. pseudonana, to
identify potential protein biomarkers of exposure to
stress conditions in this organism. However, only about
2% of the entries on the predicted diatom proteome
database have been identified in this study, suggesting
that further development of extraction and fractionation
techniques are required to improve the identification of
low abundant or membrane proteins. Interestingly,
around 14% of the identified proteins and 10% of the
regulated proteins found in this study are annotated as
predicted or putative proteins, which limits the assignment of the pathways involved in the response to BaP
exposure.
Photosynthesis

Three different proteins involved in photosynthetic processes show a down-regulation in BaP-exposed samples,
compared to control conditions. This finding is in agreement with previous reports on a harmful effect of BaP
and other PAHs on the photosynthetic activity in plants
[21]. One can speculate that a reduction in the diatoms
photosynthesis caused by a PAH contamination in
oceans could result in a lower consumption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by diatoms and decrease the
generated organic carbon. Because diatoms are the contemporaneous dominant primary producers in marine
environments, a reduction in their activity is likely to
affect the marine food webs they sustain [1,2].
DNA methylation

Gene methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic
genomes [22] and is a source of epigenetic information,
by providing instructions on how, where, and when the
genetic information should be transcribed [23]. In mammalian cells, cytosine-specific methyltransferases methylate CpG sequences, which are believed to modulate gene
expression and cell differentiation [24]. In the present
study, a predicted C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase,
an enzyme which specifically methylates the C-5 carbon
of cytosines in DNA to produce C5-methylcytosine,
revealed an up-regulation in the BaP-exposed diatom cultures compared to control conditions. This finding is
consistent with the recent DNA microarray studies

Carvalho and Lettieri BMC Genomics 2011, 12:159

performed in our laboratory, where another putative
DNA methyltransferase also showed an up-regulation of
gene expression (data not shown). Interestingly, variable
degrees of overexpression of DNA methyltransferases
have been reported in tumor tissue [25]. Changes in the
DNA methylation patterns in tumor cells often involve
global hypomethylation of the genome accompanied by
region-specific hyper-methylation events [23]. In addition, exposure to BaP has been connected with a disruption in DNA methylation in cancerous cells [26,27].
Therefore, alterations at the level of DNA methylation
caused by BaP exposure could be linked with the carcinogenic properties of this compound. In addition, this effect
seems to be conserved in eukaryotes, strengthening
further the use of T. pseudonana as a model organism to
study general toxicity events.
Lipid metabolism

Due to its hydrophobic nature, PAHs accumulate in lipidic environments such as membranes and are known to
induce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation [28]. From
the candidate biomarkers found in the present study,
the regulated long chain acyl CoA synthetase protein
(Swiss-Prot:B8CDL6) is involved in lipid metabolism,
most likely belonging to the long-chain acyl CoA
synthetase family of enzymes, as deduced from sequence
homology to other organisms. Although there are no
available studies on the catalytic activity of long-chain
acyl-CoA synthetase in diatoms; in mammals, they catalyze the formation of long-chain CoA and AMP from
fatty acid, CoA and ATP, in a two step reaction that
initiates cellular long-chain fatty acid metabolism [29].
In this study, the long chain acyl CoA synthetase protein
shows a 2-fold down-regulation upon exposure to BaP.
A similar down-regulation has been observed for an
enzyme belonging to this family by DNA microarray
studies in adult zebrafish exposed to produced
water components, which are rich in PAHs [30]. In
T. pseudonana, there are six predicted proteins belonging to the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family [8].
The regulation of this pathway is further evidenced in a
previous report that showed a regulation of another protein belonging to this family, the long-chain-fatty-acid–
CoA ligase (Swiss-Prot:B8CBL9) in the opposite direction. Thus, an increased expression upon exposure to
BaP has been observed at the gene level, both by qRTPCR [11] and by DNA microarray, as well as at the protein level, as seen by immunoassays[12].
The involvement of the lipid metabolism on the cellular response to BaP exposure is further evidenced on a
recent report in human macrophages where it was
demonstrated that BaP is able to trigger lipid accumulation in cellular compartments, including endosomes and
lysosomes [31]. We can speculate that such increase in

Page 7 of 11

lipids could be involved in the more efficient sequestering of the hydrophobic BAP, thus preventing the formation of DNA adducts generated by BaP metabolites. In
mammalian cells, five different long-chain acyl-CoA
synthetase proteins have been described, with specific
and sometimes overlapping substrates and subcellular
localizations [32]. Further studies would be necessary to
uncover the potential functional differences, including
substrate specificities, of this family of enzymes in the
diatom species, which are likely to be regulated in different ways by BaP exposure. Despite the mechanism of
action involved, it is clear that the cellular response to
PAHs in T. pseudonana include the regulation of
enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, in particular
long-chain fatty acids. In addition, since this family of
enzymes seems to be conserved across all phylogenetic
branches, it is possible that a similar regulation may
take place in other organisms.
Silicon uptake and metabolism

One characteristic feature of diatoms is the silicified
cell-wall or frustule that surrounds the plasma membrane [33] which is assembled by the combined action
of silaffin proteins and long-chain polyamines (LCPA).
Silaffin 1-2L and Silaffin 3 in T. pseudonana have been
shown to directly catalyze silica polymerization and the
activity of the different proteins determines the size and
shapes of produced silica particles, as demonstrated
from scanning electron microscopy analysis of distinct
silaffin-LCPA mixtures [17]. Maintenance of the diatom
intracellular silicon pools requires the uptake of silicon
from the aquatic environment through membrane silicon transporters. Silicon transporter 1 (SIT1) and silicon
transporter 2 (SIT2) have been previously shown to be
associated with cell cycle events, with a gene expression
peak in the S phase, concomitant with DNA replication
and cytokinesis [34]. The increase in SIT expression
likely raises the uptake of silicon from the environment,
preceding the synthesis of new valves in the silica
deposition vesicle (SDV) and exocytosis in the G2+M
phase [35].
In T. pseudonana cultures exposed to BaP, we observe
a down-regulation of SIT1 (Swiss-Prot:Q0QVM8), both
at the protein level and gene expression level. Interestingly, BaP treatment also cause a reduction in the net silicon uptake per diatom cell, as determined by the
measurement of silicon disappearance from the medium
[12]. This finding suggests a direct link between BaP
treatment and a decrease in the available intracellular
pools of silicon, presumably through a decrease in
expression of SIT1. Despite the strong amino acid identity between SIT1 and SIT2 (88%) [34], the peptides identified in this study for SIT1 correspond to regions not
identical to both enzymes. Therefore, no conclusion can

Carvalho and Lettieri BMC Genomics 2011, 12:159
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/159

be drawn on whether SIT2 expression is also affected by
BaP treatment. Previously, silicon limitation was shown
to specifically down-regulate silaffin 3 expression [7], as
we also observe upon BaP treatment [11,12]. It would be
interesting to test whether the combined downregulation of SIT1, the intracellular silicon limitation conditions, and the down regulation of Sil3 caused by BaP
could affect the silicification process and the produced
silica shell nanopatterns in T. pseudonana. For this purpose, it is likely that higher times of exposure than the
24 h used in the present study, and the establishment of
cell synchronization prior to exposure would be required
for the visualization of changes at the level of cell wall
morphology by e.g. scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Conclusions
Using a quantitative proteomics approach based on
iTRAQ labeling of peptides, we could study protein
expression changes in diatoms upon exposure to BaP.
Despite the low protein identification rate achieved in
our studies, we were able to select a set of 19 proteins
with changes in expression. Our data shows that the
lipid metabolism and biosilicification processes are
involved, as observed previously, but also unveils other
potential pathways involved in the diatom exposure or
in toxicity responses to BaP, such as DNA methylation
and photosynthesis. These data, combined with gene
expression analysis can help to elucidate pathway/metabolic processes involved in the mode of action of
pollutants.
Methods
Diatom culture and detection of growth inhibition upon
exposure to benzo(a)pyrene

T. pseudonana (strain CCMP 1335) was obtained as axenic culture from the Provasoli-Guillard National Center
for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton (CCMP, West
Boothbay Harbour, Maine, USA). Diatoms were maintained at 6-8°C under a diurnal light cycle of 13 h light
and 11 h darkness. The culture medium was f/2-medium
based on 3.2% artificial sea water (ASW, Sigma-Aldrich,
Steinheim, Germany). T. pseudonana was cultured at
densities between 0.5 × 106 and 2 × 106 cells/mL. Fresh
cultures for maintenance were inoculated every 7 days.
Cell densities were determined by measuring the absorption at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer
(Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) and used to calculate
growth rates, as previously described [11].
Fresh diatom cultures were inoculated at a start cell
density of 0.5 × 106 cells/mL, incubated for 24 h and
divided into different flasks for exposure experiments.
Diatom cultures were exposed to benzo(a)pyrene (36.45
μg/L) dissolved in methanol while the solvent was added
to control cultures at a final concentration of 0.05%

Page 8 of 11

(v/v) [11], half-hour before the beginning of the light
cycle. After 24 h of exposure, and before the beginning
of the light cycle, cell densities were measured and
growth rates were used to determine growth inhibition
with respect to the control. Then, diatom cultures were
centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was
removed and the cell pellet resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS
buffer, on ice (Gibco, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Protease
inhibitors (cocktail for plant cell and tissue extracts,
Sigma) were included when cells were harvested for protein extraction. The suspension was transferred to
1.5 mL tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min.
Then, supernatants were removed and the remaining
cell pellets were frozen at -80°C. A total of three biological replicates were performed for the BaP-exposed and
control conditions in consecutive weeks.
Total protein extraction and iTRAQ labeling

For protein extraction, the frozen cell pellet was allowed
to thaw on ice, and resuspended with 200 μL of buffer
containing 50 mM MOPS, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mM
DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Cell lysis
was performed using homogenization with a IKA® T10
basic ULTRA-TURRAX, for periods of 2 min on ice,
briefly spinning down to remove any foam created by
the procedure. Around 5-7 cycles homogenization were
necessary for complete homogenization, which was verified by inspection on a microscope. Finally, the samples
were sonicated for 30 min on ice and the lysate was
centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min. Then, the supernatant was transferred into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
Acetone precipitation of the proteins was usually
required to concentrate the protein extract and done
systematically. This was achieved by the addition of 6
volumes of cold acetone to the protein samples, mixing
by gently vortexing and incubating at -20°C overnight.
After centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min and removal
of the supernatant, the pellet was dissolved in 50 μL
TEAB buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Several
steps of sonication on ice and vortexing were required
for complete solubilization. Sample reduction with
TCEP was performed according to the iTRAQ protocol
(Applied Biosystems) for 1 h at 60°C. Any insoluble
material was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentration was measured using a colorimetric method
(Bradford reagent, Bio-Rad), according to the manufactors protocol. A total amount of 60 μg from each sample was transferred into new tubes and adjusted to the
same volume with TEAB buffer. Cysteine blocking with
methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) for 10 min was
performed after which trypsin (Proteomics grade,
Sigma) was added at a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:20 and
digestion occurred for 16 h at 37°C. Protein samples
before and after digestion were taken and run on

Carvalho and Lettieri BMC Genomics 2011, 12:159
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/159

SDS-PAGE both to confirm similar amounts of protein
extract in each sample as well as to confirm complete
protein digestion after the incubation with trypsin. Protein visualization was done by silver staining with the
SilverQuest Silver Staining Kit (Invitrogen) following the
standard protocol provided by the company.
Each iTRAQ 8-plex reagent (Applied Biosystems) was
dissolved in 50 μL isopropanol and added to a total
amount of 53 μg of peptide sample. Verification of the
samples pH (7.5-8.5) was done and labeling occurred for
2 h at room temperature. Samples were frozen at -80°C
and shipped within a day in dry ice to Proteome Factory, Germany for SCX separation and MS/MS analysis.
Peptide SCX separation

Efficiency of labeling from each sample was verified by
mass spectrometry before the eight samples were
pooled. SCX separation used an Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a PolySULFOETHYL A column (200 mm ×
2.1 mm, 5 μm, 200 Å, PolyLC, USA). The iTRAQ
labeled sample was dried by speedvac and resuspended
in 1.5 mL 0.1% formic acid/25% acetonitrile and the pH
adjusted to about pH 2.5. The following separation gradient with buffer A (0.1% formic acid/25% acetonitrile)
and buffer B (500 mM KCl/0.1% formic acid/25% acetonitrile) was used at flow rate 200 μl/min (0%B for
10 min; 40%B for 45 min; 70%B for 57.5 min and 100%
B for 65 min). 18 SCX fractions were collected in a
microtiter plate and dried by Speedvac for subsequent
nanoLC-ESI-QStar MS.
nanoLC-QStar MS analysis for protein identification and
quantification

Protein identification and quantification of iTRAQ
reporter ions were performed using nanoLC-ESI-MS/
MS. The MS system consisted of an Agilent 1100
nanoLC system (Agilent, Germany), PicoTip emitter
(New Objective, USA) and a Qstar XL MS (ABI, Foster
City, USA). Dried SCX peptide fractions were resuspended in 80 μl 0.1% formic acid/1% acetonitrile in
MilliQ water. After trapping 40 μl sample and desalting
the peptides on enrichment column (Zorbax SB C18,
0.3 mm × 5 mm, Agilent) using 1% acetonitrile, 0.1%
formic acid solution for 10 minutes, peptides were separated on Zorbax 300 SB C18, 75 μm × 150 mm column
(Agilent, Germany) using an acetonitrile, 0.1% formic
acid gradient from 5% to 35% acetonitrile within
110 minutes. MS spectra were automatically taken by
Qstar XL according to manufacturer’s instrument settings for nanoLS-ESI-MS/MS analyses. Proteins were
identified and quantified using MS/MS ion search of
Mascot 2.2.06 search engine (Matrix Science, London)
with iTRAQ-8plex quantification, using a peptide mass
tolerance of 150 ppm, a fragment mass tolerance of

Page 9 of 11

0.4 Da and two missed cleavages. A parallel database
search was done using the Paragon algorithm as implemented in Protein Pilot 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems), using the customized search settings. Searches
were performed against a protein database containing
the entire proteome of Thalassiosira pseudonana,
(downloaded from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot), with 11842
sequences [8,36], concatenated with a reversed “decoy”
version to calculate the false discovery rate, and in addition, a search on the entire NCBI database was performed to exclude the presence of common protein
contaminants and confirm the Thalassiosira pseudonana
origin of the protein hits. For both analyses, the relative
quantitative protein ratios relative to iTRAQ reporter
ion 113 were obtained, and median ratio normalization
was performed, as recommended for complex protein
samples. Relative quantitative protein ratios compared
to the iTRAQ reporter ion 113 were imported to an
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) spreadsheet and
a 2-tailed, unpaired statistical evaluation was run to
assess the significance in the observed differences in
iTRAQ reporter quantifications between the three replicates of the two sample groups. All identified proteins
were verified in Swiss-Prot and JGI http://genome.jgipsf.org/Thaps3/Thaps3.home.html databases for the
annotation (Additional file 3: Table S1).
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR

Extraction of total RNA from three biological replicates
in both control and BaP-exposed conditions, was performed using the Trizol LS (Invitrogen) protocol, as
described previously [11], using 20-40 million cells per
extraction. For the reverse transcription, the RNA was
first treated with DNase I (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland), according to the manufacturer’s protocol,
and then transcribed to cDNA using oligodT primers
and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase Kit as recommended (Invitrogen). The purity and integrity of the
RNA was verified by absorbance measurements at
260 nm with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop Technologies Inc, USA) and by electrophoretic separation with a Bioanalyzer using the RNA
Nano kit (Agilent Technologies).
Regulation of the expression of the gene sit1, coding for
silicon transporter 1 (Swiss-Prot:Q0QVM8) was analyzed
by qRT-PCR, using the forward primer with sequence
5’TTGCCGAGGATGCCTAAACTT3’, the reverse
primer with sequence 5’TGACGAGCTACTGCAGGT
TCA3’ and the TaqMAN MGB 6-FAM probe 5’TGGC
AATCTGTTGTAAAT3’.
Amplification reactions were performed using the
Master Mix 2× (Applied Biosystems), 0.9 mM of reverse
and forward primers, 0.1 mM probe, and 2.5 μL of
cDNA in a final volume of 25 μL. Samples were loaded

Carvalho and Lettieri BMC Genomics 2011, 12:159
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/159

in triplicate on 96-well optical reaction plates and qRTPCR was performed in the ABI Prism 7900HT sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems). Each cycle of the
thermal amplification followed the universal protocol
according to the manufacturer, i.e. 2 min preheating at
50°C, 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles with 15 s at
95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Gene expression data from
qRT-PCR were evaluated using Q-Gene [37], which
takes into account the amplification efficiencies of target
and reference genes. For all qRT-PCR results, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) was used as
housekeeping gene, for which sequences of the specific
primers have been previously published [11].

Additional material
Additional file 1: Workflow for the identification of protein changes
induced by BaP treatment in T. pseudonana. Diatom cells were
inoculated into fresh medium, cultured for 24 h and exposed to BaP (36
μg/L) or just the solvent (control) for 24 h, in three biological replicates.
Following cell lysis, 60 μg of protein were alkylated, reduced and
digested with trypsin. Peptides were then labeled with iTRAQ reagents
and pooled as shown. Strong cation exchange was then used to remove
free iTRAQ reagent and to fractionate peptides for subsequent separation
and peptide analysis by LC-MS/MS. MS/MS data was analyzed using
Mascot and ProteinPilot software.
Additional file 2: Silver staining of protein extract and tryptic digest
run on SDS-PAGE. The figure shows the similar amount of proteins run
for three biological replicates. Control protein extracts, labeled with
iTRAQ 113, 115 and 119 were loaded onto lanes 1, 5 and 9, respectively,
while BaP-exposed protein extracts, labeled with iTRAQ 114, 116 and 121
were loaded onto lanes 3, 7 and 11, respectively. Tryptic digested
products were loaded on the neighboring lanes to the right of the
corresponding protein extracts, and show the protein digestion was
complete under the used conditions. Molecular weight markers were
loaded onto lanes labeled with M.
Additional file 3: Protein identification in T. Pseudonana. The file
shows Table S1 listing all the proteins identified by MS/MS from the T.
pseudonana extract with a minimum of 2 peptides at >95% confidence.
Additional file 4: Peptide fragmentation spectra used for the
identification and relative quantification of proteins that have been
included in Table 1as potentially regulated. The file contains the
fragmentation spectra of the peptide fragment identified with high
confidence (> 95%) as well as the fragmentation spectra of other
peptides identified with lower confidence, for six different proteins
(Supplemental Figures S1-S6). The reporter ion signals shown in the lowmass region of the spectra were used to determine the relative amount
of the protein in T. pseudonana exposed to BaP (iTRAQ 114, 116 and
121) when compared to control conditions (iTRAQ 113, 115 and 119).
Additional file 5: Principle component analysis for the
quantification of the iTRAQ labels in the different experiments. The
analysis shows a clustering of the proteome analysis from control diatom
cultures, labeled with iTRAQ 113, 115 and 119, as well as a clustering of
the proteome analysis from the BaP-exposed conditions, labeled with
iTRAQ 114, 116 and 121. An additional experiment has been
incorporated in the MS/MS analysis, consisting of control and BaPexposed conditions, labeled with iTRAQ 117 and 118, respectively, but
were not considered for the overall quantification analysis. In this
experiment, the same starting density of 0.5 million cells/mL was used,
but from a culture in the resting phase. We observed that the growth in
the diatom cultures was largely reduced from the expected values, and
was also observed after the addition of solvent or BaP. We decided to
use the cells arising from this experiment with the remaining iTRAQ
labels from the 8-plex kit, to see whether under these abnormal cell

Page 10 of 11

culture circumstances, we could still observe significant differences
between control and exposure conditions. It is evident that both
conditions in this experiment sit as outliers on the graph and in addition,
they seem to be clustered together. In fact, from the quantification
analysis, it was observed that both 117 and 118 labels showed rather
consistent values for most of the peptides analyzed, and not in
agreement with the experimental conditions, i.e. control or BaP-exposed.
It is interesting to note that the reduced cell growth in this culture,
greatly affected the outcome of the quantification. Thus, the apparent
sensitivity of these cells seemed to be more relevant than the exposure
conditions themselves. These findings, although not unexpected, truly
support the importance of reproducibility in biomarker research, since
any differences in the initial state of the cells has a substantial effect on
the biomolecular pool and thus masks any potential differences of
expression, either at gene or protein level.
