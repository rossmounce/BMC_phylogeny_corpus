Abstract
Background: White clover (Trifolium repens L.) is an outbreeding allotetraploid species and an important forage
legume in temperate grassland agriculture. Comparison of sub-genome architecture and study of nucleotide
sequence diversity within allopolyploids provides insight into evolutionary divergence mechanisms, and is also
necessary for the development of whole-genome sequencing strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the degree of
divergence between the O and P' sub-genomes of white clover through sequencing of BAC clones containing paired
homoeoloci. The microsyntenic relationships between the genomes of white clover and the model legumes Lotus
japonicus and Medicago truncatula as well as Arabidopsis thaliana were also characterised.
Results: A total of four paired homoeologous BACs were selected and sequenced to generate 173 kb of overlapping
sequence between the O and P' sub-genomes. Equivalent gene content was generally observed, apart from smallscale deletions, in contrast to conservation of intergenic sequences, which varied between the four selected regions.
Measurement of the number of synonymous substitutions between homoeologous genes led to estimation of a 4.2
million year divergence time between the two sub-genomes. Microsynteny was observed between the genomes of
white clover and L. japonicus for all four targeted regions, but corresponding M. truncatula genomic regions were only
identified for two BAC pairs.
Conclusions: This study describes the first analysis of sub-genome structural conservation across selected genomic
regions in white clover. Although the high levels of sequence conservation between the O and P' sub-genomes would
complicate efforts for whole genome sequence assembly, the conserved microsynteny with model legume genomes,
especially that of L. japonicus, will be highly valuable for the future of white clover genomics and molecular breeding.
Background
Allopolyploid genome constitutions, arising from
hybridisation between related diploid taxa, are ubiquitous
features of plant genetic architecture [1,2]. Examples of
agronomically important allopolyploid species include
bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.: 6x), cotton (Gossypium species: 4x), canola (Brassica napus L.: 4x), oat
(Avena sativa L.: 6x), strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa
Duch.: 8x), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.: 4x) and white

clover (Trifolium repens L.: 4x). The majority of allopolyploid taxa behave as functional diploids due to the action
of genes controlling pairing between homoeologous
chromosomes, such as the Ph1 locus of allohexaploid
bread wheat [3,4]. The degree of divergence between subgenomes in terms of evolutionary history or sequence
diversity may be variable. Some allopolyploid taxa (such
as cotton: [5]) are relatively ancient in evolutionary terms,
while others have arisen recently (such as allohexaploid
wheat within human pre-history: [6]).
As high-throughput sequencing technologies rapidly
improve, it is becoming more realistic to produce draft
genome sequence assemblies of important crop species.

However, this process is highly complicated by polyploidy, especially when sub-genomes are closely related,
which might be expected to dispose towards chimaeric
contig assembly. One strategy to overcome this problem
is to first sequence the relevant genomes of diploid progenitor taxa, when such information is available. An
understanding of relatedness between the sub-genomes is
hence essential prior to any such genome sequence
assembly efforts. Studies of homoeologous sub-genome
conservation within various paleopolyploids have
revealed both low (maize [7]) and high (soybean [8]) levels of gene retention, while true polyploids such as cotton
contain both conserved genic and intergenic regions
[9,10].
White clover is an outbreeding allotetraploid (2n = 4x =
32) species, and an important forage legume in temperate
grassland agriculture. The evolutionary history of white
clover has been a matter of considerable controversy, but
recent molecular phylogenetic studies [11] have implicated T. occidentale D.E. Coombe (Western clover) and T.
pallescens Schreber as putative diploid progenitors. Cloning and sequencing of PCR amplicons from protein-coding genes derived from white clover and the diploid taxa
has permitted resolution of homologous, homoeologous
and paralogous sequence variation categories, and
revealed high levels of sequence similarity (c. 95%)
between the two sub-genomes. One of the white clover
sub-genomes is closely related to that of contemporary T.
occidentale, and has been designated O, while the other
sub-genome is more distantly related to both T. occidentale and T. pallescens, and has been designated P' [12].
Genome-specific sequence haplotypes have been defined
based on the presence of homoeologous sequence variants (HSVs) between homoeoloci. The detection of
genome-specific sequence features allows the selection of
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing
paired homoeoloci. Subsequent characterisation provides
an evaluation of microscale evolutionary divergence
mechanisms between the two sub-genomes.
Sequencing of white clover BACs also permits analysis
of microsynteny with the genomes of Lotus japonicus and
Medicago truncatula, which were chosen as model
legume species and for whole-genome sequencing projects due to modest genome size, diploid genetics and
short life-cycles [13,14]. L. japonicus and M. truncatula
are members of the Hologalegina division of the Fabaceae
and are assigned to the Robinoid and Inverted Repeat
Loss Clade (IRLC) respectively, which share strongly supported sister relationships [15]. Of the two model species,
white clover is more closely related to M. truncatula, as
both are placed in the IRLC and are members of the Trifolieae tribe. Genomic resources available from model
legumes are hence potentially extremely valuable for the
development of genetic tools in white clover. An evalua-

tion of microsynteny will consequently provide a measurement of the value to be gained from each of the
model species.
This study describes the analysis of four paired white
clover homoeologous BACs and provides the first evaluation of divergence between the co-resident O and P' subgenomes for both genic and intergenic regions. A primary estimation of the degree of evolutionary divergence
for the two sub-genomes was also obtained. Finally, syntenic relationships between the genomes of white clover
and the model legumes, as well as A. thaliana, were studied to reveal potential implications for translational
genomics and whole-genome sequencing strategies.

Methods
BAC selection

Arrayed pools from a white clover BAC library constructed from multiple genotypes of cultivar Grasslands
Huia [16] were screened by PCR for clones containing
genes previously identified and characterised in white
clover (Krüppel-like zinc finger protein - ZPT2, dehydration responsive element binding protein - DREB3, dehydrin - DHNb and anthocyanidin reductase - ANR
[12,17]). Each PCR reaction had a total volume of 20 μl
and contained 1 × Immolase PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
200 μM dNTPs, 0.25 μM each primer, 0.4 units Immolase
DNA polymerase (Bioline) and approximately 20 ng BAC
DNA template. Cycling conditions for amplification of all
genes were 95°C for 15 minutes, 35 cycles of 95°C for 1
minute, 55°C for 1 minute, 72°C for 1 minute followed by
a final extension of 72°C for 7 minutes. PCR products
generated from single clones were sequenced to determine the sub-genomic origin of the clone. A total of 5 μl
of each PCR product was purified through addition of 2.5
units of Exonuclease I and 2.5 units of shrimp alkaline
phosphatase (SAP). The reaction was incubated at 37°C
for 60 minutes and enzymes were inactivated at 80°C for
15 minutes. Each sequencing reaction contained 0.16 μM
primer, 0.25 μl BigDye® Terminator v3.1 (Applied Biosystems), 0.875 × BigDye Sequencing Buffer (Applied Biosystems) and 0.5 μl of purified PCR product in a final
volume of 10 μl and subjected to cycling conditions as
described in the BigDye v.3.1 protocol. The extension
products were purified with ethanol, sodium acetate and
EDTA following the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit protocol (Applied Biosystems) and electrophoresis was performed on the ABI3730xl automated
sequencer. Target regions from three of the genes (ZPT2,
DREB3 and DHNb) had previously been isolated and
sequence determined from both white clover subgenomes as well as Trifolium occidentale [12]. For the
ANR selected clone, the ANR region was resequenced
from T. occidentale. Of the two putative progenitor
genomes, only that of T. occidentale was resequenced, as

Hand et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/94

T. pallescens was previously shown to be more divergent
from both the O and P' sub-genomes, and hence uninformative with respect to sub-genome attribution [12]. Of
the BAC clones identified, those containing the sequence
with the highest nucleotide identity to T. occidentale were
designated O, while their counterparts were designated
P'. Validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
were previously discovered and validated for each gene
and used for assignation to homoeologous groups (HGs)
[12,18,19].
BAC isolation, sequencing and assembly

BAC DNA was isolated using the QIAGEN large construct kit and sheared using either a nebuliser (Invitrogen) for 35 seconds at 50 kPA for BAC clones wc11l07,
wc113f04, wc88n22, wc99k01 and wc88b23 or the
HydroShear® (GeneMachines) for 20 cycles with a speed
code of 13 for BAC clones wc38j22, wc32k23, wc36e03,
wc87b16 and wc84n20. Sheared DNA was blunt-end
repaired, dephosphorylated and sub-cloned into the
pCR®4Blunt-TOPO® vector using the TOPO® Shotgun
Subcloning Kit (Invitrogen). Plasmids were transformed
into TOPO10 chemically competent E. coli and grown
overnight at 37°C on LB plates containing 75 μg/ml carbenicillin and 40 μg/ml X-gal to facilitate blue/white colony selection. White colonies were picked and the
recombinant plasmid was amplified using the TempliPhi
DNA Sequencing Template Amplification Kit (GE
Healthcare).
The amplified template was diluted with the addition of
30 μl of ddH2O, of which 3 μl was used as template for
sequencing, as previously described, with T7 and T3
primers. Vector and poor quality sequence was trimmed
using Sequencher 4.7 (Gene Codes) and contigs were
assembled using CAP3 [20] set to default parameters.
Contigs generated previously from partial sequencing of
the P' sub-genome ANR-selected BAC [17] were also
included in the assembly of this clone sequence. Gaps
present in the sequence assembly were filled by fully
sequencing bridging sub-clones. In those cases in which
no clones spanned the gap, primers were designed from
flanking regions to amplify the bridging sequence from
the isolated clone. Each PCR reaction was performed
with 20 ng of BAC DNA as template, and was purified
and sequenced as described previously.
The derived DNA sequences from the selected BAC
clones were deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers
GU443959-GU443960).
Sequence analysis

Gene prediction was performed using alignment against
a white clover EST library [21] and ab initio methods.
These methods used a combination of predictions generated from FGENESH with Medicago truncatula parame-

ters [22], Genscan with Arabidopsis thaliana parameters
and GeneMark with Medicago truncatula [23] parameters. Predicted genes were subjected to BLASTX queries
against the GenBank non-redundant (nr) database to
assign putative function. To identify any putative coding
sequences that the gene prediction methods failed to
detect, 500 bp fragments of BAC sequence were also used
as input for BLASTX searches against the GenBank nonredundant database.
Predicted genes were then classified as homoeologous
when they shared the same putative function. Percentage
identity between homoeologous coding and protein
sequence was calculated using the Smith-Waterman algorithm, with a gap opening penalty of 10 and gap extension
penalty of 0.5 (EMBOSS). Homoeologous genes were
aligned using ClustalX 2.0.12 [24] and synonymous and
non-synonymous substitutions were assessed using the
model of Goldman and Yang [25] as implemented by the
CODEML application of the package PAML [26]. The
predicted time of divergence was then estimated using a
molecular clock estimator of 6.1 × 10-9 substitutions per
synonymous site per year[27-29]. Using LAGAN set to
default parameters [30] global pairwise-alignment was
performed for homoeologous BAC sequences. Subsequent percent identity between the sequences was visualised through a VISTA plot [31]. Repetitive regions were
identified from the Arabidopsis thaliana reference collection of repeats within Repbase using CENSOR [32] and
tandem repeats were discovered using Tandem Repeats
Finder [33].
Predicted coding sequences were subjected to BLASTN
searches against all predicted genes within the Lotus
japonicus [34] and Medicago truncatula (release 3.0) [35]
genomes and against all coding sequence within the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (TAIR9) [36]. Regions of the
model genomes were deemed to be syntenous to the
sequenced white clover regions when they contained 3 or
more predicted genes with an e-value less than or equal
to 0.01. Conservation of intergenic regions between white
clover and the model genomes was investigated using
CoGe [37].

Results
Sequence assembly and annotation

A total of 8 BACs representing 4 homoeologous regions
were selected using the genes listed in Table 1. For those
BACs not sequenced to completion, all analysis was performed using that contig which contained the selected
gene (ZPT2, DREB3, DHNb or ANR). Gene prediction
methods identified a total of 48 genes across all BAC
clones (Additional file 1), 18 which were classified as
homoeologous in nature. On average, when data from
both sub-genomes was combined, one gene was predicted every 9,148 bp and the total proportion of clone

sequence occupied by gene space was 29.90%. The gene
incidence and gene space values were similar between
sub-genomes for regions B, C and D, but the O subgenome sequence from region A appeared to be almost
twice as gene-rich as the P' sub-genome sequence. This
disparity was resolved when only overlapping regions
were compared; the O and P' sub-genomes then displayed
gene incidence values of one gene every 6,375 and 7,286
bp, and the proportions of sequence occupied by gene
space were 46.42% and 33.09%, respectively. The original
observation was due to the very low gene content in the
extra 66 kb that was sequenced from the P' sub-genome.
Of the 48 total predicted unique genes, 15 (31%) are supported by the identification of matching white clover
ESTs and six of these are present in both sub-genomes.
Of these six homoeologous genes, ESTs were identified
only from the O sub-genome for one gene, from the P'
sub-genome for two genes, from both sub-genomes for
one gene and the sub-genome origin of the EST could not
be determined for the remaining two genes. Following
analysis of all predicted genes from both sub-genomes,
the average exon length was 348 bp and the average
intron length was slightly smaller, at 314 bp.
Comparison of homoeologous regions

Conservation of gene content, order and orientation
between the O and P' sub-genomes were identified from
examination of the overlapping sequence for each region
(Figure 1). A total of 51 kb of sequence overlapped for
regions A and B, 50 kb for region C and 21 kb for region
D.
All of the 18 homoeologous genes that were identified
across the four regions were conserved in order and orientation between the two sub-genomes. Exon/intron

structure was also highly conserved, with all but two of
the genes (B.6 and C.11) having the same number of
exons and introns. The two exceptions to the rule both
had an additional predicted exon in the O sub-genome
gene copy. Of the 18 genes, those copies located in the P'
sub-genome had, on average, larger exons with an average
length of 360 bp, as compared to 318 bp for the O subgenome copies. These differences are predominantly due
to insertions or deletions within exons in either subgenome rather than truncations or alternate start sites.
The one exception to this is gene C.8 (MKRP2), which
has an additional 141 bp 3' in the P' sub-genome copy.
The average intron length was also slightly greater for the
P' sub-genome (285 bp) as compared to the O subgenome (268 bp). There was, however, no bias as to which
sub-genome contained the larger introns for each pair of
homoeologous genes. Of the 15 pairs of genes with an
equal number of introns, six had larger introns in the O
sub-genome, six in the P' sub-genome and three are of
equal length.
The level of nucleotide identity between each homoeologous exon ranges from 85.9% to 100%, with an average
value of 97.18% (Table 2). The level of conservation
between introns was on average lower, as expected, but
still very similar ranging from 66.4% to 100% nucleotide
identity with an average of 88.93%. Nucleotide identity
was calculated for each individual exon and intron pair to
determine whether any consistent trend was present in
either direction across the gene space, but no such trend
was observed.
The resulting protein average identity and similarity
between the homoeologous genes was 97.19 and 97.84%
respectively (Table 2). Within these amino acid
sequences, the number of synonymous substitutions per

Figure 1 Gene positions across four homoeologous regions of white clover. Block arrows represent predicted genes, the arrow direction indicating the transcriptional orientation. Gene numbering corresponds to the nomenclature in Additional file 1, and homoeologues are linked by grey
boxes. Coloured rectangles represent transposable elements: blue are Copia LTR retrotransposons and violet are DNA transposons. Plots above and
below the gene schematic are VISTA plots representing percent nucleotide identity between the two sub-genomes. Lines above the plots indicate
coding regions and blue shaded regions within the plot represent exons. The letters A, B, C and D correspond to the 4 sequenced regions, as described
in Table 1.

synonymous site (Ks) ranged from 0 to 0.1179, while the
number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) ranged from 0 to 0.0175. Ks values may
be used to estimate an approximate time of divergence
between the O and P' sub-genomes, assuming that synonymous mutations are selectively neutral and would therefore increase in a linear fashion over time. Using the
median Ks value (0.05085), the predicted time of divergence was estimated as 4.2 million years ago (Mya).
When the four regions were compared, it was evident
that the homoeologous genes from region A were most
conserved, followed by those of regions D, C and B.
Genes from region A showed the highest level of conservation across all measurements (Table 2). However, the
high intron nucleotide identity was the most striking feature, being significantly higher than for the 3 other
regions (p = 0.01) and when averaged (99.55%), was

slightly higher than the exon nucleotide identity of the
same region (99.53%).
There were no predicted genes unique to either
genome within the overlap region for regions B and C,
while region A contained 3 genes unique to the O subgenome (A.8, A.9 and A.14) and 2 genes unique to the P'
sub-genome (A.12 and A.13). Region D also contained a
single predicted gene specific to the O sub-genome (D.5)
and two genes from the P' sub-genome (D.1, D.4). While
it is possible that these unique genes do have a homoeologous counterpart outside the region of overlap, none
were identified in the full-length sequence.
Levels of conservation between sub-genomes across
intergenic sequence was visualised through VISTA plots
for each region (Figure 1). The highest level of conservation was observed from region A, where the conserved
intergenic space never declined beyond 94% nucleotide

level of nucleotide identity identified between introns of
genes from both sub-genomes within this region. The
only part of region A that is not highly conserved is the
section containing predicted sub-genome-specific genes,
in which no similarity resides. Although region A appears
to display the highest levels of conservation between
homoeologous genes and intergenic space, the largest
number of sub-genome-specific predicted genes are also
present. Regions B, C and D differ from A in that the
intergenic sequence shows considerably lower conservation. The predicted homoeologous genes within these
regions are conserved, as is sequence extending upstream
and downstream from the coding sequence, which presumably includes promoter elements. The intergenic
space, however, mostly contains large areas of complete
divergence interrupted by short regions of high nucleotide identity. As with region A, similarity between subgenomes is eliminated in those cases in which subgenome-specific genes (region D) and transposable elements (region B) are predicted. An exception to this rule
is gene D.5, which was only predicted from the O subgenome, but appears to be partially conserved in the P'
sub-genome.

ana (Figure 2). Synteny with L. japonicus is higher for the
chromosome 1 region (clone CM0050) than the duplicated fragment of chromosome 5 (CM0096), with average
synteny quality values of 59 and 34% respectively. Within
A. thaliana, differences of conservation between the two
clones is more difficult to distinguish based on calculated
values, but based on the total number of conserved genes
(6 and 3), the region on chromosome 5 (At5) would again
appear the least conserved of the two. All genes conserved in L. japonicus are in the same order and orientation as found in white clover, with the exception of gene
A.1 which is present on the opposite strand in L. japonicus. Of the six conserved genes identified in the A. thaliana genome, five retain the same order and orientation,
while gene A.3 is present on the opposite strand.
No evidence of conservation between white clover and
M. truncatula could be identified for region A, despite
the much closer evolutionary distance between these two
species as to affinities with L. japonicus or A. thaliana. A
BLASTN search of the GenBank database using gene
A.11 (ZPT2) returned a highly similar (e value = 0) M.
truncatula EST (BT051747), indicating that this gene at
least is present in the M. truncatula genome, but is not
represented in the current public release genome draft.
Region B

Transposable elements

A total of 36 transposable elements (TEs) were identified
across all sequenced BACs (Additional file 2). Of these 36
TEs, 10 are classified as DNA transposons, four non-LTR
retrotransposons, 21 LTR-retrotransposons and one is
unclassified. The LTR retrotransposons were identified as
belonging to the Copia (18) and Gypsy (3) classes. No TEs
were identified from two BACs; wc38j22 (region A, subgenome O) and wc36e03 (region D, sub-genome P').
From the remaining six BACs, the number of TEs predicted per BAC ranged from 1 to 12, representing 0.3 to
22.2% of the derived sequence. The average prevalence of
TEs across these six BACs was one element every 19.6 kb.
Of all the TEs identified, most were located in regions for
which the sequence from each sub-genome did not overlap. There were however, seven elements present in areas
of overlap, each being present in only one sub-genome,
suggesting that these elements were inserted following
divergence of the two sub-genomes.
Microsynteny with Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus
and Arabidopsis thaliana

Evaluation of microsynteny was performed between the
four sequenced white clover genomic regions and the
draft genomes of the model legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus, as well as Arabidopsis thaliana
(Table 3), and the quality of synteny was determined
(Table 4).
Region A

For region A, two orthologous regions were identified on
chromosomes 1 and 5 of both L. japonicus and A. thali-

Region B was found to be conserved in all three model
species studied (Figure 3), and all orthologous genes
retain the same order and orientation between the four
species. The syntenic region identified within M. truncatula is a Phase One assembled clone consisting of 20 unordered fragments, however, only the two fragments
(68,591 bp and 6,248 bp) containing the white clover gene
orthologues, which were separated by 100 unattributed
nucleotides (Ns), were used for comparative analysis. The
synteny quality between white clover and M. truncatula
(average 87.5%) is slightly lower than that observed for L.
japonicus and A. thaliana (both average 91%), largely
because the 50 kb syntenic region from M. truncatula
contains three extra small predicted genes which are not
predicted or present in white clover.
Region C

Overlapping clones AC140122 and CU019606 from M.
truncatula chromosome 3 show extensive synteny with
white clover region C (Figure 4). Gene C.15 is the only
predicted gene absent from this conserved region, of
which the basis of the prediction was identification of a
white clover EST, rather than in silico analysis. As it is
possible that gene prediction algorithms overlooked this
coding region in M. truncatula, the level of conservation
between gene C.15 and the orthologous clones was examined but failed to identify conservation, suggesting that
this gene is indeed specific to white clover. Again, the
average synteny quality value for this region (68%) does
not accurately reflect the high level of gene retention,
largely because the aligned 139 kb segment from M. trun-

catula contains 12 additional and much smaller genes
that were not predicted in white clover. Comparative
analysis of the two regions revealed that 11 of the genes
are not conserved in the white clover genome. The M.
truncatula gene CU019606_5, however, showed similarity (77.88% nucleotide identity) with white clover in the
expected genomic location. Closer inspection revealed
that this conserved area does not contain the first 120 bp
of the gene CU019606_5, explaining the failure of prediction.
A phase 1 assembled L. japonicus clone (CM0113)
which contains five islands of genic sequence, is conserved with region C. The islands of sequence in CM0113
are separated by gaps represented by 100 unattributed
nucleotides (Ns), which makes comparative analysis
between the two species difficult. As the order of the gene
islands from the downloaded CM0113 sequence did not
match that of M. truncatula and white clover, they were
rearranged for the purposes of alignment (Figure 4).
Although it is possible and probable that the six genes are
conserved in order and orientation, this conjecture must
be treated with caution. Nevertheless, the degree of synteny calculated between the genomes of white clover and
L. japonicus for this region averages 86%. White clover
region C is also partially conserved on A. thaliana chromosome 4, with a total of five genes found in the same
order and orientation and an average synteny quality calculated at 65%.
Region D

Of the three model species studied, conservation of
region D was only observed for L. japonicus, in which a
total of three genes are conserved in both order and orientation to produce an average synteny quality of 100%
(Figure 5). No similarity with the M. truncatula genome
was observed for any of the predicted genes from region
D when the version 3 genome release was searched,
despite the presence of a well-characterised ANR (gene
D.2) orthologue (e value = 0) in GenBank (AY184243).

Conservation of orthologous genes

Similarity between white clover genes and their predicted
orthologues was calculated as a measure of percent
nucleotide identity between the coding regions (Additional file 3). As expected, due to the similarity between
the O and P' sub-genomes, there is little difference
between the nucleotide identity of genes from either of
the sub-genomes and the orthologues, neither subgenome being consistently more similar to that of either
model species. When data was combined from both of
the sub-genomes, the average nucleotide identity values
observed with M. truncatula, L. japonicus and A. thaliana coding regions were 82.34, 73.48 and 56.19%, respectively. Ks values were also calculated for orthologues of
the homoeologous genes, and used to estimate pair-wise
times of divergence (Additional file 4). Taking the median
Ks value, the divergence time from M. truncatula was
calculated as 27.5 Mya for the O sub-genome and 26.0
Mya for the P' sub-genome. The time of divergence from
L. japonicus was estimated at 68.0 Mya for the O subgenome and 68.8 Mya for the P' sub-genome. These values provide an internal calibration for estimates of divergence between the O and P' sub-genomes. No sequence
conservation for intergenic spaces was observed between
white clover and any of the three model species.

Discussion
Analysis of the four homoeologous BAC pairs through
sequencing in this study provide an insight into white clover genome structure. The gene density observed (one
gene per 9.7 kb) is lower than that of M. truncatula and L.
japonicus, which has been reported as one gene per 7.94
and 5.75 kb, respectively [38]. As white clover has an estimated genome size of 956 Mb [39], which equates to two
diploid sub-genomes of similar size to those of both M.
truncatula (466 Mb) and L. japonicus (466 Mb) [39],
observed differences in gene density are probably due to
the relatively small size of the regions sampled, which has

resulted in a lower observed gene density compared to
the remainder of the genome. Comparisons of gene density between these three species are also potentially
affected by differing methods of gene prediction used for
each genome. Gene density is also lower than the range
reported from the more distantly related Phaseoloid
legume soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) (one gene per
5.8-9.5 kb) [8,40] and that calculated from similar studies
in another dicotyledonous species, cotton (Gossypium
hirsutum) (one gene per 7.5 kb) [9]. The value is also
lower than that of A. thaliana (one gene per 5 kb) [41],
which has a much smaller genome size (157 Mb).
By selecting four homoeologous BAC pairs, this study
was able to compare sub-genome-specific sequence conservation across multiple regions of the genome, and has
revealed different patterns of conservation and divergence. Region A represents simultaneously both the most
highly and least conserved region, the abrupt divergence
between the sub-genomes being likely to be due to a small

scale deletion. From the point of divergence onwards, the
O sub-genome is more similar to the equivalent regions
in L. japonicus and A. thaliana than to the P' subgenome, suggesting that the deletion has occurred in the
latter. Large-scale deletions have been identified as one of
the few processes known to contribute to genome contraction, and occur through mechanisms such as unequal
homologous recombination and illegitimate recombination [42,43], evidence for which is suggested by the presence of a short (32 bp) sequence repeat at the site of the
deletion event.
The remaining three regions (B, C and D) have mostly
retained homoeologous genes, although the intergenic
space is much more diverged than in region A, with only
abrupt short stretches of conservation. Such patterns are
more typical of relationships between sub-genomes in
polyploids with varying ages of synthesis [8,44-46], such
that divergence times as recent as 0.5-1 Mya show a lack
of conservation between homoeologous genes [47]. In

scription. The major differences between the homoeologous A and D sub-genomes of G. hirsutum are the
presence of sub-genome-specific TEs, which are believed
to be responsible for the c. two-fold difference in subgenome size [9,10]. These findings are consistent with
other generic genome structure comparisons, in which
transposable element proliferation is considered the main
contributing factor to differences in genome size [44,49].
For the four homoeologous regions studied here, TEs did
not contribute substantially to sub-genome variation,
perhaps due to regional sampling bias, but of the seven
TEs identified in overlap regions, all were sub-genome-

specific, similar to other reports of differential accumulation [50].
As the four sampled homoeologous regions have displayed varying levels of conservation in both genic and
intergenic space, it is apparent that multiple sections of
the genome need to be analysed in order to draw conclusions on the divergence of resident sub-genomes within
allopolyploid species. Obviously, selection and analysis of
alternative genomic regions may yield different conservation patterns, and therefore extrapolation of the results
from this work to the O and P' sub-genomes as a whole is
limited by the data from,these four selected regions. A

complete picture of sub-genome divergence, however,
can only be obtained from sequencing of each subgenome. This study is therefore significant for development of sequencing strategies, as measures of homoeologous conservation on this scale have previously not been
reported for white clover.
By calculating the rate of synonymous substitutions
between homoeologous genes within white clover, this
study is able to estimate the time of divergence between
the O and P' genomic regions selected for this study at 4.2
Mya. While this method has previously been used to
determine the elapsed time since evolutionary duplication events within various species [27,28], information
from large EST databases was used, rather than the
smaller number of homoeologous genes used here. As a
consequence, use of thjs data to estimate time since species divergence must be treated with caution. The divergence time estimated between white clover and M.
truncatula (26.7 Mya) does, however, fall within the estimate range of Lavin et al [15], who predicted divergence
between the Trifolieae and Fabeae tribes at c. 17.1 - 30.2
Mya from Bayesian analysis of two chloroplast DNA
genes and a fossil-calibrated approach. The estimated figure for O and P' sub-genome separation (4.2 Mya) is also
well below the 17.1 Mya minimum, as would be expected.
The divergence estimate between white clover and L.
japonicus observed in the current study (68.4 Mya) is,
however, somewhat higher than the range of 47.7 - 52.7
Mya predicted by Lavin et al [15]. This is likely to be a
consequence of small sampling size and unusually high
Ks values for a number of these genes, as reflected in the
larger standard deviation of Ks values observed for L.
japonicus (0.6020) compared to M. truncatula (0.1137).
In each instance, orthologous regions identified from
M. truncatula and L. japonicus were located on the chromosomes predicted from previous studies of macrosynteny [51,52]. For the two conserved regions detected from
L. japonicus and A. thaliana for region A, both macrosynteny studies and observed synteny quality suggest
that the fragments from chromosome 1 (region A.1) are
the true orthologues and that the conserved fragments
from chromosome 5 (region A.2) are duplicated regions
that have been previously identified within the genome of
each species [53,54]. The relative lack of utility of the M.
truncatula genome for identification of microsyntenic
regions was unexpected and surprising. As the two species are located within the same sub-family of Galegoid
legumes, the M. truncatula genome sequence is the most
closely related available reference genome for white clover. However, M. truncatula orthologous regions were
only identified for two of the four sequenced white clover
regions. It is possible that due to sampling of only two
white clover chromosomes, (Table 1) this study has
obtained a biased assessment of utility of the M. truncat-

Page 12 of 14

ula genome release. For the two regions in which white
clover-M. truncatula microsynteny was observed, the
quality level suggests that the two genomes are similar in
structure, as expected from phylogenetic and macrosynteny studies [15,52], and observations in this study are
due to identification of gaps in the current genome draft
release. This is further supported by the identification of
M. truncatula orthologues for the genes A.11 (ZPT2) and
D.2 (ANR) in GenBank which are absent from the M.
truncatula genome release 3.0. As this M. truncatula
genome release is preliminary and incomplete, it is likely
that future genome releases will reveal syntenic clones for
white clover regions A and D.
In contrast, despite a greater evolutionary distance, L.
japonicus genome comparison have obtained impressive
levels of conservation (average 84% synteny quality) for
all corresponding white clover regions. As the two species are predicted to have diverged approximately 50
Mya, this level of microsynteny is impressive and larger
than that previously observed for comparisons between
other legume species. Mudge et al. [40] reported an average synteny quality of 60% between 400 kb of sequence
from M. truncatula and G. max, which are estimated to
have diverged approximately 54 Mya [15], and similar levels have also been observed between M. truncatula and L.
japonicus (62%) [38,51]. While each individual region
analysed here is smaller than in previous studies, and
hence may once again be vulnerable to biased sampling,
the high level of conservation is consistent across four
separate areas of the genome. Conservation with the A.
thaliana genome was also higher than might have been
expected, given that the two species are thought to have
shared a common ancestor approximately 100 Mya
[55,56]. Conserved regions were identified for three of
the four regions analysed, and synteny quality averaged
68%. This level of conservation is consistent with other
legume-specific studies, in which blocks of synteny in
A.thaliana have been found for M. truncatula, L. japonicus and G. max [40,57,58].
Evaluation of microsynteny in this study has important
implications for the design of whole genome sequencing
strategies. The fully sequenced genomes of model species
provide fundamental resources for translational genomics, and can potentially act as scaffolds for both physical
mapping and next-generation whole genome sequencing
of closely related species. The Oryza Map Alignment
Project (OMAP) provides an example of this process,
such that physical maps of an additional 12 Oryza species
are being generated through the use of the fully
sequenced rice genome as a framework for construction
[59]. With the growth of next-generation sequencing
technologies, production of a draft white clover genome
sequence is a realistic possibility. The similarity between
the O and P' sub-genomes as observed here, however,

Hand et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/94

would render an accurate sequence assembly of the allotetraploid genome extremely difficult. The most effective
strategy, therefore, would probably be to first sequence
the genome of T. occidentale, the most probable of the
diploid progenitors. Based on this study, it is likely that
the genome drafts of both M. truncatula and L. japonicus
would then be able to act as scaffolds for the whole
genome sequence assembly. While de novo assembly may
be challenging from the short reads generated by the
next-generation sequencing platforms, a strategy combining single and paired-end reads (with c. 2-5 kb inserts)
is conceivable based upon the gene density and subgenome sequence conservation described in this study.
The most successful genome assembly, however, is likely
to be the result of a hybrid de novo and reference physical
mapping approaches.

Conclusions
This work provides the first detailed analysis of homoeologous sub-genome similarity across selected white clover
genomic regions in T. repens. A high level of homoeologous gene retention was generally observed for all four
genomic regions studied, except in those cases in which
small scale deletions were present. The degree of intergenic sequence divergence, however, varied between each
region. This research also detected conserved microsynteny between T. repens and L. japonicus for each of the
analysed regions. Surprisingly, microsynteny between T.
repens and M. truncatula was detected for only two of the
four regions, but the quality of synteny was high. In most
cases, conserved gene order could also be extended to A.
thaliana. These findings suggest that the sequenced
genomes of the model legumes, and in particular that of
L. japonicus, will be valuable for the future development
of genomic resources in white clover.
