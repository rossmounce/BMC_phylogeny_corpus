Abstract
Background: Repetitive elements comprise ~45% of mammalian genomes and are increasingly
known to impact genomic function by contributing to the genomic architecture, by direct
regulation of gene expression and by affecting genomic size, diversity and evolution. The ubiquity
and increasingly understood importance of repetitive elements contribute to the need to identify
and annotate them. We set out to identify previously uncharacterized repetitive DNA in the
porcine genome. Once found, we characterized the prevalence of these repeats in other mammals.
Results: We discovered 27 repetitive elements in 220 BACs covering 1% of the porcine genome
(Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative; CVSI). These repeats varied in length from 55 to
1059 nucleotides. To estimate copy numbers, we went to an independent source of data, the BACend sequences (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), covering approximately 15% of the porcine
genome. Copy numbers in BAC-ends were less than one hundred for 6 repeat elements, between
100 and 1000 for 16 and between 1,000 and 10,000 for 5. Several of the repeat elements were
found in the bovine genome and we have identified two with orthologous sites, indicating that these
elements were present in their common ancestor. None of the repeat elements were found in
primate, rodent or dog genomes. We were unable to identify any of the replication machinery
common to active transposable elements in these newly identified repeats.
Conclusion: The presence of both orthologous and non-orthologous sites indicates that some
sites existed prior to speciation and some were generated later. The identification of low to
moderate copy number repetitive DNA that is specific to artiodactyls will be critical in the assembly
of livestock genomes and studies of comparative genomics.

Background
Repetitive elements comprise ~45% [1] of mammalian
genomes and are increasingly known to impact genomic
function by contributing to the genomic architecture, by
direct regulation of gene expression [2,3] and by affecting
genomic size, diversity and evolution [4-8]. The ubiquity
and increasingly understood importance of repetitive elements (REs) contribute to the need to identify and anno-

tate REs [9]. In recent years, several attempts have been
made to automate the process of de novo identification
and characterization of REs [10-16]. The algorithms take
into account the likely evolutionary history of the REs –
not only genetic drift, but also the processes that lead to
the juxtaposition of REs [10]. Because knowing the evolutionary history of each RE helps to define the type of RE,
these algorithms are valuable not only in identifying

repetitive sequence, but also in increasing our understanding of the evolutionary role of the identified RE. Our
initial attempt was to identify novel repetitive DNA with
a program called RECON [10], which produced 14,067
families of REs with 249 of those having count numbers
of 10 or more. We decided a different approach was
needed that would organize closely related elements in a
parsimonious way. In this paper, we describe 27 novel
porcine repetitive elements and estimate their prevalence
in swine and other species.

Results
We identified repetitive elements using a procedure similar to previously published methods [10,11]. First, we
used RepeatMasker [17] on the BAC sequences to mask
out previously characterized repeat elements. Second, we
identified all pair-wise alignments among masked
sequences using BLAST [18]. Third, we identified multiple
copy sequence segments with alignments to many sites (≥
10). Fourth, we clustered sites linked by pair-wise alignments and constructed phylogenetic trees. Fifth, excessive
variation (2-fold) in copy number within a putative RE
caused it to be divided; co-localization of RE among many
sites caused them to be merged. Sixth, we examined flanking sequences of putative RE for clues about replication
machinery or to consolidate RE that should be merged.
Seventh, we estimated the prevalence of RE in an independent set of porcine sequences as well as in the
genomes of other species.
Our method compared to RECON
The bulk of the automated parts of our process, Steps 2
through 4, were very similar to RECON [4]. RECON does
not appear to have analogues for Steps 1 (RepeatMasker),
5, 6, or 7. We utilized Step 1 to steer us away from previously characterized repetitive. We utilized the manually
intensive Steps 5–7 to achieve a more parsimonious
(smaller number of repeat families) than appeared to be
possible with RECON alone. In this sense, we envision
that our method is a complement to RECON, not a
replacement.
Steps 1 – 4
Thirty-six percent of the sequence was masked by RepeatMasker. Comparing all unmasked sequence fragments (≥
50 bp) produced 1,334,953 pair-wise alignments. One
thousand five hundred seventy-nine highly redundant
sequences (totaling 1.07 Mb) were identified that had a
minimum of 10 hits for at least 50 contiguous bases. Sixty
putative repeat element families resulted from clustering
the 1579 highly redundant sequences. The repeat element
families were labeled MPRE1 – MPRE60 (for Meat Animal
Research Center Porcine Repetitive Element). Their
lengths ranged from 55 to 1059 bp and their copy num-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/304

bers (across the 220 discovery BACs) ranged from 12 to
1102.
Steps 5 – 6
The 60 original MPREs were consolidated into 31 because
of overlap or co-localization at multiple sites. Twentynine MPREs were absorbed into 31; the 31 original MPRE
identifiers of the longer sequences were kept to maintain
provenance. In addition, there were three combinations
(MPRE20 and 57; MPRE15, 17, 19 and 26; MPRE44, 50
and 52) of repeats that frequently appeared together in the
same order with some variation in their relative spacing.
The most consistent group contained two elements –
MPRE20 in reverse complement followed by a small gap,
then MPRE57. All thirteen times that MPRE20 occurred, it
occurred in this grouping. MPRE57 occurred 13 out of 14
times in this grouping. Naturally, we concluded that
MPRE20 (600 bp) and MPRE57 (204 bp) were two parts
of a longer RE that had a variable middle (100–250 bp
range for all but one example). After examining the alignment in ClustalX, we could see that the middle was conserved except for an 84 bp deletion in one instance and a
67 bp insertion in another. Further review of the BACs
showed that the 13 groups containing MPRE20 and
MPRE57 sometimes occurred in overlapping regions
between pairs of clones in the BAC collection, meaning
that we only had 7 unique loci plus one very unique locus
that had a PRE1a (Porcine Repeat Element 1a, as identified by RepeatMasker) inserted into the gap. There was no
pattern to the gap in the other instances. We include this
longer repeat element in our list of novel porcine repeat
elements as MPRE61, which is more fully described in a
later section.

The final alteration to the list of MPREs was the removal
of MPRE48 due to its low copy number in the set of
275,595 porcine BAC-ends supplied by the Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute (hereafter shortened to "Sanger")
[19]. Surprisingly, MPRE48 was found to appear less frequently, only six times, in BAC-ends (335.9 Mb) than in
the much smaller portion of the genome spanned by the
set of fully sequenced BACs (36.4 Mb) from which the
MPREs were derived. That brings the final number of
novel repeat elements reported here to 27, although we
decided against removing MPRE48 from the fasta file of
MPREs, see Additional file 1.
Step 7
Table 1 lists the MPREs along with their observed count
numbers in the TIGR (The Institute of Genomic Research,
Rockville, MD) Sus scrofa Gene Index [20] and the Sanger
BAC-end sequences [19]. Noting that the data set of BACends is 4.8 times larger than the TIGR Gene Index
(104,328 entries of expressed swine sequence totalling

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/304

70.0 Mb), we conclude that all the novel repeats occur less
frequently in expressed sequence than in genomic DNA.
The prevalence of these newly identified REs was compared to that of known REs. Three of the newly discovered
porcine REs, MPRE11, 16 and 38, were more common
than the LINE element L3 and one, MPRE42, was about as
common as L3 (Table 1). The other 23 MPREs have lower
count numbers. In the Sanger archive of 275,595 BACends, the number of elements for all SINEs was 203,206,
for all LINES was 116,107 and for all LTRs (Long Terminal
Repeats) was 25,066 based on RepeatMasker. Looking
specifically at the LINEs, the most common by far was L1
with 94,325, followed by L2 with 18,720 and L3 is third
with 2,358.
These newly discovered repeat elements did not appear to
be duplicated genes, LINE elements or expressed sequence
that was transposed by a LINE element. To address these
questions, the MPREs were translated and compared

(BLAST) to the GenBank nr database and only one strong
hit was found. MPRE1 hit Sus scrofa interferon alpha-1
precursor with a bit score of 352, so it was eliminated
from further consideration as a novel RE. For comparison,
the highest bit score of MPREs reported here was less than
50. The repeats were also compared (BLAST) to vectors,
mitochondrial DNA, and tRNAs. The middle of MPRE58
did have high similarity to tRNA-GLU; otherwise, there
were no substantial high-scoring pairs.

Discussion
Certain difficulties arise when defining repeat elements.
One is that REs often are present as mosaics of smaller
subsets of commonly occurring sequences [21,22].
Another is that REs can often sustain considerable mutations, including large truncations and insertions. Two
extreme examples of this are the truncation of the 5' end
during retrotransposition, and the insertion of one RE
into the middle of another. A third difficulty requiring resolution is that segmental duplication will create very long

repeated sequences that do not retro-transpose together,
and therefore should be broken up into their retro-transposable component parts. RECON, the software for identification of REs described by Bao and Eddy, handles all
three of these difficulties [10].
Our approach was intentionally a bit more simplistic. We
were able to create a much more parsimonious set of RE
than what we were able to generate with RECON. Whereas
RECON intends to recreate the full repeat elements in the
way that will make for the best possible additions to the
RepeatMasker database, as well as aid in the study of the
evolutionary history of the repeat elements, our goal was
to mask out the most commonly repeated regions of the
porcine genome. The technique we found most useful in
refining the definitions of the MPREs was to plot the frequency of BLAST hits as a function of position within the
sequence of the putative repeat elements. From the criteria
used to define them, the number of hits was at least 10
across the whole sequence – but many showed a much
higher hit frequency along part of their lengths. For purposes of comparison, we applied RECON to our pair-wise
alignments from Step 2. RECON divided the 1,334,953
BLAST hits into 29,631 potential repeat elements that
were then grouped into 14,067 families. Only 249 of
these families had 10 or more elements. Note that it is
possible for a family containing only one element to correspond to many BLAST hits. Rather than continue with
so many families, we found that our method yielded a
more parsimonious classification of moderately repetitive
elements. One difference between the two methods was
that our method required a minimum copy number prior
to the formation of families of repeat elements.
The MPREs have no clear connections to known proteins.
The NCBI BLASTX results for these sequences were typically a combination of description-less accessions and
unrelated proteins in a variety of organisms. That
remained true when the dataset was compared to the
TIGR gene index for Sus scrofa [20].
The novel repeat elements were compared to known types
of repeats – SINEs, LINEs and LTRs – and did not fit the
definitions for those classes of repeat elements. Because
RepeatMasker would mask out low-complexity regions,
the methods used here would not initially find the tail
ends of LTRs. Each MPRE was tested for nearby low-complexity regions and none were consistently found. One of
the characteristics of SINEs is the presence of tRNA coding
sequence in their 5 prime regions [23,24]. Only MPRE58
had a region similar to tRNA, and that was in the middle
of its sequence. LINEs are best characterized by their two
ORFs – one coding for a reverse transcriptase and the
other for a protein with RNA binding activity [6]. All the
MPREs were translated to potential proteins and com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/304

pared to a comprehensive database (NCBI BLASTX). None
of the results were similar to the possible translations of a
LINE.
Counting repeat elements is challenging
Because of the degeneracy of repetitive elements it is difficult to arrive at an accurate count in the target genome.
Another difficulty in the quantification of repeat elements
is that REs are often composed of smaller repeat units that
occur more frequently than the larger unit [21,22].

To characterize the prevalence of MPREs, we went to an
independent data set, the Sanger BAC-ends from the
CHORI-242 library archived at Ensembl [19]. Table 1 lists
three different measures of prevalence of MPRE within
these BAC-ends. The first measure (BLAST hits to BACends) gives the number of hits that were at least half the
length of the repeat element. An issue here is the typical
size of the traces – an average of 1219 bp. The longer REs
will tend to be under-counted due to edge effects in the
trace archive. The next two measures of count number
were calculated by plotting the number of BLAST hits as a
function of position on the RE. Some of the resulting plots
were smooth and flat across most of the RE with an
expected drop-off near each end. For these "regular" plots
the count number was the average value of the middle
90% of the plot amplitude. Other plots varied quite a bit
in amplitude across the RE. This was likely due to subrepeats that hit in areas of the genome that the whole
repeat did not. During this measure of count number
there was no lower limit to the size of the hit other than
that needed to get the expectation value below 0.1. These
were considered irregular and the algorithm for determining their count number was to take the smallest value on
the plot after ignoring the first and last 10% of the plot. A
few plots were only mildly irregular, and for those both
the regular and irregular algorithms were used with both
numbers reported in Table 1.
Comparing the novel repeat element content across
genomes
The sequences of novel porcine repetitive elements listed
here were compared (BLAST [25]) to a recent build of the
complete cow genome (AAFCO2 from [26]) as well as
against the mouse and human genomes. In the case of
mouse, there were no significant similarities found. The
comparison to the human genome yielded only one significant hit – a 37 bp long section of MPRE17 (870 bp
long) matched once in chromosome 9 thousands of bp
away from any annotated features. The comparison to the
cow genome yielded a variety of results. Five of the 27
MPREs did not hit at all (MPREs 6, 22, 28, 50 and 60), and
three others (MPREs 44, 49 and 61) had ten or fewer hits
(Table 1), despite the fact that the cow genome contains
ten times more sequence than the collection of porcine

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:304

BAC-ends tested. Fourteen of the 27 MPREs appeared frequently in cow as well as pig, as indicated by having at
least 1000 BLAST hits to the cow genome.
Not surprisingly, the bovine hits tend to be shorter than
the porcine hits because the MPREs were defined from pig
sequence and as such would be expected to be more intact
in porcine. What is interesting is that in both species the
endpoints of the hits have a strong tendency to line up to
particular spots in the MPRE, as shown in Figure 1 using
MPRE12, 15, 17, 41, 51 and 58 as examples. Sometimes
the common endpoints are the same in both species,
sometimes not. This could be a result of the repeat elements being comprised of smaller repeat elements, not all
of which have the same frequency of occurrence in either
genome. The longer MPREs often had more than one subregion with multiple extra hits. This, too, could be evidence of internal repeat structure.
Figure 2 shows that MPRE55 occurs in both swine and cattle in orthologous loci. The pig BAC lies along the x-axis,
and the cow BAC lies along the y-axis. Also plotted are line
segments of high similarity between the two BACs. The
preponderance of these segments demonstrates little
genomic rearrangement between species, which indicates
that these are orthologous regions of likely common
ancestry between the two species. This region is highly
similar to the human contig NT_005403.16 and the locus
of MPRE55 corresponds to the 3' UTR of the model gene
LOC643405, which codes for a protein similar to TGFbeta induced apoptosis protein 2.
Because the collection of BACs spans only 1% of the
whole pig or cow genome, we cannot rule out the possibility that all of the MPREs have at least one orthologous
location in both species. The fact that 12 MPREs did not
have blast hits in any of the cow BACs makes it seem likely
that those 12 are relatively recent evolutionary occurrences. Of the 10 MPREs that appear most frequently in
the cow, only two, MPRE55 and MPRE59, were observed
to appear in orthologous locations among the tested set of
fully-sequenced BACs.
A phylogenetic analysis was performed on the different
integration sites of MPRE55 from both the cow and pig
BAC libraries using ClustalX (see Additional file 2 for the
sequences), and the output (Additional file 3) was then
input into R [27] to create Figure 3. The sequences that
occurred at orthologous locations in swine and cattle are
highlighted. As expected, the pig branches and cow
branches tend to be separate. It is notable that the most
similar sequences that occur in both species do not come
from orthologous locations, but seem to be found in loci
that originated after the cow and pig ancestral lines
diverged. The evolutionary distance between them is rep-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/304

resented by the sum of horizontal distances that one must
travel along the tree to connect the two sequences. The
leftmost part of that path represents a common ancestor.
It is not surprising that the two sequences in question
have individually diverged a significant amount from the
original sequence of the common ancestor at that locus.
The more surprising result is that some of the pig and cow
sequences are more similar to each other than the
sequences at the oldest loci. Coincidental convergence is
an unlikely possibility. A more likely explanation is that
enough copies of the old sequence were created that some
of them experienced much less mutation than the
diverged sequences at the ancestral locus. The most recent
common ancestors (MRCA) occurred in a narrow window
of time (evolutionary) relative to the full extent of the tree
(< 1/5 of the distance from the root to the most peripheral
branch). The MRCA among the orthologous sites occurred
within the same time frame as the other MRCA. The tree
clearly shows considerable radiation following speciation
as evidenced by large genetic distances from MRCA to
peripheral tips.
A closer look at MPRE61
Allelic differences or SNP can be identified from cases
where MPRE61 sites coincide with overlaps among CVSI
BACs. MPRE61 sites coincide with 3 pairs of overlapping
BACs, 1 (AC145413 and AC144901), 2 (AC139879,
AC140099) and 3 (AC146932 and AC087424). In addition, an MPRE61 site coincided with a group of 3 overlapping BACs, including AC138784, AC138788 and
AC138786. Overlapping BAC pair 2 had two single base
differences, and pair 3 had 3 single base differences and
one 43 bp insertion/deletion. No sequence differences
were observed within MPRE61 for pair 1 or the group of 3
overlapping BACs.

To put the apparent allelic diversity rates into context, we
examined the genetic sources of the DNA used to construct the BAC library (RPCI-44). The source of DNA for
RPCI-44 was a pooled sample with equal contributions
from 4 male crossbred pigs each comprised of 3/8 Landrace, 3/8 Yorkshire and ¼ Meishan [28]. The probability
of identifying SNP increases with the diversity of genomes
sampled. For the cases of 2 overlapping BACs, the probability of sampling different genomes is 87.5%, different
breeds is 65.7%, and one BAC of western (Landrace or
Yorkshire) origin and the other of Meishan origin is
37.5%. The probability of sampling diverse genomes is
higher for the case of 3 overlapping BACs. The probability
of sampling more than one genome is 98.4%, more than
one breed is 87.9%, and at least one BAC of western origin
combined with one BAC of Meishan origin is 56.25%. The
fact that we didn't observe SNP in one of the three pairs of
overlapping BACs is not that unusual given that the probability of sampling identical genomes with at least one of

the group of 3 overlapping BACs given the relatively high
probabilities of diverse genomes being sampled is unexpected.
To bolster the relatively small number of distinct MPRE61
loci (7) identified in the CVSI BACs, we further investigated the prevalence and diversity of MPRE61 by cloning
and sequencing PCR amplification products derived from
16 pigs sampled from 10 breeds (Berkshire, Chester
White, Duroc, Hampshire, Landrace, Meishan, Pietrain,
Poland China, Spot, and Yorkshire). We used primers
designed to match the highly conserved parts of MPRE61
to amplify and clone (see Methods for details) multiple
and variable loci for the RE that are differentiable by size
as well as sequence. The different breeds showed indistinguishable smears on denaturing PAGE gels including
many different sizes. Too many fragments and too many
sizes were present to identify allelic differences in sizes
among animals. The PCR products were sequenced to
yield 91 reads that were not bacterial or vector contamination. The 91 sequences (listed as a fasta file in Additional
file 4) were analyzed with Clustal X (creating a dendrogram file, Additional file 5) and displayed in Figure 4 as a
phylogenetic tree. The topology of the tree (number of
diverse nodes) is consistent with the estimated copy
number of 300 sites in the whole genome given in Table
1. We speculate that the more similar sequences represented as tips close (with few sequence differences) to
their common ancestor are probably allelic differences at
the same locus. On the other hand, the more diverse tips
and peripheral nodes probably represent different sites or
loci. The amount of sequence diversity presented in Figure
4 supports the idea that individual integration sites (loci)
and alleles of repetitive elements can be uniquely identified by high-throughput array based assays by hybridizing
samples to short probes. This demonstrates that repetitive
DNA with similar properties to MPRE61 (i.e., prevalence
and diversity) can be harnessed for genetic and physical
mapping [29]. This dispels the long standing myth that
repetitive DNA should always be avoided because it is
intractable. Our results indicate that some classes (low to
intermediate copy number and highly diverse) of repetitive DNA would be tractable with high-throughput technologies.
MPRE61 size differences are not randomly distributed
throughout the phylogenetic tree. Different sizes cluster
on different branches of the tree; however, the clustering
is not complete. This indicates that insertions and deletions (evolutionary events that cause size differences)
occurred throughout the evolution of MPRE61, and in
some cases while the element was still replicating. The

Phylogeny of MPRE55 in pig and cow
Phylogeny of MPRE55 in pig and cow. The phylogram displays the BLAST hits obtained from querying MPRE55 against the
fully sequenced BAC libraries for pig and cow. The red dots indicate examples of MPRE55 from the cow and the black dots
indicate pig examples. The orthologous sites depicted in Figure 2 are noted by the grey dashed lines and the word "orthologues." Also shown are the Most Recent Common Ancestors (MRCA) between species in green and, in blue, the MRCA for
the 2 orthologues (OMRCA). In both cases the BACs covered about 1% of the total genome. The MRCA lie within a relatively
narrow band of time consistent with a single speciation event and there appears to be considerable radiation among elements
following speciation (i.e., time frame spanning MRCA).

incomplete clustering of sizes indicates evolutionary plasticity and as a result recurrent insertions and deletions.
MPRE61 was further characterized by plotting BLAST hits
of it to the 275,595 sequences in the trace archive of BACends submitted by Sanger. These were plotted along with
the repeat elements recognized by RepeatMasker. The
most interesting observations included the fact that three
times among the 140 hits a PRE1 was incorporated into
MPRE61. PRE1 is a porcine specific SINE that is included

in the RepeatMasker library. Several other examples
existed of PRE1 next to a section of MPRE61, but the trace
end occurred next to the PRE1, so that it may or may not
have had the continuing section of MPRE61 on its other
side. No other REs were found to be incorporated into
MPRE61, suggesting that MPRE61 replicated relatively
recently. Another interesting observation was that the
density of REs on the 3' side of MPRE61 was much higher
than on the 5' side. To take a closer look at this, we collected the trace sequence 3' of the 62 hits that ended near

Figure 4
Diversity of MPRE61 across ten breeds of pig
Diversity of MPRE61 across ten breeds of pig. This phylogram displays the variety of sequences obtained by amplifying
MPRE61 in 16 DNA samples from ten breeds of pig. Size differences are highlighted using colored dots according to the legend.
Size cut-offs were chosen to lie between modes of the size distribution which were well separated.

(within 60 bp of) the 3' end of MPRE61 (length of 1059
bp). This flanking sequence, ranging in length from 12 to
1368 nucleotides, was analyzed for repeat content and
distance of that content from the end of MPRE61 (Figure
5). Running RepeatMasker on the entire collection
(275,595 sequences) of Sanger BAC-ends shows that the
number of SINE elements is 75% greater than the number
of LINE elements (203,206 vs. 116,107). The LINEs tend
to be longer than the SINEs, so the total percentage of
sequence occupied by the LINEs is actually larger (13.29%
vs. 10.29%). The most obvious feature of Figure 5 is that
LINEs are significantly over represented on the 3 prime

side of MPRE61, particularly in the region closest to the
end of MPRE61. For the 22 LINEs that occur within 80 bp
of the end of MPRE61, 15 are oriented on the opposite
strand and 7 on the same strand. At this point, there is no
way to know which strand of MPRE61 might be transcribed. We arbitrarily chose one of the strands and used
it consistently. Because the LINEs have a particular internal structure, the 5' and 3' ends are well defined. So
another way of looking at the result would be to say that
the LINEs occur on the 5' end of MPRE61 (or rather, its
reverse complement) with 15 on the same strand and 7 on
the opposite strand. Either way, there is less strand conser-

vation than would be expected if MPRE61 used LINEs as
a vehicle for either replication or integration.

Conclusion
From our experience, it seems that although some available programs may help with the process of identification
of REs, a level of judiciousness is also required. The BLAST
and phylogenetic analyses are proven to be useful to
improve the efficacy, particularly when comparisons are
made across species. Discovering the RE in one dataset
and characterizing their prevalence and diversity in
another was crucial to our effort.
Using an approach similar to previously published work
but modified to fit our specific goals and data, several
repetitive elements were identified in porcine and bovine
genomes that do not exist in mouse or human. These elements do not contain signatures of previously identified
retrotransposons, but seem to have undergone replication
and mutation. Because these elements are in a lower copy
number than most of the REs that make up mammalian
genomes, they could be exploited in mapping or wholegenome association studies. As the porcine genome
sequencing effort progresses, we should know more about
the distribution, history and possible contribution of
these repeats to the genomic architecture in artiodactyls.
The genuine challenge of genome sequencing and assembly would be enhanced with an improved understanding
of repeat elements and their distributions, especially those
repeat elements that are species specific.

Methods
Bioinformatics
Two hundred-twenty fully sequenced porcine BACs generated by the Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative
[30,31] were downloaded from the RPCI-44 clone library,
totaling 36.4 Mb. RepeatMasker [17] masked out 36% of
this sequence. All unmasked fragments of sequence that
were at least 50 bp long were compared (BLAST) to the
original data set. The BLAST parameters used were those
recommended by Korf et al. (2003) for finding repeat elements, namely -r 1 -q -1 -G 2 -E 2 -W 9 -F "m D" -e 1 for
NCBI-BLAST [32]. The output, which contained
1,334,953 hits, was analyzed using two similar methods.
One was to use the RECON software [10] downloaded
from its website [33] and the other used separate, original
PERL scripts that performed several of the same functions
included in the RECON package.
PCR and sequencing
Primer pairs for amplification of genomic DNA were
designed from consensus MPRE61 sequences using
Primer3 [34]. Primer sequences were 5'-TTTTCCTGTGGTGATTTGTGA-3' and 5'-GGGCGCTGGACTGCTCAAA-3'

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/304

(positions 278–298 and 953-935 (5' to 3' on opposite
strand) of MPRE61, respectively). PCR was performed in
a PTC-225 DNA engine (MJ Research Inc, Watertown,
MA) using 0.25 U Hot Star® Taq polymerase (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA), 1X of supplied buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
200 µM dNTPs, 0.8 µM each primer, and 100 ng of
genomic DNA in 25 µl reactions. The PCR mixture was
held at 94°C for 15 min, and cycled 44 times at 94°C for
20 sec, held at 57°C annealing temperature for 30 sec and
extension at 72°C for 1.5 min, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Five µl of the PCR reaction was
electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels to determine quality
of amplification and a portion (2–4 µl) was used for cloning in pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Plasmid DNA was prepared using standard alkaline lysis
and PTFE filter plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and was
sequenced with T7 primer.
