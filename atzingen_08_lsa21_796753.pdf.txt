Abstract
Background: It has been well documented over past decades that interaction of pathogens with
the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a primary role in host cell attachment and invasion. Adherence
to host tissues is mediated by surface-exposed proteins expressed by the microorganisms during
infection. The mechanisms by which pathogenic leptospires invade and colonize the host remain
poorly understood since few virulence factors contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease have
been identified. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of L. interrogans allowed identification of a
repertoire of putative leptospiral surface proteins.
Results: Here, we report the identification and characterization of a new leptospiral protein that
exhibits extracellular matrix-binding properties, called as Lsa21 (leptospiral surface adhesin, 21
kDa). Compatible with its role in adhesion, the protein was shown to be surface-exposed by
indirect immunofluorescence. Attachment of Lsa21 to laminin, collagen IV, and plasma fibronectin
was specific and dose dependent. Laminin oxidation by sodium metaperiodate reduced the proteinlaminin interaction in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that laminin sugar moieties are
crucial for this interaction. The gene coding for Lsa21 is present in pathogenic strains belonging to
the L. interrogans species but was not found in the saprophytic L. biflexa serovar Patoc strain Patoc
1. Loss of gene expression occurs upon culture attenuation of pathogenic strains. Environmental
factors such as osmolarity and temperature affect Lsa21 expression at the transcriptional level.
Moreover, anti-Lsa21 serum labeled liver and kidney tissues of human fatal cases of leptospirosis.
Conclusion: Our data suggest a role of Lsa21 in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.

Background
Leptospirosis, a worldwide zoonotic infection, is an
important human and veterinary health problem. Caused
by spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira, the disease
presents greater incidence in tropical and subtropical
regions [1,2]. The transmission of leptospirosis has been
associated with exposure of individuals near to wild or
farm animals [3]. Recently, the disease has been prevalent
in cities with sanitation problems and a large population
of urban rodent reservoirs, which contaminate the environment through their urine [4]. In the host, leptospirosis
has a biphasic clinical presentation beginning with a septicemic followed by an immune phase with antibody production and urinary excretion of leptospires. Children
primarily show fever, vomiting, headache, diarrhea,
abdominal and generalized muscle pain, whereas adults
have fever, headache, anorexia, muscle pain and constipation [4,5]. The most severe form of leptospirosis, known
as Weil's syndrome, seen in 5 to 15% of patients, is a multisystemic febrile illness, chiefly with hepatic, renal and
pulmonary involvement and a mortality rate of 5 to 40%
[4]. Leptospirosis also has a great economic impact in the
agricultural industry because the disease affects livestock
inducing abortions, stillbirths, infertility, reduced milk
production and death [3,4].
The advent of whole-genome sequencing has greatly
impacted on the microbial field with the development of
new large-scale technologies, such as bioinformatics. This
approach has the advantage of revealing proteins independently of their abundance and without the need of
culturing the microorganism in vitro [6]. Functional
genomic studies, including transcription profiles, gene
cloning, protein expression and characterization complement the in silico analysis and help in understanding the
bacterial pathogenesis. The genome of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni has been sequenced and in silico analysis
identified more than 200 predicted outer membrane proteins [7,8]. These proteins are potential targets for inducing immune responses during host infection and
therefore, constitute targets for immune protection
through mechanisms such as antibody-dependent phagocytosis and killing mediated by complement. In addition,
it is possible that some of these membrane proteins mediate the initial adhesion to host cells [9-11]. Leptospiral
adhesins have been described: a 36-kDa fibronectin-binding protein of unknown identity isolated from the outer
sheath of a virulent variant of pathogenic leptospires [11],
a 24-kDa laminin-binding protein named Lsa24 [9]/LfhA
[12], LigA and LigB proteins [10]. More recently, Lsa24
[9]/LfhA [12] was shown to belong to a paralog family
designated Leptospira endostatin-like proteins (Len) [13].
Some proteins of the Len family were capable to bind host
fibronectin [13]. Fibronectin binding activity has been
also shown with LigA and LigB proteins [10] and a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/70

domain of the LigB protein that contributes to this binding has recently been described [14].
Several predicted surface-coding sequences were selected
from the genome of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni
and are under study in our laboratory [8,9,15]. In the
present study, we focused on a novel hypothetical protein
of unknown function, encoded by the gene LIC10368.
The gene was cloned and the protein expressed using E.
coli as a heterologous host system. The recombinant protein of 21 kDa was purified and its capacity to mediate
attachment to various extracellular matrix (ECM) components was evaluated. We have found that this novel leptospiral protein is a surface exposed adhesin that binds
strongly to laminin, fibronectin (plasma) and collagen IV.
The gene coding for Lsa21 (leptospiral surface adhesin of
21 kDa) is expressed in low passage virulent Fiocruz L1130, LPF and LO4 strains of L. interrogans, and is regulated
by osmolarity and temperature. Anti-Lsa21 serum labeled
liver and kidney tissues of human fatal cases of leptospirosis. Our data suggest a role of Lsa21 in pathogenesis and
virulence.

Results
Cloning, expression and purification of recombinant
protein
The choice of predicted surface-CDS was mostly based on
cellular localization since surface proteins are potential
targets for mediating adhesion to host. Thus, the
LIC10368 CDS was predicted to be an outer membrane
protein (93.1%) according to PSORT program [16]. The
LipoP server predicted LIC10368 CDS to be a lipoprotein
with a cleavage site for signal peptidase II at amino acids
18–19 [17]. It is a hypothetical protein with no known
domain by BLAST [18,19] and PFAM analysis [20]. Identical predicted coding sequence of LIC10368 was identified in L. interrogans serovar Lai [21] but absent in L.
borgpetersenii [22] and L. biflexa [23] genome sequences.
The gene was amplified, without the signal peptide
sequence, and the DNA insert cloned and expressed as a
full-length protein in E. coli. Recombinant protein was
expressed with 6XHis tag at the N-terminal, purified by
metal chelation chromatography, and an aliquot of each
step of the process was analyzed through SDS-PAGE (Fig.
1A). The expected protein band of 21 kDa is shown in
NaCl-E. coli BL21 (SI)-induced culture, in insoluble form,
as inclusion bodies (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Although the Lsa21
protein presented low expression level, it was consistently
recovered from the column as single major band (Fig. 1A,
lane 6). Structural integrity of the purified protein was
assessed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. As
depicted in Fig. 1B, the recombinant protein may encompass a mixture of both α-helices and β-sheets in its secondary structure composition. The experimental data
obtained with Lsa21 is similar to the secondary structure

content of the native protein predicted by computational
analysis [24].
Distribution and expression of LIC10368 gene among
leptospire strains
The presence of LIC10368 gene in five pathogenic strains
and in one saprophytic strain was examined by PCR with
a pair of primers designed according to L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni genome sequences. A 540-bp DNA fragment covering almost the entire LIC10368 predicted CDS
was amplified by PCR in all five strains belonging to the
pathogenic species L. interrogans serovars: Canicola,
Copenhageni, Hardjo, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Pomona.
No amplification product was detected in the non-pathogenic L. biflexa serovar Patoc strain Patoc 1 (Fig. 2A). Fragments excised from the gel were purified, cloned into the
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and inserts were
sequenced. Multiple sequence alignment of the deduced
amino acid sequences of the five serovars harboring the
LIC10368 gene revealed high conserved identity among
the tested strains (not shown).

The ability of both high- (>200) and low- (< 3) passage in
vitro cultured leptospires to express LIC10368 was
assessed by PCR amplification of reversely transcribed
total RNA. Significant levels of gene product could be

detected in all three low-passage strains tested (Fig. 2B),
whereas among the high-passage strains detectable
amounts of LIC10368 transcripts were only observed for
the Hond Utrechet IV strain (serovar Canicola). Integrity
of total RNA used in RT-PCR experiments was assured by
the presence of a 1,042-bp 16S ribosomal cDNA fragment
in all samples (Fig. 2B).
Regulation of LIC10368 by environmental cues
It is well known that prolonged culture promotes leptospiral virulence attenuation [25], and it has been suggested that expression of virulence factors may be
downregulated upon sequential in vitro culture passages
[26]. To evaluate the effect of culture-attenuation by in
vitro passages on LIC10368 expression, the virulent lowpassage strains L. interrogans serovar Pomona strain LPF,
L. interrogans serovar Canicola strain LO4, and the reference high-passage strains L. interrogans serovar Pomona
strain Pomona, L. interrogans serovar Canicola strain
Hond Utrechet IV were grown to late-log phase and collected for RNA isolation. RT-PCR analyses of LIC10368
transcripts were performed, and a significant reduction of
gene expression was already observed after 4 (strain LPF)
or 3 (strain LO4) passages, thus indicating that LIC10368
expression is rapidly reduced with sequential in vitro culture passages. Amplified products were not detected in

control reactions lacking reverse transcriptase, ruling out
DNA contamination.
As our results pointed to a correlation between virulence
and LIC10368 expression, we decided to examine
whether environmental factors, such as osmolarity and
temperature could influence LIC10368 regulation at the
transcriptional level. All RT-PCR assays were performed
with the virulent, low-passage L. interrogans serovar
Pomona strain LPF. Induction of LIC10368 expression by
osmolarity was assessed by growing cultures at 29°C in
EMJH supplemented with 1% rabbit serum and resuspending them in fresh EMJH medium or in EMJH containing 120 mM NaCl. The addition of 120 mM NaCl to
the medium mimics physiological conditions (~300 mosmol per liter) encountered by leptospires upon entry into
the host [26]. Cultures were incubated for 24 h and examined for gene expression. LIC10368 expression was also
evaluated in a culture grown under our standard laboratory conditions. As a positive control, we included RTPCR data for the lipL53 gene (LIC12099) (Fig. 3B). This
gene codes for a predicted lipoprotein reactive with sera
from patients with leptospirosis [15] and was shown to be
strongly up-regulated by sodium chloride in a recently
published paper [27]. As shown in Fig. 3B, LIC10368
expression appears to be regulated by the osmolarity of
the growth medium, because transcripts were detected
only upon incubation with additional NaCl, or with a rich
EMJH medium containing more serum and salts. Similar
up regulation was observed with lipL53 expression, as previously detected by microarrays analysis [27].
Temperature is another important environmental signal
that may affect protein expression in bacteria. The transition of temperatures from ambient to mammalian body
(37° and later 39°C or higher during the febrile stage) has
been correlated with changes in the expression of virulence determinants in many pathogens [28]. Moreover, it
has been demonstrated that L. interrogans also regulates
protein synthesis in response to in vitro temperature
changes [29,30]. Therefore, we compared LIC10368 gene
expression patterns of cultures grown at 20°C, 29°C and
37°C, reflecting ambient temperatures in the environment, growth under laboratory conditions, and mammalian host body core temperature. Transcriptional analyses
were also performed with cultures subjected to temperature upshifts from 29°C to 37°C and from 37°C to 39°C
during an overnight period to simulate conditions experienced by leptospires in the early stages of infection and
during febrile stage. LIC10368 transcript levels gradually
increased when cultures grown at 20°C, 29°C and 37°C
were compared (Fig. 3C). An overnight upshift from 29°C
to 37°C had no effect on LIC10368 expression, while an
upshift from 37° to 39°C seems to have down-regulated
gene expression (Fig. 3C). Our results indicate that tem-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/70

perature is another critical parameter involved in the control of LIC10368 gene expression. Densitometric readings
provided information regarding accumulation of
LIC10368 transcripts (Fig. 3A, B, C).
Cellular localization of Lsa21 protein
Indirect immunofluorescence was used to examine
whether Lsa21 protein is surface-exposed. A similar protocol has been previously employed to evaluate the capability of Leptospira to bind factor H [12]. The low-passage L.
interrogans serovar Pomona strain LPF reacted with antiserum directed against recombinant Lsa21 protein, but no
staining was observed with the L. biflexa serovar Patoc
strain Patoc 1 (Fig. 4). Pre-immune serum failed to elicit a
positive signal in both strains (data not shown).
Adhesion of Lsa21 protein to ECM components
As Lsa21 protein is suggested to be surface-exposed and
might play a role in virulence, we queried whether it could
mediate host colonization by adhering to extracellular
matrix proteins. Therefore, we examined its interaction
with laminin, collagen type I, collagen type IV, cellular
fibronectin, and plasma fibronectin. BSA and fetuin were
included as negative controls and binding assays were performed by an ELISA-based assay [9]. As shown in Fig. 5,
Lsa21 protein bound to all immobilized ECM macromolecules tested, but no interaction was detected with BSA or
fetuin. As a negative control, we have included another
recombinant protein, rLIC10191, known as Loa22 [31],
and recently described as a virulence factor in Leptospira
species [32]. A stronger interaction was observed with
laminin, collagen IV and plasma fibronectin. This interaction was also assessed on a quantitative basis as illustrated
in Fig. 6A. A dose-dependent binding was observed when
increasing concentrations of the recombinant protein (0
to 2,000 nM) were allowed to adhere to a fixed laminin,
collagen IV or fibronectin concentration (1 µg).
Protein binding is affected by laminin oxidation
To investigate the role of laminin carbohydrate moieties
in the interaction with Lsa21 protein, laminin was oxidized by increasing concentrations of sodium metaperiodate (5 to 100 mM) for 15 min at 4°C. The mild treatment
ensures cleavage of vicinal carbohydrate hydroxyl groups,
but the polypeptide chain structure remains intact [33].
Oxidation effect was dose-dependent and a significant
reduction (~65%) in Lsa21 protein attachment to metaperiodate-treated laminin was observed at a 100 mM concentration of periodate (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that
laminin sugar residues are critical for the interaction of
Lsa21 protein with this major ECM glycoprotein.

obtained from a culture grown under our standard laboratory conditions (10% rabbit serum supplemented with amino acids
and salts). LIC10368 transcripts obtained from cultures with 1% serum (1%), 1% serum + 120 mM NaCl (1% + NaCl) and 10%
serum + amino acids and salts referred as enriched medium, EM (10% EM). 16S ribosomal cDNA fragments (1,042-bp) were

of temperature on LIC10368 transcript levels was assessed by culturing leptospires at 20ºC, 29ºC and 37ºC. Additional cultures grown at 29ºC and at 37ºC were shifted overnight to 37ºC and to 39ºC, respectively, in order to simulate conditions
encountered by bacteria upon entry into the host and in a febrile stage. Optical densities of LIC10368 and LIC12099 transcripts were normalized for each sample with corresponding 16S ribosomal densitometry data to obtain the relative expression levels.

Magnification × 1,260.

Sequence comparison between Lsa21 and leptospiral
adhesions
To investigate whether Lsa21 protein shared a sequence
similarity or a common domain with other previously
identified leptospiral ECM- binding proteins [9,10,13] we
proceeded with a sequence analysis using Clustal X program and a tree-display NJ plot [34,35]. The calculated
tree derived from sequence alignment is depicted in Fig. 7
and clearly shows that Lsa21 sequence is unrelated to
both Len protein family and LigA/LigB proteins. Contrasting with the Len and Lig proteins that divide a common
branch inside their family, Lsa21 appears alone on its
branch.
Lsa21 is expressed during human leptospiral infection
IHC (immunohistochemistry) analysis showed essentially similar results in all 5 patients diagnosed with Weil's
syndrome. It is necessary to point out that, due to the relatively short interval between autopsy and the patients'
death, tissues were better preserved, and classical findings
such as liver-plate disarray, although present, were not
prominent. Leptospiral Lsa21 antigen was frequently
detected as red deposits in the cytoplasm of isolated macrophages along the sinusoidal lining (Kupffer cells and
circulating macrophages) (Fig. 7A). Similar deposits were
rarely observed in macrophages of the portal inflamma-

tory infiltrate. Lsa21 antigen was also observed focally on
the sinusoidal side of the membrane of hepatocytes and as
small granules in the underneath cytoplasm (Fig. 7A).
Lsa21 protein was infrequently seen over endothelial cells
of portal vessels and supra-hepatic branches. In the kidney
Lsa21 antigen was present in the luminal side of epithelial
cells of the distal nephron, particularly distal tubules and
collecting ducts (Fig. 7B, 7C). As observed in liver cells,
antigen granules were also identified in the cytoplasm
below the cellular membrane. No definite Lsa21 expression was detected in epithelial cells of the proximal
tubules. Lsa21 deposit in the cytoplasm of macrophages
of the focal interstitial inflammatory infiltrate was rarely
observed (see Fig. 8).

Discussion
The characterization of leptospiral outer membrane proteins represents an important step toward the understanding of leptospirosis pathogenicity. To date, there has been
little functional analysis of Leptospira membrane proteins,
in spite of their unquestionable relevance to host-pathogen interactions. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome
sequences of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni revealed
more than 200 predicted outer membrane proteins that
merit further studies [7,8]. In this report, we have characterized one of those hypothetical proteins, a surface lept-

physiologic osmolarity (unpublished data). It is not surprising because 6% of the L. interrogans genes are susceptible to osmoregulation [27]. Osmotic control of gene
expression has been reported as an environmental cue
associated with virulence in a variety of pathogens [28]. In
V. cholerae, optimum expression of cholera toxin and Tcp
pilli occurs within an osmolarity range that probably represents that of mucosal secretions [37]. Transcription levels of invA, an S. Typhimurium invasion gene, have also
been reported to be considerably higher on media with
high osmolarity [38]. Moreover, genes controlling the P.
aeruginosa capsule, an important Pseudomonas virulence
factor, are also subjected to osmoregulation [39].

densities were taken at 492 nm. Data represent the mean ±
standard error of three independent experiments. For statistical analysis, the attachment of Lsa21 to ECM macromolecules was compared to its binding to BSA by the Student's

ospiral adhesin of 21 kDa, named Lsa21 that may play a
role in pathogenesis.
The LIC10368 expression is mostly detected in low-passage virulent strains (Figs. 2B, 3A). Culture attenuation
has also been reported for the LigA and B proteins, leptospiral antigens recognized during the acute host infection [26,36]. Although a larger sample set will be required
for definite conclusion, our findings suggest a correlation
between Lsa21 protein and virulence.
The LIC10368 gene is up regulated by osmolarity, another
distinguishing feature shared with ligA and B genes [26].
The addition of 120mM NaCl to the culture medium
reproduces the host's serum osmolarity (~300 mosM),
thus providing a more physiological environment for
leptospiral growth. In fact, EMJH-salt supplementation
enhanced Lsa21 expression (Fig. 3B). It is worth mentioning that several predicted outer membrane proteins currently under study in our laboratory are responsive to

Temperature induction of LIC10368 expression was also
observed (Fig. 3C). Maximal mRNA levels were detected
at 37°C, the body core temperature of most mammalian
species. Intriguingly, LIC10368 is not represented among
the leptospiral genes found to be up-regulated in response
to temperature or physiologic osmolarity, as assessed by
whole-genome microarrays [27,29]. This could be
explained by the fact that LIC10368 expression rapidly
decreases after three or four passages in culture medium
(Fig. 3A). In addition, optimum expression might occur
when both physiological parameters (mammalian body
core temperature and host's serum osmolarity) are combined.
Lsa21 protein exhibits extracellular matrix-binding properties. It is thus possible that it may play a role in the
attachment to host tissues. Several leptospiral adhesins
have been described, including a 36-kDa fibronectinbinding protein [11], a 24-kDa laminin-binding protein
named Lsa24 [9]/LfhA [12], LigA and LigB proteins [10].
Recently, it has been demonstrated that L. interrogans contain five additional paralogs of Lsa24 [9]/LfhA [12], designated as Len-like proteins [13]. The Len proteins were all
found to bind laminin and in addition LenB, LenC, LenD,
LenE and LenF have shown affinity to bind host fibronectin [13].
Lsa21 protein exhibits a broader spectrum binding profile
because it interacts with laminin, collagen IV and
fibronectin. Similarly, other adhesins, namely the Lig proteins [10], have been reported to bind to different ECM
macromolecules. In fact, attachment of Leptospira to several ECM macromolecules, including laminin, collagen I,
collagen IV, cellular fibronectin, and plasma fibronectin
was previously shown [9]. Interestingly, Lsa21 shares neither sequence similarity nor a common domain with the
Len-like and the Lig proteins. Emp, a cell surface protein
of Staphylococcus aureus, strongly interacts with fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, and vitronectin [40]. The outer
membrane protein YadA of Yersinia enterocolitica has been
shown to bind to laminin, fibronectin, and several types

100 mM) for 15 min at 4°C in the dark. Each point represents the mean absorbance value at 492 nm ± the standard deviation
of three independent experiments. Reduction in attachment compared to the level of attachment to untreated laminin was statistically significant: in each case (*), the P value, as measured by the Student two-tailed t -test, was ≤ 0.004.

of collagens [41-43]. Enterococcus faecalis adhesin Ace
mediates attachment to laminin, and to collagens I and IV
[44]. Finally, the Haemophilus influenzae Hap autotransporter protein exhibits the same binding profile of Lsa21
protein: it interacts with laminin, fibronectin and collagen
IV [45]. Chemical disruption of laminin carbohydrate
moieties by sodium metaperiodate caused significant
reduction in the binding activity of Lsa21 protein, thus
indicating the sugar moiety involvement in interactions
between this recombinant protein and ECM macromolecules. Possibly Lsa21 protein interacts with a particular
structural epitope shared by the ECM components mentioned above. A good candidate would be complex sugars
of glycosylated proteins. During infection, injury of wall
vessels exposes a repertoire of adhesive glycoproteins that
constitute major targets for initial adherence of pathogens
[46]. The extracellular matrix-binding properties of Lsa21
together with the data of indirect immunofluorescence
suggest that this protein is surface-exposed.
The presence of Lsa21 antigen as demonstrated by IHC in
cells, chiefly macrophages, of the inflammatory infiltrate
both in human liver and kidney is expected because lept-

ospirosis is an acute septicemic disease involving several
organs and blood vessels. Liver-plate disarray is a pathological finding described in human and experimental leptospirosis and in the human liver, its prominence is closely
related to the interval between patient's death and the
autopsy, thus indicating that post-mortem changes might
accentuate the lesion. In any circumstance, liver-plate disarray supports speculation that cell membrane lesion
might play an important role in leptospirosis pathogenesis [47]. Although cross-reactivity between anti-Lsa21
serum and other leptospiral proteins is not excluded,
immunohistochemical detection of leptospiral antigens
on the sinusoidal side of human hepatocytes is an infrequent finding in human leptospirosis when standard
whole bacterial polyclonal sera were used [47]. The fact
that Lsa21 anti-serum stained hepatocyte membranes
more often might strengthen the possible role of cell
membrane lesion in the pathogenesis of the disease.
Tubulo interstitial nephritis is the main manifestation of
acute renal failure in leptospirosis and the renal injury is
usually associated with polyuria. Hypokalemia appear frequently with an elevated urinary fractional excretion of

potassium, possibly due to proximal tubular lesions that
is expressed both in human and experimental leptospirosis [47-50]. The IHC detection of the leptospiral antigenic
protein Lsa21 on the epithelial membrane of the distal
nephron, particularly distal tubules and collecting ducts,
might be, up to a certain point, unexpected when a functional correlation is attempted. However, it is known that
in a normal state, urine is concentrated because of the
combined functions of Henle's loop and the collecting

duct. Therefore, we might speculate that the Lsa21 deposits detected by IHC chiefly in collecting ducts might be
interfering with the renal water absorption in leptospirosis, in spite of the absence of definite morphological alterations. Altogether these results strongly suggest a role of
this protein in the pathogenesis of the disease because no
reactivity was seen in non-leptospirosis human fatal cases.

Conclusion
We describe a novel leptospiral surface adhesin of 21 kDa,
Lsa21, shown for the first time in human fatal cases of the
disease, a finding that should contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of leptospiral
pathogenesis.

Methods
Leptospira strains and culture conditions
The non-pathogenic L. biflexa serovar Patoc strain Patoc 1,
the high-passage L. interrogans serovar Canicola reference
strains Hond Utrechet IV, L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain M-20, L. interrogans serovar Hardjo strain
Hardjoprajtino, L. interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae strain RGA, L. interrogans serovar Pomona, the virulent strains of L. interrogans serovar Pomona strain LPF,
L. interrogans serovar Canicola strain LO4 and L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 were cultured at 29°C under aerobic conditions in liquid EMJH
medium (Difco®- USA) with 10% rabbit serum, enriched
with L-asparagine (wt/vol: 0.015%), sodium pyruvate
(wt/vol: 0.001%), calcium chloride (wt/vol: 0,001%),
magnesium chloride (wt/vol: 0.001%), peptone (wt/vol:
0.03%) and meat extract (wt/vol: 0.02%). Virulence of the
L. interrogans serovar Pomona strain LPF, L. interrogans
serovar Canicola LO4 and L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 is maintained by iterative pas-

sages in Golden Syrian hamsters. Animals were injected
with 10 to 105 leptospires inocula from low and high passage cultures. Hamsters were monitored during 21 days.
No significant difference in mortality taxes was observed
when animals were inoculated with "no-passage" or "3–
4" passages of Leptospira cultures and no death was
observed after animal inoculation with high passage cultures. Regulation of LIC10368 expression by environmental factors such as temperature and osmolarity was
evaluated in the low-passage L. interrogans serovar
Pomona strain LPF. The effect of temperature on
LIC10368 transcript levels was assessed by culturing leptospires at 20°C, 29°C and 37°C. Additional cultures
grown at 29°C and at 37°C were shifted overnight to
37°C and to 39°C, respectively, to simulate conditions
encountered by bacteria upon entry into the host and in a
febrile stage. Induction of LIC10368 expression by osmolarity was examined by centrifugation of cultures grown at
29°C in EMJH supplemented with 1% rabbit serum followed by resuspension in fresh EMJH medium or in EMJH
containing 120 mM NaCl. Cultures were incubated for 24
h before being harvested for RNA isolation.
'In silico' identification and characterization of the
protein
Predicted coding sequence (CDS) LIC10368 was selected
from the L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni genome

sequences based on its cellular localization prediction by
PSORT program [16]. Sequence motifs, including signal
peptides, lipoprotein cleavage sites and transmembrane
domains were searched using specific softwares [1720,51,52]. Sequence analysis was performed with Clustal
X [35] and a tree displayed program by the NeighbourJoining method [34].
Cloning, expression and purification of recombinant
protein
Predicted CDS LIC10368 was amplified by the PCR from
total L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1130 genomic DNA using the primer pairs 5'GATGAAAAAAAAGAAAATGAATTGAG and 5'AACGCGATTCATAGAGAGCG. PCR product was cloned into pENTR
TOPO vector (Invitrogen) followed by transfer/recombination of DNA insert into the E. coli expression vector
pDEST17 using the LR Clonase (Invitrogen). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing with appropriate
vector-specific primers. Protein expression was achieved
in E. coli BL21 (SI) strain by the action of T7 DNA
polymerase under control of the osmotically induced promoter proU [53]. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, the bacterial pellets resuspended in 30 ml lysis buffer
(500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100,
pH 8.0) and lysed by French Pressure (Aminco). The
insoluble fraction was washed 3 times with 30 ml of
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM β mercaptoethanol, 1 M urea and 1% Triton X-100) before solubilization with 50 ml of buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl,
500 mM NaCl, 5 mM β mercaptoethanol, and 6 M guanidine-Cl. Protein refolding was achieved by 500× dilution
with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 500 mM NaCl. The
refolded protein was then purified through metal chelating chromatography in a Sepharose fast flow column (GE
Healthcare), extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, 0.1% (wt/vol) glycine solution
for 24 – 48 h and fractions were analyzed in 15% SDSPAGE.
Circular Dichroism spectroscopy
CD spectroscopy measurements were performed at 20°C
in a Jasco J-810 Spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic,
Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Peltier unit for temperature control. Far-UV CD spectra were measured using a 1
mm path length cell at 0.5 nm intervals. The spectrum is
presented as an average of five scans recorded from 190 to
260 nm.
DNA isolation and PCR analysis
Leptospira cultures were harvested by centrifugation at
11,500 g for 30 min and gently washed in sterile PBS
twice. Genomic DNA was isolated from the pellets with a
guanidine-detergent lysing solution (DNAzol® Reagent,
Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instructions. A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/70

540-bp LIC10368 DNA fragment was amplified using oligonucleotides LIC10368-F: 5'GATGAAAAAAAAGAAAATGAATTGAG and R: 5' CTTCGCAACTTGTGGATAAGG and
a 1450-bp LIC12099 DNA fragment was amplified using
oligonucleotides LP14-F: 5' CACCACCAATGTGTTTGGTATAGCG and LP14-R: 5' CAGCGTTTTGTGATAAAATTAAC designed according to L. interrogans serovar
Copenhageni genome sequences (GenBank accession
AE016823). PCR was performed in a reaction volume of
25 µl containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 1 × PCR buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl), 2 mM MgCl2, 20
pmol of each specific primer, 200 µM of each dNTP, and
2.5 U Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). Cycling conditions were: 94°C, 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C,
50 sec, 60°C (LIC10368)/55°C (LIC12099), 50 sec,
72°C, 1 min 30 sec, and a final extension cycle of 7 min
at 72°C. Amplicons were loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel for
electrophoresis and visualization with ethidium bromide.
Gel-purified bands (Concert Rapid Gel Extraction System
– Gibco BRL, Life Technologies) were cloned into the
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, Wis.) and the
products were sequenced with the primers M13F (5'GTTTTCCCAGTCACGA)
and
M13R
(5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC) on an ABI Prism 3730 × l
sequencer (SeqWright, Houston, Tex.). Multiple sequence
alignment was performed with Clustal W [54].
RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis
Leptospira cultures were harvested by centrifugation at
11,500 g for 30 min. For reverse transcription (RT)-PCR,
total RNA was isolated from leptospires cultured as previously mentioned by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate
phenol-chloroform method using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. One microgram of RNA from each sample was
treated with 1 U of DNAse I (Invitrogen) for 15 min at RT.
DNAse I was inactivated by the addition of 1 µl of 25 mM
EDTA solution followed by an incubation at 65°C for 10
min. DNAse-treated RNAs were reversely transcribed
using the SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System
for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). One tenth of RT products were
amplified in a 25 µl reaction mix using oligonucleotides
LIC10368-F/LIC10368-R or LP14-F/LP14-R as described
above. In experiments designed to evaluate regulation of
LIC10368 expression by environmental factors (osmolarity and temperature), 30 PCR cycles, instead of 35, were
employed. Samples quantity and integrity were verified by
amplification of a 1,042 bp 16S ribosomal cDNA fragment using oligomers 16S-F 5'CAAGTCAAGCGGAGTAGCAATACTCAGC and 16S-R 5'GATGGCAACATAAGGTGA
GGGTTGC. Cycling conditions were: 94°C, 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94°C, 50 sec, 62°C, 50 sec, 72°C, 1
min 30 sec, and a final extension cycle of 7 min at 72°C.
All samples were tested with and without reverse transcriptase to rule out genomic DNA contamination. PCR-

amplified products were loaded onto 1.5% agarose gels
for electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide
staining. Direct sequencing was performed to confirm the
identity of RT-PCR products. Densitometric readings were
taken using Image-Quant 2.1 software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Optical densities of
LIC10368 transcripts were normalized for each sample
with corresponding 16S ribosomal densitometry data to
obtain the relative expression levels.
Antiserum
Ten female BALB/c mice (4–6 weeks old) were immunized subcutaneously with 10 µg of Lsa21 protein. The
recombinant protein was adsorbed in 10% (vol/vol) of
Alhydrogel (2% Al(OH)3, Biosector, formerly Superfos
Biosector, Denmark), used as adjuvant. Two subsequent
booster injections were given at 2-week intervals with the
same protein preparation. Negative-control mice were
injected with PBS. One week after each immunization, the
mice were bled from the retro-orbital plexus and the
pooled sera were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for determination of antibody titers.
Immunofluorescence
The non-pathogenic L. biflexa serovar Patoc strain Patoc 1
and the virulent L. interrogans serovar Pomona strain LPF
were grown to late log phase and collected by centrifugation at 11,500 g for 30 min. The cell pellets were washed
three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH
7.4) and resuspended in a fixing solution containing 25%
glutaraldehyde, 10% formalin, and PBS (pH 7.4), essentially according to the methodology described in Verma et
al. [12]. Ten microliters of 1 × 109 leptospire per ml suspensions were applied to glass slides, which were then
placed on ice for 1 h. After two washes with PBS, blocking
was performed using 2% (wt/vol) BSA in PBS for 1 h.
Slides were washed twice with PBS and incubated with a
1:50 dilution of mouse anti-Lsa21 protein serum or with
preimmune serum for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in a
humidifying chamber. After three washes with PBS, slides
were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody
(Sigma) for 1 h at RT. Slides were washed three times with
PBS and mounting was performed in the antifading agent
Mowiol (Calbiochem) with 2.5% DABCO (Sigma). A coverslip was added, and the slide was left overnight at 4°C
before visualization by confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss,
Inc., Jena, Germany). Images were obtained with LSM 510
Meta software and the objective used was C-Apochromat
63×, scan zoom 2.0.
Binding of Lsa21 protein to ECM
All macromolecules, including the control proteins fetuin
and BSA, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/70

Louis, Mo.). Laminin-1 and collagen Type IV were from
the basement membrane of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm
mouse sarcoma, cellular fibronectin was from human
foreskin fibroblasts, plasma fibronectin was from human
plasma and collagen Type I was from a rat tail. Protein
attachment to individual macromolecules of the extracellular matrix was analyzed according to a previously published protocol Briefly, ELISA plate wells (Nunc-Immuno
Plate MaxiSorp Surface) were coated with 1 µg of laminin,
collagen Type I, collagen Type IV, cellular fibronectin,
plasma fibronectin, BSA (nonglycosylated attachmentnegative control protein) and fetuin (highly glycosylated
attachment-negative control protein) in 100 µl of PBS for
2 h at 37°C. The wells were washed three times with PBS0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and then blocked with 200 µl of
1% BSA for 1 h at 37°C followed by an overnight incubation at 4°C. One microgram of recombinant protein was
added per well in 100 µl of PBS and protein was allowed
to attach to the different substrates for 1 h 30 min at 37°C.
After washing six times with PBST, bound protein was
detected by adding 100 µl of a 1:5,000 dilution of mouse
anti-Lsa21 serum in PBS. Incubation proceeded for 1 h
and after three washes with PBST, 100 µl of a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat
anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) in PBS were added
per well for 1 h. All incubations took place at 37°C. The
wells were washed three times, and o-phenylenediamine
(0.04%) in citrate phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) plus 0.01%
H2O2 was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for
15 min and was then interrupted by the addition of 50 µl
of 8 M H2SO4. The absorbance at 492 nm was determined
in a microplate reader (Labsystems Uniscience, Multiskan
EX). For determination of dose-dependent attachment of
Lsa21 protein to laminin, collagen IV and plasma
fibronectin, protein concentrations varying from 0 to
2,000 nM in PBS were used.
For statistical analyses, the attachment of Lsa21 protein to
ECM macromolecules was compared to its binding to BSA
by the Student's two-tailed t -test. A P value less than 0.01
was considered statistically significant.
Metaperiodate treatment of laminin
Laminin oxidation was performed as described elsewhere
[9]. Briefly, microtitre wells were coated with 1 µg of laminin in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and incubated for 16 h at 4°C. Wells were washed three times with
50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and immobilized
laminin was treated with different sodium metaperiodate
concentrations (5 – 100 mM) in the same buffer for 15
min at 4°C in the dark. After three washes with 50 mM
sodium acetate buffer, wells were blocked with 200 µl of
1% BSA for 1 h at 37°C. Binding of Lsa21 protein (1 µg in
PBS per well) to periodate-treated laminin was assessed as
outlined above.

Human samples
Five patients, three males and two females, were autopsied with a diagnosis of Weil's syndrome. The age of the
four patients ranged from 20 to 29 years old and one
patient was 67 years old. Illness duration averaged seven
days with a sudden onset manifested by headache,
malaise, muscle pains and high fever. They developed
jaundice, palpable enlarged liver, acute renal failure and a
hemorrhagic syndrome. Epidemiological data showed
that patients had had contact with contaminated water,
mainly from floods and sewage. Main clinico-epidemiological data of the patients are in Table 1. Of note, two
cases (4 and 5) were part of our previous publication [47].
The illness was usually of short duration and this, associated with delayed clinical diagnosis, contributed to the
lack of some important confirmatory laboratorial tests. In
fatal human cases and in farm animals, diagnosis by
immunohistochemistry methods are specific and also
offer clues to the understanding of the pathogenesis of the
disease [47]. Special care was taken in selecting autopsies
with typical macro and microscopical findings described
in leptospirosis and performed after an average of up to
five to six hours of death. Liver and kidney samples, which
are more representative of the disease, were routinely
fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained
hematoxylin-eosin. Liver and kidney of five non- leptospirotic patients were obtained from autopsies performed within a close post-mortem interval as compared
to leptospirotic patients and used as controls. Leptospiral
antigens were detected by an immunohistochemical assay

using polyclonal rabbit anti-serum as previously
described [47] with positive results in all five leptospirotic
patients. Controls were negative.
Immunohistochemical assay
IHC studies were performed to assess the presence and
localization of leptospiral antigens as detected by the
mouse anti-Lsa21 serum (1:1,000 dilution). Kidney and
liver 3 µm sections were analyzed using a standard immunohistochemistry protocol [47] with EnVision labeled
polymer-AP mouse/rabbit K 4018 [55]. Antigen retrieval
was performed by steamer incubation of the sections in
citrate pH 6.0. Staining was completed with liquid permanent Red Chromogen K0640 [55]. All specimens were
then lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. This
method represents a better choice for diagnosis than the
usual silver stains to detect the microorganisms particularly when we are dealing with human autopsies.

All animal studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Instituto Butantan (Sao Paulo, Brazil). Autopsies were performed at the Department of Pathology,
University of Sao Paulo, School of Medicine (Sao Paulo,
Brazil) and are routinely used for diagnosis, teaching and
research purposes. All protocols used were verbally
approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of
Sao Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil).
