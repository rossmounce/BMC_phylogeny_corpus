Fine-scale genetic mapping of a hybrid sterility
factor between Drosophila simulans and
D. mauritiana: the varied and elusive functions
of “speciation genes”
Luciana O Araripe*, Horácio Montenegro, Bernardo Lemos, Daniel L Hartl

Abstract
Background: Hybrid male sterility (HMS) is a usual outcome of hybridization between closely related animal
species. It arises because interactions between alleles that are functional within one species may be disrupted in
hybrids. The identification of genes leading to hybrid sterility is of great interest for understanding the evolutionary
process of speciation. In the current work we used marked P-element insertions as dominant markers to efficiently
locate one genetic factor causing a severe reduction in fertility in hybrid males of Drosophila simulans and D.
mauritiana.
Results: Our mapping effort identified a region of 9 kb on chromosome 3, containing three complete and one
partial coding sequences. Within this region, two annotated genes are suggested as candidates for the HMS factor,
based on the comparative molecular characterization and public-source information. Gene Taf1 is partially
contained in the region, but yet shows high polymorphism with four fixed non-synonymous substitutions between
the two species. Its molecular functions involve sequence-specific DNA binding and transcription factor activity.
Gene agt is a small, intronless gene, whose molecular function is annotated as methylated-DNA-protein-cysteine
S-methyltransferase activity. High polymorphism and one fixed non-synonymous substitution suggest this is a fast
evolving gene. The gene trees of both genes perfectly separate D. simulans and D. mauritiana into monophyletic
groups. Analysis of gene expression using microarray revealed trends that were similar to those previously found in
comparisons between whole-genome hybrids and parental species.
Conclusions: The identification following confirmation of the HMS candidate gene will add another case study
leading to understanding the evolutionary process of hybrid incompatibility.

Background
Reproductive isolation is a hallmark of speciation in sexual organisms. When genetically isolated populations
have accumulated enough divergence, the hybrid progeny may be sterile due to the disruption of gametogenesis caused by functional incompatibility between factors
evolved independently within each population. This scenario characterizes post-zygotic isolation, which is frequently found in pairs of species sharing a recent
common ancestor. However, the timing at which

reproductive isolation evolves during the process of speciation is somewhat unclear.
An evolutionary scenario of speciation was theorized
many decades ago [1,2], but a modern understanding of
the speciation process on the molecular level–identifying
the so-called “speciation genes"–has just begun to
become realistic. A number of studies have succeeded in
identifying, at the molecular level, a few genes that may
be involved in speciation (in Drosophila: OdsH [3,4],
Nup98 [5], Nup160 [6], Hmr [7], Zhr [8], Ovd [9]; in
Mus: Prdm9 [10], in Xiphophorus: Xmrk-2 [11]). These
recent data together provide needed insight into the
evolution of reproductive isolation, and they largely confirm the traditional view of speciation as an evolutionary

process involving multiple genes [12,13]. Moreover, the
results imply that speciation is a continuous process
that progresses from the occurrence of hybridization
with viable hybrids, to hybrid sterility, and ultimately to
complete pre-zygotic reproductive isolation. Thus, the
existence of multiple reproductive barriers that have
accumulated over time is expected [12].
According to the Dobzhansky-Muller model [1,2],
genetic incompatibilities arise from negative epistatic
interactions between alleles that have appeared within
each population and encountered each other for the
first time in the hybrid. Thus, sequence differences
within at least two loci between two closely related species is a prerequisite for genetic incompatibility. Indeed,
the bigger the differences in gene sequence between
species, the higher the likelihood that an incompatible
sequence variant may have arisen. In this sense, every
gene showing rapid evolution might potentially be
responsible for generating the incompatibilities in the
hybrid of two closely related species.
The abundance of complex epistatic interactions
involved in HMS has been recently shown [14-16]. For
instance, previous work on the same D. simulans/D.
mauritiana system used here uncovered several complex
epistatic interactions between HMS factors, even though
the analysis was restricted to small introgressions in a
single background. This limited the results to interactions between factors located not too distant from each
other [16]. Nevertheless, the number of genes usually
involved and the nature of the epistatic interactions are
yet to be resolved.
Although hybrid inviability and/or sterility are the
usual outcomes of the disruption of allelic interactions,
the sparse data so far accumulated indicate that the
underlying nature of the disruptions may vary. The
question of whether certain classes of genes are more
prone to evolve incompatibilities is still open. Further
studies are therefore likely to bring new insights to the
topic of speciation. The number and variety of genomic
regions found to be involved in some degree of hybrid
incompatibility suggest that most of the divergence
between species may have accumulated after the rise of
reproductive barriers [13,17,18], and indeed several studies have observed an increase in the number of incompatibilities with divergence time [19,20].
Genes causing hybrid inviability may have important
housekeeping, developmental, or regulatory functions,
whereas genes leading to sterility in hybrids would likely
be involved in some aspect of reproduction. Among the
genes described so far, three are DNA or chromatinbinding proteins (OdsH, Lhr and Hmr), two are nuclear
pore proteins (Nup96, Nup160), one is a gene transposition (JYalpha), and one is likely to be a small regulatory
RNA that suppresses sex-ratio distortion (Nmy). As

pointed out by Presgraves [21], genomes are not impervious to invasion by selfish elements, and substitutions
generated by these leave the same signatures in the genome as beneficial substitutions. Therefore, an alternative
to the hypothesis of adaptive evolution is that most of
these genes may have evolved as a compensatory
response to the effects of deleterious mutations and selfish genes.
In the current work we focus on locating one hybridmale-sterility (HMS) factor between D. simulans and
D. mauritiana and investigating the nature of the disruption behind it. The HMS factor 1 was previously
identified by Tao et al. [16] as being in a region of
1.4 Mb on chromosome 3 (between molecular markers
Rga and Antp). This is only one of ten factors in chromosome 3 possibly causing hybrid incompatibilities in
this pair of species, whose hybrid males are always
sterile and females are fertile. Our results show that a
fertility shift from quasi-sterile male to a fertile male is
associated with a region of 9 kb, in which three complete genes and a portion of one gene are contained.
We analyzed the DNA sequence across this interval
and found no duplication, deletion, or rearrangement
between the two species. However, we observed a
handful of divergent sites in the coding sequences of
gene CG17603 (Taf1) and the intronless 576 bp gene
CG1303 (agt), as well as indels present in the 5’ UTR
of the later and in the intergenic region immediately
upstream of its coding sequence. Gene agt shows a
higher number of non-synonymous (NSS) than synonymous (SS) substitutions, one of the NSS being fixed
between D. simulans and D. mauritiana; the gene also
shows a reciprocally monophyletic gene tree. Likewise,
the gene tree of Taf1, built from the portion of coding
sequence included in the mapped interval, unambiguously separates the two species. The other two genes
in the region are much more evolutionary conserved
and have gene trees that do not differentiate the two
species.

Results
Mapping of the HMS factor to a 9 kb genomic region

Crosses of 2P-cis females with simB-males generated
536 recombinant males. This number was reached after
three runs of crosses, genotyping, and phenotyping. As
shown in Figure 1 recombinant males are recognized
from the eye color corresponding to P32-insert and
each bears either the original introgression or one of
smaller size that may have been generated by recombination in the mother. In principle, the sizes of the introgressions were not known, and all males were tested by
crossing to P45.6 (tester stock) and by scoring the fertility of their 2P sons (which carry both P-elements and
introgressions).

Figure 1 Mapping design and crosses performed. Cross scheme
used to generate recombinants between two P-elements. The
second chromosome, marked with nt is not shown. Females from 2P
line 32-33 (see True et al. 1996a for P-element nomenclature) were
crossed to simB males and recombinants were selected by eye color.
Recombinants carrying P33 had eye color very similar to nonrecombinants, which made the selection difficult. Thus, we decided
to select only recombinants carrying P32 for the fertility tests. The
D. mauritiana introgression did not cause sterility when
heterozygous; so the recombinant lines were crossed to 1P line 45.6,
whose introgression covers the region where the location of factor 1
was predicted. Ten males carrying P32 and P45.6 from each cross, i.e.
homozygotes for the introgression, were selected by eye color and
individually crossed to 3 females w; e. Fertility was assayed by
counting the offspring from each cross up to the 20th day.

The screening of the first set of recombinants reduced
the region of factor 1 from 1.26 Mb (between markers
Rga and Antp) to 372 kb (between markers CG15179
and Antp) and to chromosomal location 84A1. In the
second run, we first genotyped recombinants using the
ASO markers on the edge of factor 1’s region (CG15179
and Antp) in order to select for the informative lines
and exclude the lines with break points outside of the
372 kb interval. This new effort reduced the region to
170 kb (between markers CG15179 and Dfd). Finally,
the third run helped us locating factor 1 within an interval of 20 kb, with four informative recombinant lines
within it. The smallest interval between the fertile line
P32.433 and the quasi-sterile line P32.456 is 9 kb
(Figure 2 and Additional file 1).
The phenotype corresponding to each genotype class
is shown in Figure 2. We summarize the difference in
phenotype by showing the mean progeny number for
fertile recombinants (215.4 ± 24.51) and quasi-sterile
recombinants (9.0 ± 2.32). This represents a reduction
of 24-fold in fertility when the 9 kb region of D. mauritiana is present in homozygous condition.
The 9 kb region contains three annotated genes:
CG1307, CG2358 (Spase 18-21) and CG1303 (agt).
A fragment of gene CG17603 (Taf1, 3’ end representing
44% of the gene and 23% of the transcript) is also

Page 3 of 13

included in the region. Additional file 2 shows the genes
in the mapped interval. Gene Taf1 has molecular functions described as: sequence-specific DNA binding, general RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity,
histone serine kinase activity, protein kinase activity,
transcription factor activity, and zinc ion binding. Gene
CG1307 has molecular function described as aminoacyltRNA hydrolase activity. Spase 18-21 has molecular
function described as serine-type peptidase activity.
Finally, agt has molecular function described as methylated-DNA-protein-cysteine S-methyltransferase activity.
DNA sequencing of the 9 kb region for D. simulans
and D. mauritiana revealed no large duplication, deletion, or chromosomal rearrangement between the species. Across the region we see an even distribution of
SNPs and indels, with a clearly higher conservation
observed within coding regions (see Additional file 3).
Gene Taf1 has seven of 16 exons included in the region,
CG1307 and CG2358 have three exons each, and agt
(CG1303) has one single exon. Single-nucleotide differences between species are spread across the whole
region, but are especially seen in introns and intergenic
regions. Comparing the coding sequences of the genes,
both genes Taf1 and agt show a high density of singlenucleotide differences, whereas no indels were found
within exons. The highest divergence between simB and
mau12 is seen at the upstream region of gene agt.
Within a range of 500 bp from the 5’ UTR of gene agt,
we see four small indels, with simB missing a total of 54
bp in relation to mau12 (see Additional file 2).
Molecular characterization of the candidate interval

A count of the number of substitutions occurring in
exons of the four genes for D. simulans and D. mauritiana allowed an informative analysis of the candidate
interval. The results are summarized in Table 1. Genes
CG1307 and CG2358 can be immediately excluded as
candidates for the HMS phenotype, as they show no significant variation between species. Gene CG1307 shows
a total of nine polymorphic sites and one silent substitution fixed between species. We performed a McDonaldKreitman test, which takes into account a neutral null
hypothesis to test whether the ratio of synonymous to
non-synonymous substitutions that are fixed between
species is consistent with that segregating within species.
Fisher’s exact test was not significant (one-tailed P =
0.5). Gene CG2358 (Spase 18-21) is very conserved,
showing silent polymorphism, but no fixed differences
between species (Table 1). Thus, the McDonaldKreitman test could not be performed. Moreover, the
gene trees for CG1307 and CG2358 do not separate the
two species into monophyletic groups (Figure 3B,C).
Contrary to CG1307 and CG2358, the number of substitutions seen for gene Taf1 is noticeable. In the

Figure 2 Scheme showing the final reduction in the region bearing factor 1. Summary of results pairing genotype to phenotype. Genotype
on each marker site is represented by “M” for D. mauritiana and “S” for D. simulans. Phenotype was divided in two categories: quasi-sterile gave
9.0 offspring on average (± 2.32) and fertile gave 215.4 offspring on average (± 24.51). The clear-cut localization of factor 1 ranges in between
markers pos5279 and pos14460, a region of approximately 9 kb.

relatively small portion of Taf1’s coding sequence
included in the region (23% of 6.4 kb), we find four
non-synonymous substitutions that are fixed between
species, in addition to the occurrence of 22 polymorphic
sites (Table 1). The gene tree constructed for Taf1
unambiguously separates the species D. simulans and
D. mauritiana (Figure 3A). Even though the sequence
analysis and gene tree suggest that Taf1 may be under
rapid evolution, and hence be a good candidate for the
hybrid incompatibility, this is a gene that shows relatively high conservation across species of the D. melanogaster group (see Additional file 3). Moreover, from
among 23 loss-of-function mutations found in a genetic

screen of Taf1, three were identified as causing female
sterility without affecting the fertility of males [22]. The
other alleles cause lesions in a variety of structures,
including bristles, wings and male terminalia, and some
may be lethal.
The other candidate for factor 1, the gene agt, also
shows a high density of single-nucleotide substitutions
(Table 1), including 15 that are non-synonymous. Also,
the 5’ UTR and upstream intergenic region of agt show
the highest divergence between species, mostly in the
form of indels. Conservation in this particular region
(D. simulans 3R: 2517094-2518594) is low across species
of the melanogaster subgroup (see Additional file 3) and

gene present in the candidate interval. For genes (A) Taf1, (B) CG1307, (C) CG2358, and (D) agt we analyzed the coding sequence of a number

unambiguous grouping of populations in clades.

even between the sister species D. simulans and
D. mauritiana.
Gene agt is only 576 bp long (191 amino acids) and
has no introns. The protein O-6-alkylguanine-DNA
alkyltransferase is involved in the repair of O-6-alkylguanine and O-4-alkylthymine in DNA, and in most organisms it attenuates the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of
certain classes of alkylating agents. Between D. simulans
and D. mauritiana the coding region of gene agt shows
a higher number of non-synonymous (NSS) than synonymous (SS) substitutions: D. simulans has 13 segregating
sites with seven NSS, whereas D. mauritiana has 12 segregating sites with eight NSS. It is important to highlight
that one non-synonymous substitution is fixed between
species (Table 1). However, Fisher’s exact test was not
significant (one-tailed P = 0.078).
In addition to its degree of sequence divergence, agt’s
gene tree is perfectly consistent with the separation of

D. simulans and D. mauritiana into monophyletic
groups (Figure 3D), in contrast to the gene trees of
CG1307 and CG2358. In fact, it is expected that genes
involved in speciation will reflect more accurately the
phylogenetic history of closely related species [23,24],
and this indeed has been shown to be the case for
another gene causing hybrid sterility, OdsH [25].
The non-silent difference between species at position
361 of agt’s coding region is also a variable site when
other pairs of species are considered (Table 2). D. erecta
and D. yakuba have GAT (aspartic acid) in position 361,
D. melanogaster has CAT (histidine), D. sechelia has
TAT (tyrosine), D. mauritiana has AAT (asparagine),
and D. simulans has GAT (aspartic acid) like the outgroup D. yakuba. This specific change may suggest a precise location for the origin of the hybrid incompatibility.
Our results point to genes Taf1 and agt as good candidates for the hybrid male incompatibility factor 1

mapped to the 9 kb region herein reported. However,
the fact that gene Taf1 is not entirely represented in the
mapped interval and, in D. melanogaster, affects the fertility of females and not males when disrupted, makes
this gene a less attractive candidate for causing the
male-sterile phenotype than it might otherwise be.
Complex epistasis between HMS and the genomic
background

We have tested whether the HMS factor1 was similarly
expressed in three different genomic backgrounds. We
find that significant variation in fertility is observed when
other strains of D. simulans are used. In order to establish stocks for this experiment, males from recombinant
lines P32.75 and P32.110, as well as males from the tester
stock P45.6, were crossed to females from three different
strains of D. simulans: w501, w; e, and ywf. Male progeny
with colored eyes were backcrossed to virgin females
from the respective D. simulans strain for five more generations. Because no recombination happens in males of
most species of Drosophila, at this point we expected
that each original recombinant chromosome would be
intact, whereas the rest of the genome would have been
largely replaced by the background strain. Females from
each background were then crossed to males from the
corresponding P45.6 line and the 2P male progeny tested
for fertility. The fertility tests were done as described in
Material and Methods: each male 2P was crossed to
three females w; e and the progeny were counted. The
results are shown in Figure 4. The w; e background gives
a 30-fold difference in fertility between the fertile line
P32.75 (factor 1 absent) and the quasi-sterile line P32.110
(factor 1 present in homozygosis). The smallest effect of
factor 1 was seen in the w501 background (2-fold), even
though the difference in progeny size is still highly significant (P < 0.01).
Gene expression analysis

Patterns of gene expression may also give clues as to the
molecular nature of factor 1. For this, we began by
investigating the tissue-specificity of the four genes contained within the introgressed region using publicly
available data for D. melanogaster (FlyAtlas [26]). Gene

backgrounds of D. simulans. Progeny size resulting from the
presence of two copies of D. mauritiana introgression P32.75 (black
columns) and P32.110 (white columns) in different D. simulans
backgrounds. The HMS factor 1 is present in homozygous condition
in P32.110 and clearly causes a reduction in fertility for every
background tested. Vertical bars indicate the standard errors.

Taf1 is expressed at low and similar levels in all tissues;
expression level in testes is basal and reported to be half
that for ovaries. Gene CG1307 has a developmentally
homogeneous expression pattern that appears to be
restricted to tubule and hindgut tissues. Taken together
with its lack of evolutionary variability, this pattern
appears sufficient to rule it out as the cause of the HMS
herein observed. Gene CG2358 is ubiquitously expressed
although levels vary greatly across tissues. Its highest
expression level is in salivary glands. Moreover, its high
sequence conservation across species allows us to rule it
out as a cause for HMS. Finally, gene agt is expressed at
low levels and just above the detection limit in various
tissues. Importantly, in the male accessory gland, agt is
expressed in levels at least two times higher than most
of the other tissues. Male accessory glands are required
for sperm storage and male fertility.
Microarray analysis helped identifying the molecular
correlates of the hybrid male sterility and showed a substantial number of gene expression differences associated with the non-fertile phenotype relative to the
fertile phenotype (Figure 5). First, we found 932 genes
whose expression varies between the fertile and nonfertile lines (P < 0.01, FDR < 0.10, see Additional file 4).
Furthermore, we found that 157 genes (FDR < 0.05)
show concordant gene expression differences in all four
non-fertile lines relative to the fertile line (see Additional file 5), with 124 genes similarly down-regulated in
all four non-fertile lines and only 33 genes similarly upregulated in the same lines - see also Figure 5. Importantly, the genes affected are randomly scattered
throughout the genome with only 5 down-regulated targets contained within the introgressed segment.

Altogether, the genes differentially expressed between
lines underscore the regulatory networks that are disrupted by factor 1 or other divergent elements in the
mapped region. Interestingly, while the genes detected
show a broad distribution of functional classes, we
detected a statistically significant enrichment for genes
whose functions are associated with spermatogenesis
(P = 0.002, Fisher’s exact test). Accordingly, we observed
19 downregulated genes and 11 upregulated genes in
non-fertile lines and belonging to the gene ontology
category of “spermatogenesis”.

Discussion
The history of divergence of D. simulans and D. mauritiana from a common ancestor dates from ~0.3 million
years ago [27] and likely happened through the common
mechanism of allopatric speciation [28]. The distribution
of the two species overlapped recently, at some point
around 24,000 years ago, as evidenced by an introgression of D. simulans mtDNA into D. mauritiana [29]. The
rise of reproductive isolation in this system has been the
object of several studies. Hybrid male sterility (HMS) loci
have been found mainly on the X chromosome (reviewed

Page 7 of 13

in Wu & Hollocher [30]), but Tao et al. [16] have
described the occurrence on the 3rd chromosome of 10
HMS factors by genetic mapping, among a total of 19
quantitative trait loci (QTL) in this chromosome that
may be involved in hybrid incompatibilities.
The use of QTL mapping to identify the genomic
region responsible for the expression of a complex phenotype has been extensive in several organisms. Because
hybrid sterility as a complex trait may result from disruptions in varied genes and genetic interactions, the
use of a mapping approach that mixes two genomes in
equal proportions is very likely to give no fertile individuals. Nevertheless, the use of introgressions of one species in the genomic background of another species has
been effective in the search for the molecular basis of
HMS. Since introgressions vary in size and represent a
very small proportion of the hybrid genome, they may
or may not cover the factor responsible for the disruption and a range of fertility phenotypes results. For this
reason, introgressions have been classically used in the
mapping of HMS [16,30-32].
On the other hand, the mapping through introgressions may not detect small HMS sites when complex
epistasis is present. Another limitation is that genetic
rearrangements may show incompatibilities that do not
really exist, for instance, when an event of transposition
involving the introgression happens, we may lose an
essential gene in one of the species and this can generate sterility or inviability that is not associated with
hybrid incompatibilities [33]. In our case the use of
introgressions was facilitated by the fact that previous
work had already established the parental lines. In addition, QTL mapping had been previously done in the
same region [16].
HMS expression depends on genomic background

In previous work, two of the HMS factors located on
chromosome 3 were fine-mapped and characterized at
the molecular level [16,34,35]. These factors have a large
effect on HMS, but several other factors of small effect
may be acting additively [36] or epistatically [15,37] in
generating the hybrid incompatibility. These results support the view that that HMS is often a polygenic trait.
The polygenic nature of the hybrid sterility also
accounts for the incomplete penetrance and variable
phenotypic expression in each background. We tested
three different backgrounds besides the stock simB used
for the mapping. We find the same qualitative result, a
reduction in fertility due to the presence of two D.
mauritiana alleles of factor 1. However, the magnitude
of this difference varies according to the background. In
the background of line w; e, the presence of factor 1
when homozygous causes fertility to drop 30 fold,
whereas in the w501 background fertility drops only

twofold (Figure 4). This contrast indicates that there
may be a complex network of negative epistatic interactions causing HMS. Thus, the effect of hybridization
may depend on several factors that frequently vary
among different lines of each species.
Regulatory effects of HMS

Information on gene expression is provided by the FlyAtlas [26] and refers to expression in different tissues of
D. melanogaster. All genes contained in our interval are
available in the dataset. Gene CG2358 (Spase 18-21)
shows enrichment in salivary glands, male accessory
glands, and larval salivary gland. Expression of this gene
is up regulated in these tissues. Among the other three
genes, agt shows a twofold enrichment in male accessory glands.
Recent studies of gene expression in hybrids have
found that the misexpression of genes involved in spermatogenesis may cause sterility in hybrids [38,39]. Most
of these genes are underexpressed in the hybrids relative
to the parental species [20,40], and this finding might
reflect a disruption of gene interactions that are particular to each species. These results come from work
where whole-genome hybrids were compared to both
parental species, which is a situation different than our
study. Here we used lines that bear a hybrid region considerably smaller (3R: 1,468,434..7,938,322), in the background of D. simulans (more specifically line simB).
Most importantly, the segment that differs between the
fertile and non-fertile lines is only ~1.4 Mb and contains
only 174 known protein coding genes. Yet we find
results qualitatively similar: the average number of down
regulated genes in hybrids was more than double the
average number of up regulated genes and both values
were much greater than expected (Figure 5). Importantly, genes belonging to the Gene Ontology category
of spermatogenesis are preferentially affected, with 30
targets showing differential expression.
Artieri et al. [41] showed that underexpressed genes in
hybrids appear to evolve more rapidly than genes
expressed normally in hybrids. This fact contributes to
the idea that rapid evolution reduces gene similarity and
potentially causes genetic incompatibilities.
Molecular evolution of HMS

The fine mapping described here defined a region as
small as 9 kb that includes the candidate causing the
great reduction in fertility in hybrid males of D. simulans and D. mauritiana. None of the genes present in
this region are clearly involved in spermatogenesis,
although signals of rapid evolution are present and help
to suggest a candidate for factor 1. Gene agt is a small
gene (576 bp) with high polymorphism within species
and a number of nucleotide substitutions between

Page 8 of 13

species (Table 1). Among the fixed substitutions, four
are synonymous and one is non-synonymous. Moreover,
the region where agt is present shows very low
conservation.
Similarly to agt, the gene Ovd (GA19777), recently
described by Phadnis and Orr [9], lacked strong evidence of non-neutral evolution but proved to be the
best candidate for the hybrid incompatibilities between
the subspecies D. pseudobscura pseudobscura and
D. pseudobscura bogotana. The authors found that this
gene is involved in causing both segregation distortion
in the F1 and hybrid male sterility.
Identifying the normal function of a candidate gene
within the parental species is of great interest when
investigating the basis of hybrid incompatibilities. So far,
no particular function can be attributed to genes
involved in speciation. Some are enzymes, some are
transcription factors, and others are structural proteins
[42]. One possible explanation for the involvement of
these varied classes of genes in reproductive isolation is
that genetic substitutions accumulate over time, ultimately leading to enough divergence to cause genetic
incompatibilities [7,21]. Nevertheless, the most common
characteristics of genes involved in hybrid male sterility
are signals of rapid evolution and positive selection
within species [12,42].
One candidate for factor 1 in our study, gene agt, is
reported as being involved in the repair and attenuation
of the toxic and mutagenic effects of certain alkylating
agents. Kooistra et al. [43] showed that the expression
of agt suppresses transition mutations (G:C to A:T and
vice-versa) in vivo. At the molecular level, agt is
involved in methyltransferase activity. Apparently, this
function does not have any clear association with reproduction for its disruption to lead to male sterility.
Nevertheless, the gene may have as yet unidentified
functions, or its enzymatic function may be deployed in
some manner essential to hybrid male fertility.
In the mouse, the recently identified speciation gene
Prdm9 is known to encode a meiotic histone H3
methyltransferase [10,44]. In the parental species, Prdm9
activates genes essential for meiosis and thus is essential
for reproduction. The disruption of this function in
hybrids of Mus m. musculus and Mus m. domesticus
leads to male sterility, similarly to the phenotype of the
Prdm9-/- mutants. Similarly to Prdm9 and Ovd, the earlier identified HMS gene (OdsH) was recently reported
to also encode a protein with putative DNA binding
domain [45]. Thus, proteins that bind to chromatin and
have possible regulatory roles may represent the most
common class of factors whose disruption leads to
hybrid incompatibilities. The gene Taf1 also functions
as sequence-specific DNA binding protein and shows
transcription factor activity. The fact that Taf1’s

Araripe et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:385
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/385

function corresponds to what is described for most of
the genes involved in hybrid male sterility may, per se,
suggest this as a plausible candidate gene for factor 1.
Across the Drosophila phylogeny, agt has undergone
substitutions more often than other functional genes in
the candidate region we mapped. Strikingly, substitutions in position 361, cited in the previous section,
occurred in every clade since the split of D. melanogaster, and all lead to amino acid substitution. This information may indicate that agt is evolving rapidly and
systematically changing with every branching event.
Substitutions in position 361 are fixed within species
and may be the key difference leading to the drop in
fertility seen in hybrid males. Another observation is
that agt shows unambiguous sorting of the three species
of the simulans clade (Figure 3), as also observed for
OdsH, another gene involved in hybrid incompatibility
between D. simulans and D. mauritiana [25]. Ongoing
experiments focus on confirming the role of genes Taf1
or agt in causing the HMS via germ-line transformation
rescue.

Conclusions
Our results suggest two candidate genes possibly leading
to HMS between D. simulans and D. mauritiana. The
mapping of such a complex phenotype down to a 9 kb
region and to identifying candidate genes is an important achievement for the field and contributes to the
knowledge of what classes of genes may cause HMS
when disrupted in hybrids. Further experiments will
investigate the functional role of Taf1 and agt in causing
the decrease in fertility.
Methods
Drosophila stocks

D. simulans: (1) simB: w; nt; III (white; net; third chromosome homozygous and isogenic to that of line 13w 1
× 1JJ). The construction of 13w 1 × 1JJ and simB was
described earlier [34,46]; (2) sim w; e (white; ebony). All
the stocks were provided by J. Coyne and maintained in
the laboratory for several generations.
D. mauritiana: w (white); P[w+], lines with independent P-element insertions on the third chromosome
[47]. The P[w+] inserts are semi-dominant markers with
position effect, i.e., the wild form of white carried in the
P-element produces an eye color between yellow and
red, depending on the location of the P-insert.
The choice of lines to use for the mapping of factor 1
was based on the work of Tao et al. [16,34]. In that
study hybrid lines between D. simulans and D. mauritiana were constructed. After several generations of backcrossing to the simB line (described above) and selecting
for the colored-eye progeny, a piece of D. mauritiana’s
3rd chromosome of varying size was introgressed into

Page 9 of 13

the genome of D. simulans. A total of 231 introgression
lines were created from a set of 28 D. mauritiana lines
bearing one copy of P[w+] independently inserted in the
3rd chromosome. Details of the introgression scheme are
in Tao et al. [[34], Figure 4], as well as the names given
for the introgression lines.
Three lines composed of a simB background and one
P[w+]-tagged D. mauritiana introgression on the third
chromosome were used for the mapping. The creation
of these lines is described elsewhere [34,47].
Genetic mapping

Lines P32.8 (yellow eye) and P33.3 (red eye) were chosen for having P-element inserts flanking factor 1
[47,48]. Two generations were necessary to construct a
heterozygote line with both P-inserts in cis: P32.8
females and P33.3 males generated a proportion of offspring with both P-inserts in trans, which could be distinguished from the others by their dark-red eyes.
Females with inserts in trans were crossed to simB
males, and the darker-eye offspring selected again as
bearing P32 and P33 inserts in cis (Figure 1). The 2P
construct carries a D. mauritiana introgression that covers the region where factor 1 had previously been
located [31]. Other two factors identified as possible
HMS (#9 and #10 - [16]) were previously located in
regions covered by the 2P construct we generated. However, the existence of these factors is not a source of
influence on our results, as factor #9 is always present
in every P32 recombinant line used here and factor #10
is never included in the fine mapping (i.e. when we
focused on recombinant lines bearing small introgressions). Thus, only the presence or absence of factor 1
may be associated to fertility or sterility.
The cross of 2P females to simB males generates single-P recombinants, which can be recognized by an eye
color that is lighter than in the original P lines; these
carry D. mauritiana pieces of different sizes (Figure 1).
The ideal 2P design uses recombinant lines having
either of the P-inserts from the parental lines, thus
flanking factor 1 from both sides. However, in the present case, a reliable separation of P33 recombinants
from 2P non-recombinants based on eye color was not
possible. We thus decided to establish lines only from
P32 recombinants.
Each recombinant male was crossed to five females of
simB in order to establish recombinant lines bearing
heterozygous D. mauritiana introgressions. Because a
single copy of the introgression does not harm male fertility, these lines were maintained through males × simB
females in every generation. Moreover, since Drosophila
males do not have recombination, the transmission
through males assures the integrity of introgressions,
and hence the perpetuation of the recombinant line.

Araripe et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:385
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/385

Males from stable recombinant lines were then taken for
genotyping (assessment of introgression length) and fertility tests.
Fertility assay

Although the lack of recombination in Drosophila males
can be very convenient for designing genetic experiments, it allows spontaneous mutations to accumulate
through Muller’s ratchet. Some of these mutations may
cause sterility when in homozygosity. The frequency of
spontaneous sterility was estimated as ~1.5% [34,49]
which is capable of blurring the fertility tests. In order
to circumvent this concern and bring factor 1 to a
homozygote state, we generated trans-heterozygote
males from two independently raised P[w+] stocks, i.e.,
males from P32 recombinant lines were crossed to
females from P45.6 (named the tester stock), and the
male offspring with this combination of P-inserts (darkred eyes) were selected for fertility tests (Figure 1). In
this way, no spontaneous mutation occurring in the original P32.8 or P45.6 will be homozygous, whereas factor
1 may or may not be homozygous depending on the
size of the introgression in each case.
Ten trans-heterozygote males were selected from each
cross for the fertility tests. The typical fertility analysis
used in previous work is based on the number of motile
sperm present in seminal vesicles [50]. Here we follow
the assay by Tao et al. [31,34], which is based on counting viable offspring derived from trans-heterozygote
males. This is a more quantitative method that allows
us to separate by sex (in order to investigate the occurrence of sex-ratio distortion) and eye color. Each of 10
trans-heterozygote males was crossed to three virgin
females of D. simulans w; e for seven days. After this
period, females were discarded and males were collected
for single-fly genotyping.
Offspring were counted up to the 20th day and males
classified as fertile or quasi-sterile. We observed that
two copies of factor 1 cause either a severe drop in fertility or complete sterility. Recombinant lines were classified as quasi-sterile when their trans-heterozygote males
had on average zero to 30 offspring. This range was
empirically chosen, as outside this range the fertility
jumps to an average of 120 offspring or more. A negligible number of males had progeny numbers between
these two categories and were removed from the
analysis.
Single-fly genotyping

After the seven-day mating period with w; e females,
trans-heterozygote males were collected and placed one
in each well of 96-well plates. Grinding solution was
added in each well (40 μl of 10 mM Tris pH 8.2, 1 mM
EDTA, 25 mM NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml Proteinase K) and flies

Page 10 of 13

were homogenized. The plates were incubated in 65° for
30 min, 95° for 2 min and chilled on ice briefly before
being stored at -20°.
The genotyping made use of molecular markers from
various sources. First, allele-specific oligonucleotide
markers previously developed (ASO [51]) were used as
external markers in order to delimitate the region. We
then designed additional ASO markers as the genetic
dissection of the HMS region progressed. The ASO
probes are pairs of 15-mers that recognize the same
sequence, but carry one or more SNPs (single nucleotide
polymorphisms) between D. simulans and D. mauritiana. The steps for designing ASO probes are described
in detail by Tao et al. [34]. In their work, primers were
designed using the genome of D. melanogaster as template. However, in the present work we could take
advantage of the genome project completed for D. simulans, as well as some regions of D. mauritiana obtained
from 454 Life Sciences sequencing carried out at the
Genome Center at Washington University in St. Louis.
Other markers were based on PCR success/failure
using species-specific primers and PCR products with
species-specific sizes. In the first case, triads of primers
were designed in order to have one of them, either forward or reverse, annealing perfectly to both species, and
a pair showing species-specific annealing. Additional file
6 lists the molecular markers used, as well as the primers, probes, and experimental conditions for their use.
All oligonucleotides were designed using the online tool
of Primer 3 http://frodo.wi.mit.edu.
During the final mapping step, we sequenced 20 kb
spanning the region bearing factor 1 for simB, mau12,
and w; e. The 20 kb region was split into seven ~3 kbpieces in order to facilitate PCR reaction and downstream methods. We extracted DNA from ~10 flies of
each stock using DNeasy (QIAgen). PCR reaction was
performed using TaKaRa LA Taq (Takara Bio Inc.) and
the protocol: 94° for 1 minute; 30 cycles of 94° for
15 seconds, 55° for 30 seconds, 68° for 5 minutes and
extension in 72° for 10 minutes. PCR products were
cleaned with ExoSAP-it (USB). In total, 36 pairs of primers were used to sequence the seven pieces. This coverage provided a complete set of SNPs and indels and
served as a reliable and straightforward source for
genotyping.
Molecular characterization of the candidate interval

We sequenced the 20 kb extent of the candidate region
for the lines simB, w; e, and mau12. For a length of 1 kb
encompassing the coding and flanking regions of gene
agt (CG1303), an additional 15 strains of D. simulans
from different locations across Africa and the Americas,
and 17 strains of D. mauritiana collected in 2006
(kindly provided by Dr. Maria Margarita Ramos), were

Araripe et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:385
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/385

sequenced. Regions of 2.2 kb (Taf1), 3 kb (CG1307) and
2.4 kb (CG2358) were sequenced for a subset of 8
strains of D. simulans and 8 of D. mauritiana. Contig
assembly was performed with Sequencher 3.0 (Gene
Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and alignment was performed using ClustalW software [52].
Molecular genetic analyses, including the McDonaldKreitman test, were performed with DnaSP [53]. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction was performed for each
gene’s coding region separately, using maximum likelihood with phyML software [54], after running jModelTest [55] to determine the best fitting model to each
alignment. The phylogeny obtained for each gene was
used in the detection of positive selection with the software PAML [56].
Gene expression analysis

Genome-wide microarray analyses of gene expression of
fertile and non-fertile lines were performed. The lines
used in this essay were recombinant lines generated
from an early step of the mapping process, when introgressions were covering a large region of chromosome
3R. Five recombinant lines were chosen and crossed to
the tester stock P45.6 in order to bring factor 1 to a
homozygous condition. Lines #96 and #102 were completely sterile, but were genotyped as having introgression of same size as quasi-sterile lines #143 and #188.
For this reason, these lines were merged in the same
group, non-fertile, and compared to the only normally
fertile line #225 (Figure 6A). Line #225 bears a smaller
introgression generated by recombination in the mother.
The breakpoint excluding factor 1 from this line was
located in between markers Antp and CG31195, but not
precisely determined at this early step of the mapping.
Thus, the introgressions present in these lines are identical at their 3’ end but differ at the 5’ end. Except for
these differences in the amount of introgressed material
and the consequential presence or absence of factor 1
and other elements within the introgressed region, these
lines are genetically identical.
Microarrays were ~18,000-feature cDNA arrays
spotted with D. melanogaster cDNA PCR products.
Total RNA was extracted from whole flies using TRIzol
(Life Technologies) and microarray analyses were performed with standard protocols previously described
[57]. Using RNA from testis would focus the results on
the specific effects of factor 1 on spermatogenesis, but
on the other hand, would not give any information
about the effects of factor 1 on genes that are exclusively
expressed in other tissues. The microarray design implemented in this study is shown in Figure 6B.
The cDNA synthesis, the labelling with fluorescent
dyes (Cy3 and Cy5), and the hybridization reactions
were carried out using 3DNA protocols and reagents

lines. (A) Design for the microarray experiment comparing gene

D. simulans and D. mauritiana, in relation to D. melanogaster.

our design, four independently obtained lines with non-fertile

heterozygosity with the homologous segment from D. simulans,
whereas the segment is homozygous D. mauritiana/D. mauritiana in
the four non-fertile lines.

scanner (Axon Instruments) and GenePix Pro 6.0 software. Foreground Fluorescence of dye intensities was
normalized by the Loess method in the R Limma library.
Stringent quality-control criteria were used to ensure
reliability of foreground intensity reads for both Cy5
and Cy3 channels. These conservative criteria were the
following: (([F635Median - B635] > 4*[B635 SD] OR
[F532 Median - B532] > 4*[B532 SD]) AND ([% > B635

Median]) AND ([Sum of Medians (635/532)] > 100)
AND ([SNR 635] > 2 AND [SNR 532] > 2) AND ([Rgn

F532 and F635 denote the foreground fluorescence

by the GenePix software.
The significance of variation in gene expression due to
the introgressed segment causing HMS was assessed
with linear models in Limma and with the Bayesian
Analysis of Gene Expression Levels (BAGEL). FDRs
were estimated based on the variation observed when
randomized versions of the original dataset were
analyzed.
