variabile DSM 44702 isolated from the surface of
smear-ripened cheeses and insights into cheese
ripening and flavor generation

Abstract
Background: Corynebacterium variabile is part of the complex microflora on the surface of smear-ripened cheeses
and contributes to the development of flavor and textural properties during cheese ripening. Still little is known
about the metabolic processes and microbial interactions during the production of smear-ripened cheeses.
Therefore, the gene repertoire contributing to the lifestyle of the cheese isolate C. variabile DSM 44702 was
deduced from the complete genome sequence to get a better understanding of this industrial process.
Results: The chromosome of C. variabile DSM 44702 is composed of 3, 433, 007 bp and contains 3, 071 proteincoding regions. A comparative analysis of this gene repertoire with that of other corynebacteria detected 1, 534
predicted genes to be specific for the cheese isolate. These genes might contribute to distinct metabolic
capabilities of C. variabile, as several of them are associated with metabolic functions in cheese habitats by playing
roles in the utilization of alternative carbon and sulphur sources, in amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid
degradation. Relevant C. variabile genes confer the capability to catabolize gluconate, lactate, propionate, taurine,
and gamma-aminobutyric acid and to utilize external caseins. In addition, C. variabile is equipped with several
siderophore biosynthesis gene clusters for iron acquisition and an exceptional repertoire of AraC-regulated iron
uptake systems. Moreover, C. variabile can produce acetoin, butanediol, and methanethiol, which are important
flavor compounds in smear-ripened cheeses.
Conclusions: The genome sequence of C. variabile provides detailed insights into the distinct metabolic features
of this bacterium, implying a strong adaption to the iron-depleted cheese surface habitat. By combining in silico
data obtained from the genome annotation with previous experimental knowledge, occasional observations on
genes that are involved in the complex metabolic capacity of C. variabile were integrated into a global view on the
lifestyle of this species.

Background
Cheese is one of the oldest dairy products and generally
based on the addition of rennet and lactic acid bacteria
to milk of cows, sheep, goats, or buffalos. Nowadays,
cheese is also the most diverse group of dairy products
with hundreds of varieties that are capable of being differentiated mostly by their type of ripening [1]. Bacterial

smear-ripened cheeses, such as Appenzeller, Gubbeen,
Limburger, Livarot, Munster, and Tilsit, are characterized
by the development of a viscous, red-orange smear on
the surface of the cheese body during ripening. This
smear is a microbial mat composed of various species of
yeasts and bacteria. Their combined metabolic activities
are mainly responsible for the typical flavor and textural
properties of this type of cheese [2,3]. The microbiology
of the red-orange smear is poorly understood so far.
Generally, acid-tolerant yeasts grow during the first days
of ripening of smear-ripened cheeses and metabolize the
lactic acid produced by the lactic starter cultures to CO2

and H 2 O, thereby increasing the pH and producing
growth factors, such as pantothenic acid, that permit the
growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
[4,5]. Yeast species can also deaminate amino acids to
ketoacids and NH 3 , which leads to deacidification of
the cheese curd in such a way that bacteria are able to
grow [6,7]. The bacterial microflora dominating the later
stages of ripening of smear-ripened cheeses is composed
of salt-tolerant micrococci, staphylococci, and corynebacteria [2,8]. In the past, it was supposed that the coryneform species Brevibacterium linens represents the major
organism on the surface of smear-ripened cheeses [9],
but recent investigations emphasized the importance of
other coryneform bacteria to the ripening process and
identified Arthrobacter nicotianae, Arthrobacter arilaitensis, Brevibacterium ammoniagenes, Microbacterium
gubbeenense, Rhodococcus fascians, and members of the
genus Corynebacterium (Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Corynebacterium casei, and Corynebacterium variabile) dominating the microflora of Gubbeen, Tilsit, and
other smear-ripened cheeses [10-14].
The genus Corynebacterium includes (besides numerous
human and animal pathogens) a diverse collection of nonpathogenic species that have been detected in a wide variety of habitats, such as soil, plant material, waste water,
and dairy products [15]. C. casei, for instance, belongs to
the main lineage of the genus Corynebacterium [4,16] and
was identified as the dominant species on the surface of a
Gubbeen-type Irish farmhouse smear-ripened cheese by
taxonomic analyses [12,17]. The abundance of C. casei on
the cheese surface is closely followed by C. variabile,
which is taxonomically located in a distinct subline (cluster 3) of the genus Corynebacterium, with Corynebacterium jeikeium and Corynebacterium urealyticum as the
most prominent phylogenetic relatives [18,19]. C. casei
and C. variabile are salt-tolerant and able to grow in the
presence of 8.0% NaCl and at pH values below 4.9 [17].
Both corynebacteria also metabolize the lactate produced
by the starter bacteria, implying that they can grow from
the beginning of cheese ripening and may therefore not
depend on significant yeast growth during the initial stages
of the ripening process [17].
In the present study, we characterize the complete genome sequence of C. variabile DSM 44702 (formerly Corynebacterium mooreparkense) that was originally isolated
from the smear-ripened cheese Gubbeen and identified
by 16S rDNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization
studies [4]. It was initially described as the type strain of
a separate species named C. mooreparkense because the
organism was isolated at the Dairy Products Research
Centre in Moorepark, Ireland [4]. However, additional
molecular taxonomic studies demonstrated considerable
similarities of all C. mooreparkense isolates with the species C. variabile at the levels of 16S rDNA gene sequence

Page 2 of 23

and DNA-DNA relatedness [20]. It was therefore
concluded that the name C. mooreparkense is a later heterotypic synonym of C. variabile [20]. In the present
study, the annotation of the complete genome sequence
and the deduced genetic repertoire of C. variabile DSM
44702 provide detailed insights into the lifestyle and
metabolic features of this species, which is strongly
adapted to the cheese surface habitat, where it contributes to flavor and texture of the final product.

Results
Pyrosequencing and annotation of the C. variabile DSM
44702 genome

The DNA sequence of the C. variabile DSM 44702 chromosome was determined by a whole-genome shotgun
approach using pyrosequencing. A quarter of a sequencing
run with the Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument and
Titanium chemistry yielded 253, 845 reads and 97, 765,
747 bases that were assembled into 93 large contigs (≥500
bases) and 41 small contigs, indicating numerous repetitive elements and insertion sequences in the C. variabile
DSM 44702 genome. The remaining gaps in the chromosomal sequence were closed by PCR strategies, supported
by the r2cat tool [21] and the Consed program [22]. The
final assembly of the DNA sequences yielded a circular
chromosome with a size of 3, 433, 007 bp (Figure 1). A
28-fold coverage was thus obtained by pyrosequencing
when considering the final size of the C. variabile DSM
44702 chromosome. The mean G+C content of the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome is 67.15%, which is significantly
higher than the value (60%) initially determined by a
reverse-phase HPLC method [4]. The annotation of the C.
variabile genome sequence was performed with the
GenDB software system [23] and resulted in the detection
of 3, 071 protein-coding regions. Furthermore, 59 tRNA
genes were predicted by the tRNAscan-SE program [24]
and six rrn operons were detected on the leading strands
of the C. variabile chromosome (Figure 2).
General architecture of the C. variabile DSM 44702
genome

The plot of the calculated G/C skew [(G-C)/(G+C)] indicated a typical bi-directional replication mechanism of the
C. variabile chromosome (Figure 1). According to the presence and distribution of six conserved DnaA boxes, the
origin of chromosomal replication (oriC) is located downstream of the dnaA coding region [25]. Moreover, the
biased distribution of architecture imparting sequences
(AIMS) on the leading strands of the C. variabile chromosome indicated the presence of a dif region [26] at position
1, 603 kb on the chromosomal map, dividing the chromosome of C. variabile into two replichores of nearly similar
size (Figure 2). Due to the highly biased presence of AIMS
on the leading strands of the C. variabile chromosome

operons (rrnA-rrnF) on the leading strands of the C. variabile chromosome is indicated.

(Figure 2), we also examined the gene-strand bias in this
strain. In total, 59.6% of the predicted gene repertoire is
located on the leading strands of the C. variabile chromosome, revealing a moderate gene-strand bias in this species. However, it has been suggested previously that
essentiality is the driving force for gene-strand bias in bacterial genomes [27]. We therefore calculated also the
gene-strand bias for candidate essential genes in C. variabile. For this purpose, the set of 658 candidate essential
genes detected in the genome of Corynebacterium glutamicum R by high-density transposon mutagenesis [28,29]
was compared to the predicted gene repertoire of C. variabile by reciprocal BLASTP matches with the EDGAR software [30]. This comparative content analysis revealed 373
of the candidate essential genes from C. glutamicum R
having orthologs in the C. variabile genome. The majority
of these genes (80.4%) are located on the leading strands

Page 4 of 23

of the C. variabile chromosome, with 68% of all candidate
essential genes being located on the left replichore.
Synteny analysis by reciprocal best BLASTP hits [30]
revealed a highly conserved order of orthologous genes
between the chromosomes of C. variabile DSM 44702 and
C. jeikeium K411, with the exception of a translocated
DNA region comprising a segment of approximately
125 kb in size (Figure 3). This result is consistent with the
very close phylogenetic relationship of both species that
belong to the same subline (cluster 3) of the genus Corynebacterium [18,19], and the general observation that genetic
rearrangements are rare in corynebacterial genomes
[15,31]. The genome of C. variabile DSM 44702 thus contains the previously predicted inversions around dif and
oriC, which are both characteristic genomic features of
cluster 3 species in the genus Corynebacterium [31]. However, the synteny between both genomes is interrupted

syntenic regions between both chromosomes. Each dot represents a predicted C. variabile protein having an ortholog in the C. jeikeium
chromosome, with co-ordinates corresponding to the position of the respective coding region in each genome. Orthologous proteins were
identified by reciprocal best BLASTP matches with the EDGAR software. The genomic region of C. variabile DSM 44702 indicating a translocation
event is marked by an arrow. Selected genomic regions characterized by breakpoints of synteny between C. variabile and C. jeikeium are labeled
according to their predicted gene content.

due to the presence of additional genes in the C. variabile
chromosome that were functionally assigned to a phage
island, several transposon hotspots, and species-specific
gene islands, the latter containing for instance large gene
clusters involved in iron acquisition and siderophore biosynthesis (Figure 3). Some of these species-specific gene
islands show a significant deviation from the mean G+C
content of the C. variabile chromosome and are flanked
by several insertion sequences, suggesting that horizontal
gene transfer contributed to the evolution of the current
gene repertoire of strain DSM 44702 (Figure 1).
The phage island of the C. variabile chromosome has a
size of about 48.3 kb and comprises 60 genes (CVAR_
0826-CVAR_0886). This genomic region is locted between
two tRNAGly genes that may represent the integration site
of a putative phage. This view is supported by the presence
of 50-bp direct repeats, which are part of the tRNA genes
and flank the prophage-like region. Most genes (39 out of
60) of the phage island encode hypothetical proteins of
unknown function, whereas others encode enzymes
involved in phage DNA replication, recombination, and
repair. The structural proteins of the putative phage
revealed similarities to the tail structure of Rhodococcus
phage ReqiPine5 [32] and to the capsid structure of Listeria
phage A006 [33].
The calculated reciprocal best BLASTP hits [30] were
moreover used to compare the predicted proteome of C.
variabile DSM 44702 with the complete set of proteins

Page 5 of 23

encoded in the genomes of C. jeikeium K411 [34] and
C. urealyticum DSM 7109 [31], which are close taxonomic relatives with known genome sequences.
This comparative content analysis at proteome level
revealed that 1, 120 proteins (36.5%) of C. variabile
share homologs in the genomes of C. jeikeium and
C. urealyticum (Figure 4A). According to this comparative data, C. variabile contains 1, 699 proteins with no
homologous counterparts in the proteomes of the taxonomic relatives C. jeikeium and C. urealyticum. However,
it has to be considered that the three genomes of the taxonomically closely related species differ considerably in
their sizes as well as in the numbers of protein-coding
regions [31,34]. Thus, the 3.31 Mb sequence data of the
soil bacterium C. glutamicum R [28] was incorporated
into this comparative analysis, revealing a comparably
extensive set of 1, 534 genes that are specific for C. variabile when compared to the selected corynebacteria
(Figure 4B). This calculation indicates the presence of an
extensive and still unexplored variability in the gene
equipment of non-pathogenic corynebacteria. This set of
genes might contribute to the characteristic features of
C. variabile that define its distinct metabolic capabilities.
In the following sections, we present the detailed analysis of these metabolic features of C. variabile DSM
44702 and combine them with data deduced from the
predicted transcriptional regulatory repertoire. This
approach in evaluating the complete genome sequence

content analysis exploits all protein-coding regions of the selected genomes and detects orthologs by reciprocal best BLASTP matches with the
EDGAR software.

of C. variabile DSM 44702 revealed a collection of relevant genes contributing to the lifestyle of this species
and their integration into a transcriptional gene-regulatory network.
General metabolic features of C. variabile DSM 44702
deduced from the complete genome sequence

The experimental work on the taxonomic description of
C. variabile DSM 44702 as the type strain of the former
species C. mooreparkense revealed the ability of this cheese
isolate to utilize glucose, fructose, mannose, and ribose as
carbon and energy sources [4]. Bioinformatic analysis of
the gene repertoire assigned to the central carbohydrate
metabolism detected a complete set of genes involved in
glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate
pathway, as well as the presence of glucose- and fructosespecific components (ptsG and ptsF) of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system
(ptsH and ptsI) and at least one ABC-type transport system (sugABCD) for sugar uptake (Additional file 1). The
stcRS genes of a two-component signal transduction system are located directly upstream of the putative sugABCD
operon and might be involved in the transcriptional control of this sugar importer. Glucokinase and ribokinase
genes (glk and rbsK) are present in C. variabile DSM
44702, allowing the conversion of “free” sugars into phosphorylated central pathway intermediates (Additional
file 1).
According to the genome annotation, C. variabile DSM
44702 can utilize gluconate that is imported by gluconate
permease (gntP) and converted to 6-phosphogluconate
by gluconate kinase (gntK) (Additional file 1). C. variabile
DSM 44702 can moreover channel propionate via its
methylcitrate cycle genes [35] into the tricarboxylic acid
cycle (Additional file 1). Calcium propionate occurs naturally in many dairy products including cheese, and some
types of cheese contain as much as 1% of natural propionic acid [36]. Propionate is imported into C. variabile
DSM 44702 by a monocarboxylic acid transporter (mctC)
[37]. This secondary transport system can probably also
import pyruvate that exists naturally in cheese in small
amounts [37,38].
The tricarboxylic acid cycle of C. variabile DSM 44702
and the glyoxylate bypass are complete, with the exception
of the sucCD genes encoding two subunits of succinylCoA synthetase. The absence of these genes was also
observed in other Corynebacterium species, such as
C. diphtheriae [39], C. jeikeium [34], and C. urealyticum
[31]. It has been suggested that a succinyl-CoA:CoA transferase (cat1) catalyzes the conversion of succinyl-CoA to
succinate instead [39,40]. Candidate succinyl-CoA:CoA
transferases are encoded by the neighboring paralogs cat1
(CVAR_0586) and cat2 (CVAR_0587) in the C. variabile
DSM 44702 chromosome. Anaplerotic reactions in

Page 6 of 23

C. variabile DSM 44702 are accomplished by pyruvate
carboxylase (pyc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
(ppc).
All components constituting a non-branched respiratory
chain are present in C. variabile DSM 44702, along with
complete menaquinone and heme biosynthesis pathways
(Additional file 2). The terminal oxidase of the respiratory
chain most likely consists of both cytochrome bc1 oxidase
(qcrCAB) and cytochrome aa3 oxidase (ctaCDEF) that
might constitute a cytochrome bc1-aa3 supercomplex, as
previuosly described for C. glutamicum [41]. Moreover,
the genome of C. variable DSM 44702 contains the cydAB
genes encoding the subunits of cytochrome bd oxidase. In
mycobacteria, the cytochrome bd oxidase is induced
under microaerobic conditions because of the high oxygen
affinity of this enzyme [42]. This suggests that the cytochrome bc1-aa3 supercomplex is of basic importance for
C. variabile DSM 44702 under aerobic growth conditions.
The genes encoding subunits of the F1F0-ATP synthase
complex that is essential for ATP generation by oxidative
phosphorylation are present and organized in a putative
operon (atpBEFHAGDC).
The genome sequence of C. variabile DSM 44702 was
moreover screened for genes encoding enzymes, which
degrade, modify, or create glycosidic bonds according to
data stored in the CAZy database [43]. This seed information of CAZy includes glycoside hydrolases, glycosyl transferases, and carbohydrate esterases. The content of the
CAZy database also covers the associated carbohydratebinding module, comprising carbohydrate-active enzymes
that often display a modular structure with the aforementioned proteins. Candidate carbohydrate-active enzymes
encoded in C. variabile DSM 44702 were identified by a
combined approach using BLASTp analysis of all corynebacterial enzymes stored in the CAZy database and hidden
Markov models [44] created from amino acid sequence
alignments downloaded from the Pfam database [45].
Glycoside hydrolases (GH) hydrolyze glycosidic bonds and
are a widespread group of enzymes with at least 128
families [43,46]. C. variabile DSM 44702 encodes 15 candidate glycoside hydrolases associated to eight families.
The protein families GH13, GH23, and GH25 are represented by three proteins each, whereas the families GH32,
GH65, GH76, and GH19 contain only a single protein
member. Two proteins of C. variabile DSM 44702 were
associated to the glycoside hydrolase family GH3. Glycosyl
transferases (GT) catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties
during polysaccharide biosynthesis and are classified into
94 families [43,47]. A total number of 28 candidate glycosyl transferases was detected in the genome of C. variabile
DSM 44702 and grouped into 13 protein families. The largest families are GT2 and GT4, each containing six proteins, followed by family GT87 with three enzymes, and
GT1, GT3, and GT51 with two members. One protein

Schröder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:545
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/545

was identified in each of the families GT5, GT20, GT28,
GT35, GT39, GT53, and GT85. Carbohydrate esterases
(CE) catalyze the de-O-acylation or de-N-acylation of substituted saccharides and are grouped into 16 families
[43,48]. C. variabile DSM 44702 encodes 14 candidate carbohydrate esterases, six of them grouped into family CE1
and six enzymes classified into family CE9. Family CE14
contains two proteins. A carbohydrate-binding module
(CBM) is defined as a contiguous amino acid sequence
within a carbohydrate-active enzyme with a discreet fold
having carbohydrate-binding activity [49]. In C. variabile
DSM 44702, two proteins were assigned to family CBM48,
but the respective proteins are simultaneously associated
to family GH13. Altogether, 57 candidate proteins constitute the set of carbohydrate-active enzymes of C. variabile
DSM 44702.
Moreover, the hitherto known biosynthesis pathways for
vitamins and cofactors in corynebacteria were reconstructed and shown to be complete in C. variabile DSM
44702, including the synthesis of molybdenum cofactor
(Additional file 2). The anabolic pathways for purine and
pyrimidine nucleotides are also complete (data not
shown), as are all pathways for the de novo biosynthesis of
standard proteinogenic amino acids (Additional file 3).
The C. variabile DSM 44702 genome is equipped with
several transport systems allowing the import of “free”
amino acids (Additional file 3). The content of amino
acids varies between different types of cheese mainly due
to the duration and intensity of proteolysis during the
ripening process [50]. Seven amino acids are often concentrated in cheese and contribute to the taste of the final
product: leucine, lysine, and phenylalanine (bitter); proline
and valine (bitter sweet); aspartate and glutamate (salty
umami) [50]. According to the detailed knowledge of
amino acid transporters in C. glutamicum, putative importers for these amino acids are encoded in C. variabile
DSM 44702 by brnQ (leucine, valine, and isoleucine [51]),
lysI (lysine [52]), pheP (phenylalanine [53]), aroP (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan [54]), proP and putP (proline [55,56]), and gluABCD (glutamate [57]) (Additional
file 3). In addition, the sulphur-containing amino acid
methionine, which is the precursor of the flavor compound methanethiol, is imported into C. variabile DSM
44702 by two transport systems, an ABC-type transporter
encoded by the metQNI genes and a two-subunit member
of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family encoded
by the metP-metPS gene pair [58] (Additional file 3).
The secretome of C. variabile DSM 44702 deduced from
the complete genome sequence

Like other members of the genus Corynebacterium,
C. variabile DSM 44702 encodes two types of protein
secretion systems, the general secretory (Sec) pathway
and the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway. The

Page 7 of 23

Sec translocation pathway has two distinct functions in
bacterial protein trafficking, the cotranslational integration of proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane and the
posttranslational translocation of proteins across the
membrane [59]. The posttranslational export of proteins
is facilitated by the SecYEG translocon in conjunction
with the multifunctional protein SecA. The latter protein binds to cytosolic precursor proteins destined for
export and delivers them to the SecYEG translocon. As
the SecA protein is also an ATPase, it provides energy
for the stepwise translocation of the precursor protein
through the channel of the SecYEG translocon. The precursor proteins have a typical signal sequence at the
amino-terminal end, which is cleaved from the precursor by either signal peptidase I or signal peptidase II
[59].
The genome sequence of C. variabile DSM 44702
encodes all protein components of the basic Sec machinery necessary for protein secretion. The lepB1 and lepB2
genes encode homologs of signal petidase I (EC 3.4.21.89),
whereas the lspA gene codes for signal petidase II, also
named lipoprotein signal peptidase (EC 3.4.23.36). In addition, the secA2 gene of C. variabile DSM 44702 provides a
homolog of the preprotein translocase subunit SecA. The
presence of the accessory protein SecA2 was reported previously for other Gram-positive bacteria. In M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis, the SecA2 protein is required for
the export of a small subset of exoproteins, whereas SecA1
remains the essential housekeeping translocase [60]. On
the other hand, both SecA homologs are probably essential for viability in C. glutamicum [61]. C. variabile DSM
44702 moreover encodes the signal recognition particle
SRP, which is essential for targeting of almost all inner
membrane proteins in E. coli [62], as well as its receptor
FtsY [59].
To estimate the number of secreted proteins encoded by
C. variabile DSM 44702, the first 70 amino acid residues
of each protein were used to search for amino-terminal
signal peptides with SignalP 4.0 [63]. In this way, a total
number of 363 proteins were identified to be potentially
secreted by C. variabile. To furtheron deduce the number
of putative lipoproteins, all secreted proteins were
screened for the presence of a lipobox motif using the
DOLOP database tools [64]. Altogether, 66 lipobox-containing proteins were identified in the proteome of C. variabile DSM 44702. The signal peptides of these proteins
are therefore most likely recognized by signal peptidase II.
The signal peptides of the remaining 297 proteins are
recognized by signal peptidase I and the respective proteins are exported by the machinery of the Sec pathway of
C. variabile DSM 44702. However, it has to be considered
that proteins with membrane-spanning domains might
also contain signal peptides that are recognized by type I
signal peptidases [65]. Out of the 363 proteins predicted

Schröder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:545

to be secreted by C. variabile DSM 44702, a set of 100
proteins with membrane-spanning domains were detected
by the TMHMM tool [66], which therefore may be destined for the integration into the cytoplasmic membrane.
This sub-set of proteins comprises eleven membrane-associated enzymes with functions in the respiratory chain or
in cell wall turnover of C. variabile DSM 44702 and 25
putative permeases with transport functions for diverse
substrates. Two-thirds of the proteins were annotated as
putative membrane proteins with unknown functions.
After exclusion of proteins with membrane-spanning
domains, the remaining 263 predicted extracellular proteins of C. variabile DSM 44702 were grouped into functional categories according to the classification scheme of
the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG)
[67]. A large portion of the predicted extracellular proteins
was assigned to COG classes R (16%), S (6.4%), and X
(39.8%), containing proteins that are currently not grouped
into COGs or whose precise functions are hitherto
unknown. Prominent functional classes of the extracellular
proteins of C. variabile DSM 44702 comprise inorganic
ion transport and metabolism (COG class P; 16%), cell
wall and membrane biogenesis (COG class M; 7.6%), and
signal transduction mechanisms (COG class T; 3.4%).
The Tat pathway of C. variabile DSM 44702 is represented by two members of the TatC protein family
encoded by tatC1 and tatC2, as well as four members of
the TatA family encoded by paralogous versions of tatA
and tatB [68]. Proteins are targeted to the Tat pathway by
N-terminal signal peptides containing the twin-arginine
motif that is followed by a hydrophobic stretch of amino
acids [69]. In C. variabile DSM 44702, a total number of
ten proteins containing signal peptides meeting these criteria were detected by the prediction tools TATP [70] and
TATFIND [71]. This small number of proteins secreted by
the Tat pathway is comparable to those predicted previously in C. diphtheriae [72], C. glutamicum, and C. efficiens [65,73]. The set of proteins secreted by the Tat
pathway of C. variabile DSM 44702 includes for instance
an alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), a ceramidase (EC
3.5.1.23), an esterase of the SGNH type, and a Dyp-type
peroxidase.
The transcriptional regulatory repertoire of C. variabile
DSM 44702 deduced from the complete genome
sequence

The repertoire of candidate transcription regulators
encoded in the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome was
deduced from the functional genome annotation, taking
into account the comprehensive knowledge of the generegulatory network of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 [74].
A collection of 156 genes encoding DNA-binding transcription regulators (132 genes), sigma factors (8 genes),
and response regulators of two-component signal

transduction systems (16 genes) can be regarded as the
minimal regulatory repertoire of C. variabile DSM 44702
(Figure 5). It is noteworthy that among the genes for
response regulators, four are not associated with a corresponding sensor histidine kinase gene (CVAR_0325,
CVAR_0577, CVAR_1009, and CVAR_2072). The
deduced set of candidate transcription regulators represents 5.1% of the predicted protein-coding genes of the
C. variabile genome. This value is in the range known
from the 3.28 Mb genome of C. glutamicum ATCC
13032 (5.3%) [74] and is in agreement with previous
observations that less than 10% of the total number of
predicted proteins is associated with transcriptional regulatory processes in bacteria [75].
The collection of potential transcription regulators was
grouped into regulatory protein families according to
their amino acid sequence similarities and domain organizations [76]. This bioinformatic classification assigned
the predicted transcription regulators of C. variabile to
37 regulatory protein families that vary significantly in
their number of representatives (Figure 5). The largest
family of DNA-binding transcription regulators is TetR
with 30 members, followed by AraC with 13 proteins.
The TetR family of transcription regulators is widely distributed among bacterial species [77] and is also the most
prevalent group of regulatory proteins in other corynebacteria [78]. The AraC family of transcription regulators
comprises a diverse group of proteins that are involved in
the regulation of various biological processes, such as
carbon and nitrogen metabolism, adaptive responses,
stress responses, and virulence [79]. The number of
AraC-type transcriptional regulators is remarkably high
in C. variabile, as other non-pathogenic corynebacteria
encode only three or four members of this protein family,
whereas genes encoding AraC-type regulators are less
prevalent or even absent in the genomes of pathogenic
corynebacteria [78,80,81].
C. variabile encodes only 22 proteins of the previously
detected collection of 24 transcription regulators that
constitute the core set of DNA-binding transcription
regulators in corynebacteria. The genome of C. variabile
DSM 44702 lacks orthologs of the conserved regulators
RamB and SugR that are involved in the transcriptional
control of acetate metabolism and central sugar metabolism, respectively [74,78]. To detect regulatory interactions contributing to metabolic pathways relevant for
cheese ripening and flavor generation by C. variabile,
the deduced knowledge of the transcriptional regulatory
repertoire was combined with bioinformatic motif
searches for DNA-binding sites of prominent regulatory
proteins [82]. In this way, relevant metabolic pathways
of C. variabile DSM 44702 described below were linked
with the transcriptional regulatory network of this
cheese isolate.

number of candidate transcription regulators assigned to a regulatory protein family is shown.

Specific features of C. variabile DSM 44702 related to
carbohydrate metabolism and its regulation in the cheese
habitat

The characteristic features of the central carbohydrate
metabolism in C. variabile DSM 44702 with respect to
the ripening of smear-ripened cheeses are in part specified by genes providing the ability to metabolize citrate,
L-lactate, taurine, and g-amino butyric acid (Figure 6).
These metabolites are well-known as prominent components on the surface of smear-ripened cheeses from several previous studies [1,83-86].
Citrate uptake in C. variabile DSM 44702

The metabolic pathway reconstruction of C. variabile
DSM 44702 revealed the presence of the citP gene encoding a citrate transporter of the CitMHS protein family
(Figure 6). Members of this transporter family import
citrate in symport with Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions. Citrate is naturally occuring in milk, containing 8 to 9 mM of citrate
during fermentation [87]. Therefore, C. variabile DSM
44702 can benefit from the natural compositon of the
cheese habitat by importing citrate as an additional carbon
and energy source. Citrate metabolism is widespread
among lactic starter bacteria and can contribute to the
synthesis of flavor compounds, such as acetoin and butanediol [88-91].
The expression of the citrate transporter gene citP is
most likely regulated by the two-component signal

transduction system CitAB. The corresponding citAB
genes are located upstream of citP in the C. variabile
DSM 44702 genome. The orthologous two-component
system of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 was shown to regulate genes involved in citrate uptake and metabolism
[92]. Target genes of the CitAB system are apparently
coregulated by the cAMP-sensing transcription regulator
GlxR in this species [74]. The GlxR protein is currently
the only known global transcription regulator in corynebacteria, connecting different functional modules of the
gene-regulatory network [93]. The glxR gene is conserved
among all hitherto sequenced corynebacterial species and
also present in C. variabile DSM 44702. A GlxR binding
site was detected upstream of the citP coding region,
indicating that the expression of this gene is under local
control by CitAB and under global control by GlxR in C.
variabile DSM 44702.
Lactate metabolism in C. variabile DSM 44702

Two main sources of carbon available to microorganisms at the beginning of cheese ripening are lactose and
lactate [1]. Lactose is rapidly converted to lactate in the
early days of cheese ripening by the large number of lactic starter bacteria present in the cheese. Lactate is thus
the most important carbon source after a few days of
cheese ripening [1,94]. According to the taxonomic
description and genome sequence data, C. variabile
DSM 44702 is unable to utilize lactose [4]. On the other

Figure 6 Metabolic features of C. variabile DSM 44702 relevant for the lifestyle on the surface of smear-ripened cheeses and during
cheese ripening. The selected metabolic and regulatory features were deduced from the annotation of the complete genome sequence.

hand, the growth rate of C. variabile and lactate dehydrogenase activity were significantly increased in the
presence of lactate [95]. The C. variabile DSM 44702
genome contains the lldT gene coding for L-lactate permease involved in L-lactate uptake, which is located
upstream of the lldD1 gene. A paralog of lldD1, named
lldD2, is located elsewhere on the chromosome. Both
genes encode L-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) that
facilitates the conversion of L-lactate to pyruvate. In
addition, L-lactate can be converted to acetate by lactate
2-monooxygenase (EC 1.13.12.4) encoded by the lldA
gene of C. variabile DSM 44702. D-Lactate is also used
as substrate by three dld paralogs (dld1-dld3) coding for
D-lactate dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.28). D-Lactate is a

natural product in smear-ripened cheeses formed by lactic acid bacteria that can produce both stereoisomers of
lactic acid [94]. Due to efficient metabolism of L-lactate
and D-lactate, C. variabile can probably grow from the
beginning of the ripening process and is independent of
significant yeast growth during the initial stages of
cheese ripening [17]. GlxR binding sites were detected
upstream of the putative lldT-lldD1 operon, upstream
of the lldD2 coding region as well as in front of the
paralogous dld genes (data not shown). Lactate metabolism of C. variabile DSM 44702, with the exception of
lldA expression, is thus under global control by GlxR, as
it was demonstrated previously in C. glutamicum ATCC
13032 [74,96].

Taurine utilization by C. variabile DSM 44702

Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is a sulfonated
amino acid that is not incorporated into polypeptides. It
derives from the metabolism of sulphur-containing amino
acids and is the most abundant free amino acid in goat’s
milk, with a mean value of 66.2 mg/l [97]. The amount of
taurine in cow’s milk is considerably lower (1.6-10 mg/l)
[98]. The C. variabile DSM 44702 genome contains a gene
cluster involved in the assimilation of taurine (Figure 6).
The respective genomic region comprises the tauCBA
genes encoding a predicted taurine transporter of the ABC
superfamily, the tauD1 gene encoding a putative taurine
dioxygenase, and the tauR gene coding for a ROK-type
transcription regulator. Moreover, C. variabile DSM
44702 contains a paralog of tauD1 not located in this gene
cluster, tauD2, encoding a second taurine dioxygenase.
This enzyme (EC 1.14.11.17) catalyzes the key step in taurine assimilation by generating sulfite, aminoacetaldehyde,
and succinate (Figure 6). As the resulting sulfite can be
converted to cysteine, the cheese component taurine
can serve as a combined sulphur and carbon source for
C. variabile DSM 44702.
The expression of the tauCBA and tauD1 genes is
apparently regulated by TauR, a ROK-type transcription
regulator, whose corresponding gene is located upstream
of the tauD1CBA operon. ROK-type regulators are
known from C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 to contribute
to the transcriptional control of sulphur metabolism that
is under hierarchical control by the TetR-type regulator
McbR [99-101]. McbR belongs to the core set of corynebacterial transcription regulators [74] and acts as the
master regulator of all aspects of sulphur metabolism in
C. glutamicum and C. jeikeium [101,102]. The McbR protein is also encoded in C. variabile DSM 44702 by the
mcbR gene that is located at the boundary of the small
duplicated genomic region CVAR_2865-CVAR_2874
(mcbR). The second copy of this DNA segment is part of
the iron acquisition island II (Figure 3), comprises the
coding regions CVAR_2821-CVAR_2830, and ends with
a 5’ truncated version of the mcbR gene, named mcbR2.
A genome-wide search for McbR binding sites in C. variabile DSM 44702 detected 23 operators that are probably controlling 41 genes involved in (S-adenosyl)
methionine biosynthesis, methionine import, cysteine
biosynthesis, and sulfate reduction (data not shown). In
addition, McbR binding sites were detected in the tauRtauD1 intergenic region and in front of the tauD2 coding
region. This data strongly indicates that all genes
involved in taurine assimilation are embedded in the sulphur regulatory network of C. variabile DSM 44702.
GABA utilization by C. variabile DSM 44702

GABA (g-amino butyric acid) is a four-carbon, non-proteinogenic amino acid known to occur in cheese with a

Page 11 of 23

varying concentration that is strongly affected by the protocol of cheese manufacture, the type of primary starter
cultures, the cheese microbiota, and the ripening conditions [85,86]. Several species of lactic starter bacteria are
able to synthesize GABA from L-glutamate by glutamate
decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15) [85] that is widely distributed
among eukaryotes and prokaryotes [103] and also encoded
in the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome by the gadB gene.
In addition, GABA is degraded to succinate by the
enzymes g-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.19)
and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.16)
in C. variable DSM 44702 (Figure 6). These three enzymatic reactions belong to a metabolic pathway known as
GABA shunt [104]. Two genes encoding GABA transporters (gabP1 and gabP2) were detected in C. variabile DSM
44702. The first one is located in a cluster comprising the
genes gabD1 encoding succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, gabT1 coding for g-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, and gabR1 specifying a transcription regulator. The
second gene cluster attributed to GABA utilization is composed of gabP2, gabT2, and gabR2, and is thus lacking a
gabD component. In total, six potential gabD genes
(gabD1-gabD6) are distributed across the C. variabile
DSM 44702 chromosome.
According to this genome annotation, the uptake and
catabolism of GABA in C. variabile DSM 44702 is represented by at least three gene regions (Figure 6). The first
gene cluster (gabT1-gabD1-gabP1) is preceded by the regulatory gene gabR1 coding for a transcription regulator of
the COG2508 class. Likewise, the second gene cluster
(gabT2-gabP2) is preceded by the regulatory gene gabR2
also coding for a transcription regulator assigned to the
COG2508 class. The presence of this type of regulatory
genes upstream of gab gene clusters is conserved among
GABA-utilizing corynebacteria [105], suggesting that the
respective regulators of the COG2508 class are involved in
the transcriptional control of the divergently arranged
gabT(D)P genes. The succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase gene gabD2 is located elsewhere on the chromosome
and organized in an operon with the regulatory gene
gabR3, which encodes a transcription regulator of the LysR
protein family [106]. Moreover, GlxR binding sites were
detected in the intergenic region of gabR1/gabT1 and
gabR2/gabT2, as well as upstream of the gabR3 coding
region, indicating that the respective GABA-related genes
of C. variabile DSM 44702 are under hierarchical regulation by local GabR regulators and the global cAMPsensing regulator GlxR. Integration of GABA utilization
into the global GlxR network of C. variabile DSM 44702 is
reasonable, because the central pathway intermediate succinate is finally generated by the GABA shunt (Figure 6).
Furthermore, it is remarkable that GABA utilization as
well as taurine and propionate metabolism channel

Schröder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:545
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/545

succinate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as the typical
generation of this compound by succinyl-CoA synthetase
is not encoded in C. variabile DSM 44702.
Nitrate, nitrite, and oxaloacetate metabolism of C.
variabile DSM 44702 in the cheese habitat

Low amounts of nitrates and nitrites are natural constituents of many types of cheese [107]. Both compounds may
exert important effects on human health when present in
higher concentrations, as they may react with naturally
present amines to form potent carcinogens. The content
of nitrates and nitrites in cheese is therefore strictly regulated by law in many European countries. The annotation
of the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome sequence revealed
the presence of the nrtABC genes encoding an ABC-type
transport system involved in nitrate uptake (Figure 6).
Nitrate can be reduced by a putative nitrate reductase (EC
1.7.99.4) encoded by the narB gene of C. variabile DSM
44702, which is located upstream of nirB and nirD, both
coding for subunits of nitrite reductase (EC 1.7.1.4). This
enzyme converts nitrite to ammonium hydroxide, resulting in the detoxification of nitrite and the generation of a
suitable nitrogen source for C. variabile DSM 44702.
Alternatively, nitrite can be exportet by the putative nitrite
extrusion protein NarT, which is encoced in the same
gene cluster by the narT gene.
Moreover, the oxalate:formate antiporter gene oxlT was
identified in C. variabile DSM 44702 (Figure 6). The OxlT
protein is a member of the major facilitator superfamily
and exchanges formate for oxalate across the cytoplasmic
membrane [108]. Oxalate is present in milk and cheese in
relatively small amounts. Nevertheless, oxalic acid can
react with calcium ions in the milk producing calcium
oxalate, thereby preventing this vital nutrient from being
absorbed in the human intestine [109]. In principle, oxalate can be converted to formate by oxalate decarboxylase
(EC 4.1.1.2), but the respective oxdD gene is absent in the
genome of C. variabile DSM 44702. However, formate can
be oxidized in C. variabile DSM 44702 by formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2) encoded by the fdhFD genes (Additional file 1). Due to import of oxalic acid by C. variabile
DSM 44702, the binding of calcium ions probably occurs
to a lower degree in smear-ripened cheeses in the presence
of this strain. Therefore, the gene equipment of C. variabile DSM 44702 provides a substantial benefit for the
quality of smear-ripened cheeses.
Lipolysis and fatty acid metabolism by C. variabile DSM
44702 in the cheese habitat

Cow’s milk contains high amounts of lipids and triacylglycerides (about 35 g/l), which may serve as carbon and
energy sources for the microflora of smear-ripened
cheeses [110]. Free fatty acids derive from breakdown of
triacylglycerides, and their further degradation can lead to

Page 12 of 23

volatile compounds having low olfactory thresholds in
cheese flavor perception [111]. In smear-ripened cheeses,
more than 4 g/kg of free fatty acids are available for the
surface microbiota [1]. The genome of C. variabile DSM
44702 is equipped with a large set of genes encoding
enzymes involved in lipolysis and the degradation of fatty
acids (Figure 6). It contains five genes (estA1-estA5)
encoding secreted esterases of the SGNH-hydrolase superfamily and the estB gene coding for an esterase of the AB
hydrolase superfamily [112]. Secreted lipases are encoded
by five genes in the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome. The
paralogous lipA genes (lipA1-lipA3) encode class 2 lipases
that hydrolyse ester bonds in triacylglycerol giving diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, glycerol, and free fatty acids
[112]. The genes lipS1 and lipS2 belong to the LIP superfamily containing lipases with broad lipolytic activities
[112]. All these enzymes may thus contribute to the generation of free fatty acids from precursor molecules
present in the cheese habitat.
Furthermore, 13 fadD genes encoding acyl-CoA
synthetases were identified in the genome of C. variabile
DSM 44702, including the fadD1 gene that is involved
in mycolic acid biosynthesis [113]. The amino acid
sequences of the FadD enzymes in C. variabile DSM
44702 revealed low levels of overall similarity, but the
characteristic AMP-binding motif of acyl-CoA synthetase is highly conserved among the twelve paralogs
(FadD2-FadD13). In principle, acyl-CoA synthetases are
involved in activating free fatty acids to form acyl-CoA
of various chain lengths concomitant with the transport
into the bacterial cell [114]. The amino acid sequence
diversity of the predicted acyl-CoA synthetases might
indicate different substrate specificities of these
enzymes, which would enable C. variabile to utilize a
broader range of fatty acid substrates in its natural
cheese habitat, probably leading to a growth advantage
as a well-adapted species.
In addition to the set of fadD genes, a complete b-oxidation pathway for fatty acid degradation is encoded in the
C. variabile DSM 44702 genome (Figure 6). In this pathway, the acyl-CoA is converted into a product with a shortened acyl chain (n-2) and acetyl-CoA that can be used in
the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate energy, whereas the
shortened acyl-CoA is used in a new round of b-oxidation
[115]. In principle, C. variabile DSM 44702 can utilize
exogenous fatty acids also as carbon sources, since the
glyoxylate bypass genes aceA and aceB are present and the
gluconeogenesis pathway is complete (Additional file 1).
The predicted enzymes involved in b-oxidation of C. variabile DSM 44702 are encoded by ten paralogs of fadE
(encoding acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), the bifunctional
fadB1 gene (enoyl-CoA hydratase/hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), three monofunctional fadB genes (hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), three echA genes (enoyl-CoA

Schröder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:545
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/545

hydratase), and five paralogs of fadA (ketoacyl-CoA thiolase). The amino acid sequences of these paralogous gene
families vary substantially, again suggesting diverse substrate specificities of the respective enzymes, at least in the
case of the ten acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Interestingly, all
genes coding for secreted esterases or lipases and almost
all fad and echA genes of C. variabile DSM 44702 contain
at least one GlxR binding site in their upstream regions
(data not shown), indicating that the complete metabolic
process of lipolysis and b-oxidation is under global control
by the GlxR protein.
In contrast to the lipid-auxotrophic relatives C. jeikeium
and C. urealyticum, the metabolic pathway analysis of the
C. variabile DSM 44702 genome revealed the presence of
the fatty acid synthase gene fas, showing that growth of
this strain is not dependent on the availability of exogenous fatty acids [31,34]. These compounds are, moreover,
building blocks for the synthesis of corynomycolic acids,
which are major constituents of the corynebacterial cell
envelope [116]. It was shown previously that a polyketide
synthase encoded by the pks13 gene represents a condensase that catalyzes the key step in the biosynthesis of corynomycolic acids, in conjunction with an acyl-CoA
carboxylase and a distinct acyl-AMP ligase [117-119]. The
pks13 gene is located in a conserved cluster in the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome, including genes coding for an
acyl-CoA carboxylase (accD3), an acyl-CoA synthetase/
acyl-AMP ligase (fadD1), the envelope lipids regulation
factor ElrF (elrF), and trehalose corynomycol transferases
(cmt). It is noteworthy that eight genes encoding trehalose
corynomycolyl transferases (cmtA-cmtH) were identified
in the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome, catalyzing the
transfer of mycolic acids from trehalose monocorynomycolate to another molecule of trehalose monocorynomycolate or on the cell wall arabinogalactan [116]. Five of these
genes (cmtC-cmtG) are clustered with the pks13 gene.
A second gene cluster involved in fatty acid metabolism
of C. variabile DSM 44702 includes genes coding for
putative acyl-CoA carboxylase subunits (CVAR_2092 and
CVAR_2091), an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase domain-containing protein (CVAR_2090), an enoyl-CoA hydratase
domain-containing protein (CVAR_2089), a citrate lyase
b-subunit (citE), an acyl-CoA synthetase (fadD6), ayclCoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase subunits (scoA and
scoB), and a ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (fadA4). A similar
gene cluster is present only in the genome of the lipophilic isolate C. jeikeium K411, whereas some genes were
found in a similar genetic arrangement in the genome of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv [120]. As most of the
genes present in these conserved clusters are linked to
fatty acid degradation, they might be involved in the activation and subsequent degradation of a distinct type of
fatty acid substrate, whose chemical composition is currently unknown.

Proteolysis and utilization of caseins by C. variabile DSM
44702 in the cheese habitat

Protein degradation contributes to cheese texture and the
generation of cheese flavor in all varieties of smear-ripened
cheeses, as many relevant flavor compounds derive
directly from amino acids [1,87,91,121]. Milk and especially cheese have a high protein content, which is represented by a mixture of aS1-, aS2-, and b-caseins [1].
Extracellular caseins can be degraded by C. variabile DSM
44702 by means of secreted proteolytic enzymes, such as a
secretory serine protease encoded by the sepP gene and a
secretory aminopeptidase encoded by the pepC gene
(Figure 6). In addition, amino-terminal prolines are
released from peptides by the enzymatic action of proline
iminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.5) encoded by the pepI gene.
The enzymatic activity of an extracellular proline iminopeptidase from C. variabile NCDO 2101 was demonstrated previously [122]. Since caseins are very rich in
proline residues and proline is the most abundant amino
acid in cheese, it may constitute a prominent substrate for
C. variabile. The import of “free” or released proline is
facilitated in C. variabile DSM 44702 by the amino acid
transporters ProP and PutP (Additional file 3). The subsequent oxidation of proline to glutamate is catalyzed as a
two-step reaction by a bifunctional proline dehydrogenase
(EC 1.5.99.8 and EC 1.5.1.12) encoded by the putA gene
[123].
Interestingly, McbR binding sites were detected in the
upstream regions of sepP and pepC, suggesting the integration of these genes into the sulphur regulatory network
of C. variabile DSM 44702. Therefore, proteolysis might
be used by C. variabile DSM 44702 to cover the demand
for sulphur-containing amino acids and is probably
enhanced under sulphate starvation conditions. Other
genes assigned to proteolysis by C. variabile DSM 44702
are also linked to unfavorable environmental conditions
by regulatory features. The proline importer gene putP,
for instance, is specified by the presence of a typical SOS
box and seems to be under the direct transcriptional control by the SOS response regulator LexA, as previously
demonstrated in C. glutamicum [124]. Moreover, the proline iminopeptidase gene pepI is organized in an operon
and located downstream of sodC in the C. variabile DSM
44702 genome. The sodC gene encodes a secreted copper,
zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) that is
characterized by a lipobox motif to be anchored in the cell
membrane [64]. The extracellular location of SodC indicates that it helps to protect the cell surface of C. variabile
against superoxide generated externally by the microbiota
of smear-ripened cheeses. The gene arrangement of pepI
and sodC implies that the proline iminopeptidase gene
plays a role in the responses to external stresses, which is
reasonable since proline can be used as compatible solute
in corynebacteria under osmotic stress conditions [125].

Osmotic and oxidative stress responses of C. variabile
DSM 44702

Due to permanently changing environmental conditions
during the ripening process of smear-ripened cheeses, the
bacteria of the cheese microbiota are constantly exposed
to several external stresses, such as pH stress and osmotic
stress [110,126]. As the pH of the cheese curd can be as
low as 4.5 during the early stage of cheese processing,
C. variabile has to cope with this external stress condition.
It was demonstrated in C. glutamicum that potassium
transport is essential for corynebacterial pH homeostasis
and growth at acidic pH [127]. The potassium channel
CglK was found to be relevant for the maintenance of the
internal pH and the adjustment of the membrane potential. The genome sequence of C. variabile DSM 44702 was
therefore screened for the presence of genes coding for
actinobacterial potassium transporters, of which seven different types were described very recently [128]. C. variabile DSM 44702 encodes a homolog of the potassium
channel CglK (CVAR_2147) and a Kef-type potassium
transport system (CVAR_0647). Moreover, a sodium or
potassium/H+ antiporter of the NhaP-type (CVAR_1814)
might contribute to pH homeostasis in C. variabile DSM
44702.
C. variabile DSM 44702 is also well equipped with genes
offering protection from osmotic stress that derives from
high salt concentrations on the cheese surface during the
ripening process (Figure 6). One mechanism to overcome
this osmotic stress is the accumulation of osmoprotectants, such as ectoine, proline, and glycine betaine in the
cytoplasm [125]. The genome of C. variabile DSM 44702
contains the ectP gene encoding an ectoine transporter,
proP coding for an osmoregulated proline transporter, and
six genes (betP1-betP3 and betT1-betT3) encoding putative betaine/carnitine/choline transporters of the BCCT
family. Betaine can be synthesized in two steps from the
precursor choline by choline oxidase (EC 1.1.3.17) and
betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.8) mediated
reactions. Milk and cheese contain high amounts of choline [129], making it available as precursor for the synthesis of betaine by C. variabile. The C. variabile DSM
44702 genome contains two betA genes (betA1 and betA2)
encoding choline oxidases, of which the betA1 gene is
clustered with the betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase gene
betB and the putative choline transporter gene betT1. The
homologous uptake systems for osmoprotectants were
extensively studied in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 [130],
as was the two-component system MtrAB that is involved
in the transcriptional control of the genes encoding
osmoregulated compatible solute carriers [131]. The
mtrAB gene pair was also identified in the genome of C.
variabile DSM 44702, suggesting the presence of a similiar
MtrAB-controlled network of osmoprotection in this
species.

The C. variabile DSM 44702 genome is moreover
equipped with several genes involved in oxidative stress
responses, such as two genes (katA and katG) encoding
catalases (EC 1.11.1.6), duplicated genes (sodA1 and
sodA2) coding for intracellular manganese-dependent
superoxide dismutases (EC 1.15.1.1), and the aforementioned secreted copper, zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase gene sodC. Additional functions involved in oxidative
stress responses are provided by bcp coding for a peroxiredoxin, tpx encoding a thiol peroxidase, and the ahpCD
gene pair encoding the subunits of alkyl hydroperoxide
reductase (EC 1.11.1.15). The latter protein is an antioxidant enzyme responsible for directly reducing organic
hyperoxides [132], whereas thiol peroxidase represents an
oxidative stress defense system that uses reduction equivalents from thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase to
reduce alkyl hydroperoxides [133]. Thioredoxin (EC
1.8.1.8) and thioredoxin reductase (EC 1.8.1.9) are also
encoded by the trxA and trxB genes in the genome of
C. variabile DSM 44702. The Bcp protein belongs to the
bacterioferritin comigratory protein subfamily of the peroxiredoxin superfamily and represents also a thioredoxindependent thiol peroxidase [112].
Furthermore, the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome contains the regulatory gene oxyR encoding a homolog of the
central regulator of oxidative stress responses in bacteria
[134,135]. The oxyR gene belongs to the core set of corynebacterial transcription regulators [74] and is located
adjacent to the ahpCD gene pair of C. variabile DSM
44702. This gene order is also conserved in several corynebacterial genomes and in genomes of slow-growing
mycobacteria, where oxyR is involved in the activation of
ahpCD gene expression [136,137]. According to this conserved gene arrangement in actinobacterial species and
experimental data from mycobacteria, it is likely that
OxyR controls at least the expression of the ahpCD
genes in C. variabile DSM 44702. The katG gene of
C. variabile DSM 44702 is probably under transcriptional
control by LexA, as a DNA-binding site (SOS box) of this
regulator was detected in front of the katG coding region
(data not shown). The LexA protein is the key component of the bacterial SOS response [138], and the lexA
gene is conserved in all corynebacterial genomes [74].
Iron acquisition by C. variabile DSM 44702 in the irondepleted cheese habitat

For most bacteria, iron is essential as a cofactor for proteins involved in important cellular functions, such as
DNA biosynthesis and aerobic respiration [139]. Thus,
iron acquisition is a vital function for bacterial survival.
However, milk and cheese contain the iron-binding protein lactoferrin that can deny iron to microorganisms in
such a way that smear-ripened cheeses contain only small
amounts of readily available iron [140]. To circumvent this

Schröder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:545
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/545

limitation of iron in the cheese habitat, bacteria of the
cheese microflora have evolved several molecular strategies, including the synthesis of siderophores during the
ripening process [141]. Siderophores are high-affinity ironchelating compounds, often synthesized by non-ribosomal
peptide synthetases in response to low-iron availability in
the environment [142]. The genome of C. variabile DSM
44702 contains five genes (nrpS1-nrpS5) encoding proteins
with sequence similarities to multi-domain peptide synthetases (Figure 6). The peptide synthetase genes nrpS2 to
nrpS5 are clustered in iron-acquisition island II of the
C. variabile genome (Figure 3). This genomic island contains also the entC2 and entE2 genes, coding for isochorismate synthase (EC 5.4.4.2) and 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoateAMP ligase (EC 2.7.7.58), respectively. These gene
products revealed similarities to proteins involved in the
biosynthesis of the catechol siderophores bacillibactin
from Bacillus subtilis [143] and enterobactin from Escherichia coli [144]. Additional enzymatic functions involved in
the biosynthesis of catechol siderophores are encoded in
the entA-entC1-entB-fes gene cluster of C. variabile DSM
44702. The entA gene encodes 2, 3-dihydro-2, 3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.28) and the entB gene
codes for isochorismatase (EC 3.3.2.1). The product of the
fes gene is similar to enterobactin esterase that is probably
required for the removal of iron from the siderophore. In
conjunction with a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase,
these genes provide a complete pathway for the synthesis
of catechol siderophores with chorismate as the precursor
[145]. Among the cluster 3 species of the genus Corynebacterium, similar siderophore biosynthesis genes are only
present in the genome of C. jeikeium K411 [34].
Further analysis of the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome
sequence revealed the presence of 29 genes with predicted
functions in the utilization of iron-siderophores, named
either siu (siderophore-iron utilization protein) or sii (siderophore-iron interacting protein) (Figure 7). Siu gene clusters are represented by siuS genes encoding substratebinding proteins (siuS1-siuS17), siuU genes encoding siderophore utilization proteins (siuU1 and siuU2), and sii
genes coding for siderophore-interacting proteins (siiAsiiE), which might be necessary for the removal of iron
from iron-siderophore complexes [110]. In addition, five
regulatory genes (siuR1-siuR5) encoding transcription regulators of the AraC protein family were assigned to these
gene clusters. Interestingly, numerous genes involved in
iron utilization are located in the iron acquisition islands I
(CVAR_230-CVAR_0239) and II (CVAR_2806-CVAR_
2820) of the C. variabile genome (Figure 3).
A further aspect of iron aquisition is the transport of
this trace element into the bacterial cell. The C. variabile
DSM 44702 genome contains 23 genes with assigned
functions in ferric iron uptake (fiu) (Figure 7). The fiu
gene clusters are represented by genes coding for

Page 15 of 23

substrate-binding proteins (fiuS), permease components
(fiuP and fiuQ), ATP-binding proteins (fiuA), and an
iron-utilization protein (fiuU1). In addition, three fiu
gene clusters contain regulatory genes (fiuR1-fiuR3)
encoding transcription regulators of the AraC family
(Figure 7). The accumulation of genes coding for AraClike proteins in the siu and fiu gene clusters explains the
large number of transcription regulators assigned to this
protein family in C. variabile DSM 44702 (Figure 5),
when compared with the regulatory repertoires in other
corynebacterial genomes [78,80,81].
As iron limitation poses a problem for the microflora of
the cheese surface, the microorganisms have to compete
for iron, but nonetheless, they must regulate iron metabolism to prevent excess iron that can initiate the generation
of toxic oxygen radicals from normal products of metabolism by the Fenton reaction [146]. Bacteria have solved the
problem of iron acquisition and homeostasis by encoding
uptake systems that are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level [139]. DtxR is the key transcription regulator
controlling complex gene-regulatory networks involved in
iron homeostasis in corynebacteria [74,147]. The complete
genome sequence of C. variabile DSM 44702 was
screened for the presence of DtxR binding sites, using the
experimentally validated binding motif from C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 as input [147]. This genome-wide motif
search detected 26 operators that are probably controlling
the expression of 62 target genes, including for instance
dps (DNA protection during starvation protein), ftn (ferritin), hmuO (heme oxygenase), sdhCAB (succinate dehydrogenase), and the suf operon involved in Fe-S cluster
assembly. Among the detected operators, 17 are located in
the siu and fiu gene clusters of C. variabile DSM 44702,
regulating in total 41 genes that are organized in 18 transcription units (Figure 7). This result indicates that almost
all siu and fiu gene clusters are integrated into the ironregulatory network of C. variabile DSM 44702 that
obviously exerts a hierarchical control of gene expression
by DtxR in concert with the AraC-type regulators of these
clusters. Such a complex transcriptional regulation of iron
homeostasis has not been detected in any sequenced corynebacterial genome before [74].
Contribution of C. variabile DSM 44702 to flavor
generation during cheese ripening

The flavor compounds commonly found in smear-ripened
cheeses are produced by the cheese microbiota as a diverse
group of volatile substances, including volatile sulphurcontaining compounds, esters, aldehydes, and ketones
[148]. Half of these compounds derive from lactose fermentation, citrate degradation, and a few from lipolysis.
The second half derives from amino acid catabolism by
complex metabolic pathways [87]. Methanethiol, for
instance, derives from methionine and is a prominent

aroma compound in smear-ripened cheeses. Several
cheese-related strains of B. linens produce high amounts
of methanethiol due to the presence of L-methionine-glyase (EC 4.4.1.11) [149]. This enzyme converts
methionine to methanethiol via a g-elimination step. A
corresponding mgl gene was not detectable in the genome of C. variabile DSM 44702, although this strain
was shown previously to produce methanethiol [4].
This observation indicates that other enzymes must be
responsible for the synthesis of methanethiol in C. variabile DSM 44702. Cystathionine b-lyase (EC 4.4.1.8)
and cystathionine g-lyase (EC 4.4.1.1) catalyze similar
reactions in lactococci [150,151], but only the former
enzyme is encoded by the aecD gene in C. variabile
DSM 44702.
Acetoin (3-hydroxybutanone) is another aroma compound of smear-ripened cheeses and gives butter its
characteristic flavor [87,152]. C. variabile DSM 44702
produces acetoin from pyruvate, with acetolactate being
an intermediate. The conversion of acetolactate to acetoin is mediated by acetolactate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.5)
encoded by the alsD gene (Figure 6). Moreover, acetoin
can be converted to 2, 3-butanediol by the enzymatic
activity of acetoin reductase (EC 1.1.1.4) encoded by the
butA gene in C. variabile DSM 44702. Butanediol is also
an important flavor compound in some varieties of
smear-ripened cheeses [153].

Discussion
Cheese is one of the oldest dairy products produced by
humanity and its origin predates recorded history [1].
Nowadays, hundreds of cheese varieties are produced
throughout the world in wide-ranging textures, forms, and
flavors. The production processes of all cheese varieties
share one common characteristic: the microflora present
in each cheese contributes to the typical properties of the
final product, such as taste, aroma, and color [1,94]. The
complex interactions of these microorganisms and the various biochemical processes occuring during cheese ripening are the result of centuries of adaptation of yeasts,
moulds, and bacteria to the cheese habitat [94]. During
the traditional ripening of smear-ripened cheeses, the surface flora of old, ripenend cheeses was transfered to
young, unripened cheeses by a brining step in the early
stage of ripening, a process named “old-young smearing”
[154]. Therefore, the combined metabolic activities of a
highly adapted bacterial community on the surface of
smear-ripened cheeses have evolved over many years to
determine all aspects of the mature product [94]. However, the process of “old-young smearing” involves the
transfer of a complex, undefined, and variable microflora.
Therefore, a significant improvement in the industrial production of smear-ripened cheeses is nowadays achieved by
using defined surface starter cultures. C. variabile was

Page 17 of 23

shown previously to be an important bacterial component
on the surface of the smear-ripened cheeses Brick and
Gubbeen [4,10,17,20]. Likewise, C. casei is also a dominant
component on the surface of Gubbeen, but is moreover
found to be dominant on the surface of other smearripened cheeses, such as Ardrahan, Durrus, and Milleens
[11]. Therefore, we reconstructed in this study the metabolic capabilities of C. variabile DSM 44702 from the
complete genome sequence to understand its adaptation
to the cheese surface habitat and its physiological role in
cheese ripening and flavor generation.
The C. variabile genome (3.43 Mb) contains large
regions with high levels of synteny with the chromosome
of the close phylogenetic relative C. jeikeium (2.46 Mb), a
multi-drug resistant nosocomial pathogen [155]. However,
the size of the C. variabile genome is rather characteristic
of environmental corynebacteria [15], such as C. glutamicum (3.28-3.31 Mb), Corynebacterium efficiens (3.14 Mb),
and Corynebacterium nuruki (3.11 Mb), than of pathogenic
relatives of the cluster 3 subline [31,34,80]. In contrast to
the genetic repertoires of the cluster 3 species C. jeikeium
and C. urealyticum that both show a clear reduction of
genes associated with catabolic activities of carbon sources,
the metabolic reconstruction of C. variabile revealed the
presence of a complete set of enzymes required for central
carbohydrate metabolism, vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis, and the synthesis of amino acids. C. variabile is
equipped for instance with several additional enzymes and
proteins required for the utilization of substrates typically
present on the cheese surface, including citrate, lactate,
propionate, taurine, and g-amino butyric acid (GABA). The
utilization of the sulfonated amino acid taurine as a combined carbon and sulphur source by C. variabile has not
been reported so far in conjunction with other bacterial
species associated with smear-ripened cheeses. GABA was
shown to be synthesized by lactic starter bacteria within
the body of 22 Italian cheese varieties, such as Gorgonzola,
Mozzarella, and Pecorino [85], and is also utilized as carbon source by Arthrobacter arilaitensis [110], which is one
of the major bacterial species detected on the surface of
smear-ripened cheeses. This bacterium is also able to utilize the stereoisomers L-lactate and D-lactate, but not
citrate, presumably as a result of a mutation in the gene
cluster encoding the two-component system CitAB necessary for activating the expression of the cognate citrate
import system [110].
C. variabile is also equipped with an extensive set of
enzymes participating in b-oxidation or the degradation of
lipids and with enzymes involved in proteolysis. Cheese
has a high content of lipids and triacylglycerides [1] that
are probably made available for the metabolism of C. variabile by the enzymatic actions of secreted lipases and
esterases. Likewise, caseins are the major protein sources
in milk and cheese [1] and are thus prominent substrates

Schröder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:545
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/545

for proteolysis by C. variabile, presumably carried out by
secreted proteases. Moreover, proline iminopeptidase can
contribute to proteolysis [122], as prolines are the major
amino acid constituents of caseins [1]. It is obvious that
these metabolic specificities of C. variabile are closely
linked to its niche adaption. Another specific feature of
C. variabile is its high salt tolerance [4]. The bodies of
smear-ripened cheeses are brined with salt solutions prior
to the start of the ripening period to control microbial
growth and to extend shelf-life [94]. The efficient accumulation of osmoprotectants by C. variabile may contribute
to its salt tolerance, as a large number of genes accounting
for the accumulation of compatible solutes were detected
in the genome sequence.
Moreover, the C. variabile genome is well equipped with
genes involved in iron acquisition, presumably as a result
of adaptation to the iron-depleted cheese habitat. At least
one complete siderophore biosynthesis cluster was identified in this species, which shows similarity to gene clusters
involved in the synthesis of catechol siderophores in
B. subtilis [143] and E. coli [144]. The biosynthesis of siderophores was also observed in cheese-related strains of
B. linens and A. arilaitensis that are frequently found on
the surface of smear-ripened cheeses [110,156]. Moreover,
about 50 additional genes were assigned to iron-siderophore and ferric iron uptake components, which have few
orthologs in other corynebacteria, indicating that the
acquisition of iron is a key factor for growth of C. variabile
on the surface of smear-ripened cheeses. It would be interesting to investigate whether C. variable is able to use
siderophores produced by other species sharing its habitat,
as it has been assumed for A. arilaitensis [110].
In principle, flavor compounds in cheese can derive from
pathways of lipolysis or proteolysis and the metabolism of
lactate and citrate [87]. Volatile sulphur compounds, such
as methanethiol, are particularly important in the flavor of
smear-ripened cheeses and produced by the bacterial
microflora [94]. There is experimental evidence that C. variabile produces methanethiol [4], although no methionineg-lyase encoding gene (mgl) was detectable in this study.
Another flavor compound produced by C. variabile from
pyruvate is acetoin, which is also generated by lactococci in
fresh unripened cheese and can be reduced to 2, 3-butanediol by the action of the enzyme acetoin reductase [157].
The corresponding butA gene was detected in the C. variabile genome, indicating that the synthesis of 2, 3-butanediol
might contribute to flavor generation of smear-ripened
cheeses. Moreover, lipolysis plays an important role in the
formation of cheese flavor in several cheese varieties, such
as Swiss cheese [158], Hispánico cheese [159], Domiati
cheese [160], and smear-ripened cheeses [87]. The quantification of the production of flavour compounds from fat
during cheese ripening by the action of lipases and
esterases indicated that lipolysis can reach up 20% in

Page 18 of 23

mould-ripened cheeses, such as Camembert [111]. Due to
the presence of several lipases and esterases encoded by C.
variabile, it is likely that this species may also contribute to
cheese flavor by producing free fatty acids from lipids and
triacylglycerides and by generating volatile compounds
with low olfactory threshold values in cheese flavor
perception.
Furthermore, the detected regulatory pattern for relevant metabolic pathways led to the conclusion that almost
all major processes occuring in C. variabile are regulated
in a hierarchical manner. We identified local regulators,
whose corresponding genes are clustered with their proposed target genes, for instance the tauR gene that is
located adjacent to the tauDCBA cluster involved in
uptake and assimilation of taurine, gabR genes located
upstream of gabT(D)P genes responsible for GABA utilization, as well as siuR and fiuR genes that are embedded in
iron-siderophore and ferric iron uptake gene clusters and
are all encoding members of the AraC family of transcription regulators. In addition, DNA-binding sites of master
regulators known from C. glutamicum were detected in
the C. variabile genome sequence. McbR binding sites, for
instance, indicate the connection of the tauABCD genes to
the sulphur regulon of C. variabile, whereas DtxR binding
sites within the siu and fiu gene clusters indicate the integration of the respective genes into an iron-dependent
gene-regulatory network. The presence of GlxR binding
sites support the view of a hierarchical regulation of several prominent aspects of the C. variabile metabolism,
including the utilization of g-amino butyric acid, lipolysis,
and b-oxidation.

Conclusions
The annotation of the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome in
conjunction with comparative analysis provides evidence
that a strong selective pressure exists on the surface of
smear-ripened cheeses, concerning the ability to catabolize
substrates, such as g-amino butyric acid, lactate, lipids, and
amino acids (mainly proline), and the presence of efficient
iron acquisition and salt-tolerance systems. Our analysis of
the genome data revealed that C. variabile is strongly
adapted to this habitat and contributes to the main aspects
of cheese quality, such as flavor formation. Future studies
will certainly benefit from the comprehensive genomic
information on C. variabile by integrating this knowledge
into models describing the complex cheese ecosystem,
which is composed of various bacterial species and yeasts
and their microbial interactions.
Methods
Bacterial strain and growth conditions

C. variabile DSM 44702 (CIP 107183; JCM 12073; LMG
S-19265; NCIMB 30131) was originally isolated from the
surface of an Irish farmhouse smear-ripened cheese [4].

Schröder et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:545
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/545

The strain used in this study was obtained as a lyophilized culture from the German Culture Collection
DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). C. variabile DSM
44702 was formerly described as the type strain of the
species C. mooreparkense, which turned out to be a later
heterotypic synonym for C. variabile [4,20]. C. variabile
DSM 44702 was routinely cultivated in BYT complex
medium [161] at 30°C.
Sequencing of the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome

Genomic DNA was purified from C. variabile cells by an
alkaline lysis procedure [162], using 20-ml aliquots of an
overnight culture grown in liquid BYT complex medium
that was supplemented with 1.25% (w/v) glycine. The alkaline lysis protocol applied in this study includes two minor
modifications: (i) The C. variabile cells were incubated in
a 30 mg/ml lysozyme solution at 37°C for 1 h. (ii) The harvested C. variabile cells were lysed in 0.7 ml 10% (w/v)
SDS solution at 37°C for 15 min. A total amount of 5 μg
of purified genomic DNA was used for constructing a single-stranded template DNA library. The DNA concentration of the library was measured by using the Agilent
RNA 6000 Nano Kit. The preparation and sequencing of
the DNA library were performed according to standard
protocols from Roche Applied Science. Pyrosequencing of
the genomic DNA sample was carried out with the Genome Sequencer FLX System and Titanium chemistry
(Roche Applied Science). The sequence reads were
assembled with the GS Assembler Software (version 2.3).
Gap closure of the C. variabile DSM 44702 genome

The gap closure was supported by the related reference
contig arrangement tool r2cat, using the complete C. jeikeium K411 genome sequence as a reference [21]. The
remaining gaps in the genome sequence of C. variabile
were closed by PCR with Phusion hot start high-fidelity
DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and genomic template
DNA. All primers used in this study were synthesized by
Metabion. The PCR assays were carried out with a TProfessional PCR thermocylcer (Biometra) according to standard protocols (Finnzymes). Amplified DNA fragments
linking individual contigs were sequenced by IIT Biotech.
All DNA sequences were uploaded into the Consed program [22] and manually inspected to generate the complete
genome sequence of C. variabile DSM 44702.
Annotation and bioinformatic analysis of the C. variabile
DSM 44702 genome

The assembled genome sequence of C. variabile was
uploaded into the bacterial genome annotation system
GenDB [23]. The annotation of the C. variabile genome
sequence was performed as described previously [34], followed by manual curation. A combined gene prediction
strategy was executed by using GLIMMER 2.1 and the

Page 19 of 23

CRITICA program suite [163] in conjuction with postprocessing by the RBSfinder tool [164]. Additional regional information on protein-coding regions was obtained
with REGANOR [165] and integrated into the final genome annotation. The deduced proteins of C. variabile
were functionally characterized by automated searches in
public databases according to default search parameters
of the GenDB system [23]. The origin of chromosomal
replication of C. variabile was predicted with the web
version of the Ori-Finder [25]. The genome plot of
C. variabile was generated with the DNAPlotter tool
[166]. Comparative analyses of the predicted gene content and reconstructions of metabolic properties of
C. variabile were accomplished by the computer programs EDGAR [30] and CARMEN [167]. The software
tool CARMEN supports the in silico reconstruction and
visualization of automatically derived metabolic networks
based on pathway information from the KEGG database
and user-defined SBML templates. The visualization and
manual curation of pathway maps was performed with
the CellDesigner software (version 3.2) [168]. The synteny between the genomes of C. variabile DSM 44702
and C. jeikeium K411 was calculated with reciprocal best
BLASTP matches by the EDGAR software [30]. The
detection and classification of the transcriptional regulatory repertoire of C. variabile was performed as described
previously [76]. The DNA motif discovery for regulon
predictions followed a combined workflow, using both
position weight matrices and hidden Markov models
[96]. The transcriptional regulatory network transfer
between corynebacteria on the genome-scale was
described in detail previously [82].
The annotated genome sequence of C. variabile DSM
44702 has been deposited in the GenBank database with
accession number CP002917 and is also available from
the RefSeq database with accession number NC_015859.
