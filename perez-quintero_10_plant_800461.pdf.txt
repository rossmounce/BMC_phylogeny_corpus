Plant microRNAs and their role in defense against
viruses: a bioinformatics approach

Abstract
Background: microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding short RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes by
translational inhibition or cleavage of complementary mRNAs. In plants, miRNAs are known to target mostly
transcription factors and are implicated in diverse aspects of plant growth and development. A role has been
suggested for the miRNA pathway in antiviral defense in plants. In this work, a bioinformatics approach was taken to
test whether plant miRNAs from six species could have antiviral activity by targeting the genomes of plant infecting
viruses.
Results: All plants showed a repertoire of miRNAs with potential for targeting viral genomes. The viruses were targeted
by abundant and conserved miRNA families in regions coding for cylindrical inclusion proteins, capsid proteins, and
nuclear inclusion body proteins. The parameters for our predicted miRNA:target pairings in the viral genomes were
similar to those for validated targets in the plant genomes, indicating that our predicted pairings might behave in-vivo
as natural miRNa-target pairings. Our screening was compared with negative controls comprising randomly generated
miRNAs, animal miRNAs, and genomes of animal-infecting viruses. We found that plant miRNAs target plant viruses
more efficiently than any other sequences, but also, miRNAs can either preferentially target plant-infecting viruses or
target any virus without preference.
Conclusions: Our results show a strong potential for antiviral activity of plant miRNAs and suggest that the miRNA
pathway may be a support mechanism to the siRNA pathway in antiviral defense.
Background
RNA silencing is a conserved defense mechanism that
plants and other eukaryotes use to protect their genomes
against aberrant nucleic acids. This process uses short
RNAs (20-30 nt) to recognize and manipulate complementary nucleic acids [1,2]. At least five classes of these
small regulatory RNAs have been characterized, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interference RNAs (siRNAs), transacting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs), natural antisense
siRNAs (nat-siRNAs) and, in metazoans, the Piwi-interacting RNAs [3,4]. miRNAs and siRNAs are chemically
indistinguishable and participate in partially overlapping
pathways; both are derived from double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) and are then processed into 21-22 nt single
stranded molecules by Dicer or a Dicer-like enzyme; later,
they are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing

complex (RISC) to guide the cleavage or translational
repression of the complementary strand [1,5]. The main
differences between miRNAs and siRNAs lie in their biogenesis and in their target molecules. siRNAs are generally derived from endogenous aberrant dsRNAs or from
exogenous agents such as viruses, and silence the same
molecule from which they originated. miRNAs, instead,
originate from nuclear genes and act in trans, silencing
mRNAs from other genes [6,7].
In plants miRNAs were described first in Arabidopsis
[8,9], and later in other species. To date, there over 2200
plant miRNAs from over 30 species available at the miRBase [10]. Most of these miRNAs target transcription factors and thus are implicated in diverse aspects of plant
growth and development [11,12].
In addition to regulate the endogenous expression of
some genes, miRNAs could have a direct role in viral
defense. This has been shown for various cases in animalinfecting viruses. For example miR-32 restricts the repli-

cation of the primate foamy virus type 1, miR-122 targets
the hepatitis C virus and at least four miRNAs expressed
in T-cells impair HIV replication [2,13-15]. Also an
important role for miRNAs in antiviral defense in
humans has been suggested through bioinformatics [16].
Likewise, animal-infecting viruses can encode miRNAs
to regulate both the viral life cycle and the interaction
between viruses and their hosts [17,18].
Whereas siRNAs are known to play an important and
direct role in antiviral defense in plants [19,20], so far,
there has not been proof of naturally occurring plant
microRNAs with antiviral activity. It has been shown,
using genetically modified viruses and plants, that complementarity between a plant miRNA and a virus genome
is enough for antiviral activity. Transgenic tobacco and
Arabidopsis plants displayed resistance against Cucumber
mosaic virus (CMV), Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV)
and Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) when expressing artificial miRNAS directed against regions in the viruses'
genomes [21-23]. Also, inserting the target sequence of
host plant's miRNAs in the virus genome can impair virus
infectivity; however, the virus can escape rapidly of the
miRNA action by mutations [24].
It has been suggested that virtually any endogenous
small RNA could hold an intrinsic, albeit fortuitous, antiviral potential (by random complementarity) that is independent of its cellular function [15,24-26]. Also, several
sequences of 20-25 nt located within Arabidopsis intergenic regions share perfect or near perfect complementarity with a variety of plant virus genomes, but have not
been validated as miRNAs yet [27]. There are also a large
number of non-conserved RNAs with unknown targets
("orphan" miRNAs) that could have an antiviral role and

constitute a reservoir of defensive molecules due to their
complementarity to invading viral genomes [25].
In this work, we present a bioinformatics approach to
explore the possibility of endogenous plant miRNAs having a role in antiviral defense by targeting the genomes of
plant-infecting viruses and the results are considered in
the context of the evolution of plant-virus interactions.

Results
The set of plant miRNAs (n = 911) from six plants was
screened for targets against a set of genomes of plant
infecting viruses (n = 119) resulting in several putative
targets (any miRNA-target pair predicted by miRanda is
considered a hit). The plant with most hits was O. sativa
with 165, which was expected since most of the miRNAs
in the dataset belong to this species (353). The matching
percentage, which relates the number of hits to the sample size (miRNAs × viruses genomes), was similar for all
species, around 0.2%. The plant with the highest matching percentage (0.2813%) was Z. mays, and the lowest was
A. thaliana (0.1579%). Overall out of the 911 plant miRNAs used in the screenings, 267 (28%) had targets in the
genomes of plant viruses; we name these "positive miRNAs". The percentage of positive miRNAs was different
for each plant, being lowest (22%) in A. thaliana and
highest (43%) in Z. mays. The percentage of "positive
viruses" (viruses that were targeted by at least one
miRNA) was lowest for S. bicolor (34%) and highest for A.
thaliana (80%) (Table 1). Thus every plant has a different
repertoire of miRNAs with a potential capacity of targeting viruses.
In total, 51 of the 74 (69%) viruses screened were "positive viruses", thus not all plant-infecting viruses can be

targeted by their host's miRNAs. Some viruses were
highly targeted by plant miRNAs. For example, the Barley
Yellow Mosaic Virus, to which both O.sativa and Z.mays
are unsusceptible, displayed the highest number of
miRNA targets (Figure 1) [28].
miRNAs can be grouped according to sequence similarity in families. In total 233 miRNA families were
screened against the viral genomes and 74 families (32%)
resulted in positive targets. Families that are relatively
well conserved across the plant kingdom and have multiple copies in the genome were particularly successful in
producing hits; this may be a consequence of this families
being overrepresented in every screening (Figure 2). Families 156, 395, 159, 166, 160 which are present in at least
five of the six plant species and are encoded by at least

Page 3 of 12

two loci in each plant genome were among the ones with
more potential targets. Some families with unknown or
non-validated targets (i.e. 495, 414, 815, 818, 854, 529,
and 1861) also produced multiple, yet fewer, hits in the
viruses' genomes. These results suggest that abundant
and conserved plant miRNA families potentially target
viruses.
To validate our hypotheses that plant-infecting viruses
are more likely to be targeted by plant miRNAs than by
other sequences and that plant miRNAs preferentially
target plant-infecting viruses over other sequences, we
conducted the following analyses. We created a group of
negative controls to screen for miRNA targets in the following cases i) animal miRNAs vs plant virus genomes,
ii) random generated miRNAs vs plant virus genomes, iii)

randomized plant miRNAs vs plant virus genomes and iv)
plant miRNAs vs animal virus genomes. As a positive
control we screened the set of plant miRNAs against their
validated target sequences.
The screenings were compared using four miRanda
parameters: the free-folding energy of the miRNA:target
pair, the identity, the Z-score and the miRANDA score.
All putative targets in each screening had high identity
percentage (min 58%), high Z-score (min 6.8) and highly
negative free-folding energy (maximum -23 kcal/mol)
(Table 2). No statistically significant differences were
found between the different screenings for these three
parameters, indicating that all the alignments found are
very similar and therefore comparable. Since there are no
differences between the positive control screening and all
the others, we can conclude that our positive miRNAs are
pairing with their targets as well as some plant miRNAs
pair with their known and validated targets in the plant
genomes.
The miRanda score of the positive control was significantly higher than the score of the plant miRNA vs plant
viruses screening, while the miRanda score for three of
the four negative controls was significantly lower. However, all miRANDA scores are above the threshold of

what is considered necessary for biological activity. We
should also take into account that this parameter gives a
high weight to pairing in the 5'region of the miRNA
which is not as crucial for plant miRNAs activity as for
animal miRNAs (Table 2) [29].
Next, our screening was compared with the negative
controls using the matching percentage. To discard errors
due to sample size effect, various data subsets with different sample sizes of miRNAs and viral genomes were randomly generated, screened again and then averaged
(Table 3). The matching percentages for plants miRNAs
to plant viruses were significantly higher than to animal
miRNAs and the two types of random miRNAs. This
indicates that the plant viruses might be preferentially
targeted by plant miRNAs than by other sequences. On
the other hand, comparisons of the matching percentages
for plant miRNAs to plant and animal viral genomes did
not show a clear trend (Table 3). For example, the miRNAs of V. vinifera seem to preferentially target plant
viruses than animal viruses (Figure 3A) while the opposite was the case for A. thaliana, S. bicolor and Z. mays
(Figure 3B). And, the miRNAs from O. sativa and G. max
showed similar preference for the genomes of both plant
and animal viruses (Figure 3C). No clear conclusion can

plant viruses.
The genomes of plant viruses were targeted in multiple
regions by several plant miRNAs. The most targeted
regions were those coding for RNA polymerases, cylindrical inclusion (CI) proteins, capsid proteins and nuclear
inclusion body (Nib) proteins (Figure 4A). Silencing in

any of these regions is likely to impair virus replication.
Plant miRNAs also target most frequently the RNA polymerase genes in animal viruses (Figure 4B). However,
there is a stronger preference to target coding sequences
in plant viruses than in animal viruses. Therefore, plant
miRNAs seem to be more directed to impair the fitness of
plant viruses.

Discussion
Using a bioinformatics approach we found that plant
miRNAs potentially target genomic regions in plantinfecting viruses. To validate our results we carried out
several positive and negative controls and these showed
that the genomes of plant viruses are preferentially targeted by their host's miRNAs but were not conclusive
regarding the specificity of plant miRNAs for the
genomes of plant viruses. A similar trend has been found
using a bioinformatics approach with animal miRNAs vs
animal viruses [16], where the miRNA pathway has been
proved to have antiviral role in Metazoans [2,13-15]. This
suggests that our predicted pairings could also have a biological function, although an experimental biological vali-

dation is necessary. It is possible that some of the viral
targets found in this study are the result of purely fortuitous matches as has been suggested by various authors
[15,26,27,30]. Even if these pairings are the result of
chance instead of selection, it is possible that given the
right physiological circumstances (e.g. high expression of
the miRNAs, lack of silencing suppressor in the virus)
these miRNAs would efficiently silence the predicted targets. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing
that artificial miRNAs can mediate antiviral defense in
plants and that complementarity with the target is
enough to produce resistance [21-24]. Also, plants defective in miRNA-silencing have shown to be more susceptible to some viruses [31].

It was reported that human miRNAs were more likely
to target the genomes of human-infecting viruses over
non-host's viruses [16]. Such specificity could not be
demonstrated for plant miRNAs in the present study.
However, a large amount of the targets we found for plant
miRNAs in the genomes of animal viruses are in noncoding regions and are therefore unlikely to impair viral
activity (Figure 4). Additionally, some predicted targets of
plant miRNAs were found both in plant and animal
viruses (e.g. capsid genes) which may indicate a preference to target conserved regions in viruses. Finally, it is
possible that the genomes of plant-infecting viruses are
undergoing rapid evolution to avoid targeting by plant

miRNAs, therefore giving lower matching percentages
than expected. This is plausible since it has been shown
that viruses can rapidly evolve to escape miRNA targeting
in plants [24].
To identify possible plant miRNAs in the viruses
genomes we used strict parameters based on experimentally valid miRNA:target pairings to ensure potential biological activity. Even considering the inherent difficulties
of the computational prediction of miRNA targets, which
often results large number of false positive targets [32], it
is possible that our conservative approach has underestimated the number of candidate targets. Increasing evidence has shown that miRNA-mediated silencing in

plants can occur in relaxed miRNA:target pairings,
mainly leading to translational arrest instead of mRNA
cleavage, although the mechanisms are not fully understood [17,33-36]. Once the criteria for miRNA-mediated
translational arrest in plants are fully understood, new
approaches searching for plant miRNA targets in viral
genomes may be necessary.
We found that miRNAs from deeply conserved and
highly expressed families (e. g. families 156, 395, 159, 166,
160) have more potential targets in the viruses' genomes.
This could suggest a way in which abundant plant miRNAs are selected to have multiplicity of functions including pathogen defense. This is supported by the fact that
these families have multiple targets within the plant
genomes [33], and some of them have been shown to be
differentially expressed in response to stresses. For example, miRNAs 395 and 399 are responsive to abiotic stress
(phosphorus and sulfates starvation) [37,38], and miRNAs 156, 159 and 160 are responsive to viral infections
[39-42].
By contrast, the more phylogenetically restricted families (e.g. families 495, 414, 818, 854, 1861), may be participating in more specific plant-virus interactions. Indeed,
in some plants there is a large diversity of non-conserved
and "young" miRNAs with still unknown targets that
could be potentially employed against viral sequences
[43,44]. The lack of potential antiviral activity for some
microRNA families could also be the result of them being
expressed at very low levels or in a tissue or cell-specific
manner, thus being less likely to play a significant role in
antiviral defense.
It is also important to consider some arguments that do
not support a putative function of plant miRNAs as an
effective option for antiviral defense. First, most viruses
encode for silencing repressors, which could directly
interfere with the miRNA machinery [27,45,46]. Second,
viral genomes evolve much faster than host miRNAs
[11,24]. Third, the miRNA signal is neither systemic nor
quickly amplified [26]. Nevertheless, using miRNAs to
protect against virus might be an advantageous preemptive measure (a plant would be resistant to viruses that
has never encountered before) benefitting of their ability
to pair with multiple targets [26].
The apparent inadequacy of miRNAs as an antiviral
defense mechanism may indicate that their role is not as
direct as siRNAs. On one side miRNAs may simply act as
a support mechanism for siRNAs. On the other side, the
targets found here may be a reflection of a virus adaptation phenomenon in which they take advantage of the
host miRNAs to suppress their own replication to evade
immune elimination and establish in this way a persistent
infection as has been suggested by Mahajan et al., [47]. In
this case the role of miRNAs would be to reach an equilibrated host-virus interaction [47].

Page 9 of 12

Also, these results can be discussed in the context of
the hypothesis proposed by Lu et al., [26], which states
that early in plant evolution miRNAs played an important
role in anti-viral defense and then novel functions
evolved after the requirements of survival were satisfied
[26,33]. At this initial time, plant miRNAs may have been
crucial for shaping the host ranges of several virus
groups. Then, some of these "antiviral miRNAs" might
have been selected to regulate endogenous genes after
fortuitous matching. Both the rapid evolution of viruses
and the necessity of precise gene regulation could have
worked as selective pressures towards the modern
miRNA pathway since the requirement for a high degree
of complementarity between plant miRNAs and their targets can act as a stabilizer, preventing sequence drift even
over long periods of evolutionary time [43]. Many miRNAs might have been originated from invading viral
sequences, a pathway for miRNA evolution that has been
suggested previously for plants [48]. Additionally, bioinformatics evidence suggests a transition from viral
sequence to siRNA to miRNA gene in plants [49]. Our
candidate targets may be an indication of these virusderived miRNAs, especially those found for phylogenetically restricted miRNA families with unknown genomic
targets.

Conclusions
Our work presents initial evidence for the suspected
potential of antiviral activity mediated by plant miRNAs,
which is likely to have played a role in early plant evolution and in shaping host ranges for plant infecting
viruses.
Methods
Dataset

miRNA sequences from six plants (Arabidopsis thaliana,
Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Vitis vinifera, and Zea mays) were downloaded from the miRBASE [10]. These species were selected for having at least
60 available sequenced miRNAs as late as March 2009,
and for being hosts of at least 10 plant-infecting viruses
with fully sequenced genomes. For comparisons, miRNAs from eight Metazoan species (Coenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Dario rerio, Gallus gallus,
Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus,
and Pan troglodytes) were selected and 50 miRNAs
sequences for each animal were also downloaded from
the miRBASE [10].
Complete genome sequences for plant and animalinfecting viruses were obtained from Genbank [50]. Host
ranges and related information for plant viruses were
consulted using the Description of Plant Virus Database,
DPVWeb [51] and the Plant virus Database, VIDE [52].
For animal-infecting viruses we used the International

[53], and another one by randomizing the plant miRNA
sequences with the Bioedit software [54], doing 1000 random swap operations.
Information for verified targets of plant miRNAs were
obtained from Tarbase [55], the Arabidopsis thaliana
small RNA project [56], the Arabidospsis MPSS Database
[57], the Plant microRNA Database [58], or primary literature [11,59,60]. The corresponding sequences were
downloaded from Genbank [50].
Target prediction

Targets for each set of miRNAs were searched in viral
genomes using a modified version of miRanda (v September 2008) [29]. This software uses a scoring system based
on the complementarities of nucleotides, similar to the
Smith-Waterman algorithm. The scoring matrix used for
this analysis also allows G = U 'wobble' pairs, which are
important for the accurate detection of RNA:RNA
duplexes. The algorithm uses folding routines from the
Vienna 1.3 RNA secondary structure programming
library [61]. Although miRanda was originally designed
to search for miRNA targets in animals, it is versatile
enough to be modified and has been used to search for
targets in viruses and plants, and has proven to be an efficient method [30,62]. The miRanda screenings were
repeated several times using randomly generated subsets
of either the miRNA or the viral genome sets.
MiRanda screenings were made using different combinations of miRNAs and viral genomes. The main one was
plant miRNAs against plant viruses' genomes. This was
compared with four other control screenings: (i) animal
miRNAs vs plant viruses, (ii) random 21 nt sequences
(Rand1) vs plant viruses (iii) randomized plant miRNAs
(Rand2) vs plant viruses and (iv) plant miRNAs vs animal-infecting viruses. As a positive control, the plant
miRNAs were screened against 190 sequences corresponding to verified miRNA targets in the plant genomes.
The criteria to consider a sequence as a putative
miRNA target were: four or fewer mismatches overall,
only one or none mismatches in the 5' region of the
miRNA (positions 1 to 12), no more than two consecutives mismatches in positions 13 to 21, no mismatches in
positions 10 and 11. Additionally, the miRNA:target pair
should have low free-energy of bonding (maximum -20
kcal/mol). These criteria are based on experimental work
and have been extensively used for miRNA target prediction in various plants [23,63,64].
Four miRanda parameters obtained in the different
screenings were used to compare and validate the predicted targets. These parameters were: a) the free-folding

energy of the miRNA:target pair, which is commonly
used as a measure for miRNA target prediction and indicates the stability of the miRNA:target duplex and the
likeliness of correct matching and cleavage; b) the percentage identity, which indicates how many bases are
complementary between the miRNAs and the target; c)
the Z-score, which is based on a distribution of the shuffled alignment score; a high Z-score means that the alignment is least likely to be the result of chance; and d) the
miRanda score, which weights all the others parameters
and also each base pair in the alignment based on complementarity and position; it represents a measure of the
number of mismatches and their distribution (mismatches in the 5' end of the target are given a higher
penalization) [29].
Statistical analyses

The main variable used to compare the screenings was
the matching percentage = [Number of candidates/(Size
of the virus' genome (kb) × Number of miRNAs)] × 100,
which is the percentage of the screened sample that
resulted in target candidates. For statistical analysis, the
Shapiro Normality test and Wilcoxon tests were performed with the software R [65].
To compare the targeted regions in the viral genomes,
the number of hits in each region was divided by the average size in kilobases of this region in the various viruses'
genomes.
