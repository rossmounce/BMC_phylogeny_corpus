Abstract
Background: Red-flesh fruit is absent from common sweet orange varieties, but is more preferred by consumers due
to its visual attraction and nutritional properties. Our previous researches on a spontaneous red-flesh mutant revealed
that the trait is caused by lycopene accumulation and is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
mechanisms. However, the knowledge on post-transcriptional regulation of lycopene accumulation in fruits is rather
limited so far.
Results: We used Illumina sequencing method to identify and quantitatively profile small RNAs on the red-flesh sweet
orange mutant and its wild type. We identified 85 known miRNAs belonging to 48 families from sweet orange.
Comparative profiling revealed that 51 known miRNAs exhibited significant expression differences between mutant
(MT) and wild type (WT). We also identified 12 novel miRNAs by the presence of mature miRNAs and corresponding
miRNA*s in the sRNA libraries. Comparative analysis showed that 9 novel miRNAs are differentially expressed between
WT and MT. Target predictions of the 60 differential miRNAs resulted 418 target genes in sweet orange. GO and KEGG
annotation revealed that high ranked miRNA-target genes are those implicated in transcription regulation, protein
modification and photosynthesis. The expression profiles of target genes involved in carotenogenesis and
photosynthesis were further confirmed to be complementary to the profiles of corresponding miRNAs in WT and MT.
Conclusion: This study comparatively characterized the miRNAomes between the red-flesh mutant and the wild type,
the results lay a foundation for unraveling the miRNA-mediated molecular processes that regulate lycopene
accumulation in the sweet orange red-flesh mutant.
Background
Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis [L.] Osbeck), one of the
most important fruit crops worldwide, is responsible for
75% of citrus production used both as fresh fruit and processed juice [1]. Orange fruit is believed to contain many
phytochemicals which are beneficial to human health [2].
Carotenoids are a group of the health-promoting products which may serve as antioxidants, vitamin A precursors, and cancer-preventing effectors [3]. Orange fruit is
reported with more than 115 species of carotenoids [4],
but lycopene are absent from common varieties [5-7].

Interest in lycopene metabolism and regulation is growing rapidly because a variety of epidemiological trials
have suggested that higher intake of lycopene-containing
fruits or foods are associated with decreased cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer risks [8]. So far, three
sweet orange mutants with lycopene accumulation in the
fruits were reported: Shara [9], Cara Cara [10] and the
recently reported 'Hong Anliu' [11]. 'Hong Anliu' is a
spontaneous bud mutant from its wild type 'Anliu' sweet
orange. We found that lycopene in the 'Hong Anliu'
mutant was 1000-fold higher than that in its wild type
fruits, and in juice sacs the lycopene accumulation was
coincided with increased expression of upstream carotenogenic genes and reduced expression of downstream
genes [11]. Thereafter, transcriptional study including
cDNA microarray in combination with suppression subtraction hybridization (SSH) was used to investigate gene

expression changes in the mutant, and a total of 267 differentially expressed genes were detected [12]. More
recently, massively parallel signature sequencing was
applied to decipher the transcriptome changes between
WT and MT; and the results indicated that partial
impairment of lycopene downstream flux are critical for
the formation of lycopene accumulation trait in the
mutant [13]. Meanwhile, comparative proteomic analyses
were performed between the mutant and its wild type.
And the proteomic data, when considered in combination with transcriptional data, suggest that post-transcriptional regulations are involved in shaping the redflesh trait of the orange mutant [14]. However, it remains
largely unknown what kind of post-transcriptional mechanism was involved in the red-flesh mutant. So far, one
interesting case has been reported in Arabidopsis where
miRNA was proposed to regulate the expression of
APETALA2 transcription factor (designated as RAP2.2)
in controlling a key carotenoids biosynthesis gene (phytoene synthase gene) [15]. But to date, very little is known
about miRNAs or miRNA-mediated molecular processes
that regulate lycopene accumulation in plant fruits.
Small RNAs (sRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of biological processes on post-transcriptional level
in most eukaryotes [16,17]. In plants, sRNAs are involved
in a variety of activities that are essential for genome stability, development, and adaptive responses to biotic and
abiotic stresses [16-21]. There is still increasing data for
the implication of sRNAs in the regulation of other biological processes [22-24].
Based on difference of biogenesis and action, sRNAs
have been mainly grouped into two categories,
microRNA (miRNA) and short interfering RNA (siRNA)
[21]. miRNAs distinguish from siRNAs by their biogenesis. miRNAs are cleaved from stem-loop precursor molecules that derive from single-stranded RNAs, while
siRNAs are generated from double-strand RNA precursors [25]. In plants, miRNA regulates gene expression
mostly on post-transcription level [17]. The majority of
the miRNAs initially isolated from model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was found to be evolutionarily conserved
across plant species [26]. Later, many researches suggested that the miRNA repertoire of plant species comprises a set of non-conserved miRNAs besides the
conserved ones [27-29]. To date, 1894 miRNA sequences
have been identified from 24 plant species, as revealed
from miRNA registry database (miRBase v13.0; http://
microrna.sanger.ac.uk). However, no citrus miRNAs have
been found in this database so far.
Plant miRNAs have been identified mostly by two strategies: traditional Sanger sequencing of the small RNA
libraries as for Arabidopsis [19,26], rice [30,31], and poplar [20]; and computational prediction of conserved miRNAs by searching for homologous sequences using EST

Page 2 of 17

or genomic sequences [18,32-36]. However, the computation-based approach is mostly limited to the discovery of
conserved miRNAs; and the small-scale traditional
sequencing approach identified mainly conserved miRNAs, as suggested by Morin et al. [37] and Moxon et al.
[23]. Recently developed high-throughput sequencing
technology has allowed the discovery of several non-conserved or lowly expressed miRNAs as well as quantification of the expression of miRNAs. This strategy has been
successfully applied to both model plants [28,38-44], and
non-model plants [23,37,45-50].
The criteria for miRNAs characterization and annotation in plants have been advanced since plants have relatively large and complex sRNA populations within which
miRNAs are often a minority [51]. The minimum criteria
include biogenesis criterion that miRNA precursors can
be folded into stem-loop structure, and expression criterion that mature miRNAs should be detected by northern
blotting, qRT-PCR or sequencing [52]. Proof of biogenesis requires data of the cloning or detection of miRNA*
sequences, which is complementary to miRNA sequences
in the precursor molecule [29,51]. Expression detection
can also be done by recently developed qRT-PCR-based
methods [53,54], where each miRNA is reverse-transcribed from total RNA using a specific stem-loop
primer, followed by PCR amplification and detection.
This method is believed to be a powerful alternative for
sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective detection of miRNA
[24,55]. Target prediction can be an ancillary criterion for
miRNA annotation. Sequence complementarity between
miRNAs and their target genes is very high in plants,
which has made the search for plant miRNA target genes
a straightforward process [18]. A number of prediction
algorithms are available publicly for plant miRNA target
prediction, such as miRU [56], WMD3 [57], and UEA
plant sRNA toolkit [58].
Here we described the deep sequencing of sRNAs from
a red-flesh sweet orange mutant and its wild type. Comparative profiling of the sRNA transcriptome between
wild type and mutant revealed a set of 51 known and 9
novel miRNAs showing significant expression changes.
The annotation of the potential targets of differential
miRNAs indicated that high ranked genes are that implicated in biological processes including carotenoid biosynthesis, transcription regulation, and photosynthesis.

Results
Sequencing and annotation of sweet orange small RNAs

Our previous studies showed that the stage of 170 days
after flowering (DAF) is the critical stage for the phenotype of color break and global gene expression changes
during fruit development in the mutant (Figure 1) [11,13].
In this study, sRNA libraries were generated from fruit
pulps of 'Anliu' sweet orange (wild type, WT) and its red-

MT, i.e. the majority of sRNAs (approximately 95%) were
21-24 nt in length with 24-nt sRNA as the major peak.
The unique sRNAs were further classified into different
RNA categories (Table 1). Analysis showed that 10.8%
(WT) and 9.9% (MT) of the unique sRNAs matched the
Citrus sinensis unigenes (dataset from TIGR, the institute
for genomic research). Detailed information was shown
in Additional file 1 and 2. Further analysis using the
sRNA sequences searching against Rfam database
revealed that 1.7%, and 1.5% of the sequences for WT and
MT, respectively, matched noncoding RNAs including
rRNA, tRNA, snRNA and snoRNAs (Additional file 3 and
4). Searching the remaining sRNAs from WT and MT
against miRBase v13.0 identified 0.4% and 0.3% of the
unique sequences matched known miRNAs, which
account 3.7% and 3.1% of the total sRNAs, respectively
(Table 1).
Known miRNAs

flesh mutant (MT) 'Hong Anliu' at 170 DAF stage. Deep
sequencing of small RNA libraries yielded 4,987,484 and
7,163,041 unfiltered sequence reads for WT and MT,
respectively. The raw sRNA data were submitted to Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession no.
GSE18207. After discarding low quality sequences containing ambiguous nucleotides, sequences shorter than
18 nucleotides, and sequences counts below 3 in both
libraries, 1,790,395 (WT) and 3,345,746 (MT) reliable
sequences were remained for analysis. These sequences
represented 202,965 and 320,443 unique sRNA
sequences in WT and MT, respectively. The distribution
of unique sRNA length is summarized in Figure 2. The
overall distribution pattern was similar between WT and

Figure 2 Length distribution of sweet orange small RNA.

We identified 85 miRNAs, belonging to 48 familes, in
sweet orange by BLAST against the miRBase v13.0 using
our combined (WT and MT) sRNA sequences (Additional file 5). The potential conserved miRNAs were used
for BLASTN against sweet orange unigene dataset to
search precursor sequences (Detail in Methods). Since
the orange genome is largely unknown, we used orange
unigene dataset (from TIGR, the institute for genomic
research) and 1.2Ã coverage sequence of sweet orange
(from NCBI) to predict RNA secondary structures. The
sequences of perfect match with sRNA sequences were
used for fold-back structure prediction by Mfold program
[59]. The miRNA-containing fold-back structures were
shown in Additional file 6.
To compare the miRNA abundance in different libraries, the count of each miRNA was normalized to transcripts per million (TPM). In the WT sRNA library,
miR168, miR172 and miR156 were the most overrepresented families, with the abundance at 8,927, 4,754 and
3,566 TPM, respectively. These three miRNA families
also frequently represented in MT sRNA library, but the
difference is that the miR172 abundance ranked third
(3,330 TPM) after miR156 (4,397 TPM) and miR168
(8,437 TPM) in the library. It is interesting that in both
libraries miR168 was the most frequent miRNA which
constituted nearly 32% of the miRNA transcriptome of
sweet orange.
The 48 miRNA families from sweet orange were compared with those from 11 other plant species (Figure 3).
Generally, the orange miRNAs had corresponding
homolog in at least one plant species; one miRNA
miR1061 only has homolog in phylogenetically distant
species Physcomitrella. Moreover, miR1169 and miR1171
were extraordinary that they only have homolog genes in
Chlamydomonas which belongs to protista kingdom.

These data suggest that some orange miRNAs are
ancient. Sweet orange was phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis which have 187 miRNA genes in miRBase v13.0
database; comparison between them showed that 28
miRNA familes were conserved between them. When
comparing with the 140 miRNA genes from another fruit
crop grapevine, 23 of them were conserved between
sweet orange and grapevine (Figure 3).
Putative targets of miRNAs were determined using
publicly available algorithms including miRU [56] and
WMD3 [57]. Of the 85 known miRNAs, 82 had putative
targets, with the exception of miR167a, miR845b, and
miR1520c (Additional file 7). Many putative targets are
transcription factors and homologs of known miRNA
target genes in other plant species, such as SBP for
miR156, NAC for miR164, bZIP for miR166, AP2 for
miR172 and F-box for miR394. One occasional case in
grapevine [60] was also observed in sweet orange: csimiR535 was predicted to target squamosa promoterbinding protein-like (SPL) gene while not target to a
brassinosteroid signaling regulator as that firstly reported
in moss [61].
Novel miRNAs

After excluding the rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNAs and
known miRNAs, the remained sRNA sequences were
used to BLAST search on orange unigenes and 1.2Ã cov-

erage sequence of sweet orange (from NCBI); and secondary structure prediction were done for each locus
using the criteria described by Jones-Rhoades et al. [29].
This analysis revealed that 21 sRNA sequences were perfectly matched ESTs and could be folded into stem-loop
structures (Additional file 8). Search of complementary
miRNA* sequences showed that 12 of the 21 candidate
miRNAs were detected (Table 2 and Additional file 8).
Based on the criteria of loci with stem-loop structure
producing sequenced mature miRNA and miRNA* species as described in Meyers et al. [51], these 12 sequences
were considered as novel miRNAs.
All the 12 novel miRNAs had a predicted target in at
least one orange EST sequence (Additional file 9). Putative targets of four miRNAs were transcription factors,
including NAC for csi-novel-01 and csi-novel-11, AUX/
IAA TF for csi-novel-03 and YABBY for csi-novel-10. It is
notable that one miRNA potentially target disease resistance genes, i.e. csi-novel-06 predicted to target on serine/threonine kinase gene.
To confirm the expression of the novel miRNAs, we
analyzed the expression of all the 12 novel miRNAs using
stem-loop qRT-PCR. All the genes could be detected by
qRT-PCR (Figure 4A). Of the 12 novel miRNAs, 8 genes
showed similar expression pattern to that revealed from
sequencing data of the sRNA libraries. The electrophore-

sis of the qRT-PCR products confirmed the size and
expression of these novel miRNAs (Figure 4C). Moreover,
we analyzed the expression of three miRNA*s (csi-novel03, -05, -06); and results showed that two miRNA*s had
different expression pattern from those of corresponding
mature miRNAs (Figure 4A).
miRNA-targets associated small RNAs

To compare the frequency of small RNAs located in
miRNA-target genes with other genes, we mined the
unique small RNAs (sRNAs) that matched perfectly to
miRNA-target genes in sense or antisense strands
according to Luo et al. [62]. Target prediction of the 85
known and 12 novel miRNAs produced a total of 555
miRNA-target genes. Then all the 555 miRNA-target
genes were searched against the unigenes on which
sRNAs were mapped. This analysis in WT showed that
13,811 sRNAs in sense and 8,281 sRNAs in antisense
were mapped perfectly on orange unigenes (Table 1;
Additional file 1). Of the mapped unigenes in WT, 76
were miRNA-target genes: 21 of them produced sRNAs
in sense strand, 11 in antisense and 44 in both sense and

antisense (Table 3). For MT sample, 18,142 and 10,651
sRNAs were mapped in sense and antisense, respectively
(Table 1; Additional file 2). Similar analysis revealed that
97 miRNA-target genes match sRNAs perfectly, with 20
in sense strand, 27 in antisense and 50 in both strand
(Table 3; detail in Additional file 10). This study showed
that 13.7% and 17.5% of the miRNA-target genes in WT
and MT could be the precursors of sRNAs. The high frequency of miRNA-targets associated sRNAs suggests that
miRNA-target genes are hotspots for generation of
sRNAs.
Differentially expressed miRNAs between WT and MT

The frequency of each miRNAs in the small RNA library
could serve as an index for the estimation of the relative
expression abundance of miRNAs. To investigate the
expression change of miRNAs between WT and MT, the
abundance of each miRNA was normalized as transcripts
per million (TPM). A total of 51 known miRNA genes
and 9 novel miRNAs were up- or down-regulated significantly at 0.01 level based on Z-score statistics (Table 2
and Additional file 5). Among these 60 differentially

expressed genes, 52 miRNAs showed a two-fold or
greater (ratio > 2 or < 0.5) expression difference between
MT and WT. Table 4 summarized the 20 miRNAs with
the most significant expression changes between WT and
MT.
To confirm the expression difference of the miRNA, we
analyzed the expression of 21 known miRNA genes using
stem-loop qRT-PCR in addition to the 12 novel miRNA
genes described earlier. The expression level of each gene
in the MT and WT was compared with its abundance
from the sequencing data of the sRNA library. Results
showed that among the 33 miRNAs, 18 known miRNAs
and 8 novel miRNAs have the same expression pattern in
WT and MT as that from sequencing data (Figure 4B).
Annotation of potential targets of differentially expressed
miRNAs

Functional annotations were further performed to investigate which processes are differentially regulated by miRNAs in the mutant. A total of 418 potential target genes
were predicted based on the 60 differentially expressed
miRNAs in sweet orange (Additional file 11). Interestingly, the potential targets included two important carotenogenic genes, i.e. geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
synthase (GGPS) gene which targeted by csi-miR167 and
lycopene Î²-cyclase (LYCb) gene which targeted by csimiR1857. To evaluate the potential functions of these
miRNA-target genes, gene ontology (GO) categories
were assigned to the putative targets of the 60 differentially expressed miRNA genes according to the method
described by Morin et al. [63]. Figure 5 summarized the
categorization of miRNA-target genes according to the
cellular component, molecular function, and biological
process. Based on molecular function, the genes were
finally classified into 13 categories, as shown in Figure 5B;
the most three over-represented GO terms are metal ion
binding, nucleic acid binding, and transcription factor
activity. Categories based on biological processes
revealed that the miRNA-target genes were related to 17
biological processes; the most three frequent terms are
regulation of transcription, signal transduction, protein
modification (Figure 5C). Moreover, GO representations
from this study were compared with that based on all the

public unigenes from sweet orange in TIGR gene index
database http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/
GO_browser.pl?species=Orange&gi_dir=csgi; the analysis revealed that the striking differences lies in the high
percentage of nucleus, plastid and chloroplast for cellular
component, and overpresentation of regulation of transcription, protein modification and photosynthesis for
biological process in this study.
The biological interpretation of the target genes of differential miRNAs was further completed using KEGG
pathway analysis. A total of 15 different metabolic pathways were found (Table 5), of which some were consistent
with biological processes that already revealed by GO
analysis. The most represented pathways included carbon
fixation (8 enzymes represented), fatty acid metabolism
(5), flavonoid biosynthesis (6), terpenoid biosynthesis (3),
and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis (3).
High ranked target genes of the differentially expressed
miRNAs were those implicated in three biological processes including regulation of transcription, protein modification and photosynthesis. It is easy to understand the
high frequency of terms 'regulation of transcription' and
'protein modification' since miRNA are involved in
diverse regulatory events [64]. However, the biological
process of photosynthesis needs to be verified. Moreover,
two carotenogenic genes were also predicted to be targeted by miRNAs. We further analyzed one gene involved
in the carbon fixation (miR319a and putative target phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase [TC11997]) and another
gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis (miR1857 and
putative target lycopene Î²-cyclase [LYCb]). The results
showed that the expression profiles of miRNAs are complementary to the profiles of their target genes (Figure 6),
implied the possible roles of miRNAs in regulation of the
biological processes that involved in shaping the mutant
trait in sweet orange.

Discussion
We have characterized the small RNA transcriptome in a
red-flesh mutant that with abnormal pattern of lycopene

was performed according to the cellular component (A), molecular
function (B), and biological process (C).

NAs. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of
cloning and characterization of large scale sRNAs and
identification of novel miRNAs from sweet orange. A
total of 5 and 7 million sRNAs were obtained from WT
and MT, respectively; and the size distribution of small
RNAs (Figure 2) is quite similar to those published from
phylogenetically close plant species such as Arabidopsis
[65], with the total percentage of 21-24 nt sRNAs being
more than 90% and percentage of 24 nt sRNAs over 50%.

In this study, 85 conserved miRNAs belonging 48 families
as well as 12 novel miRNA families were identified in
sweet orange. The miRNAs cloned in this study were
compared with those from previously reported citrus
miRNAs [36,66,67], of them four sweet orange miRNAs
were not overlap with this study. These results suggest
that at least 101 miRNAs exist in the miRNA transcriptome (miRNAome) of sweet orange. We believe that this
is a conservative estimate since only fruit samples were
used in this study. The miRNA species in wild type and
mutant was different, i.e. 69 miRNAs were detected in
WT sample while 66 miRNAs were in MT sample. Moreover, the expression levels of each miRNA varied greatly
within the transcriptome, i.e. in MT the abundance
ranged from 0.9 TPM for csi-miR1858 to 8437 TPM for
csi-miR168. All these data implied that miRNAome, as
small RNA transcriptome [38], is distinct and complex
though miRNA sequences are believed to be conserved
across different plant families [23,29,68].
Take a broader view on the small RNA transcriptome of
sweet orange, we noticed that the size distribution pattern of sRNAs from sweet orange (the total percentage of
21-24 nt sRNAs > 90% with 24 nt sRNAs > 50%) is quite
similar to Arabidopsis as described earlier [65]; however,
the distribution pattern is strikingly different from that in
Pinus contorta, a conifer species [37] where 24-nt RNAs
was less frequently (2.5%) and 21-nt RNAs were more
abundant (> 50%). The striking difference also existed
when compare the sweet orange small RNA transcriptome with another gymnosperm plant species, Chinese
yew (Taxus chinensis) [50]. When compared with monocot species rice, the difference is less severe but still
exists, i.e. in rice 24-nt sRNAs has the highest percentage
(approximately 20%) followed by the 21-nt sRNAs
(approximately 10%) [37]. These analyses indicated that
the small RNA transcriptome is complicated across plant
species and can be significantly different between phylogenetically-distant plant families.
A total of 12 novel miRNAs were identified from sweet
orange, as evidenced from the biogenesis characteristics
of miRNAs including the stem-loop structure of the premiRNAs (Additional file 8) and sequencing of the
miRNA* in the libraries. The expression of all the 12 miRNAs was also detected by qRT-PCR analyses. Additional
qRT-PCR analyses of miRNA*s revealed that some
miRNA* species can accumulated at certain levels in
fruits; moreover, the expression pattern of miRNA*s in
WT and MT fruits can be different from that of miRNAs.
For example, csi-novel-05 has lower expression in MT (30
TPM) than in WT (90 TPM) as confirmed by qRT-PCR

analysis; in contrast, csi-novel-05* has higher expression
in MT (50 TPM) than in WT (26 TPM) which was also
confirmed by qRT-PCR. The differential accumulation of
miRNAs and miRNA*s may be due to the different activities of key enzyme in the sRNA-pathway, as shown in rice
that the differential expression of AGO genes in different
tissues might cause the change of miRNA*s abundance
[44].
miRNA-targets are hot spots for generating sRNAs

The relationship of sRNA genes and the miRNA target
genes is one of the hot topics in the phenomenon of

"miRNA-associated transitivity" [69-71]. In this study,
13.7% (WT) and 17.5% (MT) of the miRNA putative target genes generated sRNAs. This data implied that
miRNA target gene could be hot spots for generating
sRNAs. Moreover, high percentage of antisense sRNAs
was associated with the miRNA-target genes, with 11.7%
and 12.6% for WT and MT, respectively. The antisense
sRNAs/transcripts can function in post-transcriptional
gene silencing [62,72]. The post-transcriptional gene
silencing is mainly caused by formation of dsRNA
duplexes; this could be supported from the observation
that 75% of the antisense sRNAs have their cognate sense

modified based on Xu et al. (2009) [13]. The two biological processes, the carotenogenesis and photosynthesis, were high ranked processes that differential miRNA target genes involved in by gene ontology analysis. The data of photosynthetic rate were extracted from our previous in situ photosynthesis analysis [13]. The expression profiles of miRNA319 and miR1857 are complementary to the profiles of the corresponding miRNA-target

miRNAs in plant fruits

miRNAs possibly involved in the regulation of lycopene
accumulation in the sweet orange red-flesh mutant

Up to now, miRNA identification in fruits using a cloning
approach is rare except in tomato [23] and grape [60]. In
this study, cloning from sweet orange fruit led to the
identification of 48 conserved miRNA families. Analysis
of them revealed that 6 miRNA families are expressed in
fruits of the three plant species; but they are not fruitspecific. Furthermore, the comparison between the two
fruit crops (85 miRNAs from sweet orange and 140 miRNAs from grapevine) showed that 8 miRNA families are
expressed in fruits of both crops, and only miR535 is specific to the two species. These analyses suggested that
expression and function of fruit-specific miRNAs across
plant species is lacking, and miRNAs involved in fruit ripening may overlap with that function in other organs, or

The characterization and comparative profiling of entire
sets of small RNAs (Small RNA transcriptome), especially
the microRNA transcriptome, lays the foundation to
unravel the complex miRNA-mediated regulatory networks controlling lycopene accumulation in the red-flesh
sweet orange mutant. In this study, a number of miRNAs
have been identified to be differentially expressed
between 'Anliu' sweet orange (WT) and its red-flesh
mutant (MT). Compared with WT, 16 known miRNA
genes and one novel miRNA genes were expressed exclusively in MT. On the other hand, we found 19 known
miRNAs and two novel miRNAs were WT-specific.
Moreover, a total of 51 known miRNAs and 9 novel miR-

NAs were found to exhibit significant expression changes
between MT and WT.
Target prediction of these differential miRNAs could
provide information on the biological processes regulated
by miRNA. Putative targets were predicted by psRNATarget (the updated version of miRU) [56] and web
miRNA designer (WMD3) [57]. This strategy was also
used in Arabidopsis for the identification of nutrientresponsive miRNAs and their potential targets [24],
though further direct validation is necessary to elucidate
the true in-vivo targets. However, the annotations of
these potential miRNA target genes did provide an alternate view of gene regulation of the red-flesh trait formation in MT (Additional file 11). We found that three
groups of predicted miRNA-target genes are most possibly involved in the mutant trait formation of lycopene
accumulation. The first interesting observation is that
two potential targets (EY752486 by csi-miR167 and TC5
by csi-miR1857) are the key enzymes of the carotenoid
biosynthesis pathway (Additional file 11). They encode
geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPS), a key
enzyme for the production of prerequisite molecules for
carotenoids accumulation, and lycopene Î²-cyclase
(LYCb), a rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of lycopene to downstream cyclic carotenes. The expression of
LYCb and csi-miR1857 also indicated possible interaction
between them because of the complementary expression
profile (Figure 6). And we also detected the GGPS gene
expression, but failed due to the incorrect sequence information in the current public database. The second interesting target genes are APETALA2 (AP2) transcription
factors, including EY726563 by csi-novel-03, and TC7810
by csi-miR172a. In Arabidopsis, one AP2 protein (designated as RAP2.2) has been experimentally validated to
interact with phytoene synthase (PSY) gene, which
encodes a rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of carotenoids. The RAP2.2 gene was also believed to be regulated by miRNA because of the large discrepancy
between mRNA and protein levels in the overexpression
lines [15]. The data from this study also supported the
proposition, and indicated that RAP2.2 (encoded by
TC7810 gene in this study) is a potential target of
miRNA172a in sweet orange. The third group of target
genes is those involved in photosynthesis or carbon fixation (Table 5). The potential target genes associated with
photosynthesis fits well with the GO results with large
number of genes that are located in chloroplast or plastid.
Moreover, our photosynthesis-related gene expression
analysis and in situ detection of the photosynthetic rate
confirmed that photosynthesis in MT is stronger than
that in WT (Figure 6). The result is quite consistent with
our gas chromatographic analyses that the sugars in juice
sacs are higher in MT than in WT [11]. Tomato hp-2
mutant which manifested with increased carotenoids,

Page 13 of 17

primarily lycopene, showed that genes related with photosynthesis are consistently up-regulated throughout
fruit ripening [73]. All these evidences implied the important role of photosynthesis in the accumulation of lycopene. Taken together, the annotation of the potential
targets of differentially expressed miRNA genes between
WT and MT indicated that several miRNA-directed biological processes including carotenoid biosynthesis, transcription regulation, and photosynthesis may be
important for the regulation of lycopene accumulation in
the sweet orange red-flesh mutant.

Conclusions
Our study provides a large scale cloning and characterization of miRNAs in sweet orange. The interpretation of
the small RNA data uncovered a total of 85 known and 12
novel miRNAs. Meanwhile, comparative profiling of
these miRNAs between a spontaneous red-flesh mutant
and its wild type revealed that 51 known and 9 novel
miRNAs are differentially expressed. Target prediction of
the 60 differential miRNAs indicated that two key genes
of the carotenoid biosynthesis, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPS) and lycopene Î²-cyclase (LYCb),
are under miRNA regulation. Functional annotation of
the 418 target genes of differential miRNA revealed that
high ranked biological processes are transcription regulation, protein modification and photosynthesis. The
expression of miRNAs and target genes involved in photosynthesis and carotenogenesis were further confirmed.
Taken together, this study provides new insight into the
miRNAome and possible miRNA-directed molecular
processes that regulate lycopene accumulation in the redflesh sweet orange mutant.
Methods
Plant materials and RNA preparation

The red-flesh mutant 'Hong Anliu' and the wild type
'Anliu' sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck), cultivated at the Institute of Citrus Research located in Guilin,
Guangxi Province, China, were used as materials. The
mutant 'Hong Anliu' sweet orange (MT) is a spontaneous
bud mutation of wild type 'Anliu' sweet orange (WT); and
they are with isogenic background as revealed from our
previous physiological traits and molecular marker evaluations [11]. Same sampling strategy as previously published [13] was employed. Fruit samples were harvested
at 170 days after flowering (DAF) that is the critical stage
for the flesh color transition. Three different trees were
used, and 10 representative fruits from each tree were
collected. All samples were separated into peel and pulp,
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80Â°C
until use. Total RNA was extracted according to Liu et al.
[74].

Small RNA library construction and sequencing

Small RNA library construction and sequencing was performed as described by Yao et al. [49]. Briefly, small RNAs
with 16-30 nt in length were isolated from the total RNA
of WT and MT samples by size fractionation with 15%
Tris-borate-EDTA urea polyacrylamide gel (TBU). After
extraction from the gel, sRNA was dephosphorylatd by
alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Then
the small RNAs were ligated sequentially to 5' and 3'
RNA/DNA chimeric oligonucleotide adaptors (Illumina).
The ligation products were purified from 10% TBE urea
polyacrylamide gel. Reverse transcription was performed
with the ligated sRNAs as templates. The obtained
cDNAs were sequenced using the Illumina 1 G Genome
Analyzer by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) (Shenzhen,
China).
Small RNA annotation and microRNA identification

Small RNA sequences were extracted from raw reads
matching both the last 7 nt of the 5'-adaptor and the first
7 nt of the 3'-adaptor as described by Moxon et al. [23].
After trimming off the adaptors, sequences between 18
and 30 bp in length and reads more than 3 were used to
search the Rfam database http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam by BLASTN analysis to discard rRNA, tRNA,
snRNA, and snoRNA. The remaining sequences were
compared to known plant miRNAs from miRBase v13.0
[75] using BLASTN algorithm to search conserved miRNAs. Sequences in our libraries with identical or with
four or fewer mismatches to currently known miRNAs
from other plant species were regarded as potential conserved miRNAs. The potential miRNA sequences were
used for BLASTN search against sweet orange unigene
dataset and 1.2Ã coverage sequence of sweet orange
(from NCBI), the perfectly matched sequences were used
for fold-back structure prediction by Mfold program [59].
To identify non-conserved miRNAs from sweet orange,
the remained sRNAs were used for BLASTN search
against sweet orange ESTs from TIGR gene index database
http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/
GO_browser.pl?species=Orange&gi_dir=csgi and 1.2Ã
coverage sequence of sweet orange (from NCBI), since
the sweet orange genome is not fully sequenced. The
sequences of perfect match with sRNA sequences were
used for fold-back structure prediction by Mfold program
[59]. The sRNAs that have stem-loop precursors were
regarded as putative non-conserved miRNAs. Furthermore, we searched miRNA* sequences (complementary
to miRNA in the precursor molecule) in the sRNA libraries. Only those with miRNA-miRNA* duplexes were
regarded as novel miRNAs.
Significance level of the difference of miRNA frequency
and abundance between WT and MT was analyzed using
Z-score method according to Kal et al. [76]. The signifi-

p value < 0.01.
miRNA expression confirmation by stem-loop qRT-PCR

The detection of miRNA expression was performed using
stem-loop qRT-PCR method according to Chen et al. [53]
and Varkonyi-Gasic et al. [54]. Stem-loop primers for
reverse transcription and primers for quantitative PCR
were list in Additional file 12. Total RNA was reversetranscribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen, US) by a pulse reverse transcription program
[54]. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed
on the ABI 7500 Real Time System (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using actin gene as endogenous control according to Liu et al. [11]. Briefly, the
primers for miRNAs and actin were diluted in the SYBER
GREEN PCR Master Mix (PE Applied Biosystems) and 20
Î¼l of the reaction mix was added to each well. Reactions
were performed by an initial incubation at 50Â°C for 2 min
and at 95Â°C for 1 min, and then cycled at 95Â°C for 15 s and
60Â°C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Output data was generated
by the instrument on-board software Sequence Detector
Version 1.3.1 (PE Applied Biosystems). The electrophoresis of the PCR products was performed on 3% agarose gel
for 1 hr under 70 V voltage. The marker contained two
fragments, 50 and 60 bp in length, the sequences information was: GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACCCGATG and CGGCG
AAGATTGAAGTGAAGGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACTTCCGA respectively.
Target prediction of miRNAs

Target prediction of miRNAs from sweet orange was performed based on methods described by Pant et al. [24].
Two publicly available algorithms, miRU [56] and WMD3
[57] were used in the prediction. The sweet orange EST
sequences from TIGR database as described earlier were
used to predict the targets. The hybridization energy of
each miRNA-predicted target duplex (ÎG) was determined from WMD3 output.
Functional assignments of the potential targets of
differentially expressed miRNAs

To investigate biological processes possibly regulated by
miRNAs, assignments of putative functions to potential
target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were performed using annot8r program, which was run locally to
BLAST against a reference database that stores UniProt
entries, their associated Gene Ontology (GO), Enzyme
Commission (EC) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) annotations [77]. The GO categorization results were expressed as three independent hierarchies for biological process, cellular component, and
molecular function [78]. The biological interpretation of

Xu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:246
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/246

the potential targets was further completed by assigning
to metabolic pathways using KEGG [79].
The expression detection of two microRNAs target genes

The expression levels of one carotenoid biosynthesis gene
(lycopene Î²-cyclase, LYCb) and one carbon fixationrelated
gene
(phosphoenolpyruvate
