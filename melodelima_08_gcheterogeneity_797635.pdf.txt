Abstract
Background: One of the most striking features of mammalian and birds chromosomes is the
variation in the guanine-cytosine (GC) content that occurs over scales of hundreds of kilobases to
megabases; this is known as the "isochore" structure. Among other vertebrates the presence of
isochores depends upon the taxon; isochore are clearly present in Crocodiles and turtles but fish
genome seems very homogeneous on GC content. This has suggested a unique isochore origin
after the divergence between Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygii, but before that between Sauropsida
and mammals. However during more than 30 years of analysis, isochore characteristics have been
studied and many important biological properties have been associated with the isochore structure
of human genomes. For instance, the genes are more compact and their density is highest in GC
rich isochores.
Results: This paper shows in teleost fish genomes the existence of "GC segmentation" sharing
some of the characteristics of isochores although teleost fish genomes presenting a particular
homogeneity in CG content. The entire genomes of T nigroviridis and D rerio are now available, and
this has made it possible to check whether a mosaic structure associated with isochore properties
can be found in these fishes. In this study, hidden Markov models were trained on fish genes (T
nigroviridis and D rerio) which were classified by using the isochore class of their human orthologous.
A clear segmentation of these genomes was detected.
Conclusion: The GC content is an excellent indicator of isochores in heterogeneous genomes as
mammals. The segmentation we obtained were well correlated with GC content and other
properties associated to GC content such as gene density, the number of exons per gene and the
length of introns. Therefore, the GC content is the main property that allows the detection of
isochore but more biological properties have to be taken into account. This method allows
detecting isochores in homogeneous genomes.

Background
The isochore structure refers to the fact that some eukaryotic genomes are organized into mosaics, which are characterized by a having fairly constant average guaninecytosine (GC) content over scales of kilobases, and then

abruptly shifting to another fairly constant-GC-content
level [1]. The isochore has been classified as a "fundamental level of genome organization" [2], and this concept has
increased our appreciation of the complexity and variability of the composition of eukaryotic genomes [3]. This

compositional pattern is typical of vertebrate genomes.
However, some authors have identified isochore structure
in the Arabidopsis thaliana ([3-6]). Analyses using density
gradient ultracentrifugation have shown that mammal
and bird genomes vary widely. In contrast, the genomes of
amphibians and fishes (cold-blooded vertebrates) are
characterized by a much lower level of compositional heterogeneity [7]. From these observations, a correlation
between isochore structure and body temperature pattern
is assumed [8]. However, on average, the GC3 level of
codons is lower in cold-blooded vertebrates than in mammals and chickens, but there is substantial variation in the
mean GC3 level between cold-blooded vertebrate species
([9-14]). In contrast, even if only partial dataset are available, it seems that almost all cold-blooded vertebrates
show substantially less variability in GC3 within their
genomes than warm-blooded species.

The sequencing of the D rerio and T nigroviridis genomes
has made it possible to carry out large scale genome comparisons of fish and other vertebrate genomes, and in particular the human genome. The remarkably compact
nature of the T nigroviridis genome [15], and the relative
homogeneity of the GC content (Figure 1) tend to confirm the absence of isochores in the T nigroviridis genome.
The T nigroviridis and the D rerio genome are homogeneous, however, the D rerio genome is much longer and its
GC content is much lower (Figure 1). Many important
biological properties have been associated with the isochore structure of human genomes. In particular, the density of genes has been shown to be higher in GC-rich than
in GC poor-isochores ([16,17]). Genes in GC-rich isochores are more compact, with a smaller proportion of
intronic sequences, and large proteins are avoided in GCrich isochores [18]. Additionally, the insertion process of
repeated elements depends on the isochore region

involved [17]. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether a mosaic structure associated with isochore
properties may be found in these fishes. One of the original features of the present study is that it assumes that for
the most part, orthologous genes are found in different
species of vertebrate, even if they are as divergent as a fish
and a mammal ([15,19]). The characteristics of gene contained in human isochores can be found in fish orthologous genes. Thus, specific Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) were developed to work on fish genes that are
orthologous to human genes [20]. Then, the biological
properties of segmentation are compared with the biological properties known to be linked to isochores in mammalian genomes. A Moran Index calculated on a sliding
window is used to test the quality index of our segmentation.

Results
Preliminary results obtained in the chicken genome
In this study, we assume that orthologous genes remain
approximately in the same isochore class over evolutionary time between human and fish genomes. Therefore,
before assuming it is true in fishes, we have verified that
this assumption is true in other isochore-containing
genomes. These preliminary studies were conducted on
chicken genome since it is more close to the human
genome. A correlation between human and chicken GC3
values (R = 0.58, p-value < 2.10-16) was observed. The
mean GC contents were 0.49 (σ = 0.03), 0.44 (σ = 0.03)
and 0.40 (σ = 0.02) respectively for the H, M and L isochore classes as defined by our HMM method. The
Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was significant (pvalue < 10-5). For all chromosomes, the isochore structure
is correlated with the gene density distribution along the
chromosome. The gene density in the H isochores (40.2
genes per Mb) was higher than the gene density in the L
isochores (15.4 genes per Mb), leading to a significant
Wilcoxon test (p-value = 3.10-8). The same difference was
observed when we compared the characteristics of the M
isochores (20.9 genes per Mb) with those of the H (pvalue = 5.10–4) and L isochores (p-value = 4.10-7). A correlation between the number of exons per gene and isochore class was observed. The number of exons per gene
in the H isochore (9) was smaller compared with the
number of exons in the isochore L (12.4) (p-value = 2.103). To conclude, the results of this preliminary study allow
us to suppose that characteristics of gene contained in
human isochores can be found in fish orthologous genes
as in chicken genomes.
Evaluation of HMMs
Three HMMs, ("H", "M" and "L"), were built. T nigroviridis
and D rerio models "H", "M" and "L" were trained according to the fish genes orthologous to human isochores GCrich, GC-medium and GC-poor. These HMMs were used

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/632

to make a segmentation of the genome. The structural differences between genes in the "H" and "L" classes
obtained for these two fish species are shown in Figure 2.
For each species, the genes belonging to the "H" class were
preferentially recognized by the "H" model; whereas the
genes of isochore "L" were mainly recognized by the "L"
model. The results of the ℵ2 test were highly significant
(the p-values were 3.10-12 and 7.10-9 for T nigroviridis and
D rerio respectively). Therefore, and this shows that there
is a significant difference in structure between classes "H"
and "L" in these two species. If the same approach is used
on the set of human genes orthologous to T nigroviridis
genes a stronger differentiation between H and L is
obtained; the p-value of the test ℵ2 was 2.10-27.
To verify the absence of a methodological bias, genes have
been randomly separated into 2 classes (I and II). A
Markov model was trained for each of these classes by
using a test set containing 2/3 of the genes. Figure 3 shows
that these models, as expected, do not discriminated
between classes I and II (the p-values of the ℵ2 test were
0.87 and 0.48 for T nigroviridis and D rerio respectively).

the T. nigroviris belongs to the H isochore and most of D.
rerio belongs to the L isochore. Segmentation obtained by
your method confirms this hypothesis. Thus, in the T
nigroviridis genome, most of the isochores belong to class
H. The distribution of isochores H and L was fairly similar
in the different chromosomes.
The isochores were not uniformly distributed along the
chromosomes of the D rerio genome. There were more L
isochores than H isochores. The main characteristic of the
D rerio genome was that some chromosomes consisted
entirely of L isochores (for example, chromosome 7, Figure 5a), whereas others consisted mainly of H isochores
(for example chromosome 16, Figure 5b).
Along the T nigroviridis and D rerio genomes, the distribution of windows has been compared with 1000 random
permutations of the same windows. A significant difference was observed between the average length of iso-

chores obtained by our prediction and the average length
of isochores obtained by simulation (the p-values of the
ℵ2 test were equal to 2.10-3 for the T nigroviridis and 2.1015 for the D rerio, respectively). This test confirms that a
regional structure exists in the two fish genomes as consecutive windows have a greater probability to belong to
the same isochore than by chance.
Correlation between biological properties and the GC
heterogeneity
The isochore structure of mammalian genomes has been
implicated in numerous biological characteristics. We
have shown that these characteristics are also linked to the
segmentation described here for fish genomes.

Size of segmentation
The average length of an isochore depends on the species.
On the T nigroviridis genome, the H isochores are longer
than other types of isochores. The average length for L isochores was 33.1 kb, whereas the average lengths of the M
and H isochores were 55.2 kb and 73.1 kb respectively.
These lengths were significantly different (Kruskall-Wallis

p-value < 10-8), however, on the D rerio genome, the L isochores were on average longer (638 kb). The lengths of the
M and H isochores of D rerio were 61.7 kb and 59.4 kb
respectively. These lengths were significantly different
(Kruskall-Wallis p-value < 10-12).
There is a correlation between the size of segmentation
and the length of the genome. This has been studied for T.
nigroviridis, D. rerio, chicken, human, chimpanzee and
mouse (Figure 6a). The correlation value was R = 0.76.
Moreover, the variability of the size of the autosomes was
linked to the variability of the GC content (R = 0.59) (figure 6b).
GC content of each type of segmentation
The GC content for H, M and L isochores from the two
Teleost fishes and human (from [17]) are shown in figure
7 and 8. The D rerio genome is more homogeneous compared with the T nigroviridis genome but the segmentation
of the two fish genomes was related to the GC content.
Gene distribution in each type of segmentation
The percentage of the coding region in each isochore class
was consistent with that found for mammalian genomes
[16]. For the T nigroviridis, the coding regions correspond
to 10.2% of the H isochores, and 5.5% of the L isochores.
The p-value of the Wilcoxon test was significant (p = 2.103). For D rerio genome, the coding regions correspond to
1.8% of the H isochores, and 1.3% of the L isochores (pvalue = 3.10-2).
Transposable elements
In the human genome, the insertion process of repeated
elements depends on the isochore region involved [17].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/632

We have investigated the correlation between transposable elements and mosaic segmentations along T. nigroviridis and D. rerio. No effect of repeats has been observed
on our segmentation of T. nigroviridis and D. rerio.
Gene structure in each type of segmentation
The length distributions of exons were approximately the
same in the three isochore classes for all three species
(Table 1). However, initial exons tended to be longer in
the H classes of these three species. Human and D rerio
introns were longer than T nigroviridis introns. Furthermore, human and D rerio intron lengths depend on the
isochore class, whereas this is not true for the T nigroviridis.
The number of exons per gene was similar in the two fish
species (Table 2). A correlation between the number of
exons per gene and per isochore class was observed for
each species. Finally, the GC content of exons and introns
vary significantly in the human and T nigroviridis genomes
depending on the isochore class, but was only significant
for CDS in the case of D rerio (Table 3).
Influence of the GC content on segmentations
The 7753 pairs of orthologous genes used to train the model
were used to compare the GC3 content in the three classes. As
expected, the Kruskal-Wallis test was highly significant (pvalue < 2.2 10-16) for human genes, and the difference was
also significant (p-value = 8 10-3) for the T nigroviridis genes.
The difference in the GC3 content was preserved between the
two species, although this difference was clearly weaker in
the T nigroviridis genome than in the Human genome. To
evaluate the role of GC3 content in our T nigroviridis genome
segmentation, a new model based on three classes defined
by their GC3 content was built. Three classes were defined
based on the GC frequencies at the third codon position

nigroviridis and D rerio genomes was analyzed by computing: (i) for each chromosome, the Moran's Index based on
the GC3 of genes distributed along the chromosome and
(ii) the Moran's Index based on the GC content (windows
of 14 kb were used) (Table 4). For the two fishes, these
tests show a high autocorrelation of GC, and a clear but
weaker autocorrelation of GC3. Autocorrelations were
higher in T nigroviridis than in D rerio.

Kruskal and Wallis non-parametric test comparing the GC

(GC3). The limits were set so that all three classes contained
approximately the same number of genes. This yielded
classes HGC = [100%, 75%], MGC = ]61%,75% [and LGC =
[0%,61%]. Two thirds of the genes were used to train HMM
models, and the remaining genes were used for testing. For T
nigroviridis, the likelihood of LGC and HGC Markov models
revealed a significant difference between the LGC and HGC
classes (the p-value of the ℵ2 test was equal to 6.10-11). However, the difference between the LGC and HGC classes was
not as great as that between the "H" and "L" classes, and the
p-values were 6.10-11 and 3.10-12 respectively. Comparing the
genes in class HGC to those in class H showed that only 57%
were the same. In the MGC and LGC classes, only 60% and
58% of genes respectively were the same as those in classes
M and L.
The same study was carried out on D rerio genes. In this case,
the comparison of the GC3 content in the three classes by the
Kruskal-Wallis test was weakly significant (p-value 5.10-2).
For D rerio, the following limits were used for the classes:
HGC = [100%, 61%], MGC = ]56%,61% [and LGC =
[0%,56%]. A comparison of LGC and HGC reveals a significant difference (the p-value of the ℵ2 test was equal to 3.104). However, the difference between classes LGC and HGC
was less marked than between classes "H" and "L", the p-values were 3.10-4 and 7.10-9 respectively.

and D rerio genomes

To quantify the level of segmentation obtained by our
method, we computed for each chromosome (i) the
Moran's Index based on the P [H | W] of windows distributed along the chromosome and (ii) the Moran's Index
according to the P [L | W] of windows distributed along
the chromosome. For the T nigroviridis genome, a high
autocorrelation of the P [H | W] was found. The autocorrelation of the P [L | W] was less obvious, but still significant. For the D rerio genome, the opposite was observed:
the autocorrelation of the P [L | W] was clearer than the
autocorrelation of the P [H | W], however correlations
were significant in all cases.

Discussion
The existence of clustering of high-GC and low-GC regions
within the genomes of mammals and birds is generally
accepted. Recently, some authors have shown the presence
of isochore structures in the Arabidopsis Thaliana ([3,6]), or
in Apis mellifera ([21]). These studies tend to show that
regional compositional structures are not random and/or
restricted to specific taxa as vertebrate. Additionally, we in the
present study and in a previous one about human genome
[20] we have shown that segmentations were linked to several biological properties (gene density, the number of exons
per gene and the length of introns) and can not be considered as random sequences.
The originality of our approach was that it assumed that
the characteristics of genes contained in human isochores
would also be found in orthologous genes of species not
thought to have isochores. Therefore, the GC content was
not the only feature we used to segment fish genomes. A
difference in the quality of the predictions of models
between human and fishes has been identified in this
study. To construct the H and L classes of fish, we have
assumed that each fish gene has kept at least one characteristic related to the isochore class of the orthologous
human gene. However, some genes could have lost this
characteristic as a result of evolving differently in the two
species. Therefore, the difference in prediction accuracy
between human and fish could be explained by the presence of these genes since their GC content is different
compared with the GC of isochore class in fish. Nevertheless, although the mammals and fishes separated more
than 450 million years ago, we have found a correlation
between human and Tetraodon GC3 values (R = 0.25, pvalue < 2.10-16) as well as between human and D. rerio

GC3 (R = 0.19, p-value < 2.10-16). Thus, in species thought
not to have isochores, it was possible to find signs of isochores derived from the orthologous mammalian genes.
No limits of the GC content of the isochore classes were
fixed, but they varied from one species to another according to the content and the homogeneity of the GC of the
genome studied. Many regions associated with human

isochores could be characterized and predicted thanks to
factors other than the GC content, such as the intron
lengths and the gene density.
The segmentations obtained in this paper were linked to
isochores properties of mammal genomes (size of segmentation, GC content, gene density, and gene structure).

chore class. This is more than a simple "isochore" map of
the fish genomes. The training of the HMMs ("H", "M",
"L"), and their comparison using test sets show some differences of characteristics between the genes T nigroviridis
and those of D rerio. For example, gene density, the length
of the initial exons and the length of introns were different
for genes classified as belonging to "H", and belonging to
"the predicted H isochore", than those for genes classified
as "L" and belonging to the predicted L isochore.

Conclusion
There was a significant difference between the isochore
distribution found using our method of prediction windows, and a random distribution of these windows. There
were more coding regions in the H isochore than in the L
isochore in both these fish species. However, the difference between the ratio of coding regions in isochores H
and L was weaker in the D rerio genome than in the T
nigroviridis genome. The segmentation obtained for the D
rerio genome was longer compared with the segmentation
observed in T nigroviridis genome. In D rerio, some chromosomes had only L isochores, whereas others contained
only H isochores. Nevertheless, the distribution of genes
between the different chromosomes was approximately
the same.
Pizon et al. [22] have suggested that at least two families
of isochores were found for a tetradontid fish. Moreover,
the Moran's Index for the GC3 content, the GC content
and the probability values P [H | S] and P [L | S] show that
our segmentation has a link with the GC content. These
results show that the use of characteristics associated to
the isochore organization that are complementary of the
GC content, for example gene density or gene structure,
may improve the detection of isochores.
Furthermore, the comparison of the performance of the
hidden Markov models adapted to the "H", "L" and "M"
classes with those adapted to random classes reinforce the
idea that the characteristics of gene depend of their iso-

The genomes of mammals and birds are mosaics of isochores, i.e. long DNA segments relatively homogeneous
in GC content when compared to the pronounced heterogeneity throughout the entire genome. The present study
reveals that there is a mosaic structure related to isochores
in the genomes of both T nigroviridis and D rerio although
they are characterized by lower level of compositional heterogeneity. Thus, the homogeneity of the GC content of
isochores should be considered to be relative. In conclusion, an updated definition of isochore can be proposed
since isochore can be detected also in compositionally
homogeneous genomes. Isochores are a segment of
genome DNA, in which many characteristics, such as gene
density, GC content, the number of exons per gene and
the length of introns are different from one isochores to
another.

Methods
Materials
For the preliminary study, the orthologous Human and
chicken genes were extracted from GemCore http://
pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/gem/gem_home.php. Pairs of orthologous genes have been inferred by reciprocal best hit from
sequences in ENSEMBL. This approach is quicker than
phylogenetic analysis, and gives similar results once
whole genomes have been established. This procedure
yielded a set of 6821 orthologous genes between human
and chicken genomes.

For all T nigroviridis and D chromosomes, maximum and minimum values of the Moran Index in the four cases of autocorrelation (GC3, GC, P [H |
W] and P [L | W], W = window of 14 kb). In all cases, the Moran test was highly significant and confirmed the presence of a spatial organization.

Similarly, the orthologous Human and T nigroviridis genes
were extracted from GemCore. Pairs of orthologous genes
have been inferred by reciprocal best hit from sequences
in ENSEMBL. This procedure yielded a set of orthologous
7753 genes between Human and T nigroviridis. These
genes corresponded to 27% of all the genes annotated by
Ensembl. Similarly, 8872 human and D rerio orthologous
genes were extracted. Data on all T nigroviridis and D rerio
chromosomes were retrieved from Ensembl. These data
were used to train HMMs. The segmentations and their
analysis have been performed on the entire genomes of
the T nigroviridis and D rerio.
Mosaic chromosome maps of the T nigroviridis and D rerio
genomes
Based on the work realized for the human genome[20],
HMMs have been built, adapted and trained on T nigroviridis and D rerio genes. High, Medium and Low-density
genomic segments are known as H, M and L isochores
respectively, in order of decreasing GC content. Four steps
are required to locate isochores along the T nigroviridis and
the D rerio genomes:
• Model learning procedures
The three isochore regions (H, L and M) of the T nigroviridis and D rerio genomes were characterized by three
HMMs ("H", "M" and "L"). Each region (intergenic,
intronic or exonic) was taken into account, and represented by a macro-state in each of the HMMs, H, M and L.
In addition, exons consist of a succession of codons. Each
of the three possible positions in a codon (1, 2, 3) has its
own characteristic statistical properties, and was taken
into account. Additionally, each HMM also takes into
account the direct and reverse strands of the DNA
sequences [17]. T nigroviridis and D rerio genes were used
to train. nigroviridis and D rerio models. Fish genes corresponding to their orthologous genes located in the H, M
and L isochores of the human genome were selected as
belonging to the H, M and L isochores of fishes. The H, M
and L classes contained 2304, 2134 and 3314 genes
respectively in the T nigroviridis genome, and 2619, 2437
and 3816 genes in the D rerio genome. To constitute a
training set and a test set, genes of each class were ran-

domly separated. The training and test sets contained 2/3
and 1/3 of the genes respectively. This distribution provided enough data to train the models, and also to obtain
a significant number of genes to test the efficiency of the
models. Lastly, a hidden Markov model was adapted to
each isochore class [20].
• Sliding windows
the DNA of each chromosome was divided into 14 kb
overlapping windows. Two successive windows overlapped by half their length. These windows were smaller
that those in the study conducted on the human genome
since the T nigroviridis and D rerio genomes were smaller
than the human genome [20]. The compact nature of the
T nigroviridis genome suggests that these windows may
contain genes. This was important, because the gene unit
was the principal discriminating information for the predictions of our HMM.
• Segmentation by a Bayesian approach
For each window and for each model (H,L and M), the
probability P [Mod | S] was obtained using equation 1:

P( Mod S) =

P(S Mod)× P( Mod)
,
P(S m)× P(m)
∑
m∈{ H , M,L }

(1)

where Mod is "H","L" or "M", and S the window that is
being tested,P(S|Mod) was computed by the forward algorithm using the SARMENT package [23]. In our case, the
characteristics of P(Mod) were unknown. We estimated
them as P(H) ≈ P(M) ≈ P(L) ≈ 1/3. As a consequence, our
Bayesian approach was numerically very close to a maximum likelihood approach. The model with the best probability characterizes the isochore type allocated to a
window. The segmentation is represented by this succession of windows.
Mosaic chromosome of chicken genome
To confirm results obtained on fish genome, it was interesting to test if orthologous genes remain approximately
in the same isochore class over evolutionary time in some
other isochore containing genome. Thus, the procedure

described before has been applied on chicken genome
because human and chicken genomes are closer than
human and fish genomes.
• Evaluation of our segmentation
Several tests were performed in order to check the consistency of the isochore prediction: (i) the distribution of isochores was plotted versus the GC content along the
chromosome; (ii) the ratio of coding regions was compared between the H and L isochores predicted by our
method; (iii) furthermore, the segmentation made it possible to define the isochore class of each window along the
genomes of T nigroviridis and D rerio. The distribution of
isochores in these windows was compared to a random
distribution of these windows. One thousand simulations
were carried out.
Evaluation of HMMs
A supplementary analysis was carried out in order to
check that various different structures had been preserved
in the T nigroviridis and D rerio genes according to the isochore classes (H, L and M) of their orthologous genes in
the human genome. Two analyses were performed:

In this study the Moran's Index was used for each chromosome in order to measure the autocorrelation of (i) the
spatial GC3 distribution, (ii) the spatial GC distribution,
and (iii) the spatial autocorrelation of the prediction of
models H and L: P [H | S] et P [L | S].

Test sets
The predictions of the H and L models were compared to
the H and L gene test sets in order to determine the degree
of differentiation between these two classes of genes.

4.

Random sets
The H and L models were compared to random models.
For each fish species, the set of orthologous genes was
split randomly into two sets corresponding to two new
classes: I and II. Each of these classes contained one half
of the orthologous genes. Each class was then split randomly into a training set and a test set, 2/3 of genes were
attributed to the training sets. Two models were trained
using training sets I and II. The predictions of models I
and II were compared to the test sets I and II.

Analysis of the spatial structure along the T nigroviridis
and D rerio genome
We proposed to use a Moran Index calculated on a sliding
window as the quality index. The Moran index is a correlation coefficient, and is used to estimate the degree of
spatial autocorrelation at all windows. The Moran Index is
given by the ratio of the covariance over the variance as
shown in equation 2:

∑ w ij ( x i − x )( x j − x )
n i, j
I=

∑ w i, j
∑ (x i − x )
