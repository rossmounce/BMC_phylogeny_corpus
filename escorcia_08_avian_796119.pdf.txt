Abstract
Antigenic drift of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) has been observed in chickens after extended
vaccination program, similar to those observed with human influenza viruses. To evaluate the
evolutionary properties of endemic AIV under high vaccination pressure (around 2 billion doses
used in the last 12 years), we performed a pilot phylogenic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene
of AIVs isolated from 1994 to 2006. This study demonstrates that Mexican low pathogenicity (LP)
H5N2-AIVs are constantly undergoing genetic drifts. Recent AIV isolates (2002–2006) show
significant molecular drifts when compared with the H5N2 vaccine-strain or other field isolates
(1994–2000). This study also demonstrates that molecular drifts in the HA gene lineages follow a
yearly trend, suggesting gradually cumulative sequence mutations. These findings might explain the
increasing incidence of LP H5N2 AIV isolated from commercial avian farms. These findings support
recent concerns about the challenge of AIV antigenic drift and influenza epidemics.

Findings
Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenzavirus A genus. AIV is characterized
by its ability to undergo constant antigenic changes [1].
AIV envelope contains two major glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [2]. The HA/NA
proteins play a key role during cellular infection. Different
HA/NA combinations allow AIV subtype discrimination.
Depending on the damage caused to avian species, AIVs
are categorized as either high or low pathogenicity (HP
and LP, respectively).
In Mexico, LP AIV was first detected in May 1994, among
commercial farms. Since then, an Avian Influenza

National Campaign established by the Mexican Ministry
of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries
and Food (SAGARPA, its Spanish acronym), is in operation. The purpose of this campaign is to eradicate the subtype H5N2 LP AIV that is still present in specific areas of
Mexico. Vaccination of commercial flocks is one of many
strategies for this campaign. The vaccine strain officially
authorized, as seed for commercial vaccine production is
the A/Ck/México/CPA-232/94 (H5N2), isolated in 1994
[3].
The use of the commercial vaccine in Mexico was originally aimed to eradicate HP AIV and this was accomplished in June 1994. Then, the decision was made to

continue vaccinating in order to protect commercial
flocks from LP AIV outbreaks. Nevertheless, 13 years after
the use of the vaccination started and more than 2 billion
doses were used in the Mexican avian industry [4], an
increase in respiratory signs of disease has been observed
in vaccinated, field challenged birds.
The current increase in incidence of AIV infection is most
likely related to antigenic drifts occurred in field AIV
strains [5]. Moreover, veterinary services revealed more
than two log differences in cross hemagglutination inhibition tests between field isolates and the vaccine seed virus
(Lucio E., unpublished).
Vaccination programs produce faster antigenic drifts of
human and avian influenza viruses [6]. Nevertheless,
there are few biological systems to explore the dynamic of
influenza virus evolution. In the present study, we
explored the use of the Mexican aviculture as an example
of a suitable model to evaluate the evolutionary properties of endemic AIV under high vaccination pressure. The
Mexican aviculture system offers an excellent model to
study AIV genetic evolution under high vaccination pressure for two important grounds: i) avian influenza vaccination is a regular veterinary practice, and ii) poultry
systems are characterized by high avian population density per production unit. We compared HA gene
sequences from AIVs isolated between 1994 and 2000 [3],
more recent isolates (2002 to 2006) from vaccinated birds
showing clinical manifestations of avian influenza, and
the A/Chicken/Hidalgo/232/94 vaccine strain.
For the present study, we used the complete collection of
eighteen AIV strains isolated from years 2002 to 2006
from nine different regions of Mexico. These strains were
isolated and guarded by an officially certified laboratory
to issue reports for control and eradication of avian influenza in Mexico. All AIVs were obtained from vaccinated
birds showing clinical signs of avian influenza. Viral RNA
extraction from allantoic fluid was performed using conventional methods [7]. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR) was used for the amplification of the HA cleavage
site sequence, a marker for the virulence potential of avian
influenza viruses [8]. Sequencing of the HA gene segments
was performed using the 3730Xl automated sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, CA. USA). The nucleotide sequences
obtained in this study (available from the authors upon
request) and sequences retrieved from the GenBank database under accession numbers [GenBank:AY497063 to
AY497096] produced from Mexican AIVs [3] were analyzed by using the CLUSTALW package and then edited
using the jalview program [9]. Because the sequences
retrieved from GenBank differed in extension, the flanking N-term and C-term regions were removed for the
alignment. Edited sequences were re-aligned using the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/15

ClustalX 1.81 program [10] with the following parameters. Pair-wise: gap opening = 10.0, gap extension = 0.10;
Alignment: gap opening = 10.0, gap extension = 0.2, and
Gonnet series weight matrix. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the Maximum Parsimony method [11]
using the PAUP* 4.0 b10 program [12]. Trees were rooted
using [GenBank:AY497063] (vaccine strain) as ancestral
nucleotide sequence. The statistical significance of branch
order was estimated by the generation of 1000 replications of bootstrap re-sampling of the originally-aligned
nucleotide sequences.
For the eighteen HA sequences from recent (2002–2006)
Mexican AIV isolates, the nucleotide sequences similarity
varied between 99.6 and 86.8%. Phylogenetic trees show
that these HA gene sequences are grouped into 4 phylogenetic lineages that in general, matched the years of isolation (Figure 1A–B). For the construction of phylogenetic
trees, the vaccine strain was used as the ancestral sequence
(phylogenetic root) in order to determine the genetic variation between field isolates and the vaccine strain. Three
of the 2002 sequences were the most phylogenetically
closely related to the vaccine strain. Same results were
obtained when unrooted phylogenetic trees (not shown)
were constructed. These results indicate that the HA gene
from field strains constantly experience genetic variation,
and the accumulation of these genetic drifts allows distinguishing genetic changes that can be related to the year of
isolation.
Conversely, the construction of phylogenetic trees with
the HA sequences from 1994–2002 isolates and from
2002–2006 isolates (present study) show that the HA
sequences are grouped in four (I-IV) lineages. Likewise,
these 4 viral Mexican AIV lineages follow an isolation year
trend (Figures 1C–D). Same lineages were obtained when
unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed (not
shown). These four lineages include sequences previously
classified as Jalisco, A, and B [3]. Since 2004, no other
additional studies have evaluated the evolution of LP AIVs
circulating in Mexico. In here, we provide evidence of the
currently existing Mexican AIV lineages.
Mexico has been world's first country in adopting vaccination of commercial poultry as one of several measures for
avian influenza control and eradication. Since 1995, more
than 2 billion vaccine doses have been used in the Mexican avian industry [4].
Results from the present study show that recent Mexican
LP H5N2 AIV field isolates show constant drifts in their
genetic information. The phylogenetic analysis shows that
all eighteen recent isolates (2002–2006) have undergone
important drifts in the HA gene sequence as compared
with vaccine strain. This finding indicates that it is impor-

tant to consider new prophylactic strategies against avian
influenza in Mexico as well as in other countries which are
currently using the same vaccine. Swayne et al. (2000)
reported that the percent homology of the HA gene
sequence between field isolates and the vaccine strain is
essential to decrease spread levels of field AIV strains [13].
The genomic variation found in the present study might
explain the permanence of LP AIV in Mexico since 1994,
despite the use of both vaccination and stringent biosecurity measures [13].
In previous reports, homology in HA sequences of AIVs
isolated between 1994–2002 was 86.0–99.8% [3]. Comparable homology values (86.8–99.0%) were estimated in
the present study within the 2002–2006 AIV isolates.
Sequences from recent (2002–2006) AIV isolates and the
vaccine strain show significant phylogenetic divergence.
This could explain the clinical signs observed in the vaccinated chickens.
It is possible that avian influenza vaccination has resulted
in accelerated genetic drifts in the HA gene sequence, as
previously suggested by Lee et al. (2004). However, Ellis
and Zambon (2001), Gambaryan et al. (2006), Widjaja et
al. (2006) showed that viral replication per se allows for
the expression of drifts among subsequent viral populations [14-16].
The AIVs sequences obtained in the present study are
closely related to lineage B reported by Lee et al. (2004),
which are viruses phylogenetically more distant from the
vaccine strain [3]. Therefore, it is important to implement
more rigorous requisites than those proposed by the
World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) which only
considered protection afforded by the vaccine in terms of
bird survival rates. Together with other measures, protection in terms of reduced viral spread from vaccine strains
has also been an indispensable requirement to achieve the
goal of eradication.
The present phylogenetic analysis based on the analysis of
HA gene shows that cumulative genetic drifts in the HA
gene allow distinction between new and old AIV lineages.
The occurrence of influenza outbreaks could be associated
to antigenic drifts, in which changes in viral antigens provide and evolutionary advantage to re-infect the same host
[17]. All these together, support the recent concerns about
the challenge of AIV antigenic drift and influenza epidemics.
Finally, we consider that the current biological system
(Mexican avian industry) is a suitable model to evaluate
the evolutionary properties of endemic AIV under high
vaccination pressure. Further studies need to be con-
