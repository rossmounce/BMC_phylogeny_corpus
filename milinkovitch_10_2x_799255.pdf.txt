2× genomes - depth does matter

Abstract
Background: Given the availability of full genome sequences, mapping gene gains, duplications, and losses during
evolution should theoretically be straightforward. However, this endeavor suffers from overemphasis on detecting
conserved genome features, which in turn has led to sequencing multiple eutherian genomes with low coverage
rather than fewer genomes with high-coverage and more even distribution in the phylogeny. Although limitations
associated with analysis of low coverage genomes are recognized, they have not been quantified.
Results: Here, using recently developed comparative genomic application systems, we evaluate the impact of lowcoverage genomes on inferences pertaining to gene gains and losses when analyzing eukaryote genome evolution
through gene duplication. We demonstrate that, when performing inference of genome content evolution, lowcoverage genomes generate not only a massive number of false gene losses, but also striking artifacts in gene
duplication inference, especially at the most recent common ancestor of low-coverage genomes. We show that
the artifactual gains are caused by the low coverage of genome sequence per se rather than by the increased
taxon sampling in a biased portion of the species tree.
Conclusions: We argue that it will remain difficult to differentiate artifacts from true changes in modes and tempo
of genome evolution until there is better homogeneity in both taxon sampling and high-coverage sequencing.
This is important for broadening the utility of full genome data to the community of evolutionary biologists,
whose interests go well beyond widely conserved physiologies and developmental patterns as they seek to
understand the generative mechanisms underlying biological diversity.

Background
In the context of investigating correlations between genome and phenotype evolution, describing the evolution
of genome content (in terms of protein-coding genes)
should theoretically be straightforward given the
increasing number of available sequenced genomes and
of large-scale expression studies, accompanied by a constantly growing number of software and databases for
better integration and exploitation of this wealth of data.
However, this endeavor of mapping gene gains (including duplication events) and losses suffers from the lack
of explicit phylogenetic criteria in analytical tools, and
the overemphasis, in genome sequencing programs, on
detecting conserved genome features.
The first problem relates to the fact that many of the
methods and databases available for identifying duplication events and assessing orthology relationships of

genetic elements among genomes avoid the heavy computational cost of phylogenetic trees inference and the
difficulties associated with their interpretation, even
though phylogeny-based orthology/paralogy identification is widely accepted as the most valid approach [1-4].
Recently, however, the problem has been largely recognized and increasingly addressed by the comparative
genomics community. For example, ENSEMBL [5,6] and
the ‘phylome’ approach [7,8] are automated pipelines in
which orthologs and paralogs are systematically identified through the estimation of gene family phylogenetic
trees. Furthermore, the recently developed MANTiS
relational database [9] integrates phylogeny-based
orthology/paralogy assignments with functional and
expression data, allowing users to explore phylogenydriven (focusing on any set of branches), gene-driven
(focusing on any set of genes), function/process-driven,
and expression-driven questions in an explicit phylogenetic framework. Such application systems should help
in investigating whether the gene duplication phenomenon is generally relevant to adaptive evolution (that is,

beyond the classical examples of, for example, globins,
olfactory receptors, opsins, and transcription factor
diversifications), and might even help in understanding
the causal relationships between genome evolution and
increasing phenotypic complexity. However, the efficiency of these analytical tools inescapably depends on
the amount and quality of the available genome
sequence data. This leads us to the second, more pervasive problem of biases in whole genome sequencing program strategies.
Sequencing and analyzing the complete genome of a
eukaryotic species is a formidable and challenging task,
and the human genome project [10,11] will probably
remain a landmark in the history of science. Incentives
for sequencing genomes of non-human species mirror
historical motives for selecting laboratory model species:
the potential power of these species for understanding
human biology and generating biomedically relevant
data. This criterion has generated a striking taxonomic
bias in the choice of model species and sequencing projects [12]. For example, only 3% of full-genome sequencing projects use the localization of the corresponding

Page 2 of 12

species in the tree of life as a primary motivation [13].
As a result, prominent databases like ENSEMBL [14],
which generates and maintains automatic annotation of
selected eukaryotic genomes, included 25 mammalian
and 5 teleost fish genomes, but only one bird, one
amphibian, and no reptile in its version 49 (Figure 1).
One major explicit goal of genome sequencing projects is that comparisons of the human genome with
those of other eukaryotes allow detection of coding and
non-coding conserved (hence, likely functional) elements
in the human genome. Importantly, the statistical power
of such comparisons depends on the sum of branch
lengths of the phylogenetic tree among the species used
[15]. However, it is likely that a significant proportion of
these possibly biomedically relevant conserved features
are recent and thus specific to relatively shallow
branches (for example, mammals, eutheria, primates)
rather than common to all eukaryotes. In that case, the
only way to increase statistical power is to increase the
number of sequenced genomes for species belonging to
the monophyletic group defined by the relevant shallow
branch. This realization has motivated the development

of the ‘Mammalian Genome Project’ [16] aiming at
sequencing the genome of multiple placental mammals
with a low mean coverage of 2×. The sequenced species
were chosen to maximize the ratio [Sum of branch
lengths within mammals]/[Number of genomes
sequenced]. Note that the decision to choose the placental mammal branch is somewhat arbitrary: there is no a
priori reason to believe that there are more (or more
important) Eutherian-specific than, for example, Therian-specific biomedically relevant conserved features,
and sequencing a few well-chosen marsupial species
would have generated more cumulative branch length
for less species. However, this decision might have been
motivated by the facts that using a shallower branch will
facilitate annotation of the newly sequenced genomes
and that some of the chosen species are laboratory
model species.
We think that the emphasis on searching for evolutionary conservation - hence, the decision to prefer 24
low-coverage (2×) genomes to, for example, 6 genomes
at 8× coverage, hurts more general endeavors, such as
the mapping of gene gains and losses in the evolution of
eukaryotic genomes. Although the inherent limitations
associated with low coverage genome analyses are recognized [15], their impact on understanding differences
among organisms (rather than similarities) has not been
quantified.
Here, we evaluate the impact of low-coverage genomes on inferences pertaining to gene gains and losses
when analyzing the mode and tempo of eukaryote genome evolution through gene duplication. Such assessments are important for broadening the utility of full
genome data to the community of evolutionary biologists, whose interests go well beyond widely conserved
physiologies and developmental processes/patterns as
they seek to understand the generative mechanisms
underlying biological diversity.

Results and Discussion
On the basis of the 38 metazoan genomes (longest
splice-variant of each protein-coding gene) available in
version 49 of the ENSEMBL database (that is, six primates, one tree shrew, four rodents, two lagomorphs,
two carnivores, one perissodactyl, one cetartiodactyl,
one bat, two insectivores, one xenarthran, two afrotherians, one marsupial, one monotreme, one bird, one
amphibian, five teleost fishes, two urochordates, one
nematode, and three insects), and using the baker’s
yeast as an outgroup, we used MANTiS version 1.0.15
[17] to generate two datasets including information on
the presence/absence of genes. The first dataset
(’families only’) contains one character for each single
(species-specific) gene and for each protein family (that
is, only de novo gains are considered), whereas in the

Page 3 of 12

second dataset (’with duplications’), a new character was
additionally created for each duplication event, such that
each protein family is represented by several characters.
Additional details are given in [9]. To investigate the
influence of low-coverage (2×) genomes on inferred genome evolutionary patterns, we also generated with
MANTiS the corresponding datasets using versions 39
to 48 of ENSEMBL (Figure 1) and the human phylome
[8], available at [18]. The ENSEMBL v39 archive database includes 18 metazoan species with 7 placental
mammal genomes of coverage >4 (except for the rhesus
macaque, Macaca mulatta), whereas subsequent versions include an increasing number of low mean coverage (2×) genomes (v49 includes 38 metazoan species
with 24 placental mammal genomes, of which 14 are of
2× mean coverage). The PhylomeDB database uses only
high-coverage genomes and an improved phylogenetic
pipeline that includes alignment trimming, branchlength optimization, evolutionary model testing, and
maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogeny inference
(see Materials and methods for details).
Using MANTiS, we mapped gains and losses of characters on the species phylogeny best supported by previous phylogenetic analyses [19-21]: gains are assigned
directly from the topology of gene family trees whereas
the most likely positions of gene losses are estimated
using a maximum likelihood function (see Materials and
methods). These character mapping analyses show that
acquisition of new genes is an important, continuous,
and general phenomenon and explains part of the
increase in genome size during evolution. Plotting, for
all species lineages, genome size - in terms both of
number of predicted gene counts (Figure 2) and sum of
gene length (data not shown) - against evolutionary
time indicates that the rate of gains on the vertebrate
linage (Figure 2, left dashed line) is particularly high, a
result explained by the two rounds of whole genome
duplication that occurred at the dawn of vertebrate evolution [8,22]. This high increase in gene number is
exceeded, however, on the first eutherian (true mammals) branch (Figure 2, right dashed line), a particularly
spectacular result given the much smaller length (in
terms of evolutionary time) of the eutherian compared
to the vertebrate branch. Equally striking is the reduction in genome size for all taxa after the three first basal
eutherian branches (Figure 2). However, it is likely that
most of the subsequent massive gene losses, after the
eutherian peak in gene gains, are artifacts caused by low
quality genomes. Indeed, plotting the number of gene
losses against evolutionary time (Figure 3) indicates that
12 of the 14 low-coverage genomes in v49 of ENSEMBL
are associated with the largest number of losses in the
corresponding terminal branches, or in the most recent
common ancestor of pairs of these taxa (for example,

the insectivore or the lagomorph nodes). The two
remaining low coverage genomes (bushbaby and mouse
lemur) suffer less artifactual losses probably because a
large number of false losses have been assigned to deeper ancestors of these two species and because annotation of these genomes was greatly facilitated by the use
of the high-quality human genome.
We used MANTiS to map genome size against evolutionary time (for the lineage leading to human) for various versions of the ENSEMBL database and for the
Phylome database. These analyses indicate that the addition of low-coverage genomes (appearing in version 41
of ENSEMBL) generate the high, and probably

artifactual, rate of gene gains in the first eutherian
branches, whereas the presence of an increased rate of
gene gains in the vertebrate branch is robust to the
removal of low-coverage genomes (Figure 4).
Although the interrupted and missing genes in 2×
coverage genomes are likely to generate false losses (Figure 3), they have no obvious a priori reason to cause an
artifactual increase in duplication events in deeper
branches. Similarly, although errors in draft genomes
can cause misassemblies and unmerged overlaps hence, causing errors in the orthology assignment of
genes through false positives (artificial duplications) the phenomenon should not specifically impact the

Figure 4 Inference of increased gene content through evolutionary time for the lineage leading to the human genome. The analysis is
performed with versions 39, 40, and 41 of the ENSEMBL database as well as with the human phylome (PhylomeDB, as of December 2008). The
inclusion of low-coverage genomes (appearing for the first time in ENSEMBL v41 gene trees) generates an artifactual peak of gene gains at the
eutherian nodes. Note that the first four low-coverage genomes (rabbit, elephant, tenrec, and armadillo) were added in the sequence database,
but not the gene trees, of version 40.

three first eutherian branches more than shallower
branches (low coverage genomes are distributed all
across the eutherian tree). Note that the eutherian
branch, as defined in version 39 of ENSEMBL, is cut in
three parts in subsequent versions of ENSEMBL by the
addition of the Afrotheria (elephant and tenrec) and the
Xenarthra (armadillo) lineages (Figure 5a). A possible
explanation for the artifactual peak of gains in the
eutherian branches would be that the supposedly true
phylogenetic position of Afrotheria and Xenarthra is
incorrect: true gene tree versus wrong species tree
reconciliation would then generate false duplication
events in the first eutherian branch followed by losses
(Figure 5b). However, mapping gains and losses in
MANTiS after implementing the three possible topologies among the outgroup, Afrotheria, Xenarthra, and
Laurasiatheria plus Euarchontoglires did not remove the
artifactual peak of gains in the eutherian branches

(Figure 6), although the use of the different species trees
generated a different distribution of these changes
among the three eutherian branches (Figure 6, inset).
We performed again reconciliation of all ENSEMBL
gene trees with the species phylogeny in which nematodes and arthropods form a monophyletic group. This
generated some differences in gains and losses mapping
in the base of the tree but did not remove the artifactual
peak in the eutherian branches (green curve in Figure
6).
An alternative explanation for the artifactual peak of
gene gains in the eutherian branches would be the mirror situation: correct species tree but incorrect gene
trees. To test this hypothesis, we first verified whether,
in 2× genomes, the mean sequence coverage of genes
inferred as duplicated in the three first eutherian
branches (version 49) is lower than the mean sequence
coverage of genes inferred as duplicated elsewhere in

the species tree. As the sequence coverage, nucleotide
by nucleotide, or gene per gene, is (to our knowledge)
not publicly available, we counted the number of ambiguities in each protein sequence of each species and
found that 2× genomes exhibit higher mean proportions
of ambiguities, ranging from 9.11% (Ochotona princeps)
to 15.46% (Dasypus novemcinctus), compared to 0 to
0.24% in high coverage genomes. However, we did not
observe a higher mean proportion of ambiguities (for

neither 2× nor high-coverage genomes) in genes inferred
as duplicated in the three first eutherian branches than
in genes inferred as duplicated elsewhere in the species
tree.
One could argue that many of the artifactual gains in
the eutherian nodes might not be caused by the low
coverage of 2× genomes per se but are rather simply the
product of increased taxon sampling in a very biased
and small portion of the species tree: increasing the

Figure 6 Mapping of genome content using tree reconciliation performed by us (green) and ENSEMBL (blue). The differences between
the two curves are due to differences between the species trees used: for example, we group Caenorhabditis elegans (nematodes) with
arthropods (in the clade Ecdysozoa [35]) whereas it is positioned at the base of Bilateria in the species tree used by ENSEMBL. The inset shows
the different mapping generated when using the tree alternative phylogenies among Afrotheria, Armadillo, and the remaining eutherians
(groups A and B in Figure 5).

number of mammalian species reduces the lengths of
already short branches, hence increasing the risk of misplacing at least one lineage in gene trees and generating
false gains and subsequent false losses. For example, any
duplication node labeled ‘Eutheria’ with a single ‘orphan’
species on one side of the duplication node (blue branch
in Figure 7a) is suspicious as it implies one duplication
event in the basal eutherian branch and multiple losses
in shallower branches. The reality of the duplication
event is even more questionable when the orphan species is absent from the upper side of the duplication
node (green subtree in Figure 7a) as it requires reciprocal complementary gene losses (a quite unlikely phenomenon indeed). We screened all 26,467 trees in the
ENSEMBL database and found that 2× genomes contribute significantly more (0.005 < P-value < 0.016; onetail Mann-Whitney test) than good quality genomes to
such suspicious topologies (Table 1). Note also that the
four species highest in the list (shrew, hedgehog, pika,
and guinea pig) are far from the base of the eutherian
tree and are therefore unlikely to be represented by

orphan sequences. Statistical significance is not due to
the basal Afrotherian and armadillo taxa as removing
these species from the list even reduces the P-values to
0.001 to 0.007. Finally, for assessing the validity of
inferred duplication nodes, we used the species-overlap
score of all 115,451 duplication nodes (in the 26,467
ENSEMBLE trees) defined as the fraction of shared species over the total of species in post-duplication nodes
[8] (equivalent to the ‘duplication consistency score’ in
[1]). Figure 7b indicates that duplications at the eutherian node exhibit one of the three worst confidence
values (mean ± standard deviation = 3.7 ± 11.5) among
all nodes in the species phylogeny.
To test our hypothesis, we used large-scale simulations
to evaluate the impact of reducing sequence quality on
gene tree and duplication inferences. Starting from the
high-coverage genomes included in the phylomeDB [7],
we randomly introduced continuous stretches of ambiguous sequences in the protein sequences of three eutherian species, Pan troglodytes, Mus musculus and Bos
taurus, according to a distribution approximating that

Figure 7 Possible artifactual gains and losses due to reconciliation between an incorrect gene tree and a correct species tree. (a) Gene
trees with a single eutherian species (a(i)) on one side of a duplication node (red dot) and several species on the other side (especially if a(i) is
absent from that side) are highly suspicious (Table 1). Such an incorrect gene tree will gen-erate one false duplication on the basal eutherian
lineage followed by multiple false losses (vertical green and oblique blue bars). (b) Average duplication confidence (and standard de-viation) for

observed in real low-coverage sequences. All sequences
were then re-aligned and all 19,361 gene trees were
reconstructed and analyzed in the same way as the nonperturbed PhylomeDB dataset. Figure 8 indicates that
our hypothesis is verified: the introduction of ambiguities
in three of the seven eutherian species generates errors in
the inference of gene trees that, in turn, produce spurious
duplications events. These artifacts are distributed in various places in the species tree, but the most impacted
nodes are clearly the basal eutherian lineages (Figure 8).

Conclusions
We argue that the phylogenetic distribution of species
for which so-called ‘full genome sequences’ are available, as well as the coverage of these genomes, are key
parameters that have not been given enough appreciation: it will remain exceedingly difficult to differentiate
artifacts from true changes in modes and tempo of
genome evolution until better homogeneity in both
taxon sampling and high-coverage sequencing is
achieved. For example, the groups of Amphibia (frogs,

toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians) or Reptilia
(turtles, lizards, crocodiles, and birds) exhibit larger
diversities than mammals but have long been represented in major databases such as ENSEMBL by a single species (Xenopus tropicalis, and Gallus Gallus,
respectively) at the tip of a very long branch. The
recent inclusion (since ENSEMBL v53) of the highcoverage genome sequences from the green anole
lizard (Anolis carolinensis) and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) are, in this respect, very important for
improved mapping reliability of genome content evolution in the amniote tree. Similarly, including some of
the missing major animal lineages (for example,
Lophotrochozoans such as annelids, molluscs, and flat
worms) is crucial if reliable analysis is to be extended
to the whole group of Metazoa. However, major artifacts in gene gains and losses (and possibly others that
we did not uncover here) will remain until all low-

coverage genomes are promoted to high coverage.
Note that very recent (generally species-specific) duplications will remain very difficult to differentiate from
parental alleles even in high-coverage genomes.
Obviously, the artifactual gains and losses of duplicates discussed here are problematic only for a subset of
comparative genomic analyses. For example, these artifacts are of low relevance for the specific and significant
purpose behind the initial production of low-coverage
genomes: detecting conserved genome features [15].
Furthermore, these artifacts had little impact on analyses
that uncovered historical constraints in gene expression
[23], despite these analyses requiring the determination
of the first appearance of genes and duplicates in the
species phylogeny. However, artifacts in mapping of
genome content evolution will likely mislead many users
who access genomic databases, possibly resulting in a
wave of unreliable analyses.

performed with the original human phylome (PhylomeDB, lower dashed line) and a simulated low-coverage PhylomeDB (upper dashed line) in
which stretches of ambiguous sequences have been introduced in the protein sequences of three of the seven eutherian species. The
transformation of these high-coverage genomes into simulated low-coverage genomes generates artifactual gains all across the species tree, but
more acutely so at the basal eutherian nodes (the plain line, and secondary axis, indicates the ratio of genome content between the simulated
low-coverage PhylomeDB and the original PhylomeDB).

Fortunately, the tremendous drop in sequencing costs
brought about by next generation sequencing platforms
(for example, [24,25]) allows the comparative genomics
community to contemplate the possibility of sequencing,
in the coming decade, hundreds or even thousands of
complex genomes spanning a wide phylogenetic diversity (for example, [26]). We, however, urge the community to go for quality rather than for quantity: highcoverage should be a compulsory requirement in these
large genome sequencing projects such that genome
content evolution, as well as coding and non-coding
sequence changes, can be reliably inferred for a vastly
improved understanding of genome evolution.

Materials and methods
PhylomeDB data

As an alternative to ENSEMBL trees, we used data from
the human phylome [8] available through the PhylomeDB database [7]. The pipeline used to reconstruct the
human phylome is described in more detail elsewhere
[8]. In brief, a database containing all proteins encoded

in the 39 eukaryotic genomes (all high coverage)
included in the phylome is searched for putative homologs of human proteins by a Smith-Waterman algorithm
[27]. Significant hits with an e-value lower than 10-3 and
that could be aligned over a continuous region longer
than 50% of the query sequence were selected and subsequently aligned with MUSCLE 3.6 [28]. Alignments
are trimmed using trimAl 1.0 [29] to remove columns
with gaps in more than 10% of the sequences, unless
such a procedure removes more than one-third of the
positions in the alignment. In such cases the percentage
of sequences with gaps allowed is automatically
increased until at least two-thirds of the initial columns
are conserved. Finally, phylogenetic trees are reconstructed by using maximum likelihood as implemented
in PhyML v2.4.4 [30]. In all cases a discrete gamma-distribution model is assumed with four rate categories
and invariant sites, where the gamma shape parameter
and the fraction of invariant sites are estimated from
the data. To avoid model-based biases, protein evolutionary models (JTT, Dayhoff, MtREV, VT and

BLOSUM62) are tested to then select the one best fitting the data according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [31].
Gene tree-species tree reconciliation

We used a strict tree-reconciliation algorithm [32] as
implemented in ETE [33]. In this case, every gene tree
is compared to the topology of a given species tree by
comparing the specific sets of species contained by all
tree splits. The strict reconciliation algorithm maps the
gene tree onto the species tree and explains any incongruence in terms of the minimal set of duplication and
gene-loss events necessary to derive the observed gene
tree topology from the one proposed in the species tree.
These inferred duplication events are marked on the
tree, and orthology and paralogy relations are derived
accordingly.
Simulation of low coverage sequence data

To evaluate the phylogenetic effects of low quality
sequence data, stretches of ambiguous sequences where
introduced in the protein sequences of three species
(P. troglodytes, M. musculus and B. taurus) of the phylomeDB. Continuous stretches of amino acids were substituted by ‘X’s according to a normal distribution of
lengths with mean μ, and standard deviation δ. These
parameters were set for each of the three selected species: P. troglodytes (μ = 9%, and δ = 3% of the length of
the sequence); M. musculus (12%, 3%); and B. taurus
(15%, 3%); that is, according to the range of values we
observed in real low-coverage genomes. After introducing the simulated ambiguities, sequences were realigned and trees were reconstructed and analyzed in
the same way as the non-perturbed PhylomeDB dataset.
