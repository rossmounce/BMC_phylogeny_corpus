Abstract
Okra leaf curl disease (OLCD) is a major constraint on okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) production and is widespread
in Africa. Using a large number of samples representative of the major growing regions in Burkina Faso (BF), we
show that the disease is associated with a monopartite begomovirus and satellite DNA complexes. Twenty-three
complete genomic sequences of Cotton leaf curl Gezira virus (CLCuGV) isolates associated with OLCD, sharing 95 to
99% nucleotide identity, were cloned and sequenced. Six betasatellite and four alphasatellite (DNA-1) molecules
were also characterized. The six isolates of betasatellite associated with CLCuGV isolates correspond to Cotton leaf
curl Gezira betasatellite (CLCuGB) (88 to 98% nucleotide identity). One isolate of alphasatellite is a variant of Cotton
leaf curl Gezira alphasatellite (CLCuGA) (89% nucleotide identity), whereas the three others isolates appear to correspond to a new species of alphasatellite (CLCuGA most similar sequence present 52 to 60% nucleotide identity),
provisionally named Okra leaf curl Burkina Faso alphasatellite (OLCBFA). Recombination analysis of the viruses
demonstrated the interspecies recombinant origin of all CLCuGV isolates, with parents being close to Hollyhock leaf
crumple virus (AY036009) and Tomato leaf curl Diana virus (AM701765). Combined with the presence of satellites
DNA, these results highlight the complexity of begomoviruses associated with OLCD.
Findings
Okra leaf curl disease (OLCD) is commonly observed
among okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) crops in Burkina
Faso (BF) and several African countries [1-5]. Affected
plants are severely stunted with apical leaf curl (upward
or downward), distortion and thickening of the veins. In
BF, okra is widely grown in both rainy and dry seasons.
It is a major source of income particularly for smallscale farming. Viral diseases are important constraints in
the production of this crop [6]. Recently, it was shown
that OLCD in Africa is associated with a complex of
begomoviruses: Cotton leaf curl Gezira virus (CLCuGV;
[7,4,5]), Okra yellow crinkle virus (OYCrV; [8]) and Hollyhock leaf crumple virus (HoLCrV;[9,10]).
Viruses of the genus Begomovirus belong to the family
Geminiviridae and are transmitted by the whitefly vector

Bemisia tabaci to dicotyledonous plants [11]. They have
emerged as a major constraint for many vegetable and
fibre crops throughout the world [12]. Begomoviruses
are either bipartite with two genomic components,
designated as DNA-A and DNA-B or monopartite with
only DNA-A like components [13]. Some of the monopartite begomoviruses are also associated with additional
circular ssDNA molecules, such as betasatellite or alphasatellite (previously known as DNA-1) that are nearly
half the size of DNA-A. Betasatellites have been
involved in pathogenicity but alphasatellites have no
known function and are certainly not involved in symptom induction [14-16]. Alphasatellites have only been
shown to be present in plants infected with monopartite
begomoviruses in association with betasatellites [17].
The aim of our study was to characterize at the molecular level the complex of viruses involved in OLCD in
BF and their relationship with other begomoviruses. In
association with a single Old World begomovirus, we
describe their associated satellite DNAs.

During May 2008 to April 2009, 74 leaf samples exhibiting typical OLCD symptoms were collected from okra
fields in the major growing regions of BF around Tiébélé,
Kampala, Pô, Kamboinsé, Bazèga and Bama (Kou valley)
localities. Total DNA was extracted using DNeasy® Plant
Minikit (Qiagen) before detection of begomoviruses using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers of
either the DNA-A [18] or betasatellite and alphasatellite
[19,20]. Full-length viral genomes were amplified from the
PCR-positive samples by rolling-circle amplification (RCA)
[21]. The amplified DNAs were digested with endonucleases BamHI or PstI, and the DNA fragments of the
expected size (~2.8 kb for DNA-A and ~1.4 kb for satellites) were cloned into pGEM®-3Zf (+) vector (Promega
Biotech). Cloned genome components were sequenced by
Macrogen Inc. (South Korea). Contigs were assembled
with the DNAMAN software (Lynnon, Quebec, Canada)
and subsequently aligned using the ClustalW tool [22]
implemented in MEGA 4 [23]. Sequence comparisons
were performed in MEGA 4 with pairwise deletion of
gaps. The optimal model of sequence evolution, defined
with ModelTest [24], was used for maximum likelihood
(ML) phylogenetic reconstruction using PHYML_v2.4.4
[25]. The degree of support for individual branches within
the resulting phylogenetic trees was assessed with 1000
full ML bootstrap iterations. The trees were visualized
using FigTree v1.1.1 software.
Recombination was analyzed using our sequences and
a set of sequences representing the whole African begomovirus diversity (representing an alignment of 121
sequences). Detection of potential recombinant
sequences, identification of likely parental sequences,
and localization of possible recombination breakpoints
was carried out using RDP [26], GENECONV [27],
BOOTSCAN [28], MAXIMUM CHI SQUARE [29],
CHIMAERA [28], SISTER SCAN [30] and 3Seq [31]
recombination detection methods as implemented in
RDP3 [32]. The analysis was performed with default settings for the different detection methods and a Bonferroni corrected P-value cut-off of 0.05. Only events
detected with 3 methods or more were accepted.
Despite a very poor preservation of samples (high
necrosis), 48 samples of the 74 were detected as being
infected with begomovirus using PCR amplifications
with the universal primer pair VD360-CD1266 recovering the conserved CP ORF [18]. From the positive samples, 23 begomovirus genome sequences with length
between 2761 to 2773 nucleotides (nt) were successfully
obtained using RCA. Pairwise sequence comparison
demonstrated that the 23 new genome sequences of
monopartite begomoviruses from BF are genetically
related to the same strain (94.7 to 100% identity
amongst themselves). A BLAST search identify the most
similar virus sequences as being Cotton leaf curl Gezira

virus (CLCuGV) isolates, a monopartite Begomovirus
first identified in Sudan [33]. Further pairwise sequence
analyses showed that the 23 sequences shared between
94.8 to 98.8% nt identity with CLCuGV isolates from
Niger (FJ469626, EU432373, EU432374), 93.7 to 96.2%
with CLCuGV from Sudan (AY036007, AY036008), 92.4
to 96.1% with CLCuGV from Egypt (AY036006,
AY036010) and 89.3 to 91.4% with CLCuGV from
Cameroon (FM164726). According to the ICTV guidelines, these results of nucleotide identity <93% between
isolates of CLCuGV suggest the existence of several
strains within this begomovirus species. Similar comparisons performed with the other two Begomovirus species
infecting Malvaceae in Africa showed low nucleotide
sequence identity: 71.7 to 72.6% obtained with Okra yellow crinkle virus (DQ902715, EU024118, FM164724)
and 83.4 to 84.2 with Hollyhock leaf crumple virus
(AY036009, AF014881).
All 23 isolates of begomovirus infecting okra in BF
have the typical genome organization of Old World
monopartite begomoviruses. This organization consisted
of the presence of six open reading frames (ORFs) on
the DNA-A corresponding to V1 and V2 on the virion
strand and C1, C2, C3 and C4 on the complementary
strand [34]. The IR sequences located between the start
codons of the C1 and V2 are 289 to 300 nt. In this
region, they present a typical replication origin (↓),
including an inverted repeat sequence containing the
highly conserved nanonuclotide sequence TAATATT↓AC [35,5].
Based on the presently applicable species demarcation
threshold of 89% for begomoviruses [36], we conclude
that the 23 begomovirus isolates isolated from okra in
BF belong to the species Cotton leaf curl Gezira virus
and the Niger strain (See Table 1 for percentage of similarities and Table 2 for isolates description and accession numbers). In addition, a maximum-likelihood
phylogenetic tree constructed using PHYML and the
GTR+I+G model of sequence evolution (ModelTest),
confirms that okra begomoviruses reported here cluster
with the isolates of Cotton leaf curl Gezira virus
(CLCuGV) (Figure 1). A clear phylogeographic separation is observed between the diversity of CLCuGV isolates of okra: West Africa (Niger strain), Central Africa
(Cameroon strain), East Africa (Sudan strain) and northeast of the Africa (Egypt strain).
Betasatellites were found associated to all isolates from
BF except CLCuGV-NE[BF:Baz:Ok:09] and CLCuGV-NE
[BF:Bam:Ok:09] while alphasatellites were detected
only in association with the seven following isolates:
CLCuGV-NE[BF:Kap:Ok7:08], CLCuGV-NE[BF:Pô:
Ok1:08], CLCuGV-NE[BF:Pô:Ok2:08], CLCuGV-NE[BF:
Pô:Ok4:08], CLCuGV-NE[BF:Pô:Ok5:08], CLCuGVNE[BF:Pô:Ok6:08] and CLCuGV-NE[BF:Pô:Ok7:08].

1347 nucleotides, respectively. All betasatellites showed
typical features consisting of the presence of a single
ORF bC1 in the complementary-sense, a region of
sequence rich in adenine (A) (nt 703-892 with 58.4 to
58.7% A residues) and a satellite conserved region (SCR)
with a predicted stem-loop structure containing the
geminivirus nonanucleotide sequence (TAATATTAC)
[37]. The nucleotide sequence comparison showed that
our sequences had nucleotide identities ranging from
88.1 to 98.7% with betasatellites from Cameroon, Egypt,
Mali, Niger and Sudan. In a phylogenetic analysis based
upon alignments of the complete betasatellites sequences,
the BF betasatellite sequences segregated with

betasatellites associated with okra begomoviruses from
Africa (Figure 2). Based on the recently established
species demarcation threshold for betasatellites (78%
nucleotide sequence identity; [38]), the betasatellites
reported in this study belong to the same species Cotton
leaf curl Gezira betasatellite (see Table 3 for betasatellites
isolates description and accession numbers). Interestingly
and under our knowledge, this species represent the only
known betasatellite described in Africa on malvaceous
and tomato plants. Associated to the absence of betasatellites in the New World and the existence of a high
diversity of betasatellites in Asia, this result confirms that
the centre of diversity appears to be in southern Asia
[39].

1382, 1353, 1299 and 1353 nt respectively. The alphasatellite sequence associated with CLCuGV-NE[BF:Kap:
Ok7:08] display the highest level of nucleotide sequence
identity (88.9%) with Cotton leaf curl Gezira alphasatellite from Mali (CLCuGA-[Mali:Bamako]; EU589450).
The phylogenetic analysis showed that the alphasatellite
associated with CLCuGV-NE[BF:Kap:Ok7:08] segregate
with CLCuGA-[Mali:Bamako] and OLCA-[Sudan:2007]
(Figure 3) and has an arrangement typical of characterized alphasatellites [40], containing a single ORF in the
virion sense, an A-rich region with 51% adenine and a
hairpin structure with the loop sequence TAGTATTAC.
The alphasatellites associated with CLCuGV-NE[BF:Pô:
Ok1:08], CLCuGV-NE[BF:Pô:Ok4:08] and CLCuGV-NE
[BF:Pô:Ok5:08] shared between 84.8 to 100% nucleotide
sequence identity amongst themselves and only 52.4 to
60.1% with the alphasatellites associated with CLCuGVNE[BF:Kap:Ok7:08] and those characterized in Mali and
Sudan (respectively, CLCuGA-[Mali:Bamako] and
OLCD1-[Sudan:2007]). Considering the suggested species demarcation threshold of 83% nucleotide sequence
identity for alphasatellites [17], these alphasatellites
represent isolates of a new species provisionally named
Okra leaf curl Burkina Faso alphasatellite, clustering
together in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3; see Table 3
for aphasatellites accession numbers). These particular

Page 8 of 10

alphasatellite isolates contain a single ORF in the virion
sense and a predicted hairpin structure with the loop
sequence CAGTATTAC.
Further to the sequence description of the viral isolates, we were interested in their possible recombinant
origin. Three distinct recombination events (a, b and c)
were detected within the full genome sequences of
CLCuGV isolates (Figure 4), using a large sequence
alignment of geminiviruses [41]. The presence or
absence of these recombination events has identified
four genetic groups of viruses (G1 to G4; Figures 1 and
4). Recombination event b present in all CLCuGV isolates involves a major parent being related to the
HoLCrV described in north Africa (Egypt; [9]) and a
minor parent related to ToLCDiaV described in the
south-west Indian Ocean Islands (Madagascar; [41]).
Compared to events a and c based on intra-strain
recombination, event b seems to be more ancient. The
recombination events a and c specific to isolates G1, G3
and G4 have been characterized in Burkina Faso and in
Niger and appear to represent a specific geographic signature. The distribution of the recombination breakpoints observed here confirm the existence of
recombination hot spots over the intergenic region (IR)
and the centre of C1 ORF (Figure 4) as described by
Lefeuvre et al. [41]. The recombination event c of

Figure 4 Recombinant regions (a, b and c) detected within the African isolates of CLCuGV sequences using RDP3. Four genetic groups
(G1 to G4) have been defined on the presence or absence of recombination events. The genome at the top of the figure corresponds to the
schematic representation of sequences below. Region coordinates are nucleotide positions of detected recombination breakpoints in the
multiple sequence alignment used to detect recombination. Wherever possible, parental sequences are identified. “Major” and “Minor” parents
are sequences that were used, along with the indicated recombinant sequence, to identify recombination. Whereas for each identified event the
minor parent is apparently the contributor of the sequence within the indicated region, the major parent is the apparent contributor of the rest
of the sequence. Note that the identified “parental sequences” are not the actual parents but are simply those sequences most similar to the
actual parents in the analysed dataset. Recombinant regions and parental viruses were identified using the RDP (R), GENECONV (G), BOOTSCAN
(B), MAXIMUM CHI SQUARE (M), CHIMAERA (C), SISTER SCAN (S) and 3Seq (T) methods. Whereas upper case letters imply a method detected
recombination with a multiple comparison corrected P-value < 0.01, lower case letters imply the method detected recombination with a
multiple comparison corrected P-value <0.05 but > = 0.01.

isolates G3 and G4 covers the N terminus of the replication associated protein (Rep) which contains the
iteron-related domain (IRD) [42]. This domain is
involved in the specificity of interaction with iterated
DNA motifs (iterons) of the geminivirus origin of replication (ori), functioning as essential elements for specific
virus replication. Since the IRD domain of G3 and G4
isolates (MAPTKKFRINSKNYFL) is different from the
IRD domains of G1 and G2 isolates (MPPSKRFLINAKNYFL or MPFGTHYILSTDILER), the biological
aspects of recombination events should be investigated
in the future.
In conclusion, in Burkina Faso OLCD is mainly caused
by a single begomovirus species and a complex of beta
and alpha satellite species, contrary to what happens in
the neighbouring countries Mali and Niger (respectively,
[5,4]). Taken together, the current molecular results
highlight the complex aetiology of the OLCD in Africa
and the need for further investigations.
